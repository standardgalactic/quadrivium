PREFACE
When George Lucas was asked why he made Star Wars, he replied, “It’s the kind of movie 
I like to see, but no one seemed to be making them. So, I decided to make one.” We realized 
that no one seemed to be writing the kind of textbook we wanted to use in our classes. So, 
after years of supplementing texts with fresh, lively, real-world examples from newspapers, 
magazines, Web sites, and professional journals, we decided to write an economics text that 
delivers complete economics coverage with many real-world business examples. Our goal 
was to keep our classes “widget free.”
New to the Fourth Edition
The severe economic downturn that began in 2007 with the bursting of the housing bubble 
was still affecting the economy in 2011. Unemployment had risen to levels not seen in de-
cades and remained above 9 percent for more than two and a half years. The crisis in the 
financial system was the worst since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Policy debates inten-
sified as Congress passed and President Barack Obama enacted the American Recovery and 
Reinvestment Act of 2009, the largest package of spending increases and tax cuts in history. 
The Federal Reserve sailed into uncharted waters as it developed new policy tools to deal 
with the unprecedented financial turmoil. Other long-running policy debates continued 
as well, as comprehensive health care legislation, looming cost increases for Social Security 
and Medicare, huge long-run budget deficits, environmental problems, income inequality, 
and changes to the tax system all received attention from economists, policymakers, and the 
public. 
In this new edition, we help students understand recent economic events and the policy 
responses to them. As in the earlier editions, we place applications at the forefront of the 
discussion. We believe that students find the study of economics more interesting and easier 
to master when they see economic analysis applied to real-world issues that concern them.
Here is a summary of the changes in this fourth edition. Please see the next section, 
starting on the next page, for details on each of these changes:
 • A new Chapter 7, “The Economics of Health Care,” covers health care around the world, 
information problems and externalities in the market for health care, and the debate 
over President Obama’s Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.
 • There is new coverage of the slow recovery from the recession and financial crisis of 
2007–2009.
 • There is new coverage of initiatives by the Federal Reserve, including quantitative eas-
ing and Operation Twist.
 • There is new coverage of fiscal policy, including analysis of the debate over fiscal stimu-
lus and the magnitude of multipliers for government spending and taxes.
 • All companies in the chapter openers have been either replaced with new companies or 
updated with current information.
 • All chapters include new An Inside Look newspaper articles and analyses to help stu-
dents apply economic thinking to current events and policy debates.
 • There are 28 new Making the Connection features to help students tie economic con-
cepts to current events and policy issues.
 • Figures and tables have been updated, using the latest data available.
 • Many of the end-of-chapter problems have been either replaced or updated.
In this new edition, we have taken the opportunity to make many changes throughout 
the text, while concentrating on the key areas described in the following sections.

xxx 
P R E F A C E
Policy debates, including health care, trade, and pollution. The number of jobs in the 
health care sector continues to increase. In Chapter 1, “Economics: Foundations and Mod-
els,” we use the debate about whether public policy is resulting in physicians leaving pri-
vate practice to introduce students to positive and normative economic analysis. In Chapter 
9, “Comparative Advantage and the Gains from International Trade,” we explore the “Buy 
American” provision in the 2009 stimulus package.
As this book goes to press, the debate continues over the consequences of the 2010 
overhaul of the U.S. health care system. In Chapter 2, “Trade-offs, Comparative Advan-
tage, and the Market System,” we discuss the trade-offs involved in health care spending 
and the Medicare and Medicaid programs. We revisit the topic of health care in the new 
Chapter 7, “The Economics of Health Care,” where we discuss projections of health care 
spending and the role of the U.S. government in the health care system. In Chapter 17, 
“The Markets for Labor and Other Factors of Production,” we discuss whether U.S. firms 
are handicapped in competing with foreign firms by paying for their employees’ health 
insurance. We return to the health care topic in Chapter 18, “Public Choice, Taxes, and 
the Distribution of Income,” with a news article and analysis on a proposed soda tax to 
pay for health care.
The United States has made progress in reducing air pollution in the years since Con-
gress passed the Clean Air Act in 1970. In Chapter 5, “Externalities, Environmental Policy, 
and Public Goods,” we use the economic concepts of marginal cost, marginal benefit, and 
efficiency to discuss environmental policy, including President Barack Obama’s proposed 
cap-and-trade policy to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide.
The recession and financial crisis of 2007–2009 and its aftermath. Today’s students feel 
the effects of the slow recovery from the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression 
of the 1930s. The problems in the financial system in the United States and the euro zone 
have proven that it is important for students in both microeconomics and macroeconomics 
courses to understand the basics of how financial markets work and the role of government 
in financial regulation. In Chapter 8, “Firms, the Stock Market, and Corporate Governance,” 
we cover the basics of the stock and bond markets, discuss why stock prices fluctuate, and 
examine the role of the principal–agent problem in the financial meltdown of 2007–2009. 
Chapter 24, “Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply Analysis,” covers the origins of the 
recession and includes a new discussion of how long it takes the economy to return to poten-
tial GDP. The housing bust and subprime crisis are discussed in Chapter 25, “Money, Banks, 
and the Federal Reserve System,” and Chapter 26,”Monetary Policy.”
New initiatives by the Federal Reserve. During 2008, the Fed dramatically broke with prec-
edent by setting up a number of new “lending facilities” and by participating in actions such 
as the purchase of Bear Stearns by JPMorgan Chase. In this new edition, we provide stu-
dents with a basic background on investment banks and the process of securitization; the 
mortgage-backed securities market, including the roles of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac; and 
the debate among economists concerning the Fed’s two rounds of quantitative easing and 
“Operation Twist.”
Real-world company examples and newspaper articles. As in previous editions, we open 
each chapter by highlighting a company to establish a real-world context for learning and 
to spark students’ interest in economics. We have chosen new companies for some chapters 
and updated the information in the other chapters. As in previous editions, each chapter 
closes with the An Inside Look feature, which shows students how to apply the concepts from 
the chapter to the analysis of a news article. We have replaced all the An Inside Look features 
in this edition. Here is a snapshot of some of these changes:
Chapter 3, “Where Prices Come From: The Interaction of Demand and Supply,” 
opens with a discussion of the iPad and the tablet reader revolution. The An Inside 
Look feature presents an article and analysis of how a shortage of display screens 
could affect the sale of tablet readers.

Chapter 7, “The Economics of Health Care,” opens with a discussion of the rising 
health care costs for small businesses. The An Inside Look feature presents an article 
and analysis of health care spending and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care 
Act of 2010.
Chapter 8, “Firms, the Stock Market, and Corporate Governance,” opens with a discus-
sion of the runaway success of the private company Facebook and how some of the 
company’s stock is available for sale in private markets. An Inside Look features Internet 
companies that allow qualified investors a chance to buy stock in private companies.
Chapter 10, “Consumer Choice and Behavioral Economics,” opens with a discussion 
of how aging rock star Ozzy Osbourne and teenage singing sensation Justin Bieber 
endorsed Best Buy’s new electronics program. The An Inside Look feature presents 
an article and analysis of how endorsements from celebrities ranging from Jennifer 
Lopez to Charlie Sheen can help or hurt a brand.
Chapter 19, “GDP: Measuring Total Production and Income,” opens with a discus-
sion of Ford Motor Company’s performance following the 2007–2009 recession. The 
An Inside Look feature presents an analysis of how uncertain economic conditions in 
2011 and 2012 kept demand for automobiles below initial sales estimates
Chapter 26, “Monetary Policy,” opens with a discussion of homebuilder Toll Brothers. 
The An Inside Look feature presents an analysis of the effects of “Operation Twist,” 
the Federal Reserve’s attempt to boost the economy in late 2011 by stimulating the 
sluggish housing market.

 • Figures and tables have been updated using the latest data available.
 • Many of the end-of-chapter problems have been either replaced or updated.
 • Finally, we have gone over the text literally line-by-line, tightening the discussion, re-
writing unclear points, and making many other small changes. We are grateful to the 
many instructors and students who made suggestions for improvements in the previous 
edition. We have done our best to incorporate as many of those suggestions as possible.
The Foundation: 
Contextual Learning and Modern Organization
We believe a course is a success if students can apply what they have learned in both personal 
and business settings and if they have developed the analytical skills to understand what 
they read in the media. That’s why we explain economic concepts by using many real-world 
business examples and applications in the chapter openers, graphs, Making the Connection 
features, An Inside Look features, and end-of-chapter problems. This approach helps both 
business majors and liberal arts majors become educated consumers, voters, and citizens. In 

 
P R E FAC E  
xxxiii
addition to our widget-free approach, we also have a modern organization and place inter-
esting policy topics early in the book to pique student interest.
Microeconomics
We are convinced that students learn to apply economic principles best if they are taught in 
a familiar context. Whether they open an art studio, do social work, trade on Wall Street, 
work for the government, or tend bar, students benefit from understanding the economic 
forces behind their work. And though business students will have many opportunities to see 
economic principles in action in various courses, liberal arts students may not. We therefore 
use many diverse real-world business and policy examples to illustrate economic concepts 
and to develop educated consumers, voters, and citizens:
 • A strong set of introductory chapters. The introductory chapters provide students 
with a solid foundation in the basics. We emphasize the key ideas of marginal analysis 
and economic efficiency. In Chapter 4, “Economic Efficiency, Government Price Set-
ting, and Taxes,” we use the concepts of consumer surplus and producer surplus to mea-
sure the economic effects of price ceilings and price floors as they relate to the  familiar 
examples of rental properties and the minimum wage. (We revisit consumer surplus 
and producer surplus in Chapter 9, “Comparative Advantage and the Gains from  
International Trade,” where we discuss outsourcing and analyze government policies 
that affect trade; in Chapter 15, “Monopoly and Antitrust Policy,” where we examine 
the effect of market power on economic efficiency; and in Chapter 16, “Pricing Strat-
egy,” where we examine the effect of firm pricing policy on economic efficiency.) In 
 Chapter 8, “Firms, the Stock Market, and Corporate Governance,” we provide students 
with a basic understanding of how firms are organized, how they raise funds, and 
how they provide information to investors. We also illustrate how in a market system 
 entrepreneurs meet consumer wants and efficiently organize production.
 • Early coverage of policy issues. To expose students to policy issues early in the course, 
we discuss immigration in Chapter 1, “Economics: Foundations and Models”; rent con-
trol and the minimum wage in Chapter 4, “Economic Efficiency, Government Price Set-
ting, and Taxes”; air pollution, global warming, and whether the government should 
run the health care system in Chapter 5, “Externalities, Environmental Policy, and 
Public Goods”; government policy toward illegal drugs in Chapter 6, “Elasticity: The 
Responsiveness of Demand and Supply”; and health care policy in Chapter 7, “The Eco-
nomics of Health Care.”
 • Complete coverage of monopolistic competition. We devote a full chapter, Chapter 
13, “Monopolistic Competition: The Competitive Model in a More Realistic Setting,” to 
monopolistic competition prior to covering oligopoly and monopoly in Chapter 14, “Oli-
gopoly: Firms in Less Competitive Markets,” and Chapter 15, “Monopoly and Antitrust 
Policy.” Although many instructors cover monopolistic competition very briefly or dis-
pense with it entirely, we think it is an overlooked tool for reinforcing the basic message of 
how markets work in a context that is much more familiar to students than are the agri-
cultural examples that dominate other discussions of perfect competition. We use the mo-
nopolistic competition model to introduce the downward-sloping demand curve material 
usually introduced in a monopoly chapter. This helps students grasp the important point 
that nearly all firms—not just monopolies—face downward-sloping demand curves. Cov-
ering monopolistic competition directly after perfect competition also allows for the early 
discussion of topics such as brand management and sources of competitive success. Nev-
ertheless, we wrote the chapter so that instructors who prefer to cover monopoly (Chap-
ter 15, “Monopoly and Antitrust Policy”) directly after perfect competition (Chapter 12, 
“Firms in Perfectly Competitive Markets”) can do so without loss of continuity.
 • Extensive, realistic game theory coverage. In Chapter 14, “Oligopoly: Firms in Less 
Competitive Markets,” we use game theory to analyze competition among oligopo-
lists. Game theory helps students understand how companies with market power make 

xxxiv 
P R E F A C E
strategic decisions in many competitive situations. We use familiar companies such as 
Apple, Hewlett-Packard, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, and Dell in our game theory applications.
 • Unique coverage of pricing strategy. In Chapter 16, “Pricing Strategy,” we explore 
how firms use pricing strategies to increase profits. Students encounter pricing strat-
egies everywhere—when they buy a movie ticket, book a flight for spring break, or 
research book prices online. We use these relevant, familiar examples to illustrate how 
companies use strategies such as price discrimination, cost-plus pricing, and two-part 
tariffs.
Macroeconomics
Students come to study macroeconomics with a strong interest in understanding events and 
developments in the economy. We try to capture that interest and develop students’ eco-
nomic intuition and understanding in this text. We present macroeconomics in a way that 
is modern and based in the real world of business and economic policy. And we believe we 
achieve this presentation without making the analysis more difficult. We avoid the recent 
trend of using simplified versions of intermediate models, which are often more detailed and 
more complex than what students need to understand the basic macroeconomic issues. In-
stead, we use a more realistic version of the familiar aggregate demand and aggregate supply 
model to analyze short-run fluctuations and monetary and fiscal policy. We also avoid the 
“dueling schools of thought” approach often used to teach macroeconomics at the principles 
level. We emphasize the many areas of macroeconomics where most economists agree. And 
we present throughout real business and policy situations to develop students’ intuition. 
Here are a few highlights of our approach to macroeconomics:
 • A broad discussion of macro statistics. Many students pay at least some attention to 
the financial news and know that the release of statistics by federal agencies can cause 
movements in stock and bond prices. A background in macroeconomic statistics helps 
clarify some of the policy issues encountered in later chapters. In Chapter 19, “GDP: 
Measuring Total Production and Income,” and Chapter 20, “Unemployment and Infla-
tion,” we provide students with an understanding of the uses and potential shortcomings 
of the key macroeconomic statistics, without getting bogged down in the minutiae of 
how the statistics are constructed. So, for instance, we discuss the important differences 
between the payroll survey and the household survey for understanding conditions in 
the labor market. We explain why financial markets react more strongly to news from 
the payroll survey. New to this edition is a discussion of the employment–population 
ratio, which some economists regard as a key measure of labor market performance. 
Chapter 26, “Monetary Policy,” discusses why the Federal Reserve prefers to measure 
inflation using the personal consumption expenditures price index rather than the con-
sumer price index.
 • Early coverage of long-run topics. We place key macroeconomic issues in their long-
run context in Chapter 21, “Economic Growth, the Financial System, and Business 
Cycles,” and Chapter 22, “Long-Run Economic Growth: Sources and Policies.” Chapter 
21 puts the business cycle in the context of underlying long-run growth and discusses 
what actually happens during the phases of the business cycle. We believe this mate-
rial is important if students are to have the understanding of business cycles they will 
need to interpret economic events; this material is often discussed only briefly or omit-
ted entirely in other books. We know that many instructors prefer to have a short-run 
orientation to their macro courses, with a strong emphasis on policy. Accordingly, we 
have structured Chapter 21 so that its discussion of long-run growth would be suf-
ficient for instructors who want to move quickly to short-run analysis. Chapter 22 
uses a simple neoclassical growth model to explain important growth issues. We apply 
the model to topics such as the decline of the Soviet economy, the surprisingly strong 
growth performance of Botswana, and the failure of many developing countries to sus-
tain high growth rates. And we challenge students with the discussion “Why Isn’t the 
Whole World Rich?”

•
A dynamic model of aggregate demand and aggregate supply. 
We take a fresh approach to the standard aggregate demand and 
aggregate supply (AD–AS) model. We realize there is no good, 
simple alternative to using the AD–AS model when explain-
ing movements in the price level and in real GDP. But we know 
that more instructors are dissatisfied with the AD–AS model 
than with any other aspect of the macro principles course. The 
key problem, of course, is that AD–AS is a static model that at-
tempts to account for dynamic changes in real GDP and the 
price level. Our approach retains the basics of the AD–AS model 
but makes it more accurate and useful by making it more dy-
namic. We emphasize two points: First, changes in the position 
of the short-run (upward-sloping) aggregate supply curve de-
pend mainly on the state of expectations of the inflation rate. 
Second, the existence of growth in the economy means that the 
long-run (vertical) aggregate supply curve shifts to the right ev-
ery year. This “dynamic” AD–AS model provides students with 
a more accurate understanding of the causes and consequences 
of fluctuations in real GDP and the price level. Chapter 24, “Ag-
gregate Demand and Aggregate Supply Analysis,” includes a 
three-layer, full-color acetate for the key introductory dynamic 
AD–AS graph (Figure 24.8, “A Dynamic Aggregate Demand and 
Aggregate Supply Model,” on page 813 and reproduced on the 
right). We created this acetate to help students see how the graph 
builds step by step and to help make the graph easier for instruc-
tors to present. The acetate will help instructors who want to use 
dynamic AD–AS in class but believe the model needs to be devel-
oped carefully. We introduce this model in Chapter 24 and use 
it to discuss monetary policy in Chapter 26, “Monetary Policy,” 
and fiscal policy in Chapter 27, “Fiscal Policy.” Instructors may 
safely omit the sections on the dynamic AD–AS model without 
any loss in continuity to the discussion of macroeconomic theory 
and policy.
•
Extensive coverage of monetary policy. Because of the central 
role monetary policy plays in the economy and in students’ curi-
osity about business and financial news, we devote 
two chapters—Chapters 26, “Monetary Policy,” and 
28, “Inflation, Unemployment, and Federal Reserve 
Policy”—to the topic. We emphasize the issues in-
volved in the Fed’s choice of monetary policy tar-
gets, and we include coverage of the Taylor rule. 
The fourth edition includes coverage of the Fed’s 
new policies aimed at dealing with the housing cri-
sis and its effects on financial markets.
•
Coverage of both the demand-side and supply-
side effects of fiscal policy. Our discussion of fiscal 
policy in Chapter 27, “Fiscal Policy,” carefully dis-
tinguishes between automatic stabilizers and dis-
cretionary fiscal policy. We also provide significant 
coverage of the supply-side effects of fiscal policy.
•
A self-contained but thorough discussion of the Keynesian income-expenditure 
approach. The Keynesian income-expenditure approach (the “45°-line diagram,” or 
“Keynesian cross”) is useful for introducing students to the short-run relationship be-
tween spending and production. Many instructors, however, prefer to omit this material.

Therefore, we use the 45°-line diagram only in Chapter 23, “Aggregate Expenditure and 
Output in the Short Run.” The discussion of monetary and fiscal policy in later chapters 
uses only the AD–AS model, making it possible to omit Chapter 23.
 • Extensive international coverage. We include three chapters devoted to international 
topics: Chapter 9, “Comparative Advantage and the Gains from International Trade,” 
Chapter 29, “Macroeconomics in an Open Economy,” and Chapter 30, “The Interna-
tional Financial System.” Having a good understanding of the international trading and 
financial systems is essential to understanding the macroeconomy and to satisfying 
students’ curiosity about the economic world around them. In addition to the material 
in our three international chapters, we weave international comparisons into the nar-
ratives of several other chapters, including our discussion of labor market policies in 
Chapter 28, “Inflation, Unemployment, and Federal Reserve Policy,” and central bank-
ing in Chapter 25, “Money, Banks, and the Federal Reserve System.”
 • Flexible chapter organization. Because we realize that there are a variety of approaches 
to teaching principles of macroeconomics, we have structured our chapters for maxi-
mum flexibility. For example, our discussion of long-run economic growth in Chapter 
21, “Economic Growth, the Financial System, and Business Cycles,” makes it possible for 
instructors to omit the more thorough discussion of these issues in Chapter 22, “Long-
Run Economic Growth: Sources and Policies.” Our discussion of the Keynesian 45°-line 
diagram is confined to Chapter 23 so that instructors who do not use this approach 
can proceed directly to aggregate demand and aggregate supply analysis in Chapter 24, 
“Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply Analysis.” While we devote two chapters to 
monetary policy, the first of these—Chapter 26, “Monetary Policy”—is a self-contained 
discussion, so instructors may safely omit the material in Chapter 28, “Inflation, Unem-
ployment, and Federal Reserve Policy,” if they choose to. Finally, instructors may choose 
to omit all three of the international chapters (Chapter 9, “Comparative Advantage and 
the Gains from International Trade,” Chapter 29, “Macroeconomics in an Open Econ-
omy,” and Chapter 30, “The International Financial System”), cover just Chapter 9 on 
international trade; cover just Chapter 29; or cover Chapter 29 and Chapter 30 while 
omitting Chapter 9. Please refer to the flexibility chart on pages xxvi–xxvii to help select 
the chapters and order best suited to your classroom needs.

developing new products and bringing them to the market. For example, Chapter 3 covers 
Bill Gates of Microsoft and Steve Jobs of Apple, Chapter 8 covers Mark Zuckerberg of Face-
book, and Chapter 24 covers Fred Smith of FedEx. Here are a few examples of companies we 
explore in the chapter openers in this new edition:
 • Apple (Chapter 3, “Where Prices Come From: The Interaction of Demand and Supply”)
 • Facebook (Chapter 8, “Firms, the Stock Market, and Corporate Governance”)
 • FedEx (Chapter 24, “Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply Analysis”)

Although initially Apple had the market 
for new-style tablets largely to itself, competi-
tors appeared rapidly. Toshiba, Samsung, Dell, 
LG, Motorola, Lenovo, Amazon, and ZTE all 
introduced tablets running on Google’s An-
droid operating system. Research in Motion 
(RIM) introduced the BlackBerry Playbook, 
based on its operating system.
The intense competition among firms 
selling the new tablets is a striking example of 
how the market responds to changes in con-
sumer tastes. As many consumers indicated 
that they would buy small tablets, firms scram-
bled to meet the demand for this new product. 
Although intense competition is not always 
good news for firms trying to sell products, 
it is a boon to consumers because it increases 
the available choice of products and lowers the 
prices consumers pay for those products.
AN INSIDE LOOK on page 92 discusses 
how the many tablet producers are concerned 
about component shortages.
Based on Matt Berger and James Niccolai, “Gates 
Unveils Portable Tablet PC,” PC World, November 12, 
2001; Wolfgang Gruener, “240 Million Tablets: The 
Gazillion-Dollar Forecast Game,” www.fool.com, Febru-
ary 6, 2011; David Pogue, “Pretty Tablet, Though Late for 
the Ball,” New York Times, June 29, 2011; and Stu Woo 
and Yukari Iwatani Kane, “Amazon to Battle Apple iPad 
with Tablet,” Wall Street Journal, July 14, 2011.
Bill Gates, who was then chairman of Micro-
soft, made a famous—but wrong!—prediction 
in 2001. At a computer industry trade show, 
he predicted that tablet computers would 
make up a majority of personal computer 
sales within five years. Microsoft had devel-
oped new software that made it possible to use 
a stylus to write on a laptop computer screen, 
and Gates hoped that consumers would re-
spond to compact lightweight computers. But 
many consumers found them  awkward to use 
and thought that the prices, at $2,000 or more, 
were too high. As a result, rather than making 
up a majority of computer sales in 2006, tab-
lets were just 1 percent of the market.
Fast forward to 2010: After years of 
stating that his company would not enter 
the market for netbooks—or lightweight 
computers smaller than laptops—Apple 
CEO Steve Jobs introduced the iPad in 
April. The iPad was an immediate success, 
selling nearly 15 million units by the end of 
the year. The iPad 2, released in early 2011, 
experienced similarly rapid sales.
The iPad was very different from the 
tablet computers that had failed to win favor 
with consumers a few years earlier. The iPad 
was more awkward to use for word process-
ing or working on spreadsheets, but it was 
lighter than earlier tablets, and its wireless 
connectivity and portability made it better 
The Tablet Computer Revolution
Economics in Your Life
Will You Buy an Apple iPad or a Samsung Galaxy Tab?
Suppose you are considering buying a tablet computer and that you are choosing between an Apple 
iPad and a Samsung Galaxy Tab. Apple introduced the iPad in April 2010, and Samsung introduced the 
Galaxy Tab in November 2010; seven months is a long time in the world of high-tech gadgets. Apple 
products have become very fashionable, and if you buy an iPad, you will have access to many more ap-
plications—or “apps”—that can increase the enjoyability and productivity of your tablet. One strategy 
Samsung can use to overcome those advantages is to compete based on price and value. Would you 
choose to buy a Galaxy Tab if it had a lower price than an iPad? If your income increased, would it 
 affect your decision about which tablet to buy? As you read the chapter, see if you can answer these 
questions. You can check your answers against those we provide page 91 at the end of this chapter.

between the haves and have-nots 
among the panel suppliers,” Dash said. 
“Those panel makers that have their 
own internal manufacturing of LEDs 
will have sufficient supply in 2010, 
while those that don’t will encounter 
constraints.”
Tablets aren’t the only things caus-
ing the crunch. The overall popular-
ity of LED-backlit LCD displays in 
televisions and computers could also 
help tighten supply for display compo-
nents. iSuppli said last week that more 
than two-thirds of large LCD panels 
shipped worldwide in 2011 will incor-
porate LED backlights, up from less 
than one-half in 2010. This year, LED 
penetration in television and monitor 
panels will hit almost 50 percent com-
pared with 20 percent last year, while 
LED backlighting in notebooks and 
netbooks is expected to be 100 percent.
With so much competition in the 
coming year, we might not see any 
one tablet place the demands on the 
component supply chain that the iPad 
did. But if the tablet market evolves 
as many are predicting, the race will 
be on to snap up display components 
and fast. Apple is getting ready for the 
tablet revolution and, in doing so, has 
shone a light on the importance of the 
electronics supply chain.

make sense for Apple to lock up the 
necessary components to ensure the 
iPad success story continues.
Tablet competitors may do well to 
follow Apple’s example. Last month, 
Frank Chien, chairman of Formosa 
Epitaxy, a leading Taiwanese LED 
maker, predicted that demand for 
high-end LED chips for LCD displays 
could outstrip supply starting next 
month as tablet production ramps up 
across the industry. ISuppli said ear-
lier this month that global tablet ship-
ments are expected to hit 57.6 million 
units, up from 17.1 million in 2010. 
The overall demand for a relatively 
new product, however, is still form-
ing, said iSuppli. The unpredictability 
of the nascent market could put a lot 
of pressure on display makers, which 
may face shortages or potentially 
oversupply as they try to guess how 
the tablet market performs.
In-House Technology
For those building tablets, the 
challenge may be to make sure they 
have enough display panels to meet 
demand. The best companies might 
be the ones that have access to their 
own display technology, companies 
like Samsung, LG, and Sharp. And 
even among display makers, the best 
positioned manufacturers will be 
those that have the LED-chip technol-
ogy in-house, said Sweta Dash, senior 
director for LCD research at iSuppli in 
a story in LED Magazine last year.
“By the second half of this year 
(2010), a clear distinction will emerge 
Guess What Could 
Stop the Tablet 
Revolution?
With 2011 shaping up to be the Year of 
the Tablet, securing the display com-
ponents for the looming army of tab-
lets may be a key factor in determining 
success. Last year we saw that the fast 
start for the iPad prompted LCD dis-
play shortages from Apple supplier LG, 
which said it was having a hard time 
keeping up with demand. Now with 
Apple (AAPL) selling 7.3 million iPads 
in the December quarter, the iPad 2 on 
the way, and seemingly every manu-
facturer at CES prepping a rival, the 
display component crunch could con-
strain the flow of tablets and hurt some 
manufacturers that aren’t prepared.
The focus on displays may be 
what Apple was referring to when it 
reported last week during its earning 
call that it was investing $3.9 billion to 
secure inventory components through 
three vendors. MacRumors speculated 
that the sum was aimed at shoring up 
Apple’s access to displays, especially 
ahead of the iPad 2 launch. In Decem-
ber, Apple reportedly struck two deals 
with Toshiba (TOSYY) and Sharp 
(SHCAY) to manufacture displays,  
though Sharp denied the report. Apple, 
according to Digitimes, is also secur-
ing iPad display-panel shipments for 
65 million units this year through LG, 
Samsung, and Chimei Innolux. That’s 
a huge number of iPads, and it would

Will Shortage of Display Screens Derail 
Computer Tablet Sales?
AN

Key Points in the Article
The overwhelming success of the iPad in 
2010 resulted in a shortage of screens from 
LG, the main supplier of this component. In 
2011, Apple made arrangements with sev-
eral other suppliers to provide the screens 
for the iPad. The growing popularity of tab-
let computers and the introduction of tab-
lets by an increasing number of firms have 
many of them concerned about the compo-
nent shortages, which has resulted in firms 
scrambling to obtain display screens. iSup-
pli, a market research firm specializing in the 
electronics industry, projected that global 
tablet shipments would increase from 17.1 
million in 2010 to over 57 million in 2011.
Analyzing the News
a Apple is the industry leader in the man-
ufacture and sale of tablet computers. 
In an effort to ensure that it can keep pace 
with demand, Apple has made arrange-
ments with several manufacturers to supply 
display components for the iPad. In addi-
tion to reported deals with Toshiba and 
Sharp to supply display screens, Apple is 
also reported to have secured 65 million 
screens from three additional manufactur-
ers. The market for tablet computers has 
grown tremendously over the past year, 
with an increase in consumers’ taste for the 
product fueling the increase in demand. 
Figure 1 shows that an increase in consum-
ers’ taste for tablet computers will increase 
the demand for them, shifting the demand 
curve to the right. All else equal, the in-
crease in demand increases both the equi-
librium price and the equilibrium quantity of 
tablet computers.
b A few of the firms that produce tablets 
also produce the display screen com-
ponents, and by virtue of producing their 
own displays, these companies may have a 
significant advantage in meeting demand. 
Assuming that these firms will supply dis-
play screens for their own tablets before 
supplying screens to other firms, the other 
firms may find themselves facing a short-
age of screens. The way to eliminate a 
shortage in a market is to raise the selling 
price of the product. The screen manufac-
turers may choose to raise the price of the 
screen component to alleviate the short-
age, but this increase in the input price will 
result in a decrease in the supply of tablet 
computers. Figure 2 shows that the de-
crease in supply of an input causes the 
supply curve to shift to the left. All else 
equal, the decrease in supply increases the 
equilibrium price and decreases the equi-
librium quantity of tablet computers.
c In addition to tablet computers, the 
LED backlight components used in the 
production of LCD display screens are be-
ing used in a growing number of televisions 
and laptop and netbook computers. These 
alternative uses for the display screen com-
ponents could further exacerbate the short-
age of screens for use in tablets. Unless the 
manufacturers are able to increase produc-
tion, firms that produce both tablet com-
puters and other products that use display 
screen components may not be able to 
keep up with the expected increases in 
 demand for their products.
Thinking Critically
1. The article discusses the potential 
shortage of tablet computers due to an 
insufficient number of display screen 
components used in production. Briefly 
explain how any potential shortage will 
be eliminated in the market for tablet 
computers.
2. Suppose the demand for tablet comput-
ers continues to increase and that sup-
pliers of the display screens are not able 
to produce enough components to keep 
up with the increasing demand, and as 
a result, increase the price of each dis-
play screen. Draw a demand and supply 
graph that shows both of these situa-
tions occurring in the market for tablet 
computers. Explain what is happening 
in the graph and the effect these events 
will have on the equilibrium price and 
equilibrium quantity.

Economics in Your Life
After the chapter-opening real-world business case, we have added a personal dimension 
to the chapter opener, with a feature titled Economics in Your Life, which asks students 
to consider how economics affects their own lives. The feature piques the interest of stu-
dents and emphasizes the connection between the material they are learning and their 
own experiences.
At the end of the chapter, we use the chapter concepts to answer the questions asked at 
the beginning of the chapter.
The following are examples of the topics we cover in the Economics in Your Life feature:
 • Will you buy an Apple iPad or a Samsung Galaxy tablet? (Chapter 3, “Where Prices 
Come From: The Interaction of Demand and Supply”)
 • Do corporate managers act in the best interests of shareholders? (Chapter 8, “Firms, the

mand and Aggregate Supply Analysis”)
Economics in Your Life
Will You Buy an Apple iPad or a Samsung Galaxy Tab?
Suppose you are considering buying a tablet computer and that you are choosing between an Apple 
iPad and a Samsung Galaxy Tab. Apple introduced the iPad in April 2010, and Samsung introduced the 
Galaxy Tab in November 2010; seven months is a long time in the world of high-tech gadgets. Apple 
products have become very fashionable, and if you buy an iPad, you will have access to many more ap-
plications—or “apps”—that can increase the enjoyability and productivity of your tablet. One strategy 
Samsung can use to overcome those advantages is to compete based on price and value. Would you 
choose to buy a Galaxy Tab if it had a lower price than an iPad? If your income increased, would it 
 affect your decision about which tablet to buy? As you read the chapter, see if you can answer these 
questions. You can check your answers against those we provide page 91 at the end of this chapter.
Continued from page 69
Economics in Your Life
Will You Buy an Apple iPad or a Samsung Galaxy Tab?
At the beginning of the chapter, we asked you to consider two questions: Would you choose to 
buy a Samsung Galaxy Tab tablet if it had a lower price than an Apple iPad? and Would your deci-
sion be affected if your income increased? To determine the answer to the first question, you have 
to recognize that the iPad and the Galaxy Tab are substitutes. If you consider the two tablets to 
be very close substitutes, then you are likely to buy the one with the lower price. In the market, if 
consumers generally believe that iPad and the Galaxy Tab are close substitutes, a fall in the price of 
the iPad will increase the quantity of iPads demanded and decrease the demand for Galaxy Tabs. 
Suppose that you are currently leaning toward buying the Galaxy Tab because its price is lower 
than the price of the iPad. If an increase in your income would cause you to change your decision 
and buy the iPad, then the Galaxy Tab is an inferior good for you.

Solved Problems
Many students have great difficulty handling applied economics problems. We help students 
overcome this hurdle by including two or three worked-out problems tied to select chapter-
opening learning objectives. Our goals are to keep students focused on the main ideas of 
each chapter and to give students a model of how to solve an economic problem by breaking 
it down step by step. Additional exercises in the end-of-chapter Problems and Applications 
section are tied to every Solved Problem. Additional Solved Problems appear in the Instruc-
tor’s Manuals and the print Study Guides. In addition, the Test Item Files include problems

Whether the price of a product rises or falls over time depends on whether de-
mand shifts to the right more than supply.
In panel (a), demand shifts to the right more than supply, and the equilibrium 
price rises:
1. Demand shifts to the right more than supply.
2. The equilibrium price rises from P1 to P2.
In panel (b), supply shifts to the right more than demand, and the equilibrium 
price falls:
1. Supply shifts to the right more than demand.
2. The equilibrium price falls from P1 to P2.

Solved Problem 3.4
High Demand and Low Prices  
in the Lobster Market?
During a typical spring, when demand for lobster is rela-
tively low, Maine lobstermen can typically sell their lobster 
catches for about $6.00 per pound. During the summer, 
when demand for lobster is much higher, Maine lobstermen 
can typically sell their lobster catches for only about $3.00 
per pound. One recent July, a lobster-boat captain noted, 
“Per pound, it’s less expensive than hot dogs right now.” It 
may seem strange that the market price is higher when de-
mand is low than when demand is high. Resolve this para-
dox, with the help of a demand and supply graph.
Solving the Problem
Step 1: Review the chapter material. This problem is about how shifts in demand 
and supply curves affect the equilibrium price, so you may want to review the 
section “The Effect of Shifts in Demand and Supply over Time,” which begins 
on page 87.
Step 2: Draw the demand and supply graph. Draw a demand and supply graph, 
showing the market equilibrium in the spring. Label the equilibrium price 
$6.00. Label both the demand and supply curves “in spring.”
Supply
in spring
Demand
in spring
Price
(dollars
per pound)
Quantity
(pounds of lobster)
$6.00
0
Step 4: Explain the graph. After studying the graph, it is possible to see how the 
equilibrium price can fall from $6.00 to $3.00, despite the increase in de-
mand: The supply curve must have shifted to the right by enough to cause 
the equilibrium price to fall to $3.00. Draw the new supply curve, label it “in 
summer,” and label the new equilibrium price $3.00. The demand for lobster 
does increase in summer compared with spring. But the increase in the sup-
ply of lobster between spring and summer is even greater. So, the equilibrium 
price falls.
Step 3: Add to your graph a demand curve for summer.

Don’t Let This Happen to You
We know from many years of teaching which concepts stu-
dents find most difficult. Each chapter contains a box feature 
called Don’t Let This Happen to You that alerts students to 
the most common pitfalls in that chapter’s material. We fol-
low up with a related question in the end-of-chapter Prob-
lems and Applications section.
Making the Connection
Each chapter includes two to four Making the Connection 
features that provide real-world reinforcement of key con-
cepts and help students learn how to interpret what they read 
on the Web and in newspapers. Most Making the Connection 
features use relevant, stimulating, and provocative news sto-
ries focused on businesses and policy issues. One-third of 
the Making the Connection features are new to this edition, 
and most others have been updated. Several Making the Con-
nection features discuss health care, which remains a press-
ing policy issue. Each Making the Connection has at least one 
supporting end-of-chapter problem to allow students to test 
Remember: A Change in a Good’s Price 
Does Not Cause the Demand or Supply 
Curve to Shift
Suppose a student is asked to draw a demand and supply 
graph to illustrate how an increase in the price of oranges 
would affect the market for apples, other variables being 
constant. He draws the graph on the left below and explains 
it as follows: “Because apples and oranges are substitutes, 
an increase in the price of oranges will cause an initial shift 
to the right in the demand curve for apples, from D1 to D2. 
However, because this initial shift in the demand curve for 
apples results in a higher price for apples, P2, consumers will 
find apples less desirable, and the demand curve will shift to 
the left, from D2 to D3, resulting in a final equilibrium price 
of P3.” Do you agree or disagree with the student’s analysis?
You should disagree. The student has correctly under-
stood that an increase in the price of oranges will cause the 
demand curve for apples to shift to the right. But the second 
demand curve shift the student describes, from D2 to D3, will 
not take place. Changes in the price of a product do not result 
in shifts in the product’s demand curve. Changes in the price 
of a product result only in movements along a demand curve.
The graph on the right below shows the correct analy-
sis. The increase in the price of oranges causes the demand 
curve for apples to increase from D1 to D2. At the origi-
nal price, P1, the increase in demand initially results in a 
shortage of apples equal to Q3 − Q1. But, as we have seen, 
a shortage causes the price to increase until the shortage 
is eliminated. In this case, the price will rise to P2, where 
the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied are both 
equal to Q2. Notice that the increase in price causes a de-
crease in the quantity demanded, from Q3 to Q2, but does 
not cause a decrease in demand.

A Change in Demand versus a

If the price of tablet computers falls from 
$700 to $600, the result will be a movement 
along the demand curve from point A to 
point B—an increase in quantity demanded 
from 3 million tablets to 4 million tablets. If 
consumers’ incomes increase, or if another 
factor changes that makes consumers want 
more of the product at every price, the de-
mand curve will shift to the right—an in-
crease in demand. In this case, the increase 
in demand from D1 to D2 causes the quantity 
of tablet computers demanded at a price of 
$700 to increase from 3 million tablets at 
point A to 5 million tablets at point C.
Forecasting the Demand for iPads
One of the most important decisions that the managers of 
any large firm face is which new products to develop. A firm 
must devote people, time, and money 
to designing a new product, negotiating 
with suppliers, formulating a marketing campaign, and many 
other tasks. But any firm has only limited resources and so faces 
a trade-off: Resources used to develop one product will not be 
available to develop another product. Ultimately, the products a 
firm chooses to develop will be those that it believes will be the 
most profitable. So, to decide which products to develop, firms 
need to forecast the demand for those products.
We saw at the beginning of the chapter that in 2001, Bill Gates 
predicted that within five years, a majority of computers sold 
would be tablets. If Gates had been correct about the way the com-
puter market was changing, then any computer firm that didn’t de-
velop a tablet would have run the risk of being left behind. David 
Sobotta, who worked at Apple for 20 years and eventually became 
its national sales manager, has described discussions at Apple dur-
ing 2002 about whether to develop a tablet. According to Sobotta, representatives of 
the federal government’s National Institutes of Health urged Apple to develop a tablet 
computer, arguing that it would be particularly useful to doctors, nurses, and hospitals. 
Apple’s managers decided not to develop a tablet, however, because they believed the 
technology available at that time was too complex for the average computer user and they 
also believed that the demand from doctors and nurses would be small. As we saw in 
the chapter opener, Apple’s forecast was correct. Despite Bill Gates’s prediction, in 2006,

Review Questions and Problems and Applications—
Grouped by Learning Objective to Improve  
Assessment
All the end-of-chapter material—Summary, Review Questions, and Problems and 
 Applications—is grouped under learning objectives. The goals of this organization are to 
make it easier for instructors to assign problems based on learning objectives, both in the 
book and in MyEconLab, and to help students efficiently review material that they find dif-
ficult. If students have difficulty with a particular learning objective, an instructor can eas-
ily identify which end-of-chapter questions and problems support that objective and assign 
them as homework or discuss them in class. Every exercise in a chapter’s Problems and Ap-
plications section is available in MyEconLab. Using MyEconLab, students can complete these 
and many other exercises online, get tutorial help, and receive instant feedback and assis-
tance on exercises they answer incorrectly. Also, student learning will be enhanced by hav-
ing the summary material and problems grouped together by learning objective, which will 
allow students to focus on the parts of the chapter they found most challenging. Each major 
section of the chapter, paired with a learning objective, has at least two review questions and 
three problems.
As in the previous editions, we include one or more end-of-chapter problems that test 
students’ understanding of the content presented in the Solved Problem, Making the Connec-
tion, and Don’t Let This Happen to You special features in the chapter. Instructors can cover 
a feature in class and assign the corresponding problem for homework. The Test Item Files 
also include test questions that pertain to these special features.

•  Single-player experiments allow your students to play against virtual players from 
 anywhere at anytime so long as they have an Internet connection. 
 
•  Multiplayer experiments allow you to assign and manage a real-time experiment 
with your class. 
 
•  Pre- and post-questions for each experiment are available for assignment in 
MyEconLab. 
For a complete list of available experiments, visit www.myeconlab.com
 • Test Item File questions that allow you to assign quizzes or homework that will look just 
like your exams
 • Econ Exercise Builder, which allows you to build your own customized exercises
Exercises include multiple-choice, graph drawing, and free-response items, many of 
which are generated algorithmically so that each time a student works them, a different 
 variation is presented.
MyEconLab grades every problem type except essays, even problems with graphs. When 
working homework exercises, students receive immediate feedback, with links to  additional 
learning tools.
Customization and Communication
MyEconLab in MyLab/Mastering provides additional optional customization and commu-
nication tools. Instructors who teach distance-learning courses or very large lecture  sections 
find the MyLab/Mastering format useful because they can upload course documents and 
 assignments, customize the order of chapters, and use communication features such as 
 Document Sharing, Chat, ClassLive, and Discussion Board.

For the Student
MyEconLab puts students in control of their learning through a collection of testing, prac-
tice, and study tools tied to the online, interactive version of the textbook and other media 
resources. Here is a snapshot of what students are saying about MyEconLab:
  “It was very useful because it had EVERYTHING, from practice exams to exercises to 
reading. Very helpful.”—student, Northern Illinois University
  “I would recommend taking the quizzes on MyEconLab because it gives you a true ac-
count of whether or not you understand the material.”—student, Montana Tech
  “It made me look through the book to find answers, so I did more reading.”—student, 
Northern Illinois University
Students can study on their own, or they can complete assignments created by their in-
structor. In MyEconLab’s structured environment, students practice what they learn, test their 
understanding, and pursue a per-
sonalized study plan generated from 
their performance on sample tests 
and from quizzes created by their 
instructors. In Homework or Study 
Plan mode, students have access to a 
wealth of tutorial features, including:
 • Instant feedback on exercises 
that helps students understand 
and apply the concepts
 • Links to the eText to promote 
reading of the text just when 
the student needs to revisit a 
concept or an explanation
 • Step-by-step guided solutions 
that force students to break down 
a problem in much the same way 
an instructor would do during 
office hours
 • Pop-up summaries of the ap-
propriate learning objective to 
remind students of key ideas 
while studying

xliv 
P R E F A C E
 • Pop-up key term definitions 
from the eText to help stu-
dents master the  vocabulary 
of economics
 • Links to the important fea-
tures of the eText, such as 
Solved Problem, Making the 
Connection, An Inside Look, 
and Don’t Let This Happen 
to You
 • A graphing tool that is inte-
grated into the various exer-
cises to enable students to build 
and manipulate graphs to bet-
ter understand how concepts, 
numbers, and graphs connect
Additional MyEconLab Tools
MyEconLab includes the following additional features:
 • eText—In addition to the portions of eText available as pop-ups or links, a fully searchable 
eText is available for students who wish to read and study in a fully electronic environment.
 • Print upgrade—For students who wish to complete assignments in MyEconLab but 
read in print, Pearson offers registered MyEconLab users a loose-leaf version of the 
print text at a significant discount.
 • Glossary flashcards—Every key term is available as a flashcard, allowing students to 
quiz themselves on vocabulary from one or more chapters at a time.
 • MySearchLab—Research MySearchLab provides  extensive help on the research pro-
cess and four exclusive databases of credible and  reliable source material, including the 
New York Times, the Financial Times, and peer-reviewed journals.
MyEconLab content has been created through the efforts of Chris Annala, State 
 University of New York–Geneseo; Charles Baum, Middle Tennessee State University; Carol 
Dole, Jacksonville University; Sarah Ghosh, University of Scranton; Satyajit Ghosh, Universtity 
of Scranton; Melissa Honig, Pearson Education; Woo Jung, University of Colorado; Court-

Other Resources for the Instructor
Instructor’s Manuals
Edward Scahill of the University of Scranton prepared the Instructor’s Manual for Micro-
economics and for Macroeconomics. The Instructor’s Manuals include chapter-by-chapter 
summaries, learning objectives, extended examples and class exercises, teaching outlines in-
corporating key terms and definitions, teaching tips, topics for class discussion, new Solved 
Problems, new Making the Connection features, new Economics in Your Life scenarios, and 
 solutions to all review questions and problems in the book. The Instructor’s Manuals are avail-
able in print and for download from the Instructor’s Resource Center (www.pearsonhighered.
com/hubbard). The authors, Harry Ellis of the University of North Texas, and Robert Gillette 
of the University of Kentucky prepared the solutions to the end-of-chapter review questions 
and problems.

Four Test Item Files
Randy Methenitis of Richland College prepared two Test Item Files for Microeconomics and 
two Test Item Files for Macroeconomics. Each Test Item File includes 2,000 multiple-choice, 
true/false, short-answer, and graphing questions. There are questions to support each key 
feature in the book. The Test Item Files are available in print and for download from the 
Instructor’s Resource Center (www.pearsonhighered.com/hubbard). Test questions are an-
notated with the following information:
 • Difficulty: 1 for straight recall, 2 for some analysis, 3 for complex analysis
 • Type: multiple-choice, true/false, short-answer, essay
 • Topic: the term or concept the question supports
 • Learning outcome
 • AACSB (see description that follows)
 • Page number
 • Special feature in the main book: chapter-opening business example, Economics 
in Your Life, Solved Problem, Making the Connection, Don’t Let This Happen to You, and 
An Inside Look
The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB)
The Test Item File author has connected select questions to the general knowledge and skill 
guidelines found in the AACSB Assurance of Learning Standards.
What Is the AACSB?
AACSB is a not-for-profit corporation of educational institutions, corporations, and other 
organizations devoted to the promotion and improvement of higher education in business 
administration and accounting. A collegiate institution offering degrees in business admin-
istration or accounting may volunteer for AACSB accreditation review. The AACSB makes 
initial accreditation decisions and conducts periodic reviews to promote continuous qual-
ity improvement in management education. Pearson Education is a proud member of the 
AACSB and is pleased to provide advice to help you apply AACSB Assurance of Learning 
Standards.
What Are AACSB Assurance of Learning Standards?
One of the criteria for AACSB accreditation is the quality of curricula. Although no specific 
courses are required, the AACSB expects a curriculum to include learning experiences in the 
following categories of Assurance of Learning Standards:
 • Communication
 • Ethical Reasoning
 • Analytic Skills
 • Use of Information Technology
 • Multicultural and Diversity
 • Reflective Thinking
Questions that test skills relevant to these standards are tagged with the appropriate 
standard. For example, a question testing the moral questions associated with externalities 
would receive the Ethical Reasoning tag.
How Can Instructors Use the AACSB Tags?
Tagged questions help you measure whether students are grasping the course content that 
aligns with the AACSB guidelines noted above. This in turn may suggest enrichment activi-
ties or other educational experiences to help students achieve these skills.

P R E F A C E
TestGen
The computerized TestGen package allows instructors to customize, save, and generate class-
room tests. The test program permits instructors to edit, add, or delete questions from the 
Test Item Files; analyze test results; and organize a database of tests and student results. This 
software allows for extensive flexibility and ease of use. It provides many options for organiz-
ing and displaying tests, along with search and sort features. The software and the Test Item 
Files can be downloaded from the Instructor’s Resource Center (www.pearsonhighered.com/
hubbard).
PowerPoint Lecture Presentation
Three sets of PowerPoint slides, prepared by Fernando Quijano, Dickinson State University, 
are available:
 1. A comprehensive set of PowerPoint slides can be used by instructors for class presenta-
tions or by students for lecture preview or review. These slides include all the graphs, 
tables, and equations in the textbook. Two versions are available—step-by-step mode, 
in which you can build graphs as you would on a blackboard, and automated mode, in 
which you use a single click per slide.
 2. A comprehensive set of PowerPoint slides have Classroom Response Systems (CRS) 
questions built in so that instructors can incorporate CRS “clickers” into their classroom 
lectures. For more information on Pearson Education’s partnership with CRS, see the 
description below. Instructors can download these PowerPoint presentations from the 
Instructor’s Resource Center (www.pearsonhighered.com/hubbard).
 3. A student version of the PowerPoint slides is available as .pdf files. This version allows 
students to print the slides and bring them to class for note taking. Instructors can 
download these PowerPoint presentations from the Instructor’s Resource Center  
(www.pearsonhighered.com/hubbard).
Instructor’s Resource Disk
The Instructor’s Resource Disk contains all the faculty and student resources that support 
this text. Instructors can access and edit the Instructor’s Manuals, Test Item Files, TestGen 
files, and PowerPoint presentations. By simply clicking a chapter, faculty can access an inter-
active library of resources. They can then pick and choose from the various supplements and 
export them to their hard drives.
Classroom Response Systems
Classroom Response Systems (CRS) is an exciting new wireless polling technology that in-
creases the interactivity of large and small classrooms by enabling instructors to pose ques-
tions to their students, record results, and display the results instantly. Students can answer 
questions easily, using compact remote-control transmitters. Pearson Education has partner-
ships with leading CRS providers and can show you everything you need to know about set-
ting up and using CRS. Pearson Education will provide the classroom hardware, text-specific 
PowerPoint slides, software, and support, and will also show you how your students can ben-
efit! Please contact your local Pearson Education sales representative for more information.

A Word of Thanks
Once again, we benefited greatly from the dedication and professionalism of the Pearson 
Economics team. Executive Editor David Alexander’s energy and support were indispens-
able. David helped mold the presentation and provided words of encouragement whenever 
our energy flagged. Executive Development Editor Lena Buonanno worked tirelessly to 
 ensure that this text was as good as it could be and to coordinate the many moving parts 
involved in a project of this magnitude. This new edition posed particular challenges, and 
we remain astonished at the amount of time, energy, and unfailing good humor she brings to 
this project. As we worked on the first edition, Director of Key Markets David Theisen pro-
vided invaluable insight into how best to structure a principles text. His advice helped shape 
nearly every chapter. We have worked with Executive Marketing Manager Lori DeShazo on 
three different books: principles of economics, money and banking, and intermediate mac-
roeconomics, and we continue to be amazed at her energy and creativity in promoting the 
field of economics. Steve Deitmer, Director of Development, brought sound judgment to 
the many decisions required to create this book. Alison Eusden and Lindsey Sloan managed 
the extensive supplement package that accompanies the book. Carla Thompson, Kristin Ru-
scetta, and Jonathan Boylan turned our manuscript pages into a beautiful published book. 
We received excellent research assistance from Ed Timmons, Matthew Saboe, David Van 
Der Goes, and Jason Hockenberry. We thank Pam Smith, Elena Zeller, and Jennifer Brails-
ford for their careful proofreading of first- and second-round page proofs.
A good part of the burden of a project of this magnitude is borne by our families. We 
appreciate the patience, support, and encouragement of our wives and children.

Congress in 2010 and is being gradually 
phased in through 2014. The package will 
result in major changes in how some people 
will receive health insurance and how doc-
tors will be compensated. Policymakers are 
also considering changes to Medicare, the 
federal government program that provides 
health care to people over age 65, because 
the costs of the program have been rising 
very rapidly. Over time, these changes have 
increased the amount of paperwork doctors 
must complete in order to be paid for treat-
ing patients. This paperwork has raised the 
costs doctors incur in running their prac-
tices, which makes becoming a salaried em-
ployee of a hospital more attractive.
Throughout this book, we will see that 
many policy issues, including changes in the 
U.S. medical system, involve economics. In 
fact, knowledge of economics can help you 
to better understand and analyze many pol-
icy issues.
AN INSIDE LOOK on page 20 discusses 
how health professionals may be delay-
ing retirement because they are concerned 
about their finances.
Based on Robert Kocher, M.D., and Nikhil R. Sahni, “Hos-
pitals’ Race to Employ Physicians—The Logic Behind a 
Money-Losing Proposition,” New England Journal of Medi-
cine, May 12, 2011; and Uwe E. Reinhardt, “Producing More 
Primary-Care Doctors,” New York Times, June 10, 2011.
When you visit a doctor’s office, you probably 
don’t think of it as a small business, but that’s 
what it is. Like other businesspeople, a doctor 
hires workers—nurses, physician’s assistants, 
and receptionists—and buys or rents machin-
ery and equipment. A doctor’s income repre-
sents the profits from his or her practice, or 
the difference between the revenue received 
from patients and their health insurance 
plans and the costs to the doctor of wages, 
rent, loans, and insurance. For many years, 
the typical doctor operated his or her prac-
tice either alone or in partnership with other 
doctors. Lately, though, an increasing number 
of doctors have given up their practices and 
become salaried employees of hospitals. Al-
though as recently as 2002 more than three 
times as many medical practices were owned 
by doctors as by hospitals, by 2008 more 
medical practices were owned by hospitals.
The movement of many doctors from 
running their own businesses to being sala-
ried employees of hospitals is due to changes 
occurring within the U.S. health care sys-
tem. Soaring health care costs have led many 
private health care insurers, as well as the 
federal and state governments, to reduce the 
payments they make to doctors in return for 
treating patients. President Barack Obama’s 
package of health care changes, sometimes 
referred to as “Obamacare,” was passed by 
Why Are Some Doctors Leaving Private 
Practice?
Economics in Your Life
Will There Be Plenty of Jobs Available in the Health Care Industry?
The U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) forecasts that the number of doctors in 
the United States will increase from about 808,000 in 2010 to 866,400 in 2020. But the HRSA also fore-
casts that the number of doctors needed to provide patient care will rise from about 805,000 in 2010 to 
922,000 in 2020. In other words, this federal government agency forecasts that there will be a shortage 
of about 56,000 doctors in 2020. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that four of the six fast-
est growing occupations over the next 10 years will be in the medical field. It would seem that plenty 
of jobs should be available in health care during the next few years. But the availability of these jobs 
depends on the reliability of the forecasts. What is the basis for the forecasts on the availability of jobs 
in health care, and how reliable are the forecasts? As you read this chapter, see if you can answer this 
question. You can check your answer against the one we provide on page 18 at the end of this chapter.

C H A P T E R  1  Economics: Foundations and Models 
I
n this book, we use economics to answer questions such as the following:
• 
How are the prices of goods and services determined?
• 
How does pollution affect the economy, and how should government policy deal 
with these effects?
• 
Why do firms engage in international trade, and how do government policies af-
fect  international trade?
• 
Why does government control the prices of some goods and services, and what 
are the effects of those controls?
Economists do not always agree on the answers to every question. In fact, as we will see, 
economists engage in lively debate on some issues. In addition, new problems and issues are 
constantly arising. So, economists are always at work developing new methods to analyze 
economic questions.
All the issues we discuss in this book illustrate a basic fact of life: People must make 
choices as they try to attain their goals. We must make choices because we live in a world 
of scarcity, which means that although our wants are unlimited, the resources available 
to fulfill those wants are limited. You might like to own a BMW and spend each sum-
mer in five-star European hotels, but unless Bill Gates is a close and generous relative, 
you probably lack the money to fulfill these dreams. Every day, you make choices as you 
spend your limited income on the many goods and services available. The finite amount 
of time you have also limits your ability to attain your goals. If you spend an hour study-
ing for your economics midterm, you have one hour less to study for your history mid-
term. Firms and the government are in the same situation as you: They also must attain 
their goals with limited resources. Economics is the study of the choices consumers, 
business managers, and government officials make to attain their goals, given their scarce 
resources.
We begin this chapter by discussing three important economic ideas that we will return 
to many times in this book: People are rational, people respond to incentives, and optimal 
decisions are made at the margin. Then we consider the three fundamental questions that 
any economy must answer: What goods and services will be produced? How will the goods 
and services be produced? and Who will receive the goods and services produced? Next, we 
consider the role of economic models in analyzing economic issues. Economic models are 
simplified versions of reality used to analyze real-world economic situations. We will explore 
why economists use models and how they construct them. Finally, we will discuss the differ-
ence between microeconomics and macroeconomics, and we will preview some important 
economic terms.
Three Key Economic Ideas
As you try to achieve your goals, whether they involve buying a new computer or find-
ing a part-time job, you will interact with other people in markets. A market is a group 
of buyers and sellers of a good or service and the institution or arrangement by which 
they come together to trade. Most of economics involves analyzing what happens in 
markets. Throughout this book, as we study how people make choices and interact in 
markets, we will return to three important ideas:
 1. People are rational.
 2. People respond to economic incentives.
 3. Optimal decisions are made at the margin.
Scarcity A situation in which 
unlimited wants exceed the limited 
resources available to fulfill those 
wants.
Economics The study of the choices 
people make to attain their goals, 
given their scarce resources.
Economic model A simplified 
version of reality used to analyze  
real-world economic situations.
1.1 LEARNING OBJECTIVE
Explain these three key 
economic ideas: People are 
rational, people respond 
to incentives, and optimal 
decisions are made at the 
margin.
Market A group of buyers and 
sellers of a good or service and the 
institution or arrangement by which 
they come together to trade.

 
Three Key Economic Ideas 
5
People Are Rational
Economists generally assume that people are rational. This assumption does not 
mean that economists believe everyone knows everything or always makes the “best” 
decision. It means that economists assume that consumers and firms use all avail-
able information as they act to achieve their goals. Rational individuals weigh the 
benefits and costs of each action, and they choose an action only if the benefits out-
weigh the costs. For example, if Microsoft charges a price of $239 for a copy of Win-
dows, economists assume that the managers at Microsoft have estimated that a price 
of $239 will earn Microsoft the most profit. The managers may be wrong; perhaps a 
price of $265 would be more profitable, but economists assume that the managers at 
Microsoft have acted rationally, on the basis of the information available to them, in 
choosing the price. Of course, not everyone behaves rationally all the time. Still, the 
assumption of rational behavior is very useful in explaining most of the choices that 
people make.
People Respond to Economic Incentives
Human beings act from a variety of motives, including religious belief, envy, and 
 compassion. Economists emphasize that consumers and firms consistently respond to 
economic incentives. This fact may seem obvious, but it is often overlooked. For exam-
ple, according to an article in the Wall Street Journal, the FBI couldn’t understand why 
banks were not taking steps to improve security in the face of an increase in robberies: 
“FBI officials suggest that banks place uniformed, armed guards outside their doors 
and install bullet-resistant plastic, known as a ‘bandit barrier,’ in front of teller win-
dows.” FBI officials were surprised that few banks took their advice. But the article also 
reported that installing bullet-resistant plastic costs $10,000 to $20,000, and a well-
trained security guard receives $50,000 per year in salary and benefits. The average loss 
in a bank robbery is only about $1,200. The economic incentive to banks is clear: It is 
less costly to put up with bank robberies than to take additional security measures. FBI 
agents may be surprised by how banks respond to the threat of robberies—but econo-
mists are not.
In each chapter, the Making the Connection feature discusses a news story or another 
application related to the chapter material. Read the following Making the  Connection 
for a discussion of whether people respond to economic incentives even when deciding 
how much to eat and how much exercise to undertake.
Does Health Insurance Give People 
an Incentive to Become Obese?
Obesity is an increasing problem in the United States. The 
U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) defines obesity for an 
adult as having a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or greater. The body mass index mea-
sures a person’s weight relative to the person’s height. (The exact formula is: BMI 5 
(Weight in pounds/(Height in inches)2) 3 703.) A BMI of 30 is equivalent to a person 
5'4" being 30 pounds overweight. Obesity is related to a variety of diseases, including 
heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and hypertension.
The two maps below show the striking increase in obesity in the 15 years be-
tween 1994 and 2009. In 1994, in a majority of states the population was between 
10 percent and 14 percent obese, and in no state was more than 20 percent of the 
population obese. By 2009, only in Colorado was less than 20 percent of the popula-
tion obese, and in about two-thirds of the states, 25 percent or more of the popula-
tion was obese, including nine states where more than 30 percent of the population 
was obese.

C H A P T E R  1  Economics: Foundations and Models 
Many people who suffer from obesity have underlying medical conditions. For 
these people, obesity is an unfortunate medical problem that they cannot control. The 
fact that obesity is increasing, though, indicates that for some people obesity is the 
result of diet and lifestyle choices. Potential explanations for the increase in obesity 
include greater intake of high-calorie fast foods, insufficient exercise, and a decline in 
the physical activity associated with many jobs. The CDC recommends that teenagers 
get a minimum of 60 minutes of aerobic exercise per day, a standard that only 15 per-
cent of high school students were meeting in 2011. In 1960, 50 percent of jobs in the 
United States required at least moderate physical activity. By 2010, only 20 percent of 
jobs did. As a result, the typical worker was burning off about 130 fewer calories per 
workday.
In addition to eating too much and not exercising enough, could health insurance 
be a cause of obesity? Obese people tend to suffer more medical problems than do peo-
ple who are not overweight and so incur higher medical costs. Overweight people with 
health insurance that will reimburse them for only part of their medical bills or who 
have no health insurance must pay some or all of these higher medical bills themselves. 
Overweight people with health insurance that covers most of their medical bills will 
not suffer as large a monetary cost from being obese. In other words, by reducing some 
of the costs of obesity, health insurance may give people an economic incentive to gain 
weight. At first glance, this argument may seem implausible. Some people suffer from 
medical conditions that can make physical activity difficult or that can cause weight 
gain even with moderate eating, so they may become overweight whether they have 
health insurance or not. Some people are overweight due to poor eating habits, and they 
probably don’t consider health insurance when deciding whether to have another slice 
of chocolate cake or to watch television instead of going to the gym. But if economists 
are correct about the importance of economic incentives, then we would expect that if 
we hold all other personal characteristics—such as age, gender, and income—constant, 
people with health insurance will be more likely to be overweight than people without 
health insurance.
Jay Bhattacharya and Kate Bundorf of Stanford University, Noemi Pace of Univer-
sity College London, and Neeraj Sood of the RAND Corporation, a research center, 
have analyzed the effects of health insurance on weight. Using a sample that followed

Three Key Economic Ideas

Optimal Decisions Are Made at the Margin
Some decisions are “all or nothing”: For instance, when an entrepreneur decides whether 
to open a new restaurant, she either starts the new restaurant or she doesn’t. When you 
decide whether to enter graduate school or to take a job, you either enter graduate school 
or you don’t. But rather than being all or nothing, most decisions in life involve doing a 
little more or a little less. If you are trying to decrease your spending and increase your 
saving, the decision is not really between saving all the money you earn or spending it 
all. Rather, many small choices are involved, such as whether to buy a caffè mocha at 
Starbucks every day or just three times per week.
Economists use the word marginal to mean “extra” or “additional.” Should you 
watch another hour of TV or spend that hour studying? The marginal benefit (or, 
in symbols, MB) of watching more TV is the additional enjoyment you receive. The 
marginal cost (or MC) is the lower grade you receive from having studied a little less. 
Should Apple produce an additional 300,000 iPhones? Firms receive revenue from 
selling goods. Apple’s marginal benefit is the additional revenue it receives from sell-
ing 300,000 more iPhones. Apple’s marginal cost is the additional cost—for wages, 
parts, and so forth—of producing 300,000 more iPhones. Economists reason that the 
optimal decision is to continue any activity up to the point where the marginal benefit 
equals the marginal cost—in symbols, where MB 5 MC. Often we apply this rule 
without consciously thinking about it. Usually you will know whether the additional 
enjoyment from watching a television program is worth the additional cost involved 
in not spending that hour studying, without giving the decision a lot of thought. In 
business situations, however, firms often have to make careful calculations to deter-
mine, for example, whether the additional revenue received from increasing produc-
tion is greater or less than the additional cost of the production. Economists refer to

nearly 80,000 people during the years 1989–2004, they found that after controlling for 
income, education, race, gender, age, and other factors, people with health insurance 
are significantly more likely to be overweight than are people without health insurance. 
Having private health insurance increased BMI by 1.3 points, and having public health 
insurance, such as Medicaid, which is a program under which the government provides 
health care to low-income people, increased BMI by 2.3 points. These findings suggest 
that people respond to economic incentives even when making decisions about what 
they eat and how much they exercise.

C H A P T E R  1  Economics: Foundations and Models 
The Economic Problem That Every Society 
Must Solve
Because we live in a world of scarcity, any society faces the economic problem that it 
has only a limited amount of economic resources—such as workers, machines, and raw 
materials—and so can produce only a limited amount of goods and services. Therefore, 
every society faces trade-offs: Producing more of one good or service means producing 
less of another good or service. In fact, the best way to measure the cost of producing a 
good or service is the value of what has to be given up to produce it. The opportunity 
cost of any activity—such as producing a good or service—is the highest-valued alter-
native that must be given up to engage in that activity. The concept of opportunity cost 
is very important in economics and applies to individuals as much as it does to firms 
or to society as a whole. Consider the example of a doctor who could receive a salary 
of $100,000 per year working as an employee of a hospital but decides to open his own 
Solved Problem 1.1
A Doctor Makes a Decision  
at the Margin
A doctor is considering keeping her office open 9 hours per 
day rather than 8 hours. The doctor’s office manager argues, 
“Keeping the office open an extra hour is a good idea because 
your practice will make a total profit of $300,000 per year  
when the office is open 9 hours per day.” Do you agree with 
the office manager’s reasoning? What, if any, additional in-
formation do you need to decide whether the doctor should 
keep her office open an additional hour per day?
Solving the Problem
Step 1: Review the chapter material. This problem is about making decisions, so you 
may want to review the section “Optimal Decisions Are Made at the Margin,” 
which begins on page 7.
Step 2: Explain whether you agree with the manager’s reasoning. We have seen 
that any activity should be continued to the point where the marginal benefit 
is equal to the marginal cost. In this case, that involves a doctor continuing 
to keep her office open up to the point where the additional revenue she re-
ceives from seeing more patients is equal to the marginal cost of keeping her 
office open an additional hour. The office manager has not done a marginal 
analysis, so you should not agree with the manager’s reasoning. The statement 
about the total profit of keeping the office open for 9 hours is not relevant to 
the decision of whether to stay open an additional hour.
Step 3: Explain what additional information you need. You will need additional infor-
mation to make a correct decision. You will need to know the marginal revenue 
and the marginal cost of keeping the practice open an extra hour. The marginal 
revenue would depend on how many more patients the doctor can see in the 
extra hour. The marginal cost would include the additional salary to be paid to 
the office staff, any additional medical supplies that would be used, as well as any 
additional electricity or other utilities. The doctor would also need to take into 
account the nonmonetary cost of spending another hour working rather than 
spending time with her family and friends or in other leisure activities.

private practice instead. In that case, the opportunity cost of the physician services he 
supplies to his own firm is the $100,000 he gives up by not working for the hospital, 
even if he does not explicitly pay himself a salary.
Trade-offs force society to make choices when answering the following three funda-
mental questions:
 1. What goods and services will be produced?
 2. How will the goods and services be produced?
 3. Who will receive the goods and services produced?
Throughout this book, we will return to these questions many times. For now, we briefly 
introduce each question.
What Goods and Services Will Be Produced?
How will society decide whether to produce more economics textbooks or more Blu-
ray players? More daycare facilities or more football stadiums? Of course, “society” 
does not make decisions; only individuals make decisions. The answer to the question 
of what will be produced is determined by the choices that consumers, firms, and the 
government make. Every day, you help decide which goods and services firms will 
produce when you choose to buy an iPhone instead of a BlackBerry or a caffè mo-
cha rather than a chai tea. Similarly, Apple must choose whether to devote its scarce 
resources to making more iPhones or more iPad tablet computers. The federal gov-
ernment must choose whether to spend more of its limited budget on breast cancer 
research or on repairing highways. In each case, consumers, firms, and the govern-
ment face the problem of scarcity by trading off one good or service for another. And 
each choice made comes with an opportunity cost, measured by the value of the best 
alternative given up.
How Will the Goods and Services Be Produced?
Firms choose how to produce the goods and services they sell. In many cases, firms face 
a trade-off between using more workers or using more machines. For example, a local 
service station has to choose whether to provide car repair services using more diagnos-
tic computers and fewer auto mechanics or more auto mechanics and fewer diagnostic 
computers. Similarly, movie studios have to choose whether to produce animated films 
using highly skilled animators to draw them by hand or fewer animators and more com-
puters. In deciding whether to move production offshore to China, firms may need to 
choose between a production method in the United States that uses fewer workers and 
more machines and a production method in China that uses more workers and fewer 
machines.
Who Will Receive the Goods and Services Produced?
In the United States, who receives the goods and services produced depends largely 
on how income is distributed. Individuals with the highest income have the ability to 
buy the most goods and services. Often, people are willing to give up some of their 
income—and, therefore, some of their ability to purchase goods and services—by 
donating to charities to increase the incomes of poorer people. Each year, Ameri-
cans donate about $300 billion to charity, or an average donation of $2,650 for each 
household in the country. An important policy question, however, is whether the gov-
ernment should intervene to make the distribution of income more equal. Such inter-
vention already occurs in the United States, because people with higher incomes pay 
a larger fraction of their incomes in taxes and because the government makes pay-
ments to people with low incomes. There is disagreement over whether the current 
attempts to redistribute income are sufficient or whether there should be more or less 
redistribution.

C H A P T E R  1  Economics: Foundations and Models 
Centrally Planned Economies versus  
Market Economies
To answer the three questions—what, how, and who—societies organize their econo-
mies in two main ways. A society can have a centrally planned economy in which the 
government decides how economic resources will be allocated. Or a society can have a 
market economy in which the decisions of households and firms interacting in markets 
allocate economic resources.
From 1917 to 1991, the most important centrally planned economy in the world 
was that of the Soviet Union, which was established when Vladimir Lenin and the 
Communist Party staged a revolution and took over the Russian Empire. In the So-
viet Union, the government decided what goods to produce, how the goods would 
be produced, and who would receive the goods. Government employees managed 
factories and stores. The objective of these managers was to follow the government’s 
orders rather than to satisfy the wants of consumers. Centrally planned economies 
like that of the Soviet Union have not been successful in producing low-cost, high-
quality goods and services. As a result, the standard of living of the average person in 
a centrally planned economy tends to be low. All centrally planned economies have 
also been political dictatorships. Dissatisfaction with low living standards and politi-
cal repression finally led to the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Today, only a few 
small countries, such as Cuba and North Korea, still have completely centrally planned 
economies.
All the high-income democracies, such as the United States, Canada, Japan, and 
the countries of Western Europe, have market economies. Market economies rely pri-
marily on privately owned firms to produce goods and services and to decide how 
to produce them. Markets, rather than the government, determine who receives the 
goods and services produced. In a market economy, firms must produce goods and 
services that meet the wants of consumers, or the firms will go out of business. In that 
sense, it is ultimately consumers who decide what goods and services will be produced. 
Because firms in a market economy compete to offer the highest-quality products at 
the lowest price, they are under pressure to use the lowest-cost methods of production. 
For example, in the past 10 years, some U.S. firms, particularly in the electronics and 
furniture industries, have been under pressure to reduce their costs to meet competi-
tion from Chinese firms.
In a market economy, the income of an individual is determined by the payments 
he receives for what he has to sell. If he is a civil engineer, and firms are willing to pay a 
salary of $85,000 per year for engineers with his training and skills, that is the amount 
of income he will have to purchase goods and services. If the engineer also owns a house 
that he rents out, his income will be even higher. One of the attractive features of mar-
kets is that they reward hard work. Generally, the more extensive the training a person 
has received and the longer the hours the person works, the higher the person’s income 
will be. Of course, luck—both good and bad—also plays a role here, as elsewhere in life. 
We can conclude that market economies respond to the question “Who receives the 
goods and services produced?” with the answer “Those who are most willing and able 
to buy them.”
The Modern “Mixed” Economy
In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the U.S. government engaged in rela-
tively little regulation of markets for goods and services. Beginning in the middle of 
the twentieth century, government intervention in the economy dramatically increased  
in the United States and other market economies. This increase was primarily caused by 
the high rates of unemployment and business bankruptcies during the Great Depression 
of the 1930s. Some government intervention was also intended to raise the incomes of 
the elderly, the sick, and people with limited skills. For example, in the 1930s, the United 
States established the Social Security system, which provides government payments to

retired and disabled workers, and minimum wage legislation, which sets a floor on the 
wages employers can pay workers in many occupations. In more recent years, govern-
ment intervention in the economy has also expanded to meet such goals as protection 
of the environment, the promotion of civil rights, and the provision of medical care to 
low-income people and the elderly.
Some economists argue that the extent of government intervention makes it  
no longer accurate to refer to the U.S., Canadian, Japanese, and Western European 
economies as pure market economies. Instead, they should be referred to as mixed 
economies. A mixed economy is still primarily a market economy because most eco-
nomic decisions result from the interaction of buyers and sellers in markets. However, 
the government plays a significant role in the allocation of resources. As we will see 
in later chapters, economists continue to debate the role government should play in a 
market economy.
One of the most important developments in the international economy in recent 
years has been the movement of China from being a centrally planned economy to 
being a more mixed economy. The Chinese economy suffered decades of economic 
stagnation following the takeover of the government in 1949 by Mao Zedong and the 
Communist Party. Although China remains a political dictatorship, production of 
most goods and services is now determined in the market rather than by the govern-
ment. The result has been rapid economic growth that in the near future may lead 
to total production of goods and services in China surpassing total production in the 
United States.
Efficiency and Equity
Market economies tend to be more efficient than centrally planned economies. There 
are two types of efficiency: productive efficiency and allocative efficiency.  Productive 
 efficiency occurs when a good or service is produced at the lowest possible cost. 
 Allocative efficiency occurs when production is in accordance with consumer pref-
erences. Markets tend to be efficient because they promote competition and facilitate 
voluntary exchange. With voluntary exchange, both the buyer and seller of a product 
are made better off by the transaction. We know that the buyer and seller are both 
made better off because, otherwise, the buyer would not have agreed to buy the prod-
uct or the seller would not have agreed to sell it. Productive efficiency is achieved 
when competition among firms in markets forces the firms to produce goods and 
services at the lowest cost. Allocative efficiency is achieved when the combination 
of competition among firms and voluntary exchange between firms and consumers 
results in firms producing the mix of goods and services that consumers prefer most. 
Competition will force firms to continue producing and selling goods and services as 
long as the additional benefit to consumers is greater than the additional cost of pro-
duction. In this way, the mix of goods and services produced will match consumer 
preferences.
Although markets promote efficiency, they don’t guarantee it. Inefficiency can 
arise from various sources. To begin with, it may take some time to achieve an efficient 
outcome. When Blu-ray players were introduced, for example, firms did not instantly 
achieve productive efficiency. It took several years for firms to discover the lowest-cost 
method of producing this good. As we will discuss in Chapter 4, governments some-
times reduce efficiency by interfering with voluntary exchange in markets. For exam-
ple, many governments limit the imports of some goods from foreign countries. This 
limitation reduces efficiency by keeping goods from being produced at the lowest cost. 
The production of some goods damages the environment. In this case, government in-
tervention can increase efficiency because without such intervention, firms may ignore 
the costs of environmental damage and thereby fail to produce the goods at the lowest 
possible cost.
An economically efficient outcome is not necessarily a desirable one. Many people 
prefer economic outcomes that they consider fair or equitable, even if those outcomes

sellers in markets but in which the

Productive efficiency A situation in 
which a good or service is produced at 
the lowest possible cost.
Allocative efficiency A state of 
the economy in which production 
is in accordance with consumer 
preferences; in particular, every good 
or service is produced up to the 
point where the last unit provides a 
marginal benefit to society equal to 
the marginal cost of producing it.

12 
C H A P T E R  1  Economics: Foundations and Models 
are less efficient. Equity is harder to define than efficiency, but it usually involves a 
fair distribution of economic benefits. For some people, equity involves a more equal 
distribution of economic benefits than would result from an emphasis on efficiency 
alone. For example, some people support raising taxes on people with higher incomes 
to provide the funds for programs that aid the poor. Although governments may in-
crease equity by reducing the incomes of high-income people and increasing the in-
comes of the poor, efficiency may be reduced. People have less incentive to open new 
businesses, to supply labor, and to save if the government takes a significant amount 
of the income they earn from working or saving. The result is that fewer goods and 
services are produced, and less saving takes place. As this example illustrates, there is 
often a trade-off between  efficiency and equity. Government policymakers often con-
front this trade-off.
Economic Models
Economists rely on economic theories, or models (the words theory and model are used 
interchangeably), to analyze real-world issues, such as those involved with health care. 
As mentioned earlier, economic models are simplified versions of reality. Economists 
are certainly not alone in relying on models: An engineer may use a computer model 
of a bridge to help test whether it will withstand high winds, or a biologist may make 
a physical model of a nucleic acid to better understand its properties. One purpose of 
economic models is to make economic ideas sufficiently explicit and concrete so that 
individuals, firms, or the government can use them to make decisions. For example, we 
will see in Chapter 3 that the model of demand and supply is a simplified version of how 
the prices of products are determined by the interactions among buyers and sellers in 
markets.
Economists use economic models to answer questions. For example, will the United 
States have a sufficient number of doctors in 2020? For a complicated question like this 
one, economists often use several models to examine different aspects of the issue. For 
example, economists at the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) build models that al-
low them to forecast future employment in different occupations. These models allow 
the BLS to forecast how many doctors there are likely to be at a future date. Economists 
can use different models to forecast the demand for medical services. Together these 
models can be used to determine whether there will be a sufficient number of doctors 
in 2020. As mentioned on page 3, economists at the U.S. Health Resources and Services 
Administration (HRSA) have used models to forecast that there will be a shortage of 
about 56,000 doctors in 2020.
Sometimes economists use an existing model to analyze an issue, but in other cases, 
they must develop a new model. To develop a model, economists generally follow these 
steps:
 1. Decide on the assumptions to use in developing the model.
 2. Formulate a testable hypothesis.
 3. Use economic data to test the hypothesis.
 4. Revise the model if it fails to explain the economic data well.
 5. Retain the revised model to help answer similar economic questions in the future.
The Role of Assumptions in Economic Models
Any model is based on making assumptions because models have to be simplified 
to be useful. We cannot analyze an economic issue unless we reduce its complex-
ity. For  example, economic models make behavioral assumptions about the motives 
of  consumers and firms. Economists assume that consumers will buy the goods and 
services that will maximize their well-being or their satisfaction. Similarly, economists 
 assume that firms act to maximize their profits. These assumptions are simplifications 
because they do not describe the motives of every consumer and every firm. How can

we know if the assumptions in a model are too simplified or too limiting? We discover 
this when we form hypotheses based on these assumptions and test these hypotheses 
using real-world information.
Forming and Testing Hypotheses  
in Economic Models
An economic variable is something measurable that can have different values, such 
as the incomes of doctors. A hypothesis in an economic model is a statement that 
may be either correct or incorrect about an economic variable. An example of a hy-
pothesis in an economic model is the statement that the falling incomes earned by 
primary care physicians—often referred to as “family doctors”—will result in a de-
cline in the number of physicians choosing to enter primary care in the United States 
in 2020. An economic hypothesis is usually about a causal relationship; in this case, 
the hypothesis states that lower incomes cause, or lead to, fewer doctors entering 
primary care.
We have to test a hypothesis before we can accept it. To test a hypothesis, we ana-
lyze statistics on the relevant economic variables. In our primary care doctor example, 
we would gather statistics on the incomes of primary care physicians, the number of 
primary care physicians, and perhaps other variables as well. Testing a hypothesis can 
be tricky. For example, showing that the number of primary care physicians declined at 
a time when the average income of these physicians declined would not be enough to 
demonstrate that the decline in income caused the decline in the number of physicians. 
Just because two things are correlated—that is, they happen at the same time—does not 
mean that one caused the other. For example, before entering practice, a doctor spends 
time in a teaching hospital as a resident in his or her field. Teaching hospitals deter-
mine how many residencies they will offer in a particular field. Suppose that teaching 
hospitals decreased the number of residencies in primary care at the same time that the 
incomes of primary care physicians were declining. In that case, the declining number 
of residencies, rather than the declining incomes, might have caused the decline in the 
number of primary care physicians. Over a period of time, many economic variables 
change, which complicates the testing of hypotheses. In fact, when economists disagree 
about a hypothesis, such as the effect of falling incomes on the supply of primary care 
physicians, it is often because of disagreements over interpreting the statistical analysis 
used to test the hypothesis.
Note that hypotheses must be statements that could, in principle, turn out to be in-
correct. Statements such as “Increasing the number of primary care physicians is good” 
or “Increasing the number of primary care physicians is bad” are value judgments rather 
than hypotheses because it is not possible to disprove them.
Economists accept and use an economic model if it leads to hypotheses that are 
confirmed by statistical analysis. In many cases, the acceptance is tentative, however, 
pending the gathering of new data or further statistical analysis. In fact, economists of-
ten refer to a hypothesis having been “not rejected,” rather than having been “accepted,” 
by statistical analysis. But what if statistical analysis clearly rejects a hypothesis? For 
example, what if a model leads to a hypothesis that declining incomes of primary care 
physicians will lead to a decline in the number of these physicians, but the data reject 
this hypothesis? In this case, the model must be reconsidered. It may be that an as-
sumption used in the model was too simplified or too limiting. For example, perhaps 
the model ignored the fact that primary care physicians were moving from owning 
their own practices to become salaried employees of hospitals, where they would be 
freed from the responsibilities involved in running their own businesses. This change 
in how primary care physicians are employed might explain why the data rejected the 
hypothesis.
In 2010, the BLS analyzed the accuracy of the projections it had made in 1996 of 
employment levels in 2006. Some projections were quite accurate, while others were 
less so. For instance, the BLS had projected that 677,917 physicians and surgeons would

values, such as the incomes of doctors.

14 
C H A P T E R  1  Economics: Foundations and Models 
be employed in 2006, but actual employment was only 633,292, or about 7 percent less 
than projected. The error with respect to physician’s assistants was much larger, with 
the projection being that 93,485 physician’s assistants would be employed in 2006, but 
employment was actually only 65,628, or about 30 percent less than expected. Analyz-
ing the errors in these projections helps the BLS to improve the models it uses to make 
projections of occupational employment.
The process of developing models, testing hypotheses, and revising models  occurs 
not just in economics but also in disciplines such as physics, chemistry, and biology. 
This process is often referred to as the scientific method. Economics is a social sci-
ence because it applies the scientific method to the study of the interactions among 
individuals.
Normative and Positive Analysis
Throughout this book, as we build economic models and use them to answer questions, 
we need to bear in mind the distinction between positive analysis and normative  analysis. 
Positive analysis is concerned with what is, and normative analysis is  concerned with 
what ought to be. Economics is about positive analysis, which measures the costs and 
benefits of different courses of action.
We can use the federal government’s minimum wage law to compare positive 
and normative analysis. In 2012, under this law, it was illegal for an employer to hire 
a worker at a wage less than $7.25 per hour. Without the minimum wage law, some 
firms and some workers would voluntarily agree to a lower wage. Because of the min-
imum wage law, some workers have difficulty finding jobs, and some firms end up 
paying more for labor than they otherwise would have. A positive analysis of the fed-
eral minimum wage law uses an economic model to estimate how many workers have 
lost their jobs because of the law, its effect on the costs and profits of businesses, and 
the gains to workers receiving the minimum wage. After economists complete this 
positive analysis, the decision as to whether the minimum wage law is a good idea or 
a bad idea is a normative one and depends on how people evaluate the trade-off in-
volved. Supporters of the law believe that the losses to employers and to workers who 
are unemployed as a result of the law are more than offset by the gains to workers 
who receive higher wages than they would without the law. Opponents of the law be-
lieve the losses are greater than the gains. The assessment by any individual depends, 
in part, on that person’s values and political views. The positive analysis an economist 
provides would play a role in the decision but can’t by itself decide the issue one way 
or the other.
In each chapter, you will see a Don’t Let This Happen to You box like the one on the 
next page. These boxes alert you to common pitfalls in thinking about economic ideas.

Economics as a Social Science
Because economics studies the actions of individuals, it is a social science. Eco-
nomics is therefore similar to other social science disciplines, such as psychology, 
political  science, and sociology. As a social science, economics considers human 
behavior—particularly decision-making behavior—in every context, not just in the 
context of business. Economists have studied such issues as how families decide on 
the number of children to have, why people have difficulty losing weight or attaining 
other desirable goals, and why people often ignore relevant information when mak-
ing decisions. Economics also has much to contribute to questions of government 
policy. As we will see throughout this book, economists have played an important 
role in formulating government policies in areas such as the environment, health 
care, and poverty.

Should Medical School Be Free?
The U.S. population continues to increase, which by itself 
would increase the demand for medical services. In addition, 
though, the average age of the popula-
tion is rising, and older people need 
more medical care than do younger people. So, over time, the 
number of doctors needs to increase. As mentioned at the begin-
ning of the chapter, the Health Resources and Services Admin-
istration (HRSA) estimates that the number of doctors needed 
to provide patient care will rise from about 805,000 in 2010 to 
922,000 in 2020.
Can we be sure that these additional doctors will be available 
in 2020? The HRSA forecasts that, in fact, there will be a shortage 
of 56,000 doctors in 2020. The bulk of that shortage is likely to be 
in primary care physicians, or family doctors. As we will discuss 
in later chapters, ordinarily we expect that when consumers want 
more of a product, higher wages and salaries and more job open-
ings will attract workers to that industry. For example, during the 
U.S. housing boom of the mid-2000s, the number of workers in 
the building trades—carpenters, plumbers, roofers, and others—increased rapidly. But 
producing more doctors is a long process. After completing his or her undergraduate 
education, a doctor spends four years in medical school and then three to five years at 
a teaching hospital, pursuing a residency in a particular field of medicine. Apparently 
convinced that hospitals will not train enough doctors unless they get help, Congress 
contributes $10 billion per year to teaching hospitals, based on the number of residents 
they train.
Recently, Peter Bach of the Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and Robert Kocher of 
the Brookings Institution have proposed that medical schools should charge no tu-
ition. They argue that nearly all students graduate from medical school owing money 
on student loans, with the average student owing more than $150,000. We might ex-
pect that these debts, although large, would not deter students from applying to medi-
cal school, because in 2011, the average income of physicians was more than $250,000

Making  
the 
Connection
Don’t Confuse Positive Analysis with 
Normative Analysis
“Economic analysis has shown that the minimum wage law 
is a bad idea because it causes unemployment.” Is this state-
ment accurate? As of 2012, the federal minimum wage law 
prevents employers from hiring workers at a wage of less 
than $7.25 per hour. This wage is higher than some employ-
ers are willing to pay some workers. If there were no mini-
mum wage law, some workers who currently cannot find 
any firm willing to hire them at $7.25 per hour would be 
able to find employment at a lower wage. Therefore, positive 
economic analysis indicates that the minimum wage law 
causes unemployment (although economists disagree about 
how much unemployment the minimum wage causes). 
But, some of those workers who have jobs benefit from the 
 minimum wage because they are paid a higher wage than 
they otherwise would be. In other words, the minimum 
wage law creates both losers (the workers who become un-
employed and the firms that have to pay higher wages) and 
winners (the workers who receive higher wages).
Should we value the gains to the winners more than 
we value the losses to the losers? The answer to this ques-
tion involves normative analysis. Positive economic analy-
sis can show the consequences of a particular policy, but it 
cannot tell us whether the policy is “good” or “bad.” So, the 
statement at the beginning of this box is inaccurate.

per year. Bach and Kocher argue, though, that the high cost of medical school has 
two bad outcomes: Some good students do not apply because they either do not want 
to be saddled with such large debts or because they are unable to borrow sufficient 
money, and many students avoid going into primary care—where average incomes are 
$190,000—in favor of specialties such as plastic surgery or anesthesiology—where av-
erage incomes are $325,000. Teaching hospitals pay doctors a salary of about $50,000 
per year during their residencies. Bach and Kocher propose that hospitals continue 
to pay residents who pursue primary care but not pay residents who specialize. The 
money that hospitals would otherwise pay to these residents would be paid to medical 
schools instead to finance the free tuition. The plan would give residents an incen-
tive to pursue primary care rather than to specialize. Critics of the Bach and Kocher 
proposal have questioned whether many students capable of being admitted to medi-
cal school actually are deterred by medical school tuition. They also question whether 
many residents who intend to specialize would choose primary care instead, even if 
specializing means they have to borrow to meet living expenses rather than paying for 
them with a hospital salary.
Like many other policy debates, the debate over whether changes should be made 
in how medical school is paid for has positive and normative elements. By gathering 
data and using economic models, it is possible to assess some of the quantitative claims 
made by each side in the debate: What role does tuition play in a student’s decision 
about whether to attend medical school? Have tuition increases had a large effect or a 
small effect on the number of applications to medical school? How do changes in ex-
pected future incomes affect the decisions of medical students about which specialty to 
choose? These are all positive questions, so it is possible to formulate quantitative an-
swers. Ultimately, though, this debate also has a normative element. For instance, some 
doctors, economists, and policymakers argue that it is important that people living in 
low-income or rural areas have improved access to health care, so they are willing to 
support policies that would redirect medical students away from specialized fields and 
toward primary care. Other doctors, economists, and policymakers believe that medi-
cal students who enter specialized fields make a larger contribution to society than 
do students who enter primary care. A disagreement of this type is unlikely to be re-
solved by building models and analyzing data because the issue involved is essentially 
normative.
In 2010, President Obama and Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Afford-
able Care Act, which made major changes to the U.S. health care system. The changes 
are being phased in through 2014. Additional changes are likely as policymakers grap-
ple with the rapidly escalating costs of health care. Whether Congress and the president 
will enact policies intended to increase the number of primary care physicians remains 
to be seen.

Microeconomics and Macroeconomics
Economic models can be used to analyze decision making in many areas. We group 
some of these areas together as microeconomics and others as macroeconomics. Micro-
economics is the study of how households and firms make choices, how they interact 
in markets, and how the government attempts to influence their choices. Microeco-
nomic issues include explaining how consumers react to changes in product prices and 
how firms decide what prices to charge for the products they sell. Microeconomics also

 involves policy issues, such as analyzing the most efficient way to reduce teenage smok-
ing, analyzing the costs and benefits of approving the sale of a new prescription drug, 
and analyzing the most efficient way to reduce air pollution.
Macroeconomics is the study of the economy as a whole, including topics such as 
inflation, unemployment, and economic growth. Macroeconomic issues include ex-
plaining why economies experience periods of recession and increasing unemployment 
and why, over the long run, some economies have grown much faster than others. Mac-
roeconomics also involves policy issues, such as whether government intervention can 
reduce the severity of recessions.
The division between microeconomics and macroeconomics is not hard and fast. 
Many economic situations have both a microeconomic and a macroeconomic aspect. For 
example, the level of total investment by firms in new machinery and equipment helps 
to determine how rapidly the economy grows—which is a macroeconomic  issue. But to 
understand how much new machinery and equipment firms decide to purchase, we have 
to analyze the incentives individual firms face—which is a microeconomic issue.
A Preview of Important Economic Terms
In the following chapters, you will encounter certain important terms again and again. 
Becoming familiar with these terms is a necessary step in learning economics. Here we 
provide a brief introduction to some of these terms. We will discuss them all in greater 
depth in later chapters:
• 
Entrepreneur. An entrepreneur is someone who operates a business. In a market 
system, entrepreneurs decide what goods and services to produce and how to pro-
duce them. An entrepreneur starting a new business puts his or her own funds at 
risk. If an entrepreneur is wrong about what consumers want or about the best way 
to produce goods and services, the entrepreneur’s funds can be lost. This is not an 
unusual occurrence: In the United States, about half of new businesses close within 
four years. Without entrepreneurs willing to assume the risk of starting and operat-
ing businesses, economic progress would be impossible in a market system.
• 
Innovation. 
There is a distinction between an invention and innovation. An 
 invention is the development of a new good or a new process for making a good. 
An innovation is the practical application of an invention. (Innovation may also be 
used more broadly to refer to any significant improvement in a good or in the means 
of producing a good.) Much time often passes between the appearance of a new 
idea and its development for widespread use. For example, the Wright brothers first 
achieved self-propelled flight at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, in 1903, but the Wright 
brothers’ plane was very crude, and it wasn’t until the introduction of the DC-3 by 
Douglas Aircraft in 1936 that regularly scheduled intercity airline flights became 
common in the United States. Similarly, the first digital electronic computer—the 
ENIAC—was developed in 1945, but the first IBM personal computer was not intro-
duced until 1981, and widespread use of computers did not have a significant effect 
on the productivity of U.S. business until the 1990s.
• 
Technology. A firm’s technology is the processes it uses to produce goods and ser-
vices. In the economic sense, a firm’s technology depends on many factors, such as 
the skill of its managers, the training of its workers, and the speed and efficiency of 
its machinery and equipment.
• 
Firm, company, or business. A firm is an organization that produces a good or 
service. Most firms produce goods or services to earn profits, but there are also 
nonprofit firms, such as universities and some hospitals. Economists use the terms 
firm, company, and business interchangeably.
• 
Goods. Goods are tangible merchandise, such as books, computers, or Blu-ray 
players.
Microeconomics The study of how 
households and firms make choices, 
how they interact in markets, and how 
the government attempts to influence 
their choices.
Macroeconomics The study of the 
economy as a whole, including topics 
such as inflation, unemployment, and 
economic growth.
1.5 LEARNING OBJECTIVE

terms.

C H A P T E R  1  Economics: Foundations and Models 
• 
Services. Services are activities done for others, such as providing haircuts or in-
vestment advice.
• 
Revenue. A firm’s revenue is the total amount received for selling a good or ser-
vice. It is calculated by multiplying the price per unit by the number of units sold.
• 
Profit. A firm’s profit is the difference between its revenue and its costs. Econo-
mists distinguish between accounting profit and economic profit. In calculating ac-
counting profit, we exclude the cost of some economic resources that the firm does 
not pay for explicitly. In calculating economic profit, we include the opportunity 
cost of all resources used by the firm. When we refer to profit in this book, we mean 
economic profit. It is important not to confuse profit with revenue.
• 
Household. A household consists of all persons occupying a home. Households 
are suppliers of factors of production—particularly labor—used by firms to make 
goods and services. Households also demand goods and services produced by firms 
and governments.
• 
Factors of production or economic resources. Firms use factors of production 
to produce goods and services. The main factors of production are labor, capital, 
natural resources—including land—and entrepreneurial ability. Households earn 
income by supplying to firms the factors of production.
• 
Capital. The word capital can refer to financial capital or to physical capital. Fi-
nancial capital includes stocks and bonds issued by firms, bank accounts, and 
holdings of money. In economics, though, capital refers to physical capital, which 
includes manufactured goods that are used to produce other goods and services. 
Examples of physical capital are computers, factory buildings, machine tools, ware-
houses, and trucks. The total amount of physical capital available in a country is 
referred to as the country’s capital stock.
• 
Human capital. Human capital refers to the accumulated training and skills that 
workers possess. For example, college-educated workers generally have more skills 
and are more productive than workers who have only high school degrees.

Economics in Your Life
Will There Be Plenty of Jobs Available in the Health Care Industry?
At the beginning of the chapter, we posed the question “What is the basis for the forecasts on the avail-
ability of jobs in health care, and how reliable are the forecasts?” As the U.S. population increases and as 
the average age of the population rises, it seems likely that there will be an increase in the numbers of 
doctors, nurses, physician’s assistants, and other health care workers. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics 
(BLS) publishes the most widely used occupational forecasts. Economists at the BLS base these forecasts 
on economic models. The forecasts can be inaccurate, however. For example, in 1996, the BLS forecast 
that 93,485 physician’s assistants would be employed in 2006, when in fact only 65,628 were. The BLS 
analyzes errors like these in attempting to improve its forecasts. So, it is likely that the BLS’s forecasts will 
become more accurate over time, but it would be a mistake to expect the forecasts to be exact.

Conclusion
Economics is a group of useful ideas about how individuals make choices. Economists 
have put these ideas into practice by developing economic models. Consumers, busi-
ness managers, and government policymakers use these models every day to help make 
choices. In this book, we explore many key economic models and give examples of how 
to apply them in the real world.
Reading newspapers and other periodicals is an important part of understanding 
the current business climate and learning how to apply economic concepts to a variety 
of real-world events. At the end of each chapter, you will see a two-page feature titled An 
Inside Look. This feature consists of an excerpt from an article that relates to the com-
pany or economic issue introduced at the start of the chapter and also to the concepts 
discussed in the chapter. A summary and an analysis and supporting graphs highlight 
the key economic points of the article. Read An Inside Look on the next page to explore 
reasons why some health care workers are delaying retirement. Test your understanding 
by answering the Thinking Critically questions.

“You add up all the uncertainty, 
financial losses, change in laws, and 
it’s not surprising people are afraid to 
make any change at all,” Dr. Waldman 
said.
For those who find a place to go, 
selling their homes might make it dif-
ficult or impossible to leave without 
taking a financial loss.
A report released May 19 by the 
Conference Board research group rein-
forced the difficulty many health care 
workers face as they reach retirement 
age. The health industry experienced 
the largest decline in retirement rates 
between a 2004-07 survey period and a 
2009-10 survey period, according to an 
analysis of delayed retirement across all 
industries. Only 1.55% of full-time health 
care workers age 55 to 64 retired within 
12 months of the 2009-10 study pe-
riod, compared with 3.95% in 2004-07.  
The health care sector had the lowest 
rate of retirement, significantly less than 
the other industries studied.
The SK&A survey found that 
doctors in some specialties are much 
more likely to retire or move than 
their peers. Physicians specializing in 
aerospace medicine had the highest 
move rate at 27.9%, and plastic sur-
geons had the lowest, at 6.3%. Family 
physicians had an 11.4% move rate.

 SK&A publishes its data for the 
benefit of pharmaceutical and medi-
cal equipment companies who want 
to sell to physicians, but the figures 
are one lens through which to view 
the economy’s effect on physician 
practices.
Mark Doescher, MD, MSPH, di-
rector of the University of Washington 
Center for Health Workforce Studies, 
said a more stable work force could 
be good for areas facing a declin-
ing number of physicians and other 
health professionals, mainly outside 
major cities.
“I do think the down economy 
has actually caused stability in the 
work force, which is good for many 
rural locations,” he said. “But when 
people do retire, we’re going to see 
some difficult times ahead.”
 Deane Waldman, MD, a pedi-
atric cardiologist at the University 
of New Mexico Children’s Hospital 
in Albuquerque and an author who 
writes about the health care system, 
cautioned that the SK&A move rate 
isn’t a scientific measurement of phy-
sician turnover or retirement.
But he said it makes sense that 
physicians would be unlikely to 
change jobs or retire now, given a long 
list of pressures: uncertainty about 
health system reform, declining in-
come due to falling reimbursement 
rates, a constantly shifting medical 
liability environment, licensing regu-
lations that make it difficult to relo-
cate, and a shortage of physicians that 
makes it difficult to find someone to 
take over a practice.
Fewer Physicians 
Move, a Sign of 
Career Caution
Physicians changed addresses at a 
lower rate during the last year than in 
the previous three years, according to 
a survey of 253,000 medical offices.
 Each year, SK&A, an Irvine, 
Calif.-based Cegedim firm that spe-
cializes in health care marketing in-
formation, compiles a database of 
664,600 physicians who work in med-
ical offices. Since 2008, the firm has 
published a report on the “move rate,” 
which indicates how many physicians 
are no longer at a given office because 
they moved, retired or died.
Based on survey answers between 
March 2010 and March 2011, the firm 
calculated an 11.3% move rate for its 
most recent report, marking another 
year of decline. The move rate was 
reported as 12.4% in 2010, 15% in 
2009 and 18.2% in 2008, according to 
SK&A.
Experts say the move rate, though 
an unscientific measure, could re-
flect the ways in which the economy 
is keeping physicians from changing 
jobs or retiring, including financial 
stress, the medical liability environ-
ment and licensure laws.
Physicians “don’t seem to be mo-
tivated by the factors that in the past 
have caused a desire to move—a big 
caseload, a better salary [elsewhere], 
or a better community with better 
amenities,” SK&A spokesman Jack 
Schember said.

 especially in these rural areas. Economic un-
certainty has kept many of these profession-
als from retiring or relocating and has 
therefore been beneficial to the populations 
in these locations. The upside is likely to be 
temporary, though, for unlike the typical 
happy Hollywood ending of the big-city 
doctor falling in love with the small town, re-
location to these areas continues to fall, so 
when the eventual retirement of these rural 
physicians ultimately occurs, doctor short-
ages will likely continue.
c Economic uncertainty, changes in 
health care laws, and financial con-
cerns have been credited with being par-
tially responsible for not only an increase in 
physicians giving up their private practices 
to become salaried hospital employees but 
also a decrease in the number of physicians 
either relocating to new jobs or retiring from 
their practices. This trend seems to indicate 
that many of those doctors who are con-
tinuing to relocate are moving to hospitals 
rather than new or different private prac-
tices. As long as uncertainties remain in the 
economy and with health care reform, it 
would not be surprising if physicians re-
mained concerned about their professional 
and financial futures and worried that this 
trend will continue.
Thinking Critically
1. One important economic idea is that 
people are rational. Explain how this idea 
relates to the decline in the “move rate” 
of physicians over the past three years.
2. The article states that in 2009–2010, 
the health care industry had the low-
est  retirement rate of all industries sur-
veyed. Suppose you want to develop 
an  economic model to analyze the 
 relationship between the retirement rate 
of physicians and changes in insurance 
reimbursement rates. Use information 
from the article to explain the steps you 
would take to develop this model.
percent in 2011. According to the chapter 
opener on page 3, physicians had for years 
typically operated their practices on their 
own or in partnerships with other doctors, 
but over the past several years, a growing 
number of physicians have given up their 
private practices to become salaried hospi-
tal employees, and by 2008, more medical 
practices were owned by hospitals than by 
the doctors themselves. The figure below il-
lustrates the data. Rising costs and finan-
cial uncertainty are thought to be one of the 
primary reasons that a growing number of 
physicians have given up private practice 
for hospital employment, and the “move 
rate” seems to indicate that a growing 
number of these physicians are staying put 
at their hospital jobs, forgoing re-entering 
private practice or retirement.

 Michael J. Fox plays a Beverly Hills sur-
geon who, after causing a traffic accident in

trend of rural communities finding it increas-
ingly difficult to attract medical professionals

Key Points in the Article
This article discusses the continued de-
cline in the number of physicians who have 
changed jobs or retired over the past three 
years. Possible reasons for the decline in-
clude the 2007–2009 economic recession, 
the slow recovery from that recession, the 
lower insurance reimbursement rates, and 
the still-uncertain outcome of the reforms to 
the health care system. A May 2011 report 
by the Conference Board research group 
shows that the health care industry had 
the largest decline in retirement rates from 
2004 to 2007 and again from 2009 to 2010, 
when the industry also had the lowest rate 
of retirement of all industries surveyed. This 
decline indicates that changes in the health 
care industry have many health profession-
als concerned about their finances as they 
approach retirement age.

Summary
Economics is the study of the choices consumers, business man-
agers, and government officials make to attain their goals, given 
their scarce resources. We must make choices because of scarcity, 
which means that although our wants are unlimited, the resources 
available to fulfill those wants are limited. Economists assume that 
people are rational in the sense that consumers and firms use all 
available information as they take actions intended to achieve their 
goals. Rational individuals weigh the benefits and costs of each 
 action and choose an action only if the benefits outweigh the costs. 
Although people act from a variety of motives, ample evidence in-
dicates that they respond to economic incentives. Economists use 
the word marginal to mean extra or additional. The optimal deci-
sion is to continue any activity up to the point where the marginal 
benefit equals the marginal cost.

Problems and Applications
 
1.3 Bank robberies are on the rise in New Jersey, and according 
to the FBI, this increase has little to do with the economic 
downturn. The FBI claims that banks have allowed them-
selves to become easy targets by refusing to install clear 
acrylic partitions, called “bandit barriers,” which separate 
bank tellers from the public. Of the 193 banks robbed in 
New Jersey in 2008, only 23 had these barriers, and of the 
40 banks robbed in the first 10 weeks of 2009, only 1 had a 
bandit barrier. According to a special agent with the FBI, 
“Bandit barriers are a great deterrent. We’ve talked to guys 
who rob banks, and as soon as they see a bandit  barrier, 
they go find another bank.” Despite this finding, many 
banks have been reluctant to install these barriers. Wouldn’t 
banks have a strong incentive to install bandit barriers to 
deter robberies? Why, then, do so many banks not do so?

 Robberies,” NorthJersey.com, March 10, 2009.
 
1.4 The grading system is a powerful resource for teachers. In 
their book Effective Grading: A Tool for Learning and As-
sessment, Barbara Walvoord and Virginia Anderson state 
that “teachers must manage the power and complexity of 
the grading system” and that “teachers must consider grad-
ing in their first deliberations about a course.”
 
a. How could the grading system a teacher uses affect the 
incentives of students to learn the course material?
 
b. If teachers put too little weight in the grading scale on a 
certain part of the course, such as readings outside the 
textbook, how might students respond?
 
c. Teachers often wish that students came to class pre-
pared, having read the upcoming material. How could 
a teacher design the grading system to motivate stu-
dents to come to class prepared?

1.5 [Related to the Making the Connection on page 5] 
Many universities and corporations offer a health well-
ness program that helps their employees improve or main-
tain their health and get paid (a relatively small amount) 
for doing so. The programs vary but typically consist of 
 employees completing a health assessment, receiving a 
program for healthy living, and monitoring their monthly 
health activities. Why would corporations and universities 
pay employees to take care of themselves? How does health 
insurance affect the incentive of employees to improve or 
maintain their health? How would a wellness program af-
fect the health insurance premiums the employer pays on 
behalf of the employees?

are not obese. At firms that do not provide health insur-
ance, obese workers do not receive lower wages than work-
ers who are not obese.
 
a. Why might firms that provide workers with health 
insurance pay a lower wage to obese workers than to 
workers who are not obese?

with an incentive to become obese? Briefly explain.

1.7 [Related to Solved Problem 1.1 on page 8] During 2009, 
movie studios began to release a substantial number of 
films in 3-D format. To show films in this format, theater 
owners have to invest in 3-D equipment that costs $75,000 
for each projector. Typically, theater owners can charge 
about $3 more for a ticket to a 3-D movie than for a movie 
in the conventional 2-D format. If you owned a movie the-
ater, discuss how you would go about deciding whether to 
invest in 3-D equipment. How would your analysis change, 
given information that the proportion of total box-office 
spending on 3-D movies has been relatively flat since 2009?

1.8 [Related to Solved Problem 1.1 on page 8] Two students 
are discussing Solved Problem 1.1:
Joe: “I think the key additional information you need to 
know in deciding whether the doctor should keep the 
medical practice open 9 hours per day rather than 8 hours 
is the amount of profit she is currently making while be-
ing open 8 hours. Then she can compare the profit earned 
from being open 9 hours with the profit earned from  
being open 8 hours. This information is more important 
than the additional revenue and additional cost of being 
open 1 more hour.”
Jill: “Actually, Joe, knowing how much profits change 
when the medical practice stays open 1 more hour is ex-
actly the same as knowing the additional revenue and the 
additional cost.”

semester, a friend tells you, “I was going to drop my psy-
chology course so I could concentrate on my other courses, 
but I had already put so much time into the course that I 
decided not to drop it.” What do you think of your friend’s 
reasoning? Would it make a difference to your answer if 
your friend has to pass the psychology course at some 
point to graduate? Briefly explain.
 1.10 In a paper written by Bentley College economists Patricia 
M. Flynn and Michael A. Quinn, the authors state:
We find evidence that Economics is a good 
choice of major for those aspiring to become a 
CEO [chief executive officer]. When adjusting 
for size of the pool of graduates, those with un-
dergraduate degrees in Economics are shown 
to have had a greater likelihood of becoming 
an S&P 500 CEO than any other major.
 
 A list of famous economics majors published by Marietta 
College includes business leaders Warren Buffett,  Donald 
Trump, Ted Turner, Diane von Furstenberg, and Sam 
 Walton, as well as former presidents George H.W. Bush, 
Gerald Ford, and Ronald Reagan. Why might studying 
economics be particularly good preparation for being the 
top manager of a corporation or a leader in government?

Summary
Society faces trade-offs: Producing more of one good or ser-
vice means producing less of another good or service. The 
 opportunity cost of any activity—such as producing a good or 
service—is the highest-valued alternative that must be given up to 
engage in that activity. The choices of consumers, firms, and gov-
ernments determine what goods and services will be produced. 
Firms choose how to produce the goods and services they sell. In 
the United States, who receives the goods and services produced 
depends largely on how income is distributed in the marketplace. 
In a centrally planned economy, most economic decisions are 
made by the government. In a market economy, most economic 
decisions are made by consumers and firms. Most economies, in-
cluding that of the United States, are mixed economies in which 
most economic decisions are made by consumers and firms but in 
which the government also plays a significant role. There are two 
types of efficiency: productive efficiency and allocative efficiency. 
Productive efficiency occurs when a good or service is produced 
at the lowest possible cost. Allocative efficiency occurs when 
production is in accordance with consumer preferences. Volun-
tary exchange is a situation that occurs in markets when both the 
buyer and seller of a product are made better off by the transac-
tion. Equity is more difficult to define than efficiency, but it usu-
ally involves a fair distribution of economic benefits. Government 
policymakers often face a trade-off between equity and efficiency.

Problems and Applications
 
2.5 Does Bill Gates, one of the richest people in the world, face 
scarcity? Does everyone? Are there any exceptions?
 
2.6 In a market economy, why does a firm have a strong incen-
tive to be productively efficient and allocatively efficient? 
What does the firm earn if it is productively and alloca-
tively efficient, and what happens if it is not?
 
2.7 Would you expect new and better machinery and equip-
ment to be adopted more rapidly in a market economy or 
in a centrally planned economy? Briefly explain.
 
2.8 Centrally planned economies have been less efficient than 
market economies.
 
a. Has this difference in efficiency happened by chance, 
or is there some underlying reason?
 
b. If market economies are more economically efficient 
than centrally planned economies, would there ever be 
a reason to prefer having a centrally planned economy 
rather than a market economy?
 
2.9 Relative to a market economy, would you expect a centrally 
planned economy to be better at productive efficiency or 
allocative efficiency? Briefly explain.
 2.10 Leonard Fleck, a philosophy professor at Michigan State 
University, has written:
When it comes to health care in America, we 
have limited resources for unlimited health 
care needs. We want everything contemporary 
medical technology can offer that will improve 
the length or quality of our lives as we age. But 
as presently healthy taxpayers, we want costs 
controlled.
 
 Why is it necessary for all economic systems to limit services 
such as health care? How does a market system prevent peo-
ple from getting as many goods and services as they want?
From Leonard Fleck, Just Caring: Health Care Rationing and Demo-
cratic Deliberation, (New York: Oxford University Press, 2009).
 2.11 Suppose that your local police department recovers 
100 tickets to a big NASCAR race in a drug raid.  Police 
decide to distribute the tickets to residents and an-
nounces that tickets will be given away at 10 a.m. Monday 
at City Hall.
 
a. What groups of people will be most likely to try to get the 
tickets? Think of specific examples and then generalize.
 
b. What is the opportunity cost of distributing the tickets 
this way?
 
c. Productive efficiency occurs when a good or service 
(such as the distribution of tickets) is produced at the 
lowest possible cost. Is this an efficient way to distrib-
ute the tickets? If possible, think of a more efficient 
method of distributing the tickets.
 
d. Is this an equitable way to distribute the tickets? Explain.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE: Understand the role of models in economic analysis.
Summary
An economic variable is something measurable that can have dif-
ferent values, such as the wages of software programmers. Econo-
mists rely on economic models when they apply economic ideas 
to real-world problems. Economic models are simplified versions 
of reality used to analyze real-world economic situations. Econo-
mists accept and use an economic model if it leads to hypotheses 
that are confirmed by statistical analysis. In many cases, the ac-
ceptance is tentative, however, pending the gathering of new data 
or further statistical analysis. Economics is a social science because 
it applies the scientific method to the study of the interactions 
among individuals. Economics is concerned with positive analy-
sis rather than normative analysis. Positive analysis is concerned 
with what is. Normative analysis is concerned with what ought to 
be. Because economics is based on studying the actions of individ-
uals, it is a social science. As a social science, economics considers 
human behavior in every context of decision making, not just in 
business.

ful economic model.
 
3.3 What is the difference between normative analysis and 
positive analysis? Is economics concerned mainly with nor-
mative analysis or with positive analysis? Briefly explain.
Problems and Applications
 
3.4 Do you agree with the following assertion: “The problem 
with economics is that it assumes that consumers and 
firms always make the correct decision. But we know ev-
eryone’s human, and we all make mistakes.”
 
3.5 Suppose an economist develops an economic model and 
finds that “it works great in theory, but it fails in practice.” 
What should the economist do next?
 
3.6 Dr. Strangelove’s theory is that the price of mushrooms is 
determined by the activity of subatomic particles that exist 
in another universe parallel to ours. When the subatomic

particles are emitted in profusion, the price of mushrooms is 
high. When subatomic particle emissions are low, the price of 
mushrooms is also low. How would you go about testing Dr. 
Strangelove’s theory? Discuss whether this  theory is useful.
 
3.7 [Related to the Making the Connection on page 15] The 
Making the Connection explains that there are both positive 
and normative elements to the debate over whether medi-
cal schools should charge tuition and whether hospitals 
should continue to pay residents who pursue primary care 
but not residents who specialize. What economic statistics 
would be most useful in evaluating the positive elements in 
this debate? Assuming that these statistics are available or 
could be gathered, are they likely to resolve the normative 
issues in this debate?
 
3.8 [Related to the Chapter Opener on page 3] In recent 
years, many doctors have decided to give up running their 
practices as small businesses and have become salaried 
employees of hospitals.
 
a. What important differences exist between doctors’ 
practices and other small businesses, such as restau-
rants and hardware stores?
 
b. How have the economic incentives for operating a pri-
vate practice as opposed to becoming a salaried em-
ployee of a hospital changed over the years for doctors?
 
3.9 [Related to the Don’t Let This Happen to You on page 15] 
Explain which of the following statements represent posi-
tive analysis and which represent normative analysis.
 
a. A 50-cent-per-pack tax on cigarettes will lead to a 
12 percent reduction in smoking by teenagers.
 
b. The federal government should spend more on AIDS 
research.
 
c. Rising paper prices will increase textbook prices.
 
d. The price of coffee at Starbucks is too high.
 3.10 In the United States, to receive a medical license, a doctor 
must complete a residency program at a hospital. Hospitals 
are not free to expand their residency programs in a partic-
ular medical specialty without approval from a Residency 
Review Committee (RRC), which is made up of physi-
cians in that specialty. A hospital that does not abide by 
the rulings of the RRC runs the risk of losing its accredita-
tion from the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical 
Education (ACGME). The ACGME and the RRCs argue 
that this system makes it possible to ensure that residency 
programs do not expand to the point where they are not 
providing residents with high-quality training.
 
a. How does this system help protect consumers?
 
b. How might this system protect the financial interests of 
doctors more than the well-being of consumers?
 
c. Briefly discuss whether you consider this system to be a 
good one.

Summary
Microeconomics is the study of how households and firms make 
choices, how they interact in markets, and how the government 
attempts to influence their choices. Macroeconomics is the study 
of the economy as a whole, including topics such as inflation, 
 unemployment, and economic growth.

Appendix
Using Graphs and Formulas
Graphs are used to illustrate key economic ideas. Graphs appear not just in economics 
textbooks but also on Web sites and in newspaper and magazine articles that discuss 
events in business and economics. Why the heavy use of graphs? Because they serve two 
useful purposes: (1) They simplify economic ideas, and (2) they make the ideas more 
concrete so they can be applied to real-world problems. Economic and business issues 
can be complicated, but a graph can help cut through complications and highlight the 
key relationships needed to understand the issue. In that sense, a graph can be like a 
street map.
For example, suppose you take a bus to New York City to see the Empire State 
Building. After arriving at the Port Authority Bus Terminal, you will probably use a map 
similar to the one shown below to find your way to the Empire State Building.
Maps are very familiar to just about everyone, so we don’t usually think of them as 
being simplified versions of reality, but they are. This map does not show much more 
than the streets in this part of New York City and some of the most important build-
ings. The names, addresses, and telephone numbers of the people who live and work 
in the area aren’t given. Almost none of the stores and buildings those people work 
and live in are shown either. The map doesn’t indicate which streets allow curbside 
parking and which don’t. In fact, the map shows almost nothing about the messy real-
ity of life in this section of New York City, except how the streets are laid out, which is 
the essential information you need to get from the Port Authority to the Empire State 
Building.

Think about someone who says, “I know how to get around in the city, but I just 
can’t figure out how to read a map.” It certainly is possible to find your destination in a 
city without a map, but it’s a lot easier with one. The same is true of using graphs in eco-
nomics. It is possible to arrive at a solution to a real-world problem in economics and 
business without using graphs, but it is usually a lot easier if you do use them.
Often, the difficulty students have with graphs and formulas is a lack of familiarity. 
With practice, all the graphs and formulas in this text will become familiar to you. Once 
you are familiar with them, you will be able to use them to analyze problems that would 
otherwise seem very difficult. What follows is a brief review of how graphs and formulas 
are used.
Graphs of One Variable
Figure 1A.1 displays values for market shares in the U.S. automobile market, using 
two common types of graphs. Market shares show the percentage of industry sales ac-
counted for by different firms. In this case, the information is for groups of firms: the 
“Big Three”—Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler—as well as Japanese firms, European 
firms, and Korean firms. Panel (a) displays the information on market shares as a bar 
graph, where the market share of each group of firms is represented by the height of its 
bar. Panel (b) displays the same information as a pie chart, with the market share of each 
group of firms represented by the size of its slice of the pie.
Information on economic variables is also often displayed in time-series graphs. 
Time-series graphs are displayed on a coordinate grid. In a coordinate grid, we can mea-
sure the value of one variable along the vertical axis (or y-axis) and the value of another 
variable along the horizontal axis (or x-axis). The point where the vertical axis intersects 
the horizontal axis is called the origin. At the origin, the value of both variables is zero. 
The points on a coordinate grid represent values of the two variables. In Figure 1A.2, we 
measure the number of automobiles and trucks sold worldwide by Ford Motor Com-
pany on the vertical axis, and we measure time on the horizontal axis. In time-series

Values for an economic variable are often displayed as a bar graph or as a pie chart. 
In this case, panel (a) shows market share data for the U.S. automobile industry as 
a bar graph, where the market share of each group of firms is represented by the 
height of its bar. Panel (b) displays the same information as a pie chart, with the 
market share of each group of firms represented by the size of its slice of the pie.

C H A P T E R  1  Economics: Foundations and Models 
graphs, the height of the line at each date shows the value of the variable measured on 
the vertical axis. Both panels of Figure 1A.2 show Ford’s worldwide sales during each 
year from 2001 to 2010. The difference between panel (a) and panel (b) illustrates the 
importance of the scale used in a time-series graph. In panel (a), the scale on the ver-
tical axis is truncated, which means it does not start with zero. The slashes (//) near 
the bottom of the axis indicate that the scale is truncated. In panel (b), the scale is not 
truncated. In panel (b), the decline in Ford’s sales during 2008 and 2009 appears smaller 
than in panel (a). (Technically, the horizontal axis is also truncated because we start 
with the year 2001, not the year 0.)
Graphs of Two Variables
We often use graphs to show the relationship between two variables. For example, sup-
pose you are interested in the relationship between the price of a pepperoni pizza and 
the quantity of pizzas sold per week in the small town of Bryan, Texas. A graph showing 
the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity of the good demanded 
at each price is called a demand curve. (As we will discuss later, in drawing a demand 
curve for a good, we have to hold constant any variables other than price that might af-
fect the willingness of consumers to buy the good.) Figure 1A.3 shows the data collected 
on price and quantity. The figure shows a two-dimensional grid on which we measure 
the price of pizza along the y-axis and the quantity of pizza sold per week along the 
x-axis. Each point on the grid represents one of the price and quantity combinations 
listed in the table. We can connect the points to form the demand curve for pizza in 
Bryan, Texas. Notice that the scales on both axes in the graph are truncated. In this case, 
truncating the axes allows the graph to illustrate more clearly the relationship between 
price and quantity by excluding low prices and quantities.
 Figure 1A.2  Time-Series Graphs
Both panels present time-series graphs of Ford Motor Company’s worldwide sales during each year from 2001 to 2010. Panel (a) has a truncated scale on the vertical axis, 
and panel (b) does not. As a result, the fluctuations in Ford’s sales appear smaller in panel (b) than in panel (a).

Slopes of Lines
Once you have plotted the data in Figure 1A.3, you may be interested in how much 
the quantity of pizza sold increases as the price decreases. The slope of a line tells us 
how much the variable we are measuring on the y-axis changes as the variable we are 
measuring on the x-axis changes. We can use the Greek letter delta (D) to stand for the 
change in a variable. The slope is sometimes referred to as the rise over the run. So, we 
have several ways of expressing slope:
Slope =
Change in value on the vertical axis
Change in value on the horizontal axis = Dy
Dx = Rise
Run.
Figure 1A.4 reproduces the graph from Figure 1A.3. Because the slope of a straight 
line is the same at any point, we can use any two points in the figure to calculate the 
slope of the line. For example, when the price of pizza decreases from $14 to $12, the 
quantity of pizza sold increases from 55 per week to 65 per week. Therefore, the slope is:
Slope =
DPrice of pizza
DQuantity of pizza = (+12 - +14)
(65 - 55)
= -2
10 = -0.2.
The slope of this line gives us some insight into how responsive consumers in Bryan, 
Texas, are to changes in the price of pizza. The larger the value of the slope (ignoring the 
negative sign), the steeper the line will be, which indicates that not many additional piz-
zas are sold when the price falls. The smaller the value of the slope, the flatter the line 
will be, which indicates a greater increase in pizzas sold when the price falls.
Taking into Account More Than Two Variables 
on a Graph
The demand curve graph in Figure 1A.4 shows the relationship between the price of 
pizza and the quantity of pizza demanded, but we know that the quantity of any good 
demanded depends on more than just the price of the good. For example, the quantity

As you learned in Figure 1A-2, the slashes (//) indicate that the scales on the axes
are truncated, which means that numbers are omitted: On the horizontal axis
numbers jump from 0 to 50, and on the vertical axis numbers jump from 0 to 11.
 Figure 1A.3
Plotting Price and Quantity 
Points in a Graph
The figure shows a two-dimensional grid on 
which we measure the price of pizza along 
the vertical axis (or y-axis) and the quantity 
of pizza sold per week along the horizontal 
axis (or x-axis). Each point on the grid rep-
resents one of the price and quantity combi-
nations listed in the table. By connecting the 
points with a line, we can better illustrate the 
relationship between the two variables.

30 
C H A P T E R  1  Economics: Foundations and Models 
of pizza demanded in a given week in Bryan, Texas, can be affected by other variables, 
such as the price of hamburgers, whether an advertising campaign by local pizza parlors 
has begun that week, and so on. Allowing the values of any other variables to change 
will cause the position of the demand curve in the graph to change.
Suppose, for example, that the demand curve in Figure 1A.4 were drawn holding 
the price of hamburgers constant, at $1.50. If the price of hamburgers rises to $2.00, 
some consumers will switch from buying hamburgers to buying pizza, and more pizzas 
will be demanded at every price. The result on the graph will be to shift the line repre-
senting the demand curve to the right. Similarly, if the price of hamburgers falls from 
$1.50 to $1.00, some consumers will switch from buying pizza to buying hamburgers, 
and fewer pizzas will be demanded at every price. The result on the graph will be to shift 
the line representing the demand curve to the left.
The table in Figure 1A.5 shows the effect of a change in the price of hamburgers on 
the quantity of pizza demanded. For example, suppose that at first we are on the line 
labeled Demand curve1. If the price of pizza is $14 (point A), an increase in the price of 
hamburgers from $1.50 to $2.00 increases the quantity of pizzas demanded from 55 to 
60 per week (point B) and shifts us to Demand curve2. Or, if we start on Demand curve1 
and the price of pizza is $12 (point C), a decrease in the price of hamburgers from $1.50 
to $1.00 decreases the quantity of pizzas demanded from 65 to 60 per week (point D) 
and shifts us to Demand curve3. By shifting the demand curve, we have taken into ac-
count the effect of changes in the value of a third variable—the price of hamburgers. We 
will use this technique of shifting curves to allow for the effects of additional variables 
many times in this book.
Positive and Negative Relationships
We can use graphs to show the relationships between any two variables. Sometimes the 
relationship between the variables is negative, meaning that as one variable increases 
in value, the other variable decreases in value. This was the case with the price of pizza 
and the quantity of pizzas demanded. The relationship between two variables can also 
be positive, meaning that the values of both variables increase or decrease together. For 
example, when the level of total income—or disposable personal income—received by 
households in the United States increases, the level of total consumption spending, which 
is spending by households on goods and services, also increases. The table in Figure  1A.6  
shows the values (in billions of dollars) for income and consumption spending for the 
years 2007–2010. The graph plots the data from the table, with disposable personal in-
come measured along the horizontal axis and consumption spending measured along 
the vertical axis. Notice that the four points do not all fall exactly on the line. This is 
often the case with real-world data. To examine the relationship between two variables, 
economists often use the straight line that best fits the data.

Calculating the Slope of a Line
We can calculate the slope of a line as the 
change in the value of the variable on the 
y-axis divided by the change in the value of 
the variable on the x-axis. Because the slope 
of a straight line is constant, we can use any 
two points in the figure to calculate the slope 
of the line. For example, when the price of 
pizza decreases from $14 to $12, the quan-
tity of pizza demanded increases from 55 per 
week to 65 per week. So, the slope of this line 
equals 22 divided by 10, or 20.2.

lationship between the price of pizzas and 
the quantity of pizzas demanded, holding 
constant other factors that might affect 
the willingness of consumers to buy pizza. 
If the price of pizza is $14 (point A), an in-
crease in the price of hamburgers from $1.50 
to $2.00 increases the quantity of pizzas de-
manded from 55 to 60 per week (point B) 
and shifts us to Demand curve2. Or, if we 
start on Demand curve1 and the price of 
pizza is $12 (point C), a decrease in the price 
of hamburgers from $1.50 to $1.00 decreases 
the quantity of pizza demanded from 65 to 
60 per week (point D) and shifts us to De-
mand curve3.
Determining Cause and Effect
When we graph the relationship between two variables, we often want to draw conclu-
sions about whether changes in one variable are causing changes in the other variable. 
Doing so, however, can lead to incorrect conclusions. For example, suppose you graph 
the number of homes in a neighborhood that have a fire burning in the fireplace and

the other variable also increases. This figure 
shows the positive relationship between dis-
posable personal income and consumption 
spending. As disposable personal income in 
the United States has increased, so has con-
sumption spending.

the number of leaves on trees in the neighborhood. You would get a relationship like 
that shown in panel (a) of Figure 1A.7: The more fires burning in the neighborhood, 
the fewer leaves the trees have. Can we draw the conclusion from this graph that using 
a fireplace causes trees to lose their leaves? We know, of course, that such a conclusion 
would be incorrect. In spring and summer, there are relatively few fireplaces being used, 
and the trees are full of leaves. In the fall, as trees begin to lose their leaves, fireplaces 
are used more frequently. And in winter, many fireplaces are being used and many trees 
have lost all their leaves. The reason that the graph in Figure 1A.7 is misleading about 
cause and effect is that there is obviously an omitted variable in the analysis—the season 
of the year. An omitted variable is one that affects other variables, and its omission can 
lead to false conclusions about cause and effect.
Although in our example the omitted variable is obvious, there are many debates 
about cause and effect where the existence of an omitted variable has not been clear. 
For instance, it has been known for many years that people who smoke cigarettes suffer 
from higher rates of lung cancer than do nonsmokers. For some time, tobacco compa-
nies and some scientists argued that there was an omitted variable—perhaps a failure to 
exercise or a poor diet—that made some people more likely to smoke and more likely 
to develop lung cancer. If this omitted variable existed, then the finding that smokers 
were more likely to develop lung cancer would not have been evidence that smoking 
caused lung cancer. In this case, however, nearly all scientists eventually concluded that 
the omitted variable did not exist and that, in fact, smoking does cause lung cancer.
A related problem in determining cause and effect is known as reverse causality. 
The error of reverse causality occurs when we conclude that changes in variable X cause 
changes in variable Y when, in fact, it is actually changes in variable Y that cause changes 
in variable X. For example, panel (b) of Figure 1A.7 plots the number of lawn mowers 
being used in a neighborhood against the rate at which grass on lawns in the neighbor-
hood is growing. We could conclude from this graph that using lawn mowers causes the 
grass to grow faster. We know, however, that in reality, the causality is in the other direc-
tion: Rapidly growing grass during the spring and summer causes the increased use of 
lawn mowers. Slowly growing grass in the fall or winter or during periods of low rainfall 
causes decreased use of lawn mowers.
Using graphs to draw conclusions about cause and effect can be hazardous. In panel 
(a), we see that there are fewer leaves on the trees in a neighborhood when many 
homes have fires burning in their fireplaces. We cannot draw the conclusion that 
the fires cause the leaves to fall because we have an omitted variable—the season 
of the year. In panel (b), we see that more lawn mowers are used in a neighbor-
hood during times when the grass grows rapidly and fewer lawn mowers are used 
when the grass grows slowly. Concluding that using lawn mowers causes the grass 
to grow faster would be making the error of reverse causality.

 
Appendix Using Graphs and Formulas 
33
Once again, in our example, the potential error of reverse causality is obvious. In 
many economic debates, however, cause and effect can be more difficult to determine. 
For example, changes in the money supply, or the total amount of money in the econ-
omy, tend to occur at the same time as changes in the total amount of income people 
in the economy earn. A famous debate in economics was about whether the changes in 
the money supply caused the changes in total income or whether the changes in total in-
come caused the changes in the money supply. Each side in the debate accused the other 
side of committing the error of reverse causality.
Are Graphs of Economic Relationships Always 
Straight Lines?
The graphs of relationships between two economic variables that we have drawn so far 
have been straight lines. The relationship between two variables is linear when it can be 
represented by a straight line. Few economic relationships are actually linear. For ex-
ample, if we carefully plot data on the price of a product and the quantity demanded at 
each price, holding constant other variables that affect the quantity demanded, we will 
usually find a curved—or nonlinear—relationship rather than a linear relationship. In 
practice, however, it is often useful to approximate a nonlinear relationship with a linear 
relationship. If the relationship is reasonably close to being linear, the analysis is not

 Figure 1A.8  The Slope of a Nonlinear Curve
The relationship between the quantity of iPhones produced and the total cost of 
production is curved rather than linear. In panel (a), in moving from point A to 
point B, the quantity produced increases by 1 million iPhones, while the total cost 
of production increases by $50 million. Farther up the curve, as we move from 
point C to point D, the change in quantity is the same—1 million iPhones—but 
the change in the total cost of production is now much larger: $250 million.
Because the change in the y variable has increased, while the change in the x 
variable has remained the same, we know that the slope has increased. In panel (b), 
we measure the slope of the curve at a particular point by the slope of the tangent 
line. The slope of the tangent line at point B is 75, and the slope of the tangent line 
at point C is 150.

34 
C H A P T E R  1  Economics: Foundations and Models 
significantly affected. In addition, it is easier to calculate the slope of a straight line, and 
it also is easier to calculate the area under a straight line. So, in this textbook, we often 
assume that the relationship between two economic variables is linear, even when we 
know that this assumption is not precisely correct.
Slopes of Nonlinear Curves
In some situations, we need to take into account the nonlinear nature of an economic 
relationship. For example, panel (a) of Figure 1A.8 shows the hypothetical relationship 
between Apple’s total cost of producing iPhones and the quantity of iPhones produced.  
The relationship is curved rather than linear. In this case, the cost of production is in-
creasing at an increasing rate, which often happens in manufacturing. Put a different way, 
as we move up the curve, its slope becomes larger. (Remember that with a straight line, 
the slope is always constant.) To see this effect, first remember that we calculate the slope 
of a curve by dividing the change in the variable on the y-axis by the change in the vari-
able on the x-axis. As we move from point A to point B, the quantity produced increases 
by 1 million iPhones, while the total cost of production increases by $50 million. Farther 
up the curve, as we move from point C to point D, the change in quantity is the same—
1 million iPhones—but the change in the total cost of production is now much larger: 
$250 million. Because the change in the y variable has increased, while the change in the 
x variable has remained the same, we know that the slope has increased.
To measure the slope of a nonlinear curve at a particular point, we must measure 
the slope of the tangent line to the curve at that point. A tangent line will touch the curve 
only at that point. We can measure the slope of the tangent line just as we would the slope 
of any other straight line. In panel (b), the tangent line at point B has a slope equal to:
DCost
DQuantity = 75
1 = 75.
The tangent line at point C has a slope equal to:
DCost
DQuantity = 150
1
= 150.
Once again, we see that the slope of the curve is larger at point C than at point B.
Formulas
We have just seen that graphs are an important economic tool. In this section, we will 
review several useful formulas and show how to use them to summarize data and to 
calculate important relationships.
Formula for a Percentage Change
One important formula is the percentage change. The percentage change is the change 
in some economic variable, usually from one period to the next, expressed as a percent-
age. An important macroeconomic measure is the real gross domestic product (GDP). 
GDP is the value of all the final goods and services produced in a country during a year. 
“Real” GDP is corrected for the effects of inflation. When economists say that the U.S. 
economy grew 3.0 percent during 2010, they mean that real GDP was 3.0 percent higher 
in 2010 than it was in 2009. The formula for making this calculation is:
GDP2010  - GDP2009
GDP2009
* 100
or, more generally, for any two periods:
Percentage change = Value in the second period - Value in the first period
Value in the first period
* 100.

 
Appendix Using Graphs and Formulas 
35
In this case, real GDP was $12,703 billion in 2009 and $13,088 billion in 2010. So, 
the growth rate of the U.S. economy during 2010 was:
a +13,088 - +12,703
+12,703
b * 100 = 2.8%.
Notice that it doesn’t matter that in using the formula, we ignored the fact that GDP 
is measured in billions of dollars. In fact, when calculating percentage changes, the units 
don’t matter. The percentage increase from $12,703 billion to $13,088 billion is exactly 
the same as the percentage increase from $12,073 to $13,088. 
Formulas for the Areas of a Rectangle and a Triangle
Areas that form rectangles and triangles on graphs can have important economic mean-
ing. For example, Figure 1A.9 shows the demand curve for Pepsi. Suppose that the price 
is currently $2.00 and that 125,000 bottles of Pepsi are sold at that price. A firm’s total 
revenue is equal to the amount it receives from selling its product, or the quantity sold 
multiplied by the price. In this case, total revenue will equal 125,000 bottles times $2.00 
per bottle, or $250,000.
The formula for the area of a rectangle is:
Area of a rectangle = Base * Height.
In Figure 1A.9, the green-shaded rectangle also represents the firm’s total revenue be-
cause its area is given by the base of 125,000 bottles multiplied by the price of $2.00 per 
bottle.
We will see in later chapters that areas that are triangles can also have economic 
significance. The formula for the area of a triangle is:
Area of a triangle = 1
2 * Base * Height.
The blue-shaded area in Figure 1A.10 is a triangle. The base equals 150,000 2 125,000, or 
25,000. Its height equals $2.00 2 $1.50, or $0.50. Therefore, its area equals 1/2 3 25,000 3 
$0.50, or $6,250. Notice that the blue area is a triangle only if the demand curve is a straight 
line, or linear. Not all demand curves are linear. However, the formula for the area of a tri-
angle will usually still give a good approximation, even if the demand curve is not linear.
Summary of Using Formulas

 formula, you should follow these steps:

revenue is equal to the quantity of 125,000 
bottles times the price of $2.00 per bottle, or 
$250,000. The area of the green-shaded rect-
angle shows the firm’s total revenue.

 3. Make sure the number you calculate using the formula is economically reasonable. 
For example, if you are using a formula to calculate a firm’s revenue and your an-

Economics in Your Life
The Trade-offs When You Buy a Car
When you buy a car, you probably consider factors such as safety and fuel efficiency. To increase 
fuel efficiency, automobile manufacturers make cars small and light. Large cars absorb more of the 
impact of an accident than do small cars. As a result, people are usually safer driving large cars than 
small cars. What can we conclude from these facts about the relationship between safety and fuel 
efficiency? Under what circumstances would it be possible for automobile manufacturers to make 
cars safer and more fuel efficient? As you read the chapter, see if you can answer these questions. 
You can check your answers against those provided on page 58 at the end of this chapter.
technical training. By building factories in 
other countries, BMW can benefit from 
paying lower wages and can reduce po-
litical friction by producing vehicles in the 
same country in which it sells them. BMW 
opened a plant in Shenyang, in northeast 
China and a plant in Chennai in India. It 
also opened a U.S. factory in Spartanburg, 
South Carolina, which currently produces 
the X3, X5, and X6 models for sale both in 
the United States and worldwide.
Managers also face smaller-scale—or 
tactical—business decisions. For instance, 
in scheduling production at BMW’s Spar-
tanburg plant, managers must decide each 
month the quantity of X3, X5, and X6 mod-
els to produce. Like other decisions man-
agers make, this one involves a trade-off: 
Producing more of one of these three mod-
els means producing fewer of the others.
AN INSIDE LOOK on page 60 dis-
cusses the trade-off GM faces when de-
ciding how to allocate resources between 
producing powertrains for its two  electric 
cars—the Chevy Volt and the Cadillac 
Converj.

Soars,” The Wall Street Journal, May 4, 2011; and BMW, 
Annual Report, 2010.
When you think of cars that combine fine 
engineering, high performance, and cutting-
edge styling, you are likely to think of BMW. 
Founded in Germany in 1916, BMW today 
has 23 factories in 15 countries and world-
wide sales of more than 1.5 million cars.
To compete in the automobile market, 
the managers of BMW must make many stra-
tegic decisions, such as whether to introduce 
new car models. BMW has begun selling a 
hydrogen-powered version of the 7-Series se-
dan and is also working on fuel cell–powered 
cars. Another strategic decision BMW’s man-
agers face is where to advertise. Although 
some of BMW’s managers did not believe 
the company could sell cars in China, BMW 
decided to advertise heavily there. The adver-
tising paid off: China has become the com-
pany’s third-largest market, after Germany 
and the United States, with sales increasing 
by more than 85 percent in 2010 alone.
BMW’s managers have also faced the 
strategic decision of whether to concen-
trate production in factories in Germany or 
to build new factories in overseas markets. 
Keeping production in Germany makes 
it easier for BMW’s managers to super-
vise production and to employ German 
workers, who generally have high levels of

C H A P T E R  2  Trade-offs, Comparative Advantage, and the Market System 
I
n a market system, managers at most firms must make decisions like those made by 
BMW’s managers. The decisions managers face reflect a key fact of economic life: 
Scarcity requires trade-offs. Scarcity exists because we have unlimited wants but 
only limited resources available to fulfill those wants. Goods and services are scarce. 
So, too, are the economic resources, or factors of production—workers, capital, natural re-
sources, and entrepreneurial ability—used to make goods and services. Your time is scarce, 
which means you face trade-offs: If you spend an hour studying for an economics exam, you 
have one less hour to spend studying for a psychology exam or going to the movies. If your 
university decides to use some of its scarce budget to buy new computers for the computer 
labs, those funds will not be available to buy new books for the library or to resurface the 
student parking lot. If BMW decides to devote some of the scarce workers and machinery in 
its Spartanburg assembly plant to producing more X6 hybrid cars, those resources will not 
be available to produce more X5 SUVs.
Households and firms make many of their decisions in markets. Trade is a key activity 
that takes place in markets. Trade involves the decisions of millions of households and firms 
spread around the world. By engaging in trade, people can raise their standard of living. In 
this chapter, we provide an overview of how the market system coordinates the independent 
decisions of these millions of households and firms. We begin our analysis of the economic 
consequences of scarcity and the working of the market system by introducing an important 
economic model: the production possibilities frontier.
Production Possibilities Frontiers 
and Opportunity Costs
As we saw in the chapter opener, BMW operates an automobile factory in Spartanburg, 
South Carolina, where it assembles several car models. Because the firm’s resources—
workers, machinery, materials, and entrepreneurial skills—are limited, BMW faces 
a trade-off: Resources devoted to producing one model are not available for produc-
ing other models. Chapter 1 explained that economic models can be useful in ana-
lyzing many questions. We can use a simple model called the production possibilities 
frontier to analyze the trade-offs BMW faces in its Spartanburg plant. A production 
 possibilities frontier (PPF) is a curve showing the maximum attainable combinations 
of two products that may be produced with available resources and current technology. 
In BMW’s case, we simplify by assuming that the company produces only X6 hybrids 
and X5 SUVs at the Spartanburg plant, using workers, materials, robots, and other 
machinery.
Graphing the Production Possibilities Frontier
Figure 2.1 uses a production possibilities frontier to illustrate the trade-offs that BMW 
faces. The numbers from the table are plotted in the graph. The line in the graph is 
BMW’s production possibilities frontier. If BMW uses all its resources to produce 
hybrids, it can produce 800 per day—point A at one end of the production possibili-
ties frontier. If BMW uses all its resources to produce SUVs, it can produce 800 per 
day—point E at the other end of the production possibilities frontier. If BMW devotes 
resources to producing both vehicles, it could be at a point like B, where it produces 
600 hybrids and 200 SUVs.
All the combinations either on the frontier—like A, B, C, D, and E—or inside the 
frontier—like point F—are attainable with the resources available. Combinations on 
the frontier are efficient because all available resources are being fully utilized, and the 
Scarcity A situation in which 
unlimited wants exceed the limited 
resources available to fulfill those 
wants.
2.1 LEARNING OBJECTIVE
Use a production possibilities 
frontier to analyze opportunity 
costs and trade-offs.
Production possibilities frontier 
(PPF) A curve showing the maximum 
attainable combinations of two products 
that may be produced with available 
resources and current technology.

 
Production Possibilities Frontiers and Opportunity Costs

fewest possible resources are being used to produce a given amount of output. Com-
binations inside the frontier—like point F—are inefficient because maximum output 
is not being obtained from the available resources—perhaps because the assembly 
line is not operating at capacity. BMW might like to be beyond the frontier—at a 
point like G, where it would be producing 600 hybrids and 500 SUVs—but points 
beyond the production possibilities frontier are unattainable, given the firm’s current 
resources. To produce the combination at G, BMW would need more machines or 
more workers.
Notice that if BMW is producing efficiently and is on the production possibilities 
frontier, the only way to produce more of one vehicle is to produce fewer of the other 
vehicle. Recall from Chapter 1 that the opportunity cost of any activity is the highest-
valued alternative that must be given up to engage in that activity. For BMW, the op-
portunity cost of producing one more SUV is the number of hybrids the company will 
not be able to produce because it has shifted those resources to producing SUVs. For ex-
ample, in moving from point B to point C, the opportunity cost of producing 200 more 
SUVs per day is the 200 fewer hybrids that can be produced.
What point on the production possibilities frontier is best? We can’t tell without fur-
ther information. If consumer demand for SUVs is greater than the demand for hybrids, 
the company is likely to choose a point closer to E. If demand for hybrids is greater than 
demand for SUVs, the company is likely to choose a point closer to A.

BMW faces a trade-off: To build one more 
hybrid, it must build one less SUV. The 
production possibilities frontier illustrates 
the trade-off BMW faces. Combinations on 
the production possibilities frontier—like 
points A, B, C, D, and E—are technically 
efficient because the maximum output is 
being obtained from the available resources. 
Combinations inside the frontier—like

Solving the Problem
Step 1: Review the chapter material. This problem is about using production pos-
sibilities frontiers to analyze trade-offs, so you may want to review the section 
“Graphing the Production Possibilities Frontier,” which begins on page 40.
Step 2: Answer part (a) by filling in the table. If Rosie can produce 1 cake in 1 hour, 
then with choice A, she will make 5 cakes and 0 pies. Because she can produce 
2 pies in 1 hour, with choice B, she will make 4 cakes and 2 pies. Using similar 
reasoning, you can fill in the remaining cells in the table as follows:

If Rosie devotes all 5 hours to making cakes, she will make 5 cakes. There-
fore, her production possibilities frontier will intersect the vertical axis at  
5 cakes made. If Rosie devotes all 5 hours to making pies, she will make 10 
pies. Therefore, her production possibilities frontier will intersect the hori-
zontal axis at 10 pies made.

Facing Trade-offs in Health  
Care Spending
Households have limited incomes. If the price of health care rises, 
households have to choose whether to buy less health care or 
spend less on other goods and services. The same is true of the federal 
government’s spending on health care. The government provides health 
insurance to about 30 percent of the population through programs such 
as Medicare for people over age 65 and Medicaid for low-income peo-
ple. If the price of health care rises, the government has to either cut 
back on the services provided through Medicare and Medicaid or cut 
spending in another part of the government’s budget. (Of course, both 
households and the government can borrow to pay for some of their 
spending, but ultimately the funds they can borrow are also limited.)
About 54 percent of the population has private health insur-
ance, often provided by an employer. When the fees doctors charge, 
the cost of prescription drugs, and the cost of hospital stays rise, the 
cost to employers of providing health insurance increases. As a result, 
employers will typically increase the amount they withhold from employees’ paychecks 
to pay for the insurance. Some employers—particularly small firms—will even stop of-
fering health insurance to their employees. In either case, the price  employees pay for 
health care will rise. How do people respond to rising health care costs? Isn’t health care 
a necessity that people continue to consume the same amount of, no matter how much 
its price increases? In fact, studies have shown that rising health care costs cause people 
to cut back their spending on medical services, just as people cut back their spending 
on other goods and services when their prices rise. One academic study indicates that 
for every 1 percent increase in the amount employers charge employees for insurance,

Making  
the 
Connection
Spending more on health care 
means spending less on other goods 
and services for both households 
and governments.

164,000 people become uninsured. Of course, people without health insurance can still 
visit the doctor and obtain prescriptions, but they have to pay higher prices than do people 
with insurance. Although the consequences of being uninsured can be severe,  particularly 
if someone develops a serious illness, economists are not surprised that higher prices 
for health insurance lead to less health insurance being purchased: Faced with limited  
incomes, people have to make choices among the goods and services they buy.
The Congressional Budget Office estimates that as the U.S. population ages and 
medical costs continue to rise, federal government spending on Medicare will more than 
double over the next 10 years. Many policymakers are concerned that this rapid increase 
in Medicare spending will force a reduction in spending on other government programs. 
Daniel Callahan, a researcher at the Hastings Center for Bioethics, has argued that policy-
makers should consider taking some dramatic steps, such as having Medicare stop paying 
for open-heart surgery and other expensive treatments for people over 80 years of age. 
Callahan argues that the costs of open-heart surgery and similar treatments for the very 
old exceed the benefits, and the funds would be better spent on treatments for younger 
 patients, where the benefits would exceed the costs. Spending less on prolonging the lives 
of the very old in order to save resources that can be used for other purposes is a very pain-
ful trade-off to consider. But in a world of scarcity, trade-offs of some kind are inevitable.

Increasing Marginal Opportunity Costs
We can use the production possibilities frontier to explore issues concerning the econ-
omy as a whole. For example, suppose we divide all the goods and services produced in 
the economy into just two types: military goods and civilian goods. In Figure 2.2, we 
let tanks represent military goods and automobiles represent civilian goods. If all the 
country’s resources are devoted to producing military goods, 400 tanks can be produced 
in one year. If all resources are devoted to producing civilian goods, 500 automobiles 
can be produced in one year. Devoting resources to producing both goods results in the 
economy being at other points along the production possibilities frontier.
Notice that this production possibilities frontier is bowed outward rather than be-
ing a straight line. Because the curve is bowed out, the opportunity cost of automobiles 
in terms of tanks depends on where the economy currently is on the production possi-
bilities frontier. For example, to increase automobile production from 0 to 200— moving 
from point A to point B—the economy has to give up only 50 tanks. But to increase

Increasing Marginal 
Opportunity Costs
As the economy moves down the produc-
tion possibilities frontier, it experiences 
increasing marginal opportunity costs be-
cause increasing automobile production by 
a given quantity requires larger and larger 
decreases in tank production. For example, 
to increase automobile production from 0 to 
200—moving from point A to point B—the 
economy has to give up only 50 tanks. But to 
increase automobile production by another 
200 vehicles—moving from point B to point 
C—the economy has to give up 150 tanks.

Production Possibilities Frontiers and Opportunity Costs  
45
automobile production by another 200 vehicles—moving from point B to point C—the 
economy has to give up 150 tanks.
As the economy moves down the production possibilities frontier, it experiences  
increasing marginal opportunity costs because increasing automobile production by a given 
quantity requires larger and larger decreases in tank production. Increasing marginal op-
portunity costs occur because some workers, machines, and other resources are better 
suited to one use than to another. At point A, some resources that are well suited to pro-
ducing automobiles are forced to produce tanks. Shifting these resources into producing 
automobiles by moving from point A to point B allows a substantial increase in automobile 
production, without much loss of tank production. But as the economy moves down the 
production possibilities frontier, more and more resources that are better suited to tank pro-
duction are switched into automobile production. As a result, the increases in automobile 
production become increasingly smaller, while the decreases in tank production become 
increasingly larger. We would expect in most situations that production possibilities fron-
tiers will be bowed outward rather than linear, as in the BMW example discussed earlier.
The idea of increasing marginal opportunity costs illustrates an important eco-
nomic concept: The more resources already devoted to an activity, the smaller the payoff 
to devoting additional resources to that activity. For example, the more hours you have 
already spent studying economics, the smaller the increase in your test grade from each 
additional hour you spend—and the greater the opportunity cost of using the hour in 
that way. The more funds a firm has devoted to research and development during a 
given year, the smaller the amount of useful knowledge it receives from each additional 
dollar—and the greater the opportunity cost of using the funds in that way. The more 
funds the federal government spends cleaning up the environment during a given year, 
the smaller the reduction in pollution from each additional dollar—and, once again, the 
greater the opportunity cost of using the funds in that way.
Economic Growth
At any given time, the total resources available to any economy are fixed. Therefore, 
if the United States produces more automobiles, it must produce less of something 
else—tanks in our example. Over time, though, the resources available to an economy 
may increase. For example, both the labor force and the capital stock—the amount of 
physical capital available in the country—may increase. The increase in the available 
labor force and the capital stock shifts the production possibilities frontier outward for 
the U.S. economy and makes it possible to produce both more automobiles and more

 Figure 2.3  Economic Growth
Panel (a) shows that as more economic resources become available and techno-
logical change occurs, the economy can move from point A to point B, producing 
more tanks and more automobiles. Panel (b) shows the results of technological 
change in the automobile industry that increases the quantity of vehicles workers 
can produce per year while leaving unchanged the maximum quantity of tanks 
that can be produced. Shifts in the production possibilities frontier represent 
 economic growth.

tanks. Panel (a) of Figure 2.3 shows that the economy can move from point A to point B, 
producing more tanks and more automobiles.
Similarly, technological change makes it possible to produce more goods with the 
same number of workers and the same amount of machinery, which also shifts the pro-
duction possibilities frontier outward. Technological change need not affect all sectors 
equally. Panel (b) of Figure 2.3 shows the results of technological change in the automo-
bile industry that increases the quantity of automobiles workers can produce per year 
while leaving unchanged the quantity of tanks that can be produced.
Shifts in the production possibilities frontier represent economic growth because 
they allow the economy to increase the production of goods and services, which ulti-
mately raises the standard of living. In the United States and other high-income coun-
tries, the market system has aided the process of economic growth, which over the past 
200 years has greatly increased the well-being of the average person.
Comparative Advantage and Trade
We can use the ideas of production possibilities frontiers and opportunity costs to un-
derstand the basic economic activity of trade. Markets are fundamentally about trade, 
which is the act of buying and selling. Sometimes we trade directly, as when children 
trade one baseball card for another baseball card. But often we trade indirectly: We sell 
our labor services as, say, an accountant, a salesperson, or a nurse for money, and then 
we use the money to buy goods and services. Although in these cases, trade takes place 
indirectly, ultimately the accountant, salesperson, or nurse is trading his or her services 
for food, clothing, and other goods and services. One of the great benefits of trade is 
that it makes it possible for people to become better off by increasing both their produc-
tion and their consumption.
Specialization and Gains from Trade
Consider the following situation: You and your neighbor both have fruit trees on your 
property. Initially, suppose you have only apple trees and your neighbor has only cherry 
trees. In this situation, if you both like apples and cherries, there is an obvious opportu-
nity for both of you to gain from trade: You trade some of your apples for some of your 
neighbor’s cherries, making you both better off. But what if there are apple and cherry 
trees growing on both of your properties? In that case, there can still be gains from 
trade. For example, your neighbor might be very good at picking apples, and you might 
be very good at picking cherries. It would make sense for your neighbor to concentrate 
on picking apples and for you to concentrate on picking cherries. You can then trade 
some of the cherries you pick for some of the apples your neighbor picks. But what if 
your neighbor is actually better at picking both apples and cherries than you are?
We can use production possibilities frontiers (PPFs) to show how your neighbor can 
benefit from trading with you even though she is better than you are at picking both apples 
and cherries. (For simplicity, and because it will not have any effect on the conclusions we 
draw, we will assume that the PPFs in this example are straight lines.) The table in Fig-
ure 2.4 shows how many apples and how many cherries you and your neighbor can pick 
in one week. The graph in the figure uses the data from the table to construct PPFs. Panel 
(a) shows your PPF. If you devote all your time to picking apples, you can pick 20 pounds 
of apples per week. If you devote all your time to picking cherries, you can pick 20 pounds 
per week. Panel (b) shows that if your neighbor devotes all her time to picking apples, she 
can pick 30 pounds. If she devotes all her time to picking cherries, she can pick 60 pounds.
The production possibilities frontiers in Figure 2.4 show how many apples and cher-
ries you and your neighbor can consume, without trade. Suppose that when you don’t 
trade with your neighbor, you pick and consume 8 pounds of apples and 12 pounds of 
cherries per week. This combination of apples and cherries is represented by point A 
in panel (a) of Figure 2.5. When your neighbor doesn’t trade with you, she picks and 
consumes 9 pounds of apples and 42 pounds of cherries per week. This combination of 
apples and cherries is represented by point C in panel (b) of Figure 2.5.

this offer? You should accept because you will end up with more apples and more cher-
ries to consume. To take advantage of her proposal, you should specialize in picking 
only apples rather than splitting your time between picking apples and picking cher-
ries. We know this will allow you to pick 20 pounds of apples. You can trade 10 pounds

 Figure 2.5  Gains from Trade
When you don’t trade with your neighbor, you pick and consume 8 pounds of 
apples and 12 pounds of cherries per week—point A in panel (a). When your 
neighbor doesn’t trade with you, she picks and consumes 9 pounds of apples and 
42 pounds of cherries per week—point C in panel (b). If you specialize in picking 
apples, you can pick 20 pounds. If your neighbor specializes in picking cherries, 
she can pick 60 pounds. If you trade 10 pounds of your apples for 15 pounds of 
your neighbor’s cherries, you will be able to consume 10 pounds of apples and  
15 pounds of cherries—point B in panel (a). Your neighbor can now consume 
10 pounds of apples and 45 pounds of cherries—point D in panel (b). You and 
your neighbor are both better off as a result of the trade.

C H A P T E R  2  Trade-offs, Comparative Advantage, and the Market System 
of apples to your neighbor for 15 pounds of her cherries. The result is that you will be 
able to consume 10 pounds of apples and 15 pounds of cherries (point B in panel (a) of 
Figure 2.5). You are clearly better off as a result of trading with your neighbor: You now 
can consume 2 more pounds of apples and 3 more pounds of cherries than you were 
consuming without trading. You have moved beyond your PPF!
Your neighbor has also benefited from the trade. By specializing in picking only 
cherries, she can pick 60 pounds. She trades 15 pounds of cherries to you for 10 pounds 
of apples. The result is that she can consume 10 pounds of apples and 45 pounds of 
cherries (point D in panel (b) of Figure 2.5). This is 1 more pound of apples and 3 more 
pounds of cherries than she was consuming before trading with you. She also has moved 
beyond her PPF. Table 2.1 summarizes the changes in production and consumption that 
result from your trade with your neighbor. (In this example, we chose one specific rate 
of trading cherries for apples—15 pounds of cherries for 10 pounds of apples. There are, 
however, many other rates of trading cherries for apples that would also make you and 
your neighbor better off.)
Absolute Advantage versus  
Comparative Advantage
Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of the preceding example is that your neighbor 
benefits from trading with you even though she is better than you at picking both apples 
and cherries. Absolute advantage is the ability of an individual, a firm, or a country 
to produce more of a good or service than competitors, using the same amount of re-
sources. Your neighbor has an absolute advantage over you in producing both apples 
and cherries because she can pick more of each fruit than you can in the same amount 
of time. Although it seems that your neighbor should pick her own apples and her 
own cherries, we have just seen that she is better off specializing in cherry picking and 
 leaving the apple picking to you.
We can consider further why both you and your neighbor benefit from specializ-
ing in picking only one fruit. First, think about the opportunity cost to each of you of 
picking the two fruits. We saw from the PPF in Figure 2.4 that if you devoted all your 
time to picking apples, you would be able to pick 20 pounds of apples per week. As you 
move down your PPF and shift time away from picking apples to picking cherries, you 
have to give up 1 pound of apples for each pound of cherries you pick (the slope of your 
PPF is 21. For a review of calculating slopes, see the appendix to Chapter 1.) Therefore, 
your opportunity cost of picking 1 pound of cherries is 1 pound of apples. By the same 
reasoning, your opportunity cost of picking 1 pound of apples is 1 pound of cherries. 
Your neighbor’s PPF has a different slope, so she faces a different trade-off: As she shifts 
time from picking apples to picking cherries, she has to give up 0.5 pound of apples for 
every 1 pound of cherries she picks (the slope of your neighbor’s PPF is −0.5). As she 
shifts time from picking cherries to picking apples, she gives up 2 pounds of cherries for 
every 1 pound of apples she picks. Therefore, her opportunity cost of picking 1 pound of 
apples is 2 pounds of cherries, and her opportunity cost of picking 1 pound of cherries 
is 0.5 pound of apples.

an individual, a firm, or a country to 
produce more of a good or service 
than competitors, using the same

Table 2.2 summarizes the opportunity costs for you and your neighbor of picking 
apples and cherries. Note that even though your neighbor can pick more apples in a 
week than you can, the opportunity cost of picking apples is higher for her than for you 
because when she picks apples, she gives up more cherries than you do. So, even though 
she has an absolute advantage over you in picking apples, it is more costly for her to pick 
apples than it is for you. The table also shows that her opportunity cost of picking cher-
ries is lower than your opportunity cost of picking cherries. Comparative advantage is 
the ability of an individual, a firm, or a country to produce a good or service at a lower 
opportunity cost than competitors. In apple picking, your neighbor has an absolute ad-
vantage over you, but you have a comparative advantage over her. Your neighbor has 
both an absolute advantage and a comparative advantage over you in picking cherries. 
As we have seen, you are better off specializing in picking apples, and your neighbor is 
better off specializing in picking cherries.
Comparative Advantage and the Gains from Trade
We have just derived an important economic principle: The basis for trade is com-
parative advantage, not absolute advantage. The fastest apple pickers do not nec-
essarily do much apple picking. If the fastest apple pickers have a comparative 
advantage in some other activity—picking cherries, playing Major League Baseball, 
or being industrial engineers—they are better off specializing in that other activ-
ity. Individuals, firms, and countries are better off if they specialize in producing 
goods and services for which they have a comparative advantage and obtain the 
other goods and services they need by trading. We will return to the important 
concept of comparative advantage in Chapter 9, which is devoted to the subject of 
international trade.

ability of an individual, a firm, or a 
country to produce a good or service

Don’t Confuse Absolute Advantage  
and Comparative Advantage
First, make sure you know the definitions:
•  Absolute advantage. The ability of an individual, a firm, 
or a country to produce more of a good or service than 
competitors, using the same amount of resources. In our 
example, your neighbor has an absolute advantage over 
you in both picking apples and picking cherries.
•  Comparative advantage. The ability of an individual, 
a firm, or a country to produce a good or service at a 
lower opportunity cost than competitors. In our ex-
ample, your neighbor has a comparative advantage in 
picking cherries, but you have a comparative advantage 
in  picking apples.
Keep these two key points in mind:
1.  It is possible to have an absolute advantage in produc-
ing a good or service without having a comparative 
advantage. This is the case with your neighbor picking 
apples.
2.  It is possible to have a comparative advantage in pro-
ducing a good or service without having an absolute 
advantage. This is the case with your picking apples.

Solving the Problem
Step 1: Review the chapter material. This problem is about comparative advantage, 
so you may want to review the section “Absolute Advantage versus Compara-
tive Advantage,” which begins on page 48.
Step 2: Answer part (a) by calculating who has a comparative advantage in each activ-
ity. Remember that a country has a comparative advantage in producing a good 
if it can produce the good at the lowest opportunity cost. When Canada produces 
1 more ton of honey, it produces 1.5 tons less of maple syrup. When the United 
States produces 1 more ton of honey, it produces 1 ton less of maple syrup. There-
fore, the United States’ opportunity cost of producing honey—1 ton of maple 
syrup—is lower than Canada’s—1.5 tons of maple syrup. When Canada produces 
1 more ton of maple syrup, it produces 0.67 ton less of honey. When the United 
States produces 1 more ton of maple syrup, it produces 1 ton less of honey. There-
fore, Canada’s opportunity cost of producing maple syrup—0.67 ton of honey—is 
lower than that of the United States—1 ton of honey. We can conclude that the 
United States has a comparative advantage in the production of honey and Can-
ada has a comparative advantage in the production of maple syrup.
Step 3: Answer part (b) by showing that specialization makes Canada and the 
United States better off. We know that Canada should specialize where it has 
a comparative advantage, and the United States should specialize where it has 
a comparative advantage. If both countries specialize, Canada will produce  
60 tons of maple syrup and 0 tons of honey, and the United States will produce 
0 tons of maple syrup and 50 tons of honey. After both countries specialize, 
the United States could then trade 30 tons of honey to Canada in exchange for 
40 tons of maple syrup. (Other mutually beneficial trades are possible as well.) 
We can summarize the results in a table:

a.  Who has a comparative advantage in producing maple 
syrup? Who has a comparative advantage in producing 
honey?
b.  Suppose that Canada is currently producing 30 tons of 
honey and 15 tons of maple syrup, and the United States 
is currently producing 10 tons of honey and 40 tons of 
maple syrup. Demonstrate that Canada and the United 
States can both be better off if they specialize in produc-
ing only one good and engage in trade.
c.  Illustrate your answer to question (b) by drawing a PPF 
for the United States and a PPF for Canada. Show on 
your PPFs the combinations of honey and maple syrup 
produced and consumed in each country before and  
after trade.

The United States is better off after trade because it can consume the 
same amount of maple syrup and 10 more tons of honey. Canada is better 
off after trade because it can consume the same amount of honey and 5 more 
tons of maple syrup.
Step 4: Answer part (c) by drawing the PPFs.
The Market System
We have seen that households, firms, and the government face trade-offs and incur op-
portunity costs because resources are scarce. We have also seen that trade allows people 
to specialize according to their comparative advantage. By engaging in trade, people can 
raise their standard of living. Of course, trade in the modern world is much more com-
plex than the examples we have considered so far. Trade today involves the decisions of 
millions of people around the world. But how does an economy make trade possible, and  
how are the decisions of these millions of people coordinated? In the United States 
and most other countries, trade is carried out in markets. Markets also determine the 
 answers to the three fundamental questions discussed in Chapter 1: What goods and 
services will be produced? How will the goods and services be produced? and Who will 
receive the goods and services produced?
Recall that the definition of market is a group of buyers and sellers of a good or ser-
vice and the institution or arrangement by which they come together to trade. Markets 
take many forms: They can be physical places, such as a local pizza parlor or the New 
York Stock Exchange, or virtual places, such as eBay. In a market, the buyers are de-
manders of goods or services, and the sellers are suppliers of goods or services. House-
holds and firms interact in two types of markets: product markets and factor markets. 
Product markets are markets for goods—such as computers—and services—such as 
medical treatment. In product markets, households are demanders and firms are suppli-
ers. Factor markets are markets for the factors of production. Factors of production are 
the inputs used to make goods and services. Factors of production are divided into four 
broad categories:
• 
Labor includes all types of work, from the part-time labor of teenagers working at 
McDonald’s to the work of senior managers in large corporations.
• 
Capital refers to physical capital, such as computers and machine tools, that is used 
to produce other goods.

C H A P T E R  2  Trade-offs, Comparative Advantage, and the Market System 
• 
Natural resources include land, water, oil, iron ore, and other raw materials (or “gifts 
of nature”) that are used in producing goods.
• 
An entrepreneur is someone who operates a business. Entrepreneurial ability is the 
ability to bring together the other factors of production to successfully produce and 
sell goods and services.
The Circular Flow of Income
Two key groups participate in markets:
• 
A household consists of all the individuals in a home. Households are suppliers of 
factors of production—particularly labor—employed by firms to make goods and 
services. Households use the income they receive from selling the factors of pro-
duction to purchase the goods and services supplied by firms. We are familiar with 
households as suppliers of labor because most people earn most of their income by 
going to work, which means they are selling their labor services to firms in the labor 
market. But households own the other factors of production as well, either directly 
or indirectly, by owning the firms that have these resources. All firms are owned by 
households. Small firms, like a neighborhood restaurant, might be owned by one 
person. Large firms, like Microsoft or BMW, are owned by millions of households 
that own shares of stock in them. (We discuss the stock market in Chapter 8.) When 
firms pay profits to the people who own them, the firms are paying for using the 
capital and natural resources that are supplied to them by those owners. So, we can 
generalize by saying that in factor markets, households are suppliers and firms are 
demanders.
• 
Firms are suppliers of goods and services. Firms use the funds they receive from 
selling goods and services to buy the factors of production needed to make the 
goods and services.
We can use a simple economic model called the circular-flow diagram to see 
how participants in markets are linked. Figure 2.6 shows that in factor markets, house-
holds supply labor and other factors of production in exchange for wages and other 
payments from firms. In product markets, households use the payments they earn in 
factor markets to purchase the goods and services supplied by firms. Firms produce 
these goods and services using the factors of production supplied by households. In the 
figure, the blue arrows show the flow of factors of production from households through 
 factor markets to firms. The red arrows show the flow of goods and services from firms 
through product markets to households. The green arrows show the flow of funds from 
firms through factor markets to households and the flow of spending from households 
through product markets to firms.
Like all economic models, the circular-flow diagram is a simplified version of re-
ality. For example, Figure 2.6 leaves out the important role of government in buying 
goods from firms and in making payments, such as Social Security or unemployment 
insurance payments, to households. The figure also leaves out the roles played by banks, 
the stock and bond markets, and other parts of the financial system in aiding the flow 
of funds from lenders to borrowers. Finally, the figure does not show that some goods 
and services purchased by domestic households are produced in foreign countries and 
some goods and services produced by domestic firms are sold to foreign households. 
(We  explore the government, the financial system, and the international sector further 
in later chapters.) Despite these simplifications, the circular-flow diagram in Figure 2.6 
is useful for seeing how product markets, factor markets, and their participants are 
linked together. One of the great wonders of the market system is that it manages to suc-
cessfully coordinate the independent activities of so many households and firms.
The Gains from Free Markets
A free market exists when the government places few restrictions on how goods and 
services can be produced or sold or on how factors of production can be employed. 
Circular-flow diagram A model that 
illustrates how participants in markets 
are linked.
Free market A market with few 
government restrictions on how a 
good or service can be produced or 
sold or on how a factor of production 
can be employed.

 
The Market System 
53
Governments in all modern economies intervene more than is consistent with a fully 
free market. In that sense, we can think of the free market as being a benchmark against 
which we can judge actual economies. There are relatively few government restrictions 
on economic activity in the United States, Canada, the countries of Western Europe, 
Hong Kong, Singapore, and Estonia. So these countries come close to the free market 
benchmark. In countries such as Cuba and North Korea, the free market system has 
been rejected in favor of centrally planned economies with extensive government con-
trol over product and factor markets. Countries that come closest to the free market 
benchmark have been more successful than countries with centrally planned economies 
in providing their people with rising living standards.
The Scottish philosopher Adam Smith is considered the father of modern econom-
ics because his book An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, 
published in 1776, was an early and very influential argument for the free market sys-
tem. Smith was writing at a time when extensive government restrictions on markets 
were still common. In many parts of Europe, the guild system still prevailed. Under this 
system, governments would give guilds, or organizations of producers, the authority to 
control the production of a good. For example, the shoemakers’ guild controlled who 
was allowed to produce shoes, how many shoes they could produce, and what price they 
could charge. In France, the cloth makers’ guild even dictated the number of threads in 
the weave of the cloth.
Smith argued that such restrictions reduced the income, or wealth, of a country and 
its people by restricting the quantity of goods produced. Some people at the time sup-
ported the restrictions of the guild system because it was in their financial interest to do 
so. If you were a member of a guild, the restrictions served to reduce the competition

Figure 2.6
The Circular-Flow Diagram
Households and firms are linked together in 
a circular flow of production, income, and 
spending. The blue arrows show the flow of 
the factors of production. In factor markets, 
households supply labor, entrepreneurial 
ability, and other factors of production to 
firms. Firms use these factors of production 
to make goods and services that they supply 
to households in product markets. The red 
arrows show the flow of goods and services 
from firms to households. The green arrows 
show the flow of funds. In factor markets, 
households receive wages and other pay-
ments from firms in exchange for supplying 
the factors of production. Households use 
these wages and other payments to purchase 
goods and services from firms in product 
markets. Firms sell goods and services to 
households in product markets, and they 
use the funds to purchase the factors of pro-
duction from households in factor markets.

C H A P T E R  2  Trade-offs, Comparative Advantage, and the Market System 
you faced. But other people sincerely believed that the alternative to the guild system 
was economic chaos. Smith argued that these people were wrong and that a country 
could enjoy a smoothly functioning economic system if firms were freed from guild 
restrictions.
The Market Mechanism
In Smith’s day, defenders of the guild system worried that if, for instance, the  shoemakers’ 
guild did not control shoe production, either too many or too few shoes would be pro-
duced. Smith argued that prices would do a better job of coordinating the activities of 
buyers and sellers than the guilds could. A key to understanding Smith’s argument is the 
assumption that individuals usually act in a rational, self-interested way. In particular, 
individuals take those actions most likely to make themselves better off financially. This 
assumption of rational, self-interested behavior underlies nearly all economic analysis. 
In fact, economics can be distinguished from other fields that study human behavior—
such as sociology and psychology—by its emphasis on the assumption of self-interested 
behavior. Adam Smith understood—as economists today understand—that people’s 
motives can be complex. But in analyzing people in the act of buying and selling, the 
motivation of financial reward usually provides the best explanation for the actions 
 people take.
For example, suppose that a significant number of consumers switch from buying 
regular gasoline-powered cars to buying gasoline/electric-powered hybrid cars, such 
as the Toyota Prius, as in fact has happened in the United States during the past 10 
years. Firms will find that they can charge relatively higher prices for hybrid cars than 
they can for regular cars. The self-interest of these firms will lead them to respond 
to consumers’ wishes by producing more hybrids and fewer regular cars. Or suppose 
that consumers decide that they want to eat less bread, pasta, and other foods high 
in carbohydrates, as many did following the increase in popularity of the Atkins and 
South Beach diets. Then the prices firms can charge for bread and pasta will fall. The 
self-interest of firms will lead them to produce less bread and pasta, which in fact is 
what happened.
Note that for the market mechanism to work in responding to changes in con-
sumers’ wants, prices must be flexible. Changes in relative prices—that is, the price 
of one good or service relative to other goods or services—provides information, 
or a signal, to both consumers and firms. For example, in 2010, consumers world-
wide increased their demand for cattle and poultry. Because corn is fed to cattle and 
poultry, prices for corn soared relative to prices for other crops. Many farmers in the 
United States received this price signal and responded by increasing the amount of 
corn they planted and decreasing the amount of soybeans and wheat. One Kansas 
farmer was quoted as saying, “It seemed to me there was $100 to $150 per acre more 
money in the corn than there was in the beans. That’s the kind of math that a lot of 
guys were using.” Similarly, falling prices for DVDs or music CDs in the 2000s was 
a signal to movie studios and record companies to devote fewer resources to these 
products and more resources to making movies and music available online. In the 
United States today, governments at the federal, state, and local levels set or regulate 
the price of only about 10 to 20 percent of goods and services. The prices of other 
goods and services are free to change as consumer wants change and as costs of pro-
duction change.
In the case where consumers want more of a product, and in the case where 
they want less of a product, the market system responds without a guild or the gov-
ernment giving orders about how much to produce or what price to charge. In a 
famous phrase, Smith said that firms would be led by the “invisible hand” of the 
market to provide consumers with what they want. Firms respond individually to 
changes in prices by making decisions that collectively end up satisfying the wants of 
consumers.

A Story of the Market System in Action: 
How Do You Make an iPad?
Apple produces the iPad 2. Because Apple’s 
headquarters is in Cupertino, California, it 
seems reasonable to assume that iPads are also manufactured in that 
state. In fact, although engineers at Apple designed the iPad, the com-
pany produces none of the components of the iPad, nor does it assem-
ble the components into a finished product. Far from being produced 
entirely by one company in one place, the iPad requires the coordinated 
activities of thousands of workers and dozens of firms spread around 
the world.
Foxconn, which is based in Taiwan, assembles the iPad in factories 
in Shenzhen and Chengdu, China, and ships them to Apple for sale in 
the United States. Foxconn has announced plans to begin assembling 
some iPads in a new factory in Brazil by 2012. Although Foxconn does final assem-
bly, it doesn’t make any of the components and, in fact, charges Apple less than $15 for 
 assembling each iPad.
The table below lists just some of the many suppliers of components for the iPad 2.

Each of these suppliers in turn relies on its own suppliers. For example, Broadcom 
designs the touchscreen controller for the iPad and supplies it to Apple, but it does not 
manufacture the components of the controller or assemble them. To manufacture the com-
ponents, Broadcom relies on SilTerra, based in Malaysia; SMIC, based in mainland China; 
and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (TSMC) and UMC, based in Tai-
wan. TSMC’s factories are for the most part not in Taiwan but in mainland China and East-
ern Europe. To assemble the components, Broadcom uses several companies, including 
Amkor Technology, based in Chandler, Arizona, and STATS  ChipPAC, based in Singapore.
All told, an iPad contains hundreds of parts that are designed, manufactured, and 
assembled by firms around the world. Many of these firms are not even aware of which 
other firms are also producing components for the iPad. Few of the managers of these 
firms have met managers of the other firms or shared knowledge of how their particular 
components are produced. In fact, no one person from Tim Cook, the chief executive 
officer of Apple, on down possesses the knowledge of how to produce all the compo-
nents that are assembled into an iPad. Instead, the invisible hand of the market has led 
these firms to contribute their knowledge and resources to the process that ultimately 
results in an iPad available for sale in a store in the United States. Apple has so efficiently 
organized the process of producing the iPad that you can order a custom iPad with a 
personal engraving and have it delivered from an assembly plant in China to your door-
step in the United States in as little as three days.

C H A P T E R  2  Trade-offs, Comparative Advantage, and the Market System 
The Role of the Entrepreneur
Entrepreneurs are central to the working of the market system. An entrepreneur is 
someone who operates a business. Entrepreneurs must first determine what goods and 
services they believe consumers want, and then they must decide how to produce those 
goods and services most profitably, using the available factors of production—labor, 
capital, and natural resources. Successful entrepreneurs are able to search out opportu-
nities to  provide new goods and services. Often these opportunities are created by new 
technology. Consumers and existing businesses typically do not at first realize that the 
new technology makes new products feasible. For example, even after the development 
of the internal combustion engine had made automobiles practicable, Henry Ford re-
marked, “If I had asked my customers what they wanted, they would have said a faster 
horse.” Because consumers often cannot evaluate a new product before it exists, some of 
the most successful entrepreneurs, such as the late Steve Jobs of Apple, rarely use focus 
groups, or meetings with consumers in which the customers are asked what new prod-
ucts they would like to see. Instead, entrepreneurs think of products that consumers 
may not even realize they need, such as, in Jobs’s case, an MP3 player—iPod—or a tablet 
computer—iPad.
Entrepreneurs are of great importance to the economy because they are often re-
sponsible for making new products widely available to consumers, as Henry Ford did 
with the automobile and Steve Jobs did with the iPod. Table 2.3 lists some of the impor-
tant products entrepreneurs at small firms introduced during the twentieth century.

The Market System 
57
Entrepreneurs put their own funds at risk when they start businesses. If they are 
wrong about what consumers want or about the best way to produce goods and services, 
they can lose those funds. In fact, it is not unusual for entrepreneurs who eventually 
achieve great success to fail at first. For instance, early in their careers, both Henry Ford 
and Sakichi Toyoda, who eventually founded the Toyota Motor Corporation, started 
companies that quickly failed. Research by Richard Freeman of Harvard University has 
shown that the typical entrepreneur earns less than someone with the same education 
and other characteristics who is an employee at a large firm. Few entrepreneurs make 
the fortunes earned by Henry Ford, Steve Jobs, or Bill Gates.
Entrepreneurs make a vital contribution to economic growth through their roles 
in responding to consumer demand and in introducing new products. So, government 
policies that encourage entrepreneurship are also likely to increase economic growth 
and raise the standard of living. In the next section, we consider the legal framework 
required for a successful market in which entrepreneurs can succeed.
The Legal Basis of a Successful Market System
In a free market, government does not restrict how firms produce and sell goods and 
services or how they employ factors of production. But the absence of government in-
tervention is not enough for the market system to work well. Government has to take 
active steps to provide a legal environment that will allow the market system to succeed.
Protection of Private Property For the market system to work well, individu-
als must be willing to take risks. Someone with $250,000 can be cautious and keep it 
safely in a bank—or even in cash, if the person doesn’t trust banks. But the market sys-
tem won’t work unless a significant number of people are willing to risk their funds 
by investing them in businesses. Investing in businesses is risky in any country. Many 
businesses fail every year in the United States and other high-income countries. But 
in high-income countries, someone who starts a new business or invests in an exist-
ing business doesn’t have to worry that the government, the military, or criminal gangs 
might decide to seize the business or demand payments for not destroying the business. 
Unfortunately, in many poor countries, owners of businesses are not well protected from 
having their businesses seized by the government or from having their profits taken by 
criminals. Where these problems exist, opening a business can be extremely risky. Cash 
can be concealed easily, but a business is difficult to conceal and difficult to move.
Property rights are the rights individuals or firms have to the exclusive use of their 
property, including the right to buy or sell it. Property can be tangible, physical property, 
such as a store or factory. Property can also be intangible, such as the right to an idea. 
Two amendments to the U.S. Constitution guarantee property rights: The 5th Amend-
ment states that the federal government shall not deprive any person “of life, liberty, or 
property, without due process of law.” The 14th Amendment extends this guarantee to 
the actions of state governments: “No state . . . shall deprive any person of life, liberty, 
or property, without due process of law.” Similar guarantees exist in every high-income 
country. Unfortunately, in many developing countries, such guarantees do not exist or 
are poorly enforced.
In any modern economy, intellectual property rights are very important. Intellectual 
property includes books, films, software, and ideas for new products or new ways of pro-
ducing products. To protect intellectual property, the federal government grants a pat-
ent that gives an inventor—which is often a firm—the exclusive right to produce and sell 
a new product for a period of 20 years from the date the patent was filed. For instance, 
because Microsoft has a patent on the Windows operating system, other firms cannot 
sell their own versions of Windows. The government grants patents to encourage firms 
to spend money on the research and development necessary to create new products. If 
other companies could freely copy Windows, Microsoft would not have spent the funds 
necessary to develop it. Just as a new product or a new method of making a product re-
ceives patent protection, books, films, and software receive  copyright protection. Under 
U.S. law, the creator of a book, film, or piece of music has the exclusive right to use the

creation during the creator’s lifetime. The creator’s heirs retain this exclusive right for  
50 years after the death of the creator.
Enforcement of Contracts and Property Rights Business activity often in-
volves someone agreeing to carry out some action in the future. For example, you may 
borrow $20,000 to buy a car and promise the bank—by signing a loan contract—that 
you will pay back the money over the next five years. Or Microsoft may sign a licensing 
agreement with a small technology company, agreeing to use that company’s technology 
for a period of several years in return for a fee. Usually these agreements take the form 
of legal contracts. For the market system to work, businesses and individuals have to 
rely on these contracts being carried out. If one party to a legal contract does not fulfill 
its obligations—perhaps the small company had promised Microsoft exclusive use of its 
technology but then began licensing it to other companies—the other party can go to 
court to have the agreement enforced. Similarly, if property owners in the United States 
believe that the federal or state government has violated their rights under the 5th or 
14th Amendments, they can go to court to have their rights enforced.
But going to court to enforce a contract or private property rights will be successful 
only if the court system is independent and judges are able to make impartial decisions 
on the basis of the law. In the United States and other high-income countries, the court 
systems have enough independence from other parts of the government and enough 
protection from intimidation by outside forces—such as criminal gangs—that they are 
able to make their decisions based on the law. In many developing countries, the court 
systems lack this independence and will not provide a remedy if the government vio-
lates private property rights or if a person with powerful political connections decides to 
violate a business contract.
If property rights are not well enforced, fewer goods and services will be produced. 
This reduces economic efficiency, leaving the economy inside its production possibili-
ties frontier.

Economics in Your Life
The Trade-offs When You Buy a Car
At the beginning of the chapter, we asked you to think about two questions: When buying a new 
car, what is the relationship between safety and fuel efficiency? and Under what circumstances 
would it be possible for automobile manufacturers to make cars safer and more fuel efficient? To 
answer the first question, you have to recognize that there is a trade-off between safety and fuel 
efficiency. With the technology available at any particular time, an automobile manufacturer can 
increase fuel efficiency by making a car smaller and lighter. But driving a lighter car increases your 
chances of being injured if you have an accident. The trade-off between safety and fuel efficiency 
would look much like the relationship in Figure 2.1 on page 41. To get more of both safety and 
gas mileage, automobile makers would have to discover new technologies that allow them to 
make cars lighter and safer at the same time. Such new technologies would make points like G in 
 Figure 2.1 attainable.

Conclusion
We have seen that by trading in markets, people are able to specialize and pursue their 
comparative advantage. Trading on the basis of comparative advantage makes all partic-
ipants in trade better off. The key role of markets is to facilitate trade. In fact, the market 
system is a very effective means of coordinating the decisions of millions of consumers, 
workers, and firms. At the center of the market system is the consumer. To be success-
ful, firms must respond to the desires of consumers. These desires are communicated 
to firms through prices. To explore how markets work, we must study the behavior of 
consumers and firms. We continue this exploration of markets in Chapter 3, when we 
develop the model of demand and supply.
Before moving on to Chapter 3, read An Inside Look on the next page for a discus-
sion of the trade-offs General Motors faces in producing its electric cars, the Chevy Volt 
and the Cadillac Converj.

GREEN CAR REPORTS
Cadillac Reportedly 
to Build Chevy Volt–
Based Car
Sometimes, like Lazarus, dead cars 
rise again.
We’ve learned from an inside 
source at General Motors, a person 
close to the project, that the electric 
Cadillac Converj luxury coupe is now 
back in the GM product plan.
The Converj was recently ap-
proved for production by GM product 
executives. It will likely launch in 2013 
as a 2014 model, though it may end 
up with a Cadillac-style three-letter 
model name.
The production version will fea-
ture, says our source, “a Generation 
1.5 Voltec” powertrain.
That would be an updated ver-
sion of the extended-range electric 
powertrain from the 2011 Chevrolet 
Volt, possibly with better acceleration 
to suit the Cadillac image—but not 
the fully revised second-generation 
version that will go into production in 
2015.
Smash hit in 2009
 The Converj concept car was 
first unveiled in January 2009 at the 
Detroit Auto Show. The sleek sports 
coupe received rave reviews, and dur-
ing 2009, it was approved for produc-
tion, with then-product chief Bob 
Lutz saying in January 2010 it had 
been cleared by management.
Two months later, it was killed, 
with Cadillac spokesman David 
Caldwell saying the Converj program 
had not reached “a point [at] which 
development would be occurring in 
earnest in any case.”
Two reasons were given for end-
ing the program almost 18 months 
ago: First, GM could not make a profit 
at the low volumes the Converj had 
been planned for.
Now, with the Volt essentially 
sold out and GM trying to boost 
production as fast as possible, per-
haps Converj volumes can go higher, 
meaning each car may cost less.
Second, product planners were 
concerned that the greater weight and 
additional luxury features of a Cadil-
lac would cut its electric range and 
performance—reducing its appeal, 
much as the Lexus HS 250h has sold 
in lower numbers than expected for 
Toyota’s luxury arm.
“All about profit”
 Apparently, both concerns have 
been resolved. One reason for resus-
citating the Converj, says our source, 
is that CEO Dan Akerson is “all about 
profit.” The 2012 Volt lists at $39,990, 
and tops out (before dealer markup) 
at less than $50,000.
If some Voltec cars could be sold 
not for $45,000 but, say, $60,000, that 
might enable GM to make money on 
its first generation of Voltec cars. Or, 
perhaps more realistically, to lose less 
money on the technology—until a 
less-costly second generation can be 
rolled out.
And if Cadillac truly hopes to 
compete with the likes of Mercedes-
Managers at General Motors Approve 
Production of a Plug-in Cadillac
Benz, BMW, and Audi, it needs to 
have one or more plug-in offerings.
All those makes have multiple 
plug-ins planned, from the Mercedes-
Benz S-Class Plug-In Hybrid and 
Audi e-tron electric supercar down to 
the A-Class E-Cell and tiny Audi Ur-
ban Concept two-seater.
Escalade Hybrid: hardly a halo car
 But despite a plug-in hybrid con-
cept for the XTS full-size sedan that 
will go on sale next spring as a 2013 
model, and persistent rumors of an 
SRX plug-in hybrid crossover, neither 
of those products has been given the 
green light for production.
The SRX plug-in hybrid was 
killed in May due to inadequate range 
from its battery pack, which had been 
designed for a different and lighter ve-
hicle. So Cadillac’s sole electrified vehi-
cle remains the 2011 Escalade Hybrid 
full-size sport-utility vehicle—hardly a 
halo car to get early adopters into their 
dealers, as the Volt has done for Chevy.
The Converj is not the only exam-
ple of turbulence in GM’s product plans 
over the last three years. But now that a 
deal has been reached to raise corporate 
average fuel-economy standards to 54.5 
mpg by 2025, insiders hope that the 
GM product plan will settle down.
To reach those goals, plug-in cars 
will clearly become a larger portion of 
GM’s portfolio over time.

Key Points in the Article
This article discusses General Motors’s plan 
to produce an electric car for its Cadillac 
brand with an upgrade of the powertrain 
technology currently in use in its Chevy Volt 
plug-in car. GM introduced a concept ver-
sion of this Cadillac model in 2009, and 
after positive reviews, it was approved for 
production, only to be shelved two months 
later amid concerns about profitability and 
performance. High demand for the Volt 
and improvements to the Voltec power-
train alleviated the profitability and perfor-
mance concerns, and GM again approved 
production of the Cadillac model, with  
a planned introduction in 2013. GM views 
production of an electric plug-in vehicle as 
essential for Cadillac in its effort to compete 
with other luxury automobile brands that 
have plug-in vehicles in the planning stages.
Analyzing the News
a Based on positive reaction to the Cadil-
lac Converj concept vehicle in 2009, 
GM officials approved the car for produc-
tion, but concerns, including its initial  limited 
production estimates, caused GM to re-
verse course and cancel its plans. Subse-
quently, high demand for the Volt led GM to 
increase production of the Voltec power-
train. This increased production of power-
trains caused GM to increase its initial 
production estimates of the Cadillac at a 
potentially lower per-unit cost, again 
 making the production version viable. If we 
assume that in 2009 the resources available 
to GM to produce its Voltec powertrain 
were fixed, and 10,000 could be produced, 
then GM must decide how to allocate those 
resources between producing powertrains 
for its Chevy and for its Cadillac. In the fig-
ure below, we illustrate the trade-off GM 
faces with a production possibilities frontier. 
In 2009, we will assume that GM was at 
point A, devoting 8,000 powertrains for its 
already-approved Volt and only 2,000 for its 
newly approved Converj. At point A, GM 
decided that the small quantity of power-
trains that could be devoted to the Converj 
was insufficient to meet profitability goals 
and that the production would be better de-
voted entirely to the Volt, thereby moving 
production from point A to point B.
b When announcing that the Converj 
would become a production car in 2013, 
GM had determined that its increased pro-
duction of the Voltec powertrain and the pos-
sibility of charging a higher selling price for 
Voltec vehicles could increase the profit po-
tential for these vehicles. By 2013, when it 
expects to start selling the Converj, GM will 
have allocated additional resources and em-
ployed improved technology to the produc-
tion of the Voltec powertrain,  allowing the 
company to increase its production num-
bers. Assume that in 2013 GM is capable of 
producing 30,000 Voltec powertrains. This is 
represented in the  figure below by the pro-
duction possibilities frontier shifting out, al-
lowing GM to devote more powertrains to 
both the Volt and the Converj. In the figure, 
we assume that GM will move to point C and 
will allocate 22,000 powertrains to produc-
tion of the Volt and 8,000 to the Converj.
c GM still has reservations about 
 approving additional electric models for 
its Cadillac brand, citing performance con-
cerns for these heavier vehicles. For GM to 
choose to devote additional resources to 
address these concerns, it would need  
to allocate fewer resources to its current 
production. Companies can weigh the 
 opportunity costs of devoting their limited 
resources to their various production alter-
natives to help determine the allocation of 
resources.
Thinking Critically
1. Suppose that from 2009 to 2013, the re-
sources GM uses to produce the Voltec 
powertrain remained constant, but im-
provements in technology allow GM in 
2013 to produce the additional quantity 
of powertrains shown in the figure for 
only the Cadillac Converj but not the 
Chevy Volt. Draw a graph that illustrates 
this technology change, showing both 
the 2009 and new 2013 production pos-
sibilities frontiers. What is the opportu-
nity cost of producing one powertrain 
for the Volt in 2009? In 2013?
2. Assume that the figure accurately rep-
resents GM’s production possibilities 
frontiers for 2009 and 2013, and in 2013 
it has customer orders for 25,000 Volts 
and 10,000 Converjs. Explain whether 
GM can fill all of these orders.

Summary
The production possibilities frontier (PPF) is a curve that shows 
the maximum attainable combinations of two products that may 
be produced with available resources. The PPF is used to illus-
trate the trade-offs that arise from scarcity. Points on the frontier 
are technically efficient. Points inside the frontier are inefficient, 
and points outside the frontier are unattainable. The opportunity 
cost of any activity is the highest-valued alternative that must be 
given up to engage in that activity. Because of increasing marginal 
opportunity costs, production possibilities frontiers are usually 
bowed out rather than straight lines. This illustrates the impor-
tant economic concept that the more resources that are already 
devoted to any activity, the smaller the payoff from devoting addi-
tional resources to that activity is likely to be. Economic growth is 
illustrated by shifting a production possibilities frontier outward.

Review Questions
 
1.1 What do economists mean by scarcity? Can you think 
of anything that is not scarce according to the economic 
definition?
 
1.2 What is a production possibilities frontier? How can we 
show economic efficiency on a production possibilities 
frontier? How can we show inefficiency? What causes a 
production possibilities frontier to shift outward?
 
1.3 What does increasing marginal opportunity costs mean? 
What are the implications of this idea for the shape of the 
production possibilities frontier?
Problems and Applications
 
1.4 Draw a production possibilities frontier that shows the 
trade-off between the production of cotton and the pro-
duction of soybeans.
 
a. Show the effect that a prolonged drought would have 
on the initial production possibilities frontier.
 
b. Suppose genetic modification makes soybeans resistant 
to insects, allowing yields to double. Show the effect of 
this technological change on the initial production pos-
sibilities frontier.
 
1.5 [Related to the Chapter Opener on page 39] One of the 
trade-offs BMW faces is between safety and gas mileage. 
For example, adding steel to a car makes it safer but also 
heavier, which results in lower gas mileage. Draw a hypo-
thetical production possibilities frontier that BMW engi-
neers face that shows this trade-off.
 
1.6 Suppose you win free tickets to a movie plus all you can eat 
at the snack bar for free. Would there be a cost to you to 
attend this movie? Explain.
 
1.7 Suppose we can divide all the goods produced by an econ-
omy into two types: consumption goods and capital goods. 
Capital goods, such as machinery, equipment, and com-
puters, are goods used to produce other goods.
 
a. Use a production possibilities frontier graph to illus-
trate the trade-off to an economy between producing 
consumption goods and producing capital goods. Is it 
likely that the production possibilities frontier in this 
situation would be a straight line (as in Figure 2.1 on 
page 41) or bowed out (as in Figure 2.2 on page 44)? 
Briefly explain.
 
b. Suppose a technological change occurs that has a favor-
able effect on the production of capital goods but not 
consumption goods. Show the effect on the production 
possibilities frontier.
 
c. Suppose that country A and country B currently have 
identical production possibilities frontiers but that 
country A devotes only 5 percent of its resources to 
producing capital goods over each of the next 10 years, 
whereas country B devotes 30 percent. Which country 
is likely to experience more rapid economic growth in 
the future? Illustrate using a production possibilities 
frontier graph. Your graph should include produc-
tion possibilities frontiers for country A today and in  
10 years and production possibilities frontiers for 
country B today and in 10 years.

Uwe Reinhardt, an economist at Princeton University, 
wrote the following in a column in the New York Times:
[Cost-effectiveness analysis] seeks to establish 
which of several alternative strategies capable 
of achieving a given therapeutic goal is the 
least-cost strategy. It seems a sensible form of 
inquiry in a nation that is dismayed over the 
rising cost of health care. . . . Opponents of 
cost-effectiveness analysis include individuals 
who sincerely believe that health and life are 
“priceless.”
 
 Are health and life priceless? Are there any decisions you 
make during your everyday life that indicate whether you 
consider health and life to be priceless?

average life span of patients receiving the treatment by 
24 months and will cost $750,000 per patient treated, and 
Therapy B, which will prolong the average life span of 
patients receiving the treatment by 20 months and will 
cost $25,000 per patient treated. What factors should the 
federal government take into consideration in making its 
decision?

Lawrence Summers served as secretary of the treasury in 
the Clinton administration from 1999 to 2001 and as di-
rector of the National Economic Council in the Obama 
administration from 2009 to 2010. He has been quoted 
as giving the following moral defense of the economic 
approach:
There is nothing morally unattractive about 
saying: We need to analyze which way of 
spending money on health care will produce 
more benefit and which less, and using our 
money as efficiently as we can. I don’t think 
there is anything immoral about seeking to 
achieve environmental benefits at the lowest 
possible costs.
 
 Would it be more ethical to reduce pollution without wor-
rying about the cost or by taking the cost into account? 
Briefly explain.

 1.14 In The Wonderful Wizard of Oz and his other books about 
the Land of Oz, L. Frank Baum observed that if people’s 

64 
C H A P T E R  2  Trade-offs, Comparative Advantage, and the Market System 
wants were limited enough, most goods would not be 
scarce. According to Baum, this was the case in Oz:
There were no poor people in the Land of Oz, 
because there was no such thing as money. . . . 
Each person was given freely by his neighbors 
whatever he required for his use, which is as 
much as anyone may reasonably desire. Some 
tilled the lands and raised great crops of grain, 
which was divided equally among the whole 
population, so that all had enough. There were 
many tailors and dressmakers and shoemakers 
and the like, who made things that any who 
desired them might wear. Likewise there were 
jewelers who made ornaments for the person, 
which pleased and beautified the people, and 
these ornaments also were free to those who 
asked for them. Each man and woman, no 
matter what he or she produced for the good of 
the community, was supplied by the neighbors 
with food and clothing and a house and fur-
niture and ornaments and games. If by chance 
the supply ever ran short, more was taken from 
the great storehouses of the Ruler, which were 
afterward filled up again when there was more 
of any article than people needed. . . .
You will know, by what I have told you here, 
that the Land of Oz was a remarkable country. 
I do not suppose such an arrangement would 
be practical with us.
 
 Do you agree with Baum that the economic system in Oz 
wouldn’t work in the contemporary United States? Briefly 
explain why or why not.

Summary
Fundamentally, markets are about trade, which is the act of 
buying or selling. People trade on the basis of comparative ad-
vantage. An individual, a firm, or a country has a comparative 
advantage in producing a good or service if it can produce the 
good or service at the lowest opportunity cost. People are usu-
ally better off specializing in the activity for which they have 
a comparative advantage and trading for the other goods and 
services they need. It is important not to confuse comparative 
advantage with absolute advantage. An individual, a firm, or a 
country has an absolute advantage in producing a good or ser-
vice if it can produce more of that good or service using the 
same amount of resources. It is possible to have an absolute ad-
vantage in producing a good or service without having a com-
parative advantage.

more Colts products than any other player. Likewise, imag-
ine that you are a creative and effective manager at work

do what you are better than anyone else at doing?
 2.11 Is specialization and trade between individuals and coun-
tries more about having a job or about obtaining a higher 
standard of living? Individually, if you go from a situation 
of not trading with others (you produce everything your-
self) to a situation of trading with others, do you still have 
a job? Does your standard of living increase? Likewise, if 
a country goes from not trading with other countries to 
trading with other countries, does it still have jobs? Does 
its standard of living increase?
 2.12 In colonial America, the population was spread thinly over 
a large area, and transportation costs were very high because 
it was difficult to ship products by road for more than short 
distances. As a result, most of the free population lived on 
small farms, where they not only grew their own food but 
also usually made their own clothes and very rarely bought 
or sold anything for money. Explain why the incomes of 
these farmers were likely to rise as transportation costs fell. 
Use the concept of comparative advantage in your answer.
 2.13 During the 1928 presidential election campaign, Herbert 
Hoover, the Republican candidate, argued that the United 
States should import only products that could not be pro-
duced here. Do you believe that this would be a good pol-
icy? Explain.
Summary
A market is a group of buyers and sellers of a good or service and 
the institution or arrangement by which they come together to 
trade. Product markets are markets for goods and services, such 
as computers and medical treatment. Factor markets are mar-
kets for the factors of production, such as labor, capital, natural 
resources, and entrepreneurial ability. A circular-flow diagram 
shows how participants in product markets and factor markets are 
linked. Adam Smith argued in his 1776 book The Wealth of Na-
tions that in a free market, where the government does not con-
trol the production of goods and services, changes in prices lead 
firms to produce the goods and services most desired by consum-
ers. If consumers demand more of a good, its price will rise. Firms 
respond to rising prices by increasing production. If consumers 
demand less of a good, its price will fall. Firms respond to falling

In The Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith wrote the follow-
ing (Book I, Chapter II): “It is not from the benevolence 
of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, that we expect our 
dinner, but from their regard to their own interest.” Briefly 
discuss what he meant by this.

cording to an article in the Wall Street Journal, the parts 
contained in the BlackBerry Torch smartphone include 
a power management chip made by Texas Instruments 
(United States), a memory chip made by Samsung (South 
Korea), a GPS receiver made by CSR (United Kingdom), 
a radio frequency (RF) transceiver made by Dialog Semi-
conductor (Germany), an RF transceiver made by Rene-
sas (Japan), an application and communications processor 
made by Marvell (United States), a video image processor 
made by STMicroelectronics (Switzerland), and plastic 
and stamped metal parts made by several firms in China. 
A firm in Mexico carries out final assembly of the Torch 
before it is shipped to BlackBerry for sale in the United 
States and other countries. Is it necessary for the manag-
ers in all of these firms to know how the components of 
the Torch are manufactured and how the components are 
assembled into a smartphone? Is it necessary for the chief 
executive officer (CEO) of BlackBerry to know this infor-
mation? Briefly explain.

 3.10 In many parts of Europe during the mid-1770s, govern-
ments gave guilds, or organizations of producers, the au-
thority to control who was allowed to produce a good, the 
amount of the good produced, and the price charged for 
the good. Would you expect more competition among 
producers in a guild system or in a market system? Was the 
consumer or the producer at the center of the guild sys-
tem, and which is at the center of the market system? How 
would the two systems compare over time in terms of in-
novation of new products and technologies?
 3.11 In a speech at the New York University Law School, Fed-
eral Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke stated:
Writing in the eighteenth century, Adam 
Smith conceived of the free-market system 
as an “invisible hand” that harnesses the pur-
suit of private interest to promote the public 
good. Smith’s conception remains relevant to-
day, notwithstanding the enormous increase 
in economic complexity since the Industrial 
Revolution.
 
 Briefly explain the idea of the invisible hand. What’s so im-
portant about the idea of the invisible hand?

 3.12 Evaluate the following argument: “Adam Smith’s analysis is 
based on a fundamental flaw: He assumes that people are 
motivated by self-interest. But this isn’t true. I’m not self-
ish, and most people I know aren’t selfish.”
 3.13 Writing in the New York Times, Michael Lewis argued that 
“a market economy is premised on a system of incentives 
designed to encourage an ignoble human trait: self-inter-
est.” Do you agree that self-interest is an “ignoble human 
trait”? What incentives does a market system provide to 
encourage self-interest?

October 27, 2002.
 3.14 Some economists have been puzzled that although en-
trepreneurs take on the risk of losing time and money 
by starting new businesses, on average their incomes are 
lower than those of people with similar characteristics who 
go to work at large firms. Economist William Baumol be-
lieves part of the explanation for this puzzle may be that 
entrepreneurs are like people who buy lottery tickets. On 
average, people who don’t buy lottery tickets are left with 
more money than people who buy tickets because lotteries 
take in more money than they give out. Baumol argues that 
“the masses of purchasers who grab up the [lottery] tickets

 3.15 The 2009 International Property Rights Index study states:
Data shows that countries that protect the 
physical and intellectual property of their 
people enjoy nearly nine times higher [income 
per person] . . . than countries ranking low-
est in property rights protections. The study  
. . . compared the protections of physical and 
intellectual property to economic stability in 
115 countries. . . .
 
 How would the creation of property rights be likely to 
affect the economic opportunities available to citizens 
of those countries ranking lowest in property rights 
protections?

Although initially Apple had the market 
for new-style tablets largely to itself, competi-
tors appeared rapidly. Toshiba, Samsung, Dell, 
LG, Motorola, Lenovo, Amazon, and ZTE all 
introduced tablets running on Google’s An-
droid operating system. Research in Motion 
(RIM) introduced the BlackBerry Playbook, 
based on its operating system.
The intense competition among firms 
selling the new tablets is a striking example of 
how the market responds to changes in con-
sumer tastes. As many consumers indicated 
that they would buy small tablets, firms scram-
bled to meet the demand for this new product. 
Although intense competition is not always 
good news for firms trying to sell products, 
it is a boon to consumers because it increases 
the available choice of products and lowers the 
prices consumers pay for those products.
AN INSIDE LOOK on page 92 discusses 
how the many tablet producers are concerned 
about component shortages.
Based on Matt Berger and James Niccolai, “Gates 
Unveils Portable Tablet PC,” PC World, November 12, 
2001; Wolfgang Gruener, “240 Million Tablets: The 
Gazillion-Dollar Forecast Game,” www.fool.com, Febru-
ary 6, 2011; David Pogue, “Pretty Tablet, Though Late for 
the Ball,” New York Times, June 29, 2011; and Stu Woo 
and Yukari Iwatani Kane, “Amazon to Battle Apple iPad 
with Tablet,” Wall Street Journal, July 14, 2011.
Bill Gates, who was then chairman of Micro-
soft, made a famous—but wrong!—prediction 
in 2001. At a computer industry trade show, 
he predicted that tablet computers would 
make up a majority of personal computer 
sales within five years. Microsoft had devel-
oped new software that made it possible to use 
a stylus to write on a laptop computer screen, 
and Gates hoped that consumers would re-
spond to compact lightweight computers. But 
many consumers found them  awkward to use 
and thought that the prices, at $2,000 or more, 
were too high. As a result, rather than making 
up a majority of computer sales in 2006, tab-
lets were just 1 percent of the market.
Fast forward to 2010: After years of 
stating that his company would not enter 
the market for netbooks—or lightweight 
computers smaller than laptops—Apple 
CEO Steve Jobs introduced the iPad in 
April. The iPad was an immediate success, 
selling nearly 15 million units by the end of 
the year. The iPad 2, released in early 2011, 
experienced similarly rapid sales.
The iPad was very different from the 
tablet computers that had failed to win favor 
with consumers a few years earlier. The iPad 
was more awkward to use for word process-
ing or working on spreadsheets, but it was 
lighter than earlier tablets, and its wireless 
connectivity and portability made it better

Economics in Your Life
Will You Buy an Apple iPad or a Samsung Galaxy Tab?
Suppose you are considering buying a tablet computer and that you are choosing between an Apple 
iPad and a Samsung Galaxy Tab. Apple introduced the iPad in April 2010, and Samsung introduced the 
Galaxy Tab in November 2010; seven months is a long time in the world of high-tech gadgets. Apple 
products have become very fashionable, and if you buy an iPad, you will have access to many more ap-
plications—or “apps”—that can increase the enjoyability and productivity of your tablet. One strategy 
Samsung can use to overcome those advantages is to compete based on price and value. Would you 
choose to buy a Galaxy Tab if it had a lower price than an iPad? If your income increased, would it 
 affect your decision about which tablet to buy? As you read the chapter, see if you can answer these 
questions. You can check your answers against those we provide page 91 at the end of this chapter.

C H A P T E R  3  Where Prices Come From: The Interaction of Demand and Supply 
I
n Chapter 1, we explored how economists use models to predict human behavior. In 
Chapter 2, we used the model of production possibilities frontiers to analyze scarcity 
and trade-offs. In this chapter and the next, we explore the model of demand and sup-
ply, which is the most powerful tool in economics, and use it to explain how prices are 
determined.
Recall from Chapter 1 that because economic models rely on assumptions, the models 
are simplifications of reality. In some cases, the assumptions of the model may not seem to 
describe exactly the economic situation being analyzed. For example, the model of demand 
and supply assumes that we are analyzing a perfectly competitive market. In a  perfectly 
 competitive market, there are many buyers and sellers, all the products sold are identi-
cal, and there are no barriers to new firms entering the market. These assumptions are very 
restrictive and apply exactly to only a few markets, such as the markets for wheat and other 
agricultural products. Experience has shown, however, that the model of demand and sup-
ply can be very useful in analyzing markets where competition among sellers is intense, even 
if there are relatively few sellers and the products being sold are not identical. In fact, in re-
cent studies, the model of demand and supply has been successful in analyzing markets with 
as few as four buyers and four sellers. In the end, the usefulness of a model depends on how 
well it can predict outcomes in a market. As we will see in this chapter, this model is often 
very useful in predicting changes in quantities and prices in many markets.
We begin considering the model of demand and supply by discussing consumers and 
the demand side of the market, before turning to firms and the supply side. Throughout the 
book we will apply this model to understand business, the economy, and economic policy.
The Demand Side of the Market
Chapter 2 explained that in a market system, consumers ultimately determine which 
goods and services will be produced. The most successful businesses are the ones that 
respond best to consumer demand. But what determines consumer demand for a prod-
uct? Certainly, many factors influence the willingness of consumers to buy a particular 
product. For example, consumers who are considering buying a tablet computer, such 
as an Apple iPad or an Samsung Galaxy Tab, will make their decisions based on, among 
other factors, the income they have available to spend and the effectiveness of the adver-
tising campaigns of the companies that sell tablets. The main factor in most consumer 
decisions, though, is the price of the product. So, it makes sense to begin with price when 
analyzing the decisions of consumers to buy a product. It is important to note that when 
we discuss demand, we are considering not what a consumer wants to buy but what the 
consumer is both willing and able to buy.
Demand Schedules and Demand Curves
Tables that show the relationship between the price of a product and the quantity of 
the product demanded are called demand schedules. The table in Figure 3.1 shows the 
number of tablet computers consumers would be willing to buy over the course of a day 
at five different prices. The amount of a good or a service that a consumer is willing and 
able to purchase at a given price is referred to as the quantity demanded. The graph in 
Figure 3.1 plots the numbers from the table as a demand curve, a curve that shows the 
relationship between the price of a product and the quantity of the product demanded. 
(Note that for convenience, we made the demand curve in Figure 3.1 a straight line, or 
linear. There is no reason that all demand curves need to be straight lines.) The demand 
curve in Figure 3.1 shows the market demand, or the demand by all the consumers 
of a given good or service. The market for a product, such as restaurant meals, that is

purchased locally would include all the consumers in a city or a relatively small area. 
The market for a product that is sold internationally, such as tablet computers, would 
include all the consumers in the world.
The demand curve in Figure 3.1 slopes downward because consumers will buy 
more tablets as the price falls. When the price of a tablet is $700, consumers buy 3 mil-
lion tablets per month. If the price of a tablet falls to $600, consumers buy 4 million tab-
lets. Buyers demand a larger quantity of a product as the price falls because the product 
becomes less expensive relative to other products and because they can afford to buy 
more at a lower price.
The Law of Demand
The inverse relationship between the price of a product and the quantity of the prod-
uct demanded is called the law of demand: Holding everything else constant, when the 
price of a product falls, the quantity demanded of the product will increase, and when 
the price of a product rises, the quantity demanded of the product will decrease. The 
law of demand holds for any market demand curve. Economists have found only a very 
few exceptions to this law.
What Explains the Law of Demand?
It makes sense that consumers will buy more of a good when the price falls and less of a 
good when the price rises, but let’s look more closely at why this is true. When the price 
of tablet computers falls, consumers buy a larger quantity because of the substitution ef-
fect and the income effect.
Substitution Effect The substitution effect refers to the change in the quantity 
demanded of a good that results from a change in price, making the good more or 
less expensive relative to other goods that are substitutes. When the price of tablet 
computers falls, consumers will substitute buying tablet computers for buying other 
goods, such as laptop computers, netbook computers, or even smartphones.
The Income Effect The income effect of a price change refers to the change in 
the quantity demanded of a good that results from the effect of a change in the good’s 
price on consumers’ purchasing power. Purchasing power is the quantity of goods a 
consumer can buy with a fixed amount of income. When the price of a good falls, the 
increased purchasing power of consumers’ incomes will usually lead them to purchase 
a larger quantity of the good. When the price of a good rises, the decreased purchasing

holding everything else constant,

quantity demanded of the product 
will increase, and when the price of a 
product rises, the quantity demanded

results from a change in price, making

Figure 3.1 
A Demand Schedule and 
Demand Curve
As the price changes, consumers change the 
quantity of tablet computers they are will-
ing to buy. We can show this as a demand 
schedule in a table or as a demand curve 
on a graph. The table and graph both show 
that as the price of tablet computers falls, 
the quantity demanded increases. When the 
price of tablet computers is $700, consumers 
buy 3 million tablets per month. When the 
price drops to $600, consumers buy 4 mil-
lion tablets. Therefore, the demand curve 
for tablet computers is downward sloping.

C H A P T E R  3  Where Prices Come From: The Interaction of Demand and Supply 
power of consumers’ incomes will usually lead them to purchase a smaller quantity of 
the good.
Note that although we can analyze them separately, the substitution effect and the 
income effect happen simultaneously whenever a price changes. So, a fall in the price 
of tablet computers leads consumers to buy more tablet computers, both because the 
tablets are now less expensive relative to substitute products and because the purchasing 
power of the consumers’ incomes has increased.
Holding Everything Else Constant:  
The Ceteris paribus Condition
Notice that the definition of the law of demand contains the phrase holding everything 
else constant. In constructing the market demand curve for tablet computers, we fo-
cused only on the effect that changes in the price of tablet computers would have on the 
quantity consumers would be willing and able to buy. We were holding constant other 
variables that might affect the willingness of consumers to buy tablets. Economists refer 
to the necessity of holding all variables other than price constant in constructing a de-
mand curve as the ceteris paribus condition; ceteris paribus is Latin for “all else equal.”
What would happen if we allowed a change in a variable—other than price—that 
might affect the willingness of consumers to buy tablet computers? Consumers would 
then change the quantity they demanded at each price. We can illustrate this effect by 
shifting the market demand curve. A shift of a demand curve is an increase or a decrease 
in demand. A movement along a demand curve is an increase or a decrease in the quan-
tity demanded. As Figure 3.2 shows, we shift the demand curve to the right if consumers 
decide to buy more of the good at each price, and we shift the demand curve to the left if 
consumers decide to buy less at each price.
Variables That Shift Market Demand
Many variables other than price can influence market demand. These five are the most 
important:
• 
Income
• 
Prices of related goods
• 
Tastes
• 
Population and demographics
• 
Expected future prices
We next discuss how changes in each of these variables affect the market demand curve.

The Demand Side of the Market 
73
Income The income that consumers have available to spend affects their willing-
ness and ability to buy a good. Suppose that the market demand curve in Figure 3.1 on 
page 71 represents the willingness of consumers to buy tablet computers when average 
household income is $50,000. If household income rises to $52,000, the demand for 
tablets will increase, which we show by shifting the demand curve to the right. A good 
is a  normal good when demand increases following a rise in income and decreases fol-
lowing a fall in income. Most goods are normal goods, but the demand for some goods 
falls when income rises and rises when income falls. For instance, as your income rises, 
you might buy less canned tuna or fewer hot dogs and buy more shrimp or prime rib. 
A good is an inferior good when demand decreases following a rise in income and 
increases following a fall in income. So, for you, canned tuna and hot dogs would be ex-
amples of inferior goods—not because they are of low quality but because you buy less 
of them as your income increases.
Normal good A good for which the 
demand increases as income rises and 
decreases as income falls.
Inferior good A good for which the 
demand increases as income falls and 
decreases as income rises.
Are Quiznos Sandwiches Normal 
Goods and Subway Sandwiches 
Inferior Goods?
In recent years, as American families juggle 
busy schedules, they have increasingly relied on eating out rather than 
preparing meals at home. According to a survey by Restaurants and In-
stitutions magazine, adults eat an average of nearly four meals per week 
outside the home. Nearly one-third of consumers frequently eat lunch 
away from home, and on weekdays more than 15 percent frequently 
eat dinner away from home, a proportion that rises to more than 35 
percent on weekends.
Does this behavior change during a recession? We might ex-
pect that it would because recessions result in declining incomes, 
as some people lose their jobs and others are forced to work fewer 
hours or have their wages reduced. Dining out is more expen-
sive than preparing meals at home, so one way to save during a 
recession is to cut back on restaurant meals. In fact, during the 
2007–2009 recession, many restaurants had a difficult time. Partic-
ularly hard hit were “casual dining” restaurants that provide table  
service and serve moderately priced food. Among other restaurants, Ruby Tuesday,  
 Olive Garden, Red Lobster, and LongHorn Steakhouse all experienced declining 
 demand, while Bennigan’s and Steak and Ale filed for bankruptcy.
However, the recession hurt some restaurants more than others. McDonald’s res-
taurants experienced increased sales during 2008 and 2009. In the market for fast-food 
sandwiches, Subway reported increasing sales, while sales of Quiznos sandwiches, which 
are higher-priced, fell. So, Big Macs and Subway sandwiches seem to fit the economic 
definition of an inferior good because demand increases as income falls, while Quiznos 
sandwiches fit the definition of a normal good. But remember that inferior goods are 
not necessarily of low quality; they are just goods for which consumers increase their 
demand as their incomes fall.

Prices of Related Goods The prices of other goods can also affect consumers’ 
demand for a product. Goods and services that can be used for the same purpose—
such as tablet computers and laptop computers—are substitutes. When two goods are

C H A P T E R  3  Where Prices Come From: The Interaction of Demand and Supply 
substitutes, the more you buy of one, the less you will buy of the other. A decrease in the 
price of a substitute causes the demand curve for a good to shift to the left. An increase 
in the price of a substitute causes the demand curve for a good to shift to the right.
Suppose that the market demand curve in Figure 3.1 on page 71 represents the will-
ingness and ability of consumers to buy laptop computers during a week when the aver-
age price of a laptop computer is $800. If the average price of laptops falls to $700, how 
will the market demand for tablets change? Consumers will demand fewer tablets at 
every price. We show this by shifting the demand curve for tablets to the left.
Goods and services that are used together—such as hot dogs and hot dog buns—
are complements. When two goods are complements, the more consumers buy of one, 
the more they will buy of the other. A decrease in the price of a complement causes the 
demand curve for a good to shift to the right. An increase in the price of a complement 
causes the demand curve for a good to shift to the left.
Many people use applications, or “apps,” on their tablet computers. So, tablets and 
apps are complements. Suppose the market demand curve in Figure 3.1 represents the 
willingness of consumers to buy tablets at a time when the average price of an app is 
$2.99. If the average price of apps drops to $0.99, consumers will buy more apps and 
more tablets: The demand curve for tablets will shift to the right.
Tastes Consumers can be influenced by an advertising campaign for a product. If 
Apple, Samsung, Amazon, and other firms making tablet computers begin to advertise 
heavily online, consumers are more likely to buy tablets at every price, and the demand 
curve will shift to the right. An economist would say that the advertising campaign has 
affected consumers’ taste for tablet computers. Taste is a catchall category that refers to 
the many subjective elements that can enter into a consumer’s decision to buy a product. 
A consumer’s taste for a product can change for many reasons. Sometimes trends play a 
substantial role. For example, the popularity of low-carbohydrate diets caused a decline 
in demand for some goods, such as bread and donuts, and an increase in demand for 
beef. In general, when consumers’ taste for a product increases, the demand curve will 
shift to the right, and when consumers’ taste for a product decreases, the demand curve 
for the product will shift to the left.
Population and Demographics Population and demographic factors can af-
fect the demand for a product. As the population of the United States increases, so 
will the number of consumers, and the demand for most products will increase. The 
 demographics of a population refers to its characteristics, with respect to age, race, and 
gender. As the demographics of a country or region change, the demand for particu-
lar goods will increase or decrease because different categories of people tend to have 
different preferences for those goods. For instance, Hispanics are expected to increase 
from 16 percent of the U.S. population in 2010 to 29 percent in 2050. This increase will 
expand demand for Spanish-language books and cable television channels, among other 
goods and services.

The Aging of the Baby Boom 
Generation
The average age of the U.S. population is increasing. After 
World War II in 1945, the United States experienced a “baby 
boom,” as birthrates rose and remained high through the early 1960s. Falling birthrates 
after 1965 mean that the baby boom generation is larger than the generation before it 
and the generations after it. The figure on the next page uses projections from the U.S. 
Census Bureau to show that as boomers age, they are increasing the fraction of the U.S. 
population that is older than 65.

What effects will the aging of the baby boom generation have on the economy? Older 
people have a greater demand for medical care than do younger people. So, in coming years, 
the demand for doctors, nurses, and hospital facilities should all increase. The increasing 
demand for health care is so strong that between the beginning of the 2007–2009 recession 
and June 2011, 1 million new jobs were created in health care—at the same time as total em-
ployment in the United States declined by 7 million jobs. As we mentioned in Chapter 2, the 
increased demand for medical care will also drive up the federal government’s costs under 
the Medicare program, which pays part of the medical bills of people who are 65 and older.
Aging boomers will also have an effect on the housing market. Older people often 
“downsize” their housing by moving from large, single-family homes, whose mainte-
nance can be difficult and expensive, to smaller homes, condominiums, or apartments. 
So, in coming years, the demand for large homes may decrease, while the demand for 
smaller homes and apartments may increase. Older people also tend to drive less often 
and for shorter distances than do younger drivers. So, their cars wear out more slowly 
and, therefore, need to be replaced less often, reducing the total demand for cars.

Expected Future Prices Consumers choose not only which products to buy but 
also when to buy them. For instance, if enough consumers become convinced that 
houses will be selling for lower prices in three months, the demand for houses will de-
crease now, as some consumers postpone their purchases to wait for the expected price 
decrease. Alternatively, if enough consumers become convinced that the price of houses 
will be higher in three months, the demand for houses will increase now, as some con-
sumers try to beat the expected price increase.
Table 3.1 on page 76 summarizes the most important variables that cause market 
demand curves to shift. Note that the table shows the shift in the demand curve that re-
sults from an increase in each of the variables. A decrease in these variables would cause 
the demand curve to shift in the opposite direction.
A Change in Demand versus a Change

It is important to understand the difference between a change in demand and a change 
in quantity demanded. A change in demand refers to a shift of the demand curve. A shift 
occurs if there is a change in one of the variables, other than the price of the product, that

affects the willingness of consumers to buy the product. A change in quantity demanded 
refers to a movement along the demand curve as a result of a change in the product’s 
price. Figure 3.3 illustrates this important distinction. If the price of tablet computers 
falls from $700 to $600 per tablet, the result will be a movement along the demand curve 
from point A to point B—an increase in quantity demanded from 3 million to 4 million. 
If consumers’ incomes increase, or if another factor changes that makes consumers want 
more of the product at every price, the demand curve will shift to the right—an increase

If the price of tablet computers falls from 
$700 to $600, the result will be a movement 
along the demand curve from point A to

Forecasting the Demand for iPads
One of the most important decisions that the managers of 
any large firm face is which new products to develop. A firm 
must devote people, time, and money 
to designing a new product, negotiating 
with suppliers, formulating a marketing campaign, and many 
other tasks. But any firm has only limited resources and so faces 
a trade-off: Resources used to develop one product will not be 
available to develop another product. Ultimately, the products a 
firm chooses to develop will be those that it believes will be the 
most profitable. So, to decide which products to develop, firms 
need to forecast the demand for those products.
We saw at the beginning of the chapter that in 2001, Bill Gates 
predicted that within five years, a majority of computers sold 
would be tablets. If Gates had been correct about the way the com-
puter market was changing, then any computer firm that didn’t de-
velop a tablet would have run the risk of being left behind. David 
Sobotta, who worked at Apple for 20 years and eventually became 
its national sales manager, has described discussions at Apple dur-
ing 2002 about whether to develop a tablet. According to Sobotta, representatives of 
the federal government’s National Institutes of Health urged Apple to develop a tablet 
computer, arguing that it would be particularly useful to doctors, nurses, and hospitals. 
Apple’s managers decided not to develop a tablet, however, because they believed the 
technology available at that time was too complex for the average computer user and they 
also believed that the demand from doctors and nurses would be small. As we saw in 
the chapter opener, Apple’s forecast was correct. Despite Bill Gates’s prediction, in 2006, 
tablets made up only 1 percent of the computer market. According to Sobotta, “Apple 
executives had a theory that the route to success will not be through selling thousands of 
relatively expensive things, but millions of very inexpensive things like iPods.”
Apple continued to work on tablets, though, developing the technology to eliminate 
keyboards in favor of touchscreen displays. Rather than proceed immediately to building 
a tablet, Steve Jobs, who was then Apple’s CEO, realized he could use this technology in a 
different way: “I thought ‘My God we can build a phone out of this.’” After the technology 
had been successfully embodied in the iPhone, Apple and Jobs turned back to developing

a tablet computer. The result was the iPad, first offered for sale in April 2010. The iPad was 
an immediate success, selling nearly 15 million units by the end of 2010 and leading other 
firms to introduce competing products. But how rapidly would demand for tablets grow?
Forecasting the demand for any new product is challenging because it is difficult to 
gauge how many consumers will find the new product to be useful. For instance, would 
consumers see tablets as good replacements for laptop computers? If so, the demand for 
tablets might be very large. Or would consumers see tablets as being more like e-readers, 
such as the Amazon Kindle? In that case, demand was likely to be much smaller. In mid-
2011, forecasts of how many tablets would be sold worldwide in 2012 ranged between 
54.8 million and 120 million. Given this uncertainty, firms faced a difficult choice: If they 
were too cautious in expanding capacity or in buying components for a new product, 
other firms might seize a large share of the market. But if they were too optimistic, they 
ran the risk of spending on capacity to produce more units than they could actually sell—
an outcome that might turn potential profits into losses. For example, in 2011, Apple 
forecast that it would sell 40 million iPads during the year. Accordingly, the company 
spent several billion dollars to buy large quantities of touchscreen panels from manu-
facturers, including Wintek, Sharp, and TPK. That would be money well spent . . . if the 
forecast demand turns out to be accurate. Time will tell whether the future demand for 
tablets will be as large as Apple and other firms were forecasting it would be during 2011.

The Supply Side of the Market
Just as many variables influence the willingness and ability of consumers to buy a par-
ticular good or service, many variables also influence the willingness and ability of firms 
to sell a good or service. The most important of these variables is price. The amount of 
a good or service that a firm is willing and able to supply at a given price is the quantity 
supplied. Holding other variables constant, when the price of a good rises, producing the 
good is more profitable, and the quantity supplied will increase. When the price of a good 
falls, the good is less profitable, and the quantity supplied will decrease. In addition, as we 
saw in Chapter 2, devoting more and more resources to the production of a good results in 
increasing marginal costs. If, for example, Apple, Toshiba, Samsung, LG, and other firms 
increase production of tablet computers during a given time period, they are likely to find 
that the cost of producing additional tablets increases as their suppliers run existing facto-
ries for longer hours and pay higher prices for components and higher wages for workers. 
With higher marginal costs, firms will supply a larger quantity only if the price is higher.
Supply Schedules and Supply Curves
A supply schedule is a table that shows the relationship between the price of a prod-
uct and the quantity of the product supplied. The table in Figure 3.4 is a supply sched-
ule showing the quantity of tablet computers that firms would be willing to supply per 
month at different prices. The graph in Figure 3.4 plots the numbers from the supply 
schedule as a supply curve. A supply curve shows the relationship between the price of a 
product and the quantity of the product supplied. The supply schedule and supply curve 
both show that as the price of tablet computers rises, firms will increase the quantity 
they supply. At a price of $600 per tablet, firms will supply 6 million tablets per month. 
At the higher price of $700, firms will supply 7 million. (Once again, we are assum-
ing for convenience that the supply curve is a straight line, even though not all supply 
curves are actually straight lines.)

The Law of Supply
The market supply curve in Figure 3.4 is upward sloping. We expect most supply curves 
to be upward sloping, according to the law of supply, which states that, holding ev-
erything else constant, increases in price cause increases in the quantity supplied, and 
decreases in price cause decreases in the quantity supplied. Notice that the definition of 
the law of supply—like the definition of the law of demand—contains the phrase hold-
ing everything else constant. If only the price of the product changes, there is a move-
ment along the supply curve, which is an increase or a decrease in the quantity supplied. 
As Figure 3.5 shows, if any other variable that affects the willingness of firms to supply 
a good changes, the supply curve will shift, which is an increase or a decrease in supply. 
When firms increase the quantity of a product they want to sell at a given price, the 
supply curve shifts to the right. The shift from S1 to S3 represents an increase in supply. 
When firms decrease the quantity of a product they want to sell at a given price, the sup-
ply curve shifts to the left. The shift from S1 to S2 represents a decrease in supply.

• 
Prices of substitutes in production
• 
Number of firms in the market
• 
Expected future prices
We next discuss how each of these variables affects the market supply curve.
Prices of Inputs The factor most likely to cause the supply curve for a product to 
shift is a change in the price of an input. An input is anything used in the production of 
a good or service. For instance, if the price of a component of tablet computers, such as 
Flash memory, rises, the cost of producing tablet computers will increase, and tablets 
will be less profitable at every price. The supply of tablets will decline, and the market 
supply curve for tablets will shift to the left. Similarly, if the price of an input declines, 
the supply of tablets will increase, and the supply curve will shift to the right.
Technological Change A second factor that causes a change in supply is techno-
logical change. Technological change is a positive or negative change in the ability of a 
firm to produce a given level of output with a given quantity of inputs. Positive techno-
logical change occurs whenever a firm is able to produce more output using the same 
amount of inputs. This shift will happen when the productivity of workers or machines 
increases. If a firm can produce more output with the same amount of inputs, its costs 
will be lower, and the good will be more profitable to produce at any given price. As a 
result, when positive technological change occurs, the firm will increase the quantity 
supplied at every price, and its supply curve will shift to the right. Normally, we ex-
pect technological change to have a positive effect on a firm’s willingness to supply a 
product.
Negative technological change is relatively rare, although it could result from an 
earthquake or another natural disaster or from a war that reduces firms’ ability to supply 
as much output with a given amount of inputs. Negative technological change will raise 
firms’ costs, and the good will be less profitable to produce. Therefore, negative techno-
logical change will cause the market supply curve to shift to the left.
Prices of Substitutes in Production Firms often choose which good or service 
they will produce. Alternative products that a firm could produce are called substitutes 
in production. To this point, we have considered the market for all types of tablet com-
puters. A key feature of tablet computers is whether they connect to the Internet just by 
Wi-Fi or by either Wi-Fi or a cellular network. Suppose we consider as separate markets 
tablet computers capable of only connecting to the Internet by Wi-Fi and tablet com-
puters that can connect either by Wi-Fi or a cellular network. If the price of tablets that 
connect by either Wi-Fi or a cellular network increases, these tablets will become more 
profitable than tablets that connect only by Wi-Fi, and Apple, Toshiba, and the other 
firms making tablets will shift some of their productive capacity away from Wi-Fi–only 
models and toward models that also allow for a cellular connection. The firms will offer 
fewer Wi-Fi–only models for sale at every price, so the supply curve for these tablets will 
shift to the left.
Number of Firms in the Market A change in the number of firms in the market 
will change supply. When new firms enter a market, the supply curve shifts to the right, 
and when existing firms leave, or exit, a market, the supply curve shifts to the left. For 
instance, when Toshiba entered the market for tablet computers in July 2011 by intro-
ducing the Thrive, the market supply curve for tablet computers shifted to the right.
Expected Future Prices If a firm expects that the price of its product will be higher 
in the future than it is today, it has an incentive to decrease supply now and increase it in 
the future. For instance, if Apple believes that prices for tablet computers are temporar-
ily low—perhaps because of a recession—it may store some of its production today to 
sell later on, when it expects prices to be higher.
Technological change A positive or 
negative change in the ability of a firm 
to produce a given level of output with 
a given quantity of inputs.

 
The Supply Side of the Market 
81
Table 3.2 summarizes the most important variables that cause market supply curves 
to shift. Note that the table shows the shift in the supply curve that results from an in-
crease in each of the variables. A decrease in these variables would cause the supply 
curve to shift in the opposite direction.
A Change in Supply versus a Change  
in Quantity Supplied
We noted earlier the important difference between a change in demand and a change in 
quantity demanded. There is a similar difference between a change in supply and a change in 
quantity supplied. A change in supply refers to a shift of the supply curve. The supply curve 
will shift when there is a change in one of the variables, other than the price of the product, 
that affects the willingness of suppliers to sell the product. A change in quantity supplied 
refers to a movement along the supply curve as a result of a change in the product’s price. 
Figure 3.6 illustrates this important distinction. If the price of tablet computers rises from 
$500 to $600 per tablet, the result will be a movement up the supply curve from point A to 
point B—an increase in quantity supplied from 5 million tablets to 6 million tablets. If the 
price of an input decreases or another factor changes that causes sellers to supply more of 
the product at every price, the supply curve will shift to the right—an increase in supply. In 
this case, the increase in supply from S1 to S2 causes the quantity of tablet computers sup-
plied at a price of $600 to increase from 6 million at point B to 8 million at point C.

C H A P T E R  3  Where Prices Come From: The Interaction of Demand and Supply 
Market Equilibrium: Putting Demand 
and Supply Together
The purpose of markets is to bring buyers and sellers together. As we saw in Chapter 2, 
instead of being chaotic and disorderly, the interaction of buyers and sellers in markets 
ultimately results in firms being led to produce the goods and services that consumers 
want most. To understand how this process happens, we first need to see how markets 
work to reconcile the plans of buyers and sellers.
In Figure 3.7, we bring together the market demand curve for tablet computers 
and the market supply curve. Notice that the demand curve crosses the supply curve 
at only one point. This point represents a price of $500 and a quantity of 5 million tab-
lets per month. Only at this point is the quantity of tablets consumers are willing and 
able to buy equal to the quantity of tablets firms are willing and able to sell. This is the 
point of market equilibrium. Only at market equilibrium will the quantity demanded 
equal the quantity supplied. In this case, the equilibrium price is $500, and the equilib-
rium quantity is 5 million. As we noted at the beginning of the chapter, markets that 
have many buyers and many sellers are competitive markets, and equilibrium in these 
markets is a competitive market equilibrium. In the market for tablet computers,

by Apple, Toshiba, Samsung, and the other 
firms from 5 million to 6 million tablets. If 
the price of an input decreases or another 
factor changes that causes sellers to sup-
ply more of the product at every price, the 
supply curve will shift to the right—an in-
crease in supply. In this case, the increase in 
supply from S1 to S2 causes the quantity of 
tablet computers supplied at a price of $600  
to increase from 6 million at point B to 
8 million at point C.

there are many buyers but only about 20 firms. Whether 20 firms is enough for our 
model of demand and supply to apply to this market is a matter of judgment. In this 
chapter, we are assuming that the market for tablet computers has enough sellers to be 
competitive.
How Markets Eliminate Surpluses and Shortages
A market that is not in equilibrium moves toward equilibrium. Once a market is in 
equilibrium, it remains in equilibrium. To see why, consider what happens if a mar-
ket is not in equilibrium. For instance, suppose that the price in the market for tablet 
computers was $600, rather than the equilibrium price of $500. As Figure 3.8 shows, 
at a price of $600, the quantity of tablets supplied would be 6 million, and the quantity 
of tablets demanded would be 4 million. When the quantity supplied is greater than 
the quantity demanded, there is a surplus in the market. In this case, the surplus is 
equal to 2 million tablets (6 million 2 4 million 5 2 million). When there is a surplus, 
firms have unsold goods piling up, which gives them an incentive to increase their 
sales by cutting the price. Cutting the price will simultaneously increase the quantity 
demanded and decrease the quantity supplied. This adjustment will reduce the surplus, 
but as long as the price is above $500, there will be a surplus, and downward pressure 
on the price will continue. Only when the price has fallen to $500 will the market be in 
equilibrium.
If, however, the price were $300, the quantity demanded would be 7 million, and 
the quantity supplied would be 3 million, as shown in Figure 3.8. When the quantity 
demanded is greater than the quantity supplied, there is a shortage in the market. In 
this case, the shortage is equal to 4 million tablets (7 million 2 3 million 5 4 million). 
When a shortage occurs, some consumers will be unable to buy tablet computers at the 
current price. In this situation, firms will realize that they can raise the price without 
losing sales. A higher price will simultaneously increase the quantity supplied and de-
crease the quantity demanded. This adjustment will reduce the shortage, but as long as 
the price is below $500, there will be a shortage, and upward pressure on the price will 
continue. Only when the price has risen to $500 will the market be in equilibrium.
At a competitive market equilibrium, all consumers willing to pay the market price 
will be able to buy as much of the product as they want, and all firms willing to accept 
the market price will be able to sell as much of the product as they want. As a result, 
there will be no reason for the price to change unless either the demand curve or the 
supply curve shifts.
Surplus A situation in which the 
quantity supplied is greater than the 
quantity demanded.
Shortage A situation in which the 
quantity demanded is greater than the 
quantity supplied.
Figure 3.8 
The Effect of Surpluses and 
Shortages on the Market Price
When the market price is above equilib-
rium, there will be a surplus. In the figure, 
a price of $600 for tablet computers results 
in 6 million tablets being supplied but only 
4 million tablets being demanded, or a sur-
plus of 2 million. As Apple, Toshiba, Dell, 
and other firms cut the price to dispose of 
the surplus, the price will fall to the equi-
librium of $500. When the market price is 
below equilibrium, there will be a shortage. 
A price of $300 results in 7 million tablets 
being demanded but only 3 million tablets 
being supplied, or a shortage of 4 million 
tablets. As firms find that consumers who 
are unable to find tablet computers available 
for sale are willing to pay higher prices to 
get them, the price will rise to the equilib-
rium of $500.

C H A P T E R  3  Where Prices Come From: The Interaction of Demand and Supply 
Demand and Supply Both Count
Keep in mind that the interaction of demand and supply determines the equilibrium 
price. Neither consumers nor firms can dictate what the equilibrium price will be. No 
firm can sell anything at any price unless it can find a willing buyer, and no consumer 
can buy anything at any price without finding a willing seller.
Solving the Problem
Step 1: Review the chapter material. This problem is about prices being determined 
at market equilibrium, so you may want to review the section “Market Equi-
librium: Putting Demand and Supply Together,” which begins on page 82.
Step 2: Draw demand curves that illustrate the greater demand for Lincoln’s 
 letters. Begin by drawing two demand curves. Label one “Demand for Lincoln’s 
letters” and the other “Demand for Booth’s letters.” Make sure that the Lincoln 
demand curve is much farther to the right than the Booth demand curve.

Demand and Supply Both Count:  
A Tale of Two Letters
Which letter is likely to be worth more: one written by 
Abraham Lincoln or one written by his assassin, John 
 Wilkes Booth? Lincoln is one of the greatest presidents, 
and many people collect anything he wrote. The demand 
for letters written by Lincoln surely would seem to be much 
greater than the demand for letters written by Booth. Yet 
when R. M. Smythe and Co. auctioned off on the same day 
a letter written by Lincoln and a letter written by Booth, 
the Booth letter sold for $31,050, and the Lincoln letter 
sold for only $21,850. Use a demand and supply graph to 
explain how the Booth letter has a higher market price 
than the Lincoln letter, even though the demand for letters 
written by Lincoln is greater than the demand for letters 
written by Booth.

Step 3: Draw supply curves that illustrate the equilibrium price of Booth’s letters 
being higher than the equilibrium price of Lincoln’s letters. Based on the 
demand curves you have just drawn, think about how it might be possible 
for the market price of Lincoln’s letters to be lower than the market price of 
Booth’s letters. The only way this can be true is if the supply of Lincoln’s letters 
is much greater than the supply of Booth’s letters. Draw on your graph a sup-
ply curve for Lincoln’s letters and a supply curve for Booth’s letters that will 
result in an equilibrium price of Booth’s letters of $31,050 and an equilibrium 
price of Lincoln’s letters of $21,850. You have now solved the problem.
Extra Credit: The explanation for this puzzle is that both demand and supply count when 
determining market price. The demand for Lincoln’s letters is much greater than the

 demand for Booth’s letters, but the supply of Booth’s letters is very small. Historians believe 
that only eight letters written by Booth exist today. (Note that the supply curves for letters 
written by Booth and by Lincoln are upward sloping, even though only a fixed number of 
each of these types of letters is available and, obviously, no more can be produced. The up-
ward slope of the supply curves occurs because the higher the price, the larger the quantity 
of letters that will be offered for sale by people who currently own them.)

The Effect of Demand and Supply Shifts 
on Equilibrium
We have seen that the interaction of demand and supply in markets determines the quan-
tity of a good that is produced and the price at which it sells. We have also seen that several 
variables cause demand curves to shift and other variables cause supply curves to shift. As 
a result, demand and supply curves in most markets are constantly shifting, and the prices 
and quantities that represent equilibrium are constantly changing. In this section, we look 
at how shifts in demand and supply curves affect equilibrium price and quantity.

1. As Toshiba enters the market for tablet 
computers, a larger quantity of tablets 
will be supplied at every price, so the

from S1 to S2, which causes a surplus of 
tablets at the original price, P1.

C H A P T E R  3  Where Prices Come From: The Interaction of Demand and Supply 
The Falling Price of Blu-ray Players
The technology for playing prerecorded movies has progressed 
rapidly during the past 30 years. Video cassette recorders 
(VCRs) were introduced in Japan in 1976 and in the United States in 1977. As the first 
way of recording television programs or playing prerecorded movies, VHS players were 
immensely popular. In 1997, though, digital video disc (DVD) players became available 
in the United States. DVDs could store more information than could the VHS tapes 
played on VCRs and could produce a crisper picture. Within a few years, sales of DVD 
players were greater than sales of VCRs, and by 2006 the movie studios had stopped 
releasing films on VHS tapes. In 2006, Blu-ray players were introduced. Because Blu-ray 
discs can store 25 gigabytes of data, compared with fewer than 5 gigabytes on a typical 
DVD, Blu-ray players can reproduce high-definition images that DVD players cannot.
When firms first began selling VCRs, DVD players, and Blu-ray players, they ini-
tially charged high prices that declined rapidly within a few years. As the figure below 
shows, the average price of a Blu-ray player was about $800 in May 2006, but it had de-
clined to about $120 in December 2010. Sales of Blu-ray players rose from about 425,000  
in 2006 to 11.25 million in 2010. The figure shows that the decline in price and increase in  
quantity resulted from a large shift to the right of the supply curve. The supply curve 
in 2010 was much farther to the right than the supply curve in 2006 for two reasons: 
First, after Samsung introduced the first Blu-ray player—at a price of $999—other firms 
entered the industry, increasing the quantity supplied at every price. Second, the prices 
of the parts used in manufacturing Blu-ray players, particularly the laser components, 
declined sharply. As the cost of manufacturing the players declined, the quantity sup-
plied at every price increased.

supply curve shifting from S1 to S2. When the supply curve shifts to the right, there 
will be a surplus at the original equilibrium price, P1. The surplus is eliminated as the 
equilibrium price falls to P2, and the equilibrium quantity rises from Q1 to Q2. If exist-
ing firms exit the market, the supply curve will shift to the left, causing the equilibrium 
price to rise and the equilibrium quantity to fall.

The Effect of Shifts in Demand on Equilibrium
Because tablet computers are a normal good, when incomes increase, the market de-
mand curve for tablet computers shifts to the right. Figure 3.10 shows the effect of a 
demand curve shifting to the right, from D1 to D2. This shift causes a shortage at the 
original equilibrium price, P1. To eliminate the shortage, the equilibrium price rises to 
P2, and the equilibrium quantity rises from Q1 to Q2. In contrast, if the price of a sub-
stitute good, such as laptop computers, were to fall, the demand for tablet computers 
would decrease, shifting the demand curve for tablets to the left. When the demand 
curve shifts to the left, the equilibrium price and quantity will both decrease.
The Effect of Shifts in Demand and Supply  
over Time
Whenever only demand or only supply shifts, we can easily predict the effect on equi-
librium price and quantity. But what happens if both curves shift? For instance, in many 
markets, the demand curve shifts to the right over time as population and income grow. 
The supply curve also often shifts to the right as new firms enter the market and posi-
tive technological change occurs. Whether the equilibrium price in a market rises or 
falls over time depends on whether demand shifts to the right more than does supply. 
Panel (a) of Figure 3.11 shows that when demand shifts to the right more than supply, 
the equilibrium price rises. But, as panel (b) shows, when supply shifts to the right more 
than demand, the equilibrium price falls.
Table 3.3 summarizes all possible combinations of shifts in demand and supply over 
time and the effects of the shifts on equilibrium price (P) and quantity (Q). For example, 
the entry in red in the table shows that if the demand curve shifts to the right and the 
supply curve also shifts to the right, the equilibrium quantity will increase, while the 
equilibrium price may increase, decrease, or remain unchanged. To make sure you un-
derstand each entry in the table, draw demand and supply graphs to check whether you 
can reproduce the predicted changes in equilibrium price and quantity. If the entry in 
the table says the predicted change in equilibrium price or quantity can be either an 
increase or a decrease, draw two graphs similar to panels (a) and (b) of Figure 3.11, one 
showing the equilibrium price or quantity increasing and the other showing it decreas-
ing. Note also that in the ambiguous cases where either price or quantity might increase 
or decrease, it is also possible that price or quantity might remain unchanged. Be sure 
you understand why this is true.

Increases in income will cause the equilib-

a shortage of tablet computers at the

Solved Problem 3.4
High Demand and Low Prices  
in the Lobster Market?
During a typical spring, when demand for lobster is rela-
tively low, Maine lobstermen can typically sell their lobster 
catches for about $6.00 per pound. During the summer, 
when demand for lobster is much higher, Maine lobstermen 
can typically sell their lobster catches for only about $3.00 
per pound. One recent July, a lobster-boat captain noted, 
“Per pound, it’s less expensive than hot dogs right now.” It 
may seem strange that the market price is higher when de-
mand is low than when demand is high. Resolve this para-
dox, with the help of a demand and supply graph.

 
The Effect of Demand and Supply Shifts on Equilibrium

Solving the Problem
Step 1: Review the chapter material. This problem is about how shifts in demand 
and supply curves affect the equilibrium price, so you may want to review the 
section “The Effect of Shifts in Demand and Supply over Time,” which begins 
on page 87.
Step 2: Draw the demand and supply graph. Draw a demand and supply graph, 
showing the market equilibrium in the spring. Label the equilibrium price 
$6.00. Label both the demand and supply curves “in spring.”
Supply

Step 4: Explain the graph. After studying the graph, it is possible to see how the 
equilibrium price can fall from $6.00 to $3.00, despite the increase in de-
mand: The supply curve must have shifted to the right by enough to cause 
the equilibrium price to fall to $3.00. Draw the new supply curve, label it “in 
summer,” and label the new equilibrium price $3.00. The demand for lobster 
does increase in summer compared with spring. But the increase in the sup-
ply of lobster between spring and summer is even greater. So, the equilibrium 
price falls.
Step 3: Add to your graph a demand curve for summer.

Remember: A Change in a Good’s Price 
Does Not Cause the Demand or Supply 
Curve to Shift
Suppose a student is asked to draw a demand and supply 
graph to illustrate how an increase in the price of oranges 
would affect the market for apples, other variables being 
constant. He draws the graph on the left below and explains 
it as follows: “Because apples and oranges are substitutes, 
an increase in the price of oranges will cause an initial shift 
to the right in the demand curve for apples, from D1 to D2. 
However, because this initial shift in the demand curve for 
apples results in a higher price for apples, P2, consumers will 
find apples less desirable, and the demand curve will shift to 
the left, from D2 to D3, resulting in a final equilibrium price 
of P3.” Do you agree or disagree with the student’s analysis?
You should disagree. The student has correctly under-
stood that an increase in the price of oranges will cause the 
demand curve for apples to shift to the right. But the second 
demand curve shift the student describes, from D2 to D3, will 
not take place. Changes in the price of a product do not result 
in shifts in the product’s demand curve. Changes in the price 
of a product result only in movements along a demand curve.
The graph on the right below shows the correct analy-
sis. The increase in the price of oranges causes the demand 
curve for apples to increase from D1 to D2. At the origi-
nal price, P1, the increase in demand initially results in a 
shortage of apples equal to Q3 − Q1. But, as we have seen, 
a shortage causes the price to increase until the shortage 
is eliminated. In this case, the price will rise to P2, where 
the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied are both 
equal to Q2. Notice that the increase in price causes a de-
crease in the quantity demanded, from Q3 to Q2, but does 
not cause a decrease in demand.

Conclusion 
91
Shifts in a Curve versus Movements along a Curve
When analyzing markets using demand and supply curves, it is important to remember 
that when a shift in a demand or supply curve causes a change in equilibrium price, the 
change in price does not cause a further shift in demand or supply. For instance, suppose 
an increase in supply causes the price of a good to fall, while everything else that affects 
the willingness of consumers to buy the good is constant. The result will be an increase 
in the quantity demanded but not an increase in demand. For demand to increase, the 
whole curve must shift. The point is the same for supply: If the price of the good falls 
but everything else that affects the willingness of sellers to supply the good is constant, 
the quantity supplied decreases, but the supply does not. For supply to decrease, the 
whole curve must shift.

Economics in Your Life
Will You Buy an Apple iPad or a Samsung Galaxy Tab?
At the beginning of the chapter, we asked you to consider two questions: Would you choose to 
buy a Samsung Galaxy Tab tablet if it had a lower price than an Apple iPad? and Would your deci-
sion be affected if your income increased? To determine the answer to the first question, you have 
to recognize that the iPad and the Galaxy Tab are substitutes. If you consider the two tablets to 
be very close substitutes, then you are likely to buy the one with the lower price. In the market, if 
consumers generally believe that iPad and the Galaxy Tab are close substitutes, a fall in the price of 
the iPad will increase the quantity of iPads demanded and decrease the demand for Galaxy Tabs. 
Suppose that you are currently leaning toward buying the Galaxy Tab because its price is lower 
than the price of the iPad. If an increase in your income would cause you to change your decision 
and buy the iPad, then the Galaxy Tab is an inferior good for you.
Conclusion
The interaction of demand and supply determines market equilibrium. The model of 
demand and supply is a powerful tool for predicting how changes in the actions of con-
sumers and firms will cause changes in equilibrium prices and quantities. As we have 
seen in this chapter, we can use the model to analyze markets that do not meet all the 
requirements for being perfectly competitive. As long as there is intense competition 
among sellers, the model of demand and supply can often successfully predict changes 
in prices and quantities. We will use this model in the next chapter to analyze economic 
efficiency and the results of government-imposed price floors and price ceilings.

between the haves and have-nots 
among the panel suppliers,” Dash said. 
“Those panel makers that have their 
own internal manufacturing of LEDs 
will have sufficient supply in 2010, 
while those that don’t will encounter 
constraints.”
Tablets aren’t the only things caus-
ing the crunch. The overall popular-
ity of LED-backlit LCD displays in 
televisions and computers could also 
help tighten supply for display compo-
nents. iSuppli said last week that more 
than two-thirds of large LCD panels 
shipped worldwide in 2011 will incor-
porate LED backlights, up from less 
than one-half in 2010. This year, LED 
penetration in television and monitor 
panels will hit almost 50 percent com-
pared with 20 percent last year, while 
LED backlighting in notebooks and 
netbooks is expected to be 100 percent.
With so much competition in the 
coming year, we might not see any 
one tablet place the demands on the 
component supply chain that the iPad 
did. But if the tablet market evolves 
as many are predicting, the race will 
be on to snap up display components 
and fast. Apple is getting ready for the 
tablet revolution and, in doing so, has 
shone a light on the importance of the 
electronics supply chain.

make sense for Apple to lock up the 
necessary components to ensure the 
iPad success story continues.
Tablet competitors may do well to 
follow Apple’s example. Last month, 
Frank Chien, chairman of Formosa 
Epitaxy, a leading Taiwanese LED 
maker, predicted that demand for 
high-end LED chips for LCD displays 
could outstrip supply starting next 
month as tablet production ramps up 
across the industry. ISuppli said ear-
lier this month that global tablet ship-
ments are expected to hit 57.6 million 
units, up from 17.1 million in 2010. 
The overall demand for a relatively 
new product, however, is still form-
ing, said iSuppli. The unpredictability 
of the nascent market could put a lot 
of pressure on display makers, which 
may face shortages or potentially 
oversupply as they try to guess how 
the tablet market performs.
In-House Technology
For those building tablets, the 
challenge may be to make sure they 
have enough display panels to meet 
demand. The best companies might 
be the ones that have access to their 
own display technology, companies 
like Samsung, LG, and Sharp. And 
even among display makers, the best 
positioned manufacturers will be 
those that have the LED-chip technol-
ogy in-house, said Sweta Dash, senior 
director for LCD research at iSuppli in 
a story in LED Magazine last year.

Guess What Could 
Stop the Tablet 
Revolution?
With 2011 shaping up to be the Year of 
the Tablet, securing the display com-
ponents for the looming army of tab-
lets may be a key factor in determining 
success. Last year we saw that the fast 
start for the iPad prompted LCD dis-
play shortages from Apple supplier LG, 
which said it was having a hard time 
keeping up with demand. Now with 
Apple (AAPL) selling 7.3 million iPads 
in the December quarter, the iPad 2 on 
the way, and seemingly every manu-
facturer at CES prepping a rival, the 
display component crunch could con-
strain the flow of tablets and hurt some 
manufacturers that aren’t prepared.
The focus on displays may be 
what Apple was referring to when it 
reported last week during its earning 
call that it was investing $3.9 billion to 
secure inventory components through 
three vendors. MacRumors speculated 
that the sum was aimed at shoring up 
Apple’s access to displays, especially 
ahead of the iPad 2 launch. In Decem-
ber, Apple reportedly struck two deals 
with Toshiba (TOSYY) and Sharp 
(SHCAY) to manufacture displays,  
though Sharp denied the report. Apple, 
according to Digitimes, is also secur-
ing iPad display-panel shipments for

Samsung, and Chimei Innolux. That’s

The overwhelming success of the iPad in 
2010 resulted in a shortage of screens from 
LG, the main supplier of this component. In 
2011, Apple made arrangements with sev-
eral other suppliers to provide the screens 
for the iPad. The growing popularity of tab-
let computers and the introduction of tab-
lets by an increasing number of firms have 
many of them concerned about the compo-
nent shortages, which has resulted in firms 
scrambling to obtain display screens. iSup-
pli, a market research firm specializing in the 
electronics industry, projected that global 
tablet shipments would increase from 17.1 
million in 2010 to over 57 million in 2011.
Analyzing the News
a Apple is the industry leader in the man-
ufacture and sale of tablet computers. 
In an effort to ensure that it can keep pace 
with demand, Apple has made arrange-
ments with several manufacturers to supply 
display components for the iPad. In addi-
tion to reported deals with Toshiba and 
Sharp to supply display screens, Apple is 
also reported to have secured 65 million 
screens from three additional manufactur-
ers. The market for tablet computers has 
grown tremendously over the past year, 
with an increase in consumers’ taste for the 
product fueling the increase in demand. 
Figure 1 shows that an increase in consum-
ers’ taste for tablet computers will increase 
the demand for them, shifting the demand 
curve to the right. All else equal, the in-
crease in demand increases both the equi-
librium price and the equilibrium quantity of 
tablet computers.
b A few of the firms that produce tablets 
also produce the display screen com-
ponents, and by virtue of producing their 
own displays, these companies may have a 
significant advantage in meeting demand. 
Assuming that these firms will supply dis-
play screens for their own tablets before 
supplying screens to other firms, the other 
firms may find themselves facing a short-
age of screens. The way to eliminate a 
shortage in a market is to raise the selling 
price of the product. The screen manufac-
turers may choose to raise the price of the 
screen component to alleviate the short-
age, but this increase in the input price will 
result in a decrease in the supply of tablet 
computers. Figure 2 shows that the de-
crease in supply of an input causes the 
supply curve to shift to the left. All else 
equal, the decrease in supply increases the 
equilibrium price and decreases the equi-
librium quantity of tablet computers.
c In addition to tablet computers, the 
LED backlight components used in the 
production of LCD display screens are be-
ing used in a growing number of televisions 
and laptop and netbook computers. These 
alternative uses for the display screen com-
ponents could further exacerbate the short-
age of screens for use in tablets. Unless the 
manufacturers are able to increase produc-
tion, firms that produce both tablet com-
puters and other products that use display 
screen components may not be able to 
keep up with the expected increases in 
 demand for their products.
Thinking Critically
1. The article discusses the potential 
shortage of tablet computers due to an 
insufficient number of display screen 
components used in production. Briefly 
explain how any potential shortage will 
be eliminated in the market for tablet 
computers.
2. Suppose the demand for tablet comput-
ers continues to increase and that sup-
pliers of the display screens are not able 
to produce enough components to keep 
up with the increasing demand, and as 
a result, increase the price of each dis-
play screen. Draw a demand and supply 
graph that shows both of these situa-
tions occurring in the market for tablet 
computers. Explain what is happening 
in the graph and the effect these events 
will have on the equilibrium price and 
equilibrium quantity.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE: Discuss the variables that influence demand.
Summary
The model of demand and supply is the most powerful tool in eco-
nomics. The model applies exactly only to perfectly competitive 
markets, where there are many buyers and sellers, all the products 
sold are identical, and there are no barriers to new sellers entering 
the market. But the model can also be useful in analyzing markets 
that don’t meet all these requirements. The quantity demanded 
is the amount of a good or service that a consumer is willing and 
able to purchase at a given price. A demand schedule is a table that 
shows the relationship between the price of a product and the quan-
tity of the product demanded. A demand curve is a graph that shows 
the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity of the 
good demanded. Market demand is the demand by all consumers 
of a given good or service. The law of demand states that ceteris 
 paribus—holding everything else constant—the quantity of a pro d-
uct demanded increases when the price falls and decreases when the 
price rises. Demand curves slope downward because of the substitu-
tion effect, which is the change in quantity demanded that results 
from a price change making one good more or less expensive relative 
to another good, and the income effect, which is the change in quan-
tity demanded of a good that results from the effect of a change in the 
good’s price on consumer purchasing power. Changes in income, the 
prices of related goods, tastes, population and demographics, and ex-
pected future prices all cause the demand curve to shift. Substitutes 
are goods that can be used for the same purpose. Complements are 
goods that are used together. A normal good is a good for which de-
mand increases as income increases. An inferior good is a good for 
which demand decreases as income increases. Demographics refers 
to the characteristics of a population with respect to age, race, and 
gender. A change in demand refers to a shift of the demand curve. 
A change in quantity demanded refers to a movement along the de-
mand curve as a result of a change in the product’s price.

Since 1979, China has had a policy that allows couples to 
have only one child. This policy has caused a change in the 
demographics of China. Between 2000 and 2010, the share 
of the population under age 14 decreased from 23 percent 
to 17 percent, and, as parents attempt to ensure that the lone 
child is a son, the number of newborn males relative to fe-
males has increased. How has the one-child policy changed 
the relative demand for goods and services in China?

ner’s views on the effect of online bookstores and e-books 
on the demand for books:
Posner’s [argument] is that the disappear-
ance of bookstores is to be celebrated and not 
mourned, partly because e-books and online 
stores will reduce the cost of books and thus 
drive up demand for them.
 
 Do you agree with Posner’s statement, as given by the re-
porter? Briefly explain.

Market Equilibrium: Putting Demand and Supply Together, pages 82–85
 3.3 
LEARNING OBJECTIVE: Use a graph to illustrate market equilibrium.
Summary
Market equilibrium occurs where the demand curve intersects 
the supply curve. A competitive market equilibrium has a 
market equilibrium with many buyers and many sellers. Only 
at this point is the quantity demanded equal to the quantity 
supplied. Prices above equilibrium result in surpluses, with the 
quantity supplied being greater than the quantity demanded. 
Surpluses cause the market price to fall. Prices below equilib-
rium result in shortages, with the quantity demanded being 
greater than the quantity supplied. Shortages cause the market 
price to rise.

Problems and Applications
 
3.4 Briefly explain whether you agree with the following state-
ment: “When there is a shortage of a good, consumers 
eventually give up trying to buy it, so the demand for the 
good declines, and the price falls until the market is finally 
in equilibrium.”
producing the product is more profitable, and a greater amount 
will be supplied. The law of supply states that, holding everything 
else constant, the quantity of a product supplied increases when 
the price rises and decreases when the price falls. Changes in the 
prices of inputs, technology, the prices of substitutes in produc-
tion, expected future prices, and the number of firms in a market 
all cause the supply curve to shift. Technological change is a posi-
tive or negative change in the ability of a firm to produce a given 
level of output with a given quantity of inputs. A change in supply 
refers to a shift of the supply curve. A change in quantity supplied 
refers to a movement along the supply curve as a result of a change 
in the product’s price.

3.5 [Related to Solved Problem 3.3 on page 84] In The 
Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith discussed what has come 
to be known as the “diamond and water paradox”:
Nothing is more useful than water: but it will 
purchase scarce anything; scarce anything can 
be had in exchange for it. A diamond, on the 
contrary, has scarce any value in use; but a very 
great quantity of other goods may frequently 
be had in exchange for it.
 
 Graph the market for diamonds and the market for water. 
Show how it is possible for the price of water to be much 
lower than the price of diamonds, even though the demand 
for water is much greater than the demand for diamonds.

3.6 [Related to Solved Problem 3.3 on page 84] An article

superstar centerfielder for the New York Yankees during 
the 1950s and 1960s: “At card shows, golf outings, char-
ity dinners, Mr. Mantle signed his name over and over.” 
One expert on sport autographs is quoted as saying: “He 
was a real good signer. . . . He is not rare.” Yet the article 
quotes another expert as saying: “Mr. Mantle’s autograph 
ranks No. 3 of most-popular autographs, behind Babe 
Ruth and Muhammad Ali.” A baseball signed by Mantle is 
likely to sell for the relatively high price of $250 to $400. 
By contrast, baseballs signed by Whitey Ford, a teammate 
of Mantle’s on the Yankees, typically sell for less than $150. 
Use one graph to show both the demand and supply for 
autographs by Whitey Ford and the demand and supply for 
autographs by Mickey Mantle. Show how it is possible for 
the price of Mantle’s autographs to be higher than the price 
of Ford’s autographs, even though the supply of Mantle au-
tographs is larger than the supply of Ford autographs.

Summary
In most markets, demand and supply curves shift frequently, caus-
ing changes in equilibrium prices and quantities. Over time, if de-
mand increases more than supply, equilibrium price will rise. If 
supply increases more than demand, equilibrium price will fall.

4.3 The following is from an article in the Wall Street Journal:
Fuel prices tend to rise [during the summer] for  
a number of reasons, from the use of more 
 expensive fuel additives in warm weather to 
maintenance shutdowns at refineries that tend to 
tighten the supply. Demand for gasoline also tradi-
tionally rises during the summer driving season as 
more people head out on long vacation road trips.
 
 Draw a demand and supply graph of the market for gasoline to 
analyze the situation described in this article. Be sure to indi-
cate the equilibrium price of gasoline at the beginning of sum-
mer, the equilibrium price of gasoline during summer, and any 
shifts in the demand curve and supply curve for gasoline.

C H A P T E R  3  Where Prices Come From: The Interaction of Demand and Supply 
 
a. Draw a demand and supply graph for the corn market 
and use it to show the effect on this market of an in-
crease in the demand for ethanol. Be sure to indicate 
the equilibrium price and quantity before and after the 
increase in the demand for ethanol.
 
b. Draw a demand and supply graph for the tortilla mar-
ket and use it to show the effect on this market of an 
increase in the price of corn. Once again, be sure to 
indicate the equilibrium price and quantity before and 
after the increase in the demand for ethanol.
 
c. During 2009, the demand for gasoline had fallen, low-
ering its price. The demand for ethanol had declined as 
well. Ethanol producers, though, were asking the Envi-
ronmental Protection Agency (EPA) to raise the allowable 
amount of ethanol in gasoline blends from 10 percent to 
15 percent. If the EPA were to agree to this proposal, what 
would be the likely effect on tortilla prices?

pected that several smaller television manufacturers might 
exit the market. Use a demand and supply graph to analyze 
the effects of these factors on the equilibrium price and 
quantity of LCD televisions. Clearly show on your graph 
the old equilibrium price and quantity and the new equi-
librium price and quantity. Can you tell for certain whether 
the new equilibrium price will be higher or lower than the 
old equilibrium price? Briefly explain.
 
4.7 [Related to Solved Problem 3.4 on page 88] The demand

4.9 Years ago, an apple producer argued that the United States 
should enact a tariff, or a tax, on imports of bananas. 
His reasoning was that “the enormous imports of cheap 
 bananas into the United States tend to curtail the domes-
tic consumption of fresh fruits produced in the United 
States.”
 
a. Was the apple producer assuming that apples and ba-
nanas are substitutes or complements? Briefly explain.
 
b. If a tariff on bananas acts as an increase in the cost 
of supplying bananas in the United States, use two 
demand and supply graphs to show the effects of the 
apple producer’s proposal. One graph should show the 
effect on the banana market in the United States, and 
the other graph should show the effect on the apple 
market in the United States. Be sure to label the change 
in equilibrium price and quantity in each market and 
any shifts in the demand and supply curves.

 4.11 Historically, the production of many perishable foods, 
such as dairy products, was highly seasonal. Thus, as 
the supply of those products fluctuated, prices tended to 
fluctuate  tremendously—typically by 25 to 50 percent or 
more—over the course of the year. One impact of mechan-
ical refrigeration, which was commercialized on a large 
scale in the last decade of the nineteenth century, was that 
suppliers could store perishables from one season to the 
next. Economists have estimated that as a result of refriger-
ated storage, wholesale prices rose by roughly 10 percent 
during peak supply  periods, while they fell by almost the 
same amount during the off season. Use a demand and 
supply graph for each season to illustrate how refrigeration 
affected the market for perishable food.
Based on Lee A. Craig, Barry Goodwin, and Thomas Grennes, “The 
 Effect of Mechanical Refrigeration on Nutrition in the U.S.,” Social 
Science History, Vol. 28, No. 2, Summer 2004, pp. 327–328.
 4.12 Briefly explain whether each of the following statements is 
true or false.
 
a. If the demand and supply for a product both increase, the 
equilibrium quantity of the product must also increase.
 
b. If the demand and supply for a product both increase, 
the equilibrium price of the product must also increase.
 
c. If the demand for a product decreases and the sup-
ply of the product increases, the equilibrium price of 
the product may increase or decrease, depending on 
whether supply or demand has shifted more.

A student writes the following: “Increased production 
leads to a lower price, which in turn increases demand.” 
Do you agree with his reasoning? Briefly explain.

A student was asked to draw a demand and supply graph 
to illustrate the effect on the tablet computers market of 
a fall in the price of displays used in tablet computers, 
 holding everything else constant. She drew the graph be-
low and explained it as follows:
Displays are an input to tablet computers, so a 
fall in the price of displays will cause the sup-
ply curve for tablets to shift to the right (from 
S1 to S2). Because this shift in the supply curve 
results in a lower price (P2), consumers will 
want to buy more tablets, and the demand 
curve will shift to the right (from D1 to D2). 
We know that more tablets will be sold, but 

 
Chapter Summary and Problems 
99
we can’t be sure whether the price of tablets 
will rise or fall. That depends on whether the 
supply curve or the demand curve has shifted 
farther to the right. I assume that the effect on 
supply is greater than the effect on demand, so 
I show the final equilibrium price (P3) as being 
lower than the initial equilibrium price (P1).
 
 Explain whether you agree or disagree with the student’s 
analysis. Be careful to explain exactly what—if anything—
you find wrong with her analysis.

that these regulations increase the quality of childcare and 
cause the demand for childcare services to increase. At the

Does Rent Control Make It Easier for You to Find an Affordable Apartment?
Suppose you have job offers in two cities. One factor in deciding which job to accept is whether you 
can find an affordable apartment. If one city has rent control, are you more likely to find an afford-
able apartment in that city, or would you be better off looking for an apartment in a city without 
rent control? As you read the chapter, see if you can answer this question. You can check your an-
swer against the one we provide on page 121 at the end of this chapter.
be deregulated if the income of the tenants 
has been $175,000 or more for two years.
As this description shows, someone 
earning a living by renting out apartments 
in New York City has to deal with much 
more complex government regulation of 
prices than someone who owns, for in-
stance, a McDonald’s restaurant.
Tenants in rent-controlled apartments in 
New York are reluctant to see rent control end 
because rents for those apartments are much 
lower than rents for apartments that aren’t 
rent controlled. Although rent control laws 
are intended to make housing more affordable 
for people with low incomes, high-income 
people can end up benefiting. For example, in 
New York City, rent control has resulted in ac-
tress Mia Farrow and television host Alistair 
Cooke living for many years in large apart-
ments overlooking Central Park, while paying 
rents far below market levels. When the FBI 
arrested James “Whitey” Bulger, a former Bos-
ton crime boss, in 2011, they discovered that 
he had been living for more than 15 years in 
a rent-controlled  apartment in Santa Monica.
AN INSIDE LOOK AT POLICY on 
page 122 discusses a legal battle between 
Oscar-winning actress Faye Dunaway and 
the landlord of her rent- controlled New York 
City apartment.
Based on Robert F. Moss, “A Landlord’s Lot Is Sometimes 
Not an Easy One,” New York Times, August 3, 2003; and 
Lynda Gorov, “Whitey Bulger Used Rent-Controlled Apart-
ment Since Mid-1990s, Property Manager Says,” The 
 Boston Globe, June 23, 2011.
Robert F. Moss owns an apartment building 
in New York City. Unlike most other business 
owners, he is not free to charge the prices he 
would like for the service he offers. In New 
York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and nearly 
200 smaller cities, apartments are subject to 
rent control by the local government. Rent 
control puts a legal limit on the rent that 
landlords can charge for an apartment.
New York City has 2 million apartments, 
about half of which are subject to rent control. 
The other 1 million apartments have their 
rents determined in the market by the de-
mand and supply for apartments. Mr. Moss’s 
building includes apartments that are rent 
controlled and apartments that are not. The 
 market-determined rents are usually far above 
the controlled rents. The government regula-
tions that determine what Mr. Moss can charge 
for a rent-controlled apartment are very com-
plex. The following is Mr. Moss’s description:
When [an apartment] is vacated, state rent 
laws entitle landlords to raise rents in three 
primary ways: a vacancy increase of 20 per-
cent for a new tenant’s two-year lease (a bit 
less for a one-year lease); one-fortieth per 
month of the cost of any improvements, 
and a “longevity bonus” for longtime resi-
dents (calculated at six-tenths of 1 percent 
times the tenant’s last legal rent multiplied 
by the number of years of residency be-
yond eight). . . . Apartments renting for 
$2,000 a month are automatically deregu-
lated if they are vacant. Occupied apart-
ments whose rent reaches that figure can

e saw in Chapter 3 that in a competitive market the price adjusts to 
ensure that the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied. Stated 
another way, in equilibrium, every consumer willing to pay the market 
price is able to buy as much of the product as the consumer wants, and 
every firm willing to accept the market price can sell as much as it wants. Even so, consum-
ers would naturally prefer to pay a lower price, and sellers would prefer to receive a higher 
price. Normally, consumers and firms have no choice but to accept the equilibrium price if 
they wish to participate in the market. Occasionally, however, consumers succeed in hav-
ing the government impose a price ceiling, which is a legally determined maximum price 
that sellers may charge. Rent control is an example of a price ceiling. Firms also sometimes 
succeed in having the government impose a price floor, which is a legally determined 
minimum price that sellers may receive. In markets for farm products such as milk, the 
government has been setting price floors that are above the equilibrium market price since 
the 1930s.
Another way the government intervenes in markets is by imposing taxes. The govern-
ment relies on the revenue raised from taxes to finance its operations. Unfortunately, when-
ever the government imposes a price ceiling, a price floor, or a tax, there are predictable 
negative economic consequences. It is important for government policymakers and voters to 
understand the negative consequences when evaluating these policies. Economists have de-
veloped the concepts of consumer surplus, producer surplus, and economic surplus to analyze 
the economic effects of price ceilings, price floors, and taxes.
Consumer Surplus and Producer Surplus
Consumer surplus measures the dollar benefit consumers receive from buying goods 
or services in a particular market. Producer surplus measures the dollar benefit firms 
receive from selling goods or services in a particular market. Economic surplus in a 
market is the sum of consumer surplus plus producer surplus. As we will see, when the 
government imposes a price ceiling or a price floor, the amount of economic surplus in a 
market is reduced—in other words, price ceilings and price floors reduce the total ben-
efit to consumers and firms from buying and selling in a market. To understand why 
this is true, we need to understand how consumer surplus and producer surplus are 
determined.
Consumer Surplus
Consumer surplus is the difference between the highest price a consumer is willing to 
pay for a good or service and the price the consumer actually pays. For example, sup-
pose you are in Wal-Mart, and you see a DVD of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, 
Part 2 on the rack. No price is indicated on the package, so you take it over to the reg-
ister to check the price. As you walk to the register, you think to yourself that $18 is the 
highest price you would be willing to pay. At the register, you find out that the price is 
actually $12, so you buy the DVD. Your consumer surplus in this example is $6: the dif-
ference between the $18 you were willing to pay and the $12 you actually paid.
We can use the demand curve to measure the total consumer surplus in a mar-
ket. Demand curves show the willingness of consumers to purchase a product at dif-
ferent prices. Consumers are willing to purchase a product up to the point where the 
marginal benefit of consuming a product is equal to its price. The marginal benefit 
is the additional benefit to a consumer from consuming one more unit of a good or 
service. As a simple example, suppose there are only four consumers in the market 
for chai tea: Theresa, Tom, Terri, and Tim. Because these four consumers have dif-
ferent tastes for tea and different incomes, the marginal benefit each of them receives 
Price ceiling A legally determined 
maximum price that sellers may charge.
Price floor A legally determined 
minimum price that sellers may

from consuming a cup of tea will be different. Therefore, the highest price each is 
willing to pay for a cup of tea is also different. In Figure 4.1, the information from the 
table is used to construct a demand curve for chai tea. For prices above $6 per cup, 
no tea is sold because $6 is the highest price any of the consumers is willing to pay. 
At a price of $5, both Theresa and Tom are willing to buy tea, so two cups are sold. 
At prices of $3 and below, all four  consumers are willing to buy tea, and four cups  
are sold.
Suppose the market price of tea is $3.50 per cup. As Figure 4.2 shows, the demand 
curve allows us to calculate the total consumer surplus in this market. In panel (a), 
Figure 4.1 
Deriving the Demand Curve  
for Chai Tea
With four consumers in the market for chai 
tea, the demand curve is determined by the 
highest price each consumer is willing to 
pay. For prices above $6, no tea is sold be-
cause $6 is the highest price any consumer 
is willing to pay. For prices of $3 and below, 
every one of the four consumers is willing to 
buy a cup of tea.

 Figure 4.2  Measuring Consumer Surplus
Panel (a) shows the consumer surplus for Theresa, Tom, and Terri when the price 
of tea is $3.50 per cup. Theresa’s consumer surplus is equal to the area of rectangle 
A and is the difference between the highest price she would pay—$6—and the 
market price of $3.50. Tom’s consumer surplus is equal to the area of rectangle B, 
and Terri’s consumer surplus is equal to the area of rectangle C. Total consumer 
surplus in this market is equal to the sum of the areas of rectangles A, B, and C, or 
the total area below the demand curve and above the market price. In panel (b), 
consumer surplus increases by the shaded area as the market price declines from 
$3.50 to $3.00.

104 
C H A P T E R  4   Economic Efficiency, Government Price Setting, and Taxes
we can see that the highest price Theresa is willing to pay is $6, but because she pays 
only $3.50, her consumer surplus is $2.50 (shown by the area of rectangle A). Similarly, 
Tom’s consumer surplus is $1.50 (rectangle B), and Terri’s consumer surplus is $0.50 
(rectangle C). Tim is unwilling to buy a cup of tea at a price of $3.50, so he doesn’t par-
ticipate in this market and receives no consumer surplus. In this simple example, the 
total consumer surplus is equal to $2.50 + $1.50 + $0.50 = $4.50 (or the sum of the areas 
of rectangles A, B, and C). Panel (b) shows that a lower price will increase consumer 
surplus. If the price of tea drops from $3.50 per cup to $3.00, Theresa, Tom, and Terri 
each receive $0.50 more in consumer surplus (shown by the shaded areas), so total con-
sumer surplus in the market rises to $6.00. Tim now buys a cup of tea but doesn’t re-
ceive any consumer surplus because the price is equal to the highest price he is willing 
to pay. In fact, Tim is indifferent between buying the cup or not—his well-being is the 
same either way.
The market demand curves shown in Figures 4.1 and 4.2 do not look like the 
smooth curves we saw in Chapter 3. This is because this example uses a small number 
of consumers, each consuming a single cup of tea. With many consumers, the market 
demand curve for chai tea will have the normal smooth shape shown in Figure 4.3. 
In this figure, the quantity demanded at a price of $2.00 is 15,000 cups per day. We 
can calculate total consumer surplus in Figure 4.3 the same way we did in Figures 4.1 
and 4.2: by adding up the consumer surplus received on each unit purchased. Once 
again, we can draw an important conclusion: The total amount of consumer surplus 
in a market is equal to the area below the demand curve and above the market price. 
Consumer surplus is shown as the blue area in Figure 4.3 and represents the benefit 
to consumers in excess of the price they paid to purchase the product—in this case, 
chai tea.

Total Consumer Surplus in the 
Market for Chai Tea
The demand curve tells us that most buyers 
of chai tea would have been willing to pay 
more than the market price of $2.00. For each 
buyer, consumer surplus is equal to the dif-
ference between the highest price he or she 
is willing to pay and the market price actually 
paid. Therefore, the total amount of consumer 
surplus in the market for chai tea is equal to 
the area below the demand curve and above 
the market price. Consumer surplus repre-
sents the benefit to consumers in excess of the 
price they paid to purchase the product.
The Consumer Surplus from 
Broadband Internet Service
Consumer surplus allows us to measure the benefit consumers 
receive in excess of the price they paid to purchase a product. 
Recently, Shane Greenstein and Ryan McDevitt, economists at Northwestern University, 
estimated the consumer surplus that households receive from subscribing to broadband 
Internet service. To do this, they estimated the demand curve for broadband Internet 
service and then computed the shaded area shown in the graph on the next page.
In 2006, 47 million consumers paid an average price of $36 per month to subscribe to 
a broadband Internet service. The demand curve shows the marginal benefit consumers

Consumer Surplus and Producer Surplus 
105
Producer Surplus
Just as demand curves show the willingness of consumers to buy a product at differ-
ent prices, supply curves show the willingness of firms to supply a product at different 
prices. The willingness to supply a product depends on the cost of producing it. Firms 
will supply an additional unit of a product only if they receive a price equal to the ad-
ditional cost of producing that unit. Marginal cost is the additional cost to a firm of 
producing one more unit of a good or service. Consider the marginal cost to the firm 
Heavenly Tea of producing one more cup: In this case, the marginal cost includes the 
ingredients to make the tea and the wages paid to the worker preparing the tea. Often, 
the marginal cost of producing a good increases as more of the good is produced dur-
ing a given period of time. This is the key reason—as we saw in Chapter 3—that supply 
curves are upward sloping.
Panel (a) of Figure 4.4 shows Heavenly Tea’s producer surplus. For simplicity, we 
show Heavenly producing only a small quantity of tea. The figure shows that Heavenly’s 
marginal cost of producing the first cup of tea is $1.25. Its marginal cost of producing 
the second cup is $1.50, and so on. The marginal cost of each cup of tea is the lowest 
price Heavenly is willing to accept to supply that cup. The supply curve, then, is also 
a marginal cost curve. Suppose the market price of tea is $2.00 per cup. On the first 
cup of tea, the price is $0.75 higher than the lowest price Heavenly is willing to accept. 
Producer surplus is the difference between the lowest price a firm would be willing 
to accept for a good or service and the price it actually receives. Therefore, Heavenly’s 
Marginal cost The additional cost to 
a firm of producing one more unit of 
a good or service.

$36 price line represents the difference between the price consumers would have paid 
rather than do without broadband service and the $36 they did pay. The shaded area 
on the graph represents the total consumer surplus in the market for broadband In-
ternet service. Greenstein and McDevitt estimate that the value of this area is $890.5 
million. This is one month’s benefit to the consumers who subscribe to a broadband 
Internet service.

producer surplus on the first cup is $0.75 (shown by the area of rectangle A). Its pro-
ducer surplus on the second cup is $0.50 (rectangle B). Its producer surplus on the third 
cup is $0.25 (rectangle C). Heavenly will not be willing to supply the fourth cup because 
the marginal cost of producing it is greater than the market price. Heavenly Tea’s total 
producer surplus is equal to $0.75 1 $0.50 1 $0.25 5 $1.50 (or the sum of rectangles 
A, B, and C). A higher price will increase producer surplus. For example, if the market 
price of chai tea rises from $2.00 to $2.25, Heavenly Tea’s producer surplus will increase 
from $1.50 to $2.25. (Make sure you understand how the new level of producer surplus 
was calculated.)
The supply curve shown in panel (a) of Figure 4.4 does not look like the smooth 
curves we saw in Chapter 3 because this example uses a single firm producing only a 
small quantity of tea. With many firms, the market supply curve for chai tea will have 
the normal smooth shape shown in panel (b) of Figure 4.4. In panel (b), the quantity 
supplied at a price of $2.00 is 15,000 cups per day. We can calculate total producer sur-
plus in panel (b) the same way we did in panel (a): by adding up the producer surplus 
received on each cup sold. Therefore, the total amount of producer surplus in a market 
is equal to the area above the market supply curve and below the market price. The total 
producer surplus tea sellers receive from selling chai tea is shown as the red area in 
panel (b) of Figure 4.4.
What Consumer Surplus and Producer  
Surplus Measure
We have seen that consumer surplus measures the benefit to consumers from 
 participating in a market, and producer surplus measures the benefit to producers from 
participating in a market. It is important, however, to be clear about what this means. 
In a sense, consumer surplus measures the net benefit to consumers from participating 
in a market rather than the total benefit. That is, if the price of a product were zero, the 
consumer surplus in a market would be all of the area under the demand curve. When 
the price is not zero, consumer surplus is the area below the demand curve and above

 Figure 4.4  Measuring Producer Surplus
Panel (a) shows Heavenly Tea’s producer surplus. Producer surplus is the differ-
ence between the lowest price a firm would be willing to accept and the price it 
actually receives. The lowest price Heavenly Tea is willing to accept to supply a cup 
of tea is equal to its marginal cost of producing that cup. When the market price of 
tea is $2.00, Heavenly receives producer surplus of $0.75 on the first cup (the area 
of rectangle A), $0.50 on the second cup (rectangle B), and $0.25 on the third cup 
(rectangle C). In panel (b), the total amount of producer surplus tea sellers receive 
from selling chai tea can be calculated by adding up for the entire market the pro-
ducer surplus received on each cup sold. In the figure, total producer surplus is 
equal to the area above the supply curve and below the market price, shown in red.

 
The Efficiency of Competitive Markets 
107
the market price. So, consumer surplus in a market is equal to the total benefit received 
by consumers minus the total amount they must pay to buy the good or service.
Similarly, producer surplus measures the net benefit received by producers from 
participating in a market. If producers could supply a good or service at zero cost, the 
producer surplus in a market would be all of the area below the market price. When cost 
is not zero, producer surplus is the area below the market price and above the supply 
curve. So, producer surplus in a market is equal to the total amount firms receive from 
consumers minus the cost of producing the good or service.
The Efficiency of Competitive Markets
In Chapter 3, we defined a competitive market as a market with many buyers and many 
sellers. An important advantage of the market system is that it results in efficient eco-
nomic outcomes. But what do we mean by economic efficiency? The concepts we have 
developed so far in this chapter give us two ways to think about the economic efficiency 
of competitive markets. We can think in terms of marginal benefit and marginal cost. 
We can also think in terms of consumer surplus and producer surplus. As we will see, 
these two approaches lead to the same outcome, but using both can increase our under-
standing of economic efficiency.
Marginal Benefit Equals Marginal Cost  
in Competitive Equilibrium
Figure 4.5 again shows the market for chai tea. Recall from our discussion that the de-
mand curve shows the marginal benefit received by consumers, and the supply curve 
shows the marginal cost of production. To achieve economic efficiency in this market, 
the marginal benefit from the last unit sold should equal the marginal cost of produc-
tion. The figure shows that this equality occurs at competitive equilibrium where 15,000 
cups per day are produced and marginal benefit and marginal cost are both equal to 
$2.00. Why is this outcome economically efficient? Because every cup of chai tea has 
been produced where the marginal benefit to buyers is greater than or equal to the mar-
ginal cost to producers.
Another way to see why the level of output at competitive equilibrium is efficient is 
to consider what the situation would be if output were at a different level. For instance, 
suppose that output of chai tea were 14,000 cups per day. Figure 4.5 shows that at this 
level of output, the marginal benefit from the last cup sold is $2.20, whereas the mar-
ginal cost is only $1.80. This level of output is not efficient because 1,000 more cups 
could be produced for which the additional benefit to consumers would be greater than 
the additional cost of production. Consumers would willingly purchase those cups, and

In a competitive market, equilibrium oc-
curs at a quantity of 15,000 cups and a price 
of $2.00 per cup, where marginal benefit 
equals marginal cost. This is the economi-
cally efficient level of output because every 
cup has been produced where the marginal 
benefit to buyers is greater than or equal to 
the marginal cost to producers.

tea sellers would willingly supply them, making both consumers and sellers better off.

be willing to supply this cup at a price of $2.20, which is $0.40 higher than consumers 
would be willing to pay. In fact, consumers would not be willing to pay the price tea sell-
ers would need to receive for any cup beyond the 15,000th.
To summarize, we can say this: Equilibrium in a competitive market results in the 
economically efficient level of output, where marginal benefit equals marginal cost.
Economic Surplus
Economic surplus in a market is the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus. 
In a competitive market, with many buyers and sellers and no government restrictions, 
economic surplus is at a maximum when the market is in equilibrium. To see this, let’s 
look one more time at the market for chai tea shown in Figure 4.6. The consumer sur-
plus in this market is the blue area below the demand curve and above the line indicat-
ing the equilibrium price of $2.00. The producer surplus is the red area above the supply 
curve and below the price line.
Deadweight Loss
To show that economic surplus is maximized at equilibrium, consider a situation in 
which the price of chai tea is above the equilibrium price, as shown in Figure 4.7. At a 
price of $2.20 per cup, the number of cups consumers are willing to buy per day drops 
from 15,000 to 14,000. At competitive equilibrium, consumer surplus is equal to the 
sum of areas A, B, and C. At a price of $2.20, fewer cups are sold at a higher price, so 
consumer surplus declines to just the area of A. At competitive equilibrium, producer 
surplus is equal to the sum of areas D and E. At the higher price of $2.20, producer 
surplus changes to be equal to the sum of areas B and D. The sum of consumer and pro-
ducer surplus—economic surplus—has been reduced to the sum of areas A, B, and D. 
Notice that this is less than the original economic surplus by an amount equal to areas C 
and E. Economic surplus has declined because at a price of $2.20, all the cups between 
the 14,000th and the 15,000th, which would have been produced in competitive equilib-
rium, are not being produced. These “missing” cups are not providing any consumer or 
producer surplus, so economic surplus has declined. The reduction in economic surplus 
resulting from a market not being in competitive equilibrium is called the deadweight 
loss. In the figure, it is equal to the sum of yellow triangles C and E.

product. Therefore, economic surplus—which is the sum of the benefit to firms plus the 
benefit to consumers—is the best measure we have of the benefit to society from the 
production of a particular good or service. This gives us a second way of characterizing 
the economic efficiency of a competitive market: Equilibrium in a competitive market 
results in the greatest amount of economic surplus, or total net benefit to society, from the 
production of a good or service. Anything that causes the market for a good or service 
not to be in competitive equilibrium reduces the total benefit to society from the pro-
duction of that good or service.
Now we can give a more general definition of economic efficiency in terms of our 
two approaches: Economic efficiency is a market outcome in which the marginal ben-
efit to consumers of the last unit produced is equal to its marginal cost of production 
and in which the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus is at a maximum.
Government Intervention in the Market: 
Price Floors and Price Ceilings
Notice that we have not concluded that every individual is better off if a market is at 
competitive equilibrium. We have only concluded that economic surplus, or the total 
net benefit to society, is greatest at competitive equilibrium. Any individual producer 
would rather receive a higher price, and any individual consumer would rather pay a 
lower price, but usually producers can sell and consumers can buy only at the competi-
tive equilibrium price.
Producers or consumers who are dissatisfied with the competitive equilibrium 
price can lobby the government to legally require that a different price be charged. In 
the United States, the government only occasionally overrides the market outcome by 
setting prices. When the government does intervene, it can either attempt to aid sellers 
by requiring that a price be above equilibrium—a price floor—or aid buyers by requir-
ing that a price be below equilibrium—a price ceiling. To affect the market outcome, 
the government must set a price floor that is above the equilibrium price or set a price 
ceiling that is below the equilibrium price. Otherwise, the price ceiling or price floor 
will not be binding on buyers and sellers. The preceding section demonstrates that mov-
ing away from competitive equilibrium will reduce economic efficiency. We can use 
Economic efficiency A market 
outcome in which the marginal 
benefit to consumers of the last unit 
produced is equal to its marginal cost 
of production and in which the sum 
of consumer surplus and producer 
surplus is at a maximum.

Economic surplus is maximized when a mar-

market is not in equilibrium, there is a dead-

instead of $2.00, consumer surplus declines 
from an amount equal to the sum of areas A, 
B, and C to just area A. Producer surplus in-
creases from the sum of areas D and E to the 
sum of areas B and D. At competitive equilib-

$2.20, there is a deadweight loss equal to the

Price Floors: Government Policy  
in Agricultural Markets
The Great Depression of the 1930s was the worst economic disaster in U.S. history, 
 affecting every sector of the U.S. economy. Many farmers were unable to sell their 
products or could sell them only at very low prices. Farmers were able to convince the 
federal government to set price floors for many agricultural products. Government 
 intervention in agriculture—often referred to as the farm program—has continued 
ever since. To see how a price floor in an agricultural market works, suppose that the 
equilibrium price in the wheat market is $3.00 per bushel, but the government decides 
to set a price floor of $3.50 per bushel. As Figure 4.8 shows, the price of wheat rises 
from $3.00 to $3.50, and the quantity of wheat sold falls from 2.0 billion bushels per 
year to 1.8 billion. Initially, suppose that production of wheat also falls to 1.8  billion 
bushels.
Just as we saw in the earlier example of the market for chai tea (shown in Figure 4.7 
on page 109), the producer surplus received by wheat farmers increases by an amount 
equal to the area of the red rectangle A and falls by an amount equal to the area of the 
yellow triangle C. The area of the red rectangle A represents a transfer from consumer 
surplus to producer surplus. The total fall in consumer surplus is equal to the area of 
the red rectangle A plus the area of the yellow triangle B. Wheat farmers benefit from 
this program, but consumers lose. There is also a deadweight loss equal to the areas 
of the yellow triangles B and C, which represents the decline in economic efficiency 
due to the price floor. There is a deadweight loss because the price floor has reduced 
the amount of economic surplus in the market for wheat. Or, looked at another way, 
the price floor has caused the marginal benefit of the last bushel of wheat to be greater 
than the marginal cost of producing it. We can conclude that a price floor reduces eco-
nomic efficiency.
We assumed initially that farmers reduce their production of wheat to the amount 
consumers are willing to buy. In fact, as Figure 4.8 shows, a price floor will cause the 
quantity of wheat that farmers want to supply to increase from 2.0 billion to 2.2 billion 
bushels. Because the higher price also reduces the amount of wheat consumers want to 
buy, the result is a surplus of 0.4 billion bushels of wheat (the 2.2 billion bushels supplied 
minus the 1.8 billion demanded).
Figure 4.8
The Economic Effect of a Price 
Floor in the Wheat Market
If wheat farmers convince the government 
to impose a price floor of $3.50 per bushel, 
the amount of wheat sold will fall from 2.0 
billion bushels per year to 1.8 billion. If we 
assume that farmers produce 1.8 billion 
bushels, producer surplus then increases by 
the red rectangle A—which is transferred 
from consumer surplus—and falls by the 
yellow triangle C. Consumer surplus de-
clines by the red rectangle A plus the yellow 
triangle B. There is a deadweight loss equal 
to the yellow triangles B and C, representing 
the decline in economic efficiency due to the 
price floor. In reality, a price floor of $3.50 
per bushel will cause farmers to expand 
their production from 2.0 billion to 2.2 bil-
lion bushels, resulting in a surplus of wheat.

Government Intervention in the Market: Price Floors and Price Ceilings 
111
The federal government’s farm programs have often resulted in large surpluses of 
wheat and other agricultural products. In response, the government has usually either 
bought the surplus food or paid farmers to restrict supply by taking some land out of 
cultivation. Because both of these options are expensive, Congress passed the Freedom 
to Farm Act of 1996. The intent of the act was to phase out price floors and govern-
ment purchases of surpluses and return to a free market in agriculture. To allow farmers 
time to adjust, the federal government began paying farmers subsidies, or cash payments 
based on the number of acres planted. Although the subsidies were originally scheduled 
to be phased out, Congress has passed additional Farm Acts that have resulted in the 
continuation of subsidies.
Price Floors in Labor Markets: The 
Debate over Minimum Wage Policy
The minimum wage may be the most controversial “price 
floor.” Supporters see the minimum wage as a way of raising 
the incomes of low-skilled workers. Opponents argue that it results in fewer jobs and 
imposes large costs on small businesses.
Since July 2009, the national minimum wage as set by Congress has been $7.25 
per hour for most occupations. It is illegal for an employer to pay less than this wage 
in those occupations. For most workers, the minimum wage is irrelevant because it is 
well below the wage employers are voluntarily willing to pay them. But for low-skilled 
 workers—such as workers in fast-food restaurants—the minimum wage is above the 
wage they would otherwise receive. The following figure shows the effect of the mini-
mum wage on employment in the market for low-skilled labor.
Without a minimum wage, the equilibrium wage would be W1 and the number of 
workers hired would be L1. With a minimum wage set above the equilibrium wage, the 
number of workers demanded by employers declines from L1 to L2, and the quantity of 
labor supplied increases to L3, leading to a surplus of workers unable to find jobs equal to 
L32L2. The quantity of labor supplied increases because the higher wage attracts more peo-
ple to work. For instance, some teenagers may decide that working after school is worth-
while at the minimum wage of $7.25 per hour but would not be worthwhile at a lower wage.

This analysis is very similar to our analysis of the wheat market in Figure 4.8. Just 
as a price floor in the wheat market leads to less wheat being consumed, a price floor in 
the labor market should lead to fewer workers being hired. Views differ sharply among 
economists, however, concerning how large a reduction in employment the mini-
mum wage causes. For instance, David Card of the University of California, Berkeley, 
and Alan Krueger of Princeton University, who in 2011 was appointed by President 
Barack Obama to chair the Council of Economic Advisers, conducted a study of fast-

Price Ceilings: Government Rent Control Policy 
in Housing Markets
Support for governments setting price floors typically comes from sellers, and support 
for governments setting price ceilings typically comes from consumers. For example, 
when there is a sharp increase in gasoline prices, there are often proposals for the gov-
ernment to impose a price ceiling on the market for gasoline. As we saw in the chapter 
opener, New York is one of a number of cities that impose rent control, which puts a 
ceiling on the maximum rent that landlords can charge for an apartment. Figure 4.9 
shows the market for apartments in a city that has rent control.
Without rent control, the equilibrium rent would be $1,500 per month, and 
2,000,000 apartments would be rented. With a maximum legal rent of $1,000 per 
month, landlords reduce the quantity of apartments supplied to 1,900,000. The fall 
in the quantity of apartments supplied can be the result of landlords converting some 
food restaurants in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Their study indicated that the effect 
of minimum wage increases on employment is very small. This study has been very 
controversial, however. Other economists have examined similar data and have come 
to the different conclusion that the minimum wage leads to a significant decrease in 
employment.
Whatever the extent of employment losses from the minimum wage, because it is a 
price floor, it will cause a deadweight loss, just as a price floor in the wheat market does. 
Therefore, many economists favor alternative policies for attaining the goal of raising 
the incomes of low-skilled workers. One policy many economists support is the earned 
income tax credit. The earned income tax credit reduces the amount of tax that low-
income wage earners would otherwise pay to the federal government. Workers with 
very low incomes who do not owe any tax receive a payment from the government. 
Compared with the minimum wage, the earned income tax credit can increase the in-
comes of low-skilled workers without reducing employment. The earned income tax 
credit also places a lesser burden on the small businesses that employ many low-skilled 
workers, and it may cause a smaller loss of economic efficiency.

Without rent control, the equilibrium rent is

apartments would be rented. If the govern-
ment imposes a rent ceiling of $1,000, the 
quantity of apartments supplied falls to 
1,900,000, and the quantity of apartments 
demanded increases to 2,100,000, resulting 
in a shortage of 200,000 apartments. Pro-
ducer surplus equal to the area of the blue 
rectangle A is transferred from landlords to 
renters, and there is a deadweight loss equal 
to the areas of yellow triangles B and C.

apartments into offices, selling some off as condominiums, or converting some small 
apartment buildings into single-family homes. Over time, landlords may even abandon 
some apartment buildings. At one time in New York City, rent control resulted in land-
lords abandoning whole city blocks because they were unable to cover their costs with 
the rents the government allowed them to charge. In London, when rent controls were 
applied to rooms and apartments located in a landlord’s own home, the quantity of these 
apartments supplied dropped by 75 percent.
In Figure 4.9, with the rent ceiling of $1,000, the quantity of apartments demanded 
rises to 2,100,000. There is a shortage of 200,000 apartments. Consumer surplus in-
creases by rectangle A and falls by triangle B. Rectangle A would have been part of 
producer surplus if rent control were not in place. With rent control, it is part of con-
sumer surplus. Rent control causes the producer surplus received by landlords to fall 
by rectangle A plus triangle C. Triangles B and C represent the deadweight loss. There 
is a deadweight loss because rent control has reduced the amount of economic surplus 
in the market for apartments. Rent control has caused the marginal benefit of the last 
apartment rented to be greater than the marginal cost of supplying it. We can conclude 
that a price ceiling, such as rent control, reduces economic efficiency. The appendix to 
this chapter shows how we can make quantitative estimates of the deadweight loss, and 
it provides an example of the changes in consumer surplus and producer surplus that 
can result from rent control.
Renters as a group benefit from rent controls—total consumer surplus is larger—but 
landlords lose. Because of the deadweight loss, the total loss to landlords is greater than 
the gain to renters. Notice also that although renters as a group benefit, the number of 
renters is reduced, so some renters are made worse off by rent controls because they are 
unable to find an apartment at the legal rent.
Black Markets
To this point, our analysis of rent controls is incomplete. In practice, renters may be 
worse off and landlords may be better off than Figure 4.9 makes it seem. We have as-
sumed that renters and landlords actually abide by the price ceiling, but sometimes they 
don’t. Because rent control leads to a shortage of apartments, renters who would oth-
erwise not be able to find apartments have an incentive to offer landlords rents above 
the legal maximum. When governments try to control prices by setting price ceilings 
or price floors, buyers and sellers often find a way around the controls. The result is 
a black market where buying and selling take place at prices that violate government 
price regulations.
In a housing market with rent controls, the total amount of consumer surplus received 
by renters may be reduced and the total amount of producer surplus received by landlords 
may be increased if apartments are being rented at prices above the legal price ceiling.
Black market A market in which 
buying and selling take place at 
prices that violate government price 
regulations.
Don’t Confuse “Scarcity” with “Shortage”
At first glance, the following statement seems correct: “There 
is a shortage of every good that is scarce.” In everyday con-
versation, we describe a good as “scarce” if we have trou-
ble finding it. For instance, if you are looking for a gift for 
a child, you might call the latest hot toy “scarce” if you are 
willing to buy it at its listed price but can’t find it online or 
in any store. But recall from Chapter 2 that economists have 
a broad definition of scarce. In the economic sense,  almost 
 everything— except undesirable things like garbage—is 
scarce. A shortage of a good occurs only if the quantity de-
manded is greater than the quantity supplied at the current 
price. Therefore, the preceding statement—“There is a short-
age of every good that is scarce”—is incorrect. In fact, there is 
no shortage of most scarce goods.

Solving the Problem
Step 1: Review the chapter material. This problem is about price controls in the mar-
ket for apartments, so you may want to review the section “Price Ceilings: Gov-
ernment Rent Control Policy in Housing Markets,” which begins on page 112.
Step 2: Draw a graph similar to Figure 4.9, with the addition of the black market price.
Solved Problem 4.3
What’s the Economic Effect of a  
Black Market for Apartments?
In many cities that have rent controls, the actual rents paid can 
be much higher than the legal maximum. Because rent controls 
cause a shortage of apartments, desperate tenants are often will-
ing to pay landlords rents that are higher than the law allows, 
perhaps by writing a check for the legally allowed rent and pay-
ing an additional amount in cash. Look again at Figure 4.9 on 
page 112. Suppose that competition among tenants results in 
the black market rent rising to $2,000 per month. At this rent, 
tenants demand 1,900,000 apartments. Use a graph showing 
the market for apartments to compare this situation with the 
one shown in Figure 4.9. Be sure to note any differences in con-
sumer surplus, producer surplus, and deadweight loss.
Step 3: Analyze the changes from Figure 4.9. The black market rent is now $2,000—
even higher than the original competitive equilibrium rent shown in Figure 4.9. 
So, consumer surplus declines by an amount equal to the red rectangle A plus 
the red rectangle E. The remaining consumer surplus is the blue triangle D. Note 
that the rectangle A, which would have been part of consumer surplus without 
rent control, represents a transfer from renters to landlords. Compared with the 
situation shown in Figure 4.9, producer surplus has increased by an amount 
equal to rectangles A and E, and consumer surplus has declined by the same 
amount. Deadweight loss is equal to triangles B and C, the same as in Figure 4.9.
Extra Credit: This analysis leads to a surprising result: With an active black market in apart-
ments, rent control may leave renters as a group worse off—with less consumer surplus—than 
if there were no rent control. There is one more possibility to consider, however. If enough 
landlords become convinced that they can get away with charging rents above the legal ceil-
ing, the quantity of apartments supplied will increase. Eventually, the market could even end 
up at the competitive equilibrium, with an equilibrium rent of $1,500 and equilibrium quan-
tity of 2,000,000 apartments. In that case, the rent control price ceiling becomes nonbinding, 
not because it was set below the equilibrium price but because it was not legally enforced.

The Economic Impact of Taxes 
115
Rent controls can also lead to an increase in racial and other types of discrimina-
tion. With rent controls, more renters are looking for apartments than there are apart-
ments to rent. Landlords can afford to indulge their prejudices by refusing to rent to 
people they don’t like. In cities without rent controls, landlords face more competition, 
which makes it more difficult to turn down tenants on the basis of irrelevant character-
istics, such as race.
The Results of Government Price Controls:  
Winners, Losers, and Inefficiency
When the government imposes price floors or price ceilings, three important results occur:
• 
Some people win.
• 
Some people lose.
• 
There is a loss of economic efficiency.
The winners with rent control are the people who are paying less for rent because 
they live in rent-controlled apartments. Landlords may also gain if they break the law 
by charging rents above the legal maximum for their rent-controlled apartments, pro-
vided that those illegal rents are higher than the competitive equilibrium rents would 
be. The losers from rent control are the landlords of rent-controlled apartments who 
abide by the law and renters who are unable to find apartments to rent at the controlled 
price. Rent control reduces economic efficiency because fewer apartments are rented 
than would be rented in a competitive market (refer again to Figure 4.9, on page 112). 
The resulting deadweight loss measures the decrease in economic efficiency.
Positive and Normative Analysis of Price Ceilings 
and Price Floors
Are rent controls, government farm programs, and other price ceilings and price floors 
bad? As we saw in Chapter 1, questions of this type have no right or wrong answers. 
Economists are generally skeptical of government attempts to interfere with competi-
tive market equilibrium. Economists know the role competitive markets have played in 
 raising the average person’s standard of living. They also know that too much government 
 intervention has the potential to reduce the ability of the market system to produce simi-
lar increases in living standards in the future.
But recall from Chapter 1 the difference between positive and normative analysis. 
Positive analysis is concerned with what is, and normative analysis is concerned with what 
should be. Our analysis of rent control and of the federal farm programs in this chapter 
is positive analysis. We discussed the economic results of these programs. Whether these 
programs are desirable or undesirable is a normative question. Whether the gains to the 
winners more than make up for the losses to the losers and for the decline in economic 
efficiency is a matter of judgment and not strictly an economic question. Price ceilings 
and price floors continue to exist partly because people who understand their downside 
still believe they are good policies and therefore support them. The policies also persist 
because many people who support them do not understand the economic analysis in this 
chapter and so do not understand the drawbacks to these policies.
The Economic Impact of Taxes
Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes once remarked, “Taxes are what we pay 
for a civilized society.” When the government taxes a good or service, however, it af-
fects the market equilibrium for that good or service. Just as with a price ceiling or price 
floor, one result of a tax is a decline in economic efficiency. Analyzing taxes is an im-
portant part of the field of economics known as public finance. In this section, we will 
use the model of demand and supply and the concepts of consumer surplus, producer 
surplus, and deadweight loss to analyze the economic impact of taxes.

C H A P T E R  4   Economic Efficiency, Government Price Setting, and Taxes
The Effect of Taxes on Economic Efficiency
Whenever a government taxes a good or service, less of that good or service will be pro-
duced and consumed. For example, a tax on cigarettes will raise the cost of smoking and 
reduce the amount of smoking that takes place. We can use a demand and supply graph 
to illustrate this point. Figure 4.10 shows the market for cigarettes.
Without the tax, the equilibrium price of cigarettes would be $4.00 per pack, and 
4 billion packs of cigarettes would be sold per year (point A). If the federal govern-
ment requires sellers of cigarettes to pay a $1.00-per-pack tax, then their cost of selling 
cigarettes will increase by $1.00 per pack. This increase in costs causes the supply curve 
for cigarettes to shift up by $1.00 because sellers will now require a price that is $1.00 
greater to supply the same quantity of cigarettes. In Figure 4.10, the supply curve shifts 
up by $1.00 to show the effect of the tax, and there is a new equilibrium price of $4.90 
and a new equilibrium quantity of 3.7 billion packs (point B).
The federal government will collect tax revenue equal to the tax per pack multiplied 
by the number of packs sold, or $3.7 billion. The area shaded in green in Figure 4.10 
represents the government’s tax revenue. Consumers will pay a higher price of $4.90 per 
pack. Although sellers appear to be receiving a higher price per pack, once they have 
paid the tax, the price they receive falls from $4.00 per pack to $3.90 per pack. There 
is a loss of consumer surplus because consumers are paying a higher price. The price 
producers receive falls, so there is also a loss of producer surplus. Therefore, the tax on 
cigarettes has reduced both consumer surplus and producer surplus. Some of the reduc-
tion in consumer and producer surplus becomes tax revenue for the government. The 
rest of the reduction in consumer and producer surplus is equal to the deadweight loss 
from the tax, shown by the yellow-shaded triangle in the figure.
We can conclude that the true burden of a tax is not just the amount consumers 
and producers pay the government but also includes the deadweight loss. The dead-
weight loss from a tax is referred to as the excess burden of the tax. A tax is efficient if 
it imposes a small excess burden relative to the tax revenue it raises. One contribution 
economists make to government tax policy is to advise policymakers on which taxes are 
most efficient.
Tax Incidence: Who Actually Pays a Tax?
The answer to the question “Who pays a tax?” seems obvious: Whoever is legally re-
quired to send a tax payment to the government pays the tax. But there can be an im-
portant difference between who is legally required to pay the tax and who actually bears 
Figure 4.10
The Effect of a Tax on the 
Market for Cigarettes
Without the tax, market equilibrium occurs 
at point A. The equilibrium price of ciga-
rettes is $4.00 per pack, and 4 billion packs 
of cigarettes are sold per year. A $1.00-per-
pack tax on cigarettes will cause the supply 
curve for cigarettes to shift up by $1.00, 
from S1 to S2. The new equilibrium occurs 
at point B. The price of cigarettes will in-
crease by $0.90, to $4.90 per pack, and the 
quantity sold will fall to 3.7 billion packs. 
The tax on cigarettes has increased the price 
paid by consumers from $4.00 to $4.90 per 
pack. Producers receive a price of $4.90 per 
pack (point B), but after paying the $1.00 
tax, they are left with $3.90 (point C). The 
government will receive tax revenue equal 
to the green-shaded box. Some consumer 
surplus and some producer surplus will be-
come tax revenue for the government, and 
some will become deadweight loss, shown 
by the yellow-shaded area.

the burden of the tax. The actual division of the burden of a tax between buyers and sell-
ers is referred to as tax incidence. The federal government currently levies an excise tax 
of 18.4 cents per gallon of gasoline sold. Gas station owners collect this tax and forward 
it to the federal government, but who actually bears the burden of the tax?
Determining Tax Incidence on a Demand and Supply Graph Suppose that 
currently the federal government does not impose a tax on gasoline. In Figure 4.11, 
equilibrium in the retail market for gasoline occurs at the intersection of the demand 
curve and supply curve, S1. The equilibrium price is $3.00 per gallon, and the equilib-
rium quantity is 144 billion gallons. Now suppose that the federal government imposes 
a 10-cents-per-gallon tax. As a result of the tax, the supply curve for gasoline will shift 
up by 10 cents per gallon. At the new equilibrium, where the demand curve intersects 
the supply curve, S2, the price has risen by 8 cents per gallon, from $3.00 to $3.08. No-
tice that only in the extremely unlikely case that demand is a vertical line will the market 
price rise by the full amount of the tax. Consumers are paying 8 cents more per gallon. 
Sellers of gasoline receive a new higher price of $3.08 per gallon, but after paying the 
10-cents-per-gallon tax, they are left with $2.98 per gallon, or 2 cents less than they were 
receiving in the old equilibrium.
Although the sellers of gasoline are responsible for collecting the tax and sending 
the tax receipts to the government, they do not bear most of the burden of the tax. In 
this case, consumers pay 8 cents of the tax because the market price has risen by 8 cents, 
and sellers pay 2 cents of the tax because after sending the tax to the government, they 
are receiving 2 cents less per gallon of gasoline sold. Expressed in percentage terms, 
consumers pay 80 percent of the tax, and sellers pay 20 percent of the tax.

the burden of a tax between buyers 
and sellers in a market.

The Incidence of a Tax on 
Gasoline
With no tax on gasoline, the price would be 
$3.00 per gallon, and 144 billion gallons of 
gasoline would be sold each year. A 10-cents-
per-gallon excise tax shifts up the supply 
curve from S1 to S2, raises the price consumers 
pay from $3.00 to $3.08, and lowers the price 
sellers receive from $3.00 to $2.98. Therefore, 
consumers pay 8 cents of the 10-cents-per-
gallon tax on gasoline, and sellers pay 2 cents.

Solved Problem 4.4
When Do Consumers Pay All  
of a Sales Tax Increase?
A student makes the following statement: “If the federal 
government raises the sales tax on gasoline by $0.25, then 
the price of gasoline will rise by $0.25. Consumers can’t get 
by without gasoline, so they have to pay the whole amount 
of any increase in the sales tax.” Under what circumstances 
will the student’s statement be true? Illustrate your answer 
with a graph of the market for gasoline.

C H A P T E R  4   Economic Efficiency, Government Price Setting, and Taxes
Does It Make a Difference Whether the Government Collects a Tax from 
Buyers or Sellers? We have already seen the important distinction between the true 
burden of a tax and whether buyers or sellers are legally required to pay a tax. We can 
reinforce this point by noting explicitly that the incidence of a tax does not depend on 
whether the government collects a tax from the buyers of a good or from the sellers. 
Figure 4.12 illustrates this point by showing the effect on equilibrium in the market for 
gasoline if a 10-cents-per-gallon tax is imposed on buyers rather than on sellers. That is, 
we are now assuming that instead of sellers having to collect the 10-cents-per-gallon tax 
at the pump, buyers are responsible for keeping track of how many gallons of gasoline 
they purchase and sending the tax to the government. (Of course, it would be very dif-
ficult for buyers to keep track of their purchases or for the government to check whether 
they were paying all of the taxes they owe. That is why the government collects the tax 
on gasoline from sellers.)
Figure 4.12 is similar to Figure 4.11 except that it shows the gasoline tax being 
imposed on buyers rather than sellers. In Figure 4.12, the supply curve does not shift 
because nothing has happened to change the quantity of gasoline sellers are willing to 
supply at any given price. The demand curve has shifted, however, because consumers 
now have to pay a 10-cent tax on every gallon of gasoline they buy. Therefore, at every 
Solving the Problem
Step 1: Review the chapter material. This problem is about tax incidence, so you 
may want to review the section “Tax Incidence: Who Actually Pays a Tax?” 
that begins on page 116.
Step 2: Draw a graph like Figure 4.11 to illustrate the circumstances when con-
sumers will pay all of an increase in a sales tax.
Step 3: Use the graph to evaluate the statement. The graph shows that consumers 
will pay all of an increase in a sales tax only if the demand curve is a vertical 
line. It is very unlikely that the demand for gasoline would look like this be-
cause we expect that for every good, an increase in price will cause a decrease 
in the quantity demanded. Because the demand curve for gasoline is not a 
vertical line, the statement is incorrect.

quantity, they are willing to pay a price 10 cents less than they would have without the 
tax. In the figure, we indicate the effect of the tax by shifting the demand curve down 
by 10 cents, from D1 to D2. Once the tax has been imposed and the demand curve has 
shifted down, the new equilibrium quantity of gasoline is 140 billion gallons, which is 
exactly the same as in Figure 4.11.
The new equilibrium price after the tax is imposed appears to be different in Fig-
ure 4.12 than in Figure 4.11, but if we include the tax, buyers will pay the same price and 
sellers will receive the same price in both figures. To see this, notice that in Figure 4.11, 
buyers pay sellers a price of $3.08 per gallon. In Figure 4.12, they pay sellers only $2.98, 
but they must also pay the government a tax of 10 cents per gallon. So, the total price 
buyers pay remains $3.08 per gallon. In Figure 4.11, sellers receive $3.08 per gallon from 
buyers, but after they pay the tax of 10 cents per gallon, they are left with $2.98, which is 
the same amount they receive in Figure 4.12.

The Incidence of a Tax on 
Gasoline Paid by Buyers
With no tax on gasoline, the demand curve 
is D1. If a 10-cents-per-gallon tax is im-
posed that consumers are responsible for 
paying, the demand curve shifts down by 
the amount of the tax, from D1 to D2. In the 
new equilibrium, consumers pay a price of 
$3.08 per gallon, including the tax. Produc-
ers receive $2.98 per gallon. This is the same 
result we saw when producers were respon-
sible for paying the tax.

Is the Burden of the Social Security 
Tax Really Shared Equally between 
Workers and Firms?
Most people who receive paychecks have several different 
taxes withheld from them by their employers, who forward these taxes directly to the 
government. In fact, many people are shocked after getting their first job when they 
discover the gap between their gross pay and their net pay after taxes have been de-
ducted. The largest tax many people of low or moderate income pay is FICA, which 
stands for the Federal Insurance Contributions Act. FICA funds the Social Security 
and Medicare programs, which provide income and health care to the elderly and dis-
abled. FICA is sometimes referred to as the payroll tax. When Congress passed the act, 
it wanted employers and workers to equally share the burden of the tax. Currently, FICA 
is 15.3 percent of wages, with 7.65 percent paid by workers by being withheld from their 
paychecks and the other 7.65 percent paid by employers.
But does requiring workers and employers to each pay half the tax mean that the 
burden of the tax is also shared equally? Our discussion in this chapter shows that the 
answer is no. In the labor market, employers are buyers, and workers are sellers. As we 
saw in the example of the federal tax on gasoline, whether the tax is collected from buy-
ers or from sellers does not affect the incidence of the tax. Most economists believe,

in fact, that the burden of FICA falls almost entirely on workers. The following figure,

In the market for labor, the demand curve represents the quantity of labor de-
manded by employers at various wages, and the supply curve represents the quantity 
of labor supplied by workers at various wages. The intersection of the demand curve 
and the supply curve determines the equilibrium wage. In both panels, the equilibrium 
wage without a Social Security payroll tax is $10 per hour. For simplicity, let’s assume 
that the payroll tax equals $1 per hour of work. In panel (a), we assume that employers 
must pay the tax. The tax causes the demand for labor curve to shift down by $1 at every 
quantity of labor because firms now must pay a $1 tax for every hour of labor they hire. 
We have drawn the supply curve for labor as being very steep because most economists 
believe the quantity of labor supplied by workers does not change much as the wage rate 
changes. Workers pay $0.95 of the tax because their wages fall from $10 before the tax to 
$9.05 after the tax. Firms pay only $0.05 of the tax because the amount they pay for an 
hour of labor increases from $10 before the tax to $10.05 after the tax. In panel (a), after 
the tax is imposed, the equilibrium wage declines from $10 per hour to $9.05 per hour. 
Firms are now paying a total of $10.05 for every hour of work they hire: $9.05 in wages 
to workers and $1 in tax to the government. In other words, workers have paid $0.95 of 
the $1 tax, and firms have paid only $0.05.
Panel (b) shows that this result is exactly the same if the tax is imposed on workers 
rather than on firms. In this case, the tax causes the supply curve for labor to shift up by 
$1 at every quantity of labor because workers must now pay a tax of $1 for every hour 
they work. After the tax is imposed, the equilibrium wage increases to $10.05 per hour. 
But workers receive only $9.05 after they have paid the $1.00 tax. Once again, workers 
have paid $0.95 of the $1 tax, and firms have paid only $0.05.
Although the figure presents a simplified analysis, it reflects the conclusion of most 
economists who have studied the incidence of FICA: Even though Congress requires 
employers to pay half the tax and workers to pay the other half, in fact, the burden of 
the tax falls almost entirely on workers. This conclusion would not be changed even if 
Congress revised the law to require either employers or workers to pay all of the tax. The 
forces of demand and supply working in the labor market, and not Congress, determine 
the incidence of the tax.

Conclusion
The model of demand and supply introduced in Chapter 3 showed that markets free 
from government intervention eliminate surpluses and shortages and do a good job of 
responding to the wants of consumers. We have seen in this chapter that both consum-
ers and firms sometimes try to use the government to change market outcomes in their 
favor. The concepts of consumer and producer surplus and deadweight loss allow us to 
measure the benefits consumers and producers receive from competitive market equi-
librium. These concepts also allow us to measure the effects of government price floors 
and price ceilings and the economic impact of taxes.

Economics in Your Life
Does Rent Control Make It Easier for You to Find an Affordable Apartment?
At the beginning of the chapter, we posed the following question: If you have two job offers in 
 different cities, one with rent control and one without, will you be more likely to find an afford-
able apartment in the city with rent control? In answering the question, this chapter has shown 
that although rent control can keep rents lower than they might otherwise be, it can also lead to a 
permanent shortage of apartments. You may have to search for a long time to find a suitable apart-
ment, and landlords may even ask you to give them payments “under the table,” which would make 
your actual rent higher than the controlled rent. Finding an apartment in a city without rent control 
should be much easier, although the rent may be higher.

For Faye Dunaway, 
Real-Life Role in 
Housing Court
She was a brazen bank robber in “Bon-
nie and Clyde,” the mysterious Evelyn 
Mulwray in “Chinatown“ and a schem-
ing television executive in “Network,” 
for which she won an Oscar.
Now Faye Dunaway is a  defendant 
in case No. 76667/11 in  Manhattan 
housing court, just another rent- 
stabilized tenant facing eviction.
 In a lawsuit filed Tuesday, her 
landlord claims that Ms. Dunaway, 
who pays $1,048.72 a month for a 
one-bedroom walk-up apartment in 
a century-old tenement building on 
East 78th Street, does not actually live 
there, but rather lives in California. 
The suit also names her son, Liam 
Dunaway O’Neill, whose father is the 
photographer Terry O’Neill, as a sub-
tenant in the apartment.
As proof, the landlord, un-
named in court papers, states that 
Ms. Dunaway owns a home in West 
Hollywood, and has her voter and au-
tomobile registrations there. The suit 
also cites three moving violations she 
received in California from May 2009 
to December 2010.
Rent stabilization rules require 
tenants to live in the apartment they are 
renting as a primary residence, not as a 
second home. Ms. Dunaway, 70, does 
not appear to be living glamorously. 
The home in California is a nice but 
not flashy house on which she still car-
ries a mortgage,  according to the law-
suit. Her car is a 2007  Toyota Corolla.
Ms. Dunaway is one of the many 
celebrities who have fought to keep 
rent-regulated apartments in New 
York over the years. But Ms. Dunaway’s 
current apartment is also a vast depar-
ture from the 20th-floor apartment 
she inhabited at the Eldorado earlier 
in her career. . . .
 If Ms. Dunaway leaves, the land-
lord is likely to get far more rent. Ac-
cording to rental data tracked by the 
brokerage Citi Habitats, one-bedroom 
walk-up apartments on the Upper 
East Side currently rent for an average 
of $2,318 a month.
Ms. Dunaway rented her cur-
rent apartment on the Upper East Side 
on Aug. 1, 1994, in a six-story yellow 
brick building with fire escapes in the 
front. The name next to the outdoor 
buzzer reads “F. Dunaway.” The build-
ing’s hallway floors are green linoleum. 
Its cream walls are chipped, and pink 
marble steps lead up to her third-floor 
unit. Her front door is painted aqua-
marine and has the names “Dunaway/
ONeill” and “PT Bascom” listed by the 
black doorbell. There is a simple brown 
doormat with black trim. No one an-
swered the door on Tuesday afternoon.
 Ms. Dunaway had problems in the 
past with her landlord, who filed a no-
tice in 2009 in Civil Court in Manhattan 
for nonpayment of rent. That case ap-
peared to have been resolved, and she 
signed a lease in April 2009 to remain 
in her apartment until July 31, 2011.
Court papers show that the land-
lord investigated earlier this year to 
determine where she actually lived 
and contacted Ms. Dunaway in March 
with its findings. The landlord asked

her to leave when her lease expired on 
July 31.
Neighbors said that while they 
had seen Ms. Dunaway in the past, 
they had not seen her much lately. 
Keith  Cohen, owner of Orwasher’s 
Bakery near Ms. Dunaway’s apart-
ment, said that employees had told 
him when he arrived in 2007 that  
Ms. Dunaway lived nearby, but that he 
had never seen her.
Rosane Franco, manager of the 
nearby Tiny Doll House shop, said she 
had seen Ms. Dunaway a few times 
in the past two years, but that the last 
time was “many months ago.”
The occupant of an apartment next 
door, who would not give her name, said 
through her door, “I’ve never met her.”
Ms. Dunaway’s Twitter feed shows 
no mention of her being in New York 
recently. Her son, Mr. O’Neill, has writ-
ten on his Twitter feed, “I live in LA.”
Ms. Dunaway is scheduled for a 
hearing in Civil Court on Aug. 11 at 
2 p.m.
If she departs, it may not have 
much effect on her sleepy block be-
tween First and Second Avenues.
“She’s not that glamorous person 
everybody saw in the movies,” Ms. 
Franco said. “We were surprised that 
she lived here in the first place.”

Key Points in the Article
In July 2011, Oscar-winning actress Faye 
 Dunaway found herself embroiled in a legal 
battle as the defendant in a lawsuit filed by 
the landlord of her rent-controlled New York 
City apartment. According to the lawsuit, 
Dunaway faced eviction from her apart-
ment based on the landlord’s claim that she 
had violated the New York rent stabilization 
rule that requires the apartment be the pri-
mary residence of the tenant. Dunaway first 
moved into the apartment in 1994, and as 
recently as 2009 renewed her lease through 
July 2011. Following an investigation, the 
landlord concluded that Dunaway’s pri-
mary residence is actually in Los Angeles, 
and based on these findings, asked her to 
leave the apartment when the lease ex-
pired on July 31. Dunaway’s refusal to leave 
prompted the landlord to file the lawsuit in 
Manhattan housing court following the ex-
piration of her lease.
Analyzing the News
a  According to her landlord, Dunaway’s 
 monthly rent on the rent-controlled 
apartment is $1,048.72. Rent-controlled 
apartments generally rent for an amount 
 below what the equilibrium price would  
be were the market not subject to this 
 government-set price. Rent control not only 
reduces the potential revenue that could be 
received by landlords if the market were not 
regulated, but also results in a shortage of 
apartments.
b  In the case of Dunaway’s apartment, 
 the controlled rent is apparently signifi-
cantly below the amount that could be 
charged in an unregulated market. Rental 
data show that in the same neighborhood, 
apartments of a similar size and layout rent 
for an average of $2,318 per month, more 
than double the rent Dunaway is paying. 
The figure below shows an example of 
rent control in the New York City apart-
ment market, using the average rent of 
$2,318 as the equilibrium price. At the rent-
controlled price of $1,048.72, a shortage of 
apartments will exist, represented by the 
distance from Q1 to Q2. The shortage indi-
cates that more people will want to rent 
apartments at the rent controlled price than 
there will be apartments available for rent. 
It is understandable why Dunaway’s land-
lord would like to take advantage of the pri-
mary residency restriction in the New York 
rent stabilization rules and have her evicted 
from the apartment. As described in the 
chapter opener, current rent control laws in 
New York are quite complex, but landlords 
can raise the rent on vacant apartments, 
and apartments renting for $2,000 a month 
are automatically deregulated if they are 
vacant. Based on these laws, the monthly 
revenue the landlord could receive by rent-
ing this  apartment to a new tenant would 
definitely increase.
c  Dunaway’s landlord filed a legal notice 
against her for nonpayment of rent in 
2009, so this is not the first time the two 
parties have engaged in legal wrangling. 
That issue was apparently resolved, but 
this time the landlord definitely seems to 
want Dunaway out and is using the resi-
dency restriction as the means. Neighbor-
hood residents have stated that they have 
not seen Dunaway much lately, supporting 
the landlord’s claim that the New York 
apartment is not the actor’s primary resi-
dence. No matter what methods landlords 
use in an attempt to reclaim rent-controlled 
apartments, if their efforts are successful, 
they will be able to increase their revenues 
so long as demand remains strong for 
these properties.
Thinking Critically 
About Policy
1. One consequence of rent control is a 
shortage of apartments, which is shown 
in the figure. Suppose rent control also 
leads to a reduction in the supply of af-
fordable apartments. Use the figure on 
this page to illustrate the effects of a re-
duction in supply, and explain what will 
happen to the shortage of apartments.
2. One reason some economists are criti-
cal of rent control laws is that they cre-
ate a deadweight loss. Using the figure 
on this page, identify the area represent-
ing the deadweight loss. What causes 
the deadweight loss? What would the 
supply curve have to look like for the 
deadweight loss to equal zero?

Summary
Although most prices are determined by demand and supply in 
markets, the government sometimes imposes price ceilings and 
price floors. A price ceiling is a legally determined maximum 
price that sellers may charge. A price floor is a legally determined 
minimum price that sellers may receive. Economists analyze the 
effects of price ceilings and price floors using consumer surplus 
and producer surplus. Marginal benefit is the additional benefit to 
a consumer from consuming one more unit of a good or service. 
The demand curve is also a marginal benefit curve. Consumer 
surplus is the difference between the highest price a consumer is 
willing to pay for a good or service and the price the consumer 
actually pays. The total amount of consumer surplus in a market 
is equal to the area below the demand curve and above the market 
price. Marginal cost is the additional cost to a firm of producing 
one more unit of a good or service. The supply curve is also a mar-
ginal cost curve. Producer surplus is the difference between the 
lowest price a firm is willing to accept for a good or service and 
the price it actually receives. The total amount of producer surplus 
in a market is equal to the area above the supply curve and below 
the market price.

Problems and Applications
 
1.5 Suppose that a frost in Florida reduces the size of the or-
ange crop, which causes the supply curve for oranges to 
shift to the left. Briefly explain whether consumer surplus 
will increase or decrease and whether producer surplus 
will increase or decrease. Use a demand and supply graph 
to illustrate your answers.
 
1.6 A student makes the following argument: “When a market 
is in equilibrium, there is no consumer surplus. We know 
this because in equilibrium, the market price is equal to the 
price consumers are willing to pay for the good.” Briefly 
explain whether you agree with the student’s argument.
 
1.7 How does consumer surplus differ from the total benefit 
consumers receive from purchasing products? Similarly, 
how does producer surplus differ from the total revenue 
that firms receive from selling products? Under what spe-
cial case will consumer surplus equal the total benefit con-
sumers receive from consuming a product? Under what 
special case will producer surplus equal the total revenue 
firms receive from selling a product?

 1.11 A study estimates that the total consumer surplus gained 
by people participating in auctions on eBay in a recent year 
was $7 billion. Is it likely that the total consumer surplus 
for the items bought in these auctions was higher or lower 
than it would have been if consumers had purchased these 
items for fixed prices in retail stores?

 1.12 Movies, songs, and books are covered by copyrights, which 
allow the creators of these works to keep other people 
from reproducing them without permission. Many peo-
ple, though, violate copyright laws by using file-sharing 
services that allow them to download copies of songs and 
movies at a zero price.
 
a. Does file sharing increase the consumer surplus from 
consuming existing songs and movies? Draw a demand 
curve to illustrate your answer. The demand curve 
should indicate the price when file sharing is not pos-
sible, the zero price with file sharing, and the amount of 
consumer surplus with and without file sharing.
 
b. What are the likely effects of file sharing in the long 
run? Is file sharing likely to increase the total consumer 
surplus from consuming songs and movies in the long

Summary
Equilibrium in a competitive market is economically efficient. 
Economic surplus is the sum of consumer surplus and producer 
surplus. Economic efficiency is a market outcome in which the 
marginal benefit to consumers from the last unit produced is 
equal to the marginal cost of production and where the sum of 
consumer surplus and producer surplus is at a maximum. When 
the market price is above or below the equilibrium price, there is 
a reduction in economic surplus. The reduction in economic sur-
plus resulting from a market not being in competitive equilibrium 
is called the deadweight loss.

C H A P T E R  4   Economic Efficiency, Government Price Setting, and Taxes
Summary
Producers or consumers who are dissatisfied with the market out-
come can attempt to convince the government to impose price 
floors or price ceilings. Price floors usually increase producer 
surplus, decrease consumer surplus, and cause a deadweight loss. 
Price ceilings usually increase consumer surplus, reduce producer 
surplus, and cause a deadweight loss. The results of the govern-
ment imposing price ceilings and price floors are that some people 
win, some people lose, and a loss of economic efficiency occurs. 
Price ceilings and price floors can lead to a black market, where 
buying and selling take place at prices that violate government 
price regulations. Positive analysis is concerned with what is, 
and normative analysis is concerned with what should be. Posi-
tive analysis shows that price ceilings and price floors cause dead-
weight losses. Whether these policies are desirable or undesirable, 
though, is a normative question.

3.9 During 2007, the Venezuelan government allowed con-
sumers to buy only a limited quantity of sugar. The gov-
ernment also imposed a ceiling on the price of sugar. As a 
result, both the quantity of sugar consumed and the mar-
ket price of sugar were below the competitive equilibrium 
price and quantity. Draw a graph to illustrate this situation. 
On your graph, be sure to indicate the areas representing 
consumer surplus, producer surplus, and deadweight loss.
 3.10 Refer to problem 3.9. An article in the New York Times 
contained the following (Hugo Chávez is the president of 
Venezuela):
José Vielma Mora, the chief of Seniat, the 
government’s tax agency, oversaw a raid this 
month on a warehouse here where officials 
seized about 165 tons of sugar. Mr. Vielma 
said the raid exposed hoarding by vendors 
who were unwilling to sell the sugar at official 
prices. He and other officials in Mr. Chávez’s 
government have repeatedly blamed the short-
ages on producers, intermediaries and grocers.
 
 Do you agree that the shortages in the Venezuelan sugar 
market are the fault of “producers, intermediaries and gro-
cers”? Briefly explain.

tors,” New York Times, February 17, 2007.
 3.11 To drive a taxi legally in New York City, you must have a 
medallion issued by the city government. City officials have 
issued only 13,200 medallions. Let’s assume that this puts an 
absolute limit on the number of taxi rides that can be sup-
plied in New York City on any day because no one breaks 
the law by driving a taxi without a medallion. Let’s also as-
sume that each taxi can provide 6 trips per day. In that case, 
the supply of taxi rides is fixed at 79,200 (or 6 rides per taxi 
3 13,200 taxis). We show this in the following graph, with a 
vertical line at this quantity. Assume that there are no govern-
ment controls on the prices that drivers can charge for rides. 
Use the graph below to answer the following questions.
 
c. Indicate on the graph the areas representing con-
sumer surplus and producer surplus if there were no 
 medallion requirement. 
 
d. Indicate on the graph the areas representing consumer 
surplus, producer surplus, and deadweight loss with 
the medallion requirement. 
 
e. In 2011, the state of New York allowed New York City 
to sell 1,500 new taxi medallions. Assuming that each 
of the new taxis can also provide 6 rides per day, what 
is the new quantity of taxi rides per day? On the graph, 
show the effects of the new medallions on consumer 
surplus, producer surplus, and deadweight loss.

Krugman recounted the story’s “tales of would-be renters, 
pounding the pavements, of dozens of desperate applicants 
arriving at a newly offered apartment, trying to impress the 
landlord with their credentials. And yet there was something 
. . . missing . . . two words I knew had to be part of the story.” 
What two words do you think were missing from the story?

Briefly explain whether you agree or disagree with the fol-

 3.16 A student makes the following argument:
A price floor reduces the amount of a product 
that consumers buy because it keeps the price 
above the competitive market equilibrium. A 
price ceiling, on the other hand, increases the 
amount of a product that consumers buy be-
cause it keeps the price below the competitive 
market equilibrium.
 
 Do you agree with the student’s reasoning? Use a demand 
and supply graph to illustrate your answer.
 3.17 University towns with major football programs experience 
an increase in demand for hotel rooms during home foot-
ball weekends. Hotel management responds to the increase 
in demand by increasing the price they charge for a room. 
Periodically, there is an outcry against the higher prices 
and accusations of “price gouging.”
 
a. Draw a demand and supply graph of the market for 
hotel rooms in Boostertown for weekends with home 
football games and another graph for weekends with-
out home football games. If the Boostertown city 
council passes a law stating that prices for rooms are 
not allowed to rise, what would happen to the market 
for hotel rooms during home football game weekends? 
Show your answer on your graph.
 
b. If the prices of hotel rooms are not allowed to increase, 
what will be the effect on out-of-town football fans?
 
c. How might the city council’s law affect the supply of 
hotel rooms over time? Briefly explain.
 
d. University towns are not the only places that face peak 
and non-peak “seasons.” Can you think of other lo-
cations that face a large increase in demand for hotel 
rooms during particular times of the year? Why do 
we typically not see laws limiting the prices hotels can 
charge during peak seasons?
 3.18 An advocate of medical care system reform makes the fol-
lowing argument:
The 15,000 kidneys that are transplanted in the United 
States each year are received for free from organ do-
nors. Despite this, because of hospital and doctor fees, 
the average price of a kidney transplant is $250,000. As a 
result, only rich people or people with very good health 
insurance can afford these transplants. The government 
should put a ceiling of $100,000 on the price of kidney 
transplants. That way, middle-income people will be able 
to afford them, the demand for kidney transplants will 
increase, and more kidney transplants will take place.
 
 Do you agree with the advocate’s reasoning? Use a demand 
and supply graph to illustrate your answer.
 3.19 [Related to the Chapter Opener on page 101] The cities 
of Peabody and Woburn are 5 miles apart. Woburn enacts 
a rent control law that puts a ceiling on rents well below 
their competitive market value. Predict the effect of this 
law on the competitive equilibrium rent in Peabody, which 
does not have a rent control law. Illustrate your answer 
with a demand and supply graph.
 3.20 [Related to the Chapter Opener on page 101] The com-
petitive equilibrium rent in the city of Lowell is currently 
$1,000 per month. The government decides to enact rent 
control and to establish a price ceiling for apartments of $750 
per month. Briefly explain whether rent control is likely to 
make each of the following people better or worse off:
 
a. Someone currently renting an apartment in Lowell
 
b. Someone who will be moving to Lowell next year and 
who intends to rent an apartment
 
c. A landlord who intends to abide by the rent control law
 
d. A landlord who intends to ignore the law and illegally 
charge the highest rent possible for his apartments
 3.21 [Related to the Chapter Opener on page 101] The fol-
lowing newspaper article describes a journalist’s experi-
ence renting an apartment about thirteen years ago:
. . . [A] lawyer suggested that I withhold my rent 
because my landlord had consistently failed to 
provide adequate heat, and my building was 
infested with mice and roaches. When the 
landlord took me to court for not paying rent,  
. . . . I won an abatement and did not have to 
pay any rent for six months.
[I didn’t realize] that allowing the landlord 
to take me to Housing Court would make it al-
most impossible for me to rent another apart-
ment. . . anywhere in the United States.
 
 Is it more likely that a tenant will be “blacklisted” in a city 
with rent control or one without rent control? Briefly explain.

base to Fend Off Feisty Tenants,” The Indypendent, December 12, 2008.
 3.22 Suppose that initially the gasoline market is in equi-
librium, at a price of $3.00 per gallon and a quantity of 
45 million gallons per month. Then a war in the Middle 
East disrupts imports of oil into the United States, shifting 
the supply curve for gasoline from S1 to S2. The price of 
gasoline begins to rise, and consumers protest. The federal 
government responds by setting a price ceiling of $3.00 
per gallon. Use the graph at the top of the next column to 
answer the following questions.
 
a. If there were no price ceiling, what would be the equi-
librium price of gasoline, the quantity of gasoline de-
manded, and the quantity of gasoline supplied? Now 
assume that the price ceiling is imposed and that there 
is no black market in gasoline. What are the price of

kidneys.
 
a. Draw a demand and supply graph for the market for 
kidneys. Show on your graph the legal maximum 
price of zero and indicate the quantity of kidneys sup-
plied at this price. (Hint: Because we know that some 
kidneys are donated, the quantity supplied will not be 
zero.)
 
b. The editorial argues that buying and selling kidneys 
should be legalized:
With proper regulation, a kidney market 
would be a big improvement over the current 
sorry state of affairs. Sellers could be checked 
for disease and drug use, and cared for after 
operations. . . . Buyers would get better kid-
neys, faster. Both sellers and buyers would do 
better than in the illegal market, where much 
of the money goes to middlemen.
 
 Do you agree with this argument? Should the government 
treat kidneys like other goods and allow the market to de-
termine the price?
From “Psst, Wanna Buy a Kidney?” The Economist, November 18, 
2006, p. 15.
Summary
Most taxes result in a loss of consumer surplus, a loss of producer 
surplus, and a deadweight loss. The true burden of a tax is not just 
the amount paid to government by consumers and producers but 
also includes the deadweight loss. The deadweight loss from a tax 
is the excess burden of the tax. Tax incidence is the actual division 
of the burden of a tax. In most cases, consumers and firms share 
the burden of a tax levied on a good or service.

Problems and Applications
 
4.4 Suppose the current equilibrium price of a quarter-pound 
hamburger is $5, and 10 million quarter-pound hamburg-
ers are sold per month. After the federal government im-
poses a tax of $0.50 per hamburger, the equilibrium price 
of hamburgers rises to $5.20, and the equilibrium quantity 
falls to 9 million. Illustrate this situation with a demand and 
supply graph. Be sure your graph shows the equilibrium 
price before and after the tax, the equilibrium quantity be-
fore and after the tax, and the areas representing consumer 
surplus after the tax, producer surplus after the tax, tax rev-
enue collected by the government, and deadweight loss.

4.7 [Related to Solved Problem 4.4 on page 117] Suppose 
the federal government decides to levy a sales tax on pizza 
of $1.00 per pie. Briefly explain whether you agree with the 
following statement, made by a representative of the pizza 
industry:
The pizza industry is very competitive. As a re-
sult, pizza sellers will have to pay the whole tax 
because they are unable to pass any of it on to 
consumers in the form of higher prices. There-
fore, a sales tax of $1.00 per pie will result in 
pizza sellers receiving $1.00 less on each pie 
sold, after paying the tax.

Appendix
Quantitative Demand 
and Supply Analysis
Graphs help us understand economic change qualitatively. For instance, a demand and 
supply graph can tell us that if household incomes rise, the demand curve for a nor-
mal good will shift to the right, and its price will rise. Often, though, economists, busi-
ness managers, and policymakers want to know more than the qualitative direction of 
change; they want a quantitative estimate of the size of the change.
In this chapter, we carried out a qualitative analysis of rent controls. We saw that 
imposing rent controls involves a trade-off: Renters as a group gain, but landlords lose, 
and the market for apartments becomes less efficient, as shown by the deadweight loss. 
To better evaluate rent controls, we need to know more than just that these gains and 
losses exist; we need to know how large they are. A quantitative analysis of rent controls 
will tell us how large the gains and losses are.
Demand and Supply Equations
The first step in a quantitative analysis is to supplement our use of demand and supply 
curves with demand and supply equations. We noted briefly in Chapter 3 that econo-
mists often statistically estimate equations for demand curves. Supply curves can also 
be statistically estimated. For example, suppose that economists have estimated that the 
demand for apartments in New York City is:
QD = 3,000,000 - 1,000P
and the supply of apartments is:
QS = -450,000 + 1,300P.
We have used QD for the quantity of apartments demanded per month, QS for the 
quantity of apartments supplied per month, and P for the apartment rent, in dollars per 
month. In reality, both the quantity of apartments demanded and the quantity of apart-
ments supplied will depend on more than just the rental price of apartments in New 
York City. For instance, the demand for apartments in New York City will also depend 
on the average incomes of families in the New York area and on the rents of apartments 
in surrounding cities. For simplicity, we will ignore these other factors.
With no government intervention, we know that at competitive market equilib-
rium, the quantity demanded must equal the quantity supplied, or:
QD = QS.
We can use this equation, which is called an equilibrium condition, to solve for the 
equilibrium monthly apartment rent by setting the quantity demanded from the de-
mand equation equal to the quantity supplied from the supply equation:
 3,000,000, - 1,000P = -450,000 + 1,300P
 3,450,000 = 2,300P
 P = 3,450,000
2,300
= +1,500.

We can then substitute this price back into either the supply equation or the  demand 
equation to find the equilibrium quantity of apartments rented:
 QD = 3,000,000 - 1,000P = 3,000,000 - 1,00011,5002 = 1,500,000
 QS = -450,000 + 1,300P = -450,000 + 1,30011,5002 = 1,500,000.
Figure 4A.1 illustrates the information from these equations in a graph. The  figure 
shows the values for rent when the quantity supplied is zero and when the quantity 
 demanded is zero. These values can be calculated from the demand equation and the 
supply equation by setting QD and QS equal to zero and solving for price:
 QD = 0 = 3,000,000 - 1,000P
 P = 3,000,000
1,000
= +3,000
and:
 QS = 0 = -450,000 + 1,300P
 P = -450,000
-1,300
= +346.15.
Calculating Consumer Surplus  
and Producer Surplus
Figure 4A.1 shows consumer surplus and producer surplus in this market. Recall that 
the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus equals the net benefit that rent-
ers and landlords receive from participating in the market for apartments. We can use 
the values from the demand and supply equations to calculate the value of consumer 
 surplus and producer surplus. Remember that consumer surplus is the area below the 
demand curve and above the line representing market price. Notice that this area forms 
a right triangle because the demand curve is a straight line—it is linear. As we noted in 
the appendix to Chapter 1, the area of a triangle is equal to ½ × Base × Height. In this 
case, the area is:
1>2 * 11,500,0002 * 13,000 - 1,5002 = +1,125,000,000.
So, this calculation tells us that the consumer surplus in the market for rental apart-
ments in New York City would be about $1.125 billion.
We can calculate producer surplus in a similar way. Remember that producer sur-
plus is the area above the supply curve and below the line representing market price.

Graphing Supply and Demand 
Equations
After statistically estimating supply and 
 demand equations, we can use the equations 
to draw supply and demand curves. In this 
case, the equilibrium rent for apartments 
is $1,500 per month, and the equilibrium 
quantity of apartments rented is 1,500,000. 
The supply equation tells us that at a rent of 
$346, the quantity of apartments supplied 
will be zero. The demand equation tells us 
that at a rent of $3,000, the quantity of apart-
ments demanded will be zero. The areas rep-
resenting consumer surplus and producer 
surplus are also indicated on the graph.

 
Appendix Quantitative Demand and Supply Analysis

Because our supply curve is also a straight line, producer surplus in the figure is equal 
to the area of the right triangle:
1>2 * 1,500,000 * 11,500 - 3462 = +865,500,000.
This calculation tells us that the producer surplus in the market for rental apartments in 
New York City is about $865.5 million.
We can use this same type of analysis to measure the impact of rent control on 
consumer surplus, producer surplus, and economic efficiency. For instance, suppose the 
city imposes a rent ceiling of $1,000 per month. Figure 4A.2 can help guide us as we 
measure the impact.
First, we can calculate the quantity of apartments that will actually be rented by 
substituting the rent ceiling of $1,000 into the supply equation:
QS = -450,000 + 11,300 * 1,0002 = 850,000.
We also need to know the price on the demand curve when the quantity of apart-
ments is 850,000. We can do this by substituting 850,000 for quantity in the demand 
equation and solving for price:
850,000 = 3,000,000 - 1,000P
P = -2,150,000
-1,000
= +2,150.
Compared with its value in competitive equilibrium, consumer surplus has been re-
duced by a value equal to the area of the yellow triangle B but increased by a value equal 
to the area of the blue rectangle A. The area of the yellow triangle B is:
1>2 * 11,500,000 - 850,0002 * 12,150 - 1,5002 = +211,250,000,
and the area of the blue rectangle A is Base × Height, or:
1+1,500 - +1,0002 * 1850,0002 = +425,000,000.
The value of consumer surplus in competitive equilibrium was $1,125,000,000. As a re-
sult of the rent ceiling, it will be increased to:
1+1,125,000,000 + +425,000,0002 - +211,250,000 = +1,338,750,000.
Compared with its value in competitive equilibrium, producer surplus has been 
 reduced by a value equal to the area of the yellow triangle C plus a value equal to the 
area of the blue rectangle. The area of the yellow triangle C is: 
1>2 * 11,500,000 - 850,0002 * 11,500 - 1,0002 = +162,500,000.

Calculating the Economic 
Effect of Rent Controls
Once we have estimated equations for the 
demand and supply of rental housing, a 
diagram can guide our numerical estimates 
of the economic effects of rent control. 
Consumer surplus falls by an amount equal 
to the area of the yellow triangle B and in-
creases by an amount equal to the area of the 
blue rectangle A. The difference between the 
values of these two areas is $213,750,000. 
Producer surplus falls by an amount equal to 
the area of the blue rectangle A plus the area 
of the yellow triangle C. The value of these 
two areas is $587,500,000. The remaining 
producer surplus is equal to the area of tri-
angle D, or $278,000,000. Deadweight loss is 
equal to the area of triangle B plus the area of 
triangle C, or $373,750,000.

C H A P T E R  4   Economic Efficiency, Government Price Setting, and Taxes
We have already calculated the area of the blue rectangle A as $425,000,000. The value 
of producer surplus in competitive equilibrium was $865,500,000. As a result of the rent 
ceiling, it will be reduced to:
+865,500,000 - +162,500,000 - +425,000,000 = +278,000,000.
The loss of economic efficiency, as measured by the deadweight loss, is equal to the 
value represented by the areas of the yellow triangles B and C, or:
+211,250,000 + +162,500,000 = +373,750,000.

Qualitatively, we know that imposing rent control will make consumers better off, 
make landlords worse off, and decrease economic efficiency. The advantage of the anal-
ysis we have just gone through is that it puts dollar values on the qualitative results. We 
can now see how much consumers have gained, how much landlords have lost, and 
how great the decline in economic efficiency has been. Sometimes the quantitative re-
sults can be surprising. Notice, for instance, that after the imposition of rent control, the 
deadweight loss is actually greater than the remaining producer surplus.
Economists often study issues where the qualitative results of actions are appar-
ent, even to non-economists. You don’t have to be an economist to understand who 
wins and who loses from rent control or that if a company cuts the price of its prod-
uct, its sales will increase. Business managers, policymakers, and the general public do, 
however, need economists to measure quantitatively the effects of different actions— 
including policies such as rent control—so that they can better assess the results of 
these actions.

Economics in Your Life
What’s the “Best” Level of Pollution?
Policymakers debate alternative approaches for achieving the goal of reducing carbon dioxide 
emissions. But how do we know the “best” level of carbon emissions? If carbon dioxide emissions 
hurt the environment, should the government take action to eliminate them completely? As you 
read the chapter, see if you can answer these questions. You can check your answers against those 
we provide on page 161 at the end of this chapter.
emissions at a lower cost if they are allowed 
to choose the method. Many economists ar-
gue that a more efficient way to reduce pollu-
tion is through a market-based approach, such 
as RGGI, that relies on economic incentives 
rather than on administrative rules. 
The U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA) plans to implement New 
Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for 
air pollution that would affect the entire na-
tion. As of late 2011, the EPA had yet to spell 
out the regulations under which NSPS would 
operate, but some economists and business 
leaders worried that it might lead to a com-
mand-and-control program that would shut 
down coal-fired power plants and raise elec-
tricity prices more than a market-based pro-
gram would. Thomas Fanning, the head of 
Southern Company, an electric utility based 
in Atlanta, Georgia, said his company would 
need to spend up to $4.1 billion over three 
years to comply with proposed EPA rules—
costs that would increase his  customers’ 
electricity prices by 25 percent.
As we will see in this chapter, economic 
analysis can play a significant role in evalu-
ating the effects of environmental policies.
AN INSIDE LOOK AT POLICY on 
page 162 discusses arguments for and against 
the stricter air-quality standard proposed by 
the Environmental Protection Agency.
Based on Juliet Eilperin, “New Jersey Gov. Chris  Christie 
Pulls Out of Greenhouse Gas Effort,”  Washington Post, May 
26, 2011; and Gabriel Nelson, “States, Utilities Ask EPA to 
Boost Regional Cap-And-Trade Plans,” April 19, 2011.
Pollution is a part of economic life. Consumers  
create air pollution by burning gasoline to 
power their cars and by burning natural gas 
to heat their homes. Firms create air pollution 
when they produce electricity, pesticides, or 
plastics, among other products. Utilities pro-
duce sulfur dioxide when they burn coal to 
generate electricity. Sulfur dioxide contributes 
to acid rain, which can damage trees, crops, 
and buildings. The burning of fossil fuels gen-
erates carbon dioxide and other greenhouse 
gases that can increase global warming.
Government policies to reduce pollution 
have proven to be controversial. In 2011, New 
Jersey Governor Chris Christie announced 
that he would pull the state out of the Regional 
Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), a coalition 
of 10 states that agreed to reduce their emis-
sions of carbon dioxide by 10 percent by 2018. 
Christie argued, “The whole system is not 
working as it was intended to work. It is a fail-
ure.” RGGI requires electric power plants that 
burn fossil fuels in 10 northeastern states to 
buy pollution permits for the carbon they emit. 
The permits are sold in auctions. If the cost of 
reducing emissions for a power plant is lower 
than the cost of its permits, the owner can sell 
permits to another plant that would have a 
higher cost to reduce its emissions. RGGI is an 
example of a cap-and-trade program.
In the past, Congress often ordered firms 
to use particular methods to reduce pollu-
tion, but many economists are critical of this 
 approach—known as command and  control—
because some companies can reduce their

P
ollution is just one example of an externality. An externality is a benefit or cost 
that affects someone who is not directly involved in the production or consump-
tion of a good or service. In the case of air pollution, there is a negative externality 
because, for example, people with asthma may bear a cost even though they were 
not involved in the buying or selling of the electricity that caused the pollution. Positive ex-
ternalities are also possible. For instance, medical research can provide a positive externality 
because people who are not directly involved in producing it or paying for it can benefit. A 
competitive market usually does a good job of producing the economically efficient amount 
of a good or service. This may not be true, though, if there is an externality in the market. 
When there is a negative externality, the market may produce a quantity of the good that is 
greater than the efficient amount. When there is a positive externality, the market may pro-
duce a quantity that is less than the efficient amount. In Chapter 4, we saw that government 
interventions in the economy—such as price floors on agricultural products or price ceilings 
on rents—can reduce economic efficiency. But when there are externalities, government in-
tervention may actually increase economic efficiency and enhance the well-being of society. 
The way in which government intervenes is important, however. Economists can help poli-
cymakers ensure that government programs are as efficient as possible.
In this chapter, we explore how best to deal with the problem of pollution and other 
externalities. We also look at public goods, which are goods that may not be produced at all 
unless the government produces them.
Externalities and Economic Efficiency
When you consume a Big Mac, only you benefit, but when you consume a college ed-
ucation, other people also benefit. College-educated people are less likely to commit 
crimes and, by being better-informed voters, they are more likely to contribute to better 
government policies. So, although you capture most of the benefits of your college edu-
cation, you do not capture all of them.
When you buy a Big Mac, the price you pay covers all of McDonald’s costs of pro-
ducing the Big Mac. When you buy electricity from a utility that burns coal and gener-
ates acid rain, the price you pay for the electricity does not cover the cost of the damage 
caused by the acid rain.
So, there is a positive externality in the production of college educations because 
people who do not pay for college educations will nonetheless benefit from them. There 
is a negative externality in the generation of electricity because, for example, people with 
homes on a lake from which fish and wildlife have disappeared because of acid rain have 
incurred a cost, even though they might not have bought their electricity from the pol-
luting utility.
The Effect of Externalities
Externalities interfere with the economic efficiency of a market equilibrium. We saw 
in Chapter 4 that a competitive market achieves economic efficiency by maximizing 
the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus. But that result holds only if there 
are no externalities in production or consumption. An externality causes a difference 
between the private cost of production and the social cost, or the private benefit from 
consumption and the social benefit. The private cost is the cost borne by the producer 
of a good or service. The social cost is the total cost of producing a good or service, 
and it is equal to the private cost plus any external cost, such as the cost of pollution. 
Unless there is an externality, the private cost and the social cost are equal. The pri-
vate benefit is the benefit received by the consumer of a good or service. The social 
benefit is the total benefit from consuming a good or service, and it is equal to the 
private benefit plus any external benefit, such as the benefit to others resulting from

benefit are equal.
How a Negative Externality in Production Reduces Economic  Efficiency 
Consider how a negative externality in production affects economic efficiency. In 
 Chapters 3 and 4, we assumed that the producer of a good or service must bear all the 
costs of production. We now know that this observation is not always true. In producing 
electricity, private costs are borne by the utility, but some external costs of pollution are 
borne by people who are not customers of the utility. The social cost of producing elec-
tricity is the sum of the private cost plus the external cost. Figure 5.1 shows the effect on 
the market for electricity of a negative externality in production.
S1 is the market supply curve and represents only the private costs that utilities 
have to bear in generating electricity. As we saw in Chapter 4, firms will supply an ad-
ditional unit of a good or service only if they receive a price equal to the additional 
cost of producing that unit, so a supply curve represents the marginal cost of produc-
ing a good or service. If utilities also had to bear the cost of pollution, the supply curve 
would be S2, which represents the true marginal social cost of generating electricity. The 
equilibrium with price PEfficient and quantity QEfficient is efficient. The equilibrium with 
price PMarket and quantity QMarket is not efficient. To see why, remember from Chapter 4 
that an equilibrium is economically efficient if economic surplus—which is the sum of 
consumer surplus plus producer surplus—is at a maximum. When economic surplus 
is at a  maximum, the net benefit to society from the production of the good or service 
is at a maximum. With an equilibrium quantity of QEfficient, economic surplus is at a 
maximum, so this equilibrium is efficient. But with an equilibrium quantity of QMarket, 
economic surplus is reduced by the deadweight loss, shown in Figure 5.1 by the yellow 
triangle, and the equilibrium is not efficient. The deadweight loss occurs because the 
supply curve is above the demand curve for the production of the units of electricity be-
tween QEfficient and QMarket. That is, the additional cost—including the external cost—of 
producing these units is greater than the marginal benefit to consumers, as represented 
by the demand curve. In other words, because of the cost of the pollution, economic 
 efficiency would be improved if less electricity were produced.
We can conclude the following: When there is a negative externality in producing a 
good or service, too much of the good or service will be produced at market equilibrium.
How a Positive Externality in Consumption Reduces Economic Efficiency 
We have seen that a negative externality interferes with achieving economic efficiency. 
The same holds true for a positive externality. In Chapters 3 and 4, we assumed that 
the demand curve represents all the benefits that come from consuming a good. But 
Figure 5.1
The Effect of Pollution on 
Economic Efficiency
Because utilities do not bear the cost of acid 
rain, they produce electricity beyond the 
economically efficient level. Supply curve 
S1 represents just the marginal private cost 
that the utility has to pay. Supply curve S2 
represents the marginal social cost, which 
includes the costs to those affected by acid 
rain. The figure shows that if the supply 
curve were S2, rather than S1, market equi-
librium would occur at price PEfficient and 
quantity QEfficient, the economically efficient 
level of output. But when the supply curve is 
S1, the market equilibrium occurs at price 
PMarket and quantity QMarket, where there is 
a deadweight loss equal to the area of the yel-
low triangle. Because of the deadweight loss, 
this equilibrium is not efficient.

C H A P T E R  5  Externalities, Environmental Policy, and Public Goods
we have seen that a college education generates benefits that are not captured by the 
student receiving the education and so are not included in the market demand curve for 
college educations. Figure 5.2 shows the effect of a positive externality in consumption 
on the market for college educations.
If students receiving a college education could capture all its benefits, the demand 
curve would be D2, which represents the marginal social benefits. The actual demand 
curve is D1, however, which represents only the marginal private benefits received by 
students. The efficient equilibrium would come at price PEfficient and quantity QEfficient. 
At this equilibrium, economic surplus is maximized. The market equilibrium, at price 
PMarket and quantity QMarket, will not be efficient because the demand curve is above the 
supply curve for production of the units between QMarket and QEfficient. That is, the mar-
ginal benefit—including the external benefit—for producing these units is greater than 
the marginal cost. As a result, there is a deadweight loss equal to the area of the yellow 
triangle. Because of the positive externality, economic efficiency would be improved if 
more college educations were produced. We can conclude the following: When there is a 
positive externality in consuming a good or service, too little of the good or service will be 
produced at market equilibrium.
Externalities and Market Failure
We have seen that because of externalities, the efficient level of output may not occur in 
either the market for electricity or the market for college educations. These are examples 
of market failure: situations in which the market fails to produce the efficient level of 
output. Later, we will discuss possible solutions to problems of externalities. But first we 
need to consider why externalities occur.
What Causes Externalities?
We saw in Chapter 2 that governments need to guarantee property rights in order for a 
market system to function well. Property rights refers to the rights individuals or busi-
nesses have to the exclusive use of their property, including the right to buy or sell it. 
Property can be tangible, physical property, such as a store or factory. Property can also 
be intangible, such as the right to an idea. Most of the time, the U.S. government and the 
governments of other high-income countries do a good job of enforcing property rights,

People who do not consume college edu-
cations can still benefit from them. As a 
result, the marginal social benefit from a 
college education is greater than the mar-
ginal private benefit to college students. 
Because only the marginal private benefit 
is represented in the market demand curve 
D1, the quantity of college educations pro-
duced, QMarket, is too low. If the market 
demand curve were D2 instead of D1, the 
level of college educations produced would 
be QEfficient, which is the efficient level. At 
the market equilibrium of QMarket, there is a 
deadweight loss equal to the area of the yel-
low triangle.

pollutants into Lee’s lake. Because Lee owns the lake, he can charge the paper company the 
cost of cleaning up the pollutants. The result is that the cost of the pollution is a private cost 
to the paper company and is included in the price of the paper it sells. There is no external-
ity, the efficient level of paper is produced, and there is no market failure.
Now suppose that the paper company builds its paper mill on privately owned land 
on the banks of a lake that is owned by the state. In the absence of any government 
regulations, the company will be free to discharge pollutants into the lake. The cost of 
the pollution will be external to the company because it doesn’t have to pay the cost of 
cleaning it up. More than the economically efficient level of paper will be produced, 
and a market failure will occur. Or, suppose that Lee owns the lake, but the pollution 
is caused by acid rain generated by an electric utility hundreds of miles away. The law 
does not allow Lee to charge the electric utility for the damage caused by the acid rain. 
Even though someone is damaging Lee’s property, the law does not allow him to enforce 
his property rights in this situation. Once again, there is an externality, and the market 
failure will result in too much electricity being produced.
Similarly, if you buy a house, the government will protect your right to exclusive use 
of that house. No one else can use the house without your permission. Because of your 
property rights in the house, your private benefit from the house and the social benefit 
are the same. When you buy a college education, however, other people are, in effect, 
able to benefit from your college education. You have no property right that will enable 
you to prevent them from benefiting or to charge them for the benefits they receive. 
As a result, there is a positive externality, and the market failure will result in too few 
 college educations being supplied.
We can conclude the following: Externalities and market failures result from  incomplete 
property rights or from the difficulty of enforcing property rights in certain situations.
Private Solutions to Externalities: 
The Coase Theorem
As noted at the beginning of this chapter, government intervention may actually increase 
economic efficiency and enhance the well-being of society when externalities are present. It 
is also possible, however, for people to find private solutions to the problem of externalities.
Can the market cure market failure? In an influential article written in 1960,  Ronald 
Coase of the University of Chicago, winner of the 1991 Nobel Prize in Economics, ar-
gued that under some circumstances, private solutions to the problem of externalities 
will occur. To understand Coase’s argument, it is important to recognize that completely 
eliminating an externality usually is not economically efficient. Consider pollution, for 
example. There is, in fact, an economically efficient level of pollution reduction. At first, 
this seems paradoxical. Pollution is bad, and you might think the efficient amount of a 
bad thing is zero. But it isn’t zero.
The Economically Efficient Level  
of Pollution Reduction
Chapter 1 introduced the important idea that the optimal decision is to continue any ac-
tivity up to the point where the marginal benefit equals the marginal cost. This applies 
to reducing pollution just as much as it does to other activities. Sulfur dioxide emissions 
contribute to smog and acid rain. As sulfur dioxide emissions—or any other type of 
pollution— decline, society benefits: Fewer trees die, fewer buildings are damaged, and 
fewer people suffer breathing problems. But a key point is that the additional benefit—
that is, the marginal benefit—received from eliminating another ton of sulfur dioxide 
declines as sulfur dioxide emissions are reduced. To see why this is true, consider what 
happens with no reduction in sulfur dioxide emissions. In this situation, many smoggy 
days will occur in the cities of the Midwest and Northeast. Even healthy people may 
experience breathing problems. As sulfur dioxide emissions are reduced, the number of 
smoggy days will fall, and healthy people will no longer experience breathing problems.

Eventually, if emissions of sulfur dioxide fall to low levels, even people with asthma will 
no longer be affected. Further reductions in sulfur dioxide will have little additional 
benefit. The same will be true of the other benefits from reducing sulfur dioxide emis-
sions: As the reductions increase, the additional benefits from fewer buildings and trees 
being damaged and lakes polluted will decline.

The following bar graphs show that the United States has 
made tremendous progress in reducing air pollution since 
Congress passed the Clean Air Act in 1970: Total emissions of the six main air pol-
lutants have fallen by more than half. Over the same period, real U.S. gross domestic 
product—which measures the value, corrected for inflation, of all the final goods and 
services produced in the country—almost tripled, energy consumption increased by 
half, and the number of miles traveled by all vehicles doubled.

As we have seen, when levels of pollution are high, the marginal benefit of reducing pol-
lution is also high. We would expect, then, that the benefit of reducing air pollution in 1970 
was much higher than the benefit from a proportional reduction in air pollution would be 
today, when the level of pollution is much lower. Kenneth Y. Chay of Brown University and 
Michael Greenstone of MIT have shown that the benefits from the air pollution reductions 
that occurred in the period immediately after passage of the Clean Air Act were indeed 
high. Chay and Greenstone argue that the exposure of pregnant women to high levels of air 
pollution can be damaging to their unborn children, possibly by retarding lung functioning. 
This damage would increase the chance that the infant would die in the first weeks after be-
ing born. In the two years following passage of the Clean Air Act, there was a sharp reduc-
tion in air pollution and also a reduction in infant mortality. The decline in infant mortality 
was mainly due to a reduction in deaths within one month of birth. Of course, other factors 
also may have been responsible for the decline in infant mortality, but Chay and Greenstone 
use statistical analysis to isolate the effect of the decline in air pollution. They conclude that 
“1,300 fewer infants died in 1972 than would have in the absence of the Clean Air Act.”

Private Solutions to Externalities: The Coase Theorem  
143
What about the marginal cost to electric utilities of reducing pollution? To reduce 
sulfur dioxide emissions, utilities have to switch from burning high-sulfur coal to burn-
ing more costly fuel, or they have to install pollution control devices, such as scrubbers. 
As the level of pollution falls, further reductions become increasingly costly. Reducing 
emissions or other types of pollution to very low levels can require complex and ex-
pensive new technologies. For example, Arthur Fraas, formerly of the federal Office of 
Management and Budget, and Vincent Munley, of Lehigh University, have shown that 
the marginal cost of removing 97 percent of pollutants from municipal wastewater is 
more than twice as high as the marginal cost of removing 95 percent.
The net benefit to society from reducing pollution is equal to the difference between 
the benefit of reducing pollution and the cost. To maximize the net benefit to society, 
sulfur dioxide emissions—or any other type of pollution—should be reduced up to the 
point where the marginal benefit from another ton of reduction is equal to the marginal 
cost. Figure 5.3 illustrates this point.
In Figure 5.3, we measure reductions in sulfur dioxide emissions on the horizontal 
axis. We measure the marginal benefit and marginal cost in dollars from eliminating 
another ton of sulfur dioxide emissions on the vertical axis. As reductions in pollution 
increase, the marginal benefit declines and the marginal cost increases. The economi-
cally efficient amount of pollution reduction occurs where the marginal benefit equals 
the marginal cost. The figure shows that in this case, the economically efficient reduc-
tion of sulfur dioxide emissions is 8.5 million tons per year. In a program begun in 1990, 
this is the amount of reduction Congress decided should occur by 2010. At that level of 
emission reduction, the marginal benefit and the marginal cost of the last ton of sulfur 
dioxide emissions eliminated are both $200 per ton. Suppose instead that the emissions 
target was only 7.0 million tons. The figure shows that, at that level of reduction, the 
last ton of reduction has added $250 to the benefits received by society, but it has added 
only $175 to the costs of utilities. There has been a net benefit to society from this ton 
of pollution reduction of $75. In fact, the figure shows a net benefit to society from pol-
lution reduction for every ton from 7.0 million to 8.5 million. Only when sulfur dioxide

If the reduction of sulfur dioxide emissions 
is at 7.0 million tons per year, the marginal 
benefit of $250 per ton is greater than the 
marginal cost of $175 per ton. Further re-
ductions in emissions will increase the net 
benefit to society. If the reduction of sulfur 
dioxide emissions is at 10.0 million tons, the 
marginal cost of $225 per ton is greater than 
the marginal benefit of $150 per ton. An 
increase in sulfur dioxide emissions will in-
crease the net benefit to society. Only when 
the reduction is at 8.5 million tons is the 
marginal benefit equal to the marginal cost. 
This level is the economically efficient level 
of pollution reduction.

emissions are reduced by 8.5 million tons per year will marginal benefit fall enough and 
marginal cost rise enough that the two are equal.
Now suppose Congress had set the target for sulfur dioxide emissions reduction at 
10 million tons per year. Figure 5.3 shows that the marginal benefit at that level of re-
duction has fallen to only $150 per ton and the marginal cost has risen to $225 per ton. 
The last ton of reduction has actually reduced the net benefit to society by $75 per ton. 
In fact, every ton of reduction beyond 8.5 million reduces the net benefit to society.
To summarize: If the marginal benefit of reducing sulfur dioxide emissions is 
greater than the marginal cost, further reductions will make society better off. But if the 
marginal cost of reducing sulfur dioxide emissions is greater than the marginal benefit, 
reducing sulfur dioxide emissions will actually make society worse off.
The Basis for Private Solutions to Externalities
In arguing that private solutions to the problem of externalities were possible, Ronald 
Coase emphasized that when more than the optimal level of pollution is occurring, 
the benefits from reducing the pollution to the optimal level are greater than the costs. 
 Figure 5.4 illustrates this point.
The marginal benefit curve shows the additional benefit from each reduction in a 
ton of sulfur dioxide emissions. The area under the marginal benefit curve between the 
two emission levels is the total benefit received from reducing emissions from one level 
to another. For instance, in Figure 5.4, the total benefit from increasing the reduction in 
sulfur dioxide emissions from 7.0 million tons to 8.5 million tons is the sum of the  areas 
of A and B. The marginal cost curve shows the additional cost from each reduction in 
a ton of emissions. The total cost of reducing emissions from one level to another is the 
Figure 5.4 
The Benefits of Reducing 
Pollution to the Optimal Level 
Are Greater than the Costs
Increasing the reduction in sulfur dioxide 
emissions from 7.0 million tons to 8.5  million 
tons results in total benefits equal to the sum 
of the areas A and B under the marginal 
benefits curve. The total cost of this decrease 
in pollution is equal to the area B under the 
marginal cost curve. The total benefits are 
greater than the total costs by an amount 
equal to the area of triangle A. Because the 
total benefits from reducing pollution are 
greater than the total costs, it’s possible for 
those receiving the benefits to arrive at a 
 private agreement with polluters to pay them 
to reduce pollution.

area under the marginal cost curve between the two emissions levels. The total cost 
from increasing the reduction in emissions from 7.0 million tons to 8.5 million tons is 
the area B. The net benefit from reducing emissions is the difference between the total 
cost and the total benefit, which is equal to the area of triangle A.
In Figure 5.4, the benefits from further reductions in sulfur dioxide emissions are 
much greater than the costs. In the appendix to Chapter 1, we reviewed the formula 
for calculating the area of a triangle, which is ½ 3 Base 3 Height, and the formula for 
the area of a rectangle, which is Base 3 Height. Using these formulas, we can calculate 
the value of the total benefits from the reduction in emissions and the value of the total 
costs. The value of the benefits (A + B) is $375 million. The value of the costs (B) is 
$255 million. If the people who would benefit from a reduction in pollution could get 
together, they could offer to pay the electric utilities $255 million to reduce the pollu-
tion to the optimal level. After making the payment, they would still be left with a net 
benefit of $120 million. In other words, a private agreement to reduce pollution to the 
optimal level is possible, without any government intervention.
Remember That It’s the Net Benefit 
That Counts
Why would we not want to completely eliminate anything 
unpleasant? As long as any person suffers any unpleasant 
consequences from air pollution, the marginal benefit of 
reducing air pollution will be positive. So, removing every 
particle of air pollution results in the largest total benefit to 
society. But removing every particle of air pollution is not 
optimal for the same reason that it is not optimal to remove 
every particle of dirt or dust from a room when cleaning 
it. The cost of cleaning your room is not just the price of 
the cleaning products but also the opportunity cost of your 
time. The more time you devote to cleaning your room, the 
less time you have for other activities. As you devote more 
and more additional hours to cleaning your room, the al-
ternative activities you have to give up are likely to increase 
in value, raising the opportunity cost of cleaning: Cleaning 
instead of watching TV may not be too costly, but clean-
ing instead of eating any meals or getting any sleep is very 
costly. Optimally, you should eliminate dirt in your room 
up to the point where the marginal benefit of the last dirt 
removed equals the marginal cost of removing it. Society 
should take the same approach to air pollution. The result 
is the largest net benefit to society.

Don’t Let This Happen to You
The Fable of the Bees
Apple trees must be pollinated by bees in order to bear fruit. 
Bees need the nectar from apple trees (or other plants) to 
produce honey. In an important article published in the early 
1950s, the British economist James Meade, winner of the 1977 
Nobel Prize in Economics, argued that there were positive externalities in both apple 
growing and beekeeping. The more apple trees growers planted, the more honey would 
be produced in the hives of local beekeepers. And the more hives beekeepers kept, the 
larger the apple crops in neighboring apple orchards. Meade assumed that beekeepers 
were not being compensated by apple growers for the pollination services they were pro-
viding to apple growers and that apple growers were not being compensated by beekeep-
ers for the use of their nectar in honey making. Therefore, he  concluded that unless the 
government intervened, the market would not supply enough apple trees and beehives.
Steven Cheung of the University of Washington showed, however, that govern-
ment intervention was not necessary because beekeepers and apple growers had long 
since arrived at private agreements. In fact, in Washington State, farmers with fruit or-
chards had been renting beehives to pollinate their trees since at least as early as 1917. 
 According to Cheung, “Pollination contracts usually include stipulations regarding the 
number and strength of the [bee] colonies, the rental fee per hive, the time of  delivery

Do Property Rights Matter?
In discussing the bargaining between the electric utilities and the people suffering the 
effects of the utilities’ pollution, we assumed that the electric utilities were not legally li-
able for the damage they were causing. In other words, the victims of pollution could not 
legally enforce the right of their property not to be damaged, so they would have to pay 
the utilities to reduce the pollution. But would it make any difference if the utilities were 
legally liable for the damages? Surprisingly, as Coase was the first to point out, it does not 
matter for the amount of pollution reduction. The only difference would be that now the 
electric utilities would have to pay the victims of pollution for the right to pollute rather 
than the victims having to pay the utilities to reduce pollution. Because the marginal ben-
efits and marginal costs of pollution reduction would not change, the bargaining should 
still result in the efficient level of pollution reduction—in this case, 8.5 million tons.
In the absence of the utilities being legally liable, the victims of pollution have an incen-
tive to pay the utilities to reduce pollution up to the point where the marginal benefit of the 
last ton of reduction is equal to the marginal cost. If the utilities are legally liable, they have 
an incentive to pay the victims of pollution to allow them to pollute up to the same point.
The Problem of Transactions Costs
Unfortunately, there are frequently practical difficulties that interfere with a private so-
lution to the problem of externalities. In cases of pollution, for example, there are often 
both many polluters and many people suffering from the negative effects of pollution. 
Bringing together all those suffering from pollution with all those causing the pollution 
and negotiating an agreement often fails due to transactions costs. Transactions costs are 
the costs in time and other resources that parties incur in the process of agreeing to and 
carrying out an exchange of goods or services. In this case, the transactions costs would 
include the time and other costs of negotiating an agreement, drawing up a binding con-
tract, purchasing insurance, and monitoring the agreement. Unfortunately, when many 
people are involved, the transactions costs are often higher than the net benefits from 
reducing the externality. In that case, the cost of transacting ends up exceeding the gain 
from the transaction, and a private solution to an externality problem is not feasible.
The Coase Theorem
Coase’s argument that private solutions to the problem of externalities are possible is 
summed up in the Coase theorem: If transactions costs are low, private bargaining will 
result in an efficient solution to the problem of externalities. We have seen the basis for the

Today, honeybees pollinate more than $14 billion worth of crops annually, from 
blueberries in Maine all the way to almonds in California. Increasing demand for al-
monds has expanded the crop in California until it now stretches for 300 miles, across 
580,000 acres, producing 80 percent of the world’s almonds. Currently, about 1.4 mil-
lion beehives are required to pollinate the California almond crop. Beehives are shipped 
into the state in February and March to pollinate the almond trees, and then they are 
shipped to Oregon and Washington to pollinate the cherry, pear, and apple orchards in 
those states during April and May.

Government Policies to Deal with Externalities  
147
Coase theorem in the preceding example of pollution by electric utilities: Because the 
benefits from reducing an externality are often greater than the costs, private bargaining 
can lead to an efficient outcome. But we have also seen that this outcome will occur only 
if transactions costs are low, and in the case of pollution, they usually are not. In general, 
private bargaining is most likely to reach an efficient outcome if the number of parties 
bargaining is small.
In practice, we must add a couple of other qualifications to the Coase theorem. In 
addition to low transactions costs, private solutions to the problem of externalities will oc-
cur only if all parties to the agreement have full information about the costs and benefits 
associated with the externality, and all parties must be willing to accept a reasonable agree-
ment. For example, if those suffering from the effects of pollution do not have information 
on the costs of reducing pollution, it is unlikely that the parties can reach an agreement. 
Unreasonable demands can also hinder an agreement. For instance, in the example of pol-
lution by electric utilities, we saw that the total benefit of reducing sulfur dioxide emissions 
was $375 million. Even if transactions costs are very low, if the utilities insist on being paid 
more than $375 million to reduce emissions, no agreement will be reached because the 
amount paid exceeds the value of the reduction to those suffering from the emissions.
Government Policies to Deal 
with Externalities
When private solutions to externalities are not feasible, how should the government in-
tervene? The first economist to analyze market failure systematically was A. C. Pigou, 
a British economist at Cambridge University. Pigou argued that to deal with a negative 
externality in production, the government should impose a tax equal to the cost of the 
externality. The effect of such a tax is shown in Figure 5.5, which reproduces the nega-
tive externality from acid rain shown in Figure 5.1 on page 139.
By imposing a tax on the production of electricity equal to the cost of acid rain, the 
government will cause electric utilities to internalize the externality. As a consequence, 
the cost of the acid rain will become a private cost borne by the utilities, and the sup-
ply curve for electricity will shift from S1 to S2. The result will be a decrease in the 
equilibrium output of electricity from QMarket to the efficient level, QEfficient. The price 
consumers pay for electricity will rise from PMarket—which does not include the cost of 
acid rain—to PEfficient—which does include the cost. Producers will receive a price P, 
which is equal to PEfficient minus the amount of the tax.

Analyze government policies to 
achieve economic efficiency in 
a market with an externality.
Figure 5.5 
When There Is a Negative 
Externality, a Tax Can Lead to the 
Efficient Level of Output
Because utilities do not bear the cost of acid 
rain, they produce electricity beyond the ec-
onomically efficient level. If the government 
imposes a tax equal to the cost of acid rain, 
the utilities will internalize the externality. 
As a consequence, the supply curve will shift 
up, from S1 to S2. The market equilibrium 
quantity changes from QMarket, where an 
inefficiently high level of electricity is pro-
duced, to QEfficient, the economically ef-
ficient equilibrium quantity. The price of 
electricity will rise from PMarket—which 
does not include the cost of acid rain—to 
PEfficient—which does include the cost. Con-
sumers pay the price PEfficient, while pro-
ducers receive a price P, which is equal to 
PEfficient minus the amount of the tax.

Solving the Problem
Step 1: Review the chapter material. This problem is about the government using 
a tax to deal with a negative externality in production, so you may want to 
review the section “Government Policies to Deal with Externalities,” which 
begins on page 147.
Step 2: Use the information from the graph to determine the necessary tax. The 
efficient level of toilet paper production will occur where the marginal social 
benefit from consuming toilet paper, as represented by the demand curve, is 
equal to the marginal social cost of production. The graph shows that this 
will occur at a price of $150 per ton and production of 350,000 tons. In the 
absence of government intervention, the price will be $125 per ton, and pro-
duction will be 450,000 tons. It is tempting—but incorrect!—to think that the 
government could bring about the efficient level of production by imposing 
a per-ton tax equal to the difference between the price when production is at 
its optimal level and the current market price. But this would be a tax of only 
$25. The graph shows that at the optimal level of production, the difference 
between the marginal private cost and the marginal social cost is $50. There-
fore, a tax of $50 per ton is required to shift the supply curve up from S1 to S2.

to the external benefit, students will internal-
ize the externality. The subsidy will cause the 
demand curve to shift up, from D1 to D2. As 
a result, the market equilibrium quantity will 
shift from QMarket, where an inefficiently 
low level of college educations is supplied, to 
QEfficient, the economically efficient equilib-
rium quantity.
Producers receive the price PEfficient, 
while consumers pay a price P, which is equal 
to PEfficient minus the amount of the subsidy.

Pigou also argued that the government can deal with a positive externality in con-
sumption by giving consumers a subsidy, or payment, equal to the value of the exter-
nality. The effect of the subsidy is shown in Figure 5.6, which reproduces the positive 
externality from college education shown in Figure 5.2 on page 140.
By paying college students a subsidy equal to the external benefit from a college 
education, the government will cause students to internalize the externality. That is, the 
external benefit from a college education will become a private benefit received by col-
lege students, and the demand curve for college educations will shift from D1 to D2. The 
equilibrium number of college educations supplied will increase from QMarket to the ef-
ficient level, QEfficient. Producers receive the price PEfficient, while consumers pay a price 
P, which is equal to PEfficient minus the amount of the subsidy. In fact, the government 
does heavily subsidize college educations. All states have government-operated univer-
sities that charge tuitions well below the cost of providing the education. The state and 
federal governments also provide students with grants and low-interest loans that sub-
sidize college educations. The economic justification for these programs is that college 
educations provide an external benefit to society.
Should the Government Tax  
Cigarettes and Soda?
Typically, governments use Pigouvian taxes to deal with nega-
tive externalities in production. Governments also impose 
taxes—sometimes called “sin taxes”—on products such as cigarettes and liquor. Some 
policymakers have argued that these products generate negative externalities in con-
sumption, so a tax on them can increase economic efficiency. Recently, several cities 
have considered taxing sweetened soda, on the grounds that these sodas cause a nega-
tive externality by raising medical costs. Just as governments can deal with a positive 
externality in consumption by giving consumers a subsidy, they can deal with a nega-
tive externality by imposing a tax. The effect of a tax on soda is shown in the figure 
on the next page. By imposing a tax on soda, the government will cause consumers 
to internalize the externality. That is, the external cost to drinking soda will become 
a private cost paid by consumers. Because consumers now have to pay a tax on soda, 
at every quantity they are willing to pay less than they would have without the tax, so 
the demand curve for soda will shift down by the amount of the tax, from D1 to D2. 
The equilibrium quantity of sodas consumed will decrease from QMarket to the efficient

But do people actually cause a negative externality by smoking and drinking sweet-
ened sodas? It might seem that they don’t because consumers of cigarettes and sodas 
bear the costs of any health problems they experience. In fact, though, the higher medi-
cal expenses from treating the complications of cigarette smoking or obesity are not 
paid for entirely by the smokers or soda drinkers. A smoker who receives health insur-
ance through his employer may increase the costs of that insurance, which will be paid 
for by all of the workers at the firm. Similarly, someone who is over 65 and is part of 
the federal government’s Medicare program has his or her health care paid for partly by 
taxpayers. The costs of medical care that are not paid for by smokers or soda drinkers 
would appear to represent a negative externality.
There is a complication to this conclusion, however: Smokers and people who are 
obese tend to die early. This tragic outcome means that smokers and the obese may 
have been paying taxes to help pay for Social Security and Medicare benefits that they 
will never receive. They may also have made payments into company and public em-
ployee pension plans and purchased long-term care insurance, but they may not have 
lived long enough to receive many pension payments or to have spent time in a nursing  
home. So, there are offsetting effects: While alive, smokers and obese people may im-
pose costs on others who bear the expense of their higher medical costs, but because 
they are likely to die early, they provide a financial gain to recipients of Social Security, 
Medicare, company and public employee pension plans, and purchasers of long-term 
care insurance. W. Kip Viscusi of Vanderbilt University has studied the case of tobacco 
smoking and concluded that the external costs and benefits roughly offset each other, 
meaning that there doesn’t appear to be a significant negative externality from smoking. 
Studies of obesity have arrived at somewhat conflicting results: A study of obesity in 
the Netherlands found that the cost savings from premature death offset the additional 
lifetime medical costs of obese people. But another study on U.S. data found that obesity 
did lead to a net increase in lifetime medical costs, even taking into account the shorter 
average life spans of obese people.
There may also be costs to smoking and obesity beyond additional medical costs. 
Smokers may inflict costs on others because of secondhand smoke or because smoking 
during pregnancy can lead to low birth weights and other health problems for babies. 
Airlines have noted that they spend more on fuel costs because of the increasing weight 
of passengers.
level, QEfficient. (Note that as we saw in Chapter 4, pages 118–119, we get the same result 
whether the government imposes a tax on the buyers of a good or on the sellers.)

 
Government Policies to Deal with Externalities  
151
Because Pigou was the first economist to propose using government taxes and 
subsidies to deal with externalities, they are sometimes referred to as Pigovian taxes 
and subsidies. Note that a Pigovian tax eliminates deadweight loss and improves eco-
nomic efficiency. This situation is the opposite of the one we saw in Chapter 4, in 
which we discussed how most taxes reduce consumer surplus and producer surplus 
and create a deadweight loss. In fact, one reason that economists support Pigovian 
taxes as a way to deal with negative externalities is that the government can use the 
revenues raised by Pigovian taxes to lower other taxes that reduce economic effi-
ciency. For instance, the Canadian province of British Columbia has enacted a Pigov-
ian tax on emissions of carbon dioxide and uses the revenue raised to reduce personal 
income taxes.
Command-and-Control versus Market-Based 
Approaches
Although the federal government has sometimes used taxes and subsidies to deal with 
externalities, in dealing with pollution, it has traditionally used a command-and-control 
approach with firms that pollute. A command-and-control approach to reducing pol-
lution involves the government imposing quantitative limits on the amount of pollution 
firms are allowed to generate or requiring firms to install specific pollution control de-
vices. For example, in the 1980s, the federal government required auto manufacturers 
such as Ford and General Motors to install catalytic converters to reduce auto emissions 
on all new automobiles.
Congress could have used direct pollution controls to deal with the problem of acid 
rain. To achieve its objective of a reduction of 8.5 million tons per year in sulfur dioxide 
emissions by 2010, Congress could have required every utility to reduce sulfur dioxide 
emissions by the same specified amount. However, this approach would not have been 
an economically efficient solution to the problem because utilities can have very differ-
ent costs of reducing sulfur dioxide emissions. Some utilities that already use low-sulfur 
coal can reduce emissions further only at a high cost. Other utilities, particularly those 
in the Midwest, are able to reduce emissions at a lower cost.
Congress decided to use a market-based approach to reducing sulfur dioxide emis-
sions by setting up a cap-and-trade system of tradable emissions allowances. The fed-
eral government gave utilities allowances equal to the total amount of allowable sulfur 
dioxide emissions. The utilities were then free to buy and sell the allowances. An active 
market where the allowances can be bought and sold is conducted on the Chicago Mer-
cantile Exchange. Utilities that could reduce emissions at low cost have done so and 
have sold their allowances. Utilities that could only reduce emissions at high cost have 
bought allowances. Using tradable emissions allowances to reduce acid rain has been a 
great success and has made it possible for utilities to meet Congress’s emissions goal at a 
much lower cost than expected. Just before Congress enacted the allowances program in 
1990, the Edison Electric Institute estimated that the cost to utilities of complying with 
Pigovian taxes and subsidies 
Government taxes and subsidies 
intended to bring about an efficient 
level of output in the presence of 
externalities.
Command-and-control approach 
An approach that involves the 
government imposing quantitative 
limits on the amount of pollution 
firms are allowed to emit or requiring 
firms to install specific pollution 
control devices.
In the end, economists and policymakers continue to debate whether the govern-
ment should use taxes to deal with negative externalities in consumption.

the program would be $7.4 billion by 2010. By 1994, the federal government’s General 
Accounting Office estimated that the cost would be less than $2 billion. In practice, the 
cost appears likely to be almost 90 percent less than the initial estimate, or only about 
$870 million.
Are Tradable Emissions Allowances Licenses  
to Pollute?
Some environmentalists have criticized tradable emissions allowances, labeling them 
“licenses to pollute.” They argue that just as the government does not issue licenses to 
rob banks or to drive drunk, it should not issue licenses to pollute. But this criticism ig-
nores one of the central lessons of economics: Resources are scarce, and trade-offs exist. 
Resources that are spent on reducing one type of pollution are not available to reduce 
other types of pollution or for any other use. Because reducing acid rain using tradable 
emissions allowances has cost utilities $870 million, rather than $7.4 billion, as origi-
nally estimated, society has saved more than $6.5 billion per year.
Can a Cap-and-Trade System  
Reduce Global Warming?
In the past 35 years, the global surface temperature has in-
creased about 0.75 degree Fahrenheit (or 0.40 degree Centi-
grade) compared with the average for the period between 1951 and 1980. The following 
graph shows changes in temperature over the years since 1880.

Over the centuries, global temperatures have gone through many long periods 
of warming and  cooling. Nevertheless, many scientists are convinced that the recent 
warming trend is not part of the natural fluctuations in temperature but is instead 
primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels, such as coal, natural gas, and petroleum. 
Burning these fuels releases carbon dioxide, which accumulates in the atmosphere as a 
“greenhouse gas.” Greenhouse gases cause some of the heat released from the earth to 
be reflected back, increasing temperatures. Annual emissions of carbon dioxide have 

 
Four Categories of Goods 
153
increased from about 50 million metric tons of carbon in 1850 to 1,600 million metric 
tons in 1950 and to nearly 8,500 million metric tons in 2008.
If greenhouse gases continue to accumulate in the atmosphere, according to some 
estimates global temperatures could increase by 3 degrees Fahrenheit or more during 
the next 100 years. Such an increase in temperature could lead to significant changes in 
climate, which might result in more hurricanes and other violent weather conditions, 
disrupt farming in many parts of the world, and lead to increases in sea levels, which 
could lead to flooding in coastal areas.
Although most economists and policymakers agree that emitting carbon dioxide re-
sults in a significant negative externality, there has been a long and heated debate over 
which policies should be adopted. Part of the debate arises from disagreements over how 
rapidly global warming is likely to occur and what the economic cost will be. In addition, 
carbon dioxide emissions are a global problem; sharp reductions in carbon dioxide emis-
sions only in the United States and Europe, for instance, would not be enough to eliminate 
global warming. But coordinating policy across countries has proven difficult. Finally, 
policymakers and economists debate the relative effectiveness of different policies.
Several approaches to reducing carbon dioxide emissions have been used. As men-
tioned earlier, the Canadian province of British Columbia has introduced a Pigovian 
tax on carbon dioxide emissions. Cap-and-trade policies, similar to the one used suc-
cessfully in the United States to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions, have also been tried. 
In 2005, 24 countries in the European Union set up a cap-and-trade system called the 
European Union Emissions Trading Scheme. Under this program, each country issues 
emission allowances that can be freely traded over time. Although carbon dioxide emis-
sions rose slightly during the first few years of the plan, over time, as the number of 
emission allowances is reduced, emissions should decline. In 2009, President Barack 
Obama proposed a cap-and-trade system for the United States that would result in grad-
ually reducing carbon dioxide emissions to their 1990 level by 2020 and to 80  percent 
below their 1990 level by 2050. However, Congress failed to approve the plan. As we saw 
in the chapter opener, beginning in 2005, several states in the Northeast established a 
cap-and-trade program, with the goal of reducing carbon dioxide emissions from power 
plants by 10 percent by 2018. Beginning in 2008, power plants in the states participat-
ing in the program were required to buy emissions permits, which made the program 
the first in the United States to limit greenhouse gas emissions. Critics questioned the 
effectiveness of a plan limited to one region and, as we have seen, in 2011, New Jersey 
Governor Christie withdrew his state from the program. The federal government in-
tends to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the Environmental Protection Agen-
cy’s (EPA’s) New Source Performance Standards. As of late 2011, the details of the EPA’s 
new program had not been announced.
The debate over which policies to use in reducing carbon dioxide emissions will 
likely continue for many years.

Four Categories of Goods
We can explore further the question of when the market is likely to succeed in supply-
ing the efficient quantity of a good by understanding that goods differ on the basis of 
whether their consumption is rival and excludable. Rivalry occurs when one person’s 
consuming a unit of a good means no one else can consume it. If you consume a Big

Figure 5.7 
Four Categories of Goods
Goods and services can be divided into four 
categories on the basis of whether people 
can be excluded from consuming them 
and whether they are rival in consumption. 
A good or service is rival in consumption 
if one person consuming a unit of a good 
means that another person cannot consume 
that unit.
Examples:
National defense
Court system
Public Goods

Tuna in the ocean
Public pasture land
Common Resources
Examples:

Toll road
Quasi-Public Goods
Examples:

Running shoes

Nonrival
Mac, for example, no one else can consume it. Excludability means that anyone who 
does not pay for a good cannot consume it. If you don’t pay for a Big Mac, MacDonald’s 
can exclude you from consuming it. The consumption of a Big Mac is therefore rival 
and excludable. The consumption of some goods, however, can be either nonrival or 
nonexcludable. Nonrival means that one person’s consumption does not interfere with 
another person’s consumption. Nonexcludable means that it is impossible to exclude 
others from consuming the good, whether they have paid for it or not. Figure 5.7 shows 
four possible categories into which goods can fall.
We next consider each of the four categories:
 1. Private goods. A good that is both rival and excludable is a private good. Food, 
clothing, haircuts, and many other goods and services fall into this category. One 
person’s consuming a unit of these goods precludes other people from consuming 
that unit, and no one can consume these goods without buying them. Although 
we didn’t state it explicitly, when we analyzed the demand and supply for goods 
and services in Chapter 3, we assumed that the goods and services were all private 
goods.
 2. Public goods. A public good is both nonrival and nonexcludable. Public goods 
are often, although not always, supplied by a government rather than by private 
firms. The classic example of a public good is national defense. Your consuming 
national defense does not interfere with your neighbor’s consuming it, so con-
sumption is nonrival. You also cannot be excluded from consuming it, whether 
you pay for it or not. No private firm would be willing to supply national defense 
because everyone can consume national defense without paying for it. The behav-
ior of consumers in this situation is referred to as free riding. Free riding involves 
individuals benefiting from a good—in this case, the provision of national de-
fense—without paying for it.
 3. Quasi-public goods. Some goods are excludable but not rival. An example is cable 
television. People who do not pay for cable television do not receive it, but one per-
son’s watching it doesn’t affect other people’s watching it. The same is true of a toll 
road. Anyone who doesn’t pay the toll doesn’t get on the road, but one person using 
the road doesn’t interfere with someone else using the road (unless so many people 
are using the road that it becomes congested). Goods that fall into this category are 
called quasi-public goods.
 4. Common resources. If a good is rival but not excludable, it is a common resource. 
Forest land in many poor countries is a common resource. If one person cuts down 
a tree, no one else can use the tree. But if no one has a property right to the forest, 
no one can be excluded from using it. As we will discuss in more detail later, people 
often overuse common resources.
We discussed the demand and supply for private goods in Chapter 3. For the 
 remainder of this chapter, we focus on the categories of public goods and common 
 resources. To determine the optimal quantity of a public good, we have to modify the 
demand and supply analysis of Chapter 3 to take into account that a public good is both 
nonrival and nonexcludable.
Rivalry The situation that occurs when 
one person’s consuming a unit of a good 
means no one else can consume it.
Excludability The situation in which 
anyone who does not pay for a good 
cannot consume it.
Private good A good that is both 
rival and excludable.
Public good A good that is both 
nonrival and nonexcludable.
Free riding Benefiting from a good 
without paying for it.
Common resource A good that is 
rival but not excludable.

 
Four Categories of Goods 
155
The Demand for a Public Good
We can determine the market demand curve for a good or service by adding up the 
quantity of the good demanded by each consumer at each price. To keep things simple, 
let’s consider the case of a market with only two consumers. Figure 5.8 shows that the 
market demand curve for hamburgers depends on the individual demand curves of Jill 
and Joe. 
At a price of $4.00, Jill demands 2 hamburgers per week and Joe demands 4. Add-
ing horizontally, the combination of a price of $4.00 per hamburger and a quantity de-
manded of 6 hamburgers will be a point on the market demand curve for hamburgers. 
Similarly, adding horizontally at a price of $1.50, we have a price of $1.50 and a quantity 
demanded of 11 as another point on the market demand curve. A consumer’s demand 
curve for a good represents the marginal benefit the consumer receives from the good, 
so when we add together the consumers’ demand curves, we not only have the market 
demand curve but also the marginal social benefit curve for this good, assuming that 
there is no externality in consumption.
How can we find the demand curve or marginal social benefit curve for a public 
good? Once again, for simplicity, assume that Jill and Joe are the only consumers. Un-
like with a private good, where Jill and Joe can end up consuming different quantities, 
with a public good, they will consume the same quantity. Suppose that Jill owns a service 
station on an isolated rural road, and Joe owns a car dealership next door. These are the 
only two businesses around for miles. Both Jill and Joe are afraid that unless they hire a 
security guard at night, their businesses may be burgled. Like national defense, the ser-
vices of a security guard are in this case a public good: Once hired, the guard will be able 
to protect both businesses, so the good is nonrival. It also will not be possible to exclude 
either business from being protected, so the good is nonexcludable.
To arrive at a demand curve for a public good, we don’t add quantities at each 
price, as with a private good. Instead, we add the price each consumer is willing to 
pay for each quantity of the public good. This value represents the total dollar amount 
consumers as a group would be willing to pay for that quantity of the public good. Put 
another way, to find the demand curve, or marginal social benefit curve, for a pri-
vate good, we add the demand curves of individual consumers horizontally; for public 
goods, we add individual demand curves vertically. Figure 5.9 shows how the marginal 
social benefit curve for security guard services depends on the individual demand 
curves of Jill and Joe.

The market demand curve for private goods is determined by adding horizon-

instance, in panel (a), Jill demands 2 hamburgers when the price is $4.00, and 
in panel (b), Joe demands 4 hamburgers when the price is $4.00. So, a quantity 
of 6 hamburgers and a price of $4.00 is a point on the market demand curve in 
panel (c).

C H A P T E R  5  Externalities, Environmental Policy, and Public Goods
The figure shows that Jill is willing to pay $8 per hour for the guard to provide  
10 hours of protection per night. Joe would suffer a greater loss from a burglary, so he 
is willing to pay $10 per hour for the same amount of protection. Adding the dollar 
amount that each is willing to pay gives us a price of $18 per hour and a quantity of  
10 hours as a point on the marginal social benefit curve for security guard services. The 
figure also shows that because Jill is willing to spend $4 per hour for 15 hours of guard 
services and Joe is willing to pay $5, a price of $9 per hour and a quantity of 15 hours is 
another point on the marginal social benefit curve for security guard services.
The Optimal Quantity of a Public Good
We know that to achieve economic efficiency, a good or service should be produced 
up to the point where the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus is maxi-
mized, or, alternatively, where the marginal social cost equals the marginal social 
Figure 5.9 
Constructing the Demand

To find the demand curve for a public good, 
we add up the price at which each consumer

$8 per hour for a security guard to provide 
10 hours of protection. In panel (b), Joe is 
willing to pay $10 for that level of protec-
tion. Therefore, in panel (c), the price of $18 
per hour and the quantity of 10 hours will 
be a point on the demand curve for security 
guard services.

benefit. Therefore, the optimal quantity of security guard services—or any other pub-
lic good—will occur where the marginal social benefit curve intersects the supply 
curve. As with private goods, in the absence of an externality in production, the sup-
ply curve represents the marginal social cost of supplying the good. Figure 5.10 shows 
that the optimal quantity of security guard services supplied is 15 hours, at a price of 
$9 per hour.
Will the market provide the economically efficient quantity of security guard ser-
vices? One difficulty is that the individual preferences of consumers, as shown by their 
demand curves, are not revealed in this market. This difficulty does not arise with 
 private goods because consumers must reveal their preferences in order to purchase 
private goods. If the market price of Big Macs is $4.00, Joe either reveals that he is 
 willing to pay that much by buying it or he does without it. In our example, neither 
Jill nor Joe can be excluded from consuming the services provided by a security guard 
once either hires one, and, therefore, neither has an incentive to reveal her or his pref-
erences. In this case, though, with only two consumers, it is likely that private bargain-
ing will result in an efficient quantity of the public good. This outcome is not likely 
for a public good—such as national defense—that is supplied by the government to 
 millions of consumers.
Governments sometimes use cost–benefit analysis to determine what quantity of a 
public good should be supplied. For example, before building a dam on a river, the fed-
eral government will attempt to weigh the costs against the benefits. The costs include 
the opportunity cost of other projects the government cannot carry out if it builds the 
dam. The benefits include improved flood control or new recreational opportunities on 
the lake formed by the dam. However, for many public goods, including national de-
fense, the government does not use a formal cost–benefit analysis. Instead, the quantity 
of national defense supplied is determined by a political process involving Congress and 
the president. Even here, of course, Congress and the president realize that trade-offs 
are involved: The more resources used for national defense, the fewer resources avail-
able for other public goods or for private goods.

plus and producer surplus is maximized,

a.  Draw a graph that shows the optimal level of secu-
rity guard services. Be sure to label the curves on 
the graph.
 
b.  Briefly explain why 8 hours of security guard pro-
tection is not an optimal quantity.
Solving the Problem
Step 1: Review the chapter material. This problem is about determining the optimal 
level of public goods, so you may want to review the section “The Optimal 
Quantity of a Public Good,” which begins on page 156.
Step 2: Begin by deriving the demand curve or marginal social benefit curve for 
security guard services. To calculate the marginal social benefit of guard 
services, we need to add the prices that Jill and Joe are willing to pay at each 
quantity:

Step 3: Answer part (a) by plotting the demand (marginal social benefit) and sup-

security guard services is 6 hours.

 
Four Categories of Goods 
159
Common Resources
In England during the Middle Ages, each village had an area of pasture, known as a 
commons, on which any family in the village was allowed to graze its cows or sheep 
without charge. Of course, the grass one family’s cow ate was not available for another 
family’s cow, so consumption was rival. But every family in the village had the right to 
use the commons, so it was nonexcludable. Without some type of restraint on usage, the 
commons would be overgrazed. To see why, consider the economic incentives facing a 
family that was thinking of buying another cow and grazing it on the commons. The 
family would gain the benefits from increased milk production, but adding another cow 
to the commons would create a negative externality by reducing the amount of grass 
available for the cows of other families. Because this family—and the other families in 
the village—did not take this negative externality into account when deciding whether 
to add another cow to the commons, too many cows would be added. The grass on the 
commons would eventually be depleted, and no family’s cow would get enough to eat.
The Tragedy of the Commons The tendency for a common resource to be over-
used is called the tragedy of the commons. The forests in many poor countries are a 
modern example. When a family chops down a tree in a public forest, it takes into ac-
count the benefits of gaining firewood or wood for building, but it does not take into 
account the costs of deforestation. Haiti, for example, was once heavily forested. Today, 
80 percent of the country’s forests have been cut down, primarily to be burned to create 
charcoal, which is used for heating and cooking. Because the mountains no longer have 
tree roots to hold the soil, heavy rains lead to devastating floods. The following is from a 
newspaper account of tree cutting in Haiti:
“No Tree Cutting” signs hang over the park entrance, but without money and 
manpower, there is no way to enforce that. Loggers make nightly journeys, hack-
ing away at trees until they fall. The next day, they’re on a truck out. Days later, 
they’ve been chopped up, burned and packaged in white bags offered for sale by 
soot-covered women. “This is the only way I can feed my four kids,” said Vena 
Verone, one of the vendors. “I’ve heard about the floods and deforestation that 
caused them, but there’s nothing I can do about that.”
Tragedy of the commons The 
tendency for a common resource to 
be overused.
Step 4: Answer part (b) by explaining why 8 hours of security guard protection is 
not an optimal quantity. For each hour beyond 6, the supply curve is above 
the demand curve. Therefore, the marginal social benefit received will be less 
than the marginal social cost of supplying these hours. This results in a dead-
weight loss and a reduction in economic surplus.

C H A P T E R  5  Externalities, Environmental Policy, and Public Goods
Figure 5.11 shows that with a common resource such as wood from a forest, the 
efficient level of use, QEfficient, is determined by the intersection of the demand curve—
which represents the marginal social benefit received by consumers—and S2, which 
represents the marginal social cost of cutting the wood. As in our discussion of nega-
tive externalities, the social cost is equal to the private cost of cutting the wood plus the 
external cost. In this case, the external cost represents the fact that the more wood each 
person cuts, the less wood there is available for others and the greater the deforestation, 
which increases the chances of floods. Because each individual tree cutter ignores the 
external cost, the equilibrium quantity of wood cut is QActual, which is greater than the 
efficient quantity. At the actual equilibrium level of output, there is a deadweight loss, as 
shown in Figure 5.11 by the yellow triangle.
Is There a Way Out of the Tragedy of the Commons? Notice that our discus-
sion of the tragedy of the commons is very similar to our earlier discussion of nega-
tive externalities. The source of the tragedy of the commons is the same as the source 
of negative externalities: lack of clearly defined and enforced property rights. For in-
stance, suppose that instead of being held as a collective resource, a piece of pastureland 
is owned by one person. That person will take into account the effect of adding another 
cow on the food available to cows already using the pasture. As a result, the optimal 
number of cows will be placed on the pasture. Over the years, most of the commons 
lands in England were converted to private property. Most of the forest land in Haiti 
and other developing countries is actually the property of the government. The failure 
of the government to protect the forests against trespassers or convert them to private 
property is the key to their overuse.
In some situations, though, enforcing property rights is not feasible. An example 
is the oceans. Because no country owns the oceans beyond its own coastal waters, the 
fish and other resources of the ocean will remain a common resource. In situations in 
which enforcing property rights is not feasible, two types of solutions to the tragedy of 
the commons are possible. If the geographic area involved is limited and the number of 
people involved is small, access to the commons can be restricted through community 
norms and laws. If the geographic area or the number of people involved is large, legal 
restrictions on access to the commons are required. As an example of the first type of 
solution, the tragedy of the commons was avoided in the Middle Ages by traditional 
limits on the number of animals each family was allowed to put on the common  pasture. 
Although these traditions were not formal laws, they were usually enforced adequately 
by social pressure.
Figure 5.11 
Overuse of a Common 
Resource
For a common resource such as wood from 
a forest, the efficient level of use, QEfficient, 
is determined by the intersection of the 
demand curve—which represents the mar-
ginal benefit received by consumers—and 
S2, which represents the marginal social 
cost of cutting the wood. Because each in-
dividual tree cutter ignores the external 
cost, the equilibrium quantity of wood cut 
is QActual, which is greater than the efficient 
quantity. At the actual equilibrium level of 
output, there is a deadweight loss, as shown 
by the yellow triangle.

Conclusion 
161
With the second type of solution, the government imposes restrictions on access 
to the common resources. These restrictions can take several different forms, of which 
taxes, quotas, and tradable permits are the most common. By setting a tax equal to the 
external cost, governments can ensure that the efficient quantity of a resource is used. 
Quotas, or legal limits, on the quantity of the resource that can be taken during a given 
time period have been used in the United States to limit access to pools of oil that are 
beneath property owned by many different persons. The governments of Canada, New 
Zealand, and Iceland have used a system of tradable permits to restrict access to ocean 
fisheries. Under this system, a total allowable catch (TAC) limits the number of fish that 
fishermen can catch during a season. The fishermen are then assigned permits called 
individual transferable quotas (ITQs) that are equal to the total allowable catch. This 
system operates like the tradable emissions allowances described earlier in this chapter. 
The fishermen are free to use the ITQs or to sell them, which ensures that the fishermen 
with the lowest costs use the ITQs. The use of ITQs has sometimes proven controversial, 
which has limited their use in managing fisheries along the coastal United States. Crit-
ics argue that allowing trading of ITQs can result in their concentration in the hands of 
a relatively few large commercial fishing firms. Such a concentration may, though, be 
economically efficient if these firms have lower costs than smaller, family-based firms.

Economics in Your Life
What’s the “Best” Level of Pollution?
At the beginning of the chapter, we asked you to think about what the “best” level of carbon 
emissions is. Conceptually, this is a straightforward question to answer: The efficient level of car-
bon emissions is the level for which the marginal benefit of reducing carbon emissions exactly 
equals the marginal cost of reducing carbon emissions. In practice, however, this is a very difficult 
question to answer. Scientists disagree about how much carbon emissions are contributing to cli-
mate change and what the damage from climate change will be. In addition, the cost of reducing 
carbon emissions depends on the method of reduction used. As a result, neither the marginal cost 
curve nor the marginal benefit curve for reducing carbon emissions is known with certainty. This 
uncertainty makes it difficult for policymakers to determine the economically efficient level of car-
bon emissions and is the source of much of the current debate. In any case, economists agree that 
the total cost of completely eliminating carbon emissions is much greater than the total benefit.
Conclusion
In Chapter 4, we saw that government intervention in the economy can reduce eco-
nomic efficiency. In this chapter, however, we have seen that the government plays an 
indispensable role in the economy when the absence of well-defined and enforceable 
property rights keeps the market from operating efficiently. For instance, because no 
one has a property right for clean air, in the absence of government intervention, firms 
will produce too great a quantity of products that generate air pollution. We have also 
seen that public goods are nonrival and nonexcludable and are, therefore, often supplied 
directly by the government.

Business Blasts 
Ozone Limits: Trade 
Groups Warn White 
House That New 
EPA Curbs Would 
Choke Off Growth
Business groups are stepping up pres-
sure on the Obama administration to 
stop the Environmental Protection 
Agency from enacting tougher limits 
on smog-forming ozone, saying a new 
rule pending White House approval 
would damp the fragile economic 
recovery.
 EPA administrator Lisa  Jackson 
is pushing back, with encouragement 
from environmental and  medical 
groups, stressing the threat smog 
poses to public health and liken-
ing some of the groups’ warnings to 
predictions in the 1990s that tighter 
limits on ozone would lead to the ban-
ning of fireworks and backyard bar-
becues. The EPA says tightening the 
standard could save as many as 12,000 
lives a year and generate as much as 
$100 billion annually in health ben-
efits by 2020, by reducing spending 
on health problems associated with 
excessive ozone, such as asthma and 
bronchitis.
A White House spokesman said 
that President Barack Obama sup-
ported a standard “guided by science 
and the law” and that in implement-
ing a standard “we will do so in a way 
that maximizes flexibility to ensure it 
does not impede our economic recov-
ery in any way.”
WALL STREET JOURNAL
The ozone issue presents the 
White House with a difficult choice 
between angering environmentalists, 
many of whom cheered Mr. Obama’s 
election in 2008 but have voiced 
disappointment with some of his 
policies, and vexing the business 
 community—and opening itself to 
further Republican attacks on the 
president’s regulatory policies as the 
election campaign gets under way. 
Business groups are casting the pro-
posal as a threat to jobs, a sensitive 
issue with unemployment above 9%, 
and sense that Ms. Jackson, who in 
the case of ozone faces no court man-
date, is vulnerable.
 In recent days, the heads of more 
than half a dozen trade associations  
. . . have met with Ms. Jackson to try to 
persuade her not to go forward with a  
proposal to set the nation’s air-quality 
standard for ozone at 60 to 70 parts 
per billion. In 2008, the George 
W. Bush administration tightened the 
ozone standard to 75 ppb, where it 
stands now, from 84 ppb.
The new constraint would be 
expensive. The EPA says a standard 
of 60 ppb could cost the economy 
as much as $90 billion annually by 
2020. The costs could include new 
emissions controls that businesses 
might have to install; higher electric-
ity prices as power plants switched to 
cleaner-burning but costlier fuels; and 
more frequent auto inspections. Busi-
ness groups say the costs could be sig-
nificantly higher because the proposal 
assumes the use of certain technolo-
gies that have yet to be developed.
Local governments deemed out 
of compliance with federal air-quality 
Pros and Cons of Tougher  
Air Pollution Regulations
standards must come up with plans 
for achieving compliance or risk the 
loss of federal highway dollars. Busi-
ness groups say new and expanding 
businesses would be required to in-
stall new pollution controls to avoid 
any emission increases, and some 
would either hold off on investing or 
shift their operations elsewhere, in-
cluding outside the U.S.
 The chairman of the Business 
Roundtable’s Regulatory Reform 
Working Group, Dow Chemical Co. 
CEO Andrew Liveris, has also ap-
pealed to White House Chief of Staff 
Bill Daley, telling him in an open let-
ter last week that whatever standard 
the administration picks would be 
prohibitively expensive and could 
“seriously impede economic expan-
sion.” Just last month, Mr. Obama 
 announced that Mr. Liveris would 
lead a joint effort by industry, univer-
sities and the federal government to 
help reposition the U.S. as a leader in 
cutting-edge manufacturing. . . .
The American Lung Association 
wrote in its own letter to Mr. Daley on 
Monday that “following the advice of 
the [Business] Roundtable will lead to 
unnecessary illness and death and is 
not in compliance with the law.” The 
group noted that the EPA’s proposal is 
consistent with the recommendation 
of a 23-member panel of scientists who 
advised the agency on the issue after 
reviewing more than 1,700 studies. . . .

Key Points in the Article
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
is proposing a stricter air-quality standard 
for ozone emissions of 60 to 70 parts per 
billion (ppb), down from the current stan-
dard of 75 ppb. Environmental and medical 
groups are encouraging the EPA to move 
forward with the new regulation, citing the 
health benefits from the lower limit, includ-
ing fewer deaths and reduced future spend-
ing on pollution-related illnesses. Business 
groups are fighting the stricter regulations, 
arguing that the costs to implement them 
would be prohibitively expensive to both 
businesses and households and have the 
potential of threatening the job market and 
seriously impeding economic recovery.
Analyzing the News
a Implementing the stricter air-quality 
standards proposed by the EPA can be 
viewed as an effort to reduce a negative ex-
ternality. Environmental and medical orga-
nizations argue that the more stringent 
ozone regulations would reduce smog lev-
els across the country, which they claim 
would generate significant health benefits 
by reducing spending on ozone-related ill-
nesses by as much as $100 billion annually 
by 2020. A negative externality in produc-
tion, such as air pollution, reduces eco-
nomic efficiency because the producers do 
not bear all the  external costs of the pollu-
tion. This type of externality results in a 
greater than efficient quantity of the good 
being produced and a lower than efficient 
market price. By increasing the pollution 
standards, firms would bear more of the ex-
ternal cost of production, and this would 
result in a more economically efficient out-
put and a higher selling price.
b Although the EPA has noted the poten-
tial savings in health care spending, the 
agency also acknowledges that an ozone 
standard of 60 ppb could cost the economy 
as much as $90 billion annually by 2020. 
Business groups say that the costs could 
be even higher. Under the proposal, busi-
nesses may have to invest in new emissions 
controls to meet the higher standard, and 
households and businesses would likely 
pay higher electricity prices since power 
providers would be required to switch to 
cleaner and higher-priced fuels. If the EPA 
does implement the new standards by im-
posing quantitative limits on the amount of 
smog-forming ozone firms are allowed to 
emit, the EPA would be using a command-
and-control approach to deal with this neg-
ative externality. Firms would be required to 
meet the new pollution standard, and for 
many this would require additional invest-
ment in pollution-reduction equipment. The 
figure below shows how pollution affects 
economic efficiency. With the implementa-
tion of new pollution regulations, firms 
would bear more of the external cost of pol-
lution, so S1 would shift up toward S2, nar-
rowing the gap between the marginal 
private cost and the marginal social cost. 
The quantity being produced would decline 
and the price would increase, with each 
moving closer to the efficient equilibrium.
c With business groups claiming that the 
new pollution regulations will be prohibi-
tively expensive and that they could signifi-
cantly hinder economic recovery, and health 
and environmental groups claiming that not 
implementing the new limits would result in 
unnecessary illness and death, the Obama 
administration is caught in a difficult political 
position. Whatever the outcome, the debate 
over additional government regulation of the 
environment will no doubt continue well into 
the future.
Thinking Critically 
About Policy
1. The article indicates that the EPA is 
considering a command-and-control 
approach to reducing ozone emissions. 
Explain why this approach may not be 
the most economically efficient solution 
to the pollution problem.
2. Suppose the government decided to im-
pose a “smog tax” in order to reduce 
ozone to its economically efficient level. 
Draw a graph that shows how a smog 
tax could result in an efficient equilibrium 
quantity of the goods that generate smog. 
Make sure to identify the cost of the smog, 
the amount of the tax, the market and effi-
cient prices and quantities, and the prices 
received by the producers and paid by 
consumers with and without the tax.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE: Identify examples of positive and negative externalities and use graphs to show how 
externalities affect economic efficiency.
Summary
An externality is a benefit or cost to parties who are not involved 
in a transaction. Pollution and other externalities in production 
cause a difference between the private cost borne by the producer 
of a good or service and the social cost, which includes any ex-
ternal cost, such as the cost of pollution. An externality in con-
sumption causes a difference between the private benefit received 
by the consumer and the social benefit, which includes any ex-
ternal benefit. If externalities exist in production or consumption, 
the market will not produce the optimal level of a good or service. 
This outcome is referred to as market failure. Externalities arise 
when property rights do not exist or cannot be legally enforced. 
Property rights are the rights individuals or businesses have to the 
exclusive use of their property, including the right to buy or sell it.

Problems and Applications
 
1.6 The chapter states that your consuming a Big Mac does not 
create an externality. But suppose you arrive at your favorite 
McDonald’s at lunchtime and get in a long line to be served. 
By the time you reach the counter, there are 10 people in 
line behind you. Because you decided to have a Big Mac 
for lunch—instead of, say, a pizza—each of those 10 people 
must wait in line an additional 2 minutes. Is it still correct 
to say that your consuming a Big Mac creates no externali-
ties? Might there be a justification here for the government 
to intervene in the market for Big Macs? Briefly explain.
 
1.7 A neighbor’s barking dog can be both a positive external-
ity and a negative externality. Under what circumstances 
would the barking dog serve as a positive externality? Un-
der what circumstances would the barking dog be a nega-
tive externality?
 
1.8 Yellowstone National Park is in bear country. The National 
Park Service, at its Yellowstone Web site, states the follow-
ing about camping and hiking in bear country:
Do not leave packs containing food unat-
tended, even for a few minutes. Allowing a 
bear to obtain human food even once often 
results in the bear becoming aggressive about 
obtaining such food in the future. Aggressive 
bears present a threat to human safety and 
eventually must be destroyed or removed from 
the park. Please obey the law and do not allow 
bears or other wildlife to obtain human food.
 
 What negative externality does obtaining human food 
pose for the bear? What negative externality does the bear’s 
obtaining human food pose for future campers and hikers?

blog post arguing against New York City’s having installed 
bike lanes. Cassidy complained that the bike lanes had elim-

parking. A writer for the Economist magazine disputed Cas-
sidy’s argument by writing: “I hate to belabour the point, but 
driving, as it turns out, is associated with a number of nega-
tive externalities.” What externalities are associated with 
driving? How do these externalities affect the debate over 
whether big cities should install more bike lanes?

 1.12 The following information regarding cable television is 
from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) 
Web site:
In general, a cable television operator has the 
right to select the channels and services that 
are available on its cable system. With the ex-
ception of certain channels like local broadcast 
television channels which are required to be 
carried by federal law, the cable operator has 
broad discretion in choosing which channels 
will be available and how those channels will 
be packaged and marketed to subscribers. . . .  
With the exception of programming that is re-
quired to be carried on the basic tier, the cable 
operator and the entity that owns the channel 
or programming service negotiate the terms 
and conditions for carriage on the cable sys-
tem. Terms may include whether the channel 
or service will be offered in a package with 
other programming or whether the channel or 
service will be offered on a per-channel or pay-
per-view basis.
 
 Suppose you are a fan of The Daily Show with Jon Stewart 
and The Colbert Report, both on the Comedy Central cable 
channel, but the only way you can get Comedy Central 
from your local cable provider is to subscribe to a pack-
age that includes 30 other channels. Is there an externality 
involved here? If so, is it an externality in production or 
consumption, and is it positive or negative? If there is an 
externality, discuss possible solutions.

State University economist JunJie Wu made the following 
observation about the conversion of farmland to urban 
development:
Land use provides many economic and social 
benefits, but often comes at a substantial cost 
to the environment. Although most economic 
costs are figured into land use decisions, most 
environmental externalities are not. These en-
vironmental “externalities” cause a divergence 
between private and social costs for some land 
uses, leading to an inefficient land allocation. 
For example, developers may not bear all the en-
vironmental and infrastructural costs generated 
by their projects. Such “market failures” provide 
a justification for private conservation efforts 
and public land use planning and regulation.
 
 What does the author mean by market failures and ineffi-
cient land allocation? Explain why the author describes in-
efficient land allocation as a market failure. Illustrate your 
argument with a graph showing the market for land to be 
used for urban development.
From JunJie Wu, “Land Use Changes: Economic, Social, and Envi-
ronmental Impacts,” Choices, Vol. 23, No. 4, Fourth Quarter 2008, 
pp. 6–10.
Summary
Externalities and market failures result from incomplete property 
rights or from the difficulty of enforcing property rights in certain 
situations. When an externality exists, and the efficient quantity of 
a good is not being produced, the total cost of reducing the exter-
nality is usually less than the total benefit. According to the Coase 
theorem, if transactions costs are low, private bargaining will re-
sult in an efficient solution to the problem of externalities.

Review Questions
 
2.1 What do economists mean by “an economically efficient 
level of pollution”?
 
2.2 What is the Coase theorem? Why do the parties involved 
in an externality have an incentive to reach an efficient 
solution?
 
2.3 What are transactions costs? When are we likely to see 
 private solutions to the problem of externalities?

2.7 In discussing the reduction of air pollution in the devel-
oping world, Richard Fuller of the Blacksmith Institute, an 
environmental organization, observed, “It’s the 90/10 rule. 
To do 90 percent of the work only costs 10 percent of the 
money. It’s the last 10 percent of the cleanup that costs 90 
percent of the money.” Why should it be any more costly to 
clean up the last 10 percent of polluted air than to clean up 
the first 90 percent? What trade-offs would be involved in 
cleaning up the final 10 percent?

2.8 [Related to the Making the Connection on page 142] In 
the first years following the passage of the Clean Air Act in 
1970, air pollution declined sharply, and there were impor-
tant health benefits, including a decline in infant mortality.

further? How should government go about deciding this 
question?

Briefly explain whether you agree or disagree with the fol-
lowing statement: “Sulfur dioxide emissions cause acid 
rain and breathing difficulties for people with respiratory 
problems. The total benefit to society is greatest if we com-
pletely eliminate sulfur dioxide emissions. Therefore, the 
economically efficient level of emissions is zero.”
 2.10 According to the Coase theorem, why would a steel plant 
that creates air pollution agree to curtail production (and 
therefore pollution) if it were not legally liable for the dam-
age the pollution was causing? Must the property right to 
clean air be assigned to the victims of air pollution to get 
the steel plant to reduce pollution?
 2.11 [Related to the Making the Connection on page 145] 
We know that owners of apple orchards and owners of bee-
hives are able to negotiate private agreements. Is it likely 
that as a result of these private agreements, the market sup-
plies the efficient quantities of apple trees and beehives? 
Are there any real-world difficulties that might stand in 
the way of achieving this efficient outcome?
Summary
When private solutions to externalities are unworkable, the gov-
ernment sometimes intervenes. One way to deal with a nega-
tive externality in production is to impose a tax equal to the cost 
of the externality. The tax causes the producer of the good to in-
ternalize the externality. The government can deal with a positive 
externality in consumption by giving consumers a subsidy, or pay-
ment, equal to the value of the externality. Government taxes and 
subsidies intended to bring about an efficient level of output in 
the presence of externalities are called Pigovian taxes and sub-
sidies. Although the federal government has sometimes used 
subsidies and taxes to deal with externalities, in dealing with pol-
lution it has more often used a command-and-control approach. 
A  command-and-control approach involves the government 
imposing quantitative limits on the amount of pollution allowed 
or requiring firms to install specific pollution control devices. Di-
rect pollution controls of this type are not economically efficient, 
however. As a result, Congress decided to use a system of tradable 
emissions allowances to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions.

3.4 The federal government’s nutrition guidelines urge adults 
to eat at least five cups of fruits and vegetables each day. 
Does consuming fruits and vegetables have a positive ex-

3.5 Many antibiotics that once were effective in eliminating infec-
tions no longer are because bacteria have evolved to become 
resistant to them. Some bacteria are now resistant to all but 
one or two existing antibiotics. Some policymakers have ar-
gued that pharmaceutical companies should receive subsidies 
for developing new antibiotics. A newspaper article states:
While the notion of directly subsidizing drug 
companies may be politically unpopular in 
many quarters, proponents say it is necessary 
to bridge the gap between the high value that 
new antibiotics have for society and the low re-
turns they provide to drug companies.

Four Categories of Goods, pages 153–161
 5.4 
LEARNING OBJECTIVE: Explain how goods can be categorized on the basis of whether they are rival or 
excludable and use graphs to illustrate the efficient quantities of public goods and common resources.
Summary
There are four categories of goods: private goods, public goods, 
quasi-public goods, and common resources. Private goods are 
both rival and excludable. Rivalry means that when one person 
consumes a unit of a good, no one else can consume that unit. 
Excludability means that anyone who does not pay for a good 
cannot consume it. Public goods are both nonrival and nonex-
cludable. Private firms are usually not willing to supply public 
goods because of free riding. Free riding involves benefiting from 
a good without paying for it. Quasi-public goods are excludable 
but not rival. Common resources are rival but not excludable. 
The tragedy of the commons refers to the tendency for a com-
mon resource to be overused. The tragedy of the commons results 
from a lack of clearly defined and enforced property rights. We 
find the market demand curve for a private good by adding the 
quantity of the good demanded by each consumer at each price. 
We find the demand curve for a public good by adding vertically 
the price each consumer would be willing to pay for each quantity 
of the good. The optimal quantity of a public good occurs where 
the demand curve intersects the curve representing the marginal 
cost of supplying the good.

4.7 The more frequently bacteria are exposed to antibiotics, the

ing statement regarding the responsibility of antibiotic users:
Antibiotic resistance is a pressing, global 
health problem. Nearly all significant bacte-
rial infections in the world are becoming resis-
tant to commonly used antibiotics. When you 
abuse antibiotics, the resistant microorganisms 
that you help create can become widely estab-
lished, causing new and hard-to-treat infec-
tions. That’s why the decisions you make about 
antibiotic use—unlike almost any other medi-
cine you take—extend far beyond your reach. 
Responsible antibiotic use protects the health 
of your family, neighbors and ultimately the 
global community.

a common resource.

4.9 Explain whether you agree or disagree with the following 
statement:
Providing health care is obviously a public 
good. If one person becomes ill and doesn’t re-
ceive treatment, that person may infect many 
other people. If many people become ill, then 
the output of the economy will be negatively 
affected. Therefore, providing health care is 
a public good that should be supplied by the 
government.

anyone harvesting a buck with antlers below a certain size 
on land where those clubs have exclusive rights to hunt.

to extinction but not cattle?
 4.12 William Easterly in The White Man’s Burden shares the fol-
lowing account by New York University Professor Leonard 
Wantchekon of how Professor Wantchekon’s village in Be-
nin, Africa, managed the local fishing pond when he was 
growing up:
To open the fishing season, elders performed 
ritual tests at Amlé, a lake fifteen kilometers 
from the village. If the fish were large enough, 
fishing was allowed for two or three days. If 
they were too small, all fishing was forbid-
den, and anyone who secretly fished the lake 
at this time was outcast, excluded from the for-
mal and informal groups that formed the vil-
lage’s social structure. Those who committed 
this breach of trust were often shunned by the 
whole community; no one would speak to the 
offender, or even acknowledge his existence 
for a year or more.
 
 What economic problem were the village elders trying to 
prevent? Do you think their solution would have worked?

number of cars crossing the Golden Gate 
Bridge declined, as commuters switched 
to using busses and ferries. Car dealers 
reported that sales of smaller, more fuel- 
efficient cars were increasing compared 
with sales of SUVs and other less fuel- 
efficient vehicles.
All businesses have a strong interest 
in knowing how much less they will sell as 
prices rise. Governments are also interested 
in knowing how consumers will react if the 
price of a product such as gasoline increases 
following a tax increase. In this chapter, we 
will explore what determines the respon-
siveness of the quantity demanded and the 
quantity supplied to changes in the market 
price.
AN INSIDE LOOK on page 196 dis-
cusses how higher gas prices in 2011 affected 
the spending of households and firms.
Based on Ron Scherer, “Gas Prices Nearing the Point 
Where Americans Cut Back,” Christian Science Monitor, 
April 18, 2011; Motoko Rich and Stephanie Clifford, “In 
Consumer Behavior, Signs of Gas Price Pinch,” New York 
Times, May 17, 2011; and data on gasoline prices and con-
sumption from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
Some people have argued that consumers 
don’t vary the quantity of gas they buy as the 
price changes because the number of miles 
they need to drive to get to work or school 
or to run errands is roughly constant. Dur-
ing the spring and summer of 2011, how-
ever, as the price of gasoline soared close to 
$4.00 per gallon in many parts of the coun-
try, consumers certainly responded. For in-
stance, during May 2011, when the average 
price of gasoline was $3.76, U.S. consumers 
bought about 5 percent less gasoline than 
they had bought during May 2010, when 
the average price of gasoline had been $2.79 
per gallon. According to Dennis  Jacobe, 
chief economist of Gallup, a public opinion 
poll firm, “At $4 a gallon, you get people 
who might have money to spend, but with 
the amount gasoline costs, they start to  
cut back in response to the price. At $4 a 
gallon . . . they make fewer trips.”
Consumers were finding many ways 
to cut back the quantity of gasoline they 
purchased. Some people moved closer to 
where they worked to reduce the miles 
they had to commute. In San Francisco, the

Economics in Your Life
How Much Do Gas Prices Matter to You?
What factors would make you more or less responsive to price when purchasing gasoline? Have you 
responded differently to price changes during different periods of your life? Why do consumers 
seem to respond more to changes in gas prices at a particular service station but seem less sensitive 
when gas prices rise or fall at all service stations? As you read the chapter, see if you can answer 
these questions. You can check your answers against those we provide on page 194 at the end of 
this chapter.

C H A P T E R  6  Elasticity: The Responsiveness of Demand and Supply  
W
hether you are managing a service station, a bookstore, or a coffee shop, 
you need to know how an increase or a decrease in the price of your prod-
ucts will affect the quantity consumers are willing to buy. We saw in Chap-
ter 3 that cutting the price of a good increases the quantity demanded and 
that raising the price reduces the quantity demanded. But the critical question is this: How 
much will the quantity demanded change as a result of a price increase or decrease? Econ-
omists use the concept of elasticity to measure how one economic variable—such as the 
quantity demanded—responds to changes in another economic variable—such as the price. 
For example, the responsiveness of the quantity demanded of a good to changes in its price 
is called the price elasticity of demand. Knowing the price elasticity of demand allows you to 
compute the effect of a price change on the quantity demanded.
We also saw in Chapter 3 that the quantity of a good that consumers demand depends 
not just on the price of the good but also on consumer income and on the prices of related 
goods. As a manager, you would also be interested in measuring the responsiveness of de-
mand to these other factors. As we will see, we can use the concept of elasticity here as well. 
We are also interested in the responsiveness of the quantity supplied of a good to changes in 
its price, which is called the price elasticity of supply.
Elasticity is an important concept not just for business managers but for policymak-
ers as well. If the government wants to discourage teenage smoking, it can raise the price 
of cigarettes by increasing the tax on them. If we know the price elasticity of demand for 
cigarettes, we can calculate how many fewer packs of cigarettes will be demanded at a higher 
price. In this chapter, we will also see how policymakers use the concept of elasticity.
The Price Elasticity of Demand 
and Its Measurement
We know from the law of demand that when the price of a product falls, the quantity 
demanded of the product increases. But the law of demand tells firms only that the de-
mand curves for their products slope downward. More useful is a measure of the re-
sponsiveness of the quantity demanded to a change in price. This measure is called the 
price elasticity of demand.
Measuring the Price Elasticity of Demand
We might measure the price elasticity of demand by using the slope of the demand 
curve because the slope of the demand curve tells us how much quantity changes as 
price changes. Using the slope of the demand curve to measure price elasticity has 
a drawback, however: The measurement of slope is sensitive to the units chosen for 
quantity and price. For example, suppose a $1 per gallon decrease in the price of 
gasoline leads to an increase in the quantity demanded from 10.1 million gallons to  
10.2 million gallons per day. The change in quantity is 0.1 million gallons, and the 
change in price is 2$1, so the slope is  0.1/21 5 20.1. But if we measure price in cents, 
rather than dollars, the slope is 0.1/2100 5 20.001. If we measure price in dollars and 
gallons in thousands, instead of millions, the slope is  100/21 5 2100. Clearly, the 
value we compute for the slope can change dramatically, depending on the units we use 
for quantity and price.
To avoid this confusion over units, economists use percentage changes when mea-
suring the price elasticity of demand. Percentage changes are not dependent on units 
of measurement. (For a review of calculating percentage changes, see the appendix to 
Chapter 1.) No matter what units we use to measure the quantity of gasoline, 10 percent 
more gasoline is 10 percent more gasoline. Therefore, the price elasticity of demand is 
Elasticity A measure of how much 
one economic variable responds to 
changes in another economic variable.

product by the percentage change in 
the product’s price.

 
The Price Elasticity of Demand and Its Measurement  
173
measured by dividing the percentage change in the quantity demanded by the percent-
age change in the price. Or:
Price elasticity of demand = Percentage change in quantity demanded
Percentage change in price
.
It’s important to remember that the price elasticity of demand is not the same as the slope 
of the demand curve.
If we calculate the price elasticity of demand for a price cut, the percentage change 
in price will be negative, and the percentage change in quantity demanded will be pos-
itive. Similarly, if we calculate the price elasticity of demand for a price increase, the 
percentage change in price will be positive, and the percentage change in quantity de-
manded will be negative. Therefore, the price elasticity of demand is always negative. 
In comparing elasticities, though, we are usually interested in their relative size. So, we 
often drop the minus sign and compare their absolute values. In other words, although 
-3 is actually a smaller number than -2, a price elasticity of -3 is larger than a price 
elasticity of -2.
Elastic Demand and Inelastic Demand
If the quantity demanded is very responsive to changes in price, the percentage change 
in quantity demanded will be greater than the percentage change in price, and the price 
elasticity of demand will be greater than 1 in absolute value. In this case, demand is 
elastic. For example, if a 10 percent decrease in the price of bagels results in a 20 percent 
increase in the quantity of bagels demanded, then:
Price elasticity of demand =
20%
-10% = -2,
and we can conclude that the demand for bagels is elastic.
When the quantity demanded is not very responsive to price, however, the percent-
age change in quantity demanded will be less than the percentage change in price, and 
the price elasticity of demand will be less than 1 in absolute value. In this case, demand is 
inelastic. For example, if a 10 percent decrease in the price of wheat results in a 5 percent 
increase in the quantity of wheat demanded, then:
Price elasticity of demand =
5%
-10% = -0.5,
and we can conclude that the demand for wheat is inelastic.
In the special case in which the percentage change in the quantity demanded is 
equal to the percentage change in price, the price elasticity of demand equals -1 (or 1 in 
absolute value). In this case, demand is unit elastic.
An Example of Computing Price Elasticities
Suppose you own a service station, and you are trying to decide whether to cut the price 
you are charging for a gallon of gas. You are currently at point A in Figure 6.1: selling 
1,000 gallons per day at a price of $4.00 per gallon. How many more gallons you will sell 
by cutting the price to $3.70 depends on the price elasticity of demand for gasoline at 
your service station. Let’s consider two possibilities: If D1 is the demand curve for gaso-
line at your station, your sales will increase to 1,200 gallons per day, point B. But if D2 is 
your demand curve, your sales will increase only to 1,050 gallons per day, point C. We 
might expect—correctly, as we will see—that between these points, demand curve D1 is 
elastic, and demand curve D2 is inelastic.
To confirm that D1 is elastic between these points and that D2 is inelastic, we need 
to calculate the price elasticity of demand for each curve. In calculating price elastic-
ity between two points on a demand curve, though, we run into a problem because 
we get a different value for price increases than for price decreases. For example, sup-
pose we calculate the price elasticity for D1 as the price is cut from $4.00 to $3.70. 
Elastic demand Demand is elastic 
when the percentage change in 
quantity demanded is greater than 
the percentage change in price, so 
the price elasticity is greater than 1 in 
absolute value.
Inelastic demand Demand is 
inelastic when the percentage change 
in quantity demanded is less than 
the percentage change in price, so 
the price elasticity is less than 1 in 
absolute value.
Unit-elastic demand Demand is unit 
elastic when the percentage change 
in quantity demanded is equal to the 
percentage change in price, so the 
price elasticity is equal to 1 in absolute 
value.

C H A P T E R  6  Elasticity: The Responsiveness of Demand and Supply  
This reduction is a 7.5 percent price cut that increases the quantity demanded from 
1,000 gallons to 1,200 gallons, or by 20 percent. Therefore, the price elasticity of demand 
between points A and B is 20>-7.5 = -2.7. Now let’s calculate the price elasticity for 
D1 as the price is increased from $3.70 to $4.00. This is an 8.1 percent price increase that 
decreases the quantity demanded from 1,200 gallons to 1,000 gallons, or by 16.7 per-
cent. So, now our measure of the price elasticity of demand between points A and B is 
-16.7>8.1 = -2.1. It can be confusing to have different values for the price elasticity of 
demand between the same two points on the same demand curve. As we will see in the 
next section, to avoid this confusion, economists often use a particular formula when 
calculating elasticities.
The Midpoint Formula
We can use the midpoint formula to ensure that we have only one value of the price 
elasticity of demand between the same two points on a demand curve. The midpoint 
formula uses the average of the initial and final quantities and the initial and final prices. 
If Q1 and P1 are the initial quantity and price and Q2 and P2 are the final quantity and 
price, the midpoint formula is:
Price elasticity of demand = 1Q2 - Q12
a Q1 + Q2
2
b
, 1P2 - P12
a P1 + P2
2
b
.
The midpoint formula may seem challenging at first, but the numerator is just the 
change in quantity divided by the average of the initial and final quantities, and the de-
nominator is just the change in price divided by the average of the initial and final prices.
Let’s apply the formula to calculating the price elasticity of D1 in Figure 6.1. Be-
tween point A and point B on D1, the change in quantity is 200, and the average of 
the two quantities is 1,100. Therefore, there is an 18.2 percent change in quantity. The 
change in price is - +0.30, and the average of the two prices is $3.85. Therefore, there is 
a -7.8 percent change in price. So, the price elasticity of demand is 18.2>-7.8 = -2.3. 
Notice these three results from calculating the price elasticity of demand using the mid-
point formula: First, as we suspected from examining Figure 6.1, demand curve D1 is 
elastic between points A and B. Second, our value for the price elasticity calculated us-
ing the midpoint formula is between the two values we calculated earlier. Third, the 
midpoint formula will give us the same value whether we are moving from the higher 
price to the lower price or from the lower price to the higher price.

Along D1, cutting the price from $4.00 
to $3.70 increases the number of gallons 
sold from 1,000 per day to 1,200 per day, 
so demand is elastic between point A and 
point B. Along D2, cutting the price from 
$4.00 to $3.70 increases the number of gal-
lons sold from 1,000 per day only to 1,050 
per day, so demand is inelastic between 
point A and point C.

 
The Price Elasticity of Demand and Its Measurement  
175
We can also use the midpoint formula to calculate the elasticity of demand between 
point A and point C on D2. In this case, there is a 4.9 percent change in quantity and a 
-7.8 percent change in price. So, the elasticity of demand is 4.9>-7.8 = -0.6. Once 
again, as we suspected, demand curve D2 is price inelastic between points A and C.
Solving the Problem
Step 1: Review the chapter material. This problem requires calculating the price 
elasticity of demand, so you may want to review the material in the section 
“The Midpoint Formula,” which begins on page 174 .
Step 2: To begin using the midpoint formula, calculate the average quantity and 
the average price for demand curve D1.
 Average quantity = 2,000 + 2,500
2
= 2,250
 Average price = +3.50 + +3.30
2
= +3.40
Step 3: Now calculate the percentage change in the quantity demanded and the 
percentage change in price for demand curve D1.
 Percentage change in quantity demanded = 2,500 - 2,000
2,250
* 100 = 22.2%
 Percentage change in price = +3.30 - +3.50
+3.40
* 100 = -5.9%
Solved Problem 6.1
Calculating the Price Elasticity of Demand
Suppose you own a service station, and you are currently sell-
ing gasoline for $3.50 per gallon. At this price you can sell 
2,000 gallons per day. You are considering cutting the price 
to $3.30 to attract drivers who have been buying their gas 
at competing stations. The graph below shows two possible 
 increases in the quantity sold as a result of your price cut. Use 
the information in the graph to calculate the price elasticity 
between these two prices on each of the demand curves. Use 
the midpoint formula in your calculations. State whether each 
demand curve is elastic or inelastic between these two prices.

Step 4: Divide the percentage change in the quantity demanded by the percentage 
change in price to arrive at the price elasticity for demand curve D1.
 Price elasticity of demand = 22.2%
-5.9% = -3.8
 
Because the elasticity is greater than 1 in absolute value, D1 is price elastic be-
tween these two prices.
Step 5: Calculate the price elasticity of demand curve D2 between these two prices.
 Percentage change in quantity demanded = 2,100 - 2,000

Because the elasticity is less than 1 in absolute value, D2 is price inelastic be-
tween these two prices.

When Demand Curves Intersect, 
the Flatter Curve Is More Elastic
Remember that elasticity is not the same thing as slope. While slope is calcu-
lated using changes in quantity and price, elasticity is calculated using percentage 
changes. But it is true that if two demand curves intersect, the one with the smaller 
slope (in absolute value)—the flatter demand curve—is more elastic, and the one 
with the larger slope (in absolute value)—the steeper demand curve—is less elastic. 
In Figure 6.1, for a given change in price, demand curve D1 is more elastic than 
demand curve D2.
Polar Cases of Perfectly Elastic  
and Perfectly Inelastic Demand
Although they do not occur frequently, you should be aware of the extreme, or polar, 
cases of price elasticity. If a demand curve is a vertical line, it is perfectly inelastic. In 
this case, the quantity demanded is completely unresponsive to price, and the price 
elasticity of demand equals zero. No matter how much price may increase or de-
crease, the quantity remains the same. For only a very few products will the quantity 
demanded be completely unresponsive to the price, making the demand curve a ver-
tical line. The drug insulin is an example. Some diabetics must take a certain amount 
of insulin each day. If the price of insulin declines, it will not affect the required dose 
and thus will not increase the quantity demanded. Similarly, a price increase will not 
affect the required dose or decrease the quantity demanded. (Of course, some diabet-
ics who need it will not be able to afford insulin at a higher price. If so, even in this 
case, the demand curve may not be completely vertical and, therefore, not perfectly 
inelastic.)
If a demand curve is a horizontal line, it is perfectly elastic. In this case, the quan-
tity demanded is infinitely responsive to price, and the price elasticity of demand equals 
infinity. If a demand curve is perfectly elastic, an increase in price causes the quantity 
demanded to fall to zero. Once again, perfectly elastic demand curves are rare, and it is 
important not to confuse elastic with perfectly elastic. Table 6.1 summarizes the different 
price elasticities of demand.
Perfectly inelastic demand The 
case where the quantity demanded 
is completely unresponsive to price 
and the price elasticity of demand 
equals zero.
Perfectly elastic demand The case 
where the quantity demanded is 
infinitely responsive to price, and 
the price elasticity of demand equals 
infinity.

C H A P T E R  6  Elasticity: The Responsiveness of Demand and Supply  
The Determinants of the Price Elasticity 
of Demand
We have seen that the demand for some products may be elastic, while the demand for 
other products may be inelastic. In this section, we examine why price elasticities differ 
among products. The key determinants of the price elasticity of demand are as follows:
• 
Availability of close substitutes
• 
Passage of time
• 
Luxuries versus necessities
• 
Definition of the market
• 
Share of the good in the consumer’s budget
Availability of Close Substitutes
The availability of substitutes is the most important determinant of price elasticity of 
demand because how consumers react to a change in the price of a product depends 
on what alternatives they have. When the price of gasoline rises, consumers have few 
6.2 LEARNING OBJECTIVE
Understand the determinants 
of the price elasticity of 
demand.
Don’t Confuse Inelastic with Perfectly 
Inelastic
You may be tempted to simplify the concept of elasticity 
by assuming that any demand curve described as being in-
elastic is perfectly inelastic. You should never assume this 
because perfectly inelastic demand curves are rare. For 
example, consider the following problem: “Use a demand 
and supply graph to show how a decrease in supply affects 
the equilibrium quantity of gasoline. Assume that the de-
mand for gasoline is inelastic.” The following graph would 
be an incorrect answer to this problem.
The demand for gasoline is inelastic, but it is not per-
fectly inelastic. When the price of gasoline rises, the quan-
tity demanded falls. So, the graph that would be the correct 
answer to this problem would show a typical downward-
sloping demand curve rather than a vertical demand curve.

alternatives, so the quantity demanded falls only a little. But if the price of pizza rises, 
consumers have many alternative foods they can eat instead, so the quantity demanded 
is likely to fall substantially. In fact, a key constraint on a firm’s pricing policies is how 
many close substitutes exist for its product. In general, if a product has more substitutes 
available, it will have more elastic demand. If a product has fewer substitutes available, it 
will have less elastic demand.
Passage of Time
It usually takes consumers some time to adjust their buying habits when prices change. 
If the price of chicken falls, for example, it takes a while before consumers decide to 
change from eating chicken for dinner once per week to eating it twice per week. If 
the price of gasoline increases, it also takes a while for consumers to decide to begin 
taking public transportation, to buy more fuel-efficient cars, or to find new jobs closer 
to where they live. The more time that passes, the more elastic the demand for a product 
becomes.
Luxuries versus Necessities
Goods that are luxuries usually have more elastic demand curves than goods that are 
necessities. For example, the demand for bread is inelastic because bread is a necessity, 
and the quantity that people buy is not very dependent on its price. Tickets to a concert 
are a luxury, so the demand for concert tickets is much more elastic than the demand 
for bread. The demand curve for a luxury is more elastic than the demand curve for a 
necessity.
Definition of the Market
In a narrowly defined market, consumers have more substitutes available. For exam-
ple, if you own a service station and raise the price you charge for gasoline, many of 
your customers will switch to buying from a competitor. So, the demand for gasoline 
at one particular station is likely to be elastic. The demand for gasoline as a product, 
on the other hand, is inelastic because consumers have few alternatives (in the short 
run) to buying it. The more narrowly we define a market, the more elastic demand 
will be.
Share of a Good in a Consumer’s Budget
Goods that take only a small fraction of a consumer’s budget tend to have less elastic de-
mand than goods that take a large fraction. For example, most people buy table salt in-
frequently and in relatively small quantities. The share of the average consumer’s budget 
that is spent on salt is very low. As a result, even a doubling of the price of salt is likely to 
result in only a small decline in the quantity of salt demanded. “Big-ticket items,” such 
as houses, cars, and furniture, take up a larger share in the average consumer’s budget. 
Increases in the prices of these goods are likely to result in significant declines in quan-
tity demanded. In general, the demand for a good will be more elastic the larger the share 
of the good in the average consumer’s budget.
Some Estimated Price Elasticities of Demand

Elasticities of Demand
given in the table are consistent with our discussion of the determinants of price elastic-
ity. Goods for which there are few substitutes, such as cigarettes, gasoline, and health 
insurance, are price inelastic, as are broadly defined goods, such as bread or beer. Par-
ticular brands of products, such as Coca-Cola, Tide, or Post Raisin Bran, are price elas-
tic. (This point is discussed further in the Making the Connection on the price elasticity 
of breakfast cereal.)
The table shows that the demand for books or DVDs bought from a particular re-
tailer is typically price elastic. Note, though, that demand for books from Amazon is 
inelastic, which indicates that consumers do not consider ordering from other online 
sites to be good substitutes for ordering from Amazon.
An increase in the price of grapes will lead some consumers to substitute other 
fruits, so demand for grapes is price elastic. Similarly, an increase in the price of new 
automobiles will lead some consumers to buy used automobiles or to continue driv-
ing their current cars, so demand for automobiles is also price elastic. The demand for 
 necessities, such as natural gas and water, is also price inelastic.

 
The Relationship between Price Elasticity of Demand and Total Revenue  
181
The Relationship between Price Elasticity 
of Demand and Total Revenue
A firm is interested in price elasticity because it allows the firm to calculate how changes 
in price will affect its total revenue, which is the total amount of funds it receives from 
selling a good or service. Total revenue is calculated by multiplying price per unit by the 
number of units sold. When demand is inelastic, price and total revenue move in the 
same direction: An increase in price raises total revenue, and a decrease in price reduces 
total revenue. When demand is elastic, price and total revenue move inversely: An in-
crease in price reduces total revenue, and a decrease in price raises total revenue.
To understand the relationship between price elasticity and total revenue, consider 
Figure 6.2. Panel (a) shows a demand curve for gasoline (as in Figure 6.1 on page 174). 
This demand curve is inelastic between point A and point B. The total revenue received 
by the service station owner at point A equals the price of $4.00 multiplied by the 1,000 
gallons sold, or $4,000. This amount equals the areas of the rectangles C and D in the 
figure because together the rectangles have a height of $4.00 and a base of 1,000 gallons. 
Because this demand curve is inelastic between point A and point B (it was demand 
curve D2 in Figure 6.1), cutting the price to $3.70 (point B) reduces total revenue. The

The Price Elasticity of Demand  
for Breakfast Cereal
MIT economist Jerry Hausman has estimated the price elastic-
ity of demand for breakfast cereal. He divided breakfast cere-
als into three categories: children’s cereals, such as Trix and Froot Loops; adult cereals, 
such as Special K and Grape-Nuts; and family cereals, such as Corn Flakes and Raisin 
Bran. Some of the results of his estimates are given in the following table:

All family breakfast cereals

All types of breakfast cereals

Data from Jerry A. Hausman, “Valuation of New Goods under Perfect and Imperfect Competition,” in Timothy F. 
Bresnahan and Robert J. Gordon, eds., The Economics of New Goods, (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 
1997), p. 226.
Just as we would expect, the price elasticity for a particular brand of raisin bran was 
larger in absolute value than the elasticity for all family cereals, and the elasticity for 
all family cereals was larger than the elasticity for all types of breakfast cereals. If Post 
increases the price of its Raisin Bran by 10 percent, sales will decline by 25 percent, as 
many consumers switch to another brand of raisin bran. If the prices of all family break-
fast cereals rise by 10 percent, sales will decline by 18 percent, as consumers switch to 
child or adult cereals. In both of these cases, demand is elastic. But if the prices of all 
types of breakfast cereals rise by 10 percent, sales will decline by only 9 percent. De-
mand for all breakfast cereals is inelastic.

C H A P T E R  6  Elasticity: The Responsiveness of Demand and Supply  
new total revenue is shown by the areas of rectangles D and E and is equal to $3.70 mul-
tiplied by 1,050 gallons, or $3,885. Total revenue falls because the increase in the quan-
tity demanded is not large enough to make up for the decrease in price. As a result, the 
$185 increase in revenue gained as a result of the price cut—dark-green rectangle E—is 
less than the $300 in revenue lost—light-green rectangle C.
Panel (b) of Figure 6.2 shows a demand curve that is elastic between point A and 
point B. (It was demand curve D1 in Figure 6.1.) In this case, cutting the price increases 
total revenue. At point A, the areas of rectangles C and D are still equal to $4,000, but at 
point B, the areas of rectangles D and E are equal to $3.70 multiplied by 1,200 gallons, 
or $4,440. Here, total revenue rises because the increase in the quantity demanded is 
large enough to offset the lower price. As a result, the $740 increase in revenue gained 
as a result of the price cut—dark-green rectangle E—is greater than the $300 in revenue 
lost—light-green rectangle C.
The third, less common possibility is that demand is unit elastic. In that case, a 
small change in price is exactly offset by a proportional change in quantity demanded, 
leaving revenue unaffected. Therefore, when demand is unit elastic, neither a decrease 
in price nor an increase in price affects revenue. Table 6.3 summarizes the relationship 
between price elasticity and revenue.
Elasticity and Revenue with a Linear Demand Curve
Along most demand curves, elasticity is not constant at every point. For example, a straight-
line, or linear, demand curve for gasoline is shown in panel (a) of Figure 6.3. (For simplic-
ity, the quantities used are small.) The numbers from the table are plotted in the graphs. 
The demand curve shows that when the price drops by $1 per gallon, consumers always 
respond by buying 2 more gallons per day. When the price is high and the quantity de-
manded is low, demand is elastic. Demand is elastic because a $1 drop in price is a smaller 
percentage change when the price is high, and an increase of 2 gallons is a larger percentage 
change when the quantity of gasoline purchased is small. By similar reasoning, we can see 
why demand is inelastic when the price is low and the quantity demanded is high.

 Figure 6.2  The Relationship between Price Elasticity and Total Revenue
When demand is inelastic, a cut in price will decrease total revenue. In panel (a), 
at point A, the price is $4.00, 1,000 gallons are sold, and total revenue received by 
the service station equals $4.00 × 1,000 gallons, or $4,000. At point B, cutting the 
price to $3.70 increases the quantity demanded to 1,050 gallons, but the fall in 
price more than offsets the increase in quantity. As a result, revenue falls to $3.70 
× 1,050 gallons, or $3,885. When demand is elastic, a cut in the price will increase 
total revenue. In panel (b), at point A, the area of rectangles C and D is still equal 
to $4,000. But at point B, the area of rectangles D and E is equal to $3.70 × 1,200 
gallons, or $4,440. In this case, the increase in the quantity demanded is large 
enough to offset the fall in price, so total revenue increases.

 Figure 6.3  Elasticity Is Not Constant Along a Linear Demand Curve
The data from the table are plotted in the graphs. Panel (a) shows that as we 
move down the demand curve for gasoline, the price elasticity of demand de-
clines. In other words, at higher prices, demand is elastic, and at lower prices, 
demand is inelastic. Panel (b) shows that as the quantity of gasoline purchased 
increases from 0, revenue will increase until it reaches a maximum of $32 when  
8 gallons are purchased. As purchases increase beyond 8 gallons, revenue falls 
because demand is inelastic on this portion of the demand curve.

184 
C H A P T E R  6  Elasticity: The Responsiveness of Demand and Supply  
Panel (a) in Figure 6.3 shows that when price is between $8 and $4 and quantity 
demanded is between 0 and 8 gallons, demand is elastic. Panel (b) shows that over this 
same range, total revenue will increase as price falls. For example, in panel (a), as price 
falls from $7 to $6, quantity demanded increases from 2 to 4, and in panel (b), total rev-
enue increases from $14 to $24. Similarly, when price is between $4 and 0 and quantity 
demanded is between 8 and 16, demand is inelastic. Over this same range, total revenue 
will decrease as price falls. For example, as price falls from $3 to $2 and quantity de-
manded increases from 10 to 12, total revenue decreases from $30 to $24.
Solving the Problem
Step 1: Review the chapter material. This problem deals with the effect of a price 
change on a firm’s revenue, so you may want to review the section “The Re-
lationship between Price Elasticity of Demand and Total Revenue,” which 
 begins on page 181.
Step 2: Analyze the statement. We have seen that a price increase will increase rev-
enue only if demand is inelastic. In Figure 6.3, for example, increasing the 
price of gasoline from $1 per gallon to $2 per gallon increases revenue from 
$14 to $24 because demand is inelastic along this portion of the demand 
curve. But increasing the price from $5 to $6 decreases revenue from $30 to 
$24 because demand is elastic along this portion of the demand curve. If the 
price is currently $5, increasing revenue would require a price cut, not a price 
increase. As this example shows, the statement is incorrect, and you should 
disagree with it.

Estimating Price Elasticity of Demand
To estimate the price elasticity of demand, a firm needs to know the demand curve for 
its product. For a well-established product, economists can use historical data to statisti-
cally estimate the demand curve. To calculate the price elasticity of demand for a new 
product, firms often rely on market experiments. With market experiments, firms try 
different prices and observe the change in quantity demanded that results.
Determining the Price Elasticity of 
Demand through Market Experiments
Firms usually have a good idea of the price elasticity of de-
mand for products that have been on the market for at least 
a few years. For new products, however, firms often experiment with different prices 
to determine the price elasticity. For example, Apple introduced the first-generation

Other Demand Elasticities
Elasticity is an important concept in economics because it allows us to quantify the 
responsiveness of one economic variable to changes in another economic variable. In 
addition to price elasticity, two other demand elasticities are important: cross-price elas-
ticity of demand and income elasticity of demand.
Cross-Price Elasticity of Demand
Suppose you work at Apple, and you need to predict the effect of an increase in the price 
of Samsung’s Galaxy Tab on the quantity of iPads demanded, holding other factors con-
stant. You can do this by calculating the cross-price elasticity of demand, which is the 
percentage change in the quantity of iPads demanded divided by the percentage change 
in the price of Galaxy Tabs—or, in general:
Cross@price elasticity
of demand
= Percentage change in quantity demanded of one good
Percentage change in price of another good
.
6.4 LEARNING OBJECTIVE
Define cross-price elasticity of 
demand and income elasticity 
of demand and understand 
their determinants and how 
they are measured.
Cross-price elasticity of demand 
The percentage change in quantity 
demanded of one good divided by 
the percentage change in the price of 
another good.
iPhone in June 2007, at a price of $599. But de-
mand for the iPhone was more elastic than Ap-
ple had expected, and when sales failed to reach 
Apple’s projections, the  company cut the price to 
$399 just two months later. Similarly, when 3D 
televisions were introduced into the U.S. market 
in early 2010, Sony and other manufacturers be-
lieved that sales would be strong despite prices 
being several hundred dollars higher than for 
other high-end ultra-thin televisions. Once again, 
though, demand turned out to be more elastic 
than expected, and by December firms were cut-
ting prices 40 percent or more in an effort to in-
crease revenue.
Since electronic books (e-books) became 
popular after Amazon introduced the Kindle e-reader, firms have experimented with 
different prices in trying to determine the relevant price elasticity. Amazon had origi-
nally priced most best selling e-books at $9.99, but when Apple introduced the iPad in 
2010, Apple negotiated contracts with publishers that raised prices for e-books. Amazon 
and Barnes & Noble eventually signed similar contracts, and the prices for best selling 
e-books rose from $9.99 to $12.99 or $14.99. Publishers hoped that a low price elastic-
ity of demand for e-books would result in the price increase leading to higher revenues. 
Many buyers, however, claimed that rather than pay higher prices, they would go back 
to reading printed books. Joel Waldfogel, an economist at the University of Pennsyl-
vania, raised the possibility that the higher prices might lead some readers to illegally 
download pirated e-books, in violation of the publishers’ copyrights. Although piracy 
has been a problem with music and movies, it had not yet been a problem with books. 
Waldfogel argued that, “I would be scared to death about a culture of piracy taking hold. 
I wouldn’t mess around with price increases.” Whether the demand for e-books turns 
out to be elastic or inelastic may depend on how many readers consider printed books 
or pirated e-books to be close substitutes for legally downloaded e-books.

C H A P T E R  6  Elasticity: The Responsiveness of Demand and Supply  
The cross-price elasticity of demand is positive or negative, depending on whether 
the two products are substitutes or complements. Recall that substitutes are products 
that can be used for the same purpose, such as two brands of tablet computers. Comple-
ments are products that are used together, such as tablet computers and applications 
that can be downloaded from online stores. An increase in the price of a substitute will 
lead to an increase in quantity demanded, so the cross-price elasticity of demand will be 
positive. An increase in the price of a complement will lead to a decrease in the quantity 
demanded, so the cross-price elasticity of demand will be negative. Of course, if the two 
products are unrelated—such as tablet computers and peanut butter—the cross-price 
elasticity of demand will be zero. Table 6.4 summarizes the key points concerning the 
cross-price elasticity of demand.
Cross-price elasticity of demand is important to firm managers because it al-
lows them to measure whether products sold by other firms are close substitutes 
for their products. For example, Pepsi-Cola and Coca-Cola spend heavily on ad-
vertising with the hope of convincing consumers that each cola tastes better than 
its rival. How can these firms tell whether or not their advertising campaigns have 
been effective? One way is by seeing whether the cross-price elasticity of demand 
has changed. If, for instance, Coca-Cola has a successful advertising campaign, then 
when it increases the price of Coke, the percentage increase in sales of Pepsi should 
be smaller. In other words, the value of the cross-price elasticity of demand should 
have declined.
Income Elasticity of Demand
The income elasticity of demand measures the responsiveness of quantity demanded 
to changes in income. It is calculated as follows:
Income elasticity of demand = Percentage change in quantity demanded
Percentage change in income
.
As we saw in Chapter 3, if the quantity demanded of a good increases as income 
increases, then the good is a normal good. Normal goods are often further subdivided 
into luxuries and necessities. A good is a luxury if the quantity demanded is very respon-
sive to changes in income, so that a 10 percent increase in income results in more than a  
10 percent increase in quantity demanded. Expensive jewelry and vacation homes are 
examples of luxuries. A good is a necessity if the quantity demanded is not very re-
sponsive to changes in income, so that a 10 percent increase in income results in less 
than a 10 percent increase in quantity demanded. Food and clothing are examples of 
necessities. A good is inferior if the quantity demanded falls when income increases. 
Ground beef with a high fat content is an example of an inferior good. We should note 
that normal good, inferior good, necessity, and luxury are just labels economists use for 
Income elasticity of demand A

goods with different income elasticities; the labels are not intended to be value judg-
ments about the worth of these goods.
Because most goods are normal goods, during periods of economic expan-
sion, when consumer income is rising, most firms can expect—holding other fac-
tors  constant—that the quantity demanded of their products will increase. Sellers of 
luxuries can expect particularly large increases. During recessions, falling consumer 
income can cause firms to experience increases in demand for inferior goods. For 
example, the demand for bus trips increases as consumers cut back on air travel, 
and supermarkets find that the demand for hamburger increases relative to the de-
mand for steak. Table 6.5 summarizes the key points about the income elasticity of 
demand.

cally the following elasticities. (Spirits refers to all beverages that contain alcohol, other 
than beer and wine.)

The demand for beer is inelastic. A 10 percent increase in the price of beer will 
result in a 2.3 percent decline in the quantity of beer demanded. Not surprisingly, both 
wine and spirits are substitutes for beer. A 10 percent increase in the price of wine will 
result in a 3.1 percent increase in the quantity of beer demanded. A 10 percent increase 
in income will result in a little less than a 1 percent decline in the quantity of beer de-
manded. So, beer is an inferior good. Both wine and spirits are categorized as luxuries 
because their income elasticities are greater than 1.

C H A P T E R  6  Elasticity: The Responsiveness of Demand and Supply  
Using Elasticity to Analyze 
the Disappearing Family Farm
The concepts of price elasticity and income elasticity can help us understand many eco-
nomic issues. For example, some people are concerned that the family farm is becom-
ing an endangered species in the United States. Although food production continues 
to grow rapidly, the number of farms and the number of farmers continue to dwindle. 
In 1950, the United States was home to more than 5 million farms, and more than 23 
million people lived on farms. By 2011, only about 2 million farms remained, and fewer 
than 3 million people lived on them. In Chapter 4, we discussed several federal govern-
ment programs designed to aid farmers. Many of these programs have been aimed at 
helping small, family-operated farms, but rapid growth in farm production, combined 
with low price and income elasticities for most food products, has made family farming 
difficult in the United States.
Productivity measures the ability of firms to produce goods and services with a 
given amount of economic inputs, such as workers, machines, and land. Productivity has 
grown very rapidly in U.S. agriculture. In 1950, the average U.S. wheat farmer harvested 
about 17 bushels from each acre of wheat planted. By 2011, because of the develop-
ment of superior strains of wheat and improvements in farming techniques, the average 
American wheat farmer harvested 45 bushels per acre. So, even though the total number 
of acres devoted to growing wheat declined from about 62 million to about 56 million, 
total wheat production rose from about 1.0 billion bushels to about 2.2 billion.
Unfortunately for U.S. farmers, this increase in wheat production resulted in a 
 substantial decline in wheat prices. Two key factors explain this decline: (1) The de-
mand for wheat is inelastic, and (2) the income elasticity of demand for wheat is low. 
Even though the U.S. population has increased greatly since 1950 and the income of 
the average American is much higher than it was in 1950, the demand for wheat has 
increased only moderately. For all of the additional wheat to be sold, the price has had to 
decline. Because the demand for wheat is inelastic, the price decline has been substan-
tial. Figure 6.4 illustrates these points.
A large shift in supply, a small shift in demand, and an inelastic demand curve com-
bined to drive down the price of wheat from $18.56 per bushel in 1950 to $5.70 per 
bushel in 2011. (The 1950 price is measured in terms of prices in 2011, to adjust for 
the general increase in prices since 1950.) With low prices, only the most efficiently 
run farms have been able to remain profitable. Small family-run farms have found it 
difficult to survive, and many of these farms have disappeared. The markets for most

Elasticity and the Disappearing 
Family Farm
In 1950, U.S. farmers produced 1.0 billion 
bushels of wheat at a price of $18.56 per 
bushel. Over the next 60 years, rapid in-
creases in farm productivity caused a large 
shift to the right in the supply curve for 
wheat. The income elasticity of demand 
for wheat is low, so the demand for wheat 
increased relatively little over this period. 
Because the demand for wheat is also inelas-
tic, the large shift in the supply curve and 
the small shift in the demand curve resulted 
in a sharp decline in the price of wheat, 
from $18.56 per bushel in 1950 to $5.70 per 
bushel in 2011.

other food products are similar to the market for wheat. They are characterized by rapid 
output growth and low income and price elasticities. The result is the paradox of Ameri-
can farming: ever more abundant and cheaper food, supplied by fewer and fewer farms. 
American consumers have benefited, but most family farmers have not.
Solving the Problem
Step 1: Review the chapter material. This problem deals with applications of the 
price elasticity of demand formula, so you may want to review the section 
“Measuring the Price Elasticity of Demand,” which begins on page 172.
Step 2: Answer the first question in part (a) using the formula for the price elas-
ticity of demand to calculate the new quantity demanded.
 Price elasticity of demand = Percentage change in quantity demanded
Percentage change in price
.
 
We can plug into the midpoint formula the values given for the price elasticity, 
the original price of $4.00, and the new price of $4.80 1= +4.00 + +0.802:

Solved Problem 6.5
Using Price Elasticity to Analyze a Policy  
of Taxing Gasoline
In Chapter 5, we saw that if the consumption of a prod-
uct results in a negative externality, taxing the product 
may improve economic efficiency. Some economists and 
policymakers argue that driving cars and trucks involves 
a negative externality because burning gasoline increases 
emissions of greenhouse gases and contributes to the con-
gestion that clogs many highways in and around big cities. 
Some economists have suggested substantially increasing 
the federal excise tax on gasoline, which in 2011 was 18.5 
cents per gallon. How much the tax would cause consump-
tion to fall and how much revenue the tax would raise de-
pend on the price elasticity of demand. Suppose that the 
price of gasoline is currently $4.00 per gallon, the quantity 
of gasoline demanded is 140 billion gallons per year, the 
price elasticity of demand for gasoline is -0.06, and the fed-
eral government decides to increase the excise tax on gaso-
line by $1.00 per gallon. We saw in Chapter 4 that the price 
of a product will not rise by the full amount of a tax increase 
unless the demand for the product is perfectly inelastic. In 
this case, suppose that the price of gasoline increases by 
$0.80 per gallon after the $1.00 excise tax is imposed.

ter the tax is imposed? How effective would a gas 
tax be in reducing consumption of gasoline in the 
short run?

C H A P T E R  6  Elasticity: The Responsiveness of Demand and Supply  
The Price Elasticity of Supply 
and Its Measurement
We can use the concept of elasticity to measure the responsiveness of firms to a change 
in price, just as we used it to measure the responsiveness of consumers. We know from 
the law of supply that when the price of a product increases, the quantity supplied in-
creases. To measure how much the quantity supplied increases when price increases, we 
use the price elasticity of supply.
Measuring the Price Elasticity of Supply
Just as with the price elasticity of demand, we calculate the price elasticity of supply by 
using percentage changes:
Price elasticity of supply = Percentage change in quantity supplied
Percentage change in price
.
Notice that because supply curves are upward sloping, the price elasticity of sup-
ply will be a positive number. We categorize the price elasticity of supply the same 
way we categorized the price elasticity of demand: If the price elasticity of supply 
is less than 1, then supply is inelastic. For example, the price elasticity of supply of 
gasoline from U.S. oil refineries is about 0.20, and so it is inelastic; a 10 percent in-
crease in the price of gasoline will result in only a 2 percent increase in the quantity 
supplied. If the price elasticity of supply is greater than 1, then supply is elastic. If the 
price elasticity of supply is equal to 1, the supply is unit elastic. As with other elastic-
ity calculations, when we calculate the price elasticity of supply, we hold constant the 
values of other factors.
Determinants of the Price Elasticity of Supply
Whether supply is elastic or inelastic depends on the ability and willingness of firms 
to alter the quantity they produce as price increases. Often, firms have difficulty in-
creasing the quantity of the product they supply during any short period of time. For 
example, a pizza parlor cannot produce more pizzas on any one night than is possible 
using the ingredients on hand. Within a day or two, it can buy more ingredients, and 
6.6 LEARNING OBJECTIVE
Define price elasticity of supply 
and understand its main 
determinants and how it is 
measured.
price elasticity of supply The 
responsiveness of the quantity 
supplied to a change in price, 
measured by dividing the percentage 
change in the quantity supplied of a 
product by the percentage change in 
the product’s price.
$1.00 per gallon would reduce gasoline consumption by only a small amount:  
from 140 billion gallons of gasoline per year to 138.5 billion gallons. Note, 
though, that price elasticities typically increase over time. Economists estimate 
that the long-run price elasticity of gasoline is in the range of -0.40 to -0.60, 
so in the long run, the decline in the consumption of gasoline would be larger.
Step 4: Calculate the revenue earned by the federal government to answer part 
(b). The federal government would collect an amount equal to the tax per 
gallon multiplied by the number of gallons sold: $1 per gallon × 138.5 billion 
 gallons = $138.5 billion.
Extra Credit: The amount of tax as calculated in Step 4 is substantial: about 15 percent 
of all the revenue the federal government raised from the personal income tax in 2010. 
It is also much larger than the roughly $25 billion the federal government received in 
2011 from the existing 18.5-cents-per-gallon gasoline tax. We can conclude that raising 
the federal excise tax on gasoline would be a good way to raise revenue for the federal 
government, but, at least in the short run, increasing the tax would not greatly reduce the 
quantity of gasoline consumed. Notice that if the demand for gasoline were elastic, this re-
sult would be reversed: The quantity of gasoline consumed would decline much more, but 
so would the revenue that the federal government would receive from the tax increase.

within a few months, it can hire more cooks and install additional ovens. As a result, 
the supply curve for pizza and most other products will be inelastic if we measure it 
over a short period of time, but the supply curve will be increasingly elastic the longer 
the period of time over which we measure it. Products that require resources that are 
themselves in fixed supply are an exception to this rule. For example, a French winery 
may rely on a particular variety of grape. If all the land on which that grape can be 
grown is already planted in vineyards, then the supply of that wine will be inelastic 
even over a long period.
Why Are Oil Prices So Unstable?
Bringing oil to market is a long process. Oil companies hire 
geologists to locate fields for exploratory oil well drilling. If 
significant amounts of oil are present, the company begins 
full-scale development of the field. The process from explora-
tion to pumping significant amounts of oil can take years. This long process is why the 
price elasticity of supply for oil is very low.
During the period from 2003 to mid-2008, the worldwide demand for oil increased 
rapidly as India, China, and some other developing countries increased both their manu-
facturing production and their use of automobiles. As the graph below shows, when sup-
ply is inelastic, an increase in demand can cause a large increase in price. The shift in the 
demand curve from D1 to D2 causes the equilibrium quantity of oil to increase only by 5 
percent, from 80 million barrels per day to 84 million, but the equilibrium price rises by 
75 percent, from $80 per barrel to $140 per barrel.
The world oil market is heavily influenced by the Organization of the Petroleum 
Exporting Countries (OPEC). OPEC has 11 members, including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, 
Iran, Venezuela, and Nigeria. Together OPEC members own 75 percent of the world’s 
proven oil reserves. Periodically, OPEC has attempted to force up the price of oil by re-
ducing the quantity of oil its members supply. As we will discuss further in Chapter 14, 
since the 1970s, OPEC’s attempts to reduce the quantity of oil on world markets have 
been successful only sporadically. As a result, the supply curve for oil shifts fairly fre-
quently. Combined with the low price elasticities of oil supply and demand, these shifts 
in supply have caused the price of oil to fluctuate significantly over the past 30 years, 
from as low as $10 per barrel to more than $140 per barrel.

C H A P T E R  6  Elasticity: The Responsiveness of Demand and Supply  
Polar Cases of Perfectly Elastic and Perfectly 
Inelastic Supply
Although it occurs infrequently, it is possible for supply to fall into one of the polar cases 
of price elasticity. If a supply curve is a vertical line, it is perfectly inelastic. In this case, 
the quantity supplied is completely unresponsive to price, and the price elasticity of sup-
ply equals zero. Regardless of how much price may increase or decrease, the quantity 
remains the same. Over a brief period of time, the supply of some goods and services 
may be perfectly inelastic. For example, a parking lot may have only a fixed number of 
parking spaces. If demand increases, the price to park in the lot may rise, but no more 
spaces will become available. Of course, if demand increases permanently, over a longer 
period of time, the owner of the lot may buy more land and add additional spaces.
If a supply curve is a horizontal line, it is perfectly elastic. In this case, the quantity 
supplied is infinitely responsive to price, and the price elasticity of supply equals infin-
ity. If a supply curve is perfectly elastic, a very small increase in price causes a very large 
increase in quantity supplied. Just as with demand curves, it is important not to confuse 
a supply curve being elastic with its being perfectly elastic and not to confuse a supply 
curve being inelastic with its being perfectly inelastic. Table 6.6 summarizes the differ-
ent price elasticities of supply.
Using Price Elasticity of Supply  
to Predict Changes in Price
Figure 6.5 illustrates the important point that, when demand increases, the amount by 
which price increases depends on the price elasticity of supply. The figure shows the de-
mand and supply for parking spaces at a beach resort. In panel (a), on a typical summer 
Beginning in mid-2008, the financial crisis that had begun in the United States had 
spread to other countries, resulting in a severe recession. As production and incomes fell 
during the recession, the worldwide demand for oil declined sharply. Over the space of 
a few months, the equilibrium price of oil fell from $140 per barrel to $40 per barrel. As 
the graph below shows, once again, the extent of the price change reflected not only the 
size of the decline in demand but also oil’s low price elasticity of supply.

weekend, equilibrium occurs at point A, where DemandTypical intersects a supply curve 
that is inelastic. The increase in demand for parking spaces on the Fourth of July shifts the 
demand curve to the right, moving the equilibrium to point B. Because the supply curve is 
inelastic, the increase in demand results in a large increase in price—from $2.00 per hour 
to $4.00—but only a small increase in the quantity of spaces supplied—from 1,200 to 1,400.
In panel (b), supply is elastic, perhaps because the resort has vacant land that can be 
used for parking during periods of high demand. As a result, the change in equilibrium 
from point A to point B results in a smaller increase in price and a larger increase in 
the quantity supplied. An increase in price from $2.00 per hour to $2.50 is sufficient to 
increase the quantity of parking spaces supplied from 1,200 to 2,100. Knowing the price 
elasticity of supply makes it possible to predict more accurately how much price will 
change following an increase or a decrease in demand.

Economics in Your Life
How Much Do Gas Prices Matter to You?
At the beginning of the chapter, we asked you to think about three questions: What factors would 
make you more or less sensitive to price when purchasing gasoline? Have you responded differ-
ently to price changes during different periods of your life? and Why do consumers seem to re-
spond more to changes in gas prices at a particular service station but seem less sensitive when 
gas prices rise or fall at all service stations? A number of factors are likely to affect your sensitivity 
to changes in gas prices, including how high your income is (and, therefore, how large a share 
of your budget is taken up by gasoline purchases), whether you live in an area with good public 
transportation (which can be a substitute for having to use your own car), and whether you live 
within walking distance of your school or job. Each of these factors may change over the course of 
your life, making you more or less sensitive to changes in gas prices. Finally, consumers respond to 
changes in the price of gas at a particular service station because gas at other service stations is a 
good substitute. But there are presently few good substitutes for gasoline as a product.

Conclusion
In this chapter, we have explored the important concept of elasticity. Table 6.7 summa-
rizes the various elasticities we discussed. Computing elasticities is important in econom-
ics because it allows us to measure how one variable changes in response to changes in 
another variable. For example, by calculating the price elasticity of demand for its prod-
uct, a firm can make a quantitative estimate of the effect of a price change on the revenue 
it receives. Similarly, by calculating the price elasticity of demand for cigarettes, the gov-
ernment can better estimate the effect of an increase in cigarette taxes on smoking.
Before going further in analyzing how firms decide on the prices to charge and the 
quantities to produce, we need to look at how firms are organized. We do this in the next 
chapter. Read An Inside Look on the next page for a discussion of the effect of higher gas 
prices on  consumer and business spending.

know that gas prices are going to con-
tinue to challenge people.”
 New reports from Goldman 
Sachs and the International Energy 
Agency were the triggers for Tuesday’s 
$3.67-a-barrel drop in the price on the 
New York Mercantile Exchange, where 
a barrel of the U.S. benchmark West 
Texas Intermediate closed at $106.25.
Oil prices above $100 will hurt the 
recovery, the IEA report said. “Eco-
nomic impacts from high prices are 
never instantaneous, and often take 
months to materialize, but preliminary 
data for early 2011 already show signs 
of oil demand slowdown,” the IEA re-
port said. “Unfortunately, the surest 
remedy for high prices may ultimately 
prove to be high prices themselves.”
Fears of continued Middle East 
unrest and the possibility that supply 
disruptions could spread beyond Libya 
have driven up the price of Brent crude, 
another key oil benchmark that is used 
by about two-thirds of the world, from 
$100 a barrel in mid-February to $125 
a barrel last Friday, a level not seen 
since May of the record-setting 2008. 
Yet inventories and spare production 
capacity are bigger this year than they 
were then, Goldman noted. . . .

that escalating prices are beginning to 
threaten the global economic recovery.
But Morici and other economists 
say the pullback may only provide 
temporary relief at the pump and that 
higher prices could be here to stay.
Gasoline prices peaked in July 
2008, when a gallon of regular sold for 
an average of $4.11 nationally. Some 
analysts fear prices could again ap-
proach that level in the near future, 
since demand for gasoline generally 
rises in the warm-weather months.
 Nearly three-quarters of Ameri-
cans says higher prices could slow their 
spending in other areas in the months 
ahead, according to a Deloitte survey 
of consumers’ spending intentions. . . .
Already, motorists are cutting 
back on driving because of the in-
creasing prices. “We are seeing some 
deterioration in U.S. motor gasoline 
demand . . . as pump prices near $3.75 
a gallon,” which is when demand got 
soft in 2008, said David Greely, an 
analyst at Goldman Sachs. “As the 
market moves to higher prices, the 
likelihood that you’re going to weaken 
demand increases.”
Bill Simon, chief executive of Wal-
Mart U.S., said recently that the retailer 
sees fewer customers when gas prices 
begin to rise, because its mammoth 
stores are typically farther away than 
local grocery and convenience stores.
But as the spike continues, cus-
tomers begin consolidating  shopping 
trips and are more likely to visit just 
Wal-Mart instead of a handful of 
smaller retailers, Simon said. “We 
$4-a-Gallon Gas 
Fueling Fears for 
Recovery
Gasoline prices are soaring toward $4 
a gallon, a threshold that some ana-
lysts say will damage the fragile eco-
nomic recovery and crimp consumer 
spending just as families are planning 
their summer vacations.
 Higher prices saddle businesses 
with higher transportation costs, 
causing them to either swallow them 
or pass them along to already strapped 
customers. As gasoline costs go up, 
consumers are left with less money 
to spend elsewhere. And there is evi-
dence that the hike at the pump is be-
ginning to push drivers off the road.
Gasoline prices, which are ap-
proaching record levels, “are going 
to have a very profound effect on the 
economy,” said Peter Morici, an econ-
omist at the University of Maryland.
D.C. resident Amber Sutton, who 
drives 25 miles each way to her job 
in Woodbridge, said rising gasoline 
prices have caused her to cut back on 
restaurants and other entertainment.
“I already was spending a ton on 
gas,” she said. “But now it’s absolutely 
ridiculous. . . .”
Prices have risen so high, so fast 
that some market analysts predicted 
a sell-off in the short term. That sen-
timent sent crude oil prices tumbling

day, dragging stock markets down 
about 1 percent, as evidence grew

may have to initially cut back on other pur-
chases, but as time passes, they may also 
be able to decrease their dependence on 
gasoline. The ultimate effect of a rise in gas-
oline prices is difficult to predict. The unpre-
dictability of prices by itself has the potential 
of slowing the economy down, which indi-
cates how important changes in gasoline 
prices can be for an economy.
Thinking Critically
1. Joe Ferris owns Joe’s Gas-and-Go ser-
vice station. Joe reads a newspaper ar-
ticle in which an economist describes the 
demand for gasoline as price inelastic. 
Remembering his principles of econom-
ics course from college, Joe comes to the 
following conclusion: “Because the de-
mand for gasoline is inelastic, if I increase 
the price I charge, I will lose a few cus-
tomers, but the price increase will more 
than compensate for the fact that I will 
be selling a smaller quantity of gasoline. 
Therefore, the revenue I earn from gaso-
line sales will increase.” Briefly explain 
whether you agree with Joe’s reasoning.
2. Suppose that initially the only sellers 
of gasoline in a town are conventional 
service stations. Then Wal-Mart and 
Costco decide to begin selling gaso-
line. They install service islands near 
their stores and sell gasoline for lower 
prices than the conventional service 
stations. What effect do these new 
gasoline sellers have on the demand 
curves faced by the conventional ser-
vice stations?
demanded, and spending less on other 
goods represents consumers devoting 
more of their budget to gasoline purchases.
b A survey of planned consumer spending 
indicates that nearly 75 percent of Ameri-
can consumers may reduce spending on 
other products if gas prices continue to rise. 
Also likely is a change in the demand for gas-
oline. As time passes, if increasing gas prices 
persist, consumers will be better able to ad-
just their lifestyles to a point where they do not 
need to purchase as much gasoline as they 
used to. This change could materialize in sev-
eral ways, including people moving closer to 
work or public transportation; people tele-
commuting for their jobs; and people pur-
chasing more fuel-efficient vehicles. The more 
time that passes, the more elastic the demand 
for a product becomes. The figure below illus-
trates the effect of price elasticity increasing 
over time. Suppose that initially the price  
of gasoline is $3.00 per gallon, and Q1 gallons 
of gasoline are being purchased. If the price of 
gasoline increases to $5.00 per gallon, then at 
first consumers will move up the demand 
curve, DShort run, and the quantity of gasoline 
demanded will decline to Q2. But if high gaso-
line prices persist, the demand for gasoline 
will become more elastic 1DLong run2. As de-
mand becomes more elastic over the longer 
time period, the quantity of gasoline de-
manded will decline further, to Q3. 
c It can take time for households and 
firms to respond fully to a rise in gasoline 
prices. Businesses may try holding off on 
raising prices due to increases in transporta-
tion cost but may ultimately find it in their 
best interest to raise prices. Households 
Key Points in the Article
Rapidly increasing prices for crude oil dur-
ing the first quarter of 2011 translated into 
higher prices at the gas pump. Businesses 
with higher transportation costs must either 
absorb these higher prices or pass them 
along to customers in the form of higher 
product prices. For households, higher gas 
prices have resulted in a reduction in driving 
as well as a shift in spending patterns. As 
gas prices have risen, consumers have cut 
back on other forms of spending because 
they are using a larger portion of their bud-
gets for fuel expenses. Analysts are con-
cerned that the higher costs to businesses 
and cuts in consumer spending could be 
detrimental to the economic recovery, and 
the overall effect of the higher gas prices 
may take months to become evident in the 
economy.
Analyzing the News
a The demand for gasoline is inelastic, 
so when price increases by a certain 
percentage, the quantity demanded will de-
crease by a smaller percentage. Therefore, 
as the price of gasoline increases, a larger 
portion of the average consumer’s budget 
will be devoted to purchasing gasoline, 
even though the quantity demanded will 
decrease. The article indicates that as gas-
oline prices increase, consumers are not 
only cutting back on driving, but they also 
have less money to spend on other prod-
ucts. This illustrates the inelasticity of de-
mand for gasoline because the reduction in 
driving represents the decrease in quantity

LEARNING OBJECTIVE: Define price elasticity of demand and understand how to measure it.
Summary
Elasticity measures how much one economic variable responds 
to changes in another economic variable. The price elasticity 
of demand measures how responsive quantity demanded is to 
changes in price. The price elasticity of demand is equal to the 
percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the per-
centage change in price. If the quantity demanded changes more 
than proportionally when price changes, the price elasticity of 
demand is greater than 1 in absolute value, and demand is elas-
tic. If the quantity demanded changes less than proportionally 
when price changes, the price elasticity of demand is less than 
1 in absolute value, and demand is inelastic. If the quantity de-
manded changes proportionally when price changes, the price 
elasticity of demand is equal to 1 in absolute value, and demand 
is unit elastic. Perfectly inelastic demand curves are vertical 
lines, and perfectly elastic demand curves are horizontal lines. 
Relatively few products have perfectly elastic or perfectly inelas-
tic demand curves.

plain. (Hint: Remember that a firm’s revenue is equal to the 
price of the product multiplied by the quantity sold.)
Summary
The main determinants of the price elasticity of demand for 
a product are the availability of close substitutes, the passage of 
time, whether the good is a necessity or a luxury, how narrowly 
the market for the good is defined, and the share of the good in 
the consumer’s budget.

One study found that the price elasticity of demand for soda 
is -0.78, while the price elasticity of demand for Coca-Cola 
is -1.22. Coca-Cola is a type of soda, so why isn’t its price 
elasticity the same as the price elasticity for soda as a product?

Summary
Total revenue is the total amount of funds received by a seller of a 
good or service. When demand is inelastic, a decrease in price reduces 
total revenue, and an increase in price increases total revenue. When 
demand is elastic, a decrease in price increases total revenue, and an 
increase in price decreases total revenue. When demand is unit elas-
tic, an increase or a decrease in price leaves total revenue unchanged.

Problems and Applications
 
3.3 Economists’ estimates of price elasticities can differ some-
what, depending on the time period and on the markets in 
which the price and quantity data used in the estimates were 
gathered. An article in the New York Times contained the fol-
lowing statement from the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention: “A 10 percent increase in the price of cigarettes 
reduces consumption by 3 percent to 5 percent.” Given this 
information, compute the range of price elasticity of demand 
for cigarettes. Explain whether the demand for cigarettes is 
elastic, inelastic, or unit elastic. If cigarette manufacturers raise 
prices, will their revenue increase or decrease? Briefly explain.

Chapter Summary and Problems 
201
A publisher may have issued a monograph 
several years ago, when both costs and book 
prices were lower, and priced it at $19.95. 
The book is still selling reasonably well and 
would continue to do so even at $29.95. Why 
not, then, raise the price? The only danger is 
miscalculation: By raising the price you may 
reduce sales to the point where you make 
less money overall, even while making more 
per copy.
 
 Assume that the situation described in the last sentence 
happens. What does this tell us about the price elasticity of 
demand for that book? Briefly explain.

a day . . . fewer cars used the Big Blue Deck compared to 
the previous year. . . . Still, the move at the North Ter-
minal structure brought in about $61,000 more than the  
previous  December.” Use the information in the follow-

parking spaces at the Big Blue Deck, using the midpoint 
formula. Assume that nothing happened between De-
cember 2007 and December 2008 to shift the demand 
curve for parking places. Be sure to state whether de-
mand is elastic or inelastic.

Summary
In addition to the elasticities already discussed, other important de-
mand elasticities are the cross-price elasticity of demand, which is 
equal to the percentage change in quantity demanded of one good di-
vided by the percentage change in the price of another good, and the 
income elasticity of demand, which is equal to the percentage change 
in the quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in income.

4.6 [Related to the Chapter Opener on page 171] During 
the spring of 2008, gasoline prices increased sharply in the 
United States. According to a newspaper article, rising gas 
prices had the following impact in the car market:
Sales of Toyota’s subcompact Yaris increased 
46 percent, and Honda’s tiny Fit had a record 
month. Ford’s compact Focus model jumped 
32 percent in April from a year earlier. All 
those models are rated at more than 30 miles 
per gallon for highway driving. . . .
Summary
Price elasticity and income elasticity can be used to analyze many 
economic issues. One example is the disappearance of the family 
farm in the United States. Because the income elasticity of demand 
for food is low, the demand for food has not increased proportion-
ally as incomes in the United States have grown. As farmers have 
become more productive, they have increased the supply of most 
foods. Because the price elasticity of demand for food is low, in-
creasing supply has resulted in continually falling food prices.

5.4 Corruption has been a significant problem in Iraq. Opening 
and running a business in Iraq usually requires paying mul-
tiple bribes to government officials. We can think of there be-
ing a demand and supply for bribes, with the curves having 
the usual shapes: The demand for bribes will be downward 
sloping because the smaller the bribe, the more business 
owners will be willing to pay it. The supply of bribes will be 
upward sloping because the larger the bribe, the more gov-
ernment officials will be willing to run the risk of breaking 
the law by accepting the bribe. Suppose that the Iraqi gov-
ernment introduces a new policy to reduce corruption that 
raises the cost to officials of accepting bribes—perhaps by 
increasing the jail term for accepting a bribe. As a result, the 
supply curve for bribes will shift to the left. If we measure the 
burden on the economy from corruption by the total value of 
the bribes paid, what must be true of the demand for bribes 
if the government policy is to be effective? Illustrate your an-
swer with a demand and supply graph. Be sure to show on 
your graph the areas representing the burden of corruption 
before and after the government policy is enacted.

pay us any other subsidy. Because the demand 
for kumquats is elastic, I believe this program will 
make us worse off, and I say we should oppose it.

5.6 Review the concept of economic efficiency from Chapter 4 
before answering the following question: Will there be 
a greater loss of economic efficiency from a price ceiling 
when demand is elastic or inelastic? Illustrate your answer 
with a demand and supply graph.
Summary
The price elasticity of supply is equal to the percentage change in 
quantity supplied divided by the percentage change in price. The 
supply curves for most goods are inelastic over a short period of 
time, but they become increasingly elastic over longer periods of 
time. Perfectly inelastic supply curves are vertical lines, and per-
fectly elastic supply curves are horizontal lines. Relatively few 
products have perfectly elastic or perfectly inelastic supply curves.

Review Questions
 
6.1 Write the formula for the price elasticity of supply. If an 
increase of 10 percent in the price of frozen pizzas results 
in a 9 percent increase in the quantity of frozen pizzas 
 supplied, what is the price elasticity of supply for frozen 
pizzas? Is the supply of pizzas elastic or inelastic?
 
6.2 What is the main determinant of the price elasticity of supply?
Problems and Applications
 
6.3 [Related to the Making the Connection on page 191] 
 Refer again to the first graph in the Making the Connec-
tion on page 191. Suppose that demand had stayed at the 
level indicated in the graph, with the equilibrium price of 
oil remaining at $140 per barrel. Over long periods of time, 
high oil prices lead to greater increases in the quantity of 
oil supplied. In other words, the price elasticity of sup-
ply for oil increases. This happens because higher prices  
provide an economic incentive to recover oil from more 
costly sources, such as under the oceans, from tar sands, or 
at greater depths in the earth. If the supply of oil becomes 
more elastic, explain how the increase in demand shown in 
the figure will result in a lower equilibrium price than $140 
per barrel and a higher equilibrium quantity than 84 mil-
lion barrels per day. Illustrate your answer with a demand 
and supply graph.
 
6.4 Use the midpoint formula for calculating elasticity to cal-
culate the price elasticity of supply between point A and 
point B for each panel of Figure 6.5 on page 194.
 
6.5 Briefly explain whether you agree with the following state-
ment: “The longer the period of time following an increase

6.6 Consider an increase in the demand for petroleum engineers 
in the United States. How would the supply of these engineers

price jumps.
 
b. Based on this information, what do we know about the

Why Is It Difficult for People Who Are Seriously Ill to Buy Health Insurance?
If you become ill and don’t have health insurance, you are likely to be stuck paying large medical 
bills. Even a brief stay in a hospital can result in a bill of thousands of dollars. You may conclude that 
people with chronic illnesses are most likely to buy health insurance to help reduce their medical 
bills. But if you are chronically ill and don’t currently have health insurance, buying it can be very 
difficult. Usually, people who demand a service can easily find a provider of that service. So, why is 
it difficult for people who are seriously ill to buy health insurance? As you read the chapter, see if 
you can answer this question. You can check your answer against the one we provide on page 229 
at the end of this chapter.
increase from 5.6 percent of GDP in 2011 
to nearly 12 percent in 2050. If governments 
do not reduce spending on these programs, 
they will have to sharply increase taxes or 
 reduce spending on other programs.
In 2010, President Obama and Con-
gress enacted the Patient Protection and 
Affordable Care Act, which made major 
changes to the U.S. health care system. The 
changes are being phased in through 2014. 
Included in the act is a provision for each 
state to set up health insurance exchanges 
to make health insurance less expensive for 
small businesses and  individuals by allowing 
them to enter an insurance pool where both 
healthy and sick people will be in the same 
insurance plan and pay the same  insurance 
premium. In 2011, economists and policy-
makers debated whether the health insur-
ance exchanges would succeed in lowering 
health care premiums for small businesses 
and individuals.
AN INSIDE LOOK AT POLICY on 
page 230 discusses government projections 
of future health care costs.
Based on Judith Messina, “Small Businesses Wary 
on Health Insurance Exchange,” www.crainsnewyork.

cyclers,” New York Times, October 21, 2007; “Antique

Medicaid Studies, “National Health Expenditure Data;” and 
U.S. Congressional Budget Office, “CBO’s 2011 Long-Term 
Budget Outlook,” June 2011.
Elizabeth Crowell and her husband, Robert  
Wilson, own two antique stores in Brooklyn,  
New York. Like other small business owners, 
they face various challenges as they compete 
with the many similar stores in their area. 
But in 2011, Elizabeth and Robert were most 
concerned with paying Empire Blue Cross 
for health insurance for their family and 
their employees. In 2010, the premium—the 
payment a firm or an individual makes to 
buy health insurance—increased by 20 per-
cent, and in 2011, the premium increased by 
25 percent. Elizabeth said that: “It’s the only 
cost in my business that’s unmanageable. . . . 
If you have a cost to a business that jumps 
20% to 25% a year, it’s unsustainable.”
Elizabeth and Robert were not alone in 
worrying about escalating health care costs. 
For several decades, health care spending has 
been steadily increasing as a fraction of gross 
domestic product (GDP), which is the value 
of the total production of goods and ser-
vices in the economy. Health care spending 
 increased from 5.2 percent of GDP in 1960 
to 17.5 percent in 2011, an upward trend that 
is expected to continue. The federal govern-
ment provides medical insurance to people 
aged 65 and older under the Medicare pro-
gram, and the federal and state governments 
provide medical insurance to low-income 
people under the Medicaid program. The

ealth care refers to the goods and services, such as prescription drugs and con-
sultations with a doctor, that are intended to maintain or improve a person’s 
health. Improvements in health care are an important part of the tremendous 
increase in living standards people in the United States and other high-income 
countries have experienced over the past 100 years. Health care has seen rapid technological 
change with new products, such as MRI units and other diagnostic equipment; prescription 
drugs to treat cancer, high blood pressure, and AIDS; vaccinations for meningitis; and new 
surgical techniques, such as cardiac catheterizations for treatment of heart disease.
Health care is provided through markets, just as are most other goods and services 
such as hamburgers or haircuts. So, we can apply the tools of economic analysis we used 
in previous chapters to health care. But the market for health care has interesting features 
that make it different from other markets. In the United States, the doctors and hospitals 
that supply most health care are primarily private firms, but the government also provides 
some health care services directly through the Veterans Health Administration, which 
is part of the U.S.  Department of Veterans Affairs. The government also provides health 
care indirectly through the Medicare and Medicaid programs. In addition to having a large 
 government role, the market for health care differs from most markets in other ways. Most 
importantly, the typical consumer of health care doesn’t pay its full price. Most people 
 either have private medical insurance—most often provided through their employer—or 
they are enrolled in the Medicare or Medicaid programs. Consumers who have insurance 
make different  decisions about the quantity of health care they wish to consume than they 
would if they were paying the full cost of the services they receive. As we will see, to analyze 
the market for health care we will need to use economic tools beyond those introduced 
in previous chapters. We begin our analysis of health care with an overview of health care 
around the world.
The Improving Health of People 
in the United States
Two hundred years ago, the whole world was very poor by modern standards. Today, 
the average person in high-income countries has a standard of living well beyond what 
even the richest people in the past could have dreamed of. One aspect of this higher 
standard of living is the improved health the average person enjoys. For example, in 
the late 1700s, England had the highest level of income per person of any large country. 
But the average person in England had a short life span and suffered from diseases, 
such as cholera, yellow fever, dysentery, and smallpox, that have disappeared from 
high-income countries today. The average life expectancy at birth was only 38 years, 
and 30 percent of the population died before reaching the age of 30. Even people who 
survived to age 20 could only expect to live an average of 34 more years. In 2011, the 
average life expectancy at birth in the United Kingdom and other high-income coun-
tries was around 80 years. People in eighteenth century England were also short by 
modern standards. The average height of an adult male was 5 feet, 5 inches compared 
with 5 feet, 9 inches today.
In this section, we discuss the health of the average person in the United States. 
In section 7.2, we discuss the health of people in other countries.
Changes over Time in U.S. Health
When economists measure changes over time in the standard of living in a country, they 
usually look first at increases in income per person. Changes in the health of the average 
person, though, are also an important indicator of changes in well-being and, therefore,

changes in the standard of living. The health of the average person in the United States 
improved significantly during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and, by and large, 
it continues to improve today.
Table 7.1 compares some indicators of health in the United States in 1850 and 2011. 
Individuals in the United States today are taller, they live much longer, and they are 
much less likely to die in the first months of life than was true 150 years ago.
The Rise and Fall and Rise  
of American Heights
A person’s height relies partly on genetics—that is, tall parents tend to have tall 
 children—but also on a person’s nutritional status. Nutritional status depends on a per-
son’s food intake relative to the work the person has to perform, whether the person is 
able to remain warm in cold weather, and the diseases to which the person is exposed. 
Over time, people in high-income countries have, on average, become taller, just as 
people in high-income countries today are taller than people in low-income countries. 
Height, then, can be used as a measure of health and well-being in situations when other 
direct measures may not be available.
Take the case of the United States: Figure 7.1 shows changes in the average height 
of adult males born in the given years in the United States between 1710–1970, mea-
sured in centimeters. The trend has been upward, except for the period from 1830–
1890, when the average adult male became about two inches shorter. This decline in 
height did not occur because incomes were falling  during these years and people had 
to reduce their food purchases. Quite the opposite: The income of the average person 
in the United States was almost three times greater in 1890 than it had been in 1830. 
Instead, the nutritional status of the average person deteriorated as people moved 
from farms to cities. At that time, a lack of refrigeration made distributing meat and 
dairy products difficult in cities, so many people did not consume enough protein. 
More importantly, U.S. cities were very unhealthy places in the late nineteenth century. 
Most cities lacked basic sanitation, including sewers, clean drinking water, and regular 
garbage removal. People often dumped garbage into the streets and left it to rot. Not 
surprisingly, cities suffered from periodic epidemics of diseases such as cholera, dysen-
tery, scarlet fever, diphtheria, and yellow fever that are largely unknown in the modern 
United States. The widespread acceptance in the late nineteenth century that diseases 
were caused by bacteria helped lead to the public health movement in the late nine-
teenth and early twentieth centuries, which eventually brought sewers, clean drinking 
water, and regular garbage removal to all U.S. cities. The improvement in sanitary con-
ditions in cities and improvements in food distribution caused the increases in height 
that began around 1890. So, changes in the height of the average American over time 
can give us insight into health and well-being that we could not obtain by looking only 
at income.

Reasons for Long-Run Improvements 
in U.S. Health
Apart from the temporary setback in the mid-nineteenth century, the health of people 
in the United States has steadily improved, with heights and life expectancies increas-
ing and death rates decreasing. Panel (a) of Figure 7.2 shows the increase in life expec-
tancy from 1900 to 2009 and the decline in the mortality rate, or death rate, measured 
as deaths per 100,000 people for the same years. Note that the mortality rate is “age 
 adjusted,” which means that it is not affected by changes in the age structure of the 
population. Life expectancy at birth in the United States increased from 47.3 years in 
1900 to 78.2 years in 2009. Panel (b) in Figure 7.2 shows for recent years the change 
in the overall mortality rate of the U.S. population, measured as deaths per 100,000 
people, and the age-adjusted mortality rates for several diseases. The overall mortality

limited distribution of food, particularly pro-

Since 1900, life expectancy in the United States has increased and mortality rates 
have decreased. Since 1981, there have been significant decreases in rates of death 
due to cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and diseases of the liver. Rates of death due to 
kidney disease and diabetes increased slightly due to an increase in obesity. Note that 
in panel (a), the increase in mortality and decrease in life expectancy in 1918 are due 
to the severe influenza epidemic of that year.

rate decreased by more than 25 percent between 1981 and 2009. Over this same period, 
deaths from cancer, from cardiovascular disease, such as heart attacks and strokes, and 
from diseases of the liver all declined substantially. Deaths from diabetes and from 
kidney disease both increased slightly during this period, largely due to the effects of 
increasing obesity. The overall decline in death rates in the United States since 1981, 
was due to changes in lifestyle, particularly a decline in smoking, and advances in new 
diagnostic equipment, new prescription drugs, and new surgical techniques.
What explains the long-run increases in life expectancy and declines in death rates? 
We have already seen that improvements in sanitation and in the distribution of food 
during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries led to better health during that 
period. Nobel Laureate Robert Fogel of the University of Chicago and Roderick Floud of 
Gresham College, along with coauthors, have described a process by which better health 
makes it possible for people to work harder as they become taller, stronger, and more 
resistant to disease. Working harder raises a country’s total income, making it possible 
for the country to afford better sanitation, more food, and a better system for distribut-
ing the food. In effect, improving health shifts out a country’s production possibilities 
frontier. Higher incomes also allow the country to devote more resources to research 
and development, including medical research.
Health Care around the World
In the United States, most health care is provided by private firms, either through doc-
tors’ practices or hospitals. The main exception is the care the government provides 
through the network of hospitals operated by the federal government’s Veterans Admin-
istration, although some cities also own and operate hospitals. Governments in most 
countries outside of the United States have a more substantial direct role in paying for or 
providing health care. Policymakers and economists debate the effects of greater govern-
ment involvement in the health care system on health outcomes such as life expectancy, 
infant mortality, and successful treatment of diseases.
The U.S. Health Care System
One important difference among health care systems in different countries is how peo-
ple pay for the health care they receive. Most people in the United States have health in-
surance that helps them to pay their medical bills. Health insurance is a contract under 
which a buyer agrees to make payments, or premiums, in exchange for the provider’s 
agreeing to pay some or all of the buyer’s medical bills. Figure 7.3 shows the sources of 
health insurance in the United States in 2009. About 54 percent of people have private 
health insurance. Most people who have private health insurance receive it through their 
employer. In 2010, about 99 percent of firms employing more than 200 workers and

about 68 percent of firms employing between 3 and 199 workers offered health insur-
ance as a fringe benefit (that is, a type of non-wage compensation) to their employees.  
Private health insurance companies can be either not-for-profit firms, such as some of 
the Blue Cross and Blue Shield organizations, or for-profit firms, such as Aetna and John 
 Hancock, which typically also sell other types of insurance. Private health insurance 
firms sell group plans to employers to cover all of their employees or individual plans 
directly to the public. Some health insurance plans reimburse doctors and hospitals on a 
 fee-for-service basis, which means that doctors and hospitals receive a payment for each 
service they provide. Other health insurance plans are organized as health maintenance 
organizations (HMOs), which typically reimburse doctors mainly by paying a flat fee per 
patient, rather than paying a fee for each individual office visit or other service provided.
In 2009, 29 percent of people received health insurance either through Medicare, 
Medicaid, the Veterans Administration, or through some other government program. 
Seventeen percent of people were not covered by health insurance in 2009. Many peo-
ple lack health insurance because their incomes are low, and they believe they cannot 
afford to buy private health insurance. Some low-income people either do not qualify 
for Medicaid or they choose not to participate in that program. About two-thirds of the 
uninsured live in families where at least one member has a job. These individuals either 
were not offered health insurance through their employers or chose not to purchase it. 
Some young people opt out of employer-provided health insurance because they are 
healthy and do not believe that the cost of the premium their employer charges for the 
insurance is worth the benefit of having the insurance. In 2009, 57 percent of the unin-
sured were younger than 34. Although 99 percent of firms with 200 or more employees 
offer health insurance to their employees, only about 63 percent of employees accept 
the coverage. The remaining employees are either covered by a spouse’s policy or have 
decided to go uninsured because they do not want to pay the premium for the insur-
ance. The uninsured must pay for their own medical bills out-of-pocket, with money 
from their own income, just as they pay their other bills, or receive care from doctors 
or hospitals either free or below the normal price. As we will see, addressing the prob-
lems of the uninsured was one of the motivations for the federal government’s health 
care legislation enacted in 2010.
The Health Care Systems of Canada, Japan,  
and the United Kingdom
In many countries, such as Canada, Japan, and the United Kingdom, the government 
either supplies health care directly by operating hospitals and employing doctors and 
nurses, or pays for most health care expenses, even if hospitals are not government 
owned and doctors are not government employees. In this section, we look briefly at the 
health care system in several countries.
Canada Canada has a single-payer health care system in which the government provides 
national health insurance to all Canadian residents. Each of the 10 Canadian provinces has 
its own system, although each system must meet the federal government’s requirement of 
covering 100 percent of all medically necessary medical procedures. Individuals pay noth-
ing for doctor’s visits or hospital stays; instead they pay for medical care indirectly through 
the taxes they pay to the provincial and federal governments. As in the United States, most 
doctors and hospitals are private businesses, but unlike in the United States, doctors and 
hospitals are required to accept the fees that are set by the government. Also as in the United 
States, doctors and hospitals are typically reimbursed on a fee-for-service basis.
Japan Japan has a system of universal health insurance under which every resident of 
the country is required to either (a) enroll in one of the many non-profit health insurance 
societies that are organized by industry or profession, or (b) enroll in the health insurance 
program provided by the national government. The system is funded by a combination of 
premiums paid by employees and firms and a payroll tax similar to the tax that funds the 
Medicare program in the United States. Unlike the Canadian system, the Japanese system

they provide.

Health Care around the World

requires substantial co-payments under which patients pay as much as 30 percent of their 
medical bills, while health insurance pays for the rest. Japanese health insurance does not 
pay for most preventive care, such as annual physical exams, or for medical expenses con-
nected with pregnancies, unless complications result. Health insurance in the United States 
and Canada typically does cover these expenses. As in the United States, most doctors in 
Japan do not work for the government and there are many privately owned hospitals. The 
number of government-run hospitals, though, is greater than in the United States.
The United Kingdom In the United Kingdom the government, through the 
 National Health Service (NHS), owns nearly all hospitals and directly employs nearly all 
doctors. This is unlike in the United States, Canada, and Japan, where the government 
employs relatively few doctors and owns relatively few hospitals. Because there is only a 
small system of private insurance and private hospitals in the United Kingdom, its health 
care system is often referred to as socialized medicine. With 1.7 million employees, the 
NHS is the largest government-run health care system in the world. Apart from a small 
co-payment for prescriptions, the NHS supplies health care services without charge to 
patients, receiving its funding from income taxes. The NHS concentrates on preventive 
care and care for acute conditions. Elective care—such as hip replacements or recon-
structive surgery following a mastectomy—is a low priority. The NHS’s goals result in  
waiting lists for elective procedures that can be very long, with patients sometimes wait-
ing a year or more for a procedure that would be available in a few weeks or less in the 
United States. To avoid the waiting lists, more than 10 percent of the population also has 
private health insurance, frequently provided by employers, which the insured use to 
pay for elective procedures. The NHS essentially trades off broader coverage for longer 
waiting times and performing fewer procedures, particularly non-emergency surgeries.
Comparing Health Care Outcomes  
around the World
We have seen that the way health care systems are organized varies significantly across 
countries. Health care outcomes and the amounts countries spend on health care are also 
quite different. As Figure 7.4 shows, typically, the higher the level of income per person in 
a country, the higher the level of spending per person on health care. This is not surpris-
ing, because health care is a normal good. As we saw in Chapter 3, as income increases, 
so does spending on normal goods. The line in the figure shows the average relation-
ship between income per person and health care spending per person. The dots for most 
countries are fairly close to the line, but note that the dot representing the United States is 
significantly above the line. Being well above the line indicates that health care spending

per person in the United States is higher than in other countries, even taking into ac-
count the relatively high income levels in the United States. Later in this chapter, we will 
discuss explanations for the high levels of health care spending in the United States.
Have the high levels of spending on health care in the United States resulted in 
better health outcomes? Are people in the United States healthier, and do they have 
their medical problems addressed more rapidly than do people in the other coun-
tries? Table 7.2  compares several health care outcomes for the countries that are 
members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), 
a group of 34 high-income countries. The table shows that the United States does 
relatively poorly in terms of life expectancy at birth, and infant mortality, although 
it does about average with respect to life expectancy of women and men at age 65. 
People in the United States are more likely to have complications from  diabetes and 
are also more likely to be obese than are people in other countries,  although these 
data are from surveys asking people whether they are obese and are not  direct mea-
surements of obesity. The obesity data are also available for a relatively few countries.
The United States rates well in the availability of medical equipment that can be 
used in diagnosing and treating illness. Table 7.2 shows that the United States has 
more than twice as many MRI units and CT scanners than the OECD average. The 
United States also appears to do well in cancer treatment. People in the United States 
have a lower rate of cancer deaths and a lower probability of dying from cancer be-
fore age 75 than in most OECD countries, although higher than in Japan. The United 
States also has a relatively low mortality ratio from cancer. The mortality ratio mea-
sures the rate at which people die from cancer relative to the rate at which they are 
diagnosed with cancer. A low cancer mortality ratio indicates that the U.S. health care

How useful are cross-country comparisons of health care outcomes in measur-
ing the effectiveness of different health care systems? Health economists and other re-
searchers disagree strongly about the answer to this question. We can consider some of 
the difficulties in making cross-country comparisons in health care outcomes:
• 
Data problems. Countries do not always collect data on diseases and other health 
problems in the same way. So, there are not enough consistent data available to 
compare health care outcomes for more than a few diseases.
• 
Problems with measuring health care delivery. The easiest outcomes to measure 
are deaths because a specific event has occurred. So, measures of life expectancy, in-
fant mortality, and mortality rates from some diseases, such as cancer, are available 
across countries. But much of health care involves care of injuries, simple  surgical 
procedures, writing pharmaceutical prescriptions, and other activities where out-
comes are difficult to measure. For example, although the United Kingdom does 
well in many of the measures shown in Table 7.2, patients there have long waiting 
times for elective surgical procedures that can be arranged much more quickly in 
some other countries, including the United States. Measuring the cost of these wait-
ing times to patients is difficult, however.
• 
Problems with distinguishing health care effectiveness from lifestyle choices. Health 
care outcomes depend partly on the effectiveness of doctors and hospitals in 
 delivering medical services. But they also depend on the choices of individuals. So, 
for example, in the United States the high rates of obesity and hospitalizations for 
diabetes— which can be a complication of obesity—may be caused more by the deci-
sions individuals make about diet and exercise than by the effectiveness of the U.S. 
health care system.
• 
Problems with determining consumer preferences. In most markets, we can as-
sume that the quantities and prices we observe reflect the interactions of the pref-
erences of consumers (demand) with the costs to firms of producing goods and 
services (supply). Given their incomes and their preferences, consumers compare 
the prices of different goods and services when making their buying decisions. The 
prices firms charge represent the costs of providing the good or service. In the mar-
ket for health care, however, the government plays the dominant role in supplying 
the service in most countries other than the United States, so the cost of the service 
is not fully represented in its price, which in some countries is zero. Even in coun-
tries where consumers must pay for medical services, the prices they pay usually do 
not represent the cost of providing the service. In the United States, for instance, 
consumers with private health insurance typically pay only 10 percent to 20 percent 
of the price as a co-payment. For these reasons, it is difficult to determine whether 
some countries do a better job than others in providing health care services whose 
cost and effectiveness are consistent with consumer preferences.
Information Problems and Externalities 
in the Market for Health Care
The market for health care is significantly affected by the problem of asymmetric infor-
mation, which occurs when one party to an economic transaction has less information 
than the other party. Understanding the concept of asymmetric information can help us 
analyze the actions of buyers and sellers of health care and health care insurance and the 
actions of the government in the health care market. The consequences of asymmetric 
information may be easier to understand if we first consider its effect on the market for 
used automobiles, which was the market in which economists first began to carefully 
study the problem of asymmetric information.

C H A P T E R  7  The Economics of Health Care 
Adverse Selection and the Market for “Lemons”
Nobel Laureate George Akerlof, of the University of California, Berkeley, pointed out 
that the seller of a used car will always have more information on the true condition 
of the car than will potential buyers. A car that has been poorly maintained—by, for 
instance, not having its oil changed regularly—may have damage that even a trained 
mechanic would have difficulty detecting.
If potential buyers of used cars know that they will have difficulty separating the 
good used cars from the bad used cars, or “lemons,” they will take this into account in 
the prices they are willing to pay. Consider the following simple example: Suppose that 
half of the 2010 Volkswagen Jettas offered for sale have been well maintained and are 
good, reliable used cars. The other half have been poorly maintained and are lemons 
that will be unreliable. Suppose that potential buyers of 2010 Jettas would be willing to 
pay $10,000 for a reliable one but only $5,000 for an unreliable one. The sellers know 
how well they have maintained their cars and whether they are reliable, but the buyers 
do not have this information and so have no way of telling the reliable cars from the 
unreliable ones.
In this situation, buyers will generally offer a price somewhere between the price 
they would be willing to pay for a good car and the price they would be willing to pay 
for a lemon. In this case, with a 50–50 chance of buying a good car or a lemon, buyers 
might offer $7,500, which is halfway between the price they would pay if they knew for 
certain the car was a good one and the price they would pay if they knew it was a lemon.
Unfortunately for used car buyers, a major glitch arises at this point. From the 
 buyers’ perspective, given that they don’t know whether any particular car offered for 
sale is a good car or a lemon, an offer of $7,500 seems reasonable. But the sellers do know 
whether the cars they are offering are good cars or lemons. To a seller of a good car, an 
offer of $7,500 is $2,500 below the true value of the car, and the seller will be  reluctant to 
sell. But to a seller of a lemon, an offer of $7,500 is $2,500 above the true value of the car, 
and the seller will be quite happy to sell. As sellers of lemons take  advantage of knowing 
more about the cars they are selling than buyers do, the used car market will fall victim 
to adverse selection: Most used cars offered for sale will be lemons. In other words, 
because of asymmetric information, the market has selected adversely the cars that will 
be offered for sale. Notice as well that the problem of adverse selection reduces the total 
quantity of used cars bought and sold in the market because few good cars are offered 
for sale.
Asymmetric Information in the Market  
for Health Insurance
Asymmetric information problems are particularly severe in the markets for all types of 
insurance, including health care insurance. To understand this point, first consider how 
insurance works. Insurance companies provide the service of risk pooling when they 
sell policies to households. For example, if you own a $150,000 house but do not have 
a fire insurance policy, a fire that destroys your house can be a financial catastrophe. 
But an insurance company can pool the risk of your house burning down by selling fire 
insurance policies to you and thousands of other homeowners. Homeowners are will-
ing to pay the certain cost represented by the premium they pay for insurance in return 
for eliminating the uncertain—but potentially very large—cost should their house burn 
down. Notice that for the insurance company to cover all of its costs, the total amount 
it receives in premiums must be greater than the amount it pays out in claims to policy-
holders. To survive, insurance companies have to predict accurately the amount they are 
likely to pay out to policyholders. For instance, if an insurance company predicts that 
the houses of only 2 percent of policyholders will burn down during a year when 5 per-
cent of houses actually burn down, the company will suffer losses. On the other hand, 
if the company predicts that 8 percent of houses will burn down when only 5 percent 
actually do, the company will have charged premiums that are too high. A company that 
charges premiums that are too high will lose customers to other companies and may 
eventually be driven out of business.
Adverse selection The situation in 
which one party to a transaction takes 
advantage of knowing more than the 
other party to the transaction.

 
Information Problems and Externalities in the Market for Health Care  
215
Adverse Selection in the Market for Health Insurance One obstacle to health 
insurance companies accurately predicting the number of claims policyholders will 
make is that buyers of health insurance policies always know more about the state of 
their health—and, therefore, how likely they are to submit medical bills for payment—
than will the insurance companies. In other words, insurance companies face an adverse 
selection problem because sick people are more likely to want health insurance than are 
healthy people. If insurance companies have trouble determining who is healthy and 
who is sick, they will end up setting their premiums too low and will fail to cover their 
costs. An insurance company that finds that the premiums it is charging are too low to 
cover the costs of the claims being submitted faces a problem. The company might try 
to increase the premiums it charges, but this runs the risk of making the adverse selec-
tion problem worse. If premiums rise, then younger, healthier people who rarely visit 
the doctor or have to be hospitalized may respond to the increase in premiums by drop-
ping their insurance. The insurance company will then find its adverse selection prob-
lem has been made worse because its policyholders will be less healthy on average than 
they were before the premium increase. The situation is similar to that facing a used car 
buyer who knows that adverse selection is a problem in the used car market and decides 
to compensate for it by lowering the price he is willing to pay for a car. The lower price 
will reduce the number of sellers of good cars willing to sell to him, making his adverse 
selection problem worse.
One controversial way to deal with the problem of adverse selection is to require 
individuals to buy health insurance. Most states require drivers to buy automobile 
 insurance, so that both high-risk and low-risk drivers will carry insurance. The Patient 
Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) passed in 2010 requires that beginning 
in 2014 residents of the United States must carry insurance or pay a fine. This provi-
sion of the law is known as the individual mandate. We discuss it further later in the 
chapter.
Moral Hazard in the Market for Health Insurance The insurance market is 
subject to a second consequence of asymmetric information. Moral hazard refers to 
actions people take after they have entered into a transaction that make the other party 
to the transaction worse off. Moral hazard in the insurance market occurs when people 
change their behavior after becoming insured. For example, once a firm has taken out a 
fire insurance policy on a warehouse, it might be reluctant to install an expensive sprin-
kler system. Similarly, someone with health insurance may visit the doctor for treatment 
of a cold or other minor illness, when he would not do so without the insurance. Or 
someone with health insurance might engage in risky activities, such as riding a motor-
cycle, that she would avoid if she lacked insurance.
One way to think about the basic moral hazard problem with insurance is to note 
that normally there are two parties to an economic transaction: the buyer and the seller. 
The insurance company becomes a third party to the purchase of medical  services 
 because the insurance company, rather than the patient, pays for some or all of the 
 service. For this reason, economists refer to traditional health insurance as a third-party 
payer system. The third-party payer system means that consumers of health care do 
not pay a price that reflects the full cost of providing the service. This lower price leads 
 consumers to use more health care than they otherwise would.
Third-party payer health insurance can also lead to another consequence of moral 
hazard known as the principal–agent problem because doctors may be led to take 
 actions that are not necessarily in the best interests of their patients, such as prescrib-
ing  unnecessary tests or other treatments. The principal–agent problem results from 
agents—in this case, doctors—pursuing their own interests rather than the interests 
of the  principals—in this case, patients—who hired them. If patients had to pay the 
full price of lab tests, MRI scans, and other procedures, they would be more likely to 
question whether the procedures were really necessary. Because health insurance pays 
most of the bill for these procedures, patients are more likely to accept them. Note 
that the fee-for-service aspect of most health insurance can make the principal–agent 
problem worse because doctors and hospitals are paid for each service performed,

Don’t Confuse Adverse Selection  
with Moral Hazard
The two key consequences of asymmetric information are 
adverse selection and moral hazard. It is easy to get these 
concepts mixed up. One way to keep the concepts straight is 
to remember that adverse selection refers to what happens 
at the time of entering into the transaction. An example 
would be an insurance company that sells a life  insurance 
policy to a terminally ill person  because the company lacks 
full information on the person’s health. Moral hazard  refers 
to what happens after entering into the transaction. For 
 example, a nonsmoker buys a life  insurance policy and 
then starts smoking four packs of cigarettes a day. (It may 
help to remember that a comes before m in the alphabet 
just as adverse selection comes before moral hazard.)

Don’t Let This Happen to You
whether or not the service was effective. Many doctors argue that the increasing 
number of medical procedures is not the result of third-party payer health insurance. 
 Instead the increase reflects the improved effectiveness of the procedures in diagnos-
ing illness and the tendency of some doctors to practice “defensive medicine” because 
they fear that if they fail to diagnose an illness, a patient may file a malpractice lawsuit 
against them.
How Insurance Companies Deal with Adverse Selection and Moral  Hazard 
Insurance companies can take steps to reduce adverse selection and moral hazard 
problems. For example, insurance companies can use deductibles and coinsurance to 
reduce moral hazard. A deductible requires the policyholder to pay a certain  dollar 
amount of a claim. With coinsurance, the insurance company pays only a percentage 
of any claim. Suppose you have a health insurance policy with a $200 deductible and 
20 percent coinsurance, and you have a medical bill of $1,000. You must pay the first 
$200 of the bill and 20 percent of the remaining $800. Deductibles and coinsurance 
make the policies less attractive to people who intend to file many claims, thereby 
reducing the adverse selection problem. Deductibles and coinsurance also provide 
policyholders  with an incentive to avoid filing claims, thereby reducing the moral 
hazard problem. Notice, though, that deductibles and coinsurance reduce, but do not 
eliminate, adverse selection and moral hazard. People who anticipate having large 
medical bills will still have a greater incentive than healthy people to buy insurance, 
and people with health insurance are still more likely to file claims than are people 
without health insurance.
To reduce the problem of adverse selection, someone applying for an individual 
health insurance policy is usually required to submit his or her medical records to the 
insurance company. Insurance companies usually also carry out their own medical ex-
aminations. Companies have often limited coverage of pre-existing conditions, which are 
medical problems, such as heart disease or cancer, that the buyer already has before pur-
chasing the insurance. The limits that health insurance companies placed on pre- existing  
conditions typically lasted for one or two years or, occasionally, were permanent. Lim-
its on pre-existing conditions have been very common in health insurance   policies for 
individuals, but were also sometimes included in group policies, such as the policies 
companies sell to businesses providing coverage to their employees. Exclusions and lim-
its on coverage of pre-existing conditions have been controversial. Critics argue that by  
excluding coverage of pre-existing conditions, insurance companies were forcing peo-
ple with serious illnesses to pay the entire amount of what might be very large medi-
cal bills or to go without medical care. Some people with chronic or terminal illnesses 
found it impossible to buy an individual health insurance policy. The insurance compa-
nies argue that if they do not exclude coverage of pre-existing conditions, then  adverse

 selection problems might make it difficult to offer any health insurance policies or 
might force the companies to charge premiums that are so high as to cause relatively 
healthy people to not renew their policies, which would make adverse selection prob-
lems worse. To some extent, the debate over coverage of pre-existing conditions is a 
normative one. Ordinarily, in a market system, people who cannot afford a good or 
service must do without it. Many people, though, are reluctant to see people not have 
access to health insurance because they cannot afford it. As we will discuss in the next 
section, the  Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act passed by Congress in 2010 
 included significant restrictions on the ability of insurance companies to limit coverage 
of pre-existing conditions.
Solving the Problem
Step 1: Review the chapter material. This problem is about adverse selection, so you 
may want to review the section “Problems of Adverse Selection in the Market 
for Health Insurance,” which appears on page 215, and the section “How In-
surance Companies Deal with Problems of Adverse Selection and Moral Haz-
ard,” which begins on page 216.
Step 2: Answer part a. by defining adverse selection and explaining how the con-
cept applies in this example. Adverse selection is the situation in which one 
party to a transaction takes advantage of knowing more than the other party 
to the transaction. In this example, Off Your Desk runs the risk of attracting a 
disproportionate number of customers who have extensive paperwork needs 
that will cost the company more than $65 per month to process.
Step 3: Answer part b. by explaining how the firm might deal with the prob-
lem of adverse selection. The firm has strategies available: It could restrict 
its service to only covering bills its customers receive after they sign up. 
This strategy would reduce adverse selection by limiting the attractiveness  
of the service to customers who already had complicated billing questions 
that they needed help with and that would be likely to cost more than $65 per 
month to resolve. The strategy would be similar to health insurance plans that 
exclude coverage of patients’ pre-existing conditions. The firm could also put 
a limit on the number of bills that it would process for the flat fee of $65. That 
strategy would avoid attracting customers who anticipate having many bills. 
In fact, Off Your Desk uses both strategies: It does not cover bills customers 
received before signing up for the service, and it will only cover the paper-
work involved with 10 medical claims over a three-month period.

Dealing with Adverse Selection
Private health insurance that has deductibles and 
 co-payments can generate a lot of paper work for patients: 
insurance companies send patients statements indicating 
how much they owe doctors, doctors send bills asking for 
payment, and disagreements arise over which treatments are 
eligible for insurance. In 2011, the company Off Your Desk 
was offering consumers a service that would handle all the 
paperwork involved with health insurance for a fee of $65 per 
month. A newspaper article on the service noted that: “Still,

C H A P T E R  7  The Economics of Health Care 
Externalities in the Market for Health Care
For most goods and services, we assume that the consumer receives all the benefits from 
consuming the good and that the firm producing the good bears all of the costs of pro-
duction. Some goods or services, though, involve an externality, which is a benefit or 
cost that affects someone who is not directly involved in the production or consumption 
of a good or service. For example, if a utility burns coal to produce electricity, the result 
will be air pollution, which causes a negative externality because people with asthma or 
other breathing problems may bear a cost even though they were not involved in buy-
ing or selling the electricity that caused the pollution. College education may result in 
a positive externality because college-educated people are less likely to commit crimes 
and, by being better-informed voters, more likely to contribute to better government 
policies. So, although you receive most of the benefits of your college education, other 
people also receive some of the benefits.
Externalities interfere with the economic efficiency of a market equilibrium. We 
saw in Chapter 4 that a competitive market achieves economic efficiency by maximiz-
ing the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus. But when there is a negative 
externality in production, as with air pollution, the market will produce more than the 
efficient quantity. When there is a positive externality in consumption, as with college 
educations, the market will produce less than the efficient quantity. (A more complete 
discussion of externalities appears in Chapter 5, “Externalities, Environmental Policy, 
and Public Goods.”)
Are there externalities involved with medicine and health care? There are several 
aspects of health care that many economists believe involve externalities. For example, 
anyone vaccinated against a communicable disease protects not just himself or herself 
but also reduces the chances that people who have not been vaccinated will contract the 
disease. There is some debate over whether obesity may involve a negative externality. 
People who are obese are more likely to suffer from heart disease, diabetes, or other 
medical problems. Obesity may involve an externality because people who are not obese 
may pay for some of the health care costs obese people incur.
Economists and policymakers debate whether the existence of externalities requires 
significant government involvement in health care.
Should the Government Run  
the Health Care System?
During the debate over President Barack Obama’s health 
care plan during 2009 and 2010, some members of Congress 
proposed expanding the federal government’s role in health care by adopting a system 
similar to the single-payer system used in Canada under which the government would 
provide health care to all residents of the United States. What role the federal govern-
ment should play in health care remains a controversial public policy issue.
Economists categorize goods on the basis of whether they are rival and excludable. 
Rivalry occurs when one person’s consuming a unit of a good means no one else can 
consume it. If you consume a taco, for example, no one else can consume it. Excludabil-
ity means that anyone who does not pay for a good cannot consume it. If you don’t pay 
for a taco, for example, Taco Bell can exclude you from consuming it. A public good is 
both nonrival and nonexcludable. Public goods are often, although not always, supplied 
by a government rather than by private firms. The classic example of a public good is 
national defense. Your consuming national defense does not interfere with your neigh-
bor’s consuming it, so consumption is nonrivalrous. You also cannot be excluded from 
consuming it, whether you pay for it or not. No private firm would be willing to supply 
national defense because everyone can consume national defense without paying for it.
Is health care a public good that government should supply—or, at least, pay for? 
Is it a private good, like furniture, clothing, or computers, that private firms should

supply and consumers should pay for without government 
aid? Should private firms supply most health care, subject to 
some government regulation? Economists differ in their an-
swers to these questions because the delivery of health care 
involves a number of complex issues, but we can consider 
briefly some of the most important points. Because public 
goods are both nonrivalrous and nonexcludable, health care 
does not qualify as a public good under the usual definition. 
More than one person cannot simultaneously consume the 
same surgical operation, for example. And someone who 
will not pay for an operation can be excluded from consum-
ing it. (Most states require hospitals to treat patients who are 
too poor to pay for treatment, and many doctors will treat 
poor people at a reduced price. But because there is nothing 
in the nature of health care that keeps people who do not pay 
for it from being excluded from consuming it, health care 
does not fit the definition of a public good.)
There are aspects of the delivery of health care that have convinced some econ-
omists that government intervention is justified, however. For example, consuming 
certain types of health care generates positive externalities. Being vaccinated against a 
communicable disease, such as influenza or meningitis, not only reduces the chance 
that the person vaccinated will catch the disease but also reduces the probability that 
an epidemic of the disease will occur. Therefore, the market may supply an  inefficiently 
small quantity of vaccinations unless vaccinations receive a government subsidy.
Information problems can also be important in the market for private health insur-
ance. Consumers as buyers of health insurance often know much more about the state 
of their health than do the companies selling health insurance. This information prob-
lem may raise costs to insurance companies when the pool of people being insured is 
small, making insurance companies less willing to offer health insurance to  consumers 
the companies suspect may file too many claims. Economists debate how important in-
formation problems are in health care markets and whether government intervention is 
required to reduce them.
Many economists believe that market-based solutions are the best approach to im-
proving the health care system. As we saw in Table 7.2 on page 212, the United States has 
a mixed rec ord with respect to health care outcomes. The United States is, however, a 
world leader in innovation in medical technology and prescription drugs. The market- 
oriented  approach to reforming health care starts with the goal of improving health 
care outcomes while preserving incentives for U.S. firms to continue with innovations 
in medical screening equipment, surgical procedures, and prescription drugs. Presently, 
markets are delivering inaccurate signals to consumers because when buying health care, 
unlike when buying most other goods and services, consumers pay a price well below 
the true cost of providing the service. Under current tax laws, individuals do not pay 
taxes on health insurance benefits they receive from their employers, and this encour-
ages them to want very generous coverage that reduces incentives to control costs. As we 
will discuss later in the chapter, market-based approaches to health care reform attempt 
to address these issues.
It remains an open question whether the U.S. health care system will continue to 
move toward greater government intervention, which is the approach adopted in most 
other countries, or whether market-based reforms will be implemented. Because health 
care is so important to consumers and because health care spending looms so large in 
the U.S. economy, the role of the government in the health care system is likely to be the 
subject of intense debate for some time to come.

The Debate over Health Care Policy 
in the United States
Shortly after taking office in January 2009, President Barack Obama proposed far-
reaching changes in the U.S. health care system. The result was the Patient Protection 
and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), which Congress passed in March 2010. The act was 
controversial, with every Republican member of Congress and 34 Democratic members 
of Congress voting against it. Economists vigorously debated its likely effects on health 
care and the economy. In the next section, we explore the issue of rising health care 
costs, which played an important role in the health care debate, before discussing the 
details of the PPACA and the debate over the legislation’s effect.
The Rising Cost of Health Care
Figure 7.5 illustrates a key fact underlying the debate over health care policy in the 
United States: Health care’s share of gross domestic product, which is the total value of 
output in the economy, is increasing. Panel (a) shows that spending on health care was 
less than 6 percent of GDP in 1965, but had risen to about 17.5 percent in 2011, and was 
projected to rise to about 19.5 percent in 2019. In other words, an increasing percentage 
of total production in the United States is being devoted to health care. Panel (b) shows 
increases in health care spending per person in the United States and 10 other high-
income countries. Spending on health care has grown faster in the United States than in 
other countries.
Does it matter that spending on health care is an increasing share of total spend-
ing and output in the U.S. economy? The shares of different products in total spending 
change frequently. For instance, in the United States, the shares of spending on cell

phones or LCD televisions were much greater in 2012 than in 2000. Spending on food 
as a share of total spending has been declining for decades. Economists interpret these 
changes as reflecting consumers’ preferences—consumers choose to devote relatively 
more of their incomes to spending on cell phones and relatively less to spending on 
food. As we have seen, though, most people pay for health care by relying on third-
party payers, such as employer-provided health insurance or government-provided 
Medicare or Medicaid. Out-of-pocket spending, spending on health care that con-
sumers pay out of their own incomes rather than through health insurance, has been 
declining.
Figure 7.6 shows that out-of-pocket spending on health care as a percentage of 
all spending on health care has steadily declined since 1965. In 1965, 45 percent of all 
health care spending was out-of-pocket, while in 2011, only 11 percent was. As a re-
sult, in recent years, consumers of health care have been directly paying for only a small 
fraction of the true cost of providing health care, with third-party payers picking up 
the remainder. As average incomes rise, consumers might be expected to spend a rising 
share of the increase on health care. But because consumers do not pay the full cost of 
increases in health care spending, they may not be willing to buy as much health care as 
they currently receive if they had to pay the full price.
Because the federal and state governments in the United States pay for just over half 
of health care spending through Medicare, Medicaid, and other programs, increases in 
health care spending can cause problems for government budgets. The Medicare and 
Medicaid programs began in 1965. By 2010, spending on these programs had grown to 
5.5 percent of GDP. That percentage is expected to more than double over the next 40 
years unless health care costs begin to grow at a slower rate. In 2011, the federal govern-
ment was struggling to find ways to pay for the projected increases in Medicare and 
Medicaid without severely cutting other federal spending or sharply raising taxes.
Explaining Rapid Increases  
in Health Care Spending
In this section we briefly discuss some reasons economists believe that health care 
spending has been increasing rapidly in the United States. We start by reviewing 
 explanations that are sometimes offered by policymakers and journalists, but that are 
unlikely to account for most of the increases in health care costs.
Factors That Do Not Explain Sustained Increases in Health Care Spending 
The two panels of Figure 7.5 show that spending on health care has been growing faster

C H A P T E R  7  The Economics of Health Care 
than the economy as a whole for at least the past several decades. Explaining the rapid 
growth of health care spending requires identifying factors that have more than a one-
time effect. For example, because the U.S. health care system relies on many indepen-
dent hospitals, medical practices, and insurance companies, some observers argue that 
it generates more paperwork, duplication, and waste than systems in other countries. 
Even if this observation is correct, it cannot account for health care’s rising share of GDP 
unless paperwork and waste are increasing year after year, which seems unlikely.
Unlike in most countries, it is relatively easy in the United States for patients who 
have been injured by medical errors to sue doctors and hospitals for damages. The Con-
gressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates, though, that the payments to settle malprac-
tice lawsuits plus the premiums doctors pay for malpractice insurance amount to less 
than 1 percent of health care costs. Other economists believe the CBO estimate is too 
low and that the costs of malpractice lawsuits, including the costs of unnecessary tests 
and procedures doctors order to avoid being sued, are as much as 7 percent of total 
health care costs. Still, these costs have not been significantly increasing over time.
Somewhere between 1 percent and 4 percent of health care costs are due to unin-
sured patients receiving treatments at hospital emergency rooms that could have been 
provided less expensively in doctors’ offices. But once again, this cost has not been in-
creasing rapidly enough to account for much of the increase in health care as a percent-
age of GDP.
“Cost Disease” in the Health Care Sector Some economists argue that health 
care suffers from a problem often encountered in service industries. In some sectors 
of the economy, particularly manufacturing and the production of goods, produc-
tivity, or the amount of output each worker can produce in a given period, increases 
steadily. These increases in productivity occur because over time firms provide workers 
with more machinery and equipment, including computers, with which to work, and 
because technological progress results in improvements in machinery and equipment 
and other parts of the production process. As workers produce more goods, firms are 
able to pay them higher wages. In service-producing industries, though, increasing out-
put per worker is more difficult. In education, for instance, computers and the Internet 
have been useful, but most of education still involves a teacher standing in front of a 
classroom of students. Increasing the number of students per teacher year after year is 
not feasible. The same is true of medicine, where MRI units, CT scanners, and other 
medical technology have improved diagnosis and treatment, but most medicine still re-
quires a face-to-face meeting between a doctor and a patient. As wages rise in industries 
in which productivity is increasing rapidly, service industries in which productivity is 
increasing less rapidly must match these wage increases or lose workers. Because in-
creases in wages are not offset by increases in productivity in service industries, the cost 
to firms of supplying services increases.
William Baumol of New York University has labeled the tendency for low produc-
tivity in service industries to lead to higher costs in those industries as “the cost disease 
of the service sector.” There is good reason to think that health care suffers from this 
cost disease because growth in labor productivity in health care has been less than half 
as fast as labor productivity growth in the economy as a whole. This slow growth in pro-
ductivity can help explain why the cost of health care has been rising so rapidly, thereby 
increasing health care’s share of total spending and output.
The Aging of the Population and Advances in Medical Technology As 
people age, they increase their spending on health care. Firms continue to develop new 
prescription drugs and new medical equipment that typically have higher costs than 
the drugs and equipment they replace. The aging of the U.S. population and the intro-
duction of higher cost drugs and medical equipment interact to drive up spending on 
the federal government’s Medicare program and on health care generally. Many newly 
introduced drugs and diagnostic tools are used disproportionately by people over age 
65. Partly as a result, health care spending on people over age 65 is six times greater than 
spending on people aged 18 to 24 and four times greater than on people aged 25 to 44. 

 
The Debate over Health Care Policy in the United States  
223
In 2010, there were 47 million people receiving Medicare, and that number is expected 
to grow to 80 million by 2030. As we have seen, even in the absence of the development 
of new drugs and other medical technology, low rates of productivity in the health care 
sector could be expected to drive up costs. In fact, as Figure 7.7 illustrates, the CBO 
estimates that most of the increase in federal spending on the Medicare and Medicaid 
programs will be due to increases in the cost of providing health care, rather than to the 
aging of the population. In the figure, “effect of excess cost growth” refers to the extent 
to which health care costs per person grow faster than GDP per person. So, the combi-
nation of an aging population and increases in the cost of providing health care are an 
important reason why health care spending is an increasing percentage of GDP.
Distorted Economic Incentives As we noted earlier, some part of the increase in 
health care spending shown in Figure 7.5 on page 220 represents consumers choosing to 
allocate more of their incomes to health care as their incomes rise. But as we have also 
seen, consumers usually pay less than the true cost of medical treatment because a third 
party—typically, an insurance company or the government—often pays most of the bill. 
For example, consumers who have health insurance provided by their employers usually 
pay only a small amount—perhaps $20—for a visit to a doctor’s office, when the true 
cost of the visit might be $80 or $90. The result is that consumers demand a larger quan-
tity of health care services than they would if they paid a price that better represented 
the cost of providing the services. Doctors and other health care providers also have a 
reduced incentive to control costs because they know that an insurance company will 
pick up most of the bill.
In some important ways, health insurance is different from other types of insurance. 
As we discussed earlier, the basic idea of insurance is that the risk of an unpredictable, 
high-cost event—a house fire or a serious car accident—is pooled among the many con-
sumers who buy insurance. Health insurance, though, also typically covers many planned 
expenses, such as routine checkups, annual physicals, vaccinations, and other low-cost 
events, such as treatment for minor illnesses. By disguising the true cost of these routine 
expenses, health insurance encourages overuse of health care services.
We discuss further the role of economic incentives in health care in the next section.
The Debate over Health Care Policy
As we have seen, the United States has been unusual among high-income countries in 
relying on private health insurance—largely from firms—to provide health care cover-
age to the majority of the population. Most other high-income countries either provide 
health care directly, as the United Kingdom does, through government-owned hospitals 
and government-employed doctors, or they provide health insurance to all residents, as 
Canada does, without directly employing doctors or owning hospitals. There have been

Although the aging of the U.S. population

increases in the cost of providing health

spending on these programs.

C H A P T E R  7  The Economics of Health Care 
several attempts to reorganize the U.S. health care system to make it more like the systems 
in other countries. In 1945, President Harry Truman proposed a plan for national health 
insurance under which anyone could purchase health insurance from the federal govern-
ment. The health insurance would cover treatment received from doctors and hospitals 
that agreed to enroll in the system. Congress declined to enact the plan. In 1993, Presi-
dent Bill Clinton proposed a health care plan intended to provide universal coverage. 
While somewhat complex, the plan was based on requiring most businesses to provide 
health insurance to their employees and new government-sponsored health alliances that 
would ensure coverage for anyone who otherwise would not have health insurance. After 
a prolonged political debate, Congress chose not to enact President Clinton’s plan.
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) The debate over 
health care played an important role during the 2008 presidential campaign. In 2009, 
President Barack Obama proposed health care legislation that after much debate and 
significant changes was signed into law as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care 
Act (PPACA) in March 2010. The act was long and complex, taking up over 20,000 
pages and touching nearly every aspect of health care in the United States. Here is a 
summary of only the act’s main provisions:
• 
Individual mandate The act required that, with limited exceptions, every resi-
dent of the United States have health insurance that meets certain basic require-
ments. Beginning in 2014, individuals who do not acquire health insurance will 
be subject to a fine. The fine will rise over time, reaching $895 per person or  
2.5  percent of income, whichever is greater, by 2018.
• 
State health exchanges Beginning in 2014, each state is to establish an Affordable 
Insurance Exchange. Separate exchanges are to be established for individuals and 
small businesses with fewer than 50 employees. The exchanges will be run by a state 
government agency or by a non-profit firm and will offer health insurance policies 
that meet certain specified requirements. The intention is that private insurance com-
panies will compete by offering policies on the exchanges to individuals and small 
businesses. Low-income individuals and small businesses with 25 or fewer  employees 
will be eligible for tax credits to offset the costs of buying health insurance.
• 
Employer mandate Beginning in 2014, every firm with more than 200 employees 
must offer health insurance to its employees and must automatically enroll them in 
the plan. Firms with more than 50 employees must offer health insurance or pay a fee 
of $3,000 to the federal government for every employee who receives a tax credit from 
the federal government for obtaining health insurance through a health exchange.
• 
Regulation of health insurance Insurance companies are required to participate 
in a high-risk pool that will insure individuals with pre-existing medical conditions 
who have been unable to buy health insurance for at least six months. All individual  
and group policies must provide coverage for dependent children up to age 26. 
 Beginning in 2014, lifetime dollar maximums on coverage are prohibited. Limits 
are also placed on the size of deductibles and on the waiting period before coverage 
becomes effective.
• 
Medicare and Medicaid Eligibility for Medicaid was expanded to persons with in-
comes up to 400 percent of the federal poverty line; in 2011, the federal poverty line 
was an annual income of $10,890 for an individual. In an attempt to control increases 
in health care costs, an Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) was established 
with the power to reduce Medicare payments for prescription drugs and for the use 
of diagnostic equipment and other technology if Medicare spending exceeds certain 
levels. Some Medicare reimbursements to hospitals and doctors were reduced.
• 
Taxes Several new taxes will help fund the program. Beginning in 2013, work-
ers earning more than $200,000 will have their share of the Medicare payroll tax 
increase from 1.45 percent to a 2.35 percent, and investors who earn more than 
$200,000 will pay a new 3.8 percent tax on their investment income. Beginning 
Patient Protection and Affordable 
Care Act (PPACA) Health care 
reform legislation passed by Congress 
and signed by President Barack 
Obama in 2010.

 
The Debate over Health Care Policy in the United States  
225
in 2018, a tax will be imposed on employer-provided health insurance plans that 
have a value above $10,200 for an individual or $27,500 for a family. Pharmaceu-
tical firms, health insurance firms, and firms producing medical devices will also 
pay new taxes.
The PPACA is scheduled to be fully implemented by 2019 at which point more 
than 30 million additional individuals are expected to have health care coverage. The 
Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has estimated that the law will increase federal 
government spending by about $938 billion over 10 years. The CBO estimates that the 
additional taxes and fees enacted under the law will raise over $1 trillion, which would 
be enough to pay for the plan and reduce the federal government’s budget deficit by 
more than $100 billion over 10 years. Many economists have disputed this estimate, 
arguing that the law’s new spending will increase the deficit.
The Debate over the PPACA Any law as far-reaching and complex as the 
PPACA is bound to draw criticism. As noted earlier in the chapter, the congressio-
nal debate over the law was highly partisan with every Republican ultimately voting 
against it and all Democrats in the Senate and all but 34 Democrats in the House vot-
ing in favor of it. Critics of the act can be divided into two broad groups: Those who 
argue that health care reform should involve a greater movement toward a system 
similar to the European, Canadian, and Japanese systems, and those who argue that 
health care reform should include more market-based changes.
As we discussed in the Making the Connection on page 218, some economists 
and policymakers believe that information problems and externalities in the market 
for health care are sufficiently large that the government should either provide health 
care directly through government-owned hospitals and government-employed doctors 
or pay for health care through national health insurance, sometimes referred to as a 
 single-payer system. Although the PPACA significantly increased the federal govern-
ment’s involvement in the health care system, it stopped short of the degree of govern-
ment involvement that exists in the Canadian, Japanese, or European systems. Critics 
in favor of moving toward greater government involvement typically argue that doing 
so would reduce the paperwork and waste caused by the current system or the sys-
tem as it will be under PPACA. They argue that the current Medicare system—which 
is essentially a single-payer system for people over age 65—has proved to have lower 
 administrative costs than have private health insurance companies. Supporters of 
greater government involvement in the health care system have also argued that the Ca-
nadian and European systems have had lower levels of health care spending per person 
and lower rates of  increase in total health care spending, while providing good health 
care outcomes.
Market-based reforms of health care involve changing the market for health care 
so that it becomes more like the markets for other goods and services. As in other mar-
kets, the prices consumers pay and suppliers receive would do a better job of conveying 
information on consumer demand and supplier costs. The expectation is that increased 
competition among doctors, hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, and other providers 
of health care would reduce costs and increase economic efficiency. Economists who 
support market-based reforms as the best approach to improving the health care sys-
tem were disappointed that the PPACA did not adopt this approach. Currently, markets 
are delivering inaccurate signals to consumers because when buying health care, unlike 
when buying most other goods and services, consumers pay a price well below the true 
cost of providing the service.

the market for health care that would

How Much Is That MRI Scan?
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) units play an important 
role in modern medicine. First introduced in the early 1980s, 
MRI units allow doctors to see inside the body’s soft tissues 
to identify tumors, torn muscles, and other medical problems. 
Making  
the 
Connection

226 
C H A P T E R  7  The Economics of Health Care 
As we noted earlier, MRI units are more widely available in the United States than in 
most other countries. We would normally expect that when a product is widely avail-
able, competition among firms results in the price of the product being about the same 
everywhere. Customers would not buy a bestselling book from Amazon.com if the price 
was 50 percent higher than on BarnesandNoble.com.
Does competition equalize the prices of medical services? The data in the table 
below indicates that the prices of abdominal MRI scans vary widely. In most cities in 
the United States, the most expensive MRI scan has a price that is more than double 
the least expensive scan. Two reporters looking at prices for shoulder MRI scans in 
 Pensacola, Florida, found that Sacred Heart Hospital was charging $800 for a shoulder 
MRI scan, while Pensacola Open MRI & Imaging, a private firm located less than one 
mile away, was charging $450 for the same scan. Pensacola Open MRI & Imaging was 
actually using newer MRI units that give higher resolution images, so they were charg-
ing less for a better service.
How can some providers of medical services charge hundreds or thousands of dol-
lars more than competitors and remain in business? The answer is that most patients are 
unconcerned about prices because they do not pay them or pay only a fraction of them. 
Patients typically rely on doctors to refer them to a facility for an MRI scan or other 
procedure and make little or no effort to determine the price the facility charges. A goal 
of market-based reforms of the health care system is to give patients an incentive to pay 
more attention to the prices of medical services.

Supporters of market-based reforms note that employees have to pay federal 
 income and payroll taxes on the wages their employers pay them, but in most circum-
stances they do not pay taxes on the value of the health insurance their employers pro-
vide them. This feature of the tax laws encourages employees to want very generous 
health care coverage; in fact, if offered the choice between a $1,000 salary increase or 
increased health care coverage that was worth $1,000, many people would choose the 
increased health care coverage because it would be tax free (although someone who was 
young and healthy and did not expect to have medical bills would probably still choose 
the increase in salary). The size of this tax break is quite substantial—more than $250 
billion in 2011. But individuals typically get no tax break when buying an individual

health insurance policy or when they spend money on health care out-of-pocket.1 
Some economists have proposed making the tax treatment of employer-provided health 
 insurance the same as the tax treatment of individually purchased health insurance 
and out-of-pocket health care spending. They argue that this change could, potentially, 
significantly reduce spending on health care without reducing the effectiveness of the 
health care received. Such tax law changes would make it more likely that employer-
provided health insurance would focus on large medical bills—such as those resulting 
from  hospitalizations—while consumers would pay prices closer to the costs of pro-
viding routine medical care. John Cogan of the Hoover Institution, R. Glenn Hubbard 
of Columbia University, and Daniel Kessler of Stanford estimate that repealing the tax 
preference for employer-provided health insurance would reduce spending by people 
enrolled in these programs by 33 percent.
Currently, the U.S. health care system is a world leader in innovation in medical 
technology and prescription drugs. About two-thirds of pharmaceutical patents are 
 issued to U.S. firms and about two-thirds of research on new medicines is carried out in 
the United States. One goal of market-based reforms would be to ensure that U.S. firms 
continue with innovations in medical screening equipment, surgical procedures, and 
prescription drugs. Executives of U.S. pharmaceutical firms have voiced concern over 
whether aspects of PPACA will affect their ability to profitably bring new prescription 
drugs to market. In particular, managers at these firms worry that the new Independent 
Payment Advisory Board might reduce the payments Medicare would make for new 
prescription drugs.
Both critics of the PPACA who favor greater government involvement in health care 
and those who favor market reforms raise questions about the act’s individual mandate. 
The individual mandate requires every U.S. resident to have health insurance. The man-
date was considered necessary because otherwise healthy people might avoid buying 
insurance until they become ill. Because insurance companies would not be allowed to 
deny coverage for pre-existing conditions, they would end up paying large medical bills 
for people who had not been paying premiums to support the system while they were 
healthy. There were questions, though, about whether the requirement to buy health in-
surance would be enforceable. Although people who do not buy insurance are subject to 
fines under the act, there was no mechanism set up to collect the fines if people refused 
to pay them voluntarily.
Health Exchanges, Small Businesses, 
and Rising Medical Costs
We saw at the beginning of the chapter that for many small 
businesses, the cost of providing health insurance to their 
 employees has become a heavy burden. A key provision of the PPACA was intended 
to address this problem. As noted earlier, by 2014, every state is obligated to set up an 
Affordable Insurance Exchange. Each exchange must operate a Small Business Health 
 Options Program (SHOP) where private insurance companies will offer small firms 
health insurance plans that the firms can purchase for their workers. Small firms with 
up to 100 employees will be eligible to purchase health insurance through their state’s 
SHOP. In addition, firms with fewer than 25 employees will receive a tax credit to offset 
up to 50 percent of the cost of providing health insurance to their workers.
The plan is intended to get over one of the key disadvantages small firms face 
when buying health insurance: limited risk pooling. When an insurance company sells 
health insurance to a large firm, the risk of illness and large medical bills is spread 
across many employees. Adverse selection problems are also reduced when a plan cov-
ers a large number of workers. When a firm employs only a few workers, as is the case 
with the New York antique store we discussed in the chapter opener, a single  illness 
Making

1Individuals receive a deduction on their federal income tax only if their medical expenses are greater 
than 7.5 percent of their income. Only a relatively small number of individuals have expenses high 
enough to make use of that deduction. The threshold is being raised under the PPACA to 10 percent.

228 
C H A P T E R  7  The Economics of Health Care 
can cause an insurance company to make payments far 
above the premiums it has received from the firm. Typically, 
the insurance company will then substantially raise the pre-
miums the firm will pay. Even if none of the employees of a 
firm becomes ill, insurance companies concerned about ad-
verse selection problems may raise premiums substantially 
over time. The owners of the antique store had to pay pre-
mium increases of more than 20 percent per year. Under the 
SHOP plan, a small firm’s employees would be pooled with 
the employees of other small firms and premiums could dif-
fer across firms only on the basis of the age of the employees 
and whether the employees smoke. The federal government 
has given the states significant flexibility in designing the 
exchanges.
Will SHOP provide a solution to the difficulties small firms encounter in pro-
viding health insurance for their employees? Initially, the New York antique store 
owner was optimistic: “In the short run, the tax credits definitely give me money 
to potentially hire another employee. . . . I’m hopeful we’ll see other benefits, espe-
cially all of the savings from the exchanges, in the long run.” It is difficult to say how 
 effective the exchanges will be, however, because they will not begin operating until 
2014, and as of 2011 many states had not yet announced the rules under which their 
exchanges would operate. The failure of a health insurance exchange that the state of 
California ran from 1993 to 2006 shows one potential problem. Firms with relatively 
healthy workers found that they could buy health insurance more cheaply outside of 
the exchange. As they left the exchange, insurers needed to raise rates to cover the 
remaining pool of companies with less healthy workers. Higher rates led more firms 
to withdraw until finally the exchange collapsed. This process is sometimes referred 
to as an adverse selection death spiral. To succeed, the new health exchanges need to 
avoid this spiral.
The federal government hopes that the exchanges will improve the choices avail-
able to small businesses by requiring that insurance companies meet guidelines for 
the types of insurance they offer and the information they provide to these busi-
nesses. Supporters of the exchanges also hope that they will reduce administrative 
costs, which will allow insurance companies to offer plans with lower premiums. Some 
economists and policymakers, however, argue that by increasing the number of peo-
ple covered by health insurance the exchanges were likely to increase the demand for 
medical services, further driving up their costs. If health care costs rise as a result, the 
exchanges would have to pass the costs along to businesses in the form of higher insur-
ance premiums.
As of 2011, the health exchanges, as well as other aspects of the PPACA, were sub-
ject to lawsuits from states that claimed that the act violated the U.S. Constitution. Some 
members of Congress were also attempting to amend the act before it went fully into 
effect in 2014. The outcome of these political debates could potentially alter how the 
health exchanges would be run.

Conclusion
In this chapter, we have seen that economic analysis can provide important insights into 
the market for health care. As with many other policy issues, though, economic analysis 
can help inform the debate, but cannot resolve it. Because health care is so important to 
consumers and because health care spending looms so large in the U.S. economy, the 
role of the government in the health care system is likely to be the subject of intense 
debate for years to come.

Why Is It Difficult for People Who Are Seriously Ill to Buy Health Insurance?
At the beginning of this chapter, we asked: Why is it difficult for people who are seriously ill to 
buy health insurance? Someone who is seriously ill can face frighteningly large medical bills. It is 
natural that such a person would like to purchase health insurance to help pay those bills. Unfor-
tunately, insurance works best when it involves risk pooling for people who face an uncertain and 
high-cost event, such as their house burning down or being diagnosed with cancer. Insurance com-
panies are naturally reluctant to provide insurance to someone who is already seriously ill because 
the premiums they receive from the person are certain to be less than the person’s medical bills—
which the insurance company will have to pay. In order to remain in business, insurance companies 
will either not insure people with preexisting medical conditions or will insure them only after a 
waiting period of perhaps years. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), which 
became law in 2010, attempts to make it easier for people with preexisting conditions to buy 
health insurance. Under the act, each state will run a health exchange that will offer individual 
health insurance policies to individuals who cannot be excluded because of preexisting conditions 
and who will pay premiums that can vary only by the buyer’s age and whether the buyer is a 
smoker. Economists and policymakers debate whether the act will be effective.

Medicaid, will become even more im-
portant. By 2020, federal, state and lo-
cal government health care spending 
will account for just under half the to-
tal tab, up from 45 percent currently. 
As the health care law’s coverage ex-
pansion takes effect, “health care fi-
nancing is anticipated to further shift 
toward governments,” the report said.
Estimates from previous years had 
projected that the government share 
would already be at the 50 percent 
mark, but the actuary’s office changed 
its method for making the complex 
calculations. Under the previous ap-
proach, some private payments such as 
worker’s compensation insurance had 
been counted in the government col-
umn. Technical  accuracy—not politi-
cal pressure—was behind that change, 
said Stephen  Heffler, one of the ex-
perts who worked on the estimates.
Separately, another new report 
finds that the United States contin-
ues to spend far more on health care 
than other economically developed 
countries. The study by the Common-
wealth Fund found that U.S. health 
care spending per person in 2008 was 
more than double the median—or 
midpoint—for other leading econo-
mies. Although survival rates for 
some cancers were higher in the U.S., 
the report found that quality of care 
overall was not markedly better.

than the economy are the high cost of 
medical innovations and an aging so-
ciety that consumes increasing levels 
of service.
Many of the newly insured peo-
ple under the health care law will be 
younger and healthier. As a result, 
they are expected to use more doc-
tor visits and prescription drugs and 
relatively less of pricey hospital care. 
Health care spending will jump by 8 
percent in 2014, when the law’s cover-
age expansion kicks in. But over the 
2010–2020 period covered by the es-
timate, the average yearly growth in 
health care spending will be only 0.1 
percentage point higher than without 
Obama’s overhaul.
Part of the reason for that opti-
mistic prognosis is that cuts and cost 
controls in the health care law start 
to bite down late in the decade. How-
ever, the same nonpartisan Medicare 
experts who produced Thursday’s 
estimate have previously questioned 
whether that austerity will be politi-
cally sustainable if hospitals and other 
providers start going out of busi-
ness as a result. The actuary’s office 
is responsible for long-range cost 
estimates.
The report found that health care 
spending in 2010 grew at a historically 
low rate of 3.9 percent, partly because 
of the sluggish economy. That will 
change as the economy shakes off the 
lingering effects of the recession.

nant player because of Medicare and 
U.S. Health Care Tab 
to Hit $4.6T in 2020
The nation’s health care tab is on track 
to hit $4.6 trillion in 2020, accounting 
for about $1 of every $5 in the econ-
omy, government number crunchers 
estimate in a report out Thursday.
How much is that? Including gov-
ernment and private money, health 
care spending in 2020 will  average 
$13,710 for every man, woman and 
child, says Medicare’s Office of the 
Actuary.
By comparison, U.S. health care 
spending this year is projected to top 
$2.7 trillion, or about $8,650 per cap-
ita, roughly $1 of $6 in the economy. 
Most of that spending is for care for 
the sickest people.
The report from Medicare econo-
mists and statisticians is an annual ba-
rometer of a trend that many experts 
say is unsustainable but doesn’t seem 
to be slowing down. A political com-
promise over the nation’s debt and 
deficits might succeed in tapping the 
brakes on health care, but polarized 
lawmakers have been unable to de-
liver a deal.
The analysis found that President 
Barack Obama’s health care overhaul 
would only be a modest contributor 
to growing costs, even though an ad-
ditional 30 million people who would 
be otherwise uninsured stand to gain 
coverage.

Government analysts predict that the cost 
of health care will reach $4.6 trillion in 2020, 
an average of $13,710 per person. The total 
cost in 2011 is expected to exceed $2.7 tril-
lion, or about $8,650 per person. The high 
costs of medical innovation and an aging 
population are cited as the primary reasons 
for the rapid increase in health care costs. 
The implementation of health care reform 
is expected to contribute only modestly to 
this increase, with the government’s share 
of spending rising from 45 percent to just 
under 50 percent of the total cost. A ma-
jority of this increase will be for Medicare 
and Medicaid payments, with the health 
care overhaul expected to account for an 
increase of only one-tenth of one percent. 
A number of analysts believe the continued 
increases in health care costs are unsus-
tainable for the economy.
Analyzing the News
a Spending on health care in the United 
States is increasing at a rapid pace, and it 
is expected to be roughly 20 percent of GDP 
by 2020. This means that one-fifth of total 
production in the United States will be de-
voted to health care, compared to one-twen-
tieth in the mid-1960s. While health care 
spending as a percentage of GDP has been 
steadily growing, the percentage of this 
spending that is being paid directly by con-
sumers has been steadily declining. The fig-
ure below shows both the increase in health 
care spending as a  percentage of GDP and 
the decrease in out-of-pocket health care 
spending by consumers as a percentage of 
all health care spending in the United States 
since 1965. These data show that while in-
creasing amounts of production are being de-
voted to health care, consumers are directly 
paying a smaller and smaller percentage of 
the cost. The declining out-of-pocket spend-
ing, and subsequent  increasing percentage of 
third-party payouts, is often cited as one of 
the reasons for the overall increase in health 
care spending.
b The rapid increase in health care 
spending is thought by many to be un-
sustainable without increases in taxes or 
decreases in other areas of spending. In 
2009, President Obama proposed sweep-
ing changes for the U.S. health care sys-
tem, and the following year, he signed the 
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act 
(PPACA) into law. There has been much de-
bate as to whether this health care overhaul 
package will increase or decrease overall 
spending on health care, but an analysis by 
Medicare officials claims that the PPACA 
will result in only a 0.1 percent additional in-
crease in annual health care spending over 
the next decade. If this projection is accu-
rate, the PPACA will not significantly con-
tribute to the continued increases in health 
care spending.
c One of the biggest concerns over the 
rise in health care spending in the 
United States is the government’s increas-
ingly large share of the overall cost. Due 
 primarily to Medicare and Medicaid, federal, 
state, and local governments already 
 account for 45 percent of the nation’s annual 
health care spending, and with the passage 
of the PPACA, this share is expected to rise 
to nearly 50 percent by 2020. If the current 
rate of increase in spending is truly unsus-
tainable and the government will be respon-
sible for a larger share of these increasing 
costs, major changes to government spend-
ing or taxes will need to be implemented to 
get health care costs under control. This will 
no doubt continue to be a topic of heated 
debate in Washington in years to come.
Thinking Critically 
about Policy
1. Under the Patient Protection and Afford-
able Care Act (PPACA), every resident 
of the United States will be required to 
have health insurance, so up to 30 mil-
lion people who would otherwise be un-
insured will potentially have insurance 
coverage. Explain the effect that this 
increase in the number of insured peo-
ple may have on the adverse selection 
problem and the moral hazard problem 
in the market for health insurance. How 
might this change affect total spending 
on health care?
2. Analysts and policymakers have de-
scribed rapid increases in health care 
spending as unsustainable for the econ-
omy. In what sense are these increases 
unsustainable?

Summary
Health care refers to goods and services, such as prescription drugs 
and consultations with a doctor, that are intended to maintain or 
improve health. Over time, the health of people in most countries 
has improved. In the United States, as a result of improving health, 
life expectancy has increased, death rates have decreased, infant 
mortality has decreased, and the average person has become taller.

Chapter Summary and Problems
Summary
Health insurance is a contract under which a buyer agrees to make 
payments, or premiums, in exchange for the provider’s agreeing to 
pay some or all of the buyer’s medical bills. A majority of people 
in the United States live in households that have private health in-
surance, which they typically obtain through an employer. Other 
people have health insurance through the government’s Medicare 
and Medicaid programs. In 2009, about 17 percent of people in 
the United States lacked health insurance. Many health insurance

plans operate on a fee-for-service basis under which doctors and 
hospitals receive a payment for each service they provide. Most 
countries outside of the United States have greater government in-
volvement in their health care systems. Canada has a single-payer 
health care system, in which the government provides national 
health insurance to all Canadian residents. In the United King-
dom, the government owns most hospitals and employs most 
doctors, and the health care system is referred to as socialized 
medicine. The United States spends more per person on health 
care than do other high-income countries. The United States has 
lower life expectancy, higher infant mortality, and a greater inci-
dence of obesity than do other high-income countries. The United 
States has more medical technology per person and has lower 
mortality rates for people diagnosed with cancer than do other 
high-income countries. Various problems make it difficult to 
compare health care outcomes across countries.

Summary
The market for health care is affected by the problem of asym-
metric information, which occurs when one party to an eco-
nomic transaction has less information than the other party. 
Adverse  selection, the situation in which one party to a transac-
tion takes advantage of knowing more than the other party to the 
transaction, is a problem for firms selling health insurance poli-
cies because it results in less healthy people being more likely to 
buy insurance than are healthier people. Moral hazard, actions 
people take after they have entered into a transaction that make 
the other party to the transaction worse off, is also a problem for 
insurance companies because once people have health insurance 
they are likely to make more visits to their doctors and in other 
ways increase their use of medical services. Moral hazard can 
also involve a principal–agent problem in which doctors may 
order more lab tests, MRI scans, and other procedures than they 
would if their patients lacked health insurance. Insurance com-
panies use deductibles, copayments, and restrictions on coverage 
of patients with preexisting conditions to reduce the problems of 
adverse selection and moral hazard. There may be externalities 
involved with medicine and health care because, for example, 
people who are vaccinated against influenza or other diseases 
may not receive all of the benefits from having been vaccinated 
and people who become obese may not bear all of the costs from 
their obesity.

 Explain whether you agree with the following statement:
Providing health care is obviously a public good. 
If one person becomes ill and doesn’t receive 
treatment, that person may infect many other 
people. If many people become ill, then the out-
put of the economy will be negatively affected. 
Therefore, providing health care is a public good 
that should be supplied by the government.
Summary
In March 2010, Congress passed the Patient Protection and Af-
fordable Care Act (PPACA), which significantly reorganized the 
U.S. health care system. Spending on health care in the United 
States has been growing rapidly as a percentage of GDP, and 
spending per person on health care has been growing more rapidly 
than in other high-income countries. Third-party payers, such as 
employer-provided health insurance and the Medicare and Med-
icaid programs, have financed an increasing fraction of health care 
spending, while out-of-pocket payments have sharply declined as 
a fraction of total health care spending. Several explanations have 
been offered for the rapid increase in health care spending in the 
United States: Slow rates of growth of labor productivity in health 
care may be driving up costs, the U.S. population is becoming 
older, medical technology and new prescription drugs have higher 
costs, and the tax system and the reliance on third-party payers 
have distorted the economic incentives of consumers and suppli-
ers of health care. The PPACA has several important provisions:  
(1) an individual mandate that requires every resident of the 
United States to obtain health insurance or be fined; (2) the estab-
lishment of health exchanges that will be run by the state govern-
ments and provide a means for individuals and small businesses to 
purchase health insurance; (3) an employer mandate that requires

every firm with more than 200 employees to offer health insurance 
to them; (4) increased regulation of health insurance companies; 
(5) expansion of eligibility for Medicaid and the establishment of 
the Independent Payment Advisory Board, which has the power to 
reduce Medicare payments for prescription drugs and for the use 
of diagnostic equipment and other technology if Medicare spend-
ing exceeds certain levels; and (6) increased taxes on workers with 
incomes above $200,000. Some critics of the PPACA argue that it 
does not go far enough in increasing government involvement in 
the health care system, while other critics argue that health care 
reform should rely more heavily on market-based reforms, which 
involve changing the market for health care so that it becomes 
more like the markets for other goods and services.

Problems and Applications
 
4.6 Figure 7.7 on page 223 shows that the Congressional Bud-
get Office forecasts that only about 10 percent of future 
 increases in spending on Medicare as a percentage of GDP 
will be due to the aging of the population. What factors ex-
plain the other 90 percent of the increase?
 
4.7 Some economists and policymakers have argued that one 
way to control federal government spending on Medicare 
is to have a board of experts decide whether new medical 
technologies are worth their higher costs. If the board de-
cides that they are not worth the costs, Medicare would not 
pay for them. Other economists and policymakers argue 
that the costs to beneficiaries should more closely repre-
sent the costs of providing medical services. This result 
might be attained by raising premiums, deductibles, and 
copayments or by “means testing,” which would limit the 
Medicare benefits high-income individuals receive. Po-
litical columnist David Brooks has summarized these 
two ways to restrain the growth of spending on Medicare: 
“From the top, a body of experts can be empowered to 
make rationing decisions. . . . Alternatively, at the bottom, 
costs can be shifted to beneficiaries with premium sup-
ports to help them handle the burden.”
 
a. What are “rationing decisions”? How would these deci-
sions restrain the growth of Medicare spending?
 
b. How would shifting the costs of Medicare to beneficia-
ries restrain the growth of Medicare spending? What 
does Brooks mean by “premium supports”?
 
c. Should Congress and the president be concerned about 
the growth of Medicare spending? If so, which of these 
approaches should they adopt or is there a third approach 
that might be better? (Note:This last question is normative 
and has no definitive answer. It is intended to lead you to 
consider possible approaches to the Medicare program.)

4.8 Ross Douthat, a political columnist, offers the following 
observations about the Medicare program:
Certainly telling seniors to buy all their own 
health care is a complete political (and ethical)

In late 2011, Facebook remained a pri-
vate firm. However, a small number of its 
shares are available for sale on private mar-
kets but not on public financial markets. 
Companies such as Facebook often issue 
shares to their founders, some of their em-
ployees, and some private investors. Under 
federal regulations, holders of these shares 
can sell them under certain conditions. In 
mid-2011, stock in Facebook was selling for 
about $35 per share, which made the total 
value of the firm about $80 billion.
Because the buying and selling of stock 
in Facebook was not being done on the 
public financial markets, the firm was not 
subject to the usual federal regulations that 
apply to public firms. Some economists and 
policymakers argued that the result was less 
protection for investors. As we will see in 
this chapter, financial markets are crucial to 
the health of the economy, and how finan-
cial markets should be regulated is an im-
portant policy issue.

When Mark Zuckerberg started Facebook 
in 2004, he was a sophomore in college. 
Just 5 years later, Facebook had 150 million 
users. By contrast, it took cell phone com-
panies 15 years to reach 150 million users 
and 7 years for Apple’s iPod to reach that 
many users. Zuckerberg started Facebook 
because he believed that people were less 
interested in meeting new friends online—
the assumption built into other sites—than 
they were in finding a better way of staying 
in touch with the friends they already had. 
On Facebook, pages would typically be vis-
ible only to people the user had linked to, 
or “friended,” which helped to reduce the 
problem of fake identities that plagued 
other sites.
Any business experiencing the run-
away success of Facebook quickly develops 
a need to raise money to finance its expan-
sion. Some businesses raise the funds they 
need by borrowing from banks. Large firms, 
as Facebook has become, have the ability to 
sell stocks and bonds to investors in finan-
cial markets. By selling stock, a firm trades 
partial ownership of the firm in exchange 
for the funds needed for growth and expan-
sion. Firms that sell stock that is traded in fi-
nancial markets such as the New York Stock 
Exchange are called public firms, whereas 
firms that do not sell stock are called private 
firms.

Do Corporate Managers Act in the Best Interests of Shareholders?
Although stockholders legally own corporations, managers often have a great deal of freedom 
in deciding how corporations are run. As a result, managers can make decisions, such as spending 
money on large corporate headquarters or decorating their offices with expensive paintings, that 
are in their interests but not in the interests of the shareholders. If managers make decisions that 
waste money and lower the profits of a firm, the price of the firm’s stock will fall, which hurts the 
investors who own the stock. Suppose you own stock in a corporation. Why is it difficult to get the 
managers to act in your interests rather than in their own? Given this problem, should you ever 
take on the risk of buying stock? As you read the chapter, see if you can answer these questions. 
You can check your answers against those we provide on page 255 at the end of this chapter.

C H A P T E R  8  Firms, the Stock Market, and Corporate Governance
I
n this chapter, we look at firms: how they are organized, how they raise funds, and 
the information they provide to investors. As we have discussed in earlier chapters, 
firms in a market system are responsible for organizing the factors of production to 
produce goods and services. Firms are the vehicles entrepreneurs use to earn profits. 
To  succeed, entrepreneurs must meet consumers’ wants by producing new or better goods 
and services or by finding ways of producing existing goods and services at a lower cost so 
they can be sold at a lower price. Entrepreneurs also need access to sufficient funds, and 
they must be able to efficiently organize production. As the typical firm in many industries 
has become larger over the past 100 years, the task of efficiently organizing production has 
become more difficult. In the final section of this chapter, we look at problems of corporate 
governance that have occurred in recent years. We also look at the steps firms and the gov-
ernment have taken to avoid similar problems in the future.
Types of Firms
In studying a market economy, it is important to understand the basics of how firms op-
erate. In the United States, there are three legal categories of firms: sole proprietorships, 
partnerships, and corporations. A sole proprietorship is a firm owned by a single indi-
vidual. Although most sole proprietorships are small, some employ many workers and 
earn large profits. Partnerships are firms owned jointly by two or more—sometimes 
many—persons. Most law and accounting firms are partnerships. Some of them can be 
quite large. For instance, in 2011, the Baker & McKenzie law firm based in Chicago had 
1,350 partners. Most large firms, though, are organized as corporations. A corporation 
is a legal form of business that provides owners with protection from losing more than 
their investment should the business fail.
Who Is Liable? Limited and Unlimited Liability
A key distinction among the three types of firms is that the owners of sole proprietor-
ships and partnerships have unlimited liability. Unlimited liability means there is no 
legal distinction between the personal assets of the owners of the firm and the assets of 
the firm. An asset is anything of value owned by a person or a firm. If a sole proprietor-
ship or a partnership owes a lot of money to the firm’s suppliers or employees, the sup-
pliers and employees have a legal right to sue the firm for payment, even if this requires 
the firm’s owners to sell some of their personal assets, such as stocks or bonds. In other 
words, with sole proprietorships and partnerships, the owners are not legally distinct 
from the firms they own.
It may only seem fair that the owners of a firm be responsible for a firm’s debts. But 
early in the nineteenth century, it became clear to many state legislatures in the United 
States that unlimited liability was a significant problem for any firm that was attempting 
to raise funds from large numbers of investors. An investor might be interested in mak-
ing a relatively small investment in a firm but be unwilling to become a partner in the 
firm, for fear of placing at risk all of his or her personal assets if the firm were to fail. To 
get around this problem, state legislatures began to pass general incorporation laws, which 
allowed firms to be organized as corporations. Under the corporate form of business, the 
owners of a firm have limited liability, which means that if the firm fails, the owners can 
never lose more than the amount they have invested in the firm. The personal assets of 
the owners of the firm are not affected by the failure of the firm. In fact, in the eyes of the 
law, a corporation is a legal “person,” separate from its owners. Limited liability has made 
it possible for corporations to raise funds by issuing shares of stock to large numbers of 
investors. For example, if you buy a share of Google stock, you are a part owner of the 
firm, but even if Google were to go bankrupt, you would not be personally responsible

for any of Google’s debts. Therefore, you could not lose more than the amount you paid 
for the stock.
Organizing a firm as a corporation also has some disadvantages. In the United 
States, corporate profits are taxed twice—once at the corporate level and again when 
investors receive a share of corporate profits. Corporations generally are larger than 
sole proprietorships and partnerships and are therefore more difficult to organize and 
run. Table 8.1 reviews the advantages and disadvantages of different forms of business 
organization.
Corporations Earn the Majority of Revenue 
and Profits
Figure 8.1 gives basic statistics on the three types of business organizations. Panel (a) 
shows that almost three-quarters of all firms are sole proprietorships. Panels (b) and (c) 
show that although only 18 percent of all firms are corporations, corporations account 
for a large majority of the revenue and profits earned by all firms. Profit is the differ-
ence between revenue and the total cost to a firm of producing the goods and services it  
offers for sale.
There are more than 5.8 million corporations in the United States, but only 
35,000 have annual revenues of more than $50 million. We can think of these 35,000 
firms—including Microsoft, McDonald’s, and Google—as representing “big busi-
ness.” These large firms earn 84 percent of the total profits of all corporations in the 
United States.

How Important Are Small Businesses 
to the U.S. Economy?
We have seen that although a large majority of all firms are 
sole proprietorships, they account for only a small fraction of 
total revenues and profits earned by all firms. And while 85 percent of all firms employ 
fewer than 20 workers, fewer than 20 percent of all workers are employed by these firms. 
Does this mean that small businesses are unimportant to the U.S. 
economy?
On the contrary, most economists would argue that small 
firms are vital to the health of the economy. Starting a small firm 
provides an entrepreneur with a vehicle for bringing a new prod-
uct or process to market. Locating the funding to start a small firm 
is often difficult, though, because a new firm lacks a record of op-
erating profitably, so banks and other lenders worry that the firm 
won’t be able to pay back borrowed money. As a result, more than 
80 percent of small firms are started using funds provided by the 
founders and their families, by credit cards, or by loans taken out 
against the value of the founders’ homes. While anyone starting a 
new firm hopes to become successful, perhaps even wealthy, the 
act of founding a company can also provide employment oppor-
tunities for workers and new goods and services for consumers. 
In a typical year, more than 600,000 new firms open in the United 
States, and of these, more than 95 percent employ fewer than 20 workers. In a typical 
year, new small firms create 3.3 million jobs; 40 percent of all new jobs are created by 
small firms, and in some years more than half are. Strikingly, more than 85 percent of all 
jobs created by new firms are created by small firms.
Although, on average, jobs at small firms pay lower wages than jobs at large firms 
and are less likely to provide fringe benefits, such as health insurance and retirement 
accounts, workers at small firms tend to be younger and, in fact, the first job for many 
workers is often with a small firm. Small firms are also less likely to lay off workers dur-
ing a recession than are large firms.
Entrepreneurs founding small firms have been the source of many of the most im-
portant new goods and services available to consumers. This is true even though large 
firms spend much more on research and development than do small firms. Some econo-
mists have argued that although spending on research and development by large firms 
often leads to important improvements in existing products, innovative new products are 
often introduced by small firms. For instance, during the late nineteenth and early twenti-
eth centuries, Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, and the Wright Brothers were all responsible 
for introducing important products shortly after starting what were initially very small 
firms. In more recent years, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Michael Dell, and Mark Zuckerberg 
decided that the best way to develop their ideas was by founding Microsoft, Apple, Dell 
Computer, and Facebook rather than by going to work for large corporations. Each of 
these firms began with a handful of employees, and the key products and processes they 
pioneered were developed long before they evolved into the large firms they are today.

The Structure of Corporations and the Principal–Agent Problem 
241
The Structure of Corporations and the 
Principal–Agent Problem
Because large corporations account for most sales and profits in the economy, it is 
important to know how they are managed. Most large corporations have a simi-
lar management structure. The way in which a corporation is structured and the 
effect that structure has on the corporation’s behavior is referred to as corporate 
governance.
Corporate Structure and Corporate  
Governance
Corporations are legally owned by their shareholders, the owners of the corporation’s 
stock. Unlike with a sole proprietorship, a corporation’s shareholders, although they are 
the firm’s owners, do not manage the firm directly. Instead, they elect a board of direc-
tors to represent their interests. The board of directors appoints a chief executive officer 
(CEO) to run the day-to-day operations of the corporation. Sometimes the board of 
directors also appoints other members of top management, such as the chief financial 
officer (CFO). At other times, the CEO appoints other members of top management. 
Members of top management, including the CEO and CFO, often serve on the board 
of directors. Members of management serving on the board of directors are referred 
to as inside directors. Members of the board of directors who do not have a direct man-
agement role in the firm are referred to as outside directors. The outside directors are 
intended to act as checks on the decisions of top managers, but the distinction between 
an outside director and an inside director is not always clear. For example, the CEO of a 
firm that sells a good or service to a large corporation may sit on the board of directors 
of that corporation. Although technically an outside director, this person may be reluc-
tant to oppose the top managers because they have the power to stop purchasing from 
his or her firm. In some instances, top managers have effectively controlled their firms’ 
boards of directors.
Unlike the owners of family businesses or private firms such as Facebook, the 
top management of a large corporation does not generally own a large share of the 
firm’s stock, so large corporations have a separation of ownership from control. Al-
though the shareholders actually own the firm, top management controls the firm’s 
day-to-day operations. Because top managers do not own the entire firm, they may 
decrease the firm’s profits by spending money to purchase private jets or schedule 
management meetings at luxurious resorts. Economists refer to the conflict between 
the interests of shareholders and the interests of top management as a principal–
agent problem.1 This problem occurs when agents—in this case, a firm’s top man-
agement—pursue their own interests rather than the interests of the principal who 
hired them—in this case, the shareholders of the corporation. To reduce the effect of 
the principal–agent problem, many boards of directors in the 1990s began to tie the 
salaries of top managers to the profits of the firm or to the price of the firm’s stock. 
They hoped this would give top managers an incentive to make the firm as profitable 
as possible, thereby benefiting its shareholders. Sometimes, though, top managers 
would take steps that increased the profits of the firm in the short run—and the 
salaries and bonuses of the top managers—but that actually reduced the profits of the 
firm in the long run.
8.2 LEARNING OBJECTIVE
Describe the typical 
management structure of 
corporations and understand 
the concepts of separation of 
ownership from control and the 
principal–agent problem.
Corporate governance The way in 
which a corporation is structured and 
the effect that structure has on the

Separation of ownership from

in which the top management, rather 
than the shareholders, control day-to-
day operations.
Principal–agent problem A problem 
caused by an agent pursuing his own 
interests rather than the interests of 
the principal who hired him.
1In Chapter 7, we saw that the principal–agent problem arises from moral hazard that can occur 
because of asymmetric information. In this case, the asymmetric information involves top managers 
knowing more about how the firm is actually run than do the firm’s shareholders.

Solving the Problem
Step 1: Review the chapter material. This problem concerns the principal–agent 
problem, so you may want to review the section “Corporate Structure and 
Corporate Governance” on page 241.
Step 2: Evaluate the argument. You should agree with the argument. A corpora-
tion’s shareholders have difficulty monitoring the activities of top managers. 
In practice, they attempt to do so indirectly through the corporation’s board 
of directors. But the firm’s top managers may influence—or even control—the 
firm’s board of directors. Even if top managers do not control a board of di-
rectors, it may be difficult for the board to know whether actions managers 
take—such as opening a branch office in Paris—will increase the profitability 
of the firm or just increase the enjoyment of the top managers.
To answer the problem, we must extend this analysis to the relationship 
between managers and workers: Managers would like employees to work as 
hard as possible. Employees would often rather not work hard, particularly 
if they do not see a direct financial reward for doing so. Managers can have 
trouble monitoring whether employees are working hard or goofing off. (Is 
that employee in his cubicle diligently staring at a computer screen because he 
is hard at work on a report or because he is surfing the Web for sports scores 
or posting to his Facebook page?) So, the principal–agent problem does apply 
to the relationship between managers and employees.
Extra Credit: Boards of directors try to reduce the principal–agent problem by de-
signing compensation policies for top managers that give them financial incentives 
to increase profits. Similarly, managers try to reduce the principal–agent problem by 
 designing compensation policies that give workers an incentive to work harder. For ex-
ample, some manufacturers pay factory workers on the basis of how much they produce 
rather than on the basis of how many hours they work.

Solved Problem 8.2
Does the Principal–Agent Problem Apply to the Relationship  
between Managers and Employees?
Briefly explain whether you agree with the following 
argument:
The principal–agent problem applies not just to the re-
lationship between shareholders and top managers. It 
also applies to the relationship between managers and 
workers. Just as shareholders have trouble monitor-
ing whether top managers are earning as much profit 
as  possible, managers have trouble monitoring whether 
employees are working as hard as possible.
How Firms Raise Funds
Owners and managers of firms try to earn a profit. To earn a profit, a firm must raise 
funds to pay for its operations, including paying its employees and buying or renting 
computers and other machinery and equipment. Indeed, a central challenge for anyone 
running a firm, whether that person is a sole proprietor or a top manager of a large cor-
poration, is raising the funds needed to operate and expand the business. Suppose you 
decide to open an online social networking site, using $100,000 you have saved in a bank. 
8.3 LEARNING OBJECTIVE
Explain how firms raise the 
funds they need to operate 
and expand.

 
How Firms Raise Funds 
243
You use the $100,000 to rent a building for your firm, to buy computers, and to pay other 
start-up expenses. Your firm is a great success, and you decide to expand by moving to 
a larger building and buying more computers. As the owner of a small business, you can 
raise the funds for this expansion in three ways:
 1. If you are making a profit, you could reinvest the profits back into your firm. Profits 
that are reinvested in a firm rather than taken out of a firm and paid to the firm’s 
owners are retained earnings.
 2. You could raise funds by recruiting additional owners to invest in the firm. This 
arrangement would increase the firm’s financial capital.
 3. Finally, you could borrow the funds from relatives, friends, or a bank.
The managers of a large public firm have some additional ways to raise funds, as we 
will see in the next section.
Sources of External Funds
Unless firms rely on retained earnings, they have to raise the external funds they need 
from others who have funds available to invest. It is the role of an economy’s financial 
system to transfer funds from savers to borrowers—directly through financial markets 
or indirectly through financial intermediaries such as banks.
Most firms raise external funds in two ways. The first way relies on financial in-
termediaries such as banks and is called indirect finance. If you put $1,000 in a check-
ing account or a savings account, or if you put money in a $1,000 certificate of deposit 
(CD), the bank will loan most of those funds to borrowers. The bank will combine your 
funds with those of other depositors and, for example, make a $100,000 loan to a local 
business. Small businesses rely heavily on bank loans as their primary source of external 
funds.
A second way for firms to acquire external funds is through financial markets. Rais-
ing funds in these markets, such as the New York Stock Exchange on Wall Street in New 
York, is called direct finance. Direct finance usually takes the form of the borrower 
selling the lender a financial security. A financial security is a document—sometimes 
in electronic form—that states the terms under which the funds have passed from the 
buyer of the security (who is lending funds) to the borrower. Bonds and stocks are the 
two main types of financial securities. Typically, only large corporations are able to sell 
bonds and stocks on financial markets. Investors are generally unwilling to buy securi-
ties issued by small and medium-sized firms because the investors lack sufficient infor-
mation on the financial health of smaller firms.
Bonds Bonds are financial securities that represent promises to repay a fixed amount 
of funds. When General Electric (GE) sells a bond to raise funds, it promises to pay the 
purchaser of the bond an interest payment each year for the term of the bond, as well 
as a final payment of the amount of the loan, or the principal, at the end of the term. 
GE may need to raise many millions of dollars to build a factory, but each individual 
bond has a principal, or face value, of $1,000, which is the amount each bond purchaser 
is lending GE. So, GE must sell many bonds to raise all the funds it needs. Suppose GE 
promises it will pay interest of $60 per year to anyone who buys one of its bonds. The in-
terest payments on a bond are referred to as coupon payments. The interest rate is the 
cost of borrowing funds, usually expressed as a percentage of the amount borrowed. If 
we express the coupon as a percentage of the face value of the bond, we find the interest 
rate on the bond, called the coupon rate. In this case, the interest rate is:
+60
+1,000 = 0.06, or 6%.
Many bonds that corporations issue have terms, or maturities, of 30 years. In this 
example, if you bought a bond from GE, GE would pay you $60 per year for 30 years, 
and at the end of the thirtieth year, GE would repay the $1,000 principal to you.
The interest rate that a borrower selling a bond has to pay depends on how likely 
bond buyers—investors—think that the bond seller is to default, or not make the 
Indirect finance A flow of funds 
from savers to borrowers through 
financial intermediaries such as 
banks. Intermediaries raise funds 
from savers to lend to firms (and 
other borrowers).
Direct finance A flow of funds from 
savers to firms through financial 
markets, such as the New York Stock 
Exchange.
Bond A financial security that 
represents a promise to repay a fixed 
amount of funds.

payment on a bond.
Interest rate The cost of borrowing

promised coupon or principal payments. The higher the default risk on a bond, the 
higher the interest rate. For example, investors see the federal government as being very 
unlikely to default on its bonds, so federal government bonds pay a lower interest rate 
than do bonds of a firm such as GE. In turn, GE pays a lower interest rate on its bonds 
than does a corporation that investors believe is not as likely to make its bond payments.
The Rating Game: Is the U.S. Treasury 
Likely to Default on Its Bonds?
Federal regulations require that before they can sell bonds to 
investors, firms and governments must first have bonds rated 
by one of the credit rating agencies. The three largest rating agencies are Moody’s Inves-
tors Service, Standard & Poor’s Corporation, and Fitch Ratings. These private firms rate 
bonds by giving them letter grades—AAA or Aaa being the highest—that reflect the 
probability that the firm or government will be able to make the payments on the bond. 
The following table shows the ratings:

Note: The entries in the “Meaning of the Ratings” column are slightly modified from those that Fitch uses. The 
other two rating agencies have similar descriptions. For each rating from Aa to Caa, Moody’s adds a numerical 
modifier of 1, 2, or 3. The rating Aa1 is higher than the rating Aa2, and the rating Aa2 is higher than the rating 
Aa3. Similarly, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings add a plus (+) or minus (−) sign. The rating AA+ is higher than 
the rating AA, and the rating AA is higher than the rating AA−.

Investors can use the ratings in deciding how much risk they are willing to take 
on when buying a bond. Generally, the lower the rating, the higher the interest rate an 
investor will receive, but also the higher the risk that the issuer of the bond will default.
The ratings agencies charge firms and governments—rather than investors—for 
their services. This arrangement raises the question of whether rating agencies face a 
conflict of interest. Because firms issuing bonds can choose which of the agencies to 
hire to rate their bonds, the agencies may have an incentive to give higher ratings than 
might be justified in order to keep the firms’ business. During the housing boom of the 
mid-2000s, some financial firms issued mortgage-backed bonds. These bonds were simi-
lar to regular corporate bonds except that the interest payments came from mortgage 
loans people had taken out to buy houses. The money from those mortgage payments 
was passed along to investors who had bought the mortgage-backed bonds. The rat-
ing agencies gave many of these bonds AAA ratings, even though when housing prices 
began to decline in 2006, the issuers of many of these bonds defaulted on them. Some 
economists and policymakers believe the rating agencies provided the high ratings pri-
marily to ensure that the firms that issued them would continue to hire them.

 
How Firms Raise Funds 
245
Stocks When you buy a newly issued bond from a firm, you are lending funds to that 
firm. When you buy stock issued by a firm, you are actually buying part ownership of 
the firm. When a corporation sells stock, it is doing the same thing the owner of a small 
business does when she takes on a partner: The firm is increasing its financial capital by 
bringing additional owners into the firm. Any individual shareholder usually owns only 
a small fraction of the total shares of stock issued by a corporation.
A shareholder is entitled to a share of the corporation’s profits, if there are any. Cor-
porations generally keep some of their profits—known as retained earnings—to finance 
future expansion. The remaining profits are paid to shareholders as dividends. Inves-
tors hope that a firm will earn economic profits by using its retained earnings to grow, 
causing the firm’s share price to rise, and providing a capital gain for investors. If a cor-
poration is unable to make a profit, it usually does not pay a dividend. Under the law, 
corporations must make payments on any debt they have before making payments to 
their owners. That is, a corporation must make promised payments to bondholders be-
fore it can make any dividend payments to shareholders. In addition, when firms sell 
stock, they acquire from investors an open-ended commitment of funds to the firm.
Unlike bonds, stocks do not have a maturity date, so the firm is not obliged to  
return the investor’s funds at any particular date.
Stock and Bond Markets Provide Capital— 
and Information
The original purchasers of stocks and bonds may resell them to other investors. In fact, 
most of the buying and selling of stocks and bonds that takes place each day involves in-
vestors reselling existing stocks and bonds to each other rather than corporations selling 
new stocks and bonds to investors. The buyers and sellers of stocks and bonds together

Standard & Poor’s (S&P) became involved in another controversy in August 2011, 
when it downgraded U.S. Treasury bonds from AAA to AA+. This was the first time 
since the rating agencies had begun rating Treasury bonds that any of them had given 
Treasury bonds less than a AAA rating. The reason for the rating downgrade was the 
state of the federal government’s budget deficit. Whenever the federal government runs 
a budget deficit, the Treasury must borrow an amount equal to the deficit by issuing 
bonds. In 2011, the federal government was spending much more than it was collecting 
in taxes, resulting in a large budget deficit. The budget deficit reflected the lower tax 
receipts and increased government spending resulting from the 2007–2009 economic 
recession. But forecasts from the U.S. Congressional Budget Office indicated that even 
after the effects of the recession had disappeared, large budget deficits would remain 
because spending on Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and other government pro-
grams were expected to increase faster than tax revenues. When prolonged negotiations 
between President Barack Obama and Congress failed to make much of a dent in the 
problem, S&P announced the rating downgrade. In the days following the announce-
ment, interest rates on Treasury bonds actually fell rather than rising, as might have 
been expected if investors had believed that a default was possible.
So, is it likely that the U.S. Treasury will default on its bonds? S&P argued that while 
a default is still unlikely, the continuing large deficits increased the chance that some-
day the Treasury might not make the interest payments on its bonds. Like the Ghost 
of Christmas Yet to Come in Charles Dickens’s A Christmas Carol, S&P was giving a 
warning of something that might happen rather than something that necessarily must 
happen.

make up the stock and bond markets. There is no single place where stocks and bonds 
are bought and sold. Some trading of stocks and bonds takes place in buildings known 
as exchanges, such as the New York Stock Exchange or the Tokyo Stock Exchange. In the 
United States, the stocks and bonds of the largest corporations are traded on the New 
York Stock Exchange. The development of computer technology has spread the trading 
of stocks and bonds outside exchanges to securities dealers linked by computers. These 
dealers comprise the over-the-counter market. The stocks of many computer and other 
high-technology firms—including Apple, Google, and Microsoft—are traded in the 
most important of the over-the-counter markets, the National Association of Securities 
Dealers Automated Quotations system, which is referred to by its acronym, NASDAQ.
Shares of stock represent claims on the profits of the firms that issue them. There-
fore, as the fortunes of the firms change and they earn more or less profit, the prices of 
the stock the firms have issued should also change. Similarly, bonds represent claims 
to receive coupon payments and one final payment of principal. Therefore, a particu-
lar bond that was issued in the past may have its price go up or down, depending on 
whether the coupon payments being offered on newly issued bonds are higher or lower 
than on existing bonds. If you hold a bond with a coupon of $40 per year, and newly 
issued bonds have coupons of $50 per year, the price of your bond will fall because it is 
less attractive to investors. The price of a bond will also be affected by changes in default 
risk, or the investors’ perceptions of the issuing firm’s ability to make the coupon pay-
ments. For example, if investors begin to believe that a firm may soon go out of business 
and stop making coupon payments to its bondholders, the price of the firm’s bonds will 
fall to very low levels.
Changes in the value of a firm’s stocks and bonds offer important information for 
a firm’s managers, as well as for investors. An increase in the stock price means that 
investors are more optimistic about the firm’s profit prospects, and the firm’s manag-
ers might want to expand the firm’s operations as a result. By contrast, a decrease in 
the firm’s stock price indicates that investors are less optimistic about the firm’s profit 
When Google Shares Change Hands, 
Google Doesn’t Get the Money
Google is a popular investment, with investors buying 
and selling shares often as their views about the value of 
the firm shift. That’s great for Google, right? Think of all 
that money flowing into Google’s coffers as shares change 
hands and the stock price goes up. Wrong. Google raises 
funds in a primary market, but shares change hands in a 
secondary market. Those trades don’t put money into 
Google’s hands, but they do give important information to 
the firm’s managers. Let’s see why.
Primary markets are those in which newly issued 
claims are sold to initial buyers by the issuer. Businesses 
can raise funds in a primary financial market in two 
ways—by borrowing (selling bonds) or by selling shares of 
stock—which result in different types of claims on the bor-
rowing firm’s future income. Although you may hear about 
the stock market fluctuations every day in news  updates, 
bonds actually account for more of the funds raised by 
borrowers. The total value of bonds in the United States is 
typically about twice the value of stocks.
In secondary markets, stocks and bonds that have al-
ready been issued are sold by one investor to another. If 
Google sells shares to the public, it is turning to a pri-
mary market for new funds. Once Google shares are is-
sued, investors trade the shares in the secondary market. 
Google does not receive any new funds when Google 
shares are traded on secondary markets. The initial seller 
of a stock or bond raises funds from a lender only in the 
primary market. Secondary markets convey information 
to firms’ managers and to investors by determining the 
price of stocks and bonds. For example, a major increase 
in Google’s stock price conveys the market’s good feel-
ings about the firm, and the firm may decide to raise 
funds to expand. So, secondary markets are valuable 
sources of information for corporations that are consid-
ering raising funds.
Primary and secondary markets are both important, 
but they play different roles. As an investor, you principally 
trade stocks and bonds in a secondary market. As a corpo-
rate manager, you may help decide how to raise new funds 
to expand the firm where you work.

prospects, so management may want to shrink the firm’s operations. Likewise, changes 
in the value of the firm’s bonds imply changes in the cost of external funds to finance the 
firm’s investment in research and development or in new factories. A higher bond price 
indicates a lower cost of new external funds, while a lower bond price indicates a higher 
cost of new external funds.
Why Do Stock Prices Fluctuate So Much?
The performance of the U.S. stock market is often measured using stock market indexes. 
Stock market indexes are averages of stock prices with the value of the index set equal to 
100 in a particular year, called the base year. Because the stock indexes are intended to 
show movements in prices from one year to the next, rather than the actual dollar values 
of the underlying stocks, the year chosen for the base year is unimportant. Figure 8.2 
shows movements from January 1995 to September 2011 in the three most widely fol-
lowed stock indexes:
• 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which is an index of the stock prices of 30 large 
U.S. corporations.
• 
The S&P 500, which is an index prepared by Standard & Poor’s Corporation and 
includes the stock prices of 500 large U.S. firms.
• 
The NASDAQ Composite Index, which includes the stock prices of the more than 
4,000 firms whose shares are traded in the NASDAQ stock market. NASDAQ is an 
“over-the-counter” market, meaning that buying and selling on NASDAQ is carried 
out between dealers who are linked together by computer. The listings on NASDAQ 
are dominated by high-tech firms such as Apple, Microsoft, and Google.
As we have seen, ownership of a firm’s stock represents a claim on the firm’s profits. 
So, the larger the firm’s profits are, the higher its stock price will be. When the overall 
economy is expanding, incomes, employment, and spending will all increase, as will 
corporate profits. When the economy is in a recession, incomes, employment, and 
spending will fall, as will corporate profits. We would expect that stock prices will rise 
when the economy is expanding and fall when the economy is in recession. We see this 
pattern reflected in the three stock market indexes in Figure 8.2. All three indexes fol-
low a roughly similar pattern: Increases in stock prices during the economic expansion 
of the late 1990s, declines after the “dot-com crash” of 2000 and the recession of 2001, 
increases from late 2001 to late 2007, declines as the U.S. economy entered a recession at 
the end of 2007, and then increases beginning in early 2009.
The stock prices of many early Internet companies soared in the late 1990s, as some 
analysts made what turned out to be overly optimistic predictions about how rapidly

The performance of the U.S. stock market is often measured by market indexes, 
which are averages of stock prices. The three most important indexes are the 
Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500, and the NASDAQ. During the 
period from 1995 to 2011, the three indexes followed similar patterns, rising 
when the U.S. economy was expanding and falling when the economy was in 
recession.

online retailing would grow. In 2000, when investors came to believe that many dot-
coms would never be profitable, their stock prices crashed. Because the NASDAQ is 
dominated by high-tech stocks, it experienced greater swings during the dot-com boom 
and bust of the late 1990s and early 2000s than did the other two indexes. The sharp 
declines in all three indexes beginning in late 2007 reflected the severity of the recession 
that began in December of that year. The severity of the recession was due in part to 
problems with financial firms, which we will discuss later in this chapter.
Following Abercrombie & Fitch’s Stock 
Price in the Financial Pages
If you read the online stock listings on the Wall Street  Journal’s 
web site or on another site, you will notice that the listings 
pack into a small space a lot of information about what happened to stocks during the 
previous day’s trading. The figure on the next page reproduces a small portion of the 
listings from the Wall Street Journal from August 9, 2011, for stocks listed on the New 
York Stock Exchange. The listings provide information on the buying and selling of the 
stock of five firms during the previous day. Let’s focus on the highlighted listing for 
Abercrombie & Fitch, the clothing store, and examine the information in each column:
• The first column gives the name of the company.
• The second column gives the firm’s “ticker” symbol (ANF), which you may have 
seen scrolling along the bottom of the screen on cable financial news channels.
• The third column (Open) gives the price (in dollars) of the stock at the time that 
trading began, which is 9:30 a.m. on the New York Stock Exchange. Abercrombie 
& Fitch opened for trading at a price of $67.85.
• The fourth column (High) and the fifth column (Low) give the highest price and 
the lowest price the stock sold for during the day.
• The sixth column (Close) gives the price the stock sold for the last time it was 
traded before the close of trading (4:00 p.m.), which in this case was $61.05.
• The seventh column (Net Chg) gives the amount by which the closing price 
changed from the closing price the day before. In this case, the price of Aber-
crombie & Fitch’s stock had fallen by $9.25 per share from its closing price the day 
before. Changes in Abercrombie & Fitch’s stock price give the firm’s managers a 
signal that they may want to expand or contract the firm’s operations.
• The eighth column (%Chg) gives the change in the price in percentage terms 
rather than in dollar terms.
• The ninth column (Vol) gives the number of shares of stock traded on the previous day.
• The tenth column (52 Week High) and the eleventh column (52 Week Low) give 
the highest price the stock has sold for and the lowest price the stock has sold for 
during the previous year. These numbers tell how volatile the stock price is—that 
is, how much it fluctuates over the course of the year. In this case, Abercrombie’s 
stock had been quite volatile, rising as high as $78.25 per share and falling as low 
as $33.97 per share. These large fluctuations in price are an indication of how risky 
investing in the stock market can be.
• The twelfth column (Div) gives the dividend, expressed in dollars. In this case, 
0.70 means that Abercrombie paid a dividend of $0.70 per share.
• The thirteenth column (Yield) gives the dividend yield, which is calculated by di-
viding the dividend by the closing price of the stock—that is, the price at which 
Abercrombie’s stock last sold before the close of trading on the previous day.
• The fourteenth column (PE) gives the P-E ratio (or price–earnings ratio), which 
is calculated by dividing the price of the firm’s stock by its earnings per share. 
 (Remember that because firms retain some earnings, earnings per share is not nec-
essarily the same as dividends per share.) Abercrombie’s P-E ratio was 37, meaning 
that its price per share was 37 times its earnings per share. So, you would have to 
pay $37 to buy $1 of Abercrombie & Fitch’s earnings.

Using Financial Statements to Evaluate 
a Corporation
To raise funds, a firm’s managers must persuade banks or buyers of its stocks or bonds 
that it will be profitable. Before a firm can sell new issues of stocks or bonds, it must 
first provide investors and financial regulators with information about its finances. To 
borrow from a bank or another financial intermediary, the firm must disclose financial 
information to the lender as well.
In most high-income countries, government agencies require firms to disclose spe-
cific financial information to the public before they are allowed to sell securities such as 
stocks or bonds in financial markets. In the United States, the Securities and Exchange 
Commission requires publicly owned firms to report their performance in financial 
statements prepared using standard accounting methods, often referred to as generally 
accepted accounting principles. Such disclosure reduces information costs, but it doesn’t 
eliminate them—for two reasons. First, some firms may be too young to have much 
information for potential investors to evaluate. Second, managers may try to present 
the required information in the best possible light so that investors will overvalue their 
securities.
Private firms also collect information on business borrowers and sell the informa-
tion to lenders and investors. If the information-gathering firm does a good job, lenders 
and investors purchasing the information will be better able to judge the quality of bor-
rowing firms. Firms specializing in information—including Moody’s Investors Service, 
Standard & Poor’s Corporation, Value Line, and Dun & Bradstreet—collect information 
from businesses and sell it to subscribers. Buyers include individual investors, libraries, 
and financial intermediaries. You can find some of these publications in your college 
library or through online information services.
What kind of information do investors and firm managers need? A firm must answer 
three basic questions: What to produce? How to produce it? and What price to charge? 
To answer these questions, a firm’s managers need two pieces of information: The first is

the firm’s revenues and costs, and the second is the value of the property and other as-
sets the firm owns and the firm’s debts, or other liabilities, that it owes to other persons 
and firms. Potential investors in the firm also need this information to decide whether to 
buy the firm’s stocks or bonds. This information is contained in the firm’s financial state-
ments, principally its income statement and balance sheet, which we discuss next.
The Income Statement
A firm’s income statement sums up its revenues, costs, and profit over a period of time. 
Corporations issue annual income statements, although the 12-month fiscal year covered 
may be different from the calendar year to better represent the seasonal pattern of the 
business. We explore income statements in greater detail in the appendix to this chapter.
Getting to Accounting Profit An income statement shows a firm’s revenue, costs, 
and profit for the firm’s fiscal year. To determine profitability, the income statement 
starts with the firm’s revenue and subtracts its operating expenses and taxes paid. The 
remainder, net income, is the accounting profit of the firm.
. . . And Economic Profit Accounting profit provides information on a firm’s cur-
rent net income, measured according to accepted accounting standards. Accounting 
profit is not, however, the ideal measure of a firm’s profits because it neglects some of 
the firm’s costs. By taking into account all costs, economic profit provides a better indi-
cation than accounting profit of how successful a firm is. Firms making an economic 
profit will remain in business and may even expand. Firms making an economic loss 
are unlikely to remain in business in the long run. To understand how economic profit 
is calculated, remember that economists always measure cost as opportunity cost. The 
opportunity cost of any activity is the highest-valued alternative that must be given up 
to engage in that activity. Costs are either explicit or implicit. When a firm spends money, 
an explicit cost results. If a firm incurs an opportunity cost but does not spend money, 
an implicit cost results. For example, firms incur an explicit labor cost when they pay 
wages to employees. Firms have many other explicit costs as well, such as the cost of the 
electricity used to light their buildings or the costs of advertising or insurance.
Some costs are implicit, however. The most important of these is the opportunity 
cost to investors of the funds they have invested in the firm. Economists use the term 
nominal rate of return to refer to the minimum amount that investors must earn on 
the funds they invest in a firm, expressed as a percentage of the amount invested. If a 
firm fails to provide investors with at least a normal rate of return, it will not be able to 
remain in business over the long run because investors will not continue to invest their 
funds in the firm. For example, Bethlehem Steel was once the second-leading producer 
of steel in the United States and a very profitable firm, with stock that sold for more than 
$50 per share. By 2002, investors became convinced that the firm’s uncompetitive labor 
costs in world markets meant that the firm would never be able to provide investors 
with a normal rate of return. Many investors expected that the firm would eventually 
have to declare bankruptcy, and as a result, the price of Bethlehem Steel’s stock plum-
meted to $1 per share. Shortly thereafter, the firm declared bankruptcy, and its remain-
ing assets were sold off to a competing steel firm. The return (in dollars) that investors 
require to continue investing in a firm is a true cost to the firm and should be subtracted 
from the firm’s revenues to calculate its profits.
The necessary rate of return that investors must receive to continue investing in 
a firm varies from firm to firm. If the investment is risky—as would be the case with 
a biotechnology start-up—investors may require a high rate of return to compensate 
them for the risk. Investors in firms in more established industries, such as electric utili-
ties, may require lower rates of return. The exact rate of return investors require to in-
vest in any particular firm is difficult to calculate, which also makes it difficult for an 
accountant to include the return as a cost on an income statement. Firms have other 
implicit costs besides the return investors require that can also be difficult to calculate. 
As a result, the rules of accounting generally require that only explicit costs be included

in the firm’s financial records. Economic costs include both explicit costs and implicit 
costs. Economic profit is equal to a firm’s revenues minus its economic costs. Because 
accounting profit excludes some implicit costs, it is larger than economic profit.
The Balance Sheet
A firm’s balance sheet sums up its financial position on a particular day, usually the 
end of a quarter or year. Recall that an asset is anything of value that a firm owns, and a  
liability is a debt or an obligation owed by a firm. Subtracting the value of a firm’s li-
abilities from the value of its assets leaves its net worth. We can think of the net worth as 
what the firm’s owners would be left with if the firm were closed, its assets were sold, 
and its liabilities were paid off. Investors can determine a firm’s net worth by inspect-
ing its balance sheet. We analyze a balance sheet in more detail in the appendix to this 
 chapter, which begins on page 263.
Corporate Governance Policy 
and the Financial Crisis of 2007–2009
A firm’s financial statements provide important information on the firm’s ability to cre-
ate value for investors and the economy. Accurate and easy-to-understand financial 
statements are inputs to decisions by the firm’s managers and by investors. Indeed, the 
information in accounting statements helps guide resource allocation in the economy.
Firms disclose financial statements in periodic filings to the federal government 
and in annual reports to shareholders. An investor is more likely to buy a firm’s stock if 
the firm’s income statement shows a large after-tax profit and if its balance sheet shows a 
large net worth. The top management of a firm has at least two reasons to attract inves-
tors and keep the firm’s stock price high. First, a higher stock price increases the funds 
the firm can raise when it sells a given amount of stock. Second, to reduce the principal–
agent problem, boards of directors often tie the salaries of top managers to the firm’s 
stock price or to the profitability of the firm.
Top managers clearly have an incentive to maximize the profits reported on the in-
come statement and the net worth reported on the balance sheet. If top managers make 
good decisions, the firm’s profits will be high, and the firm’s assets will be large relative 
to its liabilities. Problems that surfaced during the early 2000s, however, revealed that 
some top managers have inflated profits and hidden liabilities that should have been 
listed on their balance sheets. At other firms, managers took on more risk than they 
disclosed to investors. We will explore recent problems with corporate governance, and 
the government’s reaction to these problems, by discussing the accounting scandals of 
the early 2000s and problems that many financial firms encountered during 2007–2009.
The Accounting Scandals of the Early 2000s
In the early 2000s, the top managers of several large and well-known firms, includ-
ing Enron, an energy trading firm, and WorldCom, a telecommunications firm, were 
shown to have falsified their firms’ financial statements in order to mislead investors 
about how profitable the firms actually were. Several top managers were sentenced to 
long jail terms, and some of the firms, including Enron, went out of business.
How was it possible for corporations such as Enron and WorldCom to falsify their 
financial statements? The federal government regulates how financial statements are 
prepared, but this regulation cannot by itself guarantee the accuracy of the statements. 
All firms that issue stock to the public have certified public accountants audit their fi-
nancial statements. Unfortunately, as the Enron and WorldCom scandals revealed, top 
managers who are determined to deceive investors about the true financial condition of 
their firms can also deceive outside auditors.
To guard against future scandals, new federal legislation was enacted in 2002. The 
landmark Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that CEOs personally certify the accuracy 
of financial statements. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act also requires that financial analysts and

auditors disclose whether any conflicts of interest might exist that would limit their 
independence in evaluating a firm’s financial condition. On balance, most observers 
acknowledge that the Sarbanes-Oxley Act increased confidence in the U.S. corporate 
governance system. However, as we will discuss in the next section, problems dur-
ing 2007–2009 at financial firms again raised questions of whether corporations were  
adequately disclosing information to investors.
The Financial Crisis of 2007–2009
Beginning in 2007 and lasting into 2009, the U.S. economy suffered the worst financial 
crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s. At the heart of the crisis was a problem 
in the market for home mortgages. When people buy houses, they typically borrow the 
money by taking out a mortgage loan from a bank or another financial institution. The 
house they are buying is pledged as collateral for the loan, meaning that the bank can 
take possession of the house and sell it if the borrower defaults by failing to make the 
payments on the loan.
For many years, the bank or other financial institution granting a mortgage would 
keep the loan until the borrower had paid it off. Beginning in the 1970s, financial insti-
tutions began securitizing some mortgage loans, which means that groups of mortgages 
were bundled together and sold to investors. These mortgage-backed securities are very 
similar to bonds in that the investor who buys one receives regular interest payments, 
which in this case come from the payments being made on the original mortgage loans. 
At first, the securitization process was carried out by the Federal National Mortgage As-
sociation (“Fannie Mae”) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie 
Mac”), which Congress had established to help increase the volume of lending in the 
home mortgage market. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would buy mortgages granted to 
credit-worthy borrowers and bundle them into securities that were then sold to investors.
Beginning in the 1990s, private financial firms, primarily investment banks, started 
to securitize mortgages. By the early 2000s, many mortgages were being granted by 
banks and other financial institutions to “subprime” borrowers, who are borrowers 
whose credit histories include failures to make payments on bills, and “Alt-A” borrowers, 
who failed to document that their incomes were high enough to afford their mortgage 
payments. Both subprime and Alt-A borrowers were more likely to default on loans 
than were conventional borrowers. Fueled by the ease of obtaining a mortgage, housing 
prices in the United States soared before beginning a sharp downturn in mid-2006. By 
2007, many borrowers—particularly subprime and Alt-A borrowers—began to default 
on their mortgages. This was bad news for anyone owning mortgage-backed securities 
because the value of these securities depended on steady payments being made on the 
underlying mortgages. As prices of these securities plunged, many financial institutions 
suffered heavy losses, and some of the largest of them remained in business only be-
cause they received aid from the federal government.
During the financial crisis, many investors complained that they weren’t aware of 
the riskiness of some of the assets—particularly mortgage-backed securities—on the 
balance sheets of financial firms. Some observers believed that the managers of many 
 financial firms had intentionally misled investors about the riskiness of these assets. 
Others argued that the managers themselves had not understood how risky the assets 
were. In the fall of 2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were brought under direct con-
trol of the government. As the crisis passed, in July 2010, Congress overhauled regula-
tion of the financial system with the passage of the Wall Street Reform and Consumer 
Protection  Act, referred to as the Dodd-Frank Act. Among its provisions, the act 
 created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, housed in the Federal Reserve, to 
write rules intended to protect consumers in their borrowing and investing activities. 
The act also established the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which includes repre-
sentatives from all the major federal financial regulatory bodies, including the SEC and 
the Federal Reserve. The council is intended to identify and act on risks to the financial 
system. Economists are divided in their opinions about whether the Dodd-Frank Act 
will significantly reduce the risk of future financial crises.

Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act)

was intended to reform regulation of 
the financial system.

Did Principal–Agent Problems Help Bring  
on the Financial Crisis?
As we have seen, the process of securitizing mortgages played an important role in the 
financial crisis of 2007–2009. Beginning in the 1990s, private investment banks began 
to securitize mortgages. Unlike commercial banks, whose main activities are accepting 
deposits and making loans, investment banks had traditionally concentrated on provid-
ing advice to corporations on selling new stocks and bonds and on underwriting the is-
suance of stocks and bonds by guaranteeing a price to the firm selling them. Investment 
banking is considered more risky than commercial banking because investment banks 
can suffer heavy losses on underwriting. To address this greater risk, Congress passed 
the Glass-Steagall Act in 1933. The act prevented financial firms from being both com-
mercial banks and investment banks.
Some economists and policymakers argued that Glass-Steagall reduced competition 
for investment banking services by prohibiting commercial banks from offering these 
services. Congress repealed the Glass-Steagall Act in 1999, after which some commer-
cial banks began engaging in investment banking. Many of the largest, best-known in-
vestment banks, such as Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns, Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, 
and Morgan Stanley, remained exclusively investment banks. The mortgage-backed 
securities originated by the investment banks were mostly sold to investors, but some 
were retained as investments by these firms. As a result, when the prices of these securi-
ties declined beginning in 2007, the investment banks suffered heavy losses. Lehman 
Brothers was forced to declare bankruptcy, Merrill Lynch and Bear Stearns were sold 
to commercial banks in deals arranged by the U.S. government, and Goldman Sachs 
and Morgan Stanley became bank holding companies, which allowed them to engage in 
commercial banking activity. With these developments, the era of the large Wall Street 
investment bank came to an end.
Why did the investment banks take on so much risk by originating securities 
backed by mortgages granted to borrowers who had a high likelihood of defaulting on 
the loans? Michael Lewis, a financial journalist and former Wall Street bond salesman, 
has argued that a key reason was a change in how the investment banks were organized. 
Traditionally, Wall Street investment banks had been organized as partnerships, but by 
2000 they had all converted to being publicly traded corporations. As we have seen, in 
a partnership the funds of the relatively small group of owners are put directly at risk, 
and the principal–agent problem is reduced because there is little separation of owner-
ship from control. With a publicly traded corporation, on the other hand, the principal–
agent problem can be severe. Lewis argues:
No investment bank owned by its employees would have . . . bought 
and held $50 billion in [exotic mortgage-backed securities]. . . . or 
even allow [these securities] to be sold to its customers. The hoped-for 
short-term gain would not have justified the long-term hit.
Issues of corporate governance will clearly continue to be a concern for economists, pol-
icymakers, and investors.
Are Buyers of Facebook Stock  
Getting a Fair Deal?
Many technology firms, including Facebook, turn to venture 
capital firms for funds. These firms raise funds from investors 
and use the funds to make investments in small start-up firms. A venture capital firm 
frequently takes a large ownership stake in a start-up firm, often placing its own em-
ployees on the board of directors or even having them serve as managers. These steps 
can reduce principal–agent problems because the venture capital firm has a greater abil-
ity to closely monitor the managers. The firm’s managers will probably be attentive to

the wishes of a large investor because having a large investor sell 
its stake in the firm may make it difficult to raise funds from new 
investors.
Several venture capital funds, including Accel Partners, invested 
in Facebook. If a start-up firm becomes successful, then it will typi-
cally become a public firm by issuing stock. The first issue of stock 
by a firm is called an initial public offering (IPO). The IPO makes it 
possible for the venture capital firm to easily sell its ownership share 
of the firm to other investors. In the case of Facebook, though, CEO 
Mark Zuckerberg was reluctant to allow an IPO because he wanted 
to keep the company private rather than bring in many additional 
investors, which could reduce his control of the firm. The lack of 
an IPO meant that Accel, other venture capital firms, and Face-
book employees who had received stock could not easily “cash out” 
by selling their shares. As we saw at the beginning of the chapter, 
though, it is possible for private firms to sell a limited amount of stock. These sales don’t 
take place on the New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ but are arranged by firms such 
as SharesPost and SecondMarket, which match up sellers of stock in private firms with 
buyers. These sales are sometimes called private placements, and the market for shares 
of private firms is sometimes referred to as the shadow market to distinguish it from the 
stock markets on which shares of public firms are traded. Trading in private-company 
shares has been increasing rapidly; it doubled from 2009 to 2010 and was expected to 
grow by 50 percent during 2011.
Only so-called accredited investors are eligible to buy shares of private firms. An 
investor is accredited if he or she has an income of $200,000 or more for at least the 
previous two years or has a net worth of $1 million. A private company cannot have 
more than 499 individual shareholders. Because the Securities and Exchange Commis-
sion (SEC)  assumes that accredited investors are experienced and sophisticated, the mar-
ket for shares of private firms is not closely regulated. In particular, private firms do not 
have to disclose their financial statements, such as their income statements and balance 
sheets, as public firms do. Some economists and policymakers, though, worry that there 
is potential for sellers of shares in a private firm to take advantage of buyers because the 
insiders selling the shares have information about the firm’s financial statements that the 
investors do not. For instance, in mid-2011, stock in Facebook was selling for about $35 
per share, which would make the total value of the firm about $80 billion. Was Facebook 
really worth that much? It was difficult to tell because the firm did not have to make pub-
lic its revenue or profits.
As the SEC considered changing the regulations governing the sale of shares in pri-
vate firms, it faced conflicting pressures. Some economists and policymakers wanted the 
SEC to require private firms to disclose more information to potential investors. Others 
argued that the SEC should relax some of the existing regulations to make it easier for 
start-ups to raise funds without having to meet all of the requirements to become a pub-
licly traded firm. In late 2011, it was unclear which way the SEC would move, although 
it did appear to be favoring a proposal to raise the limit on the number of shareholders 
allowed in a private firm.

Conclusion
In a market system, firms make independent decisions about which goods and services 
to produce, how to produce them, and what prices to charge. In modern high-income 
countries, such as the United States, large corporations account for a majority of the 
sales and profits earned by firms. Generally, the managers of these corporations do a 
good job of representing the interests of stockholders while providing the goods and 
services demanded by consumers. As the business scandals of the early 2000s and the 
problems with financial firms in 2007–2009 showed, however, the principal–agent prob-
lem can sometimes become severe. Economists debate the costs and benefits of regula-
tions proposed to address these problems.
An Inside Look on the next page discusses how the Web sites SecondMarket and 
SharesPost help qualified investors buy shares of private companies.

Economics in Your Life
Do Corporate Managers Act in the Best Interests of Shareholders?
At the beginning of the chapter, we asked you to consider two questions: Why is it difficult to get 
the managers of a firm to act in your interests rather than in their own? and Given this problem, 
should you ever take on the risk of buying stock? The reason managers may not act in sharehold-
ers’ interest is that in large corporations there is separation of ownership from control: The share-
holders own the firm, but the top managers actually control it. This results in the principal–agent 
problem discussed in the chapter. The principal–agent problem clearly adds to the risk you would 
face by buying stock rather than doing something safe with your money, such as putting it in the 
bank. But the rewards to owning stock can also be substantial, potentially earning you far more 
over the long run than a bank account. Buying the stock of well-known firms, such as Google, that 
are closely followed by Wall Street investment analysts helps to reduce the principal–agent prob-
lem. It is less likely that the managers of these firms will take actions that are clearly not in the best 
interests of shareholders because the managers’ actions are difficult to conceal. Buying the stock 
of large, well-known firms certainly does not completely eliminate the risk from the principal–
agent problem, however. Enron, WorldCom, and some of the other firms that were involved in the 
scandals discussed in this chapter were all well known and closely followed by Wall Street analysts, 
as were the large financial firms that ran into difficulties during the financial crisis of 2007–2009, 
but their stock turned out to be very poor investments.

process that typically takes 48 hours,

you make a purchase, both SharesPost

Privately held stocks don’t trade 
quickly, or even every day. Typically, 
the seller sets a price, but buyers and 
sellers can—and do—haggle. And 
agreeing to a price doesn’t mean the 
trade will actually go through. Mark 
Murphy, a spokesman for Second-
Market, says companies have the right 
of first refusal. So even if the seller 
accepts the deal, his or her company 
has 30 days to check you out to de-
termine if they want you as a share-
holder. If not, the company can deny 
the trade and buy the shares from the 
seller itself. If a trade goes through, 
you can expect to pay a commis-
sion of 2% to 5% of the size of the 
transaction.  Murphy says the typical 
Second Market transaction is about $2 
million. Shares Post says its transac-
tions range from $10,000 to millions 
of dollars.

Goldman Sachs caused a stir in early 
January when word broke that it 
would invest $450 million in Face-

was the news that Goldman would 
create a fund through which its clients 
could buy some $1.5 billion worth of 
shares in the fast-growing, privately 
held social-networking company.
 But you don’t have to be a well-
heeled Goldman client to get in on 
Facebook or other hot, privately held

c Because privately held companies are 
not legally required to release financial 
statements, these investments have the 
potential of being quite risky. Both Second-
Market and SharesPost abide by SEC 
guidelines for accredited investors and re-
quire investors to meet qualifications, 
which include experience in evaluating an 
investment’s risk and having a minimum net 
worth of $1 million or having annual income 
of at least $200,000 over the preceding two 
years. Both companies also require pur-
chased shares to be held for at least one 
year, so these opportunities are designed 
for serious, knowledgeable investors and 
not for casual investors.
Thinking Critically
1. Explain why purchasing shares of a pri-
vately held company such as Facebook 
could be much more risky for investors 
than purchasing shares of a publicly 
traded company.
2. In January 2011, Goldman Sachs an-
nounced it would invest $450 million in 
Facebook. An executive at Facebook 
who knew when this deal would be 
announced could have made money 
quickly by buying Goldman Sachs stock 
and selling it at a higher price a few 
days later. (Goldman Sachs stock went 
up almost $7 a share over a seven-day 
period surrounding the investment.) 
Such “insider trading” is illegal, how-
ever. Do you think that insider trading 
should be illegal? Are there benefits to 
other investors or to the economy as a 
whole associated with insider trading? 
Are there problems associated with in-
sider trading?
which invested $450 million in the social 
networking company. Goldman Sachs then 
offered an opportunity to some of its best 
clients to purchase shares in Facebook. 
Private offerings to top clients are one of 
the few ways investors can buy into private 
companies. Two Web sites, however, are 
now offering investors the opportunity to 
buy shares of private companies from com-
pany insiders and employees, opening the 
door a little wider to investment in private 
companies.
b SecondMarket and SharesPost are two 
Web sites that list for sale shares in pri-
vately held companies. Offerings are limited 
to a total of 190 private stocks but include 
well-known companies such as Facebook 
and Twitter. The figure below shows that 
these numbers are tiny compared to the 
roughly 15,000 publicly traded companies 
represented by the New York Stock Ex-
change, NASDAQ, and stocks traded over-
the-counter. The chapter discusses the 
principal–agent problem, which normally 
does not occur in privately held companies 
where the founder and majority shareholder 
typically runs the company. Management 
and ownership are one and the same, so 
they do not have differing interests. When 
private companies take on investors, own-
ership interests can start to vary from those 
of management, and the principal–agent 
problem can become a reality. With shares 
of privately held companies now being  
offered to a wider variety of investors, the 
principal–agent problem has the potential 
of becoming more significant.
Key Points in the Article
When Goldman Sachs invested in Face-
book in 2011, it also offered some of its 
best clients a chance to purchase shares 
in the company. In addition to companies 
such as Goldman Sachs, two relatively new 
companies, SecondMarket and Shares-
Post, offer qualified investors the chance to 
purchase private company stock from com-
pany insiders and employees who want to 
sell their personal shares. These new firms 
give investors an opportunity to purchase 
stock before a company goes public. Sign-
ing up with SecondMarket and SharesPost 
is a relatively quick process, but both com-
panies require their clients to meet the qual-
ifications of the Securities and Exchange 
Commission’s (SEC’s) definition of an ac-
credited investor.
Analyzing the News
a Some companies are publicly traded, 
and others are privately held. Most 
large corporations are owned by stock-
holders, who through boards of directors 
have the right to hire or fire top managers. 
Publicly traded companies sell stock as a 
way to raise funds. Some large corpora-
tions, such as Facebook, are privately held. 
With a private company, upper manage-
ment has more control of the company 
than if the company were publicly traded, 
but the company must look to alternatives 
such as taking on private investors to raise 
capital. In 2011, Facebook turned to in-
vestment banking firm Goldman Sachs, 
SecondMarket and SharesPost offer 190 private stocks, which is a small number compared with the number of 
stocks that are publicly traded.

Summary
There are three types of firms: A sole proprietorship is a firm 
owned by a single individual and not organized as a corporation. 
A partnership is a firm owned jointly by two or more persons 
and not organized as a corporation. A corporation is a legal 
form of business that provides the owners with limited liability. 
An asset is anything of value owned by a person or a firm. The 
owners of sole proprietorships and partners have unlimited li-
ability, which means there is no legal distinction between the 
personal assets of the owners of the business and the assets of 
the business. The owners of corporations have limited liability, 
which means they can never lose more than their investment in 
the firm. Although only 20 percent of firms are corporations, 
they account for the majority of revenue and profit earned by 
all firms.

Review Questions
 
1.1 What are the three major types of firms in the United 
States? Briefly discuss the most important characteristics 
of each type.
 
1.2 What is limited liability? Why does the government grant 
limited liability to the owners of corporations?
 
1.3 Why is limited liability more important for firms try-
ing to raise funds from a large number of investors than 
for firms trying to raise funds from a small number of 
investors?
Problems and Applications
 1.4 Suppose that shortly after graduating from college, you 
 decide to start your own business. Will you be likely to 
 organize the business as a sole proprietorship, a partner-
ship, or a corporation? Explain your reasoning.
 
1.5 How would the establishment of limited liability for the 
owners of corporations affect the production possibilities 
frontier of a country over time?
 
1.6 Evaluate the following argument:
I would like to invest in the stock market, but 
I think that buying shares of stock in a corpo-
ration is too risky. Suppose I buy $10,000 of 
General Electric stock, and the company ends 
up going bankrupt. Because as a stockholder 
I’m part owner of the company, I might be re-
sponsible for paying hundreds of thousands of 
dollars of the company’s debts.
 
1.7 According to an article in the Economist magazine, his-
torian David Faure has argued that the Chinese economy 
failed to grow rapidly during the nineteenth century be-
cause “family-run companies . . . could not raise sufficient 
capital to exploit the large-scale opportunities tied to the 
rise of the steam engine, notably railways and (with limited 
exceptions) global shipping and automated manufactur-

Summary
Corporate governance refers to the way in which a corpora-
tion is structured and the impact a corporation’s structure has 
on the firm’s behavior. Most corporations have a similar man-
agement structure: The shareholders elect a board of directors 
that appoints the corporation’s top managers, such as the chief 
executive officer (CEO). Because the top management often 
does not own a large fraction of the stock in the corporation, 
large corporations have a separation of ownership from con-
trol. Because top managers have less incentive to increase the 
corporation’s profits than to increase their own salaries and their 
own enjoyment, corporations can suffer from the principal–
agent problem. The principal–agent problem exists when the 
principals—in this case, the shareholders of the corporation—
have difficulty getting the agent—the corporation’s top manage-
ment—to carry out their wishes.

Review Questions
 
2.1 What does it mean to say that there is a separation of 
 ownership from control in large corporations?
 
2.2 How is the separation of ownership from control related to 
the principal–agent problem?
 
2.3 Why is it important for a board of directors to have outside 
directors, as opposed to only inside directors?
Problems and Applications
 
2.4 The principal–agent problem arises almost everywhere 
in the business world, and it also crops up even closer to 
home. Discuss the principal–agent problem that exists in 
the college classroom. Who is the principal? Who is the 
agent? What potential conflicts in objectives are there be-
tween this principal and this agent?
 
2.5 The principal–agent problem in a public corporation be-
tween ownership and top management results from asym-
metric information. What information, if known, would 
prevent this principal–agent problem?
 
2.6 Sales personnel, whether selling life insurance, automo-
biles, or magazine subscriptions, typically get paid on 
commission instead of a straight hourly wage. How does 
paying a commission help solve the principal–agent 
problem between the owner of a business and the sales 
force?
 
2.7 [Related to Solved Problem 8.2 on page 242] Briefly 
explain whether you agree with the following argument: 
“The separation of ownership from control in large cor-
porations and the principal–agent problem mean that top 
managers can work short days, take long vacations, and 
otherwise slack off.”
 2.8 [Related to Solved Problem 8.2 on page 242] The mem-
bers of many corporate boards of directors have to be 
reelected by the firm’s stockholders every year. Some 
corporations, though, have staggered elections for their 
boards of directors, with only one-half or one-third of 
the members being up for election each year. Accord-
ing to an article in the Economist magazine, studies 
have found that firms that have staggered elections for 
their boards of directors are less profitable than similar 
firms where all members of the boards of directors are 
elected each year. Provide a possible explanation for this 
finding.
Based on “A Different Class,” Economist, February 18, 2011.
 
2.9 An article in BusinessWeek states that members of  boards 
of directors believe that, in general, the compensation of 
CEOs is too high. However, most board members believe 
that the compensation of the CEO of their firm is appro-
priate. The article concludes: “Given this and that they 
work for the CEO, it is not surprising that boards continue 
to support high levels of CEO compensation.” How does 
this statement relate to the principal–agent problem?

Summary
Firms rely on retained earnings—which are profits retained by the 
firm and not paid out to the firm’s owners—or on using the savings 
of households for the funds they need to operate and expand. With 
direct finance, the savings of households flow directly to businesses 
when investors buy stocks and bonds in financial markets. With 
indirect finance, savings flow indirectly to businesses when house-
holds deposit money in saving and checking accounts in banks and 
the banks lend these funds to businesses. Federal, state, and local

governments also sell bonds in financial markets, and households 
also borrow funds from banks. When a firm sells a bond, it is bor-
rowing money from the buyer of the bond. The firm makes a cou-
pon payment to the buyer of the bond. The  interest rate is the 
cost of borrowing funds, usually expressed as a percentage of the 
amount borrowed. When a firm sells stock, it is selling part owner-
ship of the firm to the buyer of the stock. Dividends are payments 
by a corporation to its shareholders. The original purchasers of 
stocks and bonds may resell them in stock and bond markets, such 
as the New York Stock Exchange. The performance of the U.S. stock 
market is often measured using stock market indexes. The three 
most widely followed stock indexes are the Dow Jones Industrial 
Average, the S&P 500, and the NASDAQ Composite Index.

Summary
A firm’s income statement sums up its revenues, costs, and profit 
over a period of time. A firm’s balance sheet sums up its financial 
position on a particular day, usually the end of a quarter or year. 
A balance sheet records a firm’s assets and liabilities. A liability is 
anything owed by a person or a firm. Firms report their account-
ing profit on their income statements. Accounting profit does not 
always include all of a firm’s opportunity cost. Explicit cost is a 
cost that involves spending money. Implicit cost is a nonmonetary 
opportunity cost. Because accounting profit excludes some implicit 
costs, it is larger than economic profit.

Summary
Because their compensation often rises with the profitability of the 
corporation, top managers have an incentive to overstate the prof-
its reported on their firm’s income statements. During the early 
2000s, it became clear that the top managers of several large cor-
porations had done this, even though intentionally falsifying fi-
nancial statements is illegal. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 took 
several steps intended to increase the accuracy of financial state-
ments and increase the penalties for falsifying them. The financial 
crisis of 2007–2009 revealed that many financial firms held assets 
that were far riskier than investors had realized. Congress passed 
the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-
Frank Act) in July 2010 to address some of the issues raised by the 
financial crisis of 2007–2009.

Appendix
Tools to Analyze Firms’ Financial 
Information
As we saw in the chapter, modern business firms are not just “black boxes” transforming 
inputs into output. Most business revenues and profits are earned by large corporations. 
Unlike founder-dominated firms, the typical large corporation is run by managers who 
generally do not own a controlling interest in the firm. Large firms raise funds from out-
side investors, and outside investors seek information on firms and the assurance that 
the managers of firms will act in the interests of the investors.
This chapter shows how corporations raise funds by issuing stocks and bonds. This 
appendix provides more detail to support that discussion. We begin by analyzing present 
value as a key concept in determining the prices of financial securities. We then provide 
greater information on financial statements issued by corporations, using Google as an 
example.
Using Present Value to Make Investment 
Decisions
Firms raise funds by selling equity (stock) and debt (bonds and loans) to investors and 
lenders. If you own shares of stock or a bond, you will receive payments in the form of 
dividends or coupons over a number of years. Most people value funds they already 
have more highly than funds they will receive some time in the future. For example, you 
would probably not trade $1,000 you already have for $1,000 you will not receive for one 
year. The longer you have to wait to receive a payment, the less value it will have for you. 
One thousand dollars you will not receive for two years is worth less to you than $1,000 
you will receive after one year. The value you give today to money you will receive in the 
future is called the future payment’s present value. The present value of $1,000 you will 
receive in one year will be less than $1,000.
Why is this true? Why is the $1,000 you will not receive for one year less valuable 
to you than the $1,000 you already have? The most important reason is that if you have 
$1,000 today, you can use that $1,000 today. You can buy goods and services with the 
money and receive enjoyment from them. The $1,000 you receive in one year does not 
have direct use to you now.
Also, prices will likely rise during the year you are waiting to receive your $1,000. 
So, when you finally do receive the $1,000 in one year, you will not be able to buy as 
much with it as you could with $1,000 today. Finally, there is some risk that you will not 
receive the $1,000 in one year. The risk may be very great if an unreliable friend borrows 
$1,000 from you and vaguely promises to pay you back in one year. The risk may be 
very small if you lend money to the federal government by buying a U.S. Treasury bond. 
In either case, though, there is at least some risk that you will not receive the funds 
promised.
When someone lends money, the lender expects to be paid back both the amount 
of the loan and some additional interest. Say that you decide that you are willing to lend 
your $1,000 today if you are paid back $1,100 one year from now. In this case, you are 
charging +100>+1,000 = 0.10, or 10 percent interest on the funds you have loaned. 
Economists would say that you value $1,000 today as equivalent to the $1,100 to be  
received one year in the future.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
Understand the concept 
of present value and the 
information contained on a 
firm’s income statement and 
balance sheet.
Present value The value in today’s 
dollars of funds to be paid or received 
in the future.

264 
C H A P T E R  8  Firms, the Stock Market, and Corporate Governance
Notice that $1,100 can be written as +1,000 11 +  0.102. That is, the value of money 
received in the future is equal to the value of money in the present multiplied by 1 plus 
the interest rate, with the interest rate expressed as a decimal. Or:
+1,100 =  +1,00011 + 0.102.
Notice, also, that if we divide both sides by 11 +  0.102, we can rewrite this  formula as:
+1,000 =
+1,100
11 + 0.102
.
The rewritten formula states that the present value is equal to the future value to be re-
ceived in one year divided by 1 plus the interest rate. This formula is important because 
you can use it to convert any amount to be received in one year into its present value. 
Writing the formula generally, we have:
Present value = Future value1
(1 + i)
.
The present value of funds to be received in one year—Future value1—can be calculated 
by dividing the amount of those funds to be received by 1 plus the interest rate. With an 
interest rate of 10 percent, the present value of $1,000,000 to be received one year from 
now is:
+1,000,000
11 + 0.102 = +909,090.91.
This method is a useful way of calculating the value today of funds that will be 
 received in one year. But financial securities such as stocks and bonds involve prom-
ises to pay funds over many years. Therefore, it would be even more useful if we could 
 expand this formula to calculate the present value of funds to be received more than one 
year in the future.
This expansion is easy to do. Go back to the original example, where we assumed 
you were willing to loan out your $1,000 for one year, provided that you received  
10 percent interest. Suppose you are asked to lend the funds for two years and that you 
are promised 10 percent interest per year for each year of the loan. That is, you are lend-
ing $1,000, which at 10 percent interest will grow to $1,100 after one year, and you are 
agreeing to loan that $1,100 out for a second year at 10 percent interest. So, after two 
years, you will be paid back +1,100 11 +  0.102, or $1,210. Or:
+1,210 = +1,00011 + 0.102 11 + 0.102,
or:
+1,210 = +1,00011 + 0.1022.
This formula can also be rewritten as:
+1,000 =
+1,210
11 + 0.1022 .
To put this formula in words, the $1,210 you receive two years from now has a present 
value equal to $1,210 divided by the quantity 1 plus the interest rate squared. If you 
agree to lend out your $1,000 for three years at 10 percent interest, you will receive:
+1,331 = +1,00011 + 0.1023.
Notice, again, that:
+1,000 =
+1,331
11 + 0.1023.
You can probably see a pattern here. We can generalize the concept to say that the pres-
ent value of funds to be received n years in the future—whether n is 1, 20, or 85 does not 
matter—equals the amount of the funds to be received divided by the quantity 1 plus the

interest rate raised to the nth power. For instance, with an interest rate of 10 percent, the 
value of $1,000,000 to be received 25 years in the future is:
Present value =
+1,000,000
11 + 0.10225 = +92,296.
Or, more generally:
Present value = Future valuen
(1 + i)n
where Future valuen represents funds that will be received in n years.
Solving the Problem
Step 1: Review the material. This problem involves applying the concept of present 
value, so you may want to review the section “Using Present Value to Make 
Investment Decisions,” which begins on page 263.
Step 2: Explain the basis for choosing the prize. Unless you need cash immediately, 
you should choose the prize with the highest present value.
Step 3: Calculate the present value of each prize. Prize 2 consists of one payment of 
$175,000 received right away, so its present value is $175,000. Prize 1 consists 
of five payments spread out over time. To find the present value of the prize, 
we must find the present value of each of these payments and add them to-
gether. To calculate present value, we must use an interest rate. Let’s assume 
an interest rate of 10 percent. In that case, the present value of Prize 1 is:
+50,000 +
+50,000
(1 + 0.10) +

11 + 0.1022 +

+50,000 + +45,454.55 + +41,322.31 + +37,565.74 + +34,150.67 = +208,493.
Step 4: State your conclusion. Prize 1 has the greater present value, so you should 
choose it rather than Prize 2.

Solved Problem 8A.1
How to Receive Your Contest Winnings
Suppose you win a contest and are given the choice of the 
following prizes:
Prize 1: $50,000 to be received right away, with four 
additional payments of $50,000 to be received each year 
for the next four years
Prize 2: $175,000 to be received right away
Explain which prize you would choose and the basis for 
your decision.
Using Present Value to Calculate Bond Prices
Anyone who buys a financial asset, such as shares of stock or a bond, is really buying a 
promise to receive certain payments—dividends in the case of shares of stock or cou-
pons in the case of a bond. The price investors are willing to pay for a financial asset 
should be equal to the value of the payments they will receive as a result of owning the 

266 
C H A P T E R  8  Firms, the Stock Market, and Corporate Governance
asset. Because most of the coupon or dividend payments will be received in the future, 
it is their present value that matters. Put another way, we have the following important 
idea: The price of a financial asset should be equal to the present value of the payments to 
be received from owning that asset.
Let’s consider an example. Suppose that in 1982, General Electric issued a bond 
with an $80 coupon that will mature in 2012. It is now 2010, and that bond has been 
bought and sold by investors many times. You are considering buying it. If you buy the 
bond, you will receive two years of coupon payments plus a final payment of the bond’s 
principal, or face value, of $1,000. Suppose, once again, that you need an interest rate of 
10 percent to invest your funds. If the bond has a coupon of $80, the present value of the 
payments you receive from owning the bond—and, therefore, the present value of the 
bond—will be:
Present value =
+80
11 + 0.102 +
+80
11 + 0.1022 +
+1,000
11 + 0.1022 = +965.29.
That is, the present value of the bond will equal the present value of the three payments 
you will receive during the two years you own the bond. You should, therefore, be will-
ing to pay $965.29 to own this bond and have the right to receive these payments from 
GE. This process of calculating present values of future payments is used to determine 
bond prices, with one qualification: The relevant interest rate used by investors in the 
bond market to calculate the present value and, therefore, the price of an existing bond 
is usually the coupon rate on comparable newly issued bonds. Therefore, the general 
formula for the price of a bond is:
Bond price = Coupon1
11 + i2 + Coupon2
11 + i22 + c + Couponn
11 + i2n + Face value
11 + i2n ,
where Coupon1 is the coupon payment to be received after one year, Coupon2 is the 
coupon payment to be received after two years, up to Couponn, which is the coupon 
payment received in the year the bond matures. The ellipsis takes the place of the cou-
pon payments—if any—received between the second year and the year when the bond 
matures. Face value is the amount that will be received when the bond matures. The 
interest rate on comparable newly issued bonds is i.
Using Present Value to Calculate Stock Prices
When you own a firm’s stock, you are legally entitled to your share of the firm’s profits. 
Remember that the profits a firm pays out to its shareholders are referred to as divi-
dends. The price of a share of stock should be equal to the present value of the divi-
dends investors expect to receive as a result of owning that stock. Therefore, the general  
formula for the price of a stock is:
Stock price = Dividend1
11 + i2
+ Dividend2
11 + i22 + c
Notice that this formula looks very similar to the one we used to calculate the price of 
a bond, with a couple important differences. First, unlike a bond, stock has no maturity 
date, so we have to calculate the present value of an infinite number of dividend pay-
ments. At first, it may seem that the stock’s price must be infinite as well, but remember 
that dollars you don’t receive for many years are worth very little today. For instance, a 
dividend payment of $10 that will be received 40 years in the future is worth only a little 
more than $0.20 today at a 10 percent interest rate. The second difference between the 
stock price formula and the bond price formula is that whereas the coupon payments 
you receive from owning the bond are known with certainty—they are written on the 
bond and cannot be changed—you don’t know for sure what the dividend payments 
from owning a stock will be. How large a dividend payment you will receive depends on 
how profitable the company will be in the future.

Although it is possible to forecast the future profitability of a company, this cannot 
be done with perfect accuracy. To emphasize this point, some economists rewrite the 
basic stock price formula by adding a superscript e to each dividend term to emphasize 
that these are expected dividend payments. Because the future profitability of companies 
is often very difficult to forecast, it is not surprising that differences of opinion exist 
over what the price of a particular stock should be. Some investors will be very opti-
mistic about the future profitability of a company and will, therefore, believe that the 
company’s stock should have a high price. Other investors might be very pessimistic and 
believe that the company’s stock should have a low price.
A Simple Formula for Calculating Stock Prices
It is possible to simplify the formula for determining the price of a stock, if we assume 
that dividends will grow at a constant rate:
Stock price =
Dividend
1i - Growth rate2
.
In this equation, Dividend is the dividend expected to be received one year from now, 
and Growth rate is the rate at which those dividends are expected to grow. If a company 
pays a dividend of $1 per share to be received one year from now and Growth rate is  
10 percent, the company is expected to pay a dividend of $1.10 the following year, $1.21 
the year after that, and so on.
Now suppose that IBM will pay a dividend of $5 per share at the end of year, the 
consensus of investors is that these dividends will increase at a rate of 5 percent per year 
for the indefinite future, and the interest rate is 10 percent. Then the price of IBM’s stock 
should be:
Stock price =
+5.00
10.10 - 0.052 = +100.00.
Particularly during the years 1999 and 2000, there was much discussion of whether 
the high prices of many Internet stocks—such as the stock of Amazon.com—were justi-
fied, given that many of these companies had not made any profit yet and so had not 
paid any dividends. Is there any way that a rational investor would pay a high price for 
the stock of a company currently not earning profits? The formula for determining stock 
prices shows that it is possible, provided that the investor’s assumptions are optimistic 
enough! For example, during 1999, one stock analyst predicted that Amazon.com would 
soon be earning $10 per share of stock. That is, Amazon.com’s total earnings divided by 
the number of shares of its stock outstanding would be $10. Suppose Amazon.com pays 
out that $10 in dividends and that the $10 will grow rapidly over the years, by, say, 7 per-
cent per year. Then our formula indicates that the price of Amazon.com stock should be:
Stock price =
+10.00
10.10 - 0.072 = +333.33.
If you are sufficiently optimistic about the future prospects of a company, a high stock 
price can be justified even if the company is not currently earning a profit. But inves-
tors in growth stocks must be careful. Suppose investors believe that growth prospects 
for Amazon are only 4 percent per year instead of 7 percent because the firm turns out 
not to be as profitable as initially believed. Then our formula indicates that the price of 
Amazon.com stock should be:
Stock price =
+10.00
10.10 - 0.042 = +166.67.
This price is only half the price determined assuming a more optimistic growth rate. 
Hence investors use information about a firm’s profitability and growth prospects to 
determine what the firm is worth.

Going Deeper into Financial Statements
Corporations disclose substantial information about their business operations and fi-
nancial position to actual and potential investors. Some of this information meets the 
demands of participants in financial markets and of information-collection agencies, 
such as Moody’s Investors Service, which develops credit ratings that help investors 
judge how risky corporate bonds are. Other information meets the requirements of the 
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Key sources of information about a corporation’s profitability and financial position 
are its principal financial statements—the income statement and the balance sheet. These 
important information sources were first introduced in the chapter. In the following 
section we go into more detail, using recent data for Google as an example.
Analyzing Income Statements
As discussed in the chapter, a firm’s income statement summarizes its revenues, costs, 
and profit over a period of time. Figure 8A.1 shows Google’s income statement for 
2010.
Google’s income statement presents the results of the company’s operations dur-
ing the year. Listed first are the revenues it earned, largely from selling advertising on 
its Web site, from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2010: $29,321 million. Listed next 
are Google’s operating expenses, the most important of which is its cost of revenue—
which is commonly known as cost of sales or cost of goods sold: $10,417 million. Cost 
of revenue is the direct cost of producing the products sold, including in this case the 
salaries of the computer programmers Google hires to write the software for its Web 
site. Google also has substantial costs for researching and developing its products 
($3,762 million) and for advertising and marketing them ($2,799 million). General 
and administrative  expenses ($1,962 million) include costs such as the salaries of top 
managers. 
The difference between a firm’s revenue and its costs is its profit. Profit shows up 
in several forms on an income statement. A firm’s operating income is the difference be-
tween its revenue and its operating expenses. Most corporations, including Google, also 
have investments, such as government and corporate bonds, that normally generate some 
income for them. In this case, Google earned $415 million on its investments, which

Google’s income statement shows the company’s revenue, costs, and profit for 
2010. The difference between its revenue ($29,321 million) and its operating 
expenses ($18,940 million) is its operating income ($10,381 million). Most cor-
porations also have investments, such as government or corporate bonds, that 
generate some income for them. In this case, Google earned $415 million, giving 
the firm an income before taxes of $10,796 million. After paying taxes of $2,291 
million, Google was left with a net income, or accounting profit, of $8,505 million 
for the year.

increased its income before taxes to $10,796 million. The federal government taxes the 
profits of corporations. During 2010, Google paid $2,291 million—or about 21 percent of 
its profits—in taxes. Net income after taxes was $8,505 million. The net income that firms 
report on their income statements is referred to as their after-tax  accounting profit.
Analyzing Balance Sheets
As discussed in the chapter, while a firm’s income statement reports the firm’s activities for 
a period of time, a firm’s balance sheet summarizes its financial position on a particular 
day, usually the end of a quarter or year. To understand how a balance sheet is organized, 
first recall that an asset is anything of value that the firm owns, and a liability is a debt or an 
obligation that the firm owes. Subtracting the value of a firm’s liabilities from the value of its 
assets leaves its net worth. Because a corporation’s stockholders are its owners, net worth is 
often listed as stockholders’ equity on a balance sheet. Using these definitions, we can state 
the balance sheet equation (also called the basic accounting equation) as follows:
Assets - Liabilities = Stockholders Equity,
or:
Assets = Liabilities + Stockholders Equity.
This formula tells us that the value of a firm’s assets must equal the value of its liabilities 
plus the value of stockholders’ equity. An important accounting rule dating back to the 
beginning of modern bookkeeping in fifteenth-century Italy holds that balance sheets 
should list assets on the left side and liabilities and net worth, or stockholders’  equity, 
on the right side. Notice that this means that the value of the left side of the  balance sheet 
must always equal the value of the right side. Figure 8A.2 shows Google’s balance sheet as 
of December 31, 2010.
A couple of the entries on the asset side of the balance sheet may be unfamiliar: 
Current assets are assets that the firm could convert into cash quickly, such as the bal-
ance in its checking account or its accounts receivable, which is money currently owed 
to the firm for products that have been delivered but not yet paid for. Goodwill repre-
sents the difference between the purchase price of a company and the market value of its 
assets. It represents the ability of a business to earn an economic profit from its assets. 
For example, if you buy a restaurant that is located on a busy intersection and you em-
ploy a chef with a reputation for preparing delicious food, you may pay more than the 
market value of the tables, chairs, ovens, and other assets. This additional amount you 
pay will be entered on the asset side of your balance sheet as goodwill.
Current liabilities are short-term debts such as accounts payable, which is money 
owed to suppliers for goods received but not yet paid for, or bank loans that will be paid 
back in less than one year. Long-term bank loans and the value of outstanding corporate 
bonds are long-term liabilities.
Stockholders’ equity The difference 
between the value of a corporation’s 
assets and the value of its liabilities; 
also known as net worth.
Figure 8A.2 
Google’s Balance Sheet as of 
December 31, 2010
Corporations list their assets on the left of 
their balance sheets and their liabilities on 
the right. The difference between the value 
of a firm’s assets and the value of its liabilities 
equals the net worth of the firm, or stockhold-
ers’ equity. Stockholders’ equity is listed on the 
right side of the balance sheet. Therefore, the 
value of the left side of the balance sheet must 
always equal the value of the right side.

Before the 2008 season, the New York Yankees signed 
second baseman Robinson Cano to a contract that would 
pay him the following amounts: $3 million for the 2008 
season, $6 million for the 2009 season, $9 million for the 
2010 season, and $10  million for the 2011 season, with an 
option for $14 million for the 2012 season and an option 
for $15 million for the 2013 season. Assume that Cano 
plays all six seasons for the Yankees and that he receives 
each of his six seasonal salaries as a lump-sum payment at 
the end of the season and he receives his 2008 salary one 
year after he signs the contract.
 
a. Some newspaper reports described Cano as having 
signed a $57 million contract with the Yankees. Do you 
agree that $57 million was the value of this contract? 
Briefly explain.
 
b. What was the present value of Cano’s contract at 
the time he signed it (assuming an interest rate of 10 
percent)?
 
c. If you use an interest rate of 5 percent, what was the 
present value of Cano’s contract?

Economics in Your Life
Have You Heard of the “Buy American” Provision?
Politicians often support restrictions on trade to convince people to vote for them. The workers 
in the industries these restrictions protect are likely to vote for the politicians because the work-
ers think trade restrictions will protect their jobs. But most people are not workers in industries 
protected from foreign competition by trade restrictions. Many people work for firms, such as Cat-
erpillar, that sell goods in foreign markets. These workers risk losing their jobs if foreign countries 
retaliate against U.S. attempts to reduce imported goods. How, then, did some U.S. companies con-
vince Congress to include the Buy American provision in the American Recovery and Reinvestment 
Act of 2009, and why have relatively few people even heard of this provision? As you read the chap-
ter, see if you can answer these questions. You can check your answers against those we provide on 
page 297 at the end of this chapter.
American amendment is really an anti- 
export provision.”
U.S. firms were also concerned because 
in the modern business world, foreign-based 
firms often buy from U.S. suppliers, and U.S. 
suppliers often buy from foreign firms. As one 
executive for General Electric put it, “The sup-
ply chains are so integrated, it is crazy to try to 
impose a Buy American provision. Some com-
ponents cross the border four or five times.”
Are Buy American provisions and other 
attempts to protect U.S. firms from foreign 
competition good ideas? As we will see in 
this chapter, these policies create winners—
the firms that are sheltered from foreign 
competition—but they also create losers—
U.S. firms that rely on exports to foreign 
countries, as well as U.S. consumers and 
taxpayers who must pay higher prices for 
goods that could have been purchased at 
lower prices from foreign companies.
AN INSIDE LOOK on page 298 
 examines a federal lawsuit against Home 
Depot, alleging that the company  violated 
the Buy American provision.
Based on Keith Bradsher, “Pentagon Must ‘Buy American,’ 
Barring Chinese Solar Panels,” New York Times, January 9, 
2011; Peter Fritsch and Corey Boles, “How ‘Buy American’ 
Can Hurt U.S. Firms,” Wall Street Journal, September 17, 
2009; and Mark Drajem, “GE, Caterpillar Fight ‘Buy Ameri-
can’ Rule in Stimulus,” Bloomberg.com, January 22, 2009.
In response to the economic recession of 
2007–2009, Congress and President Barack 
Obama passed the American Recovery and 
Reinvestment Act of 2009, a bill that included 
tax cuts and increased government spend-
ing, particularly on infrastructure such as 
bridges and roads. The bill included a “Buy 
American” provision that required all manu-
factured goods bought with these funds to be 
made in the United States. The intention was 
to increase the number of jobs the bill would 
create by preventing foreign companies from 
participating in the new spending projects.
Some U.S. firms, though, were opposed 
to the Buy American provision. These firms 
had two concerns: First, they were afraid 
that foreign governments would retaliate. 
Canada and China in particular, protested 
before the bill was passed that the United 
States had signed international agreements 
in which it had promised not to impose new 
barriers to foreign companies selling in the 
United States. Once the bill passed, retalia-
tion did take place. China passed a similar 
bill that increased infrastructure spending, 
while specifying that only Chinese firms 
could participate. Illinois-based Caterpil-
lar, which makes bulldozers and other con-
struction equipment, and other U.S. firms 
were excluded. One executive at Caterpillar 
was quoted as saying, “The so-called Buy

American” Policy Help U.S. Firms?

rade is simply the act of buying or selling. Is there a difference between trade that 
takes place within a country and international trade? Within the United States, 
domestic trade makes it possible for consumers in Ohio to eat salmon caught in 
Alaska and for consumers in Montana to drive cars built in Michigan or Kentucky. 
Similarly, international trade makes it possible for consumers in the United States to drink wine 
from France and use Blu-ray players from Japan. But one significant difference between domes-
tic trade and international trade is that international trade is more controversial. At one time, 
nearly all the televisions, shoes, clothing, and toys bought in the United States were also pro-
duced in the United States. Today, firms in other countries produce most of these goods. This 
shift has benefited U.S. consumers because foreign-made goods have lower prices or higher 
quality than the U.S.-made goods they have replaced. But at the same time, many U.S. firms that 
produced these goods have gone out of business, and their workers have had to find other jobs. 
Not surprisingly, opinion polls show that many Americans favor reducing international trade 
because they believe doing so will preserve jobs in the United States. But is this belief accurate?
We can use the tools of demand and supply developed in Chapter 3 to analyze markets for 
internationally traded goods and services. We saw in Chapter 2 that trade in general—whether 
within a country or between countries—is based on the principle of comparative advantage. In 
this chapter, we look more closely at the role of comparative advantage in international trade. 
We also use the concepts of consumer surplus, producer surplus, and deadweight loss from 
Chapter 4 to analyze government policies that interfere with trade. With this background, we 
can return to the political debate over whether the United States benefits from international 
trade. We begin by looking at how large a role international trade plays in the U.S. economy.
The United States in the International 
Economy
International trade has grown tremendously over the past 50 years. The increase in trade 
is the result of the falling costs of shipping products around the world, the spread of in-
expensive and reliable communications, and changes in government policies. Firms can 
use large container ships to send their products across oceans at low cost. Businesspeople 
today can travel to Europe or Asia, using fast, inexpensive, and reliable air transportation. 
The Internet, cell phones, and text messaging allow managers to communicate instanta-
neously and at a very low cost with customers and suppliers around the world. These and 
other improvements in transportation and communication have created an integrated 
global marketplace that earlier generations of businesspeople could only dream of.
Over the past 50 years, many governments have changed policies to facilitate inter-
national trade. For example, tariff rates have fallen. A tariff is a tax imposed by a gov-
ernment on imports of a good into a country. Imports are goods and services bought 
domestically but produced in other countries. In the 1930s, the United States charged 
an average tariff rate above 50 percent. Today, the rate is less than 2 percent. In North 
America, most tariffs between Canada, Mexico, and the United States were eliminated 
following the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1994. 
Twenty-seven countries in Europe have formed the European Union, which has elimi-
nated all tariffs among member countries, greatly increasing both imports and exports, 
which are goods and services produced domestically but sold in other countries.
The Importance of Trade to the U.S. Economy
U.S. consumers buy increasing quantities of goods and services produced in other coun-
tries. At the same time, U.S. businesses sell increasing quantities of goods and services 
to consumers in other countries. Figure 9.1 shows that since 1970, both exports and im-
ports have been steadily increasing as a fraction of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP).

Recall that GDP is the value of all the final goods and services produced in a country dur-
ing a year. In 1970, exports and imports were both less than 6 percent of GDP. In 2010,  
exports were about 13 percent of GDP, and imports were about 16 percent.
Not all sectors of the U.S. economy are affected equally by international trade. For 
example, although it’s difficult to import or export some services, such as haircuts and 
appendectomies, a large percentage of U.S. agricultural production is exported. Each 
year, the United States exports about 50 percent of its wheat and rice crops and 20 per-
cent of its corn crop.
Many U.S. manufacturing industries also depend on trade. About 20 percent of U.S. 
manufacturing jobs depend directly or indirectly on exports. In some industries, such 
as computers, the products these workers make are directly exported. In other indus-
tries, such as steel, the products are used to make other products, such as bulldozers or 
machine tools, that are then exported. In all, about two-thirds of U.S. manufacturing 
industries depend on exports for at least 10 percent of jobs.
U.S. International Trade in a World Context
The United States is the largest exporter in the world, as Figure 9.2 illustrates. Six of 
the other seven leading exporting countries are also high-income countries. Although 
China is still a relatively low-income country, the rapid growth of the Chinese economy 
over the past 30 years has resulted in its becoming the third-largest exporter.

Figure 9.3 shows that international trade is less important to the United States than 
to many other countries, with imports and exports being smaller percentages of GDP. 
In some smaller countries, such as Belgium and the Netherlands, imports and exports 
make up more than half of GDP. In the larger European economies, imports and exports 
make up one-quarter to one-half of GDP.

How Caterpillar Depends  
on International Trade
We saw in the chapter opener that Caterpillar, Inc., was op-
posed to the Buy American provision in the American Recov-
ery and Reinvestment Act. Jim Owens, Caterpillar’s CEO, argued, “We need to avoid 
things like . . . ‘Buy American.’ . . . If we turn inward, it sends a terrible signal to the rest 
of the world, and I’m concerned that other countries will adopt even more protectionist 
measures for their countries.” Owens had cause to be concerned because, as the graph 
below shows, in 2010, 68 percent of Caterpillar sales were outside North America. This 
dependence on exports made Caterpillar vulnerable to foreign governments responding 
to the Buy American provision by restricting exports from the United States.

In fact, Caterpillar has become increasingly dependent on foreign markets. The 
firm’s exports rose from just over half of total sales in 2004 to more than two-thirds in 
2010. Because Caterpillar sells earth-moving and other construction equipment, it was

Comparative Advantage 
in International Trade
Why have businesses around the world increasingly looked for markets in other coun-
tries? Why have consumers increasingly purchased goods and services made in other 
countries? People trade for one reason: Trade makes them better off. Whenever a buyer 
and seller agree to a sale, they must both believe they are better off; otherwise, there would 
be no sale. This outcome must hold whether the buyer and seller live in the same city or 
in different countries. As we will see, governments are more likely to interfere with inter-
national trade than they are with domestic trade, but the reasons for the interference are 
more political than economic.
A Brief Review of Comparative Advantage
In Chapter 2, we discussed the key economic concept of comparative advantage. 
 Comparative advantage is the ability of an individual, a firm, or a country to produce 
a good or service at a lower opportunity cost than competitors. Recall that opportu-
nity cost is the highest-valued alternative that must be given up to engage in an activ-
ity.  People, firms, and countries specialize in economic activities in which they have a 
comparative advantage. In trading, we benefit from the comparative advantage of other 
people (or firms or countries), and they benefit from our comparative advantage.
A good way to think of comparative advantage is to recall the example in Chapter 2 
of you and your neighbor picking fruit. Your neighbor is better at picking both apples and 
cherries than you are. Why, then, doesn’t your neighbor pick both types of fruit? Because 
the opportunity cost to your neighbor of picking her own apples is very high: She is a par-
ticularly skilled cherry picker, and every hour spent picking apples is an hour taken away 
from picking cherries. You can pick apples at a much lower opportunity cost than your 
neighbor, so you have a comparative advantage in picking apples. Your neighbor can pick 
cherries at a much lower opportunity cost than you can, so she has a comparative advan-
tage in picking cherries. Your neighbor is better off specializing in picking cherries, and 
you are better off specializing in picking apples. You can then trade some of your apples 
for some of your neighbor’s cherries, and both of you will end up with more of each fruit.

severely affected by the decline in the U.S. housing market that began in 2006. Although 
sales in the United States declined by more than half between 2006 and 2008, increases 
in exports were enough to make 2008 a record sales year for Caterpillar. By 2009, how-
ever, the slowdown in the world economy had begun to affect the company, and sales 
declined 37 percent. Sales rose by 31 percent in 2010, but the increase came largely from 
higher sales outside of the United States.
Although Caterpillar now sells more outside the United States than inside, it still 
remains a major employer in the United States. At the end of 2010, Caterpillar employed 
more than 41,000 workers in 278 offices and factories in the United States. In addition, 
Caterpillar dealers in the United States employed more than 50,000 people. Thousands 
of other workers are employed at the many U.S. firms that supply Caterpillar with parts 
and components for its products. Problems at Caterpillar result in problems in the U.S. 
communities where the company and its suppliers are located. Caterpillar employs more 
than 20,000 people in the area around its headquarters in Peoria, Illinois. When sales de-
clines led to layoffs in early 2009, the local real estate market, local stores and businesses, 
and the tax revenues of local governments were all affected. Like many U.S. firms that 
depend on exports, Caterpillar and its employees are vulnerable to disruptions in world 
trade caused by foreign retaliation against U.S. exports or other political problems.

C H A P T E R  9  Comparative Advantage and the Gains from International Trade
Comparative Advantage in International Trade
The principle of comparative advantage can explain why people pursue different occu-
pations. It can also explain why countries produce different goods and services. Inter-
national trade involves many countries importing and exporting many different goods 
and services. Countries are better off if they specialize in producing the goods for which 
they have a comparative advantage. They can then trade for the goods for which other 
countries have a comparative advantage.
We can illustrate why specializing on the basis of comparative advantage makes 
countries better off with a simple example involving just two countries and two prod-
ucts. Suppose the United States and Japan produce only cell phones and tablet com-
puters, like Apple’s iPad or Samsung’s Galaxy Tab. Assume that each country uses only 
labor to produce each good and that Japanese and U.S. cell phones and tablet computers 
are exactly the same. Table 9.1 shows how much each country can produce of each good 
with one hour of labor.
Notice that Japanese workers are more productive than U.S. workers in making 
both goods. In one hour of work, Japanese workers can make six times as many cell 
phones and one and one-half times as many tablet computers as U.S. workers. Japan has 
an absolute advantage over the United States in producing both goods. Absolute advan-
tage is the ability to produce more of a good or service than competitors when using the 
same amount of resources. In this case, Japan can produce more of both goods using the 
same amount of labor as the United States.
It might seem at first that Japan has nothing to gain from trading with the United 
States because it has an absolute advantage in producing both goods. However, Japan 
should specialize and produce only cell phones and obtain the tablet computers it needs 
by exporting cell phones to the United States in exchange for tablet computers. The reason 
that Japan benefits from trade is that although it has an absolute advantage in the produc-
tion of both goods, it has a comparative advantage only in the production of cell phones. 
The United States has a comparative advantage in the production of tablet computers.
If it seems contrary to common sense that Japan should import tablet computers 
from the United States even though Japan can produce more tablets per hour of work, 
think about the opportunity cost to each country of producing each good. If Japan wants 
to produce more tablet computers, it has to switch labor away from cell phone production. 
Every hour of labor switched from producing cell phones to producing tablet comput-
ers increases tablet computer production by 6 and reduces cell phone production by 12. 
 Japan has to give up 12 cell phones for every 6 tablet computers it produces. Therefore, the 
 opportunity cost to Japan of producing one more tablet computer is 12/6, or 2 cell phones.
If the United States switches one hour of labor from cell phones to tablet computers, 
production of cell phones falls by 2, and production of tablet computers rises by 4. There-
fore, the opportunity cost to the United States of producing one more tablet computer is 
2/4, or 0.5 cell phone. The United States has a lower opportunity cost of producing tablet

computers and, therefore, has a comparative advantage in making this product. By similar 
reasoning, we can see that Japan has a comparative advantage in producing cell phones. 
Table 9.2 summarizes the opportunity cost each country faces in producing these goods.
How Countries Gain 
from International Trade
Can Japan really gain from producing only cell phones and trading with the United 
States for tablet computers? To see that it can, assume at first that Japan and the United 
States do not trade with each other. A situation in which a country does not trade with 
other countries is called autarky. Assume that in autarky, each country has 1,000 hours 
of labor available to produce the two goods, and each country produces the quantities of 
the two goods shown in Table 9.3. Because there is no trade, these quantities also repre-
sent consumption of the two goods in each country.
Increasing Consumption through Trade
Suppose now that Japan and the United States begin to trade with each other. The terms 
of trade is the ratio at which a country can trade its exports for imports from other 
countries. For simplicity, let’s assume that the terms of trade end up with Japan and the 
United States being willing to trade one cell phone for one tablet computer.
Once trade has begun, the United States and Japan can exchange tablet computers 
for cell phones or cell phones for tablet computers. For example, if Japan specializes by 
using all 1,000 available hours of labor to produce cell phones, it will be able to produce 
12,000. It then could export 1,500 cell phones to the United States in exchange for 1,500 
tablet computers. (Remember that we are assuming that the terms of trade are one cell 
phone for one tablet computer.) Japan ends up with 10,500 cell phones and 1,500 tablet 
computers. Compared with the situation before trade, Japan has the same number of 
tablet computers but 1,500 more cell phones. If the United States specializes in pro-
ducing tablet computers, it will be able to produce 4,000. It could then export 1,500 
tablet computers to Japan in exchange for 1,500 cell phones. The United States ends up 
with 2,500 tablet computers and 1,500 cell phones. Compared with the situation before 
trade, the United States has the same number of cell phones but 1,500 more tablet com-
puters. Trade has allowed both countries to increase the quantities of goods consumed. 
Table 9.4 summarizes the gains from trade for the United States and Japan.
By trading, Japan and the United States are able to consume more than they could 
without trade. This outcome is possible because world production of both goods increases 
after trade. (In this example, our “world” consists of just the United States and Japan.)
Why does total production of cell phones and tablet computers increase when the 
United States specializes in producing tablet computers and Japan specializes in producing 
cell phones? A domestic analogy helps to answer this question: If a company shifts produc-
tion from an old factory to a more efficient modern factory, its output will increase. In ef-
fect, the same thing happens in our example. Producing tablet computers in Japan and cell 
phones in the United States is inefficient. Shifting production to the more efficient coun-
try—the one with the comparative advantage—increases total production. The key point 
is this: Countries gain from specializing in producing goods in which they have a comparative 
advantage and trading for goods in which other countries have a comparative advantage.

Solved Problem 9.3
The Gains from Trade
The first discussion of comparative advantage appears in 
On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation, a book 
written by David Ricardo in 1817. Ricardo provided a fa-
mous example of the gains from trade, using wine and cloth 
production in Portugal and England. The following table 
is adapted from Ricardo’s example, with cloth measured in 
sheets and wine measured in kegs:
Output per Year of Labor
Cloth
Wine

150
England
  90
  60
a.  Explain which country has an absolute advantage in the 
production of each good.
b.  Explain which country has a comparative advantage in 
the production of each good.
c.  Suppose that Portugal and England currently do not 
trade with each other. Each country has 1,000 workers, so 
each has 1,000 years of labor time to use producing cloth 
and wine, and the countries are currently producing the 
amounts of each good shown in the following table:
 
Cloth
Wine
Portugal
18,000
123,000
England
63,000
  18,000
Show that Portugal and England can both gain from trade. 
Assume that the terms of trade are that one sheet of cloth 
can be traded for one keg of wine.
Solving the Problem
Step 1: Review the chapter material. This problem is about absolute and compara-
tive advantage and the gains from trade, so you may want to review the section 
“Comparative Advantage in International Trade,” which begins on page 278, 

 
How Countries Gain from International Trade  
281
and the section “How Countries Gain from International Trade,” which be-
gins on page 279.
Step 2: Answer part a. by determining which country has an absolute advantage. 
Remember that a country has an absolute advantage over another country 
when it can produce more of a good using the same resources. The first table 
in the problem shows that Portugal can produce more cloth and more wine 
with one year’s worth of labor than can England. Thus, Portugal has an abso-
lute advantage in the production of both goods and, therefore, England does 
not have an absolute advantage in the production of either good.
Step 3: Answer part b. by determining which country has a comparative advantage. 
A country has a comparative advantage when it can produce a good at a 
lower opportunity cost. To produce 100 sheets of cloth, Portugal must give up 
 producing 150 kegs of wine. Therefore, the opportunity cost to Portugal of pro-
ducing 1 sheet of cloth is 150/100, or 1.5 kegs of wine. England has to give up 
producing 60 kegs of wine to produce 90 sheets of cloth, so its opportunity cost 
of producing 1 sheet of cloth is 60/90, or 0.67 keg of wine. The opportunity 
costs of producing wine can be calculated in the same way. The following table 
shows the opportunity cost to Portugal and England of producing each good.
Opportunity Costs
 
Cloth
Wine
Portugal
1.5 kegs of wine
0.67 sheet of cloth
England
0.67 keg of wine
1.5 sheets of cloth
Portugal has a comparative advantage in wine because its opportunity 
cost is lower. England has a comparative advantage in cloth because its op-
portunity cost is lower.
Step 4: Answer part c. by showing that both countries can benefit from trade. By now 
it should be clear that both countries will be better off if they specialize where 
they have a comparative advantage and trade for the other product. The  following 
table is very similar to Table 9.4 and shows one example of trade making both 
countries better off. (To test your understanding, construct another example.)

C H A P T E R  9  Comparative Advantage and the Gains from International Trade
Why Don’t We See Complete Specialization?
In our example of two countries producing only two products, each country specializes 
in producing one of the goods. In the real world, many goods and services are produced 
in more than one country. For example, the United States, Japan, Germany, Canada, 
Mexico, India, China, and other countries produce automobiles. We do not see com-
plete specialization in the real world for three main reasons:
• 
Not all goods and services are traded internationally. Even if, for example, Japan 
had a comparative advantage in the production of medical services, it would be dif-
ficult for Japan to specialize in producing medical services and then export them. 
There is no easy way for U.S. patients who need appendectomies to receive them 
from surgeons in Japan.
• 
Production of most goods involves increasing opportunity costs. Recall from  
Chapter 2 that production of most goods involves increasing opportunity costs. 
So, in our  example, if the United States devotes more workers to producing tablet 
 computers, the opportunity cost of producing more tablet computers will increase. At 
some point, the opportunity cost of producing tablet computers in the United States 
may rise to the level of the opportunity cost of producing tablet computers in Japan. 
When that happens, international trade will no longer push the United States further 
toward specialization. The same will be true of Japan: Increasing opportunity cost will 
cause Japan to stop short of complete specialization in producing cell phones.
• 
Tastes for products differ. Most products are differentiated. Cell phones, tablet com-
puters, cars, and televisions—to name just a few products—come with a wide vari-
ety of features. When buying automobiles, some people look for reliability and fuel 
efficiency, others look for room to carry seven passengers, and still others want styl-
ing and high performance. So, some car buyers prefer Toyota Prius hybrids, some 
prefer Chevy Suburbans, and others prefer BMWs. As a result, Japan, the United 
States, and Germany may each have a comparative advantage in producing different 
types of automobiles.
Does Anyone Lose as a Result of International Trade?
In our cell phone and tablet computer example, consumption increases in both the 
United States and Japan as a result of trade. Everyone gains, and no one loses. Or do 
Remember That Trade Creates Both 
Winners and Losers
The following statement is from a Federal Reserve publica-
tion: “Trade is a win–win situation for all countries that par-
ticipate.” People sometimes interpret statements like this to 
mean that there are no losers from international trade. But 
notice that the statement refers to countries, not individu-
als. When countries participate in trade, they make their 
consumers better off by increasing the quantity of goods 
and services available to them. As we have seen, however, 
expanding trade eliminates the jobs of workers employed 
at companies that are less efficient than foreign companies. 
Trade also creates new jobs at companies that export to for-
eign markets. It may be difficult, though, for workers who 
lose their jobs because of trade to easily find others. That is 
why in the United States, the federal government uses the 
Trade Adjustment Assistance program to provide funds for 
workers who have lost their jobs due to international trade. 
Qualified unemployed workers can use these funds to pay 
for retraining, for searching for new jobs, or for relocating 
to areas where new jobs are available. This program—and 
similar programs in other countries—recognizes that there 
are losers from international trade as well as winners.

they? In our example, we referred repeatedly to “Japan” or the “United States” pro-
ducing cell phones or tablet computers. But countries do not produce goods—firms 
do. In a world without trade, there would be cell phone and tablet computer firms in 
both Japan and the United States. In a world with trade, there would be only Japanese 
cell phone firms and U.S. tablet computer firms. Japanese tablet computer firms and 
U.S. cell phone firms would close. Overall, total employment would not change, and 
production would increase as a result of trade. Nevertheless, the owners of Japanese 
tablet computer firms, the owners of U.S. cell phone firms, and the people who work 
for them are worse off as a result of trade. The losers from trade are likely to do their 
best to convince the Japanese and U.S. governments to interfere with trade by barring 
imports of the competing products from the other country or by imposing high tariffs 
on them.
Where Does Comparative Advantage 
Come From?
Among the main sources of comparative advantage are the following:
• 
Climate and natural resources. This source of comparative advantage is the most 
obvious. Because of geology, Saudi Arabia has a comparative advantage in the pro-
duction of oil. Because of climate and soil conditions, Costa Rica has a comparative 
advantage in the production of bananas, and the United States has a comparative 
advantage in the production of wheat.
• 
Relative abundance of labor and capital. Some countries, such as the United 
States, have many highly skilled workers and a great deal of machinery. Other 
countries, such as China, have many unskilled workers and relatively little ma-
chinery. As a result, the United States has a comparative advantage in the pro-
duction of goods that require highly skilled workers or sophisticated machinery 
to manufacture, such as aircraft, semiconductors, and computer software. China 
has a comparative advantage in the production of goods, such as tools, clothing, 
and children’s toys, that require unskilled workers and small amounts of simple 
machinery.
• 
Technology. Broadly defined, technology is the process firms use to turn inputs 
into goods and services. At any given time, firms in different countries do not 
all have access to the same technologies. In part, this difference is the result 
of past investments countries have made in supporting higher education or in 
providing support for research and development. Some countries are strong 
in product technologies, which involve the ability to develop new products. For 
example, firms in the United States have pioneered the development of such 
products as radios, televisions, digital computers, airliners, medical equipment, 
and many prescription drugs. Other countries are strong in process technolo-
gies, which involve the ability to improve the processes used to make existing 
products. For example, Japanese-based firms, such as Toyota and Honda, have 
succeeded by greatly improving the processes for  designing and manufacturing 
automobiles.
• 
External economies. It is difficult to explain the location of some industries on the 
basis of climate, natural resources, the relative abundance of labor and capital, or 
technology. For example, why does southern California have a comparative advan-
tage in making movies or Switzerland in making watches or New York in providing 
financial services? The answer is that once an industry becomes established in an 
area, firms that locate in that area gain advantages over firms located elsewhere. 
The advantages include the availability of skilled workers, the opportunity to in-
teract with other firms in the same industry, and proximity to suppliers. These ad-
vantages result in lower costs to firms located in the area. Because these lower costs 
result from increases in the size of the industry in an area, economists refer to them 
as external economies.

Leave New York City? Risky for 
Financial Firms
The name “Wall Street” is shorthand for the whole U.S. finan-
cial system of banks, brokerage houses, and other financial 
firms. Wall Street is also, of course, an actual street in the New York City borough of 
Manhattan. The New York Stock Exchange is located on Wall Street, and many finan-
cial firms have their headquarters in Manhattan. There are also a 
lot of financial firms located outside Manhattan, but many of the 
largest firms believe that there are advantages to being located 
close to Wall Street. For instance, in 1997, UBS, a large Swiss 
bank, moved its North American headquarters from Manhattan 
to Stamford, Connecticut, where it built the largest facility for 
trading financial securities in the world. By 2011, UBS had begun 
moving many of its bankers back to Manhattan and was expected 
to occupy more than 1 million square feet of the 3 World Trade 
Center building once construction was complete. Other financial 
firms have also moved some operations out of Manhattan only to 
move them back.
The original concentration of financial firms in Manhattan 
was something of a historical accident. In colonial times and up 
through the early nineteenth century, Philadelphia and Boston 
were at least close rivals to New York City as business and financial centers. In fact, 
Philadelphia had both a larger population than New York and was the headquarters 
of the federal government’s first two central banks. New York City received a boost in 
its rivalry with other cities when the Erie Canal was completed in upstate New York in 
1825. The canal resulted in crops and other raw materials being shipped to New York 
City rather than to other ports. This inflow led to the development of banking, insur-
ance, and other financial firms. Coupled with the gradual increase in trading on the 
New Stock Exchange, the increase in business resulting from the completion of the 
canal established New York City as the leading financial center in the country.
But the Erie Canal has long since ceased to operate, and most stock trading takes 
place electronically rather than on the floor of the New York Stock  Exchange. So, 
why has New York continued to see a high concentration of financial firms, with 
some firms that temporarily left deciding to return? The answer is that  financial 
firms benefit from the external economies of being located in New York City. 
Even in the Internet age, many financial deals are still conducted face-to-face, so 
not  having a physical presence in Manhattan puts a firm at a disadvantage. Many 
 people pursuing careers in finance also want to be physically located in Manhattan 
because that is where most of the highest-paying financial jobs are. Firms that have 
moved out of Manhattan have had more difficulty attracting and retaining the most 
 productive workers. In addition, Manhattan also has a large concentration of firms 
that  provide support services, such as software programming for running financial 
firms’  computer systems.
Large financial firms located outside Manhattan, particularly those that heavily 
trade securities or attempt to make deals that involve mergers between firms, may have 
higher costs than firms located in Manhattan. Having many financial firms originally 
located in Manhattan was a historical accident, but external economies gave the area a 
comparative advantage in providing financial services once the industry began to grow 
there.
Based on Brett Philbin, “UBS Shifts Staff to New York,” Wall Street Journal, July 13, 2011; and Charles V. Bagli, “Regretting 
Move, Bank May Return to Manhattan,” New York Times, June 8, 2011.

Government Policies That Restrict International Trade

Comparative Advantage over Time: The Rise and 
Fall—and Rise—of the U.S. Consumer Electronics 
Industry
A country may develop a comparative advantage in the production of a good, and then, 
as time passes and circumstances change, the country may lose its comparative advantage 
in producing that good and develop a comparative advantage in producing other goods. 
For several decades, the United States had a comparative advantage in the production of 
consumer electronic goods, such as televisions, radios, and stereos. The comparative ad-
vantage of the United States in these products was based on having developed most of the 
underlying technology, having the most modern factories, and having a skilled and expe-
rienced workforce. Gradually, however, other countries, particularly Japan, gained access 
to the technology, built modern factories, and developed skilled workforces. As men-
tioned earlier, Japanese firms have excelled in process technologies, which involve the 
ability to improve the processes used to make existing products. By the 1970s and 1980s, 
Japanese firms were able to produce many consumer electronic goods more cheaply and 
with higher quality than could U.S. firms. Japanese firms Sony, Panasonic, and Pioneer re-
placed U.S. firms Magnavox, Zenith, and RCA as world leaders in consumer electronics.
By 2011, however, as the technology underlying consumer electronics had evolved, 
comparative advantage had shifted again, and several U.S. firms had surged ahead of 
their Japanese competitors. For example, Apple had developed the iPod, iPhone, and 
iPad; Linksys, a division of Cisco Systems, took the lead in home wireless networking 
technology; and TiVo pioneered the digital video recorder (DVR). As pictures and mu-
sic converted to digital data, process technologies became less important than the ability 
to design and develop new products. These new consumer electronic products required 
skills similar to those in computer design and software writing, where the United States 
had long maintained a comparative advantage.
Once a country has lost its comparative advantage in producing a good, its income 
will be higher and its economy will be more efficient if it switches from producing the 
good to importing it, as the United States did when it switched from producing tele-
visions to importing them. As we will see in the next section, however, there is often 
political pressure on governments to attempt to preserve industries that have lost their 
comparative advantage.
Government Policies That Restrict 
International Trade
Free trade, or trade between countries that is without government restrictions, makes 
consumers better off. We can expand on this idea by using the concepts of consumer 
surplus and producer surplus from Chapter 4. Figure 9.4 shows the market in the United 
States for the bio-fuel ethanol, which can be used as a substitute for gasoline. The figure 
shows the situation of autarky, where the United States does not trade with other coun-
tries. The equilibrium price of ethanol is $2.00 per gallon, and the equilibrium quantity 
is 6.0 billion gallons per year. The blue area represents consumer surplus, and the red 
area represents producer surplus.
Now suppose that the United States begins importing ethanol from Brazil and other 
countries that produce ethanol for $1.00 per gallon. Because the world market for etha-
nol is large, we will assume that the United States can buy as much ethanol as it wants 
without causing the world price of $1.00 per gallon to rise. Therefore, once imports of 
ethanol are permitted into the United States, U.S. firms will not be able to sell ethanol at 
prices higher than the world price of $1.00, and the U.S. price will become equal to the 
world price.
Figure 9.5 shows the result of allowing imports of ethanol into the United States. 
With the price lowered from $2.00 to $1.00, U.S. consumers increase their purchases

from 6.0 billion gallons to 9.0 billion gallons. Equilibrium moves from point F to point G. 
In the new equilibrium, U.S. producers have reduced the quantity of ethanol they sup-
ply from 6.0 billion gallons to 3.0 billion gallons. Imports will equal 6.0 billion gallons, 
which is the difference between U.S. consumption and U.S. production.
Under autarky, consumer surplus would be area A in Figure 9.5. With imports, the 
reduction in price increases consumer surplus, so it is now equal to the sum of areas A, 
B, C, and D. Although the lower price increases consumer surplus, it reduces producer 
surplus. Under autarky, producer surplus was equal to the sum of the areas B and E.

With imports, producer surplus is equal to only area E. Recall that economic surplus 
equals the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus. Moving from autarky to 
 allowing imports increases economic surplus in the United States by an amount equal  
to the sum of areas C and D.
We can conclude that international trade helps consumers but hurts firms that are 
less efficient than foreign competitors. As a result, these firms and their workers are 
often strong supporters of government policies that restrict trade. These policies usually 
take one of two forms: tariffs or quotas and voluntary export restraints.
Tariffs
The most common interferences with trade are tariffs, which are taxes imposed by a gov-
ernment on goods imported into a country. Like any other tax, a tariff increases the cost of 
selling a good. Figure 9.6 shows the effect of a tariff of $0.50 per gallon on ethanol imports 
into the United States. The $0.50 tariff raises the price of ethanol in the United States from 
the world price of $1.00 per gallon to $1.50 per gallon. At this higher price, U.S. ethanol 
producers increase the quantity they supply from 3.0 billion gallons to 4.5  billion gallons. 
U.S. consumers, though, cut back their purchases of ethanol from 9.0 billion gallons to 
7.5 billion gallons. Imports decline from 6.0 billion gallons (9.0 billion 2 3.0 billion) to 
3.0 billion gallons (7.5 billion 2 4.5 billion). Equilibrium moves from point G to point H.
By raising the price of ethanol from $1.00 to $1.50, the tariff reduces consumer sur-
plus by the sum of areas A, T, C, and D. Area A is the increase in producer surplus 
from the higher price. The government collects tariff revenue equal to the tariff of $0.50 
per gallon multiplied by the 3.0 billion gallons imported. Area T represents the govern-
ment’s tariff revenue. Areas C and D represent losses to U.S. consumers that are not cap-
tured by anyone. These areas are deadweight loss and represent the decline in economic 
efficiency resulting from the ethanol tariff. Area C shows the effect on U.S. consumers 
of being forced to buy from U.S. producers who are less efficient than foreign producers, 
and area D shows the effect of U.S. consumers buying less ethanol than they would have 
at the world price. As a result of the tariff, economic surplus has been reduced by the 
sum of areas C and D.
We can conclude that the tariff succeeds in helping U.S. ethanol producers but hurts 
U.S. consumers and the efficiency of the U.S. economy.
Figure 9.6 
The Effects of a Tariff on Ethanol
Without a tariff on ethanol, U.S. producers 
will sell 3.0 billion gallons of ethanol, U.S. 
consumers will purchase 9.0 billion gal-
lons, and imports will be 6.0 billion gallons. 
The U.S. price will equal the world price of 
$1.00 per gallon. The $0.50-per-gallon tar-
iff raises the price of ethanol in the United 
States to $1.50 per gallon, and U.S. produc-
ers increase the quantity they supply to 4.5 
billion gallons. U.S. consumers reduce their 
purchases to 7.5 billion gallons. Equilibrium 
moves from point G to point H. The etha-
nol tariff causes a loss of consumer surplus 
equal to the area A + C + T + D. The area 
A is the increase in producer surplus due to 
the higher price. The area T is the govern-
ment’s tariff revenue. The areas C and D 
represent deadweight loss.

Quotas and Voluntary Export Restraints
A  quota is a numerical limit on the quantity of a good that can be imported, and it 
has an effect similar to that of a tariff. A quota is imposed by the government of the 
importing country. A voluntary export restraint (VER) is an agreement negotiated be-
tween two countries that places a numerical limit on the quantity of a good that can be 
imported by one country from the other country. In the early 1980s, the United States 
and Japan negotiated a VER that limited the quantity of automobiles the United States 
would import from Japan. The Japanese government agreed to the VER primarily be-
cause it was afraid that if it did not, the United States would impose a tariff or quota on 
imports of Japanese automobiles. Quotas and VERs have similar economic effects.
The main purpose of most tariffs and quotas is to reduce the foreign competition 
that domestic firms face. For many years, Congress has imposed a quota on sugar im-
ports to protect U.S. sugar producers. Figure 9.7 shows the actual statistics for the U.S. 
sugar market in 2010. The effect of a quota is very similar to the effect of a tariff. By 
limiting imports, a quota forces the domestic price of a good above the world price. 
In this case, the sugar quota limits sugar imports to 5.3 billion pounds (shown by the 
bracket in Figure 9.7), forcing the U.S. price of sugar up to $0.53 per pound, or $0.25 
higher than the world price of $0.28 per pound. The U.S. price is above the world price 
because the quota keeps foreign sugar producers from selling the additional sugar in the 
United States that would drive the price down to the world price. At a price of $0.53 per 
pound, U.S. producers increase the quantity of sugar they supply from the 4.7 billion 
pounds they would supply at the world price to 15.9 billion pounds, and U.S. consumers 
cut back their purchases of sugar from the 27.5 billion pounds they would purchase at 
the world price to the 21.2 billion pounds they are willing to purchase at the higher U.S. 
price. If there were no import quota, equilibrium would be at the world price (point E), 
but with the quota equilibrium is at the U.S. price (point F).
Measuring the Economic Effect of the Sugar Quota
We can use the concepts of consumer surplus, producer surplus, and deadweight loss 
to measure the economic impact of the sugar quota. Without a sugar quota, the world 
price of $0.28 per pound would also be the U.S. price. In Figure 9.7, without a sugar

government imposes on the quantity

Figure 9.7 
The Economic Effect of the U.S. 
Sugar Quota
Without a sugar quota, U.S. sugar producers 
would have sold 4.7 billion pounds of sugar, 
U.S. consumers would have purchased 27.5 
billion pounds of sugar, and imports would 
have been 22.8 billion pounds. The U.S. 
price would have equaled the world price of 
$0.28 per pound. Because the sugar quota 
limits imports to 5.3 billion pounds (the 
bracket in the graph), the price of sugar in 
the United States rises to $0.53 per pound, 
and U.S. producers supply 15.9  billion 
pounds. U.S. consumers purchase 21.2 
 billion pounds rather than the 27.5 billion 
pounds they would purchase at the world 
price. Without the import quota, equilib-
rium would be at point E; with the quota, 
equilibrium is at point F. The sugar quota 
causes a loss of consumer surplus equal to 
the area A + B + C + D. The area A is the 
gain to U.S. sugar producers. The area B is 
the gain to foreign sugar producers. The 
areas C and D represent deadweight loss. 
The total loss to U.S. consumers in 2010 was

quota, consumer surplus would equal the area above the $0.28 price line and below the 
demand curve. The sugar quota causes the U.S. price to rise to $0.53 and reduces con-
sumer surplus by the area A + B + C + D. Without a sugar quota, producer surplus re-
ceived by U.S. sugar producers would be equal to the area below the $0.28 price line and 
above the supply curve. The higher U.S. price resulting from the sugar quota increases 
the producer surplus of U.S. sugar producers by an amount equal to area A.
A foreign producer must have a license from the U.S. government to import sugar un-
der the quota system. Therefore, a foreign sugar producer that is lucky enough to have an 
import license also benefits from the quota because it is able to sell sugar in the U.S. market 
at $0.53 per pound instead of $0.28 per pound. The gain to foreign sugar producers is area 
B. Areas A and B represent transfers from U.S. consumers of sugar to U.S. and foreign pro-
ducers of sugar. Areas C and D represent losses to U.S. consumers that are not captured by 
anyone. These areas are deadweight loss and represent the decline in economic efficiency 
resulting from the sugar quota. Area C shows the effect of U.S. consumers being forced to 
buy from U.S. producers that are less efficient than foreign producers, and area D shows the 
effect of U.S. consumers buying less sugar than they would have at the world price.
Figure 9.7 provides enough information to calculate the dollar value of each of the 
four areas. The table in the figure shows the results of these calculations. The total loss to 
consumers from the sugar quota was $6.08 billion in 2010. About 42 percent of the loss 
to consumers, or $2.56 billion, was gained by U.S. sugar producers as increased producer 
surplus. About 22 percent, or $1.33 billion, was gained by foreign sugar producers as in-
creased producer surplus, and about 36 percent, or $2.19 billion, was a deadweight loss to 
the U.S. economy. The U.S. International Trade Commission estimates that eliminating 
the sugar quota would result in the loss of about 3,000 jobs in the U.S. sugar industry. 
The cost to U.S. consumers of saving these jobs is equal to $6.08 billion/3,000, or about 
$2,026,667 per job. In fact, this cost is an underestimate because eliminating the sugar 
quota would result in new jobs being created, particularly in the candy industry. Over the 
years, several U.S. candy companies—including the makers of Life Savers and Star Brite 
mints—have moved factories to other countries to escape the effects of the sugar quota.

The High Cost of Preserving Jobs with Tariffs  
and Quotas
The sugar quota is not alone in imposing a high cost on U.S. consumers to save jobs at 
U.S. firms. Table 9.5 shows, for several industries, the costs tariffs and quotas impose on 
U.S. consumers per year for each job saved.
Many countries besides the United States also use tariffs and quotas to try to protect 
jobs. Table 9.6 shows the cost to Japanese consumers per year for each job saved as a re-
sult of tariffs and quotas in the listed industries. Note the staggering cost of $51 million 
for each job saved that is imposed on Japanese consumers by their government’s restric-
tions on imports of rice.

Government Policies That Restrict International Trade 
291
Just as the sugar quota costs jobs in the candy industry, other tariffs and quotas 
cost jobs outside the industries immediately affected. For example, in 1991, the United 
States imposed tariffs on flat-panel displays used in laptop computers. This was good 
news for U.S. producers of these displays but bad news for companies producing laptop 
computers. Toshiba, Sharp, and Apple all closed their U.S. laptop production facilities 
and moved production overseas. In fact, whenever one industry receives tariff or quota 
protection, jobs are lost in other domestic industries.

Save Jobs Making Hangers . . .  
and Lose Jobs in Dry Cleaning
When supporters of tariffs and quotas argue that these inter-
ferences with trade save jobs, they are referring to jobs in the 
industry protected by the tariffs and quotas. We have seen 
that a tariff or quota makes it easier for domestic firms to compete 
against foreign firms that may have lower costs. More production 
by domestic firms means more employment at those firms, thereby 
saving jobs in that industry. But as we have also seen, other indus-
tries can see their costs rise as a result of the tariff or quota, causing 
firms in these industries to raise prices. Higher prices will reduce the 
quantity demanded resulting in lower production and fewer jobs in 
those industries.
This is just what happened when the United States raised 
the tariff on wire garment hangers imported from China. Under 
trade agreements signed with other countries, the United States 
is  allowed to impose tariffs on imports if foreign firms are selling 
products in the United States at below their production cost. The 
U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) determined that Chi-
nese firms had, in fact, been selling wire garment hangers in the 
United States at below the firms’ production cost and so imposed a tariff on imports 
of the hangers. Dry cleaners in the United States use a lot of wire hangers, so the tariff 
sharply increased the cleaners’ costs. For example, a dry cleaner in East Harlem in New 
York City found that the price of a box of 500 hangers rose from $17.50 to $40. The dry 
cleaner uses 4,000 hangers per week, so his costs rose by $180 per week, or by $9,360 
per year. The dry cleaning industry is made up of thousands of mostly small firms and 
is highly competitive. Small dry cleaners had difficulty absorbing the increased cost. 
The owner of the East Harlem dry cleaner was quoted as saying, “We can’t do this 
 business any more.”
At the time the tariff was imposed, the dry cleaning industry employed 221,230 
workers. Over the following two years, employment declined by about 17,000  workers, 
although not all of this decline was due to the increase in the cost of hangers. The ITC

C H A P T E R  9  Comparative Advantage and the Gains from International Trade
Gains from Unilateral Elimination of Tariffs 
and Quotas
Some politicians argue that eliminating U.S. tariffs and quotas would help the U.S. econ-
omy only if other countries eliminated their tariffs and quotas in exchange. It is easier to 
gain political support for reducing or eliminating tariffs or quotas if it is done as part of 
an agreement with other countries that involves their eliminating some of their tariffs or 
quotas. But as the example of the sugar quota shows, the U.S. economy would gain from 
the elimination of tariffs and quotas even if other countries did not reduce their tariffs and 
quotas.
Other Barriers to Trade
In addition to tariffs and quotas, governments sometimes erect other barriers to trade. 
For example, all governments require that imports meet certain health and safety 
 requirements. Sometimes, however, governments use these requirements to shield 
 domestic firms from foreign competition. This can be true when a government imposes 
stricter health and safety requirements on imported goods than on goods produced by 
domestic firms.
Many governments also restrict imports of certain products on national security 
grounds. The argument is that in time of war, a country should not be dependent on im-
ports of critical war materials. Once again, these restrictions are sometimes used more 
to protect domestic companies from competition than to protect national security. For 
example, for years, the U.S. government would buy military uniforms only from U.S. 
manufacturers, even though uniforms are not a critical war material.
The Arguments over Trade Policies 
and Globalization
The argument over whether the U.S. government should regulate international trade 
dates back to the early days of the country. One particularly controversial attempt to 
 restrict trade took place during the Great Depression of the 1930s. At that time, the 
United States and other countries attempted to help domestic firms by raising tariffs 
on foreign imports. The United States started the process by passing the Smoot- Hawley 
Tariff in 1930, which raised average tariff rates to more than 50 percent. As other 
 countries retaliated by raising their tariffs, international trade collapsed.
By the end of World War II in 1945, government officials in the United States and 
Europe were looking for a way to reduce tariffs and revive international trade. To help

estimated that the tariff would save about 300 jobs in U.S. factories producing wire 
hangers, and it would raise the average cost per dry cleaner by about $4,000 per year. 
At the time the tariff was imposed, there were about 30,000 dry cleaners in the United 
States, so the total cost of the tariff was about $120,000,000. The cost each year per job 
saved was about $120,000,000/300 5 $400,000. At the time, the typical worker making 
wire hangers was earning about $31,000 per year.
As dry cleaners, their employees, and consumers buying wire hangers found out, 
tariffs can be both an expensive and ineffective way to attempt to preserve jobs.

The Arguments over Trade Policies and Globalization

achieve this goal, they set up the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 
1948. Countries that joined GATT agreed not to impose new tariffs or import quotas. 
In addition, a series of multilateral negotiations, called trade rounds, took place, in which 
countries agreed to reduce tariffs from the very high levels of the 1930s.
In the 1940s, most international trade was in goods, and the GATT agreement 
covered only goods. In the following decades, trade in services and in products incor-
porating intellectual property, such as software programs and movies, grew in impor-
tance. Many GATT members pressed for a new agreement that would cover services 
and intellectual property, as well as goods. A new agreement was negotiated, and in 
January 1995, GATT was replaced by the World Trade Organization (WTO), head-
quartered in Geneva, Switzerland. More than 150 countries are currently members of 
the WTO.
Why Do Some People Oppose the World Trade 
Organization?
During the years immediately after World War II, many low-income, or developing, 
countries enacted high tariffs and restricted investment by foreign companies. When 
these policies failed to produce much economic growth, many of these countries de-
cided during the 1980s to become more open to foreign trade and investment. This pro-
cess became known as globalization. Most developing countries joined the WTO and 
began to follow its policies.
During the 1990s, opposition to globalization began to increase. In 1999, this op-
position took a violent turn at a meeting of the WTO in Seattle, Washington. A large 
number of protestors assembled in Seattle to meet the WTO delegates. Protests started 
peacefully but quickly became violent. Protesters looted stores and burned cars, and 
many delegates were unable to leave their hotel rooms. Similar incidents have occurred 
at most WTO meetings in the years since.
Why would attempts to reduce trade barriers with the objective of increasing in-
come around the world cause such a furious reaction? The opposition to the WTO 
comes from three sources. First, some opponents are specifically against the globaliza-
tion process that began in the 1980s and became widespread in the 1990s. Second, other 
opponents have the same motivation as the supporters of tariffs in the 1930s—to erect 
trade barriers to protect domestic firms from foreign competition. Third, some critics of 
the WTO support globalization in principle but believe that the WTO favors the inter-
ests of the high-income countries at the expense of the low-income countries. Let’s look 
more closely at the sources of opposition to the WTO.
Anti-globalization Many of those who protest at WTO meetings distrust globaliza-
tion. Some believe that free trade and foreign investment destroy the distinctive cultures 
of many countries. As developing countries began to open their economies to imports 
from the United States and other high-income countries, these imports of food, cloth-
ing, movies, and other goods began to replace the equivalent local products. So, a teen-
ager in Thailand might be sitting in a McDonald’s restaurant, wearing Levi’s jeans and a 
Ralph Lauren shirt, listening to a recording by Lady Gaga on his iPod, before download-
ing The Dark Knight Rises to his iPad. Globalization has increased the variety of prod-
ucts available to consumers in developing countries, but some people argue that this is 
too high a price to pay for what they see as damage to local cultures.
Globalization has also allowed multinational corporations to relocate factories from 
high-income countries to low-income countries. These new factories in  Indonesia, 
 Malaysia, Pakistan, and other countries pay much lower wages than are paid in the 
United States, Europe, and Japan and often do not meet the environmental or safety 
regulations that are imposed in high-income countries. Some factories use child labor, 
which is illegal in high-income countries. Some people have argued that firms with 
 factories in developing countries should pay workers wages as high as those paid in 
high-income countries. They also believe these firms should abide by the health, safety, 
and environmental regulations that exist in the high-income countries.

C H A P T E R  9  Comparative Advantage and the Gains from International Trade
The governments of most developing countries have resisted these proposals. They 
argue that when the currently rich countries were poor, they also lacked  environmental 
or safety standards, and their workers were paid low wages. They argue that it is  easier 
for rich countries to afford high wages and environmental and safety regulations than 
it is for poor countries. They also point out that many jobs that seem to have very 
low wages based on the standards of high-income countries are often better than the 
 alternatives available to workers in low-income countries.
The Unintended Consequences of 
Banning Goods Made with Child 
Labor
In many developing countries, such as Indonesia, Thailand, 
and Peru, children as young as seven or eight work 10 or more hours a day. Reports of 
very young workers laboring long hours, producing goods for export, have upset many 
people in high-income countries. In the United States, boycotts have been organized 
against stores that stock goods made in developing countries 
with child labor. Many people assume that if child workers 
in developing countries weren’t working in factories making 
clothing, toys, and other products, they would be in school, as 
are children in high-income countries.
In fact, children in developing countries usually have few 
good alternatives to work. Schooling is frequently available for 
only a few months each year, and even children who attend 
school rarely do so for more than a few years. Poor families are 
often unable to afford even the small costs of sending their chil-
dren to school. Families may rely on the earnings of very young 
children to survive, as poor families once did in the United 
States, Europe, and Japan. There is substantial evidence that 
as incomes begin to rise in poor countries, families rely less on 
child labor. The United States eventually outlawed child labor, 
but not until 1938. In developing countries where child labor is 
common today, jobs producing export goods are usually better paying and less hazard-
ous than the alternatives.
As preparations began in France for the 1998 World Cup, there were protests that 
Baden Sports—the main supplier of soccer balls—was purchasing the balls from sup-
pliers in Pakistan that used child workers. France decided to ban all use of soccer balls 
made by child workers. Bowing to this pressure, Baden Sports moved production from 
Pakistan, where the balls were hand-stitched by child workers, to China, where the balls 
were machine-stitched by adult workers in factories. There was some criticism of the 
boycott of hand-stitched soccer balls at the time. In a broad study of child labor, three 
economists argued:
Of the array of possible employment in which impoverished children might engage, 
 soccer ball stitching is probably one of the most benign. . . . [In Pakistan] children 
 generally work alongside other family members in the home or in small workshops. . . . 
Nor are the children exposed to toxic chemicals, hazardous tools or brutal working 
conditions. Rather, the only serious criticism concerns the length of the typical child 
stitcher’s work-day and the impact on formal education.
In fact, the alternatives to soccer ball stitching for child workers in Pakistan turned 
out to be extremely grim. According to Keith Maskus, an economist at the University of 
Colorado and the World Bank, a “large proportion” of the children who lost their jobs 
stitching soccer balls ended up begging or in prostitution.

The Arguments over Trade Policies and Globalization  
295
“Old-Fashioned” Protectionism The anti-globalization argument against free 
trade and the WTO is relatively new. Another argument against free trade, called pro-
tectionism, has been around for centuries. Protectionism is the use of trade barriers 
to shield domestic firms from foreign competition. For as long as international trade 
has existed, governments have attempted to restrict it to protect domestic firms. As we 
saw with the analysis of the sugar quota, protectionism causes losses to consumers and 
eliminates jobs in the domestic industries that buy the protected product. In addition, 
by reducing the ability of countries to produce according to comparative advantage, 
protectionism reduces incomes.
Why, then, does protectionism attract support? Protectionism is usually justified on 
the basis of one of the following arguments:
• 
Saving jobs. Supporters of protectionism argue that free trade reduces employment 
by driving domestic firms out of business. It is true that when more-efficient for-
eign firms drive less-efficient domestic firms out of business, jobs are lost, but jobs 
are also lost when more-efficient domestic firms drive less-efficient domestic firms 
out of business. These job losses are rarely permanent. In the U.S. economy, jobs 
are lost and new jobs are created continually. No economic study has ever found a 
long-term connection between the total number of jobs available and the level of 
tariff protection for domestic industries. In addition, trade restrictions destroy jobs 
in some industries at the same time that they preserve jobs in others. The U.S. sugar 
quota may have saved jobs in the U.S. sugar industry, but it has also destroyed jobs 
in the U.S. candy industry.
• 
Protecting high wages. Some people worry that firms in high-income countries 
will have to start paying much lower wages to compete with firms in developing 
countries. This fear is misplaced, however, because free trade actually raises living 
standards by increasing economic efficiency. When a country practices protection-
ism and produces goods and services it could obtain more inexpensively from other 
countries, it reduces its standard of living. The United States could ban imports of 
coffee and begin growing it domestically. But this would entail a very high oppor-
tunity cost because coffee could only be grown in the continental United States in 
greenhouses and would require large amounts of labor and equipment. The coffee 
would have to sell for a very high price to cover these costs. Suppose the United 
States did ban coffee imports: Eliminating the ban at some future time would elimi-
nate the jobs of U.S. coffee workers, but the standard of living in the United States 
would rise as coffee prices declined and labor, machinery, and other resources 
moved out of coffee production and into production of goods and services for 
which the United States has a comparative advantage.
• 
Protecting infant industries. It is possible that firms in a country may have a com-
parative advantage in producing a good, but because the country begins production 
of the good later than other countries, its firms initially have higher costs. In pro-
ducing some goods and services, substantial “learning by doing” occurs. As workers 
and firms produce more of the good or service, they gain experience and become 
more productive. Over time, costs and prices will fall. As the firms in the “infant 
industry” gain experience, their costs will fall, and they will be able to compete 
successfully with foreign producers. Under free trade, however, they may not get a 
chance. The established foreign producers can sell the product at a lower price and 
drive domestic producers out of business before they gain enough experience to

compete. To economists, this is the most persuasive of the protectionist arguments. 
It has a significant drawback, however. Tariffs used to protect an infant industry 
eliminate the need for the firms in the industry to become productive enough to 
compete with foreign firms. After World War II, the governments of many develop-
ing countries used the “infant industry” argument to justify high tariff rates. Unfor-
tunately, most of their infant industries never grew up, and they continued for years 
as inefficient drains on their economies.
• 
Protecting national security. As already discussed, a country should not rely on 
other countries for goods that are critical to its military defense. For example, 
the United States would probably not want to import all its jet fighter engines 
from China. The definition of which goods are critical to military defense is a 
slippery one, however. In fact, it is rare for an industry to ask for protection 
without raising the issue of national security, even if its products have mainly 
nonmilitary uses.
Dumping
In recent years, the United States has extended protection to some domestic industries 
by using a provision in the WTO agreement that allows governments to impose tar-
iffs in the case of dumping. Dumping is selling a product for a price below its cost of 
production. Although allowable under the WTO agreement, using tariffs to offset the 
 effects of dumping is very controversial.
In practice, it is difficult to determine whether foreign companies are dumping 
goods because the true production costs of a good are not easy for foreign governments 
to calculate. As a result, the WTO allows countries to determine that dumping has 
 occurred if a product is exported for a lower price than it sells for on the home market. 
There is a problem with this approach, however. Often there are good business reasons 
for a firm to sell a product for different prices to different consumers. For  example, 
the airlines charge business travelers higher ticket prices than leisure travelers. Firms 
also use “loss leaders”—products that are sold below cost, or even given away free—
when introducing a new product or, in the case of retailing, to attract customers who 
will also buy full-price products. For example, during the holiday season, Wal-Mart 
sometimes offers toys at prices below what they pay to buy them from manufacturers. 
It’s unclear why these normal business practices should be unacceptable when used in 
international trade.
Positive versus Normative Analysis  
(Once Again)
Economists emphasize the burden on the economy imposed by tariffs, quotas, and other 
government restrictions on free trade. Does it follow that these interferences are bad? 
Remember from Chapter 1 the distinction between positive analysis and normative anal-
ysis. Positive analysis concerns what is. Normative analysis concerns what ought to be. 
Measuring the effect of the sugar quota on the U.S. economy is an example of positive 
analysis. Asserting that the sugar quota is bad public policy and should be eliminated 
is normative analysis. The sugar quota—like all other interferences with trade—makes 
some people better off and some people worse off, and it reduces total income and con-
sumption. Whether increasing the profits of U.S. sugar companies and the number of 
workers they employ justifies the costs imposed on consumers and the reduction in 
 economic efficiency is a normative question.
Most economists do not support interferences with trade, such as the sugar quota. 
Few people become economists if they don’t believe that markets should usually be as 
free as possible. But the opposite view is certainly intellectually respectable. It is possible 
for someone to understand the costs of tariffs and quotas but still believe that tariffs and 
quotas are a good idea, perhaps because they believe unrestricted free trade would cause 
too much disruption to the economy.
Dumping Selling a product for a 
price below its cost of production.

 
Conclusion 
297
The success of industries in getting the government to erect barriers to foreign 
competition depends partly on some members of the public knowing the costs of trade 
barriers but supporting them anyway. However, two other factors are also at work:
 1. The costs tariffs and quotas impose on consumers are large in total but relatively 
small per person. For example, the sugar quota imposes a total burden of about 
$6.08 billion per year on consumers. Spread across 310 million Americans, the bur-
den is less than $20 per person: too little for most people to worry about, even if they 
know the burden exists.
 2. The jobs lost to foreign competition are easy to identify, but the jobs created by for-
eign trade are less easy to identify.
In other words, the industries that benefit from tariffs and quotas benefit a lot—for 
example, the sugar quota increases the profits of U.S. sugar producers by $2.28 billion—
whereas each consumer loses relatively little. This concentration of benefits and widely 
spread burdens makes it easy to understand why members of Congress receive strong 
pressure from some industries to enact tariffs and quotas and relatively little pressure 
from the general public to reduce them.

Economics in Your Life
Have You Heard of the “Buy American” Provision?
At the beginning of the chapter, we asked you to consider how some U.S. companies convinced 
Congress to include the Buy American provision in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act 
and why relatively few people have heard of this provision. In the chapter, we saw that trade 
restrictions tend to preserve relatively few jobs in the protected industries, while leading to job 
losses in other industries and costing consumers billions per year in higher prices. This might seem 
to increase the mystery of why Congress enacted the Buy American provision. We have also seen, 
though, that per person, the burden of specific trade restrictions can be small. The sugar quota, 
for instance, imposes a per-person cost on consumers of only about $19 per year. Not many people 
will take the trouble of writing a letter to their member of Congress or otherwise make their views 
known in the hope of saving $19 per year. In fact, few people will even spend the time to become 
aware that a specific trade restriction exists. So, if before you read this chapter you had never 
heard of the Buy American provision, you are certainly not alone.
Conclusion
There are few issues economists agree upon more than the economic benefits of free 
trade. However, there are few political issues as controversial as government policy to-
ward trade. Many people who would be reluctant to see the government interfere with 
domestic trade are quite willing to see it interfere with international trade. The damage 
high tariffs inflicted on the world economy during the 1930s shows what can happen 
when governments around the world abandon free trade. Whether future episodes of 
that type can be avoided is by no means certain.

us as producer of goods. It has hurt 
wages and it has hurt GDP,” Scott 
said.
“I tend to think that U.S. compa-
nies are increasingly outsourcing pro-
duction and I think that has hurt the 
American economy,” said Scott, who 
views the Buy American Act as a net 
benefit to the U.S. economy.

the Buy American provision raises the price 
of steel in the United States to P2, which 
is above the world price, and equilibrium 
moves from point A to point B. U.S. con-
sumption of steel falls from Q4 to Q3, the 
quantity of steel supplied by U.S. steel 
 producers increases from Q1 to Q2, and 
 imports of foreign steel decline from Q4 − 
Q1 to Q3 − Q2. U.S. steel companies—and 
their workers—gain from the provision, as 
do  foreign steel companies still able to sell 
in the United States because they receive a 
price higher than the world price. However, 
U.S. consumers—and taxpayers—lose 
 because they must now pay a price above 
the world price.
Thinking Critically 
about Policy
1. The Buy American provision, as well as 
tariffs and quotas on foreign imports, 
are intended to save jobs in the United 
States. Do they, in fact, save jobs? Do 
you support these trade restrictions? 
Briefly explain.
2. Consumers lose when the government 
interferes with trade as it did with the 
Buy American provision. Why, then, does 
 Congress enact such legislation? 
sion. The table below lists several major 
companies that made settlement payments 
to the U.S. government following litigation 
for allegedly violating the Buy American 
provision or the Trade Agreements Act.
Key Points in the Article
A lawsuit filed against Home Depot, alleged 
that the Atlanta-based home improvement 
company knowingly violated the Buy Amer-
ican provision of the American Recovery 
and Reinvestment Act of 2009 by selling to 
U.S. government agencies products pro-
hibited by the legislation. A spokesman for 
Home Depot denied the allegations, claim-
ing that the company would never inten-
tionally sell prohibited goods and that the 
plaintiffs in the lawsuit had misinterpreted 
the facts surrounding the case.
Analyzing the News
a Part of the American Recovery and Re-
investment Act of 2009, the Buy Ameri-
can provision required that all manufactured 
goods purchased with funds authorized un-
der the act be made in the United States. In 
1979, the United States passed the Trade 
Agreements Act, which mandates that the 
government only purchase end products 
valued over a specific dollar amount if they 
are made in the United States or come from 
a list of designated countries, unless the 
desired product is not available from these 
countries. Some view the Buy American 
provision as a partner of the Trade Agree-
ments Act in the promotion of U.S. pro-
duced goods. The Home Depot case is not 
the first filed against a major U.S. corpora-
tion for violating the Buy  American provi-

b Critics of the Buy American provision ar-
gue that paying more for U.S.-produced 
products when lower-priced products are 
available from other countries misallocates 
resources and drives up the costs of some 
projects being funded with federal money. 
Because the total amount of spending under 
the American Recovery and Reinvestment 
Act of 2009 was fixed, the more costly each 
project was, the fewer projects that would 
be funded. The Buy American provision was 
intended to increase employment in the 
United States, but if resources are being 
misallocated and, as a result, fewer projects 
can be funded, the number of new jobs cre-
ated would be reduced.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE: Discuss the role of international trade in the U.S. economy.
Summary
International trade has been increasing in recent decades, in part 
because of reductions in tariffs and other barriers to trade. A tar-
iff is a tax imposed by a government on imports. The quantity of 
goods and services the United States imports and exports has been 
continually increasing. Imports are goods and services bought 
domestically but produced in other countries. Exports are goods 
and services produced domestically and sold to other countries. 
Today, the United States is the leading exporting country in the 
world, and about 20 percent of U.S. manufacturing jobs depend 
on exports.

1.2 Are imports and exports a smaller or larger fraction of 
GDP than they were 40 years ago?
 
1.3 Briefly explain whether you agree with the following state-

1.4 If the United States were to stop trading goods and services 
with other countries, which U.S. industries would be likely 
to see their sales decline the most? Briefly explain.
 
1.5 Briefly explain whether you agree with the following state-

in international trade than are most other nations. In 
fact, today Japan exports a larger fraction of its GDP than 
 Germany, Great Britain, or the United States.”
 
1.6 Why might a smaller country, such as the Netherlands, 
be more likely to import and export larger fractions of its 
GDP than would a larger country, such as China or the 
United States?
 
1.7 [Related to the Making the Connection on page 276] 
Douglas Irwin, a professor of economics at Dartmouth 
College, wrote the following in a column in the New York 
Times:
General Electric and Caterpillar have op-
posed the Buy American provision because 
they fear it will hurt their ability to win con-
tracts abroad. . . . Once we get through the 
current economic mess, China, India and 
other countries are likely to continue their 
large investments in building projects. If such 
countries also adopt our preferences for do-
mestic producers, then America will be at a 
competitive disadvantage in bidding for those 
contracts.
 
 What are “preferences for domestic producers”? Why 
would these preferences put U.S. firms at a “competitive 
disadvantage”? Why might having difficulty making sales 
in China and India be a particular problem for Caterpillar?

Summary
Comparative advantage is the ability of an individual, a business, 
or a country to produce a good or service at the lowest opportu-
nity cost. Absolute advantage is the ability to produce more of a 
good or service than competitors when using the same amount of 
resources. Countries trade on the basis of comparative advantage, 
not on the basis of absolute advantage.

2.8 Patrick J. Buchanan, a former presidential candidate, ar-
gued in his book on the global economy that there is a flaw 
in David Ricardo’s theory of comparative advantage:
Classical free trade theory fails the test of 
common sense. According to Ricardo’s law of 
comparative advantage . . . if America makes 
better computers and textiles than China does, 
but our advantage in computers is greater than 
our advantage in textiles, we should (1) focus 
on computers, (2) let China make textiles, and  
(3) trade U.S. computers for Chinese 
textiles. . . .
The doctrine begs a question. If Americans 
are more efficient than Chinese in making 
clothes . . . why surrender the more efficient 
American industry? Why shift to a reliance on 
a Chinese textile industry that will take years 
to catch up to where American factories are 
today?
 
 Do you agree with Buchanan’s argument? Briefly explain.

Economy, (Boston: Little, Brown & Company), 1998, p. 66.
 
2.9 In a 2007 debate among Democratic presidential can-
didates, Barack Obama made the following statement: 
“Well, look, people don’t want a cheaper T-shirt if they’re 
losing a job in the process.” What did Obama mean by the 
phrase “losing a job in the process”? Using the economic 
concept of comparative advantage, explain under what 
circumstances it would make sense for the United States 
to produce all of the T-shirts purchased in the United 
States. Do you agree with Obama’s statement? Briefly 
explain.

C H A P T E R  9  Comparative Advantage and the Gains from International Trade
Summary
Autarky is a situation in which a country does not trade with 
other countries. The terms of trade is the ratio at which a coun-
try can trade its exports for imports from other countries. When a 
country specializes in producing goods where it has a comparative 
advantage and trades for the other goods it needs, the country will 
have a higher level of income and consumption. We do not see 
complete specialization in production for three reasons: Not all 
goods and services are traded internationally, production of most 
goods involves increasing opportunity costs, and tastes for prod-
ucts differ across countries. Although the population of a country 
as a whole benefits from trade, companies—and their workers—
that are unable to compete with lower-cost foreign producers lose. 
Among the main sources of comparative advantage are climate 
and natural resources, relative abundance of labor and capital, 
technology, and external economies. External economies are re-
ductions in a firm’s costs that result from an increase in the size 
of an industry. A country may develop a comparative advantage 
in the production of a good, and then as time passes and circum-
stances change, the country may lose its comparative advantage 
in producing that good and develop a comparative advantage in 
producing other goods.

a. Explain which country has an absolute advantage in the 
production of hats and which country has an absolute 
advantage in the production of beer.
 
b. Explain which country has a comparative advantage in 
the production of hats and which country has a com-
parative advantage in the production of beer.
 
c. Suppose that Chile and Argentina currently do not 
trade with each other. Each has 1,000 hours of labor to 
use producing hats and beer, and the countries are cur-
rently producing the amounts of each good shown in 
the following table:
Hats
Beer
Chile
7,200

Using this information, give a numerical example of 
how Chile and Argentina can both gain from trade. 
Assume that after trading begins, one hat can be ex-
changed for one barrel of beer.
 
3.6 [Related to Solved Problem 9.3 on page 280] A political 
commentator makes the following statement:
The idea that international trade should be 
based on the comparative advantage of each 
country is fine for rich countries like the 
United States and Japan. Rich countries have 
educated workers and large quantities of ma-
chinery and equipment. These advantages 
allow them to produce every product more 
efficiently than poor countries can. Poor 
 countries like Kenya and Bolivia have nothing 
to gain from international trade based on com-
parative advantage.
 
 Do you agree with this argument? Briefly explain.
 
3.7 Briefly explain whether you agree with the following 
statement: “Most countries exhaust their comparative 
 advantage in producing a good or service before they reach 
complete specialization.”
 
3.8 Is free trade likely to benefit a large, populous country 
more than a small country with fewer people? Briefly 
explain.
 
3.9 An article in the New Yorker magazine states, “the main 
burden of trade-related job losses and wage declines 
has fallen on middle- and lower-income Americans. 
But . . . the very people who suffer most from free trade 
are often, paradoxically, among its biggest beneficiaries.” 
Explain how it is possible that middle- and lower-income 
Americans are both the biggest losers and at the same time 
the biggest winners from free trade.

run: consumers.

tion  possibilities frontier for cashew nuts and  mangoes. 
Assume that the output per hour of work is 8 bushels of 
cashew nuts or 2 bushels of mangoes, and that Tanzania 
has 1,000 hours of labor. Without trade,  Tanzania evenly 
splits its labor hours between cashews and  mangoes and 
 produces and consumes at point A.
Summary
Free trade is trade between countries without government re-
strictions. Government policies that interfere with trade usu-
ally take the form of tariffs, quotas, or voluntary export restraints 
(VERs). A tariff is a tax imposed by a government on imports. A 
quota is a numeric limit imposed by a government on the quan-
tity of a good that can be imported into the country. A voluntary 
export restraint (VER) is an agreement negotiated between two 
countries that places a numerical limit on the quantity of a good 
that can be imported by one country from the other country. The 
federal government’s sugar quota costs U.S. consumers $6.08 bil-
lion per year, or about $2,026,667 per year for each job saved in 
the sugar industry. Saving jobs by using tariffs and quotas is often 
very expensive.

Review Questions
 
4.1 What is a tariff? What is a quota? Give an example, other 
than a quota, of a non-tariff barrier to trade.
 
4.2 Who gains and who loses when a country imposes a tariff 
or a quota on imports of a good?
Problems and Applications
 
4.3 In a public opinion poll, 47 percent of people respond-
ing believed that free trade hurts the U.S. economy, while 
only 23 percent believed that it helps the economy. (The 
remaining people were uncertain about the effects of free 
trade or believed that it did not make much difference.) 
What is “free trade”? Do you believe it helps or hurts the 
economy? (Be sure to define what you mean by “helps” or 
“hurts.”) Why do you think that more Americans appear to 
believe that free trade hurts the economy than believe that 
it helps the economy?

the chairman of the International Chamber of Commerce, 
comments on the 2009 G20 summit in London: “While 
global leaders promise to fight protectionism when they

LEARNING OBJECTIVE: Analyze the economic effects of government policies that restrict international trade.
 
a. Suppose Tanzania opens trade with Kenya, and Kenya’s 
output per hour of work is 1 bushel of cashew nuts or 1 
bushel of mangoes. Having the comparative advantage, 
Tanzania completely specializes in cashew nuts. How 
many bushels of cashew nuts can Tanzania produce? 
Denote this point on the graph as point B.
 
b. Suppose Tanzania keeps 5,000 bushels of cashew nuts 
and exports the remaining 3,000 bushels. If the terms of 
trade are 1 bushel of mangoes for 2 bushels of cashew 
nuts, how many bushels of mangoes will Tanzania get 
in exchange? Denote on the graph the quantity of ca-
shew nuts and mangoes that Tanzania consumes with 
trade and label this point as point C. How does point C 
with trade compare to point A without trade?
 
c. With trade, is Tanzania producing on its production 
possibilities frontier? With trade, is Tanzania consum-
ing on its production possibilities frontier?

job-killing trade agreements.” Do you agree with these sen-
ators that reducing barriers to trade reduces the number

a. Draw a graph showing the demand and supply of beef 
in the United States. Assume that the United States can 
import as much as it wants at the world price of beef 
without causing the world price of beef to increase. 
Be sure to indicate on the graph the quantity of beef 
imported.
 
b. Now show on your graph the effect of the United States 
imposing a tariff on beef. Be sure to indicate on your 
graph the quantity of beef sold by U.S. producers before 
and after the tariff is imposed, the quantity of beef im-
ported before and after the tariff, and the price of beef 
in the United States before and after the tariff.
 
c. Discuss who benefits and who loses when the United 
States imposes a tariff on beef.
 
4.8 [Related to the Chapter Opener on page 273] Which 
U.S. firms are most likely to be unfavorably affected by a 
provision which states that only U.S. firms can participate 
in programs financed by federal spending?
 
4.9 When Congress was considering a bill to impose quotas on 
imports of textiles, shoes, and other products, the late Mil-
ton Friedman, a Nobel Prize–winning economist, made 
the following comment: “The consumer will be forced to 
spend several extra dollars to subsidize the producers [of 
these goods] by one dollar. A straight handout would be 
far cheaper.” Why would a quota result in consumers pay-
ing much more than domestic producers receive? Where 
do the other dollars go? What does Friedman mean by 
a “straight handout”? Why would this be cheaper than a 
quota?
Based on Milton Friedman, “Free Trade,” Newsweek Magazine, August 
27, 1970.
 4.10 The United States has about 9,000 rice farmers. In 2006, 
these rice farmers received $780 million in subsidy pay-
ments from the U.S. government (or nearly $87,000 per 
farmer). These payments result in U.S. farmers producing 
much more rice than they otherwise would, a substantial 
amount of which is exported. According to an article in the 
Wall Street Journal, Kpalagim Mome, a farmer in the Afri-
can country of Ghana, can no longer find buyers in Ghana 
for his rice:
“We can’t sell our rice anymore. It gets worse 
every year,” Mr. Mome says. . . . Years of eco-
nomic hardship have driven three of his broth-
ers to walk and hitchhike 2,000 miles across 
the Sahara to reach the Mediterranean and 
Europe. His sister plans to leave next year.  
Mr. Mome’s plight is repeated throughout farm 
communities in Africa and elsewhere in the 
developing world.
 
 Why would subsidies paid by the U.S. government to 
U.S. rice farmers reduce the incomes of rice farmers in 
Africa?

cans Adrift,” Wall Street Journal, December 27, 2006.
 4.11 A student makes the following argument:
Tariffs on imports of foreign goods into the 
United States will cause the foreign companies 
to add the amount of the tariff to the prices 
they charge in the United States for those 
goods. Instead of putting a tariff on imported 
goods, we should ban importing them. Ban-
ning imported goods is better than putting 
tariffs on them because U.S. producers ben-
efit from the reduced competition, and U.S. 
consumers don’t have to pay the higher prices 
caused by tariffs.
 
 Briefly explain whether you agree with the student’s 
reasoning.
 4.12 Suppose China decides to pay large subsidies to any Chi-
nese company that exports goods or services to the United 
States. As a result, these companies are able to sell prod-
ucts in the United States at far below their cost of produc-
tion. In addition, China decides to bar all imports from the 
United States. The dollars that the United States pays to 
import Chinese goods are left in banks in China. Will this 
strategy raise or lower the standard of living in China? Will 
it raise or lower the standard of living in the United States? 
Briefly explain. Be sure to provide a definition of “standard 
of living” in your answer.

An economic analysis of a proposal to impose a quota 
on steel imports into the United States indicated that the 
quota would save 3,700 jobs in the steel industry but cost 
about 35,000 jobs in other U.S. industries. Why would a 
quota on steel imports cause employment to fall in other 
industries? Which other industries are likely to be most 
affected?

Summary
The World Trade Organization (WTO) is an international orga-
nization that enforces international trade agreements. The WTO 
has promoted globalization, the process of countries becoming 
more open to foreign trade and investment. Some critics of the 
WTO argue that globalization has damaged local cultures around 
the world. Other critics oppose the WTO because they believe in 
protectionism, which is the use of trade barriers to shield domes-
tic firms from foreign competition. The WTO allows countries to 
use tariffs in cases of dumping, when an imported product is sold 
for a price below its cost of production. Economists can point out 
the burden imposed on the economy by tariffs, quotas, and other 
government interferences with free trade. But whether these poli-
cies should be used is a normative decision.

The following excerpt is from a newspaper story on Presi-
dent Bill Clinton’s proposal to create a group within the 
Word Trade Organization (WTO) responsible for devel-
oping labor standards. The story was published just before 
the 1999 WTO meeting in Seattle that ended in rioting:
[President Clinton proposed that] core labor 
standards . . . become “part of every trade 
agreement. And ultimately I would favor a 
system in which sanctions would come for vio-
lating any provision of a trade agreement. . . .” 
But the new U.S. stand is sure to meet massive 
resistance from developing countries, which 
make up more than 100 of the 135 countries in 
the WTO. They are not interested in adopting 
tougher U.S. labor standards.
 
 What did Clinton mean by “core labor standards”? 
Why would developing countries resist adopting these 
standards?

5.6 Steven Landsburg, an economist at the University of Roch-
ester, wrote the following in an article in the New York 
Times:
Free trade is not only about the right of Ameri-
can consumers to buy at the cheapest possible 
price; it’s also about the right of foreign pro-
ducers to earn a living. Steelworkers in West 
Virginia struggle hard to make ends meet. So 
do steelworkers in South Korea. To protect one 
at the expense of the other, solely because of 
where they happened to be born, is a moral 
outrage.
 
 How does the U.S. government protect steelworkers in 
West Virginia at the expense of steelworkers in South 
 Korea? Is Landsburg making a positive or a normative 
statement? A few days later, Tom Redburn published an 
article disagreeing with Landsburg:
It is not some evil character flaw to care more 
about the welfare of people nearby than about 
that of those far away—it’s human nature. And it 
is morally—and economically—defensible. . . .  
A society that ignores the consequences of eco-
nomic disruption on those among its citizens 
who come out at the short end of the stick is 
not only heartless, it also undermines its own 
cohesion and adaptability.
 
 Which of the two arguments do you find most convincing?
Based on Steven E. Landsburg, “Who Cares if the Playing Field Is 
Level?” The New York Times, June 13, 2001; and Tom Redburn, “Eco-
nomic View: Of Politics, Free Markets, and Tending to Society,” The 
New York Times, June 17, 2001.
 
5.7 Suppose you are explaining the benefits of free trade and 
someone states, “I don’t understand all the principles of 
comparative advantage and gains from trade. I just know 
that if I buy something produced in America, I create a 
job for an American, and if I buy something produced in 
 Brazil, I create a job for a Brazilian.” Do you agree with this 
statement? When the United States imports products in 
which it does not have a comparative advantage, does that 
mean that there are fewer jobs in the United States? In the 
example in the text with Japan and America producing and 
trading cell phones and tablet computers, when the United 
States imports cell phones from Japan, does the number of 
jobs in the United States decline? 
 
5.8 [Related to the Chapter Opener on page 273] In a 
 forum in the New York Times on the Buy American pro-
vision in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, 
the editors posed the following question: “Why is the buy-
American idea objectionable, or, alternatively, under what 
circumstances should it be promoted?” Roger Simmer-
maker, the author of How Americans Can Buy American, 
responded:
The buy-American provision in the  economic 
stimulus bill isn’t as much about a return to 
protectionism as it is about a return to the 
American virtues and values—self-sufficiency, 
self-reliance and independence—that this 
country was founded on. Workers in foreign 
countries don’t pay taxes to America. Only 
American workers pay taxes to America. 
We need to employ American steelwork-
ers, ironworkers and autoworkers so we need 
to . . . keep and create American jobs.
 
 Burton Folsom Jr., a professor at Hillsdale College, offered 
an opposing view:
“Slap a tariff on China and save American 
jobs,” the protectionists say. This tempting line 
of reasoning is flawed for two reasons. First, if 
Americans pay more for, say, American-made 
shoes or shirts, then they have less to spend 
for other things they might need—they are 
simply subsidizing inefficient local producers. 
And those American manufacturers, who are 
protected from foreign competitors, have little 
incentive to innovate and cut prices. Second, 
if we refuse to buy China’s imports, China will 
refuse to buy our exports, including our first-
rate computers and iPods. Our export market 
collapses.
 
 Which of the two arguments do you find the most 
convincing?

5.9 President George W. Bush and President Barack 
Obama had trouble getting Congress to ratify free trade 
 agreements the United States had negotiated with South 
Korea, Colombia, and Panama. According to an article 
in the New York Times, “When the Democrats controlled 
Congress, they resisted the trade agreements because they 
feared they would harm American workers.” Is it likely that 
trade agreements that reduce tariffs and quotas will harm 
American workers? Briefly explain.

 5.10 The following appeared in an article in BusinessWeek 
that argued against free trade: “The U.S. is currently in 
a precarious position. In addition to geopolitical threats, 
we face a severe economic shock. We have already lost 
trillions of dollars and millions of jobs to foreigners.” If a 
country engages in free trade, is the total number of jobs 
in the country likely to decline? Briefly explain.

Economics in Your Life
Do You Make Rational Decisions?
Economists generally assume that people make decisions in a rational, consistent way. But are 
 people actually as rational as economists assume? Consider the following situation: You bought a 
concert ticket for $75, which is the most you were willing to pay. While you are in line to enter the 
concert hall, someone offers you $90 for the ticket. Would you sell the ticket? Would an economist 
think it is rational to sell the ticket? As you read the chapter, see if you can answer these questions. 
You can check your answers against those we provide on page 331 at the end of this chapter.
Marc Babej, an authority on marketing 
strategy, argues that survey responses are 
unreliable because advertisements appeal 
to the subconscious as well as the conscious 
mind. To be successful, Babej believes that 
celebrity endorsements must be relevant to 
the advertised product:
In . . . image-driven consumer categories 
such as fashion, perfume or liquor, ce-
lebrity endorsements can be credible. For 
sporting goods, endorsement by an athlete 
can work wonders. . . . But in [other] cat-
egories . . . a celebrity endorser isn’t likely 
to have much of a positive impact . . .  
[because] movie stars or athletes aren’t 
considered authorities in these areas.
Will Justin Bieber’s endorsement in-
crease Best Buy’s sales of cell phones? In 
this chapter, we will examine how consum-
ers make decisions about which products to 
buy. Firms must understand consumer be-
havior to determine what strategies are likely 
to be most effective in selling their products.
AN INSIDE LOOK on page 332 dis-
cusses whether endorsements from celebri-
ties ranging from Jennifer Lopez to Charlie 
Sheen can help or hurt a brand.
Based on Marc E. Babej, “Poll: Celebrity Endorsements 
Don’t Work . . . Don’t Tell Angelina,” Forbes, June 14, 2011; 
Amanda Massa, “Justin Bieber Leads List Of Celebrity 
100 Newcomers,” forbes.com, May 18, 2011; and Bruce 
 Horovitz, “Justin Bieber . . . and Ozzy? . . . to Star in Best 
Buy Super Bowl Ad,” USA Today, January 27, 2011.
Managers at Best Buy had an idea they  
believed people would love: The company 
would buy any cell phone or other electronic 
product back from their customers, within 
two years of purchase, and allow them to 
upgrade to a newer model. To announce 
this Buy Back program, Best Buy ran a new 
commercial during the 2011 Super Bowl, an 
opportunity to reach over 110 million view-
ers. This commercial featured an unlikely 
pair of celebrities: aging rock star Ozzie  
Osborne and teenage singing sensation 
 Justin Bieber. Although many Best Buy cus-
tomers are old enough to be the 16-year-old 
Bieber’s parents, demand for mobile and 
technology-related products was grow-
ing more than the demand for televisions 
and stereos that had fueled Best Buy’s past 
growth. The retailer was anxious to change 
its image. “Justin Bieber is the biggest star 
out there . . . ” explained marketing chief 
Drew Panayiotou. “He . . . represents some-
thing important to the brand message.”
In 2010, Forbes magazine ranked Justin 
Bieber as the third-most-powerful enter-
tainment personality in 2010, just behind 
Lady Gaga and Oprah Winfrey, and ahead of  
Taylor Swift, Simon Cowell, and LeBron 
James. Do celebrity endorsements affect 
consumer behavior? When asked in surveys, 
many consumers claim that celebrity endorse-
ments don’t influence their buying decisions.

C H A P T E R  1 0  Consumer Choice and Behavioral Economics
W
e begin this chapter by exploring how consumers make decisions. In 
Chapter 1, we saw that economists usually assume that people act in a 
rational, self-interested way. In explaining consumer behavior, this means 
economists believe consumers make choices that will leave them as satis-
fied as possible, given their tastes, their incomes, and the prices of the goods and services 
available to them. We will see how the downward-sloping demand curves we encountered 
in Chapters 3 through 5 result from the economic model of consumer behavior. We will also 
explore how in certain situations, knowing which decision is the best one can be difficult. 
In these cases, economic reasoning provides a powerful tool for consumers to improve their 
decision making. Finally, we will see that experimental economics has shown that factors 
such as social pressure and notions of fairness can affect consumer behavior. We will look at 
how businesses take these factors into account when setting prices. In the appendix to this 
chapter, we extend the analysis by using indifference curves and budget lines to understand 
consumer behavior.
Utility and Consumer Decision Making
We saw in Chapter 3 that the model of demand and supply is a powerful tool for analyz-
ing how prices and quantities are determined. We also saw that, according to the law of 
demand, whenever the price of a good falls, the quantity demanded increases. In this 
section, we will show how the economic model of consumer behavior leads to the law 
of demand.
The Economic Model of Consumer Behavior  
in a Nutshell
Imagine walking through a shopping mall, trying to decide how to spend your cloth-
ing budget. If you had an unlimited budget, your decision would be easy: Just buy as 
much of everything as you want. Given that you have a limited budget, what do you do? 
Economists assume that consumers act so as to make themselves as well off as possible. 
Therefore, you should choose the one combination of clothes that makes you as well off 
as possible from among those combinations that you can afford. Stated more generally, 
the economic model of consumer behavior predicts that consumers will choose to buy 
the combination of goods and services that makes them as well off as possible from 
among all the combinations that their budgets allow them to buy.
This prediction may seem obvious and not particularly useful. But as we explore the 
implication of this prediction, we will see that it leads to conclusions that are useful but 
not obvious.
Utility
How much satisfaction you receive from consuming a particular combination of goods 
and services depends on your tastes or preferences. There is an old saying—“There’s 
no accounting for tastes”—and economists don’t try to. If you buy a can of Red Bull 
energy drink instead of a can of Monster Energy, even though Monster Energy has a 
lower price, you must receive more enjoyment or satisfaction from drinking Red Bull. 
Economists refer to the enjoyment or satisfaction people receive from consuming goods 
and services as utility. So we can say that the goal of a consumer is to spend available 
income so as to maximize utility. But utility is a difficult concept to measure because 
there is no way of knowing exactly how much enjoyment or satisfaction someone re-
ceives from consuming a product. Similarly, it is not possible to compare utility across 
consumers. There is no way of knowing for sure whether Jill receives more or less satis-
faction than Jack from drinking a can of Red Bull.
Two hundred years ago, economists hoped to measure utility in units called utils. 
The util would be an objective measure in the same way that temperature is: If it is

70 degrees in New York and 70 degrees in Los Angeles, it is just as warm in both cities. 
These economists wanted to say that if Jack’s utility from drinking a can of Red Bull is 10 
utils and Jill’s utility is 5 utils, then Jack receives exactly twice the satisfaction from drink-
ing a can of Red Bull as Jill does. In fact, it is not possible to measure utility across people. 
It turns out that none of the important conclusions of the economic model of consumer 
behavior depend on utility being directly measurable (a point we demonstrate in the ap-
pendix to this chapter). Nevertheless, the economic model of consumer behavior is easier 
to understand if we assume that utility is something directly measurable, like temperature.
The Principle of Diminishing Marginal Utility
To make the model of consumer behavior more concrete, let’s see how a consumer 
makes decisions in a case involving just two products: pepperoni pizza and Coke. To 
begin, consider how the utility you receive from consuming a good changes with the 
quantity of the good you consume. For example, suppose that you have just arrived at a 
Super Bowl party, where the hosts are serving pepperoni pizza, and you are very hun-
gry. In this situation, you are likely to receive quite a lot of enjoyment, or utility, from 
consuming the first slice of pizza. Suppose this satisfaction is measurable and is equal to 
20 units of utility, or utils. After eating the first slice, you decide to have a second slice. 
Because you are no longer as hungry, the satisfaction you receive from eating the second 
slice of pizza is less than the satisfaction you received from eating the first slice. Con-
suming the second slice increases your utility by only an additional 16 utils, which raises 
your total utility from eating the 2 slices to 36 utils. If you continue eating slices, each 
additional slice gives you less and less additional satisfaction.
The table in Figure 10.1 shows the relationship between the number of slices of 
pizza you consume while watching the Super Bowl and the amount of utility you re-
ceive. The second column in the table shows the total utility you receive from eating a 
particular number of slices. The third column shows the additional utility, or marginal 
utility (MU), you receive from consuming one additional slice. (Remember that in eco-
nomics, marginal means additional.) For example, as you increase your consumption 
from 2 slices to 3 slices, your total utility increases from 36 to 46, so your marginal util-
ity from consuming the third slice is 10 utils. As the table shows, by the time you eat the 
fifth slice of pizza that evening, your marginal utility is very low: only 2 utils. If you were 
to eat a sixth slice, you would become slightly ill, and your marginal utility would actu-
ally be a negative 3 utils.
Figure 10.1 also plots the numbers from the table as graphs. Panel (a) shows how 
your total utility rises as you eat the first 5 slices of pizza and then falls as you eat the 
sixth slice. Panel (b) shows how your marginal utility declines with each additional slice 
you eat and finally becomes negative when you eat the sixth slice. The height of the mar-
ginal utility line at any quantity of pizza in panel (b) represents the change in utility as 
a result of consuming that additional slice. For example, the change in utility as a result 
of consuming 4 slices instead of 3 is 6 utils, so the height of the marginal utility line in 
panel (b) is 6 utils.
The relationship illustrated in Figure 10.1 between consuming additional units of a 
product during a period of time and the marginal utility received from consuming each 
additional unit is referred to as the law of diminishing marginal utility. For nearly 
every good or service, the more you consume during a period of time, the less you in-
crease your total satisfaction from each additional unit you consume.
The Rule of Equal Marginal Utility per Dollar Spent
The key challenge for consumers is to decide how to allocate their limited incomes 
among all the products they wish to buy. Every consumer has to make trade-offs: If 
you have $100 to spend on entertainment for the month, then the more movies you 
buy  online, the fewer movies you can see in the theater. Economists refer to the limited 
amount of income you have available to spend on goods and services as your budget 
constraint. The principle of diminishing marginal utility helps us understand how con-
sumers can best spend their limited incomes on the products available to them.
Marginal utility (MU) The change 
in total utility a person receives from 
consuming one additional unit of a 
good or service.
Law of diminishing marginal 
utility The principle that consumers 
experience diminishing additional 
satisfaction as they consume more of a 
good or service during a given period 
of time.
Budget constraint The limited 
amount of income available to 
consumers to spend on goods and 
services.

Suppose you attend a Super Bowl party at a restaurant, and you have $10 to spend 
on refreshments. Pizza is selling for $2 per slice, and Coke is selling for $1 per cup. 
Table 10.1 shows the relationship between the amount of pizza you eat, the amount of 
Coke you drink, and the amount of satisfaction, or utility, you receive. The values for 
pizza are repeated from the table in Figure 10.1. The values for Coke also follow the 
principle of diminishing marginal utility.
How many slices of pizza and how many cups of Coke do you buy if you want to 
maximize your utility? If you did not have a budget constraint, you would buy 5 slices 
of pizza and 5 cups of Coke because that would give you total utility of 107 (54 + 53), 
which is the maximum utility you can achieve. Eating another slice of pizza or drinking 
another cup of Coke during the evening would lower your utility. Unfortunately, you do 
have a budget constraint: You have only $10 to spend. To buy 5 slices of pizza (at $2 per 
slice) and 5 cups of Coke (at $1 per cup), you would need $15.

Total and Marginal Utility from 
Eating Pizza on Super Bowl 
Sunday
The table shows that for the first 5 slices of 
pizza, the more you eat, the more your total 
satisfaction, or utility, increases. If you eat 
a sixth slice, you start to feel ill from eating 
too much pizza, and your total utility falls. 
Each additional slice increases your util-
ity by less than the previous slice, so your 
marginal utility from each slice is less than 
the one before. Panel (a) shows your total 
utility rising as you eat the first 5 slices and 
falling with the sixth slice. Panel (b) shows 
your marginal utility falling with each ad-
ditional slice you eat and becoming negative 
with the sixth slice. The height of the mar-
ginal utility line at any quantity of pizza in 
panel (b) represents the change in utility as 
a result of consuming that additional slice. 
For example, the change in utility as a result 
of consuming 4 slices instead of 3 is 6 utils, 
so the height of the marginal utility line in 
panel (b) for the fourth slice is 6 utils.

 
Utility and Consumer Decision Making 
313
To select the best way to spend your $10, remember this key economic principle: 
Optimal decisions are made at the margin. That is, most of the time, economic deci-
sion makers—consumers, firms, and the government—are faced with decisions about 
whether to do a little more of one thing or a little more of an alternative. In this case, you 
are choosing to consume a little more pizza or a little more Coke. BMW chooses to man-
ufacture more hybrid cars or more SUVs in its South Carolina factory. Congress and the 
president choose to spend more for research on heart disease or more for research on 
breast cancer. Everyone faces a budget constraint, and everyone faces trade-offs.
The key to making the best consumption decision is to maximize utility by follow-
ing the rule of equal marginal utility per dollar spent. As you decide how to spend your 
income, you should buy pizza and Coke up to the point where the last slice of pizza pur-
chased and the last cup of Coke purchased give you equal increases in utility per dollar. 
By doing this, you will have maximized your total utility.
It is important to remember that to follow this rule, you must equalize your mar-
ginal utility per dollar spent, not your marginal utility from each good. Buying season 
tickets for your favorite NFL team or for the symphony or buying a BMW may give you 
a lot more satisfaction than drinking a cup of Coke, but the NFL tickets may well give 
you less satisfaction per dollar spent. To decide how many slices of pizza and how many 
cups of Coke to buy, you must convert the values for marginal utility in Table 10.1 into 
marginal utility per dollar. You can do this by dividing marginal utility by the price of 
each good, as shown in Table 10.2.
In column (3), we calculate marginal utility per dollar spent on pizza. Because the 
price of pizza is $2 per slice, the marginal utility per dollar from eating 1 slice of pizza 
equals 20 divided by $2, or 10 utils per dollar. Similarly, we show in column (6) that be-
cause the price of Coke is $1 per cup, the marginal utility per dollar from drinking 1 cup 
of Coke equals 20 divided by $1, or 20 utils per dollar. To maximize the total utility you 
receive, you must make sure that the utility per dollar of pizza for the last slice of pizza is 
equal to the utility per dollar of Coke for the last cup of Coke. Table 10.2 shows that there 
are three combinations of slices of pizza and cups of Coke where marginal utility per

dollar is equalized. Table 10.3 lists the combinations, the total amount of money needed to 
buy each combination, and the total utility received from consuming each combination.
If you buy 4 slices of pizza, the last slice gives you 3 utils per dollar. If you buy  
5 cups of Coke, the last cup also gives you 3 utils per dollar, so you have equalized your 
marginal utility per dollar. Unfortunately, as the third column in the table shows, to buy 
4 slices and 5 cups, you would need $13, and you have only $10. You could also equalize 
your marginal utility per dollar by buying 1 slice and 3 cups, but that would cost just $5, 
leaving you with $5 to spend. Only when you buy 3 slices and 4 cups have you equalized 
your marginal utility per dollar and spent neither more nor less than the $10 available.

 2. Spending on pizza + Spending on Coke = Amount available to be spent
The first condition shows that the marginal utility per dollar spent must be the same for 
both goods. The second condition is the budget constraint, which states that total spending 
on both goods must equal the amount available to be spent. Of course, these conditions for 
maximizing utility apply not just to pizza and Coke but to any two pairs of goods.

a. 
 Ed inspects this table and concludes, “Lee’s opti-
mal choice would be to consume 4 ice cream cones 
and 5 cans of Lime Fizz because with that combi-
nation, his marginal utility from ice cream cones is 
equal to his marginal utility from Lime Fizz.” Do 
you agree with Ed’s reasoning? Briefly explain.
 
b. 
 Suppose that Lee has an unlimited budget to spend 
on ice cream cones and cans of Lime Fizz. Under 
these circumstances, how many ice cream cones 
and how many cans of Lime Fizz will he consume? 
(Assume that Lee cannot consume more than 6 ice 
cream cones or 6 cans of Lime Fizz.)

Solving the Problem
Step 1: Review the chapter material. This problem involves finding the optimal 
consumption of two goods, so you may want to review the section “The Rule 
of Equal Marginal Utility per Dollar Spent,” which begins on page 311.
Step 2: Answer part a. by analyzing Ed’s reasoning. Ed’s reasoning is incorrect. To max-
imize utility, Lee needs to equalize marginal utility per dollar for the two goods.
Step 3: Answer part b. by determining how Lee would maximize utility with an 
unlimited budget. With an unlimited budget, consumers maximize utility by 
continuing to buy each good as long as their utility is increasing. In this case, 
Lee will maximize utility by buying 6 ice cream cones and 6 cans of Lime Fizz, 
given that we are assuming he can’t buy more than 6 units of either good.
Step 4: Answer part c. by determining Lee’s optimal combination of ice cream 
cones and cans of Lime Fizz. Lee will maximize his utility if he spends his $7 
per week so that the marginal utility of ice cream cones divided by the price of 
ice cream cones is equal to the marginal utility of Lime Fizz divided by the price 
of Lime Fizz. We can use the following table to solve this part of the problem:

What If the Rule of Equal Marginal Utility per Dollar 
Does Not Hold?
The idea of getting the maximum utility by equalizing the ratio of marginal utility to 
price for the goods you are buying can be difficult to grasp, so it is worth thinking about 
in another way. Suppose that instead of buying 3 slices of pizza and 4 cups of Coke, you 
buy 4 slices and 2 cups. Four slices and 2 cups cost $10, so you would meet your budget 
constraint by spending all the money available to you, but would you have gotten the 
maximum amount of utility? No, you wouldn’t have. From the information in Table 10.1 
on page 313, we can list the additional utility per dollar you are getting from the last 
slice and the last cup and the total utility from consuming 4 slices and 2 cups:
 Marginal utility per dollar for the fourth slice of pizza = 3 utils per dollar
 Marginal utility per dollar for the second cup of Coke = 15 utils per dollar
 Total utility from 4 slices of pizza and 2 cups of Coke = 87 utils
 
c. 
 Suppose that Lee has $7 per week to spend on ice 
cream cones and Lime Fizz. The price of an ice 
cream cone is $2, and the price of a can of Lime 
Fizz is $1. If Lee wants to maximize his utility, how 
many ice cream cones and how many cans of Lime 
Fizz should he buy?

buy 4 CDs and 3 DVDs. This combination provides him 
with the maximum amount of utility attainable, given his 
budget constraint.
The key point, which we also saw in Solved Prob-
lem 10.1, is that consumers maximize their utility when 
they equalize marginal utility per dollar for every good 
they buy, not when they equalize marginal utility.

Utility and Consumer Decision Making 
317
Obviously, the marginal utilities per dollar are not equal. The last cup of Coke gave 
you considerably more satisfaction per dollar than did the last slice of pizza. You could 
raise your total utility by buying less pizza and more Coke. Buying 1 less slice of pizza 
frees up $2 that will allow you to buy 2 more cups of Coke. Eating 1 less slice of pizza 
reduces your utility by 6 utils, but drinking 2 additional cups of Coke raises your utility 
by 15 utils (make sure you see this), for a net increase of 9. You end up equalizing your 
marginal utility per dollar (5 utils per dollar for both the last slice and the last cup) and 
raising your total utility from 87 utils to 96 utils.
The Income Effect and Substitution Effect  
of a Price Change
We can use the rule of equal marginal utility per dollar to analyze how consumers adjust 
their buying decisions when a price changes. Suppose you are back at the restaurant for 
the Super Bowl party, but this time the price of pizza is $1.50 per slice, rather than $2. 
You still have $10 to spend on pizza and Coke.
When the price of pizza was $2 per slice and the price of Coke was $1 per cup, your 
optimal choice was to consume 3 slices of pizza and 4 cups of Coke. The fall in the price 
of pizza to $1.50 per slice has two effects on the quantity of pizza you consume: the in-
come effect and the substitution effect. First, consider the income effect. When the price 
of a good falls, you have more purchasing power. In our example, 3 slices of pizza and  
4 cups of Coke now cost a total of only $8.50 instead of $10.00. An increase in purchasing 
power is essentially the same thing as an increase in income. The change in the quantity of 
pizza you will demand because of this increase in purchasing power— holding all other fac-
tors constant—is the income effect of the price change. Recall from Chapter 3 that if a prod-
uct is a normal good, a consumer increases the quantity demanded as the consumer’s income 
rises, but if a product is an inferior good, a consumer decreases the quantity demanded as the 
consumer’s income rises. So, if we assume that for you pizza is a normal good, the income 
effect of a fall in price causes you to consume more pizza. If pizza were an inferior good for 
you, the income effect of a fall in the price would have caused you to consume less pizza.
The second effect of the price change is the substitution effect. When the price of 
pizza falls, pizza becomes cheaper relative to Coke, and the marginal utility per dollar 
for each slice of pizza you consume increases. If we hold constant the effect of the price 
change on your purchasing power and just focus on the effect of the price being lower 
relative to the price of the other good, we have isolated the substitution effect of the 
price change. The lower price of pizza relative to the price of Coke has lowered the op-
portunity cost to you of consuming pizza because now you have to give up less Coke to 
consume the same quantity of pizza. Therefore, the substitution effect from the fall in 
the price of pizza relative to the price of Coke causes you to eat more pizza and drink 
less Coke. In this case, both the income effect and the substitution effect of the fall in 
price cause you to eat more pizza. If the price of pizza had risen, both the income effect 
and the substitution effect would have caused you to eat less pizza. Table 10.4 summa-
rizes the effect of a price change on the quantity demanded.
We can use Table 10.5 to determine the effect of the fall in the price of pizza on 
your optimal consumption. Table 10.5 has the same information as Table 10.2, with one 
Income effect The change in the 
quantity demanded of a good that 
results from the effect of a change in 
price on consumer purchasing power, 
holding all other factors constant.
Substitution effect The change in 
the quantity demanded of a good that 
results from a change in price making 
the good more or less expensive 
relative to other goods, holding 
constant the effect of the price change 
on consumer purchasing power.

change: The marginal utility per dollar from eating pizza has been changed to reflect 
the new lower price of $1.50 per slice. Examining the table, we can see that the fall in 
the price of pizza will result in your eating 1 more slice of pizza, so your optimal con-
sumption now becomes 4 slices of pizza and 4 cups of Coke. You will be spending all of 
your $10, and the last dollar you spend on pizza will provide you with about the same 
marginal utility per dollar as the last dollar you spend on Coke. You will not be receiv-
ing exactly the same marginal utility per dollar spent on the two products. As Table 10.5 
shows, the last slice of pizza gives you 4 utils per dollar, and the last cup of Coke gives 
you 5 utils per dollar. But this is as close as you can come to equalizing marginal utility 
per dollar for the two products, unless you can buy a fraction of a slice of pizza or a frac-
tion of a cup of Coke.
Where Demand Curves Come From
We saw in Chapter 3 that, according to the law of demand, whenever the price of a prod-
uct falls, the quantity demanded increases. Now that we have covered the concepts of 
total utility, marginal utility, and the budget constraint, we can look more closely at why 
the law of demand holds.
In our example of optimal consumption of pizza and Coke at the Super Bowl party, 
we found the following:
 Price of pizza = +2 per slice 1 Quantity of pizza demanded = 3 slices
 Price of pizza = +1.50 per slice 1 Quantity of pizza demanded = 4 slices
In panel (a) of Figure 10.2, we plot the two points showing the optimal number of 
pizza slices you choose to consume at each price. In panel (b) of Figure 10.2, we draw 
a line connecting the two points. This downward-sloping line represents your demand 
curve for pizza. We could find more points on the line by changing the price of pizza 
and using the information in Table 10.2 to find the new optimal number of slices of 
pizza you would demand at each price.
To this point in this chapter, we have been looking at an individual demand curve. 
As we saw in Chapter 3, however, economists are typically interested in market de-
mand curves. We can construct the market demand curve from the individual demand 
curves for all the consumers in the market. To keep things simple, let’s assume that there 
are only three consumers in the market for pizza: you, David, and Lori. The table in 
 Figure 10.3 shows the individual demand schedules for the three consumers. Because 
consumers differ in their incomes and their preferences for products, we would not ex-
pect every consumer to demand the same quantity of a given product at each price. 
The final column gives the market demand, which is simply the sum of the quanti-
ties demanded by each of the three consumers at each price. For example, at a price 
of $1.50 per slice, your quantity demanded is 4 slices, David’s quantity demanded is

A consumer responds optimally to a fall in the price of a product by consuming 
more of that product. In panel (a), the price of pizza falls from $2 per slice to 
$1.50, and the optimal quantity of slices consumed rises from 3 to 4. When we

The table shows that the total quantity demanded in a market is the sum of the quan-
tities demanded by each buyer. We can find the market demand curve by adding 
horizontally the individual demand curves in panels (a), (b), and (c). For instance, 
at a price of $1.50, your quantity demanded is 4 slices, David’s quantity demanded is  
6 slices, and Lori’s quantity demanded is 5 slices. Therefore, panel (d) shows that a 
price of $1.50 and a quantity demanded of 15 is a point on the market demand curve.

C H A P T E R  1 0  Consumer Choice and Behavioral Economics
6 slices, and Lori’s quantity demanded is 5 slices. So, at a price of $1.50, a quantity of  
15 slices is demanded in the market. The graphs in the figure show that we can obtain 
the market demand curve by adding horizontally the individual demand curves.
Remember that according to the law of demand, market demand curves always 
slope downward. We now know that this is true because the income and substitution 
effects of a fall in price cause consumers to increase the quantity of the good they de-
mand. There is a complicating factor, however. As we discussed earlier, only for normal 
goods will the income effect result in consumers increasing the quantity of the good 
they demand when the price falls. If the good is an inferior good, the income effect leads 
consumers to decrease the quantity of the good they demand. The substitution effect, on 
the other hand, results in consumers increasing the quantity they demand of both nor-
mal and inferior goods when the price falls. So, when the price of an inferior good falls, 
the income effect and substitution effect work in opposite directions: The income effect 
causes consumers to decrease the quantity of the good they demand, whereas the sub-
stitution effect causes consumers to increase the quantity of the good they demand. Is it 
possible, then, that consumers might actually buy less of a good when the price falls? If 
this happened, the demand curve would be upward sloping.
Are There Any Upward-Sloping 
Demand Curves in the Real World?
For a demand curve to be upward sloping, the good would 
have to be an inferior good and the income effect would have 
to be larger than the substitution effect. Economists have understood the conditions for 
an upward-sloping demand curve since the possibility was first discussed by the Brit-
ish economist Alfred Marshall in the 1890s. Marshall wrote that his friend, Sir Robert 
Giffen, had told him that when the price of bread rose, very poor people in British cities 
would actually buy more bread rather than less. Since that time, goods with upward-
sloping demand curves have been referred to as Giffen goods.
For more than a century, finding an actual Giffen good proved impossible. A close 
examination of the data showed that Giffen had been mistaken and that poor people in 
British cities bought less bread when prices rose, so their demand curves were down-
ward sloping. Other possible candidates for being Giffen goods were also found to actu-
ally have downward-sloping demand curves. Finally, in 2006, Robert Jensen of Brown 
University and Nolan Miller of Harvard discovered two Giffen goods. Jensen and Miller 
reasoned that to be a Giffen good, with an income effect larger than its substitution ef-
fect, a good must be inferior and make up a very large portion of consumers’ budgets. 
Jensen and Miller knew that very poor people in the Hunan region of China spent most 
of their incomes on rice, while in the Gansu province, very poor people spent most of 
their income on wheat-based foods, such as buns and noodles. In both places, poor 
people ate meat when their incomes allowed it because they preferred the taste of meat 
even though it did not supply as many calories as the rice or wheat they could purchase 
for the same price.
Jensen and Miller carried out the following experiment: In Hunan, for a five-
month period they gave a selected number of poor families coupons that would allow 
them to buy rice at a lower price. Families could not use the coupons for any other 
purpose. In Gansu, Jensen and Miller gave a selected number of poor families coupons 
to buy wheat at a lower price. Jensen and Miller then observed the purchases of the 
families during the time they received the coupons and during the period immedi-
ately thereafter. In Hunan, during the months they received the coupons, the families 
bought less rice and more meat, and in Gansu, they bought less wheat and more meat. 
Because in Hunan families bought less rice when the price was lower, their demand 
curves for rice were upward sloping. Similarly, in Gansu, families bought less wheat 
when the price was lower, so their demand curves for wheat were upward sloping. Af-
ter more than a century of searching, economists had finally discovered examples of a 
Giffen good.
Making  
the 
Connection
Rice is a Giffen good in poor parts 
of China.

 
Social Influences on Decision Making 
321
Social Influences on Decision Making
Sociologists and anthropologists have argued that social factors such as culture, cus-
toms, and religion are very important in explaining the choices consumers make. Econ-
omists have traditionally seen such factors as being relatively unimportant, if they take 
them into consideration at all. Recently, however, some economists have begun to study 
how social factors influence consumer choice.
For example, people seem to receive more utility from consuming goods they be-
lieve are popular. As the economists Gary Becker and Kevin Murphy put it:
The utility from drugs, crime, going bowling, owning a Rolex watch, voting Demo-
cratic, dressing informally at work, or keeping a neat lawn depends on whether 
friends and neighbors take drugs, commit crimes, go bowling, own Rolex watches, 
vote Democratic, dress informally, or keep their lawns neat.
This reasoning can help to explain why one restaurant is packed, while an-
other restaurant that serves essentially the same food and has similar décor has many 
fewer customers. Consumers decide which restaurant to go to partly on the basis of 
food and décor but also on the basis of the restaurant’s popularity. People receive util-
ity from being seen eating at a popular restaurant because they believe it makes them 
appear knowledgeable and fashionable. Whenever consumption takes place publicly, 
many consumers base their purchasing decisions on what other consumers are buying.  
Examples of public consumption include eating in restaurants, attending sporting 
events, wearing clothes or jewelry, and driving cars. In all these cases, the decision to 
buy a product depends partly on the characteristics of the product and partly on how 
many other people are buying the product.
The Effects of Celebrity Endorsements
In many cases, it is not just the number of people who use a product that makes it desir-
able but the types of people who use it. If consumers believe that media stars or profes-
sional athletes use a product, demand for the product will often increase. This may be 
partly because consumers believe public figures are particularly knowledgeable about 
products: “Justin Bieber probably knows more about cell phones and other electronics 
than I do, so I’ll buy these products at Best Buy because he does.” But many consumers 
also feel more fashionable and closer to famous people if they use the same products. 
These considerations help to explain why companies such as Best Buy are willing to pay 
millions of dollars to have celebrities endorse their products. Some companies, such as 
Coca-Cola, have been using celebrities in their advertising for decades.

Why Do Firms Pay Tom Brady  
to Endorse Their Products?
Tom Brady is one of the biggest stars in the National Football 
League (NFL). As the quarterback of the New England Patri-
ots, he led his team to three Super Bowl championships between 2001 and 2010 and 
was twice named the Most Valuable Player in the NFL. Judging by television ratings and

Network Externalities
Technology can play a role in explaining why consumers buy products that many other 
consumers are already buying. There is a network externality in the consumption of a 
product if the usefulness of the product increases with the number of consumers who 
use it. For example, if you owned the only phone in the world, it would not be very 
useful. The usefulness of phones increases as the number of people who own them in-
creases. Similarly, your willingness to buy an Apple iPad depends in part on the number 
of other people who own iPads. The more people who own iPads, the more applications, 
or apps, other firms will produce for the iPad, and the more novels, textbooks, newspa-
pers, and magazines publishers will make available for downloading to the iPad, and, 
therefore, the more useful an iPad is to you.
Some economists have suggested the possibility that network externalities may have 
a significant downside because they might result in consumers buying products that 
contain inferior technologies. This outcome could occur because network externali-
ties can create significant switching costs related to changing products: When a product 
 becomes established, consumers may find it too costly to switch to a new product that 
contains a better technology. The selection of products may be path dependent. This 
means that because of switching costs, the technology that was first available may have 
advantages over better technologies that were developed later. In other words, the path 
along which the economy has developed in the past is important.
One example of path dependence and the use of an inferior technology is the 
QWERTY order of the letters along the top row of most computer keyboards. This or-
der became widely used when manual typewriters were developed in the late nineteenth 
century. The metal keys on manual typewriters would stick together if a user typed too 
fast, and the QWERTY keyboard was designed to slow down typists and minimize the 
problem of the keys sticking together. With computers, the problem that QWERTY was 
developed to solve no longer exists, so keyboards could be changed to have letters in a 
more efficient layout. But because the overwhelming majority of people have learned 
to use keyboards with the QWERTY layout, there might be significant costs to them if 
they had to switch, even if a new layout ultimately made them faster typists.
Other products that supposedly embodied inferior technologies are VHS video re-
corders—supposedly inferior to Sony Betamax recorders—and the Windows computer 
operating system—supposedly inferior to the Macintosh operating system. Some econo-
mists have argued that because of path dependence and switching costs, network exter-
nalities can result in market failures. As we saw in Chapter 5, a market failure is a situation 
in which the market fails to produce the efficient level of output. If network externali-
ties result in market failure, government intervention in these markets might improve 
economic efficiency. Many economists are skeptical, however, that network externali-
ties really do lead to consumers being locked into products with inferior technologies.

UGG boots for men, and Audi automobiles. Under Armour was so eager to have him 
endorse their sportswear that they gave him part ownership of the company in exchange 
for his endorsement. Brady makes at least $4 million per year from his endorsements.
Tom Brady is a great football player, but should consumers care what products he 
uses? There seems little doubt that consumers care what products Brady uses, but why 
do they care? It might be that they believe Brady has better information than they do 
about the products he endorses. The average football fan might believe that if Brady 
endorses Under Armour sportswear, maybe Under Armour makes better sportswear. 
But it seems more likely that people buy products associated with Tom Brady or other 
celebrities because using these products makes them feel closer to the celebrity endorser 
or because it makes them appear to be fashionable.

In particular, economists Stan Leibowitz of the University of Texas, Dallas and Stephen 
Margolis of North Carolina State University have argued that, in practice, the gains from 
using a superior technology are larger than the losses due to switching costs. After care-
fully studying the cases of the QWERTY keyboard, VHS video recorders, and the Win-
dows computer operating system, they have concluded that there is no good evidence 
that the alternative technologies were actually superior. The implications of network ex-
ternalities for economic efficiency remain controversial among economists.
Does Fairness Matter?
If people were only interested in making themselves as well off as possible in a mate-
rial sense, they would not be concerned with fairness. There is a great deal of evidence, 
however, that people like to be treated fairly and that they usually attempt to treat others 
fairly, even if doing so makes them worse off financially. Tipping servers in restaurants 
is an example. In the United States, diners in restaurants typically add 15 to 20 percent 
to their food bills as tips to their servers. Tips are not required, but most people see it 
as very unfair not to tip, unless the service has been exceptionally bad. You could argue 
that people leave tips not to be fair but because they are afraid that if they don’t leave a 
tip, the next time they visit the restaurant they will receive poor service. Studies have 
shown, however, that most people leave tips at restaurants even while on vacation or in 
other circumstances where they are unlikely to visit the restaurant again.
There are many other examples where people willingly part with money when they 
are not required to do so and when they receive nothing material in return. The most 
obvious example is making donations to charity. Apparently, donating money to char-
ity or leaving tips in restaurants that they will never visit again gives people more utility 
than they would receive from keeping the money and spending it on themselves.
A Test of Fairness in the Economic Laboratory: The Ultimatum Game 
Experiment Economists have used experiments to increase their understanding of the 
role that fairness plays in consumer decision making. Experimental economics has been 
widely used during the past two decades, and a number of experimental economics labo-
ratories exist in the United States and Europe. Economists Maurice Allais, Reinhard Selten, 
and Vernon Smith were awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics in part because of their 
contributions to experimental economics. Experiments make it possible to focus on a sin-
gle aspect of consumer behavior. The ultimatum game, first popularized by Werner Güth of 
the Max Planck Institute of Economics, is an experiment that tests whether fairness is im-
portant in consumer decision making. Various economists have conducted the ultimatum 
game experiment under slightly different conditions, but with generally the same result. 
In this game, a group of volunteers—often college students—are divided into pairs. One 
member of each pair is the “allocator,” and the other member of the pair is the “recipient.”
Each pair is given an amount of money, say $20. The allocator decides how much of 
the $20 each member of the pair will get. There are no restrictions on how the allocator 
divides up the money. He or she could keep it all, give it all to the recipient, or anything 
in between. The recipient must then decide whether to accept the allocation or reject it. 
If the recipient decides to accept the allocation, each member of the pair gets to keep his 
or her share. If the recipient decides to reject the allocation, both members of the pair 
receive nothing.
If neither the allocator nor the recipient cares about fairness, optimal play in the ul-
timatum game is straightforward: The allocator should propose a division of the money 
in which the allocator receives $19.99 and the recipient receives $0.01. The allocator has 
maximized his or her gain. The recipient should accept the division because the alterna-
tive is to reject the division and receive nothing at all: Even a penny is better than nothing.
In fact, when the ultimatum game experiment is carried out, both allocators and 
recipients act as if fairness is important. Allocators usually offer recipients at least a  
40 percent share of the money, and recipients almost always reject offers of less than a  
10 percent share. Why do allocators offer recipients more than a negligible amount? It 
might be that allocators do not care about fairness but fear that recipients do care and will 

324 
C H A P T E R  1 0  Consumer Choice and Behavioral Economics
reject offers they consider unfair. This possibility was tested in an experiment known as 
the dictator game carried out by Daniel Kahneman (a psychologist who shared the Nobel 
Prize in Economics), Jack Knetsch, and Richard Thaler, using students at Cornell Uni-
versity. In this experiment, the allocators were given only two possible divisions of $20: 
either $18 for themselves and $2 for the recipient or an even division of $10 for them-
selves and $10 for the recipient. One important difference from the ultimatum game was 
that the recipient was not allowed to reject the division. Of the 161 allocators, 122 chose 
the even division of the $20. Because there was no possibility of the $18/$2 split being 
rejected, the allocators must have chosen the even split because they valued acting fairly.
Why would recipients in the ultimatum game ever reject any division of the money in 
which they receive even a very small amount, given that even a small amount of money is bet-
ter than nothing? Apparently, most people value fairness enough that they will refuse to par-
ticipate in transactions they consider unfair, even if they are worse off financially as a result.
Are the Results of Economic Experiments Reliable? Because economists have 
conducted the ultimatum game and the dictator game many times in different countries 
using different groups of people, most economists believe that the results of the game 
provide strong evidence that people value fairness. Recently, however, some econo-
mists have begun to question this conclusion. To begin with, the experimental situation 
is artificial, so results obtained from experiments may not hold up in the real world. 
 Although allocators in the dictatorship game give money to the other player, whose 
identity is not known to the allocator, in the real world people rarely just hand money 
to strangers. So, it is possible that the fairness observed in the experiments may be the 
result of people wanting to avoid appearing selfish rather than people valuing fairness. 
For instance, in the ultimatum game, anyone who kept $19.99 and gave the other person 
only $0.01 might be afraid of appearing selfish in the eyes of the economist conducting 
the experiment. Particularly because the dollar amounts involved in the experiment are 
small, wanting to please the person conducting the experiment may be the main motive 
behind the choices made.
John List of the University of Chicago has carried out variations of the dictator 
game. When he gave every player $5 and followed the usual procedure of having half the 
players act as dictators in dividing up the $5, he found the usual result, with 71 percent 
of dictators allocating some money to the other player. But when he gave the dictator 
the choice of either giving money to the other player or taking up to $5 from the other 
player, only 10 percent of dictators gave the other player any money, and more than half 
the dictators took money from the other player. When List asked players to work for  
30 minutes at a simple task to earn the $5 before playing the game, two-thirds of the 
dictators neither gave anything nor took anything from the other player. This last result 
may indicate that the source of the money being allocated matters.
List’s results do not completely reverse the usual interpretation of the results of the 
ultimatum and dictator games. They do show, however, that the results of those games 
are not as clear-cut as many economists had thought. They also show that the details of 
an economic experiment can have a significant effect on its results.
Business Implications of Fairness If consumers value fairness, how does this af-
fect firms? One consequence is that firms will sometimes not raise prices of goods and 
services, even when there is a large increase in demand, because they are afraid their 
customers will consider the price increases unfair and may buy elsewhere.
Consider several examples where it seems that businesses could increase their prof-
its by raising prices. In April 2011, the dance rock band LCD played a concert at New 
York’s Madison Square Garden. The tickets were priced at $50 each. Demand for the 
tickets was so large, however, that tickets sold online for as much as $2,500 each. Why 
didn’t the band, or the concert promoter, charge more than $50 for the tickets? Each 
year, many more people would like to buy tickets to see the Super Bowl than there are 
tickets for them to buy at the price the National Football League charges. Why doesn’t 
the National Football League raise prices? The restaurant Next opened in Chicago in 
2011. Rather than use normal pricing, the restaurant sold tickets that entitled the buyer 
to a dinner, including drinks and tip. The restaurant sold the tickets for $45 to $75, 

 
Social Influences on Decision Making 
325
depending on the dinner chosen. The tickets were resold online for prices from $500 to 
$3,000. Why didn’t Next increase its ticket prices?
In each of these cases, it appears that a firm could increase its profits by raising 
prices. The seller would be selling the same quantity—of seats at a concert or in a foot-
ball stadium or meals in a restaurant—at a higher price, so profits should increase. 
Economists have provided two explanations for why firms sometimes do not raise 
prices in these situations. Gary Becker, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Econom-
ics, has suggested that the products involved—concerts, football games, or restaurant 
meals—are all products that buyers consume together with other buyers. In those situ-
ations, the amount consumers wish to buy may be related to how much of the product 
other people are consuming. People like to consume, and be seen consuming, a popular 
product. If rock bands, the NFL, and popular restaurants increased their prices enough 
to equate the quantity of tickets demanded with the quantity supplied, they might find 
that they had also eliminated their popularity.
Daniel Kahneman, Jack Knetsch, and Richard Thaler have offered another explana-
tion for why firms don’t always raise prices when doing so would seem to increase their 
profits. In surveys of consumers, these researchers found that most people considered it 
fair for firms to raise their prices following an increase in costs but unfair to raise prices 
following an increase in demand. For example, Kahneman, Knetsch, and Thaler con-
ducted a survey in which people were asked their opinion of the following situation: “A 
hardware store has been selling snow shovels for $15. The morning after a large snow-
storm, the store raises the price to $20.” Eighty-two percent of those surveyed responded 
that they considered the hardware store’s actions to be unfair. Kahneman, Knetsch, and 
Thaler have concluded that firms may sometimes not raise their prices even when the 
quantity demanded of their product is greater than the quantity supplied out of fear that 
in the long run, they will lose customers who believe the price increases were unfair.
In analyzing the pricing of Super Bowl tickets, economist Alan Krueger of Princeton 
University provided some support for Kahneman, Knetsch, and Thaler’s explanation of 
why companies do not always raise prices when the quantity demanded is greater than the 
quantity supplied. In 2011, the NFL charged $1,200 for the best seats and $600 for most 
of the rest. Many of these tickets were resold online for as much as $5,000 each. Krueger 
decided to survey football fans attending the Super Bowl to see if their views could help 
explain why the NFL didn’t charge higher prices for the tickets. When asked whether it 
would “be fair for the NFL to raise the [price of tickets] to $1,500 if that is still less than 
the amount most people are willing to pay for tickets,” 92 percent of the fans surveyed an-
swered “no.” Even 83 percent of the fans who had paid more than $1,500 for their tickets 
answered “no.” Krueger concluded that whatever the NFL might gain in the short run from 
raising ticket prices, it would more than lose in the long run by alienating football fans.
These explanations for why firms don’t always raise prices to a level that would 
equate the quantity demanded with the quantity supplied share the same basic idea: 
Sometimes firms will give up some profits in the short run to keep their customers 
happy and increase their profits in the long run.
What’s Up with “Fuel Surcharges”?
Ordinarily, when firms present their customers with a bill, 
they don’t itemize the costs of producing the good or service: 
Restaurants don’t list on their menus the costs of the lettuce 
and tomatoes in a salad, and automobile companies don’t list 
on their window price stickers the prices they paid their suppliers for the transmission 
or the tires. As oil prices began to rise in 2008, however, a number of companies began 
adding a line for “fuel surcharge” to their bills. For instance, Waste Management, the 
largest waste removal firm in the United States, includes a line for a fuel surcharge on its 
bills even though it doesn’t itemize any other costs. The same is true for FedEx and UPS. 
Most major airlines do so as well. For example, in mid-2011, every airline flight from 
New York to London included a fuel surcharge of $362.
An article in the Wall Street Journal noted that although airlines had raised the fuel 
surcharge four times during the first half of 2011, they failed to cut the surcharge as oil 
Making

prices dropped by 20 percent between April and August. The mystery of why the price 
of airline tickets didn’t fall as oil prices fell can be solved by considering why the airlines 
started itemizing a fuel surcharge to begin with. As the research of Daniel Kahneman, 
Jack Knetsch, and Richard Thaler has shown, consumers see it as fair for firms to raise 
prices after an increase in costs. By explicitly including a fuel surcharge in their prices, 
the airlines—and other firms that followed this practice—were able to increase prices 
without consumers seeing the increases as being unfair.
We know from Chapter 3, though, that the prices of airline tickets and other 
goods and services are determined by the interaction of demand and supply. The 
decline in oil prices reduced the airlines’ costs, thereby shifting the supply curve for 
airline tickets to the right. As the U.S. economy continued to recover from the re-
cession of 2007–2009, the demand for airline tickets increased during the summer 
of 2011, shifting the demand curve to the right. As a result, the price of most air-
line tickets did not decline as oil prices declined. The figure below illustrates this 
point by showing the price of tickets remaining at P1 despite the shifts in the de-
mand and supply curves. In fact, on some airline routes, ticket prices actually  
increased slightly during these months.

Prices are determined by all of the factors that affect demand and supply. Airlines 
and other firms began singling out fuel costs in their prices only because they knew that 
doing so would make consumers believe that the price increases were fair.

that consumers and firms are taking actions that are appropriate to reach their goals, 
given the information available to them. In recent years, some economists have begun

Behavioral Economics: Do People Make Their Choices Rationally? 
327
studying situations in which people do not appear to be making choices that are eco-
nomically rational. This new area of economics is called behavioral economics. Why 
might consumers or businesses not act rationally? The most obvious reason would be 
that they do not realize that their actions are inconsistent with their goals. As we dis-
cussed in Chapter 1, one of the objectives of economics is to suggest ways to make better 
decisions. In this section, we discuss ways in which consumers can improve their deci-
sions by avoiding some common pitfalls.
Consumers commonly commit the following three mistakes when making decisions:
 1. They take into account monetary costs but ignore nonmonetary opportunity costs.
 2. They fail to ignore sunk costs.
 3. They are unrealistic about their future behavior.
Ignoring Nonmonetary Opportunity Costs
Remember from Chapter 2 that the opportunity cost of any activity is the highest- 
valued alternative that must be given up to engage in that activity. For example, if you 
own something you could sell, using it yourself involves an opportunity cost. It is often 
difficult for people to think of opportunity costs in these terms.
Consider the following example: Some of the fans at the Super Bowl participated in a 
lottery run by the National Football League that allowed the winners to purchase tickets 
at their face value, which was either $325 or $400, depending on where in the stadium the 
seats were located. Alan Krueger surveyed the lottery winners, asking them two questions:
Question 1: If you had not won the lottery, would you have been willing to pay $3,000 
for your ticket?
Question 2: If after winning your ticket (and before arriving in Florida for the Super 
Bowl) someone had offered you $3,000 for your ticket, would you have sold it?
In answer to the first question, 94 percent said that if they had not won the lottery, 
they would not have paid $3,000 for a ticket. In answer to the second question, 92 per-
cent said they would not have sold their ticket for $3,000. But these answers are contra-
dictory! If someone offers you $3,000 for your ticket, then by using the ticket rather than 
selling it, you incur an opportunity cost of $3,000. There really is a $3,000 cost involved 
in using that ticket, even though you do not pay $3,000 in cash. The two  alternatives—
either paying $3,000 or not receiving $3,000—amount to exactly the same thing.
If the ticket is really not worth $3,000 to you, you should sell it. If it is worth $3,000 
to you, you should be willing to pay $3,000 in cash to buy it. Not being willing to sell 
a ticket you already own for $3,000 while at the same time not being willing to buy a 
ticket for $3,000 if you didn’t already own one is inconsistent behavior. The inconsis-
tency comes from a failure to take into account nonmonetary opportunity costs. Behav-
ioral economists believe this inconsistency is caused by the endowment effect, which is 
the tendency of people to be unwilling to sell a good they already own even if they are 
offered a price that is greater than the price they would be willing to pay to buy the good 
if they didn’t already own it.
The failure to take into account opportunity costs is a very common error in decision 
making. Suppose, for example, that a friend is in a hurry to have his room cleaned—it’s 
the Friday before parents’ weekend—and he offers you $50 to do it for him. You turn him 
down and spend the time cleaning your own room, even though you know somebody 
down the hall who would be willing to clean your room for $20. Leave aside complicat-
ing details—the guy who asked you to clean his room is a real slob, or you don’t want 
the person who offered to clean your room for $20 to go through your stuff—and you 
should see the point we are making. The opportunity cost of cleaning your own room is 
$50—the amount your friend offered to pay you to clean his room. It is inconsistent to 
turn down an offer from someone else to clean your room for $20 when you are doing 
it for yourself at a cost of $50. The key point here is this: Nonmonetary opportunity costs 
are just as real as monetary costs and should be taken into account when making decisions.
There are many examples of businesses taking advantage of the tendency of con-
sumers to ignore nonmonetary costs. For example, some firms sell products with mail-
in rebates. Rather than have a mail-in rebate of $10, why not just cut the price by $10?

Companies are relying on the fact that not mailing in a rebate form once you have  
already paid for a product is a nonmonetary opportunity cost rather than a direct mon-
etary cost. In fact, only a small percentage of customers actually mail in rebates.
Failing to Ignore Sunk Costs
A sunk cost is a cost that has already been paid and cannot be recovered. Once you have 
paid money and can’t get it back, you should ignore that money in any later decisions 
you make. Consider the following two situations:
Situation 1: You bought a ticket to a play for $75. The ticket is nonrefundable and must be 
used on Tuesday night, which is the only night the play will be performed. On Monday, 
a friend calls and invites you to a local comedy club to see a comedian you both like who 
is appearing only on Tuesday night. Your friend offers to pay the cost of going to the club.
Situation 2: It’s Monday night, and you are about to buy a ticket for the Tuesday night 
performance of the same play as in situation 1. As you are leaving to buy the ticket, your 
friend calls and invites you to the comedy club.
Would your decision to go to the play or to the comedy club be different in situa-
tion 1 than in situation 2? Most people would say that in situation 1, they would go to 
the play, because otherwise they would lose the $75 they had paid for the ticket. In fact, 
though, the $75 is “lost” no matter what you do because the ticket is not refundable. The 
only real issue for you to decide is whether you would prefer to see the play or prefer 
to go with your friend to the comedy club. If you would prefer to go to the club, the 
fact that you have already paid $75 for the ticket to the play is irrelevant. Your decision 
should be the same in situation 1 as in situation 2.
Psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky explored the tendency of con-
sumers to not ignore sunk costs by asking two samples of people the following questions:
Question 1: One sample of people was asked: “Imagine that you have decided to see a 
play and have paid the admission price of $10 per ticket. As you enter the theater, you 
discover that you have lost the ticket. The seat was not marked, and the ticket cannot be 
recovered. Would you pay $10 for another ticket?” Of those asked, 46 percent answered 
“yes,” and 54 percent answered “no.”
Question 2: A different sample of people was asked: “Imagine that you have decided to 
see a play where admission is $10 per ticket. As you enter the theater, you discover that 
you have lost a $10 bill. Would you still pay $10 for a ticket to the play?” Of those asked, 
88 percent answered “yes,” and 12 percent answered “no.”
The situations presented in the two questions are actually the same and should have 
received the same fraction of yes and no responses. Many people, though, have trouble 
seeing that in question 1, when deciding whether to see the play, they should ignore the 
$10 already paid for a ticket because it is a sunk cost.

been paid and cannot be recovered.

the Importance of Ignoring  
Sunk Costs
In recent years, many people have started blogs—or, “Web 
logs”—where they record their thoughts on politics, sports, their favorite hobbies, or 
anything else that interests them. Some bloggers can spend hours a day writing up their 
latest ideas and providing links to relevant material on the Web. A few blogs become so 
successful that they attract paid advertising and earn their owners a good income. Ar-
nold Kim began blogging about Apple products in 2000, during his fourth year of medi-
cal school. He continued blogging on his site, MacRumors.com, over the next eight years, 
while pursuing a medical career as a nephrologist—a doctor who treats kidney problems.
By 2008, Kim’s site had become very successful, attracting 4.4 million people and 
more than 40 million page views each month. Kim was earning more than $100,000 
per year from paid advertising by companies such as Verizon, Audible.com, and CDW.

Being Unrealistic about Future Behavior
Studies have shown that a majority of adults in the United States are overweight. Why 
do many people choose to eat too much? One possibility is that they receive more util-
ity from eating too much than they would from being thin. A more likely explanation, 
however, is that many people eat a lot today because they expect to eat less tomorrow. 
But they never do eat less, and so they end up overweight. (Of course, some people also 
suffer from medical problems that lead to weight gain.) Similarly, some people continue 
smoking today because they expect to be able to give it up sometime in the future. Un-
fortunately, for many people that time never comes, and they suffer the health conse-
quences of prolonged smoking. In both these cases, people are overvaluing the utility 
from current choices—eating chocolate cake or smoking—and undervaluing the utility 
to be received in the future from being thin or not getting lung cancer.
Economists who have studied this question argue that many people have prefer-
ences that are not consistent over time. In the long run, you would like to be thin or 
give up smoking or achieve some other goal, but each day, you make decisions (such as 
to eat too much or to smoke) that are not consistent with this long-run goal. If you are 
unrealistic about your future behavior, you underestimate the costs of choices—such as 
overeating or smoking—that you make today. A key way of avoiding this problem is to 
be realistic about your future behavior.
But the tasks of compiling rumors about new Apple products, keeping an Apple buying 
guide up to date, and monitoring multiple discussion boards on the site became more than 
he could handle as a part-time job. Kim enjoyed working on the Web site and believed 
that ultimately it could earn him more than he was earning as a doctor. Still, he hesitated 
to abandon his medical career because he had invested nearly $200,000 in his education.
But the $200,000, as well as the years he had spent in medical school, completing a 
residency in internal medicine, and completing a fellowship in nephrology, were sunk 
costs. Kim realized that he needed to ignore these sunk costs in order to make a rational 
decision about whether to continue in medicine or to become a full-time blogger. After 
calculating that he would make more from his Web site than from his medical career—
and taking into account that by working from home he could spend more time with his 
young daughter—he decided to blog full time. He was quoted as saying, “on paper it 
was an easy decision.” By mid-2011, MacRumors.com was being viewed by more than  
9  million people per month, and Kim’s income had risen above what he would have 
made as a doctor.
Knowing that it is rational to ignore sunk costs can be important in making key 
decisions in life.

Why Don’t Students Study More?
Government statistics show that students who do well in college 
earn at least $10,000 more per year than students who fail to 
graduate or who graduate with low grades. So, over the course 
of a career of 40 years or more, students who do well in college 
will have earned upward of $400,000 more than students who failed to graduate or who re-
ceived low grades. Most colleges advise that students study at least two hours outside class 
for every hour they spend in class. Surveys show that students often ignore this advice.
If the opportunity cost of not studying is so high, why do many students choose to study 
relatively little? Some students have work or family commitments that limit the amount of

Solved Problem 10.4
How Do You Get People to Save More  
of Their Income?
Under 401(k) retirement plans, firms can send some of a 
worker’s pay to a mutual fund or other investment, where 
its returns will accumulate tax free until the worker retires. 
Partly because of research by behavioral economists into 
what determines people’s saving behavior, Congress in-
cluded in the Pension Protection Act of 2006 a provision 
that made it easier for companies to automatically enroll 
employees in a 401(k) plan. As a result, participation rates 
in 401(k) plans at large companies increased from 67 per-
cent to 85 percent.
 
a. 
 Why would more people participate in a retirement 
plan when they are automatically enrolled than 
when they have to fill out a form to enroll?
 
b.  One unintended consequence of the change in the 
law was a decline in the saving rate among employ-
ees in 401(k) plans. Most plans automatically en-
rolled employees at a saving rate of 3 percent of their 
salary. One study indicated, though, that 40 percent 
of employees would have enrolled at a higher saving 
rate if they hadn’t been automatically enrolled at the 
3 percent rate. Why wouldn’t employees enrolled at 
the 3 percent rate who wanted to save at a higher rate 
simply tell their employers that they wanted to save 
at a higher rate (which is easy to do under the plans)?

Journal, July 7, 2011.

time they can study. But many other students study less than they would if they were more 
realistic about their future behavior. On any given night, a student has to choose between 
studying and other activities—such as watching television, going to a movie, or going to a 
party—that may seem to provide higher utility in the short run. Many students choose one 
of these activities over studying because they expect to study tomorrow or the next day, but 
tomorrow they face the same choices and make similar decisions. As a result, they do not 
study enough to meet their long-run goal of graduating with high grades. If they were more 
realistic about their future behavior, they would not make the mistake of overvaluing the 
utility from activities such as watching television or partying because they would realize 
that those activities can endanger their long-run goal of graduating with honors.
Your Turn: Test your understanding by doing related problems 4.10 and 4.11 on page 338 at the 
end of this chapter.
Solving the Problem
Step 1: Review the chapter material. This problem is about people not always being 
realistic about their future behavior, so you may want to review the section 
“Being Unrealistic about Future Behavior,” which begins on page 329.
Step 2: Use your understanding of consumer decision making to answer part a. 
Some people appear to have acted irrationally by not taking the minor action of 
filling out a form to enroll in a retirement plan when they would voluntarily stay 
in the plan if automatically enrolled. Here is one possible explanation for this 
puzzle that is consistent with what we have seen about many people being un-
realistic about their future behavior: Some people spend money today that they 
should be saving for retirement because they expect to increase their saving in 
the future. If people who act in this way are not automatically enrolled in a plan, 
they are unlikely to take the steps to enroll because they expect—possibly unreal-
istically—that in the future they will enroll or save money for retirement in other 
ways. However, if they are automatically enrolled, then taking the step of opting 
out of the plan would make it more obvious to themselves that they are behaving 
in a way that is inconsistent with their long-term goal of saving for retirement. 
So, once  automatically enrolled, most people choose to stay enrolled, even if they 
would not have taken the necessary action to enroll themselves.

 
Conclusion 
331
Taking into account nonmonetary opportunity costs, ignoring sunk costs, and be-
ing more realistic about future behavior are three ways in which consumers are able to 
 improve the decisions they make.
Step 3: Answer part b. by explaining why some employees don’t raise their saving 
rate above the default rate of 3 percent. The answer here is similar to the 
answer to part a. Presumably, people who would have chosen a saving rate of 
5 percent or 10 percent if they had not been automatically enrolled at 3 per-
cent intend to raise their saving rate in the future. Some may actually do so, 
but for others the fact that they are at least saving something may disguise the 
fact that they are spending too much in the present and saving too little to 
meet their long-run saving goals.
Your Turn: For more practice, do related problems 4.12 and 4.13 on page 338 at the end of this 
chapter.
Conclusion
In a market system, consumers are in the driver’s seat. Goods are produced only if  
consumers want them to be. Therefore, how consumers make their decisions is an im-
portant area for economists to study. Economists expect that consumers will spend their 
incomes so that the last dollar spent on each good provides them with equal additional 
amounts of satisfaction, or utility. In practice, there are significant social influences on 
consumer decision making, particularly when a good or service is consumed in  public. 
Fairness also seems to be an important consideration for most consumers. Finally, many 
consumers could improve the decisions they make if they would take into account 
 nonmonetary  opportunity costs and ignore sunk costs.
In this chapter, we studied consumers’ choices. In the next several chapters, we 
will study firms’ choices. Before moving on to the next chapter, read An Inside Look

 products—for good and bad.

Economics in Your Life
Do You Make Rational Decisions?
At the beginning of the chapter, we asked you to consider a situation in which you had paid 
$75 for a concert ticket, which is the most you would be willing to pay. Just before you enter 
the concert hall, someone offers you $90 for the ticket. We posed two questions: Would you sell 
the ticket? and Would an economist think it is rational to sell the ticket? If you answered that 
you would sell, then your answer is rational in the sense in which economists use the term. The 
cost of going to see the concert is what you have to give up for the ticket. Initially, the cost was 
just $75—the dollar price of the ticket. This amount was also the most you were willing to pay. 
However, once someone offers you $90 for the ticket, the cost of seeing the concert rises to $90. 
The reason the cost of the concert is now $90 is that once you turn down an offer of $90 for the 
ticket, you have incurred a nonmonetary opportunity cost of $90 if you use the ticket yourself. 
The endowment effect explains why some people would not sell the ticket. People seem to value 
things that they have more than things that they do not have. Therefore, a concert ticket you 
already own may be worth more to you than a concert ticket you have yet to purchase. Behav-
ioral economists study situations like this where people make choices that do not appear to be 
economically rational.

Do Celebrity 
Endorsements Help 
or Hurt a Brand?
In these celebrity-obsessed times, 
does the presence of a big-name en-
dorser boost the effectiveness of 
advertising? Some recent research 
delivers a mixed, but largely positive, 
verdict.
A report this month from the 
Nielsen Co. examined viewer re-
sponse to commercials that aired 
during the Academy Awards telecast 
on February 27, and it found that ce-
leb endorsements garnered four of 
the top 10 places in the brand-recall 
standings. Of these, the strongest rat-
ing went to a spot for Best Buy, featur-
ing not one but two celebrities: Ozzy 
Osbourne and Justin Bieber.
Right behind the Best Buy spot 
in the rankings was a commercial for 
Gillette’s Venus razor, starring Jennifer 
Lopez and her legs. Also in Nielsen’s 
brand-recall Top 10 were Celine Dion 
singing for the American Cancer so-
ciety, and Adrien Brody crooning on 
behalf of Stella Artois.
In its report of the findings, 
Nielsen noted that the Best Buy and 
Stella Artois spots scored much bet-
ter on Oscar night than they did when 
making their debut on this year’s Su-
per Bowl telecast, which might in-
dicate that viewers who already are 
intent on gazing at celebs are more 
receptive to them when they appear 
during a commercial break.
More Proof
Celebrity endorsements also got a 
thumbs-up in a study released last 
month by GfK MRI’s Starch Advertis-
ing Research. It found that print ads get 
higher readership scores when they fea-
tured a celeb. “On average, the ads that 
contained a celebrity endorser produced 
9.4 percent higher consumer readership 
than ads without a celebrity endorser,” 
said Starch’s report of its findings. . . .
On the Other Hand . . .
 
While the Starch and Nielsen 
studies found consumers responding 
positively to celeb-endorsement adver-
tising, a report released in January by 
Ace Metrix offered a dissenting voice 
where TV spots are concerned. (Ace 
specializes in gauging the effectiveness 
of TV advertising.) Analyzing viewer 
response to 2,600 commercials that 
aired between September and Decem-
ber 2010, the research firm found that 
celeb-centered commercials on aver-
age “do not perform any better than 
non-celebrity ads, and in some cases 
they perform much worse. . . . Over 
and over again, our analysis illustrated 
that celebrity ads performed either be-
low average or merely equaled it.”
Part of the problem is that celebri-
ties “are often polarizing.” The report 
cited Sarah Jessica Parker as an example 
of this, with respect to cosmetics ad-
vertising: “Some women believe Sarah 
 Jessica Parker is beautiful, but others 
do not—the eye-of-the-beholder issue.”
Like them or not, celebrity endorse-
ments are all the more ubiquitous these 
days, thanks to social media. A company 
Findings Are Mixed on the Success  
of Celebrity Endorsements
called Ad.ly has made a business of run-
ning celebrity endorsements via Twitter 
and, more recently, Facebook. . . .
 Whatever the medium in which 
celebrity endorsements appear, the va-
garies of celeb behavior pose a risk for 
brands that employ big-name endors-
ers. As Starch notes in the analysis of its 
findings, “the downside of using celeb-
rity endorsers has been in stark relief 
in the past few years” due to celeb-
rity scandals. (The report gives Tiger 
Woods, Brett Favre and Charlie Sheen 
dishonorable mentions in this context.)
But do consumers hold it against 
a brand when its celeb endorser strays 
from the straight and narrow? An Ad-
weekMedia/Harris Poll examined that 
question last year and found relatively 
few people inclined to engage in such 
guilt by association.
Seventy-four percent of that sur-
vey’s respondents said it wouldn’t af-
fect how they feel about a brand if an 
endorser were involved in a scandal, 
vs. 22 percent saying they’d feel worse 
about the brand. And let us not forget 
that some people relish a good scandal. 
That may account for the six percent of 
men and three percent of women who 
said they “feel better” about a brand 
when its endorser has been caught in 
a scandal. Among respondents in the 
18–34 age bracket, the “feel better” vote 
rose to double digits, at 11 percent.

c Celebrity endorsements can backfire if 
the celebrity gets caught up in a scan-
dal. Although an AdweekMedia/Harris Poll 
found that only 22 percent of respondents 
would feel worse about a brand if its ce-
lebrity endorser were involved in a scandal 
and 74 percent would be indifferent, with 
the millions of dollars that are spent hiring 
celebrities to endorse products, it is un-
derstandable why companies may be very 
selective in their choice of celebrity 
endorsers.
Thinking Critically
1. Celebrity endorsements may be reward-
ing to firms, but they can also be risky. 
By hiring Jennifer Lopez to endorse the 
Venus razor, Gillette tied the image of the 
razor to Lopez’s  image in the minds of the 
public. What do you think would happen 
to the  demand curve for the  Venus razor 
if  Jennifer  Lopez were to get   involved in 
an  embarrassing scandal?
2. Gillette presumably paid Jennifer Lopez 
a considerable amount to endorse the 
Venus razor. Should a firm whose ce-
lebrity endorser was just arrested make 
a decision about whether to cancel its 
ad campaign based on the amount of 
money it has already spent on making 
the ads? Briefly explain.
razor. A celebrity of Lopez’s stature can 
command huge fees to endorse a product, 
so Gillette must believe that consumers’ 
taste for its Venus razor will significantly in-
crease due to hiring Lopez for its ads.
We saw in Chapter 3 that when con-
sumers’ taste for a product increases, the 
demand curve shifts to the right. The figure 
below shows that if the endorsement by 
Jennifer Lopez is successful, the demand 
curve for the Venus razor shifts from D1 to 
D2. The increase in demand allows Gillette 
to sell more Venus razors at every price. 
For example, at a price of P1, it could sell 
Q1 Venus razors without the endorsement 
from Lopez, but Q2 Venus razors with the 
endorsement.
b Whereas the Nielsen and Starch re-
ports indicate a positive reaction by 
consumers to celebrity-endorsed products, 
a study by Ace Metrix found that television 
advertising featuring celebrity endorsers 
fared no better, and sometimes worse, than 
ads without a celebrity endorsement. The 
chapter notes two reasons celebrity en-
dorsements attract customers: Consumers 
perceive the celebrity as particularly knowl-
edgeable about the product, and some 
consumers feel fashionable and closer to 
celebrities if they use the same products. 
These considerations help explain why 
some companies are willing to pay consid-
erable sums to have celebrities endorse 
their products, but the Ace Metrix study in-
dicates that these large payouts may not 
reap the desired benefits.
Key Points in the Article
In February 2011, the Nielsen Company 
surveyed viewers to determine what they 
remembered about commercials that aired 
during the Academy Awards telecast. The 
survey found that in terms of brand recall,  
4 of the top 10 advertisements used ce-
lebrity endorsers. In a May 2011 study, 
celebrity endorsements were also found to 
be effective in print advertising, with ads 
featuring a celebrity receiving an average 
of 9.4 percent more readership than those 
without a celebrity endorsement. Ace  Metrix 
 reported a different finding in an analysis of 
viewer response to TV commercials airing 
from September to December 2010. This 
report found that ads featuring celebrity 
endorsements performed no better, and 
often worse, than non-celebrity ads. Celeb-
rity endorsements may also pose a risk to 
companies if the endorsing celebrity falls 
out of public favor due to being involved 
in a scandal. But an AdweekMedia/Harris 
Poll found that almost three-fourths of the 
respondents would not feel differently about 
a brand if the brand’s celebrity endorser be-
came involved in a scandal.
Analyzing the News
a The Nielsen study found that during the 
Academy Awards broadcast, celebrity-
endorsed products fared well, taking 4 of

vertisements. One of those ads featured

Summary
Utility is the enjoyment or satisfaction that people receive from 
consuming goods and services. The goal of a consumer is to spend 
available income so as to maximize utility. Marginal utility is the 
change in total utility a person receives from consuming one ad-
ditional unit of a good or service. The law of diminishing mar-
ginal utility states that consumers receive diminishing additional 
satisfaction as they consume more of a good or service during a 
given period of time. The budget constraint is the amount of in-
come consumers have available to spend on goods and services. 
To maximize utility, consumers should make sure they spend 
their income so that the last dollar spent on each product gives 
them the same marginal utility. The income effect is the change 
in the quantity demanded of a good that results from the effect of 
a change in the price on consumer purchasing power. The sub-
stitution effect is the change in the quantity demanded of a good 
that results from a change in price making the good more or less 
expensive relative to other goods, holding constant the effect of 
the price change on consumer purchasing power.

lower price for pizza might lead you to buy less pizza? 
Briefly explain.
Summary
When the price of a good declines, the ratio of the marginal util-
ity to price rises. This leads consumers to buy more of that good. 
As a result, whenever the price of a product falls, the quantity de-
manded increases. We saw in Chapter 1 that this is known as the 
law of demand. The market demand curve can be constructed from 
the individual demand curves for all the consumers in the market.

Summary
Social factors can have an effect on consumption. For example, the 
amount of utility people receive from consuming a good often de-
pends on how many other people they know who also consume 
the good. There is a network externality in the consumption of a 
product if the usefulness of the product increases with the number 
of consumers who use it. There is also evidence that people like to 
be treated fairly and that they usually attempt to treat others fairly, 
even if doing so makes them worse off financially. This result has 
been demonstrated in laboratory experiments, such as the ultima-
tum game. When firms set prices, they take into account consum-
ers’ preference for fairness. For example, hardware stores often do 
not increase the price of snow shovels to take advantage of a tem-
porary increase in demand following a snowstorm.

A waste of time! After arriving at our hotel in 
Switzerland at 7 p.m., my wife and I had both 
hoped to work on our computers—but we 
couldn’t. Although we had bought universal plug 
adapters (which convert American plugs to Eu-
ropean, Australian, and English outlets), it turns 
out that Switzerland has its own unique three-
prong plug. Why? This kind of plug adapter  
is not sold with standard adapter sets. Why does 
Switzerland renounce the network externalities 
that would come with using standard European 
plugs with their standard 220-volt electricity?
 
 How is Switzerland “renouncing network externalities” by 
not using standard European plugs?

Describe the behavioral economics approach to understanding decision making. 
Summary
Behavioral economics is the study of situations in which people act 
in ways that are not economically rational. Opportunity cost is the 
highest-valued alternative that must be given up to engage in an ac-
tivity. People would improve their decision making if they took into 
account nonmonetary opportunity costs. People sometimes ignore 
nonmonetary opportunity costs because of the endowment effect—
the tendency of people to be unwilling to sell something they already 
own even if they are offered a price that is greater than the price they 
would be willing to pay to buy the good if they didn’t already own 
it. People would also improve their decision making if they ignored 
sunk costs. A sunk cost is a cost that has already been paid and can-
not be recovered. Finally, people would improve their decision mak-
ing if they were more realistic about their future behavior.

4.4 Richard Thaler, an economist at the University of Chicago, 
is the person who first used the term endowment effect 
to describe placing a higher value on something already 
owned than would be placed on the object if not currently 
owned. According to an article in the Economist:
Dr. Thaler, who recently had some expensive 
bottles of wine stolen, observes that he is “now 
confronted with precisely one of my own ex-
periments: these are bottles I wasn’t planning 
to sell and now I’m going to get a cheque from 
an insurance company and most of these bot-
tles I will not buy. I’m a good enough econo-
mist to know there’s a bit of an inconsistency 
there.”
 
 Based on Thaler’s statement, how do his stolen bottles of 
wine illustrate the endowment effect, and why does he 
make the statement: “I’m a good enough economist to 
know there’s a bit of an inconsistency there”?

for a copy, but can’t find one at that price until one day in 
a used bookstore you see a copy selling for $10, which you 
immediately buy. Are you being irrational if you keep the 
copy rather than sell it?
 
4.6 Someone who owns a townhouse wrote to a real estate ad-

would you buy this townhouse today as an investment? 
Because every day you don’t sell it, you’re buying it.” Do 
you agree with the columnist? In what sense are you buy-
ing something if you don’t sell it? Should the owner’s deci-
sion about whether or not to sell depend on what price he 
originally paid for the townhouse?

Appendix
Using Indifference Curves and 
Budget Lines to Understand 
Consumer Behavior
Consumer Preferences
In this chapter, we analyzed consumer behavior, using the assumption that satisfaction, 
or utility, is measurable in utils. Although this assumption made our analysis easier to 
understand, it is unrealistic. In this appendix we use the more realistic assumption that 
consumers are able to rank different combinations of goods and services in terms of 
how much utility they provide. For example, a consumer is able to determine whether 
he or she prefers 2 slices of pizza and 1 can of Coke or 1 slice of pizza and 2 cans of 
Coke, even if the consumer is unsure exactly how much utility he or she would receive 
from consuming these goods. This approach has the advantage of allowing us to actu-
ally draw a map of a consumer’s preferences.
To begin with, suppose that a consumer is presented with the following alternatives, 
or consumption bundles:
Consumption Bundle A
Consumption Bundle B
2 slices of pizza and 1 can of Coke
1 slice of pizza and 2 cans of Coke
We assume that the consumer will always be able to decide which of the following is true:
• 
The consumer prefers bundle A to bundle B.
• 
The consumer prefers bundle B to bundle A.
•  The consumer is indifferent between bundle A and bundle B. That is, the consumer 
would be equally happy to receive either bundle, so we can say the consumer  
receives equal utility from the two bundles.
For consistency, we also assume that the consumer’s preferences are transitive. For ex-
ample, if a consumer prefers pepperoni pizza to mushroom pizza and prefers mushroom 
pizza to anchovy pizza, the consumer must prefer pepperoni pizza to anchovy pizza.
Indifference Curves
Given the assumptions in the preceding section, we can draw a map of a consumer’s pref-
erences by using indifference curves. An indifference curve shows combinations of con-
sumption bundles that give the consumer the same utility. In reality, consumers choose 
among consumption bundles containing many goods and services, but to make the discus-
sion easier to follow, we will assume that only two goods are involved. Nothing important 
would change if we expanded the discussion to include many goods instead of just two.
The table in Figure 10A.1 gives Dave’s preferences for pizza and Coke. The graph 
plots the information from the table. Every possible combination of pizza and Coke will 
have an indifference curve passing through it, although in the figure we have shown 
only four of Dave’s indifference curves. Dave is indifferent among all the consumption 
bundles that are on the same indifference curve. So, he is indifferent among bundles E, 
B, and F because they all lie on indifference curve I3. Even though Dave has 4 fewer cans 
of Coke with bundle B than with bundle E, the additional slice of pizza he has in bundle 
B means he has the same amount of utility at both points.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
Use indifference curves and 
budget lines to understand 
consumer behavior.
Indifference curve A curve 
that shows the combinations of 
consumption bundles that give the 
consumer the same utility.

340 
C H A P T E R  1 0  Consumer Choice and Behavioral Economics
Even without looking at Dave’s indifference curves, we know he will prefer con-
sumption bundle D to consumption bundle A because in D he receives the same quantity 
of pizza as in A but 4 additional cans of Coke. But we need to know Dave’s preferences, 
as shown by his indifference curves, to know how he will rank bundle B and bundle D. 
Bundle D contains more Coke but less pizza than bundle B, so Dave’s ranking will de-
pend on how much pizza he would be willing to give up to receive more Coke. The 
higher the indifference curve—that is, the further to the upper right on the graph—the 
greater the amounts of both goods that are available for Dave to consume and the greater 
his utility. In other words, Dave receives more utility from the consumption bundles on 
indifference curve I2 than from the consumption bundles on indifference curve I1, more 
utility from the bundles on I3 than from the bundles on I2, and so on.
The Slope of an Indifference Curve
Remember that the slope of a curve is the ratio of the change in the variable on the 
vertical axis to the change in the variable on the horizontal axis. Along an indifference 
curve, the slope tells us the rate at which the consumer is willing to trade off one prod-
uct for another while keeping the consumer’s utility constant. Economists call this rate 
the marginal rate of substitution (MRS).
We expect that the MRS will change as we move down an indifference curve. In  
Figure 10A.1, at a point like E on indifference curve I3, Dave’s indifference curve is relatively 
steep. As we move down the curve, it becomes less steep, until it becomes relatively flat at 
a point like F. This is the usual shape of indifference curves: They are bowed in, or convex. 
A consumption bundle like E contains a lot of Coke and not much pizza. We would expect 
that Dave could give up a significant quantity of Coke for a smaller quantity of additional 
pizza and still have the same level of utility. Thus, the MRS will be high. As we move down 
the indifference curve, Dave moves to bundles, like B and F, that have more pizza and less 
Coke. As a result, Dave is willing to trade less Coke for pizza, and the MRS declines.
Can Indifference Curves Ever Cross?
Remember that we assume that consumers have transitive preferences. That is, if Dave 
prefers consumption bundle X to consumption bundle Y and he prefers consumption 
bundle Y to consumption bundle Z, he must prefer bundle X to bundle Z. If indiffer-
ence curves cross, this assumption is violated. To understand why, look at Figure 10A.2, 
which shows two of Dave’s indifference curves crossing.
Because bundle X and bundle Z are both on indifference curve I1, Dave must be 
indifferent between them. Similarly, because bundle X and bundle Y are on indifference 
curve I2, Dave must be indifferent between them. The assumption of transitivity means 
that Dave should also be indifferent between bundle Z and bundle Y. We know that this 
is not true, however, because bundle Y contains more pizza and more Coke than bundle 
Z. So, Dave will definitely prefer bundle Y to bundle Z, which violates the assumption of 
transitivity. Therefore, none of Dave’s indifference curves can cross.

Figure 10A.1
Plotting Dave’s Preferences  
for Pizza and Coke
Every possible combination of pizza and 
Coke will have an indifference curve passing 
through it, although in the graph we show 
just four of Dave’s indifference curves. Dave 
is indifferent among all the consumption 
bundles that are on the same indifference 
curve. So, he is indifferent among bundles 
E, B, and F because they all lie on indiffer-
ence curve I3. Moving to the upper right in 
the graph increases the quantities of both 
goods available for Dave to consume. There-
fore, the further to the upper right the indif-
ference curve is, the greater the utility Dave 
receives.

Appendix Using Indifference Curves and Budget Lines to Understand Consumer Behavior 
341
The Budget Constraint
Remember that a consumer’s budget constraint is the amount of income he or she has 
available to spend on goods and services. Suppose that Dave has $10 per week to spend 
on pizza and Coke. The table in Figure 10A.3 shows the combinations that he can afford 
to buy if the price of pizza is $2 per slice and the price of Coke is $1 per can. As you can 
see, all the points lie on a straight line. This line represents Dave’s budget constraint. The 
line intersects the vertical axis at the maximum number of cans of Coke Dave can af-
ford to buy with $10, which is consumption bundle G. The line intersects the horizontal 
axis at the maximum number of slices of pizza Dave can afford to buy with $10, which 
Figure 10A.2 
Indifference Curves Cannot 
Cross
Because bundle X and bundle Z are both on 
indifference curve I1, Dave must be indiffer-
ent between them. Similarly, because bundle 
X and bundle Y are on indifference curve I2, 
Dave must be indifferent between them. The 
assumption of transitivity means that Dave 
should also be indifferent between bundle 
Z and bundle Y. We know that this is not 
true, however, because bundle Y contains 
more pizza and more Coke than bundle Z. 
So Dave will definitely prefer bundle Y to 
bundle Z, which violates the assumption of 
transitivity. Therefore, none of Dave’s in-
difference curves can cross.

Dave’s Budget Constraint
Dave’s budget constraint shows the combi-
nations of slices of pizza and cans of Coke 
he can buy with $10. The price of Coke is 
$1 per can, so if he spends all of his $10 on 
Coke, he can buy 10 cans (bundle G). The 
price of pizza is $2 per slice, so if he spends 
all of his $10 on pizza, he can buy 5 slices 
(bundle L). As he moves down his budget 
constraint from bundle G, he gives up 2 cans 
of Coke for every slice of pizza he buys. Any 
consumption bundles along the line or in-
side the line are  affordable. Any bundles that 
lie outside the line are unaffordable.

342 
C H A P T E R  1 0  Consumer Choice and Behavioral Economics
is consumption bundle L. As he moves down his budget constraint from bundle G, he 
gives up 2 cans of Coke for every slice of pizza he buys.
Any consumption bundle along the line or inside the line is affordable for Dave be-
cause he has the income to buy those combinations of pizza and Coke. Any bundle that 
lies outside the line is unaffordable because those bundles cost more than the income 
Dave has available to spend.
The slope of the budget constraint is constant because the budget constraint is a 
straight line. The slope of the line equals the change in the number of cans of Coke 
divided by the change in the number of slices of pizza. In this case, moving down the 
budget constraint from one point to another point, the change in the number of cans of 
Coke equals −2, and the change in the number of slices of pizza equals 1, so the slope 
equals −2/1, or −2. Notice that with the price of pizza equal to $2 per slice and the price 
of Coke equal to $1 per can, the slope of the budget constraint is equal to the ratio of 
the price of pizza to the price of Coke (multiplied by −1). In fact, this result will always 
hold: The slope of the budget constraint is equal to the ratio of the price of the good on the 
horizontal axis divided by the price of the good on the vertical axis multiplied by −1.
Choosing the Optimal Consumption  
of Pizza and Coke
Dave would like to be on the highest possible indifference curve because higher indif-
ference curves represent more pizza and more Coke. But Dave can only buy the bundles 
that lie on or inside his budget constraint. In other words, to maximize utility, a con-
sumer needs to be on the highest indifference curve, given his budget constraint.
Figure 10A.4 plots the consumption bundles from Figure 10A.1 along with the bud-
get constraint from Figure 10A.3. The figure also shows the indifference curves that 
pass through each consumption bundle. In Figure 10A.4, the highest indifference curve 
shown is I4. Unfortunately, Dave lacks the income to purchase consumption bundles—
such as C—that lie on I4. He has the income to purchase bundles such as A and D, but 
he can do better. If he consumes bundle B, he will be on the highest indifference curve 
he can reach, given his budget constraint of $10. The resulting combination of 3 slices 
of pizza and 4 cans of Coke represents optimal consumption of pizza and Coke, given

Dave would like to be on the highest pos-

indifference curves such as I4 that are out-
side his budget constraint. Dave’s optimal 
combination of slices of pizza and cans of 
Coke is at point B, where his budget con-
straint just touches—or is tangent to—the 
highest indifference curve he can reach. 
At point B, he buys 3 slices of pizza and 
4 cans of Coke.

constraint just touches—or is tangent to—I3. In fact, bundle B is the only bundle on I3 
that Dave is able to purchase for $10.
Dell Determines the Optimal Mix  
of Products
Consumers have different preferences, which helps explain 
why many firms offer products with a variety of character-
istics. For example, Dell sells laptop computers with different screen sizes, processor 
speeds, hard drive sizes, graphics cards, and so on. We can use the model of consumer 
choice to analyze a simplified version of the situation Dell faces in deciding which  
features to offer consumers.
Assume that consumers have $1,000 each to spend on laptops and that they are con-
cerned with only two laptop characteristics: screen size and processor speed. Because 
larger screens and faster processors increase Dell’s cost of producing laptops, consumers 
face a trade-off: The larger the screen, the slower the processor speed. Consumers in 
panel (a) of the figure prefer screen size to processor speed. For this group, the point 
of tangency between a typical consumer’s indifference curve and the budget constraint 
shows an optimal choice of a 17-inch screen and a 2.0-gigahertz processor. Consumers 
in panel (b) prefer processor speed to screen size. For this group, the point of tangency 
between a typical consumer’s indifference curve and the budget constraint shows an 
optimal choice of a 13-inch screen and 3.4-gigahertz processor.

shows, when the price of pizza is $2 per slice, the maximum number of slices Dave can 
buy is 5. After the price of pizza falls to $1 per slice, Dave can buy a maximum of 10 
slices. His budget constraint rotates outward from point A to point B to represent this. 
(Notice that the fall in the price of pizza does not affect the maximum number of cans of 
Coke Dave can buy with his $10.)
When his budget constraint rotates outward, Dave is able to purchase consump-
tion bundles that were previously unaffordable. Panel (a) of Figure 10A.6 shows that the 
combination of 3 slices of pizza and 4 cans of Coke was optimal when the price of pizza 
was $2 per slice, but the combination of 7 slices of pizza and 3 cans of Coke is optimal 
when the price of pizza falls to $1. The lower price of pizza causes Dave to consume 
more pizza and less Coke and to end up on a higher indifference curve.
The change in Dave’s optimal consumption of pizza as the price changes explains 
why demand curves slope downward. Dave adjusted his consumption of pizza as 
follows:
 Price of pizza = +2 per slice 1 Quantity of pizza demanded = 3 slices
 Price of pizza = +1 per slice 1 Quantity of pizza demanded = 7 slices
In panel (b) of Figure 10A.6, we plot the two points of optimal consumption and 
draw a line to connect the points. This downward-sloping line is Dave’s demand curve 
for pizza. We could find more points on the demand curve by changing the price of 
pizza and finding the new optimal number of slices of pizza Dave would demand.
Remember that according to the law of demand, demand curves always slope 
downward. We have just shown that the law of demand results from the optimal adjust-
ment by consumers to changes in prices. A fall in the price of a good will rotate outward 
the budget constraint and make it possible for a consumer to reach higher indifference 
curves. As a result, the consumer will increase the quantity of the good demanded. An 
increase in price will rotate inward the budget constraint and force the consumer to 
a lower indifference curve. As a result, the consumer will decrease the quantity of the 
good demanded.

How a Price Change Affects

In panel (a), a fall in the price of pizza results 
in Dave’s consuming less Coke and more pizza.
1. A fall in the price of pizza rotates the 
budget constraint outward because 
Dave can now buy more pizza with 
his $10.
2. In the new optimum on indifference 
curve I2, Dave changes the quantities 
he consumes of both goods. His con-
sumption of Coke falls from 4 cans to 3 
cans.
3. In the new optimum, Dave’s con-
sumption of pizza increases from 3 
slices to 7 slices.
In panel (b) Dave responds optimally to the 
fall in the price of pizza from $2 per slice to 
$1, by increasing the quantity of slices he 
consumes from 3 slices to 7 slices. When we 
graph this result, we have Dave’s demand 
curve for pizza.

When Does a Price Change Make  
a Consumer Better Off?
Dave has $300 to spend each month on DVDs and CDs. 
DVDs and CDs both currently have a price of $10, and Dave 
is maximizing his utility by buying 20 DVDs and 10 CDs. 
Suppose Dave still has $300 to spend, but the price of a CD 
rises to $20, while the price of a DVD drops to $5. Is Dave 
better or worse off than he was before the price change? Use 
a budget constraint–indifference curve graph to illustrate

The Income Effect and the Substitution Effect 
of a Price Change
We saw in this chapter that a price change has two effects on the quantity of a good 
consumed: the income effect and the substitution effect. The income effect is the change 
in the quantity demanded of a good that results from the effect of a change in price on 
Solving the Problem
Step 1: Review the chapter material. This problem concerns the effect of price 
changes on optimal consumption, so you may want to review the section  
“Deriving the Demand Curve,” which begins on page 343.
Step 2: Slove the problem by drawing the appropriate graph. We begin by drawing 
the budget constraint, indifference curve, and point of optimal consumption 
for the original prices:

Now draw a graph that shows the results of the price changes. Notice that in 
this problem, the prices of both goods change. However, you can determine 
the position of the new budget constraint by calculating the maximum quan-
tity of DVDs and CDs Dave can buy after the price changes. You should also 
note that after the price changes, Dave can still buy his original optimal con-
sumption bundle—20 DVDs and 10 CDs—by spending all of his $300, so his 
new budget constraint must pass through this point.

At the new prices, Dave can buy a maximum of 60 DVDs or 15 CDs. Both his 
old and his new budget constraints pass through the consumption bundle at point 
A. This consumption bundle is no longer optimal, however, because with the new 
prices, it is possible for him to reach an indifference curve that is higher than I1. 
We can draw in the new highest indifference curve he can reach—I2—and show 
the new optimal consumption bundle—point B:
Because Dave can now reach a higher indifference curve, we can con-
clude that he is better off as a result of the price change.

Income and Substitution Effects 
of a Price Change
Following a decline in the price of pizza, 
Dave’s optimal consumption of pizza in-
creases from 3 slices (point A) per week to 
7 slices per week (point C). We can think 
of this movement from point A to point C 
as taking place in two steps: The movement 
from point A to point B along indifference 
curve I1 represents the substitution effect, 
and the movement from point B to point C 
represents the income effect. Dave increases 
his consumption of pizza from 3 slices per 
week to 5 slices per week because of the sub-
stitution effect of a fall in the price of pizza 
and from 5 slices per week to 7 slices per 
week because of the income effect.

consumer purchasing power, holding all other factors constant. The substitution effect 
is the change in the quantity demanded of a good that results from a change in price 
making the good more or less expensive relative to other goods, holding constant the ef-
fect of the price change on consumer purchasing power. We can use indifference curves 
and budget constraints to analyze these two effects more exactly.
Figure 10A.7 illustrates the same situation as Figure 10A.6: The price of pizza has 
fallen from $2 per slice to $1 per slice, and Dave’s budget constraint has rotated out-
ward. As before, Dave’s optimal consumption of pizza increases from 3 slices (point A in 
Figure 10A.7) per week to 7 slices per week (point C). We can think of this movement 
from point A to point C as taking place in two steps: The movement from point A to 
point B represents the substitution effect, and the movement from point B to point C 
represents the income effect. To isolate the substitution effect, we have to hold constant 
the effect of the price change on Dave’s income. We do this by changing the price of 
pizza relative to the price of Coke but at the same time holding his utility constant by 
keeping Dave on the same indifference curve. In Figure 10A.7, in moving from point A to 
point B, Dave remains on indifference curve I1. Point A is a point of tangency between 
I1 and Dave’s original budget constraint. Point B is a point of tangency between I1 and 
a new, hypothetical budget constraint that has a slope equal to the new ratio of the price 
of pizza to the price of Coke. At point B, Dave has increased his consumption of pizza 
from 3 slices to 5 slices. Because we are still on indifference curve I1, we know that this 
increase is Dave’s response only to the change in the relative price of pizza and, there-
fore, that the increase represents the substitution effect of the fall in the price of pizza.
At point B, Dave has not spent all his income. Remember that the fall in the price of pizza 
has increased Dave’s purchasing power. In Figure 10A.7, we illustrate the additional pizza 
Dave consumes because of the income effect of increased purchasing power by the move-
ment from point B to point C. Notice that in moving from point B to point C, the price of 
pizza relative to the price of Coke is constant because the slope of the new budget constraint 
is the same as the slope of the hypothetical budget constraint that is tangent to I1 at point B.
We can conclude that Dave increases his consumption of pizza from 3 slices per week 
to 5 slices per week because of the substitution effect of a fall in the price of pizza and from 5 
slices per week to 7 slices per week because of the income effect. Recall from our discussion of 
income and substitution effects in this chapter that the income effect of a price decline causes 
consumers to buy more of a normal good and less of an inferior good. Because the income ef-
fect causes Dave to increase his consumption of pizza, pizza must be a normal good for him.

How a Change in Income Affects Optimal 
Consumption
Suppose that the price of pizza remains at $2 per slice, but the income Dave has to spend 
on pizza and Coke increases from $10 to $20. Figure 10A.8 shows how this affects his 
budget constraint. With an income of $10, Dave could buy a maximum of 5 slices of 
pizza or 10 cans of Coke. With an income of $20, he can buy 10 slices of pizza or 20 cans 
of Coke. The additional income allows Dave to increase his consumption of both pizza 
and Coke and to move to a higher indifference curve. Figure 10A.9 shows Dave’s new 
optimum. Dave is able to increase his consumption of pizza from 3 slices per week to 7 
and his consumption of Coke from 4 cans per week to 6.

Appendix Using Indifference Curves and Budget Lines to Understand Consumer Behavior

The Slope of the Indifference Curve, the 
Slope of the Budget Line, and the Rule of 
Equal Marginal Utility per Dollar Spent
In this chapter, we saw that consumers maximize utility when they consume each good 
up to the point where the marginal utility per dollar spent is the same for every good. 
This condition seems different from the one we stated earlier in this appendix that to 
maximize utility, a consumer needs to be on the highest indifference curve, given his 
budget constraint. In fact, though, the two conditions are equivalent. To see this, begin 
by looking at Figure 10A.10, which again combines Dave’s indifference curve and bud-
get constraint. Remember that at the point of optimal consumption, the indifference 
curve and the budget constraint are tangent, so they have the same slope. Therefore, at 
the point of optimal consumption, the marginal rate of substitution (MRS) is equal to the 
ratio of the price of the product on the horizontal axis to the price of the product on the 
vertical axis.
The slope of the indifference curve tells us the rate at which a consumer is willing 
to trade off one good for the other. The slope of the budget constraint tells us the rate at 
which a consumer is able to trade off one good for the other. Only at the point of opti-
mal consumption is the rate at which a consumer is willing to trade off one good for the 
other equal to the rate at which he can trade off one good for the other.
The Rule of Equal Marginal Utility  
per Dollar Spent Revisited
Recall from this chapter the rule of equal marginal utility per dollar, which states that to 
maximize utility, consumers should spend their income so that the last dollar spent on 
each product gives them the same marginal utility. We can use our indifference curve 
and budget constraint analysis to see why this rule holds. When we move from one 
point on an indifference curve to another, we end up with more of one product and 
less of the other product but the same amount of utility. For example, as Dave moves 
down an indifference curve, he consumes less Coke and more pizza, but he has the same 
amount of utility.

At the optimum point, the slope
of the indifference curve equals
the slope of the budget constraint.
The marginal rate of substitution

Remember that marginal utility (MU) tells us how much additional utility a con-
sumer gains (or loses) from consuming more (or less) of a good. So when Dave con-
sumes less Coke by moving down an indifference curve, he loses utility equal to:
 
- Change in the quantity of Coke * MUCoke
but he consumes more pizza, so he gains utility equal to:
Change in the quantity of pizza * MUPizza.
We know that the gain in utility from the additional pizza is equal to the loss from 
the smaller quantity of Coke because Dave’s total utility remains the same along an  
indifference curve. Therefore, we can write:
- (Change in the quantity of Coke * MUCoke) = (Change in the quantity of pizza * MUPizza).
If we rearrange terms, we have:
- Change in the quantity of Coke
Change in the quantity of pizza
= MUPizza
MUCoke
.
Because the expression:
- Change in the quantity of Coke
Change in the quantity of pizza
is the slope of the indifference curve, it is equal to the marginal rate of substitution 
(multiplied by negative 1). So, we can write:
- Change in the quantity of Coke
Change in the quantity of pizza
= MRS = MUPizza
MUCoke
.
The slope of Dave’s budget constraint equals the price of pizza divided by the price 
of Coke (multiplied by negative 1). We saw earlier in this appendix that at the point of 
optimal consumption, the MRS equals the ratio of the prices of the two goods. Therefore:
MUPizza
MUCoke
= PPizza
PCoke
.
We can rewrite this to show that at the point of optimal consumption:
MUPizza
PPizza
= MUCoke
PCoke
.
This last expression is the rule of equal marginal utility per dollar that we first de-
veloped in this chapter. So we have shown how this rule follows from the indifference 
curve and budget constraint approach to analyzing consumer choice.

Suppose that you have the opportunity to open a store that sells recliners. You learn that you can 
purchase the recliners from the manufacturer for $300 each. Bob’s Big Chairs is an existing store 
that is the same size your new store will be. Bob’s sells the same recliners you plan to sell and also 
buys them from the manufacturer for $300 each. Your plan is to sell the recliners for a price of $500. 
After studying how Bob’s is operated, you find that Bob’s is selling more recliners per month than 
you expect to be able to sell and that it is selling them for $450. You wonder how Bob’s makes a 
profit at the lower price. Are there any reasons to expect that because Bob’s sells more recliners per 
month, its costs will be lower than your store’s costs? You can check your answer against the one we 
provide on page 372 at the end of this chapter.
price for five thousand would be our reg-
ular price. That would be the beginning 
of the curve. For ten thousand there 
would be a discount, and that was at the 
bottom of the curve. For thirty thousand 
the price would begin to climb. For fifty 
thousand the price per unit would be 
higher than for five thousand, and for 
one hundred thousand units the price 
per unit would have to be much higher 
than for the first five thousand.
Morita offered prices that followed a  
U shape because Sony’s cost per unit, or 
average cost, of manufacturing the radios 
had the same shape. Curves that show the 
relationship between the level of output and 
per-unit cost are called average total cost 
curves. Average total cost curves typically 
have the U shape of Morita’s curve. As we 
explore the relationship between production 
and costs in this chapter, we will see why av-
erage total cost curves have this shape.

Technological change leads to new products 
and lower production costs. As a firm’s costs 
change, how does the firm adjust the price it 
charges? This is an important question that 
we will explore in the next few chapters, and it 
is a question that Sony Corporation, the Japa-
nese electronics giant, must answer every day. 
Sony manufactures computers, televisions, 
and game consoles, among other products.
Sony’s early success resulted from the 
vision and energy of two young entrepre-
neurs, Akio Morita and Masaru Ibuka. In 
1953, Sony purchased a license that allowed 
it to use transistor technology developed in 
the United States at Bell Laboratories. Sony 
used the technology to develop a transistor 
radio that was far smaller than any other ra-
dio then available. In 1955, Akio Morita ar-
rived in New York, hoping to convince one 
of the U.S. department store chains to carry 
the Sony radios.
Morita offered to sell one department 
store chain 5,000 radios at a price of $29.95 
each. If the chain wanted more than 5,000 
radios, the price would change. As Morita 
described it years later:

n Chapter 10, we looked behind the demand curve to better understand consumer 
decision making. In this chapter, we look behind the supply curve to better under-
stand firm decision making. Earlier chapters showed that supply curves are upward 
sloping because marginal cost increases as firms increase the quantity of a good that 
they supply. In this chapter, we look more closely at why this is true. In the appendix to this 
chapter, we extend the analysis by using isoquants and isocost lines to understand the rela-
tionship between production and costs. Once we have a good understanding of production 
and cost, we can proceed in the following chapters to understand how firms decide what 
level of output to produce and what price to charge.
Technology: An Economic Definition
The basic activity of a firm is to use inputs, such as workers, machines, and natural 
resources, to produce outputs of goods and services. A pizza parlor, for example, uses 
inputs such as pizza dough, pizza sauce, cooks, and ovens to produce pizza. A firm’s 
technology is the processes it uses to turn inputs into outputs of goods and services. 
Notice that this economic definition of technology is broader than the everyday defini-
tion. When we use the word technology in everyday language, we usually refer only to 
the development of new products. In the economic sense, a firm’s technology depends 
on many factors, such as the skills of its managers, the training of its workers, and the 
speed and efficiency of its machinery and equipment. The technology of pizza produc-
tion, for example, includes not only the capacity of the pizza ovens and how quickly they 
bake the pizza but also how quickly the cooks can prepare the pizza for baking, how well 
the manager motivates the workers, and how well the manager has arranged the facili-
ties to allow the cooks to quickly prepare the pizzas and get them in the ovens.
Whenever a firm experiences positive technological change, it is able to produce 
more output using the same inputs or the same output using fewer inputs. Positive tech-
nological change can come from many sources. A firm’s managers may rearrange the 
factory floor or the layout of a retail store in order to increase production and sales. The 
firm’s workers may go through a training program. The firm may install faster or more 
reliable machinery or equipment. It is also possible for a firm to experience negative 
technological change. If a firm hires less-skilled workers or if a hurricane damages its fa-
cilities, the quantity of output it can produce from a given quantity of inputs may decline.
11.1 LEARNING OBJECTIVE
Define technology and give 
examples of technological 
change.
Technology The processes a firm 
uses to turn inputs into outputs of 
goods and services.
Technological change A change in 
the ability of a firm to produce a given 
level of output with a given quantity 
of inputs.
Improving Inventory Control  
at  Wal-Mart
Inventories are goods that have been produced but not yet 
sold. For a retailer such as Wal-Mart, inventories at any point 
in time include the goods on the store shelves as well as goods in warehouses. Invento-
ries are an input into Wal-Mart’s output of goods sold to consumers. Having money tied 
up in holding inventories is costly, so firms have an incentive to hold as few invento-
ries as possible and to turn over their inventories as rapidly as possible by ensuring that 
goods do not remain on the shelves long. Holding too few inventories, however, results 
in stockouts—that is, sales being lost because the goods consumers want to buy are not 
on the shelf.
Improvements in inventory control meet the economic definition of positive tech-
nological change because they allow firms to produce the same output with fewer inputs. 
In recent years, many firms have adopted just-in-time inventory systems in which firms 
accept shipments from suppliers as close as possible to the time they will be needed. The 
just-in-time system was pioneered by Toyota, which used it to reduce the inventories of 
parts in its automobile assembly plants. Wal-Mart has been a pioneer in using similar 
inventory control systems in its stores.

The Short Run and the Long Run 
in Economics
When firms analyze the relationship between their level of production and their costs, 
they separate the time period involved into the short run and the long run. In the short 
run, at least one of the firm’s inputs is fixed. In particular, in the short run, the firm’s 
technology and the size of its physical plant—its factory, store, or office—are both fixed, 
while the number of workers the firm hires is variable. In the long run, the firm is able 
to vary all its inputs and can adopt new technology and increase or decrease the size 
of its physical plant. Of course, the actual length of calendar time in the short run will 
be different from firm to firm. A pizza parlor may be able to increase its physical plant 
by adding another pizza oven and some tables and chairs in just a few weeks. BMW, in 
contrast, may take more than a year to increase the capacity of one of its automobile as-
sembly plants by installing new equipment.
The Difference between Fixed Costs  
and Variable Costs
Total cost is the cost of all the inputs a firm uses in production. We have just seen that in 
the short run, some inputs are fixed and others are variable. The costs of the fixed inputs 
are fixed costs, and the costs of the variable inputs are variable costs. We can also think of 
variable costs as the costs that change as output changes. Similarly, fixed costs are costs 
that remain constant as output changes. A typical firm’s variable costs include its labor 
costs, raw material costs, and costs of electricity and other utilities. Typical fixed costs 
include lease payments for factory or retail space, payments for fire insurance, and pay-
ments for newspaper and television advertising. All of a firm’s costs are either fixed or 
variable, so we can state the following:
Total cost = Fixed cost + Variable cost
or, using symbols:
TC = FC + VC.
11.2 LEARNING OBJECTIVE
Distinguish between the 
economic short run and the 
economic long run.
Short run The period of time during 
which at least one of a firm’s inputs is 
fixed.
Long run The period of time in 
which a firm can vary all its inputs, 
adopt new technology, and increase or 
decrease the size of its physical plant.
Total cost The cost of all the inputs a 
firm uses in production.
Variable costs Costs that change as 
output changes.
Fixed costs Costs that remain 
constant as output changes.
Better inventory controls have 
helped Wal-Mart and other firms to 
reduce their costs.
Wal-Mart actively manages its supply chain, which stretches from the manufacturers 
of the goods it sells to its retail stores. Entrepreneur Sam Walton, the company founder, 
built a series of distribution centers spread across the country to supply goods to the re-
tail stores. As goods are sold in the stores, this point-of-sale information is sent electroni-
cally to the firm’s distribution centers to help managers determine what products will be 
shipped to each store. Depending on a store’s location relative to a distribution center, 
managers can use Wal-Mart’s trucks to ship goods overnight. This distribution system 
allows Wal-Mart to minimize its inventory holdings without running the risk of many 
stockouts occurring. Because Wal-Mart sells 15 percent to 25 percent of all the tooth-
paste, disposable diapers, dog food, and many other products sold in the United States, 
it has been able to involve many manufacturers closely in its supply chain. For example, 
a company such as Procter & Gamble, which is one of the world’s largest manufacturers 
of toothpaste, laundry detergent, toilet paper, and other products, receives Wal-Mart’s 
point-of-sale and inventory information electronically. Procter & Gamble uses that in-
formation to help determine its production schedules and the quantities it should ship to 
Wal-Mart’s distribution centers.
Technological change has been a key to Wal-Mart’s becoming one of the largest firms 
in the world, with 2.1 million employees and revenue of nearly $420 billion in 2011.

Academic book publishers hire editors, designers, and production and marketing 
managers who help prepare books for publication. Because these employees work on 
several books simultaneously, the number of people the company hires does not go up 
and down with the quantity of books the company publishes during any particular year. 
Publishing companies therefore consider the salaries and benefits of people in these job 
categories to be fixed costs.
In contrast, for a company that prints books, the quantity of workers varies with the 
quantity of books printed. The wages and benefits of the workers operating the printing 
presses, for example, would be a variable cost.
The other costs listed in the table above are typical of fixed costs at many firms.

Implicit Costs versus Explicit Costs
It is important to remember that economists always measure costs as opportunity costs. 
The opportunity cost of any activity is the highest-valued alternative that must be given 
up to engage in that activity. As we saw in Chapter 8, costs are either explicit or implicit. 
When a firm spends money, it incurs an explicit cost. When a firm experiences a non-
monetary opportunity cost, it incurs an implicit cost.
For example, suppose that Jill Johnson owns a pizza restaurant. In operating her 
store, Jill has explicit costs, such as the wages she pays her workers and the payments she 
makes for rent and electricity. But some of Jill’s most important costs are implicit. Before 
opening her own restaurant, Jill earned a salary of $30,000 per year managing a restau-
rant for someone else. To start her restaurant, Jill quit her job, withdrew $50,000 from 
her bank account—where it earned her interest of $3,000 per year—and used the funds 
to equip her restaurant with tables, chairs, a cash register, and other equipment. To open 
her own business, Jill had to give up the $30,000 salary and the $3,000 in interest. This 
$33,000 is an implicit cost because it does not represent payments that Jill has to make. 
Nevertheless, giving up this $33,000 per year is a real cost to Jill. In addition, during the 
course of the year, the $50,000 worth of tables, chairs, and other physical capital in Jill’s 
store will lose some of its value due partly to wear and tear and partly to better furniture, 
cash registers, and so forth becoming available. Economic depreciation is the difference 
between what Jill paid for her capital at the beginning of the year and what she could sell

the capital for at the end of the year. If Jill could sell the capital for $40,000 at the end 
of the year, then the $10,000 in economic depreciation represents another implicit cost. 
(Note that the whole $50,000 she spent on the capital is not a cost because she still has 
the equipment at the end of the year, although it is now worth only $40,000.)
Table 11.1 lists Jill’s costs. The entries in red are explicit costs, and the entries in 
blue are implicit costs. As we saw in Chapter 8, the rules of accounting generally require 
that only explicit costs be used for purposes of keeping the company’s financial records 
and for paying taxes. Therefore, explicit costs are sometimes called accounting costs. 
 Economic costs include both accounting costs and implicit costs.
The Production Function
Let’s look at the relationship between the level of production and costs in the short run for Jill 
Johnson’s restaurant. To keep things simpler than in the more realistic situation in Table 11.1, 
let’s assume that Jill uses only labor—workers—and one type of capital—pizza ovens—to 
produce a single good: pizzas. Many firms use more than two inputs and produce more than 
one good, but it is easier to understand the relationship between output and cost by focusing 
on the case of a firm using only two inputs and producing only one good. In the short run, 
Jill doesn’t have time to build a larger restaurant, install additional pizza ovens, or redesign 
the layout of her restaurant. So, in the short run, she can increase or decrease the quantity of 
pizzas she produces only by increasing or decreasing the quantity of workers she employs.
The first three columns of Table 11.2 show the relationship between the quantity 
of workers and ovens Jill uses per week and the quantity of pizzas she can produce. The 
relationship between the inputs employed by a firm and the maximum output it can 
produce with those inputs is called the firm’s production function. Because a firm’s 
technology is the processes it uses to turn inputs into output, the production function

C H A P T E R  1 1  Technology, Production, and Costs 
represents the firm’s technology. In this case, Table 11.2 shows Jill’s short-run production 
function because we are assuming that the time period is too short for Jill to increase or 
decrease the quantity of ovens she is using.
A First Look at the Relationship between  
Production and Cost
Table 11.2 shows Jill Johnson’s costs. We can determine the total cost of producing a 
given quantity of pizzas if we know how many workers and ovens are required to 
 produce that quantity of pizzas and what Jill has to pay for those workers and pizzas. 
Suppose Jill has taken out a bank loan to buy two pizza ovens. The cost of the loan is 
$800 per week. Therefore, her fixed costs are $800 per week. If Jill pays $650 per week 
to each worker, her variable costs depend on how many workers she hires. In the short 
run, Jill can increase the quantity of pizzas she produces only by hiring more workers. 
Table 11.2 shows that if she hires 1 worker, she produces 200 pizzas during the week; if 
she hires 2 workers, she produces 450 pizzas; and so on. For a particular week, Jill’s  total 
cost of producing pizzas is equal to the $800 she pays on the loan for the ovens plus the 
amount she pays to hire workers. If Jill decides to hire 4 workers and produce 600  pizzas, 
her total cost is $3,400: $800 to lease the ovens and $2,600 to hire the workers. Her cost 
per pizza is equal to her total cost of producing pizzas divided by the quantity of pizzas 
produced. If she produces 600 pizzas at a total cost of $3,400, her cost per pizza, or aver-
age total cost, is $3,400>600 = $5.67. A firm’s average total cost is always equal to its 
total cost divided by the quantity of output produced.
Panel (a) of Figure 11.1 uses the numbers in the next-to-last column of Table 11.2 
to graph Jill’s total cost. Panel (b) uses the numbers in the last column to graph her aver-
age total cost. Notice in panel (b) that Jill’s average cost has roughly the same U shape 
as the average cost curve we saw Akio Morita describe for Sony transistor radios at the 
beginning of this chapter. As production increases from low levels, average total cost falls.

 Figure 11.1  Graphing Total Cost and Average Total Cost at Jill Johnson’s Restaurant
We can use the information from Table 11.2 to graph the relationship between 
the quantity of pizzas Jill produces and her total cost and average total cost. 
Panel (a) shows that total cost increases as the level of production increases. In 
panel (b), we see that the average total cost is roughly U shaped: As production 
increases from low levels, average total cost falls before rising at higher levels of 
production. To understand why average total cost has this shape, we must look 
more closely at the technology of producing pizzas, as shown by the production 
function.

 
The Marginal Product of Labor and the Average Product of Labor  
359
Average total cost then becomes fairly flat, before rising at higher levels of production. To 
understand why average total cost has this U shape, we first need to look more closely at 
the technology of producing pizzas, as shown by the production function for Jill’s restau-
rant. Then we need to look at how this technology determines the relationship between 
production and cost.
The Marginal Product of Labor 
and the Average Product of Labor
To better understand the choices Jill faces, given the technology available to her, think 
first about what happens if she hires only one worker. That one worker will have to 
perform several different activities, including taking orders from customers, baking the 
pizzas, bringing the pizzas to the customers’ tables, and ringing up sales on the cash 
register. If Jill hires two workers, some of these activities can be divided up: One worker 
could take the orders and ring up the sales, and one worker could bake the pizzas. With 
such a division of tasks, Jill will find that hiring two workers actually allows her to pro-
duce more than twice as many pizzas as she could produce with just one worker.
The additional output a firm produces as a result of hiring one more worker is 
called the marginal product of labor. We can calculate the marginal product of labor 
by determining how much total output increases as each additional worker is hired. We 
do this for Jill’s restaurant in Table 11.3.
When Jill hires only 1 worker, she produces 200 pizzas per week. When she hires 2 
workers, she produces 450 pizzas per week. Hiring the second worker increases her pro-
duction by 250 pizzas per week. So, the marginal product of labor for the first worker 
is 200 pizzas. For the second worker, the marginal product of labor rises to 250 pizzas. 
This  increase in marginal product results from the division of labor and from special-
ization. By dividing the tasks to be performed—the division of labor—Jill reduces the 
time workers lose moving from one activity to the next. She also allows them to become 
more specialized at their tasks. For example, a worker who concentrates on baking piz-
zas will become skilled at doing so quickly and efficiently.
The Law of Diminishing Returns
In the short run, the quantity of pizza ovens Jill leases is fixed, so as she hires more 
workers, the marginal product of labor eventually begins to decline. This happens 
 because at some point, Jill uses up all the gains from the division of labor and from spe-
cialization and starts to experience the effects of the law of diminishing returns. This 
law states that adding more of a variable input, such as labor, to the same amount of a 
fixed input, such as capital, will eventually cause the marginal product of the variable 
input to decline. For Jill, the marginal product of labor begins to decline when she hires 
the third worker. Hiring three workers raises the quantity of pizzas she produces from

450 per week to 550. But the increase in the quantity of pizzas—100—is less than the 
increase when she hired the second worker—250.
If Jill kept adding more and more workers to the same quantity of pizza ovens, 
eventually workers would begin to get in each other’s way, and the marginal product of 
labor would actually become negative. When the marginal product is negative, the level 
of total output declines. No firm would actually hire so many workers as to experience a 
negative marginal product of labor and falling total output.

In panel (a), output increases as more workers are hired, but the increase in 
output does not occur at a constant rate. Because of specialization and the 
division of labor, output at first increases at an increasing rate, with each addi-
tional worker hired causing production to increase by a greater amount than 
did the hiring of the previous worker. After the third worker has been hired, 
hiring more workers while keeping the number of pizza ovens constant results 
in diminishing returns. When the point of diminishing returns is reached, 
production increases at a decreasing rate. Each additional worker hired after 
the third worker causes production to increase by a smaller amount than did 
the hiring of the previous worker. In panel (b), the marginal product of labor 
is the additional output produced as a result of hiring one more worker. The

tion and division of labor, and then it falls due to the effects of diminishing

Adam Smith’s Famous Account  
of the Division of Labor  
in a Pin Factory
In The Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith uses production in a pin 
factory as an example of the gains in output resulting from the division of labor. The fol-
lowing is an excerpt from his account of how pin making was divided into a series of tasks:
One man draws out the wire, another straightens it, a third cuts it, a fourth 
points it, a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving the head; to make the head 
requires two or three distinct operations; to put it on is a [distinct  operation], 
to whiten the pins is another; it is even a trade by itself to put them into the 
paper; and the important business of making a pin is, in this manner, divided 
into eighteen distinct operations.
Because the labor of pin making was divided up in this way, the average worker was able 
to produce about 4,800 pins per day. Smith speculated that a single worker using the 
pin-making machinery alone would make only about 20 pins per day. This lesson from 
more than 225 years ago, showing the tremendous gains from division of labor and spe-
cialization, remains relevant to most business situations today.

Making  
the 
Connection
The gains from division of labor 
and specialization are as important 
to firms today as they were in the 
eighteenth century, when Adam 
Smith first discussed them.
The Relationship between Marginal Product 
and Average Product
The marginal product of labor tells us how much total output changes as the quantity 
of workers hired changes. We can also calculate how many pizzas workers produce on 
average. The average product of labor is the total output produced by a firm divided by 
the quantity of workers. For example, using the numbers in Table 11.3 on page 359, if 
Jill hires 4 workers to produce 600 pizzas, the average product of labor is 600>4 = 150.
We can state the relationship between the marginal and average products of labor 
this way: The average product of labor is the average of the marginal products of labor. 
For example, the numbers from Table 11.3 show that the marginal product of the first 
worker Jill hires is 200, the marginal product of the second worker is 250, and the mar-
ginal product of the third worker is 100. Therefore, the average product of labor for 
three workers is 183.3:

output produced by a firm divided by 
the quantity of workers.

362 
C H A P T E R  1 1  Technology, Production, and Costs 
By taking the average of the marginal products of the first three workers, we have the 
average product of the three workers.
Whenever the marginal product of labor is greater than the average product of la-
bor, the average product of labor must be increasing. This statement is true for the same 
reason that a person 6 feet, 2 inches tall entering a room where the average height is 5 
feet, 9 inches raises the average height of people in the room. Whenever the marginal 
product of labor is less than the average product of labor, the average product of labor 
must be decreasing. The marginal product of labor equals the average product of labor 
for the quantity of workers where the average product of labor is at its maximum.
An Example of Marginal and Average Values: 
College Grades
The relationship between the marginal product of labor and the average product of labor 
is the same as the relationship between the marginal and average values of any variable. To 
see this more clearly, think about the familiar relationship between a student’s grade point 
 average (GPA) in one semester and his overall, or cumulative, GPA. The table in Figure 11.3  
shows Paul’s college grades for each semester, beginning with fall 2012. The graph in

Marginal and Average GPAs
The relationship between marginal and av-
erage values for a variable can be illustrated 
using GPAs. We can calculate the GPA Paul 
earns in a particular semester (his “marginal 
GPA”), and we can calculate his cumulative 
GPA for all the semesters he has completed 
so far (his “average GPA”). Paul’s GPA is only 
1.50 in the fall semester of his first year. In 
each following semester through the fall of 
his junior year, his GPA for the semester 
increases—raising his cumulative GPA. In 
Paul’s junior year, even though his semester 
GPA declines from fall to spring, his cumu-
lative GPA rises. Only in the fall of his senior 
year, when his semester GPA drops below 
his cumulative GPA, does his cumulative 
GPA decline.

The Relationship between Short-Run Production and Short-Run Cost 
363
Figure 11.3 plots the grades from the table. Just as each additional worker hired adds to a 
firm’s total production, each additional semester adds to Paul’s total grade point average. We 
can calculate what each individual worker hired adds to total production (marginal product), 
and we can calculate the average production of the workers hired so far (average product).
Similarly, we can calculate the GPA Paul earns in a particular semester (his “mar-
ginal GPA”), and we can calculate his cumulative GPA for all the semesters he has com-
pleted so far (his “average GPA”). As the table shows, Paul gets off to a weak start in the 
fall semester of his first year, earning only a 1.50 GPA. In each subsequent semester 
through the fall of his junior year, his GPA for the semester increases from the previous 
semester—raising his cumulative GPA. As the graph shows, however, his cumulative 
GPA does not increase as rapidly as his semester-by-semester GPA because his cumula-
tive GPA is held back by the low GPAs of his first few semesters. Notice that in Paul’s 
junior year, even though his semester GPA declines from fall to spring, his cumulative 
GPA rises. Only in the fall of his senior year, when his semester GPA drops below his 
cumulative GPA, does his cumulative GPA decline.
The Relationship between Short-Run 
Production and Short-Run Cost
We have seen that technology determines the values of the marginal product of labor 
and the average product of labor. In turn, the marginal and average products of labor 
 affect the firm’s costs. Keep in mind that the relationships we are discussing are short-
run relationships: We are assuming that the time period is too short for the firm to 
change its technology or the size of its physical plant.
At the beginning of this chapter, we saw how Akio Morita used an average total cost 
curve to determine the price of radios. The average total cost curve Morita used and the aver-
age total cost curve in panel (b) of  Figure 11.1 on page 358 for Jill Johnson’s restaurant both 
have a U shape. As we will soon see, the U shape of the average total cost curve is determined 
by the shape of the curve that shows the relationship between marginal cost and the level of 
production.
Marginal Cost
As we saw in Chapter 1, one of the key ideas in economics is that optimal decisions are made 
at the margin. Consumers, firms, and government officials usually make decisions about 
 doing a little more or a little less. As Jill Johnson considers whether to hire additional workers 
to produce additional pizzas, she needs to consider how much she will add to her total cost by 
producing the additional pizzas. Marginal cost is the change in a firm’s total cost from pro-
ducing one more unit of a good or service. We can calculate marginal cost for a particular in-
crease in output by dividing the change in total cost by the change in output. We can express 
this idea mathematically (remembering that the Greek letter delta, Δ, means “change in”):
MC = DTC
DQ .
In the table in Figure 11.4, we use this equation to calculate Jill’s marginal cost of pro-
ducing pizzas. The other values in the table are from Table 11.2 on page 357 and Table 
11.3 on page 359.
Why Are the Marginal and Average  
Cost Curves U Shaped?
Notice in the graph in Figure 11.4 that Jill’s marginal cost of producing pizzas  declines 
at first and then increases, giving the marginal cost curve a U shape. The table in 
 Figure 11.4 also shows the marginal product of labor. This table helps us understand 
the important relationship between the marginal product of labor and the marginal cost 
of production: The marginal product of labor is rising for the first two workers, but the 
11.4 LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Marginal cost The change in a firm’s 
total cost from producing one more 
unit of a good or service.

364 
C H A P T E R  1 1  Technology, Production, and Costs 
marginal cost of the pizzas produced by these workers is falling. The marginal product 
of labor is falling for the last four workers, but the marginal cost of pizzas produced by 
these workers is rising. To summarize this point: When the marginal product of labor is 
rising, the marginal cost of output is falling. When the marginal product of labor is falling, 
the marginal cost of production is rising.
One way to understand why this point is true is first to notice that the only ad-
ditional cost to Jill from producing more pizzas is the additional wages she pays to hire 
more workers. She pays each new worker the same $650 per week. So the marginal cost 
of the additional pizzas each worker makes depends on that worker’s additional output, 
or marginal product. As long as the additional output from each new worker is rising, 
the marginal cost of that output is falling. When the additional output from each new 
worker is falling, the marginal cost of that output is rising. We can conclude that the 
marginal cost of production falls and then rises—forming a U shape—because the mar-
ginal product of labor rises and then falls.
The relationship between marginal cost and average total cost follows the usual re-
lationship between marginal and average values. As long as marginal cost is below aver-
age total cost, average total cost falls. When marginal cost is above average total cost, 
average total cost rises. Marginal cost equals average total cost when average total cost 
is at its lowest point. Therefore, the average total cost curve has a U shape because the 
marginal cost curve has a U shape.

Figure 11.4 
Jill Johnson’s Marginal Cost 
and Average Total Cost of 
Producing Pizzas
We can use the information in the table to 
calculate Jill’s marginal cost and average 
total cost of producing pizzas. For the first 
two workers hired, the marginal product 
of labor is increasing. This increase causes 
the marginal cost of production to fall. For 
the last four workers hired, the marginal 
product of labor is falling. This causes the 
marginal cost of production to increase. 
Therefore, the marginal cost curve falls and 
then rises—that is, has a U shape—because 
the marginal product of labor rises and then 
falls. As long as marginal cost is below aver-
age total cost, average total cost will be fall-
ing. When marginal cost is above average 
total cost, average total cost will be rising. 
The relationship between marginal cost and 
average total cost explains why the average 
total cost curve also has a U shape.

Solving the Problem
Step 1: Review the chapter material. This problem requires you to understand 
 definitions of costs, so you may want to review the section “The Difference 
between Fixed Costs and Variable Costs” on page 355, and the section “Why 
Are the Marginal and Average Cost Curves U Shaped?” which begins on 
page 363.
Step 2: Answer part a. by using the definitions of costs. Santiago’s fixed costs are the 
costs he pays to lease the copy machines. He uses two copy machines and pays 
$12.50 each to lease them, so his fixed cost is $25. Santiago’s variable costs are 
the costs he pays to hire workers. He pays $50 per worker per day. His total cost 
is the sum of his fixed cost and his variable cost. His average total cost is his 
total cost divided by the quantity of copies he produces that day. His marginal 
cost is the change in total cost divided by the change in output. So, for example, 
his marginal cost of producing 1,325 copies per day, rather than 625 copies, is:
MC = 1+125 - +752>11,325 - 6252 = +0.07.

Calculating Marginal Cost

Santiago Delgado owns a copier store. He leases two copy 
machines for which he pays $12.50 each per day. He cannot 
increase the number of machines he leases without giving 
the office machine company six weeks’ notice. He can hire as 
many workers as he wants, at a cost of $50 per day per worker. 
These are the only two inputs he uses to produce copies.

Graphing Cost Curves
We have seen that we calculate average total cost by dividing total cost by the quantity of 
output produced. Similarly, we can calculate average fixed cost by dividing fixed cost by 
the quantity of output produced. And we can calculate average variable cost by divid-
ing variable cost by the quantity of output produced. Or, mathematically, with Q being 
the level of output, we have:
Average total cost = ATC = TC
Q
Average fixed cost = AFC = FC
Q
Average variable cost = AVC = VC
Q .
Finally, notice that average total cost is the sum of average fixed cost plus average 
 variable cost:
ATC = AFC + AVC.
The only fixed cost Jill incurs in operating her restaurant is the $800 per week she 
pays on the bank loan for her pizza ovens. Her variable costs are the wages she pays her 
workers. The table and graph in Figure 11.5 show Jill’s costs.
We will use graphs like the one in Figure 11.5 in the next several chapters to analyze 
how firms decide the level of output to produce and the price to charge. Before going 
further, be sure you understand the following three key facts about Figure 11.5:
 1. The marginal cost (MC), average total cost (ATC), and average variable cost (AVC) 
curves are all U shaped, and the marginal cost curve intersects the average variable

cost curve and average total cost curve at their minimum points. When marginal 
cost is less than either average variable cost or average total cost, it causes them to 
decrease. When marginal cost is above average variable cost or average total cost, it 
causes them to increase. Therefore, when marginal cost equals average variable cost 
or average total cost, they must be at their minimum points.
 2. As output increases, average fixed cost gets smaller and smaller. This happens be-
cause in calculating average fixed cost, we are dividing something that gets larger 
and larger—output—into something that remains constant—fixed cost. Firms often 
refer to this process of lowering average fixed cost by selling more output as “spread-
ing the overhead” (where “overhead” refers to fixed costs).
 3. As output increases, the difference between average total cost and average vari-
able cost decreases. This happens because the difference between average total 
cost and average variable cost is average fixed cost, which gets smaller as output 
increases.

Costs at Jill Johnson’s 
Restaurant
Jill’s costs of making pizzas are shown in 
the table and plotted in the graph. Notice 
three important facts about the graph:  
(1) The marginal cost (MC), average to-
tal cost (ATC), and average variable cost 
(AVC) curves are all U shaped, and the 
marginal cost curve intersects both the av-
erage variable cost curve and average total 
cost curve at their minimum points. (2) As 
output increases, average fixed cost (AFC) 
gets smaller and smaller. (3) As output in-
creases, the difference between average total 
cost and average variable cost decreases. 
Make sure you can explain why each of these 
three facts is true. You should spend time 
becoming familiar with this graph because 
it is one of the most important graphs in 
microeconomics.

Costs in the Long Run
The distinction between fixed cost and variable cost that we just discussed applies to 
the short run but not to the long run. For example, in the short run, Jill Johnson has 
fixed costs of $800 per week because she signed a loan agreement with a bank when she 
bought her pizza ovens. In the long run, the cost of purchasing more pizza ovens be-
comes variable because Jill can choose whether to expand her business by buying more 
ovens. The same would be true of any other fixed costs a company like Jill’s might have. 
Once a company has purchased a fire insurance policy, the cost of the policy is fixed. 
But when the policy expires, the company must decide whether to renew it, and the cost 
becomes variable. The important point here is this: In the long run, all costs are variable. 
There are no fixed costs in the long run. In other words, in the long run, total cost equals 
variable cost, and average total cost equals average variable cost.
Managers of successful firms simultaneously consider how they can most profitably 
run their current store, factory, or office and also whether in the long run they would be 
more profitable if they became larger or, possibly, smaller. Jill must consider how to run 
her current restaurant, which has only two pizza ovens, and she must also plan what to 
do when her current bank loan is paid off and the lease on her store ends. Should she 
buy more pizza ovens? Should she lease a larger restaurant?
Economies of Scale
Short-run average cost curves represent the costs a firm faces when some input, such as 
the quantity of machines it uses, is fixed. The long-run average cost curve shows the 
lowest cost at which a firm is able to produce a given quantity of output in the long run, 
when no inputs are fixed. A firm may experience economies of scale, which means the 
firm’s long-run average costs fall as it increases the quantity of output it produces. We 
can see the effects of economies of scale in Figure 11.6, which shows the relationship be-
tween short-run and long-run average cost curves. Managers can use long-run average 
cost curves for planning because they show the effect on cost of expanding output by, 
for example, building a larger factory or store.

The Relationship between

If a small bookstore expects to sell only 
1,000 books per month, then it will be able 
to sell that quantity of books at the lowest 
average cost of $22 per book if it builds the 
small store represented by the ATC curve on 
the left of the figure. A larger bookstore will 
be able to sell 20,000 books per month at a 
lower cost of $18 per book. A bookstore sell-
ing 20,000 books per month and a bookstore 
selling 40,000 books per month will expe-
rience constant returns to scale and have 
the same average cost. A bookstore selling 
20,000 books per month will have reached 
minimum efficient scale. Very large book-
stores will experience diseconomies of scale, 
and their average costs will rise as sales in-
crease beyond 40,000 books per month.

 
Costs in the Long Run 
369
Long-Run Average Cost Curves  
for Bookstores
Figure 11.6 shows long-run average cost in the retail bookstore industry. If a small 
bookstore expects to sell only 1,000 books per month, then it will be able to sell that 
quantity of books at the lowest average cost of $22 per book if it builds the small store 
represented by the ATC curve on the left of the figure. A much larger bookstore, such 
as one run by a national chain like Barnes & Noble, will be able to sell 20,000 books per 
month at a lower average cost of $18 per book. This decline in average cost from $22 to 
$18 represents the economies of scale that exist in bookselling. Why would the larger 
bookstore have lower average costs? One important reason is that the Barnes & Noble 
store is selling 20 times as many books per month as the small store but might need only 
six times as many workers. This saving in labor cost would reduce Barnes & Noble’s av-
erage cost of selling books.
Firms may experience economies of scale for several reasons. First, as in the case of 
Barnes & Noble, the firm’s technology may make it possible to increase production with 
a smaller proportional increase in at least one input. Second, both workers and manag-
ers can become more specialized, enabling them to become more productive, as output 
expands. Third, large firms, like Barnes & Noble, Wal-Mart, and General Motors, may 
be able to purchase inputs at lower costs than smaller competitors. In fact, as Wal-Mart 
expanded, its bargaining power with its suppliers increased, and its average costs fell. Fi-
nally, as a firm expands, it may be able to borrow money at a lower interest rate, thereby 
lowering its costs.
Economies of scale do not continue forever. The long-run average cost curve in 
most industries has a flat segment that often stretches over a substantial range of out-
put. As Figure 11.6 shows, a bookstore selling 20,000 books per month and a bookstore 
selling 40,000 books per month have the same average cost. Over this range of output, 
firms in the industry experience constant returns to scale. As these firms increase their 
output, they have to increase their inputs, such as the size of the store and the quantity 
of workers, proportionally. The level of output at which all economies of scale are ex-
hausted is known as minimum efficient scale. A bookstore selling 20,000 books per 
month has reached minimum efficient scale.
Very large bookstores experience increasing average costs as managers begin to 
have difficulty coordinating the operation of the store. Figure 11.6 shows that for sales 
above 40,000 books per month, firms in the industry experience diseconomies of 
scale. Firms in the auto industry can also experience diseconomies of scale. For in-
stance, Toyota found that as it expanded production at its Georgetown, Kentucky, plant 
and its plants in China, its managers had difficulty keeping average cost from rising. 
The president of Toyota’s Georgetown plant was quoted as saying, “Demand for . . . 
high volumes saps your energy. Over a period of time, it eroded our focus . . . [and] 
thinned out the expertise and knowledge we painstakingly built up over the years.” 
One analysis of the problems Toyota faced in expanding production concluded: “It is 
the kind of paradox many highly successful companies face: Getting bigger doesn’t al-
ways mean getting better.”
Constant returns to scale The 
situation in which a firm’s long-run 
average costs remain unchanged as it 
increases output.
Minimum efficient scale The level of 
output at which all economies of scale 
are exhausted.
Diseconomies of scale The situation 
in which a firm’s long-run average 
costs rise as the firm increases output.
Solved Problem 11.6
Using Long-Run Average Cost Curves  
to Understand Business Strategy
In 2011, the port of Rotterdam in the Netherlands was in the 
process of expanding its capacity from 9.7 million contain-
ers processed per year to 18.2 million containers processed 
per year. An article in the Wall Street Journal described the 
port as attempting to “provide economies of scale to ship-
pers.” Shippers using the port expected that the fees charged 
to process their containers would decline following the 
expansion.

370 
C H A P T E R  1 1  Technology, Production, and Costs 
Solving the Problem
Step 1: Review the chapter material. This problem is about the long-run average 
cost curve, so you may want to review the material in the section “Costs in the 
Long Run,” which begins on page 368.
Step 2: Answer part a. by explaining what it means for the port to “provide econo-
mies of scale to shippers.” If by expanding, the port of Rotterdam will lower 
its average cost of processing a shipping container, then the port was operat-
ing at less than minimum efficient scale. In that case, the expansion of the 
port would provide economies of scale to shippers by lowering the average

Step 4: Use your graph to explain why the expansion of the port might re-
sult in lower fees to shippers. Before the expansion, the port was below 
 minimum efficient scale and was processing 9.7 million containers per year, 
at an  average cost of Average costA. By expanding, the port can move to the 
 minimum efficient scale of 18.2 million containers per year, and average 
cost falls to Average costB. (We can’t be sure whether the expansion will ac-
tually take the port to minimum efficient scale, but it seems likely that the 
engineers and economists advising the port’s managers would suggest an 
expansion that would raise capacity to that level.) With lower costs, the port 
may reduce the fees that they charge shippers, which is what shippers were 
expecting.

Costs in the Long Run 
371
Over time, most firms in an industry will build factories or stores that are at least 
as large as the minimum efficient scale but not so large that diseconomies of scale oc-
cur. In the bookstore industry, stores will sell between 20,000 and 40,000 books per 
month. However, firms often do not know the exact shape of their long-run average 
cost curves. As a result, they may mistakenly build factories or stores that are either too 
large or too small.
The Colossal River Rouge: 
Diseconomies of Scale at Ford Motor 
Company
When Henry Ford started the Ford Motor Company in 1903, 
automobile companies produced cars in small workshops, using highly skilled work-
ers. Ford introduced two new ideas that allowed him to take advantage of economies 
of scale. First, Ford used identical—or, interchangeable—parts so that unskilled work-
ers could assemble the cars. Second, instead of having groups of workers moving from 
one stationary automobile to the next, he had the workers remain stationary, while the 
automobiles moved along an assembly line. Ford built a large factory at Highland Park, 
outside Detroit, where he used these ideas to produce the famous Model T at an aver-
age cost well below what his competitors could match using older production methods 
in smaller factories.
Ford believed that he could produce automobiles at an even lower average cost 
by building a still larger plant along the River Rouge in Dearborn, Michigan. Unfor-
tunately, Ford’s River Rouge plant was too large and suffered from diseconomies of 
scale. Ford’s managers had great difficulty coordinating the production of automo-
biles in such a large plant. The following description of the River Rouge comes from 
a biography of Ford by Allan Nevins and Frank Ernest Hill:
A total of 93 separate structures stood on the [River Rouge] site. . . . Railroad 
trackage covered 93 miles, conveyors 27 [miles]. About 75,000 men worked 
in the great plant. A force of 5000 did nothing but keep it clean, wearing 
out 5000 mops and 3000 brooms a month, and using 86 tons of soap on 
the floors, walls, and 330 acres of windows. The Rouge was an industrial 
city, immense, concentrated, packed with power. . . . By its very massiveness 
and complexity, it denied men at the top contact with and understanding 
of those beneath, and gave those beneath a sense of being lost in inexorable 
 immensity and power.
Beginning in 1927, Ford produced the Model A—its only car model at that time—at 
the River Rouge plant. Ford failed to achieve economies of scale and actually lost money 
on each of the four Model A body styles.
Ford could not raise the price of the Model A to make it profitable because at a 
higher price, the car could not compete with similar models produced by competitors 
such as General Motors and Chrysler. He eventually reduced the cost of making the 
Model A by constructing smaller factories spread out across the country. These smaller 
factories produced the Model A at a lower average cost than was possible at the River 
Rouge plant.

Don’t Confuse Diminishing Returns  
with Diseconomies of Scale
The concepts of diminishing returns and diseconomies of 
scale may seem similar, but, in fact, they are unrelated. Di-
minishing returns applies only to the short run, when at 
least one of the firm’s inputs, such as the quantity of ma-
chinery it uses, is fixed. The law of diminishing returns 
tells us that in the short run, hiring more workers will, at 
some point, result in less additional output. Diminish-
ing returns explains why marginal cost curves eventually 
slope upward. Diseconomies of scale apply only in the 
long run, when the firm is free to vary all its inputs, can 
adopt new technology, and can vary the amount of ma-
chinery it uses and the size of its facility. Diseconomies of 
scale explain why long-run average cost curves eventually 
slope upward.

Economics in Your Life
Using Cost Concepts in Your Own Business
At the beginning of the chapter, we asked you to suppose that you are about to open a store to 
sell recliners. Both you and a competing store, Bob’s Big Chairs, can buy recliners from the manu-
facturer for $300 each. But because Bob’s sells more recliners per month than you expect to be 
able to sell, his costs per recliner are lower than yours. We asked you to think about why this might 
be true. In this chapter, we have seen that firms often experience declining average costs as the 
quantity they sell increases. A key reason Bob’s average costs might be lower than yours has to 
do with fixed costs. Because your store is the same size as Bob’s store, you may be paying about 
the same amount to lease the store space. You may also be paying about the same amounts for 
utilities, insurance, and advertising. All these are fixed costs because they do not change as the 
quantity of recliners you sell changes. Because Bob’s fixed costs are the same as yours, but he is 
selling more recliners, his average fixed costs are lower than yours, and, therefore, so are his aver-
age total costs. With lower average total costs, he can sell his recliners for a lower price than you 
do and still make a profit.

Conclusion
In this chapter, we discussed the relationship between a firm’s technology, production, 
and costs. In the discussion, we encountered a number of definitions of costs. Because 
we will use these definitions in later chapters, it is useful to bring them together in 
 Table 11.4 for you to review.
We have seen the important relationship between a firm’s level of production and its 
costs. Just as this information was vital to Akio Morita in deciding what price to charge 
for his transistor radios, so it remains vital today to all firms as they attempt to decide 
the optimal level of production and the optimal prices to charge for their products. We 
will explore this point further in Chapter 12. Before moving on to that chapter, read An 
Inside Look at Policy on the next page to see how federal subsidies have helped a tech-
nology firm lower production costs for solar panels.

cost of photovoltaic solar cells,” said 
 Energy Secretary Steven Chu. “As 
global demand for solar cells increase, 
this kind of technology will help the 
US increase its market share.”
For 1366 Technologies—the 
company is named for the amount of 
energy in watts that strikes the earth’s 
atmosphere per square meter—the 
DOE’s vote of confidence is a big deal. 
The company, started in 2007 on the 
idea of MIT professor Emanuel Sachs, 
will now finally be able to demon-
strate in production a technology that 
company officials say could vault the 
US to technological leadership in the 
manufacturing of solar cells.
Using an innovative process, the 
company plans to cast silicon wafers 
for solar panels directly from the mol-
ten output of an industrial furnace—
rather than cut ingots of pure silicon 
with a special saw. That change alone 
saves fully half of the high-cost silicon 
usually wasted in that process. In ad-
dition, the company has figured out 
how to coat its wafers with materials 
that boost their efficiency.
“With this loan, 1366 will real-
ize its goal to make solar energy as 
cheap as coal while helping the US 
to reclaim a key part of the silicon 
supply chain and restore the nation’s 
dominance in photovoltaics,” Frank 
van Mierlo, 1366’s president, said in a 
statement.
Part of the plan is not only to man-
ufacture the photovoltaic cells more ef-
ficiently but also to produce at least a 
three percentage point gain in the solar 
cells’ output. Their goal is to reduce the 
cost of manufacturing a photovoltaic 
cell to less than $1 per watt.
CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR
US boosts ‘ game-
changer’ solar 
technology in bid for 
global market share 
Solar power as cheap as coal, that’s the 
holy grail of the solar power industry.
It’s an elusive goal that has more 
than a few skeptics saying solar—no 
matter how much advocates pump it—
will always remain the energy source 
of the future, and not the present.
“They’re always just five years 
off no matter what year it is, in order 
to justify continued subsidies,” said a 
Wall Street Journal editorial last July, 
referring to photovoltaic and other 
renewable energy sources. Solar is “a 
speculative and immature technol-
ogy that costs far more than ordinary 
power.”
But the US Department of En-
ergy isn’t buying that—just the oppo-
site. In the past two years the Energy 
Department has offered over $12 bil-
lion in loan guarantees for 16 solar 
projects—about two thirds of the re-
cipients are power plants, the rest are 
solar manufacturers—with stimulus 
funds from the 2009 American Re-
covery and Reinvestment Act.
Friday the DOE once again ham-
mered home its view that solar’s 
promise is real, with a $150 million 
loan guarantee to 1366 Technologies, 
a  Lexington, Mass.-based solar wafer 
manufacturing company that has a 
great new technology—but no manu-
facturing plant. Now it will.
“This project is a game-changer 
that could dramatically lower the 
New Technology Could Lower  
the Cost of Solar Panels
With the federal loan guarantee, 
the company is already scouting for 
a site for its first production plant, 
which it hopes will be manufactur-
ing 200 megawatts of wafers annually 
by 2013. Right on the heels of that, it 
plans to build another facility capable 
of producing a 1,000 megawatts of 
wafers per year.
Solar power advocates say there 
are signs that the industry is on track 
to be competitive, though costs still 
need to be cut.
“There’s tremendous progress be-
ing made in the solar power industry 
with costs of photovoltaics coming 
down dramatically,” says Robert Mar-
golis, a senior energy analyst for the 
National Renewable Energy Labora-
tory. “Solar module [panel] prices are 
dropping rapidly this year—about 10–
20 percent already this year—and ex-
pected to continue dropping rapidly.”
For solar power to compete with-
out subsidies with coal, the Depart-
ment of Energy says, the installed cost 
of solar energy modules needs to drop 
another 75 percent.
At the current rates of declin-
ing cost, the DOE and others project, 
solar will be competitive with coal in 
2020.
At that point, the DOE website 
says, there will be “rapid, large-scale 
adoption of solar electricity across the 
United States . . . .”

for solar energy products should be further 
stimulated as more consumers and busi-
nesses become willing to use solar power to 
meet all or part of their energy needs. Ac-
cording to the Department of Energy, the in-
stalled cost of solar energy panels needs to 
fall by an additional 75 percent before solar 
power can compete without subsidies 
against electricity generated by coal.
Thinking Critically
1. Suppose that 1366 Technologies can 
produce 200,000 solar wafers per year 
at lowest average total cost if it builds 
a 10,000 square foot factory. Also sup-
pose that the firm can produce 400,000 
solar wafers per year at lowest average 
total cost if it builds a 15,000 square 
foot factory. Draw a graph showing the 
average total cost curves represent-
ing these two factories. In drawing the 
graph, assume that 1366 Technologies 
experiences economies of scale over 
this range of output.
2. 1366 Technologies is the first manufac-
turer to cast silicon wafers for solar pan-
els directly from the molten output of an 
industrial furnace. How might being the 
first in the market to use this technology 
be an advantage to 1366 Technologies? 
How might it be a risk?
the initial quantity produced by the manufac-
turer is relatively low. The manufacturer can 
lower its average total cost (ATCA to ATCB) 
by increasing production (QA to QB), but it will 
likely have to decrease the selling price to be 
able to sell the higher production quantity. 
Solar panel manufacturers are taking a risk 
by increasing production in an attempt to re-
alize economies of scale because they have 
no guarantee of being able to charge a price 
that is low enough to sell the higher quantity 
and still high enough to be profitable.
b Massachusetts-based 1366 Technolo-
gies has developed technologies to sig-
nificantly decrease the cost of producing 
the photovoltaic cells used in the produc-
tion of solar panels and to also increase 
their efficiency. The company believes these 
advances will result in more powerful solar 
panels being produced at a lower cost than 
those currently available in the market. This 
company would realize economies of scale 
by increasing production to lower its aver-
age total cost and charging a price low 
enough to sell the larger quantity. 
c Federal subsidies have helped to lower 
production costs for solar power indus-
tries in the United States and have allowed 
domestic manufacturers to become more 
competitive in the global market, but solar 
advocates acknowledge that costs need to 
continue to fall. As costs decline, the market 
Key Points in the Article
A company called 1366 Technologies has 
developed new technologies to manufac-
ture solar cells. A loan guarantee from the 
U.S. Department of Energy will allow 1366 
Technologies to build a plant where it can 
produce photovoltaic solar cells and in-
crease its share of the global solar energy 
market. The solar power industry is becom-
ing more competitive as costs decline, but 
costs must fall even further for the industry 
to compete with more traditional energy 
sources without government subsidies.
Analyzing the News
a Many countries are advocating the use 
of alternative energy sources, but the 
relatively high cost of the inputs needed, 
such as solar panels, has been an obstacle. 
When a product with a new technology is in-
troduced, companies often initially charge 
high selling prices in an attempt to recoup 
what were probably high development costs. 
The high selling prices often limit sales to a 
small number of customers, and the low pro-
duction numbers can make it difficult for a 
company to realize economies of scale. This 
is precisely what occurred when solar panels 
were first introduced to the market. In the fig-
ure below, we see that the average total cost 
of producing solar panels is high because

LEARNING OBJECTIVE: Distinguish between the economic short run and the economic long run.
Summary
In the short run, a firm’s technology and the size of its factory, store, 
or office are fixed. In the long run, a firm is able to adopt new technol-
ogy and to increase or decrease the size of its physical plant. Total cost 
is the cost of all the inputs a firm uses in production. Variable costs 
are costs that change as output changes. Fixed costs are costs that re-
main constant as output changes. Opportunity cost is the highest-
valued alternative that must be given up to engage in an  activity. An 
explicit cost is a cost that involves spending money. An implicit cost 
is a nonmonetary opportunity cost. The relationship  between the 
inputs employed by a firm and the maximum output it can produce 
with those inputs is called the firm’s production function.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE: Understand the relationship between the marginal product of labor and the average 
product of labor.
Summary
The marginal product of labor is the additional output produced by 
a firm as a result of hiring one more worker. Specialization and divi-
sion of labor cause the marginal product of labor to rise for the first 
few workers hired. Eventually, the law of diminishing returns causes 
the marginal product of labor to decline. The average  product of 
labor is the total amount of output produced by a firm divided by 
the quantity of workers hired. When the marginal product of labor 
is greater than the average product of labor, the average product of

LEARNING OBJECTIVE: Explain and illustrate the relationship between marginal cost and average total cost.
Summary
The marginal cost of production is the increase in total cost  resulting 
from producing another unit of output. The marginal cost curve has 
a U shape because when the marginal product of labor is rising, the 
marginal cost of output is falling, and when the marginal product of 
labor is falling, the marginal cost of output is rising. When  marginal 
cost is less than average total cost, average total cost falls. When 
 marginal cost is greater than average total cost, average total cost 
rises. Therefore, average total cost also has a U shape.

3.6 A student looks at the data in Table 11.3 on page 359 and 
draws this conclusion:
The marginal product of labor is increasing 
for the first two workers hired, and then it de-
clines for the next four workers. I guess each 
of the first two workers must have been hard 
workers. Then Jill must have had to settle for 
increasingly poor workers.

4.7 Is Jill Johnson correct when she says the following: “I am 
currently producing 10,000 pizzas per month at a total cost 
of $50,000.00. If I produce 10,001 pizzas, my total cost will 
rise to $50,011.00. Therefore, my marginal cost of produc-
ing pizzas must be increasing.” Draw a graph to illustrate 
your answer.
 
4.8 Is Jill Johnson correct when she says the following: “I am 
currently producing 20,000 pizzas per month at a total cost 
of $75,000. If I produce 20,001 pizzas, my total cost will rise 
to $75,002. Therefore, my marginal cost of producing pizzas 
must be increasing.” Illustrate your answer with a graph.
 
4.9 (This problem is somewhat advanced.) Using symbols, 
we can write that the marginal product of labor is equal 
to DQ>DL. Marginal cost is equal to DTC>DQ. Because 
fixed costs by definition don’t change, marginal cost is also 
equal to DVC>DQ. If Jill Johnson’s only variable cost (VC) 
is labor cost, then her variable cost is just the wage multi-
plied by the quantity of workers hired, or wL.
 
a. If the wage Jill pays is constant, then what is DVC in 
terms of w and L?
 
b. Use your answer to question a. and the expressions 
given above for the marginal product of labor and the 
marginal cost of output to find an expression for mar-
ginal cost, DTC/DQ, in terms of the wage, w, and the 
marginal product of labor, DQ>DL.
 
 c. Use your answer to question b. to determine Jill’s mar-
ginal cost of producing pizzas if the wage is $750 per 
week and the marginal product of labor is 150 pizzas. If 
the wage falls to $600 per week and the marginal prod-
uct of labor is unchanged, what happens to Jill’s mar-
ginal cost? If the wage is unchanged at $750 per week 
and the marginal product of labor rises to 250 pizzas, 
what happens to Jill’s marginal cost?

LEARNING OBJECTIVE: Understand how firms use the long-run average cost curve in their planning.
 
 Another scholar points out that a significant fixed cost was 
involved in producing a codex:
In order to copy a codex . . . the amount of text 
and the layout of each page had to be carefully cal-
culated in advance to determine the exact number 
of sheets . . . needed. No doubt, this is more time-
consuming and calls for more experimentation 
than the production of a scroll would. But for the 
next copy, these calculations would be used again.
 
a. Suppose that the fixed cost of preparing a codex was 
58 drachmas and that there was no similar fixed cost 
for a scroll. Would an ancient book publisher who in-
tended to sell 5 copies of a book be likely to publish it 
as a scroll or as a codex? What if he intended to sell  
10 copies? Briefly explain.
 
b. Although most books were published as scrolls in the 
first century a.d., by the third century, most were pub-
lished as codices. Considering only the factors men-
tioned in this problem, explain why this change may 
have taken place.

which makes selling to poor countries infeasible.

6.6 Factories for producing computer chips are called “fabs.” 
As the semiconductors used in computer chips have be-
come smaller and smaller, the machines necessary to make 
them have become more and more expensive. According 
to an article in the Economist magazine:
To reach the economies of scale needed to 
make such investments pay, chipmakers must 
build bigger fabs. . . . In 1966 a new fab cost 
$14 million. By 1995 the price had risen to $1.5 
billion. Today, says Intel, the cost of a leading-
edge fab exceeds $6 billion.

Appendix
Using Isoquants and Isocost Lines to 
Understand Production and Cost
Isoquants
In this chapter, we studied the important relationship between a firm’s level of produc-
tion and its costs. In this appendix, we will look more closely at how firms choose the 
combination of inputs to produce a given level of output. Firms usually have a choice 
about how they will produce their output. For example, Jill Johnson is able to pro-
duce 5,000 pizzas per week by using 10 workers and 2 ovens or by using 6 workers and 
3  ovens. We will see that firms search for the cost-minimizing combination of inputs that 
will allow them to produce a given level of output. The cost-minimizing combination of 
inputs depends on two factors: technology—which determines how much output a firm 
receives from employing a given quantity of inputs—and input prices—which deter-
mine the total cost of each combination of inputs.
An Isoquant Graph
We begin by graphing the levels of output that Jill can produce using different combina-
tions of two inputs: labor—the quantity of workers she hires per week—and capital—the 
quantity of ovens she uses per week. In reality, of course, Jill uses more than just these 
two inputs to produce pizzas, but nothing important would change if we expanded the 
discussion to include many inputs instead of just two. Figure 11A.1 measures capital 
along the vertical axis and labor along the horizontal axis. The curves in the graph are 
isoquants, which show all the combinations of two inputs, in this case capital and labor, 
that will produce the same level of output.
The isoquant labeled Q = 5,000 shows all the combinations of workers and ovens 
that  enable Jill to produce that quantity of pizzas per week. For example, at point A, 
she produces 5,000 pizzas using 6 workers and 3 ovens, and at point B, she produces 
the same  output using 10 workers and 2 ovens. With more workers and ovens, she can

Isoquants
Isoquants show all the combinations of 
two inputs, in this case capital and labor, 
that will produce the same level of out-
put. For example, the isoquant labeled 
Q = 5,000 shows all the combinations 
of ovens and workers that enable Jill to 
produce that quantity of pizzas per week. 
At point A, she produces 5,000 pizzas us-
ing 3 ovens and 6 workers, and at point B, 
she produces the same output using  
2 ovens and 10 workers. With more ovens 
and workers, she can move to a higher 
isoquant. For example, with 4 ovens and 
12 workers, she can produce at point C 
on the isoquant Q = 10,000. With even 
more  ovens and workers, she could move 
to the isoquant Q = 13,000.

move to a higher isoquant. For example, with 12 workers and 4 ovens, she can produce 
at point C on the isoquant Q = 10,000. With even more workers and ovens, she could 
move to the isoquant Q = 13,000. The higher the isoquant—that is, the further to the 
upper right on the graph—the more output the firm produces. Although we have shown 
only three isoquants in this graph, there is, in fact, an isoquant for every level of output.
The Slope of an Isoquant
Remember that the slope of a curve is the ratio of the change in the variable on the 
vertical axis to the change in the variable on the horizontal axis. Along an isoquant, the 
slope tells us the rate at which a firm is able to substitute one input for another while 
keeping the level of output constant. This rate is called the marginal rate of technical 
 substitution (MRTS).
We expect that the MRTS will change as we move down an isoquant. In Fig-
ure 11A.1, at a point like A on isoquant Q = 5,000, the isoquant is relatively steep. As 
we move down the curve, it becomes less steep at a point like B. This shape is the usual 
one for isoquants: They are bowed in, or convex. The reason isoquants have this shape is 
that as we move down the curve, we continue to substitute labor for capital. As the firm 
produces the same quantity of output using less capital, the additional labor it needs 
increases because of diminishing returns. Remember from the chapter that, as a con-
sequence of diminishing returns, for a given decline in capital, increasing amounts of 
labor are necessary to produce the same level of output. Because the MRTS is equal to 
the change in capital divided by the change in labor, it will become smaller (in absolute 
value) as we move down an isoquant.
Isocost Lines
A firm wants to produce a given quantity of output at the lowest possible cost. We can 
show the relationship between the quantity of inputs used and the firm’s total cost by 
using an isocost line. An isocost line shows all the combinations of two inputs, such as 
capital and labor, that have the same total cost.
Graphing the Isocost Line
Suppose that Jill has $6,000 per week to spend on capital and labor. Suppose, to sim-
plify the analysis, that Jill can rent pizza ovens by the week. The table in Figure 11A.2 
shows the combinations of capital and labor available to her if the rental price of ovens is 
$1,000 per week and the wage rate is $500 per week. The graph uses the data in the table 
to construct an isocost line. The isocost line intersects the vertical axis at the maximum 
number of ovens Jill can rent per week, which is shown by point A. The line intersects 
the horizontal axis at the maximum number of workers Jill can hire per week, which is 
point G. As Jill moves down the isocost line from point A, she gives up renting 1 oven 
for every 2 workers she hires. Any combination of inputs along the line or inside the 
line can be purchased with $6,000. Any combination that lies outside the line cannot be 
purchased because it would have a total cost to Jill of more than $6,000.
The Slope and Position of the Isocost Line
The slope of the isocost line is constant and equals the change in the quantity of ovens 
divided by the change in the quantity of workers. In this case, in moving from any point 
on the isocost line to any other point, the change in the quantity of ovens equals −1, 
and the change in the quantity of workers equals 2, so the slope equals −1/2. Notice that 
with a rental price of ovens of $1,000 per week and a wage rate for labor of $500 per 
week, the slope of the isocost line is equal to the ratio of the wage rate divided by the 
Marginal rate of technical 
substitution (MRTS) The rate at 
which a firm is able to substitute one 
input for another while keeping the

rental price of capital, multiplied by -1: - +500>+1,000 = -1>2. In fact, this result will 
 always hold, whatever inputs are involved and whatever their prices may be: The slope of 
the isocost line is equal to the ratio of the price of the input on the horizontal axis divided 
by the price of the input on the vertical axis multiplied by -1.
The position of the isocost line depends on the level of total cost. Higher levels of 
total cost shift the isocost line outward, and lower levels of total cost shift the isocost 
line inward. This can be seen in Figure 11A.3, which shows isocost lines for total costs 
of $3,000, $6,000, and $9,000. We have shown only three isocost lines in the graph, but 
there is, in fact, a different isocost line for each level of total cost.
Figure 11A.2 
An Isocost Line
The isocost line shows the combinations of 
inputs with a total cost of $6,000. The rental 
price of ovens is $1,000 per week, so if Jill 
spends the whole $6,000 on ovens, she can 
rent 6 ovens (point A). The wage rate is $500 
per week, so if Jill spends the whole $6,000 
on workers, she can hire 12 workers. As she 
moves down the isocost line, she gives up 
renting 1 oven for every 2 workers she hires. 
Any combinations of inputs along the line or 
inside the line can be purchased with $6,000. 
Any combinations that lie outside the line 
cannot be purchased with $6,000.

The Position of the Isocost Line
The position of the isocost line depends on 
the level of total cost. As total cost increases 
from $3,000 to $6,000 to $9,000 per week, 
the isocost line shifts outward. For each 
isocost line shown, the rental price of  ovens 
is $1,000 per week, and the wage rate is 
$500 per week.

Choosing the Cost-Minimizing  
Combination of Capital and Labor
Suppose Jill wants to produce 5,000 pizzas per week. Figure 11A.1 shows that there are 
many combinations of ovens and workers that will allow Jill to produce this level of out-
put. There is only one combination of ovens and workers, however, that will allow her to 
produce 5,000 pizzas at the lowest total cost. Figure 11A.4 shows the isoquant Q = 5,000 
along with three isocost lines. Point B is the lowest-cost combination of inputs shown 
in the graph, but this combination of 1 oven and 4 workers will produce fewer than the 
5,000 pizzas needed. Points C and D are combinations of ovens and workers that will 
produce 5,000 pizzas, but their total cost is $9,000. The combination of 3 ovens and 6 
workers at point A produces 5,000 pizzas at the lowest total cost of $6,000.
Figure 11A.4 shows that moving to an isocost line with a total cost of less than 
$6,000 would mean producing fewer than 5,000 pizzas. Being at any point along the iso-
quant Q = 5,000 other than point A would increase total cost above $6,000. In fact, the 
combination of inputs at point A is the only one on isoquant Q = 5,000 that has a total 
cost of $6,000. All other input combinations on this isoquant have higher total costs. 
Notice also that at point A, the isoquant and the isocost lines are tangent, so the slope of 
the isoquant is equal to the slope of the isocost line at that point.
Different Input Price Ratios Lead to Different Input 
Choices
Jill’s cost-minimizing choice of 3 ovens and 6 workers is determined jointly by the tech-
nology available to her—as represented by her firm’s isoquants—and by input prices—as 
represented by her firm’s isocost lines. If the technology of making pizzas changes, per-
haps because new ovens are developed, her isoquants will be affected, and her choice of 
inputs may change. If her isoquants remain unchanged but input prices change, then 
her choice of inputs may also change. This fact can explain why firms in different coun-
tries that face different input prices may produce the same good using different combi-
nations of capital and labor, even though they have the same technology available.
For example, suppose that in China, pizza ovens are higher priced and labor is 
lower priced than in the United States. In our example, Jill Johnson pays $1,000 per 
week to rent pizza ovens and $500 per week to hire workers. Suppose a businessperson 
in China must pay a price of $1,500 per week to rent the identical pizza ovens but can 
hire Chinese workers who are as productive as U.S. workers at a wage of $300 per week.

Choosing Capital and Labor to 
Minimize Total Cost
Jill wants to produce 5,000 pizzas per week 
at the lowest total cost. Point B is the lowest-
cost combination of inputs shown in the 
graph, but this combination of 1 oven and 
4 workers will produce fewer than the 5,000 
pizzas needed. Points C and D are combina-
tions of ovens and workers that will produce 
5,000 pizzas, but their total cost is $9,000. 
The combination of 3 ovens and 6 workers at 
point A produces 5,000 pizzas at the lowest 
total cost of $6,000.

Appendix Using Isoquants and Isocost Lines to Understand Production and Cost 
387
Figure 11A.5 shows how the cost-minimizing input combination for the businessperson 
in China differs from Jill’s.
Remember that the slope of the isocost line equals the wage rate divided by the 
rental price of capital multiplied by 21. The slope of the isocost line that Jill and other 
U.S. firms face is -$500>$1,000, or -1>2. Firms in China, however, face an  isocost line 
with a slope of -$300>$1,500, or -1>5. As Figure 11A.5 shows, the input combination 
at point A, which was optimal for Jill, is not optimal for a firm in China. Using the in-
put combination at point A would cost a firm in China more than $6,000. Instead, the 
Chinese isocost line is tangent to the isoquant at point B, where the input combination 
is 2 ovens and 10 workers. This result makes sense: Because ovens cost more in China, 
but workers cost less, a Chinese firm will use fewer ovens and more workers than a U.S. 
firm, even if it has the same technology as the U.S. firm.

Changing Input Prices Affects 
the Cost-Minimizing Input 
Choice
As the graph shows, the input combination 
at point A, which was optimal for Jill, is not 
optimal for a businessperson in China. Using 
the input combination at point A would cost 
businesspeople in China more than $6,000. 
Instead, the Chinese isocost line is tangent 
to the isoquant at point B, where the input 
combination is 2 ovens and 10 workers. Be-
cause ovens cost more in China but workers 
cost less, a Chinese firm will use fewer ovens 
and more workers than a U.S. firm, even if 
it has the same technology as the U.S. firm.
The Changing Input Mix in Walt Disney 
Film Animation
The inputs used to make feature-length animated films have 
changed dramatically in the past 15 years. Prior to the early 
1990s, the Walt Disney Company dominated the market for animated films. Disney’s films 
were produced using hundreds of animators drawing most of the film by hand. Each film 
would contain as many as 170,000 individual drawings. Then, two developments dramati-
cally affected how animated films are produced. First, in 1994, Disney had a huge hit with 
The Lion King, which cost only $50 million but earned the company more than $1 billion 
in profit. As a result of this success, Disney and other film studios began to produce more 
animated films, increasing the demand for animators and more than doubling their sala-
ries. The second development came in 1995, when Pixar Animation Studios released the 
film Toy Story. This was the first successful feature-length film produced using computers, 
with no hand-drawn animation. In the following years, technological advance continued 
to reduce the cost of the computers and software necessary to produce an animated film.
As a result of these two developments, the price of capital—computers and  software—
fell relative to the price of labor—animators. As the figure shows, the change in the price 
of computers relative to animators changed the slope of the isocost line and resulted in 
film studios now producing animated films using many more computers and many fewer 
animators than in the early 1990s. In 2006, Disney bought Pixar, and within a few years, 
all the major film studios had converted to computer animation, now referred to as CGI 
animation, although a few hand-drawn films, such as Disney’s film Winnie the Pooh re-
leased in 2011, continued to be produced.

Another Look at Cost Minimization
In Chapter 9, we saw that consumers maximize utility when they consume each good 
up to the point where the marginal utility per dollar spent is the same for every good. 
We can derive a very similar cost-minimization rule for firms. Remember that at the 
point of cost minimization, the isoquant and the isocost line are tangent, so they have 
the same slope. Therefore, at the point of cost minimization, the marginal rate of technical 
substitution (MRTS) is equal to the wage rate divided by the rental price of capital.
The slope of the isoquant tells us the rate at which a firm is able to substitute la-
bor for capital, given existing technology. The slope of the isocost line tells us the rate at 
which a firm is able to substitute labor for capital, given current input prices. Only at the 
point of cost minimization are these two rates the same.
When we move from one point on an isoquant to another, we end up using more 
of one input and less of the other input, but the level of output remains the same. For 
example, as Jill moves down an isoquant, she uses fewer ovens and more workers but 
produces the same quantity of pizzas. In this chapter, we defined the marginal product of 
labor (MPL) as the additional output produced by a firm as a result of hiring one more 
worker. Similarly, we can define the marginal product of capital (MPK) as the additional 
output produced by a firm as a result of using one more machine. So, when Jill uses 
fewer ovens by moving down an isoquant, she loses output equal to:
-Change in the quantity of ovens * MPK.
But she uses more workers, so she gains output equal to:
Change in the quantity of workers * MPL.
We know that the gain in output from the additional workers is equal to the loss 
from the smaller quantity of ovens because total output remains the same along an iso-
quant. Therefore, we can write:

Animation,” New York Times, September 18, 2005.

If we rearrange terms, we have the following:
-Change in the quantity of ovens
Change in the quantity of workers = MPL
MPK
.
Because
-Change in the quantity of ovens
Change in the quantity of workers
is the slope of the isoquant, it is equal to the marginal rate of technical substitution 
(multiplied by negative 1). So, we can write:
-Change in the quantity of ovens
Change in the quantity of workers = MRTS = MPL
MPK
.
The slope of the isocost line equals the wage rate (w) divided by the rental price of 
capital (r). We saw earlier in this appendix that at the point of cost minimization, the 
MRTS equals the ratio of the prices of the two inputs. Therefore:
MPL
MPK
= w
r .
We can rewrite this to show that at the point of cost minimization:
MPL
w
= MPK
r .
This last expression tells us that to minimize cost for a given level of output, a firm 
should hire inputs up to the point where the last dollar spent on each input results in 
the same increase in output. If this equality did not hold, a firm could lower its costs by 
using more of one input and less of the other. For example, if the left side of the equation 
were greater than the right side, a firm could rent fewer ovens, hire more workers, and 
produce the same output at lower cost.
Solving the Problem
Step 1:  Review the chapter material. This problem is about determining the optimal 
choice of inputs by comparing the ratios of the marginal products of inputs 
to their prices, so you may want to review the section “Another Look at Cost 
Minimization,” which begins on page 388.
Step 2:  Compute the ratios of marginal product to input price to determine whether 
Jill is minimizing costs. If Jill is minimizing costs, the following relationship 
should hold:
MPL
w
= MPK
r .
Solved Problem 11A.1
Determining the Optimal Combination of Inputs
Consider the information in the following table for Jill 
Johnson’s restaurant.
Briefly explain whether Jill is minimizing costs. If she is 
not minimizing costs, explain whether she should rent more 
ovens and hire fewer workers or rent fewer ovens and hire 
more workers.
Marginal product of capital
3,000 pizzas per oven
Marginal product of labor
1,200 pizzas per worker
Wage rate
$300 per week
Rental price of ovens
$600 per week

390 
C H A P T E R  1 1  Technology, Production, and Costs 
In this case, we have
 MPL = 1,200
 MPK = 3,000
 w = +300
 r = +600.
So
MPL
w
= 1,200
+300 = 4 pizzas per dollar, and  MPK
r
= 3,000
+600 = 5 pizzas per dollar.
Because the two ratios are not equal, Jill is not minimizing cost.
Step 3:  Determine how Jill should change the mix of inputs she uses. Jill produces 
more pizzas per dollar from the last oven than from the last worker. This indi-
cates that she has too many workers and too few ovens. Therefore, to minimize 
cost, Jill should use more ovens and hire fewer workers.

Do National Football League Teams 
Behave Efficiently?
In the National Football League (NFL), the “salary cap” is the 
maximum amount each team can spend in a year on salaries for 
football players. Each year’s salary cap results from negotiations between the league and 
the union representing the players. To achieve efficiency, an NFL team should distribute 
salaries among players so as to maximize the level of output—in this case, winning foot-
ball games—given the constant level of cost represented by the salary cap. (Notice that 
maximizing the level of output for a given level of cost is equivalent to minimizing cost 
for a given level of output. To see why, think about the situation in which an isocost line is 
tangent to an isoquant. At the point of tangency, the firm has simultaneously minimized 
the cost of producing the level of output represented by the isoquant and maximized the 
output produced at the level of cost represented by the isocost line.)
In distributing salaries, teams should equalize the marginal productivity of players, as rep-
resented by their contribution to winning games to the salaries paid. Just as a firm may not use 
a machine that has a very high marginal product if its rental price is very high, a football team 
may not want to hire a superstar player if the salary the team would need to pay is too high.
Economists Cade Massey, of Duke University, and Richard Thaler, of the University 
of Chicago, have analyzed whether NFL teams distribute their salaries efficiently. NFL 
teams obtain their players either by signing free agents—who are players whose contracts 
with other teams have expired—or by signing players chosen in the annual draft of eli-
gible college players. The college draft consists of seven rounds, with the teams with the 
worst records the previous year choosing first. Massey and Thaler find that, in fact, NFL 
teams do not allocate salaries efficiently. In particular, the players chosen with the first 
few picks of the first round of the draft tend to be paid salaries that are much higher 
relative to their marginal products than are players taken later in the first round. A typi-
cal team with a high draft pick would increase its ability to win football games at the 
constant cost represented by the salary cap if it traded for lower draft picks. Why do NFL 
teams apparently make the error of not efficiently distributing salaries? Massey and Tha-
ler argue that general managers of NFL teams tend to be overconfident in their ability to 
forecast how well a college player is likely to perform in the NFL.
General managers of NFL teams are not alone in suffering from overconfidence. 
Studies have shown that, in general, people tend to overestimate their ability to fore-
cast an uncertain outcome. Because NFL teams tend to overestimate the future mar-
ginal productivity of high draft picks, they pay them salaries that are inefficiently high

compared to salaries other draft picks receive. NFL teams were aware that they were 
probably overpaying high draft picks. In 2011, they negotiated a new contract with the 
NFL Players Union that limited the salaries that drafted players could receive.
This example shows that the concepts developed in this chapter provide powerful 
tools for analyzing whether firms are operating efficiently.

The Expansion Path
The tangency points A, B, and C lie along the 
firm’s expansion path, which is a curve that 
shows the cost-minimizing combination of 
inputs for every level of output. In the short 
run, when the quantity of machines is fixed, 
the firm can expand output from 75 book-
cases per day to 100 bookcases per day at the 
lowest cost only by moving from point B to 
point D and increasing the number of work-
ers from 60 to 110. In the long run, when it 
can increase the quantity of machines it uses, 
the firm can move from point D to point C, 
thereby reducing its total costs of producing 
100 bookcases per day from $4,250 to $4,000.
The Expansion Path
We can use isoquants and isocost lines to examine what happens as a firm expands its 
level of output. Figure 11A.6 shows three isoquants for a firm that produces bookcases. 
The isocost lines are drawn under the assumption that the machines used in produc-
ing bookcases can be rented for $100 per day and the wage rate is $25 per day. The 
point where each isoquant is tangent to an isocost line determines the cost-minimizing 
combination of capital and labor for producing that level of output. For example, 10 
machines and 40 workers is the cost-minimizing combination of inputs for produc-
ing 50 bookcases per day. The cost-minimizing points A, B, and C lie along the firm’s 
 expansion path, which is a curve that shows the cost-minimizing combination of in-
puts for every level of output.
An important point to note is that the expansion path represents the least-cost 
combination of inputs to produce a given level of output in the long run, when the firm 
is able to vary the levels of all of its inputs. We know, though, that in the short run, at 
least one input is fixed. We can use Figure 11A.6 to show that as the firm expands in the 
short run, its costs will be higher than in the long run. For example, suppose that the 
firm is currently at point B, using 15 machines and 60 workers to produce 75 bookcases 
per day. The firm wants to expand its output to 100 bookcases per day, but in the short 
run, it is unable to increase the quantity of machines it uses. Therefore, to expand out-
put, it must hire more workers. The figure shows that in the short run, to produce 100 
bookcases per day using 15 machines, the lowest costs it can attain are at point D, where 
it employs 110 workers. With a rental price of machines of $100 per day and a wage 
rate of $25 per day, in the short run, the firm will have total costs of $4,250 to produce 
100 bookcases per day. In the long run, though, the firm can increase the number of 
machines it uses from 15 to 20 and reduce the number of workers from 110 to 80. This

a firm’s cost-minimizing combination

change allows it to move from point D to point C on its expansion path and to lower its 
total costs of producing 100 bookcases per day from $4,250 to $4,000. The firm’s mini-
mum total costs of production are lower in the long run than in the short run.

During the eighteenth century, the American colonies 
had much more land per farmer than did Europe. As a 
result, the price of labor in the colonies was much higher 
relative to the price of land than it was in Europe. As-
sume that Europe and the colonies had access to the 
same technology for producing food. Use an isoquant–
isocost line graph to illustrate why the combination of 
land and labor used in producing food in the colonies 
would have been different from the combination used to 
produce food in Europe.

Economics in Your Life
Are You an Entrepreneur?
Were you an entrepreneur during your high school years? Perhaps you didn’t have your own store, 
but you may have worked as a babysitter, or perhaps you mowed lawns for families in your neigh-
borhood. While you may not think of these jobs as being small businesses, that is exactly what they 
are. How did you decide what price to charge for your services? You may have wanted to charge 
$25 per hour to babysit or mow lawns, but you probably charged much less. As you read the chap-
ter, think about the competitive situation you faced as a teenage entrepreneur and try to deter-
mine why the prices received by most people who babysit and mow lawns are so low. You can check 
your answers against those we provide on page 420 at the end of this chapter.
Many farmers have found that the profits 
they earn from selling in farmers’ markets is 
no longer higher than what they earn selling 
to supermarkets.
The process of new firms entering a 
profitable market and driving down prices 
and profits is not unique to agriculture. 
Throughout the economy, entrepreneurs 
are continually introducing new products or 
new ways of selling products, which—when 
successful—enable them to earn economic 
profits in the short run. But in the long run, 
competition among firms forces prices to 
the level where they just cover the costs of 
production. This process of competition is 
at the heart of the market system and is the 
focus of this chapter.
AN INSIDE LOOK on page 422 dis-
cusses the steady decline in production and 
sales of organic food in the United King-
dom after 2008.
Based on Katie Zezima, “As Farmers’ Markets Go Main-
stream, Some Fear a Glut,” New York Times, August 20, 
2011; and Steve Martinez, et al., Local Food Systems:  
Concepts, Impacts, and Issues, U.S. Department of 
 Agriculture Economic Research Report Number 97, 
May 2010.
In recent years, the demand for healthier 
foods has increased. Sales of organically 
grown food have increased at a rate of 20 
percent per year. Many people have also 
begun buying their fruits and vegetables at 
farmers’ markets. At these markets, local 
farmers come together at a fairground, a 
city plaza, or some other open space to sell 
their produce directly to consumers. The 
advantage to farmers is that they can receive 
a higher price than they would if they sold 
their produce to supermarkets. Many con-
sumers prefer to buy from farmers’ markets 
because they believe the produce is fresher, 
of higher quality, and healthier or because 
they want to support local farmers.
Because the profits have been higher, 
increasing numbers of farmers have begun 
participating in farmers’ markets. In 2005, 
there were 4,093 farmers’ markets in the 
United States. By 2011, the number had in-
creased to 7,175. The additional supply of 
produce, though, has forced down prices 
and reduced farmers’ profits. One farmer 
was quoted as saying: “You have a cer-
tain amount of demand, and the more you 
spread out the demand, you’re making less.” 
Perfect Competition in Farmers’ Markets

C H A P T E R  1 2  Firms in Perfectly Competitive Markets 
F
armers’ markets are an example of a perfectly competitive industry. Firms in per-
fectly competitive industries are unable to control the prices of the products they 
sell and are unable to earn an economic profit in the long run for two main rea-
sons: Firms in these industries sell identical products, and it is easy for new firms 
to enter these industries. Studying how perfectly competitive industries operate is the best 
way to understand how markets answer the fundamental economic questions discussed in 
Chapter 1:
• 
What goods and services will be produced?
• 
How will the goods and services be produced?
• 
Who will receive the goods and services produced?
In fact, though, most industries are not perfectly competitive. In most industries, firms do 
not produce identical products, and in some industries, it may be difficult for new firms to 
enter. There are thousands of industries in the United States. Although in some ways each 
industry is unique, industries share enough similarities that economists group them into 
four market structures. In particular, any industry has three key characteristics:
 1. The number of firms in the industry
 2. The similarity of the good or service produced by the firms in the industry
 3. The ease with which new firms can enter the industry
Economists use these characteristics to classify industries into the four market structures 
listed in Table 12.1.
Many industries, including restaurants, clothing stores, and other retailers, have a large 
number of firms selling products that are differentiated, rather than identical, and fall into 
the category of monopolistic competition. Some industries, such as computers and automo-
biles, have only a few firms and are oligopolies. Finally, a few industries, such as the delivery 
of first-class mail by the U.S. Postal Service, have only one firm and are monopolies. After 
discussing perfect competition in this chapter, we will devote a chapter to each of these other 
market structures.

Perfectly Competitive Markets
Why are firms in a perfectly competitive market unable to control the prices of the 
goods they sell, and why are the owners of these firms unable to earn economic profit 
in the long run? We can begin our analysis by listing the three conditions that make a 
market perfectly competitive:
 1. There must be many buyers and many firms, all of which are small relative to the market.
 2. The products sold by all firms in the market must be identical.
 3. There must be no barriers to new firms entering the market.
All three of these conditions hold in markets for agricultural products. For example, 
no single consumer or producer of apples buys or sells more than a tiny fraction of the 
total apple crop. The apples sold by each apple grower are identical, and there are no 
barriers to a new firm entering the apple market by purchasing land and planting apple 
trees. As we will see, it is the existence of many firms, all selling the same good, that 
keeps any single apple farmer from affecting the price of apples.
Although the market for apples meets the conditions for perfect competition, the 
markets for most goods and services do not. In particular, the second and third condi-
tions are very restrictive. In most markets that have many buyers and sellers, firms do 
not sell identical products. For example, not all restaurant meals are the same, nor is all 
women’s clothing the same. In Chapter 13, we will explore the common situation of mo-
nopolistic competition where many firms are selling similar but not identical products. 
In Chapters 14 and 15, we will analyze industries that are oligopolies or monopolies, 
where it is difficult for new firms to enter. In this chapter, we concentrate on perfectly 
competitive markets so we can use them as a benchmark to analyze how firms behave 
when facing the maximum possible competition.
A Perfectly Competitive Firm Cannot Affect  
the Market Price
Prices in perfectly competitive markets are determined by the interaction of demand 
and supply for the good or service. The actions of any single consumer or any single 
firm have no effect on the market price. Consumers and firms have to accept the market 
price if they want to buy and sell in a perfectly competitive market.
Because a firm in a perfectly competitive market is very small relative to the market 
and because it is selling exactly the same product as every other firm, it can sell as much 
as it wants without having to lower its price. But if a perfectly competitive firm tries to 
raise its price, it won’t sell anything at all because consumers will switch to buying the 
product from the firm’s competitors. Therefore, the firm will be a price taker and will 
have to charge the same price as every other firm in the market. Although we don’t usu-
ally think of firms as being too small to affect the market price, consumers are often in 
the position of being price takers. For instance, suppose your local supermarket is sell-
ing bread for $1.50 per loaf. You can load up your shopping cart with 10 loaves of bread, 
and the supermarket will gladly sell them all to you for $1.50 per loaf. But if you go to 
the cashier and offer to buy the bread for $1.49 per loaf, he or she will not sell it to you 
at that price. As a buyer, you are too small relative to the bread market to have any effect 
on the equilibrium price. Whether you leave the supermarket and buy no bread or you 
buy 10 loaves, you are unable to change the market price of bread by even 1 cent.
The situation you face as a bread buyer is the same one a wheat farmer faces as a 
wheat seller. In 2011, about 150,000 farmers grew wheat in the United States. The mar-
ket price of wheat is determined not by any individual wheat farmer but by the interac-
tion in the wheat market of all the buyers and all the sellers. If any one wheat farmer has 
the best crop the farmer has ever had, or if any one wheat farmer stops growing wheat 
altogether, the market price of wheat will not be affected because the market supply curve 
for wheat will not shift by enough to change the equilibrium price by even 1 cent.

The Demand Curve for the Output of a Perfectly 
Competitive Firm
Suppose Bill Parker grows wheat on a 250-acre farm in Washington State. Farmer Parker 
is selling wheat in a perfectly competitive market, so he is a price taker. Because he can 
sell as much wheat as he chooses at the market price—but can’t sell any wheat at all at 
a higher price—the demand curve for his wheat has an unusual shape: It is horizontal, 
as shown in Figure 12.1. With a horizontal demand curve, Farmer Parker must accept 
the market price, which in this case is $4 per bushel. Whether Farmer Parker sells 6,000 
bushels per year or 15,000 has no effect on the market price.
The demand curve for Farmer Parker’s wheat is very different from the market 
demand curve for wheat. Panel (a) of Figure 12.2 shows the market for wheat. The 
demand curve in panel (a) is the market demand curve for wheat and has the normal

A Perfectly Competitive Firm 
Faces a Horizontal Demand 
Curve
A firm in a perfectly competitive market is 
selling exactly the same product as many 
other firms. Therefore, it can sell as much 
as it wants at the current market price, but 
it cannot sell anything at all if it raises the 
price by even 1 cent. As a result, the demand 
curve for a perfectly competitive firm’s 
output is a horizontal line. In the figure, 
whether the wheat farmer sells 6,000 bush-
els per year or 15,000 bushels has no effect 
on the market price of $4.
Don’t Confuse the Demand Curve for 
Farmer Parker’s Wheat with the Market 
Demand Curve for Wheat
The demand curve for wheat has the normal downward-
sloping shape. If the price of wheat goes up, the quan-
tity of wheat demanded goes down, and if the price of 
wheat goes down, the quantity of wheat demanded goes 
up. But the demand curve for the output of a single wheat 
farmer is not downward sloping: It is a horizontal line. 
If an individual wheat farmer tries to increase the price 
he charges for his wheat, the quantity demanded falls to 
zero because buyers will purchase from one of the other 
150,000 wheat farmers. But any one farmer can sell as 
much wheat as the farmer can produce without need-
ing to cut the price. Both of these things are true because 
each wheat farmer is very small relative to the overall 
market for wheat.
When we draw graphs of the wheat market, we usually 
show the market equilibrium quantity in millions or bil-
lions of bushels. When we draw graphs of the demand for 
wheat produced by one farmer, we usually show the quan-
tity produced in smaller units, such as thousands of bush-
els. It is important to remember this difference in scale 
when interpreting these graphs.
Finally, it is not just wheat farmers who have horizon-
tal demand curves for their products; any firm in a per-
fectly competitive market faces a horizontal demand curve.

downward slope we are familiar with from the market demand curves in Chapter 3. 
Panel (b) of Figure 12.2 shows the demand curve for Farmer Parker’s wheat, which is a 
horizontal line. By viewing these graphs side by side, you can see that the price Farmer 
Parker receives for his wheat in panel (b) is determined by the interaction of all sellers 
and all buyers of wheat in the wheat market in panel (a). Keep in mind, however, that 
the scales on the horizontal axes in the two panels are very different. In panel (a), the 
equilibrium quantity of wheat is 2.25 billion bushels. In panel (b), Farmer Parker is pro-
ducing only 15,000 bushels, or less than 0.001 percent of market output. We need to use 
different scales in the two panels so we can display both of them on one page. Keep in 
mind this key point: Farmer Parker’s output of wheat is very small relative to the total 
market output.
How a Firm Maximizes Profit in a Perfectly 
Competitive Market
We have seen that Farmer Parker cannot control the price of his wheat. In this situa-
tion, how does he decide how much wheat to produce? We assume that Farmer Parker’s 
objective is to maximize profit. This is a reasonable assumption for most firms, most of 
the time. Remember that profit is the difference between total revenue (TR) and total 
cost (TC):
Profit = TR - TC.
To maximize his profit, Farmer Parker should produce the quantity of wheat where 
the difference between the total revenue he receives and his total cost is as large as 
possible.

 Figure 12.2  The Market Demand for Wheat versus the Demand for One Farmer’s Wheat
In a perfectly competitive market, price is determined by the intersection of 
market demand and market supply. In panel (a), the demand and supply curves 
for wheat intersect at a price of $4 per bushel. An individual wheat farmer like 
Farmer Parker cannot affect the market price for wheat. Therefore, as panel (b)  
shows, the demand curve for Farmer Parker’s wheat is a horizontal line.  
To understand this figure, it is important to notice that the scales on the horizon-
tal axes in the two panels are very different. In panel (a), the equilibrium quantity 
of wheat is 2.25 billion bushels, and in panel (b), Farmer Parker is producing 
only 15,000 bushels of wheat.

C H A P T E R  1 2  Firms in Perfectly Competitive Markets 
Revenue for a Firm in a Perfectly Competitive Market
To understand how Farmer Parker maximizes profits, let’s first consider his revenue. To 
keep the numbers simple, we will assume that he owns a very small farm and produces 
at most 10 bushels of wheat per year. Table 12.2 shows the revenue Farmer Parker will 
earn from selling various quantities of wheat if the market price for wheat is $4.
The third column in Table 12.2 shows that Farmer Parker’s total revenue rises by $4 
for every additional bushel he sells because he can sell as many bushels as he wants at the 
market price of $4 per bushel. The fourth and fifth columns in the table show Farmer 
Parker’s average revenue and marginal revenue from selling wheat. His average revenue 
(AR) is his total revenue divided by the quantity of bushels he sells. For example, if he sells 
5 bushels for a total of $20, his average revenue is 20>5 = 4. Notice that his average rev-
enue is also equal to the market price of $4. In fact, for any level of output, a firm’s average 
revenue is always equal to the market price. This equality holds because total revenue 
equals price times quantity (TR = P * Q), and average revenue equals total revenue 
divided by quantity (AR = TR>Q). So, AR = TR>Q = (P * Q)>Q = P.
Farmer Parker’s marginal revenue (MR) is the change in his total revenue from 
selling one more bushel:
Marginal revenue = Change in total revenue
Change in quantity
,
    or MR = DTR
DQ .
Because for each additional bushel sold, Farmer Parker always adds $4 to his total rev-
enue, his marginal revenue is $4. Farmer Parker’s marginal revenue is $4 per bushel 
because he is selling wheat in a perfectly competitive market and can sell as much as 
he wants at the market price. In fact, Farmer Parker’s marginal revenue and average 
revenue are both equal to the market price. This is an important point: For a firm 
in a perfectly competitive market, price is equal to both average revenue and marginal 
revenue.
Determining the Profit-Maximizing Level of Output
To determine how Farmer Parker can maximize profit, we have to consider his costs as 
well as his revenue. A wheat farmer has many costs, including the cost of seed and fertil-
izer, as well as the wages of farm workers. In Table 12.3, we bring together the revenue 
data from Table 12.2 with cost data for Farmer Parker’s farm. Recall from Chapter 10 
that a firm’s marginal cost is the increase in total cost resulting from producing another 
unit of output.
Average revenue (AR) Total revenue 
divided by the quantity of the product 
sold.
Marginal revenue (MR) The change 
in total revenue from selling one more 
unit of a product.

How a Firm Maximizes Profit in a Perfectly Competitive Market 
401
We calculate profit in the fourth column by subtracting total cost in the third col-
umn from total revenue in the second column. The fourth column shows that as long 
as Farmer Parker produces between 2 and 8 bushels of wheat, he will earn a profit. His 
maximum profit is $7.50, which he will earn by producing 6 bushels of wheat. Because 
Farmer Parker wants to maximize his profits, we would expect him to produce 6 bushels 
of wheat. Producing more than 6 bushels reduces his profit. For example, if he produces 
7 bushels of wheat, his profit will decline from $7.50 to $6.50. The values for marginal 
cost given in the last column of the table help us understand why Farmer Parker’s profits 
will decline if he produces more than 6 bushels of wheat: After the sixth bushel of wheat, 
rising marginal cost causes Farmer Parker’s profits to fall.
In fact, comparing the marginal cost and marginal revenue at each level of out-
put is an alternative method of calculating Farmer Parker’s profits. We illustrate the two 
 methods of calculating profits in Figure 12.3. We show the total revenue and total cost 
approach in panel (a) and the marginal revenue and marginal cost approach in panel 
(b). Total revenue is a straight line on the graph in panel (a) because total revenue in-
creases at a constant rate of $4 for each additional bushel sold. Farmer Parker’s profits 
are maximized when the vertical distance between the line representing total revenue 
and the total cost curve is as large as possible. Just as we saw in Table 12.3, his maximum 
profit occurs at an output of 6 bushels.
The last two columns of Table 12.3 show the marginal revenue (MR) Farmer Parker 
receives from selling another bushel of wheat and his marginal cost (MC) of producing 
another bushel of wheat. Panel (b) of Figure 12.3 is a graph of Farmer Parker’s mar-
ginal revenue and marginal cost. Because marginal revenue is always equal to $4, it is 
a horizontal line at the market price. We have already seen that the demand curve for 
a perfectly competitive firm is also a horizontal line at the market price. Therefore, the 
marginal revenue curve for a perfectly competitive firm is the same as its demand curve. 
Farmer Parker’s marginal cost of producing wheat first falls and then rises, following the 
usual pattern we discussed in Chapter 11.
We know from panel (a) that profit is at a maximum at 6 bushels of wheat. In panel 
(b), profit is also at a maximum at 6 bushels of wheat. To understand why profit is maxi-
mized at the level of output where marginal revenue equals marginal cost, remember 
a key economic principle that we discussed in Chapter 1: Optimal decisions are made 
at the margin. Firms use this principle to decide the quantity of a good to produce. For 
example, in deciding how much wheat to produce, Farmer Parker needs to compare the 
marginal revenue he earns from selling another bushel of wheat to the marginal cost of 
producing that bushel. The difference between the marginal revenue and the marginal

cost is the additional profit (or loss) from producing one more bushel. As long as mar-
ginal revenue is greater than marginal cost, Farmer Parker’s profits are increasing, and 
he will want to expand production. For example, he will not stop producing at 5 bushels 
of wheat because producing and selling the sixth bushel adds $4.00 to his revenue but 
only $3.50 to his cost, so his profit increases by $0.50. He wants to continue producing 
until the marginal revenue he receives from selling another bushel is equal to the mar-
ginal cost of producing it. At that level of output, he will make no additional profit by 
selling another bushel, so he will have maximized his profits.
By inspecting Table 12.3 on page 401, we can see that there is no level of output at 
which marginal revenue exactly equals marginal cost. The closest Farmer Parker can 
come is to produce 6 bushels of wheat. He will not want to produce additional wheat 
once marginal cost is greater than marginal revenue because that would reduce his prof-
its. For example, the seventh bushel of wheat adds $5.00 to his cost but only $4.00 to his 
revenue, so producing the seventh bushel reduces his profit by $1.00.
From the information in Table 12.3 and Figure 12.3, we can draw the following 
conclusions:
 1. The profit-maximizing level of output is where the difference between total revenue 
and total cost is the greatest.
 2. The profit-maximizing level of output is also where marginal revenue equals mar-
ginal cost, or MR = MC.
Both of these conclusions are true for any firm, whether or not it is in a perfectly com-
petitive industry. We can draw one other conclusion about profit maximization that is 
true only of firms in perfectly competitive industries: For a firm in a perfectly com-
petitive industry, price is equal to marginal revenue, or P = MR. So, we can restate the 
MR = MC condition as P = MC.

 Figure 12.3  The Profit-Maximizing Level of Output
In panel (a), Farmer Parker maximizes his profit where the vertical distance be-
tween total revenue and total cost is the largest. This happens at an output of  
6 bushels. Panel (b) shows that Farmer Parker’s marginal revenue (MR) is equal 
to a constant $4 per bushel. Farmer Parker maximizes profits by producing 
wheat up to the point where the marginal revenue of the last bushel produced 
is equal to its marginal cost, or MR = MC. In this case, at no level of output 
does marginal revenue exactly equal marginal cost. The closest Farmer Parker 
can come is to produce 6 bushels of wheat. He will not want to continue to pro-
duce once marginal cost is greater than marginal revenue because that would 
reduce his profits. Panels (a) and (b) show alternative ways of thinking about 
how Farmer Parker can determine the profit-maximizing quantity of wheat to 
produce.

Illustrating Profit or Loss on the 
Cost Curve Graph
We have seen that profit is the difference between total revenue and total cost. We can 
also express profit in terms of average total cost (ATC). This allows us to show profit on 
the cost curve graph we developed in Chapter 10.
To begin, we need to work through several steps to determine the relationship be-
tween profit and average total cost. Because profit is equal to total revenue minus total 
cost (TC) and total revenue is price times quantity, we can write the following:
Profit = (P * Q) - TC.
If we divide both sides of this equation by Q, we have
 Profit
Q
= (P * Q)
Q
- TC
Q
or
 Profit
Q
= P - ATC,
because TC/Q equals ATC. This equation tells us that profit per unit (or average profit) 
equals price minus average total cost. Finally, we obtain the equation for the relationship 
between total profit and average total cost by multiplying again by Q:
Profit = (P - ATC) * Q.
This equation tells us that a firm’s total profit is equal to the quantity produced multi-
plied by the difference between price and average total cost.
Showing a Profit on the Graph
Figure 12.4 shows the relationship between a firm’s average total cost and its marginal 
cost that we discussed in Chapter 10. In this figure, we also show the firm’s marginal 
revenue curve (which is the same as its demand curve) and the area representing total 
profit. Using the relationship between profit and average total cost that we just deter-
mined, we can say that the area representing total profit has a height equal to (P - ATC) 
and a base equal to Q. This area is shown by the green-shaded rectangle.

Solving the Problem
Step 1: Review the chapter material. This problem is about using cost curve graphs 
to analyze perfectly competitive firms, so you may want to review the section 
 “Illustrating Profit or Loss on the Cost Curve Graph” on page 403.
Step 2: Calculate Andy’s marginal cost, average total cost, and average variable 
cost. To maximize profit, Andy will produce the level of output where mar-
ginal revenue is equal to marginal cost. We can calculate marginal cost from 
the information given in the table. We can also calculate average total cost and 
average variable cost in order to draw the required graph. Average total cost 
(ATC) equals total cost (TC) divided by the level of output (Q). Average variable 
cost (AVC) equals variable cost (VC) divided by output (Q). To calculate vari-
able cost, recall that total cost equals variable cost plus fixed cost. When output 
equals zero, total cost equals fixed cost. In this case, fixed cost equals $10.00.

a. 
 Suppose the current equilibrium price in the bas-

many basketballs will Andy produce, what price 
will he charge, and how much profit (or loss) will 
he make? Draw a graph to illustrate your answer. 
Your graph should be labeled clearly and should 
include Andy’s demand, ATC, AVC, MC, and MR 
curves; the price he is charging; the quantity he is 
producing; and the area representing his profit (or 
loss).
 
b. 
 Suppose the equilibrium price of basketballs falls 
to $6.00. Now how many basketballs will Andy 
produce, what price will he charge, and how much 
profit (or loss) will he make? Draw a graph to il-
lustrate this situation, using the instructions in 
part a.

Step 3: Use the information from the table in Step 2 to calculate how many basket-
balls Andy will produce, what price he will charge, and how much profit he 
will earn if the market price of basketballs is $12.50. Andy’s marginal rev-
enue is equal to the market price of $12.50. Marginal revenue equals marginal 
cost when Andy produces 6 basketballs per day. So, Andy will produce 6 bas-
ketballs per day and charge a price of $12.50 per basketball. Andy’s profits are 
equal to his total revenue minus his total costs. His total revenue equals the 
6 basketballs he sells multiplied by the $12.50 price, or $75.00. So, his profit 
equals: $75.00 - $55.50 = $19.50.
Step 4: Use the information from the table in Step 2 to illustrate your answer to

Step 5: Calculate how many basketballs Andy will produce, what price he will 
charge, and how much profit he will earn when the market price of bas-
ketballs is $6.00. Referring to the table in Step 2, we can see that marginal 
revenue equals marginal cost when Andy produces 4 basketballs per day. He 
charges the market price of $6.00 per basketball. His total revenue is only 
$24.00, while his total costs are $34.00, so he will have a loss of $10.00. (Can 
we be sure that Andy will continue to produce even though he is operating at

Illustrating When a Firm Is Breaking Even 
or Operating at a Loss
We have already seen that to maximize profit, a firm produces the level of output where 
marginal revenue equals marginal cost. But will the firm actually make a profit at that 
level of output? It depends on the relationship of price to average total cost. There are 
three possibilities:
 1. P 7 ATC, which means the firm makes a profit
 2. P = ATC, which means the firm breaks even (its total cost equals its total revenue)
 3. P 6 ATC, which means the firm experiences a loss
Figure 12.4 on page 403 shows the first possibility, where the firm makes a profit. Panels (a) 
 and (b) of Figure 12.5 show the situations where a firm breaks even or experiences losses. 
Remember That Firms Maximize Their Total 
Profit, Not Their Profit per Unit
A student examines the following graph and argues, “I 
believe that a firm will want to produce at Q1, not Q2. At 
Q1, the distance between price and average total cost is the 
greatest. Therefore, at Q1, the firm will be maximizing its 
profits per unit.” Briefly explain whether you agree with 
the student’s argument.
The student’s argument is incorrect because firms are 
interested in maximizing their total profit, not their profit 
per unit. We know that profit are not maximized at Q1 
 because at that level of output, marginal revenue is greater 
than marginal cost. A firm can always increase its profits 
by producing any unit that adds more to its revenue than 
it does to its costs. Only when the firm has expanded pro-
duction to Q2 will it have produced every unit for which 
marginal revenue is greater than marginal cost. At that 
point, it will have maximized profit.

Losing Money in the Medical  
Screening Industry
In a market system, a good or service becomes available to con-
sumers only if an entrepreneur brings the product to market. 
Thousands of new businesses open every week in the United States. Each new business 
represents an entrepreneur risking his or her funds, trying to earn a profit by offering a 
good or service to consumers. Of course, there are no guarantees of success, and many 
new businesses experience losses rather than earn the profits their owners hoped for.
In the early 2000s, technological advances reduced the price of computed tomography 
(CT) scanning equipment. For years, doctors and hospitals have prescribed CT scans to 
diagnose patients showing symptoms of heart disease, cancer, and other disorders. The 
declining price of CT scanning equipment convinced many entrepreneurs that it would be 
profitable to offer preventive body scans to apparently healthy people. The idea was that 
the scans would provide early detection of diseases before the customers had begun expe-
riencing symptoms. Unfortunately, the new firms offering this service ran into several dif-
ficulties: First, because the CT scan was a voluntary procedure, it was not covered under 
most medical insurance plans. Second, very few consumers used the service more than 
once, so there was almost no repeat business. Finally, as with any other medical test, some 
false positives occurred, where the scan appeared to detect a problem that did not actually 
exist. Negative publicity from people who had expensive additional—and unnecessary—
medical procedures as a result of false-positive CT scans also hurt these new businesses.
As a result of these problems, the demand for CT scans was less than most of these 
entrepreneurs had expected, and the new businesses operated at a loss. For example, the 
owner of California HeartScan would have broken even if the market price had been 
$495 per heart scan, but he suffered losses because the actual market price was only 
$250. The following graphs show the owner’s situation:

$495 per scan.
3. Therefore, firms like
California HeartScan
lost money.
Why didn’t California HeartScan and other medical clinics just raise the price to 
the level they needed to break even? We have already seen that any firm that tries to 
raise the price it charges above the market price loses customers to competing firms. By 
fall 2003, many scanning businesses began to close. Most of the entrepreneurs who had 
started those businesses lost their investments.

Making  
the 
Connection
In panel (a) of Figure 12.5, at the level of output at which MR = MC, price is equal to av-
erage total cost. Therefore, total revenue is equal to total cost, and the firm will break even, 
making zero economic profit. In panel (b), at the level of output at which MR = MC, 
price is less than average total cost. Therefore, total revenue is less than total cost, and the 
firm has losses. In this case, maximizing profit amounts to minimizing loss.

Deciding Whether to Produce or to 
Shut Down in the Short Run
In panel (b) of Figure 12.5 on page 406, we assumed that the firm would continue to 
produce even though it was operating at a loss. In fact, in the short run, a firm experi-
encing a loss has two choices:
 1. Continue to produce
 2. Stop production by shutting down temporarily
In many cases, a firm experiencing a loss will consider stopping production tempo-
rarily. Even during a temporary shutdown, however, a firm must still pay its fixed costs. 
For example, if the firm has signed a lease for its building, the landlord will expect to 
receive a monthly rent payment, even if the firm is not producing anything that month. 
Therefore, if a firm does not produce, it will suffer a loss equal to its fixed costs. This 
loss is the maximum the firm will accept. The firm will shut down if producing would 
cause it to lose an amount greater than its fixed costs.
A firm can reduce its loss below the amount of its total fixed cost by continuing to 
produce, provided that the total revenue it receives is greater than its variable cost. A 
firm can use the revenue over and above variable cost to cover part of its fixed cost. In 
this case, a firm will have a smaller loss by continuing to produce than if it shut down.
In analyzing the firm’s decision to shut down, we are assuming that its fixed costs 
are sunk costs. Remember from Chapter 10 that a sunk cost is a cost that has already 
been paid and cannot be recovered. We assume, as is usually the case, that the firm 
cannot recover its fixed costs by shutting down. For example, if a farmer has taken out 
a loan to buy land, the farmer is legally required to make the monthly loan payment 
whether he grows any wheat that season or not. The farmer has to spend those funds 
and cannot get them back, so the farmer should treat his sunk costs as irrelevant to his 
decision making. For any firm, whether total revenue is greater or less than variable costs 
is the key to deciding whether to shut down. As long as a firm’s total revenue is greater 
than its variable costs, it should continue to produce no matter how large or small its 
fixed costs are.
12.4 LEARNING OBJECTIVE
Explain why firms may shut 
down temporarily.
Sunk cost A cost that has already 
been paid and cannot be recovered.
Solving the Problem
Step 1: Review the chapter material. This problem is about the role of sunk costs in 
business decision making, so you may want to review the section “Deciding 
Whether to Produce or to Shut Down in the Short Run,” which begins above 
on this page. 
Solved Problem 12.4
When to Pull the Plug  
on a Movie
When Walt Disney released the film Mars Needs Moms, 
directed by Robert Zemeckis, in March 2011, it did very 
poorly at the box office. Worldwide, it earned less than 
$40 million in revenue, even though it cost $175 million 
to make. A year before the film was released, Disney ex-
ecutives watched the parts of the film that were complete. 
They were disappointed in what they saw and immediately 
stopped production on Robert Zemeckis’s next film. They 
did not, however, stop production on Mars Needs Moms, 
on which the company had already spent $100 million. In 
March 2010, at the time the executives became concerned 
about the quality of the film, how should Disney have de-
cided whether to finish Mars Needs Moms and release it? 
What role should the $100 million Disney executives had 
already spent on the film have played in their decision?

 
Deciding Whether to Produce or to Shut Down in the Short Run  
409
One option not available to a firm with losses in a perfectly competitive market is to 
raise its price. If the firm did raise its price, it would lose all its customers, and its sales 
would drop to zero. For example, in a recent year, the price of wheat in the United States 
was $3.16 per bushel. At that price, the typical U.S. wheat farmer lost $9,500. At a price 
of about $4.25 per bushel, the typical wheat farmer would have broken even. But any 
wheat farmer who tried to raise his price to $4.25 per bushel would have seen his sales 
quickly disappear because buyers could purchase all the wheat they wanted at $3.16 per 
bushel from the thousands of other wheat farmers.
The Supply Curve of a Firm in the Short Run
Remember that the supply curve for a firm tells us how many units of a product the 
firm is willing to sell at any given price. Notice that the marginal cost curve for a firm 
in a perfectly competitive market tells us the same thing. The firm will produce at the 
level of output where MR = MC. Because price equals marginal revenue for a firm in 
a perfectly competitive market, the firm will produce where P = MC. For any given 
price, we can determine from the marginal cost curve the quantity of output the firm 
will supply. Therefore, a perfectly competitive firm’s marginal cost curve also is its sup-
ply curve. There is, however, an important qualification to this fact. We have seen 
that if a firm is experiencing a loss, it will shut down if its total revenue is less than its 
variable cost:
Total revenue 6 Variable cost,
or, in symbols:
(P * Q) 6 VC.
Step 2: Use your knowledge of the role of sunk costs in decisions about whether to 
shut down to answer the question. In this case, Disney was not considering 
whether to shut down the company but whether to shut down this particular 
film. By March 2010, Disney had already invested $100 million in Mars Needs 
Moms. It is tempting to argue that unless Disney completed the film, the $100 
million would be lost. It is important to see, though, that the $100 million was 
a sunk cost: Whether Disney shut down the film or finished it and released 
it to theaters, the company would not be able to get that $100 million back. 
Therefore, the $100 million was irrelevant to Disney’s decision. Instead, Dis-
ney should have made the decision based on comparing the additional cost 
of completing and releasing the film to the revenue the film was expected 
to earn. In other words, Disney should have completed the film if marginal 
revenue was expected to be greater than marginal cost, and it should have 
shut down the film if marginal cost were expected to be greater than marginal 
revenue.
Although Disney knew the marginal cost of completing and releasing the 
film, it had to estimate the marginal revenue based on its forecasts of ticket 
sales and later sales of DVDs and streaming video. Disney decided to finish the 
film. The flim cost an additional $75 million to complete, but it earned only 
about $39 million at the box office. With hindsight, Disney made the wrong 
decision, but the company may have overestimated ticket sales or expected 
sales of DVDs and streaming video to offset poor results at the box office.

If we divide both sides by Q, we have the result that the firm will shut down if
P 6 AVC.
If the price drops below average variable cost, the firm will have a smaller loss if it shuts 
down and produces no output. So, the firm’s marginal cost curve is its supply curve only 
for prices at or above average variable cost. The red line in Figure 12.6 shows the supply 
curve for the firm in the short run.
Recall that the marginal cost curve intersects the average variable cost where the 
average variable cost curve is at its minimum point. Therefore, the firm’s supply curve 
is its marginal cost curve above the minimum point of the average variable cost curve. 
For prices below minimum average variable cost (PMIN), the firm will shut down, and its 
output will fall to zero. The minimum point on the average variable cost curve is called 
the shutdown point, and it occurs in Figure 12.6 at output level QSD.
The Market Supply Curve in a Perfectly  
Competitive Industry
We saw in Chapter 10 that the market demand curve is determined by adding up the 
quantity demanded by each consumer in the market at each price. Similarly, the mar-
ket supply curve is determined by adding up the quantity supplied by each firm in the 
market at each price. Each firm’s marginal cost curve tells us how much that firm will 
supply at each price. So, the market supply curve can be derived directly from the mar-
ginal cost curves of the firms in the market. Panel (a) of Figure 12.7 shows the marginal 
cost curve for one wheat farmer. At a price of $4, this wheat farmer supplies 15,000 
bushels of wheat. If every wheat farmer supplies the same amount of wheat at this price 
and if there are 150,000 wheat farmers, the total amount of wheat supplied at a price of 
$4 will be
15,000 bushels per farmer * 150,000 farms = 2.25 billion bushels of wheat.
Panel (b) shows a price of $4 and a quantity of 2.25 billion bushels as a point on the 
market supply curve for wheat. In reality, of course, not all wheat farms are alike. 
Some wheat farms supply more at the market price than the typical farm; other wheat 
farms supply less. The key point is that we can derive the market supply curve by add-
ing up the quantity that each firm in the market is willing and able to supply at each 
price.

The firm will produce at the level of output 
at which MR = MC. Because price equals 
marginal revenue for a firm in a perfectly 
competitive market, the firm will produce 
where P = MC. For any given price, we can 
determine the quantity of output the firm 
will supply from the marginal cost curve. In 
other words, the marginal cost curve is the 
firm’s supply curve. But remember that the 
firm will shut down if the price falls below av-
erage variable cost. The marginal cost curve 
crosses the average variable cost at the firm’s 
shutdown point. This point occurs at output 
level QSD. For prices below PMIN, the supply 
curve is a vertical line along the price axis, 
which shows that the firm will supply zero 
output at those prices. The red line in the fig-
ure is the firm’s short-run supply curve.

“If Everyone Can Do It, You Can’t Make 
Money at It”: The Entry and Exit of Firms  
in the Long Run
In the long run, unless a firm can cover all its costs, it will shut down and exit the indus-
try. In a market system, firms continually enter and exit industries. In this section, we 
will see how profits and losses provide signals to firms that lead to entry and exit.
Economic Profit and the Entry or Exit Decision
To begin, let’s look more closely at how economists characterize the profits earned by 
the owners of a firm. Suppose Sacha Gillette decides to start her own business. After 
considering her interests and preparing a business plan, she decides to start a vegeta-
ble farm rather than open a restaurant or gift shop. After 10 years of effort, Sacha has 
saved $100,000 and borrowed another $900,000 from a bank. With these funds, she has 
bought the land and farm equipment necessary to start her farm. She intends to sell 
the carrots she grows in a local farmers’ market. As we saw in Chapter 11, when some-
one invests her own funds in her firm, the opportunity cost to the firm is the return 
the funds would have earned in their best alternative use. If Farmer Gillette could have 
earned a 10 percent return on her $100,000 in savings in their best alternative use—
which might have been, for example, to buy a small restaurant—then her carrot busi-
ness incurs a $10,000 opportunity cost. We can also think of this $10,000 as being the 
minimum amount that Farmer Gillette needs to earn on her $100,000 investment in her 
farm to remain in the industry in the long run.
Table 12.4 lists Farmer Gillette’s costs. In addition to her explicit costs, we assume 
that she has two implicit costs: the $10,000 that represents the opportunity cost of the 
funds she invested in her farm and the $30,000 salary she could have earned managing

 Figure 12.7  Firm Supply and Market Supply
We can derive the market supply curve by adding up the quantity that each 
firm in the market is willing to supply at each price. In panel (a), one wheat 
farmer is willing to supply 15,000 bushels of wheat at a price of $4 per bushel. 
If every wheat farmer supplies the same amount of wheat at this price and 
if there are 150,000 wheat farmers, the total amount of wheat supplied at a 
price of $4 will equal 15,000 bushels per farmer * 150,000 farmers = 2.25 
billion bushels of wheat. This is one point on the market supply curve for 
wheat shown in panel (b). We can find the other points on the market sup-
ply curve by determining how much wheat each farmer is willing to supply at 
each price.

someone else’s farm instead of her own. Her total costs are $125,000. If the market price 
of carrots is $15 per box and Farmer Gillette sells 10,000 boxes, her total revenue will be 
$150,000, and her economic profit will be $25,000 (total revenue of $150,000 minus to-
tal costs of $125,000). Recall from Chapter 8 that economic profit equals a firm’s reve-
nues minus all its costs, implicit and explicit. So, Farmer Gillette is covering the $10,000 
opportunity cost of the funds invested in her firm, and she is also earning an additional 
$25,000 in economic profit.
Economic Profit Leads to Entry of New Firms Unfortunately, Farmer  Gillette 
is unlikely to earn an economic profit for very long. Suppose other farmers are just 
breaking even by selling their carrots to supermarkets. In that case, they will have an 
incentive to switch to selling at farmers’ markets so they can begin earning an economic 
profit. As we saw in the chapter opener, in recent years, many small farmers have begun 
to sell in farmers’ markets, in the hope of earning higher profits. Remember that the 
more firms there are in an industry, the farther to the right the market supply curve 
is. Panel (a) of Figure 12.8 shows that as more farmers begin selling carrots in farmers’ 
markets, the market supply curve shifts to the right. Farmers will continue entering the 
market until the market supply curve has shifted from S1 to S2.
With the supply curve at S2, the market price will have fallen to $10 per box. Panel (b) 
shows the effect on Farmer Gillette, whom we assume has the same costs as other car-
rot farmers. As the market price falls from $15 to $10 per box, Farmer Gillette’s demand 
curve shifts down, from D1 to D2. In the new equilibrium, Farmer Gillette is selling 
8,000 boxes, at a price of $10 per box. She and the other carrot farmers are no longer 
earning any economic profit. They are just breaking even, and the return on their in-
vestment is just covering the opportunity cost of these funds. New farmers will stop 
entering the market for selling carrots in farmers’ markets because the rate of return is 
no better than they can earn by selling their carrots elsewhere.
Will Farmer Gillette continue to sell carrots at farmers’ markets even though she 
is just breaking even? She will because selling carrots at farmers’ markets earns her as 
high a return on her investment as she could earn elsewhere. It may seem strange that 
new firms will continue to enter a market until all economic profits are eliminated and 
that established firms remain in a market despite not earning any economic profit. But it 
seems strange only because we are used to thinking in terms of accounting profits rather 
than economic profits. Remember that accounting rules generally require that only ex-
plicit costs be included on a firm’s financial statements. The opportunity cost of the funds 
Farmer Gillette invested in her firm—$10,000—and her forgone salary—$30,000—are 
economic costs, but neither of them is an accounting cost. So, although an accountant 
would see Farmer Gillette as earning a profit of $40,000, an economist would see her as 
just breaking even. Farmer Gillette must pay attention to her accounting profit when 
preparing her financial statements and when paying her income tax. But because eco-
nomic profit takes into account all her costs, it gives a more accurate indication of the 
financial health of her farm.

413
Economic Losses Lead to Exit of Firms Suppose some consumers decide that 
there are no important benefits from locally grown produce sold at farmers’ markets, 
and they switch back to buying their produce in supermarkets. Panel (a) of Figure 12.9 
shows that the demand curve for carrots sold in farmers’ markets will shift to the left, 
from D1 to D2, and the market price will fall from $10 per box to $7. Panel (b) shows 
that as the price falls, a farmer, like Sacha Gillette, will move down her marginal cost 
curve to a lower level of output. At the lower level of output and lower price, she will be 
suffering an economic loss because she will not cover all her costs. As long as price is 
above average variable cost, she will continue to produce in the short run, even when 
suffering losses. But in the long run, firms will exit an industry if they are unable to 
cover all their costs. In this case, some farmers will switch back to selling carrots to su-
permarkets rather than selling them in farmers’ markets.
Panel (c) of Figure 12.9 shows that as firms exit from selling at farmers’ markets, the 
market supply curve shifts to the left. Firms will continue to exit, and the supply curve 
will continue to shift to the left until the price has risen back to $10 and the market 
supply curve is at S2. Panel (d) shows that when the price is back to $10, the remaining 
firms in the industry will be breaking even.
Long-Run Equilibrium in a Perfectly 
Competitive Market
We have seen that economic profits attract firms to enter an industry. The entry of 
firms forces down the market price until the typical firm is breaking even. Economic 
losses cause firms to exit an industry. The exit of firms forces up the equilibrium mar-
ket price until the typical firm is breaking even. This process of entry and exit results 
in long-run competitive equilibrium. In long-run competitive equilibrium, entry and 
exit have resulted in the typical firm breaking even. We saw in Chapter 11 that in the

We assume that Farmer Gillette’s costs are the same as the costs of other carrot 
farmers. Initially, she and other farmers selling carrots in farmers’ markets are 
able to charge $15 per box and earn an economic profit. Farmer Gillette’s eco-
nomic profit is represented by the area of the green box. Panel (a) shows that 
as other farmers begin to sell carrots in farmers’ markets, the market supply 
curve shifts to the right, from S1 to S2, and the market price drops to $10 per 
box. Panel (b) shows that the falling price causes Farmer Gillette’s demand curve 
to shift down from D1 to D2, and she reduces her output from 10,000 boxes to 
8,000. At the new market price of $10 per box, carrot growers are just breaking 
even: Their total revenue is equal to their total cost, and their economic profit is 
zero. Notice the difference in scale between the graph in panel (a) and the graph 
in panel (b).

When the price of carrots is $10 per box, Farmer Gillette and other farmers are 
breaking even. A total quantity of 310,000 boxes is sold in the market. Farmer 
Gillette sells 8,000 boxes. Panel (a) shows a decline in the demand for car-
rots sold in farmers’ markets from D1 to D2 that reduces the market price to 
$7 per box. Panel (b) shows that the falling price causes Farmer Gillette’s de-
mand curve to shift down from D1 to D2 and her output to fall from 8,000 to 
5,000 boxes. At a market price of $7 per box, farmers have economic losses, 
represented by the area of the red box. As a result, some farmers will exit the 
market, which shifts the market supply curve to the left. Panel (c) shows that 
exit continues until the supply curve has shifted from S1 to S2 and the mar-
ket price has risen from $7 back to $10. Panel (d) shows that with the price 
back at $10, Farmer Gillette will break even. In the new market equilibrium in 
panel (c), total sales of carrots in farmers’ markets have fallen from 310,000 to

long run firms can also vary their scale by becoming larger or smaller. The long-run 
average cost curve shows the lowest cost at which a firm is able to produce a given 
quantity of output in the long run. So, we would expect that in the long run, compe-
tition drives the market price to the minimum point on the typical firm’s long-run 
 average cost curve.
The long run in selling produce in farmers’ markets appears to be several years, 
which is the amount of time it takes for new farmers’ markets to be organized and for 
farmers to make the investment necessary to sell directly to consumers. As we discussed 
in the chapter opener, the number of farmers’ markets operating in the United States 
had increased from 4,093 in 2005 to 7,175 in 2011. By 2011, some farmers had begun to 
exit the market because the prices they were receiving were lower than they could get by 
selling their produce elsewhere. In Oregon, 32 of 62 farmers’ markets that had opened 
in recent years have since closed.
Firms in perfectly competitive markets are in a constant struggle to stay one step 
ahead of their competitors. They are always looking for new ways to provide a product, 
such as selling carrots in farmers’ markets. It is possible for firms to find ways to earn 
an economic profit for a while, but competition typically competes those profits away 
in just a few years. This observation is not restricted to agriculture. In any perfectly 
competitive market, an opportunity to make economic profits never lasts long. As Sha-
ron Oster, an economist at Yale University, has put it, “If everyone can do it, you can’t 
make money at it.”
The Long-Run Supply Curve in a Perfectly 
Competitive Market
If the typical farmer selling carrots in a farmers’ market breaks even at a price of 
$10 per box, in the long run, the market price will always return to this level. If an 
increase in demand causes the market price to rise above $10, farmers will be earning 
economic profits. These profits will attract additional farmers into the market, and the 
market supply curve will shift to the right until the price is back to $10. Panel (a) in 
Figure 12.10 illustrates the long-run effect of an increase in demand. An increase in 
demand from D1 to D2 causes the market price to temporarily rise from $10 per box 
to $15. At this price, farmers are making economic profits selling carrots at farmers’ 
markets, but these profits attract entry of new farmers. The result is an increase in sup-
ply from S1 to S2, which forces the price back down to $10 per box and eliminates the 
economic profits.
Similarly, if a decrease in demand causes the market price to fall below $10, farm-
ers will experience economic losses. These losses will cause some farmers to exit the 
market, the supply curve will shift to the left, and the price will return to $10. Panel (b) 
in Figure 12.10 illustrates the long-run effect of a decrease in demand. A decrease in de-
mand from D1 to D2 causes the market price to fall temporarily from $10 per box to $7. 
At this price, farmers are suffering economic losses, but these losses cause some farmers 
to exit the market for organic apples. The result is a decrease in supply from S1 to S2, 
which forces the price back up to $10 per box and eliminates the losses.
The long-run supply curve shows the relationship in the long run between market 
price and the quantity supplied. In the long run, the price will be $10 per box, no matter 
how many boxes of carrots are produced. So, as Figure 12.10 shows, the long-run sup-
ply curve (SLR) is a horizontal line at a price of $10. Remember that the reason the price 
returns to $10 in the long run is that this is the price at which the typical firm in the 
industry just breaks even. The typical firm breaks even at this price because it is at the 
minimum point on the firm’s average total cost curve. We can draw the important con-
clusion that in the long run, a perfectly competitive market will supply whatever amount 
of a good consumers demand at a price determined by the minimum point on the typical 
firm’s average total cost curve.
Because the position of the long-run supply curve is determined by the minimum 
point on the typical firm’s average total cost curve, anything that raises or lowers the

shows the relationship in the long

In the Apple iPhone Apps Store,  
Easy Entry Makes the Long  
Run Pretty Short
Apple introduced the first version of the iPhone in June 2007. 
Although popular, the original iPhone had some drawbacks, including a slow con-
nection to the Internet and an inability to run any applications except those written 
by Apple. The iPhone 3G, released in July 2008, could connect to the Internet more 
quickly and easily, had a faster processor, and had a larger capacity. But perhaps most 
importantly, with the release of the iPhone 3G, Apple announced that a section of its 
immensely popular iTunes music and video store would be devoted to applications (or 
“apps”) for the iPhone. Independent software programmers would write these iPhone 
apps. Apple would approve the apps and make them available in the iTunes app store in 
exchange for receiving 30 percent of the purchase price. Major software companies, as 
well as individuals writing their first software programs, have posted games, calendars, 
dictionaries, and many other types of apps to the iTunes store.
Apple sold more than 3 million iPhones within a month of launching the iPhone 
3G. Demand for apps from the iTunes store soared along with sales of the iPhone. Ethan

 Figure 12.10  The Long-Run Supply Curve in a Perfectly Competitive Industry
Panel (a) shows that an increase in demand for carrots sold in farmers’ markets 
will lead to a temporary increase in price from $10 to $15 per box, as the market 
demand curve shifts to the right, from D1 to D2. The entry of new firms shifts 
the market supply curve to the right, from S1 to S2, which will cause the price to 
fall back to its long-run level of $10. Panel (b) shows that a decrease in demand 
will lead to a temporary decrease in price from $10 to $7 per box, as the market 
demand curve shifts to the left, from D1 to D2. The exit of firms shifts the market 
supply curve to the left, from S1 to S2, which causes the price to rise back to its

between market price and the quantity supplied in the long run. In this case, the 
long-run supply curve is a horizontal line.
costs of the typical firm in the long run will cause the long-run supply curve to shift. 
For example, if a new disease infects carrots and the costs of treating the disease adds 
$2 per box to every farmers’ cost of producing carrots, the long-run supply curve will 
shift up by $2.

competed away in the iTunes apps

417
Increasing-Cost and Decreasing-Cost Industries
Any industry in which the typical firm’s average costs do not change as the industry 
expands production will have a horizontal long-run supply curve, like the one in Fig-
ure 12.10. Industries, like the carrot industry, where this holds true are called constant-
cost industries. It’s possible, however, for the typical firm’s average costs to change as an 
industry expands.
For example, if an input used in producing a good is available in only limited quan-
tities, the cost of the input will rise as the industry expands. If only a limited amount 
of land is available on which to grow the grapes to make a certain variety of wine, an 
increase in demand for wine made from these grapes will result in competition for the 
land and will drive up its price. As a result, more of the wine will be produced in the 
long run only if the price rises to cover the higher average costs of the typical firm. In 
this case, the long-run supply curve will slope upward. Industries with upward-sloping 
long-run supply curves are called increasing-cost industries.
Finally, in some cases, the typical firm’s costs may fall as the industry expands. 
Suppose that someone invents a new microwave that uses as an input a specialized 
memory chip that is currently produced only in small quantities. If demand for the 
microwave increases, firms that produce microwaves will increase their orders for 
the memory chip. We saw in Chapter 11 that if there are economies of scale in pro-
ducing a good, its average cost will decline as output increases. If there are economies 
of scale in producing this memory chip, the average cost of producing it will fall, and 
competition will result in its price falling as well. This price decline, in turn, will 
lower the average cost of producing the new microwave. In the long run, competi-
tion will force the price of the microwave to fall to the level of the new lower average 
cost of the typical firm. In this case, the long-run supply curve will slope downward. 
Industries with downward-sloping long-run supply curves are called decreasing-cost 
industries.
written a game before, decided to teach himself the coding language used in iPhone 
apps. His game, iShoot, with an initial price of $4.99, was a great success. Within one 
week of posting to iTunes, enough people had downloaded iShoot to earn Nicholas 
$200,000. At the end of five months, he had earned $800,000.
But could Nicholas’s success last? As we have seen, when firms earn economic 
profits in a market, other firms have a strong economic incentive to enter that mar-
ket. This is exactly what happened with iPhone apps, and by April 2009, more than 
25,000 apps were available in the iTunes store. The cost of entering this market was 
very small. Anyone with the programming skills and the available time could write 
an app and have it posted in the store. As a result of this enhanced competition, the 
ability to get rich quick with a killer app was quickly fading. As an article in the New 
York Times put it: “The chances of hitting the iPhone jackpot keep getting slimmer: 
the Apple store is already crowded with look-alike games . . . and fresh inventory 
keeps arriving daily. Many of the simple but clever concepts that sell briskly . . . are 
already taken.”
To try to maintain sales, Ethan Nicholas was forced to drop the price of iShoot from 
$4.99 in October 2008 to $2.99 in April 2009 to $1.99 in May 2009, and finally to $0.99 
in September 2010. But his profits from the game continued to decline. In a competitive 
market, earning an economic profit in the long run is extremely difficult. And the ease 
of entering the market for iPhone apps has made the long run pretty short.

Perfect Competition and Efficiency
Notice how powerful consumers are in a market system. If consumers want more 
locally grown carrots, the market will supply them. This happens not because a 
government bureaucrat in Washington, DC, or an official in a carrot growers’ as-
sociation gives orders. The additional carrots are produced because an increase in 
demand results in higher prices and a higher rate of return from selling at farmers’ 
markets. Carrot growers, trying to get the highest possible return on their invest-
ments, begin to switch from selling to supermarkets to selling at farmers’ markets. 
If consumers lose their taste for locally grown carrots and demand falls, the process 
works in reverse.
Productive Efficiency
In a market system, consumers get as many carrots as they want, produced at the lowest 
average cost possible. The forces of competition will drive the market price to the mini-
mum average cost of the typical firm. Productive efficiency refers to the situation in 
which a good or service is produced at the lowest possible cost. As we have seen, perfect 
competition results in productive efficiency.
The managers of every firm strive to earn an economic profit by reducing costs. 
But in a perfectly competitive market, other firms quickly copy ways of reducing costs. 
Therefore, in the long run, only the consumer benefits from cost reductions.
12.6 LEARNING OBJECTIVE
Explain how perfect 
competition leads to economic 
efficiency.
Productive efficiency The situation 
in which a good or service is 
produced at the lowest possible cost.
Solving the Problem
Step 1: Review the chapter material. This problem is about perfect competition and 
efficiency, so you may want to review the section “Perfect Competition and 
Efficiency,” which begins above.
Step 2: Use the concepts from this chapter to explain what Lewis means. By 
“new technologies,” Lewis means new products—such as smart phones or 
LED television sets—or lower-cost ways of producing existing products. 
In either case, new technologies will allow firms to earn economic profits 
for a while, but these profits will lead new firms to enter the market in the 
long run.
Step 3: Use a graph like Figure 12.8 on page 413 to illustrate why the benefits of 
new technologies are “passed right through to consumers free of charge.” 
Figure 12.8 shows the situation in which a firm is making economic profits 
in the short run but has these profits eliminated by entry in the long run. We 
can draw a similar graph to analyze what happens in the long run in the mar-
ket for LED televisions.
Solved Problem 12.6
How Productive Efficiency  
Benefits Consumers
Writing in the New York Times on the technology boom 
of the late 1990s, Michael Lewis argued, “The sad truth, 
for investors, seems to be that most of the benefits of new 
technologies are passed right through to consumers free of 
charge.”
 
a. 
 What do you think Lewis means by the benefits 
of new technology being “passed right through 
to consumers free of charge”? Use a graph like 
 Figure 12.8 on page 413 to illustrate your answer.

Explain why this result is a “sad truth” for investors.

price in the market for LED televisions is P1. Panel (b) shows that at this price, 
the typical firm in the industry is earning an economic profit, which is shown 
by the green-shaded box. The economic profit attracts new firms into the in-
dustry. This entry shifts the market supply curve from S1 to S2 in panel (a) 
and lowers the equilibrium price from P1 to P2. Panel (b) shows that at the 
new market price, P2, the typical firm is breaking even. Therefore, LED tele-
visions are being produced at the lowest possible cost, and productive effi-
ciency is achieved. Consumers receive the new technology “free of charge” in 
the sense that they only have to pay a price equal to the lowest possible cost of 
production.
Step 4: Answer part b. by explaining why the result in part a. is a “sad truth” for 
investors. We have seen in answering part a. that in the long run, firms only 
break even on their investment in producing high-technology goods. That re-
sult implies that investors in these firms are also unlikely to earn an economic 
profit in the long run.
Extra Credit: Lewis is using a key result from this chapter: In the long run, entry of 
new firms competes away economic profits. We should notice that, strictly speaking, 
the high-technology industries Lewis is discussing are not perfectly competitive. Smart 
phones or LED televisions, for instance, are not identical, and each smart phone com-
pany produces a quantity large enough to affect the market price. However, as we will 
see in Chapter 13, these deviations from perfect competition do not change the impor-
tant conclusion that the entry of new firms benefits consumers by forcing prices down 
to the level of average cost. In fact, the price of LED televisions dropped by more than 35 
percent within three years of their first becoming widely available.

C H A P T E R  1 2  Firms in Perfectly Competitive Markets 
Conclusion
The competitive forces of the market impose relentless pressure on firms to produce 
new and better goods and services at the lowest possible cost. Firms that fail to ade-
quately anticipate changes in consumer tastes or that fail to adopt the latest and most 
efficient technology do not survive in the long run. In the nineteenth century, the biolo-
gist Charles Darwin developed a theory of evolution based on the idea of the “survival of 
the fittest.” Only those plants and animals that are best able to adapt to the demands of

Economics in Your Life
Are You an Entrepreneur?
At the beginning of the chapter, we asked you to think about why you can charge only a rela-
tively low price for performing services such as babysitting or lawn mowing. In the chapter, we 
saw that firms selling products in competitive markets can’t charge prices higher than those being 
charged by competing firms. The market for babysitting and lawn mowing is very competitive. In 
most neighborhoods, there are many teenagers willing to supply these services. The price you can 
charge for babysitting may not be worth your while at age 20 but is enough to cover the opportu-
nity cost of a 14-year-old eager to enter the market. (Or, as we put it in Table 12.1 on page 396, the 
ease of entry into babysitting and lawn mowing is high.) So, in your career as a teenage entrepre-
neur, you may have become familiar with one of the lessons of this chapter: A firm in a competi-
tive market has no control over price.
Allocative Efficiency
Not only do perfectly competitive firms produce goods and services at the lowest pos-
sible cost, they also produce the goods and services that consumers value most. Firms 
will produce a good up to the point where the marginal cost of producing another unit 
is equal to the marginal benefit consumers receive from consuming that unit. In other 
words, firms will supply all those goods that provide consumers with a marginal benefit 
at least as great as the marginal cost of producing them. We know this is true because:
 1. The price of a good represents the marginal benefit consumers receive from con-
suming the last unit of the good sold.
 2. Perfectly competitive firms produce up to the point where the price of the good 
equals the marginal cost of producing the last unit.
 3. Therefore, firms produce up to the point where the last unit provides a marginal 
benefit to consumers equal to the marginal cost of producing it.
These statements are another way of saying that entrepreneurs in a market system 
efficiently allocate labor, machinery, and other inputs to produce the goods and services 
that best satisfy consumer wants. In this sense, perfect competition achieves allocative 
efficiency. As we will explore in the next few chapters, many goods and services sold 
in the U.S. economy are not produced in perfectly competitive markets. Nevertheless, 
productive efficiency and allocative efficiency are useful benchmarks against which to 
compare the actual performance of the economy.
Allocative efficiency A state of 
the economy in which production 
represents consumer preferences; in 
particular, every good or service is 
produced up to the point where the 
last unit provides a marginal benefit 
to consumers equal to the marginal 
cost of producing it.

 
Conclusion

their environment are able to survive. Darwin first realized the important role that the 
struggle for existence plays in the natural world after reading early nineteenth- century 
economists’ descriptions of the role it plays in the economic world. Just as “survival of 
the fittest” is the rule in nature, so it is in the economic world.
At the start of this chapter, we saw that there are four market structures: perfect 
competition, monopolistic competition, oligopoly, and monopoly. Now that we have 
studied perfect competition, in the following chapters we move on to the other three 
market structures. Before turning to those chapters, read An Inside Look on the next 
page for a discussion of the reasons for the decline in organic farming in the United 
Kingdom.

Scotland which show a massive de-
cline in the acreage under organic 
production since the early 2000s.
Last year, across the UK, only 
51,000 hectares were in “conversion”—
the process farmers need to go through 
to have their land and practices certi-
fied as organic. That is less than half 
the amount of land in conversion in 
2009, itself down markedly from the 
2007 peak of 158,000 hectares. . . .
 For livestock farmers, the pic-
ture is mixed. The number of cattle 
reared organically has risen steadily, 
to more than 350,000 last year. But 
despite widespread publicity by food 
campaigners on the claimed benefits 
of choosing free range or organic eggs 
and chickens, more than half a mil-
lion fewer organic chickens, turkeys 
and other poultry were produced in 
the UK last year.
Amid falling sales overall, some 
specialists are thriving. Abel & Cole, 
the organic box scheme, expects a 
40% increase in sales this year. Keith 
Abel attributes this to the same reason 
he believes organic sales have fallen 
overall—because the big supermar-
kets have taken organic products off 
the shelves to make room for cheaper 
non-organic goods. “It is a self-fulfill-
ing prophecy: they take them off the 
shelves, and they sell less,” he said. 
“But that’s great news for me.”

drop: The economic downturn means organic 
farmers are less likely to reap rewards of premium 
prices for their produce,” by Fiona Harvey from

little or no costs for fertilisers and 
pesticides, and—at least on smaller 
farms—most animals fed on grass 
rather than expensive grain, organic 
farmers can make savings at a time 
of high commodity prices. Adrian 
Dolby, of Barrington Park, said cut-
ting input prices was one of his key 
reasons for putting 7,000 acres under 
organic cultivation in 2005.
“If we hadn’t gone organic, we 
would have gone out of business,” 
added Tom Rigby, who farms 160 
acres near Warrington, most of it given 
over to pasture. “We are a small dairy 
farm and small dairy farmers are go-
ing bankrupt every day. I decided that 
if I was going to go bankrupt, I would 
rather do it in the way I wanted.”
Rigby knows of larger producers 
that have quit organic methods, such 
as some bigger dairy farms that found 
their margins squeezed even on pre-
mium organic milk as they needed to 
import increasingly expensive feed. 
His smaller grass-fed herd avoids this 
problem, and his organically culti-
vated vegetables will be sold to Man-
chester University.
 Oliver Dowding, an organic 
farmer near Wincanton in Somerset 
for more than 20 years, blamed wan-
ing interest among farmers on the 
numbers who entered organic cul-
tivation several years ago, attracted 
by government grants to convert 
their land and the offers of subsidies, 
and who have since reverted to con-
ventional farming as the financial 
support has dried up. This is a wide-
spread view among organic farmers, 
and seems borne out by figures from 
Farmers Turn Away 
from Organic as 
Sales Drop
Farmers have begun to turn away 
from organic food production in the 
face of waning interest from the big 
supermarkets.
The amount of land being con-
verted to organic cultivation across the 
UK has dropped by two-thirds since 
2007, according to statistics released 
by the Department for Environment, 
Food and Rural Affairs, as falling sales 
of organic products mean fewer farm-
ers are seeing a reason to change.
 Sales of organic products fell by 
5.9% in the UK last year, according 
to the Soil Association, from £1.8bn 
in 2009 to £1.7bn. That continued a 
decline from record sales of £2.1bn 
in 2008, and came amid rising food 
prices. The amount of organic poultry 
being produced has also fallen steadily.
But many farmers who have gone 
organic were defiant after publica-
tion of the latest figures, arguing that 
switching to greener methods has 
drastically cut their costs and that 
consumer interest is still strong, par-
ticularly when farmers can use sales 
routes other than big supermarket 
chains.
“There might be lots of farmers 
who think they can’t afford to go or-
ganic, because they think the market 
is restricted, but if they looked into it 
they would find it can be cost-effec-
tive,” said Ian Noble, who represents 
a 12-farm cooperative in south Devon 
growing organic vegetables. With

declining sales in the United Kingdom, or-
ganic cattle production has continued to 
rise to keep pace with growing sales. As 
long as demand continues to increase and 
organic cattle producers make an eco-
nomic profit, more producers will have the 
incentive to enter the market. If the de-
mand starts to decrease, though, as it did 
in other organic markets, we would ex-
pect to eventually see producers of or-
ganic cattle begin to exit this market as 
well.
Thinking Critically
1. The article states that due to declining 
product demand, farmers are convert-
ing from organic production back to 
conventional methods. Show what will 
happen in Figure 1 as some farmers 
exit the organic market, and show how 
this change will affect the farmer repre-
sented by Figure 2.
2. The article indicates that in addition 
to the decline in demand, the end of 
government grants and subsidies has 
contributed to the number of farmers 
leaving the organic market. How would 
government grants and subsidies affect 
this market?
However, the recession coupled with rising 
food prices had a negative effect on the 
market for organic food, and sales have de-
clined each year since 2008. The decline in 
sales is due to a decrease in the overall de-
mand for organic products. Figure 1 shows 
the market for organically grown corn. The 
decrease in demand is illustrated as a shift 
from D1 to D2, where both the equilibrium 
quantity and equilibrium market price 
decline.
b With sales falling, fewer farmers are 
converting to organic production, and 
some of those who had switched to or-
ganic are now reverting to conventional 
farming methods. The chapter notes that 
some firms exit a market when they experi-
ence economic losses. The decrease in 
demand in Figure 1 causes the price to 
 decrease from P1 to P2. This decrease in 
price causes the individual farmer’s 
 demand curve to shift from D1 to D2 in 
 Figure 2. The price per bushel decreases, 
and the farmer reduces production from q1 
to q2. At the lower market price of P2, the 
farmer has an economic loss represented 
by the area of the shaded box. Some farm-
ers suffering losses will choose to exit the 
market.
c While organic produce and poultry 
farmers have been experiencing  
Key Points in the Article
Since reaching a peak in 2008, organic food 
production and sales in the United Kingdom 
have steadily fallen, as has the amount of 
land farmers have converted to organic cul-
tivation. The recession has been cited as a 
reason for the drop in sales, with large su-
permarkets cutting back on their organic 
selections. With sales numbers declining, 
many farmers have found it more difficult to 
justify the added expense of converting to 
organic production. Some farmers who had 
switched to organic when the British gov-
ernment was subsidizing conversion and 
production have since gone back to con-
ventional methods now that subsidies have 
declined. While organic produce sales have 
declined in the United Kingdom, organic 
livestock sales have been mixed, with cattle 
production on the rise but poultry produc-
tion falling.
Analyzing the News
a Organic products usually command a 
higher price than their non-organic 
counterparts, and up until 2008, the de-
mand for organic food was increasing in the 
United Kingdom. The potential for higher 
profits attracted many farmers to the or-
ganic market as demand was increasing.

Summary
A perfectly competitive market must have many buyers and sellers, 
firms must be producing identical products, and there must be no 
barriers to entry of new firms. The demand curve for a good or ser-
vice produced in a perfectly competitive market is downward slop-
ing, but the demand curve for the output of one firm in a perfectly 
competitive market is a horizontal line at the market price. Firms 
in perfectly competitive markets are price takers and see their sales 
drop to zero if they attempt to charge more than the market price.

Explain whether you agree or disagree with the following 
remark:
According to the model of perfectly competi-
tive markets, the demand for wheat should be 
a horizontal line. But this can’t be true: When 
the price of wheat rises, the quantity of wheat 
demanded falls, and when the price of wheat 
falls, the quantity of wheat demanded rises. 
Therefore, the demand for wheat is not a hori-
zontal line.
 
1.7 The financial writer Andrew Tobias described an inci-
dent that occurred when he was a student at the Harvard 
Business School: Each student in the class was given large 
amounts of information about a particular firm and asked 
to determine a pricing strategy for the firm. Most of the stu-
dents spent hours preparing their answers and came to class 
carrying many sheets of paper with their calculations. To-
bias came up with the correct answer after just a few min-
utes and without having made any calculations. When his 
professor called on him in class for an answer, Tobias stated, 
“The case said the XYZ Company was in a very competi-
tive industry . . . and the case said that the company had 
all the business it could handle.” Given this information, 
what price do you think Tobias argued the company should 
charge? Briefly explain. (Tobias says the class greeted his 
answer with “thunderous applause.”)

Summary
Profit is the difference between total revenue (TR) and total cost 
(TC). Average revenue (AR) is total revenue divided by the quan-
tity of the product sold. A firm maximizes profit by producing the 
level of output where the difference between revenue and cost is 
the greatest. This is the same level of output where marginal rev-
enue is equal to marginal cost. Marginal revenue (MR) is the 
change in total revenue from selling one more unit.

Review Questions
 
2.1 Explain why it is true that for a firm in a perfectly competi-
tive market, P = MR = AR.
 
2.2 Explain why if the difference between TR and TC is at its 
maximum positive value, then MR must equal MC.
 
2.3 Explain why it is true that for a firm in a perfectly competi-
tive market, the profit-maximizing condition MR = MC 
is equivalent to the condition P = MC.
Problems and Applications
 
2.4 A student argues: “To maximize profit, a firm should 
produce the quantity where the difference between mar-
ginal revenue and marginal cost is the greatest. If a firm 
produces more than this quantity, then the profit made 
on each additional unit will be falling.” Briefly explain 
whether you agree with this reasoning.
 
2.5 Why don’t firms maximize revenue rather than profit? If 
a firm decided to maximize revenue, would it be likely to 
produce a smaller or larger quantity than if it were maxi-
mizing profit? Briefly explain.
 
2.6 Refer to Table 12.2 on page 400 and Table 12.3 on page 401. 
Suppose the price of wheat rises to $7.00 per bushel. How 
many bushels of wheat will Farmer Parker produce, and 
how much profit will he make? Briefly explain.
 
2.7 Refer to Table 12.2 and Table 12.3. Suppose that the mar-
ginal cost of wheat is $0.50 higher for every bushel of wheat 
produced. For example, the marginal cost of producing the 
eighth bushel of wheat is now $7.50. Assume that the price 
of wheat remains $4 per bushel. Will this increase in mar-
ginal cost change the profit-maximizing level of produc-
tion for Farmer Parker? Briefly explain. How much profit 
will Farmer Parker make now?
 
2.8 In Table 12.3, what are Farmer Parker’s fixed costs? Sup-
pose that his fixed costs increase by $1. Will this increase 
in fixed cost change the profit-maximizing level of produc-
tion for Farmer Parker? Briefly explain. How much profit 
will Farmer Parker make now?
Summary
From the definitions of profit and average total cost, we can develop 
the following expression for the relationship between total profit 
and average total cost: Profit = (P - ATC) * Q. Using this ex-
pression, we can determine the area showing profit or loss on a cost-
curve graph: The area of profit or loss is a box with a height equal 
to price minus average total cost (for profit) or average total cost 
minus price (for loss) and a base equal to the quantity of output.

Summary
In deciding whether to shut down or produce during a given pe-
riod, a firm should ignore its sunk costs. A sunk cost is a cost that 
has already been paid and that cannot be recovered. In the short 
run, a firm continues to produce as long as its price is at least equal 
to its average variable cost. A perfectly competitive firm’s shutdown 
point is the minimum point on the firm’s average variable cost 
curve. If price falls below average variable cost, the firm shuts down 
in the short run. For prices above the shutdown point, a perfectly 
competitive firm’s marginal cost curve is also its supply curve.

4.8 [Related to Solved Problem 12.4 on page 408] Suppose 
you decide to open a copy store. You rent store space (sign-
ing a one-year lease to do so), and you take out a loan at a 
local bank and use the money to purchase 10 copiers. Six 
months later, a large chain opens a copy store two blocks 
away from yours. As a result, the revenue you receive from 
your copy store, while sufficient to cover the wages of your 
employees and the costs of paper and utilities, doesn’t 
cover all your rent and the interest and repayment costs on 
the loan you took out to purchase the copiers. Should you 
continue operating your business?
 
4.9 [Related to Solved Problem 12.4 on page 408] An ar-
ticle in the Wall Street Journal discussed problems some 
shopping malls were having retaining stores. According to 
the article, some stores that were currently losing money 
were considering not “sticking around once their leases 
expire.” If the owner of a store that leases space in a mall 
is suffering a loss at that location, why wouldn’t the owner 
close the store right away rather than wait until the lease 
expires?

Summary
Economic profit is a firm’s revenues minus all its costs, implicit 
and explicit. Economic loss is the situation in which a firm’s to-
tal revenue is less than its total cost, including all implicit costs. 
If firms make economic profits in the short run, new firms enter 
the industry until the market price has fallen enough to wipe out 
the profits. If firms make economic losses, firms exit the industry 
until the market price has risen enough to wipe out the losses. 
Long-run competitive equilibrium is the situation in which the 
entry and exit of firms has resulted in the typical firm breaking 
even. The long-run supply curve shows the relationship between 
market price and the quantity supplied.

 5.11 In July 2011, National Public Radio ran a story about the 
new gold rush. It reported:
The price of gold in the international market 
is steadily rising: more than fivefold in the past 
decade alone. It’s currently selling for about 
$1,500 an ounce, paving the way for a new gold 
rush. Ten old mines have reopened in remote 
mountain and desert areas of the American 
West over the past decade.
 
 The story also reported about twenty-first-century mining 
techniques. It stated:
This is not 19th century gold mining—no pick 
axes or panning here. This dirt (after being 
blasted with dynamite) has a low concentra-
tion of gold, which is sprayed with a cyanide 
solution so the gold particles can be separated 
from the carbon, a process known as heap 
leaching.
 
a. The new gold rush is not just in the United States. It is 
also in  Australia, Africa, Asia, and elsewhere. Why are 
so many firms around the globe mining for gold?
 
b. For a given demand for gold, over time what will the 
entry of all these firms into gold mining do to the price 
of gold and the economic profits from gold mining?

 5.12 Suppose that the laptop computer industry is perfectly 
competitive and that the firms that assemble laptops do 
not also make the displays, or screens. Suppose that the 
laptop display industry is also perfectly competitive. Fi-
nally, suppose that because the demand for laptop displays 
is currently relatively small, firms in the laptop display 
industry have not been able to take advantage of all the 
economies of scale in laptop display production. Use a 
graph of the laptop computer market to illustrate the long-
run effects on equilibrium price and quantity in the laptop 
computer market of a substantial and sustained increase 
in the demand for laptop computers. Use another graph to 
show the effect on the cost curves of a typical firm in the 
laptop computer industry. Briefly explain your graphs. Do 
your graphs indicate that the laptop computer industry is 
a constant-cost industry, an increasing-cost industry, or a

5.1 When are firms likely to enter an industry? When are they 
likely to exit an industry?
 
5.2 Would a firm earning zero economic profit continue to 
produce, even in the long run?
 
5.3 Discuss the shape of the long-run supply curve in a per-

5.4 Suppose an assistant professor of economics is earning a 
salary of $75,000 per year. One day she quits her job, sells 
$100,000 worth of bonds that had been earning 5 percent 
per year, and uses the funds to open a bookstore. At the 
end of the year, she shows an accounting profit of $90,000 
on her income tax return. What is her economic profit?
 
5.5 Why does the entry of firms into an industry decrease the 
economic profits of the existing firms? Why does the exit 
of firms from an industry increase the economic profits of 
the existing firms?
 
5.6 Consider the following statement: “The products for which 
demand is the greatest will also be the products that are 
most profitable to produce.” Briefly explain whether you 
agree with this statement.

the price falls to $7. At this price and this output level, she 
is operating at a loss. Why doesn’t she just continue charg-
ing the original $10 and continue producing 8,000 boxes 
of carrots?

 5.10 A student in a principles of economics course makes the 
following remark:
The economic model of perfectly competitive 
markets is fine in theory but not very realistic. 
It predicts that in the long run, a firm in a per-
fectly competitive market will earn no profits. 
No firm in the real world would stay in busi-
ness if it earned zero profits.
 
 Do you agree with this remark?

 
Chapter Summary and Problems

Summary
Perfect competition results in productive efficiency, which means 
that goods and services are produced at the lowest possible cost. 
Perfect competition also results in allocative efficiency, which 
means the goods and services are produced up to the point where 
the last unit provides a marginal benefit to consumers equal to the 
marginal cost of producing it.

6.4 The chapter states, “Firms will supply all those goods that 
provide consumers with a marginal benefit at least as great 
as the marginal cost of producing them.” A student objects 
to this statement, arguing, “I doubt that firms will really do 
this. After all, firms are in business to make a profit; they 
don’t care about what is best for consumers.” Evaluate the 
student’s argument.
 
6.5 [Related to Solved Problem 12.6 on page 418] Discuss 
the following statement: “In a perfectly competitive mar-
ket, in the long run consumers benefit from reductions 
in costs, but firms don’t.” Don’t firms also benefit from 
cost reductions because they are able to earn greater 
profits?
 
6.6 [Related to Solved Problem 12.6 on page 418] Suppose 
you read the following item in a newspaper article, under 
the headline “Price Gouging Alleged in Pencil Market”:
Consumer advocacy groups charged at a press 
conference yesterday that there is widespread 
price gouging in the sale of pencils. They re-
leased a study showing that whereas the average 
retail price of pencils was $1.00, the average cost 
of producing pencils was only $0.50.  “Pencils 
can be produced without complicated machin-
ery or highly skilled workers, so there is no jus-
tification for companies charging a price that is 
twice what it costs them to produce the prod-
uct. Pencils are too important in the life of ev-
ery American for us to tolerate this sort of price 
gouging any longer,” said George Grommet, 
chief spokesperson for the consumer groups. 
The consumer groups advocate passage of a law 
that would allow companies selling pencils to 
charge a price no more than 20 percent greater 
than their average cost of production.
 
 Do you believe such a law would be advisable in a situation 
like this? Explain.

6.8 Although New York State is second only to Washington 
State in production of apples, its production has been 
declining during the past 20 years. The decline has been 
particularly steep in counties close to New York City. In 
1985, there were more than 11,000 acres of apple orchards 
in Ulster County, which is 75 miles north of New York 
City. Today, only about 6,000 acres remain. As it became 
difficult for apple growers in the county to compete with 
lower-cost producers elsewhere, the resources these en-
trepreneurs were using to produce apples— particularly 
land—became more valuable in other uses. Many farm-
ers sold their land to housing developers. Suppose a 
 nutritionist develops a revolutionary new diet that in-
volves eating 10 apples per day. The new diet becomes 
wildly popular. What effect is the new diet likely to have 
on the number of apple orchards within 100 miles of New 
York City? What effect is the diet likely to have on housing 
prices in New York City?

Economics in Your Life
Opening Your Own Restaurant
After you graduate, you plan to realize your dream of opening your own Italian restaurant. You are 
confident that many people will enjoy the pasta prepared with your grandmother’s secret sauce. Al-
though your hometown already has three Italian restaurants, you are convinced that you can enter 
this market and make a profit.
You have many choices to make in operating your restaurant. Will it be “family style,” with 
sturdy but inexpensive furniture, where families with small—and noisy!—children will feel wel-
come, or will it be more elegant, with nice furniture, tablecloths, and candles? Will you offer a full 
menu or concentrate on pasta dishes that use your grandmother’s secret sauce? These and other 
choices you make will distinguish your restaurant from competitors. What’s likely to happen in the 
restaurant market in your hometown after you open? How successful are you likely to be? See if 
you can answer these questions as you read this chapter. You can check your answers against those 
we provide on page 448 at the end of this chapter.
markets. These markets share three key 
characteristics:
1. There are many firms.
2. All firms sell identical products.
3.  There are no barriers to new firms enter-
ing the industry.
The market Starbucks competes in shares two 
of these characteristics: There are many coffee-
houses, and the barriers to entering the mar-
ket are very low. But the coffee at Starbucks is 
not identical to what competing coffeehouses 
offer. Selling coffee in coffeehouses is not like 
selling wheat: The products that Starbucks 
and its competitors sell are differentiated rather 
than identical. So, the coffeehouse market is 
monopolistically competitive rather than per-
fectly competitive. As we will see, most mo-
nopolistically competitive firms are unable to 
earn economic profits in the long run.
AN INSIDE LOOK on page 450 
 des cribes how Starbucks acquired a juice 
maker to expand into areas outside the cof-
fee business.
Based on Claire Cain Miller, “A Changed Starbucks.  A 
Changed C.E.O.,” New York Times, March 12, 2011.
Like many other large firms, Starbucks 
started small. In 1971, entrepreneurs 
 Gordon Bowker, Gerald Baldwin, and Zev 
Siegl opened the first Starbucks in Seattle, 
 Washington. Current CEO Howard Schultz 
joined the company 10 years later. Schultz 
realized that many consumers wanted a cof-
feehouse where they could sit, relax, read, 
chat, and drink higher-quality coffee than 
was typically served in diners or donut 
shops. Designing Starbucks coffeehouses to 
provide this experience was the key to his 
success. But it was not difficult for other cof-
feehouses to copy the Starbucks approach.
By 2009, fierce competition and a weak 
economy led Starbucks to close hundreds of 
stores and cut prices as it tried to overcome 
the impression that it was the “home of the 
$4 coffee.” Starbucks became profitable once 
more in 2010, partly due to expansion of its 
overseas markets. Schultz realizes that his 
company faces a constant challenge to stay 
ahead of its competitors and satisfy its cus-
tomers: “I feel it’s so important to remind us 
all of how fleeting success . . . can be.”

ation of firms in perfectly competitive

any markets in the U.S. economy are similar to the coffeehouse market: They 
have many buyers and sellers, and the barriers to entry are low, but the goods 
and services offered for sale are differentiated rather than identical. Exam-
ples of these markets include consumer electronics stores, restaurants, movie 
theaters, supermarkets, and manufacturing men’s and women’s clothing. In fact, the majority 
of the firms you patronize are competing in monopolistically competitive markets.
In Chapter 12, we saw how perfect competition benefits consumers and results in economic 
efficiency. Will these same desirable outcomes also hold for monopolistically competitive mar-
kets? This question is important because monopolistically competitive markets are common.
Demand and Marginal Revenue for a Firm 
in a Monopolistically Competitive Market
If the Starbucks coffeehouse located a mile from where you live raises the price of a caffè 
latte from $3.00 to $3.25, it will lose some, but not all, of its customers. Some customers 
will switch to buying their coffee at another store, but other customers will be willing to 
pay the higher price for a variety of reasons: This store may be closer to them, or they 
may prefer Starbucks caffè lattes to similar coffees at competing stores. Because changing 
the price affects the quantity of caffè lattes sold, a Starbucks store will face a downward- 
sloping demand curve rather than the horizontal demand curve that a wheat farmer faces.
The Demand Curve for a Monopolistically 
Competitive Firm
Figure 13.1 shows how a change in price affects the quantity of caffè lattes Starbucks 
sells. The increase in the price from $3.00 to $3.25 decreases the quantity of caffè lattes 
sold from 3,000 per week to 2,400 per week.
Marginal Revenue for a Firm with a  
Downward-Sloping Demand Curve
Recall from Chapter 12 that for a firm in a perfectly competitive market, the demand 
curve and the marginal revenue curve are the same. A perfectly competitive firm faces 
a horizontal demand curve and does not have to cut the price to sell a larger quantity. A 
monopolistically competitive firm, on the other hand, must cut the price to sell more, 
so its marginal revenue curve will slope downward and will be below its demand curve.
The data in Table 13.1 illustrate this point. To keep the numbers simple, let’s assume 
that your local Starbucks coffeehouse is very small and sells at most 10 caffè lattes per 
Monopolistic competition A market 
structure in which barriers to entry 
are low and many firms compete 
by selling similar, but not identical, 
products.

Explain why a monopolistically

downward-sloping demand 
and marginal revenue curves.
Figure 13.1 
The Downward-Sloping 
Demand for Caffè Lattes  
at a Starbucks
If a Starbucks increases the price of caffè 
lattes, it will lose some, but not all, of its cus-
tomers. In this case, raising the price from 
$3.00 to $3.25 reduces the quantity of caffè 
lattes sold from 3,000 to 2,400. Therefore, 
unlike a perfect competitor, a Starbucks 
 coffeehouse faces a downward-sloping 
 demand curve.

week. If Starbucks charges a price of $6.00 or more, all of its potential customers will 
buy their coffee somewhere else. If it charges $5.50, it will sell 1 caffè latte per week. For 
each additional $0.50 Starbucks reduces the price, it increases the number of caffè lattes 
it sells by 1. The third column in the table shows how the firm’s total revenue changes 
as it sells more caffè lattes. The fourth column shows the firm’s revenue per unit, or its 
average revenue. Average revenue is equal to total revenue divided by quantity. Because 
total revenue equals price multiplied by quantity, dividing by quantity leaves just price. 
Therefore, average revenue is always equal to price. This result will be true for firms sell-
ing in any of the four market structures we discussed in Chapter 12.
The last column shows the firm’s marginal revenue, or the amount that total rev-
enue changes as the firm sells 1 more caffè latte. For a perfectly competitive firm, the ad-
ditional revenue received from selling 1 more unit is just equal to the price. That will not 
be true for Starbucks because to sell another caffè latte, it has to reduce the price. When 
the firm cuts the price by $0.50, one good thing and one bad thing happen:
• 
The good thing. It sells 1 more caffè latte; we can call this the output effect.
• 
The bad thing. It receives $0.50 less for each caffè latte that it could have sold at the 
higher price; we can call this the price effect.
Figure 13.2 illustrates what happens when the firm cuts the price from $3.50 to 
$3.00. Selling the sixth caffè latte adds the $3.00 price to the firm’s revenue; this is the

How a Price Cut Affects  
a Firm’s Revenue
If a local Starbucks reduces the price of a 
caffè latte from $3.50 to $3.00, the number 
of caffè lattes it sells per week will increase 
from 5 to 6. Its marginal revenue from sell-
ing the sixth caffè latte will be $0.50, which 
is equal to the $3.00 additional revenue 
from selling 1 more caffè latte (the area of 
the green box) minus the $2.50 loss in rev-
enue from selling the first 5 caffè lattes for 
$0.50 less each (the area of the red box).

output effect. But Starbucks now receives a price of $3.00, rather than $3.50, on the first 
5 caffè lattes sold; this is the price effect. As a result of the price effect, the firm’s revenue 
on these 5 caffè lattes is $2.50 less than it would have been if the price had remained at 
$3.50. So, the firm has gained $3.00 in revenue on the sixth caffè latte and lost $2.50 in 
revenue on the first 5 caffè lattes, for a net change in revenue of $0.50. Marginal revenue 
is the change in total revenue from selling 1 more unit. Therefore, the marginal revenue 
of the sixth caffè latte is $0.50. Notice that the marginal revenue of the sixth unit is far 
below its price of $3.00. In fact, for each additional caffè latte Starbucks sells, marginal 
revenue will be less than price. There is an important general point: Every firm that has 
the ability to affect the price of the good or service it sells will have a marginal revenue 
curve that is below its demand curve. Only firms in perfectly competitive markets, which 
can sell as many units as they want at the market price, have marginal revenue curves 
that are the same as their demand curves.
Figure 13.3 shows the relationship between the demand curve and the marginal 
revenue curve for the local Starbucks. Notice that after the sixth caffè latte, marginal 
revenue becomes negative. Marginal revenue is negative because the additional revenue 
received from selling 1 more caffè latte is smaller than the revenue lost from receiving a 
lower price on the caffè lattes that could have been sold at the original price.
How a Monopolistically Competitive Firm 
Maximizes Profit in the Short Run
All firms use the same approach to maximize profits: They produce where marginal rev-
enue is equal to marginal cost. For the local Starbucks, this means selling the quantity of 
caffè lattes for which the last caffè latte sold adds the same amount to the firm’s revenue 
as to its costs. To begin our discussion of how monopolistically competitive firms maxi-
mize profits, let’s consider the situation the local Starbucks faces in the short run. Recall 
from Chapter 11 that in the short run, at least one factor of production is fixed, and 
there is not enough time for new firms to enter the market. A Starbucks has many costs,

How a Monopolistically Competitive Firm Maximizes Profit in the Short Run 
435
including the cost of purchasing the ingredients for its caffè lattes and other coffees, the 
electricity it uses, and the wages of its employees. Recall that a firm’s marginal cost is the 
increase in total cost resulting from producing another unit of output. We have seen 
that for many firms, marginal cost has a U shape. We will assume that the marginal cost 
curve for this Starbucks has the usual shape.
In the table in Figure 13.4, we bring together for this Starbucks the revenue data 
from Table 13.1 with the firm’s cost data. The graphs in Figure 13.4 plot the data from 
the table. In panel (a), we see how Starbucks can determine its profit-maximizing quan-
tity and price. As long as the marginal cost of selling 1 more caffè latte is less than the 
marginal revenue, the firm should sell additional caffè lattes. For example, increasing 
the quantity of caffè lattes sold from 3 per week to 4 per week increases marginal cost

 Figure 13. 4  Maximizing Profit in a Monopolistically Competitive Market
To maximize profit, a Starbucks coffeehouse wants to sell caffè lattes up to the 
point where the marginal revenue from selling the last caffè latte is just equal to 
the marginal cost. As the table shows, this happens with the fifth caffè latte—
point A in panel (a)—which adds $1.50 to the firm’s costs and $1.50 to its rev-
enues. The firm then uses the demand curve to find the price that will lead 
consumers to buy this quantity of caffè lattes (point B). In panel (b), the green 
box represents the firm’s profits. The box has a height equal to $1.00, which is the 
$3.50 price minus the average total cost of $2.50, and it has a base equal to the 
quantity of 5 caffè lattes. So, this Starbucks’s profit equals $1 × 5 = $5.00.

C H A P T E R  1 3  Monopolistic Competition: The Competitive Model in a More Realistic Setting  
Solved Problem 13.2
Does Minimizing Cost Maximize Profits?
Suppose Apple finds that the relationship between the av-
erage total cost of producing iPhones and the quantity of 
iPhones produced is as shown in the following graph.
Will Apple maximize profits if it produces 800,000 iPhones 
per month? Briefly explain.
by $1.00 but increases marginal revenue by $2.50. So, the firm’s profits are increased by 
$1.50 as a result of selling the fourth caffè latte.
As Starbucks sells more caffè lattes, rising marginal cost eventually equals marginal 
revenue, and the firm sells the profit-maximizing quantity of caffè lattes. Marginal cost 
equals marginal revenue with the fifth caffè latte, which adds $1.50 to the firm’s costs 
and $1.50 to its revenues—point A in panel (a) of Figure 13.4. The demand curve tells 
us the price at which the firm is able to sell 5 caffè lattes per week. In Figure 13.4, if we 
draw a vertical line from 5 caffè lattes up to the demand curve, we can see that the price 
at which the firm can sell 5 caffè lattes per week is $3.50 (point B). We can conclude that 
for Starbucks, the profit-maximizing quantity is 5 caffè lattes, and the profit- maximizing 
price is $3.50. If the firm sells more than 5 caffè lattes per week, its profits fall. For ex-
ample, selling a sixth caffè latte adds $2.00 to its costs and only $0.50 to its revenues. So, 
its profit would fall from $5.00 to $3.50.
Panel (b) adds the average total cost curve for Starbucks. The panel shows that the 
average total cost of selling 5 caffè lattes is $2.50. Recall from Chapter 12 that:
Profit = (P - ATC) * Q.
In this case, profit 5 ($3.50 2 $2.50) 3 5 5 $5.00. The green box in panel (b) shows the 
amount of profit. The box has a base equal to Q and a height equal to (P 2 ATC), so its 
area equals profit.
Notice that, unlike a perfectly competitive firm, which produces where P 5 MC, 
a monopolistically competitive firm produces where P . MC. In this case, Starbucks 
is charging a price of $3.50, although marginal cost is $1.50. For a perfectly competi-
tive firm, price equals marginal revenue, P 5 MR. Therefore, to fulfill the MR 5 MC 
condition for profit maximization, a perfectly competitive firm will produce where P 5 
MC. Because P . MR for a monopolistically competitive firm—which results from the 
marginal revenue curve being below the demand curve—a monopolistically competi-
tive firm will maximize profits where P . MC.

What Happens to Profits in the Long Run? 
437
Solving the Problem
Step 1: Review the chapter material. This problem is about how monopolistically 
competitive firms maximize profits, so you may want to review the section 
“How a Monopolistically Competitive Firm Maximizes Profits in the Short 
Run,” which begins on page 434.
Step 2: Discuss the relationship between minimizing costs and maximizing 
 profits. Firms often talk about the steps they take to reduce costs. The  figure 
shows that by producing 800,000 iPhones per month, Apple will minimize 
its average cost of production. But remember that minimizing cost is not the 
firm’s ultimate goal; the firm’s ultimate goal is to maximize profits. Depending 
on demand, a firm may maximize profits by producing a quantity that is either 
larger or smaller than the quantity that would minimize average total cost.
Step 3: Draw a graph that shows Apple maximizing profit at a quantity where aver-
age cost is not minimized. Note that in the graph, average cost reaches a mini-
mum at a quantity of 800,000, but profits are maximized at a quantity of 600,000.

What Happens to Profits in the Long Run?
Remember that a firm makes an economic profit when its total revenue is greater than 
all of its costs, including the opportunity cost of the funds invested in the firm by its 
owners. Because cost curves include the owners’ opportunity costs, the Starbucks cof-
feehouse represented in Figure 13.4 on page 435 is making an economic profit. This 
economic profit gives entrepreneurs an incentive to enter this market and establish new 
firms. If a Starbucks is earning an economic profit selling caffè lattes, new coffeehouses 
are likely to open in the same area.
How Does the Entry of New Firms Affect  
the Profits of Existing Firms?
As new coffeehouses open near a local Starbucks, the firm’s demand curve will shift to the 
left. The demand curve will shift because the Starbucks will sell fewer caffè lattes at each 
price when there are additional coffeehouses in the area selling similar drinks. The demand 
curve will also become more elastic because consumers have additional coffeehouses from 
which to buy coffee, so the Starbucks will lose more sales if it raises its prices. Figure 13.5 
shows how the demand curve for the local Starbucks shifts as new firms enter its market.

C H A P T E R  1 3  Monopolistic Competition: The Competitive Model in a More Realistic Setting  
Don’t Confuse Zero Economic Profit  
with Zero Accounting Profit
Remember that economists count the opportunity cost of 
the owner’s investment in a firm as a cost. For example, 
suppose you invest $200,000 opening a pizza parlor, and 
the return you could earn on those funds each year in a 
similar investment—such as opening a sandwich shop—is 
10 percent. Therefore, the annual opportunity cost of in-
vesting the funds in your own business is 10 percent of 
$200,000, or $20,000. This $20,000 is part of your profit 
in the accounting sense, and you would have to pay taxes 
on it. But in an economic sense, the $20,000 is a cost. In 
long-run equilibrium, we would expect that entry of new 
firms would keep you from earning more than 10 percent 
on your investment. So, you would end up breaking even 
and earning zero economic profit, even though you were 
earning an accounting profit of $20,000.

Your Turn: Test your understanding by doing related 
problem 3.6 on page 455 at the end of this chapter.
Don’t Let This Happen to You
In panel (a) of Figure 13.5, the short-run demand curve shows the relationship 
 between the price of caffè lattes and the quantity of caffè lattes Starbucks sells per week 
before the entry of new firms. With this demand curve, Starbucks can charge a price 
above average total cost—shown as point A in panel (a)—and make a profit. But this 
profit attracts additional coffeehouses to the area and shifts the demand curve for the 
Starbucks caffè lattes to the left. As long as Starbucks is making an economic profit, there 
is an incentive for additional coffeehouses to open in the area, and the demand curve will 
continue shifting to the left. As panel (b) shows, eventually the demand curve will have 
shifted to the point where it is just touching—or tangent to—the average total cost curve.
In the long run, at the point at which the demand curve is tangent to the average 
cost curve, price is equal to average total cost (point B), the firm is breaking even, and 
it no longer earns an economic profit. In the long run, the demand curve is also more 
elastic because the more coffeehouses there are in the area, the more sales Starbucks will 
lose to other coffeehouses if it raises its price.
 Figure 13.5  How Entry of New Firms Eliminates Profits
Panel (a) shows that in the short run, the local Starbucks faces the demand and 
marginal revenue curves labeled “Short run.” With this demand curve, Starbucks 
can charge a price above average total cost (point A) and make a profit, shown by 
the green rectangle. But this profit attracts new firms to enter the market, which 
shifts the demand and marginal revenue curves to the curves labeled “Long run” 
in panel (b). Because price is now equal to average total cost (point B), Starbucks 
breaks even and no longer earns an economic profit.

Of course, it is possible that a monopolistically competitive firm will suffer an 
economic loss in the short run. As a consequence, the owners of the firm will not be 
covering the opportunity cost of their investment. We expect that, in the long run, 
firms will exit an industry if they are suffering economic losses. If firms exit, the 
demand curve for the output of a remaining firm will shift to the right. This process 
will continue until the representative firm in the industry is able to charge a price 
equal to its average cost and break even. Therefore, in the long run, monopolisti-
cally competitive firms will experience neither economic profits nor economic losses.

C H A P T E R  1 3  Monopolistic Competition: The Competitive Model in a More Realistic Setting  
The Rise and Decline  
and Rise of Starbucks
In the spring of 2009, an article from Bloomberg News 
summed up the situation that Starbucks was in: “After more 
than a decade of sensational buzz, Starbucks is struggling nationwide as it faces slowing 
sales growth and increased competition.” The initial success and later struggles of Star-
bucks are a familiar pattern for firms in monopolistically com-
petitive markets.
When Starbucks began rapidly expanding, CEO Howard 
Schultz knew that fresh-brewed coffee was widely available in 
restaurants, diners, and donut shops. He believed, though, that 
he had a strategy that would differentiate Starbucks from com-
petitors: Starbucks would offer a European espresso bar atmo-
sphere, with large, comfortable chairs, music playing, and groups 
of friends dropping in and out during the day. From the mid-
1990s through the mid-2000s, this strategy worked very well, 
and Starbucks opened nearly 17,000 stores worldwide. But Star-
bucks’s profitability attracted competitors. Other nationwide 
chains, such as Caribou Coffee and Diedrich Coffee, and regional 
chains, such as Dunn Brothers Coffee, provided stores with simi-
lar atmospheres, as did many individually owned coffeehouses.
In addition, McDonald’s and Dunkin’ Donuts began com-
peting more directly with Starbucks. Dunkin’ Donuts began building more upscale res-
taurants with “rounded granite-style coffee bars where workers make espresso drinks 
face-to-face with customers . . . while a carefully selected pop-music soundtrack is piped 
throughout.” McDonald’s began selling espresso-based coffee drinks for prices consider-
ably below those at Starbucks.
Schultz was also worried that in opening thousands of coffeehouses worldwide, 
Starbucks had made the customer experience less distinctive and easier for competitors 
to copy. In a memo sent to employees, he wrote:
Over the past ten years, in order to achieve the growth, development, and 
scale necessary to go from less than 1,000 stores to 13,000 stores . . . we have 
had to make a series of decisions that . . . have led to the watering down of the 
Starbucks experience.
By 2011, Schultz had managed a remarkable turnaround, with Starbucks’s sales 
and profits increasing. Some of the success was attributable to an expansion in overseas 
 markets, where competition was not as strong as in the United States. In early 2011, the 
firm had 450 stores in China, which it expects will eventually be its largest market. But 
the firm’s U.S. stores also experienced strong increases in sales. The highest Starbucks 
per-store sales had come in 2006, but the company expected to set a new record in 2011. 
The revival of Starbucks was based on several factors: The firm gave customers more 
 freedom to customize drinks, started a loyalty program that included free refills and 
other perks for regular customers, started a mobile payment system that allowed cus-
tomers to pay with a smartphone, and provided stores with machines capable of brew-
ing higher-quality coffees.
In a monopolistically competitive industry, maintaining profits in the long run is 
very difficult. Only by constantly innovating has Starbucks been able to return to profit-
ability after several years of struggling with intense competition from other firms.
Based on John Kell and Julie Jargon, “Starbucks Posts 34% Profit Jump,” Wall Street Journal, July 29, 2011; Lauren Pollock, 
“Starbucks Adds Division Focused on Asia,” Wall Street Journal, July 11, 2011; John Jannarone, “Starbucks Savors Taste of 
Success,” Wall Street Journal, July 5, 2011; Andrew Harrer, “Starbucks Corporation,” Bloomberg News, April 13, 2009; and

What Happens to Profits in the Long Run? 
441
Is Zero Economic Profit Inevitable  
in the Long Run?
The economic analysis of the long run shows the effects of market forces over time. 
Owners of monopolistically competitive firms, of course, do not have to passively ac-
cept this long-run result. The key to earning economic profits is either to sell a dif-
ferentiated product or to find a way of producing an existing product at a lower cost. If 
a monopolistically competitive firm selling a differentiated product is earning profits, 
these profits will attract the entry of additional firms, and the entry of those firms will 
eventually eliminate the firm’s profits. If a firm introduces new technology that allows 
it to sell a good or service at a lower cost, competing firms will eventually be able to 
duplicate that technology and eliminate the firm’s profits. But this result holds only if the 
firm stands still and fails to find new ways of differentiating its product or fails to find new 
ways of lowering the cost of producing its product. Starbucks had great initial success, had 
difficulty maintaining its profitability against the entry of new firms, and then found 
its way back to profitability by introducing new products and improving its customers’ 
experience through a loyalty program and other innovations. Firms continually struggle 
to find new ways of differentiating their products as they try to stay one step ahead of 
other firms that are attempting to copy their success.
The owner of a competitive firm is in a position like that of Ebenezer Scrooge in 
Charles Dickens’s A Christmas Carol. When the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come shows 
Scrooge visions of his own death, he asks the ghost, “Are these the shadows of the things 
that Will be, or are they shadows of things that May be, only?” The shadow of the end of 
their profits haunts owners of every firm. Firms try to avoid losing profits by reducing 
costs, by improving their products, or by convincing consumers that their products are 
indeed different from what competitors offer. To stay one step ahead of its competitors, 
a firm has to offer consumers goods or services that they perceive to have greater value 
than those competing firms offer. Value can take the form of product differentiation 
that makes the good or service more suited to consumers’ preferences, or it can take the 
form of a lower price.
Solving the Problem
Step 1: Review the chapter material. This problem is about how a monopolistically 
competitive firm maximizes profits and about how firms attempt to earn eco-
nomic profits in the long run, so you may want to review the section “How 
Solved Problem 13.3
Can It Be Profitable to Be  
the High-Price Seller?
During the year ending in March 2011, hhgregg, an appli-
ance and electronics retailer with stores in the Eastern states, 
 reported that its profits had risen 23 percent. During the 
same period, Best Buy’s profits declined by 3 percent. Best 
Buy is much larger than hhgregg, so it is able to buy its appli-
ances, televisions, and other goods from manufacturers at a 
low price. Because hhgregg must pay higher prices to manu-
facturers, it must charge higher prices to consumers. How is 
hhgregg able to succeed in competition with Best Buy, Wal-
Mart, Amazon, and other big retailers, despite charging high 
prices?
According to an article in the Wall Street Journal: 
 “hhgregg’s commissioned sales staff is an advantage over na-
tional chains with young, lower-paid hourly workers that tend 
to stay for shorter periods.” hhgregg’s CEO was quoted as say-
ing: “We have sales people that have been with us 10 to 20 years, 
and customers who come in and ask for them by name.”
Use this information to explain how an hhgregg store 
might be more profitable than a similar Best Buy store, de-
spite the fact that the hhgregg store charges higher prices. 
Use a graph for hhgregg and a graph for Best Buy to illus-
trate your answer.

442 
C H A P T E R  1 3  Monopolistic Competition: The Competitive Model in a More Realistic Setting  
a Monopolistically Competitive Firm Maximizes Profits in the Short Run,” 
which begins on page 434, and the section “Is Zero Economic Profit Inevi-
table in the Long Run?” on page 441.
Step 2: Explain how hhgregg can remain profitable despite its high costs. If an 
 hhgregg store has higher costs than a comparable Best Buy store, it can have 
greater profits only if the demand for its goods is higher. According to the 
Wall Street Journal article, hhgregg has differentiated itself from the competi-
tion, particularly from large chain stores such as Best Buy, by offering bet-
ter customer service. By having salespeople who are more knowledgeable and 
more experienced than the salespeople hired by competitors, hhgregg has at-
tracted consumers who need help in buying televisions and appliances. The 
higher demand from these consumers must be enough to offset hhgregg’s 
higher costs.
Step 3: Draw graphs to illustrate your argument. For simplicity, the graphs here as-
sume that televisions are the product being sold. Panel (a) shows the situation 
for hhgregg, and panel (b) shows the situation for Best Buy. The graphs show 
that the hhgregg store has both greater demand and higher costs than the Best 
Buy store. Because the greater demand more than offsets the higher costs, the 
hhgregg store makes a larger profit.

Extra Credit: As we have seen, firms constantly search for means of differentiating 
themselves from their competitors. Often, differentiation works for a while but then 
breaks down as competitors copy the strategy. Providing excellent customer service 
is more difficult to copy because it can take years to assemble an experienced sales 
staff and to acquire a reputation for excellent service. In fact, Best Buy, Wal-Mart, and 
other large chains may not want to compete for customers who are willing to pay a 
higher price in exchange for more help from the sales staff. In the Wall Street Journal 
article, a spokesperson for Wal-Mart was quoted as saying: “With electronics data so 
readily available online today, many customers come to us looking for a particular 
brand or item, knowledge in hand, and may not want or feel comfortable shopping 
with a salesperson.” If the larger firms do not compete on service, smaller firms, such 
as hhgregg, will have an easier time defending their market niche. For consumers in 
that niche,  hhgregg may charge higher prices, but it still provides these consumers 
with greater value.

 
Comparing Monopolistic Competition and Perfect Competition

Comparing Monopolistic Competition 
and Perfect Competition
We have seen that monopolistic competition and perfect competition share the charac-
teristic that in long-run equilibrium, firms earn zero economic profits. As Figure 13.6 
shows, however, there are two important differences between long-run equilibrium in 
the two markets:
• 
Monopolistically competitive firms charge a price greater than marginal cost.
• 
Monopolistically competitive firms do not produce at minimum average total cost.
Excess Capacity under Monopolistic Competition
Recall that a firm in a perfectly competitive market faces a perfectly elastic demand 
curve that is also its marginal revenue curve. Therefore, the firm maximizes profit by 
producing where price equals marginal cost. As panel (a) of Figure 13.6 shows, in long-
run equilibrium, a perfectly competitive firm produces at the minimum point of its av-
erage total cost curve.

The perfectly competitive firm is both allocatively efficient and productively ef-
ficient. In panel (b), a monopolistically competitive firm produces at QMC, where 
price is greater than marginal cost, and average total cost is not at a minimum. As 
a result, the monopolistically competitive firm is neither allocatively efficient nor 
productively efficient. The monopolistically competitive firm has excess capac-
ity equal to the difference between its profit-maximizing level of output and the

C H A P T E R  1 3  Monopolistic Competition: The Competitive Model in a More Realistic Setting  
Panel (b) of Figure 13.6 shows that the profit-maximizing level of output for a mo-
nopolistically competitive firm comes at a level of output where price is greater than 
marginal cost, and the firm is not at the minimum point of its average total cost curve. A 
monopolistically competitive firm has excess capacity: If it increased its output, it could 
produce at a lower average cost.
Is Monopolistic Competition Inefficient?
In Chapter 12, we discussed productive efficiency and allocative efficiency. Productive 
efficiency refers to the situation where a good is produced at the lowest possible cost. 
Allocative efficiency refers to the situation where every good or service is produced up 
to the point where the last unit provides a marginal benefit to consumers equal to the 
marginal cost of producing it. For productive efficiency to hold, firms must produce at 
the minimum point of average total cost. For allocative efficiency to hold, firms must 
charge a price equal to marginal cost. In a perfectly competitive market, both productive 
efficiency and allocative efficiency are achieved, but in a monopolistically competitive 
market, neither is achieved. Does it matter? Economists have debated whether monopo-
listically competitive markets being neither productively nor allocatively efficient results 
in a significant loss of well-being to society in these markets compared with perfectly 
competitive markets.
How Consumers Benefit from  
Monopolistic Competition
Looking again at Figure 13.6, you can see that the only difference between the monopo-
listically competitive firm and the perfectly competitive firm is that the demand curve 
for the monopolistically competitive firm slopes downward, whereas the demand curve 
for the perfectly competitive firm is a horizontal line. The demand curve for the mo-
nopolistically competitive firm slopes downward because the good or service the firm is 
selling is differentiated from the goods or services being sold by competing firms. The 
perfectly competitive firm is selling a good or service identical to those being sold by 
its competitors. A key point to remember is that firms differentiate their products to ap-
peal to consumers. When Starbucks coffeehouses begin offering slower-brewed, higher-
quality coffees, when Wal-Mart begins carrying more Blu-ray discs and fewer regular 
DVDs, when General Mills introduces Apple-Cinnamon Cheerios, or when PepsiCo 
introduces Diet Wild Cherry Pepsi, they are all attempting to attract and retain consum-
ers through product differentiation. The success of these product differentiation strate-
gies indicates that some consumers find these products preferable to the alternatives. 
Consumers, therefore, are better off than they would have been had these companies 
not differentiated their products.
We can conclude that consumers face a trade-off when buying the product of a mo-
nopolistically competitive firm: They are paying a price that is greater than marginal 
cost, and the product is not being produced at minimum average cost, but they benefit 
from being able to purchase a product that is differentiated and more closely suited to 
their tastes.
Netflix: Differentiated  
Enough to Survive?
In the late 1990s, the business of renting DVDs was dominated 
by specialized chain stores such as Blockbuster and Holly-
wood Video. Some customers were dissatisfied with these stores, however, for two main 
reasons: (1) After driving to the store, the customer might find that the movie he or she 
was hoping to rent was unavailable, and (2) unless the movie was returned on time, the 
customer would have to pay a late fee that might end up being higher than the price of 
the movie.

How Marketing Differentiates Products

How Marketing Differentiates Products
Firms can differentiate their products through marketing. Marketing refers to all the 
activities necessary for a firm to sell a product to a consumer. Marketing includes ac-
tivities such as determining which product to produce, designing the product, advertis-
ing the product, deciding how to distribute the product—for example, in retail stores  
or through a Web site—and monitoring how changes in consumer tastes are affecting 
the market for the product. Peter F. Drucker, a leading business strategist, described 
marketing as follows: “It is the whole business seen from the point of view of its final 
result, that is, from the consumer’s point of view. . . . True marketing . . . does not ask, 
‘What do we want to sell?’ It asks, ‘What does the consumer want to buy?’ ”
As we have seen, for monopolistically competitive firms to earn economic prof-
its and defend those profits from competitors, they must differentiate their products. 
Firms use two marketing tools to differentiate their products: brand management and 
advertising.
13.5 LEARNING OBJECTIVE
Define marketing and explain 
how firms use marketing to 
differentiate their products.
Marketing All the activities 
necessary for a firm to sell a product 
to a consumer.
In 1997, Reed Hastings had just sold his start-up soft-
ware firm for $750 million . . . and he was stuck with a late 
fee of $40 for having failed to return a copy of Apollo 13 on 
time. He decided to start Netflix as a mail-order DVD rental 
company. For a flat monthly fee, subscribers could rent a 
given number of DVDs, with no late fees. Netflix was an im-
mediate success; by 2003, it had 1 million subscribers. But 
Netflix faced a challenge: Many consumers were switching 
from renting or buying DVDs to downloading movies or 
streaming them from the Internet. In 2007, Netflix began 
offering unlimited streaming of videos in its subscription 
packages. Because the firm had made agreements with sev-
eral movie studios and cable channels, its broad selection of 
films made its streaming service a hit. By 2011, Netflix had 
more than 25 million subscribers and profits of more than 
$150 million.
But would Netflix be able to fight off the many competitors it faces in the business 
of streaming movies? In the DVD rental business, Netflix had advantages that were hard 
to duplicate, including a national system of warehouses that allowed it to often deliver a 
DVD the day after a customer ordered it, and an efficient system of processing a returned 
DVD and mailing out the next DVD in the customer’s queue. As a result of these advan-
tages, Wal-Mart, Blockbuster, and other firms were unsuccessful in  entering the business  
of renting DVDs by mail. But some analysts did not believe that Netflix had similar 
a dvantages in streaming movies. Many other firms were entering, or had already entered,  
the business of streaming movies, including Apple, Google, Amazon, Hulu (owned by 
Disney and News Corp.), and cable companies such as Comcast. These firms were fa-
miliar to consumers, were experts in the technology of streaming video, and had access 
to large selections of movie and television programs. Netflix also upset some consumers 
in 2011 when it increased by 60 percent the price of a subscription to both receive DVDs 
by mail and to stream videos. In late 2011, Netflix announced that it expected to suffer 
losses for a period during 2012 before returning to profitability. It remains to be seen 
whether Netflix can regain its profitability in the face of intense competition.

C H A P T E R  1 3  Monopolistic Competition: The Competitive Model in a More Realistic Setting  
Brand Management
Once a firm has succeeded in differentiating its product, it must try to maintain that dif-
ferentiation over time through brand management. As we have seen, whenever a firm 
successfully introduces a new product or a significantly different version of an old prod-
uct, it earns economic profits in the short run. But the success of the firm inspires com-
petitors to copy the new or improved product and, in the long run, the firm’s economic 
profits will be competed away. Firms use brand management to postpone the time when 
they will no longer be able to earn economic profits.
Advertising
An innovative advertising campaign can make even long-established and familiar prod-
ucts, such as Coke or McDonald’s Big Mac hamburgers, seem more desirable than com-
peting products. When a firm advertises a product, it is trying to shift the demand curve 
for the product to the right and to make it more inelastic. If the firm is successful, it will 
sell more of the product at every price, and it will be able to increase the price it charges 
without losing as many customers. Of course, advertising also increases a firm’s costs. If 
the increase in revenue that results from the advertising is greater than the increase in 
costs, the firm’s profits will rise.
Defending a Brand Name
Once a firm has established a successful brand name, it has a strong incentive to defend 
it. A firm can apply for a trademark, which grants legal protection against other firms 
using its product’s name.
One threat to a trademarked name is the possibility that it will become so widely 
used for a type of product that it will no longer be associated with the product of a spe-
cific company. Courts in the United States have ruled that when this happens, a firm is 
no longer entitled to legal protection of the brand name. For example, “aspirin,” “escala-
tor,” and “thermos” were originally all brand names of the products of particular firms, 
but each became so widely used to refer to a type of product that none remains a legally 
protected brand name. Firms spend substantial amounts of money trying to make sure 
that this does not happen to them. Coca-Cola, for example, employs people to travel 
to restaurants around the country and order a “Coke” with their meal. If the restaurant 
serves Pepsi or some other cola, rather than Coke, Coca-Cola’s legal department sends 
the restaurant a letter reminding them that “Coke” is a trademarked name and not a ge-
neric name for any cola. Similarly, Xerox Corporation spends money on advertising to 
remind the public that “Xerox” is not a generic term for making photocopies.
Legally enforcing trademarks can be difficult. Estimates are that each year, U.S. 
firms lose hundreds of billions of dollars in sales worldwide as a result of unauthorized 
use of their trademarked brand names. U.S. firms often find it difficult to enforce their 
trademarks in the courts of some foreign countries, although recent international agree-
ments have increased the legal protections for trademarks.
Firms that sell their products through franchises rather than through company-
owned stores encounter the problem that if a franchisee does not run his or her business 
well, the firm’s brand may be damaged. Automobile firms send “roadmen” to visit their 
dealers to make sure the dealerships are clean and well maintained and that the service 
departments employ competent mechanics and are well equipped with spare parts. Sim-
ilarly, McDonald’s sends employees from corporate headquarters to visit McDonald’s 
franchises to make sure the bathrooms are clean and the French fries are hot.
What Makes a Firm Successful?
A firm’s owners and managers control some of the factors that make a firm success-
ful and allow it to earn economic profits. The most important of these are the firm’s 
ability to differentiate its product and to produce it at a lower average cost than com-
peting firms. A firm that successfully does these things creates value for its customers. 
Brand management The actions 
of a firm intended to maintain the 
differentiation of a product over time.
13.6 LEARNING OBJECTIVE

What Makes a Firm Successful? 
447
Consumers will buy a product if they believe it meets a need not met by competing 
products or if its price is below that of competitors.
Some factors that affect a firm’s profitability are not directly under the firm’s con-
trol. Certain factors will affect all the firms in a market. For example, rising prices for jet 
fuel will reduce the profitability of all airlines. If consumers decide that rather than buy 
DVDs, they would prefer to download or stream movies from Netflix, iTunes, or Ama-
zon, the profitability of all stores selling DVDs will be reduced.
Sheer chance also plays a role in business, as it does in all other aspects of life. A 
struggling McDonald’s franchise may see profits increase dramatically after the county 
unexpectedly decides to build a new road nearby. Many businesses in New York City, 
including restaurants, hotels, and theaters, experienced a marked drop in customers and 
profits following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Figure 13.7 illustrates the im-
portant point that factors within the firm’s control and factors outside the firm’s control 
interact to determine the firm’s profitability.
Figure 13.7 
What Makes a Firm Successful?
The factors under a firm’s control—the abil-
ity to differentiate its product and the ability 
to produce it at lower cost—combine with the 
factors beyond its control to determine the 
firm’s profitability.

Is Being the First Firm in the Market  
a Key to Success?
Some business analysts argue that the first firm to enter a 
market can have important first-mover advantages. By being 
the first to sell a particular good, a firm may find its name closely associated with the 
good in the public’s mind, as, for instance, Amazon is closely associated with order-
ing books online or eBay is associated with online auctions. This close association 
may make it more difficult for new firms to enter the market and compete against 
the first mover.
Surprisingly, though, recent research has shown that the first firm to enter a market 
often does not have a long-lived advantage over later entrants. Consider, for instance, the 
market for pens. Until the 1940s, the only pens available were fountain pens that had to 
be refilled frequently from an ink bottle and used ink that dried slowly and smeared eas-
ily. In October 1945, entrepreneur Milton Reynolds introduced the first ballpoint pen, 
which never needed to be refilled. When it went on sale at Gimbel’s department store in 
New York City, it was an instant success. Although the pen had a price of $12.00—the 
equivalent of about $135.00 at today’s prices—hundreds of thousands were sold, and 
Milton Reynolds became a millionaire. Unfortunately, it didn’t last. Although Reynolds 
had guaranteed that his pen would write for two years—later raised to five years—in 
fact, the pen often leaked and frequently stopped writing after only limited use. Sales 
began to collapse, the flood of pens returned under the company’s guarantee wiped out 
its profits, and within a few years, Reynolds International Pen Company stopped selling 
pens in the United States. By the late 1960s, firms such as Bic, selling inexpensive—but 
reliable—ballpoint pens, dominated the market.
Making  
the 
Connection
Although not first to market, Bic 
ultimately was more successful than 
the firm that pioneered ballpoint pens.

C H A P T E R  1 3  Monopolistic Competition: The Competitive Model in a More Realistic Setting  
Conclusion
In this chapter, we have applied many of the ideas about competition we developed in 
Chapter 12 to the more common market structure of monopolistic competition. We 
have seen that these ideas apply to monopolistically competitive markets, just as they 
do to perfectly competitive markets. At the end of Chapter 12, we concluded that “The 
competitive forces of the market impose relentless pressure on firms to produce new 
and better goods and services at the lowest possible cost. Firms that fail to adequately 
anticipate changes in consumer tastes or that fail to adopt the latest and most efficient 
What happened to the Reynolds International Pen Company turns out to be more 
the rule than the exception. For example, Apple’s iPod was not the first digital music 
player to appear on the U.S. market. Both Seahan’s MPMan and Diamond’s PMP300 
were released in the United States in 1998, three years before the iPod. Similarly, al-
though Hewlett-Packard currently dominates the market for laser printers, with a mar-
ket share of more than 50 percent, it did not invent the laser printer. Xerox invented 
the laser printer, and IBM sold the first commercial laser printers. Nor was Procter & 
Gamble the first firm to sell disposable diapers when it introduced Pampers in 1961. 
Microsoft’s Internet Explorer was not the first Web browser: Before Internet Explorer, 
there was Netscape; before Netscape, there was Mosaic; and before Mosaic, there were 
several other Web browsers that for a time looked as if they might dominate the market. 
In all these cases, the firms that were first to introduce a product ultimately lost out to 
latecomers who did a better job of providing consumers with products that were more 
reliable, less expensive, more convenient, or otherwise provided greater value.
Based on Steven P. Schnaars, Managing Imitation Strategies: How Late Entrants Seize Markets from Pioneers, (New York: The 
Free Press), 1994; and Gerard J. Tellis and Peter N. Golder, Will and Vision: How Latecomers Grow to Dominate Markets, 
(Los Angeles: Figueroa Press), 2002.

Economics in Your Life
Opening Your Own Restaurant
At the beginning of the chapter, we asked you to think about how successful you are likely to be 
in opening an Italian restaurant in your hometown. As you learned in this chapter, if your restau-
rant is successful, other people are likely to open competing restaurants, and all your economic 
profits will eventually disappear. This occurs because economic profits attract entry of new firms 
into a market. The new restaurants will sell Italian food, but it won’t be exactly like your Italian 
food— after all, they don’t have your grandmother’s secret sauce recipe! Each restaurant will 
have its own ideas on how best to appeal to people who like Italian food. Unless your food is 
very different from your competitors’ food—or your service is much better—in the long run you 
will be unable to charge prices high enough to allow you to earn an economic profit.
In a monopolistically competitive market, free entry will reduce prices and lead to zero 
 economic profits in the long run. In addition to lowering prices, competition benefits consum-
ers by leading firms to offer somewhat different versions of the same product; for example, two 
 Italian restaurants will rarely be exactly alike.

 
Conclusion 
449
production technology do not survive in the long run.” These conclusions are as true for 
coffeehouses and firms in other monopolistically competitive markets as they are for 
wheat farmers and carrot growers.
In Chapters 14 and 15, we discuss the remaining market structures: oligopoly and 
monopoly. Before moving on to those chapters, read An Inside Look on the next page for 
a discussion of how Starbucks began expanding into the juice business in 2011.

It’s also is selling more products, like 
Seattle’s Best coffee and Via instant 
coffee, through grocery stores and 
other retailers.
Starbucks, which estimates that at 
some point in the future its consumer 
products business will rival the size 
of its café business, said more than a 
year ago that it would be looking for 
acquisition candidates. Its last acquisi-
tion in 2008 was of The Coffee Equip-
ment Co., which makes the high-end 
Clover coffee brewing system.
Evolution, started by the founder 
of Naked Juice, is a logical choice for 
the chain as it seeks to offer healthier 
options. Evolution, which makes fresh 
fruit and vegetable juices, has prod-
ucts that are sold at Whole Foods, 
Safeway, Costco and other retailers on 
the West Coast.
Evolution is one of the few larger 
juice companies that still cracks, peels, 
presses and squeezes its own fruits 
and vegetables rather than using pu-
reed or powdered ingredients. It also 
uses a process called high-pressure 
pasteurization to make the juice with-
out heating it. Starbucks sees these 
methods as a competitive edge over 
juice makers such as Odwalla or Na-
ked Juice, which it currently carries in 
its stores, as it allows the juice maker 
it to keep a higher nutritional qual-
ity in the juice while maintaining the 
taste.
Starbucks did not disclose how 
many stores the new chain carrying 
Starbucks Corp. hopes to do for 
juice what it’s done for coffee.
The Seattle-based company that 
changed the way Americans drink 
their cup of Joe said Thursday that 
it acquired by juice maker Evolution 
Fresh Inc. for $30 million as part of a 
larger effort to move beyond just of-
fering coffee.
Starbucks said it plans to “rein-
vent” the $1.6 billion super-premium 
juice segment with its purchase of 
Evolution, which is based in San Ber-
nardino, Calif. The company plans to 
open a new chain of health and well-
ness stores in the coming year that 
will carry Evolution products such as 
juices and simple foods. Details are 
still thin on the new chain, but Star-
bucks described it as a retail model 
that has never been seen before.
“We are not just acquiring a juice 
company,” said Starbucks CEO How-
ard Schultz. “We are using this acqui-
sition to position ourselves, in a broad 
way, to build a multibillion health and 
wellness business over time.”
The move is the latest by Star-
bucks to broaden its business as con-
sumers demand healthier products 
and it faces growing competition from 
the likes of McDonald’s Corp. and 
Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc.’s Dunkin’ 
Donuts chain. Starbucks has rolled 
out lower-calorie and lower-fat food 
options and sugar-free syrups and 
switched from whole milk to 2 per-
cent milk as the default in its drinks.

Evolution products will have or where 
the locations would be. But the com-
pany said the chain will launch on 
the West Coast and be roughly the 
size of a traditional Starbucks café. 
 Starbucks also plans to upgrade some 
of its existing stores to make room for 
the Evolution products and distribute 
Evolution’s products to other retailers.
Schultz said the company will 
launch a “full court press” to build 
the Evolution brand in the coming 
year, including more details on its new 
stores. Schultz also dismissed analyst 
concerns that it might follow in the 
footsteps of the Jamba Juice chain, 
which has struggled with soft sales 
as consumers have cut back on extras 
like blended fruit drinks. He said Star-
bucks will be creating an entirely dif-
ferent type of store.
“We understand the beverage 
business better than anyone else,” 
Schultz told investors Thursday. “We 
are replicating the understanding we 
have about beverage capability and 
adding the theater and romance (of 
our coffee stores).”
Starbucks did not change its earn-
ings forecast based on the acquisition. 
It expects Evolution will operate at a 
moderate loss in the 2012 fiscal year 
and breakeven in 2013. . . .

c While offering few details on its expan-
sion plans for the new chain, Starbucks 
CEO Howard Shultz did announce that it will 
begin with locations on the West Coast and 
that Evolution products will not be limited to 
just the new stores. Schultz also emphasized 
that the new business will be an entirely new 
type of store, and will not follow the model of 
competitor Jamba Juice, which had been 
struggling to earn an economic profit.
Thinking Critically
1. Suppose that the federal government 
required a license to open a new coffee-
house (existing coffeehouses would not 
require a license) and that the number 
of licenses was limited. How would this 
requirement affect the equilibrium price 
and quantity in the coffeehouse market? 
Who would gain from this requirement 
and who would lose?
2. Suppose that Starbucks is success-
ful with its chain of health and wellness 
stores and attracts a significant number 
of customers from other coffee and juice 
retailers. How might these other retailers 
respond to this change in tastes?
long as Starbucks encounters limited com-
petition in the premium juice market, its 
stores have the potential to earn short-run 
economic profits. Economic profits will at-
tract competition to the market, and we 
would expect to eventually see the same re-
sult in the premium juice market as in the 
premium coffee market, with economic prof-
its dropping to zero in the long run.
b Due in part to increased competition 
from companies like McDonalds and 
Dunkin’ Donuts, Starbucks began closing 
stores in 2008. The increased competition in 
the coffee business is one reason why Star-
bucks has decided to expand into other ar-
eas. Figure 2 assumes that prior to 2008, an 
existing Starbucks coffeehouse is earning 
an economic profit from selling Q1 cups of 
coffee and charging a price of P1 dollars. 
The profit-maximizing quantity is found 
where the marginal revenue curve, MR1, 
i ntersects the marginal cost curve, MC. The 
price is determined by point A on the 
d emand curve, D1. The firm earns an eco-
nomic profit equal to the shaded area. Other 
firms entering the market for premium cof-
fees reduces the demand for Starbucks  
coffee. The demand and marginal revenue 
curves for Starbucks shift to the left, from  
D1 to D2 and MR1 to MR2. The profit- 
maximizing level of output is now Q2, where 
MR2 intersects MC, and the new profit- 
maximizing price is P2. At point E, the firm is 
earning zero economic profit.
Key Points in the Article
With its purchase of Evolution Fresh, Inc., 
Starbucks is planning to open a chain 
of health and wellness stores in 2012 in 
r esponse to increasing consumer demand  
for healthier products. While not revealing 
the number or exact locations of the new 
stores, the company did say that the first 
stores will be on the West Coast and will 
be roughly the size of traditional Starbucks 
coffeehouses. The juice products will also  
be made available in some existing Star-
bucks locations as well as other retail 
o utlets. Starbucks projects its Evolution 
brand to experience moderate losses in 
2012 b efore breaking even in 2013.
Analyzing the News
a Facing increased competition in the cof-
feehouse market, Starbucks has shifted 
its focus to international expansion, con-
sumer products, and, most recently, the pre-
mium juice business. With the acquisition of 
Evolution, Starbucks plans to open a new 
chain of health and wellness stores, a market 
segment it sees as having strong growth po-
tential. If Starbucks is able to capture a sig-
nificant share of the premium juice market 
with its new chain, the company has the po-
tential of earning economic profits in this 
market segment in the short run. Figure 1

Summary
A firm competing in a monopolistically competitive market 
sells a differentiated product. Therefore, unlike a firm in a per-
fectly competitive market, it faces a downward-sloping demand 
curve. When a monopolistically competitive firm cuts the price 
of its product, it sells more units but must accept a lower price 
on the units it could have sold at the higher price. As a result, its 
marginal revenue curve is downward sloping. Every firm that has 
the ability to affect the price of the good or service it sells will 
have a marginal revenue curve that is below its demand curve.

1.6 A student makes the following argument:
When a firm sells another unit of a good, the 
additional revenue the firm receives is equal 
to the price: If the price is $10, the additional 
revenue is also $10. Therefore, this chapter is 
incorrect when it says that marginal revenue is 
less than price for a monopolistically competi-
tive firm.
 
 Briefly explain whether you agree with this argument.

Summary
A monopolistically competitive firm maximizes profits at the level 
of output where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. Price 
equals marginal revenue for a perfectly competitive firm, but price 
is greater than marginal revenue for a monopolistically competi-
tive firm. Therefore, unlike a perfectly competitive firm, which 
produces where P = MC, a monopolistically competitive firm 
produces where P 7 MC.

 Ben and Jerry are managers at the company, and they have 
this discussion:
 
 Ben: We should produce 4,000 lamps per month because 
that will minimize our average costs.
 
 Jerry: But shouldn’t we maximize profits rather than mini-
mize costs? To maximize profits, don’t we need to take de-
mand into account?
 
 Ben: Don’t worry. By minimizing average costs, we will be 
maximizing profits. Demand will determine how high the 
price we can charge will be, but it won’t affect our profit-
maximizing quantity.

might be willing to pay $50.00 for a . . . book 
on the Brooklyn Bridge, but if . . . production 
costs [increase] by 25 percent, you might think 
$62.50 is too much to pay, though that would 
be what the publisher needs to charge. And in-
deed the publisher may determine that $50.00 
is this book’s ceiling—the most you would pay 
before deciding to rent a movie instead.

how do firms adjust the price of a good when there is an 
increase in cost? Use a graph to illustrate your answer.
 
b. Does the model of monopolistic competition seem to 
fit Germano’s description? If a publisher does not raise 
the price of a book following an increase in its produc-

 2.10 In 1916, Ford Motor Company produced 500,000 Model T 
Fords, at a price of $440 each. The company made a profit 
of $60 million that year. Henry Ford told a newspaper re-
porter that he intended to reduce the price of the Model T 
to $360, and he expected to sell 800,000 cars at that price. 
Ford said, “Less profit on each car, but more cars, more 
employment of labor, and in the end we get all the total 
profit we ought to make.”
 
a. Did Ford expect the total revenue he received from sell-
ing Model Ts to rise or fall following the price cut?
 
b. Use the information given above to calculate the price 
elasticity of demand for Model Ts. Use the midpoint 
formula to make your calculation. See Chapter 6,  
page 174, if you need a refresher on the midpoint 
formula.
 
c. What would the average total cost of producing 800,000 
Model Ts have to be for Ford to make as much profit 
selling 800,000 Model Ts as it made selling 500,000 
Model Ts? Is this smaller or larger than the average to-
tal cost of producing 500,000 Model Ts?
 
d. Assume that Ford would make the same total profit 
when selling 800,000 cars as when selling 500,000 cars. 
Was Henry Ford correct in saying he would make less 
profit per car when selling 800,000 cars than when sell-
ing 500,000 cars?
Summary
If a monopolistically competitive firm is earning economic profits 
in the short run, entry of new firms will eliminate those profits in 
the long run. If a monopolistically competitive firm is suffering 
economic losses in the short run, exit of existing firms will elimi-
nate those losses in the long run. Monopolistically competitive 
firms continually struggle to find new ways of differentiating their 
products as they try to stay one step ahead of other firms that are 
attempting to copy their success.

3.6 [Related to the Don’t Let This Happen to You on page 438] 
A student remarks:
If firms in a monopolistically competitive indus-
try are earning economic profits, new firms will 
enter the industry. Eventually, a representative 
firm will find that its demand curve has shifted 
to the left, until it is just tangent to its average 
cost curve and it is earning zero profit. Because 
firms are earning zero profit at that point, some 
firms will leave the industry, and the represen-
tative firm will find that its demand curve will 
shift to the right. In long-run equilibrium, price 
will be above average total cost by just enough 
so that each firm is just breaking even.

fect, we’ll make it over. If it’s still not perfect make sure 
you’re in a Starbucks.” Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz 
explained the purpose of the campaign: “We don’t want 
the public to be misled that all coffee is equal, because it’s 
not.” Why would it be a problem for Starbucks if consum-
ers came to believe that “all coffee is equal”? How might 
Starbucks convince consumers that all coffee is not equal?

has been successful in retailing appliances and electron-
ics by combining high prices with excellent customer ser-
vice. In late 2008, Saks Fifth Avenue tried a new strategy in 
retailing luxury clothing. Saks decided to slash prices on 
designer clothing by 70 percent just before the beginning 
of the holiday sales season. According to an article in the 
Wall Street Journal, “Saks’s risky price-cut strategy was to 
be one of the first to discount deeply, rather than one of the 
last.” According to the article:
Saks’s maneuver marked an open abandon-
ment of the longstanding unwritten pact be-
tween retailers and designers. . . . Those old 
rules boiled down to this: Leave the goods at 
full price at least two months, and don’t do 
markdowns until the very end of the season.
 
 Is Saks’s strategy of becoming the low-priced luxury cloth-
ing retailer likely to succeed? Contrast Saks’s strategy with 
the strategy of hhgregg in terms of how likely the two strat-
egies are to be successful over the long run.

tate. Korda is skeptical about the usefulness of the advice 
in these books because “I have yet to meet anybody who

ural move when you see that the overall beer 
market [in Western Europe is] going down. So,

C H A P T E R  1 3  Monopolistic Competition: The Competitive Model in a More Realistic Setting  
Summary
Perfectly competitive firms produce where price equals marginal 
cost and at minimum average total cost. Perfectly competitive firms 
achieve both allocative and productive efficiency. Monopolistically 
competitive firms produce where price is greater than marginal cost 
and above minimum average total cost. Monopolistically competi-
tive firms do not achieve either allocative or productive efficiency. 
Consumers face a trade-off when buying the product of a monopo-
listically competitive firm: They are paying a price that is greater 
than marginal cost, and the product is not being produced at mini-
mum average cost, but they benefit from being able to purchase a 
product that is differentiated and more closely suited to their tastes.

4.1 What are the differences between the long-run equilibrium 
of a perfectly competitive firm and the long-run equilib-
rium of a monopolistically competitive firm?
 
4.2 Why is a monopolistically competitive firm not produc-
tively efficient? In what sense does a monopolistically 
competitive firm have excess capacity?
 
4.3 Why is a monopolistically competitive firm not alloca-
tively efficient?
 
4.4 Does the fact that monopolistically competitive markets 
are not allocatively or productively efficient mean that 
there is a significant loss in economic well-being to society 
in these markets? In your answer, be sure to define what 
you mean by “economic well-being.”

4.5 A student makes the following comment:
I can understand why a perfectly competi-
tive firm will not earn profits in the long run 
 because a perfectly competitive firm charges 
a price equal to marginal cost. But a monopo-
listically competitive firm can charge a price 
greater than marginal cost, so why can’t it con-
tinue to earn profits in the long run?

Summary
Marketing refers to all the activities necessary for a firm to sell a 
product to a consumer. Firms use two marketing tools to differ-
entiate their products: brand management and advertising. Brand 
management refers to the actions of a firm intended to maintain 
the differentiation of a product over time. When a firm has estab-
lished a successful brand name, it has a strong incentive to defend 
it. A firm can apply for a trademark, which grants legal protection 
against other firms using its product’s name.

6.3 According to an article in the Wall Street Journal:
In early January last year, after a disappoint-
ing Christmas season and amid worries about 
competition from discount retailers, Zale 
Corp. decided to shake things up: The self-
proclaimed jeweler to Middle America was go-
ing to chase upscale customers. . . . The move 
was a disaster. The Irving, Texas, retailer lost 
many of its traditional customers without win-
ning the new ones it coveted.
 
 Why would a firm like Zale abandon one market niche for 
another market niche? We know that in this case the move 
was not successful. Can you think of other cases where 
such a move has been successful?

Why Can’t You Find a Cheap PlayStation 3?
You and your roommates have just moved into a great apartment and decide to treat yourselves to 
a PlayStation 3 320GB game system—provided that you can find one at a relatively low price. First 
you check Amazon and find a price of $349.99. Then you check Best Buy, and the price there is also 
$349.99. Then you check Target; $349.99 again! Finally, you check Wal-Mart, and you find a lower 
price: $349.96, a whopping discount of $0.03. Why isn’t one of these big retailers willing to charge 
a lower price? What happened to price competition? As you read the chapter, see if you can answer 
these questions. You can check your answers against those we provide on page 477 at the end of

Apple has introduced a number of elec-
tronic products, including the iPod, iPhone, 
and iPad. In 2008, Apple introduced the 
MacBook Air, a very thin and very light lap-
top computer intended to fill a market niche 
for students, business  travelers, and others 
needing very lightweight laptops. The Mac-
Book Air posed a challenge to other com-
puter firms: Should they develop  models to 
compete with the MacBook Air or be con-
tent to continue  producing conventional 
laptops and desktops? In 2011,  Samsung 
 introduced the Series 9 notebook and Dell 
introduced the XPS 15z laptop, both in-
tended to compete with Apple’s MacBook 
Air. Because there are relatively few firms 
competing in an oligopolistic industry such 
as the computer industry, firms must con-
tinually react to each other’s actions or risk 
 losing significant sales. In this chapter, we 
focus on strategic interactions among firms.

Many of the largest corporations in the 
United States began as small businesses. In 
1975, Bill Gates and Paul Allen founded 
 Microsoft  Corporation in Albuquerque, 
New Mexico, with themselves as the only 
 employees. Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak 
formed Apple in 1976, working at first out of 
Jobs’s garage. Jobs and Wozniak were follow-
ing in the tradition of William Hewlett and 
 David Packard, who founded what became 
the Hewlett-Packard (H-P) company in a 
garage in Palo Alto, California, in the 1930s. 
Michael Dell started the Dell computer 
 company in 1984, from his dorm room at the 
University of Texas. Sam Walton, founder of 
Wal-Mart, bought his first store in 1945, with 
$20,000 borrowed from his father-in-law.
When each of these firms was founded, 
their industries included many more firms 
than they do now. Today, in the software 
and computer industries, fewer than 10 
firms account for the great majority of sales. 
Wal-Mart accounts for a large share of sev-
eral segments of retail sales.
An industry with only a few firms is an 
oligopoly. In an oligopoly, a firm’s profitabil-
ity depends on its interactions with other 
firms. In these industries, firms must de-
velop business strategies, which involve not 
just deciding what price to charge and how 
many units to produce but also how much 
to advertise, which new technologies to

I
n Chapters 12 and 13, we studied perfectly competitive and monopolistically competi-
tive industries. Our analysis focused on the determination of a firm’s  profit- maximizing 
price and quantity. We concluded that firms maximize profit by producing where 
marginal revenue equals marginal cost. To determine  marginal  revenue and marginal 
cost, we used graphs that included the firm’s demand, marginal  revenue, and marginal cost 
curves. In this chapter, we will study oligopoly, a market  structure in which a small number 
of interdependent firms compete. In analyzing oligopoly, we cannot rely on the same types 
of graphs we used in analyzing perfect competition and monopolistic competition for two 
reasons.
First, we need to use economic models that allow us to analyze the more complex busi-
ness strategies of large oligopoly firms. These strategies involve more than choosing the 
profit-maximizing price and output. Second, even in determining the profit-maximizing 
price and output for an oligopoly firm, demand curves and cost curves are not as useful as 
in the cases of perfect competition and monopolistic competition. We are able to draw the 
demand curves for competitive firms by assuming that the prices these firms charge have no 
effect on the prices other firms in their industries charge. This assumption is realistic when 
each firm is small relative to the market. It is not a realistic assumption, however, for firms 
that are as large relative to their markets as Microsoft, Apple, or Wal-Mart.
When large firms cut their prices, their rivals in the industry often—but not always— 
respond by also cutting their prices. Because we don’t know for sure how other firms will re-
spond to a price change, we don’t know the quantity an oligopolist will sell at a particular price. 
In other words, it is difficult to know what an oligopolist’s demand curve will look like. As we 
have seen, a firm’s marginal revenue curve depends on its demand curve. If we don’t know what 
an oligopolist’s demand curve looks like, we also don’t know what its marginal revenue curve 
looks like. Because we don’t know marginal revenue, we can’t calculate the profit-maximizing 
level of output and the profit-maximizing price the way we do for competitive firms.
The approach we use to analyze competition among oligopolists is called game theory. 
Game theory can be used to analyze any situation in which groups or individuals interact. In 
the context of economic analysis, game theory is the study of the decisions of firms in indus-
tries where the profits of each firm depend on its interactions with other firms. It has been 
applied to strategies for nuclear war, for international trade negotiations, and for political 
campaigns, among many other examples. In this chapter, we use game theory to analyze the 
business strategies of large firms.
Oligopoly and Barriers to Entry
An oligopoly is an industry with only a few firms. This market structure lies between 
the competitive industries we studied in Chapters 12 and 13, which have many firms, 
and the monopolies we will study in Chapter 15, which have only a single firm. One 
measure of the extent of competition in an industry is the concentration ratio. Every five 
years, the U.S. Bureau of the Census publishes four-firm concentration ratios that state 
the fraction of each industry’s sales accounted for by its four largest firms. Most econo-
mists believe that a four-firm concentration ratio greater than 40 percent indicates that 
an industry is an oligopoly.
The concentration ratio has some flaws as a measure of the extent of competition 
in an industry. For example, concentration ratios do not include the goods and services 
that foreign firms export to the United States. In addition, concentration ratios are cal-
culated for the national market, even though the competition in some industries, such 
as restaurants or college bookstores, is mainly local. Finally, competition sometimes 
exists between firms in different industries. For example, Wal-Mart is included in the 
discount department stores industry but also competes with firms in the supermarket

industry and the retail toy store industry. As we will see in Chapter 15, some economists 
prefer another measure of competition, known as the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index. De-
spite their shortcomings, concentration ratios can be useful in providing a general idea 
of the extent of competition in an industry.
Table 14.1 lists examples of oligopolies in manufacturing and retail trade. Notice 
that the computer industry is highly concentrated. The four largest firms—Hewlett-
Packard, Dell, Acer, and Apple—sell 87 percent of all the desktops and laptops sold in 
the United States.
Barriers to Entry
Why do oligopolies exist? Why aren’t there many more firms in the computer industry, 
the discount department store industry, or the beer industry? Recall that new firms will 
enter industries where existing firms are earning economic profits. But new firms often 
have difficulty entering an oligopoly. Anything that keeps new firms from entering an 
industry in which firms are earning economic profits is called a barrier to entry. Three 
barriers to entry are economies of scale, ownership of a key input, and government-
imposed barriers.
Economies of Scale The most important barrier to entry is economies of scale. In 
Chapter 11, we saw that economies of scale exist when a firm’s long-run average costs 
fall as it increases output. The greater the economies of scale, the smaller the number of 
firms that will be in the industry. Figure 14.1 illustrates this point.
If economies of scale are relatively unimportant in the industry, the typical firm’s 
long-run average cost curve (LRAC) will reach a minimum at a level of output (Q1 in 
Figure 14.1) that is a small fraction of total industry sales. The industry will have room 
for a large number of firms and will be competitive. If economies of scale are significant, 
the typical firm will not reach the minimum point on its long-run average cost curve 
(Q2 in Figure 14.1) until it has produced a large fraction of industry sales. Then the in-
dustry will have room for only a few firms and will be an oligopoly.
Economies of scale can explain why there is much more competition in the restau-
rant industry than in the computer industry. Because very large restaurants do not have 
lower average costs than smaller restaurants, the restaurant industry has room for many 
firms. In contrast, large computer firms such as Apple have much lower average costs 
than small computer firms, partly because large firms can spread the high fixed costs 
of producing computers—including very large research and development costs—over a 
much larger quantity of computers.

new firms from entering an industry 
in which firms are earning economic 
profits.

Ownership of a Key Input If production of a good requires a particular input, then 
control of that input can be a barrier to entry. For many years, the Aluminum  Company 
of America (Alcoa) controlled most of the world’s supply of high-quality bauxite, the 
mineral needed to produce aluminum. The only way other companies could enter the 
 industry to compete with Alcoa was to recycle aluminum. The De Beers Company of 
South Africa was able to block competition in the diamond market by controlling the 
output of most of the world’s diamond mines. Until the 1990s, Ocean Spray had very little 
competition in the market for fresh and frozen cranberries because it controlled  almost 
the entire supply of cranberries. Even today, the company controls about 80  percent of 
the cranberry crop.
Government-Imposed Barriers Firms sometimes try to convince the govern-
ment to impose barriers to entry. Many large firms employ lobbyists to convince state 
legislators and members of Congress to pass laws favorable to the economic interests of 
the firms. There are tens of thousands of lobbyists in Washington, DC, alone. Top lob-
byists command annual salaries of $300,000 or more, which indicates the value firms 
place on their activities. Examples of government-imposed barriers to entry are patents, 
licensing requirements, and barriers to international trade.
A patent gives a firm the exclusive right to a new product for a period of 20 years 
from the date the patent is filed with the government. Governments use patents to en-
courage firms to carry out research and development of new and better products and 
better ways of producing existing products. Output and living standards increase faster 
when firms devote resources to research and development, but a firm that spends money 
to develop a new product may not earn much profit if other firms can copy the product. 
For example, the pharmaceutical company Merck spends more than $3 billion per year 
on developing new prescription drugs. If rival companies could freely produce these 
new drugs as soon as Merck developed them, most of the firm’s investment would be 
wasted. Because Merck can patent a new drug, the firm can charge higher prices during 
the years the patent is in force and make an economic profit on its successful innovation.
Governments also restrict competition through occupational licensing. The United 
States currently has about 500 occupational licensing laws. For example, doctors and 
dentists in every state need licenses to practice. The justification for the laws is to pro-
tect the public from incompetent practitioners, but by restricting the number of people 
who can enter the licensed professions, the laws also raise prices. Studies have shown

An industry will be competitive if the mini-
mum point on the typical firm’s long-run 
average cost curve (LRAC1) occurs at a level 
of output that is a small fraction of total in-
dustry sales, such as Q1. The industry will be 
an oligopoly if the minimum point comes at 
a level of output that is a large fraction of in-
dustry sales, such as Q2.

that states that make it harder to earn a dentist’s license have prices for dental services 
that are about 15 percent higher than in other states. Similarly, states that require a li-
cense for out-of-state firms to sell contact lenses have higher prices for contact lenses. 
When state licenses are required for occupations such as hair braiding, which was done 
several years ago in California, restricting competition is the main result.
Governments also impose barriers to entering some industries by imposing tariffs 
and quotas on foreign competition. As we saw in Chapter 9, a tariff is a tax on imports, 
and a quota limits the quantity of a good that can be imported into a country. A quota 
on foreign sugar imports severely limits competition in the U.S. sugar market. As a re-
sult, U.S. sugar companies can charge prices that are more than twice as high as prices 
companies outside the United States charge.
In summary, to earn economic profits, all firms would like to charge a price well 
above average cost, but earning economic profits attracts new firms to enter the indus-
try. Eventually, the increased competition forces price down to average cost, and firms 
just break even. In an oligopoly, barriers to entry prevent—or at least slow down—entry, 
which allows firms to earn economic profits over a longer period.
Using Game Theory to Analyze Oligopoly
As we noted at the beginning of the chapter, economists analyze oligopolies by using 
game theory, which was developed during the 1940s by the mathematician John von 
Neumann and the economist Oskar Morgenstern. Game theory is the study of how 
people make decisions in situations in which attaining their goals depends on their in-
teractions with others. In oligopolies, the interactions among firms are crucial in deter-
mining profitability because the firms are large relative to the market.
In all games—whether poker, chess, or Monopoly—the interactions among the 
players are crucial in determining the outcome. In addition, games share three key 
characteristics:
 1. Rules that determine what actions are allowable
 2. Strategies that players employ to attain their objectives in the game
 3. Payoffs that are the results of the interactions among the players’ strategies
In business situations, the rules of the “game” include not just laws that a firm must 
obey but also other matters beyond a firm’s control—at least in the short run—such 
as its production function. A business strategy is a set of actions that a firm takes to 
achieve a goal, such as maximizing profits. The payoffs are the profits a firm earns as 
a result of how its strategies interact with the strategies of other firms. The best way to 
understand the game theory approach is to look at an example.
A Duopoly Game: Price Competition  
between Two Firms
In this simple example, we use game theory to analyze price competition in a duopoly—
an oligopoly with two firms. Suppose we ignore the other firms in the industry and 
assume that Apple and Dell are the only two firms producing desktop computers. Let’s 
focus on their sales of basic desktop computers, such as Apple’s iMac or Dell’s Inspiron 
All-in-One. The managers of the two firms have to decide whether to charge $1,200 or 
$1,000 for their computers. Which price will be more profitable depends on the price 
the other firm charges. The decision regarding what price to charge is an example of a 
business strategy. In Figure 14.2, we organize the possible outcomes that result from the 
actions of the two firms into a payoff matrix, which is a table that shows the payoffs 
that each firm earns from every combination of strategies by the firms.
Apple’s profits are shown in red, and Dell’s profits are shown in blue. If Apple and 
Dell both charge $1,200 for their computers, each firm will make a profit of $10 mil-
lion per month. If Apple charges the lower price of $1,000, while Dell charges $1,200, 
Apple will gain many of Dell’s customers. Apple’s profits will be $15 million, and Dell’s 
will be only $5 million. Similarly, if Dell charges $1,000 while Apple is charging $1,200,

Apple’s profits will be only $5 million while Dell’s profits will be $15 million. If both 
firms charge $1,000, each will earn profits of $7.5 million per month.
Clearly, the firms will be better off if they both charge $1,200 for their computers. 
But will they both charge this price? One possibility is that Apple’s managers and Dell’s 
managers will get together and collude by agreeing to charge the higher price.  Collusion 
is an agreement among firms to charge the same price or otherwise not to compete. 
Unfortunately for Apple and Dell—but fortunately for their customers—collusion is 
against the law in the United States. The government can fine companies that collude 
and send the managers involved to prison.
Apple’s managers can’t legally discuss their pricing decision with Dell’s managers, 
so they have to predict what the other managers will do. Suppose Apple’s managers 
are convinced that Dell’s managers will charge $1,200 for their computers. In this case, 
Apple’s managers will definitely charge $1,000 because that will increase Apple’s profit 
from $10 million to $15 million. But suppose that, instead, Apple’s managers are con-
vinced that Dell’s managers will charge $1,000. Then Apple’s managers also definitely 
will charge $1,000 because that will increase their profit from $5 million to $7.5 million. 
In fact, regardless of which price Dell’s managers decide to charge, Apple’s managers 
are better off charging $1,000. So, we know that Apple’s managers will choose a price of 
$1,000 for Apple computers.
Now consider the situation of Dell’s managers. They are in the same position as Apple’s 
managers, so we can expect them to make the same decision to charge $1,000 for their 
 computers. In this situation, both firms have a dominant strategy. A dominant strategy 
is the best strategy for a firm, no matter what strategies other firms use. The result is an 
equilibrium where both firms charge $1,000 for their computers. This situation is an 
 equilibrium because each firm is maximizing profits, given the price chosen by the other 
firm. In other words, neither firm can increase its profits by changing its price, given the 
price chosen by the other firm. An equilibrium where each firm chooses the best strategy, 
given the strategies chosen by other firms, is called a Nash equilibrium, named after Nobel 
Laureate John Nash of Princeton University, a pioneer in the development of game theory.
Firm Behavior and the Prisoner’s Dilemma
Notice that the equilibrium in Figure 14.2 is not very satisfactory for either firm. The 
firms earn $7.5 million in profit each month by charging $1,000, but they could have 
earned $10 million in profit if they had both charged $1,200. By “cooperating” and 
charging the higher price, they would have achieved a cooperative equilibrium. In a co-
operative equilibrium, players cooperate to increase their mutual payoff. We have seen, 
though, that the outcome of this game is likely to be a noncooperative equilibrium, in 
which each firm pursues its own self-interest.
A situation like this, in which pursuing dominant strategies results in noncooperation 
that leaves everyone worse off, is called a prisoner’s dilemma. The game gets its name 
from the problem faced by two suspects the police arrest for a crime. If the police lack 
other evidence, they may separate the suspects and offer each a reduced prison sentence 
in exchange for confessing to the crime and testifying against the other suspect. Because 
each suspect has a dominant strategy to confess to the crime, they will both confess and 
serve a jail term, even though they would have gone free if they had both remained silent.

would each make a profit of only $7.5 mil-

Don’t Misunderstand Why Each Firm Ends 
Up Charging a Price of $1,000
It is tempting to think that Apple and Dell would each 
charge $1,000 rather than $1,200 for their computers be-
cause each is afraid that the other firm will charge $1,000. 
In fact, fear of being undercut by the other firm’s charging 
a lower price is not the key to understanding each firm’s 
pricing strategy. Notice that charging $1,000 is the most 
profitable strategy for each firm, no matter which price 
the other firm decides to charge. For example, even if 
Apple’s managers somehow knew for sure that Dell’s man-
agers intended to charge $1,200, Apple would still charge 
$1,000 because its profits would be $15 million instead 
of $10 million. Dell’s managers are in the same situation. 
That is why charging $1,000 is a dominant strategy for 
both firms.

Is Advertising a Prisoner’s Dilemma  
for Coca-Cola and Pepsi?
Coca-Cola and Pepsi both advertise aggressively, but would 
they be better off if they didn’t? Their commercials are 
 usually not designed to convey new information about their 
products.  Instead, they are designed to capture each other’s 
customers. Construct a payoff matrix using the following 
hypothetical information:
• 
 If neither firm advertises, Coca-Cola and Pepsi both 
earn profits of $750 million per year.
• 
 If both firms advertise, Coca-Cola and Pepsi both earn 
profits of $500 million per year.
• 
 If Coca-Cola advertises and Pepsi doesn’t, Coca-Cola 
earns profits of $900 million and Pepsi earns profits of 
$400 million.
• 
 If Pepsi advertises and Coca-Cola doesn’t, Pepsi earns 
profits of $900 million and Coca-Cola earns profits of 
$400 million.

tise? Briefly explain.

c.  Is there a Nash equilibrium to this advertising game? 
If so, what is it?

C H A P T E R  1 4  Oligopoly: Firms in Less Competitive Markets
Step 3: Answer part a. by showing that Coca-Cola has a dominant strategy of 
 advertising. If Pepsi doesn’t advertise, then Coca-Cola will make $900 million 
if it advertises but only $750 million if it doesn’t. If Pepsi advertises, then 
Coca-Cola will make $500 million if it advertises but only $400 million if it 
doesn’t. Therefore, advertising is a dominant strategy for Coca-Cola.
Step 4: Answer part b. by showing that Pepsi has a dominant strategy of 
advertising.  Pepsi is in the same position as Coca-Cola, so it also has a domi-
nant strategy of advertising.
Step 5: Answer part c. by showing that there is a Nash equilibrium for this game. 
Both firms advertising is a Nash equilibrium. Given that Pepsi is advertising, 
Coca-Cola’s best strategy is to advertise. Given that Coca-Cola is advertising, 
Pepsi’s best strategy is to advertise. Therefore, advertising is the optimal deci-
sion for both firms, given the decision by the other firm.
Extra Credit: This is another example of the prisoner’s dilemma game. Coca-Cola and 
Pepsi would be more profitable if they both refrained from advertising, thereby saving 
the enormous expense of television and radio commercials and newspaper and maga-
zine ads. Each firm’s dominant strategy is to advertise, however, so they end up in an 
equilibrium where both advertise, and their profits are reduced.

Is There a Dominant Strategy  
for Bidding on eBay?
An auction is a game in which bidders compete to buy a prod-
uct. The payoff in winning an auction is equal to the difference 
between the subjective value you place on the product being auctioned and the amount 
of the winning bid. On the online auction site eBay, more than 200 million items valued 
at more than $10 billion are auctioned each year.
eBay is run as a second-price auction, where the winning bid-
der pays an amount equal to the bid of the second-highest bidder. 
If the high bidder on a DVD of The Dark Knight Rises bids $12, 
and the second bidder bids $8, the high bidder wins the auction 
and pays $8. It may seem that your best strategy when bidding on 
eBay is to place a bid well below the subjective value you place on 
the item in the hope of winning it at a low price. In fact, bidders 
on eBay have a dominant strategy of entering a bid equal to the 
maximum value they place on the item. For instance, suppose you 
are looking for a present for your parents’ anniversary. They are 
U2 fans, and someone is auctioning a pair of U2 concert tickets. If 
the maximum value you place on the tickets is $200, that should be 
your bid. To see why, consider the results of strategies of bidding 
more or less than $200.
There are two possible outcomes of the auction: Either someone else bids more 
than you do, or you are the high bidder. First, suppose you bid $200 but someone else 
bids more than you do. If you had bid less than $200, you would still have lost. If you 
had bid more than $200, you might have been the high bidder, but because your bid 
would be for more than the value you place on the tickets, you would have a negative 
payoff. Second, suppose you bid $200 and you are the high bidder. If you had bid less 
than $200, you would have risked losing the tickets to someone whose bid you would 
have beaten by bidding $200. You would be worse off than if you had bid $200 and won. 
If you had bid more than $200, you would not have affected the price you ended up 
paying—which, remember, is equal to the second-highest bid. Therefore, a strategy of 
Making

On eBay, bidding the maximum 
value you place on an item is a 
dominant strategy.

Can Firms Escape the Prisoner’s Dilemma?
Although the prisoner’s dilemma game seems to show that cooperative behavior al-
ways breaks down, we know it doesn’t. People often cooperate to achieve their goals, 
and firms find ways to cooperate by not competing on price. The reason the basic pris-
oner’s dilemma story is not always applicable is that it assumes the game will be played 
only once. Most business situations, however, are repeated over and over. For example, 
consider the following situation: Suppose that in a small town, the only place to buy a 
PlayStation 3 game console is from either the local Target store or the local Wal-Mart 
store. (For simplicity, we will ignore the possibility of consumers buying the  PlayStation 
3 online.) We will assume that the managers will charge either $400 or $300 for the  
PlayStation. Panel (a) of Figure 14.3 shows the payoff matrix. Examining the matrix 
shows that, just as with Apple and Dell pricing computers, each manager has an in-
centive to charge the lower price. Once again, the firms appear caught in a prisoner’s 
dilemma. But the managers will not play this game only once because each month they  
will decide again what price they will charge for the PlayStation 3. In the language of game  
theory, the managers are playing a repeated game. In a repeated game, the losses from 
bidding $200—the maximum value you place on the tickets—dominates bidding more 
or less than $200.
Even though making your first bid your highest bid is a dominant strategy on eBay, 
many bidders don’t use it. After an auction is over, a link leads to a Web page showing all 
the bids. In many auctions, the same bidder bids several times, showing that the bidder 
had not understood his or her dominant strategy.

Changing the Payoff Matrix in 
a Repeated Game
Wal-Mart and Target can change the payoff 
matrix for selling PlayStation 3 game con-
soles by advertising that each will match its 
competitor’s price. This retaliation strategy 
provides a signal that one store charging 
a lower price will be met automatically by 
the other store charging a lower price. In 
the payoff matrix in panel (a), there is no 
matching offer, and each store benefits if it 
charges $300 when the other charges $400. 
In the payoff matrix in panel (b), with the 
matching offer, the companies have only 
two choices: They can charge $400 and 
receive a profit of $10,000 per month, or 
they can charge $300 and receive a profit of 
$7,500 per month. The equilibrium shifts 
from the prisoner’s dilemma result of both 
stores charging the low price and receiving 
low profits to both stores charging the high 
price and receiving high profits.

C H A P T E R  1 4  Oligopoly: Firms in Less Competitive Markets
not cooperating are greater than in a game played once, and players can also employ 
retaliation strategies against those who don’t cooperate. As a result, we are more likely to 
see cooperative behavior.
Panel (a) of Figure 14.3 shows that Wal-Mart and Target are earning $2,500 less 
per month by both charging $300 instead of $400 for the PlayStation 3. Every month 
that passes with both stores charging $300 increases the total amount lost: Two years of 
charging $300 will cause each store to lose $60,000 in profit. This lost profit increases 
the incentive for the store managers to cooperate by implicitly colluding. Remember 
that explicit collusion—such as the managers meeting and agreeing to charge $400—is 
 illegal. But if the managers can find a way to signal each other that they will charge 
$400, they may be within the law.
Suppose, for example, that Wal-Mart and Target both advertise that they will match 
the lowest price offered by any competitor—in our simple example, they are each  other’s 
only competitor. These advertisements are signals to each other that they intend to 
charge $400 for the PlayStation. The signal is clear because each store knows that if it 
charges $300, the other store will automatically retaliate by also lowering its price to 
$300. The offer to match prices is a good enforcement mechanism because it guarantees 
that if either store fails to cooperate and charges the lower price, the competing store 
will automatically punish that store by also charging the lower price. As Figure 14.3 
shows, the stores have changed the payoff matrix they face.
With the original payoff matrix in panel (a), there is no matching offer, and each 
store makes more profit if it charges $300 when the other charges $400. The matching 
offer changes the payoff matrix to that shown in panel (b). Now the stores can charge 
$400 and receive a profit of $10,000 per month, or they can charge $300 and receive a 
profit of $7,500 per month. The equilibrium shifts from the prisoner’s dilemma result of 
both stores charging the low price and receiving low profits to a result where both stores 
charge the high price and receive high profits. An offer to match competitors’ prices 
might seem to benefit consumers, but game theory shows that it actually may hurt con-
sumers by helping to keep prices high.
One form of implicit collusion occurs as a result of price leadership. With price lead-
ership, one firm takes the lead in announcing a price change, which other firms in the 
industry then match. For example, through the 1970s, General Motors would announce 
a price change at the beginning of a model year, and Ford and Chrysler would match 
GM’s price change. In some cases, such as in the airline industry, firms have attempted 
to act as price leaders but failed when other firms in the industry declined to cooperate.
Price leadership A form of implicit 
collusion in which one firm in an 
oligopoly announces a price change 
and the other firms in the industry 
match the change.
With Price Collusion, More Is  
Not Merrier
Coordinating prices is easier in some industries than in  others. 
Fixed costs in the airline industry are very large, and marginal 
costs are very small. The marginal cost of flying one more passenger from Chicago to 
New York is no more than a few dollars: the cost of another snack served and a small 
amount of additional jet fuel. As a result, airlines often engage in last-minute price cut-
ting to fill the remaining empty seats on a flight. Even a low-price ticket will increase 
marginal revenue more than marginal cost. As with other oligopolies, if all airlines cut 
prices, industry profits will decline. Airlines therefore continually adjust their prices 
while at the same time monitoring their rivals’ prices and retaliating against them either 
for cutting prices or failing to go along with price increases.
In recent years, though, mergers in the airline industry have increased the possibility 
of implicit collusion by reducing the number of airlines flying between two cities. Often 
only one or two airlines will fly on a particular route. Southwest Airlines and JetBlue, 
however, have undertaken an aggressive campaign to enter many airports, thereby in-
creasing competition. For example, before Southwest entered Washington, DC’s Dulles 
International Airport in October 2006, United and Continental Airlines were the only 
major airlines serving the airport. But would increasing the number of airlines on a route

Cartels: The Case of OPEC
In the United States, firms cannot legally meet to agree on what prices to charge and 
how much to produce. But suppose they could. Would this be enough to guarantee that 
their collusion would be successful? The example of the Organization of the Petroleum 
Exporting Countries (OPEC) indicates that the answer to this question is “no.” OPEC 
has 12 members, including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and other Arab countries, as well as 
Iran, Venezuela, Nigeria, and Indonesia. Together, these countries own 75 percent of the 
world’s proven oil reserves, although they pump a smaller share of the total oil sold each 
year. OPEC operates as a cartel, which is a group of firms that collude by agreeing to 
restrict output to increase prices and profits. The members of OPEC meet periodically 
and agree on quotas, which are quantities of oil that each country agrees to produce. 
The quotas are intended to reduce oil production well below the competitive level in 
order to force up the price of oil and increase the profits of member countries.
Figure 14.4 shows oil prices from 1972 to mid-2011. The blue line shows the price 
of a barrel of oil in each year. Prices in general have risen since 1972, which has reduced 
the amount of goods and services that consumers can purchase with a dollar. The red 
line corrects for general price increases by measuring oil prices in terms of the dollar’s 
purchasing power in 2011. The figure shows that OPEC had considerable success in 
raising the price of oil during the mid-1970s and early 1980s, although political unrest 
in the Middle East and other factors also affected the price of oil during these years. Oil 
prices, which had been below $3 per barrel in 1972, rose to more than $39 per barrel in 
1980, which was more than $100 measured in dollars of 2011 purchasing power. The 
figure also shows that OPEC has had difficulty sustaining the high prices of 1980 in 
later years, although oil prices rose sharply between 2004 and mid-2008, in part due to 
increasing demand from China and India.

from two to three have much effect on the ability of the airlines 
to engage in price collusion? Austan Goolsbee and Chad  Syverson 
of the University of Chicago studied the effects of  Southwest’s 
 entering airline markets over an 11-year period. They found that 
when Southwest begins flying a particular route, ticket prices drop 
by an average of 29 percent. These price declines are an indication 
that airlines may have been practicing implicit price collusion be-
fore Southwest’s entry into the market. Perhaps surprisingly, Gools-
bee and Syverson found that more than half of the price decline 
 actually occurred after it became likely that Southwest would enter 
a market but before Southwest actually began flying planes on the 
route. One possibility is that airlines already in the market lowered 
prices to keep frequent flyers from switching to Southwest.
JetBlue has had a similar effect on airline fares. For example, 
when JetBlue entered the Chicago-to-New York market in 2006, United and American, 
which had previously dominated the route, slashed fares by 65 percent, to $108 for a 
round-trip ticket. In the following years, the airlines had trouble reestablishing the im-
plicit price collusion they had practiced before JetBlue entered: In September 2011, a 
round trip ticket from Chicago to New York had a price of $106 on United and Ameri-
can, and $101 dollars on JetBlue.
In the airline industry, it apparently doesn’t take much competition to greatly re-
duce opportunities for price collusion.

C H A P T E R  1 4  Oligopoly: Firms in Less Competitive Markets
Game theory helps us understand why oil prices have fluctuated. If every member of 
OPEC cooperates and produces the low output level dictated by its quota, prices will be 
high, and the cartel will earn large profits. Once the price has been driven up, however, 
each member has an incentive to stop cooperating and to earn even higher profits by 
increasing output beyond its quota. But if no country sticks to its quota, total oil out-
put will increase, and profits will decline. In other words, OPEC is caught in a prisoner’s 
dilemma.
If the members of OPEC always exceeded their production quotas, the cartel would 
have no effect on world oil prices. In fact, the members of OPEC periodically meet and 
assign new quotas that, at least for a while, enable them to restrict output enough to 
raise prices. Two factors explain OPEC’s occasional success at behaving as a cartel. First, 
the members of OPEC are participating in a repeated game. As we have seen, this in-
creases the likelihood of a cooperative outcome. Second, Saudi Arabia has far larger 
oil reserves than any other member of OPEC. Therefore, it has the most to gain from 
high oil prices and a greater incentive to cooperate. To see this, consider the payoff 
 matrix shown in Figure 14.5. To keep things simple, let’s assume that OPEC has only 
two members: Saudi Arabia and Nigeria. In Figure 14.5, “Low Output” corresponds to 
cooperating with the OPEC-assigned output quota, and “High Output” corresponds  
to producing at  maximum capacity. The payoff matrix shows the profits received per 
day by each country.
We can see that Saudi Arabia has a strong incentive to cooperate and maintain its 
low output quota. By keeping output low, Saudi Arabia can by itself significantly raise 
the world price of oil, increasing its own profits as well as those of other members of 
OPEC. Therefore, Saudi Arabia has a dominant strategy of cooperating with the quota 
and producing a low output. Nigeria, however, cannot by itself have much effect on the 
price of oil. Therefore, Nigeria has a dominant strategy of not cooperating and instead 
producing a high output. The equilibrium of this game will occur with Saudi Arabia 
producing a low output and Nigeria producing a high output. In fact, OPEC often 
 operates in just this way. Saudi Arabia will cooperate with the quota, while the other

raise the world price of oil in the mid-1970s 
and early 1980s. Sustaining high prices has 
been difficult over the long run, however, 
because OPEC members often exceed their 
output quotas.

Members
Because Saudi Arabia can produce much 
more oil than Nigeria, its output decisions 
have a much larger effect on the price of oil. 
In the figure, Low Output corresponds to 
cooperating with the OPEC-assigned output 
quota, and High Output corresponds to pro-
ducing at maximum capacity. Saudi Arabia 
has a dominant strategy to cooperate and 
produce a low output. Nigeria, however, has 
a dominant strategy not to cooperate and 
instead produce a high output. Therefore, 
the equilibrium of this game will occur with 
Saudi Arabia producing a low output and 
Nigeria producing a high output.

 
Sequential Games and Business Strategy

11 members produce at capacity. Because this is a repeated game, however, Saudi Arabia 
will occasionally produce more oil than its quota to intentionally drive down the price 
and retaliate against the other members for not cooperating.
Sequential Games and Business Strategy
We have been analyzing games in which both players move simultaneously. In many 
business situations, however, one firm will act first, and then other firms will respond. 
These situations can be analyzed using sequential games. We will use sequential games 
to analyze two business strategies: deterring entry and bargaining between firms. To 
keep things simple, we consider situations that involve only two firms.
Deterring Entry
We saw earlier that barriers to entry are a key to firms continuing to earn economic 
 profits. Can firms create barriers to deter new firms from entering an industry? Some 
 recent research in game theory has focused on this question. To take a simple example, 
suppose once again that Apple and Dell are the only makers of very thin and very light 
laptop computers. Apple has been successfully selling its MacBook Air laptops since 
2008. As we saw in the chapter opener, in 2011, Dell finally decided to enter the market 
for very thin, very light laptops with the XPS 15z laptop. One factor firms consider in 
pricing a new product is the effect different prices have on the likelihood that competi-
tors will enter the market. A high price might lead to high profits if other firms do not en-
ter the market, but if a high price attracts entry from other firms, it might actually result 
in lower profits. A low price, by deterring entry, might lead to higher profits. Assume that 
managers at Apple have developed a very thin, very light laptop before Dell has and are 
considering what price to charge. To break even by covering the opportunity cost of the 
funds involved, laptops must provide a minimum rate of return of 15 percent on Apple’s 
investment. If Apple has the market for this type of laptop to itself and charges a price of 
$800, it will earn economic profits by receiving a return of 20 percent. If Apple charges a 
price of $1,000 and has the market to itself, it will receive a higher return of 30 percent.
It seems clear that Apple should charge $1,000 for its laptops, but the managers are 
worried that Dell might also begin selling this type of laptop. If Apple charges $800 and 
Dell enters the market, Apple and Dell will divide up the market, and both will earn 
only 5 percent on their investments, which is below the 15 percent return necessary to 
break even. If Apple charges $1,000 and Dell enters, although the market will still be 
divided, the higher price means that each firm will earn 16 percent on its investment.
Apple and Dell are playing a sequential game, because Apple makes the first move—
deciding what price to charge—and Dell responds. We can analyze a sequential game by 
using a decision tree, like the one shown in Figure 14.6. The boxes in the figure represent 
decision nodes, which are points where the firms must make the decisions contained 
in the boxes. At the left, Apple makes the initial decision of what price to charge, and 
then Dell responds by either entering the market or not. The decisions made are shown 
beside the arrows. The terminal nodes, in green at the right side of the figure, show the 
resulting rates of return.
Let’s start with Apple’s initial decision. If Apple charges $1,000, then the arrow di-
rects us to the upper red decision node for Dell. If Dell decides to enter, it will earn a 16 
percent rate of return on its investment, which represents an economic profit because it 
is above the opportunity cost of the funds involved. If Dell doesn’t enter, Apple will earn 
30 percent, and Dell will not earn anything in this market (indicated by the dash). Apple’s 
managers can conclude that if they charge $1,000 for their laptops, Dell will enter the very 
thin, very light laptop market, and both firms will earn 16 percent on their investments.
If Apple decides to charge $800, then the arrow directs us to the lower red decision 
node for Dell. If Dell decides to enter, it will earn only a 5 percent rate of return. If it 
doesn’t enter, Apple will earn 20 percent, and Dell will not earn anything in this market. 
Apple’s managers can conclude that if they charge $800, Dell will not enter, and Apple 
will earn 20 percent on its investment.

C H A P T E R  1 4  Oligopoly: Firms in Less Competitive Markets
This analysis should lead Apple’s managers to conclude that they can charge $1,000 
and earn 16 percent—because Dell will enter—or they can charge $800 and earn 20 
percent by deterring Dell’s entry. Using a decision tree helps Apple’s managers to make 
the correct choice and charge $800 to deter Dell’s entry into this market. Note that our 
discussion is simplified because we are ignoring other characteristics, apart from price, 
on which the firms also compete. In practice, Apple charged a relatively high price for 
MacBook Air, which caused Dell to enter the market with the lower-priced XPS 15z. 
Apple’s managers believed that the MacBook Air’s features would remain attractive to 
consumers, despite the XPS 15z having a lower price. Time will tell whether Apple made 
the correct decision by not charging a low enough price to deter Dell’s entry.

Apple earns its highest return if it charges 
$1,000 for its very thin, very light laptop and 
Dell does not enter the market. But at that 
price, Dell will enter the market, and Apple 
will earn only 16 percent. If Apple charges 
$800, Dell will not enter because Dell will 
suffer an economic loss by receiving only a 
5 percent return on its investment. There-
fore, Apple’s best decision is to deter Dell’s 
entry by charging $800. Apple will earn an 
economic profit by receiving a 20 percent 
return on its investment. Note that the

Bargaining
The success of many firms depends on how well they bargain with other firms. For ex-
ample, firms often must bargain with their suppliers over the prices they pay for inputs. 
Suppose that TruImage is a small firm that has developed software that improves how 
pictures from a digital camera are displayed on computer screens. TruImage currently 
sells its software only on its Web site and earns profits of $2 million per year. Dell in-
forms TruImage that it is considering installing the software on every new computer 
Dell sells. Dell expects to sell more computers at a higher price if it can install TruIm-
age’s software on its computers. The two firms begin bargaining over what price Dell 
will pay TruImage for its software.
The decision tree in Figure 14.7 illustrates this bargaining game. At the left, Dell 
makes the initial decision about what price to offer TruImage for its software, and then 
TruImage responds by either accepting or rejecting the contract offer. First, suppose 
that Dell offers TruImage a contract price of $30 per copy for its software. If TruImage

Dell earns the highest profit if it offers a

$30 per copy and it accepts the contract. 
TruImage may attempt to bargain by threat-
ening to reject a $20-per-copy contract. But 
Dell knows this threat is not credible be-
cause once Dell has offered a $20-per-copy 
contract, TruImage’s profits are higher if it 
accepts the contract than if it rejects it.
Solving the Problem
Step 1: Review the chapter material. This problem is about sequential games, so you 
may want to review the section “Deterring Entry,” which begins on page 471.
Step 2: Determine how Dell will respond to Apple’s decision. If Apple charges 
$1,000 for its very thin, very light laptops, Dell will not enter the market 
because the return on its investment represents an economic loss. If Apple 
charges $800, Dell will enter because it will earn a return that represents an 
economic profit.
Step 3: Given how Dell will react, determine which strategy maximizes profits for 
Apple. If Apple charges $1,000, it will have deterred Dell’s entry, and the rate 
of return on its investment will be 20 percent. If Apple charges $800, Dell will 
enter, but because these low prices will substantially increase the market for 
these laptops, Apple will actually earn a higher return of 24 percent, splitting 
the market with Dell at a lower price than it would have earned having the 
whole market to itself at a high price.
Step 4: State your conclusion. Like any other business strategy, deterrence is worth 
pursuing only if the payoff is higher than for other strategies. In this case, ex-

accepts this contract, its profits will be $5 million per year, and Dell will earn $10 million 
in additional profits. If TruImage rejects the contract, its profits will be the $2 million 
per year it earns selling its software on its Web site, and Dell will earn zero additional 
profits.
Now, suppose Dell offers TruImage a contract price of $20 per copy. If TruImage ac-
cepts this contract, its profits will be $3 million per year, and Dell will earn $15 million 
in additional profits. If TruImage rejects this contract, its profits will be the $2 million 
it earns selling its software on its Web site, and Dell will earn zero additional profits. 
Clearly, for Dell, a contract price of $20 per copy is more profitable, while for TruImage, 
a contract price of $30 per copy is more profitable.
Suppose TruImage attempts to obtain a favorable outcome from the bargaining by 
telling Dell that it will reject a $20-per-copy contract price. If Dell believes this threat, 
then it will offer TruImage a $30-per-copy contract price because Dell is better off 
with the $10 million profit that will result from TruImage’s accepting the contract than  
with the zero profits Dell will earn if TruImage rejects the $20-per-copy contract price. 
This result is a Nash equilibrium because neither firm can increase its profits by chang-
ing its choice—provided that Dell believes TruImage’s threat. But is TruImage’s threat 
credible? Once Dell has offered TruImage the $20 contract price, TruImage’s choices 
are to accept the contract and earn $3 million or reject the contract and earn only  
$2 million. Because rejecting the contract reduces TruImage’s profits, TruImage’s threat 
to reject the contract is not credible, and Dell should ignore it.
As a result, we would expect Dell to use the strategy of offering TruImage a $20-per-
copy contract price and TruImage to use the strategy of accepting the contract. Dell will 
earn additional profits of $15 million per year, and TruImage will earn profits of $3 mil-
lion per year. This outcome is called a subgame-perfect equilibrium. A subgame-perfect 
equilibrium is a Nash equilibrium in which no player can make himself or herself better 
off by changing his decision at any decision node. In our simple bargaining game, each 
player has only one decision to make. As we have seen, Dell’s profits are highest if it of-
fers the $20-per-copy contract price, and TruImage’s profits are highest if it accepts the 
contract. Typically, in sequential games of this type, there is only one subgame-perfect 
equilibrium.
Managers use decision trees like those in Figures 14.6 and 14.7 in business planning 
because they provide a systematic way of thinking through the implications of a strategy 
and of predicting the reactions of rivals. We can see the benefits of decision trees in the 
simple examples considered here. In the first example, Apple’s managers can conclude 
that charging a low price is more profitable than charging a high price. In the second 
example, Dell’s managers can conclude that TruImage’s threat to reject a $20-per-copy 
contract is not credible.
The Five Competitive Forces Model
We have seen that the number of competitors in an industry affects a firm’s ability to 
charge a price above average cost and earn an economic profit. The number of firms is 
not the only determinant of the level of competition in an industry, however. Michael 
Porter of the Harvard Business School has drawn on the research of a number of econo-
mists to develop a model that shows how five competitive forces determine the overall 
level of competition in an industry. Figure 14.8 illustrates Porter’s model.
We now look at each of the five competitive forces: (1) competition from existing 
firms, (2) the threat from potential entrants, (3) competition from substitute goods or 
services, (4) the bargaining power of buyers, and (5) the bargaining power of suppliers.
Competition from Existing Firms
We have already seen that competition among firms in an industry can lower prices and 
profits. As another example, Educational Testing Service (ETS) produces the Scholastic 
Aptitude Test (SAT) and the Graduate Record Exam (GRE). High school students ap-
plying to college take the SAT, and college students applying to graduate school take the 
14.4 LEARNING OBJECTIVE
Use the five competitive forces 
model to analyze competition 
in an industry.

 
The Five Competitive Forces Model 
475
GRE. In 2011, ETS charged a price of $49 to take the SAT, and it charged $160 to take 
the GRE. Part of the explanation for this large price difference is that ETS faces competi-
tion in the market for tests given to high school students applying to college, where the 
SAT competes with the ACT Assessment, produced by ACT, Inc. But there is no compe-
tition for the GRE test. As we saw earlier in this chapter, when there are only a few firms 
in a market, it is easier for them to implicitly collude and to charge a price close to the 
monopoly price. In this case, however, competition from a single firm was enough to 
cause ETS to keep the price of the SAT near the competitive level.
Competition in the form of advertising, better customer service, or longer warran-
ties can also reduce profits by raising costs. For example, online booksellers  Amazon 
.com, BarnesandNoble.com, and Buy.com have competed by offering low-cost—or 
free—shipping, by increasing their customer service staffs, and by building more ware-
houses to provide faster deliveries. These activities have raised the booksellers’ costs and 
reduced their profits.
The Threat from Potential Entrants
Firms face competition from companies that currently are not in the market but might 
enter. We have already seen how actions taken to deter entry can reduce profits. In our 
hypothetical example in the previous section, Apple charged a lower price and earned 
less profit to deter Dell’s entry. Business managers often take actions aimed at deterring 
entry. Some of these actions include advertising to create product loyalty, introducing 
new products—such as slightly different cereals or toothpastes—to fill market niches, 
and setting lower prices to keep profits at a level that makes entry less attractive.
Competition from Substitute Goods or Services
Firms are always vulnerable to competitors introducing a new product that fills a con-
sumer need better than their current product does. Consider the encyclopedia business. 
For decades, many parents bought expensive and bulky encyclopedias for their children 
attending high school or college. By the 1990s, computer software companies were of-
fering electronic encyclopedias that sold for a small fraction of the price of printed en-
cyclopedias. Encyclopedia Britannica and the other encyclopedia publishers responded 
by cutting prices and launching advertising campaigns aimed at showing the superiority 
of printed encyclopedias. Still, profits continued to decline, and by the end of the 1990s, 
most printed encyclopedias had disappeared.
The Bargaining Power of Buyers
If buyers have enough bargaining power, they can insist on lower prices, higher- quality 
products, or additional services. Automobile companies, for example, have  significant 
bargaining power in the tire market, which tends to lower tire prices and limit the

C H A P T E R  1 4  Oligopoly: Firms in Less Competitive Markets
Can We Predict Which Firms Will 
Continue to Be Successful?
For years, economists and business strategists believed that 
market structure was the most important factor in explain-
ing the ability of some firms to continue earning economic profits. For example, most 
economists argued that during the first few decades after World War II, steel compa-
nies in the United States earned economic profits because barriers to entry were high, 
there were few firms in the industry, and competition among firms was low. In con-
trast, restaurants were seen as less profitable because barriers to entry were low and the 
industry was intensely competitive. One problem with this approach to analyzing the 
profitability of firms is that it does not explain how firms in the same industry can have 
very different levels of profit.
Today, economists and business strategists put greater emphasis on the character-
istics of individual firms and the strategies their managers use to continue to earn eco-
nomic profits. This approach helps explain why Nucor continues to be a profitable steel 
company while Bethlehem Steel, at one time the second-largest steel producer in the 
United States, was forced into bankruptcy. It also explains why Dell, which began as a 
small company Michael Dell ran from his dorm room at the University of Texas, went 
on to become extremely profitable and an industry leader, while other computer com-
panies have disappeared.
Is it possible to draw general conclusions about which business strategies are likely 
to be successful in the future? A number of business analysts have tried to identify strat-
egies that have made firms successful and have recommended those strategies to other 
firms. Although books with these recommendations are often bestsellers, they have a 
mixed record in identifying winning strategies. For instance, in 1982, Thomas J. Peters 
and Robert H. Waterman, Jr., published In Search of Excellence: Lessons from America’s 
Best-Run Companies. The book was favorably reviewed by business magazines and sold 
more than 3 million copies. Peters and Waterman identified 43 companies that were 
the best at using eight key strategies to “stay on top of the heap.” But just two years after 
the book was published, an article in BusinessWeek pointed out that 14 of the 43 com-
panies were experiencing significant financial difficulties. The article noted: “It comes 
as a shock that so many companies have fallen from grace so quickly—and it also raises 
some questions. Were these companies so excellent in the first place?”
Making 
the 
Connection
profitability of tire manufacturers. Some retailers have significant buying power over their 
suppliers. For instance, Wal-Mart has required many of its suppliers to alter their distribu-
tion systems to accommodate Wal-Mart’s need to control the stocks of goods in its stores.
The Bargaining Power of Suppliers
If many firms can supply an input and the input is not specialized, the suppliers are 
unlikely to have the bargaining power to limit a firm’s profits. For instance, suppliers 
of paper napkins to McDonald’s restaurants have very little bargaining power. With 
only a single or a few suppliers of an input, however, the purchasing firm may face a 
high price. During the 1930s and 1940s, for example, the Technicolor Company was 
the only  producer of the cameras and film that studios needed to produce color movies. 
 Technicolor charged the studios high prices to use its cameras, and it had the power to 
insist that only its technicians could operate the cameras. The only alternative for the 
movie studios was to make black-and-white movies.
As with other competitive forces, the bargaining power of suppliers can change over 
time. For instance, when IBM chose Microsoft to supply the operating system for its per-
sonal computers, Microsoft was a small company with very limited bargaining power. 
As Microsoft’s Windows operating system became standard in more than 90 percent of 
personal computers, this large market share increased Microsoft’s bargaining power.
Although its business strategy had  
once been widely admired, Circuit  
City declared bankruptcy in 2009.

 
Conclusion 
477
Conclusion
Firms are locked in a never-ending struggle to earn economic profits. As noted in the 
two preceding chapters, competition erodes economic profits. Even in the oligopolies 
discussed in this chapter, firms have difficulty earning economic profits in the long run. 
We have seen that firms attempt to avoid the effects of competition in various ways. For 
example, they can stake out a secure niche in the market, they can engage in implicit 
collusion with competing firms, or they can attempt to have the government impose 
barriers to entry. An Inside Look on the next page discusses how Intel produced a new 
processing chip to remain profitable in the market for laptop computers.
In 2002, Jim Collins published Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the 
Leap . . . and Others Don’t, with the goal of determining how companies can “achieve 
 enduring greatness.” Although this book also sold 3 million copies, not all of the 11 
“great companies” it identified were able to remain successful. For instance, Circuit City 
was forced to file for bankruptcy in 2009, and Fannie Mae avoided bankruptcy only 
 after the federal government largely took it over in 2008.
These two books, and many others like them, provide useful analyses of the busi-
ness strategies of successful firms. That many of the firms highlighted in these books 
are unable to sustain their success, though, should not be surprising. Many successful 
strategies can be copied—and, often, improved on—by competitors. Even in oligopolies, 
competition can quickly erode profits and even turn a successful firm into an unsuc-
cessful one. It remains difficult to predict which currently successful firms will maintain 
their success.

Why Can’t You Find a Cheap PlayStation 3?
At the beginning of this chapter, we asked you to consider why the price of the PlayStation 3 
320GB game system is almost the same at every large retailer, from Amazon to Wal-Mart. Why 
don’t these retailers seem to compete on price for this type of product? In this chapter, we have 
seen that if big retailers were engaged in a one-time game of pricing PlayStations, they would be 
in a prisoner’s dilemma and would probably all charge a low price. However, we have also seen 
that pricing PlayStations is actually a repeated game because the retailers will be selling the game 
system in competition over a long period of time. In this situation, it is more likely that the retailers  
will arrive at a cooperative equilibrium, in which they will all charge a high price; this is good news 
for the profits of the retailers but bad news for consumers! This is one of many insights that game 
theory provides into the business strategies of oligopolists.

The projected thickness of the 
new Intel-powered device would 
make it the sleekest laptop in the mar-
ketplace after Apple’s MacBook Air 15 
model, which ranges from .11 to .68 
inches.
The devices will be based on  
Intel’s “Ivy Bridge,” a new generation 
of chips made with 22 nanometer 
manufacturing technology and the 
3-D transistor the company unveiled 
early in May. It is slated to be on the 
market by 2012, Intel said.
The new transistor, with in-
creased density, will make more pow-
erful computing devices, it said.
 Also by 2012, a new Intel chip 
designed for tablets and smartphones, 
named “Medfield,” will be launched. 
It will give the mobile devices longer 
use-time, advanced imaging and more 
power efficiency, the company said.
Intel general manager for the 
Asia-Pacific region Navin Shenoy 
acknowledged the market is experi-
encing significant changes with “the 
explosion of smartphones and tablets.”
“The industry is in constant 
change,” he said. “We’re more and

ing sticks forever.”
“We win when we go after and

Intel Corp. is touting a hybrid laptop 
0.8 inches (20 mm) thick with sleek 
tablet computing features and ultra-
sharp visual images that it hopes will 
create a market bridging traditional 
PCs and new devices.
The laptop also represents what 
the U.S. technology giant promises 
its latest generation of processors 
will be able to deliver by 2012, when 
they power new computers produced 
by companies like Taiwan’s AsusTek 
Computer Inc.
 “Computing is taking many 
forms,” Intel executive vice president 
Sean Maloney said Tuesday at the 
opening of Taipei’s Computex, the 
world’s second-largest computing show.
He said that by the end of 2012, 
Intel aims to shift 40 percent of con-
sumer laptops to its “Ultrabook” 
model, a new category of thin and 
light mobile computers.
Like many other tech companies, 
Intel is under immense pressure from 
Apple Inc., whose iPhones and iPads 
have swept through global markets 
with the force of a hurricane and show 
no signs of slowing.
 Maloney described the Ultra-
book as a laptop-tablet hybrid, featur-
ing touch screens and instant log on, 
all with a price of less than $1,000.

return. If Apple decides not to  compete with 
the new Intel model, Intel will earn 30 per-
cent and Apple will earn nothing in this mar-
ket. Because 20 percent is higher than the 
minimum 15 percent required  return, we 
can conclude that Apple will  enter the mar-
ket and both firms will earn a 20 percent 
return. 
But suppose that Intel determines that 
its position relative to Apple is that shown 
in Figure 2. If Apple enters this market, both 
Apple and Intel will earn 10 percent returns. 
If Apple does not enter the market, Intel 
will earn a 30 percent return. Because 10 
percent is below the required return of 15 
percent, Apple will not enter the market. In 
this case, it turns out that whether Figure 1 
or Figure 2 more accurately describes the 
situation in this market is not important for 
Intel’s initial decision to sell the Ultrabook. 
Whether Apple enters the market or not, 
Intel will still earn a return greater than 15 
percent. Therefore, Intel should sell the 
Ultrabook. 
c Oligopoly firms often try to introduce 
new products to fill consumer needs 
better than existing products can, which is 
what Intel is attempting to do with the Ultra-
book. Intel realizes that the computer mar-
ket changes quickly, and the company must 
adapt to these rapid changes by introduc-
ing new and better products to remain 
competitive, relevant, and profitable. 
Thinking Critically
1. Intel is hoping that its strategy to de-
velop the Ultrabook will increase its 
share of the laptop computer market. 
What risks does the company face that 
could defeat its strategy?
2. Apply the five competitive forces model 
to Intel. Cite one example of each of the 
competitive forces that Intel faces.
of its competitors. With the Ultrabook, Intel 
expects to compete with firms such as Ap-
ple. This means Intel has to account for the 
likelihood that its rivals will choose to de-
velop models with features similar to those 
of the Ultrabook. Intel plans to convert 40 
percent of consumer laptops to this new 
model.
b Intel announced that its Ultrabook will 
be priced under $1,000. In an oligopoly 
market, a firm’s profits depend not only on 
the price it chooses but on the price its 
 rivals choose. The figures below illustrate 
the competition between Intel and Apple, 
using two possible scenarios. In both 
 figures, we assume that Intel has  decided to 
sell its Ultrabook for $999, and Apple must 
then decide whether it should also develop 
a new, comparable computer for the same 
price. We assume that each  company needs 
a 15 percent return on its  investment in 
these computers to break even. In Figure 1, 
if Apple decides to  develop a new model, 
both companies will earn a 20 percent

Summary
An oligopoly is a market structure in which a small number of 
interdependent firms compete. Barriers to entry keep new firms 
from entering an industry. The three most important barriers to 
entry are economies of scale, ownership of a key input, and gov-
ernment barriers. Economies of scale are the most important 
barrier to entry. Economies of scale exist when a firm’s long-run 
average costs fall as it increases output. Government barriers in-
clude patents, licensing, and barriers to international trade. A pat-
ent is the exclusive right to a product for a period of 20 years from 
the date the patent is filed with the government.

Problems and Applications
 
1.5 Michael Porter has argued, “The intensity of competition 
in an industry is neither a matter of coincidence nor bad 
luck. Rather, competition in an industry is rooted in its 
underlying economic structure.” What does Porter mean 
by “economic structure”? What factors besides economic 
structure might be expected to determine the intensity of 
competition in an industry?

ing Industries and Competitors, (New York: The Free Press), 1980, p. 3.
 
1.6 In 2009, some analysts of the smartphone industry argued 
that Apple would be likely to offer a variety of iPhones, 
each with different features. One  observer  objected to this 
 argument, though, arguing, “ Selling  models  differentiated 
by hardware seems unlikely.  Different iPhones with very dif-
ferent physical specs could have far-reaching implications 
for Apple’s production methods, volumes and costs.” How 
would Apple’s costs be affected by offering different iPhones 
with “very different specs”? How would this change in costs 
be likely to affect the prices Apple charged for the iPhone? 
How would this change in costs be likely to affect the ability 
of other firms to compete against the iPhone?

or textiles, or lumber into three factories or mills!” The 
shoe, textiles, and lumber industries are very competitive,

 1.11 A historical account of the development of the cotton tex-
tile industry in England argued:
The cotton textile industry was shaped by ruth-
less competition. Rapid growth in  demand, 
low barriers to entry, frequent technological 
 innovations, and a high rate of firm bank-
ruptcy all combined to form an environment 
in which . . . oligopolistic competition became 
almost impossible.
 
 Explain how each of the factors described here would con-
tribute to making oligopolistic competition in the cotton

Using Game Theory to Analyze Oligopoly, pages 463–471
 14.2 
LEARNING OBJECTIVE: Use game theory to analyze the strategies of oligopolistic firms.
Summary
Because an oligopoly has only a few firms, interactions among 
those firms are particularly important. Game theory is the study 
of how people make decisions in situations in which attaining 
their goals depends on their interactions with others; in econom-
ics, it is the study of the decisions of firms in industries where the 
profits of each firm depend on its interactions with other firms. 
A business strategy refers to actions taken by a firm to achieve 
a goal, such as maximizing profits. Oligopoly games can be illus-
trated with a payoff matrix, which is a table that shows the pay-
offs that each firm earns from every combination of strategies 
by the firms. One possible outcome in oligopoly is collusion, 
which is an agreement among firms to charge the same price or 
otherwise not to compete. A cartel is a group of firms that col-
lude by agreeing to restrict output to increase prices and prof-
its. In a cooperative equilibrium, firms cooperate to increase 
their mutual payoff. In a noncooperative equilibrium, firms do 
not cooperate but pursue their own self-interest. A dominant 
strategy is a strategy that is the best for a firm, no matter what 
strategies other firms use. A Nash equilibrium is a situation in 
which each firm chooses the best strategy, given the strategies 
chosen by other firms. A situation in which pursuing dominant 
strategies results in noncooperation that leaves everyone worse

off is called a prisoner’s dilemma. Because many business situa-
tions are repeated games, firms may end up implicitly colluding 
to keep prices high. With price leadership, one firm takes the 
lead in announcing a price change, which is then matched by the 
other firms in the industry.

Problems and Applications
 
2.6 Bob and Tom are two criminals who have been arrested 
for burglary. The police put Tom and Bob in separate cells. 
They offer to let Bob go free if he confesses to the crime 
and testifies against Tom. Bob also is told that he will serve 
a 15-year sentence if he remains silent while Tom con-
fesses. If Bob confesses and Tom also confesses, they will 
each serve a 10-year sentence. Separately, the police make 
the same offer to Tom. Assume that Bob and Tom know 
that if they both remain silent, the police have only enough 
evidence to convict them of a lesser crime, and they will 
both serve 3-year sentences.
 
a. Use the information provided to write a payoff matrix 
for Bob and Tom.
 
b. Does Bob have a dominant strategy? If so, what is it?
 
c. Does Tom have a dominant strategy? If so, what is it?
 
d. What sentences do Bob and Tom serve? How might 
they have avoided this outcome?
 
2.7 Explain how collusion makes firms better off. Given the 
incentives to collude, briefly explain why every industry 
doesn’t become a cartel.
 
2.8 Under “early decision” college admission plans, students 
apply to a college in the fall and, if they are accepted, they 
must enroll in that college. According to an article in Busi-
nessWeek, Yale president Richard Levin argues that early 
decision plans put too much pressure on students to de-
cide early in their senior years which college to attend. 
Levin has proposed abolishing early decision plans. But 
the author of the article is doubtful that this will succeed 
because “as long as some big-name schools offer early ad-
missions, the others feel they must, too, or lose out on the 
best talent.” Do you agree with this conclusion? How can 
game theory help analyze this situation?

Early Decision,” BusinessWeek, March 11, 2002.
 
2.9 Baseball players who hit the most home runs relative to 
other players usually receive the highest pay. Beginning in 
the mid-1990s, the typical baseball player became signifi-
cantly stronger and more muscular. As one baseball an-
nouncer put it, “The players of 20 years ago look like stick 
figures compared with the players of today.” As a result, 
the average number of home runs hit each year increased 
dramatically. Some of the increased strength that baseball 
players gained came from more weight training and better 
conditioning and diet. As some players admitted, though, 
some of the increased strength came from taking steroids 
and other illegal drugs. Taking steroids can significantly 
increase the risk of developing cancer and other medical 
problems.
 
a. In these circumstances, are baseball players in a pris-
oner’s dilemma? Carefully explain.
 
b. Major League Baseball has begun testing players for 
steroids and fining and suspending players who are 
caught using steriods (or other illegal muscle- building 
drugs). Has this testing made baseball players as a 
group better off or worse off? Briefly explain.
 2.10 Soldiers in battle may face a prisoner’s dilemma. If all sol-
diers stand and fight, the chance that the soldiers, as a unit, 
will survive is maximized. If there is a significant chance 
that the soldiers will lose the battle, an individual soldier 
may maximize his chance of survival by running away 
while the other soldiers hold off the enemy by fighting. If 
all soldiers run away, however, many of them are likely to 
be killed or captured by the enemy because no one is left 
to hold off the enemy. In ancient times, the Roman army 
practiced “decimation.” If a unit of soldiers was guilty of 
running away during a battle or committing other cow-
ardly acts, all would be lined up, and every tenth soldier 
would be killed by being run through with a sword. No at-
tempt was made to distinguish between soldiers in the unit 
who had fought well and those who had been cowardly. 
Briefly explain under what condition the Roman system 
of decimation was likely to have solved the prisoner’s di-
lemma of soldiers running away in battle.

ban on advertising beer on television be likely to increase 
or decrease the profits of beer companies? Briefly explain.
 2.12 [Related to Solved Problem 14.2 on page 465] Begin-
ning in 2003, the U.S. government spent billions of dollars 
rebuilding the infrastructure damaged by the war in Iraq. 
Much of the work was carried out by construction and en-
gineering firms that had to bid for the business. Suppose, 
hypothetically, that only two companies—Bechtel and 
 Halliburton—enter the bidding and that each firm is decid-
ing whether to bid either $4 billion or $5 billion. (Remem-
ber that in this type of bidding, the winning bid is the low 
bid because the bid represents the amount the government 
will have to pay to have the work done.) Each firm will have 
costs of $2.5 billion to do the work. If they both make the 
same bid, they will both be hired and will split the work and 
the profits. If one makes a low bid and one makes a high

nies expect to be bidding on many similar projects in 
future years?
 2.13 [Related to Solved Problem 14.2 on page 465] Radio fre-
quency identification (RFID) tracking tags may ultimately 
replace bar codes. With this system, a radio signal auto-
matically records the arrival of a product in a warehouse, its 
shipment to a store, and its purchase by the consumer. Sup-
pose that Wal-Mart and Target are independently deciding 
whether to stick with bar codes or switch to RFID tags to 
monitor the flow of products. Because many suppliers sell to 
both Wal-Mart and Target, it is much less costly for suppliers 
to use one system or the other rather than to use both. The 
following payoff matrix shows the profits per year for each 
company resulting from the interaction of their strategies.

c. Briefly explain whether there is a Nash equilibrium in 
this game.

A student argues, “The prisoner’s dilemma game is unreal-
istic. Each player’s strategy is based on the assumption that 
the other player won’t cooperate. But if each player assumes 
that the other player will cooperate, the ‘dilemma’ disappears.” 
Briefly explain whether you agree with this argument.
 2.15 [Related to the Making the Connection on page 466] 
We made the argument that a bidder on an eBay auction 
has a dominant strategy of bidding only once, with that bid 
being the maximum the bidder would be willing to pay.
 
a. Is it possible that a bidder might receive useful infor-
mation during the auction, particularly from the dollar 
amounts other bidders are bidding? If so, how does that 
change a bidder’s optimal strategy?
 
b. Many people recommend the practice of “sniping,” or 
placing your bid at the last second before the auction 
ends. Is there a connection between sniping and your 
answer to part a?

The following appeared in an article in the Wall Street Jour-
nal: “Last week, true to discount roots dating to 1971, South-
west [Airlines] launched a summer fare sale on domestic 
flights, with one-way prices as low as $49. As in the past, ma-
jor competitors were forced to follow suit.” Why would other 
airlines be “forced” to follow Southwest’s fare decrease? Does 
your answer change if you learn that this fare decrease took 
place during an economic recession, when incomes and the 
demand for airline travel were falling? Briefly explain.

Skies,” Wall Street Journal, March 25, 2009.

Airlines often find themselves in price wars. Consider the

a. What (if any) is the dominant strategy for each firm?
 
b. Is this game a prisoner’s dilemma?
 
c. How could repeated playing of the game change the 
strategy each firm uses?
 2.18 [Related to the Making the Connection on page 468] Until 
the late 1990s, airlines would post proposed changes in ticket 
prices on computer reservation systems several days before the 
new ticket prices went into effect. Then the federal government 
took action to end this practice. Now airlines can post prices on 
their reservation systems only for tickets that are immediately 
available for sale. Why would the federal government object to 
the old system of posting prices before they went into effect?

 2.20 DemandTec is a firm that provides software to retailers, 
such as department stores, that allow the firms to make 
better decisions about when to increase or cut prices, given 
changes in demand, changes in costs, and other factors. 
DemandTec and firms selling similar software have al-
lowed smaller retailers to adopt pricing strategies that had 
long been used by larger retailers, such as Wal-Mart. Ac-
cording to an article in the Wall Street Journal, use of this 
software has reduced the amount of price cutting that re-
tail firms engage in following a fall in demand. Is a decline 
in price cutting good news for consumers? Good news for 
the firms involved? Good news for both? Briefly explain.

that Nigeria’s profit is $15 million when Nigeria chooses 
“low output” and $10 million when it chooses “high 
output.”
 
a. Create the payoff matrix for this new situation, assum-
ing that Saudi Arabia and Nigeria choose their output 
levels simultaneously. Is there a Nash equilibrium to 
this game? If so, what is it?
 
b. Draw the decision tree for this situation (using the 
values from the payoff matrix you created in part a), 
assuming that Saudi Arabia and Nigeria make their 
decisions sequentially: First, Saudi Arabia chooses its 
output level, and then Nigeria responds by choosing its 
output level. Is there a Nash equilibrium in this game? 
If so, what is it?

the reason for any differences in the outcomes of these 
two games.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE: Use sequential games to analyze business strategies.
Summary
Recent work in game theory has focused on actions firms can take 
to deter the entry of new firms into an industry. Deterring entry 
can be analyzed using a sequential game, where first one firm 
makes a decision and then another firm reacts to that decision. 
Sequential games can be illustrated using decision trees.

3.4 [Related to the Chapter Opener on page 459] This 
chapter describes how firms can create barriers to deter 
firms from entering an industry:
One factor firms consider in pricing a new prod-
uct is the effect different prices have on the like-
lihood that competitors will enter the market. 
A high price might lead to high profits if other 
firms do not enter the market, but if a high price 
attracts entry from other firms, it might actually 
result in lower profits. A low price, by deterring 
entry, might lead to higher profits.

Summary
Michael Porter of Harvard Business School argues that the state 
of competition in an industry is determined by five competitive 
forces: the degree of competition among existing firms, the threat 
from new entrants, competition from substitute goods or ser-
vices, the bargaining power of buyers, and the bargaining power 
of suppliers.

Economics in Your Life
Why Can’t I Watch the NFL Network?
Are you a fan of the National Football League? Would you like to see more NFL-related program-
ming on television? If so, you’re not alone. The NFL concluded that there was so much demand for 
more football programming that it began its own football network, the NFL Network.
Unfortunately for many football fans, the NFL Network is not available to many households 
that have cable television, including, as of August 2011, Time Warner Cable that serves the majority 
of cable customers in New York, the largest television market in the United States. Why are some of 
the largest cable TV systems unwilling to include the NFL Network in their channel lineups? Why are 
some systems requiring customers who want the NFL Network to upgrade to more expensive chan-
nel packages? As you read this chapter, see if you can answer these questions. You can check your 
answers against those we provide on page 508 at the end of this chapter.
stations and charging for premium chan-
nels, which allowed cable networks such as 
Home Box Office (HBO) and Showtime to 
develop.
A firm needs a license from the city 
government to enter a local cable television 
market. Until 2008, Time Warner Cable was 
the only provider of cable TV in the Man-
hattan borough of New York City; Time 
Warner had a monopoly. Few firms in the 
United States are monopolies because usu-
ally in a market system, whenever a firm 
earns economic profits, other firms will en-
ter its market. Therefore, it is very difficult 
for a firm to remain the only provider of a 
good or service. In this chapter, we will de-
velop an economic model of monopoly that 
can help analyze how cable systems in some 
cities and other firms that lack competition 
in their markets affect the economy.
AN INSIDE LOOK AT POLICY on 
page 510 discusses the entry of Verizon 
into the market for cable TV in upstate New 
York to compete with Time Warner Cable.
Today, most people can hardly imagine life 
without cable television. The first cable 
systems were established in the 1940s, in 
cities that were too small to support broad-
cast stations. In the early years, the cable 
industry grew slowly because the technol-
ogy did not exist to rebroadcast the signals 
of distant stations, so cable systems offered 
just a few channels. By 1970, only about 7 
percent of households had cable television. 
In addition, the Federal Communications 
Commission (FCC)—the U.S. govern-
ment agency that regulates the television 
industry—placed restrictions on both 
rebroadcasting the signals of distant sta-
tions and the fees that cable systems could 
charge for “premium channels” that would 
show movies or sporting events. In the late 
1970s, two key developments occurred: 
First, satellite relay technology made it 
feasible for local cable systems to receive 
signals relayed by satellite from distant 
broadcast stations. Second, Congress loos-
ened regulations on rebroadcasting distant

A
lthough few firms are monopolies, the economic model of monopoly can be 
quite useful. As we saw in Chapter 12, even though perfectly competitive markets 
are rare, this market model provides a benchmark for how a firm acts in the most 
competitive situation possible: when it is in an industry with many firms that 
all supply the same product. Monopoly provides a benchmark for the other extreme, where a 
firm is the only one in its market and, therefore, faces no competition from other firms sup-
plying its product. The monopoly model is also useful in analyzing situations in which firms 
agree to collude, or not compete, and act together as if they were a monopoly. As we will dis-
cuss in this chapter, collusion is illegal in the United States, but it occasionally happens.
Monopolies pose a dilemma for the government. Should the government allow monop-
olies to exist? Are there circumstances in which the government should actually promote the 
existence of monopolies? Should the government regulate the prices monopolies charge? If 
so, will such price regulation increase economic efficiency? In this chapter, we will explore 
these public policy issues.
Is Any Firm Ever Really a Monopoly?
A monopoly is a firm that is the only seller of a good or service that does not have a 
close substitute. Because substitutes of some kind exist for just about every product, can 
any firm really be a monopoly? The answer is “yes,” provided that the substitutes are 
not “close” substitutes. But how do we decide whether a substitute is a close substitute? 
A narrow definition of monopoly that some economists use is that a firm has a mo-
nopoly if it can ignore the actions of all other firms. In other words, other firms must 
not be producing close substitutes if the monopolist can ignore the other firms’ prices. 
For example, candles are a substitute for electric lights, but your local electric company 
can ignore candle prices because however low the price of candles becomes, almost no 
customers will give up using electric lights and switch to candles. Therefore, your local 
electric company is clearly a monopoly.
Many economists, however, use a broader definition of monopoly. For example, sup-
pose Donn Johnson owns the only pizza parlor in a small town. (We will consider later 
the question of why a market may have only a single firm.) Does Donn have a monopoly? 
Substitutes for pizza certainly exist. If the price of pizza is too high, people will switch 
to hamburgers or fried chicken or some other food instead. People do not have to eat at 
Donn’s or starve. Donn is in competition with the local McDonald’s and KFC, among 
other firms. So, Donn does not meet the narrow definition of a monopoly. But many 
economists would still argue that it is useful to think of Donn as having a monopoly.
Although hamburgers and fried chicken are substitutes for pizza, competition from 
firms selling them is not enough to keep Donn from earning economic profits. We saw 
in Chapter 12 that when firms earn economic profits, we can expect new firms to enter 
the industry, and in the long run, the economic profits are competed away. Donn’s profits  
will not be competed away as long as he is the only seller of pizza. Using the broader 
definition, Donn has a monopoly because there are no other firms selling a substitute 
close enough that his economic profits are competed away in the long run.

Is Google a Monopoly?
As we will discuss later in this chapter, the federal government 
can take legal action against a firm under the antitrust laws if the 
government believes that the firm has created a monopoly. In 
mid-2011, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC)  indicated 
that it was investigating whether Google had violated the antitrust laws. The European 
Union, which is an organization of 27 European countries, has similar rules against firms 
forming monopolies. The European Commission enforces these rules. In early 2011,

Where Do Monopolies Come From?
Because monopolies do not face competition, every firm would like to have a monopoly. 
But to have a monopoly, barriers to entering the market must be so high that no other 
firms can enter. Barriers to entry may be high enough to keep out competing firms for 
four main reasons:
 1. A government blocks the entry of more than one firm into a market.
 2. One firm has control of a key resource necessary to produce a good.
 3. There are important network externalities in supplying the good or service.
 4. Economies of scale are so large that one firm has a natural monopoly.
15.2 LEARNING OBJECTIVE
Explain the four main reasons 
monopolies arise.
Google has a dominant market 
share in the United States and in 
Europe. Can other search engines 
effectively compete?
Microsoft filed a complaint with the European Commission that 
Google was using its dominant position as an Internet search engine 
to exclude competitors.
But is Google a monopoly? Clearly, Google is not the only In-
ternet search option available. For example, Yahoo! has for a num-
ber of years operated a search engine, Microsoft operates the Bing 
search engine, and there are a number of smaller search engines. 
Critics point out, though, that Google has a dominant market 
share of 70 percent in the United States and 90 percent in Europe. 
Can the other search engines effectively compete with Google? 
Microsoft argues that Google has taken steps to create an effective 
monopoly:
[Google] understands as well as anyone that search engines depend upon 
the openness of the Web in order to function properly. . . . Unfortunately, 
Google has engaged in a broadening pattern of walling off access to con-
tent and data that competitors need to provide search results to consum-
ers and to attract advertisers.
Microsoft was particularly concerned that Google was limiting the access of other 
search engines to YouTube, which Google owns: “Without proper access to YouTube, 
Bing and other search engines cannot stand with Google on an equal footing in return-
ing search results with links to YouTube videos and that, of course, drives more users 
away from competitors and to Google.” Microsoft also complained that Google was lim-
iting the access of other search engines to many of the books that Google had scanned 
and made available on the Web.
Google, naturally, takes a different view of its position. The company argues that its 
dominant market share is due to the higher quality of its search engine, not any attempts 
the company has made to reduce the access of other search engines to online content. In 
a response to the FTC investigation, Google noted, “We want [users of search engines] 
to stay with us because we’re innovating and making our products better—not because 
[they are] locked in.”
As we have seen, many economists consider a firm to have a monopoly if other 
firms are unable to compete away its profits in the long run. The debate over whether 
other search engines can compete with Google or whether it is effectively a monopoly is 
likely to continue.

C H A P T E R  1 5  Monopoly and Antitrust Policy
Government Action Blocks Entry
As we will discuss later in this chapter, governments ordinarily try to promote competi-
tion in markets, but sometimes governments take action to block entry into a market. In 
the United States, governments block entry in two main ways:
 1. By granting a patent or copyright to an individual or a firm, giving it the exclusive 
right to produce a product
 2. By granting a firm a public franchise, making it the exclusive legal provider of a good 
or service
Patents and Copyrights The U.S. government grants patents to firms that de-
velop new products or new ways of making existing products. A patent gives a firm 
the  exclusive right to a new product for a period of 20 years from the date the patent is 
filed with the government. Because Microsoft has a patent on the Windows operating 
system, other firms cannot sell their own versions of Windows. The government grants 
patents to encourage firms to spend money on the research and development neces-
sary to create new products. If other firms could have freely copied Windows, Microsoft 
would have been unlikely to spend the money necessary to develop it. Sometimes a firm 
is able to maintain a monopoly in the production of a good without patent protection, 
provided that it can keep secret how the product is made.
Patent protection is of vital importance to pharmaceutical firms as they develop 
new prescription drugs. Pharmaceutical firms start research and development work 
on a new prescription drug an average of 12 years before the drug is available for sale.  
A firm  applies for a patent about 10 years before it begins to sell the product. The aver-
age 10-year delay between the government granting a patent and the firm actually sell-
ing the drug is due to the federal Food and Drug Administration’s requirements that 
the firm demonstrate that the drug is both safe and effective. Therefore, during the 
period before the drug can be sold, the firm will have substantial costs to develop and 
test the drug. If the drug does not successfully make it to market, the firm will have a 
substantial loss.
Once a drug is available for sale, the profits the firm earns from the drug will in-
crease throughout the period of patent protection—which is usually about 10 years—as 
the drug becomes more widely known to doctors and patients. After the patent has ex-
pired, other firms are free to legally produce chemically identical drugs called generic 
drugs. Gradually, competition from generic drugs will eliminate the profits the original 
firm had been earning. For example, when patent protection expired for Glucophage, a 
diabetes drug manufactured by Bristol-Myers Squibb, sales of the drug declined by more 
than $1.5 billion in the first year due to competition from 12 generic versions of the 
drug produced by other firms. When the patent expired on Prozac, an antidepressant 
drug manufactured by Eli Lilly, sales dropped by more than 80 percent. Most economic 
profits from selling a prescription drug are eliminated 20 years after the drug is first  
offered for sale.
Patent The exclusive right to a 
product for a period of 20 years from 
the date the patent is filed with the 
government.
The End of the Christmas Plant 
Monopoly
In December, the poinsettia plant seems to be almost every-
where, decorating stores, restaurants, and houses. Although it 
may seem strange that anyone can have a monopoly on the production of a plant, for 
many years the Paul Ecke Ranch in Encinitas, California, had a monopoly on poinsettias.
The poinsettia is a wildflower native to Mexico. It was almost unknown in the United 
States before Albert Ecke, a German immigrant, began selling it in the early twentieth 
century at his flower stand in Hollywood, California. Unlike almost every other flower-
ing plant, the poinsettia blossoms in the winter. This timing, along with the plant’s strik-
ing red and green colors, makes the poinsettia ideal for Christmas decorating.

Where Do Monopolies Come From?

Just as the government grants a new product patent protection, it grants books, films, 
and pieces of music copyright protection. U.S. law grants the creator of a book, film, or 
piece of music the exclusive right to use the creation during the creator’s lifetime. The 
creator’s heirs retain this exclusive right for 70 years after the creator’s death. In effect, 
copyrights create monopolies for the copyrighted items. Without copyrights, individuals 
and firms would be less likely to invest in creating new books, films, and software.
Public Franchises In some cases, the government grants a firm a public franchise 
that allows it to be the only legal provider of a good or service. For example, state and lo-
cal governments often designate one company as the sole provider of electricity, natural 
gas, or water.
Occasionally, a government may decide to provide certain services directly to con-
sumers through a public enterprise. This is much more common in Europe than in the 
United States. For example, the governments in most European countries own the rail-
road systems. In the United States, many city governments provide water and sewage 
service themselves rather than rely on private firms.
Control of a Key Resource
Another way for a firm to become a monopoly is by controlling a key resource. This 
happens infrequently because most resources, including raw materials such as oil or iron 
ore, are widely available from a variety of suppliers. There are, however, a few promi-
nent examples of monopolies based on control of a key resource, such as the Aluminum 
Company of America (Alcoa) and the International Nickel Company of Canada.
For many years until the 1940s, Alcoa either owned or had long-term contracts to 
buy nearly all of the available bauxite, the mineral needed to produce aluminum. With-
out access to bauxite, competing firms had to use recycled aluminum, which limited the 
amount of aluminum they could produce. Similarly, the International Nickel Company 
of Canada controlled more than 90 percent of available nickel supplies. Competition 
in the nickel market increased when the Petsamo nickel fields in northern Russia were 
developed after World War II.

Albert Ecke’s son, Paul, discovered that by grafting together two varieties of poin-
settias, it was possible to have multiple branches grow from one stem. The result was 
a plant that had more leaves and was much more colorful than conventional poinset-
tias. Paul Ecke did not attempt to patent his new technique for growing poinsettias. But 
because the Ecke family kept the technique secret for decades, it was able to maintain 
a monopoly on the commercial production of the plants. Unfortunately for the Ecke 
 family—but fortunately for consumers—a university researcher discovered the tech-
nique and published it in an academic journal.
New firms quickly entered the industry, and the price of poinsettias plummeted. 
Soon consumers could purchase them for as little as three for $10. At those prices, the 
Ecke family’s firm was unable to earn economic profits. Eventually, Paul Ecke III, the 
owner of the firm, decided to give up commercial production of poinsettias on his 
family’s ranch. He sold off more than half the firm’s land to fund new state-of-the-art 
greenhouses and research into new varieties of plants that he hoped would earn the firm 
economic profits once again.

Are Diamond Profits Forever?  
The De Beers Diamond Monopoly
The most famous monopoly based on control of a raw mate-
rial is the De Beers diamond mining and marketing company 
of South Africa. Before the 1860s, diamonds were extremely rare. Only a few pounds 
of diamonds were produced each year, primarily from Brazil and India. Then in 1870, 
enormous deposits of diamonds were discovered along the Orange River in South  
Africa. It became possible to produce thousands of pounds of diamonds per year, and 
the owners of the new mines feared that the price of diamonds would plummet. To 
avoid financial disaster, the mine owners decided in 1888 to merge and form De Beers 
Consolidated Mines, Ltd.
De Beers became one of the most profitable and longest-lived monopolies in his-
tory. The company has carefully controlled the supply of diamonds to keep prices high. 
As new diamond deposits were discovered in Russia and Zaire, De Beers was able to 
maintain prices by buying most of the new supplies.
Because diamonds are rarely destroyed, De Beers has always worried about compe-
tition from the resale of stones. Heavily promoting diamond engagement and wedding 
rings with the slogan “A Diamond Is Forever” was a way around this problem. Because 
engagement and wedding rings have great sentimental value, they are seldom resold, 
even by the heirs of the original recipients. De Beers advertising has been successful even 
in some countries, such as Japan, that have had no custom of giving diamond engage-
ment rings. As the populations in De Beers’s key markets age, its advertising in recent 
years has focused on middle-aged men presenting diamond rings to their wives as sym-
bols of financial success and continuing love and on professional women buying “right-
hand rings” for themselves.
Over the years, competition has gradually increased in the diamond business. By 
2000, De Beers directly controlled only about 40 percent of world diamond production. 
The company became concerned about the amount it was spending to buy diamonds 
from other sources to keep them off the market. It decided to abandon its strategy of at-
tempting to control the worldwide supply of diamonds and to concentrate instead on dif-
ferentiating its diamonds by relying on its name recognition. Each De Beers diamond is 
now marked with a microscopic brand—a “Forevermark”—to reassure consumers of its 
high quality. Other firms, such as BHP Billiton, which owns mines in northern Canada, 
have followed suit by branding their diamonds. Whether consumers will pay attention to 
brands on diamonds remains to be seen, although through 2011, the branding strategy 
had helped De Beers to maintain a 35 to 40 percent share of the diamond market.

Network Externalities
There are network externalities in the consumption of a product if its usefulness 
 increases with the number of people who use it. If you owned the only HD televison in 
the world, for example, it would not be very valuable because firms would not have an 
incentive to develop HD programming. The more HD televisions there are in use, the 
more valuable they become to consumers.
Network externalities A situation 
in which the usefulness of a product 
increases with the number of 
consumers who use it.

 
Where Do Monopolies Come From? 
493
Some economists argue that network externalities can serve as barriers to entry. For 
example, in the early 1980s, Microsoft gained an advantage over other software compa-
nies by developing MS-DOS, the operating system for the first IBM personal computers. 
Because IBM sold more computers than any other company, software developers wrote 
many application programs for MS-DOS. The more people who used MS-DOS–based 
programs, the greater the value to a consumer of using an MS-DOS–based program. 
By the 1990s, Microsoft had replaced MS-DOS with Windows. Today, Windows has an 
85 percent share in the market for personal computer operating systems, with Apple’s 
operating system having a 10 percent share, and other operating systems, including 
the open-source Linux system, having shares of about 1 percent or less. If another firm 
introduced a new operating system, some economists argue that relatively few people 
would use it initially, and few applications would run on it, which would limit the oper-
ating system’s value to other consumers.
eBay was the first Internet site to attract a significant number of people to its  online 
auctions. Once a large number of people began to use eBay to buy and sell collectibles, 
antiques, and many other products, it became a more valuable place to buy and sell. 
 Yahoo.com, Amazon.com, and other Internet sites eventually started online auctions, 
but they had difficulty attracting buyers and sellers. On eBay, a buyer expects to find 
more sellers, and a seller expects to find more potential buyers than on Amazon or 
other auction sites.
As these examples show, from a firm’s point of view, network externalities can set off 
a virtuous cycle: If a firm can attract enough customers initially, it can attract  additional 
customers because the value of its product has been increased by more people using it, 
which attracts even more customers, and so on. With products such as computer oper-
ating systems and online auctions, it might be difficult for new firms to enter the market 
and compete away the profits being earned by the first firm in the market.
Economists engage in considerable debate, however, about the extent to which net-
work externalities are important barriers to entry in the business world. Some econo-
mists argue that Microsoft and eBay have dominant positions primarily because they 
are efficient in offering products that satisfy consumer preferences rather than because 
of the effects of network externalities. In this view, the advantages existing firms gain 
from network externalities would not be enough to protect them from competing firms 
offering better products. In other words, a firm entering the operating system market 
with a program better than Windows or a firm offering an Internet auction site better 
than eBay would be successful despite the effects of network externalities. (We discussed 
this point in more detail in Chapter 10.) In fact, the market shares of both Windows and 
eBay have been slowly declining in recent years.
Natural Monopoly
We saw in Chapter 11 that economies of scale exist when a firm’s long-run average costs 
fall as it increases the quantity of output it produces. A natural monopoly occurs when 
economies of scale are so large that one firm can supply the entire market at a lower av-
erage total cost than two or more firms. In that case, there is really “room” in the market 
for only one firm.
Figure 15.1 shows the average total cost curve for a firm producing electricity and 
the total demand for electricity in the firm’s market. Notice that the average total cost 
curve is still falling when it crosses the demand curve at point A. If the firm is a mo-
nopoly and produces 30 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity per year, its average total 
cost of production will be $0.04 per kilowatt-hour. Suppose instead that two firms are 
in the market, each producing half of the market output, or 15 billion kilowatt-hours 
per year. Assume that each firm has the same average total cost curve. The figure shows 
that producing 15 billion kilowatt-hours would move each firm back up its average cost 
curve so that the average cost of producing electricity would rise to $0.06 per kilowatt-
hour (point B). In this case, if one of the firms expands production, it will move down 
the average total cost curve. With lower average costs, it will be able to offer electricity at 
a lower price than the other firm can offer. Eventually, the other firm will be driven out

of business, and the remaining firm will have a monopoly. Because a monopoly would 
develop automatically—or naturally—in this market, it is a natural monopoly.
Natural monopolies are most likely to occur in markets where fixed costs are very 
large relative to variable costs. For example, a firm that produces electricity must make a 
substantial investment in machinery and equipment necessary to generate the electric-
ity and in the wires and cables necessary to distribute it. Once the initial investment has 
been made, however, the marginal cost of producing another kilowatt-hour of electric-
ity is relatively small.

Average Total Cost Curve for a 
Natural Monopoly
With a natural monopoly, the average total 
cost curve is still falling when it crosses the 
demand curve (point A). If only one firm is 
producing electric power in the market, and 
it produces where the average cost curve 
intersects the demand curve, average total 
cost will equal $0.04 per kilowatt-hour of 
electricity produced. If the market is di-
vided between two firms, each producing 
15 billion kilowatt-hours, the average cost 
of producing electricity rises to $0.06 per 
kilowatt-hour (point B). In this case, if one 
firm expands production, it can move down 
the average total cost curve, lower its price, 
and drive the other firm out of business.
Solving the Problem
Step 1: Review the chapter material. This problem is about natural monopoly, so you 
may want to review the section “Natural Monopoly,” which begins on page 493.
Step 2: Answer part a. by drawing a natural monopoly graph and explaining why 
OpenTable would have lower average costs than new entrants to the market.  
If Stewart is correct that OpenTable is actually a natural monopoly, the 
Solved Problem 15.2
Is the OpenTable Web Site  
a Natural Monopoly?
OpenTable is a Web site and smartphone application that 
allows people to make restaurant reservations online. 
OpenTable charges participating restaurants a fee for each 
reservation. As business writer James Stewart wrote in the 
Wall Street Journal, “You simply go to the site, choose your 
neighborhood, enter your requested date, time and number 
of diners, and OpenTable shows all available restaurants with 
specific times available.” Stewart argued that the site is a natu-
ral monopoly because “users are attracted to the site with the 
largest number of listings, and restaurants are attracted to the 
site with the largest number of users.”
a.  Assuming that Stewart is correct, draw a graph show-
ing the market for online restaurant reservation sites. Be 
sure that the graph contains the demand for online res-
taurant reservations and OpenTable’s average total cost 
curve. Explain why OpenTable would have lower aver-
age costs than would a new site that enters the market to 
compete against it.
b.  Does the number of years OpenTable has been operating 
affect how you evaluate Stewart’s claim that the business 
is a natural monopoly? Briefly explain.

Make sure your average total cost curve is still declining when it crosses the 
demand curve. As shown in the figure, the market for online reservations is a 
natural monopoly because if one firm can supply Q1 online reservations at an 
average total cost of ATC1, then dividing the business equally between two firms 
each supplying Q2 online reservations would raise average total cost to ATC2.
OpenTable’s fixed costs for servers, software programming, and market-
ing are very large relative to its variable costs. OpenTable’s marginal cost of 
accommodating one more visitor to its site will be extremely small. Therefore, 
economies of scale in this market are likely to be so large that a firm that en-
ters and attracts a small number of visitors to its site will have much higher 
average costs than OpenTable.
Step 3: Answer part b. by discussing whether how long OpenTable has been in 
business is relevant to assessing whether it is a natural monopoly. If a firm 
is a natural monopoly, it is unlikely that firms will be able to successfully en-
ter its market. But a firm that is the first to enter a new market may not ini-
tially attract competitors. It can take time for potential competitors to decide 
whether it would be profitable to enter an industry, particularly an industry 
that might require a substantial initial investment. The longer OpenTable con-
tinues to operate without significant competition, the more likely it is that the 
firm actually is a natural monopoly.
OpenTable began operating in San Francisco in 1999, and it had ex-
panded nationwide by 2003. One restaurant owner was quoted as saying, “All 
restaurants have to [participate with OpenTable], whether you like it or not. 
There’s no way around it. At this point, there’s no other technology or easy so-
lution for making Web reservations.” This statement indicates that restaurant 
owners see OpenTable as effectively having a monopoly.
Extra Credit: Keep in mind that competition is not good for its own sake. It is good 
because it can lead to lower costs, lower prices, and better products. In certain markets, 
however, cost conditions are such that competition is likely to lead to higher costs and 
higher prices. These markets are natural monopolies that are best served by one firm. 
Time will tell whether advances in technology or innovative marketing will make it pos-
sible for other firms to successfully compete with OpenTable.

C H A P T E R  1 5  Monopoly and Antitrust Policy
How Does a Monopoly Choose Price 
and Output?
Like every other firm, a monopoly maximizes profit by producing where marginal 
revenue equals marginal cost. A monopoly differs from other firms in that a monop-
oly’s demand curve is the same as the demand curve for the product. We emphasized in 
 Chapter 12 that the market demand curve for wheat was very different from the de-
mand curve for the wheat produced by any one farmer. If, however, one farmer had a 
monopoly on wheat production, the two demand curves would be exactly the same.
Marginal Revenue Once Again
Recall from Chapter 12 that firms in perfectly competitive markets—such as a farmer 
in the wheat market—face horizontal demand curves. They are price takers. All other 
firms, including monopolies, are price makers. If price makers raise their prices, they 
will lose some, but not all, of their customers. Therefore, they face a downward- sloping 
demand curve and a downward-sloping marginal revenue curve as well. Let’s review 
why a firm’s marginal revenue curve slopes downward if its demand curve slopes 
downward.
Remember that when a firm cuts the price of a product, one good thing happens, 
and one bad thing happens:
• 
The good thing. It sells more units of the product.
• 
The bad thing. It receives less revenue from each unit than it would have received at 
the higher price.
For example, consider the table in Figure 15.2, which shows the demand curve for 
Time Warner Cable’s basic cable package. For simplicity, we assume that the market 
has only 10 potential subscribers instead of the millions it actually has. If Time Warner 
charges a price of $60 per month, it won’t have any subscribers. If it charges a price of 
$57, it sells 1 subscription. At $54, it sells 2 subscriptions, and so on. Time Warner’s total 
revenue is equal to the number of subscriptions sold per month multiplied by the price. 
The firm’s average revenue—or revenue per subscription sold—is equal to its total reve-
nue divided by the quantity of subscriptions sold. Time Warner is particularly interested 
in marginal revenue because marginal revenue tells the firm how much its revenue will 
increase if it cuts the price to sell one more subscription.
Notice that Time Warner’s marginal revenue is less than the price for every sub-
scription sold after the first subscription. To see why, think about what happens if Time 
Warner cuts the price of its basic cable package from $42 to $39, which increases its 
subscriptions sold from 6 to 7. Time Warner increases its revenue by the $39 it receives 
for the seventh subscription. But it also loses revenue of $3 per subscription on the first 
6 subscriptions because it could have sold them at the old price of $42. So, its marginal 
revenue on the seventh subscription is +39 - +18 = +21, which is the value shown in 
the table. The graph in Figure 15.2 plots Time Warner’s demand and marginal revenue 
curves, based on the information in the table.
Profit Maximization for a Monopolist
Figure 15.3 shows how Time Warner combines the information on demand and marginal 
revenue with information on average and marginal costs to decide how many subscrip-

age total cost curves have the usual U shapes we encountered in Chapters 11 and 12. In 
panel (a), we see how Time Warner can calculate its profit-maximizing quantity and price. 
As long as the marginal cost of selling one more subscription is less than the marginal 
revenue, the firm should sell additional subscriptions because it is adding to its profits. 
As Time Warner sells more cable subscriptions, rising marginal cost will eventually equal

Figure 15.2 
Calculating a Monopoly’s 
Revenue
Time Warner Cable faces a downward-slop-
ing demand curve for subscriptions to basic 
cable. To sell more subscriptions, it must cut 
the price. When this happens, it gains rev-
enue from selling more subscriptions but 
loses revenue from selling at a lower price 
the subscriptions that it could have sold at a 
higher price. The firm’s marginal revenue is 
the change in revenue from selling another 
subscription. We can calculate marginal 
revenue by subtracting the revenue lost as a 
result of a price cut from the revenue gained. 
The table shows that Time Warner’s mar-
ginal revenue is less than the price for every 
subscription sold after the first subscription. 
Therefore, Time Warner’s marginal revenue 
curve will be below its demand curve.
marginal revenue, and the firm will be selling the profit-maximizing quantity of subscrip-
tions. This happens with the sixth subscription, which adds $27 to the firm’s costs and 
$27 to its revenues—point A in panel (a) of Figure 15.3. The demand curve tells us that 
Time Warner can sell 6 subscriptions for a price of $42 per month. We can conclude that 
Time Warner’s profit-maximizing quantity of subscriptions is 6, and its profit-maximizing  
price is $42.
Panel (b) shows that the average total cost of 6 subscriptions is $30 and that Time 
Warner can sell 6 subscriptions at a price of $42 per month (point B on the demand 
curve). Time Warner is making a profit of $12 per subscription—the price of $42 mi-
nus the average cost of $30. Its total profit is $72 (6 subscriptions 3 $12 profit per 
subscription), which is shown by the area of the green-shaded rectangle in the figure. 
We could also have calculated Time Warner’s total profit as the difference between its 
total revenue and its total cost. Its total revenue from selling 6 subscriptions is $252. 
Its total cost equals its average cost multiplied by the number of subscriptions sold, or 
+30 * 6 = +180. So, its profit is +252 - +180 = +72.
It’s important to note that even though Time Warner is earning economic profits, 
new firms will not enter the market. Because Time Warner has a monopoly, it will not 
face competition from other cable operators. Therefore, if other factors remain un-
changed, Time Warner will be able to continue to earn economic profits, even in the 
long run.

Panel (a) shows that to maximize profit, Time Warner should sell subscriptions up 
to the point where the marginal revenue from selling the last subscription equals 
its marginal cost (point A). In this case, the marginal revenue from selling the sixth 
subscription and the marginal cost are both $27. Time Warner maximizes profit by 
selling 6 subscriptions per month and charging a price of $42 (point B). In panel (b), 
the green box represents Time Warner’s profit. The box has a height equal to $12, 
which is the price of $42 minus the average total cost of $30, and a base equal 
to the quantity of 6 cable subscriptions. Time Warner’s profit therefore equals 
+12 * 6 = +72.

Solved Problem 15.3
Finding the Profit-Maximizing Price  
and Output for a Monopolist
Suppose that Comcast has a cable monopoly in Philadelphia. 
The following table gives Comcast’s demand and costs per 
month for subscriptions to basic cable (for simplicity, we 
once again keep the number of subscribers artificially small):
a. Fill in the missing values in the table.
b.  If Comcast wants to maximize profits, what price should 
it charge, and how many cable subscriptions per month 
should it sell? How much profit will Comcast make? 
Briefly explain.
c.  Suppose the local government imposes a $25-per-month 
tax on cable companies. Now what price should Comcast 
charge, how many subscriptions should it sell, and what 
will its profits be?

Solving the Problem
Step 1: Review the chapter material. This problem is about finding the profit- 
maximizing quantity and price for a monopolist, so you may want to review 
the section “Profit Maximization for a Monopolist,” which begins on page 496.
Step 2: Answer part a. by filling in the missing values in the table. Remember that 
to calculate marginal revenue and marginal cost, you must divide the change 
in total revenue or total cost by the change in quantity.
We don’t have enough information from the table to fill in the values for 
marginal revenue and marginal cost in the first row.

Step 3: Answer part b. by determining the profit-maximizing quantity and price. 
We know that Comcast will maximize profits by selling subscriptions up to 
the point where marginal cost equals marginal revenue. In this case, that 
means selling 6 subscriptions per month. From the information in the first 
two columns, we know Comcast can sell 6 subscriptions at a price of $24 each. 
Comcast’s profits are equal to the difference between its total revenue and its 
total cost: Profit 5 $144 2 $110 5 $34 per month.
Step 4: Answer part c. by analyzing the impact of the tax. This tax is a fixed cost 
to Comcast because it is a flat $25, no matter how many subscriptions it sells. 
Because the tax doesn’t affect Comcast’s marginal revenue or marginal cost, 
the profit-maximizing level of output has not changed. So, Comcast will still 
sell 6 subscriptions per month at a price of $24, but its profits will fall by the 
amount of the tax, from $34 per month to $9.

Don’t Assume That Charging a Higher 
Price Is Always More Profitable for a 
Monopolist
In answering part c. of Solved Problem 15.3, it’s tempting 
to argue that Comcast should increase its price to make up 
for the tax. After all, Comcast is a monopolist, so why can’t 
it just pass along the tax to its customers? The reason it can’t 
is that Comcast, like any other monopolist, must pay atten-
tion to demand. Comcast is not interested in charging high 
prices for the sake of charging high prices; it is interested in 
maximizing profits. Charging a price of $1,000 for a basic 
cable subscription sounds nice, but if no one will buy at that 
price, Comcast would hardly be maximizing profits.
To look at it another way, before the tax is imposed, 
Comcast has already determined that $24 is the price that 
will maximize its profits. After the tax is imposed, it must 
determine whether $24 is still the profit-maximizing price. 
Because the tax has not affected Comcast’s marginal revenue 
or marginal cost (or had any effect on consumer demand), 
$24 is still the profit-maximizing price, and Comcast should 
continue to charge it. The tax reduces Comcast’s profits but 
doesn’t cause it to increase the price of cable subscriptions.

C H A P T E R  1 5  Monopoly and Antitrust Policy
Does Monopoly Reduce Economic 
Efficiency?
We saw in Chapter 12 that a perfectly competitive market is economically efficient. How 
would economic efficiency be affected if instead of being perfectly competitive, a market 
were a monopoly? In Chapter 4, we developed the idea of economic surplus. Economic 
surplus provides a way of characterizing the economic efficiency of a perfectly competi-
tive market: Equilibrium in a perfectly competitive market results in the greatest amount of 
economic surplus, or total benefit to society, from the production of a good or service. What 
happens to economic surplus under a monopoly? We can begin the analysis by consider-
ing the hypothetical case of what would happen if the market for tablet computers begins 
as perfectly competitive and then becomes a monopoly. 
Comparing Monopoly and Perfect Competition
Panel (a) in Figure 15.4 illustrates the situation if the market for tablet computers is per-
fectly competitive. Price and quantity are determined by the intersection of the demand 
and supply curves. Remember that none of the individual firms in a perfectly competi-
tive industry has any control over price. Each firm must accept the price determined 
by the market. Panel (b) shows what happens if the tablet computer industry becomes 
a monopoly. We know that the monopoly will maximize profits by producing where 
marginal revenue equals marginal cost. To do this, the monopoly reduces the quantity 
of tablets that would have been produced if the industry were perfectly competitive and 
increases the price. Panel (b) illustrates an important conclusion: A monopoly will pro-
duce less and charge a higher price than would a perfectly competitive industry producing 
the same good.
Measuring the Efficiency Losses from Monopoly
Figure 15.5 uses panel (b) from Figure 15.4 to illustrate how monopoly affects consum-
ers, producers, and the efficiency of the economy. Recall from Chapter 4 that consumer

 Figure 15.4  What Happens If a Perfectly Competitive Industry Becomes a Monopoly?
In panel (a), the market for tablet computers is perfectly competitive, and price 
and quantity are determined by the intersection of the demand and supply 
curves. In panel (b), the perfectly competitive tablet computer industry becomes 
a monopoly. As a result:
1. The industry supply curve becomes the monopolist’s marginal cost curve.
2.  The monopolist reduces output to where marginal revenue equals marginal 
cost, QM.
3. The monopolist raises the price from PC to PM.

 
Does Monopoly Reduce Economic Efficiency? 
501
surplus measures the net benefit received by consumers from purchasing a good or ser-
vice. We measure consumer surplus as the area below the demand curve and above the 
market price. The higher the price, the smaller the consumer surplus. Because a mo-
nopoly raises the market price, it reduces consumer surplus. In Figure 15.5, the loss 
of consumer surplus is equal to rectangle A plus triangle B. Remember that producer 
surplus measures the net benefit to producers from selling a good or service. We mea-
sure producer surplus as the area above the supply curve and below the market price. 
The increase in price due to monopoly increases producer surplus by an amount equal 
to rectangle A and reduces it by an amount equal to triangle C. Because rectangle A is 
larger than triangle C, we know that a monopoly increases producer surplus compared 
with perfect competition.
Economic surplus is equal to the sum of consumer surplus plus producer surplus. 
By increasing price and reducing the quantity produced, the monopolist has reduced 
economic surplus by an amount equal to the areas of triangles B and C. This reduction 
in economic surplus is called deadweight loss and represents the loss of economic effi-
ciency due to monopoly.
The best way to understand how a monopoly causes a loss of economic efficiency 
is to recall that price is equal to marginal cost in a perfectly competitive market. As 
a result, a consumer in a perfectly competitive market is always able to buy a good if 
she is willing to pay a price equal to the marginal cost of producing it. As Figure 15.5 
shows, the monopolist stops producing at a point where the price is well above mar-
ginal cost. Consumers are unable to buy some units of the good for which they would 
be willing to pay a price greater than the marginal cost of producing them. Why doesn’t 
the monopolist produce this additional output? Because the monopolist’s profits are 
greater if it restricts output and forces up the price. A monopoly produces the profit-
maximizing level of output but fails to produce the efficient level of output from the 
point of view of society.
We can summarize the effects of monopoly as follows:
 1. Monopoly causes a reduction in consumer surplus.
 2. Monopoly causes an increase in producer surplus.
 3. Monopoly causes a deadweight loss, which represents a reduction in economic 
efficiency.

The Inefficiency of Monopoly
A monopoly charges a higher price, PM, 
and produces a smaller quantity, QM, than 
a perfectly competitive industry, which 
charges price PC and produces QC. The 
higher price reduces consumer surplus by 
the area equal to the rectangle A and the

sumer surplus is captured by the monopoly 
as producer surplus, and some becomes 
deadweight loss, which is the area equal to 
triangles B and C.

C H A P T E R  1 5  Monopoly and Antitrust Policy
How Large Are the Efficiency Losses Due 
to Monopoly?
We know that there are relatively few monopolies, so the loss of economic efficiency due to 
monopoly must be small. Many firms, though, have market power, which is the ability of 
a firm to charge a price greater than marginal cost. The analysis we just completed shows 
that some loss of economic efficiency will occur whenever a firm has market power and 
can charge a price greater than marginal cost, even if the firm is not a monopoly. The only 
firms that do not have market power are firms in perfectly competitive markets, which 
must charge a price equal to marginal cost. Because few markets are perfectly competitive, 
some loss of economic efficiency occurs in the market for nearly every good or service.
Is the total loss of economic efficiency due to market power large or small? It is 
possible to put a dollar value on the loss of economic efficiency by estimating for every 
industry the size of the deadweight loss triangle, as in Figure 15.5. The first economist 
to do this was Arnold Harberger of the University of Chicago. His estimates—largely 
confirmed by later researchers—indicated that the total loss of economic efficiency in 
the U.S. economy due to market power is small. According to his estimates, if every in-
dustry in the economy were perfectly competitive, so that price were equal to marginal 
cost in every market, the gain in economic efficiency would equal less than 1 percent of 
the value of total production in the United States, or about $480 per person.
The loss of economic efficiency is this small primarily because true monopolies are 
very rare. In most industries, competition keeps price much closer to marginal cost than 
would be the case in a monopoly. The closer price is to marginal cost, the smaller the 
size of the deadweight loss.
Market Power and Technological Change
Some economists have raised the possibility that the economy may actually benefit 
from firms having market power. This argument is most closely identified with Joseph 
Schumpeter, an Austrian economist who spent many years as a professor of econom-
ics at Harvard. Schumpeter argued that economic progress depends on technological 
change in the form of new products. For example, the replacement of horse-drawn car-
riages by automobiles, the replacement of ice boxes by refrigerators, and the replace-
ment of mechanical calculators by electronic computers all represent technological 
changes that significantly raised living standards. In Schumpeter’s view, new products 
unleash a “gale of creative destruction” that drives older products—and, often, the firms 
that produced them—out of the market. Schumpeter was not concerned that firms with 
market power would charge higher prices than perfectly competitive firms:
It is not that kind of [price] competition which counts but the competi-
tion from the new commodity, the new technology, the new source of 
supply, the new type of organization . . . competition which commands a 
decisive cost or quality advantage and which strikes not at the margins of  
the profits and outputs of the existing firms but at their foundations and 
their very lives.
Economists who support Schumpeter’s view argue that the introduction of new prod-
ucts requires firms to spend funds on research and development. It is possible for firms 
to raise this money by borrowing from investors or from banks. But investors and banks 
are usually skeptical of ideas for new products that have not yet passed the test of con-
sumer acceptance in the market. As a result, firms are often forced to rely on their profits 
to finance the research and development needed for new products. Because firms with 
market power are more likely to earn economic profits than are perfectly competitive 
firms, they are also more likely to carry out research and development and introduce new 
products. In this view, the higher prices firms with market power charge are unimportant 
compared with the benefits from the new products these firms introduce to the market.
Some economists disagree with Schumpeter’s views. These economists point to the 
number of new products developed by smaller firms, including, for example, Steve Jobs

charge a price greater than marginal 
cost.

and Sergey Brin inventing the Google search engine as graduate students at Stanford. 
As we will see in the next section, government policymakers continue to struggle with 
the issue of whether, on balance, large firms with market power are good or bad for the 
economy.
Government Policy toward Monopoly
Because monopolies reduce consumer surplus and economic efficiency, most govern-
ments have policies that regulate their behavior. Recall from Chapter 14 that collusion 
refers to an agreement among firms to charge the same price or otherwise not to com-
pete. In the United States, antitrust laws are designed to prevent monopolies and collu-
sion. Governments also regulate firms that are natural monopolies, often by controlling 
the prices they charge.
Antitrust Laws and Antitrust Enforcement
The first important law regulating monopolies in the United States was the Sherman 
Act, which Congress passed in 1890 to promote competition and prevent the formation 
of monopolies. Section 1 of the Sherman Act outlaws “every contract, combination in 
the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy in restraint of trade.” Section 2 states that 
“every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire 
with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce . . . 
shall be deemed guilty of a felony.”
The Sherman Act targeted firms in several industries that had combined together 
during the 1870s and 1880s to form “trusts.” In a trust, the firms were operated inde-
pendently but gave voting control to a board of trustees. The board enforced collusive 
agreements for the firms to charge the same price and not to compete for each other’s 
customers. The most notorious of the trusts was the Standard Oil Trust, organized by 
John D. Rockefeller. After the Sherman Act was passed, trusts disappeared, but the term 
antitrust laws has lived on to refer to the laws aimed at eliminating collusion and pro-
moting competition among firms.
The Sherman Act prohibited trusts and collusive agreements, but it left several 
loopholes. For example, it was not clear whether it would be legal for two or more firms 
to merge to form a new, larger firm that would have substantial market power. A series 
of Supreme Court decisions interpreted the Sherman Act narrowly, and the result was 
a wave of mergers at the turn of the twentieth century. Included in these mergers was 
U.S. Steel Corporation, which was formed from dozens of smaller companies. U.S. Steel, 
organized by J. P. Morgan, was the first billion-dollar corporation, and it controlled 
two-thirds of steel production in the United States. The Sherman Act also left unclear 
whether any business practices short of outright collusion were illegal.
To address the loopholes in the Sherman Act, in 1914, Congress passed the Clayton 
Act and the Federal Trade Commission Act. Under the Clayton Act, a merger was illegal 
if its effect was “substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly.” The 
Federal Trade Commission Act set up the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which was 
given the power to police unfair business practices. The FTC has brought lawsuits against 
firms employing a variety of business practices, including deceptive advertising. In setting 
up the FTC, Congress divided the authority to police mergers. Currently, both the Anti-
trust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice and the FTC are responsible for merger 
policy. Table 15.1 lists the most important U.S. antitrust laws and the purpose of each.
Mergers: The Trade-off between Market Power  
and Efficiency
The federal government regulates business mergers because it knows that if firms gain 
market power by merging, they may use that market power to raise prices and reduce 
output. As a result, the government is most concerned with horizontal mergers, or

504 
C H A P T E R  1 5  Monopoly and Antitrust Policy
mergers between firms in the same industry. Horizontal mergers are more likely to in-
crease market power than vertical mergers, which are mergers between firms at dif-
ferent stages of the production of a good. An example of a vertical merger would be 
a merger between a company making personal computers and a company making 
 computer hard drives.
Two factors can complicate regulating horizontal mergers. First, the “market” that 
firms are in is not always clear. For example, if Hershey Foods wants to merge with 
Mars, Inc., maker of M&Ms, Snickers, and other candies, what is the relevant market? 
If the government looks just at the candy market, the newly merged company would 
have more than 70 percent of the market, a level at which the government would likely 
oppose the merger. What if the government looks at the broader market for snacks? 
In this market, Hershey and Mars compete with makers of potato chips, pretzels, and 
 peanuts—and perhaps even producers of fresh fruit. Of course, if the government 
looked at the very broad market for food, then both Hershey and Mars have very small 
market shares, and there would be no reason to oppose their merger. In practice, the 
government defines the relevant market on the basis of whether there are close substi-
tutes for the products being made by the merging firms. In this case, potato chips and 
the other snack foods mentioned are not close substitutes for candy. So, the govern-
ment would consider the candy market to be the relevant market and would oppose the 
merger, on the grounds that the new firm would have too much market power.
The second factor that complicates merger policy is the possibility that the newly 
merged firm might be more efficient than the merging firms were individually. For ex-
ample, one firm might have an excellent product but a poor distribution system for get-
ting the product into the hands of consumers. A competing firm might have built a 
great distribution system but have an inferior product. Allowing these firms to merge 
might be good for both the firms and consumers. Or, two competing firms might each 
have an extensive system of warehouses that are only half full, but if the firms merged, 
they could consolidate their warehouses and significantly reduce their average costs.
Most of the mergers that come under scrutiny by the Department of Justice and the 
FTC are between large firms. For simplicity, though, let’s consider a case in which all 
the firms in a perfectly competitive industry want to merge to form a monopoly. As we 
saw in Figure 15.5, as a result of this merger, prices will rise and output will fall, leading 
to a decline in consumer surplus and economic efficiency. But what if the larger, newly 
merged firm actually is more efficient than the smaller firms were? Figure 15.6 shows a 
possible result.
If costs aren’t affected by the merger, we get the same result as in Figure 15.5: Price 
rises from PC to PM, quantity falls from QC to QM, consumer surplus is lower, and a 
loss of economic efficiency results. If the monopoly has lower costs than the competi-
tive firms, it is possible for price to decline and quantity to increase. In Figure 15.6, note 
where MR crosses MC after the merger—this is the new profit-maximizing quantity,

A Merger That Makes 
Consumers Better Off
This figure shows the result of all the firms 
in a perfectly competitive industry merging 
to form a monopoly. If costs are unaffected 
by the merger, the result is the same as in 
Figure 15.5 on page 501: Price rises from 
PC to PM, quantity falls from QC to QM, 
consumer surplus declines, and a loss of 
economic efficiency results. If, however, the 
monopoly has lower costs than the perfectly 
competitive firms, as shown by the marginal 
cost curve shifting to MC after the merger, 
it is possible that the price will actually de-
cline from PC to PMerge and that output will 
increase from QC to QMerge following the 
merger.
QMerge. The demand curve shows that the monopolist can sell this quantity at a price 
of PMerge. Therefore, the price declines after the merger from PC to PMerge, and quan-
tity increases from QC to QMerge. We have the following seemingly paradoxical result: 
Although the newly merged firm has a great deal of market power, because it is more effi-
cient, consumers are better off and economic efficiency is improved. Of course, sometimes 
a merged firm will be more efficient and have lower costs, and other times it won’t. Even 
if a merged firm is more efficient and has lower costs, that may not offset the increased 
market power of the firm enough to increase consumer surplus and economic efficiency.
As you might expect, whenever large firms propose a merger, they claim that the 
newly merged firm will be more efficient and have lower costs. They realize that without 
these claims, the Department of Justice and the FTC, along with the court system, are 
unlikely to approve the merger.
The Department of Justice and FTC Merger 
Guidelines
For many years after the passage of the Sherman Act in 1890, lawyers from the Depart-
ment of Justice enforced the antitrust laws. The lawyers rarely considered economic ar-
guments, such as the possibility that consumers might be made better off by a merger if 
economic efficiency were significantly improved. This began to change in 1965, when 
Donald Turner became the first Ph.D. economist to head the Antitrust Division of the 
Department of Justice. Under Turner and his successors, economic analysis shaped anti-
trust policy. In 1973, the Economics Section of the Antitrust Division was established and 
staffed with economists who evaluate the economic consequences of proposed mergers.
Economists played a major role in the development of merger guidelines by the 
Department of Justice and the FTC in 1982. The guidelines made it easier for firms con-
sidering a merger to understand whether the government was likely to allow the merger 
or to oppose it. The guidelines were modified in 2010 and have three main parts: 
 1. Market definition 
 2. Measure of concentration 
 3. Merger standards

C H A P T E R  1 5  Monopoly and Antitrust Policy
Market Definition A market consists of all firms making products that consumers 
view as close substitutes. We can identify close substitutes by looking at the effect of a 
price increase. If our definition of a market is too narrow, a price increase will cause 
firms to experience a significant decline in sales—and profits—as consumers switch to 
buying close substitutes.
Identifying the relevant market involved in a proposed merger begins with a narrow 
definition of the industry. For the hypothetical merger of Hershey Foods and Mars, Inc., 
discussed previously in this chapter, we might start with the candy industry. If all firms in 
the candy industry increased price by 5 percent, would their profits increase or decrease? 
If profits would increase, the market is defined as being just these firms. If profits would 
decrease, we would try a broader definition—say, by adding in potato chips and other 
snacks. Would a price increase of 5 percent by all firms in the broader market raise prof-
its? If profits increase, the relevant market has been identified. If profits decrease, we con-
sider a broader definition. We continue this process until a market has been identified.
Measure of Concentration A market is concentrated if a relatively small number of 
firms have a large share of total sales in the market. A merger between firms in a market 
that is already highly concentrated is very likely to increase market power. A merger be-
tween firms in an industry that has a very low concentration is unlikely to increase mar-
ket power and can be ignored. The guidelines use the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) 
of concentration, which squares the market shares of each firm in the industry and adds 
up the values of the squares. The following are some examples of calculating HHI:
• 
1 firm, with 100 percent market share (a monopoly):
HHI = 1002 = 10,000
• 
2 firms, each with a 50 percent market share:
HHI = 502 + 502 = 5,000
• 
4 firms, with market shares of 30 percent, 30 percent, 20 percent, and 20 percent:
HHI = 302 + 302 + 202 + 202 = 2,600
• 
10 firms, each with market shares of 10 percent:
HHI = 10 * (102) = 1,000
Merger Standards The Department of Justice and the FTC use the HHI calculation 
for a market to evaluate proposed horizontal mergers according to these standards:
• 
Postmerger HHI below 1,500. These markets are not concentrated, so mergers in 
them are not challenged.
• 
Postmerger HHI between 1,500 and 2,500. These markets are moderately concen-
trated. Mergers that raise the HHI by less than 100 probably will not be challenged. 
Mergers that raise the HHI by more than 100 may be challenged.
• 
Postmerger HHI above 2,500. These markets are highly concentrated. Mergers that 
increase the HHI by less than 100 points will not be challenged. Mergers that in-
crease the HHI by 100 to 200 points may be challenged. Mergers that increase the 
HHI by more than 200 points will likely be challenged.
Increases in economic efficiency will be taken into account and can lead to approval 
of a merger that otherwise would be opposed, but the burden of showing that the effi-
ciencies exist lies with the merging firms:
The merging firms must substantiate efficiency claims so that the 
 [Department of Justice and the FTC] can verify by reasonable means 
the likelihood and magnitude of each asserted efficiency. . . . Efficiency 
claims will not be considered if they are vague or speculative or other-
wise cannot be verified by reasonable means.

 
Government Policy toward Monopoly

Should AT&T Have Been Allowed 
to Merge with T-Mobile?
In early 2011, AT&T agreed to buy  
T-Mobile from its parent firm Deutsche 
Telekom for $39 billion. AT&T is the sec-
ond largest mobile wireless firm in the United States, and T-Mobile is 
the fourth largest. (In 2011, Verizon Wireless was the largest wireless 
firm, and Sprint Nextel was the third largest.) As we have seen, the 
two main ways that a merger between two large firms can increase 
the combined firm’s profits are by (1) increasing market power so 
as to increase prices and (2) lowering costs through increased effi-
ciency. The federal government may see the first motive as violating 
the antitrust laws, so firms typically emphasize the second motive. 
AT&T argued that the combined company, which would become 
the largest wireless firm in the United States, could operate at lower 
cost than could the companies operating separately. For instance, 
the two companies had 9,200 retail stores, but 41 percent of AT&T’s stores had one or more 
T-Mobile stores within 1 mile. Closing hundreds of these stores would lower the combined 
company’s costs. The combined company would also be able to reduce its technical and 
customer support staffs, among other savings. AT&T estimated the cost savings from the 
merger at $3 billion per year. In principle, these costs savings could lead to a situation like 
the one illustrated in Figure 15.6, where consumers benefit from a merger.
AT&T needed to emphasize cost savings and efficiency gains because it was pro-
posing a horizontal merger that would sharply increase concentration in the wireless 
industry. In fact, after studying the proposed merger for several months, the Antitrust 
Division of the Department of Justice filed a lawsuit to stop the merger. The govern-
ment argued that the relevant market for judging the merger was the market for wire-
less services, because they argued that traditional landline telephones “are not regarded 
by consumers of mobile wireless telecommunications as reasonable substitutes.” As a 
result, the government estimated that an increase in price by all mobile wireless com-
panies would increase the companies’ profits. In the national market, the merger would 
increase the HHI by nearly 700 points, from about 2,400 to about 3,100. Looking at just 
the market for wireless services purchased by businesses and the government, the HHI 
would increase from about 3,100 to about 3,400. In all of the 40 largest cities, the in-
crease in HHI from the merger would be more than 200 points. These increases in HHI 
called the merger into question under the merger guidelines discussed earlier.
Despite these increases in HHI, the government might not have opposed the merger if it 
had accepted AT&T’s argument that the merger would result in efficiencies that would lead 
to cost reductions. The government’s merger guidelines state that the government will con-
sider whether “efficiencies likely would be sufficient to reverse the merger’s potential to harm 
customers in the relevant market . . . by preventing price increases in that market.” How-
ever, the Antitrust Division’s economists rejected AT&T’s arguments that cost savings would 
offset the increased market power the newly merged firm would acquire. The government 
concluded, “Unless this acquisition is enjoined, customers of mobile wireless telecommuni-
cations services likely will face higher prices, less product variety and innovation, and poorer 
quality services due to reduced incentives to invest than would exist absent the merger.”
The attempt by AT&T to merge with T-Mobile was shaping up as a classic antitrust 
case, with the firms involved arguing that the merger would increase economic effi-
ciency and the government arguing that the reduction in price competition would more 
than offset the increase in efficiency.
Based on Thomas Catan and Spencer E. Ante, “U.S. Sues to Stop AT&T Deal,” Wall Street Journal, September 1, 2011; An-
ton Troianovski, “T-Mobile Dealers Start to Hang Up,” Wall Street Journal, June 23, 2011; Andrew Ross Sorkin, Michael J.

C H A P T E R  1 5  Monopoly and Antitrust Policy
Regulating Natural Monopolies
If a firm is a natural monopoly, competition from other firms will not play its usual role 
of forcing price down to the level where the company earns zero economic profit. As a 
result, local or state regulatory commissions usually set the prices for natural monopo-
lies, such as firms selling natural gas or electricity. What price should these commissions 
set? Recall from Chapter 11 that economic efficiency requires the last unit of a good or 
service produced to provide an additional benefit to consumers equal to the additional 
cost of producing it. We can measure the additional benefit consumers receive from the 
last unit by the price, and we can measure the additional cost to the monopoly of pro-
ducing the last unit by marginal cost. Therefore, to achieve economic efficiency, regula-
tors should require that the monopoly charge a price equal to its marginal cost. There is, 
however, an important drawback to doing so, as illustrated in Figure 15.7, which shows 
the situation of a typical regulated natural monopoly.
Remember that with a natural monopoly, the average total cost curve is still fall-
ing when it crosses the demand curve. If unregulated, the monopoly will charge a price 
equal to PM and produce QM. To achieve economic efficiency, regulators should require 
the monopoly to charge a price equal to PE. The monopoly will then produce QE. But 
here is the drawback: PE is less than average total cost, so the monopoly will be suffer-
ing a loss, shown by the area of the red-shaded rectangle. In the long run, the owners 
of the monopoly will not continue in business if they are experiencing losses. Realizing 
this, most regulators will set the regulated price, PR, equal to the level of average total 
cost at which the demand curve intersects the ATC curve. At that price, the owners of 
the monopoly are able to break even on their investment by producing the quantity QR, 
although this quantity is below the efficient quantity, QE.
Figure 15.7
Regulating a Natural Monopoly
A natural monopoly that is not subject to 
government regulation will charge a price 
equal to PM and produce QM. If govern-
ment regulators want to achieve economic 
efficiency, they will set the regulated price 
equal to PE, and the monopoly will produce 
QE. Unfortunately, PE is below average cost, 
and the monopoly will suffer a loss, shown 
by the shaded rectangle. Because the mo-
nopoly will not continue to produce in the 
long run if it suffers a loss, government 
regulators set a price equal to average cost, 
which is PR in the figure. The resulting pro-
duction, QR, will be below the efficient level.

Why Can’t I Watch the NFL Network?
At the beginning of the chapter, we asked why some cable systems don’t carry the NFL Network. You 
might think that the cable systems would want to televise one of the most popular sports in the na-
tion. In most cities, a customer of a cable system can’t switch to a competing cable system, so in many 
areas, the cable system may be the sole source of many programs. (Although some consumers have 
the option of switching to satellite television.) As a result, a cable system can increase its profits by, for 
example, not offering popular programming such as the NFL Network as part of its normal program-
ming package, requiring instead that consumers upgrade to digital programming at a higher price.

 
Conclusion 
509
Conclusion
The more intense the level of competition among firms, the better a market works. In 
this chapter, we have seen that, compared with perfect competition, in a monopoly, the 
price of a good or a service is higher, output is lower, and consumer surplus and eco-
nomic efficiency are reduced. Fortunately, true monopolies are rare. Even though most 
firms resemble monopolies in being able to charge a price above marginal cost, most 
markets have enough competition to keep the efficiency losses from market power low.
We’ve seen that barriers to entry are an important source of market power. Read An 
Inside Look at Policy on the next page for a discussion of the entry of Verizon into the 
market for cable TV in upstate New York to compete with Time Warner Cable.

prevented the necessary legal notice 
from being published on time.
Verizon sp okesman John 
Bonomo said that discussions with 
the town of Colonie have progressed 
to the point that the town board is  
expected to discuss FiOS next month.
Bonomo has said that places like 
Bethlehem and Scotia that have al-
ready gotten PSC approval should 
see FiOS TV rolled out by the end of 
March. It’s likely, though, that places 
like Guilderland and Schenectady 
won’t get TV service until later in the 
spring, after the PSC approves their 
franchises as well.
 Verizon hasn’t said how much 
FiOS TV will cost or how much its 
bundles of TV, Internet and phone 
will cost. However, Verizon is adver-
tising its three-product bundle for un-
der $85 a month on its website, which 
is less than Time Warner’s current deal 
of $99 a month for new customers.

Cable Fight  
Heats Up
Verizon is quickly making Sche-
nectady County ground zero for the 
rollout of its FiOS TV service that 
competes with Time Warner Cable.
The village of Scotia was the first 
local municipality to strike a cable TV 
franchise deal with the New York City 
telecommunications giant.
And now Schenectady is poised 
to be the first major city in the region 
where FiOS TV will be available.
The Schenectady City Council 
will hold a public hearing on the plan 
Monday and could approve a fran-
chise during its meeting that night. 
After approval of the franchise by the 
state Public Service Commission, Ve-
rizon would be able to start selling ca-
ble TV in the city, along with its FiOS 
Internet and phone products, which 
are currently available only in certain 
parts of the Capital Region.

Schenectady County. “The fact that

is very good for us as a community. It 
offers another option.”
Time Warner has had a virtual 
monopoly on cable TV service and 
in most cases is the only company 
holding cable TV franchises in local 
municipalities.
 But several years ago Verizon 
began building its FiOS network to 
compete with local cable companies 
in the Northeast. It has slowly been 
negotiating franchises across the state, 
a process that is painstaking and also 
expensive because the agreements 
usually require Verizon to build out 
its system to the majority of citizens in 
a town or city within several years.
Verizon has also targeted Albany 
County—although not Albany city—
and has gotten franchise agreements 
from the town of Bethlehem and the 
village of Colonie.
The towns of Guilderland 
and Colonie are next in line. The 
 Guilderland town board will hold a 
public hearing Tuesday for the Veri-
zon plan.

increases from areas A + E  to areas 
A + E + B + C + D, and the deadweight 
loss in the market (area D) is turned into  
consumer surplus. What were profits for the 
monopoly (areas B + C) are redistributed 
to consumers as consumer surplus. Eco-
nomic profits fall to zero, and consumers 
benefit by paying a lower price. Unlike the 
example in the figure, the actual market for 
cable TV service in upstate New York does 
not become perfectly competitive with the 
entry of Verizon. However, consumers still 
benefit by receiving increased consumer 
surplus with the new, lower price option of-
fered by Verizon and the probable matching 
of this lower price by Time Warner.
Thinking Critically 
about Policy
1. Some cities require cable firms to pay a 
franchise fee in order to provide cable 
television services. What is the most a 
firm would be willing to pay as a fran-
chise fee to be the sole provider of ca-
ble television in a market?
2. Would entry into the cable TV market in 
upstate New York ever be great enough 
to change the market to a perfectly com-
petitive one (as we assume happens in 
the figure), with the price falling to PC?
b The process of entering a cable market 
is time-consuming and expensive. In 
addition to receiving franchise approval 
from individual communities and the PSC, 
the franchise agreements generally require 
Verizon to install fiber-optic connections to 
a majority of residents within each commu-
nity it intends to serve. The necessary time 
and expense for a company to establish 
such services are significant barriers to en-
try and help explain why very few compa-
nies compete in the market for cable TV 
service.
c Verizon’s Web site lists a monthly price 
for its three-product bundle of TV, Inter-
net, and phone of $85, which is $14 less 
than Time Warner’s new customer package 
of $99. As we learned in the chapter, barri-
ers to entry enable a monopoly firm to re-
tain the profits it earns, but when a 
competitor is able to enter the market, we 
would expect the profits of the original mo-
nopoly firm to decrease. The figure below 
illustrates what happens if entry results in 
the market becoming perfectly competitive. 
For simplicity, we assume that the marginal 
cost of providing cable services is constant, 
so the marginal cost curve is a horizontal 
line. Notice that with entry, output increases 
from QM to QC, and price falls from PM to 
PC. You can also see that consumer surplus

Until 2011, Time Warner Cable had a 
 virtual monopoly on cable TV services in 
upstate New York, and was the only com-
pany to hold cable TV franchises in most  
local communities in the region. Verizon has 
been constructing its FiOS fiber-optic net-
work in the Northeast over the past several 
years while also negotiating franchise deals 
with local municipalities throughout New 
York State. Although the company is not 
yet publicly stating pricing for its services,  
Verizon’s Web site lists a bundle price for 
TV, Internet, and home phone below what 
Time Warner charges.
Analyzing the News
a The first major city in upstate New York 
scheduled to receive access to the Veri-
zon TV service is Schenectady. This came 
as welcome news to Chuck Steiner, presi-
dent of The Chamber of Schenectady 
County. Steiner acknowledged the benefit 
to the community of having an additional 
option beyond Time Warner for cable TV 
service. With approval of additional com-
munity franchises by the state Public Ser-
vices Commission (PSC), Verizon expected 
to continue its expansion in the region 
throughout 2011.

Summary
A monopoly exists only in the rare situation in which a firm is 
producing a good or service for which there are no close substi-
tutes. A narrow definition of monopoly that some economists 
use is that a firm has a monopoly if it can ignore the actions of 
all other firms. Many economists favor a broader definition of 
 monopoly. Under the broader definition, a firm has a monopoly if 
no other firms are selling a substitute close enough that the firm’s 
economic profits are competed away in the long run.

Chapter Summary and Problems
Summary
To have a monopoly, barriers to entering the market must be so 
high that no other firms can enter. Barriers to entry may be high 
enough to keep out competing firms for four main reasons: (1) A 
government blocks the entry of more than one firm into a market 
by issuing a patent, which is the exclusive right to make a product 
for 20 years, or a copyright, which is the exclusive right to produce 
and sell a creation, or giving a firm a public franchise, which is 
the right to be the only legal provider of a good or service; (2) one 
firm has control of a key raw material necessary to produce a good;  
(3) there are important network externalities in supplying the good 
or service; or (4) economies of scale are so large that one firm has 
a natural monopoly. Network externalities refer to the situation 
where the usefulness of a product increases with the number of

Summary
Monopolists face downward-sloping demand and marginal rev-
enue curves and, like all other firms, maximize profit by produc-
ing where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. Unlike a perfect 
competitor, a monopolist that earns economic profits does not 
face the entry of new firms into the market. Therefore, a monopo-
list can earn economic profits even in the long run.

a. Fill in the remaining values in the table.
 
b. If Scahill wants to maximize profits, what price should 
he charge, and how many baseballs should he sell? How 
much profit (or loss) will he make? Draw a graph to il-
lustrate your answer. Your graph should be clearly la-
beled and should include: Scahill’s demand, ATC, AVC, 
AFC, MC, and MR curves, the price he is charging, the 
quantity he is producing, and the area representing his 
profit (or loss).
 
c. Suppose the government imposes a tax of $50,000 per 
week on baseball production. Now what price should 
Scahill charge, how many baseballs should he sell, and 
what will his profit (or loss) be?
 
d. Suppose that the government raises the tax in part c. 
to $70,000. Now what price should Scahill charge, how 
many baseballs should he sell, and what will his profit 
(or loss) be? Will his decision on what price to charge 
and how much to produce be different in the short run 
than in the long run? Briefly explain.

stead of $2.50? (Hint: Will its decision be different in 
the long run than in the short run?)
 
b. Suppose that the flat per-month tax is replaced with a 
tax on the firm of $0.50 per cable subscriber. Now how 
many subscriptions should Comcast sell if it wants to 
maximize profit? What price should it charge? What 
is its profit? (Assume that Comcast will sell only the 
quantities listed in the table.)
 
3.6 Before inexpensive pocket calculators were developed, 
many science and engineering students used slide rules 
to make numerical calculations. Slide rules are no longer 
produced, which means nothing prevents you from estab-
lishing a monopoly in the slide rule market. Draw a graph 
showing the situation your slide rule firm would be in. Be 
sure to include on your graph your demand, marginal rev-
enue, average total cost, and marginal cost curves. Indicate 
the price you would charge and the quantity you would 
produce. Are you likely to make a profit or a loss? Show 
this area on your graph.
 
3.7 Does a monopolist have a supply curve? Briefly explain. 
(Hint: Look again at the definition of a supply curve in 
Chapter 3 on page 78 and consider whether this applies to 
a monopolist.)
 
3.8 [Related to the Don’t Let This Happen to You on page 499] 
A student argues, “If a monopolist finds a way of producing 
a good at lower cost, he will not lower his price. Because 
he is a monopolist, he will keep the price and the quantity 
the same and just increase his profit.” Do you agree? Use a 
graph to illustrate your answer.
 
3.9 When home builders construct a new housing develop-
ment, they usually sell to a single cable television company 
the rights to lay cable. As a result, anyone buying a home 
in that development is not able to choose between compet-
ing cable companies. Some cities have begun to ban such 
exclusive agreements. Williams Township, Pennsylvania, 
decided to allow any cable company to lay cable in the util-
ity trenches of new housing developments. The head of the 
township board of supervisors argued, “What I would like 
to see and do is give the consumers a choice. If there’s no 
choice, then the price [of cable] is at the whim of the pro-
vider.” In a situation in which the consumers in a housing 
development have only one cable company available, is the 
price really at the whim of the company? Would a company 
in this situation be likely to charge, say, $500 per month for 
basic cable services? Briefly explain why or why not.

Does Monopoly Reduce Economic Efficiency? pages 500–503
 15.4 
LEARNING OBJECTIVE: Use a graph to illustrate how a monopoly affects economic efficiency.
Summary
Compared with a perfectly competitive industry, a monopoly 
charges a higher price and produces less, which reduces consumer 
surplus and economic efficiency. Some loss of economic efficiency 
will occur whenever firms have market power and can charge a 
price greater than marginal cost. The total loss of economic effi-
ciency in the U.S. economy due to market power is small, however, 
because true monopolies are very rare. In most industries, compe-
tition will keep price much closer to marginal cost than would be 
the case in a monopoly.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE: Discuss government policies toward monopoly.
Summary
Because monopolies reduce consumer surplus and economic ef-
ficiency, most governments regulate monopolies. Firms that are 
not monopolies have an incentive to avoid competition by col-
luding, or agreeing to charge the same price or otherwise not to 
compete. In the United States, antitrust laws are aimed at deter-
ring monopoly, eliminating collusion, and promoting competition 
among firms. The Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of 
Justice and the Federal Trade Commission share responsibility for 
enforcing the antitrust laws, including regulating mergers between 
firms. A horizontal merger is a merger between firms in the same 
industry. A vertical merger is a merger between firms at differ-
ent stages of production of a good. Local governments regulate the 
prices charged by natural monopolies.

Review Questions
 
5.1 What is the purpose of the antitrust laws? Who is in charge 
of enforcing these laws?
 
5.2 What is the difference between a horizontal merger and a 
vertical merger? Which type of merger is more likely to in-
crease the market power of a newly merged firm?
 
5.3 Why would it be economically efficient to require a natural 
monopoly to charge a price equal to marginal cost? Why 
do most regulatory agencies require natural monopolies to 
charge a price equal to average cost instead?
Problems and Applications
 
5.4 Use the following graph for a monopoly to answer the 
questions:
 
a. What quantity will the monopoly produce, and what 
price will the monopoly charge?
 
b. Suppose the monopoly is regulated. If the regulatory 
agency wants to achieve economic efficiency, what 
price should it require the monopoly to charge? How 
much output will the monopoly produce at this price? 
Will the monopoly make a profit if it charges this price? 
Briefly explain.

Review Questions
 
4.1 Suppose that a perfectly competitive industry becomes a 
monopoly. Describe the effects of this change on consumer 
surplus, producer surplus, and deadweight loss.
 
4.2 Explain why market power leads to a deadweight loss. Is 
the total deadweight loss from market power for the econ-
omy large or small?
Problems and Applications
 
4.3 Review Figure 15.5 on page 501 on the inefficiency of 
monopoly. Will the deadweight loss due to monopoly be 
larger if the demand is elastic or if it is inelastic? Briefly 
explain.
 
4.4 Economist Harvey Leibenstein argued that the loss of 
economic efficiency in industries that are not perfectly 
competitive has been understated. He argued that when 
competition is weak, firms are under less pressure to adopt 
the best techniques or to hold down their costs. He referred 
to this effect as “x-inefficiency.” If x-inefficiency causes a 
firm’s marginal costs to rise, show that the deadweight loss 
in Figure 15.5 understates the true deadweight loss caused 
by a monopoly.
 
4.5 Most cities own the water system that provides water to 
homes and businesses. Some cities charge a flat monthly 
fee, while other cities charge by the gallon. Which method 
of pricing is more likely to result in economic efficiency 
in the water market? Be sure to refer to the definition of 
economic efficiency in your answer. Why do you think the 
same method of pricing isn’t used by all cities?
 
4.6 Review the concept of externalities on page 138 in Chap-
ter 5. If a market is a monopoly, will a negative externality 
in production always lead to production beyond the level of 
economic efficiency? Use a graph to illustrate your answer.

words, the monopoly can charge less than $18 but can’t 
charge more). Now what quantity will the monopoly 
produce, and what price will the monopoly charge? 
Will every consumer who is willing to pay this price be 
able to buy the product? Briefly explain.
 
5.6 Consider the natural monopoly shown in Figure 15.7 on 
page 508. Assume that the government regulatory agency 
sets the regulated price, PR, at the level of average total cost 
at which the demand curve intersects the ATC curve. If 
the firm knows that it will always be able to charge a price 
equal to its average total cost, does it have an incentive to 
reduce its average cost? Briefly explain.
 
5.7 Draw a graph like Figure 15.6 on page 505 that shows a 
merger lowering costs. On your graph, show producer sur-
plus and consumer surplus before a merger and consumer 
surplus and producer surplus after a merger.
 
5.8 The following phone call took place in February 1982 
between Robert Crandall, the chief executive officer of 
American Airlines, and Howard Putnam, the chief execu-
tive officer of Braniff Airways. Although Crandall didn’t 
know it, Putnam was recording the call:
Crandall: I think it’s dumb . . . to sit here and 
pound the (obscenity) out of each other and 
neither one of us making a (obscenity) dime . . .
Putnam: Do you have a suggestion for me?
Crandall: Yes, I have a suggestion for you. 
Raise your . . . fares 20 percent. I’ll raise mine 
the next morning.
Putnam: Robert, we . . .
Crandall: You’ll make more money and I will, too.
Putnam: We can’t talk about pricing.
Crandall: Oh (obscenity), Howard. We can 
talk about any . . . thing we want to talk about.
 
 Who had a better understanding of antitrust law, Crandall 
or Putnam? Briefly explain.

ing a Monopoly,” Washington Post, February 24, 1983; “Blunt Talk

5.9 Before they merged in 2008, Sirius Satellite Radio and XM 
Satellite Radio were the only two satellite radio firms. In 
announcing that it would not oppose the merger, the Jus-
tice Department said that “evidence developed in the in-
vestigation did not support defining a market limited to 
the two satellite radio firms.” It believed that the two firms 
also competed with “other sources of audio entertainment, 
including traditional AM/FM radio, HD Radio, MP3 play-
ers (e.g., iPods), and audio offerings delivered through 
wireless telephones.” Why would defining the size of the 
market in which the two firms competed be important to 
the Justice Department in deciding whether to oppose the 
merger?

 Justice’s Antitrust Division on Its Decision to Close Its Investigation of 
XM Satellite Radio Holdings Inc.’s Merger with Sirius Satellite Radio 
Inc.,” March 24, 2008.

FTC Merger Guidelines,” which begins on page 505. Evalu-
ate the following situations.
 
a. A market initially has 20 firms, each with a 5 percent 
market share. Of the firms, 4 propose to merge, leaving 
a total of 17 firms in the industry. Are the Department 
of Justice and the FTC likely to oppose the merger? 
Briefly explain.
 
b. A market initially has 5 firms, each with a 20 percent 
market share. Of the firms, 2 propose to merge, leaving 
a total of 4 firms in the industry. Are the Department 
of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission likely to 
oppose the merger? Briefly explain.
 5.11 In October 2008, Delta Air Lines completed its acquisi-
tion of Northwest Airlines. The newly merged company 
is the largest airline in the world. The following statement 
regarding the merger is from a Justice Department press 
release:
After a thorough, six-month investigation, 
during which the [Antitrust] Division obtained 
extensive information from a wide range of 
market participants—including the compa-
nies, other airlines, corporate customers and 
travel agents—the Division has determined 
that the proposed merger between Delta and 
Northwest is likely to produce substantial and 
credible efficiencies that will benefit U.S. con-
sumers and is not likely to substantially lessen 
competition.
 
 What does the Justice Department mean by “substantial 
and credible efficiencies,” and how might they benefit U.S. 
consumers? Why would a merger between two large air-
lines not be “likely to substantially lessen competition”?

Merger,” New York Times, October 30, 2008; and Department of Jus-
tice, “Statement of the Department of Justice’s Antitrust Division on

their proposed merger. The Department of Justice con-
cluded, however, that AT&T did not demonstrate that the 
deal “promised any efficiencies that would be sufficient to 
outweigh the transaction’s substantial adverse impact on 
competition and consumers.” What types of efficiencies 
could the proposed merger produce? What adverse ef-
fect could the proposed merger have on competition and

Economics in Your Life
Why So Many Prices to See a Movie?
Think about the movie theaters in your area. How much do you, as a student, pay to get into a 
theater? Would your parents pay the same amount? What about your grandparents? How about 
your little brother or sister? Is the price the same in the evening as in the afternoon? Why do you 
suppose movie theaters charge different prices to different groups of consumers?
If you buy popcorn at the movie theater, you pay the same price as everyone else. Why do you 
suppose people in certain age groups get a discount on movie admission but not on movie pop-
corn? As you read the chapter, see if you can answer these questions. You can check your answers 
against those we provide on page 536 at the end of this chapter.
feasibility of such a park. Managers of exist-
ing parks gave this advice to the economist: 
“Tell your boss . . . to stick to what he knows 
and leave the amusement business to people 
who know it.” Eventually, Disney convinced 
the ABC television network to provide 
funding in exchange for his providing them 
with a weekly television program.
When Disneyland opened in 1955, Dis-
ney decided to charge a low price—$1 for 
adults and $0.50 for children—for admission 
into the park and also to charge for tickets to 
the rides. This system of separate charges for 
admission and for the rides continued until 
the early 1980s. Today, Disney charges a high 
price for admission to Disneyland and Walt 
Disney World, but once a customer is in the 
park, the rides are free. In this chapter, we 
will study some common pricing strategies, 
and we will see how Disney and other firms 
use these strategies to increase their profits.
AN INSIDE LOOK on page 538 discusses 
a two-part pricing strategy the University of 
Kansas has implemented for purchasing select 
season tickets to Jayhawks’ football games.
Based on Disney World prices from mousesavers.com, 
September 1, 2011; Harrison Price, Walt’s Revolution! By 
the Numbers, (Ripley Entertainment, Inc., 2004), p. 31; and 
Bruce Gordon and David Mumford, Disneyland: The Nickel 
Tour, (Santa Clarita, CA: Camphor Tree Publishers, 2000), 
pp. 174–175.
When you visit Walt Disney World in 
Florida, your age, home address, and oc-
cupation can determine how much you 
pay for admission. In 2011, the price for a 
one-day ticket for an adult was $90.53. The 
same ticket for a child, aged three to nine, 
was $84.14. Children under three were free. 
Adult Florida residents paid $81.47. Stu-
dents at the University of Central Florida 
paid $57. Active members of the military 
paid $85. Why does Disney charge so many 
different prices for the same product?
In previous chapters, we assumed that 
firms charge all consumers the same price 
for a given product. In reality, many firms 
charge customers different prices, based on 
differences in their willingness to pay for the 
 product. Firms often face complicated pric-
ing problems. For example, the Walt Disney 
 Company faces the problem of determining 
the profit-maximizing prices to charge different 
groups of consumers for admission to its Dis-
neyland and Walt Disney World theme parks.
In the early 1950s, most amusement 
parks were collections of unrelated rides, 
such as roller coasters and Ferris wheels. 
Founder Walt Disney believed that a theme 
park, with attractions that emphasized sto-
rytelling over thrills, would be more appeal-
ing to families than were amusement parks. 
Disney hired an economist to evaluate the

C H A P T E R  1 6  Pricing Strategy
I
n previous chapters, we saw that entrepreneurs continually seek out economic profit. 
Using pricing strategies is one way firms can attempt to increase their economic 
profit. One of these strategies, called price discrimination, involves firms setting differ-
ent prices for the same good or service, as Disney does when setting admission prices 
at Walt Disney World. In Chapter 15, we analyzed the situation of a monopolist setting a 
single price for its product. In this chapter, we will see how a firm can increase its profits 
by charging a higher price to consumers who value the good more and a lower price to 
 consumers who value the good less.
We will also analyze the widely used strategies of odd pricing and cost-plus pricing. 
 Finally, we will analyze situations in which firms are able to charge consumers one price for 
the right to buy a good and a second price for each unit of the good purchased. Disney’s old 
pricing scheme of charging for admission to Disney World and also charging for each ride is 
an example of a situation economists call a two-part tariff.
Pricing Strategy, the Law of One Price,  
and Arbitrage
We saw in the chapter opener that sometimes firms can increase their profits by charg-
ing different prices for the same good. In fact, many firms rely on economic analysis to 
practice price discrimination by charging higher prices to some customers and lower 
prices to others. Some firms practice a sophisticated form of price discrimination in 
which they use technology to gather information on the preferences of consumers and 
their responsiveness to changes in prices. Managers use the information to rapidly ad-
just the prices of their goods and services. This practice of rapidly adjusting prices, 
called yield management, has been particularly important to airlines and hotels. There 
are limits, though, to the ability of firms to charge different prices for the same product. 
The key limit is the possibility in some circumstances that consumers who can buy a 
good at a low price will resell it to consumers who would otherwise have to buy at a 
high price.
Arbitrage
According to the law of one price, identical products should sell for the same price 
everywhere. Let’s explore why the law of one price usually holds true. Suppose that an 
Apple iPad sells for $499 in stores in Atlanta and for $429 in stores in San Francisco. 
Anyone who lives in San Francisco could buy iPads for $429 and resell them for $499 
in Atlanta. They could sell them on eBay or Craigslist or ship them to someone they 
know in Atlanta who could sell them in local flea markets. Buying a product in one 
market at a low price and reselling it in another market at a high price is referred to as 
arbitrage. The profits received from engaging in arbitrage are referred to as arbitrage 
profits.
As the supply of iPads in Atlanta increases, the price of iPads in Atlanta will de-
cline, and as the supply of iPads in San Francisco decreases, the price of iPads in San 
Francisco will rise. Eventually the arbitrage process will eliminate most, but not all, of 
the price difference. Some price difference will remain because sellers must pay to list 
iPads on eBay or to ship them to Atlanta. The costs of carrying out a transaction—by, 
for example, listing items on eBay and shipping them across the country—are called 
transactions costs. The law of one price holds exactly only if transactions costs are zero. 
As we will soon see, in cases in which it is impossible to resell a product, the law of one 
price will not hold, and firms will be able to practice price discrimination. Apart from 
this important qualification, we expect that arbitrage will result in a  product selling for 
the same price everywhere.

Pricing Strategy, the Law of One Price, and Arbitrage  
521
Why Don’t All Firms Charge the Same Price?
The law of one price may appear to be violated even where transactions costs are zero 
and a product can be resold. For example, different Web sites may sell what seem to 
be identical products for different prices. We can resolve this apparent contradiction 
if we look more closely at what “product” an Internet Web site—or another business— 
actually offers for sale.
Suppose you want to buy a copy of John Grisham’s best seller The Litigators. You use 
Google, mySimon.com, or some other search engine to compare the book’s price at vari-
ous Web sites. You get the results shown in Table 16.1.
Would you automatically buy the book from one of the last two sites listed rather 
than from Amazon.com or BarnesandNoble.com? We can think about why you might 
not. Consider what these sites offer for sale. Amazon.com is not just offering The Litiga-
tors; it is offering The Litigators delivered quickly to your home, well packaged so it’s not 
Solving the Problem
Step 1: Review the chapter material. This problem is about arbitrage, so you may 
want to review the section “Arbitrage” on page 520. If necessary, also review 
the discussion of the benefits from trade in Chapters 2 and 9.
Step 2: Use the discussion of arbitrage and the discussion in earlier chapters of 
the benefits from trade to answer the questions. Many of the goods on eBay 
have been bought at a low price and are being resold at a higher price. In fact, 
some people supplement their incomes by buying collectibles and other goods 
at garage sales and reselling them on eBay. Does eBay serve a useful economic 
purpose? Economists would say that it does. Consider the case of Lou, who 
buys collectible movie posters and resells them on eBay. Suppose Lou buys an 
Avengers poster at a garage sale for $30 and resells it on eBay for $60. Both the 
person who sold to Lou at the garage sale and the person who bought from 
him on eBay must have been made better off by the deals or they would not 
have made them. Lou has performed the useful service of locating the poster 
and making it available for sale on eBay. In carrying out this service, Lou has 
incurred costs, including the opportunity cost of his time spent searching ga-
rage sales, the opportunity cost of the funds he has tied up in posters he has 
purchased but not yet sold, and the cost of the fees eBay charges him. It is easy 
to sell goods on eBay, so over time, competition among Lou and other movie 
poster dealers should cause the difference between the prices of posters sold 
at garage sales and the prices on eBay to shrink until they are equal to the 
dealers’ costs of reselling the posters.

Is Arbitrage Just a Rip-off?
People are often suspicious of arbitrage. Buying something 
at a low price and reselling it at a high price exploits the per-
son buying at the high price. Or does it? Is this view correct? 
If so, do the auctions on eBay serve any useful economic 
purpose?

firms differentiate the products they sell in many ways. One way is by providing faster 
and more reliable delivery than competitors.
Amazon.com and BarnesandNoble.com have built reputations for fast and reliable 
service. New Internet booksellers who lack that reputation will have to differentiate their 
products on the basis of price, as the two fictitious firms listed in the table have done. 
So, the difference in the prices of products offered on Web sites does not violate the 
law of one price. A book Amazon.com offers for sale is not the same product as a book

Price Discrimination: Charging Different 
Prices for the Same Product
We saw at the beginning of this chapter that the Walt Disney Company charges differ-
ent prices for the same product: admission to Disney World. Charging different prices 
to different customers for the same good or service when the price differences are not 
due to differences in cost is called price discrimination. But doesn’t price discrimina-
tion contradict the law of one price? Why doesn’t the possibility of arbitrage profits lead 
people to buy at the low price and resell at the high price?

Don’t Confuse Price Discrimination 
with Other Types of Discrimination
Don’t confuse price discrimination with discrimination 
based on race or gender. Discriminating on the basis of 
arbitrary characteristics, such as race or gender, is illegal 
under the civil rights laws. Price discrimination is legal 
because it involves charging people different prices on the 
basis of their willingness to pay rather than on the basis 
of arbitrary characteristics. There is a gray area, however, 
when companies charge different prices on the basis of 
gender. For example, insurance companies usually charge 
women lower prices than men for automobile insurance. 
The courts have ruled that this is not illegal discrimination 
under the civil rights laws because women, on average, 
have better driving records than men. Because the costs of 
insuring men are higher than the costs of insuring women, 
insurance companies are allowed to charge men higher 
prices. Notice that this is not actually price discrimination 
as we have defined it here. Price discrimination involves 
charging different prices for the same product where the 
price differences are not due to differences in cost.

Price Discrimination: Charging Different Prices for the Same Product 
523
The Requirements for Successful  
Price Discrimination
A successful strategy of price discrimination has three requirements:
 1. A firm must possess market power.
 2. Some consumers must have a greater willingness to pay for the product than other con-
sumers, and the firm must be able to know what prices customers are willing to pay.
 3. The firm must be able to divide up—or segment—the market for the product so that 
consumers who buy the product at a low price are not able to resell it at a high price. 
In other words, price discrimination will not work if arbitrage is possible.
A firm selling in a perfectly competitive market cannot practice price discrimina-
tion because it can only charge the market price. But because most firms do not sell in 
perfectly competitive markets, they have market power and can set the price of the good 
they sell. Many firms may also be able to determine that some customers have a greater 
willingness to pay for a product than others. However, the third requirement—that mar-
kets be segmented so that customers buying at a low price will not be able to resell the 
product—can be difficult to fulfill. For example, some people really love Big Macs and 
would be willing to pay $10 rather than do without one. Other people would not be will-
ing to pay a penny more than $1 for a Big Mac. Even if McDonald’s could identify dif-
ferences in the willingness of its customers to pay for Big Macs, it would not be able to 
charge them different prices. Suppose McDonald’s knows that Joe is willing to pay $10, 
whereas Jill will pay only $1. If McDonald’s tries to charge Joe $10, he will just have Jill 
buy a Big Mac for him.
Only firms that can keep consumers from reselling a product are able to practice 
price discrimination. Because buyers cannot resell the product, the law of one price 
does not hold. For example, movie theaters know that many people are willing to pay 
more to see a movie in the evening than during the afternoon. As a result, theaters usu-
ally charge higher prices for tickets to evening showings than for tickets to afternoon 
showings. They keep these markets separate by making the tickets to afternoon show-
ings a different color or by having the time printed on them and by having a ticket 
taker examine the tickets. That makes it difficult for someone to buy a lower-priced 
ticket in the afternoon and use the ticket to gain admission to an evening showing.
Figure 16.1 illustrates how the owners of movie theaters use price discrimina-
tion to increase their profits. The marginal cost to the movie theater owner from 
another person attending a showing is very small: a little more wear on a theater seat 
and a few more kernels of popcorn to be swept from the floor. In previous chapters, 
we assumed that marginal cost has a U shape. In Figure 16.1, we assume for sim-
plicity that marginal cost is a constant $0.50, shown as a horizontal line. Panel (a) 
shows the demand for afternoon showings. In this segment of its market, the theater 
should maximize profit by selling the quantity of tickets for which marginal revenue 
equals marginal cost, or 450 tickets. We know from the demand curve that the the-
ater can sell 450 tickets at a price of $7.25 per ticket. Panel (b) shows the demand for 
evening showings. Notice that charging $7.25 per ticket would not be profit maxi-
mizing in this market. At a price of $7.25, the theater sells 850 tickets, which is 225 
more tickets than the profit-maximizing quantity of 625. By charging $7.25 for tick-
ets to afternoon showings and $9.75 for tickets to evening showings, the theater has 
maximized profits.
Figure 16.1 also illustrates another important point about price discrimination: 
When firms can practice price discrimination, they will charge customers who are less 
sensitive to price—those whose demand for the product is less elastic—a higher price 
and charge customers who are more sensitive to price—those whose demand is more 
elastic—a lower price. In this case, the demand for tickets to evening showings is less 
elastic, so the price charged is higher, and the demand for tickets to afternoon showings 
is more elastic, so the price charged is lower.

Solving the Problem
Step 1: Review the chapter material. This problem is about using price discrimina-
tion to increase profits, so you may want to review the section “Price Dis-
crimination: Charging Different Prices for the Same Product,” which begins 
on page 522.
Step 2: Explain why charging different prices to education customers and other 
customers will increase Apple’s profits. It makes sense for Apple to charge 
different prices if education customers have a different price elasticity of de-
mand than do other customers. In that case, Apple will charge the market 
segment with the less elastic demand a higher price and the market segment

How Apple Uses Price Discrimination  
to Increase Profits
During the fall of 2011, Apple was selling MacBook Pro 
laptop computers with 13-inch screens on its Web site and 
in its retail stores for $1,499. But college students and fac-
ulty members could buy the same computer from Apple 
for $1,399. Why would Apple charge different prices for the 
same computer, depending on whether the buyer is an edu-
cation customer? Draw two graphs to illustrate your answers: 
one for the general public and one for educational customers.

maximizing, as panel (b) shows. At a price of $7.25, 850 tickets would be sold 
to evening showings, which is more than the profit-maximizing number of 
625  tickets. To maximize profits, the theater should charge $9.75 for tickets to 
 evening showings.

 education customers the lower price, they must have a more elastic demand 
than do other customers.
Step 3: Draw a graph to illustrate your answer. Your graphs should look like the 
ones below, where we have chosen hypothetical quantities to illustrate  
the ideas. As in the case of movie theaters, you can assume for simplicity that 
the marginal cost is constant; in the graph we assume that the marginal cost 
is $400.

Panel (a) shows that in the education customers segment of the market, 
marginal revenue equals marginal cost at 20,000 computers sold. Therefore, 
Apple should charge a price of $1,399 to maximize profits. But if Apple also 
charges $1,399 in the general public segment of the market, shown in panel (b),  
it will sell 32,500 computers, which is more than the profit-maximizing quan-
tity. By charging $1,499 to the general public, Apple will sell 30,500 comput-
ers, the profit-maximizing quantity. We have shown that Apple maximizes its 
profits by charging education customers a lower price than it charges the gen-
eral public. Notice that although the demand curve in panel (a) is more elas-
tic, it is also steeper. This reminds us of the important point from Chapter 6  
that elasticity is different from slope.

Airlines: The Kings of Price Discrimination
Airline seats are a perishable product. Once a plane has taken off from Chicago for Los 
Angeles, any seat that has not been sold on that particular flight will never be sold. In 
addition, the marginal cost of flying one additional passenger is low. This situation gives 
airlines a strong incentive to manage prices so that as many seats as possible are filled on 
each flight.

526 
C H A P T E R  1 6  Pricing Strategy
Airlines divide their customers into two main categories: business travelers and lei-
sure travelers. Business travelers often have inflexible schedules, can’t commit until the 
last minute to traveling on a particular day, and, most importantly, are not very sensitive 
to changes in price. The opposite is true for leisure travelers: They are flexible about 
when they travel, willing to buy their tickets well in advance, and sensitive to changes in 
price. Based on what we discussed earlier in this chapter, you can see that airlines will 
maximize profits by charging business travelers higher ticket prices than leisure travelers,  
but they need to determine who is a business traveler and who is a leisure traveler. Some 
airlines do this by requiring people who want to buy a ticket at the leisure price to buy 
14 days in advance and to stay at their destination over a Saturday night. Anyone un-
able to meet these requirements must pay a much higher price. Business travelers end 
up paying the higher ticket price because they often cannot make their plans 14 days in 
advance of their flight and don’t want to stay over a weekend. The gap between leisure 
fares and business fares is often substantial. For example, in September 2011, the price 
of a leisure-fare ticket between New York and San Francisco on Continental Airlines 
was $378. The price of a business-fare ticket was $1,008.
The airlines go well beyond a single leisure fare and a single business fare in their 
pricing strategies. Although they ordinarily charge high prices for tickets sold only a few 
days in advance, airlines are willing to reduce prices for seats that they expect won’t sell 
at existing prices. Since the late 1980s, airlines have employed economists and math-
ematicians to construct computer models of the market for airline tickets. To calculate a 
suggested price each day for each seat, these models take into account factors that affect 
the demand for tickets, such as the season of the year, the length of the route, the day of 
the week, and whether the flight typically attracts primarily business or leisure travelers. 
This practice of continually adjusting prices to take into account fluctuations in demand 
is called yield management.
Since the late 1990s, Internet sites such as Priceline.com have helped the airlines to 
implement yield management. On Priceline.com, buyers commit to paying a price of 
their choosing for a ticket on a particular day and agree that they will fly at any time on 
that day. This gives airlines the opportunity to fill seats that otherwise would have gone 
empty, particularly on late-night or early-morning flights, even though the price may be 
well below the normal leisure fare. In 2001, several airlines came together to form the 
Internet site Orbitz, which became another means of filling seats at discount prices. In 
fact, in the past few years, the chance that you paid the same price for your airline ticket 
as the person sitting next to you has become quite small. Figure 16.2 shows an actual

 Figure 16.2  33 Customers and 27 Different Prices
To fill as many seats on a flight as possible, airlines charge many different ticket 
prices. The 33 passengers on this United Air Lines flight from Chicago to Los 
Angeles paid 27 different prices for their tickets, including one passenger who 
used frequent flyer miles to obtain a free ticket. The first number in the figure is 
the price paid for the ticket; the second number is the number of days in advance 
that the ticket was purchased.

How Colleges Use Yield  
Management
Traditionally, colleges have based financial aid decisions only 
on the incomes of prospective students. In recent years, how-
ever, many colleges have started using yield management techniques, first developed 
for the airlines, to determine the amount of financial aid they offer different students. 
Colleges typically use a name such as “financial aid engineering” or “student enrollment 
management” rather than “yield management” to describe what they are doing. There 
is an important difference between the airlines and colleges: Colleges are interested not 
just in maximizing the revenue they receive from student tuition but also in increasing 
the academic quality of the students who enroll.
The “price” a college charges equals the full tuition minus any financial aid it pro-
vides students. When colleges use yield management techniques, they increase financial 
aid offers to students who are likely to be more price sensitive, and they reduce financial 
aid offers to students who are likely to be less price sensitive. As Stanford economist 
Caroline Hoxby puts it, “Universities are trying to find the people whose decisions will 
be changed by these [financial aid] grants.” Some of the factors colleges use to judge how 
sensitive to price students are likely to be include whether they applied for early admis-
sion, whether they came for an on-campus interview, their intended major, their home 
state, and the level of their family’s income. William F. Elliot, vice president for enroll-
ment management at Carnegie Mellon University, advises, “If finances are a concern, 
you shouldn’t be applying any place [for] early decision” because you are less likely to 
receive a large financial aid offer.
Many students (and their parents) are critical of colleges that use yield manage-
ment techniques in allocating financial aid. Some colleges, such as those in the Ivy 
League, have large enough endowments to meet all of their students’ financial aid 
needs, so they don’t practice yield management. Less well-endowed colleges defend the 
practice on the grounds that it allows them to recruit the best students at a lower cost 
in financial aid.
Based on Jacques Steinberg, “Early Signs That College Yields Did Not Change Dramatically,” New York Times, May 8, 2009; 
Jane J. Kim and Anjali Athavaley, “Colleges Seek to Address Affordability,” Wall Street Journal, May 3, 2007; and Albert 
B. Crenshaw, “Price Wars on Campus: Colleges Use Discounts to Draw Best Mix of Top Students, Paying Customers,” 
 Washington Post, October 15, 2002.

Perfect Price Discrimination
If a firm knew every consumer’s willingness to pay—and could keep consumers who 
bought a product at a low price from reselling it—the firm could charge every consumer 
a different price. In this case of perfect price discrimination—also known as first-degree 
price discrimination—each consumer would have to pay a price equal to the consumer’s 
willingness to pay and, therefore, would receive no consumer surplus. To see why, re-
member from Chapter 4 that consumer surplus is the difference between the highest 
price a consumer is willing to pay for a product and the price the consumer actually 
pays. But if the price the consumer pays is the maximum the consumer would be willing 
to pay, there is no consumer surplus.

528 
C H A P T E R  1 6  Pricing Strategy
Figure 16.3 shows the effects of perfect price discrimination. To simplify the dis-
cussion, we assume that the firm is a monopoly and that it has constant marginal and 
average costs. Panel (a) should be familiar from Chapter 15. It shows the case of a mo-
nopolist who cannot practice price discrimination and, therefore, can charge only a 
single price for its product. The monopolist maximizes profits by producing the level 
of output where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. Recall that the economically 
efficient level of output occurs where price is equal to marginal cost, which is the level of 
output in a perfectly competitive market. Because the monopolist produces where price 
is greater than marginal cost, it causes a loss of economic efficiency equal to the area of 
the deadweight loss triangle in the figure.
Panel (b) shows the situation of a monopolist practicing perfect price discrimination. 
Because the firm can charge each consumer the maximum each consumer is willing to 
pay, its marginal revenue from selling one more unit is equal to the price of that unit. 
Therefore, the monopolist’s marginal revenue curve becomes equal to its demand curve, 
and the firm will continue to produce up to the point where price is equal to marginal 
cost. It may seem like a paradox, but the ability to practice perfect price discrimination 
causes the monopolist to produce the efficient level of output. By doing so, the monopolist  
converts consumer surplus and what is deadweight loss in panel (a) into profits. In both 
panel (a) and panel (b), the profit shown is also producer surplus.
Even though the result in panel (b) is more economically efficient than the result 
in panel (a), consumers clearly are worse off because the amount of consumer surplus 
has been reduced to zero. We probably will never see a case of perfect price discrimina-
tion in the real world because firms typically do not know how much each consumer 
is willing to pay and therefore cannot charge each consumer a different price. Still, this 
extreme case helps us to see the two key results of price discrimination:
 1. Profits increase.
 2. Consumer surplus decreases.

Panel (a) shows the case of a monopolist who cannot practice price discrimina-

those in Chapter 15, shows that to maximize profits, the monopolist will pro-
duce the level of output where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. The re-
sulting profit is shown by the area of the green rectangle. Given the monopoly 
price, the amount of consumer surplus in this market is shown by the area of 
the blue triangle. The economically efficient level of output occurs where price 
equals marginal cost. Because the monopolist stops production at a level of out-
put where price is above marginal cost, there is a deadweight loss equal to the 
area of the yellow triangle. In panel (b), the monopolist is able to practice perfect 
price discrimination by charging a different price to each consumer. The result 
is to convert both the consumer surplus and the deadweight loss from panel (a) 
into profit.

 
Price Discrimination: Charging Different Prices for the Same Product 
529
Perfect price discrimination improves economic efficiency. Can we also say that 
this will be the case if price discrimination is less than perfect? Often, less-than- 
perfect price discrimination will improve economic efficiency. But under certain cir-
cumstances, it may actually reduce economic efficiency, so we can’t draw a general 
conclusion.
Price Discrimination across Time
Firms are sometimes able to engage in price discrimination over time. With this strat-
egy, firms charge a higher price for a product when it is first introduced and a lower 
price later. Some consumers are early adopters who will pay a high price to be among the 
first to own certain new products. This pattern helps explain why DVD players, Blu-ray 
 players, digital cameras, and flat-screen plasma televisions all sold for very high prices 
when they were first introduced. After the demand of the early adopters was satisfied, 
the companies reduced prices to attract more price-sensitive customers. For example, the 
price of DVD players dropped by 95 percent within five years of their introduction. Some 
of the price reductions over time for these products were also due to falling costs, as com-
panies took advantage of economies of scale, but some represented price  discrimination 
across time.
Book publishers routinely use price discrimination across time to increase profits. 
Hardcover editions of novels have much higher prices and are published months before 
paperback editions. For example, the hardcover edition of John Grisham’s novel The 
Litigators was published in October 2011 at a price of $28.95. The paperback edition was 
published in June 2012 for $9.99. Although this difference in price might seem to reflect 
the higher costs of producing hardcover books, in fact, it does not. The marginal cost 
of printing another copy of the hardcover is about $1.50. The marginal cost of printing 
another copy of the paperback edition is only slightly less, about $1.25. So, the differ-
ence in price between the hardcover and paperback is driven primarily by differences 
in demand. John Grisham’s most devoted fans want to read his next book at the earliest 
possible moment and are not very sensitive to price. Many casual readers are also in-
terested in Grisham’s books but will read something else if the price of Grisham’s latest 
book is too high.
As Figure 16.4 shows, a publisher will maximize profits by segmenting the  
market—in this case across time—and by charging a higher price to the less elastic 
market segment and a lower price to the more elastic segment. (This example is simi-
lar to our earlier analysis of movie tickets in Figure 16.1 on page 524.) If the publisher 
had skipped the hardcover and issued only the paperback version at a price of $9.99 
when the book was first published in October, its revenue would have dropped by the 
number of readers who bought the hardcover multiplied by the difference between the 
price of the hardcover and the price of the paperback, or 500,000 3 ($28.952$9.99) 5 
$9,480,000.
Can Price Discrimination Be Illegal?
In Chapter 15, we saw that Congress has passed antitrust laws to promote compe-
tition. Price discrimination may be illegal if its effect is to reduce competition in 
an industry. In 1936, Congress passed the Robinson–Patman Act, which outlawed 
price discrimination that reduced competition and which also contained language 
that could be interpreted as making illegal all price discrimination not based on dif-
ferences in cost. In the 1960s, the Federal Trade Commission sued Borden, Inc., un-
der this act because Borden was selling the same evaporated milk for two different 
prices. Cans with the Borden label were sold for a high price, and cans sold to super-
markets to be repackaged as the supermarkets’ private brands were sold for a much 
lower price. The courts ultimately ruled that Borden had not violated the law be-
cause the price differences increased, rather than reduced, competition in the market

for evaporated milk. In recent years, the courts have interpreted Robinson–Patman 
narrowly, allowing firms to use the types of price discrimination described in this

Price Discrimination  
with a Twist at Netflix
Price discrimination usually refers to charging different 
prices to different consumers for the same good or service. 
But price discrimination can also involve charging the same price for goods or ser-
vices of different quality. Netflix, an online DVD rental service, has apparently en-
gaged in this second form of price discrimination. According to a newspaper story, 
“Netflix customers who pay the same price for the same service are often treated dif-
ferently, depending on their rental patterns.” Netflix subscribers pay a fixed monthly 
fee to rent a given number of DVDs. For instance, in 2011, Netflix was charging $23.98 
per month to rent three DVDs at a time as well as receive unlimited streaming. (Many 
fewer movies are available for streaming than are available on DVD.) After a sub-
scriber returns a DVD, Netflix mails that subscriber a new DVD. Subscribers under 
this plan can rent an unlimited number of DVDs per month, although they can have 
no more than three at any one time. Netflix has become very popular, with more than 
24 million subscribers.
But does every Netflix subscriber receive service of the same quality? In par-
ticular, does every subscriber have an equal chance of receiving the latest movie re-
leased on DVD? Apparently not. Subscribers who rent the fewest movies per month

have the best chance of receiving the latest releases and typically receive their DVDs 
faster. According to Netflix’s DVD Terms and Conditions (the “fine print” that most 
subscribers don’t read):
In determining priority for shipping and inventory allocation, we may utilize 
many different factors. . . . For example, if all other factors are the same, we give 
priority to those members who receive the fewest DVDs through our service. . . . 
Also . . .  [the service you experience] may be different from the service we pro-
vide to other members on the same membership plan.
One Netflix subscriber was quoted in a newspaper article as saying, “Sometimes it 
would be two or three months before I got [a movie] once it came out on DVD. The 
longer I was a customer, the worse it got.”
Why would Netflix provide better service to subscribers who rent only a few 
DVDs per month and poorer service to subscribers who rent many DVDs per month? 
Subscribers who rent many DVDs per month are likely to have less elastic demand—
they really like watching movies—than subscribers who rent only a few DVDs per 
month. As we have seen in this chapter, firms can increase their profits by charging 
higher prices to consumers with less elastic demand and lower prices to consumers 
with more elastic demand. But this strategy works only if firms have a way of reliably 
separating consumers into groups on the basis of how elastic their demand is. When 
they first subscribe, Netflix has no way of separating its consumers on the basis of 
how elastic their demand is, so it has to charge the same price to everyone. But after 
a few months of observing a subscriber’s pattern of rentals, Netflix has enough infor-
mation to determine whether the subscriber’s demand is more or less elastic. By re-
ducing the level of service to subscribers with less elastic demand, Netflix is, in effect, 
raising the price these consumers pay relative to consumers who receive better ser-
vice. In this way, Netflix engages in price discrimination and increases its profits over 
what they would be if every subscriber received the same service at the same price.

Other Pricing Strategies
In addition to price discrimination, firms use many different pricing strategies, depend-
ing on the nature of their products, the level of competition in their markets, and the 
characteristics of their customers. In this section, we consider three important strate-
gies: odd pricing, cost-plus pricing, and two-part tariffs.
Odd Pricing: Why Is the Price $2.99 Instead of $3.00?
Many firms use what is called odd pricing—for example, charging $4.95 instead of $5.00, 
or $199 instead of $200. Surveys show that 80 percent to 90 percent of the products sold 
in supermarkets have prices ending in “9” or “5” rather than “0.” Odd pricing has a long 
history. In the early nineteenth century, most goods in the United States were sold in 
general stores and did not have fixed prices. Instead, prices were often determined by 
haggling, much as prices of new cars are often determined today by haggling on dealers’ 
lots. Later in the nineteenth century, when most products began to sell for a fixed price, 
odd pricing became popular.

532 
C H A P T E R  1 6  Pricing Strategy
Different explanations have been given for the origin of odd pricing. One explana-
tion is that it began because goods imported from Great Britain had a reputation for 
high quality. When the prices of British goods in British currency—the pound—were 
translated into U.S. dollars, the result was an odd price. Because customers connected 
odd prices with high-quality goods, even sellers of domestic goods charged odd prices. 
Another explanation is that odd pricing began as an attempt to guard against employee 
theft. An odd price forced an employee to give the customer change, which reduced 
the likelihood that the employee would simply pocket the customer’s money without 
recording the sale.
Whatever the origins of odd pricing, why do firms still use it today? The most 
obvious answer is that an odd price, say $9.99, seems somehow significantly—more 
than a penny—cheaper than $10.00. But do consumers really have this illusion? To 
find out, three market researchers conducted a study. We saw in Chapter 3 that 
demand curves can be estimated statistically. If consumers have the illusion that 
$9.99 is significantly cheaper than $10.00, they will demand a greater quantity of 
goods at $9.99—and other odd prices—than the estimated demand curve predicts. 
The researchers surveyed consumers about their willingness to purchase six differ-
ent products—ranging from a block of cheese to an electric blender—at a series of 
prices. Ten of the prices were either odd cent prices—99 cents or 95 cents—or odd 
dollar prices—$95 or $99. Nine of these 10 odd prices resulted in an odd-price ef-
fect, with the quantity demanded being greater than predicted using the estimated 
demand curve. The study was not conclusive because it relied on surveys rather 
than on observing actual purchasing behavior and because it used only a small 
group of products, but the study does provide some evidence that using odd prices 
makes economic sense.
Why Do Some Firms Use Cost-Plus Pricing?
Many firms use cost-plus pricing, which involves adding a percentage markup to av-
erage cost. With this pricing strategy, the firm first calculates average cost at a par-
ticular level of production, usually equal to the firm’s expected sales. The firm then 
applies a percentage markup, say 30 percent, to the estimated average cost to arrive 
at the price. For example, if average cost is $100 and the percentage markup is 30 
percent, the price will be $130. For a firm selling multiple products, the markup is 
intended to cover all costs, including those that the firm cannot assign to any par-
ticular product. Most firms have costs that are difficult to assign to one particular 
product. For example, the work performed by the employees in the accounting and 
finance departments at McDonald’s applies to all of McDonald’s products and can’t 
be assigned directly to Big Macs or Happy Meals.
Cost-Plus Pricing in the Publishing 
Industry
Book publishing companies incur substantial costs for editing, 
designing, marketing, and warehousing books. These costs are 
difficult to assign directly to any particular book. Most publishers arrive at a price for 
a book by applying a markup to their production costs, which are usually divided into 
plant costs and manufacturing costs. Plant costs include typesetting the manuscript and 
preparing graphics or artwork for printing. Manufacturing costs include the costs of 
printing, paper, and binding the book.
Consider the following example for the hypothetical new book by Adam Smith, 
How to Succeed at Economics without Really Trying. We will assume that the book is

Total Production Cost
$22,500
With total production cost of $22,500 and production of 5,000 books, the per-unit 
production cost is $22,500/5,000 5 $4.50. Many publishers multiply the unit produc-
tion cost number by 7 or 8 to arrive at the retail price they will charge customers in 
bookstores. In this case, multiplying by 7 results in a price of $31.50 for the book. The 
markup seems quite high, but publishers typically sell books to bookstores at a 40 per-
cent discount. Although a customer in a bookstore will pay $31.50 for the book—or less, 
of course, if it is purchased from a bookseller that discounts the retail price—the pub-
lisher receives only $18.90. The difference between the $18.90 received from the book-
store and the $4.50 production cost equals the cost of editing, marketing, warehousing, 
paying a royalty to the author of the book, and all other costs, including the opportunity 
cost of the investment in the firm by its owners, plus any economic profit the owners 
receive.

chapter.
MyEconLab
We have seen that firms maximize profit by producing the quantity where marginal 
revenue equals marginal cost and charging a price that will cause consumers to buy that 
quantity. The cost-plus approach doesn’t appear to maximize profits unless the cost-plus 
price turns out to be the same as the price that will cause the quantity sold to be where 
marginal revenue is equal to marginal cost. Economists have two views of cost-plus 
pricing. One is that cost-plus pricing is simply a mistake that firms should avoid. The 
other view is that cost-plus pricing is a good way to come close to the profit-maximizing 
price when either marginal revenue or marginal cost is difficult to calculate.
Small firms often like cost-plus pricing because it is easy to use. Unfortunately, these 
firms can fall into the trap of mechanically applying a cost-plus pricing rule, which may 
result in charging prices that do not maximize profits. The most obvious problems with 
cost-plus pricing are that it ignores demand and focuses on average cost rather than 
marginal cost. If a firm’s marginal cost is significantly different from its average cost at 
its current level of production, cost-plus pricing is unlikely to maximize profits.
Despite these problems, cost-plus pricing is used by some large firms that have the 
knowledge and resources to devise a better method of pricing if cost-plus pricing fails to 
maximize profits. Economists conclude that using cost-plus pricing may be the best way 
to determine the optimal price in two situations:
 1. When marginal cost and average cost are roughly equal
 2. When a firm has difficulty estimating its demand curve

534 
C H A P T E R  1 6  Pricing Strategy
In fact, most large firms that use cost-plus pricing do not just mechanically ap-
ply a markup to their estimate of average cost. Instead, they adjust the markup to 
reflect their best estimate of current demand. A large firm is likely to have a pric-
ing policy committee that adjusts prices based on the current state of competition 
in the industry and the current state of the economy. If competition is strong in a 
weak economy, the pricing committee may decide to set price significantly below the 
 cost-plus price.
In general, firms that take demand into account will charge lower markups on 
products that are more price elastic and higher markups on products that are less elastic. 
Supermarkets, where cost-plus pricing is widely used, have markups in the 5 percent to 
10 percent range for products with more elastic demand, such as soft drinks and break-
fast cereals, and markups in the 50 percent range for products with less elastic demand, 
such as fresh fruits and vegetables.
Why Do Some Firms Use Two-Part Tariffs?
Some firms require consumers to pay an initial fee for the right to buy their product 
and an additional fee for each unit of the product purchased. For example, many golf 
and tennis clubs require members to buy an annual membership in addition to paying a 
fee each time they use the golf course or tennis court. Sam’s Club requires consumers to 
pay a membership fee before shopping at its stores. Cellular phone companies charge a 
monthly fee and then have a per-minute charge after a certain number of minutes have 
been used. Economists refer to this situation as a two-part tariff.
The Walt Disney Company is in a position to use a two-part tariff by charging con-
sumers for admission to Walt Disney World or Disneyland and also charging them to 
use the rides in the parks. As mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, at one time, 
the admission price to Disneyland was low, but people had to purchase tickets to go 
on the rides. Today, you must pay a high price for admission to Disneyland or Disney 
World, but the rides are free once you’re in the park. Figure 16.5 helps us understand 
which of these pricing strategies is more profitable for Disney. The numbers in the fig-
ure are simplified to make the calculations easier.
Once visitors are inside the park, Disney is in the position of a monopolist: No 
other firm is operating rides in Disney World. So, we can draw panel (a) in Figure 
16.5 to represent the market for rides at Disney World. This graph looks like the stan-
dard monopoly graph from Chapter 15. (Note that the marginal cost of another rider 
is quite low. We can assume that it is a constant $2 and equal to the average cost.) It 
seems obvious—but it will turn out to be wrong!—that Disney should determine the 
profit-maximizing quantity of ride tickets by setting marginal revenue equal to mar-
ginal cost. In this case, that would lead to 20,000 ride tickets sold per day at a price 
of $26 per ride. Disney’s profit from selling ride tickets is shown by the area of the 
light-green rectangle, B. The area equals the difference between the $26 price and the 
average cost of $2, multiplied by the 20,000 tickets sold, or ($26 2 $2) 3 20,000 5 
$480,000. Disney also has a second source of profit from selling admission tickets to the 
park. Given the $26 price for ride tickets, what price would Disney be able to charge 
for admission tickets?
Let’s assume the following for simplicity: The only reason people want admission 
to Disney World is to go on the rides, all consumers have the same individual demand 
curve for rides, and Disney knows what this demand curve is. This last  assumption 
allows Disney to practice perfect price discrimination. More realistic assumptions 
would make the outcome of the analysis somewhat different but would not affect the 
main point of how Disney uses a two-part tariff to increase its profits. With these as-
sumptions, we can use the concept of consumer surplus to calculate the maximum 
total amount consumers would be willing to pay for admission. Remember that con-
sumer surplus is equal to the area below the demand curve and above the price line, 
shown by the dark-green triangle, A, in panel (a). The area represents the benefit 
to buyers from consuming the product. In this case, consumers would not be willing

the right to buy as much of a related 
good as they want at a second price.

 
Other Pricing Strategies

to pay more for admission to the park than the consumer surplus they receive from 
the rides. In panel (a) of Figure 16.5, the total consumer surplus when Disney charges 
a price of $26 per ride is $240,000. (This number is easy to calculate if you remember 
that the formula for the area of a triangle is ½ 3 base 3 height, or ½ 3 20,000 3 $24.) 
Disney can set the price of admission tickets so that the total amount spent by buyers 
would be $240,000. In other words, Disney can set the price of admission to cap-
ture the entire consumer surplus from the rides. So, Disney’s total profit from Disney 
World would be the $240,000 it receives from admission tickets plus the $480,000 in 
profit from the rides, or $720,000 per day.
Is this the most profit Disney can earn from selling admission tickets and ride tick-
ets? The answer is “no.” The key to understanding why is to notice that the lower the 
price Disney charges for ride tickets, the higher the price it can charge for admission tickets. 
Lower-priced ride tickets increase consumer surplus from the rides and, therefore, in-
crease the willingness of buyers to pay a higher price for admission tickets. In panel (b)  
of Figure 16.5, we assume that Disney acts as it would in a perfectly competitive mar-
ket and charges a price for ride tickets that is equal to marginal cost, or $2. Charging 
this price increases consumer surplus—and the maximum total amount that Disney can 
charge for admission tickets—from $240,000 to $960,000. (Once again, we use the for-
mula for the area of a triangle to calculate the light-green area in panel (b): ½ 3 40,000 3 
48 5 $960,000.) Disney’s profits from the rides will decline to zero because it is now 
charging a price equal to average cost, but its total profit from Disney World will rise from 
$720,000 per day to $960,000. Table 16.2 summarizes this result.
What is the source of Disney’s increased profit from charging a price equal to mar-
ginal cost? The answer is that Disney has converted what was deadweight loss when 
the monopoly price was charged—the area of triangle C in panel (a)—into consumer 
surplus. Disney then turns this consumer surplus into profit by increasing the price of 
admission tickets.

In panel (a), Disney charges the monopoly price of $26 per ride ticket and 
sells 20,000 ride tickets. Its profit from ride tickets is shown by the area of the 
light-green rectangle, B, $480,000. If Disney is in the position of knowing every 
consumer’s willingness to pay, it can also charge a price for admission tickets 
that would result in the total amount paid for admission tickets being equal to 
total consumer surplus from the rides. Total consumer surplus from the rides 
equals the area of the dark-green triangle, A, or $240,000. So, when charging the 
monopoly price, Disney’s total profit equals $480,000 1 $240,000 or $720,000. 
In panel (b), Disney charges the perfectly competitive price of $2, which results 
in a quantity of 40,000 ride tickets sold. At the lower ride ticket price, Disney can 
charge a higher price for admission tickets, which will increase its total profits 
from operating the park to the area of the light-green triangle, or $960,000.

536 
C H A P T E R  1 6  Pricing Strategy
It is important to note the following about the outcome of a firm using an optimal 
two-part tariff:
 1. Because price equals marginal cost at the level of output supplied, the outcome is 
economically efficient.
 2. All consumer surplus is transformed into profit.
Notice that, in effect, Disney is practicing perfect price discrimination. As we noted 
in our discussion of perfect price discrimination on page 527, Disney’s use of a two-part 
tariff has increased the amount of the product—in this case, rides at Disney World—
consumers are able to purchase but has eliminated consumer surplus. Although it may 
seem paradoxical, consumer surplus was actually higher when consumers were being 
charged the monopoly price for the rides. The solution to the paradox is that although 
consumers pay a lower price for the rides when Disney employs a two-part tariff, the 
overall amount they pay to be at Disney World increases.
Disney actually does follow the profit-maximizing strategy of charging a high price 
for admission to the park and a very low price—zero—for the rides. It seems that Dis-
ney could increase its profits by raising the price for the rides from zero to the marginal 
cost of the rides. But the marginal cost is so low that it would not be worth the expense 
of printing ride tickets and hiring additional workers to sell the tickets and collect them 
at each ride. Finally, note that in practice Disney can’t convert all consumer surplus into 
profit because (1) the demand curves of customers are not all the same, and (2) Disney 
does not know precisely what these demand curves are.

Economics in Your Life
Why So Many Prices to See a Movie?
At the beginning of the chapter, we asked you to think about what you pay for a movie ticket and 
what people in other age groups pay. A movie theater will try to charge different prices to differ-
ent consumers, based on their willingness to pay. If you have two otherwise identical people, one a 
student and one not, you might assume that the student has less income, and thus a lower willing-
ness to pay, than the non-student, and the movie theater would like to charge the student a lower 
price. The movie theater employee can ask to see a student ID to ensure that the theater is giving 
the discount to a student.
But why don’t theaters practice price discrimination at the concession stand? It is likely that 
a student will also have a lower willingness to pay for popcorn, and the theater can check for a 
student ID at the time of purchase, but unlike with the entry ticket, the theater would have a hard 
time preventing the student from giving the popcorn to a non-student once inside the theater. 
Because it is easier to limit resale in movie admissions, we often see different prices for different 
groups. Because it is difficult to limit resale of popcorn and other movie concessions, all groups will 
typically pay the same price.

Conclusion
Firms in perfectly competitive industries must sell their products at the market price. 
For firms in other industries—which means, of course, the vast majority of firms— 
pricing is an important part of the strategy used to maximize profits. We have seen in 
this chapter, for example, that if firms can successfully segment their customers into dif-
ferent groups on the basis of willingness to pay, they can increase their profits by charg-
ing different segments different prices.

Colleges add  
stadium seats with 
‘sports mortgages’
Season ticket holders know the 
annual lament. The cost of prime seats 
keeps rising, even if the team is lousy.
Now, combine that frustration 
with cash-strapped college athletics 
departments, struggling to upgrade 
aging stadiums, and you’ve got the 
latest innovation in marketing for big-
time athletics—the sports mortgage.
At Kansas, Jayhawk fans who sign 
up to pay as much as $105,000 over  
10 years will earn the right to buy 
guaranteed top seats for football over 
the next three decades. In return, the 
seats themselves will stay locked in at 
2010 prices.
California fans have even more 
latitude—30 years to pay for a half-
century’s worth of season football 
tickets. Like a home mortgage, the 
long-term deal requires the equivalent 
of annual interest payments.
The new pricing plans are known 
as “equity seat rights,” and are be-
ing pitched as a win-win for fans and 
teams. Die-hard fans can be certain of 
what they’ll pay to see their favorite 
team well into the future—and can 
always sell tickets in the secondary 
market while taking a tax write-off 
for donating to a school. Teams can 
bank on extra revenue and avoid 
borrowing.
Stadium Capital Financing 
Group, the Chicago company behind 
the change, says it has the potential 
to transform how both college and 
pro teams court their most loyal fans. 
They’re confident sports mortgages 
will overtake the personal seat license, 
which doesn’t necessarily lock in 
ticket prices.
The only trick now is convincing 
fans it’s a good deal.
“Even in difficult financial times, 
the price of the best seats in profes-
sional stadiums and university pro-
grams go up,” said Lou Weisbach, 
Stadium Capital Financing’s chief ex-
ecutive officer. “This is the ultimate 
solution for the shortfalls universities 
are facing in their athletics programs.”
At Kansas, mortgage sales are 
being targeted at the new 3,000-seat 
Gridiron Club, an addition to 90-year-
old Memorial Stadium in Lawrence 
that will offer its members cushioned 
seats, catered food, private restrooms 
and preferred parking.
The school hopes the sales will 
not only cover the costs of $34 million 
in stadium renovations but eventu-
ally will raise a total of $200 million— 
without going into debt or relying on 
tax dollars.
That would pay for renovations 
to Allen Fieldhouse, home of the 
Kansas basketball team, and build 
a new “Olympic village” for the Jay-
hawk track and field, soccer and swim 
teams. Another $40 million would go 
toward academics.
Still, problems remain. The Grid-
iron Club’s planned opening for the 
2010 season has been delayed since 
the school has only been able to raise 
about $5 million of the needed $34 
million, said Jim Marchiony, associate 
athletics director.
The football team’s 2009 perfor-
mance likely didn’t help. After win-
ning its first five games, the Jayhawks 
lost seven in a row. The season ended 
with the resignation of coach Mark 
Mangino amid allegations of mental 
and emotional abuse of players.

Key Points in the Article
The University of Kansas is selling “sports 
mortgages” to those fans who want to pur-
chase season tickets in its new 3,000-seat 
Gridiron Club. With a sports mortgage, 
those fans who want to purchase season 
tickets must also purchase the rights to 
these seats for as much as $105,000. The 
price of each game ticket is in addition to 
the one-time mortgage charge, but fans will 
be allowed to purchase these top seats for 
30 years at 2010 prices. The University of 
Kansas is using this pricing plan as a way 
to pay for stadium renovations as well as 
other campus construction without having 
to go into debt or rely on state tax dollars 
for funding.
Analyzing the News
a The sale of sports mortgages by the 
University of Kansas is an example of 
using a two-part tariff to sell season tickets 
to football games. A fan who wants to buy 
season tickets for seats in the new Gridiron 
Club must buy a mortgage as well as the 
tickets. The mortgages cost as much as 
$105,000 and can be paid over a 10-year 
period. The mortgage also guarantees the 
ticketholder the right to top seats at a fixed 
price for 30 years. The figure below shows 
how a sports team can use a two-part tariff 
to increase profit. Note that the figure uses 
simple, hypothetical numbers. The figure 
assumes that the profit-maximizing monop-
oly price for a season ticket is $2,000. This 
assumes that tickets to individual games 
are sold for $250 each. (There are eight reg-
ular season home games.) Marginal cost is 
assumed to be zero in order to simplify the 
example. Therefore, without charging a 
mortgage fee, the total profit earned by the 
team would equal area B, or $110 million 
($2,000 3 55,000). If the team knew the 
maximum amount each season ticket buyer 
was willing to pay, the team could charge a 
mortgage fee that would result in a total 
amount paid by all season ticket buyers 
equal to area A – the total consumer sur-
plus. The amount is equal to $82.5 million 
[½ 3 ($5,000 2 $2,000) 3 55,000]. The total 
profit earned by the university would in-
crease to the area of A plus the area of B, or 
$192.5 million.
b Pricing plans such as the sports mort-
gage are known as “equity seat rights” 
because they guarantee the seat holder top 
quality seats at locked-in prices for years 
into the future. Stadium Capital Financing 
Group is the company behind this pricing 
idea. This company believes that equity 
seat rights can benefit the fans by guaran-
teeing ticket prices and can benefit sports 
teams by giving them a new source of rev-
enue. The equity seat rights pricing idea is 
the latest evolution of a two-part tariff 
known as the personal seat license, or PSL. 
With a personal seat license, those fans 
who want to purchase season tickets must 
also purchase a license for each seat they 
want to use in the stadium, but ticket prices 
are not locked in at current levels. Several 
National Football League (NFL) teams have 
used, or are considering using, personal 
seat licenses to help finance new stadiums. 
c At the University of Kansas, the reve-
nue generated from the sale of equity 
seat rights is being used not only to finance 
$34 million in renovations to the football 
stadium, but may also be enough to cover 
additional renovations and new construc-
tion around the campus, therefore sparing 
the school from having to rely on tax reve-
nues. Having season ticket holders pay for 
equity seat rights helps shift more of the 
burden of paying for new stadiums or reno-
vations to those fans who use the stadium 
rather than the tax-paying general public, 
many of whom may never visit the facility.
Thinking Critically
1. Many sports fans complain about the 
high prices professional sports teams 
charge to watch games played in new 
stadiums and arenas and argue that 
tickets are being increasingly sold to 
wealthy fans and corporations. Is it bet-
ter for society for teams to charge high 
ticket prices or to lower prices so more 
fans can afford to watch their favorite 
teams play?
2. Suppose that after a new stadium is 
built for a National Football League 
(NFL) franchise, local government of-
ficials respond to complaints from fans 
by preventing the team from selling eq-
uity seat rights and by placing a ceiling 
on ticket prices. What effect would this 
policy have on the quantity demanded 
and the quantity supplied of tickets for 
this team? Would local citizens be better 
off as a result of the policy?
A sports team can use a two-part tariff to increase profits.

Summary
According to the law of one price, identical products should sell for 
the same price everywhere. If a product sells for different prices, it 
will be possible to make a profit through arbitrage: buying a product 
at a low price and reselling it at a high price. The law of one price will 
hold as long as arbitrage is possible. Arbitrage is sometimes blocked 
by high transactions costs, which are the costs in time and other re-
sources incurred to carry out an exchange or because the product 
cannot be resold. Another apparent exception to the law of one price 
occurs when companies offset the higher price they charge for a 
product by providing superior or more reliable service to customers.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE: Explain how a firm can increase its profits through price discrimination.
Summary
Price discrimination occurs if a firm charges different prices 
for the same product when the price differences are not due to 
differences in cost. Three requirements must be met for a firm to 
successfully practice price discrimination: (1) A firm must possess 
market power; (2) some consumers must have a greater willingness

to pay for the product than other consumers, and firms must be 
able to know what customers are willing to pay; and (3) firms 
must be able to divide up—or segment—the market for the prod-
uct so that consumers who buy the product at a low price can-
not resell it a high price. In the case of perfect price discrimination, 
each consumer pays a price equal to the consumer’s willingness  
to pay.

2.1 What is price discrimination? Under what circumstances 
can a firm successfully practice price discrimination?
 
2.2 During a particular week, US Airways charged $498 
for a round-trip ticket on a flight from New York to San 
Francisco, provided that the ticket was purchased at least  
14 days in advance. The price of the same ticket purchased 
two days in advance was $833. Why does US Airways use 
this pricing strategy?

Problems and Applications
 
2.6 According to an article in the Wall Street Journal:
Airlines have increased restrictions on cheap 
fares by raising overnight requirements, up-
ping what had commonly been only a one-
night stay requirement to two and three nights. 
The overnights can be weeknights, so those 
tickets aren’t as onerous as Saturday-night stay 
tickets. But the three-night requirement does 
limit the utility of discounted fares for road 
warriors.
 
 What is a “road warrior”? Would a company put restric-
tions on a service that make the service less desirable to 
some of its customers?

Fares,” Wall Street Journal, August 19, 2008.
 
2.7 An article on the AMC movie theater chain contained the 
following:
In July, [AMC] announced plans to offer 
steeply discounted movie tickets to shows 
on Friday, Saturday and Sunday mornings. 
“Seventy-five percent of the revenue comes 
from the weekend,” Mr. Brown [AMC’s 
CEO] said. His recent initiatives are attempts 
to address the question: “Is there a way with 
price that you can create opportunity, a new 
market?”
 
 Why would it be profitable for AMC to sell “steeply dis-
counted” movie tickets for movies it shows on weekend 
mornings? Wouldn’t the firm’s revenues be higher if it 
charged the regular—higher—price for these showings?

2.8 Political columnist Michael Kinsley wrote, “The infuriat-

on are a crude alternative to administering truth serum 
and asking, ‘So how much are you really willing to pay?’”

much people would be willing to pay for an airline ticket—
really be all the airlines need to practice price discrimina-
tion? Briefly explain.

 2.10 [Related to the Don’t Let This Happen to You on page 522] 
A state law in California makes it illegal for businesses to 
charge men and women different prices for dry cleaning, 
laundry, tailoring, or hair grooming. The state legislator 
who introduced the law did so after a dry cleaner charged 
her more to have her shirts dry-cleaned than to have her 
husband’s shirts dry-cleaned: “They charged me $1.50 
for each of his, and he wears an extra large. They charged 
$3.50 for each of mine, and I wear a small.” According to 
a newspaper article, “the dry cleaning proprietor told her 
that the price difference stemmed from the need for hand 
ironing her shirts because automatic presses are not made 
to handle small-sized women’s garments.” The law proved 
difficult to enforce, with many dry cleaners continuing to 
ignore it years after it was passed.
 
a. Was the dry cleaner practicing price discrimination, as 
defined in this chapter? Briefly explain.

C H A P T E R  1 6  Pricing Strategy
 2.12 [Related to Solved Problem 16.2 on page 524] In the fall 
of 2011, Apple was offering a $100 discount to students 
on MacBook Pro laptops but only $50 on MacBook Air 
laptops. The MacBook Air is a very thin, very light lap-
top that is particularly aimed at businesspeople who travel 
frequently. Why would Apple cut the price more for Mac-
Book Pros than for MacBook Airs?
 2.13 [Related to Solved Problem 16.2 on page 524] In addi-
tion to discounting the price of computers purchased by 
students and faculty, Apple also sells certain computer 
models only to schools and universities. According to a 
discussion on the MacRumors blog:
Apple has quietly launched a lower cost $999 iMac 
for educational institutions this morning. The new 
low-end model is labeled “Education only” and is 
not available for individuals. . . . Apple, in the past, 
has also offered special education only models for 
institutions. . . . has adjusted the hardware down 
in order to fit the sub-$1000 price point.
 
 Is Apple engaging in price discrimination in following this 
policy? If so, why does it prepare special models for educa-
tional institutions rather than cutting the prices of existing 
models purchased by educational buyers? If this is not an 
example of price discrimination, why doesn’t Apple offer 
these computers to the general public?

Assume that the marginal cost of admitting one more stu-
dent is constant for every university. Also assume that at ev-
ery university, the demand for places in the freshman class 
is downward sloping. Now, suppose that the public becomes 
upset that universities charge different prices to different 
students. Responding to these concerns, the federal govern-
ment requires universities to charge the same price to each 
student. In this situation, who will gain, and who will lose?
 2.15 [Related to the Chapter Opener on page 519] Why does 
Walt Disney World charge a lower admission price for chil-
dren aged 3 to 9 than for adults? Why does Disney categorize 
a 10-year-old as an adult for this purpose? Why does it admit 
children under 3 for free? Why does it charge residents of 
Florida a lower price than it charges residents of other states?

price discrimination.
 2.17 [Related to the Making the Connection on page 530] 
Some Netflix subscriptions have a higher price and allow

Summary
In addition to price discrimination, firms also use odd pric-
ing, cost-plus pricing, and two-part tariffs as pricing strategies. 
Firms use odd pricing—for example, charging $1.99 rather than 
$2.00—because consumers tend to buy more at odd prices than 
would be predicted from estimated demand curves. With cost-plus 
pricing, firms set the price for a product by adding a percentage 
markup to average cost. Using cost-plus pricing may be a good 
way to come close to the profit-maximizing price when marginal

revenue or marginal cost is difficult to measure. Some firms can 
require consumers to pay an initial fee for the right to buy their 
product and an additional fee for each unit of the product pur-
chased. Economists refer to this situation as a two-part tariff. 
Sam’s Club, cell phone companies, and many golf and tennis clubs 
use two-part tariffs in pricing their products.

Review Questions
 
3.1 What is odd pricing?
 
3.2 What is cost-plus pricing? Is using cost-plus pricing con-
sistent with a firm maximizing profits? How does the elas-
ticity of demand affect the percentage markup?
 
3.3 Give an example of a firm using a two-part tariff as part of 
its pricing strategy.
 
3.4 Why did the Walt Disney Company switch from charging 
for admission to Disneyland and charging for the rides to 
charging for admission and not charging for the rides?
Problems and Applications
 
3.5 One leading explanation for odd pricing is that it allows 
firms to trick buyers into thinking they are paying less 
than they really are. If this is true, in what types of markets 
and among what groups of consumers would you be most 
likely to find odd pricing? Should the government ban this 
practice and force companies to round up their prices to 
the nearest dollar?
 
3.6 According to an article in the Wall Street Journal, 
 McDonald’s and Burger King have much larger markups 
on French fries and sodas than on hamburgers. Is it likely 
that the companies believe that the demand for French 
fries and sodas is more elastic or less elastic than the de-
mand for hamburgers? Briefly explain.
Based on Diana Ransom, “Can They Really Make Money Off the 
 Dollar Menu?” Wall Street Journal, May 21, 2009.
 
3.7 An article in the Wall Street Journal gave the following 
explanation of how products were traditionally priced at 
Parker-Hannifin Corporation:
For as long as anyone at the 89-year-old com-
pany could recall, Parker used the same sim-
ple formula to determine prices of its 800,000 
parts—from heat-resistant seals for jet engines 
to steel valves that hoist buckets on cherry pick-
ers. Company managers would calculate how 
much it cost to make and deliver each product 
and add a flat percentage on top, usually aim-
ing for about 35%. Many managers liked the 
method because it was straightforward.
 
 Is it likely that this system of pricing maximized the firm’s 
profits? Briefly explain.

CEO Tears Up the Rules,” Wall Street Journal, March 27, 2007, p. A1.
 
3.8 [Related to the Making the Connection on page 532] 
Would you expect a publishing company to use a strict 
cost-plus pricing system for all its books? How might you 
find some indication about whether a publishing company 
actually was using cost-plus pricing for all its books?
 
3.9 Some professional sports teams charge fans a one-time lump 
sum for a personal seat license. The personal seat license allows 
a fan the right to buy season tickets each year. No one without 
a personal seat license can buy season tickets. After the original 
purchase from the team, the personal seat licenses usually can 
be bought and sold by fans—whoever owns the seat license 
in a given year can buy season tickets—but the team does not 
earn any additional revenue from this buying and selling. Sup-
pose a new sports stadium has been built, and the team is try-
ing to decide on the price to charge for season tickets.
 
a. Will the team make more profit from the combination 
of selling personal seat licenses and season tickets if it 
keeps the prices of the season tickets low or if it charges 
the monopoly price? Briefly explain.
 
b. After the first year, is the team’s strategy for pricing sea-
son tickets likely to change?
 
c. Will it make a difference in the team’s pricing strategy 
for season tickets if all the personal seat licenses are 
sold in the first year?
 3.10 During the nineteenth century, the U.S. Congress encour-
aged railroad companies to build transcontinental railways 
across the Great Plains by giving them land grants. At that 
time, the federal government owned most of the land on 
the Great Plains. The land grants consisted of the land on 
which the railway was built and alternating sections of 1 
square mile each on either side of the railway to a distance 
of 6 to 40 miles, depending on the location. The railroad 
companies were free to sell this land to farmers or anyone 
else who wanted to buy it. The process of selling the land 
took decades. Some economic historians have argued that 
the railroad companies charged lower prices to ship freight 
because they owned so much land along the tracks. Briefly 
explain the reasoning of these economic historians.
 3.11 [Related to the Chapter Opener on page 519] If you vis-
ited Disneyland between 1955 and 1982, you could not go on 
most rides without buying a ticket for the ride—in addition to 
the ticket necessary to enter the park. Explain why this pricing 
strategy earned Disney lower profits than the current strategy 
of requiring visitors to purchase a ticket to enter the park but 
not requiring an additional ticket to be purchased for each ride.
 3.12 Thomas Kinnaman, an economist at Bucknell University, 
has analyzed the pricing of garbage collection:
Setting the appropriate fee for garbage collec-
tion can be tricky when there are both fixed 
and marginal costs of garbage collection. . . . A 
curbside price set equal to the average total cost 
of collection would have high garbage genera-
tors partially subsidizing the fixed costs of low 
garbage generators. For example, if the time that 
a truck idles outside a one-can household and a 
two-can household is the same, and the fees are 
set to cover the total cost of garbage collection, 
then the two-can household paying twice that of 
the one-can household has subsidized a portion 
of the collection costs of the one-can household.
 
 Briefly explain how a city might solve this pricing problem 
by using a two-part tariff in setting the garbage collection 
fees it charges households.

545
In Chapter 3, we developed a model for 
analyzing the demand and supply of goods 
and services. We will use some of the same 
concepts in this chapter to analyze the de-
mand and supply of labor and other factors 
of production. But the markets for factors of 
production are not like markets for goods 
and services. The most obvious difference is 
that in factor markets, firms are demanders, 
and households are suppliers.
Another difference between the labor 
market and the markets for goods and ser-
vices is that concepts of fairness arise more 
frequently in labor markets. When an ath-
lete signs a contract for millions of dollars, 
people often wonder: “Why should some-
one playing a game get paid so much more 
than teachers, nurses, and other people do-
ing more important jobs?” Because people 
typically earn most of their income from 
wages and salaries, they often view the la-
bor market as the most important market in 
which they participate.
AN INSIDE LOOK on page 572 applies 
the demand and supply model to the rapidly 
rising salaries of NCAA Division 1-A bas-
ketball coaches.
Based on Ian Browne, “Gonzalez, Red Sox Complete 
Seven-Year Deal,” MLB.com, April 2011; and Jerry 
Crasnick, “Adrian Gonzalez to Red Sox,” EPSN.com, 
 December 5, 2010.
Few businesses generate as much passion as 
sports teams. Sports fans admire the skills of 
star athletes, but many question why they are 
paid high salaries “just for playing a game.” 
Fans also can become frustrated when their 
teams lose the services of star players to 
wealthier teams that can afford to sign players  
to long-term contracts for large salaries. By 
the end of the 2010 season, Adrian  Gonzalez 
had become one of the best players in  Major 
League Baseball (MLB). Gonzalez was a 
three-time All-Star for the San Diego  Padres 
and hit 161 home runs in five years, only 
2 shy of the all-time record. At the end of 
the season, San Diego rewarded Gonzalez 
by exercising the team’s option to pay him 
$6.2 million in 2011—and then traded him 
to the Boston Red Sox. Gonzalez would have 
become a free agent at the end of the 2011 
season. The Padres had the second-lowest 
payroll of all MLB teams and could not afford 
to sign Gonzalez to a long-term contract. The 
Padres traded Gonzalez for three young—
and inexpensive—players. Shortly after 
the 2011 season began, the Red Sox signed 
 Gonzalez to a seven-year contract worth over 
$150 million. The Red Sox can afford to pay 
Gonzalez much more than the Padres could 
because of the higher revenues the team gen-
erates from ticket sales, cable television, and 
broadcast television and radio.
Why Did the San Diego Padres Trade Their 
Best Player to the Boston Red Sox?
Economics in Your Life
How Can You Convince Your Boss to Give You a Raise?
Imagine that you have worked for a local sandwich shop for over a year and are preparing to ask 
for a raise. You might tell the manager that you are a good employee, with a good attitude and 
work ethic. You might also explain that you have learned more about your job and are now able to 
make sandwiches more quickly, track inventory more accurately, and work the cash register more 
effectively than when you were first hired. Will this be enough to convince your manager to give 
you a raise? How can you convince your manager that you are worth more money than you are cur-
rently being paid? As you read this chapter, see if you can answer these questions. You can check 
your answers against those we provide on page 571 at the end of this chapter.

C H A P T E R  1 7  The Markets for Labor and Other Factors of Production
F
irms use factors of production—such as labor, capital, and natural resources—to 
produce goods and services. For example, the Boston Red Sox use labor (baseball 
players), capital (Fenway Park), and natural resources (the land on which Fenway 
Park sits) to produce baseball games. In this chapter, we will explore how firms 
choose the profit-maximizing quantity of labor and other factors of production. The interac-
tion between firms’ demand for labor and households’ supply of labor determines the equi-
librium wage rate.
Because there are many different types of labor, there are many different labor markets. 
The equilibrium wage in the market for baseball players is much higher than the equilib-
rium wage in the market for college professors. We will explore why this is true. We will also 
explore how factors such as discrimination, unions, and compensation for dangerous or un-
pleasant jobs help explain differences among wages. We will then look at personnel economics, 
which is concerned with how firms can use economic analysis to design their employee 
compensation plans. Finally, we will analyze the markets for other factors of production.
The Demand for Labor
Up until now, we have concentrated on consumer demand for final goods and services. 
The demand for labor is different from the demand for final goods and services because 
it is a derived demand. A derived demand for a factor of production depends on the 
demand for the good the factor produces. You demand an Apple iPhone because of the 
utility you receive from making phone calls, texting, playing games, and listening to 
music. Apple’s demand for the labor to make iPhones is derived from the underlying 
consumer demand for iPhones. As a result, we can say that Apple’s demand for labor 
depends primarily on two factors:
 1. The additional iPhones Apple can produce if it hires one more worker
 2. The additional revenue Apple receives from selling the additional iPhones
(In fact, Apple’s suppliers, rather than Apple itself, manufacture the iPhone. For simplicity, 
we are assuming here that Apple does the manufacturing.)
The Marginal Revenue Product of Labor
Let’s consider an example. To keep the main point clear, we’ll assume that in the short 
run, Apple can increase production of iPhones only by increasing the quantity of labor it 
employs. The table in Figure 17.1 shows the relationship between the quantity of workers  
Apple hires, the quantity of iPhones it produces, the additional revenue from selling the 
additional iPhones, and the additional profit from hiring each additional worker.
For simplicity, we are keeping the scale of Apple’s factory very small. We will also 
assume that Apple is a perfect competitor both in the market for selling cell phones and 
in the market for hiring labor. This means that Apple is a price taker in both markets. 
Although this is not realistic, the basic analysis would not change if we assumed that 
Apple can affect the price of cell phones and the wage paid to workers. Given these as-
sumptions, suppose that Apple can sell as many iPhones as it wants at a price of $200 
and can hire as many workers as it wants at a wage of $600 per week. Remember from 
Chapter 11 that the additional output a firm produces as a result of hiring one more 
worker is called the marginal product of labor. In the table in Figure 17.1, we calculate 
the marginal product of labor as the change in total output as each additional worker is 
hired. As we saw in Chapter 11, because of the law of diminishing returns, the marginal 
product of labor declines as a firm hires more workers.
When deciding how many workers to hire, a firm is not interested in how much 
output will increase as it hires another worker but in how much revenue will increase 
as it hires another worker. In other words, what matters is how much the firm’s revenue 
will rise when it sells the additional output it can produce by hiring one more worker. 
Factors of production Labor, capital, 
natural resources, and other inputs 
used to produce goods and services.

The Demand for Labor 
547
We can calculate this amount, which is called the marginal revenue product of labor 
(MRP), by multiplying the additional output produced by the product price. For exam-
ple, consider what happens if Apple increases the number of workers hired from 2 to 3. 
The table in Figure 17.1 shows that hiring the third worker allows Apple to increase its 
weekly output of iPhones from 11 to 15, so the marginal product of labor is 4 iPhones. 
The price of the iPhones is $200, so the marginal revenue product of the third worker is 
4 3 $200 or $800. In other words, Apple adds $800 to its revenue as a result of hiring the 
third worker. In the graph, we plot the values of the marginal revenue product of labor 
at each quantity of labor.
To decide how many workers to hire, Apple must compare the additional revenue 
it earns from hiring another worker to the increase in its costs from paying that worker. 
The difference between the additional revenue and the additional cost is the additional 
profit (or loss) from hiring one more worker. This additional profit is shown in the last 
column of the table in Figure 17.1 and is calculated by subtracting the wage from the 
marginal revenue product of labor. As long as the marginal revenue product of labor is 
greater than the wage, Apple’s profits are increasing, and it should continue to hire more 
workers. When the marginal revenue product of labor is less than the wage,  Apple’s 
profits are falling, and it should hire fewer workers. When the marginal revenue prod-
uct of labor is equal to the wage, Apple has maximized its profits by hiring the optimal 
number of workers. The values in the table show that Apple should hire 4 workers. If 
Apple hires a fifth worker, the marginal revenue product of $400 will be less than the 
wage of $600, and its profits will fall by $200. Table 17.1 summarizes the relationship 
between the marginal revenue product of labor and the wage.
Marginal revenue product of labor 
(MRP) The change in a firm’s revenue

Figure 17.1 
The Marginal Revenue Product 
of Labor and the Demand for 
Labor
The marginal revenue product of labor equals 
the marginal product of labor multiplied  
by the price of the good. The marginal reve-
nue product curve slopes downward  because 
diminishing returns cause the marginal 
product of labor to decline as more workers 
are hired. A firm maximizes profits by hir-
ing workers up to the point where the wage 
equals the marginal revenue product of labor. 
The marginal revenue product of labor curve 
is the firm’s demand curve for labor because 
it tells the firm the profit-maximizing quan-
tity of workers to hire at each wage. For ex-
ample, using the demand curve shown in this 
figure, if the wage is $600, the firm will hire 
4 workers.

Solved Problem 17.1
Hiring Decisions by a Firm  
That Is a Price Maker
We have assumed that Apple can sell as many iPhones as it 
wants to sell, without having to cut the price. Recall from 
Chapter 12 that this is the case for firms in perfectly com-
petitive markets. These firms are price takers. Suppose in-
stead that a firm has market power and is a price maker, so 
that to increase sales, it must reduce the price.
Assume that Apple faces the situation shown in the fol-
lowing table. Fill in the blanks and then determine the 
profit-maximizing number of workers for Apple to hire. 
Briefly explain why hiring this number of workers is profit 
maximizing.
We can see from Figure 17.1 that if Apple has to pay a wage of $600 per week, it 
should hire 4 workers. If the wage were to rise to $1,000, then applying the rule that 
profits are maximized where the marginal revenue product of labor equals the wage, 
Apple should hire only 2 workers. Similarly, if the wage is only $400 per week, Apple 
should hire 5 workers. In fact, the marginal revenue product curve tells a firm how 
many workers it should hire at any wage rate. In other words, the marginal revenue prod-
uct of labor curve is the demand curve for labor.

Solving the Problem
Step 1: Review the chapter material. This problem is about determining the profit-
maximizing quantity of labor for a firm to hire, so you may want to review the 
section “The Demand for Labor,” which begins on page 546.
Step 2: Fill in the blanks in the table. As Apple hires more workers, it sells more 
iPhones and earns more revenue. You can calculate how revenue increases by 
multiplying the number of iPhones produced—shown in column (2)—by the 
price—shown in column (4). Then you can calculate the marginal revenue 

 
The Demand for Labor

The Market Demand Curve for Labor
We can determine the market demand curve for labor in the same way we determine a 
market demand curve for a good. We saw in Chapter 10 that the market demand curve 
for a good is determined by adding up the quantity of the good demanded by each 
consumer at each price. Similarly, the market demand curve for labor is determined by 
adding up the quantity of labor demanded by each firm at each wage, holding constant 
all other variables that might affect the willingness of firms to hire workers.
Factors That Shift the Market Demand  
Curve for Labor
In constructing the demand curve for labor, we held constant all variables—except for 
the wage—that would affect the willingness of firms to demand labor. An increase or a 
decrease in the wage causes an increase or a decrease in the quantity of labor demanded, 
which we show by a movement along the demand curve. If any variable other than the 
wage changes, the result is an increase or a decrease in the demand for labor, which we 
product of labor as the change in revenue as each additional worker is hired. 
(Notice that in this case, marginal revenue product is not calculated by mul-
tiplying the marginal product by the product price. Because Apple is a price 
maker, its marginal revenue from selling additional iPhones is less than the 
price of iPhones.) Finally, you can calculate the additional profit from hiring 
one more worker by subtracting the wage—shown in column (7)—from each 
worker’s marginal revenue product.

Step 3: Use the information in the table to determine the profit-maximizing 
quantity of workers to hire. To determine the profit-maximizing quantity 
of workers to hire, you need to compare the marginal revenue product of 
labor with the wage. Column (8) makes this comparison by subtracting the 
wage from the marginal revenue product. As long as the values in column 
(8) are positive, the firm should continue to hire workers. The marginal rev-
enue product of the second worker is $680, and the wage is $500, so column 
(8) shows that hiring the second worker will add $180 to Apple’s profits. The 
marginal revenue product of the third worker is $340, and the wage is $500, 
so hiring the third worker would reduce Apple’s profits by $160. Therefore, 
Apple will maximize profits by hiring 2 workers.

C H A P T E R  1 7  The Markets for Labor and Other Factors of Production
show by a shift of the demand curve. The following are the five most important vari-
ables that cause the labor demand curve to shift:
 1. Increases in human capital. Human capital represents the accumulated training and 
skills that workers possess. For example, a worker with a college education generally has 
more skills and is more productive than a worker who has only a high school diploma. If 
workers become more educated and are therefore able to produce more output per day, 
the demand for their services will increase, shifting the labor demand curve to the right.
 2. Changes in technology. As new and better machinery and equipment are developed, 
workers become more productive. This effect causes the labor demand curve to shift 
to the right over time.
 3. Changes in the price of the product. The marginal revenue product of labor depends 
on the price a firm receives for its output. A higher price increases the marginal rev-
enue product and shifts the labor demand curve to the right. A lower price shifts the 
labor demand curve to the left.
 4. Changes in the quantity of other inputs. Workers are able to produce more if they 
have more machinery and other inputs available to them. The marginal product of 
labor in the United States is higher than the marginal product of labor in most other 
countries in large part because U.S. firms provide workers with more machinery and 
equipment. Over time, workers in the United States have had increasing amounts of 
other inputs available to them, and that has increased their productivity and caused 
the demand for labor to shift to the right.
 5. Changes in the number of firms in the market. If new firms enter the market, the 
demand for labor will shift to the right. If firms exit the market, the demand for la-
bor will shift to the left. This effect is similar to the effect that increasing or decreas-
ing the number of consumers in a market has on the demand for a good.
The Supply of Labor
Having discussed the demand for labor, we can now consider the supply of labor. Of 
the many trade-offs each of us faces in life, one of the most important is how to divide 
up the 24 hours in a day between labor and leisure. Every hour spent posting to Face-
book, walking on the beach, or in other forms of leisure is one hour less spent working. 
Because in devoting an hour to leisure we give up an hour’s earnings from working, the 
opportunity cost of leisure is the wage. The higher the wage we could earn working, the 
higher the opportunity cost of leisure. Therefore, as the wage increases, we tend to take 
less leisure and work more. This relationship explains why the labor supply curve for 
most people is upward sloping, as Figure 17.2 shows.
Human capital The accumulated 
training and skills that workers 
possess.
17.2 LEARNING OBJECTIVE
Explain how people choose 
the quantity of labor to supply.
Figure 17.2 
The Labor Supply Curve
As the wage increases, the opportunity cost 
of leisure increases, causing individuals to 
supply a greater quantity of labor. Therefore, 
the labor supply curve is upward sloping.

The Supply of Labor 
551
Although we normally expect the labor supply curve for an individual to be up-
ward sloping, it is possible that at very high wage levels, the labor supply curve of an 
individual might be backward bending, so that higher wages actually result in a smaller 
quantity of labor supplied, as shown in Figure 17.3. To understand why, recall the defi-
nitions of the substitution effect and the income effect, which we introduced in Chapter 3 
and discussed more fully in Chapter 10. The substitution effect of a price change refers 
to the fact that an increase in price makes a good more expensive relative to other goods. 
In the case of a wage change, the substitution effect refers to the fact that an increase in 
the wage raises the opportunity cost of leisure and causes a worker to devote more time 
to working and less time to leisure.
The income effect of a price change refers to the change in the quantity demanded 
of a good that results from changes in consumer purchasing power as a result of a price 
change. An increase in the wage will clearly increase a consumer’s purchasing power 
for any given number of hours worked. For a normal good, the income effect leads to 
a larger quantity demanded. Because leisure is a normal good, the income effect of 
a wage increase will cause a worker to devote less time to working and more time to 
leisure. So, the substitution effect of a wage increase causes a worker to supply a larger 
quantity of labor, but the income effect causes a worker to supply a smaller quantity 
of labor. Whether a worker supplies more or less labor following a wage increase de-
pends on whether the substitution effect is larger than the income effect. Figure 17.3 
shows the typical case of the substitution effect being larger than the income effect 
at low levels of wages—so the worker supplies a larger quantity of labor as the wage 
rises—and the income effect being larger than the substitution effect at high levels  
of wages—so the worker supplies a smaller quantity of labor as the wage rises. For 
example, suppose an attorney has become quite successful and can charge clients very 
high fees. Or suppose a rock band has become very popular and receives a large pay-
ment for every concert it performs. In these cases, there is a high opportunity cost for 
the lawyer to turn down another client to take a longer vacation or for the band to 
turn down another concert. But because their incomes are already very high, they may 
decide to give up additional income for more leisure. For the lawyer or the rock band, 
the income effect is larger than the substitution effect, and a higher wage causes them 
to supply less labor.
The Market Supply Curve of Labor
We can determine the market supply curve of labor in the same way we determine a 
market supply curve of a good. We saw in Chapter 12 that the market supply curve of a 
good is determined by adding up the quantity of the good supplied by each firm at each 
Figure 17.3 
A Backward-Bending Labor 
Supply Curve
As the wage rises, a greater quantity of la-
bor is usually supplied. As the wage climbs 
above a certain level, the individual is able 
to afford more leisure even though the op-
portunity cost of leisure is high. The result 
may be a smaller quantity of labor supplied.

price. Similarly, the market supply curve of labor is determined by adding up the quan-
tity of labor supplied by each worker at each wage, holding constant all other variables 
that might affect the willingness of workers to supply labor.
Factors That Shift the Market Supply Curve  
of Labor
In constructing the market supply curve of labor, we hold constant all other variables that 
would affect the willingness of workers to supply labor, except the wage. If any of these 
other variables change, the market supply curve will shift. The following are the three 
most important variables that cause the market supply curve of labor to shift:
 1. Increasing population. As the population grows due to the number of births exceed-
ing the number of deaths and due to immigration, the supply curve of labor shifts to 
the right. The effects of immigration on labor supply are largest in the markets for 
unskilled workers. In some large cities in the United States, for example, the majority 
of taxi drivers and workers in hotels and restaurants are immigrants. Some support-
ers of reducing immigration argue that wages in these jobs have been depressed by 
the increased supply of labor from immigrants.
 2. Changing demographics. Demographics refers to the composition of the population. 
The more people who are between the ages of 16 and 65, the greater the quantity of 
labor supplied. During the 1970s and 1980s, the U.S. labor force grew particularly 
rapidly as members of the Baby Boom generation—born between 1946 and 1964—
first began working. In contrast, a low birthrate in Japan has resulted in an aging 
population. The number of working-age people in Japan actually began to decline 
during the 1990s, causing the labor supply curve to shift to the left.
A related demographic issue is the changing role of women in the labor force. 
In 1900, only 21 percent of women in the United States were in the labor force. By 
1950, this figure had risen to 30 percent, and today it is 60 percent. This increase in 
the labor force participation of women has significantly increased the supply of labor 
in the United States.
 3. Changing alternatives. The labor supply in any particular labor market depends, 
in part, on the opportunities available in other labor markets. For example, the 
problems in the financial services industry that began in 2007 reduced the oppor-
tunities for investment bankers, stockbrokers, and other financial workers. Many 
workers left this industry—causing the labor supply curve to shift to the left—and 
entered other markets, causing the labor supply curves to shift to the right in those 
markets. People who have lost jobs or who have low incomes are eligible for un-
employment insurance and other payments from the government. The more gen-
erous these payments are, the less pressure unemployed workers have to quickly 
find another job. In many European countries, it is much easier than in the United 
States for unemployed workers to receive a greater replacement of their wage in-
come from government payments. Many economists believe generous unemploy-
ment benefits help explain the higher unemployment rates experienced in some 
European countries.
Equilibrium in the Labor Market
In Figure 17.4, we bring together labor demand and labor supply to determine equi-
librium in the labor market. We can use demand and supply to analyze changes in the 
equilibrium wage and the level of employment for the entire labor market, and we can 
also use it to analyze markets for different types of labor, such as baseball players or col-
lege professors.

The Effect on Equilibrium Wages of a Shift

In many labor markets, increases over time in labor productivity will cause the demand 
for labor to increase. As Figure 17.5 shows, if labor supply is unchanged, an increase 
in labor demand will increase both the equilibrium wage and the number of workers 
employed.

Most people realize the value of a college education. As the

Data from U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, “Usual Weekly Earnings of Wage and Salary Workers,” July 19, 2011.  
Why do college graduates earn more than others? The obvious answer would seem 
to be that a college education provides skills that increase productivity. Some econo-
mists, though, advocate an alternative explanation, known as the signaling hypothesis, 
first proposed by Nobel Laureate A. Michael Spence of New York University. This hy-
pothesis is based on the idea that job applicants will always have more information than 
will potential employers about how productive the applicants are likely to be. Although 
employers attempt through job interviews and background checks to distinguish “good 
workers” from “bad workers,” they are always looking for more information.
According to the signaling hypothesis, employers see a college education as a sig-
nal that workers possess certain desirable characteristics: self-discipline, the ability to 
meet deadlines, and the ability to make a sustained effort. Employers value these char-
acteristics because they usually lead to success in any activity. People generally believe 
that college graduates possess these characteristics, so employers often require a college 
degree for their best-paying jobs. In this view, the signal that a college education sends 
about a person’s inherent characteristics—which the person presumably already pos-
sessed before entering college—is much more important than any skills the person may 
have learned in college. Or, as a college math professor of one of the authors put it (only 
half-jokingly): “The purpose of college is to show employers that you can succeed at 
something that’s boring and hard.”
Recently, though, several economic studies have provided evidence that the higher 
incomes of college graduates are due to their greater productivity rather than the signal 
that a college degree sends to employers. Orley Ashenfelter and Cecilia Rouse of Prince-
ton University studied the relationship between schooling and income among 700 pairs 
of identical twins. Identical twins have identical genes, so differences in their inherent 
abilities should be relatively small. Therefore, if they have different numbers of years 
in school, differences in their earnings should be mainly due to the effect of schooling 
on their productivity. Ashenfelter and Rouse found that identical twins had returns of 
about 9 percent per additional year of schooling, enough to account for most of the gap 
in income between high school graduates and college graduates.
Daniel Hamermesh and Stephen G. Donald of the University of Texas studied the 
determinants of the earnings of college graduates 5 to 25 years after graduation. They 
collected extensive information on each person in their study, including the person’s 
SAT scores, rank in high school graduating class, grades in every college course taken,

The Effect on Equilibrium Wages of a Shift 
in Labor Supply
What is the effect on the equilibrium wage of an increase in labor supply due to pop-
ulation growth? As Figure 17.6 shows, if labor demand is unchanged, an increase in 
labor supply will decrease the equilibrium wage but increase the number of workers 
employed.
Whether the wage rises in a market depends on whether demand increases faster than 
supply. For example, as Facebook, Twitter, Zynga, and other social networking sites became 
increasingly popular, the demand for software engineers in California’s Silicon Valley be-
gan to increase faster than the supply of new engineers graduating from college. By 2011, 
starting salaries for new graduates had increased from about $80,000 in 2009 to as much as 
$150,000. To keep their engineers from jumping to other employers, Google, Tagged, and 
other firms had to give their existing employees across-the-board raises. Start-up firms 
found that the salaries they needed to pay were raising their costs to levels that made it dif-
ficult to compete. If these escalating salaries lead more students to graduate with degrees 
in software engineering, the increased labor supply could eventually bring down salaries.
and college major. Hamermesh and Donald discovered that, holding constant all other 
factors, business and engineering majors earned more than graduates with other majors. 
They also discovered that taking science and math courses has a large effect on future 
earnings: “A student who takes 15 credits of upper-division science and math courses 
and obtains a B average in them will earn about 10% more than an otherwise identical 
student in the same major . . . who takes no upper-division classes in these areas.” This 
result held even after adjusting for a student’s SAT score. The study by Hamermesh and 
Donald contradicts the signaling hypothesis because if that hypothesis is correct, the 
choice of courses taken in college should be of minor importance compared with the 
signal workers send to employers just by having completed college.

C H A P T E R  1 7  The Markets for Labor and Other Factors of Production
Explaining Differences in Wages
A key conclusion of our discussion of the labor market is that the equilibrium wage 
equals the marginal revenue product of labor. The more productive workers are and the 
higher the price for which workers’ output can be sold, the higher the wages workers  
will receive. At the beginning of the chapter, we raised the question of why Major League 
Baseball players are paid so much more than most other workers. We are now ready to 
use demand and supply analysis to answer this question. Figure 17.7 shows the demand 
and supply curves for Major League Baseball players and the demand and supply curves 
for college professors.
Consider the marginal revenue product of baseball players, which is the additional 
revenue a team owner will receive from hiring one more player. Baseball players are 
hired to produce baseball games that are then sold to fans who pay admission to base-
ball stadiums and to radio and television stations that broadcast the games. Because a 
Major League Baseball team can sell each baseball game for a large amount, the mar-
ginal revenue product of baseball players is high. The supply of people with the ability to 
play Major League Baseball is also very limited. As a result, the average annual salary of 
the 750 Major League Baseball players was $3,305,000 in 2011.
The marginal revenue product of college professors is much lower than for base-
ball players. College professors are hired to produce college educations that are sold to 
students and their parents. Although one year’s college tuition is quite high at many col-
leges, hiring one more professor allows a college to admit at most a few more students. 
So, the marginal revenue product of a college professor is much lower than the marginal 
revenue product of a baseball player. There are also many more people who possess 
the skills to be a college professor than possess the skills to be a Major League Baseball 
player. As a result, the average annual salary of the country’s 1.5 million college profes-
sors was about $84,000 in 2011.
This still leaves unanswered the question raised at the beginning of this chapter: 
Why are the Boston Red Sox willing to pay Adrian Gonzalez more than the San Diego 
Padres, his previous team, were? Gonzlez’s marginal product—which we can think of as 
the extra games a team will win by employing him—should be about the same in Boston 
as in San Diego. But his marginal revenue product will be higher in Boston. Because the

Remember That Prices and Wages  
Are Determined at the Margin
You have probably heard some variation of the following 
remark: “We could live without baseball, but we can’t live 
without the garbage being hauled away. In a more rational 
world, garbage collectors would be paid more than base-
ball players.” This remark seems logical: The total value 
to society of having the garbage hauled away certainly is 
greater than the total value of baseball games. But wages—
like prices—do not depend on total value but on marginal 
value. The additional baseball games the Boston Red Sox 
expect to win by signing Adrian Gonzalez will result in 
millions of dollars in increased revenue. The supply of 
people with the ability to play Major League Baseball is 
very limited. The supply of people with the ability to be 
trash haulers is much greater. If a trash-hauling firm hires 
another worker, the additional trash-hauling services it 
can now offer will bring in a relatively small amount of 
revenue. The total value of baseball games and the total 
value of trash hauling are not relevant in determining the 
relative salaries of baseball players and garbage collectors.
This point is related to the diamond and water paradox 
first noted by Adam Smith. On the one hand, water is very 
valuable—we literally couldn’t live without it—but its price 
is very low. On the other hand, apart from a few industrial 
purposes, diamonds are used only for jewelry, yet their 
prices are quite high. We resolve the paradox by noting that 
the price of water is low because the supply is very large and 
the additional benefit consumers receive from the last gal-
lon purchased is low. The price of diamonds is high because 
the supply is very small, and the additional benefit consum-
ers receive from the last diamond purchased is high.

Red Sox have fans throughout the New England states, the number of their fans is much 
greater than the number of San Diego fans, so winning additional games will result in 
a greater increase in attendance at Boston Red Sox games than it would at San Diego 
Padres games. It will also result in a greater increase in viewers for Red Sox games on 
television. Therefore, the Red Sox are able to sell the extra wins that Gonzalez produces 
for much more than the Padres can. This difference explains why the Red Sox were will-
ing to pay Gonzalez so much more than the Padres were willing to pay him.
Technology and the Earnings  
of “Superstars”
The gap between Adrian Gonzalez’s salary and the salary of 
the lowest-paid baseball players is much greater than the gap 
between the salaries paid during the 1950s and 1960s to top players such as Mickey 
Mantle and Willie Mays and the salaries of the lowest-paid players. Similarly, the gap 
between the $15 million Angelina Jolie is paid to star in a movie and the salary paid to 
an actor in a minor role is much greater than the gap between the salaries paid during 
the 1930s and 1940s to stars such as Clark Gable and Cary Grant and the salaries paid 
to bit players. In fact, in most areas of sports and entertainment, the highest-paid per-
formers—the “superstars”—now have much higher incomes relative to other members 
of their professions than was true a few decades ago.
The increase in the relative incomes of superstars is mainly due to technological 
advances. The spread of cable television has increased the number of potential viewers 
of Red Sox games, but many of those viewers will watch only if the Red Sox are win-
ning. This increases the value to the Red Sox of winning games and, therefore, increases 
 Gonzalez’s marginal revenue product and the salary he can earn.
With Blu-ray discs, DVDs, Internet streaming video, and pay-per-view cable, the 
value to movie studios of producing a hit movie has risen greatly. Not surprisingly, 
movie studios have also increased their willingness to pay large salaries to stars such as 
Angelina Jolie and Will Smith because they think these superstars will significantly raise 
the chances that a film will be successful.
This process has been going on for a long time. For instance, before the invention 
of the motion picture, anyone who wanted to see a play had to attend the theater and

C H A P T E R  1 7  The Markets for Labor and Other Factors of Production
Differences in marginal revenue products are the most important factor in explain-
ing differences in wages, but they are not the whole story. To provide a more complete 
explanation for differences in wages, we must take into account three important aspects 
of labor markets: compensating differentials, discrimination, and labor unions. We begin  
with compensating differentials.
Compensating Differentials
Suppose Paul runs a pizza parlor and acquires a reputation for being a bad boss who 
yells at his workers and is generally unpleasant. Two blocks away, Brendan also runs a 
pizza parlor, but Brendan is always very polite to his workers. We would expect in these 
circumstances that Paul will have to pay a higher wage than Brendan to attract and re-
tain workers. Higher wages that compensate workers for unpleasant aspects of a job are 
called compensating differentials.
If working in a dynamite factory requires the same degree of training and education 
as working in a semiconductor factory but is much more dangerous, a larger number of 
workers will want to work making semiconductors than will want to work making dy-
namite. As a consequence, the wages of dynamite workers will be higher than the wages 
of semiconductor workers. We can think of the difference in wages as being the price of 
risk. As each worker decides on his or her willingness to assume risk and decides how 
much higher the wage must be to compensate for assuming more risk, wages will adjust 
so that dynamite factories will end up paying wages that are just high enough to com-
pensate workers who choose to work there for the extra risk they assume. Only when 
workers in dynamite factories have been fully compensated with higher wages for the 
additional risk they assume will dynamite companies be able to attract enough workers.
One surprising implication of compensating differentials is that laws protecting the 
health and safety of workers may not make workers better off. To see this, suppose that 
dynamite factories pay wages of $25 per hour, and semiconductor factories pay wages of 
$20 per hour, with the $5 difference in wages being a compensating differential for the 
greater risk of working in a dynamite factory. Suppose that the government passes a law 
regulating the manufacture of dynamite in order to improve safety in dynamite factories. 
As a result of this law, dynamite factories are no longer any more dangerous than semi-
conductor factories. Once this happens, the wages in dynamite factories will decline to 
$20 per hour, the same as in semiconductor factories. Are workers in dynamite factories 
any better or worse off? Before the law was passed, their wages were $25 per hour, but $5 
per hour was a compensating differential for the extra risk they were exposed to. Now 
their wages are only $20 per hour, but the extra risk has been eliminated. The conclusion 
seems to be that dynamite workers are no better off as a result of the safety legislation.
This conclusion is true, though, only if the compensating differential actually does 
compensate workers fully for the additional risk. Nobel Laureate George Akerlof of the 
University of California, Berkeley, and William Dickens of the Brookings Institution have 
argued that the psychological principle known as cognitive dissonance might cause workers 
to underestimate the true risk of their jobs. According to this principle, people prefer 
to think of themselves as intelligent and rational and tend to reject evidence that seems 
to contradict this image. Because working in a very hazardous job may seem irrational,

see a live performance. Limits on the number of people who could see the best actors 
and actresses perform created an opportunity for many more people to succeed in the 
acting profession, and the gap between the salaries earned by the best actors and the 
salaries earned by average actors was relatively small. Today, when a hit movie starring 
Angelina Jolie is available on DVD or for downloading, millions of people will buy or 
rent it, and they will not be forced to spend money to see a lesser actress, as their great-
great- grandparents might have been.

workers in such jobs may refuse to believe that the jobs really are hazardous. Akerlof 
and Dickens present evidence that workers in chemical plants producing benzene and 
workers in nuclear power plants underestimate the hazards of their jobs. If this is true, 
the wages of these workers will not be high enough to compensate them fully for the risk 
they have assumed. So, in this situation, safety legislation may make workers better off.
Are U.S. Firms Handicapped  
by Paying for Their Employees’  
Health Insurance?
When choosing among jobs, workers 
consider all aspects of each job. This includes how hazardous or 
otherwise unpleasant a job may be. It also includes the total com-
pensation received from a job. To this point, we have assumed that 
compensation takes the form of wages. But many jobs also pay 
fringe benefits, such as employer contributions to retirement ac-
counts or employer-provided health insurance.
So, it would be more accurate to describe the intersection of the 
labor demand and labor supply curves as determining the equilib-
rium compensation rather than the equilibrium wage. If the demand 
for, say, software engineers increases, the equilibrium compensation 
will increase. This increase in compensation could be partly an in-
crease in wages and partly an increase in employer contributions to 
retirement accounts or to health insurance plans.
In many countries, the government either supplies health care directly by operating 
hospitals and employing doctors, or it pays for most health care expenses even if hos-
pitals are not government owned and doctors are not government employees. By con-
trast, in the United States about two-thirds of the population is covered by private health 
insurance, most of which is provided by employers. As a result, at many firms in the 
United States, a significant portion of the compensation workers receive is in the form 
of employer payments for health insurance. Does paying for health insurance put U.S. 
firms at a disadvantage in competing with foreign firms that do not have this expense 
because their workers receive government-provided health care?
Some policymakers have argued that the bankruptcies of Chrysler and General Mo-
tors in 2009 were due, in part, to their making large payments for their workers’ health 
insurance that their foreign competitors did not have to make. Some supporters of Presi-
dent Barack Obama’s proposals to expand the government’s role in providing health care 
have also argued that relieving U.S. firms from paying for health care would lower their 
costs relative to foreign competitors. But if labor markets determine equilibrium com-
pensation, then a reduction in employer contributions for health insurance should lead to 
an offsetting increase in wages, leaving the total compensation paid by firms unaffected.
The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) undertakes studies of policy issues for 
Congress. In an overview of proposals for reforming health insurance in the United 
States, the CBO addressed this question:
Some observers have asserted that domestic producers that provide health insur-
ance to their workers face higher costs for compensation than competitors based 
in countries where insurance is not employment based and that fundamental 
changes to the health insurance system could reduce or eliminate that disadvan-
tage. However, such a cost reduction is unlikely to occur. . . . The equilibrium level 
of overall compensation in the economy is determined by the supply of and the 
demand for labor. Fringe benefits (such as health insurance) are just part of that 
compensation. Consequently, the costs of fringe benefits are borne by workers  
largely in the form of lower cash wages than they would receive if no such benefits 
were provided by their employer. Replacing employment-based health care with 
a government-run system could reduce employers’ payments for their workers’

C H A P T E R  1 7  The Markets for Labor and Other Factors of Production
Discrimination
Table 17.2 shows that in the United States, white males on average earn more than other 
groups. One possible explanation for this is economic discrimination, which involves 
paying a person a lower wage or excluding a person from an occupation on the basis of 
an irrelevant characteristic such as race or gender.
If employers discriminated by hiring only white males for high-paying jobs or by 
paying white males higher wages than other groups working the same jobs, white males 
would have higher earnings, as Table 17.2 shows. However, excluding groups from cer-
tain jobs or paying one group more than another has been illegal in the United States 
since the passage of the Equal Pay Act of 1963 and the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Nev-
ertheless, it is possible that employers are ignoring the law and practicing economic 
discrimination.
Most economists believe that only part of the gap between the wages of white males 
and the wages of other groups is due to discrimination. Instead, some of the gap is ex-
plained by three main factors:
 1. Differences in education
 2. Differences in experience
 3. Differing preferences for jobs
Differences in Education Some of the difference between the incomes of white 
workers and the incomes of black workers can be explained by differences in education. 
Historically, African Americans have had less schooling than white people. Although 
the gap has closed significantly over the years, 90 percent of adult non-Hispanic white 
males in 2010 had graduated from high school, but only 82 percent of adult African-
American males had. Thirty-one percent of white males had graduated from college, 
but only 16 percent of African-American males had. These statistics understate the true 
gap in education between black and white people because many black people receive a 
substandard education in inner-city schools. Not surprisingly, studies have shown that 
differing levels of education can account for a significant part of the gap between the

insurance, but the amount that they would have to pay in overall compensation 
would remain essentially unchanged.
This is another case where basic demand and supply analysis provides important 
insights into a policy issue.

earnings of white and black males. Some of the difference in educational levels between 
black and white people may itself reflect past and current discrimination by govern-
ments in failing to provide equal educational opportunities.
Differences in Experience Women are much more likely than men to leave their 
jobs for a period of time after having a child. Women with several children will some-
times have several interruptions in their careers. Some women leave the workforce for 
several years until their children are of school age. As a result, on average, women with 
children have less workforce experience than do men of the same age. Because work-
ers with greater experience are, on average, more productive, the difference in levels 
of experience helps to explain some of the difference in earnings between men and 
women. Providing some support for this explanation is the fact that, on average, mar-
ried women earn about 25 percent less than married men, but women who have never 
been  married—and whose careers are less likely to have been interrupted—earn only 
about 9 percent less than men who have never been married.
Differing Preferences for Jobs Significant differences exist between the types of 
jobs held by women and men. Women represent 90 percent or more of the people em-
ployed in some relatively low-paying jobs, such as preschool teachers, dental assistants, 
and childcare workers, while men represent more than 90 percent of the people em-
ployed in some relatively high-paying jobs, such as airline pilots, engineering manag-
ers, and electricians. Although the overrepresentation of women in low-paying jobs and 
men in high-paying jobs may be due in part to discrimination, it is also likely to reflect 
differences in job preferences between men and women. For example, because many 
women interrupt their careers—at least briefly—when their children are born, they are 
more likely to take jobs where work experience is less important. Women may also be 
more likely to take jobs, such as teaching, that allow them to be home in the afternoons 
when their children return from school.
Solving the Problem
Step 1: Review the chapter material. This problem is about economic discrimina-
tion, so you may want to review the section “Discrimination,” which begins 
on page 560.
Solved Problem 17.4
Is Passing “Comparable Worth” Legislation a Good Way  
to Close the Gap between Men’s and Women’s Pay?
As we have seen, either because of discrimination or dif-
fering preferences, certain jobs are filled primarily by men, 
and other jobs are filled primarily by women. On aver-
age, the “men’s jobs” have higher wages than the “women’s 
jobs.” Some observers have argued that many “men’s jobs” 
are more highly paid than “women’s jobs,” despite the jobs 
being comparable in terms of the education and skills re-
quired and the working conditions involved. These observ-
ers have argued that the earnings gap between men and 
women could be closed at least partially if the government 
required employers to pay the same wages for jobs that have 
comparable worth. Many economists are skeptical of these 
proposals because they believe allowing markets to deter-
mine wages results in a more efficient outcome.
Suppose that electricians are currently being paid a mar-
ket equilibrium wage of $800 per week, and dental assis-
tants are being paid a market equilibrium wage of $500 per 
week. Comparable-worth legislation is passed, and a study 
finds that an electrician and a dental assistant have compa-
rable jobs, so employers will now be required to pay work-
ers in both jobs $650 per week. Analyze the effects of this 
requirement on the market for electricians and on the mar-
ket for dental assistants. Be sure to use demand and supply 
graphs.

C H A P T E R  1 7  The Markets for Labor and Other Factors of Production
The Difficulty of Measuring Discrimination When two people are paid dif-
ferent wages, discrimination may be the explanation. But differences in productivity or 
preferences may also be an explanation. Labor economists have attempted to measure 
what part of differences in wages between black workers and white workers and be-
tween men and women is due to discrimination and what part is due to other factors. 
Unfortunately, it is difficult to precisely measure differences in productivity or in worker 
preferences. As a result, we can’t know exactly the extent of economic discrimination in 
the United States today.
Step 2: Draw the graphs. We saw in Chapter 4 that when the government sets the 
price in a market, the result is a surplus or a shortage, depending on whether 
the government-mandated price is above or below the competitive market 
equilibrium. A wage of $650 per week is below the market wage for electri-
cians and above the market wage for dental assistants. Therefore, we expect 
the requirement to result in a shortage of electricians and a surplus of dental 
assistants.
In panel (a), without comparable-worth legislation, the equilibrium 
wage for electricians is $800, and the equilibrium quantity of electricians 
hired is L1. Setting the wage for electricians below equilibrium at $650 re-
duces the quantity of labor supplied in this occupation from L1 to L2 but 
increases the quantity of labor demanded by employers from L1 to L3. The 
result is a shortage of electricians equal to L3 2 L2, as shown by the bracket 
in the graph.
In panel (b), without comparable-worth legislation, the equilibrium wage 
for dental assistants is $500, and the equilibrium quantity of dental assistants 
hired is L1. Setting the wage for dental assistants above equilibrium at $650 
increases the quantity of labor supplied in this occupation from L1 to L3 but 
reduces the quantity of labor demanded by employers from L1 to L2. The re-
sult is a surplus of dental assistants equal to L3 2 L2, as shown by the bracket 
in the graph.
Extra Credit: Most economists are skeptical of government attempts to set wages and 
prices, as comparable-worth legislation would require. Supporters of  comparable-worth 
legislation, by contrast, see differences between men’s and women’s wages as being 
mainly due to discrimination and are looking to government legislation as a solution.

Does It Pay to Discriminate? Many economists believe that in the long run, mar-
kets can undermine economic discrimination. One reason is that employers who dis-
criminate pay an economic penalty. To see why this is true, let’s consider a simplified 
example. Suppose that men and women are equally qualified to be airline pilots and 
that, initially, airlines do not discriminate. In Figure 17.8, we divide the airlines into two 
groups: “A” airlines and “B” airlines. If neither group of airlines discriminates, we would 
expect them to pay an equal wage of $1,100 per week to both men and women pilots. 
Now suppose that “A” airlines decide to discriminate and to fire all their women pilots. 
This action will reduce the supply of pilots to these airlines and, as shown in panel (a), 
that will force up the wage from $1,100 to $1,300. At the same time, as women fired 
from the jobs with “A” airlines apply for jobs with “B” airlines, the supply of pilots to 
“B” airlines will increase, and the equilibrium wage will fall from $1,100 to $900. All the 
women pilots will end up being employed at the nondiscriminating airlines and will be 
paid a lower wage than the men who are employed by the discriminating airlines.
But this situation cannot persist for two reasons. First, male pilots employed by “B” 
airlines will also receive the lower wage. This lower wage gives them an incentive to 
quit their jobs at “B” airlines and apply at “A” airlines, which will shift the labor supply 
Does Greg Have an Easier Time

One difficulty in accurately measuring economic discrimina-
tion is that two workers may not only differ in race and gender 
but also in characteristics that employers expect will affect the workers’ productivity. If 
Worker A is hired instead of Worker B, is it because A is a white male, while B is a black 
female, or is it because of A’s and B’s other characteristics?
Marianne Bertrand of the University of Chicago and Sendhil Mullainathan of MIT 
found an ingenious way of getting around this difficulty. They responded to help wanted 
ads in newspapers by sending identical resumes, with the exception that half of the re-
sumes were assigned an African-American–sounding name and half were assigned 
a white-sounding name. In other words, the characteristics of these fictitious people 
were the same, except for their names. In the absence of discrimination, resumes with 
 African-American–sounding names, such as Jamal Jones, should have been as likely to 
get job interviews as the identical resumes with white-sounding names, such as Greg 
Baker. In fact, though, employers were 50 percent more likely to interview workers with 
white-sounding names than workers with African-American–sounding names.  Bertrand 
and Mullainthan sent out more than 5,000 resumes to many different  employers who 
were advertising for jobs in sales, administrative support, clerical services, and customer 
services. Their results were similar across these different types of jobs.
Some economists have questioned whether the study by Bertrand and  Mullainathan, 
as well as other similar studies, actually do show that employers discriminate. They ar-
gue that employers may believe that the typical white job applicant and the typical black 
job applicant have different characteristics, apart from those included in the resumes, 
that may affect their productivity. If so, the employers may be responding to these dif-
ferences in productivity rather than solely to the job applicant’s race. Because Bertrand 
and  Mullainthan based their artificial resumes on actual resumes, however, the artifi-
cial  resumes probably include all the characteristics that actual job applicants think are 
relevant.  Bertrand and  Mullainathan believe that the results of their experiment show that 
“differential treatment by race . . . appears to still be prominent in the U.S. labor market.”

curve for “B” airlines to the left and the labor supply curve for “A” airlines to the right. 
Second, “A” airlines are paying $1,300 per week to hire pilots who are no more produc-
tive than the pilots being paid $900 per week by “B” airlines. As a result, “B” airlines will 
have lower costs and will be able to charge lower prices. Eventually, “A” airlines will lose 
their customers to “B” airlines and will be driven out of business. The market will have 
imposed an economic penalty on the discriminating airlines. So, discrimination will not 
persist, and the wages of men and women pilots will become equal.
Can we conclude from this analysis that competition in markets will eliminate all 
economic discrimination? Unfortunately, this optimistic conclusion is not completely 
accurate. We know that until the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed, many firms in the 
United States refused to hire black workers. Even though this practice had persisted for 
decades, nondiscriminating competitors did not drive these firms out of business. Why 
not? There were three important factors:
 1. Worker discrimination. In some cases, white workers refused to work alongside 
black workers. As a result, some industries—such as the important cotton textile 
industry in the South—were all white. Because of discrimination by white workers, 
an entrepreneur who wanted to use low-cost black labor might need to hire an all-
black workforce. Some entrepreneurs tried this, but because black workers had been 
excluded from these industries, they often lacked the skills and experience to form 
an effective workforce.
 2. Customer discrimination. Some white consumers were unwilling to buy from com-
panies in certain industries if they employed black workers. This was not a signifi-
cant barrier in manufacturing industries, where customers would not know the race 
of the workers producing the good. It was, however, a problem for firms in indus-
tries in which workers came into direct contact with the public.
 3. Negative feedback loops. Our analysis in Figure 17.8 assumed that men and women 
pilots were equally qualified. However, if discrimination makes it difficult for a 
member of a group to find employment in a particular occupation, his or her in-
centive to be trained to enter that occupation is reduced. Consider the legal profes-
sion as an example. In 1952, future Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O’Connor 
graduated third in her class at Stanford University Law School and was an editor of

In this hypothetical example, we assume that initially neither “A” airlines nor “B” 
airlines discriminate. As a result, men and women pilots receive the same wage 
of $1,100 per week at both groups of airlines. We then assume that “A” airlines 
discriminate by firing all their women pilots. Panel (a) shows that this reduces 
the supply of pilots to “A” airlines and raises the wage paid by these airlines from 
$1,100 to $1,300. Panel (b) shows that this increases the supply of pilots to “B” 
airlines and lowers the wage paid by these airlines from $1,100 to $900. All the 
women pilots will end up being employed at the nondiscriminating airlines and 
will be paid a lower wage than the men who are employed by the discriminating 
airlines.

 
Explaining Differences in Wages 
565
the Stanford Law Review, but for some time she was unable to get a job as a lawyer 
because in those years, many law firms would not hire women. Facing such bleak 
job prospects, it’s not surprising that relatively few women entered law school. As 
a result, a law firm that did not discriminate would have been unable to act like the 
nondiscriminating airlines in our example by hiring women lawyers at a lower sal-
ary and using this cost advantage to drive discriminating law firms out of business. 
In this situation, an unfortunate feedback loop was in place: Few women prepared to 
become lawyers because many law firms discriminated against women, and nondis-
criminating law firms were unable to drive discriminating law firms out of business 
because there were too few women lawyers available.
Most economists agree that the market imposes an economic penalty on firms that 
discriminate, but because of the factors just discussed, it may take the market a very 
long time to eliminate discrimination entirely. The passage of the Civil Rights Act of 
1964, which outlawed hiring discrimination on the basis of race and sex, greatly sped up 
the process of reducing economic discrimination in the United States.
Labor Unions
Workers’ wages can differ depending on whether the workers are members of labor 
unions. Labor unions are organizations of employees that have the legal right to bar-
gain with employers about wages and working conditions. If a union is unable to reach 
an agreement with a company, it has the legal right to call a strike, which means its 
members refuse to work until a satisfactory agreement has been reached. As Figure 17.9 
shows, a smaller fraction of the U.S. labor force is unionized than in most other high-
income countries.
As Table 17.3 shows, in the United States, workers who are in unions receive 
higher wages than workers who are not in unions. Do union members earn more 
than nonunion members because they are in unions? The answer might seem to be 
“yes,” but many union workers are in industries, such as automobile manufacturing, 
in which their marginal revenue products are high, so their wages would be high even 
if they were not unionized. Economists who have attempted to estimate statistically 
the effect of unionization on wages have concluded that being in a union increases a 
worker’s wages about 10 percent, holding constant other factors, such as the indus-
try the worker is in. A related question is whether unions raise the total amount of 
wages received by all workers, whether unionized or not. Because the share of na-
tional income received by workers has remained roughly constant over many years, 
most economists do not believe that unions have raised the total amount of wages 
received by workers.

C H A P T E R  1 7  The Markets for Labor and Other Factors of Production
Personnel Economics
Traditionally, labor economists have focused on issues such as the effects of labor unions 
on wages or the determinants of changes in average wages over time. They have spent 
less time analyzing human resources issues, which address how firms hire, train, and pro-
mote workers and set their wages and benefits. In recent years, some labor economists, 
including Edward Lazear of Stanford University and William Neilson of the University 
of Tennessee, have begun exploring the application of economic analysis to human re-
sources issues. This new focus has become known as personnel economics.
Personnel economics analyzes the link between differences among jobs and differ-
ences in the way workers are paid. Jobs have different skill requirements, require more 
or less interaction with other workers, have to be performed in more or less unpleasant 
environments, and so on. Firms need to design compensation policies that take into ac-
count these differences. Personnel economics also analyzes policies related to other hu-
man resources issues, such as promotions, training, and pensions. In this brief overview, 
we look only at compensation policies.
Should Workers’ Pay Depend on How Much They Work 
or on How Much They Produce?
One issue personnel economics addresses is when workers should receive straight-time 
pay—a certain wage per hour or salary per week or month—and when they should re-
ceive commission or piece-rate pay—a wage based on how much output they produce.
Suppose, for example, that Anne owns a car dealership and is trying to decide 
whether to pay her salespeople a salary of $800 per week or a commission of $200 on 
each car they sell. Figure 17.10 compares the compensation a salesperson would receive 
under the two systems, according to the number of cars the salesperson sells.

With a straight salary, she receives $800 per

This outcome is shown by the horizontal line

be better off with the $800 salary. If she sells 
more than 4 cars per week, she would be bet-
ter off with the $200-per-car commission.

With a straight salary, the salesperson receives $800 per week, no matter how many 
cars she sells. This outcome is shown by the horizontal line in Figure 17.10. If she re-
ceives a commission of $200 per car, her compensation will increase with every car she 
sells. This outcome is shown by the upward-sloping line. A salesperson who sells fewer 
than 4 cars per week would earn more by receiving a straight salary of $800 per week. 
A salesperson who sells more than 4 cars per week would be better off receiving the 
$200-per-car commission. We can identify two advantages Anne would receive from 
paying her salespeople commissions rather than salaries: She would attract and retain 
the most productive employees, and she would provide an incentive to her employees to 
sell more cars.
Suppose that other car dealerships are all paying salaries of $800 per week. If Anne 
pays her employees on commission, any of her employees who are unable to sell at least 
4 cars per week can improve their pay by going to work for one of her competitors. And 
any salespeople at Anne’s competitors who can sell more than 4 cars per week can raise 
their pay by quitting and coming to work for Anne. Over time, Anne will find her least 
productive employees leaving, while she is able to hire new employees who are more 
productive.
Paying a commission also increases the incentive Anne’s salespeople have to sell 
more cars. If Anne paid a salary, her employees would receive the same amount no 
matter how few cars they sold. An employee on salary might decide on a particularly 
hot or cold day that it was less trouble to stay inside the building than to go out on the 
car lot to greet potential customers. An employee on commission would know that the 
additional effort expended on selling more cars would be rewarded with additional 
compensation.
Raising Pay, Productivity, and Profits  
at Safelite AutoGlass
Safelite Group, headquartered in Columbus, Ohio, is the par-
ent company of Safelite AutoGlass, the nation’s largest installer 
of auto glass, with 600 repair shops. In the mid-1990s, Safelite shifted from paying its 
glass installers hourly wages to paying them on the basis of how many windows they 
installed. Safelite already had in place a computer system that allowed it to easily track 
how many windows each worker installed per day. To make sure quality did not suffer, 
Safelite added a rule that if a workmanship-related defect occurred with an installed 
windshield, the worker would have to install a new windshield and would not be paid 
for the additional work.
Edward Lazear analyzed data provided by the firm and discovered that under the 
new piece-rate system, the number of windows installed per worker jumped 44 per-
cent. Lazear estimated that half of this increase was due to increased productivity from 
workers who continued with the company and half was due to new hires being more 
productive than the workers they replaced who had left the company. Worker pay rose 
on average by about 9.9 percent. Ninety-two percent of workers experienced a pay in-
crease, and one-quarter received an increase of at least 28 percent. Safelite’s profits also 
increased as the cost to the company per window installed fell from $44.43 under the 
hourly wage system to $35.24 under the piece-rate system.
Sociologists sometimes question whether worker productivity can be increased 
through the use of monetary incentives. The experience of Safelite AutoGlass provides 
a clear example of workers reacting favorably to the opportunity to increase output in 
exchange for higher compensation.

Other Considerations in Setting Compensation 
Systems
The discussion so far indicates that companies will find it more profitable to use a com-
mission or piece-rate system of compensation rather than a salary system. In fact, many 
firms continue to pay their workers salaries, which means they are paying their workers 
on the basis of how long they work rather than on the basis of how much they produce. 
Firms may choose a salary system for several good reasons:
• 
Difficulty measuring output. Often it is difficult to attribute output to any partic-
ular worker. For example, projects carried out by an engineering firm may involve 
teams of workers whose individual contributions are difficult to distinguish. On as-
sembly lines, such as those used in the automobile industry, the amount produced 
by each worker is determined by the speed of the line, which is set by managers 
rather than by workers. Managers at many firms perform such a wide variety of 
tasks that measuring their output would be costly, if it could be done at all.
• 
Concerns about quality. If workers are paid on the basis of the number of units 
produced, they may become less concerned about quality. An office assistant who 
is paid on the basis of the quantity of letters typed may become careless about how 
many typos the letters contain. In some cases, there are ways around this problem; 
for example, the assistant may be required to correct the mistakes on his or her own 
time, without pay.
• 
Worker dislike of risk. Piece-rate or commission systems of compensation in-
crease the risk to workers because sometimes output declines for reasons not 
connected to the worker’s effort. For example, if there is a very snowy winter, few 
customers may show up at Anne’s auto dealership. Through no fault of their own, 
her salespeople may have great difficulty selling any cars. If they are paid a salary, 
their income will not be affected, but if they are on commission, their incomes may 
drop to low levels. The flip side of this is that by paying salaries, Anne assumes a 
greater risk. During a snowy winter, her payroll expenses will remain high even 
though her sales are low. With a commission system of compensation, her payroll 
expenses will decline along with her sales. But owners of firms are typically better 
able to bear risk than are workers. As a result, some firms may find that workers 
who would earn more under a commission system will prefer to receive a salary to 
reduce their risk. In these situations, paying a lower salary may reduce the firm’s 
payroll expenses compared with what they would have been under a commission or 
piece-rate system.
Personnel economics is a relatively new field, but it holds great potential for helping 
firms deal more efficiently with human resources issues.
The Markets for Capital 
and Natural Resources
The approach we have used to analyze the market for labor can also be used to analyze 
the markets for other factors of production. We have seen that the demand for labor is 
determined by the marginal revenue product of labor because the value to a firm from 
hiring another worker equals the increase in the firm’s revenue from selling the addi-
tional output it can produce by hiring the worker. The demand for capital and natural 
resources is determined in a similar way.
The Market for Capital
Physical capital includes machines, equipment, and buildings. Firms sometimes buy 
capital, but we will focus on situations in which firms rent capital. A chocolate manu-
facturer renting a warehouse and an airline leasing a plane are examples of firms renting 
17.6 LEARNING OBJECTIVE

are determined in the markets 
for capital and natural 
resources.

 
The Markets for Capital and Natural Resources  
569
capital. Like the demand for labor, the demand for capital is a derived demand. When a 
firm is considering increasing its capital by, for example, employing another machine, 
the value it receives equals the increase in the firm’s revenue from selling the additional 
output it can produce by employing the machine. The marginal revenue product of capi-
tal is the change in the firm’s revenue as a result of employing one more unit of capital, 
such as a machine. We have seen that the marginal revenue product of labor curve is the 
demand curve for labor. Similarly, the marginal revenue product of capital curve is the 
demand curve for capital.
Firms producing capital goods face increasing marginal costs, so the supply curve 
of capital goods is upward sloping, as are the supply curves for other goods and services. 
Figure 17.11 shows equilibrium in the market for capital. In equilibrium, suppliers of 
capital receive a rental price equal to the marginal revenue product of capital, just as 
suppliers of labor receive a wage equal to the marginal revenue product of labor.
The Market for Natural Resources
The market for natural resources can be analyzed in the same way as the markets for 
labor and capital. When a firm is considering employing more natural resources, the 
value it receives equals the increase in the firm’s revenue from selling the additional 
output it can produce by buying the natural resources. So, the demand for natural re-
sources is also a derived demand. The marginal revenue product of natural resources is 
the change in a firm’s revenue as a result of employing one more unit of natural re-
sources, such as a barrel of oil. The marginal revenue product of natural resources curve 
is also the demand curve for natural resources.
Although the total quantity of most natural resources is ultimately fixed—as the 
humorist Will Rogers once remarked, “Buy land. They ain’t making any more of it”—in 
many cases, the quantity supplied still responds to the price. For example, although the 
total quantity of oil deposits in the world is fixed, an increase in the price of oil will re-
sult in an increase in the quantity of oil supplied during a particular period. The result, 
as shown in panel (a) of Figure 17.12, is an upward-sloping supply curve. In some cases, 
however, the quantity of a natural resource that will be supplied is fixed and will not 
change as the price changes. The land available at a busy intersection is fixed, for exam-
ple. In panel (b) of Figure 17.12, we illustrate this situation with a supply curve that is a 
vertical line, or perfectly inelastic. The price received by a factor of production that is in 
fixed supply is called an economic rent (or a pure rent) because, in this case, the price 
of the factor is determined only by demand. For example, if a new highway diverts much 
of the traffic from a previously busy intersection, the demand for the land will decline, 
and the price of the land will fall, but the quantity of the land will not change.

C H A P T E R  1 7  The Markets for Labor and Other Factors of Production
Monopsony
In Chapter 15, we analyzed the case of monopoly, where a firm is the sole seller of a good 
or service. What happens if a firm is the sole buyer of a factor of production? This case, 
which is known as monopsony, is comparatively rare. An example is a firm in an iso-
lated town—perhaps a lumber mill in a small town in Washington or Oregon—that is 
the sole employer of labor in that location. In the nineteenth and early twentieth centu-
ries, some coal mining firms were the sole employers in certain small towns in West Vir-
ginia, and some pineapple plantations were the sole employers on certain small islands 
in Hawaii. In these cases, not only would the firm own the mill, mine, or plantation, but 
it would also own the stores and other businesses in the town. Workers would have the 
choice of working for the sole employer in the town or moving to another town.
We know that a firm with a monopoly in an output market takes advantage of its 
market power to reduce the quantity supplied to force up the market price and increase 
its profits. A firm that has a monopsony in a factor market would employ a similar strat-
egy: It would restrict the quantity of the factor demanded to force down the price of the 
factor and increase profits. A firm with a monopsony in a labor market will hire fewer 
workers and pay lower wages than would be the case in a competitive market. Because 
fewer workers are hired than would be hired in a competitive market, monopsony results 
in a deadweight loss. Monopoly and monopsony have similar effects on the economy: In 
both cases, a firm’s market power results in a lower equilibrium quantity, a deadweight 
loss, and a reduction in economic efficiency compared with a competitive market.
In some cases, monopsony in labor markets is offset by worker membership in a la-
bor union. A notable example of this is professional sports. For instance, Major League 
Baseball effectively has a monopsony on employing professional baseball players. (Al-
though independent baseball leagues exist, none of the best players play for these teams, 
and the teams pay salaries that are a small fraction of those paid by Major League Base-
ball teams.) The monopsony power of the owners of Major League Baseball teams is 
offset by the power of the Major League Baseball Players Association, the union that 
represents baseball players. Bargaining between the representatives of Major League 
Baseball and the players’ union has resulted in baseball players being paid something 
close to what they would be receiving in a competitive market.

Conclusion 
571
The Marginal Productivity Theory of Income 
Distribution
We have seen that in equilibrium, each factor of production receives a price equal 
to its marginal revenue product. We can use this fact to explain the distribution of 
income. Marginal revenue product represents the value of a factor’s marginal contri-
bution to producing goods and services. Therefore, individuals will receive income 
equal to the marginal contributions to production from the factors of production 
they own, including their labor. The more factors of production an individual owns 
and the more productive those factors are, the higher the individual’s income will 
be. This approach to explaining the distribution of income is called the marginal 
 productivity theory of income distribution. The theory was developed by John 
Bates Clark, who taught at Columbia University in the late nineteenth and early 
twentieth centuries.
Marginal productivity theory of 
income distribution The theory 
that the distribution of income 
is determined by the marginal 
productivity of the factors of 
production that individuals own.
Conclusion
In this chapter, we used the demand and supply model from Chapter 3 to explain why 
wages differ among workers. The demand for workers depends on their productivity 
and on the price firms receive for the output the workers produce. The supply of workers  
to an occupation depends on the wages and working conditions offered by employers 
and on the skills required. The demand and supply for labor can also help us analyze 
such issues as economic discrimination and the effect of labor unions.

How Can You Convince Your Boss to Give You a Raise?
At the beginning of the chapter, we asked you to imagine that you work at a local sandwich shop 
and that you plan to ask your manager for a raise. One way to show the manager your worth is 
to demonstrate how many dollars your work earns for the sandwich shop: your marginal revenue 
product. You could certainly suggest that as you have become better at your job and have gained 
new skills, you have become a more productive employee; but, more importantly, you could say 
that your productivity results in increased revenue for the sandwich shop. By showing how your 
employment contributes to higher revenue and profit, you may be able to convince your manager 
to give you a raise.

 “The general idea about how 
much a coach is worth is how much 
revenue did the program generate be-
fore and how much does it generate 
now,” Zimbalist said. “What happens 
in college basketball and football is that 
since players don’t get paid, the value 
they produce is attributed to the coach, 
and that’s why they get paid so much.”
In 2007, according to a USA To-
day study, one coach in the NCAA 
Tournament was making more than 
$2 million. Since that time, six coaches 
have surpassed $3 million, according 
to figures provided by St. Louis at-
torney Bob Lattinville of the law firm 
Stinson Morrison Hecker, which rep-
resents numerous college coaches. . . .
 This week at his Final Four press 
conference, NCAA President Mark 
Emmert addressed the conundrum 
of rising salaries at a time when many 
colleges are having to make cuts.
He was asked specifically about 
Kentucky coach John Calipari’s sal-
ary of $3.9 million at a time when staff 
and faculty can’t get a raise.
“Kentucky and a number of other 
universities have decided that their 
coaches deserve to be well compen-
sated, that that’s a good investment for 
the institution,” Emmert said. “And 
I’m not second-guessing them.”
Lattinville argues that coaches 
are worth “every dime” because of the 
hours they work, the potential impact 
on their health and the public scrutiny 
they and their families must endure.

ceived a raise from $1 million to $1.5

 Before he was able to catapult Mis-
souri to the Elite Eight in 2009, coach 
Mike Anderson’s salary was respect-
able within the profession at $855,000. 
But that figure lacked the panache that 
announces a coach’s arrival among the 
elite, at least financially speaking.
However, with salaries trending 
skyward, Anderson was able to join 
the growing $2 million club with as-
tonishing swiftness.
A 58 percent raise from Mizzou 
put him at $1.35 million for two sea-
sons. Then Arkansas upped the ante 
and lured him to Fayetteville with a 63 
percent raise to $2.2 million annually.
In a job where $1 million was 
considered astronomical not long 
ago, Anderson is now helping to shat-
ter the ceiling. Purdue’s Matt Painter 
signed for $2.3 million last week, and 
Marquette’s Buzz Williams received a 
contract reported by the Milwaukee 
Journal Sentinel at $2 million annually, 
more than double his previous pay.
Thus, 15 coaches have reached 
that milestone, with Missouri and 
possibly Oklahoma willing to of-
fer similar money to their upcoming 
hires.
Although coaches are hired based 
on potential to produce a winner, it’s 
ultimately about making money, ac-

more than wins, losses and revenue 
capability.
“The immediate success is the 
W’s and L’s,” he said. “The long-term 
success is the kids graduating, becom-
ing good citizens and having good 
families. There are special cases where 
kids go to play pro basketball. And we 
put in an awful lot of time. If you have 
a whole day off every couple of weeks, 
you’re fortunate.”
Zimbalist is in favor of a salary cap 
but says it would require an antitrust 
exemption from Congress. He doesn’t 
understand how some schools can offer 
salaries on par with NBA coaches while 
making a fraction of the revenue. . . .
Lattinville said salaries will level 
off when universities and alumni be-
come satisfied with teams being com-
petitive and having a high caliber of 
student-athletes.
In other words, no time soon.
“People aren’t satisfied with that, 
and there’s enormous pressure on 
those guys to win,” he said. “When a 
school terminates a coach, they com-
plain they have to overpay. But we’re 
all part of that problem.”

interest in hiring coaches who can increase 
the schools’ chances of winning. As long 
as basketball coaches are successful at in-
creasing revenues for their schools, the 
demand for these coaches will continue to 
increase and, all else equal, the continued 
increase in demand will result in a contin-
ued increase in the equilibrium wage in the 
market for NCAA Division 1-A basketball 
coaches.
Thinking Critically
1. Why do Division 1-A college basketball 
coaches earn higher salaries than most 
of their faculty colleagues?
2. Suppose that 100 non-Division 1-A col-
leges became Division 1-A colleges over 
a three-year period, raising the total num-
ber of Division 1-A college basketball 
programs to 445. How would this affect 
the (a) demand, (b) supply, and (c) equi-
librium salary for basketball coaches?
demand curve is the marginal revenue 
product of labor (P * MPL). The salaries are 
competitive and based on the ability of 
coaches to create winning programs and 
generate revenue.
b Increases in the demand for coaches 
occur when there are increases in the 
revenue generated by the schools’ basket-
ball programs. A coach’s value therefore 
depends not only on his win–loss record 
but also on the amount of revenue gener-
ated by the program. Schools often credit 
significant revenue increases following the 
hiring of a basketball coach to the hiring, 
and this analysis results in larger salaries. 
The figure below shows that as the demand 
for coaches increases to D2, the equilibrium 
salary increases to W2. Schools that bid up 
salaries know that higher salaries are 
needed to attract the best coaches, and 
winning programs result in greater revenue.
c Not all 345 basketball programs can 
be successful at the same time. Ath-
letic contests are zero-sum games with an 
equal number of wins and losses. Losing 
programs result in lower attendance and 
falling revenue, so schools have a financial 
Key Points in the Article
As of April 2011, colleges and universi-
ties paid 15 NCAA Division 1-A basketball 
coaches salaries of $2 million or higher, 
with 6 of these coaches surpassing the $3 
million salary mark. The high salaries have 
been questioned at a time when many 
schools are finding it necessary to cut ex-
penses elsewhere. The schools justify the 
salaries because many basketball programs 
generate large revenues and profits, and 
the coaches are therefore viewed as good 
investments.
Analyzing the News
a Successful college basketball coaches 
such as Mike Anderson and John 
 Calipari receive high salaries because their 
marginal products are high, and a fixed 
number of schools compete for the best 
coaches. In 2011, there were 345 NCAA 
 Division 1-A men’s basketball teams, so the 
labor supply curve in the figure below is ver-
tical at a quantity of 345. The demand curve

LEARNING OBJECTIVE: Explain how firms choose the profit-maximizing quantity of labor to employ.
Summary
The demand for labor is a derived demand because it depends 
on the demand consumers have for goods and services. The ad-
ditional output produced by a firm as a result of hiring another 
worker is called the marginal product of labor. The amount by 
which a firm’s revenue will increase as a result of hiring one more 
worker is called the marginal revenue product of labor (MRP). A 
firm’s marginal revenue product of labor curve is its demand curve 
for labor. Firms maximize profit by hiring workers up to the point 
where the wage is equal to the marginal revenue product of labor. 
The market demand curve for labor is determined by adding up 
the quantity of labor demanded by each firm at each wage, hold-
ing constant all other variables that might affect the willingness of 
firms to hire workers. The most important variables that shift the 
labor demand curve are changes in human capital, technology, the 
price of the product, the quantity of other inputs, and the number 
of firms in the market. Human capital is the accumulated training 
and skills that workers possess.

The Supply of Labor, pages 550–552
 17.2 
LEARNING OBJECTIVE: Explain how people choose the quantity of labor to supply.
Summary
As the wage increases, the opportunity cost of leisure increases, 
causing individuals to supply a greater quantity of labor. Normally, 
the labor supply curve is upward sloping, but it is possible that at 
very high wage levels, the supply curve might be backward bend-
ing. This outcome occurs when someone with a high income is 
willing to accept a somewhat lower income in exchange for more 
leisure. The market labor supply curve is determined by adding 
up the quantity of labor supplied by each worker at each wage, 
holding constant all other variables that might affect the willing-
ness of workers to supply labor. The most important variables that 
shift the labor supply curve are increases in population, changing 
 demographics, and changing alternatives.

the substitution effect of a wage change for Daniel?
 
2.4 A columnist writing in the Wall Street Journal during the 
recession of 2007–2009 made the following observation 
about the “price of time”:
The recession is doing funny things with the 
price of time.
Technically it’s risen in value. Although hardly 
anyone seems to have noticed, the govern-
ment’s latest figures show that hourly wages in 
real terms—which had pretty much stagnated 
for decades—have just jumped to their highest 
levels since the 1970s. You can thank cheaper 
prices in the stores, as well as higher pay.
 
 What is the “price of time”? Is the columnist correct that 
when real hourly wages rise, the price of time increases? 
Briefly explain.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE: Explain how equilibrium wages are determined in labor markets.
Summary
The intersection between labor supply and labor demand deter-
mines the equilibrium wage and the equilibrium level of employ-
ment. If labor supply is unchanged, an increase in labor demand 
will increase both the equilibrium wage and the number of work-
ers employed. If labor demand is unchanged, an increase in labor 
supply will lower the equilibrium wage and increase the number 
of workers employed.

Over time, the gap between the wages of workers with 
college degrees and the wages of workers without college 
degrees has been increasing. Shouldn’t this gap have in-
creased the incentive for workers to earn college degrees, 
thereby increasing the supply of college-educated workers 
and reducing the size of the gap?

Explaining Differences in Wages, pages 556–566
 17.4 
LEARNING OBJECTIVE: Use demand and supply analysis to explain how compensating differentials, 
discrimination, and labor unions cause wages to differ.
Summary
The equilibrium wage is determined by the intersection of the la-
bor demand curve and the labor supply curve. Some differences 
in wages are explained by compensating differentials, which are 
higher wages that compensate workers for unpleasant aspects of a 
job. Wages can also differ because of economic discrimination, 
which involves paying a person a lower wage or excluding a per-
son from an occupation on the basis of irrelevant characteristics, 
such as race or gender. Labor unions are organizations of employ-
ees that have the legal right to bargain with employers about wages 
and working conditions. Being in a union increases a worker’s 
wages about 10 percent, holding constant other factors, such as 
the industry in question.

of what the highest-paid general managers are

better than the coach who outmaneuvered Bob Stoops of 
Oklahoma on Monday night? Boise State paid Chris Pe-
tersen $500,000 this season—and he still hasn’t lost a game.” 
Might Saban still be worth a salary of $4 million per year to 
Alabama even if he is not “eight times better” than a coach 
being paid $500,000 at another school? In your answer, be 
sure to refer to the difference between the marginal prod-
uct of labor and the marginal revenue product of labor.

 4.14 Prior to the early twentieth century, a worker who was in-
jured on the job could collect damages only by suing his 
employer. To sue successfully, the worker—or his family, if 
the worker had been killed—had to show that the injury was 
due to the employer’s negligence, that the worker did not 
know the job was hazardous, and that the worker’s own neg-
ligence had not contributed to the accident. These lawsuits 
were difficult for workers to win, and even workers who had 
been seriously injured on the job often were unable to col-
lect any damages from their employers. Beginning in 1910, 
most states passed workers’ compensation laws that required 
employers to purchase insurance that would compensate 
workers for injuries suffered on the job. A study by Price 
Fishback and Shawn Kantor of the University of Arizona 
shows that after the passage of workers’ compensation laws, 
wages received by workers in the coal and lumber industries 
fell. Briefly explain why passage of workers’ compensation 
laws would lead to a fall in wages in some industries.

 4.16 During the 1970s, many women changed their minds about 
whether they would leave the labor force after marrying

gitudinal Survey asked a representative sample of women 
aged 14 to 24 whether they expected to be in the labor force 
at age 35. Twenty-nine percent of white women and 59 per-
cent of black women responded that they expected to be in 
the labor force at that age. In fact, when these women were 
35 years old, 60 percent of those who were married and 80 
percent of those who were unmarried were in the labor 
force. In other words, many more women ended up being 
in the labor force than expected to be when they were of 
high school and college age. What effect did this fact have 
on the earnings of these women? Briefly explain.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE: Discuss the role personnel economics can play in helping firms deal with human 
resources issues.
Summary
Personnel economics is the application of economic analysis 
to human resources issues. One insight of personnel econom-
ics is that the productivity of workers can often be increased 
if firms move from straight-time pay to commission or piece-
rate pay.

Review Questions
 
5.1 What is personnel economics?
 
5.2 What are the two ways that the productivity of a firm’s 
employees may increase when a firm moves from straight-
time pay to commission or piece-rate pay?
 
5.3 If piece-rate or commission systems of compensating 
workers have important advantages for firms, why don’t 
more firms use them?
Problems and Applications
 
5.4 According to a study, the number of jobs in which firms used 
bonuses, commissions, or piece rates to tie workers’ pay to 
their performance increased from an estimated 30 percent of 
all jobs in the 1970s to 40 percent in the 1990s. Why would 
systems that tie workers’ pay to how much they produce have 
become increasingly popular with firms? The same study 
found that these pay systems were more common in higher-
paid jobs than in lower-paid jobs. Briefly explain this result.

 Parent, “Performance Pay and Wage Inequality,” Quarterly Journal of 
Economics, Vol. 124, No. 1, February 2009, pp. 1–49.
 
5.5 Many companies that pay workers an hourly wage require 
some minimum level of acceptable output. Suppose a com-
pany that has been using this system decides to switch to 
a piece-rate system under which workers are compensated 
on the basis of how much output they produce. Is it likely 
that workers under a piece-rate system will end up choos-
ing to produce less than the minimum output required un-
der the hourly wage system? Briefly explain.

5.6 In most jobs, the harder you work, the more you earn. 
Some workers would rather work harder and earn more; 
others would rather work less hard, even though as a re-
sult they earn less. Suppose, though, that all workers at a 
company fall into the “work harder and earn more” group. 
Suppose also that the workers all have the same abilities. 
In these circumstances, would output per worker be the 
same under an hourly wage compensation system as under 
a piece-rate system? Briefly explain.
 
5.7 For years, the Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company compen-
sated its sales force by paying a salesperson a salary plus a bo-
nus, based on the number of tires he or she sold. Eventually, 
Goodyear made two changes to this policy: (1) The basis for 
the bonus was changed from the quantity of tires sold to the 
revenue from the tires sold; and (2) salespeople were required to 
get approval from corporate headquarters in Akron, Ohio, be-
fore offering to sell tires to customers at reduced prices. Explain 
why these changes were likely to increase Goodyear’s profits.

ative to Boost Prices,” Wall Street Journal, September 18, 2002.

 17.6 
LEARNING OBJECTIVE: Show how equilibrium prices are determined in the markets for capital and natural resources.
Summary
The approach used to analyze the market for labor can also be used 
to analyze the markets for other factors of production. In equilib-
rium, the price of capital is equal to the marginal revenue product 
of capital, and the price of natural resources is equal to the marginal 
revenue product of natural resources. The price received by a factor 
that is in fixed supply is called an economic rent, or a pure rent. A 
monopsony is the sole buyer of a factor of production. According 
to the marginal productivity theory of income distribution, the 
distribution of income is determined by the marginal productivity 
of the factors of production individuals own.

Review Questions
 
6.1 In equilibrium, what determines the price of capital? What 
determines the price of natural resources? What is the 
marginal productivity theory of income distribution?
 
6.2 What is an economic rent? What is a monopsony?
Problems and Applications
 
6.3 Adam operates a pin factory. Suppose Adam faces the situ-
ation shown in the following table and the cost of renting a 
machine is $550 per week.
 
6.4 Many people have predicted, using a model like the one 
in panel (b) of Figure 17.12 on page 570, that the price 
of natural resources should rise consistently over time in 
comparison with the prices of other goods because the de-
mand curve for natural resources is continually shifting to 
the right, while the supply curve must be shifting to the 
left as natural resources are used up. However, the relative 
prices of most natural resources have not been increasing. 
Draw a graph that shows the demand and supply for natu-
ral resources that can explain why prices haven’t risen even 
though demand has.
 
6.5 In 1879, economist Henry George published Progress and 
Poverty, which became one of the best-selling books of the 
nineteenth century. In this book, George argued that all 
existing taxes should be replaced with a single tax on land. 
In Chapter 4, we discussed the concept of tax incidence, or 
the actual division of the burden of a tax between buyers 
and sellers in a market. If land is taxed, how will the bur-
den of the tax be divided between the sellers of land and 
the buyers of land? Illustrate your answer with a graph of 
the market for land.
 
6.6 The total amount of oil in the earth is not increasing. Does 
this mean that in the market for oil, the supply curve is 
perfectly inelastic? Briefly explain.

wage should reduce the equilibrium level of employment. 
Will this also be true if the labor market is a monopsony?

Economics in Your Life
How Much Tax Should You Pay?
Government is ever present in your life. Just today, you likely drove on roads that the government 
paid to build and maintain. You may attend a public college or university, paid for, at least in part, 
by government. Where does a government get its money? By taxing citizens. Think of the different 
taxes you pay. Do you think you pay more than, less than, or just about your fair share in taxes? How 
do you  determine what your fair share is? As you read this chapter, see if you can answer these ques-
tions. You can check your answers against those we provide on page 605 at the end of this chapter.
to use the tax code to help  reduce this in-
equality. Romney  argued that increasing 
income inequality had not been caused by 
changes in taxes and that increasing taxes 
on individuals with high incomes was likely 
to reduce economic efficiency while having 
little effect on inequality.
The questions raised by the debate over 
taxes during the 2012 election campaign 
were not new. Presidents John F. Kennedy 
and Ronald Reagan proposed significant 
cuts in income taxes that they claimed would 
enhance economic efficiency, while their op-
ponents claimed that the tax cuts rewarded 
high-income taxpayers and increased in-
come inequality. The design of the tax sys-
tem and the criteria to use in evaluating it are 
important questions. Has the tax code im-
proved economic efficiency? Has the govern-
ment, through its tax and other policies, had 
much effect on the distribution of income? 
We explore these questions in this chapter.
AN INSIDE LOOK AT POLICY on 
page 606 describes the arguments for and 
against using a tax on soda to reduce budget 
deficits.
Based on Jackie Calmes, “Obama Draws New Hard Line 
on Long-Term Debt Reduction,” New York Times, Septem-
ber 19, 2011; and John D. McKinnon, “Millionaire’s Tax to Be 
Tough Sell,” Wall Street Journal, September 19, 2011.
Taxes affect the incomes of households and 
the decisions made by businesses. For exam-
ple, about 10 years ago, when the federal gov-
ernment cut the tax on dividends—payments 
corporations make to stockholders—many 
companies responded in a big way. Before the 
tax cut, Microsoft had never paid a dividend. 
After the tax cut, in a single year, Microsoft 
paid out more than $40 billion in dividends. 
Cutting the tax on dividends was intended to 
improve economic efficiency, but changing 
the tax code can serve other purposes as well.
The United States has the most un-
equal distribution of income of any high-
income country, and income inequality 
in the United States has been increasing 
in recent years. As the 2012 presidential 
election campaign heated up, one of sev-
eral issues separating President Barack 
Obama from Republican contender former 
 Massachusetts Governor Mitt  Romney was 
whether changes in the tax system should be 
used to reduce income inequality. President 
Obama argued that the tax cut on dividends, 
as well as other tax cuts enacted during the 
early 2000s, had increased the burden on in-
dividuals with low and moderate incomes, 
while the burden on the wealthy and on 
corporations had been reduced,  increasing 
the level of income inequality. He proposed

e saw in Chapter 2 that the government plays a significant role in helping 
the market system work efficiently by providing secure rights to private 
property and an independent court system to enforce contracts. We saw 
in Chapter 5 that the government itself must sometimes supply goods—
known as public goods—that private firms will not supply. But how do governments decide 
which policies to adopt? In recent years, economists led by Nobel Laureate James Buchanan 
and Gordon Tullock, formerly of the University of Virginia, have developed the public choice 
model, which applies economic analysis to government decision making. In this chapter, we 
will explore how public choice can help us understand how policymakers make decisions.
We will also discuss the principles that governments use to create tax policy. In particu-
lar, we will see how economists identify which taxes are most economically efficient. At the 
end of the chapter, we will discuss the extent to which government policy—including tax 
policy—affects the distribution of income.
Public Choice
In earlier chapters, we focused on explaining the actions of households and firms. We 
have assumed that households and firms act to make themselves as well off as possible. 
In particular, we have assumed that households choose the goods they buy to maximize 
their utility and that firms choose the quantities and prices of the goods they sell to 
maximize profits. Because government policy plays an important role in the economy, it 
is important also to consider how government policymakers—such as senators, gover-
nors, presidents, and state legislators—arrive at their decisions. One of the key insights 
from the public choice model is that policymakers are no different than consumers or 
managers of firms: Policymakers are likely to pursue their own self-interest, even if their 
self-interest conflicts with the public interest. In particular, we expect that public offi-
cials will take actions that are likely to result in their being reelected.
How Do We Know the Public Interest? Models of Voting
It is possible to argue that elected officials simply represent the preferences of the voters 
who elect them. After all, it would seem logical that voters will not reelect a politician 
who fails to act in the public interest. A closer look at voting, however, makes it less clear 
that politicians are simply representing the views of the voters.
The Voting Paradox Many policy decisions involve multiple alternatives. Because 
the size of the federal budget is limited, policymakers face trade-offs. To take a simple 
example, suppose that there is $1 billion available in the budget, and Congress must 
choose whether to spend it on only one of three alternatives: (1) research on breast can-
cer, (2) subsidies for mass transit, or (3) increased border security. Assume that the votes 
of members of Congress will represent the preferences of their constituents. We might 
expect that Congress will vote for the alternative favored by a majority of the voters. In 
fact, though, there are circumstances in which majority voting will fail to result in a con-
sistent decision. For example, suppose for simplicity that there are only three voters, and 
they have the preferences shown at the top of Table 18.1.
In the table, we show the three policy alternatives in the first column. The remain-
ing columns show the voters’ rankings of the alternatives. For example, Lena would pre-
fer to see the money spent on cancer research. Her second choice is mass transit, and 
her third choice is border security. What happens if a series of votes are taken in which 
each pair of alternatives is considered in turn? The bottom of Table 18.1 shows the re-
sults of these votes. If the vote is between spending the money on cancer research and 
spending the money on mass transit, cancer research wins because Lena and David both 
prefer spending the money on cancer research to spending the money on mass transit. 
So, if the votes of members of Congress represent the preferences of voters, we have a

clear verdict, and the money is spent on cancer research. Suppose, though, that the vote 
is between spending the money on mass transit and spending the money on border se-
curity. Then, because Lena and Kathleen prefer spending on mass transit to spending on 
border security, mass transit wins. Now, finally, suppose the vote is between spending 
on cancer research and spending on border security. Surprisingly, border security wins 
because that is what David and Kathleen prefer. The outcome of this vote is surprising 
because if voters prefer cancer research to mass transit and mass transit to border secu-
rity, we would expect that consistency in decision making would ensure that they prefer 
cancer research to border security. But in this example, the collective preferences of the 
voters turn out not to be consistent. The failure of majority voting to always result in 
consistent choices is called the voting paradox.
This is an artificial example because we assumed that there were only three alterna-
tives, there were only three voters, and a simple majority vote determined the outcomes. 
In fact, though, Nobel Laureate Kenneth Arrow of Stanford University has shown math-
ematically that the failure of majority votes to always represent voters’ preferences is 
a very general result. The Arrow impossibility theorem states that no system of vot-
ing can be devised that will consistently represent the underlying preferences of voters. 
This theorem suggests that there is no way through democratic voting to ensure that the 
preferences of voters are translated into policy choices. In fact, the Arrow impossibility 
theorem suggests that voting might lead to shifts in policy that may not be efficient. For 
instance, which of the three alternatives for spending the $1 billion Congress will actu-
ally choose would depend on the order in which the alternatives happen to be voted 
on, which might change from one year to the next. So, with respect to economic issues, 
such as providing funding for public goods, we cannot count on the political process 
to necessarily result in an efficient outcome. In other words, the “voting market”—as 
represented by elections—may often do a less efficient job of representing consumer 
preferences than do markets for goods and services.
The Median Voter Theorem In practice, many political issues are decided by a 
majority vote. In those cases, what can we say about which voters’ preferences the out-
come is likely to represent? An important result known as the median voter theorem 
states that the outcome of a majority vote is likely to represent the preferences of the 
voter who is in the political middle. To take another simplified example, suppose there 
are five voters, and their preferences for spending on breast cancer research are shown 
in Figure 18.1. Their preferences range from Kathleen, who prefers to spend nothing on 
breast cancer research—preferring the funds to be spent on other programs or for fed-
eral spending to be reduced and taxes lowered—to Lena, who prefers to spend $6 billion.
In this case, David is the median voter because he is in the political middle; two voters 
would prefer to spend less than he does and two would prefer to spend more. To see why 
the median voter’s preferences are likely to prevail, consider first a vote  between  David’s 
preferred outcome of spending $2 billion and a proposal to spend $6 billion.  Because 
only Lena favors $6 billion and the other voters all prefer spending less, the  proposal to 
spend $2 billion would win four votes to one. Similarly, consider a vote  between spend-
ing $2 billion and spending $1 billion. Three voters prefer spending more than $1 billion

and only two prefer spending $1 billion or less, so the proposal to spend $2 billion will 
win three votes to two. Only the proposal to spend $2 billion will have the support of a 
majority when paired with proposals to spend a different amount. Notice also that the 
amount spent as a result of the voting is less than the amount that would result from tak-
ing the simple average of the voter’s preferences, which would be $2.6 billion.
One implication of the median voter theorem is that the political process tends to 
serve individuals whose preferences are in the middle but not those individuals whose 
preferences are far away from the median. There is an important contrast between the 
political process, which results in collective actions in which everyone is obliged to par-
ticipate, and the market process, in which individuals are free to participate or not. For 
instance, even though Kathleen would prefer not to spend government funds on breast 
cancer research, once a majority has voted to spend $2 billion, Kathleen is obliged to go 
along with the spending—and the taxes required to fund the spending. This is in con-
trast with the market for goods and services, where if, for instance, Kathleen disagrees 
with the majority of consumers who like iPods, she is under no obligation to buy one. 
Similarly, even though Lena and Steve might prefer to pay significantly higher taxes to 
fund additional spending on breast cancer research, they are obliged to go along with 
the lower level of spending the majority approved. If Lena would like to have her iPod 
gold plated, she can choose to do so, even if the vast majority of consumers would con-
sider such spending a waste of money.
Government Failure?
The voting models we have just looked at indicate that individuals are less likely to see 
their preferences represented in the outcomes of government policies than in the out-
comes of markets. The public choice model goes beyond this observation to question 
whether the self-interest of policymakers is likely to cause them to take actions that are 
inconsistent with the preferences of voters, even where those preferences are clear. There 
are several aspects of how the political process works that might lead to this outcome.
Rent Seeking Economists usually focus on analyzing the actions of individuals and 
firms as they attempt to make themselves better off by interacting in markets. The 
public choice model shifts the focus to attempts by individuals and firms to engage in 
rent seeking, which is the use of government action to make themselves better off at 
the expense of others. One of the benefits of the market system is that it channels self- 
interested behavior in a way that benefits society as a whole. Although Apple developed 
the iPad to make profits, its actions increased the well-being of millions of consumers. 
When Samsung introduced the Galaxy Tab to compete with the iPad, it also was moti-
vated by the desire for profit, but it further increased consumer well-being by expand-
ing the choice of tablet computers available. Rent seeking, in contrast, can benefit a few

and firms to use government action

expense of others.

The Median Voter Theorem
The median voter theorem states that the 
outcome of a majority vote is likely to rep-
resent the preferences of the voter who is in 
the political middle. In this case, David is 
in the political middle because two voters 
want to spend more on breast cancer re-
search than he does and two voters want to 
spend less. In any vote between a proposal 
to spend $2 billion and a proposal to spend 
a different amount, a proposal to spend 
$2  billion will win.

individuals or firms at the expense of all other individuals and firms. For example, we 
saw in Chapter 9 that U.S. sugar firms have successfully convinced Congress to impose 
a quota on imports of sugar. The quota has benefited the owners of U.S. sugar firms and 
the people who work for them but has reduced consumer surplus, hurt U.S. candy com-
panies and their workers, and reduced economic efficiency.
Because firms can benefit from government intervention in the economy, as the 
sugar companies have benefited from the sugar quota, they are willing to spend re-
sources to attempt to secure these interventions. Members of Congress, state legisla-
tors, governors, and presidents need funds to finance their election campaigns. So, these 
policymakers may accept campaign contributions from rent-seeking firms and may be 
willing to introduce special interest legislation in their behalf.
Logrolling and Rational Ignorance Two other factors help explain why rent-
seeking behavior can sometimes succeed. It may seem puzzling that the sugar quota has 
been enacted when  it helped very few workers and firms. Why would members of Con-
gress vote for the sugar quota if they do not have sugar companies in their districts? One 
possibility is logrolling. Logrolling refers to the situation where a member of Congress 
votes to approve a bill in exchange for favorable votes from other members on other bills. 
For example, a member of Congress from Texas might vote for the sugar quota, even 
though none of the member’s constituents will benefit from it. In exchange, members 
of Congress from districts where sugar producers are located will vote for legislation the 
member of Congress from Texas would like to see passed. This vote trading may result 
in a majority of Congress supporting legislation that benefits the economic interests of a 
few while harming the economic interests of a much larger group.
But if the majority of voters is harmed by rent-seeking legislation, how does it get 
passed, even given the effects of logrolling? In Chapter 9, we discussed one possible 
explanation with respect to the sugar quota. Although, collectively, consumer surplus 
declines by $6.08 billion per year because of the sugar quota, spread across a population 
of 310 million, the loss per person is only $20. Because the loss is so small, most people 
do not take it into account when deciding how to vote in elections, and many people are 
not even aware that the sugar quota exists. Other voters may be convinced to support 
restrictions on trade because the jobs saved by tariffs and quotas are visible and often 
highly publicized, while the jobs lost because of these restrictions and the reductions in 
consumer surplus are harder to detect. Because becoming informed on an issue may re-
quire time and effort and the economic payoff is often low, some economists argue that 
many voters are rationally ignorant of the effect of rent-seeking legislation. In this view, 
because voters frequently lack an economic incentive to become informed about pend-
ing legislation, the voters’ preferences do not act as a constraint on legislators voting for 
rent-seeking legislation.
Regulatory Capture One way in which the government intervenes in the economy 
is by establishing a regulatory agency or commission that is given authority over a par-
ticular industry or type of product. For example, no firm is allowed to sell prescription 
drugs in the United States without first receiving authorization from the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA). Ideally, regulatory agencies will make decisions in the public in-
terest. The FDA should weigh the benefits to patients from quickly approving a new 
drug against the costs that the agency may overlook potentially dangerous side effects 
of the drug if approval is too rapid. However, because the firms being regulated are sig-
nificantly affected by the regulatory agency’s actions, the firms have an incentive to try 
to influence those actions. In extreme cases, this influence may lead the agency to make 
decisions that are in the best interests of the firms being regulated, even if these actions 
are not in the public interest. In that case, the agency has been subject to regulatory 
capture by the industry being regulated. Some economists point to the Interstate Com-
merce Commission (ICC) as an example of regulatory capture. Although Congress has 
since abolished the ICC, for decades it determined the prices that railroads and long-
distance trucking firms could charge to haul freight. Congress originally established the 
ICC to safeguard the interests of consumers, but some economists have argued that for 

586 
C H A P T E R  1 8  Public Choice, Taxes, and the Distribution of Income 
many years, the ICC operated to suppress competition, which was in the interests of 
the railroads and trucking firms rather than in the interests of consumers. Economists 
 debate the extent to which regulatory capture explains the decisions of some govern-
ment agencies.
In Chapter 5, we saw how the presence of externalities can lead to market failure, 
which is the situation where the market does not supply the economically efficient 
quantity of a good or service. Public choice analysis indicates that government failure 
can also occur. For the reasons we have discussed in this section, it is possible that gov-
ernment intervention in the economy may reduce economic efficiency rather than in-
crease it. Economists disagree about the extent to which government failure results in 
serious economic inefficiency in the U.S. economy. Most economists, though, accept 
the basic argument of the public choice model that policymakers may have incentives to 
intervene in the economy in ways that do not promote efficiency and that proposals for 
such intervention should be evaluated with care.
Is Government Regulation Necessary?
The public choice model raises important questions about the effect of government 
regulation on economic efficiency. But can we conclude that Congress should abolish 
agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Environmental Protec-
tion Agency (EPA), and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)? In fact, most econo-
mists agree that these agencies can serve useful purposes. For instance, in Chapter 5, we 
discussed how the EPA can help correct the effects of production externalities, such as 
pollution. Regulatory agencies can also improve economic efficiency in markets where 
consumers have difficulty obtaining the information they need to make informed pur-
chases. For example, consumers have no easy way of detecting bacteria and other con-
taminants in food or determining whether prescription drugs are safe and effective. The 
FDA was established in the early twentieth century to monitor the nation’s food supply 
following newspaper accounts of unsanitary practices in many meatpacking plants.
Although government regulation can clearly provide important benefits to consum-
ers, we need to take into account the costs of regulations. Recent estimates indicate that 
the costs of federal regulations may be several thousand dollars per taxpayer. Economics 
can help policymakers devise regulations that provide benefits to consumers that exceed 
their costs.
The Tax System
However the size of government and the types of activities it engages in are determined, 
government spending has to be financed. The government primarily relies on taxes to 
raise the revenue it needs. Some taxes, though, such as those on cigarettes or alcohol, are 
intended more to discourage what society views as undesirable behavior than to raise 
revenue. These are the most widely used taxes:
• 
Individual income taxes. The federal government, most state governments, and 
some local governments tax the wages, salaries, and other income of households 
and the profits of firms. The individual income tax is the largest source of revenue 
for the federal government. Because low-income people are exempted from paying 
federal individual income taxes, in recent years nearly half of all households have 
paid no federal income tax. In 2009, people who paid the individual income tax had 
an average income of $71,636 and paid federal individual income taxes of $8,307.
• 
Social insurance taxes. The federal government taxes wages and salaries to raise 
 revenue for the Social Security and Medicare systems. Social Security makes 
 payments to retired workers and to disabled individuals. Medicare helps pay the 
medical expenses of people over age 65. The Social Security and Medicare taxes are 
often referred to as “payroll taxes.” As the U.S. population has aged, payroll taxes 
have increased. By 2011, 76 percent of taxpayers paid more in payroll taxes than in

 federal income taxes. The federal government and state governments also tax wages 
and salaries to raise revenue for the unemployment insurance system, which makes 
payments to workers who have lost their jobs.
• 
Sales taxes. Most state and local governments tax retail sales of most products. 
More than half the states exempt food from the sales tax, and a few states also ex-
empt clothing.
• 
Property taxes. Most local governments tax homes, offices, factories, and the land 
they are built on. In the United States, the property tax is the largest source of funds 
for public schools.
• 
Excise taxes. The federal government and some state governments levy excise taxes 
on specific goods, such as gasoline, cigarettes, and beer.
An Overview of the U.S. Tax System
Panels (a) and (b) of Figure 18.2 show the revenue sources of the federal, state, and local 
governments. Panel (a) shows that the federal government raises nearly 80 percent of its 
revenue from the social insurance taxes and from the individual income tax. Corporate 
income taxes and excise taxes account for much smaller fractions of federal revenues. 
In 2010, federal revenues of all types amounted to almost $2.4 trillion, or about $20,360 
per household. Over the past 40 years, federal revenues as a share of gross domestic 
product (GDP; the value of all the goods and services produced in the U.S. economy) 
have typically remained in a fairly narrow range between 17 percent and 19 percent, 
with a low of 16 percent in 2009 and a high of 21 percent in 2000.
 Figure 18.2  Federal, State, and Local Sources of Revenue, 2010
Social insurance taxes are the most important source of revenue for the federal 
government, and individual income taxes are the second most important source. 
State and local governments receive the most revenue from sales taxes. State 
and local governments also receive large transfers from the federal government, 
in part to help pay for federally mandated programs. Many local governments 
 depend on property taxes to raise most of their tax revenue.

C H A P T E R  1 8  Public Choice, Taxes, and the Distribution of Income 
Panel (b) shows that state and local governments rely on a different mix of  revenue 
sources than does the federal government. In fact, in most years, the largest source 
of revenue for state and local governments is sales taxes. State and local governments 
also receive large grants from the federal government, which in 2010 were their largest 
source of revenue. These grants are intended in part to pay for  programs that the federal 
government requires states and local governments to carry out. These programs, often 
called federal mandates, include the Medicaid program, which provides health care to 
poor people, and the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, which 
provides financial assistance to poor families. During and after the 2007–2009 recession 
the federal government temporarily increased its grants to local governments. Local 
governments depend heavily on property taxes. Many local school districts, in particu-
lar, rely almost entirely on revenues from property taxes.
Progressive and Regressive Taxes
Economists often categorize taxes on the basis of the amount of tax people with differ-
ent levels of income pay relative to their incomes. A tax is regressive if people with lower 
 incomes pay a higher percentage of their income in tax than do people with higher incomes. 
A tax is progressive if people with lower incomes pay a lower percentage of their income in 
tax than do people with higher incomes. A tax is proportional if people with lower incomes 
pay the same percentage of their income in tax as do people with higher incomes.
The federal income tax is an example of a progressive tax. To see why, we must first 
consider the important distinction between a tax rate and a tax bracket. A tax rate is 
the percentage of income paid in taxes. A tax bracket refers to the income range within 
which a tax rate applies. Table 18.2 shows the federal income tax brackets and tax rates 
for single taxpayers in 2011.
We can use Table 18.2 to calculate what Matt, a single taxpayer with an income of 
$100,000, pays in federal income tax. This example is somewhat simplified because we 
are ignoring the exemptions and deductions that taxpayers can use to reduce the amount 
of income subject to tax. For example, taxpayers are allowed to exclude from taxation a 
certain amount of income, called the personal exemption, that represents very basic living 
expenses. Ignoring Matt’s exemptions and deductions, he will have to make the tax pay-
ment to the federal government shown in Table 18.3. Matt’s first $8,500 of income is in the 
10 percent bracket, so he pays $850 in taxes on that part of his income. His next $26,000 
of income is in the 15 percent bracket, so he pays $3,900. His next $49,100 of income is in 
the 25 percent bracket, so he pays $12,275. His last $16,400 of income is in the 28 percent 
bracket, so he pays $4,592, which brings his total federal income tax bill to $21,617.

Marginal and Average Income Tax Rates
The fraction of each additional dollar of income that must be paid in taxes is called the 
marginal tax rate. The average tax rate is the total tax paid divided by total  income.

Which Groups Pay the Most  
in Federal Taxes?
At the beginning of this chapter, we mentioned the ongoing 
debate over whether to increase taxes on people with high in-
comes. To evaluate this debate, it’s useful to know how much each income group pays 
of the total taxes collected by the federal government. The following table shows projec-
tions for 2011 by the Tax Policy Center, with taxpayers divided into quintiles from the 
20 percent with the lowest income to the 20 percent with the highest income. The last 
row also shows taxpayers whose incomes put them in the top 1 percent. Column (1) 
shows the percentage of total income earned by each income group. Column (2) shows 
the percentage of all federal taxes—including Social Security and Medicare payroll 
taxes—paid by each income group. Column (3) shows the average federal tax rate for 
each group, calculated by dividing total taxes paid by total income.

The data in column (2) show that the 20  percent of taxpayers with the highest in-
comes pay 70 percent of federal taxes. This share is more than their share of total in-
come earned, which is about 55 percent, as shown in column (1). Only taxpayers in the 
highest quintile pay a larger share of taxes than their share of income. Taxpayers whose 
incomes put them in the top 1 percent pay more than 25 percent of federal taxes. Many 
individuals in the lowest quintile of income, particularly those with children, receive tax 
credits from the federal government so that they in effect pay negative taxes. Column 
(3) indicates that average tax rates rise as income rises.
If we look at just the federal individual income tax considered separately from the 
payroll tax and other federal taxes, the results are similar. In 2011, taxpayers in the top 1 
percent of the income distribution were projected to earn 17 percent of all  income while 
paying 34 percent of all federal individual income taxes. The top 20 percent earned  
55 percent of income while paying 85 percent of taxes. The bottom 40 percent of the income 
distribution earned 12 percent of income but actually paid negative 5 percent of federal 
 individual income taxes when taking into account tax credits, such as the child tax credit.
We can conclude that the federal taxes are progressive. Whether the federal tax sys-
tem should be made more or less progressive remains a source of political debate.

C H A P T E R  1 8  Public Choice, Taxes, and the Distribution of Income 
differ. For example, in Table 18.3 on page 588, Matt had a marginal tax rate of 28 percent 
 because that is the rate he paid on the last dollar of his income. But his average tax rate was:
a +21,617
+100,000b * 100 = 21.6%.
His average tax rate was lower than his marginal tax rate because the first $83,600 of his 
income was taxed at rates below his marginal rate of 28 percent.
When economists consider a change in tax policy, they generally focus on the 
 marginal tax rate rather than the average tax rate because the marginal tax rate is a bet-
ter  indicator of how a change in a tax will affect people’s willingness to work, save, and 
invest. For example, if Matt is considering working longer hours to raise his income, he 
will use his marginal tax rate to determine how much extra income he will earn after 
taxes. He will ignore his average tax rate because it does not represent the taxes he must 
pay on the additional income he earns. The higher the marginal tax rate, the lower the 
return he receives from working additional hours and the less likely he is to work those 
additional hours.
The Corporate Income Tax
The federal government taxes the profits earned by corporations under the corporate in-
come tax. Like the individual income tax, the corporate income tax is progressive, with 
the lowest tax rate being 15 percent and the highest being 35 percent. Unlike the indi-
vidual income tax, however, where relatively few taxpayers are taxed at the highest rate, 
many corporations are in the 35 percent tax bracket.
Economists debate the costs and benefits of a separate tax on corporate profits. The 
corporate income tax ultimately must be paid by a corporation’s owners—which are its 
shareholders—or by its employees, in the form of lower wages, or by its customers, in 
the form of higher prices. Some economists argue that if the purpose of the corporate 
income tax is to tax the owners of corporations, it would be better to do so directly by 
taxing the owners’ incomes rather than by taxing the owners indirectly through the cor-
porate income tax. Individual taxpayers already pay income taxes on the dividends and 
capital gains they receive from owning stock in corporations. In effect, the corporate 
income tax “double taxes” earnings on individual shareholders’ investments in corpora-
tions. An alternative policy that avoids this double taxation would be for corporations 
to calculate their total profits each year and send a notice to each shareholder, indicating 
the shareholder’s portion of the profits. The shareholder would then be required to in-
clude this amount as taxable income on his or her personal income tax. Under another 
alternative, the federal government could continue to tax corporate income through the 
corporate income tax but allow individual taxpayers to receive corporate dividends and 
capital gains tax-free. In 2003, Congress enacted a reduction on dividend and capital 
gains taxes to reduce double taxation.
International Comparison of Corporate  
Income Taxes
In the past 10 years, several countries have cut corporate income taxes to increase in-
vestment spending and growth. Table 18.4 compares corporate income tax rates in sev-
eral high-income countries. The tax rates given in the table include taxes at all levels 
of government. So, in the United States, for example, they include taxes imposed on 
corporate profits by state governments as well as by the federal government. The table 
shows that several countries, including Italy, Germany, and Ireland, significantly re-
duced corporate income tax rates between 2000 and 2010. Ireland, in particular, has 
been successful in using lower corporate income tax rates to attract foreign corpora-
tions to locate facilities there. Lower tax rates have led Microsoft, Intel, and Dell, among 
other U.S. firms, to base some of their operations in Ireland. The table also shows that 
corporate income tax rates are higher in the United States than in other high-income 
countries, except Japan.

 
The Tax System 
591
Evaluating Taxes
We have seen that to raise revenue, governments have available a variety of taxes. In select-
ing which taxes to use, governments take into account the following goals and principles:
• 
The goal of economic efficiency
• 
The ability-to-pay principle
• 
The horizontal-equity principle
• 
The benefits-received principle
• 
The goal of attaining social objectives
The Goal of Economic Efficiency In Chapter 4, we analyzed the effect that taxes 
have on economic efficiency. We briefly review that discussion here. Whenever a gov-
ernment taxes an activity, it raises the cost of engaging in that activity, so less of that 
activity will occur. Figure 18.3 uses a demand and supply graph to illustrate this point 
for a sales tax. As we saw in Chapter 4, a sales tax increases the cost of supplying a good, 
which causes the supply curve to shift up by the amount of the tax. In the figure, the 
equilibrium price rises from P1 to P2, and the equilibrium quantity falls from Q1 to Q2. 
When a good is taxed, less of it is produced.
The government collects tax revenue equal to the tax per unit multiplied by the 
number of units sold. The green-shaded rectangle in Figure 18.3 represents the govern-
ment’s tax revenue. Although sellers appear to receive a higher price for the good—P2—
the price they receive after paying the tax falls to P3. Because the price consumers pay has 
risen, consumer surplus has fallen. Because the price producers receive has also fallen,

Figure 18.3
The Efficiency Loss from  
a Sales Tax
This figure reviews the discussion from 
Chapter 4 on the efficiency loss from a tax. 
A sales tax increases the cost of supplying 
a good, which causes the supply curve to 
shift up, from S1 to S2. Without the tax, the 
equilibrium price of the good is P1, and the 
equilibrium quantity is Q1. After the tax is 
imposed, the equilibrium price rises to P2, 
and the equilibrium quantity falls to Q2. Af-
ter paying the tax, producers receive P3. The 
government receives tax revenue equal to the 
green-shaded rectangle. Some consumer sur-
plus and some producer surplus become tax 
revenue for the government, and some be-
come deadweight loss, shown by the yellow-
shaded triangle. The deadweight loss is the 
excess burden of the tax.

producer surplus has fallen. Some of the reduction in consumer surplus and  producer 
surplus becomes tax revenue for the government. The rest of the reduction in consumer 
surplus and producer surplus is equal to the deadweight loss from the tax and is shown 
in the figure by the yellow-shaded triangle. The deadweight loss from a tax is known as 
the excess burden of the tax. The excess burden is a measure of the efficiency loss to the 
economy that results from the tax having reduced the quantity of the good produced. A 
tax is efficient if it imposes a small excess burden relative to the tax revenue it raises.
To improve the economic efficiency of a tax system, economists argue that the gov-
ernment should reduce its reliance on taxes that have a high deadweight loss relative to 
the revenue raised. The tax on interest earned from savings is an example of a tax with 
a high deadweight loss because savings often comes from income already taxed once. 
Therefore, taxing interest earned on savings from income that has already been taxed is 
essentially double taxation.
There are other examples of significant deadweight losses of taxation. High taxes 
on work can reduce the number of hours an individual works, as well as how hard the 
individual works or whether the individual starts a business. In each case, the reduction 
in the taxed activity—here, work—generates less government revenue, and individuals 
are worse off because the tax encourages them to change their behavior.
Taxation can have substantial effects on economic efficiency by altering incentives 
to work, save, or invest. A good illustration of this effect can be seen in the large differ-
ences between annual hours worked in Europe and in the United States. Europeans typi-
cally work fewer hours than do Americans. According to an analysis by Nobel Laureate 
 Edward Prescott of Arizona State University, this difference was not always present. In the 
early 1970s, when European and U.S. tax rates on income were comparable, European and 
U.S. hours worked per employee were also comparable. Prescott finds that virtually all of 
the difference between labor supply in the United States and labor supply in France and 
 Germany since that time is due to differences in their tax systems.
Excess burden A measure of the 
efficiency loss to the economy that 
results from a tax having reduced the 
quantity of a good produced; also 
known as the deadweight loss.
Should the United States Shift  
from an Income Tax to a  
Consumption Tax?
A key issue in recent debates over tax policy is whether the 
federal government should shift from relying on an income tax to relying on a consump-
tion tax. Under the income tax, households pay taxes on all income earned. Under a 
consumption tax, households pay taxes only on the part of income they spend. House-
holds pay taxes on saved income only if they spend the money at a later time.
To see how a shift from an income tax to a consumption tax can affect the economic 
incentives individuals face, consider the following example: Suppose a 20-year-old is de-
ciding whether to save a $1,000 bonus paid by her employer. If she saves the $1,000 by 
putting it in a bank certificate of deposit (CD), the $1,000 and the interest she earns 
will both be taxed under the income tax, but neither will be taxed if the income tax is 
replaced by a consumption tax. Suppose she earns 6 percent per year on the CD and 
keeps it until she retires at age 70. With interest compounding tax free over 50 years, she 
will have accumulated $18,420 at age 70. Now suppose that under the income tax she is 
taxed at a rate of 33 percent. As a result, she will have only $670 of her bonus left after 
paying the tax. In addition, if she saves the money in a CD, her after-tax return each year 
is only 6 percent * (1 - 0.33) = 4 percent. Now saving her bonus in a CD at age 20 
yields only $4,761 at age 70. This big difference in accumulation—$13,659—is the tax 
burden on saving, a burden that makes saving less attractive.
Many economists argue that a taxpayer’s well-being is better measured by his or her 
consumption (how much he or she spends) than by his or her income (how much he or 
she earns). Taxing consumption may therefore be more appropriate than taxing income. 
Also, because the income tax taxes interest and other returns to saving, it taxes future con-
sumption—which is what current saving is for—more heavily than present  consumption. 
That is, under an income tax, current consumption is taxed more favorably than future 
consumption, reducing households’ willingness to save, as in the  preceding example.
Making 
the 
Connection
Would a consumption tax be more 
efficient than an income tax?

 
The Tax System 
593
The administrative burden of a tax represents another example of the deadweight 
loss of taxation. Individuals spend many hours during the year keeping records for in-
come tax purposes, and they spend many more hours prior to April 15 preparing their tax 
returns. The opportunity cost of this time is billions of dollars each year and represents 
an administrative burden of the federal income tax. For corporations, complexity in tax 
planning arises in many areas. The federal government also has to devote resources to 
enforcing the tax laws. Although the government collects the revenue from taxation, the 
resources spent on administrative burdens benefit neither taxpayers nor the government.
Wouldn’t tax simplification reduce the administrative burden and the deadweight 
loss of taxation? Yes. So why is the tax code complicated? In part, complexity arises be-
cause the political process has resulted in different types of income being taxed at dif-
ferent rates, requiring rules to limit taxpayers’ ability to avoid taxes. In addition, interest 
groups seek benefits, while the majority of taxpayers, who do not benefit, find it difficult 
to organize a drive for a simpler tax system.
The Ability-to-Pay Principle The ability-to-pay principle holds that when the gov-
ernment raises revenue through taxes, it is fair to expect a greater share of the tax bur-
den to be borne by people who have a greater ability to pay. Usually this principle means 
raising more taxes from people with high incomes than from people with low incomes, 
which is sometimes referred to as vertical equity. The federal income tax is consistent 
with the ability-to-pay principle. The sales tax, in contrast, is not consistent with the 
ability-to-pay principle because low-income people tend to spend a larger fraction of 
their income than do high-income people. As a result, low-income people will pay a 
greater fraction of their income in sales taxes than will high-income people.
The Horizontal-Equity Principle The horizontal-equity principle states that peo-
ple in the same economic situation should be treated equally. Although this principle 
seems desirable, it is not easy to use in practice because it is sometimes difficult to deter-
mine whether two people are in the same economic situation. For example, two people 
with the same income are not necessarily in the same economic situation. Suppose one 
person does not work but receives an income of $50,000 per year entirely from inter-
est received on bonds and another person receives an income of $50,000 per year from 
working at two jobs 16 hours a day. In this case, we could argue that the two people 
are in different economic situations and should not pay the same tax. Although policy-
makers and economists usually consider horizontal equity when evaluating proposals to 
change the tax system, it is not a principle they can follow easily.
The Benefits-Received Principle According to the benefits-received principle, people 
who receive the benefits from a government program should pay the taxes that support the 
Some economists oppose a shift from an income tax to a consumption tax because they 
believe a consumption tax will be more regressive than an income tax. These economists ar-
gue that people with very low incomes are able to save little or nothing and so would not be 
able to benefit from the increased incentives for saving that exist under a consumption tax.
Would a shift to a consumption tax be a radical change in the tax system? For many 
households, the answer is, perhaps surprisingly, “no.” Most taxpayers can already put 
part of their savings into accounts where the funds deposited and the interest received 
are not taxed until the funds are withdrawn for retirement spending—for example, 
401(k) plans and certain types of Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs). In effect, in-
dividuals whose savings are mainly in these retirement accounts are already paying a 
consumption tax rather than an income tax. Reductions in tax rates on dividends and 
capital gains—which are both returns to savings—and other incentives to expand saving 
have further increased the role of consumption taxation.

revenue through a general income tax paid both by boat owners and non-boat owners would 
be inconsistent with the benefits-received principle. Because the government has many pro-
grams, however, it would be impractical to identify and tax the beneficiaries of every program.
The Goal of Attaining Social Objectives Taxes are sometimes used to attain  social 
objectives. For example, the government might want to discourage smoking and drinking 
alcohol. Taxing cigarettes and alcoholic beverages is one way to help achieve this objective. 
Taxes intended to discourage certain activities are sometimes referred to as “sin taxes.”
Tax Incidence Revisited: 
The Effect of Price Elasticity
In Chapter 4, we saw the difference between who is legally required to send a tax pay-
ment to the government and who actually bears the burden of a tax. Recall that the 
actual division of the burden of a tax between buyers and sellers in a market is known as 
tax incidence. We can go beyond the basic analysis of tax incidence by considering how 
the price elasticity of demand and price elasticity of supply affect how the burden of a 
tax is shared between consumers and firms.
In Chapter 4, we discussed whether consumers or firms bear the larger share of a 
10-cents-per-gallon federal excise tax on gasoline. We saw that consumers paid the ma-
jority of the tax. We can expand on this conclusion by stating that consumers of gasoline 
pay a larger fraction of gasoline taxes than do sellers because the elasticity of demand 
for gasoline is smaller than the elasticity of supply. In fact, we can draw a general con-
clusion: When the demand for a product is less elastic than the supply, consumers pay the 
majority of the tax on the product. When demand for a product is more elastic than the 
supply, firms pay the majority of the tax on the product.
Figure 18.4 shows why this conclusion is correct. In Figure 18.4, D1 is inelastic be-
tween points A and B, and D2 is elastic between points A and C. With demand curve D1, 
the 10-cents-per-gallon tax raises the market price of gasoline from $4.00 (point A) to 
$4.08 (point B) per gallon, so consumers pay 8 cents of the tax, and firms pay 2 cents. 
With D2, the market price rises only to $4.02 (point C) per gallon, and consumers pay 
only 2 cents of the tax. With demand curve D2, sellers of gasoline receive only $3.92 per 
gallon after paying the tax. So, the amount they receive per gallon after taxes falls from 
$4.00 to $3.92 per gallon, and they pay 8 cents of the tax.
18.3 LEARNING OBJECTIVE
Understand the effect of price 
elasticity on tax incidence.
Tax incidence The actual division of 
the burden of a tax between buyers 
and sellers in a market.
Remember Not to Confuse Who Pays a 
Tax with Who Bears the Burden of the Tax
Consider the following statement: “Of course, I bear the 
burden of the sales tax on everything I buy. I can show 
you my sales receipts with the 6 percent sales tax clearly 
labeled. The seller doesn’t bear that tax. I do.”
The statement is incorrect. To understand why it is incor-
rect, think about what would happen to the price of a product 
if the sales tax on it were eliminated. Figure 18.4 shows that 
the price of the product would fall because the supply curve 
would shift down by the amount of the tax. The equilibrium 
price, however, would fall by less than the amount of the tax. 
(If you doubt that this is true, draw the graph to convince 
yourself.) So, the gain from eliminating the tax would be 
 received partly by consumers in the form of a lower price but 
also partly by sellers in the form of a new price that is higher 
than the amount they received from the old price minus the 
tax. Therefore, the burden from imposing a sales tax is borne 
partly by consumers and partly by sellers.
In determining the burden of a tax, what counts is not 
what is printed on the receipt for a product but what hap-
pens to the price of a product as a result of the tax.

Tax Incidence Revisited: The Effect of Price Elasticity  
595
Do Corporations Really Bear the Burden 
of the Federal Corporate Income Tax?
During the 2012 presidential election cam-
paign, hecklers at an Iowa appearance by 
former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney suggested that taxes 
on corporations be raised. Romney responded by saying, “Corpora-
tions are people, my friend.” The hecklers responded, “No, they’re 
not!” To which Romney responded, “Of course they are. Everything 
corporations earn ultimately goes to people. Where do you think it 
goes?” Romney was correct that corporations are legal persons in the 
eyes of the law. But what about the larger question: Who actually pays 
the corporate income tax? The incidence of the corporate income tax 
is one of the most controversial questions in the economics of tax pol-
icy. It is straightforward to determine the incidence of the gasoline tax 
using demand and supply analysis. Determining the incidence of the 
corporate income tax is more complicated because economists dis-
agree about how corporations respond to the tax.
A study by the Congressional Budget Office stated:
A corporation may write its check to the Internal Revenue Service for 
 payment of the corporate income tax, but the money must come from 
somewhere: from reduced returns to investors in the company, lower 
wages to its workers, or higher prices that consumers pay for the prod-
ucts the company produces.
Most economists agree that some of the burden of the corporate income tax is passed 
on to consumers in the form of higher prices. There is also some agreement that,  because 
the corporate income tax reduces the rates of return received by investors, it results in 
less investment in corporations. This reduced investment means workers have less capi-
tal available to them. As we discussed in Chapter 17, when workers have less capital, 
their productivity and their wages both fall. In this way, some of the burden of the cor-
porate income tax is shifted from corporations to workers in the form of lower wages. 
The deadweight loss or excess burden from the corporate income tax is substantial. A 
study by the Congressional Budget Office estimated that this excess burden could equal

The Effect of Elasticity on Tax 
Incidence
When demand is more elastic than supply, 
consumers bear less of the burden of a tax. 
When supply is more elastic than demand, 
firms bear less of the burden of a tax. D1 is 
inelastic between point A and point B, and 
D2 is elastic between point A and point C. 
With demand curve D1, a 10-cents-per-
gallon tax raises the equilibrium price from 
$4.00 (point A) to $4.08 (point B), so con-
sumers pay 8 cents of the tax, and firms pay 
2 cents. With D2, a 10-cents-per-gallon tax 
on gasoline raises the equilibrium price only 
from $4.00 (point A) to $4.02 (point C), so 
consumers pay 2 cents of the tax. Because in 
this case producers receive $3.92 per gallon 
after paying the tax, their share of the tax is 
8 cents per gallon.

Solving the Problem
Step 1: Review the chapter material. This problem is about both excess burden 
and tax incidence, so you may want to review the section “Evaluating Taxes,” 
which begins on page 591, and the section “Tax Incidence Revisited: The Ef-
fect of Price Elasticity,” which begins on page 594.
Step 2: Draw a graph to illustrate the relationship between tax incidence and 
 excess burden. Figure 18.4 on page 595 is a good example of the type of graph 
to draw. Be sure to indicate the areas representing excess burden.
Solved Problem 18.3
The Effect of Price Elasticity on the Excess  
Burden of a Tax
Explain whether you agree or disagree with the following 
statement: “For a given supply curve, the excess burden of 
a tax will be greater when demand is less elastic than when 
it is more elastic.” Illustrate your answer with a demand and 
supply graph.
more than half of the revenues raised by the tax. This estimate would make the corporate 
 income tax one of the most inefficient taxes imposed by the federal government.
As a consequence, economists have long argued for reform of the system of double tax-
ing income earned on investments that corporations finance by issuing stock. This income is 
taxed once by the corporate income tax and again by the individual income tax as profits are 
distributed to shareholders. Tax rates on dividends and capital gains were reduced in 2003, 
but whether to reduce double taxation further remains the subject of vigorous political debate.
Based on Ashley Parker, “‘Corporations Are People,’ Romney Tells Iowa Hecklers Angry Over His Tax Policy,” New York Times, 
August 11, 2011; and Congressional Budget Office, “The Incidence of the Corporate Income Tax,” CBO paper, March 1996.

Income Distribution and Poverty

Income Distribution and Poverty
In practice, in most economies, some individuals will have very high incomes, and some 
individuals will have very low incomes. But how unequal is the distribution of income 
in the United States today? How does this compare with the distribution of income in 
the United States in the past or with the distribution of income in other countries today? 
What determines the distribution of income? And, to return to an issue raised at the 
beginning of this chapter, how does the tax system affect the distribution of income? 
These are questions we will explore in the remainder of this chapter.
Measuring the Income Distribution and Poverty
Tables 18.5 and 18.6 show that the distribution of income clearly is unequal. Table 18.5 
shows that in 2010, while 13.7 percent of U.S. households had annual incomes less than 
$15,000, the top 21 percent of households had incomes greater than $100,000.  Table 18.6 
divides the population of the United States into five groups, from the 20 percent with the 
lowest incomes to the 20 percent with the highest incomes. The fraction of total income 
received by each of the five groups is shown for selected years. Table 18.6 reinforces the 
fact that income is unequally distributed in the United States. The first row shows that in 
2011, the 20 percent of Americans with the lowest incomes received only 3.7 percent of all 
income, while the 20 percent with the highest incomes received 54.6 percent of all income.
Table 18.6 also shows that over time, there have been some changes in the distribu-
tion of income. There was a moderate decline in inequality between 1936 and 1980, fol-
lowed by some increase in inequality during the years after 1980. We will discuss some 
reasons for the recent increase in income inequality later in this chapter.
18.4 LEARNING OBJECTIVE
Discuss the distribution of 
income in the United States 
and understand the extent of 
income mobility.
Step 3: Use the graph to evaluate the statement. As we have seen, for a given sup-
ply curve, when demand is more elastic, as with demand curve D2, the fall 
in equilibrium quantity is greater than when demand is less elastic, as with 
demand curve D1. The deadweight loss when demand is less elastic is shown 
by the area of the triangle made up of A, B, and C. The deadweight loss when 
demand is more elastic is shown by the area of the triangle made up of B, C, 
D, and E. The area of the deadweight loss is clearly larger when demand is 
more elastic than when it is less elastic. Recall that the excess burden of a tax 
is measured by the deadweight loss. Therefore, when demand is less elastic, 
the excess burden of a tax is smaller than when demand is more elastic. We 
can conclude that the statement is incorrect.

C H A P T E R  1 8  Public Choice, Taxes, and the Distribution of Income 
The Poverty Rate in the United States Much of the discussion of the distribution 
of income focuses on poverty. The federal government has a formal definition of pov-
erty that was first developed in the early 1960s. According to this definition, a family is 
below the poverty line if its annual income is less than three times the amount of money 
necessary to purchase the minimum quantity of food required for adequate  nutrition. 
In 2011, the poverty line was $22,350 for a family of four. Figure 18.5 shows the poverty 
rate, or the percentage of the U.S. population that was poor during each year between 
1960 and 2010. Between 1960 and 1973, the poverty rate declined by half, falling from 
22 percent of the population to 11 percent. In the past 40 years, however, the poverty 
rate has declined very little. In 2010 it was actually higher than it was in 1966.
Different groups in the population have substantially different poverty rates. 
Table 18.7 shows that while the overall poverty rate in 2010 was 15.1 percent, the 
rate among women who head a family with no husband present, among black people, 
and among Hispanic people was about twice as high. The poverty rates for white and 
Asian people as well as for married couples were below average.
Explaining Income Inequality
The novelists Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald supposedly once had a con-
versation about the rich. Fitzgerald said to Hemingway, “You know, the rich are dif-
ferent from you and me.” To which Hemingway replied, “Yes. They have more money.” 
 Although witty, Hemingway’s joke doesn’t help answer the question of why the rich have 
more money. In Chapter 17, we provided one answer to the question when we discussed 
the marginal productivity theory of income distribution. We saw that in equilibrium, each 
factor of production receives a payment equal to its marginal revenue product. The 
Poverty line A level of annual 
income equal to three times the 
amount of money necessary to 
purchase the minimum quantity of 
food required for adequate nutrition.
Poverty rate The percentage of the 
population that is poor according to 
the federal government’s definition.

Income Distribution and Poverty 
599
more factors of production an individual owns, and the more productive those factors 
are, the higher the individual’s income will be.
For most people, of course, the most important factor of production they own is 
their labor. Therefore, the income they earn depends on how productive they are and 
on the prices of the goods and services their labor helps produce. Baseball player Adrian 
Gonzales will earn a salary of $21 million in 2012 because he is a very productive player, 
and his employer, the Boston Red Sox, can sell tickets and television rights to the base-
ball games Gonzalez plays in for a high price. Individuals who help to produce goods 
and services that can be sold for only a low price earn lower incomes.
Many people own other factors of production as well. For example, many people 
own capital by owning stock in corporations or by owning shares in mutual funds that 
buy the stock of corporations. Ownership of capital is not equally distributed, and in-
come earned from capital is more unequally distributed than income earned from labor. 
Some people supply entrepreneurial skills by starting and managing businesses. Their 
income is increased by the profits from these businesses.
We saw in Table 18.6 that income inequality has increased during the past 25 years. 
Two factors that appear to have contributed to this increase are technological change 
and expanding international trade. Rapid technological change, particularly the devel-
opment of information technology, has led to the substitution of computers and other 
machines for unskilled labor. This substitution has caused a decline in the wages of un-
skilled workers relative to other workers. Expanding international trade has put U.S. 
workers in competition with foreign workers to a greater extent than in the past. This 
competition has caused the wages of unskilled workers to be depressed relative to the 
wages of other workers. Some economists have also argued that the incomes of low- 
income workers have been depressed by competition with workers who have immi-
grated to the United States illegally.
Most economists believe that changes in tax laws have not played a major role in 
recent changes in income inequality. As Figure 18.6 shows, federal income tax rates have 
changed dramatically during the years covered in Table 18.6. For example, the top mar-
ginal income tax rate was 91 percent in the 1950s; it declined to 70 percent in the 1960s 
and to 28 percent in the 1980s. The rate then rose to 39.6 percent in the 1990s before 
declining to 35 percent in 2003. Because tax rates changed significantly but the distribu-
tion of income has changed relatively little, it is unlikely that changes in tax rates have 
had a large impact on the distribution of income.
Finally, like everything else in life, earning an income is subject to good and bad 
luck. A poor person who becomes a millionaire by winning the state lottery is an ob-
vious example, as is a person whose earning power drastically declines as a result of 
a debilitating illness or accident. So, we can say that as a group, the people with high 
incomes are likely to have greater-than-average productivity and own greater-than- 
average amounts of capital. They are also likely to have experienced good luck. As a 
group, poor people are likely to have lower-than-average productivity and own lower-
than-average amounts of capital. They are also likely to have been unlucky.

C H A P T E R  1 8  Public Choice, Taxes, and the Distribution of Income 
Showing the Income Distribution with a Lorenz Curve
Figure 18.7 presents the distribution of income using Lorenz curves. A Lorenz curve 
shows the distribution of income by arraying incomes from lowest to highest on the 
horizontal axis and indicating the cumulative fraction of income earned by each frac-
tion of households on the vertical axis. If the distribution of income were perfectly 
equal, a Lorenz curve would be a straight line because the first 20 percent of households 
would earn 20 percent of total income, the first 40 percent of households would earn 
40 percent of total income, and so on. Panel (a) of Figure 18.6 shows a Lorenz curve for 
the actual distribution of income in the United States in 1980 and another curve for the 
distribution of income in 2011, using the data from Table 18.6. We know that income

In panel (a), the Lorenz curves show the distribution of income by arraying in-
comes from the lowest to the highest on the horizontal axis and indicating the 
cumulative fraction of income by each fraction of households on the vertical axis. 
The straight line represents perfect income equality. Because the Lorenz curve for 
1980 is closer to the line of perfect equality than the Lorenz curve for 2011, we 
know that income was more equally distributed in 1980 than in 2011. In panel 
(b), we show the Gini coefficient, which is equal to the area between the line of 
perfect income equality and the Lorenz curve—area A—divided by the whole 
area below the line of perfect equality—area A plus area B. The closer the Gini 
coefficient is to 1, the more unequal the income distribution.

was distributed more unequally in 2011 than in 1980 because the Lorenz curve for 2011 
is farther away from the line of equal distribution than is the Lorenz curve for 1980.
Panel (b) illustrates how to calculate the Gini coefficient, which is one way of sum-
marizing the information provided by a Lorenz curve. The Gini coefficient is equal to 
the area between the line of perfect income equality and the Lorenz curve—area A in 
panel (b)—divided by the whole area below the line of perfect equality—area A plus 
area B in panel (b). Or:
Gini coefficient = a
A
A + Bb.
If the income distribution were completely equal, the Lorenz curve would be the same 
as the line of perfect income equality, area A would be zero, and the Gini coefficient 
would be zero. If the income distribution were completely unequal, area B would be 
zero, and the Gini coefficient would equal 1. Therefore, the greater the degree of income 
inequality, the greater the value of the Gini coefficient. In 1980, the Gini coefficient for 
the United States was 0.403. In 2011, it was 0.468, which tells us again that income in-
equality increased between 1980 and 2011.
Problems in Measuring Poverty and the Distribution 
of Income
The measures of poverty and the distribution of income that we have discussed to this 
point may be misleading for two reasons. First, these measures are snapshots in time 
that do not take into account income mobility, which refers to changes in an individual’s 
or a family’s income over time. Second, they ignore the effects of government programs 
meant to reduce poverty.
Income Mobility in the United States We expect to see some income mobility. 
When you graduate from college, your income will rise as you assume a new job. A fam-
ily may be below the poverty line one year because the main wage earner is unemployed 
but may rise well above the poverty line the next year, when that wage earner finds a job. 
A medical student may have a very low income for several years but a very high income 
after graduating and establishing a medical practice. It is also true that someone might 
have a high income one year—perhaps from making a very profitable investment in the 
stock market—and have a much lower income in future years.
Statistics on income mobility are more difficult to collect than statistics on income 
during a particular year because they involve following the same individuals over a 
number of years. A study by the U.S. Census Bureau tracked the incomes of the same 
households for each year from 2004 to 2007. Figure 18.8 shows the results of the study. 
Each column represents one quintile—or 20 percent—of households, arranged by their 
incomes in 2004. Reading up the column, we can see where the households that started 
in that quintile in 2004 ended up in 2007. For example, the bottom quintile (the first 
column) consists of households with incomes of less than $22,367 in 2004 (all values 
are measured in 2007 dollars to correct for the effects of inflation). About 69 percent of 
these households were still in the bottom quintile in 2007. Only a small number—1.6 
percent—had moved all the way to the top quintile, but more than one-quarter had 
moved into either the second quintile or the middle quintile. At the other end of the 
income distribution, of those households in the top income quintile—with incomes of 
$92,886 or more—in 2004, only two-thirds were still in the top quintile in 2007. Given 
the relatively short time period involved, this study indicates that there is significant 
income mobility in the United States.
It should be noted that the U.S. economy experienced rapid growth between 2004 
and 2007, which may have increased the degree of income mobility. However, an earlier 
study by Peter Gottschalk of Boston College and Sheldon Danziger of the University 
of Michigan also provides evidence of significant income mobility. In that study, only 
47 percent of people who were in the lowest 20 percent of incomes in 1968 were still in 
the lowest bracket in 1991. More than 25 percent had incomes in 1991 that put them

in the middle- or higher-income brackets. Of those people who were in the highest-
income bracket in 1968, only 42 percent were still in the highest bracket in 1991. Almost 
8  percent of this group had fallen to the lowest-income bracket.
Another study by the U.S. Census Bureau found that of people who were poor at 
some time during the years 2004 to 2006, about half were in poverty for four months or 
less. Of the people who were poor in January 2004, only about 23 percent remained in 
poverty every month through December 2006. Only 2.8 percent of the U.S. population 
was poor every month during those three years.
Solving the Problem
Step 1: Review the chapter material. This problem is about income mobility, so you 
may want to review the section “Income Mobility in the United States,” which 
begins on page 601.
Step 2: Use the discussion in this chapter to evaluate the statement. Although 
it is true that the poverty rate in the United States is never below 10 percent, it 
is not the same 10 percent of the population that is in poverty each year. This 
Solved Problem 18.4
Are Many Individuals Stuck  
in Poverty?
Evaluate the following statement:
Government statistics indicate that 14 percent of the 
 population is below the poverty line. The fraction of the 
population in poverty has never dropped below 10 per-
cent. Therefore, more than 10 percent of the population 
must cope with very low incomes year after year.

States, 2004–2007
Each column represents one quintile—or 20 
percent—of households, arranged by their 
incomes in 2004. Reading up the column, 
we can see where the households that 
started in that quintile in 2004 ended up 
in 2007. Only 69 percent of the households 
that were in the bottom quintile of income 
in 2004 were still in the bottom quintile in 
2007. Only 68 percent of the households that 
were in the top quintile of income in 2004 
were still in the top quintile in 2007.

Income Distribution and Poverty 
603
The Effect of Taxes and Transfers A second reason the conventional statistics 
on poverty and income distribution may be misleading is that they omit the effects of 
government programs. Because of government programs, there is a difference between 
the income people earn and the income they actually have available to spend. The data 
in Tables 18.5 and 18.6 show the distribution of income before taxes are paid. We have 
seen that at the federal level, taxes are progressive, meaning that people with high in-
comes pay a larger share of their incomes in taxes than do people with low incomes. 
Therefore, income remaining after taxes is more equally distributed than is income 
 before taxes. The tables also do not include income from transfer payments individuals 
receive from the government, such as Social Security payments to retired and disabled 
people. The Social Security system has been very effective in reducing the poverty rate 
among people older than 65. In 1960, 35 percent of people in the United States over age 
65 had incomes below the poverty line. By 2010, only about 9 percent of people over 65 
had incomes below the poverty line.
Individuals with low incomes also receive noncash benefits, such as food stamps, 
free school lunches, and rent subsidies. The government’s Supplemental Nutrition As-
sistance Program, more commonly referred to as the food stamp program, has been a 
particularly important noncash benefit. Under this program, individuals with low in-
comes can buy, at a discount, coupons to purchase food in supermarkets. In 2011, more 
than 45 million people participated in this program, at a cost to the federal government 
of more than $70 billion. Because individuals with low incomes are more likely to re-
ceive transfer payments and other benefits from the government than are individuals 
with high incomes, the distribution of income is more equal if we take these benefits 
into account.
Income Distribution and Poverty  
around the World
How does income inequality in the United States compare with income inequality in 
other countries? Table 18.8 compares the ratio of total income received by the 20 percent 
of the population with the lowest incomes and the 20 percent with the highest incomes 
in several countries. The countries are ranked from most unequal to least unequal. As 
the table shows, poor countries, such as Bolivia and Paraguay, typically have more un-
equal distributions of income than does the United States. The distribution of income in 
the United States is less equal than in some moderate-income countries, such as Chile 
and Argentina, but it is more equal than in other moderate-income countries, such as 
Thailand and Brazil. The United States has the most unequal distribution of income of 
any high-income country in the world. Of course, we must be careful with such com-
parisons because transfer payments are not counted in income. For example, the Social 
Security and Medicare systems in the United States are much more generous than the 
corresponding systems in Japan but less generous than those in France and Germany.
chapter discusses one U.S. Census Bureau study that showed that only about 
69 percent of the people who were in the lowest 20 percent of the income dis-
tribution in 2004 were still in the lowest 20 percent in 2007. Another census 
study of the years from 2004 to 2006 showed that only 2.8 percent of the U.S. 
population was poor every month during those three years. Poverty remains 
a problem in the United States, but fortunately, the number of people who 
 remain in poverty for many years is much smaller than the number who are 
in poverty during any one year.

C H A P T E R  1 8  Public Choice, Taxes, and the Distribution of Income 
Although poverty remains a problem in high-income countries, it is a much larger 
problem in poor countries. The level of poverty in much of sub-Saharan Africa, in par-
ticular, is a human catastrophe. In 2011, the poverty line in the United States for a fam-
ily of four was an annual income of $22,350, but economists often use a much lower 
threshold income of $1 per day when calculating the rate of poverty in poor countries. 
As Table 18.9 shows, by this measure, according to estimates by Maxim Pinkovskiy of 
MIT and Xavier Sala-I-Martin of Columbia University, poverty declined from about 
27 percent of the world population in 1970 to 5 percent in 2006, the most recent year 
for which statistics are available. The greatest reduction in poverty has taken place in 
Asia. In East Asia, which includes China, the poverty rate dropped spectacularly from 
about 60 percent in 1970 to less than 2 percent in 2006. In South Asia, which includes 
 India, poverty rates dropped from 20 percent to less than 3 percent. Even in sub- 
Saharan  Africa, poverty decreased from 40 percent in 1970 to 32 percent in 2006. Why 
has  poverty fallen dramatically more in Asia than in Africa? The key explanation is that 
the countries of Asia have had higher rates of economic growth than have the countries 
of sub-Saharan Africa. Recent economic research demonstrates a positive relationship 
 between economic growth and the incomes of lower-income people.

Economics in Your Life
How Much Tax Should You Pay?
At the beginning of the chapter, we asked you to think about where government gets the money 
to provide goods and services and about whether you pay your fair share of taxes. After reading 
this chapter, you should see that you pay taxes in many different forms. When you work, you pay 
taxes on your income, both for individual income taxes and social insurance taxes. When you buy 
gasoline, you pay an excise tax, which, in part, pays for highways. When you buy goods at a local 
store, you pay state and local sales taxes, which the government uses to fund education and other 
services. Whether you are paying your fair share of taxes is a normative question. The U.S. tax sys-
tem is progressive, so higher-income individuals pay more in taxes than do lower-income individu-
als. In fact, as we saw in the Making the Connection on page 589, people in the lowest 40 percent 
of the income distribution pay no federal income taxes at all. You may find that you will not pay 
much in federal income taxes in your first job after college. But as your income grows during your 
career, so will the percentage of your income you pay in taxes.
Conclusion
The public choice model provides insights into how government decisions are made. 
The decisions of policymakers will not necessarily reflect the preferences of voters. At-
tempts by government to intervene in the economy may increase economic efficiency, 
as we saw in Chapter 5, but they may also lead to government failure and a reduction in 
economic efficiency.
A saying attributed to Benjamin Franklin states that “nothing in this world is cer-
tain but death and taxes.” But which taxes? As we saw at the beginning of this chapter, 
politicians continue to debate whether the government should use the tax system and 
other programs to reduce the level of income inequality in the United States. The tax 
system represents a balance among the objectives of economic efficiency, ability to pay, 
paying for benefits received, and achieving social objectives. Those favoring govern-
ment intervention to reduce inequality argue that it is unfair for some people to have 
much higher incomes than others. Others argue that income inequality largely reflects 
higher incomes resulting from greater skills and from entrepreneurial ability and that 
higher taxes reduce work, saving, and investment.
Many economists are skeptical of tax policy proposals intended to significantly re-
duce income inequality. They argue that a market system relies on individuals being 
willing to work hard and take risks, with the promise of high incomes if they are suc-
cessful. Taking some of that income from them in the name of reducing income in-
equality reduces the incentives to work hard and take risks. As we saw in Chapter 1, 
policymakers are often faced with a trade-off between economic efficiency and equity. 
Ultimately, whether policies to reduce income inequality should be pursued is a norma-
tive question. Economics alone cannot decide the issue.
An Inside Look at Policy on the next page discusses how many states and cities are 
considering taxing soft drinks.

Should a Tax on Soda Be Used to Reduce 
Budget Deficits?
THE GAZETTE
Taxing Soda Could 
Hit Lowest- Income 
Families Hardest, 
Study Says
As more budget-strapped states and 
cities consider taxing soda pop, the 
less educated and lower income 
households could be hit hardest, 
 according to a new study published by 
the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.
Iowa taxes soda as general 
 merchandise, and most other states 
tax such sweetened beverages as ei-
ther food or general merchandise. 
Many states and a few cities are now 
also considering special taxes on soft 
drinks based on the premise that they 
contribute to growing national health 
epidemics of obesity and diabetes.
 The Center for Science in the 
Public is supporting the drive to tax 
soda. It says several scientific studies 
have linked soft drinks to weight gain, 
and that frequent consumption is also 
linked to osteoporosis, tooth decay 
and erosion of tooth enamel. Weight 
gain is a risk factor for heart attacks, 
strokes, type two diabetes and cancer, 
the group says.
Legislation to expand soda taxa-
tion was filed in 17 states from 2009 
through 2010 according to the Rudd 
Center for Food Policy and Obesity 
at Yale University. Only Colorado and 
Washington passed new legislation, 
but with many states facing budget 
shortfalls the soft drink taxes are ex-
pected to come up again in 2011. . . .
 A study published in the March 
Chicago Fed Letter found that soda 
taxes will affect people differently de-
pending on how much soda they pur-
chase, where they buy it, the form of 
the soda tax, and whether they buy it 
with SNAP benefits, the  federal pro-
gram formerly known as food stamps.
The study found Americans living 
below poverty level obtain 9 percent of 
their daily calorie intake from “sugar 
sweetened beverages,” compared to 5.6 
percent for all Americans. Americans 
with less than a high school education 
obtained 7.4 percent of their calories 
from sugar sweetened beverages.
Sugar sweetened beverages were 
a significantly higher percentage of 
household food spending for less 
educated Americans than college 
graduates. College grads on average 
spend 1.9 percent of their food bud-
get on soft drinks, versus 3.22 percent 
for Americans without a high school 
diploma.
The effect of soda taxes on con-
sumption could depend heavily on 
the type of tax, the study found. Tax-
ing soda based entirely on price could 
cause Americans to switch from cans 
to less expensive brands or larger con-
tainers such as two-liter bottles, the 
study found, because large containers 
typically cost less per ounce.
Taxing soda by the ounce could 
cause consumers to switch to bever-
ages with a higher sugar content, the 
study found.
One way some tax proposals 
try to address the possible shifts in 
spending is by basing the tax solely on 
sugar content, according to  the study, 
authored by Chicago Fed  Senior 
Economist Leslie McGranahan and 
Northwestern University Associate 
Professor of Human Development 
 Diane Whitmore Schanzenbach . . . 
 The Center for Science in the 
Public Interest says a federal excise 
tax of one cent per 12-ounce serving 
of soda would raise about $1.5  billion 
per year, while taxing it at 8 cents per 
12-ounce serving would raise $11 bil-
lion. It proposes using the tax pro-
ceeds to fund education programs 
supporting healthier lifestyles. . . .

Key Points in the Article
As budget shortfalls loom in many states 
and cities, a tax on soft drinks is being 
viewed as a way to not only raise revenue 
but also reduce consumption of a product 
that contributes to obesity, diabetes, and 
other health problems. A study published 
by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago 
indicates that a soda tax would affect de-
mographic groups in different ways. For 
example, the percentage of food budgets 
spent on sugared beverages is lower for 
college graduates than for those without 
high school diplomas, and the caloric intake 
from soft drinks is highest for those living 
below the poverty level. So, the lowest-
income families would feel the greatest im-
pact from the implementation of a soda tax.
Analyzing the News
a In 2009, the U.S. Senate considered a 
proposal to place an excise tax on soda 
as a way to help pay for overhauling the na-
tion’s health care system. Although that 
proposal did not pass, several states are 
now considering a similar tax as a way to 
boost revenue during a time of budget 
shortfalls. Between 2009 and 2010, 
17 states filed legislation to implement 
some form of a soda tax, with Colorado and 
Washington passing versions of the tax. 
Proponents of the tax cite the health risks 
associated with sugared soft drinks and 
claim that the tax would reduce consump-
tion and improve health.
b A study conducted by Leslie 
 McGranahan of the Federal Reserve 
Bank of Chicago and Diane Whitmore 
Schanzenbach of Northwestern University 
indicates that a soda tax will affect people 
in different ways, depending on the amount 
of soda purchased, where and how it is pur-
chased, and the type of tax implemented. 
The study shows that the lowest-income 
families and people with less education 
consume the most soda and spend the 
highest fraction of their food budget on 
soda. As a consequence, these groups 
would feel the  greatest impact of a soda 
tax. With a regressive tax, people with lower 
incomes pay a higher percentage of their 
income in tax than do people with higher in-
comes. Because people with less education 
tend to earn less than those with more edu-
cation, the data indicate that a soda tax 
would be a regressive tax.
c The Center for Science in the Public In-
terest claims that an 8-cent tax on a 
12-ounce serving of soda would raise 
$11 billion per year. The figure below shows 
how an excise tax would affect the market 
for soda. The original equilibrium is at point 
A. The tax would shift the supply curve for 
soda up, from S1 to S2. The equilibrium price 
would increase from P1 to P2, and the equi-
librium quantity would decrease from Q1 to 
Q2. Point B is the new equilibrium point. The 
actual amount by which price and quantity 
would change depends on the price elastic-
ity of the demand and supply of soda, as we 
saw in this chapter. The article does not re-
port on the elasticity assumptions the Cen-
ter for Science in the Public  Interest made in 
computing its value of the revenue that 
would be raised by the tax. We do know, 
though, that the tax is expected to raise $11 
billion per year. If the price of a 12-ounce 
soda is $1, then the quantity sold each year 
must be $137.5  billion (because 
+0.08 * +137.5 billion = +11 billion). In the 
figure, the revenue from the tax equals the 
area of the green rectangle.
Thinking Critically  
about Policy
1. The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago 
study cited in the article indicates that 
a tax on soda could have the greatest 
effect on lower-income families. Some 
critics claim that the tax would not de-
ter consumption. Draw a demand and 
supply graph that represents the market 
for soda, assuming that the tax would 
not deter consumption. How does this 
assumption affect the equilibrium price 
and quantity of soft drinks and the inci-
dence of the tax?
2. Now assume that the demand for soda 
is perfectly elastic. Draw a demand and 
supply graph that represents this as-
sumption. How does this assumption af-
fect the equilibrium price and quantity of 
soft drinks and the incidence of the tax?
A tax decreases the supply of soda. The amount of revenue raised by the tax depends on the elasticity 
of the demand and the elasticity of supply of the drinks.

Summary
The public choice model applies economic analysis to govern-
ment decision making. The observation that majority voting may 
not always result in consistent choices is called the voting para-
dox. The Arrow impossibility theorem states that no system of 
voting can be devised that will consistently represent the underly-
ing preferences of voters. The median voter theorem states that 
the outcome of a majority vote is likely to represent the prefer-
ences of the voter who is in the political middle. Individuals and 
firms sometimes engage in rent seeking, which is the use of 
government action to make themselves better off at the expense 
of others. Although government intervention can sometimes im-
prove economic efficiency, public choice analysis indicates that 
government failure can also occur, reducing economic efficiency.

Problems and Applications
 
1.5 Will the preferences shown in the following table lead to a 
voting paradox? Briefly explain.
 
1.6 Many political observers have noted that Republican presi-
dential candidates tend to emphasize their conservative 
positions on policy issues while running for their party’s 
nomination, and Democratic presidential candidates tend 
to emphasize their liberal positions on policy issues while 
running for their party’s nomination. In the general elec-
tion, though, Republican candidates tend to downplay 
their conservative positions and Democratic candidates 
tend to downplay their liberal positions. Can the median 
voter theorem help explain this pattern? Briefly explain.
 
1.7 Briefly explain whether you agree with the following 
argument:
The median voter theorem will be an accurate 
predictor of the outcomes of elections when 
a majority of voters have preferences very 
 similar to those of the median voter. When the 
majority of voters have preferences very differ-
ent from those of the median voter, the median 
voter theorem will not lead to accurate predic-
tions of the outcomes of elections.
 
1.8 An article in the Economist magazine made the following 
observation:
People often complain that it is simplistic for 
economics to assume that individuals are ra-
tional and self-interested. Of course this is a 
simplification, but it is an enlightening one, 
and not flatly contradicted in the real world. 
The corresponding assumption about govern-
ment—that the state aims to maximize social 
welfare—is contradicted by the real world 
about as flatly as you could wish.
What does it mean for the state to “maximize the social 
welfare”? If policymakers are not attempting to maximize 
the social welfare, what are they attempting to do?
From “The Grabbing Hand,” Economist, February 11, 1999.
 
1.9 An article in the Economist magazine made the following 
observation: “In fact, as public choice theory shows, govern-

that can make the normal human mistakes of those deci-

but in the conditions under which they pursue their vari-
ous  interests.” Do you agree with this statement? Are there 
significant ways in which the business marketplace differs 
from the political marketplace?

Summary
Governments raise the funds they need through taxes. The most 
widely used taxes are income taxes, social insurance taxes, sales 
taxes, property taxes, and excise taxes. Governments take into ac-
count several important objectives when deciding which taxes to 
use: efficiency, ability to pay, horizontal equity, benefits received, 
and attaining social objectives. A regressive tax is a tax for which 
people with lower incomes pay a higher percentage of their in-
comes in tax than do people with higher incomes. A progressive 
tax is a tax for which people with lower incomes pay a lower per-
centage of their incomes in tax than do people with higher in-
comes. The marginal tax rate is the fraction of each additional 
dollar of income that must be paid in taxes. The average tax rate 
is the total tax paid divided by total income. When analyzing the 
impact of taxes on how much people are willing to work or save or 
invest, economists focus on the marginal tax rate rather than the 
average tax rate. The excess burden of a tax is the  efficiency loss to 
the economy that results from a tax having  reduced the quantity of 
a good produced.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE: Understand the effect of price elasticity on tax incidence.
Summary
Tax incidence is the actual division of the burden of a tax. In most 
cases, buyers and sellers share the burden of a tax levied on a good 
or service. When the elasticity of demand for a product is smaller 
than the elasticity of supply, consumers pay the majority of the tax 
on the product. When the elasticity of demand for a product is 
larger than the elasticity of supply, sellers pay the majority of the 
tax on the product.

“The actual incidence of a tax may have little to do with the 
legal specification of its incidence.” Briefly explain what 
this statement means and discuss whether you agree or 
disagree with it.

was paying a lower tax rate than his secretary. The “Buffett 
Rule” would set a new tax rate for those earning incomes of 
more than $1 million per year.
 
a. Looking at the table on page 589 for the percentage of 
federal taxes paid by the different income categories, is 
Mr. Buffett’s situation of paying a lower tax rate than 
his secretary typical of the highest 1 percent of U.S. 
 income earners?
 
b. According to an article in the New York Times,
“[Buffett’s] income comes mostly from his in-
vestments, which are taxed at the capital gains 
rate of 15 percent. His secretary is most likely 
paid a salary and bonus, which would be taxed 
as ordinary income, at a rate that goes as high 
as 35 percent.” What are capital gains? Which 
goals and principles of evaluating taxes are rel-
evant to considering whether the federal gov-
ernment should continue to tax capital gains 
at a lower rate than ordinary income? Briefly 
explain.

 2.10 [Related to the Making the Connection on page 592] 
Currently, the Social Security and Medicare programs are 
funded by payroll taxes rather than by the federal personal 
income tax. In 2011, the payroll tax for Social Security was 
12.4 percent on wage, salary, and self-employment income 
up to $106,800. (Half of the tax is collected from employers 
and half from employees. In 2011, the employee portion 
was temporarily reduced from 6.2 percent to 4.2 percent.) 
Above that income level, the tax dropped to zero. The 
Medicare tax was 2.9 percent on all wage, salary, and self-
employment income. Some economists and policymakers 
have proposed eliminating the payroll tax and shifting to 
funding Social Security and Medicare out of the federal 
personal income tax. Would this proposal make the federal 
income tax system as a whole more progressive or less pro-
gressive? Briefly explain.

the government is most interested in maximizing 
the revenue it receives from the tax. In this situation, 
should the government impose excise taxes on goods 
that are elastic or on goods that are inelastic?
 
c. Suppose that the government wants to discourage 
smoking and drinking alcohol. Will a tax be more ef-
fective in achieving this objective if the demand for 
these goods is elastic or if the demand is inelastic?

According to an article in the New York Times, during 2009 
some New Yorkers were deciding to buy existing condo-

One reason given was the following: “[Some buyers] seek 
to avoid the 1.825 percent transfer tax that buyers must pay 
on a brand-new condo. (In resales, the seller pays the tax.)” 
Analyze this reason for buying a resale rather than a new 
condo.

Income Distribution and Poverty, pages 597–605
 18.4 
LEARNING OBJECTIVE: Discuss the distribution of income in the United States and understand the extent of 
income mobility.
Summary
No dramatic changes in the distribution of income have occurred 
over the past 70 years, although there was some decline in inequal-
ity between 1936 and 1980, and there has been some increase in 
inequality between 1980 and today. A Lorenz curve shows the 
distribution of income by arraying incomes from lowest to high-
est on the horizontal axis and indicating the cumulative fraction of 
income earned by each fraction of households on the vertical axis. 
About 12 percent of Americans are below the poverty line, which 
is defined as the annual income equal to three times the amount 
necessary to purchase the minimum quantity of food required for 
adequate nutrition. Over time, there has been significant income 
mobility in the United States. The United States has a more unequal 
distribution of income than do other high-income countries. The 
poverty rate—the percentage of the population that is poor—has 
been declining in most countries around the world, with the impor-
tant exception of Africa. The marginal productivity theory of income 
distribution states that in equilibrium, each factor of production re-
ceives a payment equal to its marginal revenue product. The more 
factors of production an individual owns and the more productive 
those factors are, the higher the individual’s income will be.

explain.
 
4.2 Define poverty line and poverty rate. How has the poverty 
rate changed in the United States since 1960?
 
4.3 What is a Lorenz curve? What is a Gini coefficient? If a 
country had a Gini coefficient of 0.48 in 1960 and 0.44 
in 2012, would income inequality in the country have in-
creased or decreased?

Problems and Applications
 
4.7 [Related to Solved Problem 18.4 on page 602] Evaluate 
the following statement: “Policies to redistribute income 
are desperately needed in the United States. Without such 
policies, the more than 15 percent of the population that 
is currently poor has no hope of ever climbing above the 
poverty line.”
 
4.8 [Related to the Chapter Opener on page 581] In his 
column on MSNBC.com, Robert J. Samuelson wrote, “As 
for what’s caused greater inequality, we’re also in the dark. 
The Reagan and Bush tax cuts are weak explanations, be-
cause gains have occurred in pretax incomes. . . . Up to a 
point,  inequality is inevitable and desirable.”

it was in 2009, or did it become less equal? Briefly 
explain.
 
b. If area A = 2,150, area B = 250, and area C = 2,600, 
calculate the Gini coefficient for 2009 and the Gini 
 coefficient for 2010.
 4.10 Draw a Lorenz curve showing the distribution of income 
for the five people in the following table.
 4.12 Suppose that Congress and the president decide on a policy 
of bringing about a perfectly equal distribution of income. 
What factors might make this policy difficult to achieve? 
If it were possible to achieve the goal of this policy, would 
doing so be desirable?
 4.13 If everyone had the same income, would everyone have the 
same level of well-being?
 4.14 Suppose that a country has 20 million households. Ten 
million are poor households that each have labor mar-
ket earnings of $20,000 per year, and 10 million are rich 
households that each have labor market earnings of 
$80,000 per year. If the government enacted a marginal tax 
of 10 percent on all labor market earnings above $20,000 
and transferred this money to households earning $20,000 
or less, would the incomes of the poor rise by $6,000 per 
year? Explain.
 4.15 A U.S. Census Bureau report showed that 46 percent of 
households living below the poverty line owned their own 
homes, 76 percent lived in dwellings with air-conditioning, 
about 75 percent owned cars, and 62 percent had cable 
or satellite TV reception. All these levels are considerably 
higher than they were for households below the poverty 
line a generation ago, but the official poverty rate is virtu-
ally unchanged over this period, as Figure 18.5 on page 598 
shows. Going back to the official definition of poverty, how 
could ownership and purchases of these goods by the poor 
become more common while the poverty rate stayed the 
same?
 4.16 In a speech, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke 
made the following observation: “Although we Americans 
strive to provide equality of economic opportunity, we do 
not guarantee equality of economic outcomes, nor should 
we.” If the federal government wanted to, how could it 
“guarantee equality of economic outcomes”? If the gov-
ernment succeeded in making the distribution of income 
completely equal, what would be the benefits, and what 
would be the costs?
From “Remarks by Chairman Ben S. Bernanke before the Greater 
Omaha Chamber of Commerce, Omaha, Nebraska,” February 6, 2007.
 4.17 In an article in the Wall Street Journal, Edward Lazear of 
Stanford University was quoted as saying: “There is some 
good news. . . . Most of the inequality reflects an increase 
in returns to ‘investing in skills.’” Why would it be good 
news if it were true that most of the income inequality in 
the United States reflected an increase to returns in invest-
ing in skills?

Economics in Your Life
What’s the Best Country for You to Work In?
Suppose that an airline offers you a job after graduation in 2012. The firm has offices in Canada 
and China, and because you are fluent in English and Mandarin, you get to choose the country 
in which you will work and live. Gross domestic product (GDP) is a measure of an economy’s total 
production of goods and services, so one factor in your decision is likely to be the growth rate of 
GDP in each country. Based on the International Monetary Fund’s forecasts for 2012, GDP would 
increase by 2.6 percent in Canada but expand 9.5 percent in China. What effect do these two 
very different growth rates have on your decision to work and live in one country or the other? If 
China’s much larger growth rate does not necessarily lead you to decide to work and live in China, 
why not? As you read this chapter, see if you can answer these questions. You can check your 
 answers against those we provide on page 633 at the end of this chapter.
to firms such as Ford but also to workers 
wondering whether they will be able to keep 
their jobs and to college students wondering 
whether they will be able to find jobs when 
they graduate. One study found that during 
the slow recovery from the  2007–2009 reces-
sion, of those students who graduated from 
college in the spring of 2010, only 56  percent 
had found a job a year later. The average sal-
ary of those who did find a job was $27,000, 
down from an average of $30,000 for the 
classes of 2006 to 2008. What’s more, stu-
dents who graduate during recessions will 
continue to earn less for as long as 15 years 
after they graduate. The overall state of the 
economy is clearly important!
AN INSIDE LOOK AT POLICY on 
page 634 discusses how uncertain economic 
conditions in 2011 and 2012 kept demand 
for automobiles below initial sales estimates.
Based on Sharon Terlep and Mike Ramsey, “August 
Auto Sales Perk Up,” The Wall Street Journal, Septem-
ber 2, 2011; Catherine Rampell, “Many with New Col-
lege Degrees Find the Job Market Humbling,” The New 
York Times, May 18, 2011; and Lisa B. Kahn, “The Long-
Term Labor Market Consequences of Graduating from 
College in a Bad Economy,” Labour Economics, Vol. 17, 
No. 2, April 2010, pp. 303–316.
In the more than 100 years that Ford Motor 
Company has been in business, its experi-
ences have often mirrored those of the U.S. 
economy. So, it was no surprise that in the 
spring of 2009, with the U.S. economy suf-
fering from its worst downturn since the 
1930s, sales of Ford cars and trucks plum-
meted. In May 2009, Ford’s sales were down 
20 percent from a year earlier. Still, Ford 
was doing better than General  Motors and 
Chrysler, Ford’s two great American rivals, 
which had both declared bankruptcy. Those 
firms survived largely because the federal 
government invested more than $62 billion 
in them. While Ford suffered heavy losses, it 
did not require direct government aid.
By 2011, as the economy was slowly re-
covering from the downturn, Ford’s sales 
were rising. Ford and the automobile in-
dustry as a whole were  experiencing the ef-
fects of the business cycle, which refers to 
alternating periods of economic expansion 
and recession. Production and employment 
increase during expansions and fall during 
recessions.

activity is increasing is important not just

C H A P T E R  1 9  GDP: Measuring Total Production and Income
A
s we saw in Chapter 1, we can divide economics into the subfields of microeco-
nomics and macroeconomics. Microeconomics is the study of how households 
and firms make choices, how they interact in markets, and how the govern-
ment attempts to influence their choices.
Macroeconomics is the study of the economy as a whole, including topics such as infla-
tion, unemployment, and economic growth. In microeconomic analysis, economists gener-
ally study individual markets, such as the market for personal computers. In macroeconomic 
analysis, economists study factors that affect many markets at the same time. As we saw in 
the chapter opener, one important macroeconomic issue is the business cycle. The business 
cycle refers to the alternating periods of expansion and recession that the U.S. economy has 
experienced since at least the early nineteenth century. A business cycle expansion is a pe-
riod during which total production and total employment are increasing. A business cycle 
recession is a period during which total production and total employment are decreasing. In 
the following chapters, we will discuss the factors that influence the business cycle and poli-
cies the government may use to reduce its effects.
Another important macroeconomic topic is economic growth, which refers to the 
ability of an economy to produce increasing quantities of goods and services. Economic 
growth is important because an economy that grows too slowly fails to raise living stan-
dards. In some countries in Africa, very little economic growth has occurred in the past 
50 years, and many people remain in severe poverty. Macroeconomics analyzes both what 
determines a country’s rate of economic growth and the reasons growth rates differ so 
greatly across countries.
Macroeconomics also analyzes what determines the total level of employment in an 
economy. As we will see, in the short run, the level of employment is significantly affected 
by the business cycle, but in the long run, the effects of the business cycle disappear, and 
other factors determine the level of employment. A related issue is why some economies are 
more successful than others at maintaining high levels of employment over time. Another 
important macroeconomic issue is what determines the inflation rate, or the percentage 
increase in the average level of prices from one year to the next. As with employment, in-
flation is affected both by the business cycle and by other long-run factors. Finally, mac-
roeconomics is concerned with the linkages among economies: international trade and 
international finance.
Macroeconomic analysis provides information that consumers and firms need in or-
der to understand current economic conditions and to help predict future conditions. A 
family may be reluctant to buy a house if employment in the economy is declining be-
cause some family members may be at risk of losing their jobs. Similarly, firms may be 
reluctant to invest in building new factories or to undertake major new expenditures on 
information technology if they expect that future sales may be weak. For example, in 2011, 
H. J. Heinz announced that it would close three of its factories in the United States. Heinz 
made that decision because macroeconomic forecasts indicated that consumer demand 
for its ketchup and other food products would increase only slowly. Macroeconomic anal-
ysis can also aid the federal government in designing policies that help the U.S. economy 
perform more efficiently.
In this chapter and Chapter 20, we begin our study of macroeconomics by considering 
how best to measure key macroeconomic variables. As we will see, there are important is-
sues involved in measuring macroeconomic variables. We start by considering measures of 
total production and total income in an economy.
Microeconomics The study of how 
households and firms make choices, 
how they interact in markets, and how 
the government attempts to influence 
their choices.
Macroeconomics The study of the 
economy as a whole, including topics 
such as inflation, unemployment, and 
economic growth.
Business cycle Alternating periods 
of economic expansion and economic 
recession.
Expansion The period of a business 
cycle during which total production 
and total employment are increasing.
Recession The period of a business 
cycle during which total production 
and total employment are decreasing.
Economic growth The ability of 
an economy to produce increasing 
quantities of goods and services.
Inflation rate The percentage 
increase in the price level from one 
year to the next.

These headlines are from articles that appeared in the Wall Street Journal during 2011. 
Why is GDP so often the focus of news stories? In this section, we explore what GDP is 
and how it is measured. We also explore why knowledge of GDP is important to con-
sumers, firms, and government policymakers.
Measuring Total Production: Gross Domestic  
Product
Economists use gross domestic product (GDP) to measure total production. GDP is 
the market value of all final goods and services produced in a country during a period 
of time, typically one year. In the United States, the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) 
in the Department of Commerce compiles the data needed to calculate GDP. The BEA 
issues reports on the GDP every three months. GDP is a central concept in macroeco-
nomics, so we need to consider its definition carefully.
GDP Is Measured Using Market Values, Not Quantities The word value 
is important in the definition of GDP. In microeconomics, we measure production 
in quantity terms: the number of cars Ford produces, the tons of wheat U.S. farmers 
grow, or the number of passengers American Airlines transports. When we measure 
total production in the economy, we can’t just add together the quantities of every 
good and service because the result would be a meaningless jumble. Tons of wheat 
would be added to gallons of milk, numbers of passengers on flights, and so on. In-
stead, we measure production by taking the value, in dollar terms, of all the goods and 
services produced.
GDP Includes Only the Market Value of Final Goods In measuring GDP, we 
include only the value of final goods and services. A final good or service is one that is 
purchased by its final user and is not included in the production of any other good or 
service. Examples of final goods are a hamburger purchased by a consumer and a com-
puter purchased by a business. Some goods and services, though, become part of other 
goods and services. For example, Ford does not produce tires for its cars and trucks; 
it buys them from tire companies, such as Goodyear and Michelin. The tires are an 
 intermediate good, while a Ford truck is a final good. In calculating GDP, we  include 
the value of the Ford truck but not the value of the tire. If we included the value of 
the tire, we would be double counting: The value of the tire would be counted once 
when the tire company sold it to Ford and a second time when Ford sold the truck, 
with the tire installed, to a consumer.
GDP Includes Only Current Production GDP includes only production that 
takes place during the indicated time period. For example, GDP in 2012 includes 
only the goods and services produced during that year. In particular, GDP does not 
 include the value of used goods. If you buy a DVD of The Dark Knight Rises from 
 Amazon.com, the purchase is included in GDP. If six months later you resell the DVD 
on eBay, that transaction is not included in GDP.
19.1 LEARNING OBJECTIVE
Explain how total production is 
measured.
Gross domestic product (GDP) The 
market value of all final goods and 
services produced in a country during 
a period of time, typically one year.
Final good or service A good or 
service purchased by a final user.
Intermediate good or service A 
good or service that is an input into 
another good or service, such as a tire 
on a truck.

Solving the Problem
Step 1: Review the chapter material.  This problem is about gross domestic product, 
so you may want to review the section “Measuring Total Production: Gross 
Domestic Product” on page 617.
Step 2: Determine which goods and services listed in the table should be included 
in the calculation of GDP.  GDP is the value of all final goods and services. 
Therefore, we need to calculate the value of the final goods and services listed 
in the table. Eye examinations, pizzas, and textbooks are final goods. Paper 
would also be a final good if, for instance, a consumer bought it to use in a 
printer. However, here we are assuming that publishers purchase all the paper 
to use in manufacturing textbooks, so the paper is an intermediate good, and 
its value is not included in GDP.
Step 3: Calculate the value of the three final goods and services listed in the table. 
Value is equal to the quantity produced multiplied by the price per unit, so we 
multiply the numbers in column (1) by the numbers in column (2).

Step 4: Add the value for each of the three final goods and services to find GDP. 
GDP = Value of eye examinations produced + Value of pizzas produced 
+ Value of textbooks produced = +5,000 + +800 + +2,000 = +7,800.

Production, Income, and the Circular-Flow Diagram
When we measure the value of total production in the economy by calculating GDP, we 
are simultaneously measuring the value of total income. To see why the value of total 
production is equal to the value of total income, consider what happens to the money you 
spend on a single product. Suppose you buy an Apple iPad for $499 at a Best Buy store. 
All of that $499 must end up as someone’s income. Apple and Best Buy will receive some 
of the $499 as profits, workers at Apple will receive some as wages, the salesperson who 
sold you the iPad will receive some as salary, the firms that sell parts to Apple will receive 
some as profits, the workers for those firms will receive some as wages, and so on. Every 
penny must end up as someone’s income. (Note, though, that any sales tax on the iPad 
will be collected by the store and sent to the government, without ending up as anyone’s

income.) Therefore, if we add up the value of every good and service sold in the economy, 
we must get a total that is exactly equal to the value of all the income in the economy.
The circular-flow diagram in Figure 19.1 was introduced in Chapter 2 to illustrate 
the interaction of firms and households in markets. We use it here to illustrate the flow 
of spending and money in the economy. Firms sell goods and services to three groups: 
domestic households, foreign firms and households, and the government. Expenditures 
by foreign firms and households (shown as “Rest of the World” in the diagram) on do-
mestically produced goods and services are called exports. For example, American Air-
lines sells many tickets to passengers in Europe and Asia. As noted at the bottom of 
Figure 19.1, we can measure GDP by adding up the total expenditures of these groups 
on goods and services.
GDP can be measured by total expenditures on goods and services 
by households, firms, government, and the rest of the world.
GDP can be measured by total wages, interest, 
rent, and profits received by households.

 Figure 19.1  The Circular Flow and the Measurement of GDP
The circular-flow diagram illustrates the flow of spending and money in the 
economy. Firms sell goods and services to three groups: domestic households, 
foreign firms and households, and the government. To produce goods and ser-
vices, firms use factors of production: labor, capital, natural resources, and entre-
preneurship. Households supply the factors of production to firms in exchange 
for income in the form of wages, interest, profit, and rent. Firms make payments 
of wages and interest to households in exchange for hiring workers and other 
factors of production. The sum of wages, interest, rent, and profit is total income 
in the economy. We can measure GDP as the total income received by house-
holds. The diagram also shows that households use their income to purchase 
goods and services, pay taxes, and save. Firms and the government borrow the 
funds that flow from households into the financial system. We can measure GDP 
either by calculating the total value of expenditures on final goods and services or 
by calculating the value of total income.

620 
C H A P T E R  1 9  GDP: Measuring Total Production and Income
Firms use the factors of production—labor, capital, natural resources, and entrepre-
neurship—to produce goods and services. Households supply the factors of production to 
firms in exchange for income. We divide income into four categories: wages, interest, rent, 
and profit. Firms pay wages to households in exchange for labor services, interest for the 
use of capital, and rent for natural resources such as land. Profit is the income that remains 
after a firm has paid wages, interest, and rent. Profit is the return to entrepreneurs for 
organizing the other factors of production and for bearing the risk of producing and sell-
ing goods and services. As Figure 19.1 shows, federal, state, and local governments make 
payments of wages and interest to households in exchange for hiring workers and other 
factors of production. Governments also make transfer payments to households. Transfer 
payments include Social Security payments to retired and disabled people and unemploy-
ment insurance payments to unemployed workers. These payments are not included in 
GDP because they are not received in exchange for production of a new good or service. 
The sum of wages, interest, rent, and profit is total income in the economy. As noted at the 
top of Figure 19.1, we can measure GDP as the total income received by households.
The diagram also allows us to trace the ways that households use their income. 
Households spend some of their income on goods and services. Some of this spending is 
on domestically produced goods and services, and some is on foreign-produced goods 
and services. Spending on foreign-produced goods and services is known as  imports. 
Households also use some of their income to pay taxes to the government. (Note that 
firms also pay taxes to the government.) Some of the income earned by households is 
not spent on goods and services or paid in taxes but is deposited in checking or sav-
ings accounts in banks or used to buy stocks or bonds. Banks and stock and bond mar-
kets make up the financial system. The flow of funds from households into the financial 
system makes it possible for the government and firms to borrow. As we will see, the 
health of the financial system is vital to an economy. Without the ability to borrow 
funds through the financial system, firms will have difficulty expanding and adopting 
new technologies. In fact, as we will discuss in  Chapter 21, no country without a well-
developed financial system has been able to sustain high levels of economic growth.
The circular-flow diagram shows that we can measure GDP either by calculating 
the total value of expenditures on final goods and services or by calculating the value of 
total income. We get the same dollar amount of GDP with both approaches.
Components of GDP
The BEA divides its statistics on GDP into four major categories of expenditures: con-
sumption, investment, government purchases, and net exports. Economists use these 
categories to understand why GDP fluctuates and to forecast future GDP.
Personal Consumption Expenditures, or “Consumption” Consumption ex-
penditures are made by households and are divided into expenditures on services, such 
as medical care, education, and haircuts; expenditures on nondurable goods, such as food 
and clothing; and expenditures on durable goods, such as automobiles and furniture. 
The spending by households on new houses is not included in consumption. Instead, 
spending on new houses is included in the investment category, which we  discuss next.
Gross Private Domestic Investment, or “Investment” Spending on gross private do-
mestic investment, or simply investment, is divided into three categories. Business fixed invest-
ment is spending by firms on new factories, office buildings, and machinery used to produce 
other goods. Residential investment is spending by households and firms on new single-family 
and multi-unit houses. Changes in business inventories are also included in investment. Inven-
tories are goods that have been produced but not yet sold. If Ford has $200 million worth of 
unsold cars at the beginning of the year and $350 million worth of unsold cars at the end of 
the year, then the firm has spent $150 million on inventory investment during the year.
Government Consumption and Gross Investment, or “Government 
Purchases” Government purchases are spending by federal, state, and local govern-
ments on goods and services, such as teachers’ salaries, highways, and aircraft carri-
ers. Again, government spending on transfer payments is not included in government 
 purchases because it does not result in the production of new goods and services.
Transfer payments Payments by the 
government to households for which 
the government does not receive a 
new good or service in return.
Consumption Spending by 
households on goods and services, not 
including spending on new houses.
Investment Spending by firms 
on new factories, office buildings, 
machinery, and additions to 
inventories, plus spending by 
households and firms on new houses.
Government purchases Spending by 
federal, state, and local governments 
on goods and services.

 
Gross Domestic Product Measures Total Production  
621
Net Exports of Goods and Services, or “Net Exports” Net exports are equal 
to exports minus imports. Exports are goods and services produced in the United States 
and purchased by foreign firms, households, and governments. We add exports to our 
other categories of expenditures because otherwise we would not be including all spend-
ing on new goods and services produced in the United States. For example, if a farmer 
in South Dakota sells wheat to China, the value of the wheat is included in GDP be-
cause it represents production in the United States. Imports are goods and services pro-
duced in foreign countries and purchased by U.S. firms, households, and governments. 
We subtract imports from total expenditures because otherwise we would be including 
spending that does not result in production of new goods and services in the United 
States. For example, if U.S. consumers buy $1 billion worth of furniture manufactured 
in China, that spending is included in consumption expenditures. But the value of those 
imports is subtracted from GDP because the imports do not represent production in the 
United States.
An Equation for GDP and Some Actual Values
A simple equation sums up the components of GDP:
Y = C + I + G + NX.
The equation tells us that GDP (denoted as Y) equals consumption (C) plus investment 
(I) plus government purchases (G) plus net exports (NX). Figure 19.2 shows the values 
of the components of GDP for the year 2010. The graph in the figure highlights the fact 
that consumption is by far the largest component of GDP. The table provides a more 
detailed breakdown and shows several interesting points:
• 
Consumer spending on services is greater than the sum of spending on durable 
and nondurable goods. This greater spending on services reflects the continuing 
trend in the United States and other high-income countries away from the produc-
tion of goods and toward the production of services. As the populations of these 
countries have become, on average, both older and wealthier, their demand for 
services such as medical care and financial advice has increased faster than their 
demand for goods.
• 
Business fixed investment is the largest component of investment. As we will see in 
later chapters, spending by firms on new factories, computers, and machinery can 
fluctuate. For example, a decline in business fixed investment played an important 
role in the 2007–2009 recession.
• 
Purchases made by state and local governments are greater than purchases made by 
the federal government. Because basic government activities, such as education and 
law enforcement, occur largely at the state and local levels, state and local govern-
ment spending is greater than federal government spending.
Net exports Exports minus imports.
Remember What Economists Mean 
by Investment
Notice that the definition of investment in this chapter is 
narrower than in everyday use. For example, people often 
say they are investing in the stock market or in rare coins. 
As we have seen, economists reserve the word invest-
ment for purchases of machinery, factories, and houses. 
Economists don’t include purchases of stock or rare coins 
or deposits in savings accounts in the definition of invest-
ment because these activities don’t result in the produc-
tion of new goods. For example, a share of Microsoft stock 
 represents part ownership of that company. When you buy 
a share of Microsoft stock, nothing new is produced; there 
is just a transfer of that small piece of ownership of Micro-
soft. Similarly, buying a rare coin or putting $1,000 into a 
savings account does not result in an increase in produc-
tion. GDP is not affected by any of these activities, so they 
are not included in the economic definition of investment.

Imports are greater than exports, so net exports are negative. We will discuss in 
Chapter 29 why imports have typically been larger than exports for the U.S. 
economy.

As shown in the following figure, over time, consumption in the United States has 
increased as a fraction of GDP. Through the mid-1980s, consumption was less than 65 
percent of GDP. By the early 2000s, consumption had increased to 70 percent of GDP.

U.S. households financed this increased consumption partly by reducing saving and 
partly by increasing borrowing. While households were saving about 10 percent of their 
income in the mid-1980s, saving dropped to about 1 percent by 2005. Low saving rates 
were partly due to an increase in household wealth resulting from rising housing prices 
and rising stock prices. In many parts of the country, housing prices increased rapidly 
between 2001 and 2006. Stock prices, as measured by the Dow Jones Industrial Average 
and the S&P 500, reached record highs in October 2007. Some households felt less need 
to save out of their current incomes because their homes and their investments in the 
stock market were increasing in value.
During the early 2000s, many households borrowed against the increased value of 
their homes by taking out home equity loans, which many banks were increasingly will-
ing to grant. Banks and other financial firms also loosened the requirements for issu-
ing credit cards, so some households with flawed credit histories were able to borrow 
against their credit cards to finance their spending. The ratio of loans and other house-
hold debt to household income, which had been about 65 percent in the mid-1980s, 
rose to a record 133 percent in 2007 before declining to 102 percent in mid-2011.
Housing prices began to decline in 2006, and that decline accelerated with the start 
of the recession in December 2007. Stock prices also declined sharply. The combination 
of falling housing prices and falling stock prices wiped out trillions of dollars in house-
hold wealth. Banks and other financial institutions also tightened lending standards, 
making it more difficult for many households to borrow money. In the face of declining 
wealth and with reduced access to loans, household saving rates began to increase, ris-
ing above 6 percent by 2009.
As we will see in later chapters, increased household saving can be good news for 
the economy in the long run because it provides more funds that firms can borrow to 
finance investment, which can lead to more rapid rates of economic growth. But in the 
short run, in 2011, many firms—particularly firms such as Ford that sell consumer du-
rables—worried that the slow recovery from the 2007–2009 recession was due in part to 
the determination of U.S. households to cut back on spending and increase saving.

C H A P T E R  1 9  GDP: Measuring Total Production and Income
Measuring GDP Using the Value-Added Method
We have seen that GDP can be calculated by adding together all expenditures on final 
goods and services. An alternative way of calculating GDP is the value-added method. 
Value added refers to the additional market value a firm gives to a product and is equal to 
the difference between the price for which the firm sells a good and the price it paid other 
firms for intermediate goods. Table 19.1 gives a hypothetical example of the value added 
by each firm involved in the production of a shirt offered for sale on L.L.Bean’s Web site.
Suppose a cotton farmer sells $1 of raw cotton to a textile mill. If, for simplicity, we 
ignore any inputs the farmer may have purchased from other firms—such as cotton-
seed or fertilizer—then the farmer’s value added is $1. The textile mill then weaves the 
raw cotton into cotton fabric, which it sells to a shirt company for $3. The textile mill’s 
value added ($2) is the difference between the price it paid for the raw cotton ($1) and 
the price for which it can sell the cotton fabric ($3). Similarly, the shirt company’s value 
added is the difference between the price it paid for the cotton fabric ($3) and the price 
it receives for the shirt from L.L.Bean ($15). L.L.Bean’s value added is the difference be-
tween the price it pays for the shirt ($15) and the price for which it can sell the shirt on 
its Web site ($35). Notice that the price of the shirt on L.L.Bean’s Web site is exactly equal 
to the sum of the value added by each firm involved in the production of the shirt. We can 
calculate GDP by adding up the market value of every final good and service produced 
during a particular period. Or, we can arrive at the same value for GDP by adding up 
the value added of every firm involved in producing those final goods and services.
Does GDP Measure What We Want It 
to Measure?
Economists use GDP to measure total production in the economy. For that purpose, we 
would like GDP to be as comprehensive as possible, not overlooking any significant pro-
duction that takes place in the economy. Most economists believe that GDP does a good—
but not flawless—job of measuring production. GDP is also sometimes used as a measure 
of well-being. Although it is generally true that the more goods and services people have, 
the better off they are, we will see that GDP provides only a rough measure of well-being.
Shortcomings in GDP as a Measure of Total Production
When the BEA calculates GDP, it does not include two types of production: production 
in the home and production in the underground economy.
Household Production With few exceptions, the BEA does not attempt to estimate the 
value of goods and services that are not bought and sold in markets. If a carpenter makes and 
sells bookcases, the value of those bookcases will be counted in GDP. If the carpenter makes 
a bookcase for personal use, it will not be counted in GDP. Household production refers to 
goods and services people produce for themselves. The most important type of household 
production is the services a homemaker provides to the homemaker’s family. If a person has

been caring for children, cleaning the house, and preparing the family meals, the value of 
such services is not included in GDP. If the person then decides to work outside the home, 
enrolls the children in day care, hires a cleaning service, and begins buying the family’s meals 
in restaurants, the value of GDP will rise by the amount paid for day care, cleaning services, 
and restaurant meals, even though production of these services has not actually increased.
The Underground Economy Individuals and firms sometimes conceal the buying 
and selling of goods and services, in which case their production isn’t counted in GDP. Indi-
viduals and firms conceal what they buy and sell for three basic reasons: They are dealing in 
illegal goods and services, such as drugs or prostitution; they want to avoid paying taxes on 
the income they earn; or they want to avoid government regulations. This concealed buy-
ing and selling is referred to as the underground economy. Estimates of the size of the un-
derground economy in the United States vary widely, but it is probably at most 10  percent 
of measured GDP, or about $1.5 trillion. The underground economy in some low-income 
countries, such as Zimbabwe or Peru, may be more than half of measured GDP.
Is not counting household production or production in the underground economy 
a serious shortcoming of GDP? Most economists would answer “no” because the most 
important use of GDP is to measure changes in how the economy is performing over 
short periods of time, such as from one year to the next. For this purpose, omitting 
household production and production in the underground economy doesn’t matter be-
cause there is not likely to be much change in household production or the size of the 
underground economy from one year to the next.
We also use GDP to measure how production of goods and services grows over 
fairly long periods of a decade or more. For this purpose, omitting household produc-
tion and production in the underground economy may be more important. For exam-
ple, beginning in the 1970s, the number of women working outside the home increased 
dramatically. Some of the goods and services—such as childcare and restaurant meals—
produced in the following years were not true additions to total production; rather, they 
were replacing what had been household production.
Underground economy Buying and 
selling of goods and services that is 
concealed from the government to 
avoid taxes or regulations or because 
the goods and services are illegal.
Why Do Many Developing Countries 
Have Such Large Underground 
Economies?
Recent estimates put the size of the underground economy at 
8 percent of measured GDP in the United States and 13 percent in Western  Europe. The 
underground economy is much larger in many developing coun-
tries—perhaps 50 percent or more of measured GDP. In develop-
ing countries, the underground economy is often referred to as the 
informal sector, as opposed to the formal sector, in which output of 
goods and services is measured. Although it might not seem to 
matter whether production of goods and services is measured and 
included in GDP or unmeasured, a large informal sector can be a 
sign of government policies that are retarding economic growth.
Because firms in the informal sector are acting illegally, they 
tend to be smaller and have less capital than firms acting legally. 
The entrepreneurs who start firms in the informal sector may be 
afraid the government could someday close or confiscate their 
firms. Therefore, the entrepreneurs limit their investments in these 
firms. As a consequence, workers in these firms have less machin-
ery and equipment to work with and so can produce fewer goods 
and services. Entrepreneurs in the informal sector also have to pay the costs of avoiding 
government authorities. For example, construction firms operating in the informal sec-
tor in Brazil have to employ lookouts who can warn workers to hide when government 
inspectors come around. In many countries, firms in the informal sector have to pay sub-
stantial bribes to government officials to remain in business. The informal sector is large

Shortcomings of GDP as a Measure of Well-Being
The main purpose of GDP is to measure a country’s total production. GDP is also 
 frequently used, though, as a measure of well-being. For example, newspaper and 
 magazine articles often include tables that show the levels of GDP per person for 
 different countries, which is usually referred to as GDP per capita. GDP per capita is 
 calculated by dividing the value of GDP for a country by the country’s population. These 
articles imply that people in the countries with higher levels of GDP per capita are bet-
ter off.  Although increases in GDP often do lead to increases in the well-being of the 
population, it is important to be aware that GDP is not a perfect measure of  well-being 
for several reasons.
The Value of Leisure Is Not Included in GDP If an economic consultant de-
cides to retire, GDP will decline even though the consultant may value increased leisure 
more than the income he or she was earning running a consulting firm. The consultant’s 
well- being has increased, but GDP has decreased. In 1890, the typical American worked 
60 hours per week. Today, the typical American works fewer than 40 hours per week. If 
Americans still worked 60-hour weeks, GDP would be much higher than it is, but the 
well-being of the typical person would be lower because less time would be available for 
leisure activities.
GDP Is Not Adjusted for Pollution or Other Negative Effects of 
Production When a dry cleaner cleans and presses clothes, the value of this service 
is included in GDP. If the chemicals the dry cleaner uses pollute the air or water, GDP 
is not adjusted to compensate for the costs of the pollution. Similarly, the value of ciga-
rettes produced is included in GDP, with no adjustment made for the costs of the lung 
cancer that some smokers develop.
We should note, though, that increasing GDP often leads countries to devote more 
resources to pollution reduction. For example, in the United States between 1970 and 
2011, as GDP was steadily increasing, emissions of the six main air pollutants declined 
by more than 50 percent. Developing countries often have higher levels of pollution 
than high-income countries because the lower GDPs of the developing countries make 
them more reluctant to spend resources on pollution reduction. Levels of pollution in 
China are much higher than in the United States, Japan, or the countries of Western 
in some developing economies because taxes are high and government regulations are 
extensive. For example, firms in Brazil pay 85 percent of all taxes collected, as compared 
with 41 percent in the United States. Not surprisingly, about half of all Brazilian workers 
are employed in the informal sector. In Zimbabwe and Peru, the fraction of workers in the 
informal sector may be as high as 60 or 70 percent. One estimate put the size of the infor-
mal sector in India at nearly 50 percent.
Many economists believe taxes in developing countries are so high because these 
countries are attempting to pay for government sectors that are as large relative to their 
economies as the government sectors of industrial economies. Including transfer pay-
ments, government spending in Brazil, for example, is 41 percent of measured GDP, 
compared to 36 percent in the United States. In the early twentieth century, when the 
United States was much poorer than it is today, government spending was only about 
8 percent of GDP, so the tax burden on U.S. firms was much lower. In countries such 
as Brazil, bringing firms into the formal sector from the informal sector may require 
reductions in government spending and taxes. In most developing countries, however, 
voters are reluctant to see government services reduced.

Europe. According to the World Health Organization, 7 of the 10 most polluted cities 
in the world are in China, but as Chinese GDP continues to rise, the country is likely to 
devote more resources to reducing pollution.
GDP Is Not Adjusted for Changes in Crime and Other Social Problems 
An increase in crime reduces well-being but may actually increase GDP if it leads 
to greater spending on police, security guards, and alarm systems. GDP is also not 
adjusted for changes in divorce rates, drug addiction, or other factors that may affect 
people’s well-being.
GDP Measures the Size of the Pie but Not How the Pie Is Divided Up When 
a country’s GDP increases, the country has more goods and services, but those goods and 
services may be very unequally distributed. Therefore, GDP may not provide good infor-
mation about the goods and services consumed by the typical person.
To summarize, we can say that a person’s well-being depends on many factors that 
are not considered in calculating GDP. Because GDP is designed to measure total pro-
duction, it should not be surprising that it does an imperfect job of measuring well-being.
Did World War II Bring Prosperity?
The Great Depression of the 1930s was the worst economic 
downturn in U.S. history. GDP declined by more than 25 per-
cent between 1929 and 1933 and did not reach its 1929 level 
again until 1938. The unemployment rate remained at very 
high levels of 10 percent or more through 1940. Then, in 1941, the United States entered 
World War II. The graph below shows that GDP rose dramatically during the war years 
of 1941 to 1945. (The graph shows values for real GDP, which, as we will see in the next 
section, corrects measures of GDP for changes in the price level.) The unemployment 
rate also fell to very low levels—below 2 percent.
Traditionally, historians have argued that World War II brought prosperity back to the 
U.S. economy. But did it? Economist Robert Higgs argued that if we look at the well-being 
of the typical person, the World War II years were anything but prosperous. Higgs pointed 
out that increased production of tanks, ships, planes, and munitions accounted for most 
of the increase in GDP during those years. Between 1943 and 1945, more than 40 percent 
of the labor force was either in the military or producing war goods. As a result, between 
1939 and 1944, production of clothing, radios, books, and other consumption goods per 
person increased only about 2 percent, leaving the quantity of consumption goods avail-
able to the typical person in 1944 still below what it had been in 1929. With the end of the 
war, true prosperity did return to the U.S. economy, and by 1946, production of consump-
tion goods per person had risen by more than 25 percent from what it had been in 1929.

C H A P T E R  1 9  GDP: Measuring Total Production and Income
Real GDP versus Nominal GDP
Because GDP is measured in value terms, we have to be careful about interpreting 
changes over time. To see why, consider interpreting an increase in the total value of 
pickup truck production from $40 billion in 2012 to $44 billion in 2013. Can we be sure 
that because $44 billion is 10 percent greater than $40 billion, the number of trucks 
produced in 2013 was 10 percent greater than the number produced in 2012? We can 
draw this conclusion only if the average price of trucks did not change between 2012 
and 2013. In fact, when GDP increases from one year to the next, the increase is due 
partly to increases in production of goods and services and partly to increases in prices. 
Because we are mainly interested in GDP as a measure of production, we need a way of 
separating the price changes from the quantity changes.
Calculating Real GDP
The BEA separates price changes from quantity changes by calculating a measure of 
production called real GDP. Nominal GDP is calculated by summing the current values 
of final goods and services. Real GDP is calculated by designating a particular year as 
the base year and then using the prices of goods and services in the base year to calcu-
late the value of goods and services in all other years. For instance, if the base year is 
2005, real GDP for 2013 would be calculated by using prices of goods and services from 
2005. By keeping prices constant, we know that changes in real GDP represent changes 
in the quantity of goods and services produced in the economy.

World War II was a period of extraordinary sacrifice and achievement by the “great-
est generation.” But statistics on GDP may give a misleading indication of whether it 
was also a period of prosperity.

Solved Problem 19.3
Calculating Real GDP
Suppose that a very simple economy produces only the fol-
lowing three final goods and services: eye examinations, 
pizzas, and textbooks. Use the information in the table on 
the right to compute real GDP for the year 2013. Assume 
that the base year is 2005.
Solving the Problem
Step 1: Review the chapter material. This problem is about calculating real GDP, so you 
may want to review the section above, “Calculating Real GDP.” 
Step 2: Calculate the value of the three goods and services listed in the table, using 
the quantities for 2013 and the prices for 2005. The definition on this page 
tells us that real GDP is the value of all final goods and services, evaluated at 
base-year prices. In this case, the base year is 2005, and we are given informa-
tion on the price of each product in that year:

 
Real GDP versus Nominal GDP 
629
One drawback to calculating real GDP using base-year prices is that, over time, 
prices may change relative to each other. For example, the price of cell phones may fall 
relative to the price of milk. Because this change is not reflected in the fixed prices from 
the base year, the estimate of real GDP is somewhat distorted. The further away the cur-
rent year is from the base year, the worse the problem becomes. To make the calculation 
of real GDP more accurate, in 1996, the BEA switched to using chain-weighted prices, 
and it now publishes statistics on real GDP in “chained (2005) dollars.”
The details of calculating real GDP using chain-weighted prices are more compli-
cated than we need to discuss here, but the basic idea is straightforward: Starting with 
the base year, the BEA takes an average of prices in that year and prices in the following 
year. It then uses this average to calculate real GDP in the year following the base year 
(currently the year 2005). For the next year—in other words, the year that is two years 
after the base year—the BEA calculates real GDP by taking an average of prices in that 
year and the previous year. In this way, prices in each year are “chained” to prices from 
the previous year, and the distortion from changes in relative prices is minimized.
Holding prices constant means that the purchasing power of a dollar remains the 
same from one year to the next. Ordinarily, the purchasing power of the dollar falls every 
year, as price increases reduce the amount of goods and services that a dollar can buy.
Comparing Real GDP and Nominal GDP
Real GDP holds prices constant, which makes it a better measure than nominal GDP 
of changes in the production of goods and services from one year to the next. In fact, 
growth in the economy is almost always measured as growth in real GDP. If a headline 
in the Wall Street Journal states “U.S. Economy Grew 2.3% Last Year,” the article will re-
port that real GDP increased by 2.3 percent during the previous year.
We describe real GDP as being measured in “base-year dollars.” For example, with a 
base year of 2005, nominal GDP in 2010 was $14,527 billion, and real GDP in 2010 was 
$13,088 billion in 2005 dollars. Because, on average, prices rise from one year to the next, 
real GDP is greater than nominal GDP in years before the base year and less than nomi-
nal GDP for years after the base year. In the base year, real GDP and nominal GDP are the 
same because both are calculated for the base year using the same prices and quantities. 
Figure 19.3 shows movements in nominal GDP and real GDP between 1990 and 2010. In 
the years before 2005, prices were, on average, lower than in 2005, so nominal GDP was 
lower than real GDP. In 2005, nominal and real GDP were equal. Since 2005, prices have 
been, on average, higher than in 2005, so nominal GDP is higher than real GDP.

Step 3: Add up the values for the three products to find real GDP. Real GDP for 
2013 equals the sum of:
Quantity of eye examination in 2013 * Price of eye examinations in 2005 = +4,000
Quantity of pizza produced in 2013 * Price of pizzas in 2005 = +880
Quantity of textbooks produced in 2013 * Price of textbooks in 2005 = +1,800
or, +6,680
Extra Credit: Notice that the quantities of each good produced in 2005 were irrelevant 
for calculating real GDP in 2013. Notice also that the value of $6,680 for real GDP in 
2013 is lower than the value of $7,800 for nominal GDP in 2013 that we calculated in

C H A P T E R  1 9  GDP: Measuring Total Production and Income
The GDP Deflator
Economists and policymakers are interested not just in the level of total production, 
as measured by real GDP, but also in the price level. The price level measures the aver-
age prices of goods and services in the economy. One of the goals of economic policy 
is a stable price level. We can use values for nominal GDP and real GDP to compute a 
measure of the price level called the GDP deflator. We can calculate the GDP deflator 
by using this formula:
GDP deflator = Nominal GDP
Real GDP
* 100.
To see why the GDP deflator is a measure of the price level, think about what would 
happen if prices of goods and services rose while production remained the same. In 
that case, nominal GDP would increase, but real GDP would remain constant, so the 
GDP deflator would increase. In reality, both prices and production usually increase 
each year, but the more prices increase relative to the increase in production, the more 
nominal GDP increases relative to real GDP, and the higher the value for the GDP defla-
tor. Increases in the GDP deflator allow economists and policymakers to track increases 
in the price level over time.
Remember that in the base year (currently 2005), nominal GDP is equal to real 
GDP, so the value of the GDP price deflator will always be 100 in the base year. The fol-
lowing table gives the values for nominal and real GDP for 2009 and 2010:
2009

Currently, the base year for calculating GDP 
is 2005. In the years before 2005, prices 
were, on average, lower than in 2005, so 
nominal GDP was lower than real GDP. In 
2005, nominal and real GDP were equal. 
Since 2005, prices have been, on average, 
higher than in 2005, so nominal GDP is 
higher than real GDP.

Other Measures of Total Production and Total Income

From these values for the deflator, we can calculate that the price level increased by  
0.9 percent between 2009 and 2010:
a 111 - 110

b * 100 = 0.9%.
In Chapter 20, we will see that economists and policymakers also rely on another 
measure of the price level, known as the consumer price index. In addition, we will dis-
cuss the strengths and weaknesses of different measures of the price level.
Other Measures of Total Production 
and Total Income
National income accounting refers to the methods the BEA uses to track total production 
and total income in the economy. The statistical tables containing this information are 
called the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) tables. Every quarter, the BEA 
releases NIPA tables containing data on several measures of total production and total 
income. We have already discussed the most important measure of total production and 
total income: gross domestic product (GDP). In addition to computing GDP, the BEA 
computes the following four measures of production and income: gross national prod-
uct, national income, personal income, and disposable personal income.
Gross National Product (GNP)
We have seen that GDP is the value of final goods and services produced within the 
United States. Gross national product (GNP) is the value of final goods and services pro-
duced by residents of the United States, even if the production takes place outside the 
United States. U.S. firms have facilities in foreign countries, and foreign firms have facil-
ities in the United States. Ford, for example, has assembly plants in the United Kingdom, 
and Toyota has assembly plants in the United States. GNP includes foreign production 
by U.S. firms but excludes U.S. production by foreign firms. For the United States, GNP 
is almost the same as GDP. For example, in 2010, GDP was $14,527 billion, and GNP 
was $14,716 billion, or only about 1 percent more than GDP.
For many years, GNP was the main measure of total production compiled by the 
federal government and used by economists and policymakers in the United States. 
However, in many countries other than the United States, a significant percentage of 
domestic production takes place in foreign-owned facilities. For those countries, GDP is 
much larger than GNP and is a more accurate measure of the level of production within 
the country’s borders. As a result, many countries and international agencies had long 
preferred using GDP to using GNP. In 1991, the United States joined those countries in 
using GDP as its main measure of total production.
National Income
In producing goods and services, some machinery, equipment, and buildings wear 
out and have to be replaced. The value of this worn-out machinery, equipment, and 
buildings is depreciation. In the NIPA tables, depreciation is referred to as the con-
sumption of fixed capital. If we subtract this value from GDP, we are left with national 
income.
Previously in this chapter, we stressed that the value of total production is equal to 
the value of total income. This point is not strictly true if by “value of total production” 
we mean GDP and by “value of total income” we mean national income because na-
tional income will always be smaller than GDP by an amount equal to depreciation. In 
practice, though, the difference between the value of GDP and value of national income 
does not matter for most macroeconomic issues.

of total production and total 
income.

632 
C H A P T E R  1 9  GDP: Measuring Total Production and Income
Personal Income
Personal income is income received by households. To calculate personal income, we 
subtract the earnings that corporations retain rather than pay to shareholders in the 
form of dividends. We also add in the payments received by households from the gov-
ernment in the form of transfer payments or interest on government bonds.
Disposable Personal Income
Disposable personal income is equal to personal income minus personal tax payments, 
such as the federal personal income tax. It is the best measure of the income households 
actually have available to spend.
Figure 19.4 shows the values of these measures of total production and total income 
for the year 2010 in a table and a graph.
The Division of Income
Figure 19.1 on page 619 illustrates the important fact that we can measure GDP in terms 
of total expenditure or as the total income received by households. GDP calculated as 
the sum of income payments to households is sometimes referred to as gross domestic in-
come. Figure 19.5 shows the division of total income among wages, interest, rent, profit, 
and certain non-income items. The non-income items are included in gross domestic 
income because sales taxes, depreciation, and a few other small items are included in the 
value of goods and services produced but are not directly received by households as in-
come. Wages include all compensation received by employees, including fringe benefits 
such as health insurance. Interest is net interest received by households, or the differ-
ence between the interest received on savings accounts, government bonds, and other 
investments and the interest paid on car loans, home mortgages, and other debts. Rent 
is rent received by households. Profits include the profits of sole proprietorships, which 
are usually small businesses, and the profits of corporations. Figure 19.5 shows that the 
largest component of gross domestic income is wages, which are about three times as 
large as profits.

Conclusion
In this chapter, we have begun the study of macroeconomics by examining an impor-
tant concept: how a nation’s total production and income can be measured. Understand-
ing GDP is important for understanding the business cycle and the process of long-run 
economic growth. In the next chapter, we discuss the issues involved in measuring two 
other key economic variables: the unemployment rate and the inflation rate.

Economics in Your Life
What’s the Best Country for You to Work In?
At the beginning of the chapter, we posed two questions: What effect should Canada’s and China’s 
two very different growth rates of GDP have on your decision to work and live in one country or 
the other? And if China’s much higher growth rate does not necessarily lead you to decide to work 
and live in China, why not? This chapter has shown that although it is generally true that the more 
goods and services people have, the better off they are, GDP provides only a rough measure of 
well-being. GDP does not include the value of leisure; nor is it adjusted for pollution and other 
negative effects of production or crime and other social problems. So, in deciding where to live 
and work, you would need to balance China’s much higher growth rate of GDP against these other 
considerations. You would also need to take into account that although China’s growth rate is 
higher than Canada’s, Canada’s current level of real GDP is higher than China’s.

pectations” led to the reductions, Seth 
Weber, an RBC Capital analyst based 
in New York, said in an Aug. 16 re-
search note. . . .
GM, Ford Estimates
 
GM and Dearborn, Michigan–
based Ford forecast at least 13 million 
new-vehicle sales in 2011, including 
medium- and heavy- duty trucks. The 
U.S. averaged annual light-vehicle de-
liveries of 16.8 million vehicles from 
2000 to 2007, according to Autodata 
Corp., a Woodcliff Lake, New Jersey–
based research company.
“There’s a lot of turmoil in the 
business and turmoil means uncer-
tainty, so we’re a little unsure of these 
numbers,” Chief Executive Officer 
Dan Akerson of Detroit-based GM, 
told analysts Aug. 9. . . .

No ‘Snap Back’
  
J.D. Power sees a 12.1 million 
seasonally adjusted annualized rate 
for August. Analysts and automakers 
had been predicting a “snap back” in 
demand once inventories recovered 
from the March earthquake and tsu-
nami in Japan, which disrupted pro-
duction and led to shortages of parts 
and finished vehicles.
“We’re not seeing that snap back, 
and given all the variables out there 
it’s a lower probability that we’re going 
to see that happen this year,” Schuster 
said today.
Sales ran at a seasonally adjusted 
annualized rate of 12.2 million through 
the first two weeks of August, Edmunds 
.com said in an e-mailed statement. The 
Santa Monica, California–based re-
searcher still predicts 12.9 million deliv-
eries this year and 13.9 million in 2012.
J.D. Power’s estimate for full-year 
sales assumes that the industry will av-
erage a 12.8 million seasonally adjusted 
annualized rate in the last four months 
of the year, Schuster said. Lower gaso-
line prices and higher spending on sales 
incentives may help the sales pace accel-
erate to those levels late this year, he said.
If the pace of deliveries stays about 
flat, sales may finish the year at 12.4 mil-
lion, according to J.D. Power’s estimates.
“If August comes in at the level 
we’re expecting, that gives us a really 
clear indication that we’re running 
out” of time in 2011 “to get going 
again,” Schuster said.

2011 and led to shortages of parts and new 
vehicles worldwide. Analysts and automak-
ers had predicted that the market would 
“snap back” once these shortages had 
been eliminated, with demand for new ve-
hicles increasing in the second half of the 
year. According to J.D. Power’s Jeff Schus-
ter, “We’re not seeing that snap back, and 
given all the variables out there it’s a lower 
probability that we’re going to see that hap-
pen this year,” again reflecting uncertainty 
and the lack of consumer confidence in the 
U.S. economy.
Thinking Critically 
about Policy
1. The auto industry is cyclical: Auto 
sales rise during economic expansions 
and fall during economic recessions. 
Would you expect the same to be true 
of the markets for used vehicles and for 
 vehicle repairs?
2. Ford and General Motors estimated that 
new vehicle sales in the United States 
would top 13 million in 2011. This sales 
number included medium- and heavy-
duty trucks, which are more often pur-
chased by businesses than households. 
Which component of GDP is affected 
by purchases of new vehicles by busi-
nesses? Which component of GDP is 
affected by purchases of new vehicles 
by households?
incomes. Automobiles have high prices, 
and as Schuster stated in the article, “There 
just really isn’t a strong reason to go make 
that big-ticket purchase.” Falling automo-
bile sales reduce total consumption. Recall 
that consumption accounts for about 70 
percent of GDP. The figure below shows 
that by June 2009, GDP had fallen for four 
consecutive quarters. Falling consumption 
contributed to the decline in GDP during 
that period. GDP began to rise again by 
September 2009, but the increases in GDP 
began to slow down in 2010, dropping to 
only 1 percent by June 2011. The significant 
slowdown in the growth of real GDP in 
2011, as shown in the figure, reflects the 
lack of consumer confidence mentioned in 
the article and helps explain the lowered es-
timates for new car sales for the year.
b Following an increase in sales during 
2010, both General Motors and Ford ini-
tially estimated that U.S. sales of new cars 
and trucks would increase to more than 13 
million in 2011. Although the article does not 
mention any specific revised estimates from 
these companies, General Motors’s CEO 
Dan Akerson was quoted on August 9 as 
saying, “There’s a lot of turmoil in the busi-
ness and turmoil means uncertainty, so 
we’re a little unsure of these numbers.” His 
statement seems to summarize the eco-
nomic uncertainty discussed in the article.
c Initial estimates for new vehicle sales 
were lowered following the earthquake 
and tsunami that struck Japan in March 
Key Points in the Article
Citing declining consumer confidence 
in the economy, J.D. Power & Associ-
ates reduced its estimates for car and 
light truck sales in the United States by 
300,000 vehicles for 2011 and by 600,000 
for 2012. Other companies also announc-
ing lower estimated sales include Goldman 
Sachs, RBC Capital, IHS Automotive, and 
 JPMorgan Chase. Automakers and ana-
lysts had initially predicted an increase in 
new vehicle demand once inventories of 
new automobiles and auto parts stabilized 
following the March 2011 earthquake and 
tsunami in Japan, but uncertain economic 
conditions kept demand below the initial 
sales estimates.
Analyzing the News
a Jeff Schuster of J.D. Power & Associ-
ates cited the lack of consumer confi-
dence as a main reason for the decline in 
auto sales during the first half of 2011 and 
the lower estimates for the remainder of the 
year. In August, Bloomberg’s consumer 
comfort index was the weakest it has been 
since March 2009, and consumer confi-
dence in the economic outlook for the 
United States dropped to its lowest level 
since the recession. As you read in this 
chapter, automobiles are durable goods, 
and consumers are more likely to reduce 
purchases of durable goods when they are 
not confident about their jobs or their future

Summary
Economics is divided into the subfields of microeconomics—
which studies how households and firms make choices—and 
macroeconomics—which studies the economy as a whole. An 
important macroeconomic issue is the business cycle, which re-
fers to alternating periods of economic expansion and economic 
recession. An expansion is a period during which production and 
employment are increasing. A recession is a period during which 
production and employment are decreasing. Another important 
macroeconomic topic is economic growth, which refers to the 
ability of the economy to produce increasing quantities of goods 
and services. Macroeconomics also studies the inflation rate, or 
the percentage increase in the price level from one year to the next. 
Economists measure total production by gross domestic product 
(GDP), which is the value of all final goods and services produced 
in an economy during a period of time. A final good or service 
is purchased by a final user. An intermediate good or service is 
an input into another good or service and is not included in GDP. 
When we measure the value of total production in the economy 
by calculating GDP, we are simultaneously measuring the value of 
total income. GDP is divided into four major categories of expen-
ditures: consumption, investment, government purchases, and net 
exports. Government transfer payments are not included in GDP 
because they are payments to individuals for which the govern-
ment does not receive a good or service in return. We can also cal-
culate GDP by adding up the value added of every firm involved 
in producing final goods and services.

Review Questions
 
1.1 Why in microeconomics do we measure production in 
terms of quantity, but in macroeconomics we measure pro-
duction in terms of market value?
 
1.2 If the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis added up the val-
ues of every good and service sold during the year, would 
the total be larger or smaller than GDP?
 
1.3 In the circular flow of income, why must the value of total 
production in an economy equal the value of total income?

 1.12 [Related to the Making the Connection on page 622] 
An article on USAToday.com observed: “Consumer spend-
ing, once the driving force of the U.S. economy, is likely 
to remain stagnant for years as households struggle to 
cut debt and build up savings, economists say.” Why does 
 cutting debt and building up savings affect consumer 
spending? If consumer spending remains stagnant, what 
will be the likely effect on the economy?

 1.13 For the total value of expenditures on final goods and ser-
vices to equal the total value of income generated from 
producing those final goods and services, all the money 
that a business receives from the sale of its product must 
be paid out as income to the owners of the factors of pro-
duction. How can a business make a profit if it pays out as 
income all the money it receives?

local art store. The local art store sold all of the sculptures  
to local art collectors, at an average price of $1,000 each. 
For the 10 metal sculptures, what was the total value added 
of the artist, and what was the total value added of the local 
art store?
Summary
GDP does not include household production, which refers to 
goods and services people produce for themselves, nor does it in-
clude production in the underground economy, which consists of 
concealed buying and selling. The underground economy in some 
developing countries may be more than half of measured GDP. 
GDP is not a perfect measure of well-being because it does not 
include the value of leisure, it is not adjusted for pollution or other 
negative effects of production, and it is not adjusted for changes in 
crime and other social problems.

2.5 Michael Burda of Humboldt University in Germany and 
Daniel Hamermesh of the University of Texas examined 
how workers in the United States who lost their jobs be-
tween 2003 and 2006 spent their time. They discovered that 
during the period when they were unemployed, the decline 
in the number of hours of paid work done by these work-
ers was almost the same as the increase in the number of 
hours these workers devoted to household production. Do 
Burda and Hamermesh’s findings allow us to draw any con-
clusions about whether total production in the economy—
whether that production is included in GDP or not—fell 
when these workers became unemployed? Does your an-
swer depend on whether the household production they 
carried out while unemployed involved activities, such as 
child care, that the workers had been paying other people to 
perform before the workers lost their jobs? Briefly explain.

2.7 Roger Ransom and Richard Sutch, economic historians at 
the University of California, Riverside, have estimated that 
African-American farmers in the U.S. South after the Civil 
War worked about 30 percent fewer hours per year than they 
had as slaves during the years before the Civil War. If after 
the Civil War, African-American farmers had continued to 
work these additional hours, their production and income 
would have been higher and so would have been U.S. GDP. 
Would the farmers’ well-being also have been higher as a re-
sult of working these additional hours? Does your answer 
affect how we should interpret changes in U.S. GDP from 
before the Civil War to after the Civil War? Briefly explain.

2.8 [Related to the Making the Connection on page 625] 
A report of the World Bank, an international organiza-
tion devoted to increasing economic growth in develop-
ing countries, included the following statement: “Informal 
economic activities pose a particular measurement prob-
lem [in calculating GDP], especially in developing coun-
tries, where much economic activity may go unrecorded.” 
What does the World Bank mean by “informal economic 
activities”? Why would these activities make it harder to 
measure GDP? Why might they make it harder to evalu-
ate the standard of living in developing countries relative 
to the standard of living in the United States?
Based on The World Bank, World Development Indicators, (Washington, 
DC: The World Bank, 2003), p. 189.
 
2.9 Each year, the United Nations publishes the Human De-
velopment Report, which provides information on the 
standard of living in nearly every country in the world.

the Human Development Index (HDI). The HDI combines 
data on gross national income (GNI) per person with data

expected years of schooling. (GNI is a measure of the total 
income per person in a country.) The following table shows

Think about the increases since 2001 in spending for the 
Department of Homeland Security and the wars in Af-
ghanistan and Iraq. These increases represent government 
expenditures that have increased GDP. Briefly explain 
whether you think that these increases in GDP have made 
the typical person better off.
Summary
Nominal GDP is the value of final goods and services evaluated at 
current-year prices. Real GDP is the value of final goods and ser-
vices evaluated at base-year prices. By keeping prices constant, we 
know that changes in real GDP represent changes in the quantity of 
goods and services produced in the economy. When the price level, 
the average prices of goods and services in the economy, is increas-
ing, real GDP is greater than nominal GDP in years before the base 
year and less than nominal GDP for years after the base year. The 
GDP deflator is a measure of the price level and is calculated by di-
viding nominal GDP by real GDP and multiplying by 100.

Summary
The most important measure of total production and total income 
is gross domestic product (GDP). As we will see in later chapters, 
for some purposes, the other measures of total production and 
total income shown in Figure 19.4 are actually more useful than 
GDP. These measures are gross national product (GNP), national 
income, personal income, and disposable personal income.

Economics in Your Life
Should You Change Your Career Plans if You Graduate during a Recession?
Suppose that you are a sophomore majoring in either economics or finance. You plan to find a 
job in the banking industry after graduation. The economy is now in a deep recession, and the 
unemployment rate is the highest in your lifetime, at over 9 percent. Sizable layoffs have occurred 
in the banking industry. Should you change your major? Should you still consider a job in the bank-
ing  industry? As you read this chapter, see if you can answer these questions. You can check your 
 answers against those we provide on page 667 at the end of this chapter.
not return to more normal levels for at 
least another two years. Some economists 
were even more pessimistic and had begun 
speaking of the “new normal,” in which un-
employment might be stuck at high levels 
for many years.
In this chapter, we will focus on mea-
suring changes in unemployment as well 
as changes in the price level, or inflation. 
Because both unemployment and infla-
tion are major macroeconomic problems, 
it is important to understand how they are 
measured. In later chapters, we will ana-
lyze why unemployment remained so high 
in the years following the end of the 2007–
2009 recession. Read AN INSIDE LOOK 
on page 668 for a discussion of how the 
U.S. Postal Service considered layoffs, office 
closings, and termination of Saturday de-
liveries to deal with declining revenues and 
mounting debts.

Street Journal, September 13, 2011; and Frank Bruni, “The 
Fall This Summer,” New York Times, August 27, 2011.
When we study macroeconomics, we are 
looking at the big picture: total production, 
total employment, and the price level. Of 
course, the big picture is made up of mil-
lions of consumers, workers, and firms. Few 
industries have had as many problems in 
recent years as financial services, which in-
cludes businesses such as banks and broker-
ages. In September 2011, Bank of America, 
the second largest bank in the United States, 
announced that it would be laying off 30,000 
of its 288,000 employees. To some extent, 
the layoffs reflected the problems banks had 
been having since the financial crisis that 
began in 2008 and the particular problems 
that Bank of America had experienced.
But the layoffs also were an indication 
of how slowly the U.S. economy was recov-
ering from the economic recession of 2007–
2009. Although the recession had ended in 
June 2009, unemployment remained high 
more than two years later. Economists at 
the White House and the Federal Reserve 
were forecasting that unemployment would

nemployment and inflation are the macroeconomic problems that are most 
often discussed in the media and during political campaigns. For many peo-
ple, the state of the economy can be summarized in just two measures: the 
unemployment rate and the inflation rate. In the 1960s, Arthur Okun, who 
was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers during President Lyndon Johnson’s ad-
ministration, coined the term misery index, which adds together the inflation rate and the 
unemployment rate to give a rough measure of the state of the economy. As we will see in 
later chapters, although unemployment and inflation are important problems in the short 
run, the long-run success of an economy is best judged by its ability to generate high levels 
of real GDP per person. We devote this chapter to discussing how the government measures 
the unemployment and inflation rates. In particular, we will look closely at the statistics on 
unemployment and inflation that the federal government issues each month.
Measuring the Unemployment Rate, the 
Labor Force Participation Rate, and  
the Employment–Population Ratio
At 8:30 A.M. on a Friday early in each month, the U.S. Department of Labor reports its 
estimate of the previous month’s unemployment rate. If the unemployment rate is higher 
or lower than expected, investors are likely to change their views on the health of the 
economy. The result is seen an hour later, when trading begins on the New York Stock 
Exchange. Good news about unemployment usually causes stock prices to rise, and bad 
news causes stock prices to fall. The unemployment rate can also have important politi-
cal implications. In most presidential elections, the incumbent president is reelected if 
unemployment is falling early in the election year but is defeated if unemployment is 
rising. This relationship held true in 2004, when the unemployment rate was lower dur-
ing the first six months of 2004 than it had been during the last six months of 2003, and 
incumbent George W. Bush was reelected.
The unemployment rate is a key macroeconomic statistic. But how does the De-
partment of Labor prepare its estimates of the unemployment rate, and how accurate are 
these estimates? We will explore the answers to these questions in this section.
The Household Survey
Each month, the U.S. Bureau of the Census conducts the Current Population Survey (of-
ten referred to as the household survey) to collect data needed to compute the unem-
ployment rate. The bureau interviews adults in a sample of 60,000 households, chosen 
to represent the U.S. population, about the employment status of everyone in the house-
hold 16 years of age and older. The Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics 
(BLS) uses these data to calculate the monthly unemployment rate. People are consid-
ered employed if they worked during the week before the survey or if they were tem-
porarily away from their jobs because they were ill, on vacation, on strike, or for other 
reasons. People are considered unemployed if they did not work in the previous week 
but were available for work and had actively looked for work at some time during the 
previous four weeks. The labor force is the sum of the employed and the unemployed. 
The unemployment rate is the percentage of the labor force that is unemployed.
The BLS classifies people who do not have a job and who are not actively looking 
for a job as not in the labor force. People not in the labor force include retirees, home-
makers, full-time students, and people on active military service, in prison, or in mental 
hospitals. Also not in the labor force are people who are available for work and who have 
actively looked for a job at some point during the previous 12 months but who have 
not looked during the previous four weeks. Some people have not actively looked for 
work during the previous four weeks for reasons such as transportation difficulties or

childcare responsibilities. Other people who have not actively looked for work are called 
discouraged workers. Discouraged workers are available for work but have not looked for 
a job during the previous four weeks because they believe no jobs are available for them.
Figure 20.1 shows the employment status of the civilian working-age population in 
September 2011. We can use the information in the figure to calculate three important 
macroeconomic indicators:
• 
The unemployment rate. The unemployment rate measures the percentage of the 
labor force that is unemployed:
Number of unemployed
Labor force
* 100 = Unemployment rate. 
 
Using the numbers from  Figure 20.1, we can calculate the unemployment rate for 
 September 2011:
14.0 million
154.0 million * 100 = 9.1%.
• 
The labor force participation rate. The labor force participation rate measures 
the percentage of the working-age population that is in the labor force:
Labor force
Working@age@population * 100 = Labor force participation rate.
Discouraged workers People who 
are available for work but have not 
looked for a job during the previous 
four weeks because they believe no 
jobs are available for them.

 Figure 20.1  The Employment Status of the Civilian Working-Age Population, September 2011
In September 2011, the working-age population of the United States was 240.1 
million. The working-age population is divided into those in the labor force (154.0 
million) and those not in the labor force (86.1 million). The labor force is divided 
into the employed (140.0 million) and the unemployed (14.0 million). Those not in 
the labor force are divided into those not available for work (79.9 million) and those 
available for work but not currently working (6.2 million). Finally, those available 
for work but not in the labor force are divided into discouraged workers (1.0 mil-
lion) and those not currently looking for work for other reasons (5.2 million).

Solving the Problem
Step 1: Review the chapter material. This problem is about calculating the unem-
ployment rate and the labor force participation rate, so you may want to review 
the section “Measuring the Unemployment Rate, the Labor Force Participation 
Rate, and the Employment–Population Ratio,” which begins on page 642.
Step 2: Show that including the military decreases the measured unemployment 
rate. The unemployment rate is calculated as
Number of unemployed
Labor force
* 100.
 
Including people in the military would increase the number of people counted 
as being in the labor force but would leave unchanged the number of people 
counted as unemployed. Therefore, the unemployment rate would decrease.
Step 3: Show that including the military increases both the measured labor force 
participation rate and the measured employment–population ratio. The 
labor force participation rate is calculated as
Labor force
Working@age population * 100,
and the employment–population ratio is calculated as
Employment
Working@age population * 100.
 
Including people in the military would increase the number of people in the 
labor force, the number of people employed, and the number of people in the 
working-age population all by the same amount. This change would increase 
the labor force participation rate and the employment–population ratio be-
cause adding the same number to both the numerator and the denominator of 
a fraction that is less than one increases the value of the fraction.
Solved Problem 20.1
What Happens if  
You Include the Military?
In the BLS household survey, people on active military 
 service are not included in the totals for employment, the 
labor force, or the working-age population. Suppose peo-
ple in the military were included in these categories. How 
would the unemployment rate, the labor force participation 
rate, and the employment–population ratio change?

Problems with Measuring the Unemployment Rate
Although the BLS reports the unemployment rate measured to the tenth of a percentage 
point, it is not a perfect measure of the current state of joblessness in the economy. One 
problem that the BLS confronts is distinguishing between the unemployed and people 
who are not in the labor force. During an economic recession, for example, an increase 
in discouraged workers usually occurs, as people who have had trouble finding a job stop 
actively looking. Because these workers are not counted as unemployed, the unemploy-
ment rate as measured by the BLS may understate the true degree of joblessness in the 
economy. The BLS also counts people as being employed if they hold part-time jobs even 
though they would prefer to hold full-time jobs. In a recession, counting as “employed” a 
part-time worker who wants to work full time tends to understate the degree of jobless-
ness in the economy and make the employment situation appear better than it is.
Not counting discouraged workers as unemployed and counting people as 
 employed who are working part time, although they would prefer to be working full 
time, has a substantial effect on the measured unemployment rate. In Figure 20.2, the 
red line shows the official measure of the unemployment rate and the blue line shows 
what the unemployment rate would be if the BLS had counted as unemployed all peo-
ple who were available for work but not actively looking for jobs and all people who 
were in part-time jobs but wanted full-time jobs. The difference between the two mea-
sures of the unemployment rate is substantial and was particularly large during the 
2007–2009 recession and the slow recovery that followed the recession. For example, in 
 September 2011, using the broader definition of unemployment would have increased 
the  measured unemployment rate from 9.1 percent to 16.5 percent.
 
To see why this is true, consider the following simple example. Suppose that 
100,000,000 people are in the working-age population and 50,000,000 are in 
the labor force, not counting people in the military. Suppose that 1,000,000 
people are in the military. Then, the labor force participation rate excluding 
the military is
50,000,000
100,000,000 * 100 = 50%,
 
and the labor force participation rate including the military is
51,000,000
101,000,000 * 100 = 50.5%.
 
A similar calculation shows that including the military would increase the 
employment–population ratio.

C H A P T E R  2 0  Unemployment and Inflation 
There are other measurement problems, however, that cause the measured unem-
ployment rate to overstate the true extent of joblessness. These problems arise because 
the household survey does not verify the responses of people included in the survey. 
Some people who claim to be unemployed and actively looking for work may not be 
actively looking. A person might claim to be actively looking for a job to remain eli-
gible for government payments to the unemployed. In this case, a person who is actually 
not in the labor force is counted as unemployed. Other people might be employed but 
engaged in illegal activity—such as drug dealing—or might want to conceal a legiti-
mate job to avoid paying taxes. In these cases, individuals who are actually employed are 
counted as unemployed. These inaccurate responses to the survey bias the unemploy-
ment rate as measured by the BLS toward overstating the true extent of joblessness. We 
can conclude that, although the unemployment rate provides some useful information 
about the employment situation in the country, it is far from an exact measure of job-
lessness in the economy.
Trends in Labor Force Participation
The labor force participation rate is important because it determines the amount of 
 labor that will be available to the economy from a given population. The higher the  labor 
force participation rate, the more labor that will be available and the higher a country’s 
levels of GDP and GDP per person. Figure 20.3 highlights two important trends in the 
labor force participation rates of adults aged 16 and over in the United States since 1948: 
the rising labor force participation rate of adult women and the falling labor force par-
ticipation rate of adult men.
The labor force participation rate of adult males has fallen from 87 percent in 
1948 to 71 percent in 2010. Most of this decline is due to older men retiring earlier and 
younger men remaining in school longer. There has also been a decline in labor force 
participation among males who are not in school but who are too young to retire. Over 
the longer term, this decline appears to be partly due to Congress having made it easier 
for people to receive cash payments under the Social Security Disability Insurance pro-
gram. In the shorter term, the decline is due to the severity of the 2007–2009 recession 
and the weakness of the recovery following the recession.
The decline in labor force participation among adult men has been more than offset 
by a sharp increase in the labor force participation rate for adult women, which rose 
from 33 percent in 1948 to 59 percent in 2010. As a result, the overall labor force par-
ticipation rate rose from 59 percent in 1948 to 65 percent in 2010. The increase in the

Trends in the Labor Force: 
Participation Rates of Adult 
Men and Women since 1948
The labor force participation rate of adult men 
has declined gradually since 1948, but the 
labor force participation rate of adult women 
has increased significantly, making the over-
all labor force participation rate higher today 
than it was in 1948.

labor force participation rate of women has several causes, including changing social 
 attitudes due in part to the women’s movement, federal legislation outlawing discrimi-
nation,  increasing wages for women, and the typical family having fewer children.
Unemployment Rates for Different Groups
Different groups in the population can have very different unemployment rates.  
Figure 20.4 shows unemployment rates in September 2011 for different ethnic groups 
and for groups with different levels of educational attainment. While the overall unem-
ployment rate was 9.1 percent, Asians had an unemployment rate of 7.8 percent, and 
African Americans had an unemployment rate of 16.0 percent. The unemployment rate 
for people over age 25 without a high school degree was 14.0 percent, while the unem-
ployment rate for college graduates was only 4.2 percent.
How Long Are People Typically Unemployed?
The longer a person is unemployed, the greater the hardship. During the Great Depres-
sion of the 1930s, some people were unemployed for years at a time. In the modern U.S. 
economy, the typical unemployed person stays unemployed for a relatively brief period of 
time, although that time lengthens significantly during a severe recession. For example, in 
April 2007—which was during a period of economic expansion—82 percent of the people 
who were unemployed had been unemployed for less than six months. In September 2011, 
after the end of the 2007–2009 recession, but during a time when the economy was grow-
ing slowly, only 55 percent of the unemployed had been jobless for less than six months. 
The average period of unemployment was only 17 weeks in April 2007 but was 41 weeks 
in September 2011. The severity of unemployment during and after the 2007–2009 reces-
sion was a sharp break with the normal U.S. experience where the typical person who 
loses a job will find another one or be recalled to a previous job within a few months.

How Unusual Was the Unemployment 
Situation Following the 2007–2009 
Recession?
The Great Depression of the 1930s left its mark on nearly 
 everyone who lived through it. The Depression began in August 1929, became worse 
 after the stock market crash of October 1929, and reached its low point in 1933, 
 following the collapse of the banking system. Real GDP declined by more than 25 per-
cent  between 1929 and 1933—the largest drop ever recorded. The unemployment rate 
in 1933 was above 20 percent—the highest rate ever recorded. The unemployment 
rate did not return to its 1929 level until 1942, the year after the United States entered 
World War II. With the unemployment rate so high for so long, many people were out 
of work for years. As one historian put it, “What was distinctive about the Great Depres-
sion, in fact, was . . . the extraordinary lengths of time that most jobless men and women 
 remained out of work.”
By the 2000s, many people in the United States, including most economists and poli-
cymakers, believed that prolonged periods of unemployment such as the U.S. economy 
had suffered from during the 1930s were very unlikely to happen again. Although the 
1981–1982 recession had been severe and the unemployment rate had risen above 10 per-
cent for the first time since the 1930s, the recovery was strong, and many unemployed 
workers found new jobs relatively quickly. So, following the 2007–2009 recession, most 
economists and policymakers were unprepared for how slowly the unemployment rate 
declined and for how much the average period of unemployment rose. During the 1981–
1982 recession, the unemployment rate peaked at 10.8 percent in December 1982, but  
23 months later, in November 1984, it had already declined to 7.2 percent. In contrast, af-
ter the recession of 2007–2009, the unemployment rate peaked at 10.1 percent in October 
2009, while 23 months later, it had declined by only 1 percentage point, to 9.1 percent. The 
figure below shows that the average period of unemployment was twice as high following 
the 2007–2009 recession as following any other recession since the end of World War II.

Unemployment was so persistent and widespread that a survey taken by the Pew 
Research Center in the spring of 2011 found that more than half of all households had 
experienced at least one member losing his or her job during the previous year. Another 
Pew survey taken in June 2011 found that more than half of people with jobs expected 
to receive a pay cut or to lose their job during the next year.
As we have seen, one drawback to the unemployment data is that workers who drop 
out of the labor market stop being counted as unemployed. As a result, some economists 
focus on the employment–population ratio because it measures the fraction of the popu-
lation that has jobs. The figure on the next page shows the employment–population ratio 
for the period 1948 to 2011. The overall upward trend of the ratio reflects the increased 
labor force participation rate of women. In each recession, the employment– population

The Establishment Survey: Another 
Measure of Employment
In addition to the household survey, the BLS uses the establishment survey, sometimes 
called the payroll survey, to measure total employment in the economy. This monthly 
survey samples about 300,000 business establishments (such as factories, stores, and of-
fices). A small company typically operates only one establishment, but a large company 
may operate many establishments. The establishment survey provides information on 
the total number of persons who are employed and on a company payroll. The establish-
ment survey has four drawbacks. First, the survey does not provide information on the 
number of self-employed persons because they are not on a company payroll. Second, 
the survey may fail to count some persons employed at newly opened firms that are 
not included in the survey. Third, the survey provides no information on unemploy-
ment. Fourth, the initial employment values for the establishment survey can be sig-
nificantly revised as data from additional establishments become available. Despite these 
drawbacks, the establishment survey has the advantage of being determined by actual 
payrolls rather than by unverified answers, as is the case with the household survey. In 
recent years, some economists have come to rely more on establishment survey data than 
on household survey data in analyzing current labor market conditions. Some financial 
analysts who forecast the future state of the economy to help forecast stock prices have 
also begun to rely more on establishment survey data than on household survey data.
Table 20.1 shows household survey and establishment survey data for the months of 
August and September 2011. Notice that the household survey, because it includes the 
ratio falls as some workers lose their jobs. The fall of the employment–population  ratio was 
particularly dramatic during the recession of 2007–2009, and the ratio  actually continued 
to decline during the two years following the end of the recession. The fall of the employ-
ment–population ratio may give an even better indication than does the u nemployment 
rate of how weak the U.S. labor market was during and after the 2007–2009 recession.
As we will see in later chapters, explaining the weakness of the U.S. labor market 
during and after the 2007–2009 recession had become a top priority of economists and 
policymakers.

self-employed, gives a larger total for employment than does the establishment survey. 
The household survey provides information on the number of persons unemployed and 
on the number of persons in the labor force. This information is not available in the es-
tablishment survey. Between August and September 2011, employment rose by 398,000 
in the household survey, while it rose by only 103,000 in the establishment survey. This 
substantial discrepancy is partly due to the slightly different groups covered by the two 
surveys and partly to inaccuracies in the surveys.

Data: How Bad Was the 2007–2009 Recession?
Economists and policymakers rely on government economic data, such as the  employment 
data from the establishment survey, to understand the current state of the economy. Given 
the size of the U.S. economy, though, government agencies, such as the Bureau of Eco-
nomic Analysis, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the Census Bureau, need considerable 
time to gather complete and accurate data on GDP, employment, and other macroeco-
nomic variables. To avoid long waits in supplying data to policymakers and the general 
public, government agencies typically issue preliminary estimates that they revise as 
 additional information becomes available. As we noted earlier, the data from the BLS on 
employment as gathered in the establishment survey can be subject to particularly large 
revisions over time.
Figure 20.5 shows for each month from December 2007 to December 2010 the dif-
ference between the value for the change in employment as initially reported in the es-
tablishment survey and the revised value available in September 2011. The green bars

jobs were lost (or more jobs were created) than originally reported, and the red bars

jobs were lost (or fewer jobs were created). For example, the BLS initially reported that

employment declined by 159,000 jobs during September 2008. In fact, after additional 
data became available, the BLS revised its estimate to show that employment had de-
clined by 434,000 jobs during the month—a difference of 275,000 more jobs lost. As 
the recession deepened between April 2008 and April 2009, the BLS’s initial reports 
 underestimated the number of jobs lost by 2.3 million. In other words, the recession of 
2007–2009 turned out to be much more severe than economists and policymakers real-
ized at the time.
Job Creation and Job Destruction over Time
One important fact about employment is not very well known: The U.S. economy 
 creates and destroys millions of jobs every year. In 2010, for example, about 26.6  million 
jobs were created, and about 25.4 million jobs were destroyed. This degree of job cre-
ation and destruction is not surprising in a vibrant market system where new firms are 
constantly being started, some existing firms are expanding, some existing firms are 
contracting, and some firms are going out of business. The creation and destruction of 
jobs results from changes in consumer tastes, technological progress, and the successes 
and failures of entrepreneurs in responding to the opportunities and challenges of shift-
ing consumer tastes and technological change. The large volume of job creation and job 
destruction helps explain why during most years, the typical person who loses a job is 
unemployed for a relatively brief period of time.
When the BLS announces each month the increases or decreases in the number of 
persons employed and unemployed, these are net figures. That is, the change in the num-
ber of persons employed is equal to the total number of jobs created minus the number 
of jobs eliminated. Take, for example, the months from September to December 2010. 
During that period, 6,954,000 jobs were created, and 6,391,000 were eliminated, for a 
net increase of 563,000 jobs. Because the net change is so much smaller than the total 
job increases and decreases, the net change doesn’t fully represent how dynamic the U.S. 
job market really is.
The data in Table 20.2 reinforce the idea of how large the volume of job creation 
and job elimination is over a period as brief as three months. The table shows the num-
ber of establishments (that is, offices, factories, or stores) creating and eliminating jobs 
during the period from September through December 2010. About 382,000 new estab-
lishments opened, creating 1.35 million new jobs, and 352,000 establishments closed, 
eliminating 1.23 million jobs.
Types of Unemployment
Figure 20.6 illustrates that the unemployment rate follows the business cycle, rising dur-
ing recessions and falling during expansions. Notice, though, that the unemployment 
rate never falls to zero. To understand why this is true, we need to discuss the three 
types of unemployment:
1. Frictional unemployment
2. Structural unemployment
3. Cyclical unemployment

Frictional Unemployment and Job Search
Workers have different skills, interests, and abilities, and jobs have different skill 
 requirements, working conditions, and pay levels. As a result, a new worker entering the 
labor force or a worker who has lost a job probably will not find an  acceptable job right 
away. Most workers spend at least some time engaging in job search, just as most firms 
spend time searching for a new person to fill a job opening. Frictional  unemployment 
is short-term unemployment that arises from the process of  matching workers with 
jobs. Some frictional unemployment is unavoidable. As we have seen, the U.S. economy 
creates and destroys millions of jobs each year. The  process of job search takes time, so 
there will always be some workers who are frictionally unemployed because they are 
between jobs and in the process of searching for new ones.
Some unemployment is due to seasonal factors, such as weather or fluctuations 
in demand for some products or services during different times of the year. For 
 example, stores located in beach resort areas reduce their hiring during the winter, 
and ski  resorts reduce their hiring during the summer. Department stores increase 
their hiring in November and December and reduce their hiring after New Year’s Day. 
In  agricultural areas, employment increases during harvest season and declines there-
after. Construction workers in many parts of the United States experience greater 
unemployment during the winter than during the summer. Seasonal unemployment 
refers to unemployment due to factors such as weather, variations in tourism, and 
other calendar-related events. Because seasonal unemployment can make the unem-
ployment rate seem artificially high during some months and artificially low during 
other months, the BLS reports two unemployment rates each month—one that is sea-
sonally adjusted and one that is not seasonally adjusted. The seasonally adjusted data 
eliminate the effects of seasonal unemployment. Economists and policymakers rely 
on the seasonally adjusted data as a more accurate measure of the current state of the 
labor market.
Would eliminating all frictional unemployment be good for the economy? No, 
 because some frictional unemployment actually increases economic efficiency. 
 Frictional unemployment occurs because workers and firms take the time necessary to 
ensure a good match between the attributes of workers and the characteristics of jobs. 
By devoting time to job search, workers end up with jobs they find satisfying and in 
which they can be productive. Of course, having more productive and better-satisfied 
workers is also in the best interest of firms.

term unemployment that arises from

Types of Unemployment 
653
Structural Unemployment
By 2011, computer-generated three-dimensional animation, which was used in  movies 
such as Kung Fu Panda 2 and Cars 2, had become much more popular than traditional 
hand-drawn two-dimensional animation. Many people who were highly skilled in hand-
drawn animation lost their jobs at Walt Disney Pictures, DreamWorks, and other movie 
studios. To become employed again, many of these people either became skilled in 
computer-generated animation or found new occupations. In the meantime, they were 
unemployed. Economists consider these animators structurally unemployed.  Structural 
unemployment arises from a persistent mismatch between the job skills or attributes 
of workers and the requirements of jobs. While frictional unemployment is short term, 
structural unemployment can last for longer periods because workers need time to 
learn new skills. For example, employment by U.S. steel firms dropped by more than 
half between the early 1980s and the early 2000s as a result of competition from  foreign 
producers and technological change that substituted machines for workers. Many steel-
workers found new jobs in other industries only after lengthy periods of retraining.
Some workers lack even basic skills, such as literacy, or have addictions to alcohol 
or other drugs that make it difficult for them to perform adequately the duties of almost 
any job. These workers may remain structurally unemployed for years.
Cyclical Unemployment
When the economy moves into recession, many firms find their sales falling and cut 
back on production. As production falls, firms start laying off workers. Workers who 
lose their jobs because of a recession are experiencing cyclical unemployment. For 
 example, Ford laid off workers during the recession of 2007–2009. As the economy 
slowly recovered from the recession, Ford began rehiring those workers. The Ford 
workers who had been laid off from their jobs during the recession and then rehired 
during the following expansion had experienced cyclical unemployment.
Full Employment
As the economy moves through the expansion phase of the business cycle, cycli-
cal  unemployment eventually drops to zero. The unemployment rate will not be zero, 
however, because of frictional and structural unemployment. As Figure 20.6 shows, the 
unemployment rate in the United States is rarely below 4 percent. When the only re-
maining unemployment is structural and frictional unemployment, the economy is said 
to be at full employment.
Economists consider frictional and structural unemployment as the normal 
 underlying level of unemployment in the economy. The fluctuations around this normal 
level of unemployment that we see in Figure 20.6 are mainly due to the changes in the 
level of cyclical unemployment. This normal level of unemployment, which is the sum 
of frictional and structural unemployment, is called the natural rate of  unemployment. 
Economists disagree on the exact value of the natural rate of unemployment, and there 
is good reason to believe it varies over time. Currently, most economists estimate the 
natural rate to be between 5 percent and 6 percent. The natural rate of unemployment is 
also  sometimes called the full-employment rate of unemployment.
Structural unemployment 
Unemployment that arises from a 
persistent mismatch between the skills 
and attributes of workers and the 
requirements of jobs.

How Should We Categorize 
Unemployment at Bank of America?
We saw at the beginning of the chapter that in the fall of 2011, 
Bank of America, the second largest bank in the United States, 
 announced that it would be laying off 30,000 of its 288,000 employees. Was the unem-
ployment caused by the layoffs at Bank of America frictional unemployment, struc-
tural unemployment, or cyclical unemployment? In answering this question, we should 
 acknowledge that categorizing unemployment as frictional, structural, or cyclical is 
 useful in understanding the sources of unemployment, but it can be difficult to apply

Explaining Unemployment
We have seen that some unemployment is a result of the business cycle. In later  chapters, 
we will explore the causes of the business cycle, which will help us understand the causes 
of cyclical unemployment. In this section, we will look at the factors that determine the 
levels of frictional and structural unemployment.
Government Policies and the Unemployment Rate
Workers search for jobs by sending out resumes, registering with Internet job sites 
such as Monster.com, and getting job referrals from friends and relatives. Firms fill 
job  openings by advertising in newspapers, listing openings online, participating in

the unemployment rate.
these categories in a particular case. The BLS, for instance, pro-
vides estimates of total unemployment but does not classify it as 
frictional, structural, or cyclical.
Despite these difficulties, we can roughly categorize the un-
employment caused by Bank of America’s announcement. We 
begin by considering the three basic reasons the layoffs occurred: 
the long-term decline in the commercial banking sector; the re-
cession of 2007–2009 that temporarily reduced the demand for 
mortgages and other loans; and the particular problems that Bank 
of America was experiencing in 2011. Each reason corresponds 
to a category of unemployment. During the housing boom of the 
mid-2000s, the financial sector of the economy, including banks, 
expanded rapidly. The financial sector began to contract during 
the recession of 2007–2009 as the need for mortgages and other 
loans began to decline. Employment in the financial sector was 
still declining in the fall of 2011. Although some of this decline was related to the se-
verity of the recession and the slowness of the recovery, many economists believed that 
employment in the financial sector was unlikely to return to the levels seen at the height 
of the housing boom in 2005 and 2006. Therefore, some of the employees laid off by 
Bank of America were unlikely to find new jobs without leaving the financial sector, so 
they had become structurally unemployed. Some of the decline in demand for loans and 
other banking and financial services was due to the effects of the 2007–2009 recession 
rather than to long-term problems in the financial sector. So, some of the workers Bank 
of America laid off were cyclically unemployed and could expect to find other jobs with 
financial firms after the economic recovery strengthened.
Finally, Bank of America was suffering from some problems that were not shared 
by all other banks. In 2008, after the recession had already begun, Bank of America pur-
chased Countrywide Financial for over $4 billion. Countrywide had been the leading 
mortgage lender in the United States. Unfortunately, many of its loans had been made 
to borrowers with poor credit who defaulted on their loans once housing prices began 
to decline. Managers at Bank of America had underestimated the problems at Country-
wide, which continued to suffer losses into 2011. In addition, some of Countrywide’s 
lending practices were disputed in lawsuits that might cost Bank of America billions 
of dollars to settle. Bank of America would have laid off fewer workers if it had not 
been suffering from these problems. As a result, it was likely that some of these workers 
would be able to find jobs at competing banks after relatively brief job searches. These 
workers were frictionally unemployed.

job fairs, and recruiting on college campuses. Government policy can aid these private 
 efforts. Governments can help reduce the level of frictional unemployment by pursuing 
policies that help speed up the process of matching unemployed workers with unfilled 
jobs. Governments can help reduce structural unemployment by implementing poli-
cies that aid worker retraining. For example, the federal government’s Trade Adjustment 
 Assistance program offers training to workers whose firms laid them off as a result of 
competition from foreign firms.
Some government policies, however, can add to the level of frictional and structural 
unemployment. These government policies increase the unemployment rate either by 
increasing the time workers devote to searching for jobs, by providing disincentives for 
firms to hire workers, or by keeping wages above their market level.
Unemployment Insurance and Other Payments to the Unemployed Sup-
pose you have been in the labor force for a few years but have just lost your job. You 
could probably find a low-wage job immediately if you needed to—perhaps at Wal-Mart 
or McDonald’s. But you might decide to search for a better, higher-paying job by sending 
out resumes and responding to want ads and Internet job postings. Remember that the 
opportunity cost of any activity is the highest-valued alternative that you must give up to 
engage in that activity. In this case, the opportunity cost of continuing to search for a job 
is the salary you are giving up at the job you could have taken. The longer you search, the 
greater your chances of finding a better, higher-paying job, but the longer you search, the 
more salary you have given up by not working, so the greater the  opportunity cost.
In the United States and most other industrial countries, the unemployed are 
 eligible for unemployment insurance payments from the government. In the United 
States, these payments vary by state but are generally equal to about half the average 
wage. The unemployed spend more time searching for jobs because they receive these 
payments. This additional time spent searching raises the unemployment rate. Does this 
mean that the unemployment insurance program is a bad idea? Most economists would 
say no. Before Congress established the unemployment insurance program at the end 
of the 1930s, unemployed workers suffered very large declines in their incomes, which 
led them to greatly reduce their spending. This reduced spending contributed to the 
severity of recessions. Unemployment insurance helps the unemployed maintain their 
income and spending, which lessens the personal hardship of being unemployed and 
also helps reduce the severity of recessions.
In the United States, unemployed workers are generally eligible to receive unemploy-
ment insurance payments equal to about half their previous wage for only six months, 
although this period is typically extended during recessions, as happened during and 
after the recession of 2007–2009. After that, the opportunity cost of continuing to search 
for a job rises. In many other high-income countries, such as Canada and most of the 
countries of Western Europe, workers are eligible to receive unemployment payments for 
a year or more, and the payments may equal 70 percent to 80 percent of their previous 
wage. In addition, many of these countries have generous social insurance programs that 
allow unemployed adults to receive some government payments even after their eligibil-
ity for unemployment insurance has ended. In the United States, very few government 
programs make payments to healthy adults, with the exception of the Temporary Assis-
tance for Needy Families program, which allows single parents to receive payments for 
up to five years. Although there are many reasons unemployment rates may differ across 
countries, most economists believe that because the opportunity cost of job search is 
lower in Canada and countries of Western Europe, unemployed workers in those coun-
tries search longer for jobs and, therefore, the unemployment rates in those countries 
tend to be higher than in the United States. During the 2007–2009 recession, however, 
unemployment rates were lower in Canada and Germany than in the United States.
Minimum Wage Laws In 1938, the federal government enacted a national mini-
mum wage law. At first, the lowest legal wage firms could pay workers was $0.25 per 
hour. Over the years, Congress has gradually raised the minimum wage; in 2011, it was 
$7.25 per hour. Some states and cities also have minimum wage laws. For example, in 
2011, the minimum wage in California was $8.00 per hour, and the minimum wage in 

656 
C H A P T E R  2 0  Unemployment and Inflation 
San Francisco was $9.92 per hour. If the minimum wage is set above the market wage 
determined by the demand and supply of labor, the quantity of labor supplied will be 
greater than the quantity of labor demanded. Some workers will be unemployed who 
would have been employed if there were no minimum wage. As a result, the unemploy-
ment rate will be higher than it would be without a minimum wage. Economists agree 
that the current minimum wage is above the market wage for some workers, but they 
disagree on the amount of unemployment that has resulted. Because teenagers generally 
have relatively few job-related skills, they are the group most likely to receive the mini-
mum wage. Studies estimate that a 10 percent increase in the minimum wage  reduces 
teenage employment by about 2 percent. Because teenagers and others receiving the 
minimum wage are a relatively small part of the labor force, most economists believe 
that, at its present level, the effect of the minimum wage on the unemployment rate in 
the United States is fairly small.
Labor Unions
Labor unions are organizations of workers that bargain with employers for higher wages 
and better working conditions for their members. In unionized industries, the wage is 
usually above what otherwise would be the market wage. This above-market wage  results 
in employers in unionized industries hiring fewer workers, but does it also significantly 
increase the overall unemployment rate in the economy? Most economists would say 
the answer is “no” because only about 9 percent of workers outside the government sec-
tor are unionized. Although unions remain strong in a few industries, such as airlines, 
automobiles, steel, and telecommunications, most industries in the United States are not 
unionized. The result is that most workers who can’t find jobs in unionized  industries 
because the wage is above its market level can find jobs in other industries.
Efficiency Wages
Many firms pay higher-than-market wages not because the government requires them 
to or because they are unionized but because they believe doing so will increase their 
profits. This may seem like a paradox: Wages are the largest cost for many employers, 
so paying higher wages seems like a good way for firms to lower profits rather than to 
increase them. The key to understanding the paradox is that the level of wages can affect 
the level of worker productivity. Many studies have shown that workers are motivated 
by higher wages to work harder. An efficiency wage is a higher-than-market wage that 
a firm pays to motivate workers to be more productive. Can’t firms ensure that workers 
work hard by supervising them? In some cases, they can. For example, a telemarketing 
firm can monitor workers electronically to ensure that they make the required number 
of phone calls per hour. In many business situations, however, it is much more difficult 
to monitor workers. Many firms must rely on workers being motivated enough to work 
hard. By paying a wage above the market wage, a firm raises the costs to workers of los-
ing their jobs because many alternative jobs will pay only the market wage. The increase 
in productivity that results from paying the high wage can more than offset the extra 
cost of the wage, thereby lowering the firm’s costs of production.
Because the efficiency wage is above the market wage, it results in the quantity of 
labor supplied being greater than the quantity of labor demanded, just as do minimum 
wage laws and unions. So, efficiency wages are another reason economies experience 
some unemployment even when cyclical unemployment is zero.
Measuring Inflation
One of the facts of economic life is that the prices of most goods and services rise over 
time. As a result, the cost of living continually rises. In 1914, Henry Ford began  paying 
his workers a wage of $5 per day, which was more than twice as much as other auto-
mobile manufacturers were paying. Ford’s $5-a-day wage provided his workers with a 
 middle-class income because prices were so low. In 1914, Ford’s Model T, the  best- selling

market wage that a firm pays to 
increase worker productivity.

car in the country, sold for less than $600, the price of a man’s suit was $15, the price of 
a ticket to a movie theater was $0.15, and the price of a box of Kellogg’s Corn Flakes was 
$0.08. In 2011, with the cost of living being much higher than it was in 1914, the mini-
mum wage law required firms to pay a wage of at least $7.25 per hour, more than Ford’s 
highly paid workers earned in a day.
Knowing how the government compiles the employment and unemployment statis-
tics is important in interpreting them. The same is true of the government’s statistics on 
the cost of living. As we saw in Chapter 19, the price level measures the average prices 
of goods and services in the economy. The inflation rate is the percentage increase in 
the price level from one year to the next. In Chapter 19, we introduced the GDP deflator 
as a measure of the price level. The GDP deflator is the broadest measure we have of the 
price level because it includes the price of every  final good and service. But for some 
purposes it is too broad. For example, if we want to know how inflation affects the typi-
cal household, the GDP price deflator may be misleading because it includes the prices 
of products such as large electric generators and machine tools that are included in 
the investment component of GDP but are not purchased by the typical household. In 
this chapter, we will focus on measuring the inflation rate by changes in the consumer 
price index because changes in this index come closest to measuring changes in the cost 
of  living as experienced by the typical household. We will also briefly discuss a third 
 measure of inflation: the producer price index.
The Consumer Price Index
To obtain prices of a representative group of goods and services, the BLS surveys 30,000 
households nationwide on their spending habits. It uses the results of this survey to 
construct a market basket of 211 types of goods and services purchased by the typical 
urban family of four. Figure 20.7 shows the goods and services in the market basket, 
grouped into eight broad categories. Almost three-quarters of the market basket falls 
into the categories of housing, transportation, and food. Each month, hundreds of BLS 
employees visit 23,000 stores in 87 cities and record prices of the goods and services 
in the market basket. Each price in the consumer price index is given a weight equal  
to the fraction of the typical family’s budget spent on that good or service. The  consumer 
price index (CPI) is an average of the prices of the goods and services purchased by the 
typical urban family of four. One year is chosen as the base year, and the value of the 
CPI is set equal to 100 for that year. In any year other than the base year, the CPI is 
equal to the ratio of the dollar amount necessary to buy the market basket of goods in 
that year divided by the dollar amount necessary to buy the market basket of goods in

the base year, multiplied by 100. Because the CPI measures the cost to the typical family 
to buy a representative basket of goods and services, it is sometimes referred to as the  
cost- of-living index.
A simple example can clarify how the CPI is constructed. For purposes of this 
 example, we assume that the market basket has only three products: eye examinations, 
pizzas, and books:
Formula
Applied to 2012
Applied to 2013
CPI = Expenditures in the current year
Expenditures in the base year
* 100
a $900
$750
b * 100 = 120
a $915
$750
b * 100 = 122
Suppose that during the base year, 1999, a survey determines that each month, the 
typical family purchases 1 eye examination, 20 pizzas, and 20 books. At 1999 prices, the 
typical family must spend $750.00 to purchase this market basket of goods and services. 
The CPI for every year after the base year is determined by dividing the amount neces-
sary to purchase the market basket in that year by the amount required in the base year, 
then multiplying by 100. Notice that the quantities of the products purchased in 2012 
and 2013 are irrelevant in calculating the CPI because we are assuming that households 
buy the same market basket of products each month. Using the numbers in the table, we 
can calculate the CPI for 2012 and 2013:
How do we interpret values such as 120 and 122? First, recognize that they are index 
numbers, which means they are not measured in dollars or any other units. The CPI is 
intended to measure changes in the price level over time. We can’t use the CPI to tell us in 
an absolute sense how high the price level is—only how much it has changed over time. 
We measure the inflation rate as the percentage increase in the CPI from one year to the 
next. For our simple example, the inflation rate in 2013 would be the percentage change 
in the CPI from 2012 to 2013:
a 122 - 120
120
b * 100 = 1.7%.
Because the CPI is designed to measure the cost of living, we can also say that the cost of 
living increased by 1.7 percent during 2013.
Is the CPI Accurate?
The CPI is the most widely used measure of inflation. Policymakers use the CPI to track 
the state of the economy. Businesses use it to help set the prices of their products and the 
wages and salaries of their employees. Each year, the federal government increases the 
Social Security payments made to retired workers by a percentage equal to the increase 
in the CPI during the previous year. In setting alimony and child support payments in 
divorce cases, judges often order that the payments increase each year by the inflation 
rate, as measured by the CPI.

Measuring Inflation 
659
It is important that the CPI be as accurate as possible, but there are four biases that 
cause changes in the CPI to overstate the true inflation rate:
• 
Substitution bias. In constructing the CPI, the BLS assumes that each month, 
 consumers purchase the same amount of each product in the market basket. In 
fact, consumers are likely to buy fewer of those products that increase most in price 
and more of those products that increase least in price (or fall the most in price). 
For instance, if apple prices rise rapidly during the month while orange prices fall, 
consumers will reduce their apple purchases and increase their orange purchases. 
Therefore, the prices of the market basket consumers actually buy will rise less than 
the prices of the market basket the BLS uses to compute the CPI.
• 
Increase in quality bias. Over time, most products included in the CPI improve 
in quality: Automobiles become more durable and side air bags become stan-
dard equipment, computers become faster and have more memory, dishwashers 
use less water while getting dishes cleaner, and so on. Increases in the prices of 
these products partly reflect their improved quality and partly are pure inflation. 
The BLS attempts to make adjustments so that only the pure inflation part of 
price increases is included in the CPI. These adjustments are difficult to make, 
however, so the recorded price increases overstate the pure inflation in some 
products.
• 
New product bias. For many years, the BLS updated the market basket of goods 
used in computing the CPI only every 10 years. So, new products introduced be-
tween updates were not included in the market basket. For example, the 1987 up-
date took place before cell phones were introduced. Although millions of American 
households used cell phones by the mid-1990s, they were not included in the CPI 
until the 1997 update. The prices of many products, such as cell phones, Blu-ray 
players, and LED televisions, decrease in the years immediately after they are intro-
duced. If the market basket is not updated frequently, these price decreases are not 
included in the CPI.
• 
Outlet bias. During the mid-1990s, many consumers began to increase their 
 purchases from discount stores such as Sam’s Club and Costco. By the late 1990s, 
the Internet began to account for a significant fraction of sales of some products. 
Because the BLS continued to collect price statistics from traditional full-price retail 
stores, the CPI did not reflect the prices some consumers actually paid.
Most economists believe these biases cause changes in the CPI to overstate the true 
inflation rate by 0.5 percentage point to 1 percentage point. That is, if the CPI indicates

are asked to calculate the inflation rate for 2010:

It is tempting to avoid any calculations and simply to re-
port that the inflation rate in 2010 was 119 percent  because 
219 is a 119 percent increase from 100. But 119 percent 
would be the wrong answer. A value for the CPI of 219 in 
2010 tells us that the price level in 2010 was 119  percent 
higher than in the base year, but the inflation rate is the 
percentage increase in the price level from the previous 
year, not the percentage increase from the base year. The 
correct calculation of the inflation rate for 2010 is:
a 219 - 216

b * 100 = 1.4%.

that the inflation rate was 3 percent, it is probably between 2 percent and 2.5 percent. 
The BLS continues to take steps to reduce the size of the bias. For example, the BLS 
has reduced the size of the substitution and new product biases by updating the market 
 basket every 2 years rather than every 10 years. The BLS has reduced the size of the 
outlet bias by conducting a point-of-purchase survey to track where consumers actually 
make their purchases. Finally, the BLS has used statistical methods to reduce the size of 
the quality bias. Prior to these changes, the size of the total bias in the CPI was probably 
greater than 1 percent.
The Producer Price Index
In addition to the GDP deflator and the CPI, the government also computes the 
 producer price index (PPI). Like the CPI, the PPI tracks the prices of a market basket 
of goods. But, whereas the CPI tracks the prices of goods and services purchased by the 
typical household, the PPI tracks the prices firms receive for goods and services at all 
stages of production. The PPI includes the prices of intermediate goods, such as flour, 
cotton, yarn, steel, and lumber; and raw materials, such as raw cotton, coal, and crude 
petroleum. If the prices of these goods rise, the cost to firms of producing final goods 
and services will rise, which may lead firms to increase the prices of goods and services 
purchased by consumers. Changes in the PPI therefore can give an early warning of 
 future movements in the CPI.
Using Price Indexes to Adjust 
for the Effects of Inflation
You are likely to receive a much higher salary after  graduation than your parents did 
25 or more years ago, but prices 25 years ago were, on average, much lower than prices 
today. Put another way, the purchasing power of a dollar was much higher 25 years ago 
because the prices of most goods and services were much lower. Price indexes such as 
the CPI give us a way of adjusting for the effects of inflation so that we can compare dol-
lar values from different years. For  example, suppose your mother received a salary of 
$20,000 in 1984. By using the CPI, we can calculate what $20,000 in 1984 was equivalent 
to in 2010. The consumer price index is 104 for 1984 and 219 for 2010. Because 219/104 
= 2.1, we know that, on average, prices were about 2.1 times as high in 2010 as in 1984. 
We can use this result to inflate a salary of $20,000 received in 1984 to its value in terms 
of 2010 purchasing power:
Value in 2010 dollars = Value in 1984 dollars * a CPI in 2010
CPI in 1984 b
= +20,000 * a 219
104 b = +42,115.
Our calculation shows that if you were paid a salary of $42,115 in 2010, you would 
be able to purchase roughly the same amount of goods and services that your mother 
could have purchased with a salary of $20,000 in 1984. Economic variables that are cal-
culated in current-year prices are referred to as nominal variables. The calculation we 
have just made uses a price index to adjust a nominal variable—your mother’s salary—
for the effects of inflation.
For some purposes, we are interested in tracking changes in an economic variable 
over time rather than in seeing what its value would be in today’s dollars. In that case, to 
correct for the effects of inflation, we can divide the nominal variable by a price index 
and multiply by 100 to obtain a real variable. The real variable will be measured in dol-
lars of the base year for the price index. Currently, the base year for the CPI is the aver-
age of prices in the years 1982 to 1984.

Solving the Problem
Step 1: Review the chapter material. This problem is about using price indexes 
to correct for inflation, so you may want to review the section “Using Price 
 Indexes to Adjust for the Effects of Inflation” on page 660.
Step 2: Calculate real average hourly earnings for each year. To calculate real aver-
age hourly earnings for each year, divide nominal average hourly earnings by 
the CPI and multiply by 100. For example, real average hourly earnings for 
2008 are equal to
a +21.62
216.2 b * 100 = +10.00.
 
These are the results for all three years:

2010. This percentage change is equal to
a +10.33 - +10.29
+10.29
b * 100 = 0.4%.
 
We can conclude that real average hourly earnings increased slightly between 
2009 and 2010.
Extra Credit:  The values we computed for real average hourly earnings are in 1982–
1984 dollars. Because this period is more than 25 years ago, the values are somewhat 
difficult to interpret. We can convert the earnings to 2010 dollars by using the method 
we used earlier to calculate your mother’s salary. But notice that, for purposes of calcu-
lating the change in the value of real average hourly earnings over time, the base year of 
the price index doesn’t matter. The change from 2009 to 2010 would have still been 0.4 
percent, no matter what the base year of the price index was. If you don’t see that this is 
true, test it by using the mother’s salary method to calculate real average hourly earnings

Real versus Nominal Interest Rates
The difference between nominal and real values is important when money is being 
 borrowed and lent. As we saw in Chapter 8, the interest rate is the cost of borrowing 
funds, expressed as a percentage of the amount borrowed. If you lend someone $1,000 
for one year and charge an interest rate of 6 percent, the borrower will pay back $1,060, 
or 6 percent more than the amount you lent. But is $1,060 received one year from now 
really 6 percent more than $1,000 today? If prices rise during the year, you will not be 
able to buy as much with $1,060 one year from now as you could with that amount to-
day. Your true return from lending the $1,000 is equal to the percentage change in your 
purchasing power after taking into account the effects of inflation.
The stated interest rate on a loan is the nominal interest rate. The real interest 
rate corrects the nominal interest rate for the effect of inflation on purchasing power. 
As a simple example, suppose that the only good you purchase is DVDs, and at the 
beginning of the year, the price of DVDs is $10.00. With $1,000, you can purchase 100 
DVDs. If you lend the $1,000 out for one year at an interest rate of 6 percent, you will 
receive $1,060 at the end of the year. Suppose the inflation rate during the year is 2 per-
cent, so that the price of DVDs has risen to $10.20 by the end of the year. How has your 
purchasing power increased as a result of making the loan? At the beginning of the year, 
your $1,000 could purchase 100 DVDs. At the end of the year, your $1,060 can purchase 
$1,060/$10.20 = 103.92 DVDs. In other words, you can purchase almost 4 percent more 
DVDs. So, in this case, the real interest rate you received from lending was a little less 
than 4 percent (actually, 3.92 percent). For low rates of inflation, a convenient approxi-
mation for the real interest rate is
Real interest rate = Nominal interest rate - Inflation rate.
In our example, we can calculate the real interest rate by using this formula as  
6 percent − 2 percent = 4 percent, which is close to the actual value of 3.92 percent. 
If the inflation rate during the year was 4 percent, the real interest rate would be only 
2 percent. Holding the nominal interest rate constant, the higher the inflation rate, the 
lower the real interest rate. Notice that if the inflation rate turns out to be higher than 
expected, borrowers pay and lenders receive a lower real interest rate than either of 
them expected. For example, if both you and the person to whom you lent the $1,000 
expected the inflation rate to be 2 percent, you both expected the real interest rate on the 
loan to be 4 percent. If inflation actually turns out to be 4 percent, the real interest rate 
on the loan will be 2 percent: That’s bad news for you but good news for your borrower.
For the economy as a whole, we can measure the nominal interest rate as the in-
terest rate on three-month U.S. Treasury bills. U.S. Treasury bills are short-term loans 
investors make to the federal government. We can use inflation as measured by changes 
in the CPI to calculate the real interest rate on Treasury bills. Figure 20.8 shows the 
nominal and real interest rates for the years 1970 through 2010. Notice that when the 
inflation rate is low, as it has been during most years since the early 1990s, the gap be-
tween the nominal and real interest rates is small. When the inflation rate is high, as it 
was during the mid- to late 1970s, the gap between the nominal and real interest rates 
becomes large. In fact, a particular nominal interest rate can be associated in different 
periods with very different real interest rates. For example, during late 1975, the nomi-
nal interest rate was about 5.5 percent, but because the inflation rate was 7 percent,

make an arithmetic error, you should find that the answer is still 0.4 percent.

 the real interest rate was -1.5 percent. In early 1987, the nominal interest rate was also 
5.5 percent, but because the inflation rate was only 2 percent, the real interest rate was 
3.5 percent.
This example shows that it is impossible to know whether a particular nominal in-
terest rate is “high” or “low.” It all depends on the inflation rate. The real interest rate pro-
vides a better measure of the true cost of borrowing and the true return from lending than 
does the nominal interest rate. When firms are deciding whether to borrow the funds 
to buy an investment good, such as a new factory, they will look at the real interest rate 
because the real interest rate measures the true cost to the firm of borrowing.
Is it possible for the nominal interest rate to be less than the real interest rate? 
Yes, but only when the inflation rate is negative. A negative inflation rate is referred 
to as deflation and occurs on the rare occasions when the price level falls. During 
the years shown in Figure 20.8, the inflation rate as measured by changes in the CPI 
was only negative during the first nine months of 2009.

The real interest rate is equal to the nominal interest rate minus the inflation 
rate. The real interest rate provides a better measure of the true cost of borrowing 
and the true return on lending than does the nominal interest rate. The nominal 
interest rate in the figure is the interest rate on three-month U.S. Treasury bills. 
The inflation rate is measured by the percentage change in the CPI from the same 
quarter during the previous year.

$90,000 per year. So, the purchasing power of your salary has remained the same, and 
you are just as likely to buy the iPad today as you were yesterday.
This hypothetical situation makes an important point: Nominal incomes generally 
increase with inflation. Remember from Chapter 19 that we can think of the $499 price 
of an iPad as representing either the value of the product or the value of all the income 
generated in producing the product. The two amounts are the same, whether the iPad 
sells for $499 or $998. When the price of the iPad rises from $499 to $998, that extra 
$499 ends up as income that goes to the workers at Apple, the salespeople at Best Buy, or 
the stockholders of Apple, just as the first $499 did.
It’s tempting to think that the problem with inflation is that, as prices rise, consumers 
can no longer afford to buy as many goods and services, but our example shows that this 
is a fallacy. An expected inflation rate of 10 percent will raise the average price of goods 
and services by 10 percent, but it will also raise average incomes by 10 percent. Goods 
and services will be as affordable to the average consumer as they would be if there were 
no inflation.
Inflation Affects the Distribution of Income
If inflation will not reduce the affordability of goods and services to the average con-
sumer, why do people dislike inflation? One reason is that the argument in the previous 
section applies to the average person but not to every person. Some people will find 
their incomes rising faster than the rate of inflation, and so their purchasing power will 
rise. Other people will find their incomes rising more slowly than the rate of inflation—
or not at all—and their purchasing power will fall. People on fixed incomes are particu-
larly likely to be hurt by inflation. If a retired worker receives a pension fixed at $3,000 
per month, over time, inflation will reduce the purchasing power of that payment. In 
that way, inflation can change the distribution of income in a manner that strikes many 
people as being unfair.
The extent to which inflation redistributes income depends in part on whether the 
inflation is anticipated—in which case consumers, workers, and firms can see it coming 
and can prepare for it—or unanticipated—in which case they do not see it coming and 
do not prepare for it.
The Problem with Anticipated Inflation
Like many of life’s problems, inflation is easier to manage if you see it coming. Suppose 
that everyone knows that the inflation rate for the next 10 years will be 10 percent per 
year. Workers know that unless their wages go up by at least 10 percent per year, the 
real purchasing power of their wages will fall. Businesses will be willing to increase 
workers’ wages enough to compensate for inflation because they know that the prices 
of the products they sell will increase. Lenders will realize that the loans they make 
will be paid back with dollars that are losing 10 percent of their value each year, so 
they will charge a higher interest rate to compensate. Borrowers will be willing to pay 
these higher interest rates because they also know they are paying back these loans 
with dollars that are losing value. So far, there don’t seem to be costs to anticipated 
inflation.
Even when inflation is perfectly anticipated, however, some individuals will ex-
perience a cost. Inevitably, there will be a redistribution of income, as some people’s 
incomes fall behind even an anticipated level of inflation. In addition, firms and con-
sumers have to hold some paper money to facilitate their buying and selling. Anyone 
holding paper money will find its purchasing power decreasing each year by the rate of 
inflation. To avoid this cost, workers and firms will try to hold as little paper money as 
possible, but they will have to hold some. In addition, firms that print catalogs listing 
the prices of their products will have to reprint them more frequently. Supermarkets 
and other stores that mark prices on packages or on store shelves will have to devote 
more time and labor to changing the marked prices. The costs to firms of changing 
prices are called menu costs. At moderate levels of anticipated inflation, menu costs 
are relatively small, but at very high levels of inflation, such as those experienced in 
Menu costs The costs to firms of 
changing prices.

 
Does Inflation Impose Costs on the Economy?  
665
some developing countries, menu costs and the costs due to paper money losing value 
can become substantial. Finally, even anticipated inflation acts to raise the taxes paid 
by investors and raises the cost of capital for business investment. These effects arise 
because investors are taxed on the nominal payments they receive rather than on the 
real payments.
The Problem with Unanticipated Inflation
In any high-income economy—such as the United States—households, workers, and 
firms routinely enter into contracts that commit them to make or receive certain pay-
ments for years in the future. For example, when firms sign wage contracts, they com-
mit to paying a specified wage for the duration of the contract. When people buy homes, 
they usually borrow most of the amount they need from a bank. These loans, called 
mortgage loans, commit a borrower to make a fixed monthly payment for the length of 
the loan. Most mortgage loans are for long periods, often as long as 30 years.
To make these long-term commitments, households, workers, and firms must fore-
cast the rate of inflation. If a firm believes the inflation rate over the next three years will 
be 6 percent per year, signing a three-year contract with a union that calls for wage in-
creases of 8 percent per year may seem reasonable because the firm may be able to raise 
its prices by at least the rate of inflation each year. If the firm believes that the inflation 
rate will be only 2 percent over the next three years, paying wage increases of 8 percent 
may significantly reduce its profits or even force it out of business.
When people borrow money or banks lend money, they must forecast the inflation 
rate so they can calculate the real rate of interest on a loan. In 1980, banks were charg-
ing interest rates of 18 percent or more on mortgage loans. This rate seems very high 
compared to the less than 5 percent charged on such loans in 2011, but the inflation rate 
in 1980 was more than 13 percent and was expected to remain high. In fact, the infla-
tion rate declined unexpectedly during the early 1980s. By 1983, the inflation rate was 
only about 3 percent. People who borrowed money for 30 years at the high interest rates 
of 1980 soon found that the real interest rate on their loans was much higher than they 
expected.
When the actual inflation rate turns out to be very different from the expected 
inflation rate, some people gain, and other people lose. This outcome seems unfair to 
most people because they are either winning or losing only because something unantici-
pated has happened. This apparently unfair redistribution is a key reason people dislike 
unanticipated inflation.
What’s So Bad about Falling Prices?
We have just discussed how inflation being higher than 
 expected can cause problems for consumers, workers, and 
firms. But what if an economy begins to experience falling 
prices—deflation, rather than inflation? A falling price level 
might seem like good news for the economy. After all, falling prices should encourage 
consumers to increase their spending as goods and services become less expensive. In 
fact, though, deflation tends to have the opposite effect on consumers. Episodes of defla-
tion are relatively rare, but we can draw some lessons from two important deflationary 
episodes: the United States during the 1930s and Japan during the 1990s. In both cases, 
many consumers reduced their spending in the face of falling prices, apparently because 
they were waiting for prices to go even lower. Waiting for falling prices to go even lower 
was also a problem for the U.S. housing market in the late 2000s. A large run-up in hous-
ing prices took place from 2002 to 2006. When prices began to decline, many  potential

The deflation of the 1930s hurt the U.S. economy not just because it may have led 
some consumers to postpone purchases but also because it increased the burden on 
borrowers. For example, suppose that in 1929 you had borrowed money for five years 
at a nominal interest rate of 5 percent. What real interest rate would you have paid 
during those years? We have seen that to calculate the real interest rate, we need to 
subtract the inflation rate from the nominal interest rate. With deflation, the change 
in the price level is negative, so to calculate the real interest rate, we are in effect add-
ing the change in the price level to the nominal interest rate. The following table uses 
the actual deflation rate in each year to calculate the resulting real interest rates on 
your loan:

The bottom row of the table shows that although the nominal interest rate on your 
loan is only 5 percent, in three of the five years the real interest rate you pay is greater 
than 10 percent. In fact, high real interest rates inflicted serious losses on both house-
hold and business borrowers during the early 1930s and contributed to the severity of 
the Great Depression.
During the 2001 and 2007–2009 recessions, some policymakers and economists 
feared that the U.S. economy would experience deflation. Fortunately, significant 
 deflation did not occur. If it had, those recessions would likely have been more severe 
than they were.

Conclusion
Inflation and unemployment are key macroeconomic problems. Presidential elections 
are often won and lost on the basis of which candidate is able to convince the public that 
he or she can best deal with these problems. Many economists, however, would argue 
that, in the long run, maintaining high rates of growth of real GDP per person is the 
most important macroeconomic concern. Only when real GDP per person is increasing 
will a country’s standard of living increase. We turn in the next chapter to discussing the 
important issue of economic growth.

officials at the U.S. Postal Service for dealing with a loss of $8 billion in 2010.

Economics in Your Life
At the beginning of this chapter, we asked whether layoffs in the banking industry should cause 
you to change your major and give up your plans to pursue a career in banking. We have learned 
in this chapter that unemployment rates are higher and layoffs are more common in a recession 
than in an economic expansion. Because you are a sophomore, you will graduate a few years later, 
when the recession will likely have ended and the unemployment rate will have declined. You 
might also want to investigate whether the layoffs in the banking industry represent a permanent 
contraction in the size of the industry or whether they reflect a temporary decline due to the 
 recession. If the reduction of banking jobs is more likely to be permanent, then you might consider 
a career in another industry. If the layoffs appear to be related to the current recession, then you 
probably do not need to change your career plans.

Postal Service 
Considers Cutting 
120,000 Jobs
The financially strapped U.S. Postal 
Service is considering cutting as many 
as 120,000 jobs.
Facing a second year of losses to-
taling $8 billion or more, the agency 
also wants to pull its workers out of 
the retirement and health benefits 
plans covering federal workers and set 
up its own benefit systems.
Congressional approval would be 
needed for either step, and both could 
be expected to face severe opposition 
from postal unions which have con-
tracts that ban layoffs.
The post office has cut 110,000 
jobs over the last four years and is cur-
rently engaged in eliminating 7,500 
administrative staff.
But the loss of mail to the In-
ternet and the decline in advertising 
caused by the recession have rocked 
the agency.
Postal officials have said they will 
be unable to make a $5.5 billion pay-
ment to cover future employee health 
care costs due Sept. 30. It is the only 
federal agency required to make such 
a payment but, because of the com-
plex way government finances are 
counted, eliminating it would make 
the federal budget deficit appear $5.5 
billion larger.
If Congress doesn’t act and cur-
rent losses continue, the post office 
will be unable to make that payment 
at the end of September because it will 
have reached its borrowing limit and 
simply won’t have the cash to do so, 
the agency said earlier.
In that event, Postmaster General 
Patrick Donahoe said, “Our intent is 
to continue to deliver the mail, pay 
our employees and pay our suppliers.”
Postal officials have sought con-
gressional assistance repeatedly over 
the last few years, including requests 
to be allowed to end Saturday mail 
delivery, and several bills have been 
proposed, but none has been acted on.
In addition the post office 
 recently said it is considering closing 
3,653 post offices, stations and other 
facilities, about one-10th of its offices 
around the country, in an effort to save 
money. Offices under  consideration 
for closing are largely rural with little 
traffic.
And in June the post office sus-
pended contributions to its employ-
ees’ pension fund, which it said was 
overfunded.
 In its 2010 annual report the post 
office reported a loss of more than $8 
billion on revenues of $67 billion and 
expenses of $75 billion.
And even while total mail volume 
fell from 202 billion items to 170 billion 
from 2008 to 2010 the number of places 
the agency has to deliver mail increased 
by 1.7 million as Americans built new 
homes, offices and businesses.
The latest cutback plans were 
first reported by The Washington Post, 
which said a notice to employees in-
forming them of its proposals stated: 
“Financial crisis calls for significant ac-
tions; we will be insolvent next month 
due to significant declines in mail 
volume and retiree health benefit pre-
funding costs imposed by Congress.”

Key Points in the Article
In 2011, the U.S. Postal Service considered 
layoffs as a way to deal with a second con-
secutive year of heavy losses. Officials with 
the cash-strapped Postal Service stated 
that it would not be able to make a $5.5 
billion payment to its health care plan with-
out cutting its losses. In addition to layoffs, 
the agency has proposed cutting costs by 
restructuring its employee retirement and 
health care plans, eliminating Saturday de-
livery, and shutting down approximately 
one-tenth of its offices. Postal officials need 
congressional approval to move forward with 
any of these actions, and significant opposi-
tion was  expected from postal unions and 
some members of Congress.
Analyzing the News
a The recession and a changing econ-
omy help explain the growing losses at 
the U.S. Postal Service. Many companies 
are sending fewer advertisements and cata-
logs to potential customers as a result of 
the recession. This reduction in through-
the-mail advertising has had a direct effect 
on postal revenues. In addition to the de-
cline in advertisements, the Postal Service 
has seen a continued decline in the use of 
first-class mail, with a growing number of 
customers using the Internet to send and 
pay bills and as a means of communication. 
The postal system is just one area of the 
economy that is facing declining revenues 
and mounting debts. The economic 
 recession that began in 2007 and its lingering 
 effects have led to higher unemployment. 
The figure below shows the unemployment 
rates in different sectors of the economy dur-
ing August 2011. The overall unemployment 
rate was 9.1 percent, much higher than the 
4.6 percent in August 2007. The construction 
sector and the hospitality and leisure sector 
suffered the most in the economic downturn, 
with the unemployment rate in each above 
10 percent. The health care and education, 
mining, financial, and government workers 
sectors were least affected; their unemploy-
ment rates were below 6.5 percent.
b Layoffs are not the only cost-cutting 
measure the Postal Service is consider-
ing. Over the past several years, postal offi-
cials have proposed ending Saturday 
delivery service and have recently sug-
gested closing more than 3,600 post offices 
and other facilities. The Postal Service is a 
semi-independent federal agency, and its 
operating expenses are primarily paid for by 
those who use the service. However, the 
Postal Service must receive congressional 
approval to undertake actions such as em-
ployee layoffs, delivery schedule changes, 
and office closings. The need for congres-
sional approval makes it much more diffi-
cult and time-consuming for the Postal 
Service to proceed with cost-cutting mea-
sures than if the service were a private firm.
c The U.S. Postal Service reported a loss 
of $8 billion in 2010 and expected to 
lose that much or more in 2011. The recent 
losses resulted primarily from a drop in the 
volume of mail being sent, with 32  billion 
fewer items being mailed in 2010 than in 
2008. In addition to this drop in volume, the 
postal system added an  additional 1.7 mil-
lion new addresses for mail delivery during 
this time, adding to its costs at a time of 
declining revenue.
Thinking Critically
1. The article indicates that much of the 
Postal Service’s financial difficulties 
have arisen due to a decline in advertis-
ing and to a loss of mail to the Internet. 
Assuming that the Postal Service does 
eliminate 120,000 jobs, would it be best 
to think of these laid-off workers as be-
ing frictionally, structurally, or cyclically 
unemployed? Briefly explain.
2. The figure indicates that the unemploy-
ment rate in the construction sector in 
August 2011 was 13.5 percent, which 
was almost 50 percent greater than the 
overall unemployment rate. Beginning 
in 2006, housing construction entered a 
period of decline that some economists 
believed might last for several years. 
If housing construction had entered a 
long-lived period of decline, how should 
we characterize the unemployment 
in construction: frictional, structural, 
 cyclical, or some combination of these 
types?

Summary
The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics uses the results of the 
monthly household survey to calculate the unemployment 
rate, the labor force participation rate, and the employment–
population  ratio. The labor force is the total number of people 
who have jobs plus the number of people who do not have jobs 
but are actively looking for them. The unemployment rate is 
the percentage of the labor force that is unemployed. Discour-
aged workers are people who are available for work but who 
are not actively looking for a job because they believe no jobs 
are available for them. Discouraged workers are not counted as 
 unemployed. The labor force participation rate is the percent-
age of the working-age population in the labor force. Since 1950, 
the labor force participation rate of women has been rising, 
while the labor force participation rate of men has been falling. 
The employment– population ratio measures the percentage of  
the working-age population that is employed. Asians, whites, and 
college graduates have  below-average unemployment rates. Afri-
can Americans, Hispanics, and high school dropouts have above-
average unemployment rates. Except during severe recessions, the 
typical unemployed person finds a new job or returns to his or her 
previous job within a few months. Each year, millions of jobs are 
created in the United States, and millions of jobs are destroyed.

the unemployment rate remained the same. Shouldn’t the 
unemployment rate fall when the number of people em-
ployed increases? Briefly explain.
 1.11 [Related to the Making the Connection on page 648]  
An article published in the New York Times in July 2011 
argued that: “For the second straight year, the recovery in 
the job market has essentially stalled. This chart, showing 
the share of adults with jobs, offers the best summary you’ll 
find.” The “share of adults with jobs” is known more for-
mally as the employment-population ratio. Why might the 
employment-population ratio provide the “best summary” 
of the state of the job market rather than the unemploy-
ment rate?

two million jobs during this time period? If not, what was 
President Obama referring to?

Types of Unemployment, pages 651–654
 20.2 
LEARNING OBJECTIVE: Identify the three types of unemployment.
Summary
There are three types of unemployment: frictional, structural, and 
cyclical. Frictional unemployment is short-term unemployment 
that arises from the process of matching workers with jobs. One 
type of frictional unemployment is seasonal unemployment, which 
refers to unemployment due to factors such as weather, variations 
in tourism, and other calendar-related events. Structural unem-
ployment arises from a persistent mismatch between the job skills 
or attributes of workers and the requirements of jobs. Cyclical un-
employment is caused by a business cycle recession. The natural 
rate of unemployment is the normal rate of unemployment, con-
sisting of structural unemployment and frictional unemployment. 
The natural rate of unemployment is also sometimes called the 
full-employment rate of unemployment.

2.5 A politician makes the following argument: “The economy 
would operate more efficiently if frictional unemployment 
were eliminated. Therefore, a goal of government policy 
should be to reduce the frictional rate of unemployment 
to the lowest possible level.” Briefly explain whether you 
agree with this argument.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE: Explain what factors determine the unemployment rate.
Summary
Government policies can reduce the level of frictional and struc-
tural unemployment by aiding the search for jobs and the retrain-
ing of workers. Some government policies, however, can add to the 
level of frictional and structural unemployment. Unemployment 
insurance payments can raise the unemployment rate by extend-
ing the time that unemployed workers search for jobs. Govern-
ment policies have caused the unemployment rates in most other 
high-income countries typically to be higher than in the United

b. The minimum wage is abolished.
 
c. Most U.S. workers join labor unions.
 
d. More companies make information on job openings

3.8 An economic consultant studies the labor policies of a 
firm where it is difficult to monitor workers and prepares 
a report in which she recommends that the firm raise 
employee wages. At a meeting of the firm’s managers to 
discuss the report, one manager makes the following argu-
ment: “I think the wages we are paying are fine. As long as 
enough people are willing to work here at the wages we are 
currently paying, why should we raise them?” What argu-
ment can the economic consultant make to justify her ad-
vice that the firm should increase its wages?
 
3.9 Costco typically pays its workers higher wages than does 
Wal-Mart. One analyst argues that Costco pays higher 
wages “because it requires higher-skilled workers to sell 
higher-cost products to more affluent customers.” If this 
analyst is correct, can we conclude that Costco is paying 
efficiency wages and Wal-Mart is not? Briefly explain.

Measuring Inflation, pages 656–660
 20.4 
LEARNING OBJECTIVE: Define price level and inflation rate and understand how they are computed.
Summary
The price level measures the average prices of goods and ser-
vices. The inflation rate is equal to the percentage change in the 
price level from one year to the next. The federal government 
compiles statistics on three different measures of the price level: 
the  consumer price index (CPI), the GDP price deflator, and the 
producer price index (PPI). The consumer price index (CPI) is 
an average of the prices of goods and services purchased by the 
typical urban family of four. Changes in the CPI are the best mea-
sure of changes in the cost of living as experienced by the typical 
household. Biases in the construction of the CPI cause changes 
in it to overstate the true inflation rate by 0.5 percentage point to  
1 percentage point. The producer price index (PPI) is an average 
of prices received by producers of goods and services at all stages 
of production.

States. Wages above market levels can also increase unemployment. 
Wages may be above market levels because of the minimum wage, 
labor unions, and efficiency wages. An efficiency wage is a higher-
than-market wage that a firm pays to increase worker productivity.

over time, not the absolute level of prices. To correct for the effects 
of inflation, we can divide a nominal variable by a price index and 
multiply by 100 to obtain a real variable. The real variable will be 
measured in dollars of the base year for the price index.

Problems and Applications
 
5.3 [Related to Solved Problem 20.5 on page 661] In 1924, 
the famous novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote an article for 
the Saturday Evening Post titled “How to Live on $36,000 a 
Year,” in which he wondered how he and his wife had man-
aged to spend all of that very high income without saving 
any of it. The CPI in 1924 was 17, and the CPI in 2010 was 
218. What income would you have needed in 2010 to have 
had the same purchasing power that Fitzgerald’s $36,000 
had in 1924? Be sure to show your calculation.

Real versus Nominal Interest Rates, pages 662–663
 20.6 
LEARNING OBJECTIVE: Distinguish between the nominal interest rate and the real interest rate.
Summary
The stated interest rate on a loan is the nominal interest rate. The 
real interest rate is the nominal interest rate minus the inflation 
rate. Because it is corrected for the effects of inflation, the real in-
terest rate provides a better measure of the true cost of borrowing 
and the true return from lending than does the nominal interest 
rate. The nominal interest rate is always greater than the real inter-
est rate unless the economy experiences deflation. Deflation is a 
decline in the price level.

6.1 What is the difference between the nominal interest rate 
and the real interest rate?
 
6.2 If inflation is expected to increase, what will happen to the 
nominal interest rate? Briefly explain.
 
6.3 The chapter explains that it is impossible to know whether 
a particular nominal interest rate is “high” or “low.” Briefly

6.5 The following appeared in a newspaper article: “Inflation 
in the Lehigh Valley during the first quarter of [the year] 
was less than half the national rate. . . . So, unlike much

in this situation? (Hint: What is the annual inflation rate, if 
the monthly inflation rate is 4 percent?)

and that at the beginning of the year, the price of a ham-
burger is $2.00. Suppose you lend $1,000 for one year at 
an interest rate of 5 percent. At the end of the year, a ham-
burger costs $2.08. What is the real rate of interest you 
earned on your loan?
 
6.9 During the 1990s, Japan experienced periods of deflation 
and low nominal interest rates that approached zero per-

rates in Japan also low during this period?)
Does Inflation Impose Costs on the Economy? pages 663–666
 20.7 
LEARNING OBJECTIVE: Discuss the problems that inflation causes.
Summary
Inflation does not reduce the affordability of goods and services to 
the average consumer, but it does impose costs on the economy. 
When inflation is anticipated, its main costs are that paper money 
loses some of its value and firms incur menu costs. Menu costs in-
clude the costs of changing prices on products and printing new cat-
alogs. When inflation is unanticipated, the actual inflation rate can 
turn out to be different from the expected inflation rate. As a result, 
income is redistributed as some people gain and some people lose.

7.7 Suppose James and Frank both retire this year. For in-
come from retirement, James will rely on a pension from 
his company that pays him a fixed $2,500 per month for 
as long as he lives. James hasn’t saved anything for retire-
ment. Frank has no pension but has saved a considerable 
amount, which he has invested in certificates of deposit 
(CDs) at his bank. Currently, Frank’s CDs pay him interest 
of $2,300 per month.
 
a. Ten years from now, is James or Frank likely to have a 
higher real income? In your answer, be sure to define 
real income.
 
b. Now suppose that instead of being a constant amount, 
James’s pension increases each year by the same percentage 
as the CPI. For example, if the CPI increases by 5 percent in 
the first year after James retires, then his pension in the sec-
ond year equals +2,500 + (+2,500 * 0.05) = +2,625. 
In this case, 10 years from now, is James or Frank likely to 
have a higher real income?
 
7.8 Suppose that News Corporation, the owner of the Wall 
Street Journal, and the investors buying the firm’s bonds 
both expect a 2 percent inflation rate for the year. Given 
this expectation, suppose the nominal interest rate on the 
bonds is 6 percent and the real interest rate is 4 percent. 
Suppose that a year after the investors purchase the bonds, 
the inflation rate turns out to be 6 percent, rather than the 
2 percent that had been expected. Who gains and who 
loses from the unexpectedly high inflation rate?
 
7.9 [Related to the Making the Connection on page 665] 
During the late nineteenth century in the United States, 
many farmers borrowed heavily to buy land. During most 
of the period between 1870 and the mid-1890s, the United 
States experienced mild deflation: The price level declined 
each year. Many farmers engaged in political protests dur-
ing these years, and deflation was often a subject of their 
protests. Explain why farmers would have felt burdened by 
deflation.

Economics in Your Life
Do You Help the Economy More if You Spend or if You Save?
Suppose that you have received an income tax refund check from the U.S. government. You are 
not sure what to do with the money, so you ask your two roommates for advice. One roommate 
tells you that if you want to help the economy, you should save all the money because a country’s 
economic growth depends on the amount of saving by households. The other roommate disagrees 
and advises you to spend all the money because consumer spending is a major component of gross 
domestic product (GDP), and your spending would help increase production and create more jobs. 
Which of your two roommates is right? As you read this chapter, see if you can answer this ques-
tion. You can check your answer against the one we provide on page 702 at the end of this chapter.
United States and much of the rest of the 
world was experiencing a period of strong 
economic growth. As the U.S. and world 
economies entered a recession in 2008, Boe-
ing’s orders fell to 662, and then plummeted 
to 142 in 2009. As the economy improved 
in 2010, Boeing’s orders rebounded to 530. 
In 2011, Randy Tinseth, vice president for 
marketing at Boeing Commercial Airplanes, 
predicted that, despite the recent short-run 
swings in orders, long-run prospects for 
the airline industry were good: “Not only is 
there strong demand for air travel and new 
airplanes today, but the fundamental drivers 
of air travel—including economic growth, 
world trade and liberalization—all point to 
a healthy long-term demand.”
In this chapter, we provide an overview 
of long-run growth and the business cycle 
and discuss their importance for firms, for 
consumers, and for the economy as a whole.

In December 1903, at Kitty Hawk, North 
Carolina, the Wright Flyer became the first 
human-piloted, machine-powered, heavier-
than-air craft to fly—for all of 12 seconds 
and a distance of 120 feet. Roughly a century 
later, on November 10, 2005, the Boeing 777-
200LR became the first commercial aircraft 
to fly nonstop more than halfway around the 
world—for 22 hours and 42 minutes, across 
13,422 miles. This tremendous advance in 
aviation technology has been matched by 
technological progress in many other areas 
of the economy. In this chapter, we begin 
to explore how technological change has 
a ffected the standard of living in the United 
States and elsewhere around the world.
William Boeing established the Boeing 
Company in 1916. Today, Boeing is one of 
the world’s largest manufacturers of com-
mercial jetliners, military aircraft, satellites, 
missiles, and defense systems. The company 
employs more than 165,000 people in 70 
countries. Boeing’s experiences have often 
mirrored two key macroeconomic facts: In 
the long run, the U.S. economy has experi-
enced economic growth, and in the short 
run, the economy has experienced a series 
of business cycles. Boeing has also experi-
enced growth over the long run, while being 
affected by the business cycle.

orders for new commercial jets, as the

C H A P T E R  2 1  Economic Growth, the Financial System, and Business Cycles
A 
successful economy is capable of increasing production of goods and services 
faster than the growth in population. Attaining this level of growth is the only 
way that the standard of living of the average person in a country can increase. 
Unfortunately, many economies around the world are not growing at all or are 
growing very slowly. Most people in those countries live on about the same levels of income 
as their ancestors did decades, or even centuries, ago. In the United States and other devel-
oped countries, however, incomes and living standards are much higher today than they 
were 50 years ago. An important macroeconomic topic is why some countries grow much 
faster than others.
As we will see, one determinant of economic growth is the ability of firms to expand 
their operations, buy additional equipment, train workers, and adopt new technologies. 
To carry out these activities, firms must acquire funds from households, either directly 
through financial markets—such as the stock and bond markets—or indirectly through 
financial intermediaries—such as banks. Financial markets and financial intermediaries 
together comprise the financial system. In this chapter, we present an overview of the fi-
nancial system and see how funds flow from households to firms through the market for 
loanable funds.
Since at least the early nineteenth century, the U.S. economy has experienced periods 
of expanding production and employment followed by periods of recession during which 
production and employment decline. As we noted in Chapter 19, these alternating periods 
of expansion and recession are called the business cycle. The business cycle is not uniform: 
Each period of expansion is not the same length, nor is each period of recession, but every 
period of expansion in U.S. history has been followed by a period of recession, and every 
period of recession has been followed by a period of expansion.
In this chapter, we begin to explore two key aspects of macroeconomics: the long-run 
growth that has steadily raised living standards in the United States and the short-run fluc-
tuations of the business cycle.
Long-Run Economic Growth
Most people in the United States, Western Europe, Japan, and other high-income 
countries expect that over time, their standard of living will improve. They expect that 
year after year, firms will introduce new and improved products, new prescription 
drugs and better surgical techniques will overcome more diseases, and their ability to 
afford these goods and services will increase. For most people, these are reasonable 
expectations.
In 1900, the United States was already enjoying the highest standard of living in the 
world. Yet in that year, only 3 percent of U.S. homes had electricity, only 15 percent had 
indoor flush toilets, and only 25 percent had running water. The lack of running water 
meant that before people could cook or bathe, they had to pump water from wells and 
haul it to their homes in buckets—on average about 10,000 gallons per year per family. 
Not surprisingly, water consumption averaged only about 5 gallons per person per day, 
compared with about 150 gallons today. The result was that people washed themselves 
and their clothing only infrequently. A majority of families living in cities had to use out-
door toilets, which they shared with other families. Diseases such as smallpox, typhus, 
dysentery, and cholera were still common. In 1900, 5,000 of the 45,000 children born 
in Chicago died before their first birthday. Life expectancy at birth was about 47 years, 
compared with 78 years in 2011. Few families had electric lights, relying instead on the 
limited illumination provided by burning candles or burning kerosene or coal oil in 
lamps. Many homes were heated in the winter by burning coal, which contributed to

the severe pollution that fouled the air of most large cities. There were no modern appli-
ances, and most women worked inside the home at least 80 hours per week. The typical 
American homemaker in 1900 baked a half-ton of bread per year.
The process of long-run economic growth brought the typical American from 
the standard of living of 1900 to the standard of living of today. The best measure of 
the standard of living is real GDP per person, which is usually referred to as real GDP 
per capita. So, we measure long-run economic growth by increases in real GDP per 
capita over long periods of time, generally decades or more. We use real GDP rather 
than nominal GDP to adjust for changes in the price level over time. Figure 21.1  
shows the growth in real GDP per capita in the United States from 1900 to 2010. The 
figure shows that although real GDP per capita fluctuates because of the short-run 
effects of the business cycle, over the long run, the trend is strongly upward. It is the 
upward trend in real GDP per capita that we focus on when discussing long-run eco-
nomic growth.
The values in Figure 21.1 are measured in prices of the year 2005, so they represent 
constant amounts of purchasing power. In 1900, real GDP per capita was about $5,600. 
Over a century later, in 2010, it had risen to about $42,200, which means that the aver-
age American in 2010 could purchase nearly eight times as many goods and services as 
the average American in 1900. Large as it is, this increase in real GDP per capita actually 
understates the true increase in the standard of living of Americans in 2010 compared 
with 1900. Many of today’s goods and services were not available in 1900. For example, 
if you lived in 1900 and became ill with a serious infection, you would have been un-
able to purchase antibiotics to treat your illness—no matter how high your income. You 
might have died from an illness for which even a very poor person in today’s society 
could receive effective medical treatment. Of course, the quantity of goods and services 
that a person can buy is not a perfect measure of how happy or contented that person 
may be. The level of education, life expectancy, crime, spiritual well-being, pollution, 
and many other factors ignored in calculating GDP contribute to a person’s happiness. 
Nevertheless, economists rely heavily on comparisons of real GDP per capita because it 
is the best means of comparing the performance of one economy over time or the per-
formance of different economies at any particular time.

C H A P T E R  2 1  Economic Growth, the Financial System, and Business Cycles
The Connection between Economic 
Prosperity and Health
We can see the direct effect of economic growth on living 
standards by looking at improvements in health in high-
income countries over the past 100 years. The research of Robert Fogel, winner of 
the Nobel Prize in Economics, highlights the close connection between economic 
growth, improvements in technology, and improvements in human physiology. One 
important measure of health is life expectancy at birth. As the graph below shows, in 
1900, life expectancy was less than 50 years in the United States, the United Kingdom, 
and France. Today, life expectancy is about 80 years. Although life expectancies in 
the lowest-income countries remain very short, some countries that have begun to 
experience economic growth have seen dramatic increases in life expectancies. For 
example, life expectancy in India has more than doubled from 27 years in 1900 to 
67 years today.
Many economists believe there is a link between health and economic growth. In 
the United States and Western Europe during the nineteenth century, improvements 
in agricultural technology and rising incomes led to dramatic improvements in the 
nutrition of the average person. The development of the germ theory of disease and 
technological progress in the purification of water in the late nineteenth century led to 
sharp declines in sickness due to waterborne diseases. As people became taller, stron-
ger, and less susceptible to disease, they also became more productive. Today, econo-
mists studying economic development have put increasing emphasis on the need for 
low-income countries to reduce disease and increase nutrition if they are to experience 
economic growth.

Many researchers believe that the state of human physiology will continue to im-
prove as technology advances. In high-income countries, life expectancy at birth is 
expected to rise from about 80 years today to about 90 years by the middle of the 
twenty-first century. Technological advances will continue to reduce the average num-
ber of hours worked per day and the number of years the average person spends in the 
paid workforce. Individuals spend about 10 hours per day sleeping, eating, and bath-
ing. Their remaining “discretionary hours” are divided between paid work and leisure. 
The graph on the next page is based on estimates by Robert Fogel that contrast how 
individuals in the United States will divide their time in 2040 compared with 1880 and 
1995. Not only will technology and economic growth allow people in the near future 
to live longer lives, but a much smaller fraction of those lives will need to be spent at 
paid work.

the 
Connection

 
Long-Run Economic Growth

Calculating Growth Rates and the Rule of 70
The growth rate of real GDP or real GDP per capita during a particular year is equal to 
the percentage change from the previous year. For example, measured in prices of the 
year 2005, real GDP equaled $12,703 billion in 2009 and rose to $13,088 billion in 2010. 
We calculate the growth of real GDP in 2010 as:
a +13,088 billion  - +12,703 billion
+12,703 billion
b * 100 = 3.0%.
For longer periods of time, we can use the average annual growth rate. For example, 
real GDP in the United States was $2,004 billion in 1950 and $13,088 billion in 2010. 
To find the average annual growth rate during this 60-year period, we compute the an-
nual growth rate that would result in $2,004 billion increasing to $13,088 billion over 
60 years. In this case, the growth rate is 3.2 percent. That is, if $2,004 billion grows at an 
average rate of 3.2 percent per year, after 60 years, it will have grown to $13,088 billion.
For shorter periods of time, we get approximately the same answer by averaging the 
growth rate for each year. For example, real GDP in the United States fell by 0.3 percent 
in 2008, fell by 3.5 percent in 2009, and grew by 3.0 percent in 2010. So, the average an-
nual growth rate of real GDP for the period 2008–2010 was -0.3 percent, which is the 
average of the three annual growth rates:
-0.3% + (-3.5%) + 3.0%
3
= -0.3%
Note that during this period, the “growth” rate was actually negative because real GDP 
declined during the recession years of 2008 and 2009. Finally, when discussing long-run 
economic growth, we usually shorten “average annual growth rate” to “growth rate.”
We can judge how rapidly an economic variable is growing by calculating the 
number of years it would take to double. For example, if real GDP per capita in a 
country doubles, say, every 20 years, most people in the country will experience sig-
nificant increases in their standard of living over the course of their lives. If real GDP 
per capita doubles only every 100 years, increases in the standard of living will occur 
too slowly to notice. One easy way to calculate approximately how many years it will

take real GDP per capita to double is to use the rule of 70. The formula for the rule of 
70 is as follows:
Number of years to double =
70
Growth rate.
For example, if real GDP per capita is growing at a rate of 5 percent per year, it will dou-
ble in 70>5 = 14 years. If real GDP per capita is growing at a rate of 2 percent per year, 
it will take 70>2 = 35 years to double. These examples illustrate an important point that 
we will discuss further in Chapter 22: Small differences in growth rates can have large 
 effects on how rapidly the standard of living in a country increases. Finally, notice that 
the rule of 70 applies not just to growth in real GDP per capita but to growth in any vari-
able. For example, if you invest $1,000 in the stock market, and your investment grows 
at an average annual rate of 7 percent, your investment will double to $2,000 in 10 years.
What Determines the Rate of Long-Run Growth?
In Chapter 22, we will explore the sources of economic growth in more detail and dis-
cuss why growth in the United States and other high-income countries has been so 
much faster than growth in low-income countries. For now, we will focus on the ba-
sic point that increases in real GDP per capita depend on increases in labor productivity. 
Labor productivity is the quantity of goods and services that can be produced by one 
worker or by one hour of work. In analyzing long-run growth, economists usually mea-
sure labor productivity as output per hour of work to avoid the effects of fluctuations in 
the length of the workday and in the fraction of the population employed. If the quan-
tity of goods and services consumed by the average person is to increase, the quantity 
of goods and services produced per hour of work must also increase. Why in 2010 was 
the average American able to consume almost eight times as many goods and services as 
the average American in 1900? Because the average American worker in 2010 was eight 
times as productive as the average American worker in 1900.
If increases in labor productivity are the key to long-run economic growth, what 
causes labor productivity to increase? Economists believe two key factors determine la-
bor productivity: the quantity of capital per hour worked and the level of technology. 
Therefore, economic growth occurs if the quantity of capital per hour worked increases 
and if technological change occurs.
Increases in Capital per Hour Worked Workers today in high-income countries 
such as the United States have more physical capital available than workers in low-income 
countries or workers in the high-income countries of 100 years ago. Recall that capital re-
fers to manufactured goods that are used to produce other goods and services. Examples of 
capital are computers, factory buildings, machine tools, warehouses, and trucks. The total 
amount of physical capital available in a country is known as the country’s capital stock.
As the capital stock per hour worked increases, worker productivity increases. A 
secretary who uses a personal computer can produce more documents per day than a 
secretary who uses only a typewriter. A worker who uses a backhoe can excavate more 
earth than a worker who uses only a shovel.
Human capital refers to the accumulated knowledge and skills workers acquire 
from education and training or from their life experiences. For example, workers with a 
college education generally have more skills and are more productive than workers who 
have only a high school degree. Increases in human capital are particularly important in 
stimulating economic growth.
Technological Change Economic growth depends more on technological change 
than on increases in capital per hour worked. Technology refers to the processes a firm 
uses to turn inputs into outputs of goods and services. Technological change is an increase 
in the quantity of output firms can produce, using a given quantity of inputs. Technologi-
cal change can come from many sources. For example, a firm’s managers may rearrange a 
factory floor or the layout of a retail store to increase production and sales. Most techno-
logical change, however, is embodied in new machinery, equipment, or software.
Labor productivity The quantity 
of goods and services that can be 
produced by one worker or by one 
hour of work.
Capital Manufactured goods that 
are used to produce other goods and 
services.

 
Long-Run Economic Growth 
683
A very important point is that just accumulating more inputs—such as labor, capital, 
and natural resources—will not ensure that an economy experiences economic growth 
unless technological change also occurs. For example, the Soviet Union failed to maintain 
a high rate of economic growth, even though it continued to increase the quantity of capi-
tal available per hour worked, because it experienced relatively little technological change.
In implementing technological change, entrepreneurs are of crucial importance. Recall 
from Chapter 2 that an entrepreneur is someone who operates a business, bringing together 
the factors of production—labor, capital, and natural resources—to produce goods and 
services. In a market economy, entrepreneurs make the crucial decisions about whether 
to introduce new technology to produce better or lower-cost products. Entrepreneurs also 
decide whether to allocate a firm’s resources to research and development that can result in 
new technologies. One of the difficulties centrally planned economies have in sustaining 
economic growth is that managers employed by the government are usually much slower 
to develop and adopt new technologies than entrepreneurs in a market system.
increases in capital per hour worked, increases in the labor 
force participation rate, and the transfer of workers from 
agricultural to nonagricultural jobs than on technological 
change. If Young’s analysis was correct, predict what was 
likely to happen to Singapore’s growth rate in the years after 
1995.
Solving the Problem
Step 1: Review the chapter material. This problem is about what determines the rate 
of long-run growth, so you may want to review the section “What Determines 
the Rate of Long-Run Growth?” which begins on page 682.
Step 2: Predict what happened to the growth rate in Singapore after 1995. As 
countries begin to develop, they often experience an increase in the labor 
force participation rate, as workers who are not part of the paid labor force re-
spond to rising wage rates. Many workers also leave the agricultural sector—
where output per hour worked is often low—for the nonagricultural sector. 
These changes increase real GDP per capita, but they are “one-shot” changes 
that eventually come to an end, as the labor force participation rate and the 
fraction of the labor force outside agriculture both approach the levels found 
in high-income countries. Similarly, as we already noted, increases in capital 
per hour worked cannot sustain high rates of economic growth unless they 
are accompanied by technological change.
We can conclude that Singapore was unlikely to sustain its high growth 
rates in the years after 1995. In fact, from 1996 to 2010, the growth of real 
GDP per capita slowed to an average rate of 3.2 percent per year. Although 
this growth rate is comparable to rates experienced in high-income countries, 
such as the United States, it leads to a doubling of real GDP per capita only 
every 21.9 years rather than every 11.3 years.

The Role of Technological  
Change in Growth
Between 1960 and 1995, real GDP per capita in Singapore 
grew at an average annual rate of 6.2 percent. This very 
rapid growth rate results in the level of real GDP per capita 
doubling about every 11.3 years. In 1995, Alwyn Young of 
the London School of Economics published an article in 
which he argued that Singapore’s growth depended more on

C H A P T E R  2 1  Economic Growth, the Financial System, and Business Cycles
Finally, an additional requirement for economic growth is that the government 
must provide secure rights to private property. As we saw in Chapter 2, a market system 
cannot function unless rights to private property are secure. In addition, the govern-
ment can help the market work and aid economic growth by establishing an indepen-
dent court system that enforces contracts between private individuals. Many economists 
would also say that the government has a role in facilitating the development of an ef-
ficient financial system, as well as systems of education, transportation, and communi-
cation. Economist Richard Sylla of New York University has argued that every country 
that has experienced economic growth first experienced a “financial revolution.” For 
example, before the United States was able to experience significant economic growth 
in the early nineteenth century, the country’s banking and monetary systems were 
 reformed under the guidance of Alexander Hamilton, who was appointed the coun-
try’s first secretary of the Treasury in 1789. Without supportive government policies, 
 long-run economic growth is unlikely to occur.
What Explains Rapid Economic 
Growth in Botswana?
Economic growth in much of sub-Saharan Africa has been 
very slow. As desperately poor as most of these countries were 
in 1960, some are even poorer today. The growth rate in one 
country in this region stands out, however, as being exceptionally rapid. The graph be-
low shows the average annual growth rate in real GDP per capita between 1960 and 2009 
for Botswana and the six most populous sub-Saharan countries. Botswana’s average an-
nual growth rate over this 49-year period was three times as great as that of Tanzania and 
South Africa, which were the second and third-fastest-growing countries in the group. 
Botswana may seem an unlikely country to experience rapid growth because it has been 
hard hit by the HIV epidemic. Despite the disruptive effects of the epidemic, growth in 
real per capita GDP continued to be rapid, with the International Monetary Fund pro-
jecting increases in real GDP per capita of 5.9 percent in 2010 and 5.0 percent in 2011.

Long-Run Economic Growth 
685
Potential GDP
Because economists take a long-run perspective in discussing economic growth, the 
concept of potential GDP is useful. Potential GDP is the level of real GDP attained 
when all firms are producing at capacity. The capacity of a firm is not the maximum 
output the firm is capable of producing. A Boeing assembly plant could operate 
24 hours per day for 52 weeks per year and would be at its maximum production level. 
The plant’s capacity, however, is measured by its production when operating on nor-
mal hours, using a normal workforce. If all firms in the economy were operating at 
capacity, the level of total production of final goods and services would equal potential 
GDP. Potential GDP increases over time as the labor force grows, new factories and of-
fice buildings are built, new machinery and equipment are installed, and technological 
change takes place.
Growth in potential GDP in the United States is estimated to be about 3.3 per-
cent per year. In other words, each year, the capacity of the economy to produce final 
goods and services expands by 3.3 percent. The actual level of real GDP may increase 
by more or less than 3.3 percent as the economy moves through the business cycle. 
 Figure 21.2 shows movements in actual and potential GDP for the years since 1989. 
The smooth red line represents potential GDP, and the blue line represents actual real 
GDP. Notice that in each of the three recessions since 1989, actual real GDP has fallen 
below potential GDP. During the 2007–2009 recession, the gap between actual real 
GDP and potential GDP was particularly large, which is an indication of how severe 
the recession was.
Potential GDP The level of real GDP 
attained when all firms are producing 
at capacity.
What explains Botswana’s rapid growth rate? Several factors have been important. 
Botswana avoided the civil wars that plagued other African countries during these 
years. The country also benefited from earnings from diamond exports. But many econ-
omists believe the pro-growth policies of Botswana’s government are the most impor-
tant reason for the country’s success. Economists Shantayanan Devarajan of the World 
Bank, William Easterly of New York University, and Howard Pack of the University of 
 Pennsylvania summarized these policies as follows:
The government [of Botswana] made it clear it would protect private property 
rights. It was a “government of cattlemen” who were attuned to commercial 
 interests. . . . The relative political stability and relatively low corruption also 
made Botswana a favorable location for investment. Botswana’s relatively high 
level of press freedom and democracy (continuing a pre-colonial tradition that 
held chiefs responsible to tribal members) held the government responsible for 
any economic policy mistakes.
These policies—protecting private property, avoiding political instability and 
 corruption, and allowing press freedom and democracy—may seem a straightforward 
recipe for providing an environment in which economic growth can occur. As we will 
see in Chapter 22, however, in practice, these are policies many countries have difficulty 
implementing successfully.

C H A P T E R  2 1  Economic Growth, the Financial System, and Business Cycles
Saving, Investment, and 
the Financial System
The process of economic growth depends on the ability of firms to expand their op-
erations, buy additional equipment, train workers, and adopt new technologies. Firms 
can finance some of these activities from retained earnings, which are profits that are 
reinvested in the firm rather than paid to the firm’s owners. For many firms, retained 
earnings are not sufficient to finance the rapid expansion required in economies ex-
periencing high rates of economic growth. Firms can acquire funds from households, 
either directly through financial markets—such as the stock and bond markets—or in-
directly through financial intermediaries—such as banks. Financial markets and finan-
cial intermediaries together comprise the financial system. Without a well-functioning 
financial system, economic growth is impossible because firms will be unable to expand 
and adopt new technologies. As we noted earlier, no country without a well-developed 
financial system has been able to sustain high levels of economic growth.
An Overview of the Financial System
The financial system channels funds from savers to borrowers and channels returns on 
the borrowed funds back to savers. Recall from Chapter 8 that in financial markets, 
such as the stock market or the bond market, firms raise funds by selling financial se-
curities directly to savers. A financial security is a document—sometimes in electronic 
form—that states the terms under which funds pass from the buyer of the security—
who is providing funds—to the seller. Stocks are financial securities that represent partial

ownership of a firm. If you buy one share of stock in General Electric, you become one 
of millions of owners of that firm. Bonds are financial securities that represent promises 
to repay a fixed amount of funds. When General Electric sells a bond, the firm promises 
to pay the purchaser of the bond an interest payment each year for the term of the bond, 
as well as a final payment of the amount of the loan.
Financial intermediaries, such as banks, mutual funds, pension funds, and insur-
ance companies, act as go-betweens for borrowers and lenders. In effect, financial in-
termediaries borrow funds from savers and lend them to borrowers. When you deposit 
funds in your checking account, you are lending your funds to the bank. The bank may 
lend your funds (together with the funds of other savers) to an entrepreneur who wants 
to start a business. Suppose Lena wants to open a laundry. Rather than you lending 
money directly to Lena’s Laundry, the bank acts as a go-between for you and Lena. In-
termediaries pool the funds of many small savers to lend to many individual borrowers. 
The intermediaries pay interest to savers in exchange for the use of savers’ funds and 
earn a profit by lending money to borrowers and charging borrowers a higher rate of 
interest on the loans. For example, a bank might pay you as a depositor a 3 percent rate 
of interest, while it lends the money to Lena’s Laundry at a 6 percent rate of interest.
Banks, mutual funds, pension funds, and insurance companies also make invest-
ments in stocks and bonds on behalf of savers. For example, mutual funds sell shares 
to savers and then use the funds to buy a portfolio of stocks, bonds, mortgages, and 
other financial securities. Large mutual fund companies, such as Fidelity, Vanguard, and 
Dreyfus, offer many stock and bond funds. Some funds hold a wide range of stocks 
or bonds; others specialize in securities issued by a particular industry or sector, such 
as technology; and others invest as index funds in fixed market baskets of securities, 
such as shares of the Standard & Poor’s 500 firms. Over the past 30 years, the role of 
mutual funds in the financial system has increased dramatically. Today, competition 
among hundreds of mutual fund firms gives investors thousands of funds from which 
to choose.
In addition to matching households that have excess funds with firms that want to 
borrow funds, the financial system provides three key services for savers and borrow-
ers: risk sharing, liquidity, and information. Risk is the chance that the value of a finan-
cial security will change relative to what you expect. For example, you may buy a share  
of stock in Google at a price of $450, only to have the price fall to $100. Most individual 
savers are not gamblers and seek a steady return on their savings rather than erratic 
swings between high and low earnings. The financial system provides risk sharing by 
allowing savers to spread their money among many financial investments. For example, 
you can divide your money among a bank certificate of deposit, individual bonds, and 
a mutual fund.
Liquidity is the ease with which a financial security can be exchanged for money. 
The financial system provides the service of liquidity by providing savers with markets 
in which they can sell their holdings of financial securities. For example, savers can eas-
ily sell their holdings of the stocks and bonds issued by large corporations on the major 
stock and bond markets.
A third service that the financial system provides savers is the collection and com-
munication of information, or facts about borrowers and expectations about returns on 
financial securities. For example, Lena’s Laundry may want to borrow $10,000 from you. 
Finding out what Lena intends to do with the funds and how likely she is to pay you 
back may be costly and time-consuming. By depositing $10,000 in the bank, you are, in  
effect, allowing the bank to gather this information for you. Because banks specialize  
in gathering information on borrowers, they are able to do it faster and at a lower cost 
than can individual savers. The financial system plays an important role in communi-
cating information. If you read a news story announcing that an automobile firm has 
invented a car with an engine that runs on water, how would you determine the effect of 
that discovery on the firm’s profits? Financial markets do the job for you by incorporat-
ing information into the prices of stocks, bonds, and other financial securities. In this 
example, the expectation of higher future profits would boost the prices of the automo-
bile firm’s stock and bonds.

C H A P T E R  2 1  Economic Growth, the Financial System, and Business Cycles
The Macroeconomics of Saving and Investment
As we have seen, the funds available to firms through the financial system come from 
saving. When firms use funds to purchase machinery, factories, and office buildings, 
they are engaging in investment. In this section, we explore the macroeconomics of sav-
ing and investment. A key point we will develop is that the total value of saving in the 
economy must equal the total value of investment. We saw in Chapter 19 that national 
income accounting refers to the methods the Bureau of Economic Analysis uses to keep 
track of total production and total income in the economy. We can use some relation-
ships from national income accounting to understand why total saving must equal total 
investment.
We begin with the relationship between GDP (Y) and its components, consump-
tion (C), investment (I), government purchases (G), and net exports (NX):
Y = C + I + G + NX.
Remember that GDP is a measure of both total production in the economy and total 
income.
In an open economy, there is interaction with other economies in terms of both 
trading of goods and services and borrowing and lending. All economies today are 
open economies, although they vary significantly in the extent of their openness. In a 
closed economy, there is no trading or borrowing and lending with other economies. For 
simplicity, we will develop the relationship between saving and investment for a closed 
economy. This allows us to focus on the most important points in a simpler framework. 
We will consider the case of an open economy in Chapter 29.
In a closed economy, net exports are zero, so we can rewrite the relationship be-
tween GDP and its components as
Y = C + I + G.
If we rearrange this relationship, we have an expression for investment in terms of the 
other variables:
I = Y - C - G.
This expression tells us that in a closed economy, investment spending is equal to total 
income minus consumption spending and minus government purchases.
We can also derive an expression for total saving. Private saving is equal to what 
households retain of their income after purchasing goods and services (C) and paying 
taxes (T). Households receive income for supplying the factors of production to firms. 
This portion of household income is equal to Y. Households also receive income from 
government in the form of transfer payments (TR). Recall that transfer payments in-
clude Social Security payments and unemployment insurance payments. We can write 
an expression for private saving (SPrivate):
SPrivate = Y + TR - C - T.
The government also engages in saving. Public saving (SPublic) equals the amount of 
tax revenue the government retains after paying for government purchases and making 
transfer payments to households:
SPublic = T - G - TR.
So, total saving in the economy (S) is equal to the sum of private saving and public 
saving:
S = SPrivate + SPublic,
or:
S = (Y + TR - C - T) + (T - G - TR),
or:
S = Y - C - G.

 
Saving, Investment, and the Financial System  
689
The right side of this expression is identical to the expression we derived earlier for in-
vestment spending. So, we can conclude that total saving must equal total investment:
S = I.
When the government spends the same amount that it collects in taxes, there is a 
balanced budget. When the government spends more than it collects in taxes, there is 
a budget deficit. In the case of a deficit, T is less than G +TR, which means that public 
saving is negative. Negative saving is also known as dissaving. How can public saving be 
negative? When the federal government runs a budget deficit, the U.S. Department of 
the Treasury sells Treasury bonds to borrow the money necessary to fund the gap be-
tween taxes and spending. In this case, rather than adding to the total amount of saving 
available to be borrowed for investment spending, the government is subtracting from 
it. (Notice that if households borrow more than they save, the total amount of saving 
will also fall.) With less saving, investment must also be lower. We can conclude that, 
holding constant all other factors, there is a lower level of investment spending in the 
economy when there is a budget deficit than when there is a balanced budget.
When the government spends less than it collects in taxes, there is a budget surplus. 
A budget surplus increases public saving and the total level of saving in the economy. A 
higher level of saving results in a higher level of investment spending. Therefore, hold-
ing constant all other factors, there is a higher level of investment spending in the econ-
omy when there is a budget surplus than when there is a balanced budget.
The U.S. federal government has experienced dramatic swings in the state of its 
budget over the past 20 years. In 1992, the federal budget deficit was $297.4 billion. The 
federal budget had a surplus of $189.5 billion in 2000, but a dramatic decline in taxes 
and increase in government spending resulting from the recession of 2007–2009 led to 
record deficits of $1.4 trillion in 2009 and $1.5 trillion in 2010.
The Market for Loanable Funds
We have seen that the value of total saving must equal the value of total investment, 
but we have not yet discussed how this equality is actually brought about in the finan-
cial system. We can think of the financial system as being composed of many markets 
through which funds flow from lenders to borrowers: the market for certificates of de-
posit at banks, the market for stocks, the market for bonds, the market for mutual fund 
shares, and so on. For simplicity, we can combine these markets into a single market 
for loanable funds. In the model of the market for loanable funds, the interaction of 
borrowers and lenders determines the market interest rate and the quantity of loanable 
funds exchanged. As we will discuss in Chapter 29, firms can also borrow from sav-
ers in other countries. For the remainder of this chapter, we will assume that there are 
no interactions between households and firms in the United States and those in other 
countries.
Demand and Supply in the Loanable Funds Market The demand for loan-
able funds is determined by the willingness of firms to borrow money to engage in new 
investment projects, such as building new factories or carrying out research and devel-
opment of new products. In determining whether to borrow funds, firms compare the 
return they expect to make on an investment with the interest rate they must pay to bor-
row the necessary funds. For example, if Home Depot is considering opening several new 
stores and expects to earn a return of 15 percent on its investment, the investment will be 
profitable if Home Depot can borrow the funds at an interest rate of 10 percent but will 
not be profitable if the interest rate is 20 percent. In Figure 21.3, the demand for loanable 
funds is downward sloping because the lower the interest rate, the more investment proj-
ects firms can profitably undertake, and the greater the quantity of loanable funds they 
will demand.
The supply of loanable funds is determined by the willingness of households to save 
and by the extent of government saving or dissaving. When households save, they reduce 
the amount of goods and services they can consume and enjoy today. The willingness

of households to save rather than consume their incomes today will be determined in 
part by the interest rate they receive when they lend their savings. The higher the inter-
est rate, the greater the reward for saving and the larger the amount of funds households 
will save. Therefore, the supply curve for loanable funds in Figure 21.3 is upward slop-
ing because the higher the interest rate, the greater the quantity of saving supplied.
In Chapter 20, we discussed the distinction between the nominal interest rate and 
the real interest rate. The nominal interest rate is the stated interest rate on a loan. The 
real interest rate corrects the nominal interest rate for the effect of inflation and is equal 
to the nominal interest rate minus the inflation rate. Because both borrowers and lend-
ers are interested in the real interest rate they will receive or pay, equilibrium in the 
market for loanable funds determines the real interest rate rather than the nominal 
interest rate.

The Market for Loanable Funds
The demand for loanable funds is deter-
mined by the willingness of firms to borrow 
money to engage in new investment proj-
ects. The supply of loanable funds is deter-
mined by the willingness of households to 
save and by the extent of government saving 
or dissaving. Equilibrium in the market for 
loanable funds determines the real inter-
est rate and the quantity of loanable funds 
exchanged.

Ebenezer Scrooge: Accidental 
Promoter of Economic Growth?
Ebenezer Scrooge’s name has become synonymous with mi-
serliness. Before his reform at the end of Charles Dickens’s 
A Christmas Carol, Scrooge is extraordinarily reluctant to spend money. Although he 
earns a substantial income, he lives in a cold, dark house that he refuses to heat or light 
adequately, and he eats a meager diet of gruel because he refuses to buy more expensive 
food. Throughout most of the book, Dickens portrays Scrooge’s behavior in an unfa-
vorable way. Only at the end of the book, when the reformed Scrooge begins to spend 
 lavishly on himself and others, does Dickens praise his behavior.
As economist Steven Landsburg of the University of Rochester points out, however, 
economically speaking, it may be the pre-reform Scrooge who is more worthy of praise:
In this whole world, there is nobody more generous than the miser—the man 
who could deplete the world’s resources but chooses not to. The only difference 
between miserliness and philanthropy is that the philanthropist serves a favored 
few while the miser spreads his largess far and wide.
We can extend Landsburg’s discussion to consider whether the actions of the pre- reform 
Scrooge or the actions of the post-reform Scrooge are more helpful to economic growth. 
Pre-reform Scrooge spends very little, investing most of his income in the financial 
markets. These funds became available for firms to borrow to build new factories and 
to carry out research and development. Post-reform Scrooge spends much more—and 
saves much less. Funds that he had previously saved are now spent on food for Bob 
Cratchit’s family and on “making merry” at Christmas. In other words, the actions of

Explaining Movements in Saving, Investment, and Interest Rates  
Equilibrium in the market for loanable funds determines the quantity of loanable 
funds that will flow from lenders to borrowers each period. It also determines the 
real interest rate that lenders will receive and that borrowers must pay. We draw  
the demand curve for loanable funds by holding constant all factors, other than the 
interest rate, that affect the willingness of borrowers to demand funds. We draw the 
supply curve by holding constant all factors, other than the interest rate, that affect 
the willingness of lenders to supply funds. A shift in either the demand curve or the 
supply curve will change the equilibrium interest rate and the equilibrium quantity 
of loanable funds.
If, for example, the profitability of new investment increases due to technological 
change, firms will increase their demand for loanable funds. Figure 21.4 shows the effect 
of an increase in demand in the market for loanable funds. As in the markets for goods 
and services we studied in Chapter 3, an increase in demand in the market for loanable 
funds shifts the demand curve to the right. In the new equilibrium, the interest rate in-
creases from i1 to i2, and the equilibrium quantity of loanable funds increases from L1 to 
L2. Notice that an increase in the quantity of loanable funds means that both the quan-
tity of saving by households and the quantity of investment by firms have increased. 
post-reform Scrooge contribute to more consumption goods being produced and fewer 
investment goods. We can conclude that Scrooge’s reform caused economic growth to 
slow down—if only by a little. The larger point is, of course, that savers provide the 
funds that are indispensable for the investment spending that economic growth re-
quires, and the only way to save is to not consume.

C H A P T E R  2 1  Economic Growth, the Financial System, and Business Cycles
Increasing investment increases the capital stock and the quantity of capital per hour 
worked, helping to increase economic growth.
We can also use the market for loanable funds to examine the effect of a govern-
ment budget deficit. Putting aside the effects of foreign saving—which we will consider 
in Chapter 29—recall that if the government begins running a budget deficit, it reduces 
the total amount of saving in the economy. Suppose the government increases spend-
ing, which results in a budget deficit. We illustrate the effects of the budget deficit in 
Figure 21.5 by shifting the supply of loanable funds to the left. In the new equilibrium, 
the interest rate is higher, and the equilibrium quantity of loanable funds is lower. Run-
ning a deficit has reduced the level of total saving in the economy and, by increasing 
the interest rate, has also reduced the level of investment spending by firms. By borrow-
ing to finance its budget deficit, the government will have crowded out some firms that 
would otherwise have been able to borrow to finance investment. Crowding out refers 
to a decline in investment spending as a result of an increase in government purchases. 
In Figure 21.5, the decline in investment spending due to crowding out is shown by the 
movement from L1 to L2 on the demand for loanable funds curve. Lower investment 
spending means that the capital stock and the quantity of capital per hour worked will 
not increase as much.
A government budget surplus has the opposite effect of a deficit: A budget surplus 
increases the total amount of saving in the economy, shifting the supply of loanable 
funds to the right. In the new equilibrium, the interest rate will be lower, and the quan-
tity of loanable funds will be higher. We can conclude that a budget surplus increases 
the level of saving and investment.
In practice, however, the effect of government budget deficits and surpluses on the 
equilibrium interest rate is relatively small. (This finding reflects in part the importance 
of global saving in determining the interest rate.) For example, a recent study found that 
increasing government borrowing by an amount equal to 1 percent of GDP would in-
crease the equilibrium real interest rate by only about 0.003 percentage point. However, 
this small effect on interest rates does not imply that we can ignore the effect of defi-
cits on economic growth. Paying off government debt in the future may require higher 
taxes, which can depress economic growth. In 2011, many economists and policymak-
ers were concerned that the large deficits projected for future years might be an obstacle 
to growth.

Solving the Problem
Step 1: Review the chapter material. This problem is about applying the market for 
loanable funds model, so you may want to review the section “Explaining Move-
ments in Saving, Investment, and Interest Rates,” which begins on page 691.
Step 2: Explain the effect of switching from an income tax to a consumption tax. 
Households are interested in the return they receive from saving after they have 
paid their taxes. For example, consider someone who puts his savings in a certificate 
of deposit at an interest rate of 4 percent and whose tax rate is 25 percent. Under an 
income tax, this person’s after-tax return to saving is 3 percent[4 - (4 * 0.25)]. 
Under a consumption tax, income that is saved is not taxed, so the return rises to 
4 percent. We can conclude that moving from an income tax to a consumption 
tax would increase the return to saving, causing the supply of loanable funds to 
increase.
Step 3: Draw a graph of the market for loanable funds to illustrate your answer. The 
supply curve for loanable funds will shift to the right as the after-tax return to 
saving increases under the consumption tax. The equilibrium interest rate will 
fall, and the levels of saving and investment will both increase. Because invest-
ment increases, the capital stock and the quantity of capital per hour worked 
will grow, and the rate of economic growth should increase. Note that the size 
of the fall in the interest rate and size of the increase in loanable funds shown in 
the graph are larger than the effects that most economists expect would actu-
ally result from the replacement of the income tax with a consumption tax.

Solved Problem 21.2
How Would a Consumption Tax Affect Saving, Investment,  
the Interest Rate, and Economic Growth?
Some economists and policymakers have suggested that the 
federal government shift from relying on an income tax to 
relying on a consumption tax. Under the income tax, house-
holds pay taxes on all income earned. Under a consumption 
tax, households pay taxes only on the income they spend. 
Households would pay taxes on saved income only if they 
spent the money at a later time. Use the market for loanable 
funds model to analyze the effect on saving, investment, the 
interest rate, and economic growth of switching from an 
 income tax to a consumption tax.

C H A P T E R  2 1  Economic Growth, the Financial System, and Business Cycles
The Business Cycle
Figure 21.1 on page 679 illustrates the tremendous increase during the past 110 years in 
the standard of living of the average American. But close inspection of the figure reveals 
that real GDP per capita did not increase every year during this time. For example, dur-
ing the first half of the 1930s, real GDP per capita fell for several years in a row. What 
accounts for these fluctuations in the long-run upward trend?
Some Basic Business Cycle Definitions
The fluctuations in real GDP per capita shown in Figure 21.1 reflect the underlying fluc-
tuations in real GDP. Since at least the early nineteenth century, the U.S. economy has 
experienced business cycles that consist of alternating periods of expanding and con-
tracting economic activity. Because real GDP is our best measure of economic activity, 
the business cycle is usually illustrated using movements in real GDP.
During the expansion phase of the business cycle, production, employment, 
and  income are increasing. The period of expansion ends with a business cycle peak. 
 Following the business cycle peak, production, employment, and income decline as the 
economy enters the recession phase of the cycle. The recession comes to an end with 
a business cycle trough, after which another period of expansion begins. Figure 21.6 
 illustrates the phases of the business cycle. Panel (a) shows an idealized business cycle, 
with real GDP increasing smoothly in an expansion to a business cycle peak and then 
decreasing smoothly in a recession to a business cycle trough, which is followed by an-
other expansion. Panel (b) shows the somewhat messier reality of an actual business 
cycle by plotting fluctuations in real GDP during the period from 2005 to 2011. The 
figure shows that the expansion that began in 2001 continued until a business cycle peak 
was reached in December 2007. The following recession was the longest and the most 
severe since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The severity of the recession led some 
economists to refer to it as the “Great Recession.” A business cycle trough was reached in 
June 2009, when the next expansion began. Although real GDP grew following the busi-
ness cycle trough, the growth was slower than is typical at the beginning of a business 
cycle expansion.

How Do We Know When the Economy 
Is in a Recession?
The federal government produces many statistics that make it possible to monitor the 
economy. But the federal government does not officially decide when a recession begins 
or when it ends. Instead, most economists accept the decisions of the Business Cycle 
Dating Committee of the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), a private re-
search group located in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Although writers for newspapers 
and magazines often define a recession as two consecutive quarters of declining real 
GDP, the NBER has a broader definition: “A recession is a significant decline in activity 
spread across the economy, lasting more than a few months, visible in industrial pro-
duction, employment, real income, and wholesale–retail trade.”
The NBER is fairly slow in announcing business cycle dates because it takes time to 
gather and analyze economic statistics. Typically, the NBER will announce that the econ-
omy is in a recession only well after the recession has begun. For instance, the NBER did 
not announce that a recession had begun in December 2007 until 11 months later, at the 
end of November 2008. Table 21.1 lists the business cycle peaks and troughs identified 
by the NBER for the years since 1950. The length of each recession is the number of 
months from each peak to the following trough.

Can a Recession Be a Good Time  
for a Business to Expand?
During a recession, business managers have to quickly make 
many decisions, such as whether to reduce production, cut 
prices, close stores or other facilities, or lay off workers. In addition to making decisions 
aimed at dealing with the immediate effects of the recession, managers also have to con-
sider how to prepare for the expansion that will follow the recession. Managers know 
that every recession, even one as severe as the recession of 2007–2009, will be followed 
by an expansion during which demand for their products is likely to increase. But it can 
be difficult to commit resources to future expansion when current conditions are bleak 
and when the end of the recession is difficult to predict.
The payoff, though, to preparing for future growth can be very large. For example, 
at the end of World War II in 1945, many economists and business managers expected 
that the U.S. economy would enter a severe recession. Sears and Montgomery Ward 
were the two largest department store chains in the country. Sears CEO Robert Wood, 
expecting continuing prosperity, moved to open new stores across the country, while 
Sewell Avery, CEO of Montgomery Ward, expecting falling incomes and rising unem-
ployment, refused to authorize any new stores and closed a number of existing ones. As 
a result, when strong economic growth occurred during the late 1940s, Sears rapidly 
gained market share at Montgomery Ward’s expense.

What Happens during the Business Cycle?
Each business cycle is different. The lengths of the expansion and recession phases and 
which sectors of the economy are most affected are rarely the same in any two cycles. 
But most business cycles share certain characteristics, which we will discuss in this sec-
tion. As the economy nears the end of an expansion, interest rates are usually rising, and 
the wages of workers are usually rising faster than prices. As a result of rising interest 
rates and rising wages, the profits of firms will be falling. Typically, toward the end of 
an expansion, both households and firms will have substantially increased their debts. 
These debts are the result of the borrowing that firms and households undertake to help 
finance their spending during the expansion.
A recession will often begin with a decline in spending by firms on capital goods, 
such as machinery, equipment, new factories, and new office buildings, or by house-
holds on new houses and consumer durables, such as furniture and automobiles. As 
spending declines, firms selling capital goods and consumer durables will find their 
Following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the manag-
ers of many hotels expected a prolonged period of reduced travel. 
They responded by laying off workers and postponing or canceling 
new construction. Isadore Sharp, the chairman and CEO of Four 
Seasons Hotels, decided that although the recession would severely 
hurt the hotel industry, the effects would be short-lived. He decided 
to push ahead with construction of 18 hotels and begin construc-
tion of 10 more. By his own account, “We maintained or enhanced 
our market share in most regions, contrary to the predictions of 
various industry experts.” In a letter to his shareholders in March 
2002, he wrote: “We are well positioned for the economic recovery 
expected later this year.”
During the severe recession of 2007–2009, managers had sim-
ilar decisions to make. Based in Greensboro, North Carolina, VF 
Corporation is the largest apparel maker in the world. While many 
firms, such as J.Crew, Anne Klein, and Liz Claiborne, were closing stores or postponing 
opening new ones, VF CEO Eric Wiseman pushed ahead, opening 89 stores in 2008 
and 70 in 2009. One retail analyst was quoted as saying: “Unfortunately, many compa-
nies pull in the reins in a downturn, but these are often the best opportunities to grow.” 
Similarly, Intel, the computer chip manufacturer, decided in early 2009 to proceed with 
a $7 billion expansion of its factories in the United States, while many rival firms were 
reducing their spending on new factories as computer sales declined. Intel’s CEO Paul 
Otellini was quoted as saying, “I thought it was important for a company like Intel to 
stand up and say we have confidence.” Heavy equipment manufacturer Caterpillar, Inc., 
announced that it would build several new facilities and expand some existing ones in 
order “to meet the expected increase in customer demand.”
Through 2011, the recovery from the 2007–2009 recession was much slower than 
the typical recovery, which led some economists and analysts to wonder whether con-
tinued slow growth might make the decision by some businesses to expand less prof-
itable than expected. So, how the decisions by VF, Intel, and Caterpillar will turn out 
remains to be seen, but, over the long run, for many firms, betting on the future of the 
U.S. economy has paid off.

sales declining. As sales decline, firms cut back on production and begin to lay off work-
ers. Rising unemployment and falling profits reduce income, which leads to further de-
clines in spending.
As the recession continues, economic conditions gradually begin to improve. The 
declines in spending eventually come to an end; households and firms begin to reduce 
their debt, thereby increasing their ability to spend; and interest rates decline, making it 
more likely that households and firms will borrow to finance new spending. Firms be-
gin to increase their spending on capital goods as they anticipate the need for additional 
production during the next expansion. Increased spending by households on consumer 
durables and by businesses on capital goods will finally bring the recession to an end 
and begin the next expansion.
The Effect of the Business Cycle on Boeing Durables are goods that are ex-
pected to last for three or more years. Consumer durables include furniture, appliances, 
and automobiles, and producer durables include machine tools, electric generators, and 
commercial airplanes. Nondurables are goods that are expected to last for fewer than 
three years. Consumer nondurables include goods such as food and clothing. Durables 
are affected more by the business cycle than are nondurables. During a recession, work-
ers reduce spending if they lose their jobs, fear losing their jobs, or suffer wage cuts. 
Because people can often continue using their existing furniture, appliances, or automo-
biles, they are more likely to postpone spending on durables than spending on nondu-
rables. Similarly, when firms experience declining sales and profits during a recession, 
they often cut back on purchases of producer durables.
We mentioned in our discussion of Boeing at the beginning of this chapter that the 
firm’s sales are significantly affected by the business cycle. Panel (a) of Figure 21.7 shows

the recessions on Boeing are typically more dramatic and long-lived than the effects on 
the economy as a whole, although Boeing suffered a relatively mild decline in deliver-
ies during the 2007–2009 recession as increased demand from foreign airlines helped 
to offset declines in demand from U.S. airlines. In each of the recessions shown, U.S. 
airlines suffered declines in ticket sales and cut back on purchases of aircraft. As a result, 
Boeing suffered declines in sales during each recession.
The Effect of the Business Cycle on the Inflation Rate In Chapter 20, we saw 
that the price level measures the average prices of goods and services in the economy 
and that the inflation rate is the percentage increase in the price level from one year to 
the next. An important fact about the business cycle is that during economic expan-
sions, the inflation rate usually increases, particularly near the end of the expansion, and 
during recessions, the inflation rate usually decreases. Figure 21.8 illustrates that this 
has been true of the three recessions since the late 1980s.
In every recession since 1950, the inflation rate has been lower during the 
12 months after the recession ends than it was during the 12 months before the reces-
sion began. The average decline in the inflation rate has been about 2.5 percentage 
points. This result is not surprising. During a business cycle expansion, spending by 
businesses and households is strong, and producers of goods and services find it easier 
to raise prices. As spending declines during a recession, firms have a more difficult

rate”? This statement may sound plausible, but it is incor-
rect. As we saw in Chapter 20, the consumer price index 
is a measure of the price level, not of the inflation rate. We 
can measure the inflation rate as the percentage change in 
the consumer price index from one year to the next. In 
macroeconomics, it is important not to confuse the level of 
a variable with the change in the variable. To give another 
example, real GDP does not measure economic growth. 
Economic growth is measured by the percentage change in 
real GDP from one year to the next.

The unemployment 
rate typically continues 
to rise, even after a 
recession has ended.
Unemployment rises during recessions and falls during expansions. The reluctance of firms to hire new employees during the early stages of a recovery means that the 
unemployment rate usually continues to rise even after the recession has ended.
Data from U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

shows that this has been true of the three recessions since the late 1980s. Notice in the fig-
ure that the unemployment rate continued to rise even after the recessions of 1990–1991, 
2001, and 2007–2009 had ended. This pattern, which is typical, is due to two factors. First, 
even though employment begins to increase as the recession ends, it may be increasing 
more slowly than the growth in the labor force resulting from population growth. If em-
ployment grows slowly enough relative to the growth in the labor force, it is possible for 
the unemployment rate to increase. Second, some firms continue to operate well below 
their capacity even after a recession has ended and production has begun to increase. As 
a result, at first, firms may not hire back all the workers they have laid off and may even 
continue for a while to lay off more workers.
During the recessions since 1950, the unemployment rate has risen on average by 
about 1.2 percentage points during the 12 months after a recession has begun. So, on av-
erage, more than 1 million more workers have been unemployed during the 12 months 
after a recession has begun than during the previous 12 months.
Is the “Great Moderation” Over? Figure 21.10, which shows the year-to-year 
percentage changes in real GDP since 1900, illustrates a striking change in fluctua-
tions in real GDP beginning around 1950. Before 1950, real GDP went through much 
greater year-to-year fluctuations than it has since that time. Fluctuations since the 
mid-1980s have been particularly mild. By the early twenty-first century, some econo-
mists had begun referring to the absence of severe recessions in the United States as 
the “Great Moderation.” However, economists began questioning this view with the re-
cession that began in December 2007. This recession was the longest and most severe 
since the Great Depression of the 1930s and was referred to as the Great Contraction.

The Business Cycle 
701
The percentage decline in real GDP during 2009 was the largest since 1932. Econ-
omists and policymakers were unsure whether the Great Moderation would return 
with the end of the Great Contraction.
The unusual severity of the 2007–2009 recession can be seen by comparing its 
length to the lengths of other recent recessions. Table 21.2 shows that in the late nine-
teenth century, the average length of recessions was the same as the average length 
of expansions. During the first half of the twentieth century, the average length of 
expansions decreased slightly, and the average length of recessions decreased signifi-
cantly. As a result, expansions were about six months longer than recessions during 
these years. The most striking change came after 1950, when the length of expansions 
greatly increased and the length of recessions decreased. After 1950, expansions were 
more than five times as long as recessions. In other words, in the late nineteenth cen-
tury, the U.S. economy spent as much time in recession as it did in expansion. After 
1950, the U.S. economy experienced long expansions interrupted by relatively short 
recessions.
The recession of 2007–2009 is an exception to this experience of relatively short, 
mild recessions. The recession lasted 18 months, the longest of the post-1950 period. 
Does the length and depth of the 2007–2009 recession indicate that the United States 
is returning to an era of severe fluctuations in real GDP? A full answer to this question 
will not be possible for at least several years. But in the next section, we provide some 
perspective on the question by considering why the period from 1950 to 2007 was one 
of relative macroeconomic stability.
Will the U.S. Economy Return to Stability?
Shorter recessions, longer expansions, and less severe fluctuations in real GDP have re-
sulted in a significant improvement in the economic well-being of Americans. Econo-
mists have offered several explanations for why the U.S. economy experienced a period 
of relative stability from 1950 to 2007:
• 
The increasing importance of services and the declining importance of goods. As 
services such as medical care or investment advice have become a much larger frac-
tion of GDP, there has been a corresponding relative decline in the production of 
goods. For example, at one time, manufacturing production accounted for about 
40 percent of GDP, but in 2010, it accounted for less than 12 percent. Manufac-
turing production, particularly production of durable goods such as automobiles, 
fluctuates more than the production of services. Because durable goods are usually 
more expensive than services, during a recession households will cut back more on 
purchases of durables than they will on purchases of services.
• 
The establishment of unemployment insurance and other government transfer 
programs that provide funds to the unemployed. Before the 1930s, programs such 
as unemployment insurance, which provides government payments to workers who 
lose their jobs, and Social Security, which provides government payments to retired 
and disabled workers, did not exist. These and other government programs make it

possible for workers who lose their jobs during recessions to have higher incomes 
and, therefore, to spend more than they would otherwise. This additional spending 
may have helped to shorten recessions.
• 
Active federal government policies to stabilize the economy. Before the Great 
Depression of the 1930s, the federal government did not attempt to end reces-
sions or prolong expansions. Because the Great Depression was so severe, with 
the unemployment rate rising to more than 20 percent of the labor force and 
real GDP declining by almost 30 percent, public opinion began favoring gov-
ernment attempts to stabilize the economy. In the years since World War II, 
the federal government has actively tried to use macroeconomic policy mea-
sures to end recessions and prolong expansions. Many economists believe that 
these government policies have played a key role in stabilizing the economy. 
Other economists, however, argue that active government policy has had little 
effect. The debate over the role of macroeconomic policy became particularly 
intense during and after the 2007–2009 recession. We will consider the debate 
over macroeconomic policy further in Chapters 26 and 27, when we discuss the 
federal government’s monetary and fiscal policies.
• 
The increased stability of the financial system. The severity of the Great Depres-
sion of the 1930s was caused in part by instability in the financial system. More than 
5,000 banks failed between 1929 and 1933, reducing the savings of many house-
holds and making it difficult for households and firms to obtain the credit needed 
to maintain their spending. In addition, a decline of more than 80 percent in stock 
prices greatly reduced the wealth of many households and made it difficult for firms 
to raise funds by selling stock. In Chapters 25 and 26, we will discuss some of the 
institutional changes that resulted in increased stability in the financial system dur-
ing the years after the Great Depression. Most economists believe that the return of 
financial instability during the 2007–2009 recession is a key reason the recession 
was so severe. If the United States is to return to macroeconomic stability, stability 
will first have to return to the financial system.

Economics in Your Life
Do You Help the Economy More if You Spend or if You Save?
At the beginning of the chapter, we posed a question: Which of your two roommates is right: 
The one who argues that you would help the economy more by saving your tax refund check, 
or the one who argues that you should spend it? In this chapter, we have seen that consumption 
spending promotes the production of more consumption goods and services—such as jeans and 
 haircuts—and fewer investment goods and services—such as physical capital and worker educa-
tion.  Saving—and, therefore, not consuming—is necessary to fund investment expenditure. So, 
saving your refund check will help the economy over the long run. But if the economy is in a 
 recession, spending your refund check will spur more production of consumption goods. In a sense, 
then, both of your roommates are correct: Spending your check will help stimulate the economy 
during a recession, while saving it will help the economy grow over the long run.

Conclusion
The U.S. economy remains a remarkable engine for improving the well-being of Ameri-
cans. The standard of living of Americans today is much higher than it was 100 years 
ago. But households and firms are still subject to the ups and downs of the business 
cycle. In the following chapters, we will continue our analysis of this basic fact of macro-
economics: Ever-increasing long-run prosperity is achieved in the context of short-run 
instability.

Meanwhile, IATA expects Afri-
can carriers to break even, compared 
to previous loss forecast.
 Tony Tyler, IATA’s Director 
 General and CEO, stated that the air-
lines are competing in a very tough 
environment and that 2012 will be 
even more difficult.
For 2012, IATA projects profits 
to fall to $4.9 billion on revenues of 
$632 billion for a net margin of just 
0.8  percent. Passenger markets are ex-
pected to grow 4.6 percent, and cargo 
markets by 4.2 percent.
IATA said the fourth quar-
ter of 2011 and the first half of 2012 
may well see the weakest point for 
air transport markets, with debt- 
burdened Western economies set for 
an extended period of weak economic 
activity.
Tyler stated, “Relatively stronger 
economic growth and some rebound 
in cargo will help Asia Pacific airlines 
to maintain their 2012 profits close to 
2011 levels at $2.3 billion. The rest of 
the industry will see declining profit-
ability. And the worst hit is expected 
to be Europe where the economic 
crisis means the industry is only ex-
pected to return a combined profit of 
$300 million. A long slow struggle lies 
ahead.”

Expects Fall In 2012,” RTTNews, September 20,

 For the year 2011, passenger 
numbers are expected to grow 5.9 
percent, compared to a previous fore-
cast of 4.4 percent growth, reflecting 
stronger than anticipated demand, 
despite the gloomy economic outlook. 
Total passenger numbers would now 
be 2.833 billion, up from the previous 
forecast of 2.793 billion.
Tighter supply and demand con-
ditions in passenger markets over the 
first half is expected to offset the im-
pact of a weaker second half.
Meanwhile, IATA slashed its fore-
cast for air freight’s full-year volume 
growth to 1.4 percent from 5.5 per-
cent. Airlines are expected to carry 
46.4 million tonnes of cargo in 2011, 
down from the previous forecast of 
48.2 million. The agency does not ex-
pect a revival in air freight before 2012.
For the year, passenger revenues 
are now projected to be $464 billion, 
$7 billion higher than the June fore-
cast, while freight revenue projections 
fell by $5 billion to $67 billion reflect-
ing weaker freight markets.
IATA said its forecast is built 
around global projected GDP growth 
of 2.5 percent in 2011 falling to 2.4 
percent in 2012.
IATA also lifted profit forecast for 
all regions, despite the ongoing im-
pacts of the Japanese earthquake and 
tsunami in Asia and potential demand 
shocks associated with political insta-
bility in Middle East.
IATA Lifts 2011 
Airline Profit 
Forecast; Expects 
Fall in 2012
The International Air Transport Asso-
ciation or IATA on Tuesday lifted its 
airline industry profit forecast for fis-
cal 2011, citing better than expected 
passenger demand in most regions, 
even though cargo markets were 
weak. Meanwhile, it expects lower 
profit for the year 2012, with a very 
tough environment going ahead.
 For the year 2011, IATA cur-
rently expects industry profit to be 
$6.9 billion, compared to a previous 
projection of $4 billion. Meanwhile, 
the agency emphasized that prof-
itability, with a net margin rate of 
1.2 percent, is still exceptionally weak, 
despite the improvements, consider-
ing the industry’s total revenues of 
$594 billion.
In an early June announcement, 
IATA, which represents around 230 
airlines in over 115 countries, had 
slashed its profit outlook for the year 
from an earlier projection of $8.6 bil-
lion, citing high oil prices, natural 
disasters in Japan, and the political 
unrest in the Middle East and North 
Africa. The latest forecast is signifi-
cantly lower than the $18 billion net 
profit recorded in 2010.

decrease in the equilibrium quantity. The 
graph below illustrates this point: The de-
mand curve shifts to the right from D1 to D2, 
showing the increase in market demand for 
air travel, and the supply curve shifts to the 
left from S1 to S2, showing the decrease in 
market supply of air travel as airlines cut 
back on the number of flights they offered. 
Both the increase in demand and the de-
crease in supply cause the equilibrium price 
to increase. The increase in demand causes 
the equilibrium quantity to increase and the 
decrease in supply causes the equilibrium 
quantity to decrease. In the graph, the equi-
librium quantity is shown to have remained 
constant at Q1, because of shifts of equal 
magnitude of supply and demand.
c The IATA industry outlook for 2012 is not 
encouraging. Airline profits are projected 
to fall to $4.9 billion, with the profit margin 
decreasing to 0.8 percent. At the same time, 
revenues are projected to increase to $632 
billion, with passenger travel up 4.6 percent 
and freight up 4.2 percent. The airline indus-
try is expected to suffer a decline in profits 
despite an increase in passengers and 
freight and a rise in total revenue.
Thinking Critically
1. Suppose the U.S. government regulated 
U.S. airline ticket prices. How might 
such a policy affect the profitability of 
U.S. airlines during a weak economy?
2. Suppose the U.S. government decides 
to provide U.S. airlines with low-interest 
loans, regardless of their creditworthi-
ness, in an attempt to help the airlines 
increase their profits. Would such a pol-
icy be likely to succeed? Briefly explain.
However, the rebound was short-lived. An 
airline industry trade association, IATA, has 
twice lowered its forecast of profit for the in-
dustry for 2011. IATA reduced its original es-
timate of $8.6 billion to $4 billion in June and 
then increased that estimate to $6.9 billion in 
September. These 2011 profit estimates are 
considerably less than the $18 billion profit 
the industry earned in 2010. As IATA noted, 
the profit margin of 1.2 percent is very weak 
for an industry with total revenue of $594 
billion.
b Despite the expected decline in profits 
from 2010 and a cautious economic 
outlook, passenger numbers are expected 
to increase in 2011 by 5.8 percent from the 
previous year, to a total of 2.833 billion. Dur-
ing the recession of 2007–2009, airlines de-
creased ticket prices and cut back on flights 
in response to decreasing demand. While 
the number of flights has remained lower 
than prior to the recession, ticket prices be-
gan to rise in 2010 as passenger demand 
increased. As we saw in Chapter 3, an 
 increase in market demand causes an in-
crease in the equilibrium market price and 
an increase in the equilibrium quantity, while 
a decrease in market supply causes an in-
crease in the equilibrium price and a 
Key Points in the Article
An airline industry trade association, the In-
ternational Air Transport Association (IATA), 
revised its profit forecast for the industry for 
2011 to $6.9 billion in September, up from 
$4 billion in June. Profit forecasts were in-
creased for all regions of the globe. The 
higher profits, which are still less than the 
$18 billion profit recorded in 2010, would 
mainly be the result of increased demand 
for passenger travel, with passenger num-
bers projected to increase by 5.9 percent 
for the year. Freight volume, however, is 
expected to grow only 1.4 percent for the 
year, down from the earlier estimate of 
5.5 percent. For 2012, IATA projects indus-
try profits to decline to $4.9 billion, despite 
expected growth in passengers and freight 
of 4.6 percent and 4.2 percent, respectively. 
IATA’s revised profit forecasts are based on 
projected global GDP growth of 2.5 percent 
in 2011 and 2.4 percent in 2012.
Analyzing the News

Summary
The U.S. economy has experienced both long-run economic growth 
and the business cycle. The business cycle refers to alternating pe-
riods of economic expansion and economic recession. Long-run 
economic growth is the process by which rising productivity in-
creases the standard of living of the typical person. Because of eco-
nomic growth, the typical American today can buy almost eight 
times as much as the typical American of 1900. Long-run growth 
is measured by increases in real GDP per capita. Increases in real 
GDP per capita depend on increases in labor productivity. Labor 
productivity is the quantity of goods and services that can be pro-
duced by one worker or by one hour of work. Economists believe 
two key factors determine labor productivity: the quantity of capital 
per hour worked and the level of technology. Capital refers to man-
ufactured goods that are used to produce other goods and services. 
Human capital is the accumulated knowledge and skills workers ac-
quire from education, training, or their life experiences. Economic 
growth occurs if the quantity of capital per hour worked increases 
and if technological change occurs. Economists often discuss eco-
nomic growth in terms of growth in potential GDP, which is the 
level of GDP attained when all firms are producing at capacity.

Summary
Financial markets and financial intermediaries together comprise 
the financial system. A well-functioning financial system is an 
important determinant of economic growth. Firms acquire funds 
from households, either directly through financial markets—such 
as the stock and bond markets—or indirectly through financial in-
termediaries—such as banks. The funds available to firms come 
from saving. There are two categories of saving in the economy: 
private saving by households and public saving by the government. 
The value of total saving in the economy is always equal to the 
value of total investment spending. In the model of the market for 
loanable funds, the interaction of borrowers and lenders deter-
mines the market interest rate and the quantity of loanable funds 
exchanged.

received and only pay taxes on the resulting real interest 
rate.) Use a market for loanable funds graph to analyze the 
effects of this change in tax policy. What happens to the

of loanable funds? What happens to the quantity of saving 
and investment?

The Making the Connection claims that Ebenezer Scrooge 
promoted economic growth more when he was a miser 
and saved most of his income than when he reformed and 
began spending freely. Suppose, though, that most of his 
spending after he reformed involved buying food for the 
Cratchits and other poor families. Many economists be-
lieve that there is a close connection between how much 
very poor people eat and how much they are able to work 
and how productive they are while working. Does this fact 
affect the conclusion about whether the pre-reform or 
post-reform Scrooge had a more positive impact on eco-
nomic growth? Briefly explain.

Summary
During the expansion phase of the business cycle, production, 
employment, and income are increasing. The period of expansion 
ends with a business cycle peak. Following the business cycle peak, 
production, employment, and income decline during the reces-
sion phase of the cycle. The recession comes to an end with a busi-
ness cycle trough, after which another period of expansion begins. 
The inflation rate usually rises near the end of a business cycle 
expansion and then falls during a recession. The unemployment

rate declines during the later part of an expansion and increases 
during a recession. The unemployment rate often continues to in-
crease even after an expansion has begun. Economists have not 
found a method to predict when recessions will begin and end. 
Recessions are difficult to predict because they are due to more 
than one cause. Until the severe recession of 2007–2009, reces-
sions had been milder and the economy had been more stable in 
the period since 1950.

Economics in Your Life
Would You Be Better Off without China?
Suppose that you could choose to live and work in a world with the Chinese economy growing 
very rapidly or in a world with the Chinese economy as it was before 1978—very poor and growing 
slowly. Which world would you choose to live in? How does the current high-growth, high-export 
Chinese economy affect you as a consumer? How does it affect you as someone about to start a 
career? As you read the chapter, see if you can answer these questions. You can check your answers 
against those we provide on page 738 at the end of this chapter.
growth. China moved away from a centrally 
planned economy in 1978, and real GDP 
per capita grew at a rate of 6.5 percent per 
year  between 1979 and 1995; it grew at the 
white-hot rate of more than 9 percent per 
year between 1996 and 2010. These rapid 
growth rates have transformed the Chinese 
economy: Real GDP per capita today is  
10 times higher than it was 50 years ago.
But, as the experience of Google has 
shown, China is not a democracy, and the 
Chinese government has failed to fully 
 establish the rule of law, particularly with 
respect to the consistent enforcement 
of property rights. This is a problem for 
the long-term prospects of the Chinese 
economy because without the rule of law, 
 entrepreneurs cannot fulfill their role in 
the market system of bringing together the 
factors of production—labor, capital, and 
natural resources—to produce goods and 
services.

decrease its reliance on investment spend-

Google was founded in 1998 by Larry Page 
and Sergey Brin. By 2011, Google employed 
more than 28,000 people and had annual 
revenues exceeding $29 billion. But Google 
encountered problems when expanding 
into China in 2006. The Chinese govern-
ment insisted on regulating how people in 
that country access the Internet. In setting 
up Google.cn, Google had to agree to block 
searches of sensitive topics, such as the 1989 
pro-democracy demonstrations in Tianan-
men Square.
In late 2009, hackers stole some of 
Google’s most important intellectual prop-
erty by breaking into its computer system. 
Company executives suspected that Chi-
nese government officials were involved in 
the theft. In January 2010, Google  decided 
it would no longer cooperate with the Chi-
nese government to censor Internet search-
ers and moved its Chinese search service 
from the mainland to Hong Kong.
Google’s problems highlight one of 
the paradoxes of China in recent years: 
very rapid economic growth occurring 
in the context of government regulations 
that can stifle that growth. From the time 
the Communist Party seized control of 
China in 1949 until the late 1970s, the gov-
ernment controlled production, and the 
country experienced very little economic

conomic growth is not inevitable. For most of human history, no sustained in-
creases in output per capita occurred, and, in the words of the philosopher 
Thomas Hobbes, the lives of most people were “poor, nasty, brutish, and short.” 
Sustained economic growth first began with the Industrial Revolution in England 
in the late eighteenth century. From there, economic growth spread to the United States, 
Canada, and the countries of Western Europe. Following World War II, rapid economic 
growth also began in Japan and, eventually, in several other Asian countries, but the econo-
mies of many other countries stagnated, leaving their people mired in poverty.
Real GDP per capita is the best measure of a country’s standard of living because it 
represents the ability of the average person to buy goods and services. Economic growth oc-
curs when real GDP per capita increases. Why have countries such as the United States and 
the United Kingdom, which had high standards of living at the beginning of the twentieth 
century, continued to grow rapidly? Why have countries such as Argentina, which at one 
time had relatively high standards of living, failed to keep pace? Why was the Soviet Union 
unable to sustain the rapid growth rates of its early years? Why are some countries that were 
very poor at the beginning of the twentieth century still very poor today? And why have 
some countries, such as South Korea and Japan, that once were very poor now become much 
richer? What explains China’s very rapid recent growth rates? In this chapter, we will develop 
a model of economic growth that helps us answer these important questions.
Economic Growth over Time 
and around the World
You live in a world that is very different from the world when your grandparents were 
young. You can listen to music on an iPod that fits in your pocket; your grandparents 
played vinyl records on large stereo systems. You can pick up a cell phone or send a text 
message to someone in another city, state, or country; your grandparents mailed letters 
that took days or weeks to arrive. More importantly, you have access to health care and 
medicines that have prolonged life and improved its quality. In many poorer countries, 
however, people endure grinding poverty and have only the bare necessities of life, just 
as their great-grandparents did.
The difference between you and people in poor countries is that you live in a coun-
try that has experienced substantial economic growth. With economic growth, an 
economy produces both increasing quantities of goods and services and better goods 
and services. It is only through economic growth that living standards can increase, but 
through most of human history, no economic growth took place. Even today, billions of 
people are living in countries where economic growth is extremely slow.
Economic Growth from 1,000,000 B.C. to the Present
In 1,000,000 b.c., our ancestors survived by hunting animals and gathering edible plants. 
Farming was many years in the future, and production was limited to food, clothing, 
shelter, and simple tools. Bradford DeLong, an economist at the University of California, 
Berkeley, estimates that in those primitive circumstances, GDP per capita was about $140 
per year in 2010 dollars, which was the minimum amount necessary to sustain life.  DeLong 
estimates that real GDP per capita worldwide was still $140 in the year 1300 a.d. In other 
words, no sustained economic growth occurred between 1,000,000 b.c. and 1300 a.d. 
A peasant toiling on a farm in France in the year 1300 was no better off than his ances-
tors thousands of years before. In fact, for most of human existence, the typical person had 
only the bare minimum of food, clothing, and shelter necessary to sustain life. Few people 
 survived beyond age 40, and most people suffered from debilitating illnesses.
Significant economic growth did not begin until the Industrial Revolution, 
which started in England around the year 1750. The production of cotton cloth in

factories using machinery powered by steam engines marked the beginning of the 
Industrial Revolution. Before that time, production of goods had relied almost ex-
clusively on human or animal power. The use of mechanical power spread to the 
production of many other goods, greatly increasing the quantity of goods each 
worker could produce. First England and then other countries, such as the United 
States, France, and Germany, experienced long-run economic growth, with sustained 
increases in real GDP per capita that eventually raised living standards in those 
countries to the high levels of today.
Why Did the Industrial Revolution 
Begin in England?
The Industrial Revolution was a key turning point in human 
history. Before the Industrial Revolution, economic growth 
was slow and halting. After the Industrial Revolution, economic growth became rapid 
and sustained in a number of countries. Although historians and economists agree on 
the importance of the Industrial Revolution, they have not reached a consensus on why 
it happened in the time and place that it did. Why the eighteenth century and not the 
sixteenth century or the twenty-first century? Why England and not China or India or 
Africa or Japan?
There is always a temptation to read history backward. We know when and where 
the Industrial Revolution occurred; therefore, it had to happen where it did and when it 
did. But what was so special about England in the eighteenth century? Nobel Laureate 
Douglass North, of Washington University in St. Louis, has argued that institutions in 
England differed significantly from those in other countries in ways that greatly aided 
economic growth. North believes that the Glorious Revolution of 1688 was a key turn-
ing point. After that date, the British Parliament, rather than the king, controlled the 
government. The British court system also became independent of the king. As a result, 
the British government was credible when it committed to upholding private property 
rights, protecting wealth, and eliminating arbitrary increases in taxes. These insti-
tutional changes gave entrepreneurs the incentive to make the investments necessary 
to use the important technological developments of the second half of the eighteenth 
century—particularly the spinning jenny and the water frame, which were used in the 
production of cotton textiles, and the steam engine, which was used in mining and 
in the manufacture of textiles and other products. Without the institutional changes, 
 entrepreneurs would have been reluctant to risk their property or their wealth by start-
ing new businesses.
Although not all economists agree with North’s specific argument about the origins 
of the Industrial Revolution, we will see that most economists accept the idea that eco-
nomic growth is not likely to occur unless a country’s government provides the type of 
institutional framework North describes.
Based on Douglass C. North, Understanding the Process of Economic Change, (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University 
Press, 2005); and Douglass C. North and Barry R. Weingast, “Constitutions and Commitment: The Evolution of In-
stitutions Governing Public Choice in Seventeenth-Century England,” Journal of Economic History, Vol. 49, No. 4,

Making 
the 
Connection
The British government’s guarantee 
of property rights set the stage for 
the Industrial Revolution.
Figure 22.1 shows how growth rates of real GDP per capita for the entire world have 
changed over long periods. Prior to 1300 a.d., there were no sustained increases in real 
GDP per capita. Over the next 500 years, to 1800, there was very slow growth. Signifi-
cant growth began in the nineteenth century, as a result of the Industrial Revolution. A 
further acceleration in growth occurred during the twentieth century, as the average 
growth rate increased from 1.3 percent per year to 2.3 percent per year.

714 
C H A P T E R  2 2  Long-Run Economic Growth: Sources and Policies
Small Differences in Growth Rates Are Important
The difference between 1.3 percent and 2.3 percent may seem trivial, but over long periods, 
small differences in growth rates can have a large effect. For example, suppose you have 
$100 in a savings account earning an interest rate of 1.3 percent, which means you will re-
ceive an interest payment of $1.30 this year. If the interest rate on the account is 2.3 percent, 
you will earn $2.30. The difference of an extra $1.00 interest payment seems insignificant. 
But if you leave the interest as well as the original $100 in your account for another year, 
the difference becomes greater because now the higher interest rate is applied to a larger 
amount—$102.30—and the lower interest rate is applied to a smaller amount—$101.30. 
This process, known as compounding, magnifies even small differences in interest rates over 
long periods of time. Over a period of 50 years, your $100 would grow to $312 at an interest 
rate of 2.3 percent but to only $191 at an interest rate of 1.3 percent.
The principle of compounding applies to economic growth rates as well as to inter-
est rates. For example, in 1950, real GDP per capita in Argentina was $5,474 (measured in 
2005 dollars), which was larger than Italy’s real GDP per capita of $5,361. Over the next 60 
years, the economic growth rate in Italy averaged 2.8 percent per year, while in Argentina, 
the growth rate was only 1.4 percent per year. Although this difference in growth rates of 
only 1.4 percentage points may seem small, in 2010, real GDP per capita in Italy had risen 
to $27,930, while real GDP per capita in Argentina was only $12,931. In other words, be-
cause of a relatively small difference in the growth rates of the two economies, the standard 
of living of the typical person in Italy went from being below that of the typical person in 
Argentina to being much higher. The important point to keep in mind is this: In the long 
run, small differences in economic growth rates result in big differences in living standards.
Why Do Growth Rates Matter?
Why should anyone care about growth rates? Growth rates matter because an economy 
that grows too slowly fails to raise living standards. In some countries in Africa and 
Asia, very little economic growth has occurred in the past 50 years, so many people 
remain in severe poverty. In high-income countries, only 4 out of every 1,000 babies die 
before they are they one year old. In the poorest countries, more than 100 out of every 
1,000 babies die before they are one year old, and millions of children die annually from 
diseases that could be avoided by having access to clean water or that could be cured by 
using medicines that cost only a few dollars.
Although their problems are less dramatic, countries that experience slow growth 
have also missed opportunities to improve the lives of their citizens. For example, the 
failure of Argentina to grow as rapidly as the other countries that had similar levels of 
GDP per capita in 1950 has left many of its people in poverty. Life expectancy in Ar-
gentina is lower than in the United States and other high-income countries, and nearly 
twice as many babies in Argentina die before age one.

real GDP per capita that have allowed some 
countries to attain high standards of living.

Don’t Confuse the Average Annual 
Percentage Change with the Total 
Percentage Change
When economists talk about growth rates over a period of 
more than one year, the numbers are always average an-
nual percentage changes and not total percentage changes. 
For example, in the United States, real GDP per capita 
was $13,213 in 1950 and $42,205 in 2010. The percentage 
change in real GDP per capita between these two years is
a +42,205 - +13,213
+13,213
b * 100 = 219%.
However, this is not the growth rate between the two 
years. The growth rate between these two years is the rate 
at which $13,213 in 1950 would have to grow on aver-
age each year to end up as $42,205 in 2010, which is 2.0 
percent.

“The Rich Get Richer and . . .”
We can divide the world’s economies into two groups: the high-income countries, 
sometimes also referred to as the industrial countries, and the poorer countries, or 
developing countries. The high-income countries include the countries of Western 
Europe, Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, and the United States. The develop-
ing countries include most of the countries of Africa, Asia, and Latin America. In 
the 1980s and 1990s, a small group of countries, mostly East Asian countries such 
as Singapore, South  Korea, and Taiwan, experienced high rates of growth and are 
sometimes referred to as the newly industrializing countries. Figure 22.2 shows the

C H A P T E R  2 2  Long-Run Economic Growth: Sources and Policies
Is Income All That Matters?
The more income you have, the more goods and services you 
can buy. When people are surviving on very low incomes of 
$2 per day or less, their ability to buy even minimal amounts 
of food, clothing, and housing is limited. So, most economists 
argue that unless the incomes of the very poor increase significantly, they will be unable 
to attain a higher standard of living. In some countries—primarily those colored yellow 
in Figure 22.2—the growth in average income has been very slow, 
or even negative, over a period of decades. Many economists and 
policymakers have concluded that the standard of living in these 
countries has been largely unchanged for many years.
Recently, however, some economists have argued that if we 
look beyond income to other measures of the standard of liv-
ing, we can see that even the poorest countries have made sig-
nificant progress in recent decades. For example, Charles Kenny, 
an economist with the World Bank, argues that “those countries 
with the lowest quality of life are making the fastest progress in 
improving it—across a range of measures including health, ed-
ucation, and civil and political liberties.” For example, between 
1960 and 2010, deaths among children declined, often by more 
than 50 percent, in nearly all countries, including most of those 
with the lowest incomes. Even in sub-Saharan Africa, where 
growth in incomes has been very slow, the percentage of children 
dying before age five has decreased by more than 30 percent over 
the past 50 years. Similarly, the percentage of people able to read and write has more 
than doubled in sub-Saharan Africa since 1970. Many more people now live in democ-
racies where basic civil rights are respected than at any other time in world history. 
Although some countries, such as Somalia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 
and Afghanistan, have suffered from civil wars, political instability has also decreased 
in many countries in recent years, which has reduced the likelihood of dying from 
violence.
What explains these improvements in health, education, democracy, and political 
stability? William Easterly, an economist at New York University, has found that al-
though at any given time, countries that have a higher income also have a higher stan-
dard of living, over time increases in income within a particular country typically have 
very little effect on the country’s standard of living in terms of health, education, in-
dividual rights, political stability, and similar factors. Kenny’s argument and Easterly’s 
finding are connected: Some increases in living standards do not require significant 
increases in income. The key factors in raising living standards in low-income coun-
tries have been increases in technology and knowledge—such as the development of 
inexpensive vaccines that reduce epidemics or the use of mosquito-resistant netting 
that reduces prevalence of malaria—that are inexpensive enough to be widely available. 
Changes in attitudes, such as placing a greater value on education, particularly for girls, 
or increasing support for political freedoms, have also played a role in improving condi-
tions in low-income countries.
There are limits, of course, to how much living standards can increase if in-
comes stagnate. Ultimately, much higher rates of economic growth will be necessary 
levels of GDP per capita around the world in 2010. GDP is measured in U.S. dollars, 
corrected for differences across countries in the cost of living. In 2010, GDP per 
capita ranged from a high of $82,600 in Luxembourg to a low of $300 in the African  
countries of Burundi and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. To understand why 
the gap between rich and poor countries  exists, we need to look at what causes econ-
omies to grow.

What Determines How Fast 
Economies Grow?
To explain changes in economic growth rates over time within countries and differences 
in growth rates among countries, we need to develop an economic growth model. An 
 economic growth model explains growth rates in real GDP per capita over the long run. 
As we noted in Chapter 21, the average person can buy more goods and services only if 
the average worker produces more goods and services. Recall that labor productivity is 
the quantity of goods and services that can be produced by one worker or by one hour of 
work. Because of the importance of labor productivity in explaining economic growth, the 
economic growth model focuses on the causes of long-run increases in labor productivity.
How can a country’s workers become more productive? Economists believe two key 
factors determine labor productivity: the quantity of capital per hour worked and the 
level of technology. Therefore, the economic growth model focuses on technological 
change and changes over time in the quantity of capital available to workers in explain-
ing changes in real GDP per capita. Recall that technological change is a change in the 
quantity of output firms can produce using a given quantity of inputs.
There are three main sources of technological change:
• 
Better machinery and equipment. Beginning with the steam engine during the In-
dustrial Revolution, the invention of new machinery has been an important source 
of rising labor productivity. Today, continuing improvements in computers, factory 
machine tools, electric generators, and many other machines contribute to  increases 
in labor productivity.
• 
Increases in human capital. Capital refers to physical capital, including computers, 
factory buildings, machine tools, warehouses, and trucks. The more physical capital 
workers have available, the more output they can produce. Human capital is the 
accumulated knowledge and skills that workers acquire from education and train-
ing or from their life experiences. As workers increase their human capital through 
education or on-the-job training, their productivity also increases. The more edu-
cated workers are, the greater is their human capital.
• 
Better means of organizing and managing production. Labor productivity in-
creases if managers can do a better job of organizing production. For example, the 
just-in-time system, first developed by Toyota Motor Corporation, involves assem-
bling goods from parts that arrive at the factory at exactly the time they are needed. 
With this system, Toyota needs fewer workers to store and keep track of parts in the 
factory, so the quantity of goods produced per hour worked increases.
Note that technological change is not the same thing as more physical capital. New 
capital can embody technological change, as when a faster computer chip is embodied 
in a new computer. But simply adding more capital that is the same as existing capital is 
not technological change. To summarize, we can say that a country’s standard of living 
will be higher the more capital workers have available on their jobs, the better the capi-
tal, the more human capital workers have, and the better the job business managers do 
in organizing production.

C H A P T E R  2 2  Long-Run Economic Growth: Sources and Policies
The Per-Worker Production Function
The economic growth model explains increases in real GDP per capita over time as re-
sulting from increases in just two factors: the quantity of physical capital available to 
workers and technological change. Often when analyzing economic growth, we look at 
increases in real GDP per hour worked and increases in capital per hour worked. We use 
measures of GDP per hour and capital per hour rather than per person so we can analyze 
changes in the underlying ability of an economy to produce more goods with a given 
amount of labor without having to worry about changes in the fraction of the population 
working or in the length of the workday. We can illustrate the economic growth model 
using the per-worker production function, which is the relationship between real GDP 
per hour worked and capital per hour worked, holding the level of technology constant. 
Figure 22.3 shows the per-worker production function as a graph. In the figure, we mea-
sure capital per hour worked along the horizontal axis and real GDP per hour worked 
along the vertical axis. Letting K stand for capital, L stand for labor, and Y stand for real 
GDP, real GDP per hour worked is Y/L, and capital per hour worked is K/L. The curve 
represents the production function. Notice that we do not explicitly show technological 
change in the figure. We assume that as we move along the production function, the level 
of technology remains constant. As we will see, we can illustrate technological change us-
ing this graph by shifting up the curve representing the production function.
The figure shows that increases in the quantity of capital per hour worked result 
in movements up the per-worker production function, increasing the quantity of out-
put each worker produces. When holding technology constant, however, equal increases 
in the amount of capital per hour worked lead to diminishing increases in output per 
hour worked. For example, increasing capital per hour worked from $20,000 to $30,000 
increases real GDP per hour worked from $200 to $350, an increase of $150. Another 
$10,000 increase in capital per hour worked, from $30,000 to $40,000, increases real 
GDP per hour worked from $350 to $475, an increase of only $125. Each additional 
$10,000 increase in capital per hour worked results in progressively smaller increases in 
real GDP per hour worked. In fact, at very high levels of capital per hour worked, fur-
ther increases in capital per hour worked will not result in any increase in real GDP per 
hour worked. This effect results from the law of diminishing returns, which states that as 
we add more of one input—in this case, capital—to a fixed quantity of another input—
in this case, labor—output increases by smaller additional amounts.
Why are there diminishing returns to capital? Consider a simple example in which 
you own a copy store. At first you have 10 employees but only 1 copy machine, so each of 
your workers is able to produce relatively few copies per day. When you buy a second copy

The per-worker production function shows 
the relationship between capital per hour 
worked and real GDP per hour worked,

capital per hour worked increase output

For example, an increase in capital per hour 
worked from $20,000 to $30,000 increases 
real GDP per hour worked from $200 to 
$350. An increase in capital per hour worked 
from $30,000 to $40,000 increases real GDP 
per hour worked only from $350 to $475.

machine, your employees will be able to produce more copies. Adding additional copy 
machines will continue to increase your output—but by increasingly smaller amounts. For 
example, adding a twentieth copy machine to the 19 you already have will not increase the 
copies each worker is able to make by nearly as much as adding a second copy machine 
did. Eventually, adding additional copying machines will not increase your output at all.
Which Is More Important for Economic Growth:  
More Capital or Technological Change?
Technological change helps economies avoid diminishing returns to capital. Let’s con-
sider two simple examples of the effects of technological change. First, suppose you have 
10 copy machines in your copy store. Each copy machine can produce 10 copies per 
minute. You don’t believe that adding an eleventh machine identical to the 10 you al-
ready have will significantly increase the number of copies your employees can produce 
in a day. Then you find out that a new copy machine has become available that produces 
20 copies per minute. If you replace your existing machines with the new machines, 
the productivity of your workers will increase. The replacement of existing capital with 
more productive capital is an example of technological change.
Or suppose you realize that the layout of your store could be improved. Maybe the 
paper for the machines is on shelves at the back of the store, which requires your work-
ers to spend time walking back and forth whenever the machines run out of paper. By 
placing the paper closer to the copy machines, you can improve the productivity of your 
workers. Reorganizing how production takes place so as to increase output is also an 
example of technological change.
Technological Change: The Key to Sustaining 
Economic Growth
Figure 22.4 shows the effect of technological change on the per-worker production func-
tion. Technological change shifts up the per-worker production function and a llows an 
economy to produce more real GDP per hour worked with the same quantity of capital 
per hour worked. For example, if the current level of technology puts the economy on 
production function1, then when capital per hour worked is $50,000, real GDP per hour 
worked is $575. Technological change that shifts the economy to production function2 
Figure 22.4
Technological Change 
Increases Output per  
Hour Worked
Technological change shifts up the pro-
duction function and allows more output 
per hour worked with the same amount of 
capital per hour worked. For example, along 
Production function1 with $50,000 in capital 
per hour worked, the economy can produce 
$575 in real GDP per hour worked. How-
ever, an increase in technology that shifts 
the economy to Production function2 makes 
it possible to produce $675 in real GDP per 
hour worked with the same level of capital 
per hour worked.

makes it possible to produce $675 in goods and services per hour worked with the same 
level of capital per hour worked. Further increases in technology that shift the economy 
to higher production functions result in further increases in real GDP per hour worked. 
Because of diminishing returns to capital, continuing increases in real GDP per hour 
worked can be sustained only if there is technological change. Remember that a country 
will experience increases in its standard of living only if it experiences increases in real 
GDP per hour worked. Therefore, we can draw the following important conclusion: In 
the long run, a country will experience an increasing standard of living only if it experi-
ences continuing technological change.
What Explains the Economic Failure 
of the Soviet Union?
The economic growth model can help explain one of the most 
striking events of the twentieth century: the economic collapse 
of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union was formed from the old Russian Empire following 
the Communist revolution of 1917. Under Communism, the Soviet Union was a centrally 
planned economy where the government owned nearly every business and made all pro-
duction and pricing decisions. In 1960, Nikita Khrushchev, the leader of the Soviet Union, 
addressed the United Nations in New York City. He declared to the United States and the 
other democracies, “We will bury you. Your grandchildren will live under Communism.”
Many people at the time took Khrushchev’s boast seriously. Capital per hour worked 
grew rapidly in the Soviet Union from 1950 through the 1980s. At first, these increases 
in capital per hour worked also produced rapid increases in real GDP per hour worked. 
Rapid increases in real GDP per hour worked during the 1950s caused some economists 
in the United States to predict incorrectly that the Soviet Union would someday surpass 
the United States economically. In fact, diminishing returns to capital meant that the 
additional factories the Soviet Union was building resulted in smaller and smaller in-
creases in real GDP per hour worked.
The Soviet Union did experience some technological change—but at a rate much 
slower than in the United States and other high-income countries. Why did the Soviet 
Union fail the crucial requirement for growth: implementing new technologies? The 
key reason is that in a centrally planned economy, the people managing most businesses 
are government employees and not entrepreneurs or independent businesspeople, as is 
the case in market economies. Soviet managers had little incentive to adopt new ways 
of doing things. Their pay depended on producing the quantity of output specified in 
the government’s economic plan, not on discovering new, better, and lower-cost ways to 
produce goods. In addition, these managers did not have to worry about competition 
from either domestic or foreign firms.
Entrepreneurs and managers of firms in the United States, by contrast, are under in-
tense competitive pressure from other firms. They must constantly search for better ways 
of producing the goods and services they sell. Developing and using new technologies 
is an important way to gain a competitive edge and higher profits. The drive for profit 
provides an incentive for technological change that centrally planned economies are un-
able to duplicate. In market economies, decisions about which investments to make and 
which technologies to adopt are made by entrepreneurs and managers who have their own 
money on the line. Nothing concentrates the mind like having your own funds at risk.
In hindsight, it is clear that a centrally planned economy, such as the Soviet Union’s, 
could not, over the long run, grow faster than a market economy. The Soviet Union 
collapsed in 1991, and contemporary Russia now has a more market-oriented system, 
although the government continues to play a much larger role in the economy than does 
the government in the United States.

Step 1: Review the chapter material. This problem is about using the economic 
growth model to explain the failure of the Soviet economy, so you may want 
to review the Making the Connection on page 720.
Step 2: Draw a graph like Figure 22.3 on page 718 to illustrate the economic prob-
lems of the Soviet Union. For simplicity, assume that the Soviet Union expe-
rienced no technological change.
The Soviet Union experienced rapid increases in capital per hour worked 
from 1950 through the 1980s, but its failure to implement new technology 
meant that output per hour worked grew at a slower and slower rate.

New Growth Theory
The economic growth model we have been using was first developed in the 1950s by 
Nobel Laureate Robert Solow of MIT. According to this model, productivity growth 
is the key factor in explaining long-run growth in real GDP per capita. In recent 
years, some economists have become dissatisfied with this model because it does not 

722 
C H A P T E R  2 2  Long-Run Economic Growth: Sources and Policies
explain the factors that determine productivity growth. What has become known as the 
new growth theory was developed by Paul Romer, an economist at Stanford University, 
to provide a better explanation of the sources of productivity change. Romer argues that 
the rate of technological change is influenced by how individuals and firms respond to 
economic incentives. Earlier accounts of economic growth did not explain technologi-
cal change or attributed it to factors such as chance scientific discoveries.
Romer argues that the accumulation of knowledge capital is a key determinant of 
economic growth. Firms add to an economy’s stock of knowledge capital when they 
engage in research and development or otherwise contribute to technological change. 
We have seen that accumulation of physical capital is subject to diminishing returns: 
Increases in capital per hour worked lead to increases in real GDP per hour worked but 
at a decreasing rate. Romer argues that the same is true of knowledge capital at the firm 
level. As firms add to their stock of knowledge capital, they increase their output but at 
a decreasing rate. At the level of the entire economy rather than just individual firms, 
however, Romer argues that knowledge capital is subject to increasing returns. Increas-
ing returns can exist because knowledge, once discovered, becomes available to every-
one. The use of physical capital, such as a computer or machine tool, is rival because if 
one firm uses it, other firms cannot, and it is excludable because the firm that owns the 
capital can keep other firms from using it. The use of knowledge capital, such as the 
chemical formula for a drug that cures cancer, is nonrival, however, because one firm’s 
using that knowledge does not prevent another firm from using it. Knowledge capital is 
also nonexcludable because once something like a chemical formula becomes known, it 
becomes widely available for other firms to use (unless, as we discuss shortly, the gov-
ernment gives the firm that invents a new product the legal right to its exclusive use).
Because knowledge capital is nonrival and nonexcludable, firms can free ride on the 
research and development of other firms. Firms free ride when they benefit from the 
results of research and development they did not pay for. For example, transistor technol-
ogy was first developed at Western Electric’s Bell Laboratories in the 1950s and served as 
the basic technology of the information revolution. Bell Laboratories, however, received 
only a tiny fraction of the immense profits that were eventually made by all the firms that 
used this technology. Romer points out that firms are unlikely to invest in research and 
development up to the point where the marginal cost of the research equals the marginal 
return from the knowledge gained because other firms gain much of the marginal return. 
Therefore, there is likely to be an inefficiently small amount of research and develop-
ment, slowing the accumulation of knowledge capital and economic growth.
Government policy can help increase the accumulation of knowledge capital in 
three ways:
• 
Protecting intellectual property with patents and copyrights. Governments can in-
crease the incentive to engage in research and development by giving firms the ex-
clusive rights to their discoveries for a period of years. The U.S. government grants 
patents to companies that develop new products or new ways of making existing 
products. A patent gives a firm the exclusive legal right to a new product for a pe-
riod of 20 years from the date a patent on the product is applied for. For example, a 
pharmaceutical firm that develops a drug that cures cancer can secure a patent on 
the drug, keeping other firms from manufacturing the drug without permission. The 
profits earned during the period the patent is in force provide firms with an incentive 
for undertaking the research and development. The patent system has drawbacks, 
however. In filing for a patent, a firm must disclose information about the product 
or process. This information enters the public record and may help competing firms 
develop products or processes that are similar but that do not infringe on the patent. 
To avoid this problem, a firm may try to keep the results of its research a trade secret, 
without patenting it. (A famous example of a trade secret is the formula for Coca-
Cola.) Tension also arises between the government’s objectives of providing patent 
protection that gives firms the incentive to engage in research and development and 
making sure that the knowledge gained through the research is widely available, 
which increases the positive effect of the knowledge on the economy. Economists 
 debate the features of an ideal patent system.
New growth theory A model of 
long-run economic growth that 
emphasizes that technological change 
is influenced by economic incentives 
and so is determined by the working 
of the market system.
Patent The exclusive right to produce 
a product for a period of 20 years 
from the date the patent is applied for.

723
Just as a new product or a new method of making a product receives patent 
protection, books, films, and other artistic works receive copyright protection. Un-
der U.S. law, the creator of a book, a film, or other artistic work has the exclusive 
right to use the creation during the creator’s lifetime. The creator’s heirs retain this 
exclusive right for 70 years after the creator’s death.
• 
Subsidizing research and development. The government can use subsidies to in-
crease the quantity of research and development that takes place. In the United 
States, the federal government conducts some research directly. For example, the 
National Institutes of Health conducts medical research. The government also sub-
sidizes research by providing grants to researchers in universities through the Na-
tional Science Foundation and other agencies. Finally, the government provides tax 
benefits to firms that invest in research and development.
• 
Subsidizing education. People with technical training carry out research and de-
velopment. If firms are unable to capture all the profits from research and devel-
opment, they will pay lower wages and salaries to technical workers. These lower 
wages and salaries reduce the incentive to workers to receive this training. If the 
government subsidizes education, it can increase the number of workers who have 
technical training. In the United States, the government subsidizes education by di-
rectly providing free education from grades kindergarten through 12 and by pro-
viding support for public colleges and universities. The government also provides 
student loans at reduced interest rates.
These government policies can bring the accumulation of knowledge capital closer 
to the optimal level.
Joseph Schumpeter and Creative Destruction
The new growth theory has revived interest in the ideas of Joseph Schumpeter. Born 
in Austria in 1883, Schumpeter served briefly as that country’s finance minister. In 
1932, he became an economics professor at Harvard. Schumpeter developed a model of 
growth that emphasized his view that new products unleash a “gale of creative destruc-
tion” that drives older products—and, often, the firms that produced them—out of the 
market. According to Schumpeter, the key to rising living standards is not small changes 
to existing products but, rather, new products that meet consumer wants in qualita-
tively better ways. For example, in the early twentieth century, the automobile displaced 
the horse-drawn carriage by meeting consumer demand for personal transportation in 
a way that was qualitatively better. In the early twenty-first century, the DVD and the 
DVD player displaced the VHS tape and the VCR by better meeting consumer demand 
for watching films at home. Downloading or streaming movies from the Internet may 
be in the process of displacing the DVD just as the DVD displaced the VHS tape.
To Schumpeter, the entrepreneur is central to economic growth: “The function of 
entrepreneurs is to reform or revolutionize the pattern of production by exploiting an 
invention or, more generally, an untried technological possibility for producing new 
commodities or producing an old one in a new way.”
The profits an entrepreneur hopes to earn provide the incentive for bringing to-
gether the factors of production—labor, capital, and natural resources—to start new 
firms and introduce new goods and services. Successful entrepreneurs can use their 
profits to finance the development of new products and are better able to attract funds 
from investors.
Economic Growth in the United States
The economic growth model can help us understand the record of growth in the United 
States. Figure 22.5 shows average annual growth rates in real GDP per hour worked since 
1800. As the United States experienced the Industrial Revolution during the nineteenth 
century, U.S. firms increased the quantities of capital per hour worked. New technologies

such as the steam engine, the railroad, and the telegraph also became available. Together, 
these factors resulted in an average annual growth rate of real GDP per worker of 1.3 
percent from 1800 to 1900. Real GDP per capita grew at the slower rate of 1.1 percent 
during this period. At this growth rate, real GDP per capita would double about every 
63 years, which means that living standards were growing steadily but relatively slowly.
By the twentieth century, technological change had been institutionalized. Many 
large corporations began to set up research and development facilities to improve the 
quality of their products and the efficiency with which they produced them. Universi-
ties also began to conduct research that had business applications. After World War II, 
many corporations began to provide significant funds to universities to help pay for 
research. In 1950, the federal government created the National Science Foundation, 
whose main goal is to support university researchers. The accelerating rate of techno-
logical change led to more rapid growth rates.
Economic Growth in the United States since 1950
Continuing technological change allowed the U.S. economy to avoid the diminishing 
returns to capital that stifled growth in the Soviet economy. In fact, until the 1970s, the 
growth rate of the U.S. economy accelerated over time. As Figure 22.5 shows, growth 
in the first half of the twentieth century was faster than growth during the nineteenth 
century, and growth in the immediate post–World War II period from 1950 to 1972 
was faster yet. Then the unexpected happened: For more than 20 years, from 1973 to 
1994, the growth rate of real GDP per hour worked slowed. The growth rate during 
these years was more than 1 percentage point per year lower than during the 1950–1972 
period. Beginning in the mid-1990s, the growth rate picked up again, although it re-
mained below the levels of the immediate post–World War II period.
What Caused the Productivity Slowdown  
of 1973–1994?
Several explanations have been offered for the productivity slowdown of the mid-1970s 
to mid-1990s, but none is completely satisfying. Some economists argue that productiv-
ity really didn’t slow down; it only appears to have slowed down because of problems in 
measuring productivity accurately. After 1970, services—such as haircuts and financial 
advice—became a larger fraction of GDP, and goods—such as automobiles and ham-
burgers—became a smaller fraction. It is more difficult to measure increases in the out-
put of services than to measure increases in the output of goods. For example, before

Economic Growth in the United States 
725
banks began using automated teller machines (ATMs) in the 1980s, you could withdraw 
money only by going to a bank before closing time—which was usually 3:00 p.m. Once 
ATMs became available, you could withdraw money at any time of the day or night at a 
variety of locations. This increased convenience from ATMs does not show up in GDP. 
If it did, measured output per hour worked would have grown more rapidly.
There may also be a measurement problem in accounting for improvements in the 
environment and in health and safety. During these years, new laws required firms to 
spend billions of dollars reducing pollution, improving workplace safety, and redesign-
ing products to improve their safety. This spending did not result in additional out-
put that would be included in GDP—although it may have increased overall well-being. 
If these increases in well-being had been included in GDP, measured output per hour 
worked would have grown more rapidly.
In the early 1980s, many economists thought the rapid oil price increases that oc-
curred between 1974 and 1979 explained the productivity slowdown, but the productiv-
ity slowdown continued after U.S. firms had fully adjusted to high oil prices. In fact, it 
continued into the late 1980s and early 1990s, when oil prices declined.
Some economists argue that deterioration in the U.S. educational system may 
have contributed to the slowdown in growth from the mid-1970s to mid-1990s. Scores 
on some standardized tests began to decline in the 1970s, which may indicate that 
workers entering the labor force were less well educated and less productive than in  
earlier decades. Another possibility is that the skills required to perform many jobs 
 increased during the 1970s and 1980s, while the preparation that workers had  received 
in school did not keep pace.
The United States was not alone in experiencing the slowdown in productivity. All 
the high-income countries experienced a growth slowdown between the mid-1970s and 
the mid-1990s. Because all the high-income economies began producing more services 
and fewer goods and enacted stricter environmental regulations at about the same time, 
explanations of the productivity slowdown that emphasize measurement problems be-
come more plausible. In the end, though, economists are still debating why the produc-
tivity slowdown took place.
Can the United States Maintain High Rates  
of Productivity Growth?
As Figure 22.5 shows, productivity growth, as measured by increases in real GDP per 
hour worked, increased between 1995 and 2010 compared to the previous 20-year pe-
riod. Some economists argue that the development of a “new economy” based on infor-
mation technology caused the higher productivity growth that began in the mid-1990s. 
The spread of ever-faster and increasingly less expensive computers has made commu-
nication and data processing easier and faster than ever before. Today, a single desktop 
computer has more computing power than all the mainframe computers NASA used to 
control the Apollo spacecrafts that landed on the moon in the late 1960s and early 1970s.
Faster data processing has had a major effect on nearly every firm. Business record 
keeping, once done laboriously by hand, is now done more quickly and accurately by 
computer. The increase in Internet use during the 1990s brought changes to the ways 
firms sell to consumers and to each other. Cell phones, laptop computers, and wireless 
Internet access allow people to work away from the office, both at home and while trav-
eling. These developments have significantly increased labor productivity.
Many economists are optimistic that the increases in productivity that began in the 
mid-1990s will continue. The use of computers, as well as information and communica-
tions technology in general, increases as prices continue to fall. By 2011, well-equipped 
desktop computers could be purchased for less than $300. Further innovations in infor-
mation and communications technology may continue to contribute to strong produc-
tivity growth. Some economists are skeptical, however, about the ability of the economy 
to continue to sustain high rates of productivity growth. These economists argue that 
in the 1990s, innovations in information and communications technology—such as the 
development of the World Wide Web, Windows 95, and computerized inventory control 

726 
C H A P T E R  2 2  Long-Run Economic Growth: Sources and Policies
systems—raised labor productivity by having a substantial effect on how businesses 
operated. By the early 2000s, these economists argue, innovations in information and 
communications technology were having a greater effect on consumer products, such as 
cell phones, than on labor productivity. If the increases in output per hour worked that 
began in the mid-1990s do continue, this trend will be good news for increases in living 
standards in the United States.
Why Isn’t the Whole World Rich?
The economic growth model tells us that economies grow when the quantity of capi-
tal per hour worked increases and when technological change takes place. This model 
seems to provide a good blueprint for developing countries to become rich: (1) Increase 
the quantity of capital per hour worked and (2) use the best available technology. There 
are economic incentives for both of these things to happen in poor countries. The prof-
itability of using additional capital or better technology is generally greater in a develop-
ing country than in a high-income country. For example, replacing an existing computer 
with a new, faster computer will generally have a relatively small payoff for a firm in the 
United States. In contrast, installing a new computer in a Zambian firm where records 
have been kept by hand is likely to have an enormous payoff.
This observation leads to an important conclusion: The economic growth model pre-
dicts that poor countries will grow faster than rich countries. If this prediction is correct, 
we should observe poor countries catching up to rich countries in levels of GDP per 
capita (or income per capita). Has this catch-up—or convergence—actually occurred? 
Here we come to a paradox: If we look only at the countries that currently have high 
incomes, we see that the lower-income countries have been catching up to the higher-
income countries, but the developing countries as a group have not been catching up to 
the high-income countries as a group.
Catch-up: Sometimes but Not Always
We can construct a graph that makes it easier to see whether catch-up is happening. In 
Figure 22.6, the horizontal axis shows the initial level of real GDP per capita, and the 
vertical axis shows the rate at which real GDP per capita is growing. We can then plot 
points on the graph for rich and poor countries. Each point represents the combination

of a country’s initial level of real GDP per capita and its growth rate over the following 
years. Low-income countries should be in the upper-left part of the graph because they 
would have low initial levels of real GDP per capita but fast growth rates. High-income 
countries should be in the lower-right part of the graph because they would have high 
initial levels of real GDP per capita but slow growth rates.
Catch-up among the High-Income Countries If we look at only the countries 
that currently have high incomes, we can see the catch-up predicted by the economic 
growth model. Figure 22.7 shows that the high-income countries that had the lowest 
incomes in 1960, such as Taiwan, Korea, and Singapore, grew the fastest between 1960 
and 2009. Countries that had the highest incomes in 1960, such as Switzerland and the 
United States, grew the slowest.
Are the Developing Countries Catching Up to the High-Income 
Countries? If we expand our analysis to include every country for which 
 statistics are available, it becomes more difficult to find the catch-up predicted 
by the  economic growth model. Figure 22.8 does not show a consistent relation-
ship  between the level of real GDP in 1960 and growth from 1960 to 2009. Some 
countries that had low levels of real GDP per capita in 1960, such as Niger, Mada-
gascar, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, actually experienced negative 
economic growth: They had lower levels of real GDP per capita in 2009 than in 1960. 
Other countries that started with low levels of real GDP per capita, such as Malaysia  
and South  Korea, grew rapidly. Some middle-income countries in 1960, such as 
Venezuela, hardly grew between 1960 and 2009, while others, such as Israel, experi-
enced significant growth.

Solving the Problem
Step 1: Review the chapter material. This problem is about catch-up in the economic 
growth model, so you may want to review the section “Why Isn’t the Whole 
World Rich?” which begins on page 726.

If we look at all countries for which statistics are available, we do not see the catch-
up predicted by the economic growth model. Some countries that had low levels of 
real GDP per capita in 1960, such as Niger, Madagascar, and the Democratic Republic 
of the Congo, actually experienced negative economic growth. Other countries that 
started with low levels of real GDP per capita, such as Malaysia and South Korea, 
grew rapidly. Some middle-income countries in 1960, such as Venezuela, hardly grew 
between 1960 and 2009, while others, such as Israel, experienced significant growth.

Step 2: Explain whether the statistics in the table in part a are consistent with the 
economic growth model. These statistics are consistent with the economic 
growth model. The countries with the lowest levels of real GDP per capita in 
1960 had the fastest growth rates between 1960 and 2009, and the countries 
with the highest levels of real GDP per capita had the slowest growth rates.
Step 3: Explain whether the statistics in the table in part b are consistent with the 
economic growth model. These statistics are also consistent with the economic 
growth model. Once again, the countries with the lowest levels of real GDP per 
capita in 1960 had the fastest growth rates between 1960 and 2009, and the coun-
tries with the highest levels of real GDP per capita had the slowest growth rates.
Step 4: Construct a table that includes all nine countries from the tables in parts a. 
and b. and discuss the results.

The statistics in the new table are not consistent with the predictions of the 
economic growth model. For example, New Zealand and the United King-
dom had higher levels of real GDP per capita in 1960 than did Algeria and 
Venezuela. The economic growth model predicts that New Zealand and the 
United Kingdom should, therefore, have grown more slowly than Algeria and 
Venezuela. The data in the table show, however, that New Zealand and the 
United Kingdom grew faster. Similarly, Belgium grew faster than Brazil, even 
though its real GDP per capita was already much higher than Brazil’s in 1960.
Extra Credit: The statistics in these tables confirm what we saw in Figures 22.7 and 
22.8 on pages 727–728: There has been catch-up among the high-income countries, but 
there has not been catch-up if we include in the analysis all the countries of the world.

Why Haven’t Most Western European Countries, 
Canada, and Japan Caught Up to the United States?
Figure 22.7 indicates that there has been catch-up among the high-income countries over the 
past 50 years. If we look at the catch-up of other high-income countries to the United States, 
we discover a surprising fact: Over the past 20 years, other high-income countries have actu-
ally fallen further behind the United States rather than catching up to it. Figure 22.9 shows 
real GDP per capita in Canada, Japan, and the five largest economies in Western Europe 
relative to real GDP per capita in the United States. The blue bars show real GDP per capita 
in 1990 relative to the United States, and the red bars show real GDP per capita in 2010 rela-
tive to the United States. In each case, relative levels of real GDP per capita were lower in 
2010 than they were in 1990. Each of these countries experienced significant catch-up to the 
United States between 1960 and 1990, but they have experienced no catch-up since 1990.

730 
C H A P T E R  2 2  Long-Run Economic Growth: Sources and Policies
Why have other high-income countries had trouble completely closing the gap in 
real GDP per capita with the United States? Many economists believe there are two 
main explanations: the greater flexibility of U.S. labor markets and the greater efficiency 
of the U.S. financial system. U.S. labor markets are more flexible than labor markets in 
other countries for several reasons. In many European countries, government regula-
tions make it difficult for firms to fire workers and thereby make firms reluctant to hire 
workers in the first place. As a result, many younger workers have difficulty finding 
jobs, and once a job is found, a worker tends to remain in it even if his or her skills and 
preferences are not a good match for the characteristics of the job. In the United States, 
by contrast, government regulations are less restrictive, workers have an easier time 
finding jobs, and workers change jobs fairly frequently. This high rate of job mobility 
ensures a better match between workers’ skills and preferences and the characteristics of 
jobs, which increases labor productivity. Many European countries also have restrictive 
work rules that limit the flexibility of firms to implement new technologies. These rules 
restrict the tasks firms can ask workers to perform and the number of hours they work. 
So, the rules reduce the ability of firms to use new technologies that may require work-
ers to learn new skills, perform new tasks, or work during the night or early mornings.
Workers in the United States tend to enter the labor force earlier, retire later, and 
experience fewer long spells of unemployment than do workers in Europe. As we noted 
in Chapter 20, unemployed workers in the United States typically receive smaller gov-
ernment payments for a shorter period of time than do unemployed workers in Canada 
and most of the countries of Western Europe. Because the opportunity cost of being 
unemployed is lower in those countries, the unemployment rate tends to be higher, and 
the fraction of the labor force that is unemployed for more than one year also tends to 
be higher. Studies have shown that workers who are employed for longer periods tend to 
have greater skills, greater productivity, and higher wages. Many economists believe that 
the design of the U.S. unemployment insurance program has contributed to the greater 
flexibility of U.S. labor markets and to higher rates of growth in labor productivity and 
real GDP per capita.
As we have seen, technological change is essential for rapid productivity growth. 
To obtain the funds needed to implement new technologies, firms turn to the financial 
system. It is important that funds for investment be not only available but also allo-
cated efficiently. We saw in Chapter 8 that large corporations can raise funds by sell-
ing stocks and bonds in financial markets. U.S. corporations benefit from the efficiency 
of U.S. financial markets. The level of legal protection of investors is relatively high in

which means that these countries have ceased catching up to the United States.

U.S. financial markets, which encourages both U.S. and foreign investors to buy stocks 
and bonds issued by U.S. firms. The volume of trading in U.S. financial markets also 
ensures that investors will be able to quickly sell the stocks and bonds they buy. This 
liquidity serves to attract investors to U.S. markets.
Smaller firms that are unable to issue stocks and bonds often obtain funding from 
banks. Entrepreneurs founding new firms—“start-ups”—particularly firms that are 
based on new technologies, generally find that investors are unwilling to buy their 
stocks and bonds because the firms lack records of profitability. Banks are also reluc-
tant to lend to new firms founded to introduce new and unfamiliar technologies. How-
ever, some technology start-ups obtain funds from venture capital firms. Venture capital 
firms raise funds from institutional investors, such as pension funds, and from wealthy 
individuals. The owners of venture capital firms closely examine the business plans of 
start-up firms, looking for those that appear most likely to succeed. In exchange for pro-
viding funding, a venture capital firm often becomes part owner of the start-up and may 
even play a role in managing the firm. A successful venture capital firm is able to attract 
investors who would not otherwise be willing to provide funds to start-ups because the 
investors would lack enough information on the start-up. A number of well-known U.S. 
high-technology firms, such as Google, relied on venture capitals firms to fund their 
early expansion. The ability of venture capital firms to finance technology-driven start-
up firms may be giving the United States an advantage in bringing new products and 
new processes to market.
The U.S. financial system suffered severe problems between 2007 and 2009. But, 
over the long run, it has succeeded in efficiently allocating investment funds.
Why Don’t More Low-Income Countries Experience 
Rapid Growth?
The economic growth model predicts that the countries that were very poor in 1960 
should have grown rapidly over the next 50 years. As we have just seen, a few did, but 
most did not. Why are many low-income countries growing so slowly? There is no sin-
gle answer, but most economists point to four key factors:
• 
Failure to enforce the rule of law
• 
Wars and revolutions
• 
Poor public education and health
• 
Low rates of saving and investment
Failure to Enforce the Rule of Law In the years since 1960, increasing numbers 
of developing countries, including China, have abandoned centrally planned economies 
in favor of more market-oriented economies. For entrepreneurs in a market economy to 
succeed, however, the government must guarantee private property rights and enforce 
contracts. Unless entrepreneurs feel secure in their property, they will not risk starting 
a business. It is also difficult for businesses to operate successfully in a market economy 
unless they can use an independent court system to enforce contracts. The rule of law 
refers to the ability of a government to enforce the laws of the country, particularly with 
respect to protecting private property and enforcing contracts. The failure of many de-
veloping countries to guarantee private property rights and to enforce contracts has hin-
dered their economic growth.
Consider, for example, the production of shoes in a developing country. Suppose 
the owner of a shoe factory signs a contract with a leather tannery to deliver a specific 
quantity of leather on a particular date for a particular price. On the basis of this con-
tract, the owner of the shoe factory signs a contract to deliver a specific quantity of 
shoes to a shoe wholesaler. This contract specifies the quantity of shoes to be delivered, 
the quality of the shoes, the delivery date, and the price. The owner of the leather tan-
nery uses the contract with the shoe factory to enter into a contract with cattle ranchers 
Property rights The rights 
individuals or firms have to the 
exclusive use of their property, 
including the right to buy or sell it.
Rule of law The ability of a 
government to enforce the laws of 
the country, particularly with respect 
to protecting private property and 
enforcing contracts.

for the delivery of hides. The shoe wholesaler enters into contracts to deliver shoes to 
retail stores, where they are sold to consumers. For the flow of goods from cattle ranch-
ers to shoe customers to operate efficiently, each business must carry out the terms of 
the contract it has signed. In developed countries, such as the United States, businesses 
know that if they fail to carry out a contract, they may be sued in court and forced to 
compensate the other party for any economic damages.
Many developing countries do not have functioning, independent court systems. 
Even if a court system does exist, a case may not be heard for many years. In some 
 countries, bribery of judges and political favoritism in court rulings are common. If 
firms cannot enforce contracts through the court system, they will insist on carrying out 
only face-to-face cash transactions. For example, the shoe manufacturer will wait until 
the leather producer brings the hides to the factory and will then buy them for cash. The 
wholesaler will wait until the shoes have been produced before making plans for sales 
to retail stores. Production still takes place, but it is carried out more slowly and inef-
ficiently. With slow and inefficient production, firms have difficulty finding investors 
willing to provide them with the funds they need to expand.
What Do Parking Tickets in New York 
City Tell Us about Poverty  
in the Developing World?
In many developing countries, government officials insist on 
receiving bribes to process most transactions. For example, someone may need to pay 
an official before being allowed to open a shoe store or to purchase farm land. This 
corruption represents a breakdown in the rule of law. Generally, the more corrupt a 
country’s government, the lower the country’s growth rate. Economists at the World 
Bank have developed an index that ranks the countries of the world from most cor-
rupt to least corrupt. The figure below compares GDP per capita in the 20 most cor-
rupt and the 20 least corrupt countries. GDP per capita is more than 10 times higher 
in the least corrupt countries than in the most corrupt countries.
But does corruption cause countries to be poor, or does a country’s being poor lead 
to its being corrupt? Some economists have made the controversial argument that cor-
ruption may be the result of culture. If a culture of corruption exists in a country, then 
the country may have great difficulty establishing an honest government that is will-
ing to enforce the rule of law. Economists Raymond Fisman of the Columbia Business 
School and Edward Miguel of the University of California, Berkeley, came up with an 
ingenious method of testing whether a culture of corruption exists in some countries. 
Every country in the world sends delegates to the United Nations in New York City. 
Under international law, these delegates cannot be prosecuted for violating U.S. laws, 
including parking regulations. So, a delegate to the United Nations can double park or 
park next to a fire hydrant and ignore any parking ticket he or she would receive.

Why Isn’t the Whole World Rich? 
733
Wars and Revolutions Many of the countries that were very poor in 1960 have 
e xperienced extended periods of war or violent changes of government during the years 
since. These wars have made it impossible for countries such as Afghanistan, Angola, 
Ethiopia, the Central African Republic, and the Congo to accumulate capital or adopt 
new technologies. In fact, conducting any kind of business has been very difficult. The 
positive effect on growth of ending war was shown in Mozambique, which suffered 
through almost two decades of civil war and declining real GDP per capita. With the 
end of civil war, Mozambique experienced a strong annual growth rate of 3.7 percent in 
real GDP per capita from 1990 to 2009.
Poor Public Education and Health We have seen that human capital is one of 
the determinants of labor productivity. Many low-income countries have weak public 
school systems, so many workers are unable to read and write. Few workers acquire the 
skills necessary to use the latest technology.
Many low-income countries suffer from diseases that are either nonexistent 
or treated readily in high-income countries. For example, few people in developed 
 countries suffer from malaria, but more than 1 million Africans die from it each year.  
Fisman and Miguel argue that if a culture of corruption exists in some countries, 
the delegates from these countries will be more likely to ignore parking tickets than will 
the delegates from countries without a culture of corruption. Fisman and Miguel gath-
ered statistics on the number of parking violations per delegate and compared the statis-
tics to the World Bank’s index of corruption. They found that as the level of  corruption 
in a country increases, so does the number of parking violations by the country’s United 
Nations delegates. For example, the figure below shows that the 15 percent of coun-
tries that are most corrupt had more than 10 times as many parking violations as the  
15  percent of countries that are least corrupt.

Of course, ignoring parking regulations is a relatively minor form of corruption. 
But if Fisman and Miguel are correct, and a culture of corruption has taken hold in 
some developing countries, then it may be a difficult task to reform their governments 
enough to establish the rule of law.

C H A P T E R  2 2  Long-Run Economic Growth: Sources and Policies
Treatments for AIDS have greatly reduced deaths from this disease in the United 
States and Europe. But millions of people in low-income countries continue to 
die from AIDS. These countries often lack the resources, and their governments 
are often too  ineffective, to provide even routine medical care, such as childhood 
vaccinations.
People who are sick work less and are less productive when they do work. Poor 
 nutrition or exposure to certain diseases in childhood can leave people permanently 
weakened and can affect their intelligence as adults. Poor health has a significant 
 negative effect on the human capital of workers in developing countries.
Low Rates of Saving and Investment To invest in factories, machinery, and com-
puters, firms need funds. Some of the funds can come from the owners of the firm and 
from their friends and families, but as we noted in Chapter 21, firms in high- income 
countries raise most of their funds from bank loans and selling stocks and bonds in 
financial markets. In most developing countries, stock and bond markets do not 
 exist, and often the banking system is very weak. In high-income countries, the funds 
that banks lend to businesses come from the savings of households. In high-income 
countries, many households are able to save a significant fraction of their income. In 
 developing countries, many households barely survive on their incomes and, therefore, 
have little or no savings.
The low savings rates in developing countries can contribute to a vicious cycle of 
poverty. Because households have low incomes, they save very little. Because house-
holds save very little, few funds are available for firms to borrow. Lacking funds, firms 
do not invest in the new factories, machinery, and equipment needed for economic 
growth.  Because the economy does not grow, household incomes remain low, as do 
their  savings, and so on.
The Benefits of Globalization
One way for a developing country to break out of the vicious cycle of low saving and 
investment and low growth is through foreign investment. Foreign direct  investment 
(FDI) occurs when corporations build or purchase facilities in foreign countries. 
 Foreign portfolio investment occurs when an individual or a firm buys stocks or bonds 
issued in another country. Foreign direct investment and foreign portfolio investment 
can give a low-income country access to funds and technology that otherwise would not 
be available. Until recently, many developing countries were reluctant to take advantage 
of this opportunity.
From the 1940s through the 1970s, many developing countries closed themselves 
off from the global economy. They did this for several reasons. During the 1930s and 
early 1940s, the global trading and financial system collapsed as a result of the Great 
Depression and World War II. Developing countries that relied on exporting to the 
high-income countries were hurt economically. Also, many countries in Africa and 
Asia achieved independence from the colonial powers of Europe during the 1950s and 
1960s and were afraid of being dominated by them economically. As a result, many 
developing countries imposed high tariffs on foreign imports and strongly discouraged 
or even prohibited foreign investment. This made it difficult to break out of the vicious 
cycle of poverty.
The policies of high tariff barriers and avoiding foreign investment failed to  produce 
much growth, so by the 1980s, many developing countries began to change policies. The 
result was globalization, which refers to the process of countries becoming more open 
to foreign trade and investment.
If we measure globalization by the fraction of a country’s GDP accounted for  
by exports, we see that globalization and growth are strongly positively associated.  
Figure 22.10 shows that developing countries that were more globalized grew faster 
during the 1990s than developing countries that were less globalized. Globalization has 
benefited developing countries by making it easier for them to get investment funds and 
technology.

Growth Policies

Growth Policies
What can governments do to promote long-run economic growth? We have seen that 
even small differences in growth rates compounded over the years can lead to major 
 differences in standards of living. Therefore, there is potentially a very high payoff to 
government policies that increase growth rates. We have already discussed some of 
these policies in this chapter. In this section, we explore additional policies.
Enhancing Property Rights and the Rule of Law
A market system cannot work well unless property rights are enforced. Entrepreneurs 
are unlikely to risk their own funds, and investors are unlikely to lend their funds to 
entrepreneurs, unless property is safe from being arbitrarily seized. We have seen that 
in many developing countries, the rule of law and property rights are undermined by 
government corruption. In some developing countries, it is impossible for an entrepre-
neur to obtain a permit to start a business without paying bribes, often to several dif-
ferent government officials. Is it possible for a country to reform a corrupt government 
bureaucracy?
Although today the United States ranks among the least corrupt countries, recent 
research by economists Edward Glaeser and Claudia Goldin of Harvard University has 
shown that in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, corruption was a signifi-
cant problem in the United States. The fact that political reform movements and crusad-
ing newspapers helped to reduce corruption in the United States to relatively low levels 
by the 1920s provides some hope for reform movements that aim to reduce corruption 
in developing countries today.
Property rights are unlikely to be secure in countries that are afflicted by wars and civil 
strife. For a number of countries, increased political stability is a necessary prerequisite to 
economic growth.

C H A P T E R  2 2  Long-Run Economic Growth: Sources and Policies
Improving Health and Education
Recently, many economists have become convinced that poor health is a major 
 impediment to growth in some countries. As we saw in Chapter 21, the research of 
Nobel  Laureate Robert Fogel emphasizes the important interaction between health 
same time period. If these growth rates were to continue, then China’s standard of living 
would exceed the U.S. standard of living in the year 2038. However, for China to main-
tain its high rates of growth in real GDP per capita, it would have to maintain high rates 
of productivity growth, which is unlikely for several reasons. First, the United States in-
vests more in activities, such as research and development, that result in new technolo-
gies and increases in productivity. Second, much of China’s growth is likely due to the 
transition from a centrally planned economy to a market economy, so China’s growth 
rate is likely to decrease as the transition is completed.
Another looming problem is demographic. Because of China’s low birthrate, the 
country will soon experience a decline in its labor force. Over the next two decades, the 
population of men and women between 15 and 29 years will fall by roughly 100  million, 
or about 30 percent. China will also experience a large increase in older workers, a 
group that will likely be less educated and less healthy than younger workers. Given 
current trends, the U.S. Census Bureau projects fewer people under age 50 in China in 
2030 than today, including fewer people in their twenties and early thirties and many 
more people in their sixties and older. China still has potential sources for enhancing 
productivity, including the migration of rural workers to more productive urban jobs 
and wider application of technical know-how. These factors can 
fuel future growth, but at some point, China’s demographic prob-
lems could slow growth.
Perhaps most troubling for China is the fact that, as we saw in 
the chapter opener, the country remains autocratic, with the Com-
munist Party refusing to allow meaningful elections and continuing 
to limit freedom of expression. Secure property rights and the rule 
of law have never been fully established in China. Some observers 
believe that the lack of political freedom in China may ultimately 
lead to civil unrest, which could slow growth rates. Whether or not 
civil unrest eventually develops, the lack of democracy in China 
may already be resulting in problems that could slow growth in the 
near future. Nouriel Roubini, an economist at New York University, 
argues that China’s Communist Party may be repeating some of the 
mistakes committed by the Soviet Communist Party decades ago. 
He argues that by employing policies that have resulted in investment being 50 per-
cent of GDP, the government may have boosted short-term growth at the expense of the 
health of the economy in the long term. He notes that:
China is rife with overinvestment in physical capital, infrastructure, and prop-
erty. To a visitor, this is evident in sleek but empty airports and bullet trains . . . 
highways to nowhere, thousands of colossal new central and provincial govern-
ment buildings, ghost towns, and brand-new aluminum smelters kept closed to 
prevent global prices from plunging.
China has been engaged in an economic experiment: Can a country maintain 
high rates of economic growth in the long run while denying its citizens basic political 
rights?

pp. 54–64; and Nouriel Roubini, “Beijing’s Empty Bullet Trains,” Slate, April 14, 2011.

and economic growth. As people’s health improves and they become stronger and 
less susceptible to disease, they also become more productive. Recent initiatives in 
developing countries to increase vaccinations against infectious diseases, to improve 
access to treated water, and to improve sanitation have begun to reduce rates of illness 
and death.
We discussed earlier in this chapter Paul Romer’s argument that there are increas-
ing returns to knowledge capital. Nobel Laureate Robert Lucas of the University of Chi-
cago similarly argues that there are increasing returns to human capital. Lucas argues 
that productivity increases as the total stock of human capital increases but that these 
productivity increases are not completely captured by individuals as they decide how 
much education to purchase. Therefore, the market may produce an inefficiently low 
level of education and training unless education is supported by the government. Some 
researchers have been unable to find evidence of increasing returns to human capital, 
but many economists believe that government subsidies for education have played an 
important role in promoting economic growth.
The rising incomes that result from economic growth can help developing coun-
tries deal with the brain drain. The brain drain refers to highly educated and suc-
cessful individuals leaving developing countries for high-income countries. This 
migration occurs when successful individuals believe that economic opportunities are 
very limited in the domestic economy. Rapid economic growth in India and China in 
 recent years has resulted in more entrepreneurs, engineers, and scientists deciding to 
 remain in those countries rather than leave for the United States or other high-income 
countries.
Policies That Promote Technological Change
One of the lessons from the economic growth model is that technological change is 
more important than increases in capital in explaining long-run growth. Government 
policies that facilitate access to technology are crucial for low-income countries. The 
easiest way for developing countries to gain access to technology is through foreign 
 direct investment, where foreign firms are allowed to build new facilities or to buy do-
mestic firms. Recent economic growth in India has been greatly aided by the Indian 
government’s relaxation of regulations on foreign investment. Relaxing these regula-
tions made it possible for India to gain access to the technology of Dell, Microsoft, and 
other multinational corporations.
In high-income countries, government policies can aid the growth of technology 
by subsidizing research and development. As we noted previously, in the United States, 
the federal government conducts some research and development on its own and also 
provides grants to researchers in universities. Tax breaks to firms undertaking research 
and development also facilitate technological change.
Policies That Promote Saving and Investment
We noted in Chapter 21 that firms turn to the loanable funds market to finance expan-
sion and research and development. Policies that increase the incentives to save and 
invest will increase the equilibrium level of loanable funds and may increase the level 
of real GDP per capita. As we also discussed in Chapter 21, tax incentives can lead to 
increased savings. In the United States, many workers are able to save for retirement by 
placing funds in 401(k) or 403(b) plans or in Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs). 
Income placed in these accounts is not taxed until it is withdrawn during retirement. 
Because the funds are allowed to accumulate tax free, the return is increased, which 
raises the incentive to save.
Governments also increase incentives for firms to engage in investment in physi-
cal capital by using investment tax credits. Investment tax credits allow firms to 
 deduct from their taxes some fraction of the funds they have spent on investment. 
Reductions in the taxes firms pay on their profits also increase the after-tax return on 
investments.

C H A P T E R  2 2  Long-Run Economic Growth: Sources and Policies
Is Economic Growth Good or Bad?
Although we didn’t state so explicitly, in this chapter we have assumed that economic 
growth is desirable and that governments should undertake policies that will increase 
growth rates. It seems undeniable that increasing the growth rates of very low-income 
countries would help relieve the daily suffering that many people in those countries 
 endure. But some people are unconvinced that, at least in the high-income  countries, 
further economic growth is desirable.
The arguments against further economic growth tend to be motivated either by 
concern about the effects of growth on the environment or by concern about the effects 
of the globalization process that has accompanied economic growth in recent years. 
In 1973, the Club of Rome published a controversial book titled The Limits to Growth, 
which predicted that economic growth would likely grind to a halt in the United States 
and other high-income countries because of increasing pollution and the depletion of 
natural resources, such as oil. Although these dire predictions have not yet come to pass, 
many people remain concerned that economic growth may be contributing to global 
warming, deforestation, and other environmental problems.
In Chapter 9, we discussed the opposition to globalization. We noted that some 
people believe that globalization has undermined the distinctive cultures of many coun-
tries, as imports of food, clothing, movies, and other goods have displaced domestically 
produced goods. We have seen that allowing foreign direct investment is an important 
way in which low-income countries can gain access to the latest technology. Some peo-
ple, however, see multinational firms that locate in low-income countries as unethical 
because they claim the firms are paying very low wages and are failing to follow the 
same safety and environmental regulations they are required to follow in high-income 
countries.
As with many other normative questions, economic analysis can contribute to the 
ongoing political debate over the consequences of economic growth, but it cannot settle 
the issue.

Economics in Your Life
Would You Be Better Off without China?
At the beginning of the chapter, we asked you to imagine that you could choose to live and work 
in a world with the Chinese economy growing very rapidly or in a world with the Chinese economy 
as it was before 1978—very poor and growing slowly. Which world would you choose to live in? 
How does the current high-growth, high-export Chinese economy affect you as a consumer? How 
does it affect you as someone about to start a career?
It’s impossible to walk into stores in the United States without seeing products imported from 
China. Many of these products were at one time made in the United States. Imports from China 
replace domestically produced goods when the imports are either less expensive or of higher qual-
ity than the domestic goods they replace. Therefore, the rapid economic growth that has enabled 
Chinese firms to be competitive with firms in the United States has benefited you as a consumer: 
You have lower-priced goods and better goods available for purchase than you would if China 
had remained very poor. As you begin your career, there are some U.S. industries that, because 
of  competition from Chinese firms, will have fewer jobs to offer. But, as we saw when discussing 
international trade in Chapter 9, expanding trade changes the types of products each country 
makes, and, therefore, the types of jobs available, but it does not affect the total number of jobs. 
So, the economic rise of China will affect the mix of jobs available to you in the United States but 
will not make finding a job any more difficult.

 
Conclusion 
739
Conclusion
For much of human history, most people have had to struggle to survive. Even today, 
two-thirds of the world’s population lives in extreme poverty. The differences in living 
standards among countries today are a result of many decades of sharply different rates 
of economic growth. According to the economic growth model, increases in the quantity 
of capital per hour worked and increases in technology determine how rapidly  increases 
will occur in real GDP per hour worked and a country’s standard of  living. The keys to 
higher living standards seem straightforward: Establish the rule of law,  provide basic 
education and health care for the population, increase the amount of capital per hour 
worked, adopt the best technology, and participate in the global economy. However, for 
many countries, these policies have proved very difficult to implement.
Having discussed what determines the growth rate of economies, we will turn in the 
following chapters to the question of why economies experience short-run fluctuations 
in output, employment, and inflation. First, read An Inside Look at Policy on the next 
page for a discussion of the Chinese government’s attempts to become less dependent 
on investment spending for economic growth.

Analysis: China 
Unlikely to Cool 
Investment as Its 
Growth Engine
China’s long-term plan to cut reliance 
on investment as a growth engine is 
clashing with its short-term need for 
protection against a worsening global 
outlook.
Beijing has made it clear that 
 consumption, not investment, must 
eventually do more of the work to 
drive the world’s No. 2 economy.
But with debt troubles in the 
United States and Europe casting 
doubt on worldwide demand, it’s 
likely China will keep investing by the 
billions for now, even if that takes Bei-
jing further from its ultimate goal.
Chinese consumers are a long way 
from becoming big spenders, so mas-
sive investment is still the fastest and 
easiest way for China to prop up its 
economy if push comes to shove. . . . 
Without doubt, having heavy 
investment carries a price. Analysts 
say it generates waste and excess 
 capacity, fuels inflation and produces 
diminishing economic returns. State 
investment is like an unsustainable 
life-support system that China needs 
to wean itself off.
In 2009—the last year for which 
figures are available—investment 
made up 65 percent of China’s gross 
domestic product, a far higher share 
than in other major or Asian econo-
mies. Household consumption, how-
ever, accounted for just 35 percent, 
compared with 70 percent in the 
United States.
 Unstable, Unbalanced, 
 Uncoordinated
In the words of China Premier Wen 
Jiabao, the Chinese growth model is on 
all counts unstable, unbalanced, unco-
ordinated and ultimately unsustainable.
Some of the more bearish econo-
mists argue that wasteful investment 
is inflating a property price bubble 
and saddling banks with bad loans, 
sowing the seeds of a future crisis.
An example of healthier invest-
ment, economists say, would be 
companies stepping up capital expen-
ditures on improving China’s manu-
facturing technologies. . . .
Rebalancing, Some Day 
On the surface, China seems serious 
about following through on promises to 
invest less to rebalance its economy, and 
it has good reasons to be wary of repeat-
ing its 2008 spending spree.
Some of the 4 trillion yuan ($626 
billion) stimulus package announced 
in 2008 was squandered on ill-advised 
projects and economists now worry 
that a sizable fraction of loans to local 
governments won’t be repaid.
Banks may be wary of extending 
more large loans, making it difficult 
for local governments to invest their 
way to growth in the future. . . .
Homes Priced Out of Reach 
Soaring property prices have put 
homes out of reach for many ordi-
nary Chinese, and that has become a 
source of public ire. Keenly aware of 
that, Beijing wants to build more pub-
lic homes to keep them affordable.
And with the real estate market 
accounting for a quarter of total invest-
ment in the first half of this year, China 
could get decent bang for its buck if it 
ramps up spending in the sector. . . .
Despite a Plan for Change, Investment Still 
Spurs China’s Growth
To be sure, Beijing says it wants to 
cure China of its penchant for invest-
ment-driven growth. Under its broad 
five-year economic plan starting from 
2011, it envisions a fairer Chinese 
economy where consumption climbs 
on rising incomes. . . .
 Few Big Spenders
Many analysts have said that 
Chinese consumers cannot pull their 
weight as big spenders because the 
bulk of national income goes to the 
state instead of workers. A flimsy social 
safety net encourages high saving rates.
For younger workers, consump-
tion tends to be higher, but between 
expensive housing and strong cultural 
pressure to support aging parents and 
grandparents, they too face limits on 
how much they can spend.
In a paper published last month, 
the International Monetary Fund 
outlined key reforms China should 
implement to empower its consumers.
It called for a liberalization of fi-
nancial markets; a reduction in personal 
income taxes; better healthcare services, 
increasing the cost of land, energy and 
pollution; raising dividend payouts from 
state firms, and improving labor mobility.
However, it would be years before 
these reforms take effect. . . .

Key Points in the Article
The Chinese economy has been growing at 
a rapid pace over the past decade, due in 
large part to high levels of investment. How-
ever, the Chinese government has stated 
that its recent growth will be unsustain-
able without a shift away from investment 
spending. The government has established 
a five-year economic plan that calls for 
greater reliance on consumption as a means 
to sustain economic growth. Many analysts 
believe that achieving this goal will not hap-
pen anytime soon because (1) a majority of 
national income goes to the government in-
stead of workers, and (2) other reforms are 
needed before  Chinese consumers have 
the willingness and the financial ability to 
significantly increase consumption.
Analyzing the News
a  As you read in the chapter, the quantity 
 of capital available to workers is a 
source of long-run economic growth. From 
1996 to 2010, China experienced an annual 
growth rate of real GDP per capita of more 
than 9 percent. Much of this growth came 
from investment in capital goods. In 2009, 
investment spending accounted for 65 per-
cent of Chinese GDP, a far higher percent-
age than in other major economies, and 
consumption was only 35 percent. In con-
trast, consumption spending is 70 percent 
of GDP in the United States. Relying on in-
vestment as a means of economic growth is 
not a long-run solution, though, as eventu-
ally an economy encounters diminishing re-
turns to capital. Because of diminishing 
returns to capital, further increases in the 
quantity of capital would result in even 
smaller increases in real GDP per worker. 
The production function in the figure below 
illustrates this point: An increase in capital 
per hour worked from (K/L)2010 to (K/L) 2011 
leads to an increase in output per hour 
worked from (Y/L)2010 to (Y/L)2011. This in-
crease in output per hour is much smaller 
than the increase resulting from the same 
size increase in capital per hour worked 
from (K/L)2001 to (K/L)2002, when the level of 
capital per hour worked was much smaller.
b  Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao under-
 stands that the country’s current 
 economic growth model is unsustainable in 
the long run, yet China has continued on 
the path of high rates of investment. A main 
reason for this strategy has been a de-
crease in worldwide demand caused by the 
global economic downturn. While this in-
vestment strategy is not sustainable in the 
long run, some economists have sug-
gested that increasing government expen-
ditures on research and development in an 
effort to improve China’s manufacturing 
technologies would be a good option for 
the Chinese economy.
c  A primary reason that China has yet to 
 succeed in increasing consumption is 
because Chinese consumers have low in-
comes and high savings rates. A large 
 portion of Chinese national income cur-
rently goes to the government rather than 
to workers, although China has announced 
its desire to increase income levels to en-
courage more consumption. Increasing 
consumption may take time, though, as the 
following reforms may be needed to en-
courage consumers to increase spending: 
reduced personal income taxes, liberalized 
financial markets, and improved labor 
mobility.
Thinking Critically 
About Policy
1. What policies can the Chinese govern-
ment pursue to raise the country’s long-
run economic growth without further 
increases in investment spending? How 
would these policies affect China’s per-
worker production function?
2. According to the article, consumption 
in China has not grown significantly 
because a “flimsy social safety net en-
courages high saving rates.” Explain 
what the article means by “flimsy  social 
safety net.” Why would a flimsy social 
safety net lead to high saving rates 
and low rates of consumption? Briefly 
explain.

Summary
Until around 1300 a.d., most people survived with barely enough 
food. Living standards began to rise significantly only after the 
Industrial Revolution began in England in the 1700s, with the 
application of mechanical power to the production of goods. The 
best measure of a country’s standard of living is its level of real 
GDP per capita. Economic growth occurs when real GDP per cap-
ita increases, thereby increasing the country’s standard of living.

Economists Carol Shiue and Wolfgang Keller of the Uni-
versity of Texas at Austin published a study of “market 
efficiency” in the eighteenth century in England, other Eu-
ropean countries, and China. If the markets in a country 
are efficient, a product should have the same price wher-
ever in the country it is sold, allowing for the effect of 
transportation costs. If prices are not the same in two areas 
within a country, it is possible to make profits by buying 
the product where its price is low and reselling it where 
its price is high. This trading will drive prices to equality. 
Trade is most likely to occur, however, if entrepreneurs 
feel confident that their gains will not be seized by the 
government and that contracts to buy and sell can be en-
forced in the courts. Therefore, in the eighteenth century, 
the more efficient a country’s markets, the more its insti-
tutions favored long-run growth. Shiue and Keller found 
that in 1770, the efficiency of markets in England was sig-
nificantly greater than the efficiency of markets elsewhere 
in Europe and in China. How does this finding relate to 
Douglas North’s argument concerning why the Industrial 
Revolution  occurred in England?

A vaccination campaign in southern Africa 
virtually eliminated measles as a killer of 
children. Routine childhood immunization 
combined with measles vaccination in seven 
southern Africa nations starting in 1996 vir-
tually eliminated measles in those countries 
by 2000. A national campaign in Egypt to 
make parents aware of the use of oral rehydra-
tion therapy from 1982 to 1989 cut childhood 
deaths from diarrhea by 82 percent over that 
period.
 
a. Is it likely that real GDP per capita increased signifi-
cantly in southern Africa and Egypt as a result of the 
near elimination of measles and the large decrease in 
childhood deaths from diarrhea? If these events did not 
increase real GDP per capita, is it still possible that they 
increased the standard of living in southern Africa and 
Egypt? Briefly explain.
 
b. Which seems more achievable for a developing  country: 
the elimination of measles and childhood deaths from 
diarrhea or sustained increases in real GDP per capita? 
Briefly explain.

 Economist Charles Kenny of the World Bank has argued 
that:
The process technologies—institutions like 
laws and inventory management systems—
that appear central to raising incomes per 
capita flow less like water and more like bricks. 
But ideas and inventions—the importance of 
ABCs and vaccines for DPT—really might flow 
more easily across borders and over distances.
 
 If Kenny is correct, what are the implications of these facts 
for the ability of low-income countries to rapidly increase 
their rates of growth of real GDP per capita in the decades 
ahead? What are the implications for the ability of these 
countries to increase their standards of living? Briefly 
explain.

 22.2 
LEARNING OBJECTIVE: Use the economic growth model to explain why growth rates differ across countries.
Summary
An economic growth model explains changes in real GDP per 
capita in the long run. Labor productivity is the quantity of goods 
and services that can be produced by one worker or by one hour 
of work. Economic growth depends on increases in labor pro-
ductivity. Labor productivity will increase if there is an increase 
in the amount of capital available to each worker or if there is an 
improvement in technology. Technological change is a change in 
the ability of a firm to produce a given level of output with a given 
quantity of inputs. There are three main sources of technologi-
cal change: better machinery and equipment, increases in human 
capital, and better means of organizing and managing produc-
tion. Human capital is the accumulated knowledge and skills that 
workers acquire from education and training or from their life ex-
periences. We can say that an economy will have a higher standard 
of living the more capital it has per hour worked, the more human 
capital its workers have, the better its capital, and the better the job 
its business managers do in organizing production.
The per-worker production function shows the relationship 
between capital per hour worked and output per hour worked, 
holding technology constant. Diminishing returns to capital means 
that increases in the quantity of capital per hour worked will result 
in diminishing increases in output per hour worked. Technologi-
cal change shifts up the per-worker production function, resulting 
in more output per hour worked at every level of capital per hour 
worked. The economic growth model stresses the importance of 
changes in capital per hour worked and technological change in 
explaining growth in output per hour worked. New growth the-
ory is a model of long-run economic growth that emphasizes that 
technological change is influenced by how individuals and firms 
respond to economic incentives.
One way governments can promote technological change is 
by granting patents, which are exclusive rights to a product for 
a period of 20 years from the date the patent is applied for. To 
Joseph Schumpeter, the entrepreneur is central to the “creative 
 destruction” by which the standard of living increases as qualita-
tively better products replace existing products.

Review Questions
 
2.1 Using the per-worker production function graph from 
Figures 22.3 and 22.4 on pages 718–719, show the effect 
on real GDP per hour worked of an increase in capital per 
hour worked, holding technology constant. Now, again us-
ing the per-worker production function graph, show the 
effect on real GDP per hour worked of an increase in tech-
nology, holding constant the quantity of capital per hour 
worked.
 
2.2 What are the consequences for growth of diminishing 
 returns to capital? How are some economies able to main-
tain high growth rates despite diminishing returns to 
capital?
 
2.3 Why are firms likely to underinvest in research and devel-
opment, which slows the accumulation of knowledge capi-
tal, slowing economic growth? Briefly discuss three ways 
in which government policy can increase the accumulation 
of knowledge capital.
 
2.4 What is the new growth theory? How does the new growth 
theory differ from the growth theory developed by Robert 
Solow?
Problems and Applications
 
2.5 According to a study by an economist at the Federal Re-
serve Bank of Minneapolis, during the mid-1980s, man-
agers at iron mines in Canada and the United States 
increased output per hour worked by 100 percent through 
changes in work rules that increased workers’ effort per 
hour worked and increased the efficiency of workers’ 
effort. Briefly explain whether this increase in output 
per hour worked is an example of an improvement in 
technology.

ity? Lessons from the Dramatic Recovery of the U.S. and Canadian 
Iron-Ore Industries Following Their Early 1980s Crisis,” Federal Re-
serve Bank of Minneapolis Research Department Staff Report 286, 
February 2005.
 
2.6 Which of the following will result in a movement along 
China’s per-worker production function, and which will 
result in a shift of China’s per-worker production function? 
Briefly explain.
 
a. Capital per hour worked increases from 5 million yuan 
per hour worked to 6 million yuan per hour worked.
 
b. The Chinese government doubles its spending on sup-
port for university research.
 
c. A reform of the Chinese school system results in more 
highly trained Chinese workers.
 
2.7 [Related to Solved Problem 22.2 on page 721] Use 
the graph at the top of the next column. to answer the 
following questions.
 
a. True or false: The movement from point A to point B 
shows the effects of technological change.
 
b. True or false: The economy can move from point B 
to point C only if there are no diminishing returns to 
capital.
 
c. True or false: To move from point A to point C, the 
economy must increase the amount of capital per hour 
worked and experience technological change.
 
2.8 [Related to Solved Problem 22.2 on page 721] Shortly 
before the fall of the Soviet Union, the economist Gur Ofer 
of Hebrew University of Jerusalem, wrote this: “The most 
outstanding characteristic of Soviet growth strategy is its 
consistent policy of very high rates of investment, leading 
to a rapid growth rate of [the] capital stock.” Explain why 
this turned out to be a very poor growth strategy.
From Gur Ofer, “Soviet Economic Growth, 1928–1985,” Journal of 
Economic Literature, Vol. 25, No. 4, December 1987, p. 1,784.
 
2.9 Why is the role of the entrepreneur much more important 
in the new growth theory than in the traditional economic 
growth model?
 2.10 [Related to the Making the Connection on page 720] 
The Making the Connection argues that a key difference 
between market economies and centrally planned econo-
mies, like that of the former Soviet Union, is as follows:
In market economies, decisions about which 
investments to make and which technologies 
to adopt are made by entrepreneurs and man-
agers with their own money on the line. In the 
Soviet system, these decisions were usually 
made by salaried bureaucrats trying to fulfill a 
plan formulated in Moscow.
 
 But in large corporations, investment decisions are  often 
made by salaried managers who do not have their own 
money on the line. These managers are spending the money 
of the firm’s shareholders rather than their own money. 
Why, then, do the investment decisions of salaried managers  
in the United States tend to be better for the long-term 
growth of the economy than were the decisions of salaried 
bureaucrats in the Soviet Union?

LEARNING OBJECTIVE: Explain economic catch-up and discuss why many poor countries have not 
experienced rapid economic growth.
Summary
The economic growth model predicts that poor countries will 
grow faster than rich countries, resulting in catch-up. In recent 
decades, some poor countries have grown faster than rich coun-
tries, but many have not. Some poor countries do not experience 
rapid growth for four main reasons: wars and revolutions, poor 
public education and health, failure to enforce the rule of law, and 
low rates of saving and investment. The rule of law refers to the 
ability of a government to enforce the laws of the country, par-
ticularly with respect to protecting private property and enforc-
ing contracts. Globalization has aided countries that have opened 
their economies to foreign trade and investment. Foreign direct 
investment (FDI) is the purchase or building by a corporation of 
a facility in a foreign country. Foreign portfolio investment is the 
purchase by an individual or firm of stocks or bonds issued in an-
other country.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE: Discuss fluctuations in productivity growth in the United States.
Summary
Productivity in the United States grew rapidly from the end of 
World War II until the mid-1970s. Growth then slowed down 
for 20 years before increasing again after 1995. Economists con-
tinue to debate the reasons for the growth slowdown of the mid-
1970s to mid-1990s. Leading explanations for the productivity 
slowdown are measurement problems, high oil prices, and a de-
cline in labor quality. Because Western Europe and Japan expe-
rienced a productivity slowdown at the same time as the United 
States,  explanations that focus on factors affecting only the United 
States are unlikely to be correct. Some economists argue that the 
development of a “new economy” based on information technol-
ogy caused the higher productivity growth that began in the mid-
1990s. Economists debate whether the higher productivity growth 
that began in the mid-1990s will continue.

3.1 Describe the record of productivity growth in the United 
States from 1800 to the present. What explains the slow-
down in productivity growth from the mid-1970s to the 
mid-1990s? Why did productivity growth increase begin-
ning in 1995?

3.3 Figure 22.5 on page 724 shows growth rates in real GDP 
per hour worked in the United States for various periods

capita instead of per hour worked? (Hint: How do you 
think the number of hours worked per person has changed 
in the United States since 1900?)
 
3.4 An article in the Wall Street Journal observes: “For 2008, 
productivity grew an astounding 2.8% from 2007 even as 
the economy suffered through its worst recession in de-
cades.” How is it possible for labor productivity—output 
per hour worked—to increase if output—real GDP—is 
falling?

Journal, April 29, 2009.
 
3.5 Economist Robert Gordon of Northwestern University has 
argued that:
My interpretation of the [information] revo-
lution is that it is increasingly burdened by 
diminishing returns. The push to ever smaller 
devices runs up against the fixed size of the 
human finger that must enter information on 
the device. Most of the innovations since 2000 
have been directed to consumer enjoyment 
rather than business productivity,  including 
video games, DVD players, and iPods. 
iPhones are nice, but the ability to resched-
ule business meetings and look up corporate 
documents while on the road already existed 
by 2003.
 
 If Gordon’s observations about the information revolution 
are correct, what are the implications for future labor pro-
ductivity growth rates in the United States?

b. Congress passes a law that allows taxpayers to reduce 
their income taxes by the amount of state sales taxes 
they pay.
 
c. Congress provides more funds for low-interest loans to 
college students.

Other firms also suffered from the 
slow economic growth in 2011. Cisco Sys-
tems, a manufacturer of computer network-
ing equipment, announced that it would 
lay off 6,500 employees. Lockheed Martin, 
 supplier of weapons to the Department of 
Defense, also announced plans to lay off 
6,500 employees. Layoffs were not lim-
ited to technology firms. Cracker Barrel 
Old Country Store joined the list of firms 
cutting workers. Steven Ricchiuto, chief 
economist at Mizuho Securities, explained, 
“They’re looking to reduce staff [and this] 
means they don’t see a pickup in demand 
going forward.”
These firms were cutting production 
and employment as a result of the sluggish 
growth of total spending, or aggregate ex-

Intel is the world’s largest semiconductor 
manufacturer and a major supplier of the 
microprocessors and memory chips found 
in most personal computers. Robert Noyce 
and Gordon Moore founded the firm in 1968. 
The performance of computers has improved 
very rapidly over the past 40 years, making 
possible the information revolution, in which 
Intel has been a key participant. By 2010, In-
tel had more than 82,000 employees and an-
nual revenues of over $43 billion. Because 
of its dependence on computer sales, Intel is 
vulnerable to the swings of the business cycle. 
During the 2001 recession, for example, In-
tel’s revenue fell 21 percent, and the firm laid 
off 5,000 workers. Intel was also hurt by the 
2007–2009 recession. During the last quarter 
of 2008, its revenues fell 90 percent, and it laid 
off 6,000 workers.
But Intel bounced back in 2010, as the 
U.S. economy recovered from the recession. 
Real GDP grew by 3.0 percent in 2010. In-
creased demand for computers and other 
technology-based products, especially in 
China and other emerging markets, in-
creased the demand for the parts Intel sells 
to computer manufacturers. Intel’s revenue 
continued to grow through the first half 
of 2011, although analysts cautioned that

C H A P T E R  2 3  Aggregate Expenditure and Output in the Short Run  
I
n Chapter 22, we analyzed the determinants of long-run growth in the economy. In the 
short run, as we saw in Chapter 21, the economy experiences a business cycle around 
the long-run upward trend in real GDP. In this chapter, we begin exploring the causes 
of the business cycle by examining the effect of changes in total spending on real GDP.
During some years, total spending in the economy, or aggregate expenditure (AE), and 
total production of goods and services increase by the same amount. If this happens, most 
firms will sell about what they expected to sell, and they probably will not increase or de-
crease production or the number of workers they hire. During other years, total spending in 
the economy increases more than the production of goods and services. In those years, firms 
will increase production and hire more workers. But at other times, such as during 2008 and 
early 2009, total spending does not increase as much as total production. As a result, firms 
cut back on production and lay off workers, and the economy moves into a recession. In this 
chapter, we will explore why changes in total spending play such an important role in the 
economy.
The Aggregate Expenditure Model
The business cycle involves the interaction of many economic variables. A simple model 
called the aggregate expenditure model can help us begin to understand the relationships 
among some of these variables. Recall from Chapter 19 that GDP is the value of all the 
final goods and services produced in an economy during a particular year. Real GDP 
corrects nominal GDP for the effects of inflation. The aggregate expenditure model 
focuses on the short-run relationship between total spending and real GDP. An impor-
tant assumption of the model is that the price level is constant. In Chapter 24, we will 
develop a more complete model of the business cycle that relaxes the assumption of 
constant prices.
The key idea of the aggregate expenditure model is that in any particular year, the 
level of GDP is determined mainly by the level of aggregate expenditure. To understand 
the relationship between aggregate expenditure and real GDP, we need to look more 
closely at the components of aggregate expenditure.
Aggregate Expenditure
Economists first began to study the relationship between changes in aggregate expen-
diture and changes in GDP during the Great Depression of the 1930s. The United 
States, the United Kingdom, and other industrial countries suffered declines in real 
GDP of 20 percent or more during the early 1930s. In 1936, the English economist 
John Maynard Keynes published a book, The General Theory of Employment, Inter-
est, and Money, that systematically analyzed the relationship between changes in 
 aggregate expenditure and changes in GDP. Keynes identified four components of 
 aggregate expenditure that together equal GDP (these are the same four components 
we discussed in Chapter 19):
• 
Consumption (C). This is spending by households on goods and services, such as 
automobiles and haircuts.
• 
Planned investment (I). This is planned spending by firms on capital goods, such 
as factories, office buildings, and machine tools, and by households on new homes. 
• 
Government purchases (G). This is spending by local, state, and federal govern-
ments on goods and services, such as aircraft carriers, bridges, and the salaries of 
FBI agents.
• 
Net exports (NX). This is spending by foreign firms and households on goods and 
services produced in the United States minus spending by U.S. firms and house-
holds on goods and services produced in other countries.
Aggregate expenditure (AE) Total 
spending in the economy: the sum of 
consumption, planned investment, 
government purchases, and net 
exports.
23.1 LEARNING OBJECTIVE
Understand how 
macroeconomic equilibrium is 
determined in the aggregate 
expenditure model.
Aggregate expenditure model A 
macroeconomic model that focuses 
on the short-run relationship 
between total spending and real 
GDP, assuming that the price level 
is constant.

 
The Aggregate Expenditure Model 
751
So, we can write
Aggregate expenditure = Consumption + Planned investment
   + Government purchases + Net exports,
or
AE = C + I + G + NX.
Governments around the world gather statistics on aggregate expenditure on the 
basis of these four components. And economists and business analysts usually explain 
changes in GDP in terms of changes in these four components of spending.
The Difference between Planned Investment  
and Actual Investment
Before considering further the relationship between aggregate expenditure and GDP, 
we need to consider an important distinction: Notice that planned investment spend-
ing, rather than actual investment spending, is a component of aggregate expendi-
ture. You might wonder how the amount that businesses plan to spend on investment 
can be different from the amount they actually spend. We can begin resolving this 
puzzle by remembering that goods that have been produced but have not yet been 
sold are referred to as inventories. Changes in inventories are included as part of 
 investment spending, along with spending on machinery, equipment, office build-
ings, and factories. We assume that the amount businesses plan to spend on machin-
ery and office buildings is equal to the amount they actually spend, but the amount 
businesses plan to spend on inventories may be different from the amount they 
 actually spend.
For example, Doubleday Publishing may print 1.5 million copies of the latest John 
Grisham novel, expecting to sell them all. If Doubleday does sell all 1.5 million, its in-
ventories will be unchanged, but if it sells only 1.2 million, it will have an unplanned 
increase in inventories. In other words, changes in inventories depend on sales of goods, 
which firms cannot always forecast with perfect accuracy.
For the economy as a whole, we can say that actual investment spending will be 
greater than planned investment spending when there is an unplanned increase in 
inventories. Actual investment spending will be less than planned investment spend-
ing when there is an unplanned decrease in inventories. Therefore, actual investment 
will equal planned investment only when there is no unplanned change in inventories. 
In this chapter, we will use I to represent planned investment. We will also assume 
that the government data on investment spending compiled by the U.S. Bureau of 
Economic Analysis represents planned investment spending. This is a simplification, 
however, because the government collects data on actual investment spending, which 
equals planned investment spending only when unplanned changes in inventories 
are zero.
Macroeconomic Equilibrium
Macroeconomic equilibrium is similar to microeconomic equilibrium. In microeco-
nomics, equilibrium in the apple market occurs at the point at which the quantity of 
apples demanded equals the quantity of apples supplied. When we have equilibrium in 
the apple market, the quantity of apples produced and sold will not change unless the 
demand for apples or the supply of apples changes. For the economy as a whole, mac-
roeconomic equilibrium occurs where total spending, or aggregate expenditure, equals 
total production, or GDP:
Aggregate expenditure = GDP.
As we saw in Chapter 22, over the long run, real GDP in the United States grows, 
and the standard of living rises. In this chapter, we are interested in understanding why 
GDP fluctuates in the short run. To simplify the analysis of macroeconomic equilibrium, 
Inventories Goods that have been 
produced but not yet sold.

752 
C H A P T E R  2 3  Aggregate Expenditure and Output in the Short Run  
we assume that the economy is not growing. In the next chapter, we discuss the more 
realistic case of macroeconomic equilibrium in a growing economy. If we assume that 
the economy is not growing, then equilibrium GDP will not change unless aggregate 
expenditure changes.
Adjustments to Macroeconomic Equilibrium
The apple market isn’t always in equilibrium because sometimes the quantity of apples 
demanded is greater than the quantity supplied, and sometimes the quantity supplied 
is greater than the quantity demanded. The same outcome holds for the economy as 
a whole. Sometimes the economy is in macroeconomic equilibrium, and sometimes it 
isn’t. When aggregate expenditure is greater than GDP, the total amount of spending 
in the economy is greater than the total amount of production. With spending being 
greater than production, many businesses will sell more goods and services than they 
had expected to sell. For example, the manager of a Home Depot store might like to 
keep 50 refrigerators in stock to give customers the opportunity to see a variety of dif-
ferent sizes and models. If sales are unexpectedly high, the store may end up with only 
20 refrigerators. In that case, the store will have an unplanned decrease in inventories: 
Its inventory of refrigerators will decline by 30.
How will the store manager react when more refrigerators are sold than expected?  
The manager is likely to order more refrigerators. If other stores selling refrigera-
tors are experiencing similar sales increases and are also increasing their orders, 
then General Electric, Whirlpool, and other refrigerator manufacturers will signifi-
cantly increase their production. These manufacturers may also increase the num-
ber of workers they hire. If the increase in sales is affecting not just refrigerators 
but also other appliances, automobiles, furniture, computers, and other goods and 
 services, then GDP and total employment will begin to increase. In summary, when 
 aggregate expenditure is greater than GDP, inventories will decline, and GDP and total 
 employment will increase.
Now suppose that aggregate expenditure is less than GDP. With spending being less 
than production, many businesses will sell fewer goods and services than they had ex-
pected to sell, so their inventories will increase. For example, the manager of the Home 
Depot store who wants 50 refrigerators in stock may find that because of slow sales, the 
store has 75 refrigerators, so the store manager will cut back on orders for new refrigera-
tors. If other stores also cut back on their orders, General Electric and Whirlpool will 
reduce production and lay off workers.
If the decrease in sales is affecting not just refrigerators but also many other goods 
and services, GDP and total employment will begin to decrease. These events happened 
at many firms during 2008. In summary, when aggregate expenditure is less than GDP, 
inventories will increase, and GDP and total employment will decrease.
Only when aggregate expenditure equals GDP will firms sell what they expected 
to sell. In that case, their inventories will be unchanged, and they will not have an in-
centive to increase or decrease production. The economy will be in macroeconomic 
equilibrium. Table 23.1 summarizes the relationship between aggregate expenditure 
and GDP.

Determining the Level of Aggregate Expenditure in the Economy 
753
Increases and decreases in aggregate expenditure cause the year-to-year changes we 
see in GDP. Economists devote considerable time and energy to forecasting what will 
happen to each component of aggregate expenditure. If economists forecast that aggre-
gate expenditure will decline in the future, that is equivalent to forecasting that GDP 
will decline and that the economy will enter a recession. Individuals and firms closely 
watch these forecasts because changes in GDP can have dramatic consequences. When 
GDP is increasing, so are wages, profits, and job opportunities. Declining GDP can be 
bad news for workers, firms, and job seekers.
When economists forecast that aggregate expenditure is likely to decline and that 
the economy is headed for a recession, the federal government may implement mac-
roeconomic policies in an attempt to head off the decrease in expenditure and keep 
the economy from falling into recession. We discuss these macroeconomic policies in 
Chapters 26 and 27.
Determining the Level of Aggregate 
Expenditure in the Economy
To better understand how macroeconomic equilibrium is determined in the aggregate 
expenditure model, we look more closely at the components of aggregate expenditure. 
Table 23.2 lists the four components of aggregate expenditure for the year 2010. Each 
component is measured in real terms, meaning that it is corrected for inflation by 
being measured in billions of 2005 dollars. Consumption is clearly the  largest compo-
nent of aggregate expenditure. Investment and government purchases are of roughly 
similar size. Net exports were negative because in 2010, as in most years since the early 
1970s, the United States imported more goods and services than it  exported. Next, 
we consider the variables that determine each of the four components of  aggregate 
expenditure.
Consumption
Figure 23.1 shows movements in real consumption from 1979 through the second quar-
ter of 2011. Notice that consumption follows a smooth, upward trend. Only during peri-
ods of recession does the growth in consumption decline.
The following are the five most important variables that determine the level of 
consumption:
• 
Current disposable income
• 
Household wealth
• 
Expected future income
• 
The price level
• 
The interest rate
We now discuss how changes in each of these variables affect consumption.

C H A P T E R  2 3  Aggregate Expenditure and Output in the Short Run  
Current Disposable Income The most important determinant of consumption is 
the current disposable income of households. Recall from Chapter 19 that disposable 
income is the income remaining to households after they have paid the personal in-
come tax and received government transfer payments, such as Social Security payments. 
For most households, the higher their disposable income, the more they spend, and the 
lower their income, the less they spend. Macroeconomic consumption is the total of 
all the consumption of U.S. households. So, we would expect consumption to increase 
when the current disposable income of households increases and to decrease when the 
current disposable income of households decreases. As we discussed in Chapter 19, 
total income in the United States expands during most years. Only during recessions, 
which happen infrequently, does total income decline. The main reason for the general 
upward trend in consumption shown in Figure 23.1 is that disposable income has fol-
lowed a similar upward trend.
Household Wealth Consumption depends in part on the wealth of households. A 
household’s wealth is the value of its assets minus the value of its liabilities. Recall from 
Chapter 8 that an asset is anything of value owned by a person or a firm, and a liability 
is anything owed by a person or a firm. A household’s assets include its home, stock 
and bond holdings, and bank accounts. A household’s liabilities include any loans that 
it owes. A household with $10 million in wealth is likely to spend more than a house-
hold with $10,000 in wealth, even if both households have the same disposable income. 
Therefore, when the wealth of households increases, consumption should increase, and 
when the wealth of households decreases, consumption should decrease. Shares of stock 
are an important category of household wealth. When stock prices increase, house-
hold wealth will increase, and so should consumption. For example, a family whose 
stock holdings increase in value from $50,000 to $100,000 may be willing to spend a 
larger fraction of its income because it is less concerned with adding to its savings. A 
decline in stock prices should lead to a decline in consumption. Economists who have 
studied the determinants of consumption have concluded that permanent increases in 
wealth have a larger impact than temporary increases. A recent estimate of the effect 
of changes in wealth on consumption spending indicates that, for every permanent $1 
increase in household wealth, consumption spending will increase by between 4 and 
5 cents per year.

Do Changes in Housing Wealth  
Affect Consumption Spending?
From 2000 to 2006, housing prices increased sharply in many 
parts of the United States. The figure below shows the S&P/
Case-Shiller index of housing prices, which represents changes in the prices of single-
family homes. As measured by this index, housing prices increased nearly 90 percent 
between the beginning of 2000 and the beginning of 2006. Housing prices then declined 
over 30 percent between the beginning of 2006 and the beginning of 2009. Housing 
wealth equals the market value of houses minus the value of loans people have taken out 
to pay for the houses. For example, someone who owns a house with a market price of 
$200,000 and who has a mortgage of $150,000 would have housing wealth of $50,000. 
Between 2000 and 2005, total housing wealth increased by about $5.5 trillion before 
falling by $7.0 trillion through mid-2011.

Did these big swings in housing wealth affect consumption spending? Economists are 
divided in their opinions. Charles Calomiris of Columbia University, Stanley Longhofer of 
the Barton School of Business, and William Miles of Wichita State University argue that 
changes in housing wealth have little or no effect on consumption. They argue that con-
sumers do not consider houses to be assets similar to their holdings of stocks and bonds 
because they own houses primarily so they can consume the housing services a home pro-
vides. Only consumers who intend to sell their current house and buy a smaller one—for 
example, “empty nesters” whose children have left home—will benefit from an increase in 
housing prices. But taking the population as a whole, the number of empty nesters may be 
smaller than the number of first-time home buyers plus the number of homeowners who 
want to buy larger houses. These two groups are hurt by rising home prices. Although it ap-
pears that consumption increases when housing prices increase, in fact, increases in income 
are responsible for both the increases in housing prices and the increases in consumption; 
increases in housing prices have no independent effect on consumption. (This is an ex-
ample of the omitted variable problem discussed on page 32 of the appendix to Chapter 1.)
Atif Mian and Amir Sufi, both of the University of Chicago, strongly disagree with 
Calomiris, Longhofer, and Miles. Mian and Sufi tracked a sample of 70,000 consumers 
from 1998 to 2008 and found that consumers living in cities that experienced dramatic 
increases in housing prices borrowed heavily as their housing wealth increased. Con-
sumers used these borrowed funds to increase their spending on goods and services. 
Making  
the 
Connection

756 
C H A P T E R  2 3  Aggregate Expenditure and Output in the Short Run  
Expected Future Income Consumption depends in part on expected future income. 
Most people prefer to keep their consumption fairly stable from year to year, even if their 
income fluctuates significantly. Some salespeople, for example, earn most of their income 
from commissions (fixed percentages of the price) on the products they sell. A salesperson 
might have a high income in some years and a much lower income in other years. Most 
 people in this situation keep their consumption steady and do not increase it during good 
years and then drastically cut it back during slower years. If we looked only at the current 
 income of someone in this situation, we might have difficulty estimating the person’s  current 
consumption. Instead, we need to take into account the person’s expected future income. We 
can conclude that current income explains current consumption well but only when  current 
income is not unusually high or unusually low compared with expected future income.
The Price Level Recall from Chapter 20 that the price level measures the average prices 
of goods and services in the economy. Consumption is affected by changes in the price 
level. It is tempting to think that an increase in prices will reduce consumption by mak-
ing goods and services less affordable. In fact, the effect of an increase in the price of one 
product on the quantity demanded of that product is different from the effect of an in-
crease in the price level on total spending by households on goods and services. Changes 
in the price level affect consumption mainly through their effect on household wealth. An 
increase in the price level will result in a decrease in the real value of household wealth. 
For example, if you have $2,000 in a checking account, the higher the price level, the fewer 
goods and services you can buy with your money. If the price level falls, the real value 
of your $2,000 increases. Therefore, as the price level rises, the real value of your wealth 
declines, and so will your consumption, at least a little. Conversely, if the price level falls—
which happens very rarely in the United States—your consumption will increase.
The Interest Rate Finally, consumption depends on the interest rate. When the in-
terest rate is high, the reward for saving is increased, and households are likely to save 
more and spend less. In Chapter 20, we discussed the distinction between the nominal 
interest rate and the real interest rate. The nominal interest rate is the stated interest 
rate on a loan or a financial investment such as a bond. The real interest rate corrects 
the nominal interest rate for the effect of inflation and is equal to the nominal interest 
rate minus the inflation rate. Because households are concerned with the payments they 
will make or receive after the effects of inflation are taken into account, consumption 
spending depends on the real interest rate.
We saw in Chapter 19 that consumption spending is divided into three catego-
ries: spending on services, such as medical care, education, and haircuts; spending on 
nondurable goods, such as food and clothing; and spending on durable goods, such as 
Mian and Sufi believe that the sharp decline in consumption spending in 2008—the 
largest since 1980—occurred because falling housing prices resulted in lower housing 
wealth and lower consumer borrowing to finance spending.
The debate over the effect of changes in housing wealth on consumption spending 
illustrates an important fact about macroeconomics: Many macroeconomic variables, 
such as GDP, housing prices, consumption spending, and investment spending, rise and 
fall at about the same time during the business cycle. Because many macroeconomic 
variables move together, economists sometimes have difficulty determining whether 
movements in one variable are causing movements in another variable.

automobiles and furniture. Spending on durable goods is most likely to be affected by 
changes in the interest rate because a high real interest rate increases the cost of spend-
ing financed by borrowing. The monthly payment on a four-year car loan will be higher 
if the real interest rate on the loan is 4 percent than if the real interest rate is 2 percent.
The Consumption Function Panel (a) in Figure 23.2 illustrates the relationship 
between consumption and disposable income during the years 1960 to 2010. In panel 
(b), we draw a straight line through the points representing consumption and disposable 
income. The fact that most of the points lie almost on the line shows the close relation-
ship between consumption and disposable income. Because changes in consumption 
depend on changes in disposable income, we can say that consumption is a function of 
disposable income. The relationship between consumption spending and disposable in-
come illustrated in panel (b) of Figure 23.2 is called the consumption function.
The slope of the consumption function, which is equal to the change in consump-
tion divided by the change in disposable income, is referred to as the marginal propen-
sity to consume (MPC). Using the Greek letter delta, Δ, to represent “change in,” C to 
represent consumption spending, and YD to represent disposable income, we can write 
the expression for the MPC as follows:
MPC =
Change in consumption
Change in disposable income =
DC
DYD.
For example, between 2006 and 2007, consumption spending increased by $208 
billion, while disposable income increased by $228 billion. The marginal propensity to 
consume was, therefore:
DC
DYD = $208 billion
$228 billion = 0.91.
The value for the MPC tells us that households in 2007 spent 91 percent of the increase 
in their household income.

We can also use the MPC to determine how much consumption will change as in-
come changes. To see this relationship, we rewrite the expression for the MPC:
Change in consumption = Change in disposable income * MPC.
For example, with an MPC of 0.91, a $10 billion increase in disposable income will 
 increase consumption by $10 billion × 0.91, or $9.1 billion.
The Relationship between Consumption  
and National Income
We have seen that consumption spending by households depends on disposable in-
come. We now shift our focus slightly to the similar relationship that exists between 
consumption spending and GDP. We make this shift because we are interested in using 
the aggregate expenditure model to explain changes in real GDP rather than changes in 
disposable income. The first step in examining the relationship between consumption 
and GDP is to recall from Chapter 19 that the differences between GDP and national 
income are small and can be ignored without affecting our analysis. In fact, in this and 
the following chapters, we will use the terms GDP and national income interchangeably. 
Also recall that disposable income is equal to national income plus government transfer 
payments minus taxes. Taxes minus government transfer payments are referred to as net 
taxes. So, we can write the following:
Disposable income = National income - Net taxes.
We can rearrange the equation like this:
National income = GDP = Disposable income + Net taxes.
The table in Figure 23.3 shows hypothetical values for national income (or GDP), 
net taxes, disposable income, and consumption spending. Notice that national in-
come and disposable income differ by a constant amount, which is equal to net taxes 
of $1,000 billion. In reality, net taxes are not a constant amount because they are af-
fected by changes in income. As income rises, net taxes rise because some taxes, such 
as the personal income tax, increase and some government transfer payments, such as 
government payments to unemployed workers, fall. Nothing important is affected in 
our analysis, however, by our simplifying assumption that net taxes are constant. The 
graph in Figure 23.3 shows a line representing the relationship between consumption 
and national income. The line is very similar to the consumption function shown in 
panel (b) of Figure 23.2. We defined the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) as the 
change in consumption divided by the change in disposable income, which is the slope 
of the consumption function. In fact, notice that if we calculate the slope of the line in 
Figure 23.3 between points A and B, we get a result that will not change whether we use 
the values for national income or the values for disposable income. Using the values for 
national income:
DC
DY = +5,250 billion - +3,750 billion
+7,000 billion - +5,000 billion = 0.75.
Using the corresponding values for disposable income from the table:
DC
DYD = +5,250 billion - +3,750 billion
+6,000 billion - +4,000 billion = 0.75.
It should not be surprising that we get the same result in either case. National income 
and disposable income differ by a constant amount, so changes in the two numbers 
always give us the same value, as shown in the last two columns of the table in Fig-
ure 23.3. Therefore, we can graph the consumption function using national income 
rather than using disposable income. We can also calculate the MPC using either the 
change in national income or the change in disposable income and always get the 
same value.

Income, Consumption, and Saving
To complete our discussion of consumption, we can look briefly at the relationships 
among income, consumption, and saving. Households either spend their income, save 
it, or use it to pay taxes. For the economy as a whole, we can write the following:
National income = Consumption + Saving + Taxes.
When national income increases, there must be some combination of an increase in 
consumption, an increase in saving, and an increase in taxes:
Change in national income = Change in consumption + Change in saving
+ Change in taxes.
Using symbols, where Y represents national income (and GDP), C represents con-
sumption, S represents saving, and T represents taxes, we can write the following:
Y = C + S + T
and
DY = DC + DS + DT.
To simplify, we can assume that taxes are always a constant amount, in which case 
DT = 0 so the following is also true:
DY = DC + DS.
 Figure 23.3  
The Relationship between 
Consumption and National 
Income
Because national income differs from dis-
posable income only by net taxes—which, 
for simplicity, we assume are constant—we 
can graph the consumption function us-
ing national income rather than disposable 
income. We can also calculate the MPC, 
which is the slope of the consumption 
function, using either the change in na-
tional income or the change in disposable 
income and always get the same value. 
The slope of the consumption function 
 between point A and point B is equal 
to the change in  consumption—$1,500  
billion—divided by the change in  national  
income—$2,000  billion—or 0.75.

C H A P T E R  2 3  Aggregate Expenditure and Output in the Short Run  
We have already seen that the marginal propensity to consume equals the change 
in consumption divided by the change in income. We can define the marginal propen-
sity to save (MPS) as the amount by which saving increases when disposable income 
 increases. We can measure the MPS as the change in saving divided by the change in 
disposable income. In calculating the MPS, as in calculating the MPC, we can safely 
 ignore the difference between national income and disposable income.
If we divide the last equation on the previous page by the change in income, DY, 
we get an equation that shows the relationship between the marginal propensity to con-
sume and the marginal propensity to save:
DY
DY = DC
DY + DS
DY
or
1 = MPC + MPS.
This equation tells us that when taxes are constant, the marginal propensity to 
 consume plus the marginal propensity to save must always equal 1. They must add up 
to 1  because part of any increase in income is consumed, and whatever remains must 
be saved.

Solving the Problem
Step 1: Review the chapter material. This problem is about the relationship among 
income, consumption, and saving, so you may want to review the section 
 “Income, Consumption, and Saving,” which begins on page 759.
Step 2: Fill in the table. We know that Y = C + S + T. With taxes equal to zero, 
this equation becomes Y = C + S. We can use this equation to fill in the 
“Saving” column. We can use the equations for the MPC and the MPS to fill in 
the other two columns:
MPC = DC
DY
MPS = DS
DY
For example, to calculate the value of the MPC in the second row, we have:
MPC = DC
DY = +8,600 - +8,000
+10,000 - +9,000 =
+600
+1,000 = 0.6.

Planned Investment
Figure 23.4 shows movements in real investment spending from 1979 through the sec-
ond quarter of 2011. Notice that, unlike consumption, investment does not follow a 
smooth, upward trend. Investment declined significantly during the recessions of 1980, 
1981–1982, 1990–1991, 2001, and 2007–2009.
The four most important variables that determine the level of investment are:
• 
Expectations of future profitability
• 
Interest rate
• 
Taxes
• 
Cash flow
Expectations of Future Profitability Investment goods, such as factories, office 
buildings, and machinery and equipment, are long lived. A firm is unlikely to build a 
new factory unless it is optimistic that the demand for its product will remain strong for 
at least several years. When the economy moves into a recession, many firms postpone

C H A P T E R  2 3  Aggregate Expenditure and Output in the Short Run  
buying investment goods even if the demand for their own product is strong because 
they are afraid that the recession may become worse. During an expansion, some firms 
may become optimistic and begin to increase spending on investment goods even be-
fore the demand for their own product has increased. The key point is this: The opti-
mism or pessimism of firms is an important determinant of investment spending.
Residential construction is included in investment spending. Since 1990, residen-
tial construction has averaged about 30 percent of total investment spending. But the 
swings in residential construction have been quite substantial, ranging from 36 percent 
of investment spending at the height of the housing boom in 2005, down to 18 percent 
in 2011. The sharp decline in spending on residential construction beginning in 2006 
helped to bring on the 2007–2009 recession and contributed to the recession’s severity.
Interest Rate Some business investment is financed by borrowing, which takes the 
form of issuing corporate bonds or receiving loans from banks. Households also bor-
row to finance most of their spending on new homes. The higher the interest rate, the 
more expensive it is for firms and households to borrow. Because households and firms 
are interested in the cost of borrowing after taking into account the effects of inflation, 
investment spending depends on the real interest rate. Therefore, holding the other fac-
tors that affect investment spending constant, there is an inverse relationship between 
the real interest rate and investment spending: A higher real interest rate results in less 
investment spending, and a lower real interest rate results in more investment spending. 
As we will discuss further in Chapter 26, the ability of households to borrow money at 
very low real interest rates helps explain the rapid increase in spending on residential 
construction from 2002 to 2006.
Taxes Taxes affect the level of investment spending. Firms focus on the profits that re-
main after they have paid taxes. The federal government imposes a corporate income tax 
on the profits corporations earn, including profits from the new buildings, equipment, 
and other investment goods they purchase. A reduction in the corporate income tax 
increases the after-tax profitability of investment spending. An increase in the corpo-
rate income tax decreases the after-tax profitability of investment spending. Investment 
tax incentives also increase investment spending. An investment tax incentive provides 
firms with a tax reduction when they spend on new investment goods.
Cash Flow Most firms do not borrow to finance spending on new factories, machin-
ery, and equipment. Instead, they use their own funds. Cash flow is the difference be-
tween the cash revenues received by a firm and the cash spending by the firm. Neither 
noncash receipts nor noncash spending is included in cash flow. For example, tax laws 
allow firms to count depreciation to replace worn out or obsolete machinery and equip-
ment as a cost, even if new machinery and equipment have not actually been purchased. 
Because this is noncash spending, it is not included when calculating cash flow. The 
largest contributor to cash flow is profit. The more profitable a firm is, the greater its 
cash flow and the greater its ability to finance investment. During periods of recession, 
many firms experience reduced profits, which in turn reduces their ability to finance 
spending on new factories or machinery and equipment.
Cash flow The difference between 
the cash revenues received by a firm 
and the cash spending by the firm.
Intel Tries to Jump Off  
the Roller Coaster of Information 
Technology Spending
We saw in the chapter opener that continued improvement in 
Intel’s microprocessors has been a key reason the performance of computers has  increased 
so rapidly over the past 40 years. But computers are durable goods, and  spending on them 
follows the business cycle. During recessions, firms and households reduce spending on 
computers, getting by with their existing machines and software. As the graph on the 
next page shows, purchases of information processing equipment and software declined 
8 percent during the 2001 recession and 9 percent during the 2007–2009 recession.

We saw in Chapter 21 that Intel CEO Paul Otellini remained optimistic about the 
future demand for computers and pressed ahead in 2009 with a $7 billion expansion of 
Intel factories in the United States. But Otellini was also concerned that its dependence 
on sales of microprocessors to Apple, Dell, and other computer firms made it vulner-
able to sharp declines in sales during recessions. To help deal with this vulnerability, In-
tel began to develop memory chips that could be used in portable consumer electronic 
devices, such as Apple’s iPod, and in cell phones. Intel made progress toward this goal 
when it came to an agreement with Nokia, which manufactures about 40 percent of cell 
phones sold worldwide, to collaborate on the development of new portable devices.
The cell phone market was particularly attractive to Intel because more than 1 bil-
lion cell phones are sold each year, as opposed to several hundred million computers. 
Sales of cell phones also declined much less during the recession of 2007–2009 than did 
sales of personal computers. Otellini believed Intel’s experience with computer chips 
would allow the company to expand into making chips for other devices because, he 
argued, “All consumer electronics—and I mean all—are aimed at bringing the Internet 
into devices.” By 2011, the new factories the firm started building in 2009 had begun 
to develop results, including production of the Atom chip that it adapted for use in cell 
phones. But Intel faced stiff competition from existing chip suppliers, such as Qual-
comm, Texas Instruments, and NVIDIA, and whether it would succeed in becoming 
less dependent on sales of personal computers remained to be seen.

Government Purchases
Total government purchases include all spending by federal, local, and state govern-
ments for goods and services. Recall from Chapter 19 that government purchases 
do not include transfer payments, such as Social Security payments by the federal 
 government or pension payments by local governments to retired police officers and 
firefighters because the government does not receive a good or service in return.
Figure 23.5 shows levels of real government purchases from 1979 through the sec-
ond quarter of 2011. Government purchases grew steadily for most of this period, with

C H A P T E R  2 3  Aggregate Expenditure and Output in the Short Run  
the exception of the early 1990s, when Congress and Presidents George H. W. Bush and 
Bill Clinton enacted a series of spending reductions after they became concerned that 
spending by the federal government was growing much faster than tax receipts. As a 
result, real government purchases declined for three years, beginning in 1992. Contrib-
uting to the slow growth of government purchases during the 1990s was the end of the 
Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union in 1989. Real federal govern-
ment spending on national defense declined by 24 percent from 1990 to 1998, before 
rising by 60 percent between 1998 and 2011, in response to the war on terrorism and 
the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. As we will discuss further in Chapter 27, total federal 
government purchases increased sharply beginning in 2009, as President Barack Obama 
and Congress attempted to offset declining consumption and investment spending 
 during the recession. Increased federal government purchases were partially offset, 
however, by lower state and local government purchases.
Net Exports
Net exports equal exports minus imports. We can calculate net exports by taking the 
value of spending by foreign firms and households on goods and services produced in 
the United States and subtracting the value of spending by U.S. firms and households 
on goods and services produced in other countries. Figure 23.6 illustrates movements 
in real net exports from 1979 through the second quarter of 2011. During nearly all 
these years, the United States imported more goods and services than it exported, so net 
exports were negative. Net exports usually increase when the U.S. economy is in reces-
sion—although this happened to only a minor extent during the 2001 recession—and 
fall when the U.S. economy is expanding. We will explore the behavior of net exports 
further in Chapter 29.
The following are the three most important variables that determine the level of net 
exports:
• 
The price level in the United States relative to the price levels in other countries
• 
The growth rate of GDP in the United States relative to the growth rates of GDP 
in other countries
• 
The exchange rate between the dollar and other currencies

Determining the Level of Aggregate Expenditure in the Economy 
765
The Price Level in the United States Relative to the Price Levels in Other 
Countries If inflation in the United States is lower than inflation in other countries, 
prices of U.S. products increase more slowly than the prices of products of other coun-
tries. This slower increase in the U.S. price level increases the demand for U.S. products 
relative to the demand for foreign products. So, U.S. exports increase and U.S. imports 
decrease, which increases net exports. The reverse happens during periods when the in-
flation rate in the United States is higher than the inflation rates in other countries: U.S. 
exports decrease and U.S. imports increase, which decreases net exports.
The Growth Rate of GDP in the United States Relative to the Growth 
Rates of GDP in Other Countries As GDP increases in the United States, the 
incomes of households rise, leading them to increase their purchases of goods and ser-
vices. Some of the additional goods and services purchased with rising incomes are pro-
duced in the United States, but some are imported. When incomes rise faster in the 
United States than in other countries, U.S. consumers’ purchases of foreign goods and 
services increase faster than foreign consumers’ purchases of U.S. goods and services. 
As a result, net exports fall. When incomes in the United States rise more slowly than 
incomes in other countries, net exports rise.
The Exchange Rate between the Dollar and Other Currencies As the value 
of the U.S. dollar rises, the foreign currency price of U.S. products sold in other coun-
tries rises, and the dollar price of foreign products sold in the United States falls. For 
example, suppose that the exchange rate between the Japanese yen and the U.S. dollar is 
100 Japanese yen for one U.S. dollar, or ¥100 5 $1. At this exchange rate, someone in the 
United States could buy ¥100 for $1, or someone in Japan could buy $1 for ¥100. Leav-
ing aside transportation costs, at this exchange rate, a U.S. product that sells for $1 in the 
United States will sell for ¥100 in Japan, and a Japanese product that sells for ¥100 in Ja-
pan will sell for $1 in the United States. If the exchange rate changes to ¥150 5 $1, then 
the value of the dollar will have risen because it takes more yen to buy $1. At the new 
exchange rate, the U.S. product that still sells for $1 in the United States will now sell for 
¥150 in Japan, reducing the quantity demanded by Japanese consumers. The Japanese

Net exports were negative in most years between 1979 and 2011. Net exports have

U.S. economy is expanding, although they fell during most of the 2001 recession.

product that still sells for ¥100 in Japan will now sell for only $0.67 in the United States, 
increasing the quantity demanded by U.S. consumers. An increase in the value of the 
dollar will reduce exports and increase imports, so net exports will fall. A decrease in 
the value of the dollar will increase exports and reduce imports, so net exports will rise.
Graphing Macroeconomic Equilibrium
Having examined the components of aggregate expenditure, we can now look more 
closely at macroeconomic equilibrium. We saw earlier in the chapter that macroeco-
nomic equilibrium occurs when GDP is equal to aggregate expenditure. We can use a 
graph called the 45°-line diagram to illustrate macroeconomic equilibrium. (The 45°-
line diagram is also sometimes referred to as the Keynesian cross because it is based on 
the analysis of John Maynard Keynes.) To become familiar with this diagram, consider 
Figure 23.7, which is a 45°-line diagram that shows the relationship between the quan-
tity of Pepsi sold (on the vertical axis) and the quantity of Pepsi produced (on the hori-
zontal axis).
The line on the diagram forms an angle of 45° with the horizontal axis. The line 
represents all the points that are equal distances from both axes. So, points such as A 
and B, where the number of bottles of Pepsi produced equals the number of bottles sold, 
are on the 45° line. Points such as C, where the quantity sold is greater than the quantity 
produced, lie above the line. Points such as D, where the quantity sold is less than the 
quantity produced, lie below the line.
Figure 23.8 is similar to Figure 23.7 except that it measures real national income, 
or real GDP (Y), on the horizontal axis and planned real aggregate expenditure (AE) on 
the vertical axis. Because macroeconomic equilibrium occurs where planned aggregate 
expenditure equals GDP, we know that all points of macroeconomic equilibrium must lie 
along the 45° line. For all points above the 45° line, planned aggregate expenditure will 
be greater than GDP. For all points below the 45° line, planned aggregate expenditure 
will be less than GDP.
The 45° line shows many potential points of macroeconomic equilibrium. During 
any particular year, only one of these points will represent the actual level of equilibrium

real GDP, given the actual level of planned real expenditure. To determine this point, we 
need to draw a line on the graph to show the aggregate expenditure function. The aggre-
gate expenditure function shows us the amount of planned aggregate expenditure that 
will occur at every level of national income, or GDP.
Changes in GDP have a much greater effect on consumption than on planned in-
vestment, government purchases, or net exports. We assume for simplicity that the vari-
ables that determine planned investment, government purchases, and net exports all 
remain constant, as do the variables other than GDP that affect consumption. For ex-
ample, we assume that a firm’s level of planned investment at the beginning of the year 
will not change during the year, even if the level of GDP changes.
Figure 23.9 shows the aggregate expenditure function on the 45°-line diagram. The 
lowest upward-sloping line, C, represents the consumption function, as shown in Figure 
23.2, panel (b), on page 757. The quantities of planned investment, government pur-
chases, and net exports are constant because we assumed that the variables they depend 
on are constant. So, the level of planned aggregate expenditure at any level of GDP is 
the amount of consumption spending at that level of GDP plus the sum of the constant 
amounts of planned investment, government purchases, and net exports. In Figure 23.9, 
we add each component of spending successively to the consumption function line to 
arrive at the line representing planned aggregate expenditure (AE). The C + I line is 
higher than the C line by the constant amount of planned investment; the C + I + G 
line is higher than the C + I line by the constant amount of government purchases; and 
the C + I + G + NX line is higher than the C + I + G line by the constant amount of 
NX. (In many years, however, NX is negative, which would cause the C + I + G + NX 
line to be below the C + I + G line.) The C + I + G + NX line shows all four com-
ponents of expenditure and is the aggregate expenditure (AE) function. At the point 
where the AE line crosses the 45° line, planned aggregate expenditure is equal to GDP, 
and the economy is in macroeconomic equilibrium.
Figure 23.10 makes the relationship between planned aggregate expenditure and 
GDP clearer by showing only the 45° line and the AE line. The figure shows that the AE 
line intersects the 45° line at a level of real GDP of $10 trillion. Therefore, $10  trillion 
represents the equilibrium level of real GDP. To see why this is true, consider the situ-
ation if real GDP were only $8 trillion. By moving vertically from $8 trillion on the

C H A P T E R  2 3  Aggregate Expenditure and Output in the Short Run  
horizontal axis up to the AE line, we see that planned aggregate expenditure will be 
greater than $8 trillion at this level of real GDP. Whenever total spending is greater than 
total production, firms’ inventories will fall. The fall in inventories is equal to the verti-
cal distance between the AE line, which shows the level of total spending, and the 45° 
line, which shows the $8 trillion of total production. Unplanned declines in inventories 
lead firms to increase their production. As real GDP increases from $8 trillion, so will 
total income and, therefore, consumption. The economy will move up the AE line as 
consumption increases. The gap between total spending and total production will fall, 
but as long as the AE line is above the 45° line, inventories will continue to decline, and 
firms will continue to expand production. When real GDP rises to $10 trillion, invento-
ries stop falling, and the economy will be in macroeconomic equilibrium.
As Figure 23.10 shows, if GDP is initially $12 trillion, planned aggregate expen-
diture will be less than GDP, and firms will experience an unplanned increase in in-
ventories. Rising inventories lead firms to decrease production. As GDP falls from $12 
trillion, consumption will also fall, which causes the economy to move down the AE 
line. The gap between planned aggregate expenditure and GDP will fall, but as long 
as the AE line is below the 45° line, inventories will continue to rise, and firms will 
 continue to cut production. When GDP falls to $10 trillion, inventories will stop rising, 
and the economy will be in macroeconomic equilibrium.
Showing a Recession on the 45°-Line Diagram
Notice that macroeconomic equilibrium can occur at any point on the 45° line. Ideally, 
we would like equilibrium to occur at potential GDP. At potential GDP, firms will be 
operating at their normal level of capacity, and the economy will be at the natural rate 
of unemployment. As we saw in Chapter 20, at the natural rate of unemployment, the 
economy will be at full employment: Everyone in the labor force who wants a job will 
have one, except the structurally and frictionally unemployed. However, for equilibrium 
Figure 23.9 
Macroeconomic Equilibrium  
on the 45°-Line Diagram
Macroeconomic equilibrium occurs where 
the aggregate expenditure (AE) line crosses 
the 45° line. The lowest upward-sloping 
line, C, represents the consumption func-
tion. The quantities of planned investment, 
government purchases, and net exports are 
constant because we assumed that the vari-
ables they depend on are constant. So, the 
total of planned aggregate expenditure at 
any level of GDP is the amount of consump-
tion at that level of GDP plus the sum of the 
constant amounts of planned investment, 
government purchases, and net exports. 
We successively add each component of 
spending to the consumption function line 
to arrive at the line representing aggregate 
expenditure.

to occur at the level of potential GDP, planned aggregate expenditure must be high 
enough. As Figure 23.11 shows, if there is insufficient total spending, equilibrium will 
occur at a lower level of real GDP. Many firms will be operating below their normal 
capacity, and the unemployment rate will be above the natural rate of unemployment.
Suppose that the level of potential GDP is $10 trillion. As Figure 23.11 shows, 
when GDP is $10 trillion, planned aggregate expenditure is below $10 trillion, perhaps 
 because business firms have become pessimistic about their future profitability and have 
reduced their investment spending. The shortfall in planned aggregate expenditure that 
leads to the recession can be measured as the vertical distance between the AE line and 
the 45° line at the level of potential GDP. The shortfall in planned aggregate expendi-
ture is exactly equal to the unplanned increase in inventories that would occur if the 
economy were initially at a level of GDP of $10 trillion. The unplanned increase in in-
ventories measures the amount by which current planned aggregate expenditure is too 
low for the current level of production to be the equilibrium level. Or, put another way, 
if any of the four components of aggregate expenditure increased by this amount, the 
AE line would shift upward and intersect the 45° line at GDP of $10 trillion, and the 
economy would be in macroeconomic equilibrium at full employment.
Figure 23.11 shows that macroeconomic equilibrium will occur when real GDP 
is $9.8 trillion. Because this is 2 percent below the potential level of real GDP of 
$10  trillion, many firms will be operating below their normal capacity, and the unem-
ployment rate will be well above the natural rate of unemployment. The economy will 
remain at this level of real GDP until there is an increase in one or more of the compo-
nents of  aggregate expenditure.
The Important Role of Inventories
Whenever planned aggregate expenditure is less than real GDP, some firms will expe-
rience unplanned increases in inventories. If firms do not cut back their production 
promptly when spending declines, they will accumulate inventories. If firms accumulate 
Figure 23.10 
Macroeconomic Equilibrium
Macroeconomic equilibrium occurs where 
the AE line crosses the 45° line. In this case, 
that occurs at GDP of $10 trillion. If GDP 
is less than $10 trillion, the corresponding 
point on the AE line is above the 45° line, 
planned aggregate expenditure is greater 
than total production, firms will experience 
an unplanned decrease in inventories, and 
GDP will increase. If GDP is greater than $10 
trillion, the corresponding point on the AE 
line is below the 45° line, planned aggregate 
expenditure is less than total production, 
firms will experience an unplanned increase 
in inventories, and GDP will decrease.

excess inventories, then even if spending quickly returns to its normal levels, firms will 
have to sell their excess inventories before they can return to producing at normal levels. 
For example, almost half of the sharp 6.7 percent annual rate of decline in real GDP 
during the first quarter of 2009 resulted from firms cutting production as they sold off 
unintended accumulations of inventories.
A Numerical Example of Macroeconomic Equilibrium
In forecasting real GDP, economists rely on quantitative models of the economy. We 
can increase our understanding of the causes of changes in real GDP by considering 
a simple numerical example of macroeconomic equilibrium. Although simplified, this 
example captures some of the key features contained in the quantitative models that 
economic forecasters use. Table 23.3 shows several hypothetical combinations of real 
Figure 23.11 
Showing a Recession  
on the 45°-Line Diagram
When the aggregate expenditure line inter-
sects the 45° line at a level of GDP below 
potential GDP, the economy is in recession. 
The figure shows that potential GDP is  
$10 trillion, but because planned aggregate 
expenditure is too low, the equilibrium level 
of GDP is only $9.8 trillion, where the AE 
line intersects the 45° line. As a result, some 
firms will be operating below their normal 
capacity, and unemployment will be above 
the natural rate of unemployment. We can 
measure the shortfall in planned aggregate 
expenditure as the vertical distance between 
the AE line and the 45° line at the level of 
potential GDP.

GDP and planned aggregate expenditure. The first column lists real GDP. The next four 
columns list levels of the four components of planned aggregate expenditure that occur 
at the corresponding level of real GDP. We assume that planned investment, govern-
ment purchases, and net exports do not change as GDP changes. Because consumption 
depends on GDP, it increases as GDP increases.
In the first row, GDP of $8,000 billion (or $8 trillion) results in consumption of 
$6,200 billion. Adding consumption, planned investment, government purchases, and 
net exports across the row gives planned aggregate expenditure of $8,700 billion, which 
is shown in the sixth column. Because planned aggregate expenditure is greater than 
GDP, inventories will fall by $700 billion. This unplanned decline in inventories will 
lead firms to increase production, and GDP will increase. GDP will continue to increase 
until it reaches $10,000 billion. At that level of GDP, planned aggregate expenditure is 
also $10,000 billion, unplanned changes in inventories are zero, and the economy is in 
macroeconomic equilibrium.
In the last row of Table 23.3, GDP of $12,000 billion results in consumption of 
$8,800 billion and planned aggregate expenditure of $11,300 billion. Because planned 
aggregate expenditure is less than GDP, inventories will increase by $700 billion. 
This unplanned increase in inventories will lead firms to decrease production, and 
GDP will decrease. GDP will continue to decrease until it reaches $10,000 billion, 
unplanned changes in inventories are zero, and the economy is in macroeconomic 
equilibrium.
Only when real GDP equals $10,000 billion will the economy be in macroeconomic 
equilibrium. At other levels of real GDP, planned aggregate expenditure will be higher 
or lower than GDP, and the economy will be expanding or contracting.
Don’t Confuse Aggregate Expenditure 
with Consumption Spending
Macroeconomic equilibrium occurs where planned aggre-
gate expenditure equals GDP. But, remember that planned 
aggregate expenditure equals the sum of consumption 
spending, planned investment spending, government pur-
chases, and net exports, not consumption spending by 
itself. If GDP were equal to consumption, the economy 
would not be in equilibrium. Planned investment plus gov-
ernment purchases plus net exports will always be a posi-
tive number. Therefore, if consumption were equal to GDP, 
aggregate expenditure would have to be greater than GDP. 
In that case, inventories would be decreasing, and GDP 
would be increasing; GDP would not be in equilibrium.
Test your understanding of macroeconomic equilib-
rium with this problem:
Question: Do you agree with the following argument?
The chapter says macroeconomic equilibrium 
occurs where planned aggregate expenditure 
equals GDP. GDP is equal to national income. 
So, at equilibrium, planned aggregate expen-
diture must equal national income. But, we 
know that consumers do not spend all of their 
income: They save at least some and use some 
to pay taxes. Therefore, aggregate expenditure 
will never equal national income, and the basic 
macroeconomic story is incorrect.
Answer: As discussed in Chapter 19, national income equals 
GDP (disregarding depreciation, as we have throughout this 
chapter). So, it is correct to say that in macroeconomic equi-
librium, planned aggregate expenditure must equal national 
income. But the last sentence of the argument is incorrect 
because it assumes that aggregate expenditure is the same 
as consumption spending. Because of saving and taxes, 
consumption spending is always much less than national 
income, but in equilibrium, the sum of consumption spend-
ing, planned investment spending, government purchases, 
and net exports does, in fact, equal GDP and national in-
come. So, the argument is incorrect because it confuses 
consumption spending with aggregate expenditure.

Solved Problem 23.3
Determining Macroeconomic Equilibrium
Fill in the blanks in the following table and determine the equilibrium level of real GDP.
Solving the Problem
Step 1: Review the chapter material. This problem is about determining macro-
economic equilibrium, so you may want to review the section “A Numerical 
 Example of Macroeconomic Equilibrium,” which begins on page 770.
Step 2: Fill in the missing values in the table. We can calculate the missing values in 
the last two columns by using two equations:
Planned aggregate expenditure (AE) = Consumption (C)
 + Planned investment (I) + Government purchases (G)
 + Net exports (NX)
 
and
Unplanned change in inventories = Real GDP (Y)
 -Planned aggregate expenditure (AE).
For example, to fill in the first row, we have AE 5 $6,200 billion 1 $1,675 
billion 1 $1,675 billion 1 (2$500 billion) 5 $9,050 billion; and unplanned 
change in inventories = +8,000 billion - +9,050 billion = - +1,050 billion.

The Multiplier Effect 
773
The Multiplier Effect
To this point, we have seen that aggregate expenditure determines real GDP in the 
short run and we have seen how the economy adjusts if it is not in equilibrium. We 
have also seen that whenever aggregate expenditure changes, there will be a new level 
of equilibrium real GDP. In this section, we will look more closely at the effects of a 
change in aggregate expenditure on equilibrium real GDP. We begin the discussion with 
 Figure 23.12, which illustrates the effects of an increase in planned investment spend-
ing. We assume that the economy starts in equilibrium at point A, at which real GDP 
is $9.6 trillion. Firms then become more optimistic about their future profitability and 
increase spending on factories, machinery, and equipment by $100 billion. This increase 
in investment spending shifts the AE line up by $100 billion, from the dark tan line 
(AE1) to the light tan line (AE2). The new equilibrium occurs at point B, at which real 
GDP is $10.0 trillion, which equals potential real GDP.
Notice that the initial $100 billion increase in planned investment spending results 
in a $400 billion increase in equilibrium real GDP. The increase in planned investment 
spending has had a multiplied effect on equilibrium real GDP. It is not only investment 
spending that will have this multiplied effect; any increase in autonomous expenditure 
will shift up the aggregate expenditure function and lead to a multiplied increase in 
equilibrium GDP. Autonomous expenditure does not depend on the level of GDP. In 
the aggregate expenditure model we have been using, planned investment spending, 
government spending, and net exports are all autonomous expenditures. Consumption 
actually has both an autonomous component, which does not depend on the level of 
GDP, and a nonautonomous—or induced—component that does depend on the level 
of GDP. For example, if households decide to spend more of their incomes—and save 
less—at every level of income, there will be an autonomous increase in consumption 
spending, and the aggregate expenditure function will shift up. If, however, real GDP 
increases and households increase their consumption spending, as indicated by the 
 consumption function, the economy will move up along the aggregate expenditure 
function, and the increase in consumption spending will be nonautonomous.
The ratio of the increase in equilibrium real GDP to the increase in autonomous 
expenditure is called the multiplier. The series of induced increases in consumption 
spending that results from an initial increase in autonomous expenditure is called the 
multiplier effect. The multiplier effect occurs because an initial increase in autono-
mous expenditure sets off a series of increases in real GDP.
23.4 LEARNING OBJECTIVE
Describe the multiplier effect 
and use the multiplier formula 
to calculate changes in 
equilibrium GDP.
Autonomous expenditure An 
expenditure that does not depend on 
the level of GDP.
Multiplier The increase in 
equilibrium real GDP divided by the 
increase in autonomous expenditure.
Multiplier effect The process by 
which an increase in autonomous 
expenditure leads to a larger increase 
in real GDP.
Figure 23.12 
The Multiplier Effect
The economy begins at point A, at which 
equilibrium real GDP is $9.6 trillion. A $100 
billion increase in planned investment shifts 
up aggregate expenditure from AE1 to AE2. 
The new equilibrium is at point B, where real 
GDP is $10.0 trillion, which is potential real 
GDP. Because of the multiplier effect, a $100 
billion increase in investment results in a 
$400 billion increase in equilibrium real GDP.

C H A P T E R  2 3  Aggregate Expenditure and Output in the Short Run  
We can look more closely at the multiplier effect shown in Figure 23.12. Suppose 
the whole $100 billion increase in investment spending shown in the figure consists of 
firms building additional factories and office buildings. Initially, this additional spend-
ing will cause the construction of factories and office buildings to increase by $100 bil-
lion, so GDP will also increase by $100 billion. Remember that increases in production 
result in equal increases in national income. So, this increase in real GDP of $100 billion 
is also an increase in national income of $100 billion. In this example, the income is 
received as wages and salaries by the employees of the construction firms, as profits by 
the owners of the firms, and so on. After receiving this additional income, these work-
ers, managers, and owners will increase their consumption of cars, appliances, furniture, 
and many other products. If the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is 0.75, we 
know the increase in consumption spending will be $75 billion. This additional $75 bil-
lion in spending will cause the firms making the cars, appliances, and other products 
to increase production by $75 billion, so GDP will rise by $75 billion. This increase in 
GDP means national income has also increased by another $75 billion. This increased 
income will be received by the owners and employees of the firms producing the cars, 
appliances, and other products. These workers, managers, and owners in turn will in-
crease their consumption spending, and the process of increasing production, income, 
and consumption will continue.
Eventually, the total increase in consumption will be $300 billion (we will soon 
show how we know this is true). This $300 billion increase in consumption combined 
with the initial $100 billion increase in investment spending will result in a total change 
in equilibrium GDP of $400 billion. Table 23.4 summarizes how changes in GDP and 
spending caused by the initial $100 billion increase in investment will result in equi-
librium GDP rising by $400 billion. We can think of the multiplier effect occurring 
in rounds of spending. In round 1, there is an increase of $100 billion in autonomous

causes GDP to rise by $100 billion. In round 2, induced expenditure rises by $75 billion 
(which equals the $100 billion increase in real GDP in round 1 multiplied by the MPC). 
The $75 billion in induced expenditure in round 2 causes a $75 billion increase in real 
GDP, which leads to a $56 billion increase in induced expenditure in round 3, and so 
on. The final column sums up the total increases in expenditure, which equal the total 
increase in GDP. In each round, the additional induced expenditure becomes smaller 
because the MPC is less than 1. By round 10, additional induced expenditure is only $8 
billion, and the total increase in GDP from the beginning of the process is $377 billion. 
By round 19, the process is almost complete: Additional induced expenditure is only 
about $1 billion, and the total increase in GDP is $398 billion. Eventually, the process 
will be finished, although we cannot say precisely how many spending rounds it will 
take, so we simply label the last round n rather than give it a specific number.
We can calculate the value of the multiplier in our example by dividing the increase 
in equilibrium real GDP by the increase in autonomous expenditure:
DY
DI =
Change in real GDP
Change in investment spending = +400 billion
+100 billion = 4.
With a multiplier of 4, each increase in autonomous expenditure of $1 will result in an 
increase in equilibrium GDP of $4.
The Multiplier in Reverse:  
The Great Depression of the 1930s
An increase in autonomous expenditure causes an increase in 
equilibrium real GDP, but the reverse is also true: A decrease 
in autonomous expenditure causes a decrease in real GDP. Many 
Americans became aware of this fact in the 1930s, when reductions 
in autonomous expenditure were magnified by the multiplier into 
the largest decline in real GDP in U.S. history.
In August 1929, the economy reached a business cycle peak, 
and a downturn in production began. In October, the stock market 
crashed, destroying billions of dollars of wealth and increasing pessi-
mism among households and firms. Both consumption spending and 
planned investment spending declined. The passage by the U.S. Con-
gress of the Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act in June 1930 helped set off a 
trade war that reduced net exports. A series of banking crises that be-
gan in fall 1930 limited the ability of households and firms to finance 
consumption and investment. As aggregate expenditure declined, 
many firms experienced declining sales and began to lay off workers. 
Falling levels of production and income induced further declines in 
consumption spending, which led to further cutbacks in production 
and employment, leading to further declines in income, and so on, in 
a downward spiral. The following table shows the severity of the economic downturn by 
contrasting the business cycle peak of 1929 with the business cycle trough of 1933:

We can use a 45°-line diagram to illustrate the multiplier effect working in reverse 
during these years. The economy was at potential real GDP in 1929, before the declines in 
aggregate expenditure began. Declining consumption, planned investment, and net ex-
ports shifted the aggregate expenditure function down from AE1929 to AE1933, reducing

The severity of the Great Depression forced thousands of firms to declare bankruptcy. 
Even firms that survived experienced sharp declines in sales. By 1933, production at U.S. 
Steel had declined 90 percent, and production at General Motors had declined more than 
75 percent. High rates of unemployment forced many families into poverty and a daily 
struggle for survival. Recovery from the business cycle trough in 1933 was slow. Real GDP 
did not regain its 1929 level until 1936, and a growing labor force meant that the unemploy-
ment rate did not fall below 10 percent until the United States entered World War II in 1941.

A Formula for the Multiplier
Table 23.4 shows that during the multiplier process, each round of increases in con-
sumption is smaller than in the previous round, so eventually, the increases will come to 
an end, and we will have a new macroeconomic equilibrium. But how do we know that 
when we add all the increases in GDP, the total will be $400 billion? We can show that 
this is true by first writing out the total change in equilibrium GDP:
The total change in equilibrium real GDP equals the initial increase in planned
 investment spending = $100 billion
 
Plus the first induced increase in consumption = MPC * +100 billion
 Plus the second induced increase in consumption = MPC * (MPC * +100 billion)
 = MPC2 * +100 billion
 Plus the third induced increase in consumption = MPC * (MPC2 * +100 billion)
 = MPC3 * +100 billion
 Plus the fourth induced increase in consumption = MPC * (MPC3 * +100 billion)
= MPC4 * $100 billion
And so on c

 
The Multiplier Effect 
777
Or:
Total change in GDP = +100 billion + MPC * +100 billion + MPC2
* +100 billion + MPC3 * +100 billion + MPC4 * +100 billion + c)
where the ellipsis (. . .) indicates that the expression contains an infinite number of simi-
lar terms.
If we factor out the $100 billion from each expression, we have:
Total change in GDP = +100 billion * (1 + MPC + MPC2 + MPC3
+ MPC4 + c )
Mathematicians have shown that an expression like the one in the parentheses sums to
1
1 - MPC
.
In this case, the MPC is equal to 0.75. So, we can now calculate that the change in equi-
librium GDP = 1 billion * [1>(1 - 0.75)] = 100 billion * 4 = 400 billion. We have 
also derived a general formula for the multiplier:
Multiplier =
Change in equilibrium real GDP
Change in autonomous expenditure =
1
1 - MPC
.
In this case, the multiplier is 1/(1 − 0.75), or 4, which means that for each additional $1 
of autonomous spending, equilibrium GDP will increase by $4. A $100 billion increase 
in planned investment spending results in a $400 billion increase in equilibrium GDP. 
Notice that the value of the multiplier depends on the value of the MPC. In particular, 
the larger the value of the MPC, the larger the value of the multiplier. For example, if 
the MPC were 0.9 instead of 0.75, the value of the multiplier would increase from 4 to 
1>(1 - 0.9) = 10.
Summarizing the Multiplier Effect
You should note four key points about the multiplier effect:
 1. The multiplier effect occurs both when autonomous expenditure increases and 
when it decreases. For example, with an MPC of 0.75, a decrease in planned 
investment of $100 billion will lead to a decrease in equilibrium income of 
$400 billion.
 2. The multiplier effect makes the economy more sensitive to changes in autonomous 
expenditure than it would otherwise be. Between the fourth quarter of 2005 and the 
first quarter of 2009, spending on residential construction declined more than 50 
percent. This decline in spending set off a series of declines in production, income, 
and spending, so that firms such as automobile dealerships and clothing stores, 
which are far removed from the housing industry, also experienced sales declines. 
Because of the multiplier effect, a decline in spending and production in one sector 
of the economy can lead to declines in spending and production in many other sec-
tors of the economy.
 3. The larger the MPC, the larger the value of the multiplier. With an MPC of 0.75, the 
multiplier is 4, but with an MPC of 0.50, the multiplier is only 2. This direct relation-
ship between the value of the MPC and the value of the multiplier holds true because 
the larger the MPC, the more additional consumption takes place after each rise in 
income during the multiplier process.
 4. The formula for the multiplier, 1>(1 - MPC), is oversimplified because it ignores 
some real-world complications, such as the effect that increases in GDP have on im-
ports, inflation, interest rates, and individual income taxes. These effects combine to 
cause the simple formula to overstate the true value of the multiplier. Beginning in 
Chapter 24, we will start to take into account these real-world complications.

Solved Problem 23.4
Using the Multiplier Formula
Use the information in the table to answer the following questions:
Solving the Problem
Step 1: Review the chapter material. This problem is about the multiplier process, so you 
may want to review the section “The Multiplier Effect,” which begins on page 773.
Step 2: Determine equilibrium real GDP. Just as in Solved Problem 23.2 on page 760, 
we can find macroeconomic equilibrium by calculating the level of planned 
aggregate expenditure for each level of real GDP.

We can see that macroeconomic equilibrium will occur when real GDP equals 
$10,000 billion.
Step 3: Calculate the MPC.

In this case:
MPC =
+800 billion
+1,000 billion = 0.8.
Step 4: Use the multiplier formula to calculate the new equilibrium level of real 
GDP. We could find the new level of equilibrium real GDP by constructing 
a new table with government purchases increased from $1,000 to $1,200. But 
the multiplier allows us to calculate the answer directly. In this case:
Multiplier =
1
1 - MPC =
1
1 - 0.8 = 5.
 
So:
 
Change in equilibrium real GDP = Change in autonomous expenditure * 5.
 
a. What is the equilibrium level of real GDP?
 
b. What is the MPC?
 
c.  Suppose government purchases increase by $200 
billion. What will be the new equilibrium level of 
real GDP? Use the multiplier formula to determine 
your answer.

 
The Aggregate Demand Curve 
779
The Paradox of Thrift
We saw in Chapters 21 and 22 that an increase in savings can increase the rate of eco-
nomic growth in the long run by providing funds for investment. But in the short run, 
if households save more of their income and spend less of it, aggregate expenditure and 
real GDP will decline. In discussing the aggregate expenditure model, John Maynard 
Keynes argued that if many households decide at the same time to increase their saving 
and reduce their spending, they may make themselves worse off by causing aggregate 
expenditure to fall, thereby pushing the economy into a recession. The lower incomes 
in the recession might mean that total saving does not increase, despite the attempts by 
many individuals to increase their own saving. Keynes referred to this outcome as the 
paradox of thrift because what appears to be something favorable to the long-run per-
formance of the economy might be counterproductive in the short run.
As we mentioned in Chapter 19, households had been saving very little of their 
income in the mid-2000s but increased their saving markedly in late 2008 and 2009. 
The personal saving rate is saving by households as a percentage of disposable personal 
income. By mid-2009, the personal saving rate had increased to 6 percent. Some econo-
mists argued that this increase in saving contributed to the recession by reducing con-
sumption spending. Other economists were more skeptical of the reasoning behind the 
paradox of thrift. As we saw in Chapter 21, an increase in saving, by increasing the sup-
ply of loanable funds, should lower the real interest rate and increase the level of invest-
ment spending. This increase in investment spending might offset some or all of the 
decline in consumption spending attributable to increased saving. Economists continue 
to debate the short-run effects of an increase in saving.
The Aggregate Demand Curve
When demand for a product increases, firms usually respond by increasing production, 
but they are also likely to increase prices. Similarly, when demand falls, production falls, 
but often, prices also fall. We would expect, then, that an increase or a decrease in ag-
gregate expenditure would affect not just real GDP but also the price level. Will a change 
in the price level, in turn, affect the components of aggregate expenditure? In fact, as we 
will see, increases in the price level cause aggregate expenditure to fall, and decreases in 
the price level cause aggregate expenditure to rise. There are three main reasons for this 
inverse relationship between changes in the price level and changes in aggregate expen-
diture. We discussed the first two reasons earlier in this chapter, when considering the 
factors that determine consumption and net exports:
• 
A rising price level decreases consumption by decreasing the real value of house-
hold wealth; a falling price level has the reverse effect.
• 
If the price level in the United States rises relative to the price levels in other coun-
tries, U.S. exports will become relatively more expensive, and foreign imports will 
become relatively less expensive, causing net exports to fall. A falling price level in 
the United States has the reverse effect.
• 
When prices rise, firms and households need more money to finance buying and 
selling. If the central bank (the Federal Reserve in the United States) does not

= +11,000 billion.

C H A P T E R  2 3  Aggregate Expenditure and Output in the Short Run  
increase the money supply, the result will be an increase in the interest rate. In 
Chapter 25, we will analyze in more detail why this happens. As we discussed ear-
lier in this chapter, at a higher interest rate, investment spending falls as firms bor-
row less money to build new factories or to install new machinery and equipment 
and households borrow less money to buy new houses. A falling price level has 
the reverse effect: Other things being equal, interest rates will fall, and investment 
spending will rise.
We can now incorporate the effect of a change in the price level into the basic aggre-
gate expenditure model, in which equilibrium real GDP is determined by the intersec-
tion of the aggregate expenditure (AE) line and the 45° line. Remember that we measure 
the price level as an index number with a value of 100 in the base year. If the price level 
rises from, say, 100 to 103, consumption, planned investment, and net exports will all 
fall, causing the AE line to shift down on the 45°-line diagram. The AE line shifts down 
because with higher prices, less spending will occur in the economy at every level of 
GDP. Panel (a) of Figure 23.13 shows that the downward shift of the AE line results in a 
lower level of equilibrium real GDP.
If the price level falls from, say, 100 to 97, then investment, consumption, and net 
exports will all rise. As panel (b) of Figure 23.13 shows, the AE line will shift up, which 
will cause equilibrium real GDP to increase.
Figure 23.14 summarizes the effect of changes in the price level on real GDP. The 
table shows the combinations of price level and real GDP from Figure 23.13. The graph 
plots the numbers from the table. In the graph, the price level is measured on the verti-
cal axis, and real GDP is measured on the horizontal axis. The relationship shown in 
Figure 23.14 between the price level and the level of planned aggregate expenditure is 
known as the aggregate demand (AD) curve.

In panel (a), an increase in the price level results in declining consumption,

to shift down from AE1 to AE2. As a result, equilibrium real GDP declines from 
$10.0 trillion to $9.8 trillion. In panel (b), a decrease in the price level results in 
rising consumption, planned investment, and net exports and causes the aggre-
gate expenditure line to shift up from AE1 to AE2. As a result, equilibrium real 
GDP increases from $10.0 trillion to $10.2 trillion.

 
Conclusion 
781
Conclusion
In this chapter, we examined a key macroeconomic idea: In the short run, the level of 
GDP is determined mainly by the level of aggregate expenditure. When economists 
forecast changes in GDP, they do so by forecasting changes in the four components of 
aggregate expenditure. We constructed an aggregate demand curve by taking into ac-
count how changes in the price level affect aggregate expenditure.
But our story is incomplete. In Chapter 24, we will analyze the aggregate supply 
curve. Then, we will use the aggregate demand curve and the aggregate supply curve 
to show how equilibrium real GDP and the equilibrium price level are simultaneously 
determined.
We also need to discuss the roles that the financial system and government policy 
play in determining real GDP and the price level in the short run. We will cover these 
important topics in the next three chapters. Before moving on, read An Inside Look on 
the next page, for a discussion of how a rebound in sales in the restaurant industry af-
fects aggregate expenditure in the economy.

and net exports to fall, which reduces real

Economics in Your Life
When Consumer Confidence Falls, Is Your Job at Risk?
At the beginning of this chapter, we asked you to suppose that you work part time assembling 
desktop computers for a large computer company. You have learned that consumer confidence in 
the economy has fallen and that many households expect their future income to be dramatically 
less than their current income. Should you be concerned about losing your job? We have seen in 
this chapter that if consumers expect their future incomes to decline, they will cut their consump-
tion spending, and consumption spending is more than two-thirds of aggregate expenditure. So, 
if the decline in consumer confidence is correctly forecasting a decline in consumption spending, 
then aggregate expenditures and GDP will also likely decline. If the economy moves into a reces-
sion, spending on computers by households and firms is likely to fall, which could reduce your 
firm’s sales and possibly cost you a job. Before you panic, though, keep in mind that surveys of con-
sumer confidence do not have a good track record in predicting recessions, so you may not have to 
move back in with your parents after all.

 Workforce Outlook
The restaurant industry posted 
modest job growth last year, and that 
growth is expected to accelerate in 
2011. This year, the industry will add 
jobs at a rate of 2.4 percent, compared 
with the 1.8 percent expected for the 
national economy. In the next de-
cade, the industry will add 1.3 million 
positions.
In the states, the restaurant in-
dustries in Texas and Florida will 
show the strongest job growth over 
the next 10 years at roughly 17 per-
cent, followed by Arizona and Ala-
bama at roughly 16 percent.
Consumer and Menu Trends
According to the National Restaurant 
Association’s 2011 Restaurant Indus-
try Forecast, consumers today spend 
49 percent of their food budget in 
the restaurant community, compared 
with only 25 percent in 1955. The 
economic downturn has created a 
substantial pent-up demand for res-
taurant services—more than two out 
of five consumers say they are not 
dining out or using takeout as often 
as they would like—which positions 
the restaurant industry for growth in 
2011. . . .

“The U.S. restaurant industry is 
an economic juggernaut whose an-

of the world’s economies—if it were 
a country, it would rank as the 18th 
largest economy in the world. While 
pockets of challenges remain, we are 
looking forward to a brighter future in 
2011,” he added.
Industry Segment Growth
Continuing the trend from last 
year, the quick-service restaurant seg-
ment is expected to post slightly stron-
ger sales growth than the full-service 
segment. Quick-service restaurants are 
projected to post sales of $167.7 billion 
this year, a gain of 3.3 percent over 2010. 
Sales at full-service restaurants are pro-
jected to reach $194.6 billion in 2011, an 
increase of 3.1 percent in current dollars 
over 2010. . . .
State and Regional Sales Growth
Among the 50 states, North Carolina 
is expected to post the strongest sales 
growth in 2011 at 4.2 percent (indus-
try sales are projected at $14.1 billion), 
followed by Idaho ($1.8 billion) and

Restaurant industry sales are expected 
to reach a record $604 billion and post 
positive growth in 2011 after a three-
year period of negative real sales 
growth, according to National Restau-
rant Association research released to-
day. The Association’s 2011 Restaurant 
Industry Forecast projects an industry 
sales increase of 3.6 percent over 2010 
sales, which equals 1.1 percent in real 
(inflation-adjusted) terms.
 The nation’s 960,000 restaurants 
will continue to be strong contribu-
tors to the recovery of the nation’s 
economy, with industry sales repre-
senting 4 percent of the U.S. gross 
domestic product and employees 
comprising nearly 10 percent of the 
U.S. workforce. Its total economic 
impact exceeds $1.7 trillion, as every 
dollar spent in restaurants generates 
$2.05 spent in the overall economy. 
Restaurants are the nation’s second-
largest private sector employer with 
12.8 million employees.
“As the national economy is 
slowly improving, the restaurant in-
dustry is climbing out of its most

moves from point A to point B. In this case, 
real GDP increases from Y1 to Y2.
c The expected increase in sales in the 
restaurant industry is expected to result 
in an increase in industry employment dur-
ing 2011. Following job losses in 2008 and 
2009, the industry did experience slight job 
growth in 2010, and employment growth is 
expected to be 2.4 percent in 2011. This 
growth rate outpaces the expected job  
growth rate for the national economy by  
33 percent. The restaurant industry employs 
nearly 10 percent of the nation’s workforce, 
so an increase in job growth in this industry 
can be quite significant for the economy. As 
employment increases, the level of aggre-
gate expenditure should also increase be-
cause the increase in employment will result 
in additional consumer spending in the 
economy. In the figure below, an increase in 
aggregate expenditure from AE1 to AE2, first 
causes the amount of planned aggregate 
 expenditure to be greater than real GDP at 
point A. Firms then respond to the increase 
in sales by increasing production and em-
ployment until the economy reaches equilib-
rium at point B and real GDP eventually 
increases from Y1 to Y2.
Thinking Critically
1. The article states that $1 spent in restau-
rants results in $2.05 spent in the entire 
economy. Suppose the U.S. government 
issues to each citizen $500 in vouchers 
that can only be spent in restaurants. 
How would this program affect aggregate 
expenditure and equilibrium real GDP?
2. Suppose that in an effort to aid the 
economy, the federal government en-
acts a law that prohibits any imported 
food products to be used in restaurants. 
How would this law affect aggregate 
expenditure and equilibrium real GDP 
in the United States? Does your answer 
depend on how the governments of 
other countries react to the law? Briefly 
explain.

at these restaurants will account for almost 
10 percent of the nation’s labor force. The 
association states that the industry has an 
economic effect of more than $1.7 trillion, 
with every dollar spent in restaurants gener-
ating an estimated total of $2.05 in spending 
in the economy.
b Sales in both the quick-service and full-
service segments of the restaurant in-
dustry were expected to grow in 2011. 
Quick-service restaurant sales, a segment 
comprising primarily of fast-food outlets, are 
expected to be $167.7 billion, a 3.3 percent 
increase for the year. Full-service sales, or 
sales at restaurants that offer table service, 
are projected at $194.6 billion, representing 
an increase of 3.1 percent. Consumer pur-
chases of restaurant meals would be 
counted as part of consumption spending. 
The figure below illustrates the effect of an 
increase in real aggregate expenditure on 
real GDP. The economy begins at equilib-
rium at point A, and real GDP is Y1. 
As a result of an increase in consumption 
spending, aggregate expenditure shifts up 
from AE1 to AE2, and the new equilibrium

The National Restaurant Association ex-
pected industry sales to reach $604 bil-
lion in 2011, up 3.6 percent from 2010. 
Both the quick-service and full-service 
segments of the market were expected to 
grow. The strongest growth was expected 
in the South Atlantic region, with an annual 
increase in sales of 3.9 percent and total 
sales exceeding $93 billion. Employment for 
the industry was also expected to increase 
by 2.4 percent in 2011, higher than the 1.8

LEARNING OBJECTIVE: Understand how macroeconomic equilibrium is determined in the aggregate 
expenditure model.
Summary
Aggregate expenditure (AE) is the total amount of spending in 
the economy. The aggregate expenditure model focuses on the 
relationship between total spending and real GDP in the short 
run, assuming that the price level is constant. In any particular 
year, the level of GDP is determined by the level of total spending, 
or  aggregate expenditure, in the economy. The four components 
of  aggregate expenditure are consumption (C), planned invest-
ment (I), government purchases (G), and net exports (NX). When 
 aggregate expenditure is greater than GDP, there is an unplanned 
decrease in inventories, which are goods that have been produced 
but not yet sold, and GDP and total employment will increase. 
When aggregate expenditure is less than GDP, there is an un-
planned increase in inventories, and GDP and total employment 
will decline. When aggregate expenditure is equal to GDP, firms 
will sell what they expected to sell, production and employment 
will be unchanged, and the economy will be in macroeconomic 
equilibrium.

1.7 In the first quarter of 2011, business inventories increased 
by $49.1 billion. Can we tell from this information whether 
aggregate expenditure was higher or lower than GDP dur-

1.8 A survey conducted by the Institute for Supply Management in 
June 2011 showed a significant increase in inventories in man-
ufacturing. An analyst for the investment bank Goldman Sachs 
commented that the increase in inventories was “a negative for 
future activity.” Why might an increase in inventories be con-
sidered bad news for future production in manufacturing?

propensity to save (MPS) is the change in saving divided by the 
change in disposable income. The determinants of planned in-
vestment are expectations of future profitability, real interest rate, 
taxes, and cash flow, which is the difference between the cash 
revenues received by a firm and the cash spending by the firm. 
Government purchases include spending by the federal govern-
ment and by local and state governments for goods and services. 
Government purchases do not include transfer payments, such as 
Social Security payments by the federal government or pension 
payments by local governments to retired police officers and fire-
fighters. The three determinants of net exports are changes in the 
price level in the United States relative to changes in the price lev-
els in other countries, the growth rate of GDP in the United States 
relative to the growth rates of GDP in other countries, and the ex-
change rate between the dollar and other currencies.

Review Questions
 
2.1 In the aggregate expenditure model, why is it important 
to know the factors that determine consumption spend-
ing, investment spending, government purchases, and net 
exports?
 
2.2 Give an example of each of the four categories of aggregate 
expenditure.
 
2.3 What are the five main determinants of consumption 
spending? Which of these is the most important? How 
would a rise in stock prices or housing prices affect con-
sumption spending?
 
2.4 Compare what happened to real investment between 1979 
and the second quarter of 2011 with what happened to real 
consumption during that period.
 
2.5 What are the four main determinants of investment? How 
would a change in interest rates affect investment?
 
2.6 What are the three main determinants of net exports? How 
would an increase in the growth rate of GDP in the BRIC 
 nations (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) affect U.S. net 
exports?
Problems and Applications
 
2.7 [Related to the Chapter Opener on page 749] Suppose 
a major U.S. furniture manufacturer is forecasting demand 
for its products during the next year. How will the forecast 
be affected by each of the following?
 
a. A survey shows a sharp rise in consumer confidence 
that income growth will be increasing
 
b. Real interest rates are expected to increase
 
c. The exchange rate value of the U.S. dollar is expected to 
increase
 
d. Planned investment spending in the economy is 
 expected to decrease
 
2.8 Draw the consumption function and label each axis. 
Show the effect of an increase in income on consumption 
spending. Does the change in income cause a movement 
along the consumption function or a shift of the consump-
tion function? How would an increase in expected future 
income or an increase in household wealth affect the con-
sumption function? Would these increases cause a move-
ment along the consumption function or a shift of the 
consumption function?
 
2.9 Many people have difficulty borrowing as much money as 
they want to, even if they are confident that their incomes 
in the future will be high enough to easily pay back the 
borrowed funds. For example, many students in medi-
cal school will earn high incomes after they graduate and 
become physicians. If they could, they would probably 
borrow now in order to live more comfortably while in 
medical school and pay the loans back out of their higher 
future income. Unfortunately, banks are usually reluctant 
to make loans to people who currently have low incomes, 
even if there is a good chance that their incomes will be 
much higher in the future. If people could always borrow 
as much as they want to, would you expect consumption to 
become more or less sensitive to current income? Briefly 
explain.
 2.10 An economics student raises the following objection: 
“The textbook said that a higher interest rate lowers in-
vestment, but this doesn’t make sense. I know that if I 
can get a higher interest rate, I am certainly going to in-
vest more in my savings account.” Do you agree with this 
reasoning?
 2.11 [Related to the Making the Connection on page 755] 
Writing about the state of the British economy, an article 
in the Economist argued: “Spending will be hit . . . by weak 
stock-markets and shrinking housing wealth.” Would Cal-
omiris, Longhofer, and Miles agree with this argument? 
Would Mian and Sufi? Briefly explain.
Based on “Combating the Recession,” Economist, January 8, 2009.
 2.12 Unemployed workers receive unemployment insurance 
payments from the government. Does the existence of un-
employment insurance make it likely that consumption 
will fluctuate more or fluctuate less over the business cycle 
than it would in the absence of unemployment insurance?

LEARNING OBJECTIVE: Use a 45°-line diagram to illustrate macroeconomic equilibrium.
Summary
The 45°-line diagram shows all the points where aggregate expen-
diture equals real GDP. On the 45°-line diagram, macroeconomic 
equilibrium occurs where the line representing the aggregate 
 expenditure function crosses the 45° line. The economy is in 
 recession when the aggregate expenditure line intersects the 45° 
line at a level of GDP that is below potential GDP. Numerically, 
macroeconomic equilibrium occurs when:
Consumption + Planned investment +
Government purchases + Net exports = GDP.

3.9 Jack Lavery, former chief economist at Merrill Lynch, 
made the following observation about the U.S. economy in 
April 2009: “I expect inventory drawdown to be even more 
pronounced in the second quarter, which will contribute to 
the fourth successive quarterly decline in real GDP.” What 
does Lavery mean by “inventory drawdown”? What com-
ponent of aggregate expenditure would be affected by an 
inventory drawdown? Why would this contribute to GDP 
decline?

Summary
Autonomous expenditure is expenditure that does not depend 
on the level of GDP. An autonomous change is a change in ex-
penditure not caused by a change in income. An induced change 
is a change in aggregate expenditure caused by a change in in-
come. An autonomous change in expenditure will cause rounds 
of induced changes in expenditure. Therefore, an autonomous 
change in expenditure will have a multiplier effect on equilibrium 
GDP. The multiplier effect is the process by which an increase 
in autonomous expenditure leads to a larger increase in real 
GDP. The multiplier is the ratio of the change in equilibrium 
GDP to the change in autonomous expenditure. The formula for 
the multiplier is

Because of the paradox of thrift, an attempt by many individuals 
to increase their saving may lead to a reduction in aggregate ex-
penditure and a recession.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE: Understand the relationship between the aggregate demand curve and aggregate 
expenditure.
Summary
Increases in the price level cause a reduction in consumption, 
investment, and net exports. This causes the aggregate expendi-
ture function to shift down on the 45°-line diagram, leading to a 
lower equilibrium real GDP. A decrease in the price level leads to a 
higher equilibrium real GDP. The aggregate demand curve shows 
the relationship between the price level and the level of aggregate 
expenditure, holding constant all factors other than the price level 
that affect aggregate expenditure.

ture are affected by a change in the price level.

5.4 Briefly explain why the aggregate expenditure line is up-
ward sloping, while the aggregate demand curve is down-
ward sloping.
 
5.5 Briefly explain whether you agree with the following state-
ment: “The reason the aggregate demand curve slopes 
downward is that when the price level is higher, people 
cannot afford to buy as many goods and services.”
 
5.6 Suppose that exports become more sensitive to changes in 
the price level in the United States. That is, when the price 
level in the United States rises, exports decline by more 
than they previously did. Will this change make the aggre-
gate demand curve steeper or less steep? Briefly explain.

Appendix
The Algebra of Macroeconomic 
Equilibrium
In this chapter, we relied primarily on graphs and tables to illustrate the aggregate 
 expenditure model of short-run real GDP. Graphs help us understand economic change 
qualitatively. When we write an economic model using equations, we make it easier 
to make quantitative estimates. When economists forecast future movements in GDP, 
they often rely on econometric models. An econometric model is an economic model 
 written in the form of equations, where each equation has been statistically estimated, 
using methods similar to the methods used in estimating demand curves that we briefly 
described in Chapter 3. We can use equations to represent the aggregate expenditure 
model described in this chapter.
The following equations are based on the example shown in Table 23.3 on page 770. 
Y stands for real GDP, and the numbers (with the exception of the MPC) represent bil-
lions of dollars.
 1. C = 1,000 + 0.65 Y 
Consumption function
 2. I = 1,500 
Planned investment function
 3. G = 1,500 
Government spending function
 4. NX = -500 
Net export function
 5. Y = C + I + G + NX 
Equilibrium condition
The first equation is the consumption function. The MPC is 0.65, and 1,000 is au-
tonomous consumption, which is the level of consumption that does not depend on 
income. If we think of the consumption function as a line on the 45°-line diagram, 1,000 
would be the intercept, and 0.65 would be the slope. The “functions” for the other three 
components of planned aggregate expenditure are very simple because we have assumed 
that these components are not affected by GDP and, therefore, are constant. Economists 
who use this type of model to forecast GDP would, of course, use more realistic invest-
ment, government, and net export functions. The parameters of the functions—such as 
the value of autonomous consumption and the value of the MPC in the consumption 
function—would be estimated statistically, using data on the values of each variable over 
a period of years.
In this model, GDP is in equilibrium when it equals planned aggregate expenditure. 
Equation 5—the equilibrium condition—shows us how to calculate equilibrium in the 
model: We need to substitute equations 1 through 4 into equation 5. Doing so gives us 
the following:
Y = 1,000 + 0.65Y + 1,500 + 1,500 - 500.
We need to solve this expression for Y to find equilibrium GDP. The first step is to 
subtract 0.65Y from both sides of the equation:
Y - 0.65Y = 1,000 + 1,500 + 1,500 - 500.
Then, we solve for Y:
0.35Y = 3,500.
Or:
Y = 3,500
0.35 = 10,000.

To make this result more general, we can replace particular values with general 
 values represented by letters:
 1. C = C + MPC1Y2 
Consumption function
 2. I = I 
Planned investment function
 3. G = G 
Government spending function
 4. NX = NX 
Net export function
 5. Y = C + I + G + NX 
Equilibrium condition
The letters with bars over them represent fixed, or autonomous, values. So, for ex-
ample, C represents autonomous consumption, which had a value of 1,000 in our origi-
nal example. Now, solving for equilibrium, we get
Y = C + MPC(Y) + I + G + NX,
or
Y - MPC(Y) = C + I + G + NX,
or
Y(1 - MPC) = C + I + G + NX,
or
Y = C + I + G + NX
1 - MPC
.
Remember that 1>(1 - MPC) is the multiplier, and all four variables in the 
 numerator of the equation represent autonomous expenditure. Therefore, an alternative 
expression for equilibrium GDP is:
Equilibrium GDP = Autonomous expenditure * Multiplier.

Economics in Your Life
Is an Employer Likely to Cut Your Pay during a Recession?
Suppose that you have worked as a barista for a local coffeehouse for two years. From on-the-job 
training and experience, you have honed your coffee-making skills and mastered the perfect latte. 
Then the economy moves into a recession, and sales at the coffeehouse decline. Is the owner of the 
coffeehouse likely to cut the prices of lattes and other drinks? Suppose the owner asks to meet with 
you to discuss your wages for next year. Is the owner likely to cut your pay? As you read the chap-
ter, see if you can answer these questions. You can check your answers against those we provide on

imposing a 5 to 20 percent pay cut on its 
remaining employees. By September 2009, 
economic conditions had begun to improve, 
and FedEx announced that its profits for the 
three months ending on August 31 were 35 
percent higher than its executives had ex-
pected. But as U.S. GDP growth slowed in 
2011, so did FedEx’s fortunes. Weak con-
sumer demand and half-empty cargo planes 
led FedEx to announce in September that it 
was lowering its forecast for end-of-the-year 
profits. Fred Smith explained: “We expect 
sluggish economic growth will continue. . . . 
The consumer just doesn’t have an appetite” 
for increased spending.
To understand how the business cycle 
affects FedEx and other firms, we need to 
explore the effects that recessions and ex-
pansions have on production, employment, 
and prices.
AN INSIDE LOOK on page 818 dis-
cusses why a slowdown in cargo shipments 
signals problems in the wider economy.
Based on Lynn Adler, “FedEx Pares 2012 Outlook, 
Shares Hit 2-Year Low,” Reuters, September 22, 2011; 
Hal Weiztman, “FedEx to Cut Costs by $1 Bn,” Financial 
Times, March 19, 2009; “FedEx Confirms 1,000 Layoffs, 
500 in Memphis,” Memphis Business Journal, April 3, 
2009; Bob Sechler, “FedEx Boosts Outlook,” Wall Street 
Journal,  September 11, 2009; and David Gaffen, “The 
FedEx Indicator,” Wall Street Journal, February 20, 2007.
FedEx plays a large role in moving pack-
ages around the United States and around 
the world. The value of packages handled by 
 FedEx is about 4 percent of U.S. GDP and 
1.5 percent of global GDP. Some Wall Street 
analysts use a “FedEx indicator” to gauge the 
state of the economy because there is usually 
a close relationship between fluctuations in 
FedEx’s business and fluctuations in GDP.
Fred Smith came up with the idea for the 
company in 1965, in an undergraduate term 
paper. He proposed an entirely new system 
of delivering packages: One firm would con-
trol shipping freight, from pickup to delivery. 
The firm would operate its own planes on a 
“hub-and-spoke” system: Packages would be 
collected and flown to a central hub, where 
they would be sorted and then flown to their 
destination for final delivery by truck.
Despite FedEx’s tremendous success 
over the past 40 years, the business cycle has 
always affected the company’s business. For 
example, as the U.S. entered a recession in 
December 2007, businesses and individu-
als cut back on shipping packages. In the 
first quarter of 2008, FedEx reported its 
first loss, after 11 straight years of  profits. 
As the 2007–2009 recession dragged on, 
FedEx announced in March 2009 that it

e saw in Chapter 21 that the U.S. economy has experienced a long-run 
upward trend in real GDP. This upward trend has resulted in the standard 
of living in the United States being much higher today than it was 50 years 
ago. In the short run, however, real GDP fluctuates around this long-run 
upward trend because of the business cycle. Fluctuations in GDP lead to fluctuations in em-
ployment. These fluctuations in real GDP and employment are the most visible and dra-
matic part of the business cycle. During recessions, we are more likely to see factories close, 
small businesses declare bankruptcy, and workers lose their jobs. During expansions, we are 
more likely to see new businesses open and new jobs created. In addition to these changes in 
output and employment, the business cycle causes changes in wages and prices. Some firms 
react to a decline in sales by cutting back on production, but they may also cut the prices 
they charge and the wages they pay. Other firms respond to a recession by raising prices and 
workers’ wages by less than they otherwise would have.
In this chapter, we expand our story of the business cycle by developing the aggregate 
demand and aggregate supply model. This model will help us analyze the effects of reces-
sions and expansions on production, employment, and prices.
Aggregate Demand
To understand what happens during the business cycle, we need an explanation of why real 
GDP, the unemployment rate, and the inflation rate fluctuate. We have already seen that 
fluctuations in the unemployment rate are caused mainly by fluctuations in real GDP. In 
this chapter, we use the aggregate demand and aggregate supply model to explain short-
run fluctuations in real GDP and the price level. As Figure 24.1 shows, real GDP and the 
price level in this model are determined in the short run by the intersection of the aggre-
gate demand curve and the aggregate supply curve. Fluctuations in real GDP and the price 
level are caused by shifts in the aggregate demand curve or in the aggregate supply curve.
The aggregate demand (AD) curve shows the relationship between the price level 
and the quantity of real GDP demanded by households, firms, and the government. The 
short-run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve shows the relationship in the short run be-
tween the price level and the quantity of real GDP supplied by firms. The  aggregate de-
mand and short-run aggregate supply curves in Figure 24.1 look similar to the individual 
market demand and supply curves we studied in Chapter 3. However,  because these 
curves apply to the whole economy, rather than to just a single market, the  aggregate de-
mand and aggregate supply model is very different from the model of demand and sup-
ply in individual markets. Because we are dealing with the economy as a whole, we need

Aggregate Demand

macroeconomic explanations of why the aggregate demand curve is downward sloping, 
why the short-run aggregate supply curve is upward sloping, and why the curves shift. 
We begin by explaining why the aggregate demand curve is  downward sloping.
Why Is the Aggregate Demand Curve  
Downward Sloping?
We saw in Chapter 19 that GDP has four components: consumption (C), investment (I), 
government purchases (G), and net exports (NX). If we let Y stand for GDP, we have the 
following relationship:
Y = C + I + G + NX.
The aggregate demand curve is downward sloping because a fall in the price level in-
creases the quantity of real GDP demanded. To understand why this is true, we need 
to look at how changes in the price level affect each component of aggregate demand. 
We begin with the assumption that government purchases are determined by the policy 
decisions of lawmakers and are not affected by changes in the price level. We can then 
consider the effect of changes in the price level on the three other components: con-
sumption, investment, and net exports.
The Wealth Effect: How a Change in the Price Level Affects Consumption 
Current income is the most important variable determining the consumption of house-
holds. As income rises, consumption will rise, and as income falls, consumption will fall. 
But consumption also depends on household wealth. A household’s wealth is the differ-
ence between the value of its assets and the value of its debts. Consider two households, 
both with incomes of $80,000 per year. The first household has wealth of $5 million, and 
the second household has wealth of $50,000. The first household is likely to spend more 
of its income than the second household. So, as total household wealth rises, consumption 
will rise. Some household wealth is held in cash or other nominal assets that lose value as 
the price level rises and gain value as the price level falls. For instance, if you have $10,000 
in cash, a 10 percent increase in the price level will reduce the purchasing power of that 
cash by 10 percent. When the price level rises, the real value of household wealth declines, 
and so will consumption, thereby reducing the demand for goods and services. When the 
price level falls, the real value of household wealth rises, and so will consumption and the 
demand for goods and services. This effect of the price level on consumption is called  
the wealth effect, and it is one reason the aggregate demand curve is downward sloping.
The Interest-Rate Effect: How a Change in the Price Level Affects 
Investment When prices rise, households and firms need more money to finance buy-
ing and selling. Therefore, when the price level rises, households and firms will try to in-
crease the amount of money they hold by withdrawing funds from banks, borrowing from 
banks, or selling financial assets, such as bonds. These actions tend to drive up the interest 
rate charged on bank loans and the interest rate on bonds. (In Chapter 26, we analyze in 
more detail the relationship between money and interest rates.) A higher interest rate raises 
the cost of borrowing for firms and households. As a result, firms will borrow less to build 
new factories or to install new machinery and equipment, and households will borrow less 
to buy new houses. To a smaller extent, consumption will also fall as households borrow 
less to finance spending on automobiles, furniture, and other durable goods. So, because 
a higher price level increases the interest rate and reduces investment spending, it also re-
duces the quantity of goods and services demanded. A lower price level will  decrease the in-
terest rate and increase investment spending, thereby increasing the quantity of goods and 
services demanded. This effect of the price level on investment is known as the  interest-rate 
effect, and it is a second reason the aggregate demand curve is downward sloping.
The International-Trade Effect: How a Change in the Price Level Affects 
Net Exports Net exports equal spending by foreign households and firms on goods 
and services produced in the United States minus spending by U.S. households and 

796 
C H A P T E R  2 4  Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply Analysis
firms on goods and services produced in other countries. If the price level in the United 
States rises relative to the price levels in other countries, U.S. exports will become rela-
tively more expensive, and foreign imports will become relatively less expensive. Some 
consumers in foreign countries will shift from buying U.S. products to buying domestic 
products, and some U.S. consumers will also shift from buying U.S. products to buying 
imported products. U.S. exports will fall, and U.S. imports will rise, causing net exports 
to fall, thereby reducing the quantity of goods and services demanded. A lower price 
level in the United States relative to other countries has the reverse effect, causing net 
exports to rise, increasing the quantity of goods and services demanded. This effect of 
the price level on net exports is known as the international-trade effect, and it is a third 
reason the aggregate demand curve is downward sloping.
Shifts of the Aggregate Demand Curve  
versus Movements along It
An important point to remember is that the aggregate demand curve tells us the re-
lationship between the price level and the quantity of real GDP demanded, holding 
everything else constant. If the price level changes but other variables that affect the will-
ingness of households, firms, and the government to spend are unchanged, the economy 
will move up or down a stationary aggregate demand curve. If any variable other than 
the price level changes, the aggregate demand curve will shift. For example, if govern-
ment purchases increase and the price level remains unchanged, the aggregate demand 
curve will shift to the right at every price level. Or, if firms become pessimistic about the 
future profitability of investment and cut back spending on factories and machinery, the 
aggregate demand curve will shift to the left.
The Variables That Shift the Aggregate  
Demand Curve
The variables that cause the aggregate demand curve to shift fall into three categories:
• 
Changes in government policies
• 
Changes in the expectations of households and firms
• 
Changes in foreign variables
Changes in Government Policies As we will discuss further in Chapters 26 
and 27, the federal government uses monetary policy and fiscal policy to shift the aggre-
gate demand curve. Monetary policy involves actions the Federal Reserve—the  nation’s 
central bank—takes to manage the money supply and interest rates and to ensure the 
flow of funds from lenders to borrowers. The Federal Reserve takes these actions to 
attain macroeconomic policy objectives, such as high employment, price stability, and 
high rates of economic growth. For example, by lowering interest rates, the Federal 
 Reserve can lower the cost to firms and households of borrowing. Lowering borrow-
ing costs increases consumption and investment spending, which shifts the aggregate 
demand curve to the right. Higher interest rates shift the aggregate demand curve to the 
left. Fiscal policy involves changes in federal taxes and purchases that are intended to 
achieve macroeconomic policy objectives. Because government purchases are one com-
ponent of aggregate demand, an increase in government purchases shifts the  aggregate 
demand curve to the right, and a decrease in government purchases shifts the aggregate 
demand curve to the left. An increase in personal income taxes reduces the amount of 
spendable income available to households. Higher personal income taxes reduce con-
sumption spending and shift the aggregate demand curve to the left. Lower personal 
income taxes shift the aggregate demand curve to the right. Increases in business taxes 
reduce the profitability of investment spending and shift the aggregate  demand curve to 
the left. Decreases in business taxes shift the aggregate demand curve to the right.
Changes in the Expectations of Households and Firms If households  become 
more optimistic about their future incomes, they are likely to increase their current

consumption. This increased consumption will shift the aggregate demand curve to the 
right. If households become more pessimistic about their future incomes, the aggregate de-
mand curve will shift to the left. Similarly, if firms become more optimistic about the future 
profitability of investment spending, the aggregate demand curve will shift to the right. If 
firms become more pessimistic, the aggregate demand curve will shift to the left.
Changes in Foreign Variables If firms and households in other countries buy 
fewer U.S. goods or if firms and households in the United States buy more foreign goods, 
net exports will fall, and the aggregate demand curve will shift to the left. As we saw in 
 Chapter 19, when real GDP increases, so does the income available for consumers to 
spend. If real GDP in the United States increases faster than real GDP in other countries, 
U.S. imports will increase faster than U.S. exports, and net exports will fall. Net exports 
will also fall if the exchange rate between the dollar and foreign currencies rises because 
the price in foreign currency of U.S. products sold in other countries will rise, and the dol-
lar price of foreign products sold in the United States will fall. For example, if the current 
exchange rate between the dollar and the euro is $1 5 €1 then a $500 iPad exported from 
the United States to France will cost €500 in France, and a €50  bottle of French wine will 
cost $50 in the United States. But if the exchange rate rises to $1 5 €1.50, the iPad’s price 
will rise to €750 in France, causing its sales to decline, and the price of the French wine will 
fall to $33.33 per bottle in the United States, causing its sales to increase. U.S.  exports will 
fall, U.S. imports will rise, and the aggregate demand curve will shift to the left.
An increase in net exports at every price level will shift the aggregate demand curve 
to the right. Net exports will increase if real GDP grows more slowly in the United States 
than in other countries or if the value of the dollar falls against other currencies. A change 
in net exports that results from a change in the price level in the United States will result in 
a movement along the aggregate demand curve, not a shift of the aggregate demand curve.
Understand Why the Aggregate Demand 
Curve Is Downward Sloping
The aggregate demand curve and the demand curve for a 
single product are both downward sloping—but for differ-
ent reasons. When we draw a demand curve for a single 
product, such as apples, we know that it will slope down-
ward because as the price of apples rises, apples become 
more expensive relative to other products—such as or-
anges—and consumers will buy fewer apples and more of 
the other products. In other words, consumers substitute 
other products for apples. When the overall price level 
rises, the prices of all domestically produced goods and 
services are rising, so consumers have no other domestic 
products to which they can switch. The aggregate demand 
curve slopes downward for the reasons given on pages 
795–796: A lower price level raises the real value of house-
hold wealth (which increases consumption), lowers inter-
est rates (which increases investment and consumption), 
and makes U.S. exports less expensive and foreign imports 
more expensive (which increases net exports).

Solving the Problem
Step 1: Review the chapter material. This problem is about understanding the dif-
ference between movements along an aggregate demand curve and shifts of 
an aggregate demand curve, so you may want to review the section “Shifts of 
the Aggregate Demand Curve versus Movements along It,” on page 796.
Step 2: To answer part a. draw a graph that shows a movement along the aggregate 
demand curve. Because there will be a movement along the aggregate demand 
curve but no shift of the aggregate demand curve, your graph should look like this:

$14.0
Price level
(GDP deflator,

We don’t have enough information to be certain what the new level of real 
GDP demanded will be. We only know that it will be less than the initial level 
of $14.2 trillion; the graph shows the value as $14.0 trillion.
Step 3: To answer part b. draw a graph that shows a shift of the aggregate demand curve. 
We know that the aggregate demand curve will shift to the left, but we don’t have 
enough information to know how far to the left it will shift. Let’s assume that the 
shift is $300 billion (or $0.3 trillion). In that case, your graph should look like this:
 
The graph shows a parallel shift in the aggregate demand curve so that at 
 every price level, the quantity of real GDP demanded declines by $300 bil-
lion. For example, at a price level of 110, the quantity of real GDP demanded 
declines from $14.2 trillion to $13.9 trillion.

Which Components of Aggregate 
Demand Changed the Most during 
the 2007–2009 Recession?
The recession of 2007–2009 was the longest and most severe since 
the Great Depression of the 1930s. We can gain some insight into the reasons for the length 
and severity of the 2007–2009 recession by looking at changes over time in the components of 
aggregate demand. In the graphs below, we show changes in three components of aggregate 
demand that showed the largest movements between the first quarter of 2005 and the second 
quarter of 2011: consumption, spending on residential construction, and net exports. The  
red bars represent the 2007–2009 recession. We know that potential GDP, or the level of GDP  
when all firms are producing at capacity, grows over time. So, economists are often inter-
ested in measuring changes in the components of aggregate demand relative to potential GDP, 
which is what we have done in these graphs.

The graphs on the previous page illustrate a number of facts about the 2007–2009 
recession:
• 
In the two years before the beginning of the recession, spending on residential 
 construction had already declined significantly relative to potential GDP.
• 
For more than two years following the end of the recession, spending on residential 
construction did not increase relative to potential GDP.
• 
Consumption, which usually remains relatively stable during a recession, declined 
significantly relative to potential GDP during the recession and remained low for 
more than two years after the recession had ended.
• 
Net exports increased during the recession. (Because net exports was negative 
throughout this period, it increased by becoming a smaller negative number.)
Although not shown in the graphs, business fixed investment and changes in business 
inventories—the nonresidential construction components of investment spending— 
actually rose relative to potential GDP during the recession. Government purchases re-
mained fairly stable relative to potential GDP throughout the recession, before declining 
in late 2010 and the first half of 2011. Federal government purchases surged during the 
recession, but state and local governments reduced their spending as falling household 
incomes and falling business profits reduced state and local tax revenues.
We can briefly account for these facts. The housing sector underwent a boom from 
2002 to 2005, with rapid increases in both housing prices and spending on new hous-
ing. The housing boom, though, turned into a housing bust beginning in 2006, which 
explains the sharp decline in spending on residential construction. The continued low 
levels of spending on residential construction help explain why the recession was the 
longest since the Great Depression and why the economic expansion that began in 
June 2009 was relatively weak. As one newspaper article noted in late 2011: “ Americans 
aren’t spending because their home values are declining and employment prospects are 
dimming, and housing and employment is struggling because Americans won’t spend.”
High levels of unemployment reduced household incomes and led to declines in con-
sumption spending. In addition, many households increased their saving and paid off 
debts, further reducing consumption spending. The continuing low levels of consump-
tion spending also contributed to the severity of the recession and the weakness of the 
following expansion. Finally, efforts by the Federal Reserve to reduce  interest rates helped 
to lower the value of the U.S. dollar, thereby reducing the prices of U.S.  exports and in-
creasing the prices of foreign imports. The result was an increase in net  exports. (We will 
discuss further the effect of Federal Reserve policy on net exports in Chapters 26 and 29.)

Aggregate Supply
The aggregate demand curve is one component of the aggregate demand and aggregate sup-
ply model. Now we turn to aggregate supply, which shows the effect of changes in the price 
level on the quantity of goods and services that firms are willing and able to supply. Because 
the effect of changes in the price level on aggregate supply is very different in the short run 
from what it is in the long run, we use two aggregate supply curves: one for the short run 
and one for the long run. We start by considering the long-run  aggregate supply curve.
The Long-Run Aggregate Supply Curve
In Chapter 22, we saw that in the long run, the level of real GDP is determined by the 
number of workers, the capital stock—including factories, office buildings, and machin-
ery and equipment—and the available technology. Because changes in the price level

do not affect the number of workers, the capital stock, or technology, in the long run, 
changes in the price level do not affect the level of real GDP. Remember that the level of 
real GDP in the long run is called potential GDP, or full-employment GDP. At potential 
GDP, firms will operate at their normal level of capacity, and everyone who wants a job 
will have one, except the structurally and frictionally unemployed. There is no reason 
for this normal level of capacity to change just because the price level has changed. The 
long-run aggregate supply (LRAS) curve shows the relationship in the long run be-
tween the price level and the quantity of real GDP supplied. As Figure 24.2 shows, in 
2011, the price level was 113, and potential real GDP was $14.3 trillion. If the price level 
had been 123, or if it had been 103, long-run aggregate supply would still have been a 
constant $14.3 trillion. Therefore, the LRAS curve is a vertical line.
Figure 24.2 also shows that the long-run aggregate supply curve shifts to the 
right each year. This shift occurs because potential real GDP increases each year, as 
the number of workers in the economy increases, the economy accumulates more ma-
chinery and equipment, and technological change occurs. Figure 24.2 shows potential 
real GDP increasing from $14.3 trillion in 2011 to $14.6 trillion in 2012 and to $14.9 
 trillion in 2013.
The Short-Run Aggregate Supply Curve
While the LRAS curve is vertical, the SRAS curve is upward sloping. The SRAS curve 
is upward sloping because, over the short run, as the price level increases, the quantity 
of goods and services firms are willing to supply will increase. The main reason firms 
behave this way is that, as prices of final goods and services rise, prices of inputs—such as 
the wages of workers or the price of natural resources—rise more slowly. Profits rise when 
the prices of the goods and services firms sell rise more rapidly than the prices they pay 
for inputs. Therefore, a higher price level leads to higher profits and increases the will-
ingness of firms to supply more goods and services. A secondary reason the SRAS curve 
slopes upward is that, as the price level rises or falls, some firms are slow to adjust their 
prices. A firm that is slow to raise its prices when the price level is increasing may find 
its sales increasing and, therefore, will increase production. A firm that is slow to reduce 
its prices when the price level is decreasing may find its sales falling and, therefore, will 
decrease production.
Why do some firms adjust prices more slowly than others, and why might the 
wages of workers and the prices of other inputs change more slowly than the prices of 
final goods and services? Most economists believe the explanation is that some firms 
and workers fail to accurately predict changes in the price level. If firms and workers could 
predict the future price level exactly, the short-run aggregate supply curve would be the 
same as the long-run aggregate supply curve.

curve A curve that shows the 
relationship in the long run between 
the price level and the quantity of real 
GDP supplied.
Figure 24.2 
The Long-Run Aggregate 
Supply Curve
Changes in the price level do not affect the 
level of aggregate supply in the long run. 
Therefore, the long-run aggregate supply 
(LRAS) curve is a vertical line at the poten-
tial level of real GDP. For instance, the price 
level was 113 in 2011, and potential real 
GDP was $14.3 trillion. If the price level 
had been 123, or if it had been 103, long-
run aggregate supply would still have been 
a constant $14.3 trillion. Each year, the 
long-run aggregate supply curve shifts to 
the right, as the number of workers in the 
economy increases, more machinery and 
equipment are accumulated, and techno-
logical change occurs.

But how does the failure of workers and firms to predict the price level accurately 
result in an upward-sloping SRAS curve? Economists are not in complete agreement on 
this point, but we can briefly discuss the three most common explanations:
 1. Contracts make some wages and prices “sticky.”
 2. Firms are often slow to adjust wages.
 3. Menu costs make some prices sticky.
Contracts Make Some Wages and Prices “Sticky” Prices or wages are said to 
be “sticky” when they do not respond quickly to changes in demand or supply. Contracts 
can make wages or prices sticky. For example, suppose United Parcel Service (UPS) ne-
gotiates a three-year contract with the Independent Pilots Association, the union for the 
pilots who fly the company’s cargo planes, during a time when the economy is in reces-
sion and the volume of packages being shipped is falling. Suppose that after the union 
signs the contract, the economy begins to expand rapidly, and the volume of packages 
shipped increases, so that UPS can raise the rates it charges. UPS will find that shipping 
more packages will be profitable because the prices it charges are rising, while the wages 
it pays its pilots are fixed by contract. Or a steel mill might have signed a multiyear con-
tract to buy coal, which is used in making steel, at a time when the demand for steel was 
stagnant. If steel demand and steel prices begin to rise rapidly, producing additional steel 
will be profitable because coal prices will remain fixed by contract. In both of these cases, 
rising prices lead to higher output. If these examples are representative of enough firms 
in the economy, a rising price level should lead to a greater quantity of goods and services 
supplied. In other words, the short-run aggregate supply curve will be upward sloping.
Notice, though, that if the pilots at UPS or the managers of the coal companies had 
accurately predicted what would happen to prices, this prediction would have been 
 reflected in the contracts, and UPS and the steel mill would not have earned greater 
profits when prices rose. In that case, rising prices would not have led to higher output.
Firms Are Often Slow to Adjust Wages We just noted that the wages of many 
union workers remain fixed by contract for several years. Many nonunion workers also 
have their wages or salaries adjusted only once a year. For instance, suppose you accept 
a job at a management consulting firm in June, at a salary of $45,000 per year. The firm 
probably will not adjust your salary until the following June, even if the prices it can 
charge for its services later in the year are higher or lower than the firm had expected 
them to be when they hired you. If firms are slow to adjust wages, a rise in the price 
level will increase the profitability of hiring more workers and producing more output. A 
fall in the price level will decrease the profitability of hiring more workers and produc-
ing more output. Once again, we have an explanation for why the short-run  aggregate 
 supply curve slopes upward.
It is worth noting that firms are often slower to cut wages than to increase them. 
Cutting wages can have a negative effect on the morale and productivity of workers and 
can also cause some of a firm’s best workers to quit and look for jobs elsewhere.
Menu Costs Make Some Prices Sticky Firms base their prices today partly on 
what they expect future prices to be. For instance, before it prints menus, a restaurant 
has to decide the prices it will charge for meals. Many firms print catalogs that list 
the prices of their products. If demand for their products is higher or lower than the 
firms had expected, they may want to charge prices that are different from the ones 
printed in their menus or catalogs. Changing prices would be costly, however, because 
it would involve printing new menus or catalogs. The costs to firms of changing prices 
are called menu costs. To see why menu costs can lead to an upward-sloping short-run 
aggregate supply curve, consider the effect of an unexpected increase in the price level. 
In this case, firms will want to increase the prices they charge. Some firms, however, 
may not be willing to increase prices because of menu costs. Because of their relatively 
low prices, these firms will find their sales increasing, which will cause them to increase 
output. Once again, we have an explanation for a higher price level leading to a larger 
quantity of goods and services supplied.
Menu costs The costs to firms of 
changing prices.

Shifts of the Short-Run Aggregate Supply Curve 
versus Movements along It
It is important to remember the difference between a shift in a curve and a movement 
along a curve. The short-run aggregate supply curve tells us the short-run relationship 
between the price level and the quantity of goods and services firms are willing to sup-
ply, holding constant all other variables that affect the willingness of firms to supply goods 
and services. If the price level changes but other variables are unchanged, the economy 
will move up or down a stationary aggregate supply curve. If any variable other than the 
price level changes, the aggregate supply curve will shift.
Variables That Shift the Short-Run Aggregate  
Supply Curve
We now briefly discuss the five most important variables that cause the short-run 
 aggregate supply curve to shift.
Increases in the Labor Force and in the Capital Stock A firm will supply 
more output at every price if it has more workers and more physical capital. The same is 
true of the economy as a whole. So, as the labor force and the capital stock grow, firms 
will supply more output at every price level, and the short-run aggregate supply curve 
will shift to the right. In Japan, the population is aging, and the labor force is decreasing. 
Holding other variables constant, this decrease in the labor force causes the short-run 
aggregate supply curve in Japan to shift to the left.
Technological Change As positive technological change takes place, the productiv-
ity of workers and machinery increases, which means firms can produce more goods and 
services with the same amount of labor and machinery. This increase in productivity re-
duces the firms’ costs of production and, therefore, allows them to produce more output 
at every price level. As a result, the short-run aggregate supply curve shifts to the right.
Expected Changes in the Future Price Level If workers and firms believe that 
the price level is going to increase by 3 percent during the next year, they will try to ad-
just their wages and prices accordingly. For instance, if a labor union believes there will 
be 3 percent inflation next year, it knows that wages must rise 3 percent to preserve the 
purchasing power of those wages. Similar adjustments by other workers and firms will 
result in costs increasing throughout the economy by 3 percent. The result, shown in 
Figure 24.3, is that the short-run aggregate supply curve will shift to the left, so that any

1.  If workers and firms expect that the

from 100 to 103, they will adjust 
their wages and prices by that 
amount.
 
2.  Holding constant all other variables 
that affect aggregate supply, the 
short-run aggregate supply curve 
will shift to the left.
If workers and firms expect that the price 
level will be lower in the future, the short-run

level of real GDP is now associated with a price level that is 3 percent higher. In general, 
if workers and firms expect the price level to increase by a certain percentage, the SRAS 
curve will shift by an equivalent amount, holding constant all other variables that affect 
the SRAS curve.
Adjustments of Workers and Firms to Errors in Past Expectations about 
the Price Level Workers and firms sometimes make incorrect predictions about the 
price level. As time passes, they will attempt to compensate for these errors. Suppose, for 
example, that the Independent Pilots Association signs a contract with UPS that pro-
vides for only small wage increases because the company and the union both expect 
only small increases in the price level. If increases in the price level turn out to be unex-
pectedly large, the union will take this into account when negotiating the next contract. 
The higher wages UPS pilots receive under the new contract will increase UPS’s costs 
and result in UPS needing to receive higher prices to produce the same level of output. 
If workers and firms across the economy are adjusting to the price level being higher 
than expected, the SRAS curve will shift to the left. If they are adjusting to the price level 
being lower than expected, the SRAS curve will shift to the right.
Unexpected Changes in the Price of an Important Natural Resource An 
unexpected event that causes the short-run aggregate supply curve to shift is known as 
a supply shock. Supply shocks are often caused by unexpected increases or decreases 
in the prices of important natural resources that can cause firms’ costs to be different 
from what they had expected. Oil prices can be particularly volatile. Some firms use 
oil in the production process. Other firms use products, such as plastics, that are made 
from oil. If oil prices rise unexpectedly, the costs of production will rise for these firms. 
Some utilities also burn oil to generate electricity, so electricity prices will rise. Rising oil 
prices lead to rising gasoline prices, which raise transportation costs for many firms. Be-
cause firms face rising costs, they will supply the same level of output only if they receive 
higher prices, and the short-run aggregate  supply curve will shift to the left.
Because the U.S. economy has experienced at least some inflation every year since 
the 1930s, workers and firms always expect next year’s price level to be higher than this 
year’s price level. Holding everything else constant, expectations of a higher price level 
will cause the SRAS curve to shift to the left. But everything else is not constant because 
every year, the U.S. labor force and the U.S. capital stock expand, and changes in tech-
nology occur, which cause the SRAS curve to shift to the right. Whether in any particu-
lar year the SRAS curve shifts to the left or to the right depends on how large an impact 
these variables have during that year.
Table 24.2 summarizes the most important variables that cause the SRAS curve to 
shift. The table shows the shift in the SRAS curve that results from an increase in each 
of the variables. A decrease in these variables would cause the SRAS curve to shift in the 
opposite direction.
Macroeconomic Equilibrium in the Long 
Run and the Short Run
Now that we have discussed the components of the aggregate demand and aggre-
gate supply model, we can use it to analyze changes in real GDP and the price level. In  
Figure 24.4, we bring the aggregate demand curve, the short-run aggregate supply curve, 
and the long-run aggregate supply curve together in one graph, to show the long-run mac-
roeconomic equilibrium for the economy. In the figure, equilibrium occurs at real GDP 
of $14.0 trillion and a price level of 100. Notice that in long-run equilibrium, the short-
run aggregate supply curve and the aggregate demand curve intersect at a point on the 
long-run aggregate supply curve. Because equilibrium occurs at a point along the long-
run aggregate supply curve, we know the economy is at potential real GDP: Firms will be

operating at their normal level of capacity, and everyone who wants a job will have one, 
except the structurally and frictionally unemployed. We know, however, that the economy 
is often not in long-run macroeconomic equilibrium. In the following section, we discuss 
the economic forces that can push the economy away from long-run equilibrium.
Recessions, Expansions, and Supply Shocks
Because the full analysis of the aggregate demand and aggregate supply model can be 
complicated, we begin with a simplified case, using two assumptions:
 1. The economy has not been experiencing any inflation. The price level is currently 
100, and workers and firms expect it to remain at 100 in the future.
 2. The economy is not experiencing any long-run growth. Potential real GDP is $14.0 
trillion and will remain at that level in the future.
These assumptions are simplifications because in reality, the U.S. economy has ex-
perienced at least some inflation every year since the 1930s, and the potential real GDP 
also increases every year. However, the assumptions allow us to understand more easily 
the key ideas of the aggregate demand and aggregate supply model. In this section, we 
examine the short-run and long-run effects of recessions, expansions, and supply shocks.
Recession
The Short-Run Effect of a Decline in Aggregate Demand Suppose that 
rising interest rates cause firms to reduce spending on factories and equipment and 
cause households to reduce spending on new homes. The decline in investment that 
results will shift the aggregate demand curve to the left, from AD1 to AD2, as shown 
in Figure 24.5. The economy moves from point A to a new short-run macroeconomic 
equilibrium, where the AD2 curve intersects the SRAS1 curve at point B. In the new 
short-run equilibrium, real GDP has declined from $14.0 trillion to $13.8 trillion and 
is below its potential level. This lower level of GDP will result in declining profitability 
for many firms and layoffs for some workers: the economy will be in recession.
Adjustment Back to Potential GDP in the Long Run We know that a recession 
will eventually end because there are forces at work that push the economy back to po-
tential GDP in the long run. Figure 24.5 shows how the economy moves from recession 
back to potential GDP. The shift from AD1 to AD2 initially leads to a short-run equilib-
rium, with the price level having fallen from 100 to 98 (point B). Workers and firms will

begin to adjust to the price level being lower than they had expected it to be. Workers 
will be willing to accept lower wages—because each dollar of wages is able to buy more 
goods and services—and firms will be willing to accept lower prices. In addition, the un-
employment resulting from the recession will make workers more willing to accept lower 
wages, and the decline in demand will make firms more willing to accept lower prices. 
As a result, the SRAS curve will shift to the right, from SRAS1 to SRAS2. At this point, the 
economy will be back in long-run equilibrium (point C). The shift from SRAS1 to SRAS2 
will not happen instantly. It may take the economy several years to return to potential 
GDP. The important conclusion is that a decline in aggregate demand causes a recession 
in the short run, but in the long run it causes only a decline in the price level.
Economists refer to the process of adjustment back to potential GDP just described 
as an automatic mechanism because it occurs without any actions by the government. 
An alternative to waiting for the automatic mechanism to end a recession is for the gov-
ernment to use monetary and fiscal policy to shift the AD curve to the right and restore 
potential GDP more quickly. We will discuss monetary and fiscal policy in Chapters 26 
and 27. Economists debate whether it is better to wait for the automatic mechanism to 
end recessions or whether it is better to use monetary and fiscal policy.
Does It Matter What Causes  
a Decline in Aggregate Demand?
We have seen that GDP has four components and that a decrease 
in any of the four components can cause the aggregate demand 
curve to shift to the left, bringing on a recession. In practice, though, 
most  recessions in the United States since World War II have begun 
with a decline in residential construction. Edward Leamer of the 
University of California, Los Angeles has gone so far as to argue that 
“housing is the business cycle,” meaning that declines in residential 
construction are the most important reason for the declines in aggre-
gate demand that lead to recessions. The shaded periods in the graph 
below represent recessions. The graph shows that spending on resi-
dential construction has declined prior to every recession since 1955.
The figure shows again a fact that we noted earlier in the chap-
ter: The decline in residential construction during the 2007–2009

Data from U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.
The collapse in spending on housing 
added to the severity of the 2007–
2009 recession.

 
Macroeconomic Equilibrium in the Long Run and the Short Run

recession was particularly severe. Spending on residential construction declined by al-
most 60 percent from the fourth quarter of 2005 to the second quarter of 2010. Largely 
because of these problems in the housing sector, the decline in real GDP during the 
recession of 2007–2009 was larger than during any other recession since the Great De-
pression of the 1930s.
What causes declines in spending on residential construction, and why was the decline 
that preceded the 2007–2009 recession so severe? As we discussed in Chapter 21, late in a 
business cycle expansion, the inflation rate and interest rates start to increase. As we will 
discuss in Chapter 26, higher interest rates often result from monetary policy actions as the 
Federal Reserve tries to slow down the economy and reduce the rate of inflation. Higher 
interest rates reduce consumer demand for new houses by increasing the cost of loans.
But the collapse in residential construction prior to and during the recession of 
2007–2009 was due more to the deflating of the “housing bubble” of 2002–2005 and to 
the financial crisis that began in 2007 than to higher interest rates. We will discuss both 
the housing bubble and the financial crisis later in this chapter. At this point, we can 
note that research by Carmen M. Reinhart of the University of Maryland and Kenneth 
S. Rogoff of Harvard University shows that declines in aggregate demand that result 
from financial crises tend to be larger and more long lasting than declines due to other 
factors. So, the experience of 2007–2009 indicates that, in fact, the source of the decline 
in aggregate demand can be important in determining the severity of a recession.

Expansion
The Short-Run Effect of an Increase in Aggregate Demand Suppose that 
instead of becoming pessimistic, many firms become optimistic about the future profit-
ability of new investment, as happened during the information technology and telecom-
munications booms of the late 1990s. The resulting increase in investment will shift the 
AD curve to the right, as shown in Figure 24.6. Equilibrium moves from point A to 
point B. Real GDP rises from $14.0 trillion to $14.3 trillion, and the price level rises 
from 100 to 103. The economy will be above potential real GDP: Firms are operating

beyond their normal level of capacity, and some workers who would ordinarily be struc-
turally or frictionally unemployed or who would not be in the labor force are employed.
Adjustment Back to Potential GDP in the Long Run Just as an automatic mech-
anism brings the economy back to potential GDP from a recession, an automatic mecha-
nism brings the economy back from a short-run equilibrium beyond potential GDP. Figure 
24.6 illustrates this mechanism. The shift from AD1 to AD2 initially leads to a short-run 
equilibrium, with the price level rising from 100 to 103 (point B). Workers and firms will 
begin to adjust to the price level being higher than they had expected. Workers will push for 
higher wages—because each dollar of wages is able to buy fewer goods and services—and 
firms will charge higher prices. In addition, the low levels of unemployment resulting from 
the expansion will make it easier for workers to negotiate for higher wages, and the increase 
in demand will make it easier for firms to receive higher prices. As a result, the SRAS curve 
will shift to the left, from SRAS1 to SRAS2. At this point, the economy will be back in long-
run equilibrium. Once again, the shift from SRAS1 to SRAS2 will not happen instantly. The 
process of returning to potential GDP may stretch out for more than a year.
Supply Shock
The Short-Run Effect of a Supply Shock Suppose oil prices increase substantially. 
This supply shock will increase many firms’ costs and cause the SRAS curve to shift to the 
left, as shown in panel (a) of Figure 24.7. Notice that the price level is higher in the new 
short-run equilibrium (102 rather than 100), but real GDP is lower ($13.7 trillion rather than  
$14 trillion). This unpleasant combination of inflation and recession is called stagflation.
Adjustment Back to Potential GDP in the Long Run The recession caused 
by a supply shock increases unemployment and reduces output. This eventually results 
in workers being willing to accept lower wages and firms being willing to accept lower

How Long Does It Take to Return to 
Potential GDP? Economic Forecasts 
Following the Recession of 2007–2009
Making accurate macroeconomic forecasts is difficult. As we 
have seen, many factors can cause aggregate demand or aggre-
gate supply to shift. Because it is challenging to predict how much aggregate demand and 
aggregate supply will shift, economists often have difficulty predicting the beginning and 
end of a recession. The Federal Reserve, foreign central banks, other government agen-
cies, large banks, forecasting firms, and academic economists use a variety of forecasting 
models to predict changes in GDP. Most forecasting models consist of equations that 
represent the macroeconomic relationships—such as the relationship between dispos-
able income and consumption spending—that underlie the aggregate demand and ag-
gregate supply model. After economists have statistically estimated the equations using 
economic data, they can use the models to forecast values for GDP and the price level.
Most economists agree that an automatic mechanism brings the economy back to 
potential GDP in the long run. But how long is the long run? When the recession of 
2007–2009 ended in June 2009, the economy was far from potential GDP. Even two 
years later, in mid-2011, real GDP remained more than 7 percent below potential GDP. 
How long would it take for the economy to finally return to potential GDP? The figure 
below shows the Congressional Budget Office’s estimates of potential GDP along with 
three forecasts of real GDP made in 2011 by the following:

• 
Officials at the Federal Reserve

prices. In panel (b) of Figure 24.7, the short-run aggregate supply curve shifts from 
SRAS2 to SRAS1, moving the economy from point B back to point A. The economy is 
back to potential GDP at the original price level. It may take several years for this process 
to be completed. An alternative would be to use monetary and fiscal policy to shift the 
aggregate demand to the right. Using policy in this way would bring the economy back 
to potential GDP more quickly but would result in a permanently higher price level.

The forecasts of the White House and the CBO agreed that real GDP would not re-

pessimistic, with real GDP remaining below potential GDP in 2017. These forecasts in-
dicate how severe the 2007–2009 recession was in that real GDP was not expected to re-
turn to potential GDP until nearly seven years after the end of the recession. Prior to the 
Alan Krueger, the chair of the 
Council of Economic Advisers

the economy would take to return to

2007–2009 recession, the recession of 1981–1982 had been the most severe since the Great 
Depression. Yet it took less than three years after the end of that recession for real GDP to 
return to potential GDP.
These macroeconomic forecasts played an important role in the policy debates of 
2011 and 2012. As we will discuss in Chapters 26 and 27, economists and policymakers 
disagreed about why the U.S. economy would take so long to return to potential GDP 
and about what measures the federal government might take to shorten the time.

A Dynamic Aggregate Demand 
and Aggregate Supply Model*
The basic aggregate demand and aggregate supply model used so far in this chapter 
provides important insights into how short-run macroeconomic equilibrium is deter-
mined. Unfortunately, the model also provides some misleading results. For instance, it 
incorrectly predicts that a recession caused by the aggregate demand curve shifting to 
the left will cause the price level to fall, which has not happened for an entire year since 
the 1930s. The difficulty with the basic model arises from the following two assump-
tions we made: (1) The economy does not experience continuing inflation, and (2) the 
economy does not experience long-run growth. We can develop a more useful aggregate 
demand and aggregate supply model by dropping these assumptions. The result will be 
a model that takes into account that the economy is not static, with an unchanging level 
of potential real GDP and no continuing inflation, but dynamic, with potential real GDP 
that grows over time and inflation that continues every year. We can create a dynamic 
aggregate demand and aggregate supply model by making changes to the basic model 
that incorporate the following important macroeconomic facts:
• 
Potential real GDP increases continually, shifting the long-run aggregate supply 
curve to the right.
• 
During most years, the aggregate demand curve shifts to the right.
• 
Except during periods when workers and firms expect high rates of inflation, the 
short-run aggregate supply curve shifts to the right.
Figure 24.8 illustrates how incorporating these macroeconomic facts changes the 
basic aggregate demand and aggregate supply model. We start with SRAS1 and AD1 in-
tersecting at point A, at a price level of 100 and real GDP of $14.0 trillion. Because this 
intersection occurs at a point on LRAS1, we know the economy is in long-run equilib-
rium. The long-run aggregate supply curve shifts to the right, from LRAS1 to LRAS2. 
This shift occurs because during the year, potential real GDP increases as the U.S. labor 
force and the U.S. capital stock increase and technological progress occurs. The short-
run aggregate supply curve shifts from SRAS1 to SRAS2. This shift occurs because the 
same variables that cause the long-run aggregate supply curve to shift to the right will 
also increase the quantity of goods and services that firms are willing to supply in the 
short run. Finally, the aggregate demand curve shifts to the right, from AD1 to AD2. 
The aggregate demand curve shifts for several reasons: As the population grows and 
incomes rise, consumption will increase over time. As the economy grows, firms will 
expand capacity, and new firms will be formed, increasing investment. An expanding

We start with the basic aggregate demand and aggregate supply model. In the dynamic model, increases in the labor force and capital stock as well as technological change 
cause long-run aggregate supply to shift over the course of a year, from LRAS1 to LRAS2. Typically, these same factors cause short-run aggregate supply to shift from 
SRAS1 to SRAS2. Aggregate demand will shift from AD1 to AD2 if, as is usually the case, spending by consumers, firms, and the government increases during the year.

population and an expanding economy require increased government services, such as 
more police officers and teachers, so government purchases will increase.
The new equilibrium in Figure 24.8 occurs at point B, where AD2 intersects SRAS2 
on LRAS2. In the new equilibrium, the price level remains at 100, while real GDP in-
creases to $14.3 trillion. Notice that there has been no inflation because the price level is 
unchanged, at 100. There has been no inflation because aggregate demand and aggregate 
supply shifted to the right by exactly as much as long-run aggregate supply. We would 
not expect this to be the typical situation for two reasons. First, the SRAS curve is also 
affected by workers’ and firms’ expectations of future changes in the price level and by 
supply shocks. These variables can partially or completely offset the normal tendency of 
the SRAS curve to shift to the right over the course of a year. Second, we know that con-
sumers, firms, and the government may cut back on expenditures. This reduced spend-
ing will result in the aggregate demand curve shifting to the right less than it normally 
would or, possibly, shifting to the left. In fact, as we will see shortly, changes in the price 
level and in real GDP in the short run are determined by shifts in the SRAS and AD curves.
What Is the Usual Cause of Inflation?
The dynamic aggregate demand and aggregate supply model provides a more accurate 
explanation than the basic model of the source of most inflation. If total spending in the 
economy grows faster than total production, prices rise. Figure 24.9 illustrates this point 
by showing that if the AD curve shifts to the right by more than the LRAS curve, infla-
tion results because equilibrium occurs at a higher price level, point B. In the new equi-
librium, the SRAS curve has shifted to the right by less than the LRAS curve because the 
anticipated increase in prices offsets some of the technological change and increases in 
the labor force and capital stock that occur during the year. Although inflation generally

results from total spending growing faster than total production, a shift to the left of the 
short-run aggregate supply curve can also cause an increase in the price level, as we saw 
earlier, in the discussion of supply shocks.
As we saw in Figure 24.8, if aggregate demand increases by the same amount as 
short-run and long-run aggregate supply, the price level will not change. In this case, the 
economy experiences economic growth without inflation.
The Recession of 2007–2009
We can use the dynamic aggregate demand and aggregate supply model to analyze the 
recession of 2007–2009. The recession began in December 2007, with the end of the 
economic expansion that had begun in November 2001. Several factors combined to 
bring on the recession:
• 
The end of the housing bubble. The figure in the Making the Connection on page 808 
shows that spending on residential construction increased rapidly from 2002 to 
2005, before declining more than 60 percent between the end of 2005 and the begin-
ning of 2010. The increase in spending on housing was partly the result of actions 
the Federal Reserve had taken to lower interest rates during and after the recession 
of 2001. As interest rates on mortgage loans declined, more consumers began to buy 
new homes. But by 2005, it was clear that a speculative bubble was partly respon-
sible for the rapidly rising prices of both newly built and existing homes. A bubble 
occurs when people become less concerned with the underlying value of an asset—
either a physical asset, such as a house, or a financial asset, such as a stock—and 
focus instead on expectations of the price of the asset increasing. In some areas of 
the country, such as California, Arizona, and Florida, many homes were purchased 
by investors who intended to resell them for higher prices than they paid for them 
and did not intend to live in them. Some popular television programs explored ways 
that people could “flip” houses by buying and quickly reselling them. Speculative 
bubbles eventually end, and the housing bubble started to deflate in 2006. Both new 
home sales and housing prices began to decline. The growth of aggregate demand 
slowed as spending on residential construction—a component of investment spend-
ing—fell. We will discuss the housing bubble further in Chapter 26.
• 
The financial crisis. Problems in the housing market were bad news for workers and 
firms involved with residential construction. In addition, falling housing prices led to 
an increased number of borrowers defaulting on their mortgage loans. These defaults 
caused banks and some other financial institutions to suffer heavy losses. Beginning 
in the spring of 2008, the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Federal Reserve 
intervened to save several large financial institutions from bankruptcy. We will look

Using Dynamic Aggregate 
Demand and Aggregate 
Supply to Understand Inflation
The most common cause of inflation is 
total spending increasing faster than total 
production.
1.  The economy begins at point A, 
with real GDP of $14.0 trillion and a 
price level of 100. An increase in full-
employment real GDP from $14.0 
trillion to $14.3 trillion causes long-run 
aggregate supply to shift from LRAS1 to 
LRAS2. Aggregate demand shifts from 
AD1 to AD2.
2.   Because AD shifts to the right by more 
than the LRAS curve, the price level in the 
new equilibrium rises from 100 to 104.

at the details of the financial crisis in Chapters 25 and 26. For now we can note that 
the financial crisis led to a “credit crunch” that made it difficult for many households 
and firms to obtain the loans they needed to finance their spending. This drying up 
of credit contributed to declines in consumption spending and investment spending.
• 
The rapid increase in oil prices during 2008. Oil prices, which had been as low 
as $34 per barrel in 2004, had risen to $140 per barrel by mid-2008. The increase 
in the price of oil appeared to be caused by increased demand in rapidly growing 
economies, particularly India and China, and by the difficulty in developing new 
supplies of oil in the short run. With the deepening of the recession, worldwide 
demand for oil declined, and oil prices fell to about $40 per barrel in early 2009. As 
we have seen in this chapter, rising oil prices can result in a supply shock that causes 
the short-run aggregate supply curve to shift to the left. Although rising oil prices 
contributed to the severity of the recession, they had less impact than some econo-
mists had predicted. The U.S. economy appears to have become less vulnerable to 
increases in oil prices. Increases in the price of oil during the 1970s and early 1980s 
led many firms to switch to less-oil-dependent production processes. For example, 
FedEx and other firms used more fuel-efficient jets and trucks. As a result, the U.S. 
economy was consuming almost 60 percent less oil per dollar of GDP than it had in 
the mid-1970s. During 2008, oil price increases did not shift the short-run aggre-
gate supply curve as far to the left as similar increases had 30 years earlier.
Figure 24.10 illustrates the beginning of the recession by showing the economy’s 
short-run macroeconomic equilibrium in 2007 and 2008. In the figure, short-run equi-
librium for 2007 occurs where AD2007 intersects SRAS2007 at real GDP of $13.21 trillion 
and a price level of 106.2. Real GDP in 2007 was slightly above potential real GDP of 
$13.20 trillion, shown by LRAS2007. During 2008, aggregate demand shifted to the right, 
from AD2007 to AD2008. Aggregate demand increased by less than potential GDP because 
of the negative effects of the bursting of the housing bubble and the financial crisis on 
consumption spending and investment spending. The supply shock from higher oil prices 
caused short-run aggregate supply to shift to the left, from SRAS2007 to SRAS2008. Short-
run equilibrium for 2008 occurred at real GDP of $13.16 trillion and a price level of 108.6. 
A large gap opened between short-run equilibrium real GDP and potential GDP. Not sur-
prisingly, unemployment rose from 4.6 percent in 2007 to 5.8 percent in 2008. The price 
level increased only from 106.2 to 108.6, so the inflation rate was a low 2.3 percent.
The recession persisted into 2009, as potential real GDP increased to $13.78 trillion, 
while real GDP fell to $12.70 trillion. This increased gap between real GDP and potential 
GDP caused the unemployment rate to soar to 9.3 percent—the highest unemployment 
Figure 24.10 
The Beginning of the Recession 
of 2007–2009
Between 2007 and 2008, the AD curve shifted 
to the right, but not by nearly enough to offset 
the shift to the right of the LRAS curve, which 
represented the increase in potential real GDP 
from $13.20 trillion to $13.51 trillion. Be-
cause of a sharp increase in oil prices, short-
run aggregate supply shifted to the left, from 
SRAS2007 to SRAS2008. Real GDP decreased 
from $13.21 trillion in 2007 to $13.16 trillion 
in 2008, which was far below the potential 
real GDP, shown by LRAS2008. As a result, 
the unemployment rate rose from 4.6 percent 
in 2007 to 5.8 percent in 2008. Because the 
increase in aggregate demand was small, the 
price level increased only from 106.2 in 2007 
to 108.6 in 2008, so the inflation rate for 2008 
was only 2.3 percent.

Solving the Problem
Step 1: Review the chapter material. This problem is about using the dynamic ag-
gregate demand and aggregate supply model, so you may want to review the 
section “A Dynamic Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply Model,” which 
begins on page 812.
Step 2: Use the information in the table to draw the graph. You need to draw five 
curves: SRAS and LRAS for both 1974 and 1975 and AD, which is the same 
for both years. You know that the two LRAS curves will be vertical lines at the 
values given for potential GDP in the table. Because of the large supply shock, 
you know that the SRAS curve shifted to the left. You are instructed to assume 
that the AD curve did not shift. Your graph should look like this:

The 1974–1975 recession clearly illustrates how a sup-
ply shock affects the economy. Following the Arab–Israeli 
War of 1973, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting 
Countries (OPEC) increased the price of a barrel of oil from 
less than $3 to more than $10. Use this information and the 
statistics in the following table to draw a dynamic aggre-

during 2010 and 2011, leaving the unemployment rate above 9 percent.

Step 3: Explain your graph. LRAS1974 and LRAS1975 are at the levels of potential real 
GDP for each year. Macroeconomic equilibrium for 1974 occurs where the 
AD curve intersects the SRAS1974 curve, with real GDP of $4.89 trillion and 
a price level of 30.7. Macroeconomic equilibrium for 1975 occurs where the 
AD curve intersects the SRAS1975 curve, with real GDP of $4.88 trillion and a 
price level of 33.6.
Extra Credit: As a result of the supply shock, the economy moved from an equilibrium 
output just below potential GDP in 1974 (the recession actually began right at the end of

Conclusion
Chapter 3 demonstrated the power of the microeconomic model of demand and supply 
in explaining how the prices and quantities of individual products are determined. This 
chapter showed that we need a different model to explain the behavior of the whole 
economy. We saw that the macroeconomic model of aggregate demand and aggregate 
supply explains fluctuations in real GDP and the price level.
Fluctuations in real GDP, employment, and the price level have led the federal gov-
ernment to implement macroeconomic policies. We will explore these policies in Chap-
ters 26 and 27, but first, in Chapter 25, we consider the role money plays in the economy.

shipments caused the airline industry to be concerned about the health of the economy.

Economics in Your Life
Is an Employer Likely to Cut Your Pay during a Recession?
At the beginning of this chapter, we asked you to consider whether during a recession your em-
ployer is likely to reduce your pay and cut the prices of the products he or she sells. In this chapter, 
we saw that even during a recession, the price level rarely falls. In fact, in the United States, the 
GDP deflator has not fallen for an entire year since the 1930s. Although some firms reduced prices 
during the recession of 2007–2009, most firms did not. So, the owner of the coffeehouse where 
you work will probably not cut the price of lattes unless sales have declined drastically. We also 
saw that most firms are more reluctant to cut wages than to increase them because wage cuts can 
have a negative effect on worker morale and productivity. Because the recession of 2007–2009 was 
particularly severe, some firms did cut wages. But given that you are a highly skilled barista, your 
employer is unlikely to cut your wages for fear that you might quit and work for a competitor.

Air Cargo Down 
as Comerica Mulls 
Recession Risk: 
Freight Markets
 Sagging cargo shipments in the 
belly of passenger jets at carriers such 
as United Continental Holdings Inc. 
(UAL) and Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL) 
are stoking concern that the U.S. 
economy risks a double-dip recession.
United’s cargo traffic plunged 
17 percent in August for the fourth 
straight drop that exceeded 10 per-
cent, while Delta’s cargo was little 
changed for three months in a row 
and American Airlines extended a 
streak of decreases that began in May.
“We have a lot of consumer ner-
vousness over the economy,” Delta 
Chief Cargo Officer Neel Shah said in 
a telephone interview. “One day peo-
ple feel good, and the next day they 
feel bad, and it’s that volatility that’s 
the problem.”
 Cargo is a bellwether for the carri-
ers’ main business of flying people, said 
Hunter Keay, a Wolfe Trahan & Co. an-
alyst. While cargo is less than 4 percent 
of sales at the biggest U.S. airlines, their 
monthly reports offer more-timely 
soundings on the $60 billion global air-
freight market than quarterly results 
from FedEx Corp. (FDX) and United 
Parcel Service Inc. (UPS).
Frequent flights and broad net-
works help airlines win business for 
everything from U.S. mail to electron-
ics, along with niche shipments such 
as sushi-grade seafood, baby chicks 
Smaller Freight Volumes Signal Continued 
Economic Troubles
At Atlanta-based Delta, cargo 
traffic had been growing by 15 percent 
in March and April before cooling to a 
2.1 percent pace for May. Traffic has 
been little changed since then. Ex-
ports are down from China and Japan, 
and domestic U.S. loads are shrinking, 
Shah said. . . .
 “Historically, cargo has been a 
pretty good leading indicator for busi-
ness and premium traffic by about three 
to six months,” Michael Linenberg, 
a Deutsche Bank AG analyst in New 
York, said in a note last month. “Busi-
ness and premium traffic tends to lead 
leisure travel by a similar time frame.”
Even as industry executives such 
as Delta President Ed Bastian said this 
week at a conference hosted by Linen-
berg that travel demand was firm, 
some also signaled their concern with 
steps to shrink passenger capacity.
Delta said it would trim 2012 flying 
by 2 percent to 3 percent, while Ameri-
can said it would pare available seats 
next quarter by 0.5 percent and said its 
plans for next year are under review. 
United and Delta previously scaled back 
on seating for the end of this year.
“Cargo is usually the canary in 
the mine shaft,” Delta’s Shah said. “I 
don’t know if we’re going to face that 
sort of situation this time. Passenger 
demand is holding up quite well, yet 
everyone is being very cautious with 
costs and capacity.”

“The decline in air cargo is yet 
another indicator among so many that 
suggests the economy continues to be 
weak and may be inching closer to re-
cession,” said Robert Dye, Comerica 
Inc. (CMA)’s chief economist. . . .
The slide in air-carrier cargo cor-
relates with “consumer confidence 
falling off a cliff ” in August, Dye 
said in an interview from Dallas. The 
Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index 
slid to minus 49.3 in the week ended 
Sept. 4, 2011’s second-worst reading, 
and stayed at that level last week.
Dye rates the risk of a recession 
at 45 percent. Mark Vitner, senior 
economist at Wells Fargo Securities 
LLC in Charlotte, North Carolina, put 
the chances at one in three. The cargo 
drop “flies in the face” of assertions 
that shipping disruptions from Japan’s 
earthquake had been resolved, he said.
“I don’t think it’s unreasonable to 
look at these cargo numbers and grow 
a little suspicious on what it means for 
passenger trends,” Keay, who is based 
in New York, said in an interview.
Analysts and investors have been 
watching for signs of a return to reces-
sion because unemployment has hov-
ered at about 9 percent or more for 
two years, damping consumer confi-
dence and spending. . . .
The airline-cargo slowdown be-
gan in May, following Japan’s March 
11 earthquake and tsunami. Carriers 
also cited tougher comparisons with 
a year earlier when many businesses 
replenished inventory as the economy 
improved.

GDP fell to $12.7 trillion in the first quarter 
of 2009, and the price level rose to 108.6. 
Since the end of the recession, the econ-
omy has improved slightly, but real GDP 
had grown to only $13.3 trillion by the sec-
ond quarter of 2011, still less than it was at 
the beginning of the recession, and the 
price level had increased to 116.0.
c Because the trends in cargo shipments 
often indicate future trends in passen-
ger air travel, airlines initiated plans to re-
duce passenger capacity for late 2011 and 
2012. This is yet another indication of a fear 
that the economy may be slowing down 
and could be moving toward another 
recession.
Thinking Critically
1. Between the fourth quarter of 2007 and 
the first quarter of 2009, the U.S. unem-
ployment rate rose from 4.8 percent to 
8.5 percent. In the aggregate demand 
and aggregate supply graph shown, 
where would the long-run aggregate 
supply curve have been in 2009? Briefly 
explain.
2. For the second quarter of 2011, real 
GDP in 2005 dollars was $13.3 trillion 
and the price level was 116.0. Use an 
aggregate demand and aggregate sup-
ply graph to illustrate the changes from 
the first quarter of 2009 to the second 
quarter of 2011 and explain what hap-
pened to aggregate demand and aggre-
gate supply to result in these changes.
economy in general. Cargo accounts for 
less than 4 percent of sales at the nation’s 
largest airlines, but trends in the cargo seg-
ment often precede similar trends in the 
passenger segment. With their extensive 
networks and large number of daily flights, 
airlines have attracted a vast array of cargo 
customers, so the decline in cargo reflects 
the lower volume of shipments occurring in 
a number of industries across the country. 
According to Robert Dye, the chief econo-
mist at Comerica, this “is yet another indi-
cator among so many that suggests the 
economy continues to be weak and may  
be inching closer to recession.” We can use 
the aggregate demand and aggregate sup-
ply model to analyze what happened to the 
U.S. economy during the 2007–2009 reces-
sion. The figure below shows that the econ-
omy during the fourth quarter of 2007 was 
in long-run equilibrium. Real GDP in 2005 
dollars was $13.4 trillion, and the price level 
was 107.4. Declines in consumption and in-
vestment spending caused the aggregate 
demand curve to shift to the left, from 
ADQ4,2007 to ADQ1,2009. Meanwhile, aggre-
gate supply also decreased, partly as a re-
sult of lower capital investment and 
increases in oil and commodity prices in 
2008. The short-run aggregate supply curve 
shifts to the left, from SRASQ4,2007 to 
SRASQ1,2009, but the decline in aggregate 
supply is greater than the decline in aggre-
gate demand. As a result, short-run real 
Key Points in the Article
Although cargo shipments account for only 
a small percentage of total business for the 
major airlines, they have historically been 
good indicators of future passenger travel. 
A decline in shipments has some indus-
try analysts concerned that passenger air 
travel may also experience declines in the 
next 6 to 12 months. Airlines have reacted 
with planned cuts in passenger service. The 
air cargo slowdown began in May 2011, oc-
curring alongside a drop in consumer con-
fidence tied to an unemployment rate that 
continued to exceed 9  percent. Some ana-
lysts view the decline in cargo shipments 
and the airlines’ actions to scale back 
passenger service as an indication that an 
already-sluggish economy may be slipping 
even further.
Analyzing the News
a Three major U.S. airlines indicated in 
August 2011 that air cargo shipments 
remained sluggish or had declined since 
May. While shipments with Delta Air Lines 
were little changed, those at American Air-
lines and United Air Lines fell for the fourth 
consecutive month, with the percentage of 
United’s shipments falling by double digits 
each month.

Summary
The aggregate demand and aggregate supply model enables us 
to explain short-run fluctuations in real GDP and price level. 
The aggregate demand curve shows the relationship between 
the price level and the level of planned aggregate expenditures 
by households, firms, and the government. The short-run ag-
gregate supply curve shows the relationship in the short run 
between the price level and the quantity of real GDP supplied 
by firms. The long-run aggregate supply curve shows the re-
lationship in the long run between the price level and the quan-
tity of real GDP supplied. The four components of aggregate 
demand are consumption (C), investment (I), government pur-
chases (G), and net exports (NX). The aggregate demand curve 
is downward sloping because a decline in the price level causes 
consumption, investment, and net exports to increase. If the 
price level changes but all else remains constant, the economy 
will move up or down a stationary aggregate demand curve. If 
any variable other than the price level changes, the aggregate 
demand curve will shift. The variables that cause the aggregate 
demand curve to shift are divided into three categories: changes 
in government policies, changes in the expectations of house-
holds and firms, and changes in foreign variables. For example, 
monetary policy involves the actions the Federal Reserve takes 
to manage the money supply and interest rates to pursue mac-
roeconomic policy objectives. When the Federal Reserve takes 
actions to change interest rates, consumption and investment 
spending will change, shifting the aggregate demand curve. 
Fiscal policy involves changes in federal taxes and purchases 
that are intended to achieve macroeconomic policy objectives. 
Changes in federal taxes and purchases shift the aggregate de-
mand curve.

exports will increase. This change causes the 
aggregate demand curve to shift to the right, 
from AD1 to AD2. We know that real GDP will 
increase, but we can’t be sure whether the price 
level will rise or fall because that depends on 
whether the aggregate supply curve or the ag-
gregate demand curve has shifted farther to 
the right. I assume that aggregate supply shifts 
out farther than aggregate demand, so I show 
the final price level, P3, as being lower than the 
initial price level, P1.

Summary
The long-run aggregate supply curve is a vertical line because in 
the long run, real GDP is always at its potential level and is un-
affected by the price level. The short-run aggregate supply curve 
slopes upward because workers and firms fail to predict accurately 
the future price level. The three main explanations of why this fail-
ure results in an upward-sloping aggregate supply curve are that 
(1) contracts make wages and prices “sticky;” (2) businesses often 
adjust wages slowly; and (3) menu costs make some prices sticky. 
Menu costs are the costs to firms of changing prices on menus or 
in catalogs. If the price level changes but all else remains constant, 
the economy will move up or down a stationary aggregate supply 
curve. If any variable other than the price level changes, the ag-
gregate supply curve will shift. The aggregate supply curve shifts 
as a result of increases in the labor force and capital stock, techno-
logical change, expected increases or decreases in the future price 
level, adjustments of workers and firms to errors in past expecta-
tions about the price level, and unexpected increases or decreases 
in the price of an important raw material. A supply shock is an 
unexpected event that causes the short-run aggregate supply curve 
to shift.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE: Use the aggregate demand and aggregate supply model to illustrate the difference 
between short-run and long-run macroeconomic equilibrium.
Summary
In long-run macroeconomic equilibrium, the aggregate demand 
and short-run aggregate supply curves intersect at a point on the 
long-run aggregate supply curve. In short-run macroeconomic 
equilibrium, the aggregate demand and short-run aggregate sup-
ply curves often intersect at a point off the long-run aggregate 
supply curve. An automatic mechanism drives the economy to 
long-run equilibrium. If short-run equilibrium occurs at a point 
below potential real GDP, wages and prices will fall, and the short-
run aggregate supply curve will shift to the right until potential 
GDP is restored. If short-run equilibrium occurs at a point beyond 
potential real GDP, wages and prices will rise, and the short-run 
aggregate supply curve will shift to the left until potential GDP is 
restored. Real GDP can be temporarily above or below its poten-
tial level, either because of shifts in the aggregate demand curve or 
because supply shocks lead to shifts in the aggregate supply curve. 
Stagflation is a combination of inflation and recession, usually re-
sulting from a supply shock.

In early 2009, Christina Romer, who was then chair of the 
Council of Economic Advisers, and Jared Bernstein, who was 
then an economic adviser to Vice President Joseph Biden, 
forecast how long they expected it would take for real GDP 
to return to potential GDP, assuming that Congress passed 
fiscal policy legislation proposed by President Obama:
It should be understood that all of the esti-
mates presented in this memo are subject to 
significant margins of error. There is the ob-
vious uncertainty that comes from modeling 
a hypothetical package rather than the final 
legislation passed by the Congress. But, there is 
the more fundamental uncertainty that comes 
with any estimate of the effects of a program. 
Our estimates of economic relationships . . . 
are derived from historical experience and so 
will not apply exactly in any given episode. 
Furthermore, the uncertainty is surely higher 
than normal now because the current reces-
sion is unusual both in its fundamental causes 
and its severity.
 
 Why would the causes of a recession and its severity affect 
the accuracy of forecasts of when the economy would re-
turn to potential GDP?

American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan, January 9, 2009, p. 2.
Summary
To make the aggregate demand and aggregate supply model 
more realistic, we need to make it dynamic by incorporating 
three facts that were left out of the basic model: (1) Potential 
real GDP increases continually, shifting the long-run aggregate 
supply curve to the right; (2) during most years, aggregate de-
mand shifts to the right; and (3) except during periods when 
workers and firms expect high rates of inflation, the aggregate 
supply curve shifts to the right. The dynamic aggregate demand 
and aggregate supply model allows us to analyze macroeco-
nomic conditions, including the beginning of the 2007–2009 
recession.

Appendix
Macroeconomic Schools of Thought
Macroeconomics became a separate field of economics in 1936, with the publication of 
John Maynard Keynes’s book The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money. 
Keynes, an economist at the University of Cambridge in England, was attempting to ex-
plain the devastating Great Depression of the 1930s. As we discussed in Chapter 23, real 
GDP in the United States declined more than 25 percent between 1929 and 1933 and 
did not return to its potential level until the United States entered World War II in 1941. 
The unemployment rate soared to 25 percent by 1933 and did not return to its 1929 
level until 1942. Keynes developed a version of the aggregate demand and aggregate 
supply model to explain these facts. The widespread acceptance during the 1930s and 
1940s of Keynes’s model became known as the Keynesian revolution.
In fact, using the aggregate demand and aggregate supply model remains the most 
widely accepted approach to analyzing macroeconomic issues. Because the model has 
been modified significantly from Keynes’s day, many economists who use the model 
today refer to themselves as new Keynesians. The new Keynesians emphasize the impor-
tance of the stickiness of wages and prices in explaining fluctuations in real GDP. A sig-
nificant number of economists, however, dispute whether using the aggregate demand 
and aggregate supply model, as we have discussed it in this chapter, is the best way to 
analyze macroeconomic issues. These alternative schools of thought use models that dif-
fer significantly from the standard aggregate demand and aggregate supply model. We 
can briefly consider each of the three major alternative models:
 1. The monetarist model
 2. The new classical model
 3. The real business cycle model
The Monetarist Model
The monetarist model—also known as the neo-Quantity Theory of Money model—was 
developed beginning in the 1940s by Milton Friedman, an economist at the University 
of Chicago who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1976. Friedman argued 
that the Keynesian approach overstates the amount of macroeconomic instability in 
the economy. In particular, he argued that the economy will ordinarily be at potential 
real GDP. In the book A Monetary History of the United States: 1867–1960, written with 
Anna Jacobson Schwartz, Friedman argued that most fluctuations in real output were 
caused by fluctuations in the money supply rather than by fluctuations in consump-
tion spending or investment spending. Friedman and Schwartz argued that the severity 
of the Great Depression was caused by the Federal Reserve’s allowing the quantity of 
money in the economy to fall by more than 25 percent between 1929 and 1933.
In the United States, the Federal Reserve is responsible for managing the quan-
tity of money. As we will discuss further in Chapter 26, the Federal Reserve has typi-
cally focused more on controlling interest rates than on controlling the money supply. 
Friedman has argued that the Federal Reserve should change its practices and adopt a 
 monetary growth rule, which is a plan for increasing the quantity of money at a fixed 
rate. Friedman believed that adopting a monetary growth rule would reduce fluctua-
tions in real GDP, employment, and inflation.
Friedman’s ideas, which are referred to as monetarism, attracted significant support 
during the 1970s and early 1980s, when the economy experienced high rates of unem-
ployment and inflation. The support for monetarism declined during the late 1980s and 
1990s, when the unemployment and inflation rates were relatively low. In Chapter 25, 
we will discuss the quantity theory of money, which underlies the monetarist model.

C H A P T E R  2 4  Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply Analysis
The New Classical Model
The new classical model was developed in the mid-1970s by a group of economists includ-
ing Nobel Laureate Robert Lucas of the University of Chicago, Nobel Laureate Thomas Sar-
gent of New York University, and Robert Barro of Harvard University. Some of the views 
held by the new classical macroeconomists are similar to those held by economists before 
the Great Depression. Keynes referred to the economists before the Great Depression as 
“classical economists.” Like the classical economists, the new classical macroeconomists be-
lieve that the economy normally will be at potential real GDP. They also believe that wages 
and prices adjust quickly to changes in demand and supply. Put another way, they believe 
the stickiness in wages and prices emphasized by the new Keynesians is unimportant.
Lucas argues that workers and firms have rational expectations, meaning that they 
form their expectations of the future values of economic variables, such as the inflation 
rate, by making use of all available information, including information on variables—
such as changes in the quantity of money—that might affect aggregate demand. If the 
actual inflation rate is lower than the expected inflation rate, the actual real wage will 
be higher than the expected real wage. These higher real wages will lead to a recession 
because they will cause firms to hire fewer workers and cut back on production. As 
workers and firms adjust their expectations to the lower inflation rate, the real wage 
will decline, and employment and production will expand, bringing the economy out 
of recession. The ideas of Lucas and his followers are referred to as the new classical 
macroeconomics. Supporters of the new classical model agree with supporters of the 
monetarist model that the Federal Reserve should adopt a monetary growth rule. They 
argue that a monetary growth rule will make it easier for workers and firms to accu-
rately forecast the price level, thereby reducing fluctuations in real GDP.
The Real Business Cycle Model
Beginning in the 1980s, some economists, including Nobel Laureates Finn Kydland of 
Carnegie Mellon University and Edward Prescott of Arizona State University, began to ar-
gue that Lucas was correct in assuming that workers and firms formed their expectations 
rationally and that wages and prices adjust quickly to supply and demand but was wrong 
about the source of fluctuations in real GDP. They argue that fluctuations in real GDP 
are caused by temporary shocks to productivity. These shocks can be negative, such as a 
decline in the availability of oil or other raw materials, or positive, such as technological 
change that makes it possible to produce more output with the same quantity of inputs.
According to this school of thought, shifts in the aggregate demand curve have no 
impact on real GDP because the short-run aggregate supply curve is vertical. Other 
schools of thought believe that the short-run aggregate supply curve is upward sloping 
and that only the long-run aggregate supply curve is vertical. Fluctuations in real GDP 
occur when a negative productivity shock causes the short-run aggregate supply curve to 
shift to the left—reducing real GDP—or a positive productivity shock causes the short-
run aggregate supply curve to shift to the right—increasing real GDP. Because this model 
focuses on “real” factors—productivity shocks—rather than changes in the quantity of 
money to explain fluctuations in real GDP, it is known as the real business cycle model.
New classical macroeconomics The 
macroeconomic theories of Robert 
Lucas and others, particularly the idea 
that workers and firms have rational 
expectations.
Real business cycle model A 
macroeconomic model that focuses 
on real, rather than monetary, causes 
of the business cycle.
Karl Marx: Capitalism’s Severest Critic
The schools of macroeconomic thought we have discussed in 
this appendix are considered part of mainstream economic 
theory because of their acceptance of the market system as 
the best means of raising living standards in the long run. One 
quite influential critic of mainstream economic theory was Karl Marx. Marx was born 
in Trier, Germany, in 1818. After graduating from the University of Berlin in 1841, he 
began a career as a political journalist and agitator. His political activities caused him to 
be expelled first from Germany and then from France and Belgium. In 1849, he moved 
to London, where he spent the remainder of his life.

Karl Marx predicted that a final 
economic crisis would lead to the 
collapse of the market system.
Key Terms
In 1867, Marx published the first volume of his greatest work, Das Kapital. Marx 
read closely the most prominent mainstream economists, including Adam Smith, Da-
vid Ricardo, and John Stuart Mill. But Marx believed that he understood how market 
systems would evolve in the long run much better than those earlier authors. Marx ar-
gued that the market system would eventually be replaced by a Communist economy, in 
which the workers would control production. He believed in the labor theory of value, 
which attributed all of the value of a good or service to the labor embodied in it. Ac-
cording to Marx, the owners of businesses—capitalists—did not earn profits by con-
tributing anything of value to the production of goods or services. Instead, capitalists 
earned profits because their “monopoly of the means of production”—their ownership 
of factories and machinery—allowed them to exploit workers by paying them wages 
that were much lower than the value of workers’ contribution to production.
Marx argued that the wages of workers would be driven to levels that allowed only 
bare survival. He also argued that small firms would eventually be driven out of busi-
ness by larger firms, forcing owners of small firms into the working class. Control of 
production would ultimately be concentrated in the hands of a few firms, which would 
have difficulty selling the goods they produced to the impoverished masses. A final eco-
nomic crisis would lead the working classes to rise up, seize control of the economy, and 
establish Communism. Marx died in 1883, without having provided a detailed explana-
tion of how the Communist economy would operate.
Marx had relatively little influence on mainstream thinking in the United States, 
but several political parties in Europe were guided by his ideas. In 1917, the Bolshevik 
party seized control of Russia and established the Soviet Union, the first Communist 
state. Although the Soviet Union was a vicious dictatorship under Vladimir Lenin and 
his successor, Joseph Stalin, its prestige rose when it avoided the macroeconomic diffi-
culties that plagued the market economies during the 1930s. By the late 1940s, Commu-
nist parties had also come to power in China and the countries of Eastern Europe. Poor 
economic performance contributed to the eventual collapse of the Soviet Union and 
its replacement by a market system, although one in which government intervention is 
still widespread. The Communist Party remains in power in China, but the economy 
is evolving toward a market system. Today, only North Korea and Cuba have economies 
that claim to be based on the ideas of Karl Marx.

Economics in Your Life
What if Money Became Increasingly Valuable?
Most people are used to the fact that as prices rise each year, the purchasing power of money falls. 
You will be able to buy fewer goods and services with $1,000 one year from now than you can buy 
today, and you will be able to buy even fewer goods and services the year after that. In fact, with 
an inflation rate of just 3 percent, in 25 years, $1,000 will buy only what $475 can buy today. Sup-
pose, though, that you could live in an economy where the purchasing power of money rose each 
year? What would be the advantages and disadvantages of living in such an economy? As you read 
the chapter, see if you can answer these questions. You can check your answers against those we 
provide on page 854 at the end of this chapter.
made Zimbabwe’s currency almost worth-
less? The government of Zimbabwe had 
decided to pay for all of its expenses by 
printing more and more money. The faster 
the government printed money, the faster 
prices rose. Eventually, both foreigners 
and local residents refused to accept the 
Zimbabwean dollar in exchange for goods 
and services, and the country’s economy 
plunged into a devastating recession, with 
real GDP falling more than 12 percent dur-
ing 2008. In early 2009, the government 
issued 100 trillion dollar bills, not enough 
for a bus ticket in Harare, Zimbabwe’s capi-
tal city. Eventually, in 2009, a new Zimba-
bwean government took the drastic step 
of abandoning its own currency and mak-
ing the U.S. dollar the country’s official 
currency.

People in Africa buy 36 billion bottles of 
Coca-Cola a year. In 2008, Zimbabwe, a 
country in southern Africa, ran out of lo-
cally produced Coke for the first time in at 
least 40 years. Because they could not ob-
tain U.S. dollars, local Coke bottlers were 
not able to import from the United States 
the concentrated syrup used to make the 
soft drink. A meager amount of Coke was 
imported from South Africa, but a single 
bottle sold for around 15 billion Zimba-
bwean dollars! Zimbabwe was suffering the 
effects of an inflation rate so high that it is 
called a hyperinflation. Zimbabwe’s hyper-
inflation was of epic proportions, perhaps 
the worst in world history. When it was first 
introduced in 1980, 1 Zimbabwean dollar 
was worth 1.47 U.S. dollars. By the end of 
2008, the exchange rate was 1 U.S. dollar to 
2 billion Zimbabwean dollars, and prices for 
some large transactions in Zimbabwe were 
calculated in quadrillions (15 zeros) and 
quintillions (18 zeros).
In addition to the Coke shortage, Zim-
babweans were suffering shortages of fuel, 
food, and other basic goods. As the value 
of the Zimbabwean currency fell against 
other currencies, it was difficult for lo-
cal businesses such as the Coke bottlers 
to find anyone willing to exchange U.S. 
dollars for Zimbabwean dollars. What

C H A P T E R  2 5  Money, Banks, and the Federal Reserve System
I
n this chapter, we will explore the role of money in the economy. We will see how 
the banking system creates money and what policy tools the Federal Reserve uses to 
manage the quantity of money. We will also look at the crisis in the banking system 
during the past few years. At the end of the chapter, we will explore the link between 
changes in the quantity of money and changes in the price level. What you learn in this 
chapter will serve as an important foundation for understanding monetary policy and fiscal 
policy, which we study in the next three chapters.
What Is Money, and Why Do We Need It?
Could an economy function without money? We know the answer to this question is 
“yes” because there are many historical examples of economies in which people traded 
goods for other goods rather than using money. For example, a farmer on the American 
frontier during colonial times might have traded a cow for a plow. Most economies, 
though, use money. What is money? The economic definition of money is any asset that 
people are generally willing to accept in exchange for goods and services or for payment 
of debts. Recall from Chapter 8 that an asset is anything of value owned by a person or a 
firm. There are many possible kinds of money: In West Africa, at one time, cowrie shells 
served as money. During World War II, prisoners of war used cigarettes as money.
Barter and the Invention of Money
To understand the importance of money, let’s consider further the situation in econo-
mies that do not use money. These economies, where goods and services are traded di-
rectly for other goods and services, are called barter economies. Barter economies have a 
major shortcoming. To illustrate this shortcoming, consider a farmer on the American 
frontier in colonial days. Suppose the farmer needed another cow and proposed trad-
ing a spare plow to a neighbor for one of the neighbor’s cows. If the neighbor did not 
want the plow, the trade would not happen. For a barter trade to take place between 
two people, each person must want what the other one has. Economists refer to this 
requirement as a double coincidence of wants. The farmer who wants the cow might 
eventually be able to obtain one if he first trades with some other neighbor for some-
thing the neighbor with the cow wants. However, it may take several trades before the 
farmer is ultimately able to trade for what the neighbor with the cow wants. Locating 
several trading partners and making several intermediate trades can take considerable 
time and energy.
The problems with barter give societies an incentive to identify a product that most 
people will accept in exchange for what they have to trade. For example, in colonial 
times, animal skins were very useful in making clothing. The first governor of Tennessee 
actually received a salary of 1,000 deerskins per year, and the secretary of the Treasury 
received 450 otter skins per year. A good used as money that also has value independent 
of its use as money is called a commodity money. Historically, once a good became 
widely accepted as money, people who did not have an immediate use for it would be 
willing to accept it. A colonial farmer—or the governor of Tennessee—might not want a 
deerskin, but as long as he knew he could use the deerskin to buy other goods and ser-
vices, he would be willing to accept it in exchange for what he had to sell.
Trading goods and services is much easier when money becomes available. People 
only need to sell what they have for money and then use the money to buy what they 
want. If the colonial family could find someone to buy their plow, they could use the 
money to buy the cow they wanted. The family with the cow would accept the money 
because they knew they could use it to buy what they wanted. When money is available, 
families are less likely to produce everything or nearly everything they need themselves 
and more likely to specialize.
Most people in modern economies are highly specialized. They do only one thing—
work as a nurse, an accountant, or an engineer—and use the money they earn to buy 
25.1 LEARNING OBJECTIVE
Define money and discuss the 
four functions of money.
Money Assets that people are 
generally willing to accept in exchange 
for goods and services or for payment 
of debts.
Asset Anything of value owned by a 
person or a firm.
Commodity money A good 
used as money that also has value 
independent of its use as money.

 
What Is Money, and Why Do We Need It? 
831
everything else they need. As we discussed in Chapter 2, people become much more 
productive by specializing because they can pursue their comparative advantage. The 
high income levels in modern economies are based on the specialization that money 
makes possible. We can now answer the question, “Why do we need money?” By making 
exchange easier, money allows people to specialize and become more productive.
The Functions of Money
Anything used as money—whether a deerskin, a cowrie seashell, cigarettes, or a dollar 
bill—should fulfill the following four functions:
• 
Medium of exchange
• 
Unit of account
• 
Store of value
• 
Standard of deferred payment
Medium of Exchange Money serves as a medium of exchange when sellers are will-
ing to accept it in exchange for goods or services. When the local supermarket accepts 
your $5 bill in exchange for bread and milk, the $5 bill is serving as a medium of ex-
change. With a medium of exchange, people can sell goods and services for money and 
use the money to buy what they want. An economy is more efficient when a single good 
is recognized as a medium of exchange.
Unit of Account In a barter system, each good has many prices. A cow may be 
worth two plows, 20 bushels of wheat, or six axes. Once a single good is used as money, 
each good has a single price rather than many prices. This function of money gives buy-
ers and sellers a unit of account, a way of measuring value in the economy in terms of 
money. Because the U.S. economy uses dollars as money, each good has a price in terms 
of dollars.
Store of Value Money allows value to be stored easily: If you do not use all your dol-
lars to buy goods and services today, you can hold the rest to use in the future. Money 
is not the only store of value, however. Any asset—shares of Coca-Cola stock, Treasury 
bonds, real estate, or Renoir paintings, for example—represents a store of value. Fi-
nancial assets, such as stocks and bonds, offer an important benefit relative to holding 
money because they pay a higher rate of interest or may increase in value in the future. 
Other assets also have advantages relative to money because they provide services. A 
house, for example, offers you a place to sleep.
Why, then, do people hold any money? The answer has to do with liquidity, or the 
ease with which an asset can be converted into the medium of exchange. Because money 
is the medium of exchange, it is the most liquid asset. If you want to buy something and 
you need to sell an asset to do so, you are likely to incur a cost. For example, if you want 
to buy a car and need to sell bonds or stocks in order to do so, you will need to pay a 
commission to your broker. To avoid such costs, people are willing to hold some of their 
wealth in the form of money, even though other assets offer a greater return as a store 
of value.
Standard of Deferred Payment Money is useful because it can serve as a stan-
dard of deferred payment in borrowing and lending. Money can facilitate exchange at 
a given point in time by providing a medium of exchange and unit of account. Money 
can  facilitate exchange over time by providing a store of value and a standard of deferred 
payment. For example, a computer manufacturer may buy hard drives from another 
firm in exchange for the promise of making payment in 60 days.
How important is it that money be a reliable store of value and standard of de-
ferred payment? People care about how much food, clothing, and other goods and ser-
vices their dollars will buy. The value of money depends on its purchasing power, which 

832 
C H A P T E R  2 5  Money, Banks, and the Federal Reserve System
refers to its ability to buy goods and services. Inflation causes a decline in purchasing 
power because with rising prices, a given amount of money can purchase fewer goods 
and services. When inflation reaches the levels seen in Zimbabwe, money is no longer a 
reliable store of value or standard of deferred payment.
What Can Serve as Money?
Having a medium of exchange helps to make transactions easier, allowing the economy 
to work more efficiently. The next logical question is this: What can serve as money? 
That is, which assets should be used as the medium of exchange? We saw earlier that an 
asset must, at a minimum, be generally accepted as payment to serve as money. In prac-
tical terms, however, it must be even more.
Five criteria make a good suitable for use as a medium of exchange:
 1. The good must be acceptable to (that is, usable by) most people.
 2. It should be of standardized quality so that any two units are identical.
 3. It should be durable so that value is not lost by spoilage.
 4. It should be valuable relative to its weight so that amounts large enough to be useful 
in trade can be easily transported.
 5. The medium of exchange should be divisible because different goods are valued 
differently.
Dollar bills meet all these criteria. What determines the acceptability of dollar bills as 
a medium of exchange? Basically, it is through self-fulfilling expectations: You value some-
thing as money only if you believe that others will accept it from you as payment. A society’s 
willingness to use paper dollars as money makes dollars an acceptable medium of exchange.
Commodity Money Commodity money has value independent of its use as money. 
Gold, for example, was a common form of money in the nineteenth century because it 
was a medium of exchange, a unit of account, a store of value, and a standard of deferred 
payment. But commodity money has a significant problem: Its value depends on its purity. 
Therefore, someone who wanted to cheat could mix impure metals with a precious metal. 
Another problem with using gold as money was that the money supply was difficult to 
control because it depended partly on unpredictable discoveries of new gold fields.
Fiat Money It can be inefficient for an economy to rely on only gold or other pre-
cious metals for its money supply. What if you had to transport bars of gold to settle 
your transactions? Not only would doing so be difficult and costly, but you would run 
the risk of being robbed. To get around this problem, private institutions or govern-
ments began to store gold and issue paper certificates that could be redeemed for gold. 
In modern economies, paper currency is generally issued by a central bank, which is 
an agency of the government that regulates the money supply. The Federal Reserve is 
the central bank of the United States. Today, no government in the world issues pa-
per currency that can be redeemed for gold. Paper currency has no value unless it is 
used as money, and it is therefore not a commodity money. Instead, paper currency is a  
fiat money, which has no value except as money. If paper currency has no value except 
as money, why do consumers and firms use it?
If you look at the top of a U.S. dollar bill, you will see that it is actually a Federal 
Reserve Note, issued by the Federal Reserve. Because U.S. dollars are fiat money, the 
Federal Reserve is not required to give you gold or silver for your dollar bills. Federal 
Reserve currency is legal tender in the United States, which means the federal govern-
ment requires that it be accepted in payment of debts and requires that cash or checks 
denominated in dollars be used in payment of taxes. Despite being legal tender, dollar 
bills would not be a good medium of exchange and could not serve as money if they 
weren’t widely accepted by people. The key to this acceptance is that households and 
firms have confidence that if they accept paper dollars in exchange for goods and services, 
the dollars will not lose much value during the time they hold them. Without this confi-
dence, dollar bills would not serve as a medium of exchange.

How Is Money Measured 
in the United States Today?
A narrow definition of money would include only those assets that obviously function 
as a medium of exchange: currency, checking account deposits, and traveler’s checks. 
These assets can easily be used to buy goods and services and thus act as a medium of 
exchange. This strict interpretation is too narrow, however, as a measure of the money 
supply in the real world. Many other assets can fill the role of a medium of exchange, 
although they are not as liquid as checking account deposits or cash. For example, you 
can convert your savings account at a bank to cash.
In the United States, the Federal Reserve has conducted several studies of the ap-
propriate definition of money. The job of defining the money supply has become more 
difficult during the past two decades, as innovation in financial markets and institutions 
has created new substitutes for traditional checking accounts. Outside the United States, 
other central banks use similar measures. Next, we will look more closely at the Fed’s 
definitions of the money supply.
25.2 LEARNING OBJECTIVE

money supply used in the 
United States today.
Apple Didn’t Want My Cash!
If Federal Reserve Notes are legal tender, doesn’t that mean 
that everyone in the United States, including every business, 
has to accept paper money? The answer 
to this question is “no,” as a woman in 
California found out when she went to an Apple store in Palo Alto 
and tried to buy an iPad using $600 in currency. At that point, 
the iPad had just been released, and Apple did not want to sell 
large numbers to people who were buying them to resell on eBay, 
 Craigslist, or elsewhere. So, a customer wanting to buy an iPad had 
to pay either with a credit card or a debit card, which would make 
it easier for Apple to keep track of anyone attempting to buy more 
than the limit of two per customer.
Because Federal Reserve Notes are legal tender, creditors must 
accept them in payment of debts, and the government will accept 
them in payment of taxes. However, as this incident makes clear, 
firms do not have to accept cash as payment for goods and ser-
vices. As the U.S. Treasury Department explains on its Web site:
There is . . . no Federal statute mandating that a private business, a person or 
an organization must accept currency or coins as payment for goods and/or 
services. . . . For example, a bus line may prohibit payment of fares in pennies 
or dollar bills. In addition, movie theaters, convenience stores and gas stations 
may refuse to accept large denomination currency (usually notes above $20) as 
a matter of policy.
The woman who tried to buy an iPad for cash was disabled and on a limited in-
come, so the incident led to bad publicity for Apple. As a result, Apple decided to lift its 
ban on paying for iPads with cash, provided that the customer was willing to set up an 
Apple account at the time of purchase. In addition, Apple presented a free iPad to the 
customer who was originally turned down when she tried to pay with cash.

M1: The Narrowest Definition of the Money Supply
Figure 25.1 illustrates the definitions of the money supply. The narrowest definition is 
called M1. It includes:
 1. Currency, which is all the paper money and coins that are in circulation, where “in 
circulation” means not held by banks or the government
 2. The value of all checking account deposits at banks
 3. The value of traveler’s checks (Because this last category is so small—about $4.4 bil-
lion in August 2011—relative to the other two categories, we will ignore it in our 
discussion of the money supply.)
Although currency has a larger value than checking account deposits, checking ac-
count deposits are used much more often than currency to make payments. More than 
80 percent of all expenditures on goods and services are made with checks rather than 
with currency. In fact, the total amount of currency in circulation—$977 billion in Au-
gust 2011—is a misleading number. This amount is more than $2,800 per person—adult 
or child—in the United States. If this sounds like an unrealistically large amount of cur-
rency to be held per person, it is. Economists estimate that more than 60 percent of U.S. 
currency is actually outside the borders of the United States.
Who holds these dollars outside the United States? Foreign banks and foreign gov-
ernments hold some dollars, but most are held by households and firms in countries 
where there is not much confidence in the local currency. When inflation rates are very 
high, many households and firms do not want to hold their domestic currency because 
it is losing its value too rapidly. The value of the U.S. dollar will be much more stable 
than their domestic currency. If enough people are willing to accept dollars as well as—
or instead of—domestic currency, dollars become a second currency for the country. As 
we saw in the chapter opener, when inflation soared in Zimbabwe, the government was 
led to adopt the U.S. dollar as the country’s official currency.

Unfortunately, these cost the 
government more than a penny to 
produce.
Do We Still Need the Penny?
We have seen that fiat money has no value except as money. 
Governments actually make a profit from issuing fiat money 
because fiat money is usually produced using paper or low-
value metals that cost far less than the face value of the money. 
For example, it costs only about 4 cents for the federal Bureau of Engraving and Printing 
to manufacture a $20 bill. The government’s profit from issuing fiat money—which is 
equal to the difference between the face value of the money and its production cost—is 
called seigniorage.
With small-denomination coins—like pennies or nickels—there is a possibility  
that the coins will cost more to produce than their face value. This was true in the 
early 1980s, when the rising price of copper meant the federal government was 
spending more than 1 cent to produce a penny. That led the government to switch 
from making pennies from copper to making them from zinc. Unfortunately, by 
2007, the rising price of zinc meant that once again, the penny cost more than 1 cent 
to produce. Although the price of zinc later declined, many economists began to 
ask whether the penny should simply be abolished. Not only does it sometimes cost 
more to produce than it is worth, but inflation has eroded its purchasing power to 
such an extent that some people just find the penny to be a nuisance. Many people 
will not bother to pick up a penny from the sidewalk. In fact, several other coun-
tries, including Great Britain, Australia, and the European countries that use the 
euro, have eliminated their lowest-denomination coins; Canada is also considering 
doing so.
Some economists, though, have argued that eliminating the penny would subject 
consumers to a “rounding tax.” For example, a good that had been priced at $2.99 will 
cost $3.00 if the penny is eliminated. Some estimates have put the cost to consumers of 
the rounding tax as high as $600 million. But Robert Whaples, an economist at Wake 
Forest University, after analyzing almost 200,000 transactions from a convenience store 
chain, concludes that “the ‘rounding tax’ is a myth. In reality, the number of times con-
sumers’ bills would be rounded upward is almost exactly equal to the number of times 
they would be rounded downward.”
François Velde, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, has come up 
with perhaps the most ingenious solution to the problem of the penny: The federal gov-
ernment would simply declare that Lincoln pennies are now worth 5 cents. There would 
then be two 5-cent coins in circulation—the current Jefferson nickels and the current 
Lincoln pennies—and no 1-cent coins. In the future, only the Lincoln coins—now 
worth 5 cents—would be minted. This would solve the problem of consumers and retail 
stores having to deal with pennies, it would make the face value of the Lincoln 5-cent 
coin greater than its cost of production, and it would also deal with the problem that the 
current Jefferson nickel frequently costs more than 5 cents to produce. But will Lincoln 
pennies actually be accepted as being worth 5 cents simply because the government says 
so? The answer is “yes” because as long as the government is willing to exchange 20 
Lincoln coins for a paper dollar, everyone else will be willing to do so as well. Of course, 
if this plan were adopted, anyone with a hoard of pennies would find that their money 
would be worth five times as much overnight!
Whether or not pennies get turned into nickels, it seems very likely that one way or 
another, the penny will eventually disappear from the U.S. money supply.

M2: A Broader Definition of Money
Before 1980, U.S. law prohibited banks from paying interest on checking account de-
posits. Households and firms held checking account deposits primarily to buy goods 
and services. M1 was, therefore, very close to the function of money as a medium of 
exchange. Almost all currency, checking account deposits, and traveler’s checks were 
held with the intention of buying and selling, not with the intention of storing value. In 
1980, the law was changed to allow banks to pay interest on certain types of checking 
accounts. This change reduced the difference between checking accounts and savings 
accounts, although people are still not allowed to write checks against their savings ac-
count balances.
After 1980, economists began to pay closer attention to a broader definition of 
the money supply, M2. As panel (b) of Figure 25.1 shows, M2 includes everything that 
is in M1, plus savings account deposits, small-denomination time deposits—such as 
certificates of deposit (CDs)—balances in money market deposit accounts in banks, 
and noninstitutional money market fund shares. Small-denomination time deposits 
are similar to savings accounts, but the deposits are for a fixed period of time— usually 
from six months to several years—and withdrawals before that time are subject to a 
penalty. Mutual fund companies sell shares to investors and use the funds raised to 
buy financial assets such as stocks and bonds. Some of these mutual funds, such as 
Vanguard’s Treasury Money Market Fund or Fidelity’s Cash Reserves Fund, are called 
money market mutual funds because they invest in very short-term bonds, such as 
U.S. Treasury bills. The balances in these funds are included in M2. Each week, the 
Federal Reserve publishes statistics on M1 and M2. In the discussion that follows, we 
will use the M1 definition of the money supply because it corresponds most closely to 
money as a medium of exchange.
There are two key points to keep in mind about the money supply:
 1. The money supply consists of both currency and checking account deposits.
 2. Because balances in checking account deposits are included in the money supply, 
banks play an important role in the way the money supply increases and decreases. 
We will discuss this second point further in the next section.
M2 A broader definition of the 
money supply: It includes M1 plus 
savings account balances, small-
denomination time deposits, balances 
in money market deposit accounts in 
banks, and noninstitutional money 
market fund shares.
Don’t Confuse Money  
with Income or Wealth
According to Forbes magazine, Bill Gates’s wealth of $56 
billion makes him the second-richest person in the world. 
He also has a very large income, but how much money 
does he have? Your wealth is equal to the value of your as-
sets minus the value of any debts you have. Your income is 
equal to your earnings during the year. Bill Gates’s earn-
ings as chairman of Microsoft and from his investments 
are very large. But his money is just equal to what he has in 
currency and in checking accounts. Only a small propor-
tion of Gates’s $56 billion in wealth is likely to be in cur-
rency or checking accounts. Most of his wealth is invested 
in stocks and bonds and other financial assets that are not 
included in the definition of money.
In everyday conversation, we often describe someone 
who is wealthy or who has a high income as “having a lot 
of money.” But when economists use the word money, they 
are usually referring to currency plus checking account de-
posits. It is important to keep straight the differences be-
tween wealth, income, and money.
Just as money and income are not the same for a per-
son, they are not the same for the whole economy. National 
income in the United States was equal to $12.8 trillion in 
2010. The money supply in 2010 was $1.8 trillion (using 
the M1 measure). There is no reason national income in 
a country should be equal to the country’s money supply, 
nor will an increase in a country’s money supply necessar-
ily increase the country’s national income.

How Do Banks Create Money? 
837
What about Credit Cards and Debit Cards?
Many people buy goods and services with credit cards, yet credit cards are not included 
in definitions of the money supply. The reason is that when you buy something with a 
credit card, you are in effect taking out a loan from the bank that issued the credit card. 
Only when you pay your credit card bill at the end of the month—often with a check 
or an electronic transfer from your checking account—is the transaction complete. In 
contrast, with a debit card, the funds to make the purchase are taken directly from your 
checking account. In either case, the cards themselves do not represent money.
How Do Banks Create Money?
We have seen that the most important component of the money supply is checking accounts 
in banks. To understand the role money plays in the economy, we need to look more closely 
at how banks operate. Banks are profit-making private businesses, just like bookstores and 
supermarkets. Some banks are quite small, with just a few branches, and they do business 
in a limited area. Others are among the largest corporations in the United States, with hun-
dreds of branches spread across many states. The key role that banks play in the economy 
is to accept deposits and make loans. By doing this, they create checking account deposits.
Bank Balance Sheets
To understand how banks create money, we need to briefly examine a typical bank bal-
ance sheet. Recall from Chapter 8 that on a balance sheet, a firm’s assets are listed on the 
left, and its liabilities and stockholders’ equity are listed on the right. Assets are the value 
of anything owned by the firm, liabilities are the value of anything the firm owes, and 
stockholders’ equity is the difference between the total value of assets and the total value 
of liabilities. Stockholders’ equity represents the value of the firm if it had to be closed, 
all its assets were sold, and all its liabilities were paid off. A corporation’s stockholders’ 
equity is also referred to as its net worth.
Figure 25.2 shows the actual balance sheet of a large bank. The key assets on a bank’s 
balance sheet are its reserves, loans, and holdings of securities, such as U.S. Treasury bills.

Solving the Problem
Step 1: Review the chapter material. This problem is about the definitions of the 
money supply, so you may want to review the section “How Is Money Mea-
sured in the United States Today?” which begins on page 833.
Step 2: Use the definitions of M1 and M2 to answer the problem. Funds in check-
ing accounts are included in both M1 and M2. Funds in CDs are included only 
in M2. It is tempting to answer this problem by saying that shifting $2,000 from 
a checking account to a CD reduces M1 by $2,000 and increases M2 by $2,000, 
but the $2,000 in your checking account was already counted in M2. So, the cor-
rect answer is that your action reduces M1 by $2,000 but leaves M2 unchanged.

C H A P T E R  2 5  Money, Banks, and the Federal Reserve System
Reserves are deposits that a bank has retained rather than loaned out or invested. Banks 
keep reserves either physically within the bank, as vault cash, or on deposit with the 
Federal Reserve. Banks are required by law to keep as reserves 10 percent of their check-
ing account deposits above a threshold level, which in 2011 was $58.8 million. These 
reserves are called required reserves. The minimum fraction of deposits that banks 
are required to keep as reserves is called the required reserve ratio. We can abbrevi-
ate the required reserve ratio as RR. Any reserves that banks hold over and above the 
legal  requirement are called excess reserves. The balance sheet in Figure 25.2 shows that 
loans are this bank’s largest asset, which is true of most banks.
Banks make consumer loans to households and commercial loans to businesses. A 
loan is an asset to a bank because it represents a promise by the person taking out the 
loan to make certain specified payments to the bank. A bank’s reserves and its holdings 
of securities are also assets because they are things of value owned by the bank.
As with most banks, this bank’s largest liability is its deposits. Deposits include 
checking accounts, savings accounts, and certificates of deposit. Deposits are liabili-
ties to banks because they are owed to the households or firms that have deposited the 
funds. If you deposit $100 in your checking account, the bank owes you the $100, and 
you can ask for it back at any time. So, your checking account is an asset to you, and it is 
a liability to the bank.
Using T-Accounts to Show How a Bank  
Can Create Money
It is easier to show how banks create money by using a T-account than by using a bal-
ance sheet. A T-account is a stripped-down version of a balance sheet that shows only 
how a transaction changes a bank’s balance sheet. For example, suppose you deposit 
$1,000 in currency into an account at Bank of America. This transaction raises the total 
deposits at Bank of America by $1,000 and also raises its reserves by $1,000. We show 
this on the following T-account:
Your deposit of $1,000 into your 
checking account increases Bank 
of America’s assets and liabilities 
by the same amount.
Assets
Liabilities
Reserves      +$1,000
Deposits      +$1,000
Remember that because the total value of all the entries on the right side of a bal-
ance sheet must always be equal to the total value of all the entries on the left side of a 
balance sheet, any transaction that increases (or decreases) one side of the balance sheet 
must also increase (or decrease) the other side of the balance sheet. In this case, the  
T-account shows that we increased both sides of the balance sheet by $1,000.
Initially, this transaction does not increase the money supply. The currency compo-
nent of the money supply declines by $1,000 because the $1,000 you deposited is no lon-
ger in circulation and, therefore, is not counted in the money supply. But the decrease

in currency is offset by a $1,000 increase in the checking account deposit component of 
the money supply.
This initial change is not the end of the story, however. Banks are required to keep 10 
percent of deposits as reserves. Because the Federal Reserve pays banks only a low rate of 
interest on their reserves, banks have an incentive to loan out or buy securities with the 
other 90 percent. In this case, Bank of America can keep $100 as required reserves and 
loan out the other $900, which represents excess reserves. Suppose Bank of America loans 
out the $900 to someone to buy a very inexpensive used car. Bank of America could give 
the $900 to the borrower in currency, but usually banks make loans by increasing the bor-
rower’s checking account. We can show this with another T-account:
1. By loaning out $900 in 
excess reserves . . .
2. . . . Bank of America 
has increased the 
money supply by $900.
Assets
Liabilities
Reserves 
+$1,000
Loans 
+$900
Deposits 
+$1,000
Deposits 
+$900
A key point to recognize is that by making this $900 loan, Bank of America has 
 increased the money supply by $900. The initial $1,000 in currency you deposited into 
your checking account has been turned into $1,900 in checking account deposits—a net 
increase in the money supply of $900.
But the story does not end here. The person who took out the $900 loan did so to buy 
a used car. To keep things simple, let’s suppose he buys the car for exactly $900 and pays 
by writing a check on his account at Bank of America. The seller of the used car will now 
deposit the check in her bank. That bank may also be a branch of Bank of America, but in 
most cities, there are many banks, so let’s assume that the seller of the car has her account at a 
branch of PNC Bank. Once she deposits the check, PNC Bank will send it to Bank of Amer-
ica to clear the check and collect the $900. We show the result in the following T-accounts:
1. When the $900 check that 
was deposited in a PNC 
account arrives to be cleared, 
the increase in Bank of 
America’s reserves (shown in 
the previous T-account) falls 
by $900, to $100 . . .
2. . . . and the increase in Bank 
of America’s deposits falls by 
$900, to $1,000.

Liabilities
Reserves 
+$100
Loans 
+$900
Deposits      +$1,000

After the check drawn on the 
account at Bank of America 
clears, PNC’s reserves and 
deposits both increase by $900.
Assets
Liabilities
Reserves        +$900
Deposits        +$900
PNC Bank
After the car buyer’s check clears, Bank of America has lost $900 in deposits—the 
amount loaned to the car buyer—and $900 in reserves—the amount it had to pay PNC 
when PNC sent Bank of America the car buyer’s check. PNC has an increase in checking

C H A P T E R  2 5  Money, Banks, and the Federal Reserve System
account deposits of $900—the deposit of the car seller—and an increase in reserves of 
$900—the amount it received from Bank of America.
PNC has 100 percent reserves against this new $900 deposit, when it needs only 10 
percent reserves. The bank has an incentive to keep $90 as reserves and to loan out the 
other $810, which are excess reserves. If PNC does this, we can show the change in its 
balance sheet by using another T-account:
By making an $810 loan, PNC 
has increased both its loans 
and its deposits by $810. 
Assets
Liabilities
Reserves        +$900
Loans             +$810
Deposits        +$900
Deposits        +$810
PNC Bank
In loaning out the $810 in excess reserves, PNC creates a new checking account 
deposit of $810. The initial deposit of $1,000 in currency into Bank of America has now 
resulted in the creation of $1,000 1 $900 1 $810 5 $2,710  in checking account depos-
its. The money supply has increased by $2,710 2 $1,000 5 $1,710.
The process is still not finished. The person who borrows the $810 will spend it by 
writing a check against his account. Whoever receives the $810 will deposit it in her 
bank, which could be a Bank of America branch or a PNC branch or a branch of some 
other bank. That new bank—if it’s not PNC—will send the check to PNC and will re-
ceive $810 in new reserves. That new bank will have an incentive to loan out 90 percent 
of these reserves—keeping 10 percent to meet the legal requirement—and the process 
will go on. At each stage, the additional loans being made and the additional deposits 
being created are shrinking by 10 percent, as each bank has to withhold that amount as 
required reserves. We can use a table to show the total increase in checking account de-
posits set off by your initial deposit of $1,000. The dots in the table represent additional 
rounds in the money creation process:

The Simple Deposit Multiplier
Your initial deposit of $1,000 increased the reserves of the banking system by $1,000 
and led to a total increase in checking account deposits of $10,000. The ratio of the 
amount of deposits created by banks to the amount of new reserves is called the  
simple deposit multiplier. In this case, the simple deposit multiplier is equal to 
$10,000/$1,000 5 10. Why 10? How do we know that your initial $1,000 deposit ulti-
mately leads to a total increase in deposits of $10,000?
There are two ways to answer this question. First, each bank in the process is keep-
ing reserves equal to 10 percent of its deposits. For the banking system as a whole, the 
total increase in reserves is $1,000—the amount of your original currency deposit. 
Therefore, the system as a whole will end up with $10,000 in deposits because $1,000 is 
10 percent of $10,000.
Simple deposit multiplier The ratio 
of the amount of deposits created by 
banks to the amount of new reserves.

 
How Do Banks Create Money? 
841
A second way to answer the question is by deriving an expression for the simple 
deposit multiplier. The total increase in deposits equals:
$1,000 + [0.9 * $1,000] + [(0.9 * 0.9) * $1,000] + [(0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9) * $1,000] + c
or
$1,000 + 30.9 * $1,0004 + [0.92 * $1,000] + [0.93 * $1,000] + c
or
$1,000 + 11 + 0.9 + 0.92 + 0.93 + c 2.
The rules of algebra tell us that an expression like the one in the parentheses sums to:
1
1 - 0.9
.
Simplifying further, we have
1
0.10 = 10.
So
Total increase in deposit = $1,000 * 10 = $10,000.
Note that 10 is equal to 1 divided by the required reserve ratio, RR, which in this case is 
10 percent, or 0.10. This gives us another way of expressing the simple deposit multiplier:
Simple deposit multiplier =
1
RR
.
This formula makes it clear that the higher the required reserve ratio, the smaller the 
simple deposit multiplier. With a required reserve ratio of 10 percent, the simple deposit 
multiplier is 10. If the required reserve ratio were 20 percent, the simple deposit multi-
plier would fall to 1/0.20, or 5. We can use this formula to calculate the total increase in 
checking account deposits from an increase in bank reserves due to, for instance, cur-
rency being deposited in a bank:
Change in checking account deposits = Change in bank reserves *
1
RR
.
For example, if $100,000 in currency is deposited in a bank and the required reserve 
ratio is 10 percent, then
 Change in checking account deposits = $100,000 *
1
0.10
 = $100,000 * 10 = $1,000,000.
Don’t Confuse Assets and Liabilities
Consider the following reasoning: “How can checking ac-
count deposits be a liability to a bank? After all, they are 
something of value that is in the bank. Therefore, checking 
account deposits should be counted as a bank asset rather 
than as a bank liability.”
This statement is incorrect. The balance in a checking 
account represents something the bank owes to the owner 
of the account. Therefore, it is a liability to the bank, al-
though it is an asset to the owner of the account. Similarly, 
your car loan is a liability to you—because it is a debt you 
owe to the bank—but it is an asset to the bank.

Solving the Problem
Step 1: Review the chapter material. This problem is about how banks create check-
ing account deposits, so you may want to review the section “Using T-Accounts 
to Show How a Bank Can Create Money,” which begins on page 838.
Step 2: Answer part a. by using a T-account to show the effect of the deposit. 
Keeping in mind that T-accounts show only the changes in a balance sheet 
that result from the relevant transaction and that assets are on the left side of 
the account and liabilities are on the right side, we have:
Assets
Liabilities
Reserves      +$5,000
Deposits      +$5,000
PNC Bank
Because the bank now has your $5,000 in currency in its vault, its reserves 
(and, therefore, its assets) have risen by $5,000. But this transaction also in-
creases your checking account balance by $5,000. Because the bank owes you 
this money, the bank’s liabilities have also risen by $5,000.
Step 3: Answer part b. by using a T-account to show the effect of the loan. The 
problem tells you to assume that PNC Bank currently has no excess reserves 
and that the required reserve ratio is 10 percent. This requirement means that 
if the bank’s checking account deposits go up by $5,000, the bank must keep 
$500 as reserves and can loan out the remaining $4,500. Remembering that 
new loans usually take the form of setting up, or increasing, a checking ac-
count for the borrower, we have:
Assets
Liabilities
Reserves      +$5,000
Loans 
   +$4,500
Deposits      +$5,000
Deposits 
 +$4,500

Solved Problem 25.3
Showing How Banks Create Money
Suppose you deposit $5,000 in currency into your checking 
account at a branch of PNC Bank, which we will assume has 
no excess reserves at the time you make your deposit. Also 
assume that the required reserve ratio is 0.10.
 
a.  Use a T-account to show the initial effect of this 
transaction on PNC’s balance sheet.
 
b.  Suppose that PNC makes the maximum loan it can 
from the funds you deposited. Use a T-account to 
show the initial effect on PNC’s balance sheet from 
granting the loan. Also include in this T-account 
the transaction from question a.
 
c.  Now suppose that whoever took out the loan in 
question b. writes a check for this amount and 
that the person receiving the check deposits it in 
Bank of America. Show the effect of these trans-
actions on the balance sheets of PNC Bank and 
Bank of America after the check has cleared. On the 
T-account for PNC Bank, include the transactions 
from questions a. and b.
 
d.  What is the maximum increase in checking ac-
count deposits that can result from your $5,000 
deposit? What is the maximum increase in the 
money supply that can result from your deposit? 
Explain.

 
How Do Banks Create Money? 
843
The first line of the T-account shows the transaction from question a. The 
second line shows that PNC has loaned out $4,500 by increasing the check-
ing account of the borrower by $4,500. The loan is an asset to PNC because it 
represents a promise by the borrower to make certain payments spelled out in 
the loan agreement.
Step 4: Answer part c. by using T-accounts for PNC and Bank of America to show 
the effect of the check clearing. We now show the effect of the borrower 
 having spent the $4,500 he received as a loan from PNC. The person who 
received the $4,500 check deposits it in her account at Bank of America. We 
need two T-accounts to show this activity:
Assets
Liabilities
Reserves         +$500
Loans 
   +$4,500
Deposits      +$5,000
Assets
Liabilities
Reserves      +$4,500
Deposits      +$4,500
Bank of America
PNC Bank
Look first at the T-account for PNC. Once Bank of America sends the 
check written by the borrower to PNC, PNC loses $4,500 in reserves, and 
Bank of America gains $4,500 in reserves. The $4,500 is also deducted from 
the account of the borrower. PNC is now satisfied with the result. It received 
a $5,000 deposit in currency from you. When that money was sitting in the 
bank vault, it wasn’t earning any interest for PNC. Now $4,500 of the $5,000 
has been loaned out and is earning interest. These interest payments al-
low PNC to cover its costs and earn a profit, which it has to do to remain in 
business.
Bank of America now has an increase in deposits of $4,500, result-
ing from the check being deposited, and an increase in reserves of $4,500. 
Bank of America is in the same situation as PNC was in question a: It has 
excess reserves as a result of this transaction and a strong incentive to lend 
them out.
Step 5: Answer part d. by using the simple deposit multiplier formula to calculate 
the maximum increase in checking account deposits and the maximum 
increase in the money supply. The simple deposit multiplier expression is 
(remember that RR is the required reserve ratio)
Change in checking account deposits = Change in bank reserves *
1
RR
.
In this case, bank reserves rose by $5,000 as a result of your initial deposit, 
and the required reserve ratio is 0.10, so:
 Change in checking account deposits = $5,000 *
1
0.10
 = $5,000 * 10 = $50,000.
Because checking account deposits are part of the money supply, it is tempt-
ing to say that the money supply has also increased by $50,000. Remem-
ber, though, that your $5,000 in currency was counted as part of the money 

844 
C H A P T E R  2 5  Money, Banks, and the Federal Reserve System
The Simple Deposit Multiplier  
versus the Real-World Deposit Multiplier
The story we have told about the way an increase in reserves in the banking system 
leads to the creation of new deposits and, therefore, an increase in the money supply 
has been simplified in two ways. First, we assumed that banks do not keep any excess 
reserves. That is, we assumed that when you deposited $1,000 in currency into your 
checking account at Bank of America, it loaned out $900, keeping only the $100 in 
required reserves. In fact, banks often keep some excess reserves to guard against 
the possibility that many depositors may simultaneously make withdrawals from 
their  accounts. During the financial crisis that began in 2007, banks kept substantial 
 excess reserves. The more excess reserves banks keep, the smaller the deposit multi-
plier. Imagine an extreme case in which Bank of America keeps your entire $1,000 as  
 reserves. If Bank of America does not loan out any of your deposit, the process 
 described earlier—loans leading to the creation of new deposits, leading to the 
making of additional loans, and so on—will not take place. The $1,000 increase in 
 reserves will lead to a total increase of $1,000 in deposits, and the deposit multiplier 
will be only 1, not 10.
Second, we assumed that the whole amount of every check is deposited in a bank; 
no one takes any of it out as currency. In reality, households and firms keep roughly con-
stant the amount of currency they hold relative to the value of their checking account 
balances. So, we would expect to see people increasing the amount of currency they 
hold as the balances in their checking accounts rise. Once again, think of the extreme 
case. Suppose that when Bank of America makes the initial $900 loan to the borrower 
who wants to buy a used car, the seller of the car cashes the check instead of deposit-
ing it. In that case, PNC does not receive any new reserves and does not make any new 
loans. Once again, the $1,000 increase in your checking account at Bank of America is 
the only increase in deposits, and the deposit multiplier is 1.
The effect of these two factors is to reduce the real-world deposit multiplier to 
about 2.5 during normal times. This means that a $1 increase in the reserves of the 
banking system results in about a $2.50 increase in deposits. During the financial crisis 
of 2007–2009, the surge in bank holdings of excess reserves reduced the multiplier to 
about 1.
Although the story of the deposit multiplier can be complicated, the key point 
to bear in mind is that the most important part of the money supply is the checking 
 account balance component. When banks make loans, they increase checking account 
balances, and the money supply expands. Banks make new loans whenever they gain 
reserves. The whole process can also work in reverse: If banks lose reserves, they reduce 
their outstanding loans and deposits, and the money supply contracts.
We can summarize these important conclusions:
 1. When banks gain reserves, they make new loans, and the money supply expands.
 2. When banks lose reserves, they reduce their loans, and the money supply contracts.
supply while you had it, but it is not included when it is sitting in a bank vault. 
Therefore:
Increase in checking account deposits - Decline in currency in 
circulation = Change in the money supply 
or
$50,000 - $5,000 = $45,000.

The Federal Reserve System 
845
The Federal Reserve System
Many people are surprised to learn that banks do not keep locked away in their vaults 
all the funds that are deposited in checking accounts. The United States, like nearly all 
other countries, has a fractional reserve banking system, which means that banks keep 
less than 100 percent of deposits as reserves. When people deposit money in a bank, the 
bank loans most of the money to someone else. What happens, though, if depositors 
want their money back? This would seem to be a problem because banks have loaned 
out most of the money and can’t easily get it back.
In practice, though, withdrawals are usually not a problem for banks. On a typi-
cal day, about as much money is deposited as is withdrawn. If a small amount more is 
withdrawn than deposited, banks can cover the difference from their excess reserves or 
by borrowing from other banks. Sometimes depositors lose confidence in a bank when 
they question the value of the bank’s underlying assets, particularly its loans. Often, the 
reason for a loss of confidence is bad news, whether true or false. When many deposi-
tors simultaneously decide to withdraw their money from a bank, there is a bank run. 
If many banks experience runs at the same time, the result is a bank panic. It is possible 
for one bank to handle a run by borrowing from other banks, but if many banks simul-
taneously experience runs, the banking system may be in trouble.
A central bank, like the Federal Reserve in the United States, can help stop a bank 
panic by acting as a lender of last resort. In acting as a lender of last resort, a central bank 
makes loans to banks that cannot borrow funds elsewhere. The banks can use these 
loans to pay off depositors. When the panic ends and the depositors put their money 
back in their accounts, the banks can repay the loans to the central bank.
The Establishment of the Federal  
Reserve System
Bank panics lead to severe disruptions in business activity because households and 
firms have trouble gaining access to their accounts and may be unable to borrow 
money. Not surprisingly, in the United States, each bank panic in the late nineteenth 
and early twentieth centuries was accompanied by a recession. With the intention of 
putting an end to bank panics, in 1913, Congress passed the Federal Reserve Act, set-
ting up the Federal Reserve System—often referred to as “the Fed.” The system began 
operation in 1914, with the authority to make loans to banks. The loans the Fed makes 
to banks are called discount loans, and the interest rate it charges on the loans is called 
the discount rate. When a bank receives a loan from the Fed, its reserves increase by 
the amount of the loan.
The Fed’s first test as a lender of last resort came in the early years of the Great 
Depression of the 1930s, when many banks were hit by bank runs as depositors pulled 
funds out of checking and savings accounts. Although the Fed had been established to 
act as a lender of last resort, Fed officials declined to make loans to many banks because 
the officials were worried that banks experiencing runs had made bad loans and other 
investments. The Fed believed that making loans to banks that were in financial trouble 
because of bad investments might reduce the incentive bank managers had to be careful 
in their investment decisions. Partly due to the Fed’s unwillingness to act as a lender of 
last resort, more than 5,000 banks failed during the early 1930s. Today, many econo-
mists are critical of the Fed’s decisions in the early 1930s because they believe these deci-
sions increased the severity of the Great Depression. In 1934, Congress established the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to insure deposits in most banks up to 
a limit, which is currently $250,000 per deposit. Deposit insurance has greatly reduced 
bank runs because it has reassured all but the largest depositors that their deposits are 
safe, even if their bank goes out of business. During the financial crisis of 2007–2009, 
some banks experienced runs when depositors with funds exceeding the deposit insur-
ance limit feared that they would suffer losses if their banks failed.
To aid the Fed in carrying out its responsibilities, in 1913 Congress divided the 
country into 12 Federal Reserve districts, as shown in Figure 25.3. Each district has its

own Federal Reserve bank, which provides services to banks in that district. The real 
power of the Fed, however, lies in Washington, DC, with the Board of Governors. The 
seven members of the Board of Governors are appointed by the president of the United 
States to 14-year, nonrenewable terms. One member of the Board of Governors is cho-
sen to be chair and serves a 4-year, renewable term. In 2012, the chair of the Board of 
Governors was Ben Bernanke. In addition to acting as a lender of last resort to banks, 
the Fed acts as a bankers’ bank, providing services such as check clearing to banks, and 
also has the responsibility of managing the nation’s money supply.
How the Federal Reserve Manages 
the Money Supply
Although Congress established the Fed primarily to stop bank panics by acting as a 
lender of last resort, today the Fed is also responsible for managing the money supply. 
As we will discuss in more detail in Chapter 26, managing the money supply is part of 
monetary policy, which the Fed undertakes to pursue macroeconomic objectives. To 
manage the money supply, the Fed uses three monetary policy tools:
 1. Open market operations
 2. Discount policy
 3. Reserve requirements

Remember that the most important component of the money supply is checking ac-
count deposits. Not surprisingly, all three of the Fed’s policy tools are aimed at affecting 
the reserves of banks as a means of changing the volume of checking account deposits.
Open Market Operations Eight times per year, the Federal Open Market Com-
mittee (FOMC) meets in Washington, DC, to discuss monetary policy. The committee 
has 12 voting members: the 7 members of the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors, 
the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and 4 presidents from the other  
11 Federal Reserve banks. These 4 presidents serve one-year rotating terms on the 
FOMC. The chair of the Board of Governors also serves as the chair of the FOMC.
The U.S. Treasury borrows money by selling bills, notes, and bonds. Remember 
that the maturity of a financial asset is the period of time until the purchaser receives 
payment of the face value or principal. Usually, bonds have face values of $1,000. Trea-
sury bills have maturities of 1 year or less, Treasury notes have maturities of 2 years to 
10 years, and Treasury bonds have maturities of 30 years. To increase the money supply, 
the FOMC directs the trading desk, located at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, 
to buy U.S. Treasury securities—most frequently bills, but sometimes notes or bonds—
from the public. When the sellers of the Treasury securities deposit the funds in their 
banks, the reserves of banks rise. This increase in reserves starts the process of increas-
ing loans and checking account deposits that increases the money supply. To decrease 
the money supply, the FOMC directs the trading desk to sell Treasury securities. When 
the buyers of the Treasury securities pay for them with checks, the reserves of their 
banks fall. This decrease in reserves starts a contraction of loans and checking account 
deposits that reduces the money supply. The buying and selling of Treasury securities is 
called open market operations.
There are three reasons the Fed conducts monetary policy principally through open 
market operations. First, because the Fed initiates open market operations, it completely 
controls their volume. Second, the Fed can make both large and small open market 
operations. Third, the Fed can implement its open market operations quickly, with no 
administrative delay or required changes in regulations. Many other central banks, in-
cluding the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan, also use open market opera-
tions to conduct monetary policy.
The Federal Reserve is responsible for putting the paper currency of the United 
States into circulation. Recall that if you look at the top of a dollar bill, you see the words 
“Federal Reserve Note.” When the Fed takes actions to increase the money supply, 
commentators sometimes say that it is “printing more money.” The main way the Fed 
increases the money supply, however, is not by printing more currency but by buying 
Treasury securities. Similarly, to reduce the money supply, the Fed does not set fire to 
stacks of paper currency. Instead, it sells Treasury securities. We will spend more time 
discussing how and why the Fed manages the money supply in Chapter 26, when we 
discuss monetary policy.
Discount Policy As we have seen, when a bank borrows money from the Fed by 
taking out a discount loan, the interest rate the bank pays is known as the discount rate. 
By lowering the discount rate, the Fed can encourage banks to take additional loans 
and thereby increase their reserves. With more reserves, banks will make more loans 
to households and firms, which will increase checking account deposits and the money 
supply. Raising the discount rate will have the reverse effect.
Reserve Requirements When the Fed reduces the required reserve ratio, it converts 
required reserves into excess reserves. For example, suppose a bank has $100 million in 
checking account deposits, and the required reserve ratio is 10 percent. The bank will 
be required to hold $10 million as reserves. If the Fed reduces the required reserve ratio 
to 8 percent, the bank will need to hold only $8 million as reserves. The Fed can thereby 
convert $2 million worth of reserves from required reserves to excess reserves. This $2 
million is then available for the bank to lend out. If the Fed raises the required reserve 
ratio from 10 percent to 12 percent, it will have the reverse effect.

market operations and managing the

and selling of Treasury securities

848 
C H A P T E R  2 5  Money, Banks, and the Federal Reserve System
The Fed changes reserve requirements much more rarely than it conducts open 
 market operations or changes the discount rate. Because changes in reserve require-
ments require significant alterations in banks’ holdings of loans and securities, frequent 
changes would be disruptive. Also, because the Fed pays banks only a low interest rate 
on  reserves, the use of reserve requirements to manage the money supply effectively 
places a tax on banks’ deposit-taking and lending activities, which can be costly for the 
economy.
The “Shadow Banking System” and the Financial 
Crisis of 2007–2009
The banks we have been discussing in this chapter are commercial banks, whose most 
important economic role is to accept funds from depositors and lend those funds to 
borrowers. In Chapter 8, we noted that large firms can sell stocks and bonds on finan-
cial markets but that investors are typically unwilling to buy stocks and bonds from 
small and medium-sized firms because they lack sufficient information on the financial 
health of smaller firms. So, smaller firms—and households—have traditionally relied on 
bank loans for their credit needs. In the past 20 years, however, two important develop-
ments have occurred in the financial system: (1) Banks have begun to resell many of 
their loans rather than keep them until they are paid off, and (2) financial firms other 
than commercial banks have become sources of credit to businesses.
Securitization Comes to Banking Traditionally, when a bank made a residential 
mortgage loan to a household to buy a home or made a commercial loan to a business, 
the bank would keep the loan and collect the payments until the loan was paid off. A 
financial asset—such as a loan or a stock or a bond—is considered a security if it can 
be bought and sold in a financial market as, for instance, shares of stock issued by the 
Coca-Cola Company can be bought and sold on the New York Stock Exchange. When a 
financial asset is first sold, the sale takes place in the primary market. Subsequent sales 
take place in the secondary market. Prior to 1970, most loans were not securities because 
they could not be resold—there was no secondary market for them. First, residential 
mortgages and then other loans, including car loans and commercial loans, began to be 
securitized. The process of securitization involves creating a secondary market in which 
loans that have been bundled together can be bought and sold in financial markets, just 
as corporate or government bonds are. Figure 25.4 outlines the securitization process.

849
We will discuss the process of securitization further in Chapter 26, when we discuss 
monetary policy.
The Shadow Banking System In addition to the changes resulting from securiti-
zation, the financial system was transformed in the 1990s and 2000s by the increasing 
importance of nonbank financial firms. Investment banks, such as Goldman Sachs and 
Morgan Stanley, differ from commercial banks in that they do not accept deposits, and 
they rarely lend directly to households. Instead, investment banks traditionally concen-
trated on providing advice to firms issuing stocks and bonds or considering mergers 
with other firms. In the late 1990s, investment banks expanded their buying of mort-
gages, bundling large numbers of them together as bonds known as mortgage-backed 
securities, and reselling them to investors. Mortgage-backed securities proved very pop-
ular with investors because they often paid higher interest rates than other securities 
with comparable default risk.
Money market mutual funds have also increased their importance in the finan-
cial system over time. These funds sell shares to investors and use the money to buy 
short-term securities such as Treasury bills and commercial paper issued by corpora-
tions. Commercial paper represents short-term borrowing corporations use to fund 
their day-to-day operations. Many corporations that previously met such needs by 
borrowing from banks began instead to sell commercial paper to money market mu-
tual funds.
Hedge funds raise money from wealthy investors and use sophisticated investment 
strategies that often involve significant risk. By 2005, hedge funds had become an im-
portant source of demand for securitized loans and an important source of loans to 
other financial firms.
In 2008, Timothy Geithner, who became Treasury secretary in the Obama admin-
istration, referred to investment banks, money market mutual funds, hedge funds, and 
other financial firms engaged in similar activities as the “shadow banking system.” By 
raising money from individual investors and providing it directly or indirectly to firms 
and households, these firms were carrying out a function that at one time was almost 
exclusively the domain of commercial banks.
The Financial Crisis of 2007–2009 The firms in the shadow banking system dif-
fered from commercial banks in two important ways: First, the government agencies—
including the Federal Reserve—that regulated the commercial banking system did 
not regulate these firms. Second, these firms were more highly leveraged—that is, they 
 relied more heavily on borrowed money to finance their operations—than were com-
mercial banks. If a firm uses a small amount of its own money and a lot of  borrowed 
money to make an investment, both the firm’s potential profits and its potential losses 
are increased. For example, suppose a firm invests $100 of its own money. If the invest-
ment earns a return of $3, the firm has earned 3 percent ($3/$100) on its funds. But if 
the firm’s investment consists of $10 of its own money and $90 it has borrowed, a return 
of $3 becomes a return of 30 percent ($3/$10) on the firm’s $10 investment. If the invest-
ment loses $2, however, the firm’s return is −20 percent (−$2/$10). Leveraged invest-
ments have a potential for both large gains and large losses.
As mentioned earlier, commercial banks have rarely experienced runs since Con-
gress established federal deposit insurance in the 1930s. However, beginning in 2007, 
firms in the shadow banking system were quite vulnerable to runs. As we will discuss 
further in Chapter 26, the underlying cause of the financial crisis of 2007–2009 was 
problems in the U.S. housing market. As housing prices began to fall, a significant num-
ber of borrowers began to default on their mortgages, which caused mortgage-backed 
securities to lose value. Financial firms, including both commercial banks and many 
firms in the shadow banking system, that had invested in these securities suffered heavy 
losses. The more leveraged the firm, the larger the losses. Although deposit insurance 
helped commercial banks avoid runs, investment banks and other financial firms that 

850 
C H A P T E R  2 5  Money, Banks, and the Federal Reserve System
had borrowed short term and invested the funds long term were in trouble. As lenders 
refused to renew their short-term loans, many of these firms had to sell their holdings 
of securities in an attempt to raise cash. But as the prices of these securities continued to 
fall, the losses to these firms increased.
In the spring of 2008, the investment bank Bear Stearns was saved from bank-
ruptcy only when the Federal Reserve arranged for it to be acquired by JPMorgan 
Chase. In the fall of 2008, the Federal Reserve and the U.S. Treasury decided not to 
take action to save the investment bank Lehman Brothers, which failed. The failure 
of Lehman Brothers reverberated throughout the financial system, setting off a panic. 
The process of securitization—apart from government-guaranteed residential mort-
gages—ground to a halt. The well-publicized difficulties of a money market mutual 
fund that had suffered losses on loans to Lehman Brothers led to a wave of withdrawals 
from these funds. In turn, the funds were no longer able to fulfill their role as buyers 
of corporate commercial paper. As banks and other financial firms sold assets and cut 
back on lending to shore up their financial positions, the flow of funds from savers to 
borrowers was disrupted. The resulting credit crunch significantly worsened the reces-
sion that had begun in December 2007.
The Fed’s Response The Fed, in combination with the U.S. Treasury, took vigor-
ous action to deal with the financial panic. We will discuss the Fed’s actions further in 
Chapter 27, but for now, we can mention several particularly important policy actions. 
First, in the fall of 2008, under the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), the Fed and 
Treasury began attempting to stabilize the commercial banking system by providing 
funds to banks in exchange for stock. Taking partial ownership of private commercial 
banks was an unprecedented move by the federal government. The Fed also modified 
its discount policy by setting up several new “lending facilities.” These lending facilities  
made it possible for the Fed to grant discount loans to financial firms—such as in-
vestment banks—that had not previously been eligible. In addition, the Fed addressed 
problems in the commercial paper market by directly buying commercial paper for the 
first time since the 1930s.
Although the recession continued into 2009, the extraordinary actions of the 
Treasury and Fed appeared to have stabilized the financial system. Still, even by late 
2011, the flow of funds from savers to borrowers had not yet returned to normal 
levels, and economists and policymakers were debating the wisdom of some of the 
Fed’s actions. We will return to the Fed’s response to the recession of 2007–2009 in 
Chapter 26.
The Quantity Theory of Money
People have been aware of the connection between increases in the money supply and 
inflation for centuries. In the sixteenth century, the Spanish conquered Mexico and Peru 
and shipped large quantities of gold and silver from those countries back to Spain. The 
gold and silver were minted into coins and spent across Europe to further the political 
ambitions of the Spanish kings. Prices in Europe rose steadily during these years, and 
many observers discussed the relationship between this inflation and the flow of gold 
and silver into Europe from the Americas.
Connecting Money and Prices:  
The Quantity Equation
In the early twentieth century, Irving Fisher, an economist at Yale, formalized the con-
nection between money and prices by using the quantity equation:
M * V = P * Y.
The quantity equation states that the money supply (M) multiplied by the velocity of 
money (V) equals the price level (P) multiplied by real output (Y). Fisher defined the 
25.5 LEARNING OBJECTIVE

money and use it to explain 
how high rates of inflation 
occur.

 
The Quantity Theory of Money 
851
velocity of money, often referred to simply as “velocity,” as the average number of times 
each dollar of the money supply is used to purchase goods and services included in 
GDP. Rewriting the original equation by dividing both sides by M, we have the equation 
for velocity:
V = P * Y
M
.
If we use M1 to measure the money supply, the GDP price deflator to measure the price 
level, and real GDP to measure real output, the value for velocity for 2010 was
V = 1.11 * +13,088 billion
+1,832 billion
= 7.9.
This result tells us that, on average during 2010, each dollar of M1 was spent about eight 
times on goods or services included in GDP.
Because velocity is defined to be equal to 1P * Y2 >M, we know that the quantity 
equation must always hold true: The left side must be equal to the right side. A theory is 
a statement about the world that might possibly be false. Therefore, the quantity equa-
tion is not a theory. Irving Fisher turned the quantity equation into the quantity theory 
of money by asserting that velocity was constant. He argued that the average number of 
times a dollar is spent depends on how often people get paid, how often they do their 
grocery shopping, how often businesses mail bills, and other factors that do not change 
very often. Because this assertion may be true or false, the quantity theory of money is, 
in fact, a theory.
The Quantity Theory Explanation of Inflation
The quantity equation gives us a way of showing the relationship between changes in 
the money supply and changes in the price level, or inflation. To see this relationship 
more clearly, we can use a handy mathematical rule that states that an equation where 
variables are multiplied together is equal to an equation where the growth rates of these 
variables are added together. So, we can transform the quantity equation from
M * V = P * Y
to
Growth rate of the money supply + Growth rate of velocity =
Growth rate of the price level (or inflation rate) + Growth rate of real output.
This way of writing the quantity equation is more useful for investigating the effect of 
changes in the money supply on the inflation rate. Remember that the growth rate for 
any variable is the percentage change in the variable from one year to the next. The 
growth rate of the price level is the inflation rate, so we can rewrite the quantity equa-
tion to help understand the factors that determine inflation:
Inflation rate = Growth rate of the money supply +
Growth rate of velocity - Growth rate of real output.
If Irving Fisher was correct that velocity is constant, then the growth rate of velocity 
will be zero. That is, if velocity is, say, always eight, then its percentage change from one 
year to the next will always be zero. This assumption allows us to rewrite the equation 
one last time:
Inflation rate = Growth rate of the money supply - Growth rate of real output.
This equation leads to the following predictions:
 1. If the money supply grows at a faster rate than real GDP, there will be inflation.
 2. If the money supply grows at a slower rate than real GDP, there will be deflation. 
(Recall that deflation is a decline in the price level.)
 3. If the money supply grows at the same rate as real GDP, the price level will be stable, 
and there will be neither inflation nor deflation.
Velocity of money The average 
number of times each dollar in the 
money supply is used to purchase 
goods and services included in GDP.
Quantity theory of money A theory 
about the connection between money 
and prices that assumes that the 
velocity of money is constant.

852 
C H A P T E R  2 5  Money, Banks, and the Federal Reserve System
It turns out that Irving Fisher was wrong in asserting that the velocity of money is con-
stant. From year to year, there can be significant fluctuations in velocity. As a result, the 
predictions of the quantity theory of money do not hold every year, but most econo-
mists agree that the quantity theory provides useful insight into the long-run relation-
ship between the money supply and inflation: In the long run, inflation results from the 
money supply growing at a faster rate than real GDP.
How Accurate Are Estimates of Inflation Based  
on the Quantity Theory?
Note that the accuracy of the quantity theory depends on whether the key assumption 
that velocity is constant is correct. If velocity is not constant, then there may not be a 
tight link between increases in the money supply and increases in the price level. For 
example, an increase in the quantity of money might be offset by a decline in  velocity, 
leaving the price level unaffected. Because velocity can move erratically in the short 
run, we would not expect the quantity equation to provide good forecasts of inflation 
in the short run. Over the long run, however, there is a strong link between changes 
in the money supply and inflation. Panel (a) of Figure 25.5 shows the relationship be-
tween the growth of the M2 measure of the money supply and the inflation rate by 
decade in the United States. (We use M2 here because data on M2 are available for 
a longer period of time than for M1.) Because of variations in the rate of growth of 
real GDP and in velocity, there is not an exact relationship between the growth rate of 
M2 and the inflation rate. But there is a clear pattern that decades with higher growth 
rates in the money supply were also decades with higher inflation rates. In other words, 
most of the variation in inflation rates across decades can be explained by variation in 
the rates of growth of the money supply.
Panel (b) provides further evidence consistent with the quantity theory by looking 
at rates of growth of the money supply and rates of inflation across countries for the 
decade from 1999 to 2008. Although there is not an exact relationship between rates

of growth of the money supply and rates of inflation across countries, panel (b) shows 
that countries where the money supply grew rapidly tended to have high inflation rates, 
while countries where the money supply grew more slowly tended to have much lower 
inflation rates. Not included in panel (b) are data for the African country of Zimbabwe, 
which we mentioned at the beginning of the chapter. Over this decade, the money sup-
ply in Zimbabwe grew by more than 7,500 percent per year. The result was an accelerat-
ing rate of inflation that eventually reached 15 billion percent during 2008. Zimbabwe 
was suffering from hyperinflation—that is, a rate of inflation that exceeds 100 percent 
per year.
High Rates of Inflation
Why do governments allow high rates of inflation? The quantity theory can help us to 
understand the reasons for high rates of inflation, such as that experienced by Zim-
babwe. Very high rates of inflation—in excess of 100 percent per year—are known as 
hyperinflation. Hyperinflation is caused by central banks increasing the money supply at 
a rate far in excess of the growth rate of real GDP. A high rate of inflation causes money 
to lose its value so rapidly that households and firms avoid holding it. If, as happened in 
Zimbabwe, the inflation becomes severe enough, people stop using paper currency, so 
it no longer serves the important functions of money discussed earlier in this chapter. 
Economies suffering from high inflation usually also suffer from very slow growth, if 
not severe recession.
Given the dire consequences that follow from high inflation, why do governments 
cause it by expanding the money supply so rapidly? The main reason is that govern-
ments often want to spend more than they are able to raise through taxes. Developed 
countries, such as the United States, can usually bridge gaps between spending and taxes 
by borrowing through selling bonds to the public. Developing countries, such as Zim-
babwe, often have difficulty selling bonds because investors are skeptical of their ability 
to pay back the money. If they are unable to sell bonds to the public, governments in 
developing countries will force their central banks to purchase them. As we discussed 
previously, when a central bank buys bonds, the money supply will increase.
The German Hyperinflation  
of the Early 1920s
When Germany lost World War I, a revolution broke out that 
overthrew Kaiser Wilhelm II and installed a new government 
known as the Weimar Republic. In the peace treaty of 1919, the Allies—the United 
States, Great Britain, France, and Italy—imposed payments called reparations on the 
new German government. The reparations were meant as compensation to the Allies for 
the damage Germany had caused during the war. It was very difficult for the German 
government to use tax revenue to cover both its normal spending and the reparations.
The German government decided to pay for the difference between its spending 
and its tax revenues by selling bonds to the central bank, the Reichsbank. After a few 
years, the German government fell far behind in its reparations payments. In January 
1923, the French government sent troops into the German industrial area known as 
the Ruhr to try to collect the payments directly. German workers in the Ruhr went on 
strike, and the German government decided to support them by paying their salaries. 
Raising the funds to do so was financed by an inflationary monetary policy: The Ger-
man government sold bonds to the Reichsbank, thereby increasing the money supply.
The inflationary increase in the money supply was very large: The total number of 
marks—the German currency—in circulation rose from 115 million in January 1922 to 
1.3 billion in January 1923 and then to 497 billion billion, or 497,000,000,000,000,000,000, 
in December 1923. Just as the quantity theory predicts, the result was a staggeringly 
high rate of inflation. The German price index that stood at 100 in 1914 and 1,440 in 
January 1922 had risen to 126,160,000,000,000 in December 1923. The German mark

Economics in Your Life
What if Money Became Increasingly Valuable?
At the beginning of the chapter, we asked you to consider whether you would like to live in an 
economy in which the purchasing power of money rises every year. The first thing to consider 
when thinking about the advantages and disadvantages of this situation is that the only way for 
the purchasing power of money to increase is for the price level to fall; in other words, deflation 
must occur. Because the price level in the United States hasn’t fallen for an entire year since the 
1930s, most people alive today have experienced only rising price levels—and declining purchas-
ing power of money. Would replacing rising prices with falling prices necessarily be a good thing? 
It might be tempting to say “yes,” because if you have a job, your salary will buy more goods and 
services each year. But, in fact, just as a rising price level results in most wages and salaries rising 
each year, a falling price level is likely to mean falling wages and salaries each year. So, it is likely 
that, on average, people would not see the purchasing power of their incomes increase, even if 
the purchasing power of any currency they hold would increase. There can also be a significant 
downside to deflation, particularly if the transition from inflation to deflation happens suddenly. 
In Chapter 20, we defined the real interest rate as being equal to the nominal interest rate minus 
the inflation rate. If an economy experiences deflation, then the real interest rate will be greater 
than the nominal interest rate. A rising real interest rate can be bad news for anyone who has bor-
rowed, including homeowners who may have substantial mortgage loans. So, you are probably 
better off living in an economy experiencing mild inflation than one experiencing deflation.
became worthless. The German government ended the hyperinflation by (1) negotiat-
ing a new agreement with the Allies that reduced its reparations payments, (2) reducing 
other government expenditures and raising taxes to balance its budget, and (3) replac-
ing the existing mark with a new mark. Each new mark was worth 1 trillion old marks. 
The German central bank was also limited to issuing a total of 3.2 billion new marks.
These steps were enough to bring the hyperinflation to an end—but not before 
the savings of anyone holding the old marks had been wiped out. Most middle-income 
Germans were extremely resentful of this outcome. Many historians believe that the 
hyperinflation greatly reduced the allegiance of many Germans to the Weimar Republic 
and may have helped pave the way for Adolph Hitler and the Nazis to seize power 10 
years later.

Conclusion
Money plays a key role in the functioning of an economy by facilitating trade in goods 
and services and by making specialization possible. Without specialization, no advanced 
economy can prosper. Households and firms, banks, and the central bank (the Federal 
Reserve in the United States) are participants in the process of creating the money sup-
ply. In Chapter 26, we will explore how the Federal Reserve uses monetary policy to 
promote its economic objectives.
An Inside Look at Policy on the next page discusses how an increase in bank lending 
to consumers and businesses is a positive signal for the economy.

June, according to the National Fed-
eration of Independent Business.
 Banks are also warming to con-
sumer loans. Despite sluggish job 
markets, households have made great 
progress in getting their financial 
obligations under control, allowing 
qualified borrowers to take on more 
debt. So far this year, monthly finan-
cial obligations of households have 
fallen to only 16.4 percent of house-
hold income, the lowest since 1994. In 
the second quarter, the percentage of 
banks reporting increased demand for 
auto loans was the highest since 2003.
Banks began easing lending stan-
dards for auto loans, credit cards, and 
other borrowing this time last year. In 
the 2011 second quarter the percent-
age of loan officers saying they were 
more willing to make consumer loans 
rose to the highest level in 17 years. . . .
 The ebb and flow of bank lend-
ing during recessions and recoveries 
exerts a powerful force on any busi-
ness cycle. Aside from this cycle’s 
problems in mortgage lending, banks 
are finally beginning to behave as they 
usually do in a recovery. Barring some 
new shock, especially from the debt 
troubles in Washington or Europe, 
evidence that loan growth is begin-
ning to expand in response to easier 
lending standards and stronger loan 
demand is a key sign that the recovery 
has staying power.

quarters. Small companies have seen 
easier terms and conditions in each 
of the past four quarters. Economists 
expect to see signs that this loosen-
ing in standards is continuing when 
the Fed issues it third-quarter report 
from bank senior loan officers in 
mid-August.
More credit is starting to flow to 
small businesses, as well. That’s im-
portant, because small firms account 
for about half of U.S. job creation, and 
depend greatly on banks for credit, 
unlike large corporations that have 
the option to raise funds in the capi-
tal markets by issuing bonds. In the 
second quarter, the balance of banks 
reporting stronger vs. weaker demand 
for commercial and industrial (C&I) 
loans by small businesses was positive 
for the first time in five years, accord-
ing to the latest Fed survey. Another 
positive sign is the gradual rise in C&I 
loans made by small banks, whose 
customers tend to be small local com-
panies. Small-bank C&I loan volume 
has been rising gradually in 2011 after 
hitting bottom late last year.
Despite increased attention by 
policymakers over the past year to 
the dearth of small business lending, 
the problem has been not so much 
banks’ unwillingness to lend but sim-
ply a lack of loan demand, reflecting 
weak sales. Although the percentage 
of small companies saying credit is 
harder to get is still somewhat higher 
than before the recession, it has fallen 
steadily over the past two years, from 
a peak of 16 percent, to 9 percent in

The financial crisis of 2008 rocked the 
foundation of the U.S. banking sector. 
The shock left banks short of capital 
and hesitant to lend, even as the re-
cession cut deeply into loan demand. 
The Federal Reserve has pumped in 
an ocean of lendable funds, trying to 
prime the process of bringing banks 
and borrowers together. But many still 
wonder when, if ever, bank lending 
will return to normal.
We’re not there yet, but recent 
signs have been encouraging. Despite 
the sluggish economy, loan growth is 
finally beginning to pick up in key ar-
eas, reflecting both greater willingness 
to lend and increased desire to bor-
row. Loan volume of U.S. commercial 
banks rose at a one percent annual 
rate in June as expansion in business 
loans and non-mortgage consumer 
lending more than offset the ongoing 
contraction in real estate financing. 
It was the third consecutive monthly 
increase after steady declines for more 
than two years. . . .
 Lending to businesses is lead-
ing the credit upswing. The volume 
of commercial and industrial (C&I) 
loans in the second quarter rose at 
a 9.6 percent annual rate, the larg-
est increase in 2½ years. Banks have 
progressively eased lending standards 
for C&I loans to large and medium-
sized companies for the past six

results in a multiple increase in bank depos-
its. In an attempt to bring lenders and bor-
rowers together following the financial crisis 
of 2008, the Federal Reserve made a large 
amount of new funds available to financial 
markets. These extra funds had the poten-
tial to affect the economy as banks, re-
sponding to an increase in demand,  finally 
began to see an increase in loans in 2011. 
The increases in excess reserves, bank de-
posits, and loan volume are indications that 
the economy was in the expansion phase of 
the business cycle and were positive signs 
for continued economic recovery.

About Policy
1. During the financial crisis of 2007–2009, 
the Fed attempted to stimulate the 
economy by taking actions to increase 
the money supply. How effective would 
these actions be if banks remained re-
luctant to make consumer loans while 
households remained reluctant to obtain 
loans? Briefly explain.

that a large increase in the money sup-

businesses. Rising defaults on home loans 
after the housing bubble burst led to the 
collapse of a number of financial intermedi-
aries in 2008, and loan volume declined for 
more than two years. Growth in the market 
for loans reemerged in the second quarter 
of 2011, with business loans leading the up-
swing. Commercial and industrial loans 
rose at an annual rate of 9.6 percent as 
banks continued to loosen lending require-
ments for small, medium, and large compa-
nies. As Figure 1 below shows, the 
percentage change in commercial and in-
dustrial bank loans turned positive toward 
the end of 2010, and it accelerated for 
much of the second quarter of 2011.
b Loans to consumers began to increase 
in mid-2011. Following the collapse of 
financial markets in 2008, banks were much 
less willing to make consumer loans, in-
creasing their lending standards as house-
holds’ financial obligations grew. The 
decrease in the supply of funds available to 
households was met with a decrease in the 
demand for these funds as households 
worked to reduce their debts. As household 
debts became more manageable, banks 
became increasingly willing to make con-
sumer loans, as shown in Figure 2 below.

industrial (C&I) loans rising at an annual 
rate of 9.6 percent for the second quarter 
of 2011, which was the largest increase in 
over two years. The increase in small busi-
ness lending was particularly encouraging, 
with banks in the second quarter report-
ing increased demand for small business 
loans for the first time in five years. The 
market for consumer loans was improving 
as well. As consumer debt as a percentage 
of income fell to its lowest level since 1994, 
banks became more willing to make con-
sumer loans. The expansion of loan growth 
was a positive sign for the economy during 
what had been a sluggish recovery from the 
recession.

Summary
A barter economy is an economy that does not use money and in 
which people trade goods and services directly for other goods 
and services. Barter trade occurs only if there is a double coin-
cidence of wants, where both parties to the trade want what the 
other one has. Because barter is inefficient, there is strong incen-
tive to use money, which is any asset that people are generally 
willing to accept in exchange for goods or services or in payment 
of debts. An asset is anything of value owned by a person or a firm. 
A commodity money is a good used as money that also has value 
independent of its use as money. Money has four functions: It is 
a medium of exchange, a unit of account, a store of value, and a 
standard of deferred payment. The gold standard was a monetary 
system under which the government produced gold coins and pa-
per currency that were convertible into gold. The gold standard 
collapsed in the early 1930s. Today, no government in the world 
issues paper currency that can be redeemed for gold. Instead, pa-
per currency is fiat money, which has no value except as money.

Problems and Applications
 
1.5 The English economist William Stanley Jevons de-
scribed a world tour during the 1880s by a French singer, 
Mademoiselle Zélie. One stop on the tour was a theater in 
the Society Islands, part of French Polynesia in the South 
Pacific. She performed for her usual fee, which was one-
third of the receipts. This turned out to be three pigs, 23 
turkeys, 44 chickens, 5,000 coconuts, and “considerable 
quantities of bananas, lemons, and oranges.” She estimated 
that all of this would have had a value in France of 4,000 
francs. According to Jevons, “as Mademoiselle could not 
consume any considerable portion of the receipts herself, 
it became necessary in the meantime to feed the pigs and 
poultry with the fruit.” Do the goods Mademoiselle Zélie 
received as payment fulfill the four functions of money de-
scribed in the chapter? Briefly explain.

wouldn’t the people buying medical services at this hospital 
use money to pay for the medical services they are buying?

1.7 In the late 1940s, the Communists under Mao Zedong were 
defeating the government of China in a civil war. The pa-
per currency issued by the Chinese government was losing 
much of its value, and most businesses refused to accept 
it. At the same time, there was a paper shortage in Japan. 
During these years, Japan was still under military occu-
pation by the United States, following its defeat in World 
War II. Some of the U.S. troops in Japan realized that they 
could use dollars to buy up vast amounts of paper currency 
in China, ship it to Japan to be recycled into paper, and 
make a substantial profit. Under these circumstances, was 
the Chinese paper currency a commodity money or a fiat 
money? Briefly explain.

Summary
The narrowest definition of the money supply in the United States 
today is M1, which includes currency, checking account balances, 
and traveler’s checks. A broader definition of the money supply 
is M2, which includes everything that is in M1, plus savings ac-
counts, small-denomination time deposits (such as certificates 
of deposit [CDs]), money market deposit accounts in banks, and 
noninstitutional money market fund shares.

is the government likely to redeem it?
 2.10 [Related to the Making the Connection on page 835] 
In the nineteenth century, the Canadian government had 
difficulty getting banks and the public to accept the penny, 
which had been introduced a few years before. As a result, 
the government offered pennies for sale at a 20 percent 
discount. One account of this episode describes what the 
Canadian government did as “negative seigniorage.” What 
is seigniorage? Why might the Canadian government’s sell-
ing pennies at a 20 percent discount be considered “nega-
tive seigniorage”?

How Do Banks Create Money? pages 837–844
 25.3 
LEARNING OBJECTIVE: Explain how banks create money.
Summary
On a bank’s balance sheet, reserves and loans are assets, and depos-
its are liabilities. Reserves are deposits that the bank has retained 
rather than loaned out or invested. Required reserves are reserves 
that banks are legally required to hold. The fraction of deposits 
that banks are required to keep as reserves is called the required 
reserve ratio. Any reserves banks hold over and above the legal 
requirement are called excess reserves. When a bank accepts a de-
posit, it keeps only a fraction of the funds as reserves and loans 
out the remainder. In making a loan, a bank increases the checking 
account balance of the borrower. When the borrower uses a check 
to buy something with the funds the bank has loaned, the seller 
deposits the check in his bank. The seller’s bank keeps part of the 
deposit as reserves and loans out the remainder. This process con-
tinues until no banks have excess reserves. In this way, the process 
of banks making new loans increases the volume of checking ac-
count balances and the money supply. This money creation process 
can be illustrated with T-accounts, which are stripped-down ver-
sions of balance sheets that show only how a transaction changes 
a bank’s balance sheet. The simple deposit multiplier is the ratio 
of the amount of deposits created by banks to the amount of new 
reserves. An expression for the simple deposit multiplier is 1/RR.

Chapter Summary and Problems

Summary
The United States has a fractional reserve banking system in 
which banks keep less than 100 percent of deposits as reserves. 
In a bank run, many depositors decide simultaneously to with-
draw money from a bank. In a bank panic, many banks experi-
ence runs at the same time. The Federal Reserve System (“the 
Fed”) is the central bank of the United States. It was originally 
established in 1913 to stop bank panics. The recession of 2007–
2009 put renewed emphasis on the Fed’s goal of financial mar-
ket stability. Monetary policy refers to the actions the Federal 
Reserve takes to manage the money supply and interest rates to 
pursue macroeconomic policy objectives. The Fed’s three mon-
etary policy tools are open market operations, discount policy, 
and reserve requirements. Open market operations are the buy-
ing and selling of Treasury securities by the Federal Reserve. The 
loans the Fed makes to banks are called discount loans, and the 
interest rate the Fed charges on discount loans is the discount 
rate. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets 
in Washington, DC, eight times per year to discuss monetary 
policy. In the past 20 years, a “shadow banking system” has de-
veloped. During the financial crisis of 2007–2009, the existence 
of the shadow banking system complicated the Fed’s policy re-
sponse. A security is a financial asset—such as a stock or a 
bond—that can be bought and sold in a financial market. The 
process of securitization involves creating a secondary market 
in which loans that have been bundled together can be bought 
and sold in financial markets just as corporate or government 
bonds are.

4.8 In a speech delivered in June 2008, Timothy Geithner, then 
president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and

non-bank financial system grew to be very 
large. . . . [The] institutions in this parallel fi-
nancial system [are] vulnerable to a classic 
type of run, but without the protections such 
as deposit insurance that the banking system 
has in place to reduce such risks.

 25.5 
LEARNING OBJECTIVE: Explain the quantity theory of money and use it to explain how high rates 
of inflation occur.
Summary
The quantity equation, which relates the money supply to the price 
level, is M * V = P * Y where M is the money supply, V is the 
velocity of money, P is the price level, and Y is real output. The 
 velocity of money is the average number of times each dollar 
in the money supply is spent during the year. Economist Irving 
Fisher developed the quantity theory of money, which assumes 
that the velocity of money is constant. If the quantity theory of 
money is correct, the inflation rate should equal the rate of growth 
of the money supply minus the rate of growth of real output. Al-
though the quantity theory of money is not literally correct be-
cause the velocity of money is not constant, it is true that in the 
long run, inflation results from the money supply growing faster 
than real GDP. When governments attempt to raise revenue by 
selling large quantities of bonds to the central bank, the money 
supply will increase rapidly, resulting in a high rate of inflation.

2007 and 2008 made Zimbabwe’s currency virtually worth-
less despite the introduction of bigger and bigger notes, 
including a 10 trillion dollar bill.” Zimbabwe’s Economic 
Planning Minister, Elton Mangoma, was quoted as saying  
the Zimbabwean dollar “will be out for at least a year,” 
and in January 2009, the government of Zimbabwe made 
the U.S. dollar the country’s official currency. Why would 
 hyperinflation make a currency “virtually worthless”? How

Economics in Your Life
Should You Buy a House during a Recession?
If you are like most college students, buying a house is one of the farthest things from your mind. 
But suppose you think forward a few years to when you might be married and maybe even (gasp!) 
have children. Leaving behind years of renting apartments, you are considering buying a house. 
But, suppose that according to an article in the Wall Street Journal, a majority of economists are 
predicting that a recession is likely to begin soon. What should you do? Would this be a good time 
or a bad time to buy a house? As you read the chapter, see if you can answer these questions. You 
can check your answers against those we provide on page 895 at the end of this chapter.
Toll Brothers’ profit actually increased during 
2001. However, the recession of 2007–2009 
was a different story. Toll Brothers suffered 
a record loss of more than $750 million— 
and it wasn’t alone. Nearly all homebuilders 
suffered severe declines in sales, and many 
went bankrupt. The key problem was that by 
2005, the housing market boom had turned 
into a “bubble.” In a bubble, prices soar to 
levels that are not sustainable. When the 
housing bubble finally burst in 2006, sales of 
new homes and prices of existing homes be-
gan a sharp decline. By 2007, the economy 
had entered a recession. This time, unfor-
tunately, the Fed found that cutting interest 
rates was not enough to revive the housing 
market or the general economy. Beginning 
in 2008, the Fed was forced to turn to new 
policies to try to pull the economy out of 
recession.
In this chapter, we will study how 
monetary policy affects economic activ-
ity. Read AN INSIDE LOOK AT POLICY

tion Twist,” the Federal Reserve’s attempt to 
boost the economy in late 2011.
Based on Toll Brothers, Annual Report, 2010.
If you lose your job or are afraid that you 
might, you are not likely to buy a new 
house. It’s not surprising, then, that resi-
dential construction tends to fall during a 
recession. In addition, recessions often be-
gin after the Federal Reserve increases in-
terest rates to slow the growth in aggregate 
 demand in order to reduce the inflation 
rate. Higher interest rates increase the cost 
of buying houses, further reducing demand 
for them. Not surprisingly, firms that build 
homes usually don’t do well during reces-
sions. For example, during the recessions of 
1974–1975 and 1981–1982, residential con-
struction declined by more than 30 percent.
The recession of 2001 was different, 
however. In early 2001, the members of the 
Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Market Com-
mittee (FOMC) concluded that a recession 
was about to begin and took action to drive 
down interest rates. This action succeeded in 
heading off what some economists had pre-
dicted would be a prolonged and severe re-
cession. In fact, the Fed’s strategy resulted in 
spending on residential construction actually 
rising by 5 percent during the 2001 recession.

C H A P T E R  2 6  Monetary Policy
I
n Chapter 25, we saw that banks play an important role in providing credit to 
 households and firms, and in creating the money supply. We also saw that Congress 
established the Federal Reserve to stabilize the financial system and that the Fed is 
responsible for managing the money supply. In this chapter, we will discuss the Fed’s 
four main policy goals: (1) price stability, (2) high employment, (3) stability of financial 
markets and institutions, and (4) economic growth. We will explore how the Federal Reserve 
decides which monetary policy actions to take to achieve its goals.
What Is Monetary Policy?
In 1913, Congress passed the Federal Reserve Act, creating the Federal Reserve System 
(“the Fed”). The main responsibility of the Fed was to make discount loans to banks to 
prevent the bank panics we discussed in Chapter 25. As a result of the Great Depression 
of the 1930s, Congress amended the Federal Reserve Act to give the Federal Reserve’s 
Board of Governors broader responsibility to act “so as to promote effectively the goals 
of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.”
Since World War II, the Federal Reserve has carried out an active monetary policy. 
Monetary policy refers to the actions the Fed takes to manage the money supply and 
interest rates to pursue its macroeconomic policy goals.
The Goals of Monetary Policy
The Fed has four main monetary policy goals that are intended to promote a well- 
functioning economy:
 1. Price stability
 2. High employment
 3. Stability of financial markets and institutions
 4. Economic growth
We briefly consider each of these goals.
Price Stability As we have seen in previous chapters, rising prices erode the value 
of money as a medium of exchange and a store of value. Especially after inflation rose 
 dramatically and unexpectedly during the 1970s, policymakers in most industrial coun-
tries have had price stability as a policy goal. Figure 26.1 shows that from the early 1950s 
until 1968, the inflation rate remained below 4 percent per year. Inflation was above

The Inflation Rate,  
January 1952–August 2011
For most of the 1950s and 1960s, the 
inflation rate in the United States was 
4 percent or less. During the 1970s, the 
inflation rate increased, peaking during 
1979–1981, when it averaged more than 10 
percent. After 1992, the inflation rate was 
usually less than 4 percent, until increases in 
oil prices pushed it above 5 percent during 
summer 2008. The effects of the recession 
caused several months of deflation—a 
falling price level—during early 2009.
Note: The inflation rate is measured as the per-
centage change in the consumer price index 
(CPI) from the same month in the previous 
year.

4 percent for most of the 1970s. In early 1979, the inflation rate increased to more 
than 10 percent, where it remained until late 1981, when it began to rapidly fall back 
to the 4 percent range. After 1992, the inflation rate was usually below 4 percent,  until 
rapid increases in gasoline prices helped push it above 5 percent in summer 2008. 
The  effects of the recession caused several months of deflation—a falling price level— 
during early 2009.
The inflation rates during the years 1979–1981 were the highest the United States 
has ever experienced during peacetime. When Paul Volcker became chairman of the 
Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors in August 1979, he made fighting inflation his top 
policy goal. Alan Greenspan, who succeeded Volcker in August 1987, and Ben  Bernanke, 
who succeeded Greenspan in January 2006, continued to focus on inflation. Volcker, 
Greenspan, and Bernanke argued that if inflation is low over the long run, the Fed will 
have the flexibility it needs to lessen the impact of recessions. Although the severity of 
the 2007–2009 recession led the Fed to adopt extraordinary policy measures that we will 
discuss later in this chapter, price stability remains a key policy goal of the Fed.
High Employment In addition to price stability, high employment, or a low rate 
of unemployment, is an important monetary policy goal. Unemployed workers and 
 underused factories and office buildings reduce GDP below its potential level. Unem-
ployment causes financial distress and decreases the self-esteem of workers who lack 
jobs. The goal of high employment extends beyond the Fed to other branches of the 
federal government. At the end of World War II, Congress passed the Employment Act 
of 1946, which stated that it was the “responsibility of the Federal Government . . . to fos-
ter and promote . . . conditions under which there will be afforded useful employment, 
for those able, willing, and seeking to work, and to promote maximum employment, 
production, and purchasing power.” Because price stability and high employment are 
explicitly  mentioned in the Employment Act, it is sometimes said that the Fed has a dual 
mandate to attain these two goals.
Stability of Financial Markets and Institutions Resources are lost when finan-
cial markets and institutions are not efficient in matching savers and borrowers. Firms 
with the potential to produce goods and services that consumers value cannot obtain 
the financing they need to design, develop, and market those products. Savers waste 
 resources looking for satisfactory investments. The Fed promotes the stability of finan-
cial markets and institutions so that an efficient flow of funds from savers to borrowers 
will occur. As we saw in Chapter 25, the financial crisis of 2007–2009 brought the issue 
of stability in financial markets to the forefront.
The financial crisis of 2007–2009 was similar to the banking crises that led Congress 
to create the Federal Reserve System in 1913. A key difference is that while earlier bank-
ing crises affected commercial banks, the events of 2007–2009 also affected investment 
banks. Investment banks can be subject to liquidity problems because they often borrow 
short term—sometimes as short as overnight—and invest the funds in longer-term in-
vestments. Commercial banks borrow from households and firms in the form of check-
ing and savings deposits, while investment banks borrow primarily from other financial 
firms, such as other investment banks, mutual funds, or hedge funds, which are similar 
to mutual funds but typically engage in more complex—and risky—investment strat-
egies. Just as commercial banks can experience crises if depositors begin to withdraw 
funds, investment banks can experience crises if other financial firms stop offering them 
short-term loans. In 2008, the Fed decided to ease the liquidity problems facing invest-
ment banks by temporarily allowing them to receive discount loans, which had previ-
ously been available only to commercial banks. Later in this chapter, we will discuss in 
more detail the new policies the Fed enacted to help deal with the financial crisis.
Economic Growth We discussed in Chapters 21 and 22 the importance of economic 
growth to raising living standards. Policymakers aim to encourage stable economic 
growth because it allows households and firms to plan accurately and  encourages the 
long-run investment that is needed to sustain growth. Policy can spur economic growth 

868 
C H A P T E R  2 6  Monetary Policy
by providing incentives for saving to ensure a large pool of investment funds, as well 
as by providing direct incentives for business investment. Congress and the president, 
however, may be better able to increase saving and investment than is the Fed. For ex-
ample, Congress and the president can change the tax laws to increase the return to sav-
ing and investing. In fact, some economists question whether the Fed can play a role in 
promoting economic growth beyond attempting to meet its goals of price stability, high 
employment, and financial stability.
In the next section, we will look at how the Fed attempts to attain its monetary pol-
icy goals. Although the Fed has multiple monetary policy goals, during most periods, its 
most important goals have been price stability and high employment. But the turmoil 
in financial markets that began in 2007 led the Fed to put new emphasis on the goal of 
financial market stability.
The Money Market and the Fed’s 
Choice of Monetary Policy Targets
The Fed aims to use its policy tools to achieve its monetary policy goals. Recall from 
Chapter 25 that the Fed’s policy tools are open market operations, discount policy, and 
reserve requirements. At times, the Fed encounters conflicts between its policy goals. 
For example, as we will discuss later in this chapter, the Fed can raise interest rates to 
reduce the inflation rate. But, as we saw in Chapter 24, higher interest rates typically 
reduce household and firm spending, which may result in slower growth and higher 
unemployment. So, a policy that is intended to achieve one monetary policy goal, such 
as reducing inflation, may have an adverse effect on another policy goal, such as high 
employment.
Monetary Policy Targets
The Fed tries to keep both the unemployment and inflation rates low, but it can’t affect 
either of these economic variables directly. The Fed cannot tell firms how many people 
to employ or what prices to charge for their products. Instead, the Fed uses variables, 
called monetary policy targets, that it can affect directly and that, in turn, affect variables, 
such as real GDP, employment, and the price level, that are closely related to the Fed’s 
policy goals. The two main monetary policy targets are the money supply and the inter-
est rate. As we will see, the Fed typically uses the interest rate as its policy target.
It’s important to bear in mind that while the Fed has typically used the money supply 
and the interest rate as its targets, these targets were not central to the Fed’s policy deci-
sions during the recession of 2007–2009. As we will discuss later in this chapter,  because 
U.S. financial markets suffered a degree of disruption not seen since the Great Depres-
sion of the 1930s, the Fed was forced to develop new policy tools. However, it is still 
important to have a good grasp of how the Fed carries out policy during normal times.
The Demand for Money
The Fed’s two monetary policy targets are related in an important way. To see this rela-
tionship, we first need to examine the demand and supply for money. Figure 26.2 shows 
the demand curve for money. The interest rate is on the vertical axis, and the quantity of 
money is on the horizontal axis. Here we are using the M1 definition of money, which 
equals currency in circulation plus checking account deposits. Notice that the demand 
curve for money is downward sloping.
To understand why the demand curve for money is downward sloping, consider 
that households and firms have a choice between holding money and holding other 
 financial assets, such as U.S. Treasury bills. Money has one particularly desirable char-
acteristic: You can use it to buy goods, services, or financial assets. Money also has one 
undesirable characteristic: It earns either no interest or a very low rate of interest. The 
currency in your wallet earns no interest, and the money in your checking account earns

either no interest or very little interest. Alternatives to money, such as U.S.  Treasury bills, 
pay interest but have to be sold if you want to use the funds to buy something. When 
 interest rates rise on financial assets such as U.S. Treasury bills, the amount of interest 
that households and firms lose by holding money increases. When interest rates fall, the 
amount of interest households and firms lose by holding money decreases. Remember 
that opportunity cost is what you have to forgo to engage in an activity. The interest rate 
is the opportunity cost of holding money.
We now have an explanation of why the demand curve for money slopes downward: 
When interest rates on Treasury bills and other financial assets are low, the opportunity 
cost of holding money is low, so the quantity of money demanded by households and 
firms will be high; when interest rates are high, the opportunity cost of holding money 
will be high, so the quantity of money demanded will be low. In Figure 26.2, a decrease 
in interest rates from 4 percent to 3 percent causes the quantity of money demanded by 
households and firms to rise from $900 billion to $950 billion.
Shifts in the Money Demand Curve
We saw in Chapter 3 that the demand curve for a good is drawn holding constant all 
variables, other than the price, that affect the willingness of consumers to buy the good. 
Changes in variables other than the price cause the demand curve to shift. Similarly, the 
demand curve for money is drawn holding constant all variables, other than the inter-
est rate, that affect the willingness of households and firms to hold money. Changes in 
variables other than the interest rate cause the demand curve to shift. The two most 
important variables that cause the money demand curve to shift are real GDP and the 
price level.
An increase in real GDP means that the amount of buying and selling of goods 
and services will increase. This additional buying and selling increases the demand for 
money as a medium of exchange, so the quantity of money households and firms want 
to hold increases at each interest rate, shifting the money demand curve to the right. A 
decrease in real GDP decreases the quantity of money demanded at each interest rate, 
shifting the money demand curve to the left. A higher price level increases the quan-
tity of money required for a given amount of buying and selling. Eighty years ago, for 
example, when the price level was much lower and someone could purchase a new car 
for $500 and a salary of $30 per week put you in the middle class, the quantity of money 
demanded by households and firms was much lower than today, even adjusting for the 
effect of the lower real GDP and smaller population of those years. An increase in the 
price level increases the quantity of money demanded at each interest rate, shifting the 
money demand curve to the right. A decrease in the price level decreases the quantity 
of money demanded at each interest rate, shifting the money demand curve to the left. 
Figure 26.3 illustrates shifts in the money demand curve.
Figure 26.2
The Demand for Money
The money demand curve slopes downward 
because lower interest rates cause house-
holds and firms to switch from financial as-
sets such as U.S. Treasury bills to money. All 
other things being equal, a fall in the interest 
rate from 4 percent to 3 percent will increase 
the quantity of money demanded from $900 
billion to $950 billion. An increase in the 
interest rate will decrease the quantity of 
money demanded.

How the Fed Manages the Money Supply:  
A Quick Review
Having discussed money demand, we now turn to money supply. In Chapter 25, we 
saw how the Federal Reserve manages the money supply. Eight times per year, the Fed-
eral Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets in Washington, DC. If the FOMC decides 
to increase the money supply, it orders the trading desk at the Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York to purchase U.S. Treasury securities. The sellers of these Treasury securi-
ties deposit the funds they receive from the Fed in banks, which increases the banks’ 
 reserves. Typically, the banks loan out most of these reserves, which creates new check-
ing account deposits and expands the money supply. If the FOMC decides to decrease 
the money supply, it orders the trading desk to sell Treasury securities, which decreases 
banks’ reserves and contracts the money supply.
Equilibrium in the Money Market
In Figure 26.4, we include both the money demand and money supply curves. We 
can use this figure to see how the Fed affects both the money supply and the interest 
rate. For simplicity, we assume that the Federal Reserve is able to completely control 
the money supply. Therefore, the money supply curve is a vertical line, and changes

The Effect on the Interest Rate 
When the Fed Increases the 
Money Supply
When the Fed increases the money sup-
ply, households and firms will initially hold 
more money than they want, relative to 
other financial assets. Households and firms 
use the money they don’t want to hold to buy 
Treasury bills and make deposits in interest-
paying bank accounts. This increase in de-
mand allows banks and sellers of Treasury 
bills and similar securities to offer lower 
interest rates. Eventually, interest rates will 
fall enough that households and firms will 
be willing to hold the additional money the 
Fed has created. In the figure, an increase 
in the money supply from $900  billion to 
$950  billion causes the money supply curve 
to shift to the right, from MS1 to MS2, and 
causes the equilibrium interest rate to fall 
from 4 percent to 3 percent.

in the interest rate have no effect on the quantity of money supplied. Just as with 
other  markets, equilibrium in the money market occurs where the money demand 
curve crosses the money supply curve. If the Fed increases the money supply, the 
money  supply curve will shift to the right, and the equilibrium interest rate will fall. In  
Figure 26.4, when the Fed increases the money supply from $900 billion to $950 billion, 
the money supply curve shifts from MS1 to MS2, and the equilibrium interest rate falls 
from 4  percent to 3 percent.
In the money market, the adjustment from one equilibrium to another equilibrium 
is a little different from the adjustment in the market for a good. In Figure 26.4, the 
money market is initially in equilibrium, with an interest rate of 4 percent and a money 
supply of $900 billion. When the Fed increases the money supply by $50 billion, house-
holds and firms have more money than they want to hold at an interest rate of 4 percent. 
What do households and firms do with the extra $50 billion? They are most likely to use 
the money to buy short-term financial assets, such as Treasury bills, or to deposit the 
money in interest-paying bank accounts, such as certificates of deposit. This increase in 
demand for interest-paying bank accounts and short-term financial assets allows banks 
to offer lower interest rates on certificates of deposit, and it allows sellers of Treasury 
bills and similar assets to also offer lower interest rates. As the interest rates on certifi-
cates of deposit, Treasury bills, and other short-term assets fall, the opportunity cost of 
holding money also falls. Households and firms move down the money demand curve. 
Eventually the interest rate will have fallen enough that households and firms are willing 
to hold the additional $50 billion worth of money the Fed has created, and the money 
market will be back in equilibrium. To summarize: When the Fed increases the money 
supply, the short-term interest rate must fall until it reaches a level at which households 
and firms are willing to hold the additional money.
Figure 26.5 shows what happens when the Fed decreases the money supply. The 
money market is initially in equilibrium, at an interest rate of 4 percent and a money sup-
ply of $900 billion. If the Fed decreases the money supply to $850 billion, households and 
firms will be holding less money than they would like, relative to other  financial  assets, at 
an interest rate of 4 percent. To increase their money holdings, they will sell Treasury bills 
and other short-term financial assets and withdraw funds from certificates of deposit and 
other interest-paying bank accounts. Banks will have to offer higher interest rates in or-
der to retain depositors, and sellers of Treasury bills and similar  securities will have to 
offer higher interest rates in order to find buyers. Rising short-term interest rates increase 
the opportunity cost of holding money, causing households and firms to move up the 
money demand curve. Equilibrium is finally restored at an interest rate of 5 percent.
Figure 26.5
The Effect on Interest Rates 
When the Fed Decreases the 
Money Supply
When the Fed decreases the money sup-
ply, households and firms will initially hold 
less money than they want, relative to other 
 financial assets. Households and firms will 
sell Treasury bills and other financial assets 
and withdraw money from interest-paying 
bank accounts. These actions will increase 
interest rates. Eventually, interest rates will 
rise to the point at which households and 
firms will be willing to hold the smaller 
amount of money that results from the Fed’s 
actions. In the figure, a reduction in the 
money supply from $900 billion to $850 bil-
lion causes the money supply curve to shift 
to the left, from MS1 to MS2, and causes 
the equilibrium interest rate to rise from  
4  percent to 5 percent.

A Tale of Two Interest Rates
In Chapter 21, we discussed the loanable funds model of the interest rate. In that model, 
the equilibrium interest rate is determined by the demand and supply for loanable 
funds. Why do we need two models of the interest rate? The answer is that the loanable 
funds model is concerned with the long-term real rate of interest, and the money mar-
ket model is concerned with the short-term nominal rate of interest. The long-term real 
rate of interest is the interest rate that is most relevant when savers consider purchasing 
a long-term financial investment such as a corporate bond. It is also the rate of inter-
est that is most relevant to firms that are borrowing to finance long-term investment 
projects such as new factories or office buildings, or to households that are taking out 
mortgage loans to buy new homes.
When conducting monetary policy, however, the short-term nominal interest rate 
is the most relevant interest rate because it is the interest rate most affected by increases 
and decreases in the money supply. Often—but not always—there is a close connec-
tion between movements in the short-term nominal interest rate and movements in the 
long-term real interest rate. So, when the Fed takes actions to increase the short-term 
nominal interest rate, usually the long-term real interest rate also increases. In other 
words, as we will discuss in the next section, when the interest rate on Treasury bills 
rises, the real interest rate on mortgage loans usually also rises, although sometimes 
only after a delay.
Choosing a Monetary Policy Target
As we have seen, the Fed uses monetary policy targets to affect economic variables such 
as real GDP or the price level, that are closely related to the Fed’s policy goals. The Fed 
can use either the money supply or the interest rate as its monetary policy target. As 
Figure 26.5 shows, the Fed is capable of affecting both. The Fed has generally focused 
more on the interest rate than on the money supply. Since 1980, deregulation and finan-
cial innovations, including paying interest on checking accounts and the introduction of 
money market mutual funds, have made M1 less relevant as a measure of the medium of 
exchange. For a time, these developments led the Fed to rely on M2, a broader measure 
of the money supply that had a more stable historical relationship to economic growth. 
Even this relationship broke down in the early 1990s. In July 1993, then Fed Chairman 
Alan Greenspan informed the U.S. Congress that the Fed would cease using M1 or M2 
targets to guide the conduct of monetary policy. The Fed has correspondingly increased 
its reliance on interest rate targets.
There are many different interest rates in the economy. For purposes of monetary 
policy, the Fed has targeted the interest rate known as the federal funds rate. In the next 
section, we discuss the federal funds rate before examining how targeting the interest 
rate can help the Fed achieve its monetary policy goals.
The Importance of the Federal Funds Rate
Recall from Chapter 25 that every bank must keep 10 percent of its checking account 
deposits above a certain threshold amount as reserves, either as currency held in the 
bank or as deposits with the Fed. The Fed pays banks a low interest rate on their reserve 
deposits, so banks normally have an incentive to invest reserves above the 10 percent 
minimum. As the financial crisis that began in 2007 deepened during 2008, bank re-
serves soared as banks attempted to meet an increase in deposit withdrawals and as they 
became reluctant to lend to any borrowers except those with the most flawless credit 
histories. These conditions were very unusual, however. In normal times, banks keep 
few excess reserves, and when they need additional reserves, they borrow in the federal 
funds market from banks that have reserves available. The federal funds rate is the in-
terest rate banks charge each other on loans in the federal funds market. The loans in 
that market are usually very short term, often just overnight.
Despite the name, the Fed does not legally set the federal funds rate. Instead,  
the rate is determined by the supply of reserves relative to the demand for them.

market operations, it can set a target for the federal funds rate and usually come very 
close to hitting it. The FOMC announces a target for the federal funds rate after each 
meeting. In Figure 26.6, the orange line shows the Fed’s targets for the federal funds rate 
since 1998. The jagged green line represents the actual federal funds rate on a weekly ba-
sis. The figure shows the rapid declines in the target for the federal funds rate beginning 
in September 2007, as the Fed responded to the start of the financial crisis. In December 
2008, the Fed announced a range of 0 to 0.25 percent as its target. The  actual federal 
funds rate fluctuated between 0.06 and 0.23 percent. These very low federal funds rates 
reflect the severity of the financial crisis.
The federal funds rate is not directly relevant for households and firms. Only banks 
can borrow or lend in the federal funds market. However, changes in the federal funds 
rate usually result in changes in interest rates on other short-term financial assets, such 
as Treasury bills, and changes in interest rates on long-term financial assets, such as 
corporate bonds and mortgages. A change in the federal funds rate has a greater effect 
on short-term interest rates than on long-term interest rates, and its effect on long-term 
interest rates may occur only after a lag in time. Although a majority of economists sup-
port the Fed’s choice of the interest rate as its monetary policy target, some economists 
believe the Fed should concentrate on the money supply instead. We will discuss the 
views of these economists later in this chapter.
Monetary Policy and Economic Activity
Remember that the Fed uses the federal funds rate as a monetary policy target because 
it has good control of the federal funds rate through open market operations and be-
cause it believes that changes in the federal funds rate will ultimately affect economic 
variables that are related to its monetary policy goals. It is important to consider again 
the distinction between the nominal interest rate and the real interest rate. Recall that 
we calculate the real interest rate by subtracting the inflation rate from the nominal in-
terest rate. Ultimately, the ability of the Fed to use monetary policy to affect economic 
variables such as real GDP depends on its ability to affect real interest rates, such as the 
real interest rates on mortgages and corporate bonds. Because the federal funds rate is a 
short-term nominal interest rate, the Fed sometimes has difficulty affecting long-term

The Fed does not set the federal funds rate, but its ability to increase or decrease 
bank reserves quickly through open market operations keeps the actual federal

real interest rates. Nevertheless, for purposes of the following discussion, we will assume 
that the Fed is able to use open market operations to affect long-term real interest rates.
How Interest Rates Affect Aggregate Demand
Changes in interest rates affect aggregate demand, which is the total level of spending in 
the economy. Recall from Chapter 24 that aggregate demand has four components: con-
sumption, investment, government purchases, and net exports. Changes in interest rates 
will not affect government purchases, but they will affect the other three components of 
aggregate demand in the following ways:
• 
Consumption. Many households finance purchases of consumer durables, such 
as automobiles and furniture, by borrowing. Lower interest rates lead to increased 
spending on durables because they lower the total cost of these goods to consum-
ers by lowering the interest payments on loans. Higher interest rates raise the cost 
of consumer durables, and households will buy fewer of them. Lower interest rates 
also reduce the return to saving, leading households to save less and spend more. 
Higher interest rates increase the return to saving, leading households to save more 
and spend less.
• 
Investment. Firms finance most of their spending on machinery, equipment, and 
factories out of their profits or by borrowing. Firms borrow either from the finan-
cial markets by issuing corporate bonds or from banks. Higher interest rates on cor-
porate bonds or on bank loans make it more expensive for firms to borrow, so they 
will undertake fewer investment projects. Lower interest rates make it less expen-
sive for firms to borrow, so they will undertake more investment projects. Lower 
interest rates can also increase investment through their effect on stock prices. As 
interest rates decline, stocks become a more attractive investment relative to bonds. 
The increase in demand for stocks raises their price. An increase in stock prices 
sends a signal to firms that the future profitability of investment projects has in-
creased. By issuing additional shares of stocks, firms can acquire the funds they 
need to buy new factories and equipment, thereby increasing investment.
Finally, spending by households on new homes is also part of investment. 
When interest rates on mortgage loans rise, the cost of buying new homes rises, 
and fewer new homes will be purchased. When interest rates on mortgage loans fall, 
more new homes will be purchased.
• 
Net exports. Recall that net exports are equal to spending by foreign households 
and firms on goods and services produced in the United States minus spending 
by U.S. households and firms on goods and services produced in other countries. 
The value of net exports depends partly on the exchange rate between the dollar 
and foreign currencies. When the value of the dollar rises, households and firms 
in other countries will pay more for goods and services produced in the United 
States, but U.S. households and firms will pay less for goods and services produced 
in other countries. As a result, the United States will export less and import more, 
so net exports fall. When the value of the dollar falls, net exports will rise. If interest 
rates in the United States rise relative to interest rates in other countries, invest-
ing in U.S. financial assets will become more desirable, causing foreign investors 
to increase their demand for dollars, which will increase the value of the dollar. As 
the value of the dollar increases, net exports will fall. If interest rates in the United 
States decline relative to interest rates in other countries, the value of the dollar will 
fall, and net exports will rise.
The Effects of Monetary Policy on Real  
GDP and the Price Level
In Chapter 24, we developed the aggregate demand and aggregate supply model to 
 explain fluctuations in real GDP and the price level. In the basic version of the model, 
we assume that there is no economic growth, so the long-run aggregate supply curve 

 
Monetary Policy and Economic Activity 
875
does not shift. In panel (a) of Figure 26.7, we assume that the economy is in short-run 
equilibrium at point A, where the aggregate demand (AD1) curve intersects the short-
run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve. Real GDP is below potential real GDP, as shown 
by the LRAS curve, so the economy is in a recession, with some firms operating below 
normal capacity and some workers having been laid off. To reach its goal of high em-
ployment, the Fed needs to carry out an expansionary monetary policy by increasing 
the money supply and decreasing interest rates. Lower interest rates cause an increase in 
consumption, investment, and net exports, which shifts the aggregate demand curve to 
the right, from AD1 to AD2. Real GDP increases from $13.8 trillion to potential GDP of 
$14.0 trillion, and the price level rises from 98 to 100 (point B). The policy successfully 
returns real GDP to its potential level. Rising production leads to increasing employ-
ment, allowing the Fed to achieve its goal of high employment.
In panel (b) of Figure 26.7, the economy is in short-run equilibrium at point A, 
with real GDP of $14.2 trillion, which is above potential real GDP of $14.0 trillion. With 
some firms producing beyond their normal capacity and the unemployment rate very 
low, wages and prices are increasing. To reach its goal of price stability, the Fed needs 
to carry out a contractionary monetary policy by decreasing the money supply and 
increasing interest rates. Higher interest rates cause a decrease in consumption, invest-
ment, and net exports, which shifts the aggregate demand curve from AD1 to AD2. Real 
GDP  decreases from $14.2 trillion to $14.0 trillion, and the price level falls from 102 
to 100 (point B). Why would the Fed want to intentionally cause real GDP to decline? 
Because in the long run, real GDP cannot continue to remain above potential GDP. At-
tempting to keep real GDP above potential GDP would result in rising inflation. As ag-
gregate demand declines and real GDP returns to its potential level, upward pressure on 
wages and prices will be reduced, allowing the Fed to achieve its goal of price stability.
We can conclude that the Fed can use monetary policy to affect the price level 
and, in the short run, the level of real GDP, allowing it to attain its policy goals of high 
 employment and price stability.

 Figure 26.7  Monetary Policy
In panel (a), the economy begins in a recession at point A, with real GDP of 
$13.8 trillion and a price level of 98. An expansionary monetary policy causes 
aggregate demand to shift to the right, from AD1 to AD2, increasing real GDP 
from $13.8 trillion to $14.0 trillion and the price level from 98 to 100 (point B). 
With real GDP back at its potential level, the Fed can meet its goal of high 
employment.
In panel (b), the economy begins at point A, with real GDP at $14.2 trillion and 
the price level at 102. Because real GDP is greater than potential GDP, the economy 
experiences rising wages and prices. A contractionary monetary policy causes 
 aggregate demand to shift to the left, from AD1 to AD2, decreasing real GDP from 
$14.2 trillion to $14.0 trillion and the price level from 102 to 100 (point B). With 
real GDP back at its potential level, the Fed can meet its goal of price stability.

C H A P T E R  2 6  Monetary Policy
The increase in bank reserves was partly due to the Fed’s decision in October 2008 
to start paying interest of 0.25 percent on bank reserves held as deposits at the Fed. 
 Primarily, though, the increase in reserves occurred because banks were reluctant to 
make loans at low interest rates to households and firms whose financial positions 
had been damaged by the recession. Some economists believed the Fed was facing a 
situation known as a liquidity trap, in which short-term interest rates are pushed to 
zero, leaving the central bank unable to lower them further. Some economists believe 
that liquidity traps occurred in the United States during the 1930s and in Japan during 
the 1990s.
Not being able to push the target for the federal funds rate below zero was a prob-
lem for the Fed. Glenn Rudebusch, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of San 
Francisco, calculated that given how high the unemployment rate was, the appropriate 
target for the federal funds rate was –5 percent. Because the federal funds rate cannot be 
negative, the Fed turned to other policies. In particular, the Fed decided to embark on 
a policy of quantitative easing, which involves buying securities beyond the short-term 
Treasury securities that are usually involved in open market operations. The Fed began 
purchasing 10-year Treasury notes to keep their interest rates from rising. Interest rates 
on home mortgage loans typically move closely with interest rates on 10-year Treasury 
notes. The Fed also purchased certain mortgage-backed securities. The Fed’s objective 
was to keep interest rates on mortgages low and to keep funds flowing into the mortgage 
market in order to help stimulate demand for housing.
Too Low for Zero: The Fed Tries 
“Quantitative Easing” and  
“Operation Twist”
Figure 26.6 shows that in December 2008, the Fed pushed the 
target for the federal funds rate to nearly zero and kept it there through 2011.  Because 
the 2007–2009 recession was so severe, even this very low rate did little to stimulate 
the economy. To lower the federal funds rate, the Fed buys Treasury bills through open 
market purchases, which increases bank reserves. Banks then lend out these  reserves. 
As the figure below shows, however, in late 2008, many banks began piling up excess 
reserves rather than lending the funds out. Total bank reserves had been less than $50 
billion in August 2008, but with the deepening of the financial crisis, they had soared to 
more than $900 billion by May 2009.

The Fed’s first round of quantitative easing began in  November 
2008 and ended in June 2010. With the economy recovering only 
slowly, in November 2010, the Fed announced a second round of 
quantitative easing (dubbed QE2). With QE2, the Fed bought an 
additional $600 billion in long-term Treasury securities through 
June 2011. In September 2011, with the economic recovery remain-
ing weak, the Fed announced a new program under which it would 
purchase $400 billion in long-term Treasury securities while selling 
an equal amount of shorter-term Treasury securities. This program, 
which some people in financial markets called “Operation Twist,” had 
the same objective as quantitative easing: to reduce interest rates on 
long-term Treasury securities in order to increase aggregate demand.
Later in this chapter, we will consider other new programs 
the Fed put in place to deal with the recession of 2007–2009 and  
the slow recovery that followed, as its traditional focus on lowering 
the federal funds rate to stimulate the economy proved ineffective.

Can the Fed Eliminate Recessions?
Panel (a) of Figure 26.7 on page 875 shows an expansionary monetary policy that per-
forms perfectly by shifting the AD curve to bring the economy back to potential GDP. In 
fact, however, this ideal is very difficult for the Fed to achieve, as the length and severity 
of the 2007–2009 recession indicates. In practice, the best the Fed can do is keep reces-
sions shorter and milder than they would otherwise be.
If the Fed is to be successful in offsetting the effects of the business cycle, it needs 
to quickly recognize the need for a change in monetary policy. If the Fed is late in rec-
ognizing that a recession has begun or that the inflation rate is increasing, it may not be 
able to implement a new policy soon enough to do much good. In fact, implementing a 
policy too late may actually destabilize the economy. To see how this can  happen, con-
sider Figure 26.8. The straight line represents the long-run growth trend in real GDP in 
the United States. On average, real GDP grows about 3.3 percent per year. The actual 
path of real GDP differs from the underlying trend because of the business cycle, which 
is shown by the red curved line. As we saw in Chapter 21, the actual  business cycle is 
more irregular than the stylized cycle shown here.
The Fed pushed interest rates to 
very low levels during 2008 and 
2009.

The Effect of a Poorly Timed 
Monetary Policy on the 
Economy
The upward-sloping straight line represents 
the long-run growth trend in real GDP. The 
curved red line represents the path real GDP 
takes because of the business cycle. If the 
Fed is too late in implementing a change 
in monetary policy, real GDP will follow 
the curved blue line. The Fed’s expansion-
ary monetary policy results in too great an 
 increase in aggregate demand during the 
next expansion, which causes an increase in 
the inflation rate.

C H A P T E R  2 6  Monetary Policy
Suppose that a recession begins in August 2014. Because it takes months for 
 economic statistics to be gathered by the Commerce Department, the Census Bureau, 
the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the Fed itself, there is a lag, or delay, before the Fed 
recognizes that a recession has begun. Then it takes time for the Fed’s economists to 
analyze the data. Finally, in June 2015, the FOMC concludes that the economy is in 
recession and begins an expansionary monetary policy. As it turns out, June 2015 is 
actually the trough of the recession, meaning that the recession has already ended, and 
an expansion has begun. In these circumstances, the Fed’s expansionary policy is not 
needed to end the recession. The increase in aggregate demand caused by the Fed’s low-
ering interest rates is likely to push the economy beyond potential real GDP and cause 
a significant acceleration in inflation. Real GDP ends up following the path indicated 
by the blue curved line. The Fed has inadvertently engaged in a procyclical policy, which 
increases the severity of the business cycle, as opposed to a countercyclical policy, which 
is meant to reduce the severity of the business cycle, and which is what the Fed intends 
to use. As we saw in Chapter 21, the typical recession since 1950 has lasted less than one 
year, which increases the likelihood that the Fed may accidentally engage in a procycli-
cal policy. Making this mistake is, of course, less likely in a long and severe recession 
such as the recession of 2007–2009.
It is not unusual for employment or manufacturing production to decline for 
a month or two in the middle of an expansion. Distinguishing these minor ups and 
downs from the beginning of a recession is difficult. The National Bureau of Economic 
Research (NBER) announces dates for the beginning and end of recessions that most 
economists generally accept. An indication of how difficult it is to determine when re-
cessions begin and end is that the NBER generally makes its announcements only af-
ter a considerable delay. The NBER did not announce that a recession had begun in 
March 2001 until November 2001, which is the same month it later determined that 
the recession had ended. The NBER did not announce that a recession had begun in 
December 2007 until December 2008. Failing to react until well after a recession has 
begun (or ended) can be a serious problem for the Fed. In the case of the 2007–2009 
recession, however, the Fed did promptly cut the federal funds rate in September 2007, 
in response to the beginning of the financial crisis, even though the recession did not 
actually begin until two months later.
Trying to Hit a Moving Target: Making 
Policy with “Real-Time Data”
The Fed relies on macroeconomic data to formulate monetary 
policy. One key piece of economic data is GDP, which is calcu-
lated quarterly by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). Unfortunately for Fed poli-
cymakers, the GDP data the BEA provides are frequently revised, and the revisions can 
be large enough that the actual state of the economy can be different from what it at first 
appeared to be.
The BEA’s advance estimate of a quarter’s GDP is not released until about a month 
after the quarter has ended. This delay can be a problem for policymakers because it 
means that, for instance, they will not receive an estimate of GDP for the period from 
January through March until the end of April. Presenting even more difficulty is the fact 
that the advance estimate will be subject to a number of revisions. The second estimate 
of a quarter’s GDP is released about two months after the end of the quarter. The third 
estimate is released about three months after the end of the quarter. Although the BEA 
used to refer to the third estimate as the “final estimate,” in fact, it continues to revise its 
estimates through the years. For instance, the BEA releases first annual, second annual, 
and third annual estimates one, two, and three years after the third estimate. Nor is that 
the end, because benchmark revisions of the estimates will occur in later years.
Why so many estimates? Because GDP is such a comprehensive measure of output 
in the economy, it is very time-consuming to collect the necessary data. To provide the 
advance estimate, the BEA relies on surveys conducted by the Commerce Department 
of retail sales and manufacturing shipments, as well as data from trade organizations, 
Making 
the 
Connection

 
Monetary Policy and Economic Activity 
879
estimates of government spending, and so on. As time passes, these organizations gather 
additional data, and the BEA is able to refine its estimates.
Do these revisions to the GDP estimates matter? Sometimes they do, as the following 
example indicates. At the beginning of 2001, there were some indications that the U.S. 
economy might be headed for recession. The dot-com stock market bubble had burst the 
previous spring, wiping out trillions of dollars in stockholder wealth. Overbuilding of  
fiber-optic cable networks and other information technology also weighed on the econ-
omy. The advance estimate of the first quarter’s GDP, though, showed a reasonably healthy 
increase in real GDP of 2.0% at an annual rate. It seemed as if there was nothing for gov-
ernment policymakers to be worried about. But, as the graph below shows, that estimate 
of 2.0% was revised a number of times over the years, mostly downward. Currently, BEA 
data indicate that real GDP actually declined by 1.3% at an annual rate during the first 
quarter of 2001. This swing of more than 3 percentage points is a large difference—a dif-
ference that changes the picture of what happened during the first quarter of 2001 from 
one of an economy experiencing moderate growth to one of an economy suffering a sig-
nificant decline. The National Bureau of Economic Research dates the recession of 2001 as 
having begun in March, but some economists believe it actually began at the end of 2000. 
The current BEA estimates of GDP provide some support for this view.
A Summary of How Monetary Policy Works
Table 26.1 compares the steps involved in expansionary and contractionary monetary 
policies. We need to note an important qualification to this summary. At every point, we 
should add the phrase “relative to what would have happened without the policy.” Table 
26.1 isolates the impact of monetary policy, holding constant all other factors affecting 
the variables involved. In other words, we are invoking the ceteris paribus condition, 
discussed in Chapter 3. This point is important because, for example, a contractionary 
monetary policy does not cause the price level to fall; rather, a contractionary monetary 
policy causes the price level to rise by less than it would have risen without the policy. 
One final note on terminology: An expansionary monetary policy is sometimes referred 
to as a loose policy, or an easy policy. A contractionary monetary policy is sometimes 
referred to as a tight policy.

C H A P T E R  2 6  Monetary Policy
Remember That with Monetary Policy, It’s 
the Interest Rates—Not the Money—That 
Counts
It is tempting to think of monetary policy working like 
this: If the Fed wants more spending in the economy, it in-
creases the money supply, and people spend more because 
they now have more money. If the Fed wants less spending 
in the economy, it decreases the money supply, and people 
spend less because they now have less money. In fact, that is 
not how monetary policy works. Remember the important 
difference between money and income: The Fed increases 
the money supply by buying Treasury bills. The sellers of 
the Treasury bills have just exchanged one asset—Treasury 
bills—for another asset—a check from the Fed; the sellers 
have not increased their income. Even though the money 
supply is now larger, no one’s income has increased, so no 
one’s spending should be affected.
It is only when this increase in the money supply 
 results in lower interest rates that spending is affected. 
When interest rates are lower, households are more likely 
to buy new homes and automobiles, and businesses are 
more likely to buy new factories and computers. Lower 
 interest rates also lead to a lower value of the dollar, 
which lowers the prices of exports and raises the prices of 
 imports, thereby increasing net exports. It isn’t the increase 
in the money supply that has brought about this addi-
tional spending; it’s the lower interest rates. To understand 
how monetary policy works, and to interpret news reports 
about the Fed’s actions, remember that it is the change in 
interest rates, not the change in the money supply, that is 
most important.

Monetary Policy in the Dynamic Aggregate 
Demand and Aggregate Supply Model*
The overview of monetary policy we just finished contains a key idea: The Fed can use 
monetary policy to affect aggregate demand, thereby changing the price level and the 
level of real GDP. The discussion of monetary policy illustrated by Figure 26.7 on page 875  
is simplified, however, because it ignores two important facts about the economy:  
(1) The economy experiences continuing inflation, with the price level rising every year, 
and (2) the economy experiences long-run growth, with the LRAS curve shifting to the 
right every year. In Chapter 24, we developed a dynamic aggregate demand and aggre-
gate supply model that takes into account these two facts. In this section, we use the 
dynamic model to gain a more complete understanding of monetary policy. Let’s briefly 
review the dynamic model. Recall from Chapter 24 that over time, the U.S. labor force 
and U.S. capital stock will increase. Technological change will also occur. The result will

curve shifting to the right. These factors will also result in firms supplying more goods 
and services at any given price level in the short run, which we show by the short-run 
aggregate supply curve shifting to the right. During most years, the aggregate demand 
curve will also shift to the right, indicating that aggregate expenditure will be higher 
at every price level. There are several reasons aggregate expenditure usually increases: 
As population grows and incomes rise, consumption will increase over time. Also, as 
the economy grows, firms expand capacity, and new firms are established, increasing 
investment spending. Finally, an expanding population and an expanding economy re-
quire increased government services, such as more police officers and teachers, so gov-
ernment purchases will expand.
The Effects of Monetary Policy on Real GDP  
and the Price Level: A More Complete Account
During certain periods, AD does not increase enough during the year to keep the econ-
omy at potential GDP. This slow growth in aggregate demand may be due to households 
and firms becoming pessimistic about the future state of the economy, leading them to 
cut back their spending on consumer durables, houses, and factories. As we have seen, 
the collapse of the housing bubble and the resulting financial crisis had a negative effect 
on aggregate demand during the 2007–2009 recession. Other possibilities exist as well: 
The federal government might decide to balance the budget by cutting back its purchases, 
or recessions in other countries might cause a decline in U.S. exports. In the hypothetical 
situation shown in Figure 26.9, in the first year, the economy is in equilibrium, at poten-
tial real GDP of $14.0 trillion and a price level of 100 (point A). In the second year, LRAS 
increases to $14.4 trillion, but AD increases only to AD21without policy2, which is not enough 
to keep the economy in macroeconomic equilibrium at potential GDP. If the Fed does 
not intervene, the short-run equilibrium will occur at $14.3 trillion (point B). The $100 
billion gap between this level of real GDP and potential real GDP at LRAS2 means that 
some firms are operating at less than their normal capacity. Incomes and profits will fall, 
firms will begin to lay off workers, and the unemployment rate will rise.
Economists at the Federal Reserve closely monitor the economy and continu-
ally update forecasts of future levels of real GDP and prices. When these economists 
 anticipate that aggregate demand is not growing fast enough to allow the economy to 
remain at full employment, they present their findings to the FOMC, which decides

An Expansionary Monetary 
Policy
The economy begins in equilibrium at point 
A, with real GDP of $14.0 trillion and a 
price level of 100. Without monetary policy, 
aggregate demand will shift from AD1 to 
AD21without policy2, which is not enough to 
keep the economy at full employment be-
cause long-run aggregate supply has shifted 
from LRAS1 to LRAS2. The economy will be 
in short-run equilibrium at point B, with 
real GDP of $14.3 trillion and a price level 
of 102. By lowering interest rates, the Fed 
increases investment, consumption, and 
net exports sufficiently to shift aggregate 
demand to AD21with policy2. The economy 
will be in equilibrium at point C, with real 
GDP of $14.4 trillion, which is its full em-
ployment level, and a price level of 103. The 
price level is higher than it would have been 
if the Fed had not acted to increase spending 
in the economy.

whether circumstances require a change in monetary policy. For example, suppose 
that the FOMC meets and considers a forecast from the staff indicating that during 
the following year, a gap of $100 billion will open between equilibrium real GDP and 
potential real GDP. In other words, the macroeconomic equilibrium illustrated by 
point B in Figure 26.9 will occur. The FOMC may then decide to carry out an expan-
sionary monetary policy to lower interest rates to stimulate aggregate demand. The 
figure shows the results of a successful attempt to do this: AD has shifted to the right, 
and equilibrium occurs at potential GDP (point C). The Fed will have successfully 
headed off the falling incomes and rising unemployment that otherwise would have 
occurred. Bear in mind that we are illustrating a perfectly executed monetary policy 
that keeps the economy at potential GDP, which is difficult to achieve in practice for 
reasons already discussed.
Notice in Figure 26.9 that the expansionary monetary policy caused the inflation 
rate to be higher than it would have been. Without the expansionary policy, the price 
level would have risen from 100 to 102, so the inflation rate for the year would have 
been 2 percent. By shifting the aggregate demand curve, the expansionary policy caused 
the price level to increase from 102 to 103, raising the inflation rate from 2 percent to 
3 percent.
Using Monetary Policy to Fight Inflation
In addition to using an expansionary monetary policy to reduce the severity of reces-
sions, the Fed can also use a contractionary monetary policy to keep aggregate demand 
from expanding so rapidly that the inflation rate begins to increase. Figure 26.10 shows 
the situation during 2005 and 2006, when the Fed faced this possibility. During 2005, 
the economy was at equilibrium at potential GDP, but Fed Chair Alan Greenspan and 
other members of the FOMC were concerned that the continuing boom in the housing 
market might lead aggregate demand to increase so rapidly that the inflation rate would 
begin to accelerate. The Fed had been gradually increasing the target for the federal 
funds rate since mid-2004.
When Ben Bernanke assumed office as Fed chair in early 2006, he advocated 
continued increases in the target for the federal funds rate to slow the growth in 
 aggregate  demand. By June 2006, the target for the federal funds rate had been raised 
Figure 26.10
A Contractionary Monetary 
Policy in 2006
The economy began 2005 in equilibrium at 
point A, with real GDP equal to potential 
GDP of $12.6 trillion and a price level of 
100.0. From 2005 to 2006, potential GDP 
increased from $12.6 trillion to $12.9 tril-
lion, as long-run aggregate supply increased 
from LRAS2005 to LRAS2006. The Fed raised 
interest rates because it believed the hous-
ing boom was causing aggregate demand to 
increase too rapidly. Without the increase in 
interest rates, aggregate demand would have 
shifted from AD2005 to AD2006(without policy), 
and the new short-run equilibrium would 
have occurred at point B. Real GDP would 
have been $13.2 trillion—$300 billion 
greater than potential GDP—and the price 
level would have been 104.5. The increase in 
interest rates resulted in aggregate demand 
increasing only to AD2006(with policy). Equilib-
rium occurred at point C, with real GDP of 
$13.0 trillion being only $100 billion greater 
than potential GDP and the price level rising 
only to 103.2.

to 5.25 percent, from the low rate of 1 percent that had prevailed from June 2003 to 
May 2004. The FOMC issues a statement after each meeting that summarizes the com-
mittee’s views on the current state of the economy and gives some indication of how 
monetary policy might change in the near future. After its meeting on June 29, 2006, the 
FOMC included the following remarks in its statement:
The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the 
federal funds rate . . . to 5-1/4 percent. Recent indicators suggest that economic 
growth is moderating from its quite strong pace earlier this year, partly reflecting 
a gradual cooling of the housing market and the lagged effects of increases in . . .  
interest rates. . . . Although the moderation in the growth of aggregate demand 
should help to limit inflation pressures over time, the Committee judges that some 
inflation risks remain.
The committee kept the target for the federal funds rate constant at 5.25 percent 
until September 2007, when concern about difficulties in financial markets led it to cut 
the target to 4.75 percent. Although it is impossible to know exactly what would have 
happened during 2006 without the Fed’s policy change, Figure 26.10 presents a plausible 
scenario. The figure shows that without the Fed’s actions to increase interest rates, ag-
gregate demand would have shifted farther to the right, and equilibrium would have oc-
curred at a level of real GDP that was beyond the potential level. The price level would 
have risen from 100.0 in 2005 to 104.5 in 2006, meaning that the inflation rate would 
have been 4.5 percent. Because the Fed kept aggregate demand from increasing as much 
as it otherwise would have, equilibrium occurred at potential real GDP, and the price 
level in 2006 rose to only 103.2, keeping the inflation rate at 3.2 percent.

keep real GDP at its potential level, the Fed must undertake an expansionary 
policy. To carry out an expansionary policy, the trading desk needs to buy 
Treasury bills. Buying Treasury bills will increase reserves in the banking sys-
tem. Banks will increase their loans, which will increase the money supply 
and lower the interest rate.
Step 3: Answer part b. by explaining the effect of the Fed’s policy. If the Fed’s policy 
is successful, real GDP in 2015 will increase from $15.4 trillion, as given in the 
table, to its potential level of $15.6 trillion. Potential real GDP is not affected 
by monetary policy, so its value will not change. Because the level of real GDP 
will be higher, the unemployment rate will be lower than it would have been 
without policy. The expansionary monetary policy shifts the AD curve to the 
right, so short-run equilibrium will move up the short-run aggregate supply 
(SRAS) curve, and the price level will be higher.

The economy starts in equilibrium in 2014 at point A, with the AD and SRAS

of $15.2 trillion, and the price level is 114. Without monetary policy, the AD 
curve shifts to AD20151without policy2, and the economy is in short-run equilib-
rium at point B. Because potential real GDP has increased from $15.2 trillion 
to $15.6 trillion, short-run equilibrium real GDP of $15.4 trillion is below the 
potential level. The price level has increased from 114 to 116. With policy, 
the AD curve shifts to AD20151with policy2, and the economy is in equilibrium 
at point C. Real GDP is at its potential level of $15.6 trillion. We don’t have 
enough information to be sure of the new equilibrium price level. We do 
know that it will be higher than 116. The graph shows the price level rising 
to 118. Therefore, without the Fed’s expansionary policy, the inflation rate 
in 2015 would have been about 1.8 percent. With policy, it will be about 3.5 
percent.
Extra Credit: Bear in mind that in reality, the Fed is unable to use monetary policy to 
keep real GDP exactly at its potential level, as this problem suggests.

A Closer Look at the Fed’s Setting of Monetary Policy Targets

A Closer Look at the Fed’s Setting 
of Monetary Policy Targets
We have seen that in carrying out monetary policy, the Fed changes its target for the fed-
eral funds rate, depending on the state of the economy. During times when the economy 
is not experiencing a financial crisis, is using the federal funds rate as a target the best 
way to conduct monetary policy? If the Fed targets the federal funds rate, how should it 
decide what the target level should be? In this section, we consider some important is-
sues concerning the Fed’s targeting policy.
Should the Fed Target the Money Supply?
Some economists have argued that rather than use an interest rate as its monetary policy 
target, the Fed should use the money supply. Many of the economists who make this ar-
gument belong to a school of thought known as monetarism. The leader of the monetar-
ist school was Nobel Laureate Milton Friedman, who was skeptical that the Fed would 
be able to correctly time changes in monetary policy.
Friedman and his followers favored replacing monetary policy with a monetary 
growth rule. Ordinarily, we expect monetary policy to respond to changing eco-
nomic conditions: When the economy is in recession, the Fed reduces interest rates, 
and when inflation is increasing, the Fed raises interest rates. A monetary growth 
rule, in contrast, is a plan for increasing the money supply at a constant rate that 
does not change in response to economic conditions. Friedman and his followers 
proposed a monetary growth rule of increasing the money supply every year at a rate 
equal to the long-run growth rate of real GDP, which is about 3.3 percent. If the Fed 
adopted this monetary growth rule, it would stick to it through changing economic 
conditions.
But what happens under a monetary growth rule if the economy moves into reces-
sion? Shouldn’t the Fed abandon the rule to drive down interest rates? Friedman ar-
gued that the Fed should stick to the rule even during recessions because, he believed, 
active monetary policy destabilizes the economy, increasing the number of recessions 
and their severity. By keeping the money supply growing at a constant rate, Friedman 
argued, the Fed would greatly increase economic stability.
Although during the 1970s some economists and politicians pressured the Fed-
eral Reserve to adopt a monetary growth rule, most of that pressure has disappeared 
in recent years. A key reason is that the fairly close relationship between move-
ments in the money supply and movements in real GDP and the price level that 
existed before 1980 has become much weaker. Since 1980, the growth rate of M1 has 
been unstable. In some years, M1 has grown more than 10 percent, while in other 
years, it has actually fallen. Yet despite these wide fluctuations in the growth of M1, 
growth in real GDP has been fairly stable, and inflation has remained low during 
most years.
Why Doesn’t the Fed Target Both the Money Supply 
and the Interest Rate?
Most economists believe that an interest rate is the best monetary policy target, but, 
as we have just seen, other economists believe the Fed should target the money sup-
ply. Why doesn’t the Fed satisfy both groups by targeting both the money supply 
and an interest rate? The simple answer to this question is that the Fed can’t target 
both at the same time. To see why, look at Figure 26.11, which shows the money 
market.
Remember that the Fed controls the money supply, but it does not control money 
demand. Money demand is determined by decisions of households and firms as they 
weigh the trade-off between the convenience of money and its low interest rate com-
pared with other financial assets. Suppose the Fed is targeting the interest rate and 
decides, given conditions in the economy, that the interest rate should be 5 percent. 
26.5 LEARNING OBJECTIVE
Discuss the Fed’s setting of 
monetary policy targets.

886 
C H A P T E R  2 6  Monetary Policy
Or, suppose the Fed is targeting the money supply and decides that the money supply 
should be $900 billion. Figure 26.11 shows that the Fed can bring about an interest rate 
of 5 percent or a money supply of $900 billion, but it can’t bring about both. The point 
representing an interest rate of 5 percent and a money supply of $900 billion is not on 
the money demand curve, so it can’t represent an equilibrium in the money market. 
Only combinations of the interest rate and the money supply that represent equilibrium 
in the money market are possible.
The Fed has to choose between targeting an interest rate and targeting the money 
supply. For most of the period since World War II, the Fed has chosen an interest rate 
target.
The Taylor Rule
How does the Fed choose a target for the federal funds rate? The discussions at the 
meetings of the FOMC can be complex, and they take into account many economic 
variables. John Taylor of Stanford University has analyzed the factors involved in 
Fed decision making and developed the Taylor rule to explain federal funds rate 
targeting. The Taylor rule begins with an estimate of the value of the equilibrium 
real federal funds rate, which is the federal funds rate—adjusted for inflation—that 
would be consistent with real GDP being equal to potential real GDP in the long 
run. According to the Taylor rule, the Fed should set the target for the federal funds 
rate so that it is equal to the sum of the inflation rate, the equilibrium real federal 
funds rate, and two additional terms. The first of these additional terms is the infla-
tion gap—the difference between current inflation and a target rate; the second is 
the output gap—the percentage difference between real GDP and potential real GDP. 
The inflation gap and output gap are each given “weights” that reflect their influ-
ence on the federal funds target rate. With weights of 1/2 for both gaps, we have the 
 following Taylor rule:
Federal funds target rate 5 Current inflation rate 1 Real equilibrium federal funds rate
1 ((1/2) 3 Inflation gap) 1 ((1/2) 3 Output gap).
The Taylor rule includes expressions for the inflation gap and the output gap 
 because the Fed is concerned about both inflation and fluctuations in real GDP.  Taylor 
demonstrated that if the equilibrium real federal funds rate is 2 percent and the target 
rate of inflation is 2 percent, the preceding expression does a good job of explaining 
changes in the Fed’s target for the federal funds rate during most years. Consider an 
Taylor rule A rule developed by John 
Taylor that links the Fed’s target for 
the federal funds rate to economic 
variables.

The Fed Can’t Target Both the

The Fed is forced to choose between using 
either an interest rate or the money supply 
as its monetary policy target. In this figure, 
the Fed can set a target of $900 billion for 
the money supply or a target of 5 percent for 
the interest rate, but the Fed can’t hit both 
targets because it can achieve only combina-
tions of the interest rate and the money sup-
ply that represent equilibrium in the money 
market.

example in which the current inflation rate is 1 percent, and real GDP is 1 percent below 
potential real GDP. In that case, the inflation gap is 1 percent 22 percent 5 21 percent 
and the output gap is also 21 percent. Inserting these values in the Taylor rule, we can 
calculate the predicted value for the federal funds target rate:
Federal funds target rate 5 1% 1 2% 1 ((1/2) 3 21%) 1 ((1/2) 3 21%) 5 2%.
The Taylor rule accurately predicted changes in the federal funds target during the 
period of Alan Greenspan’s leadership of the Federal Reserve. For the period of the late 
1970s and early 1980s, when Paul Volcker was chairman of the Federal Reserve, the 
Taylor rule predicts a federal funds rate target lower than the actual target the Fed used. 
This indicates that Chairman Volcker kept the federal funds rate at an unusually high 
level to bring down the very high inflation rates plaguing the economy in the late 1970s 
and early 1980s. In contrast, using data from the chairmanship of Arthur Burns from 
1970 to 1978, the Taylor rule predicts a federal funds rate target higher than the actual 
target. This indicates that Chairman Burns kept the federal funds rate at an unusually 
low level during these years, which helps to explain why the inflation rate grew worse. 
During the mid-2000s the actual federal funds rate was also lower than the predicted 
federal funds rate. Some economists, including Taylor, argue that these low targets for 
the federal funds rate contributed to the excessive increase in spending on housing that 
we will discuss in the next section.
Although the Taylor rule does not account for changes in the target inflation rate 
or the equilibrium interest rate, many economists view the rule as a convenient tool for 
analyzing the federal funds target.
Should the Fed Target Inflation?
Over the past decade, many economists and central bankers, including the cur-
rent Fed chair, Ben Bernanke, have proposed using inflation targeting as a frame-
work for conducting monetary policy. With inflation targeting, the central bank 
 commits to achieving a publicly announced inflation target of, for example, 2 per-
cent.  Inflation targeting does not impose an inflexible rule on the central bank. The 
central bank would still be free, for example, to take action in case of a severe reces-
sion. Nevertheless, monetary policy goals and operations would focus on inflation 
and inflation forecasts. Inflation targeting has been adopted by the central banks of 
New Zealand (1989), Canada (1991), the United Kingdom (1992), Finland (1993), 
Sweden (1993), and Spain (1994), and by the European Central Bank. Inflation tar-
geting has also been used in some newly industrializing countries, such as Chile, 
South Korea, Mexico, and South Africa, as well as in some transition economies 
in Eastern Europe, such as the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland. Experience 
with inflation targeting has varied, but typically the move to inflation targeting has 
been accompanied by lower inflation (sometimes at the cost of temporarily higher 
unemployment).
Should the Fed adopt an inflation target? Arguments in favor of inflation tar-
geting focus on four points. First, as we have already discussed, in the long run, 
real GDP returns to its potential level, and potential real GDP is not affected by 
monetary policy. Therefore, in the long run, the Fed can affect inflation but not real 
GDP. Having an explicit inflation target would draw the public’s attention to this 
fact. Second, by announcing an inflation target, the Fed would make it easier for 
households and firms to form accurate expectations of future inflation, improving 
their planning and the efficiency of the economy. Third, an announced inflation tar-
get would help institutionalize good U.S. monetary policy. An inflation target would 
reduce the chances of abrupt changes in policy occurring as members join and leave 
the FOMC. Finally, an inflation target would promote accountability for the Fed by 
providing a yardstick against which Congress and the public could measure the Fed’s 
performance.

C H A P T E R  2 6  Monetary Policy
How Does the Fed Measure Inflation?
To attain its goal of price stability, the Fed has to consider 
carefully the best way to measure the inflation rate. As we saw 
in Chapter 20, the consumer price index (CPI) is the most 
widely used measure of inflation. But we also saw that the 
CPI suffers from biases that cause it to overstate the true underlying rate of inflation. 
An alternative measure of changes in consumer prices can be constructed from the 
data gathered to calculate GDP. We saw in Chapter 19 that the GDP deflator is a broad 
measure of the price level that includes the price of every good or service that is in 
GDP. Changes in the GDP deflator are not a good measure of inflation experienced by 
the typical consumer, worker, or firm, however, because the deflator includes prices of 
goods, such as industrial equipment, that are not widely purchased. The personal con-
sumption expenditures price index (PCE) is a measure of the price level that is similar 
to the GDP deflator, except it includes only the prices of goods from the consumption 
category of GDP.
In 2000, the Fed announced that it would rely more on the PCE than on the CPI in 
tracking inflation. The Fed noted three advantages that the PCE has over the CPI:
1.  The PCE is a so-called chain-type price index, as opposed to the market-basket ap-
proach used in constructing the CPI. As we saw in Chapter 20, because consumers 
shift the mix of products they buy each year, the market-basket approach causes the 
CPI to overstate actual inflation. A chain-type price index allows the mix of prod-
ucts to change each year.
2.  The PCE includes the prices of more goods and services than the CPI, so it is a 
broader measure of inflation.
3.  Past values of the PCE can be recalculated as better ways of computing price in-
dexes are developed and as new data become available. This allows the Fed to better 
track historical trends in the inflation rate.
In 2004, the Fed announced that it would begin to rely on a subcategory of the 
PCE: the so-called core PCE, which excludes food and energy prices. Prices of food 
and energy tend to fluctuate up and down for reasons that may not be related to the 
causes of general inflation and that cannot easily be controlled by monetary policy. Oil 
prices, in particular, have moved dramatically up and down in recent years. Therefore, 
a price index that includes food and energy prices may not give a clear view of underly-
ing trends in inflation. The following graph shows movements in the CPI, the PCE, and 
the core PCE from January 1999 through September 2011. Although the three measures 
of inflation move roughly together, the core PCE has been more stable than the others. 
Note in particular that in early 2009, when the CPI and the PCE were indicating that the 
economy was experiencing deflation, the core PCE was still showing moderate inflation 
rates of about 1.5 percent.
If you want to know what the Fed thinks the current inflation rate is, the best idea 
is to look at data on the core PCE. These data are published monthly by the Bureau of 
Economic Analysis.
Making 
the 
Connection
The Fed excludes food and energy 
prices from its main measure of 
inflation.
Inflation targeting also has opponents, who typically raise three points. First,  having 
a numeric target for inflation reduces the flexibility of monetary policy to  address other 
policy goals. Second, inflation targeting assumes that the Fed can accurately forecast 
future inflation rates, which is not always the case. Finally, holding the Fed  accountable 
only for an inflation goal may make it less likely that the Fed will achieve other  important 
policy goals.
Although Ben Bernanke becoming chair of the Fed in January 2006 appeared to 
 increase the chances that the Fed would adopt a policy of inflation targeting, the neces-
sity of dealing with the recession of 2007–2009 at least temporarily pushed the issue off 
the Fed’s agenda.

Fed Policies during the 2007–2009 
Recession
As we have seen, the Fed’s traditional response to a recession is to lower the target for 
the federal funds rate. The severity of the recession of 2007–2009, particularly the prob-
lems in financial markets during those years, complicated the Fed’s job. By December 
2008, the Fed had effectively lowered the target for the federal funds rate to zero, but 
the zero interest rate alone did not achieve the Fed’s desired expansionary effect on the 
economy. In this section, we will discuss some of the additional policy measures the Fed 
took during the 2007–2009 recession. Some of these measures were used for the first 
time in the Fed’s history.
The Inflation and Deflation  
of the Housing Market Bubble
To understand the 2007–2009 recession and the difficulties in financial markets that oc-
curred during it, we need to start by considering the housing market. As we mentioned 
in the chapter opener, the Fed lowered the target for the federal funds rate during the 
2001 recession to stimulate demand for housing. The policy was successful, and most 
builders, such as Toll Brothers, experienced several years of high demand. By 2005, 
however, many economists argued that a “bubble” had formed in the housing market. 
As we discussed in Chapter 8, the price of any asset reflects the returns the owner of the 
asset expects to receive. For example, the price of a share of stock reflects the profitabil-
ity of the firm issuing the stock because the owner of a share of stock has a claim on the 
firm’s profits and assets. Many economists believe, however, that sometimes a stock mar-
ket bubble can form when the prices of stocks rise above levels that can be justified by

the profitability of the firms issuing the stock. Stock market bubbles end when enough 
investors decide stocks are overvalued and begin to sell. Why would an investor be will-
ing to pay more for a share of stock than would be justified by its underlying value? 
There are two main explanations: The investor may be caught up in the enthusiasm of 
the moment and, by failing to gather sufficient information, may overestimate the true 
value of the stock; or the investor may expect to profit from buying stock at inflated 
prices if the investor can sell the stock at an even higher price before the bubble bursts.
The price of a house should reflect the value of the housing services the house 
provides. We can use the rents charged for comparable houses in an area to measure 
the value of housing services. By 2005, in some cities, the prices of houses had risen so 
much that monthly mortgage payments were far above the monthly rent on comparable 
houses. In addition, in some cities, there was an increase in the number of buyers who 
did not intend to live in the houses they purchased but were using them as investments. 
Like stock investors during a stock market bubble, these housing investors were expect-
ing to make a profit by selling houses at higher prices than they had paid for them, and 
they were not concerned about whether the prices of the houses were above the value of 
the housing services provided.
During 2006 and 2007, it became clear that the air was rapidly escaping from the 
housing bubble. Figure 26.12 shows new home sales for each month from January 2000 
through August 2011. New home sales rose by 60 percent between January 2000 and 
July 2005 and then fell by 80 percent between July 2005 and May 2010; sales remained 
at low levels during the following year. Sales of existing homes followed a similar pat-
tern. Prices of new and existing homes in most markets also began to decline beginning 
in 2006, and the inventory of unsold homes offered for sale soared. Some homebuyers 
began having trouble making their loan payments. When lenders foreclosed on some 
of these loans, the lenders sold the homes, causing housing prices to decline further. 
Subprime loans are loans granted to borrowers with flawed credit histories. Some mort-
gage lenders that had concentrated on making subprime loans suffered heavy losses and

went out of business, and most banks and other lenders tightened the requirements for 
borrowers. This credit crunch made it more difficult for potential homebuyers to obtain 
mortgages, further depressing the market.
The decline in the housing market affected other markets as well. For example, with 
home prices falling, consumption spending on furniture, appliances, and home im-
provements declined as many households found it more difficult to borrow against the 
value of their homes.
Was the housing bubble the result of overly optimistic expectations by homebuyers 
and builders who believed that new residential construction and housing prices would 
continue to rise at rapid rates indefinitely? While overly optimistic expectations may 
have played some role in the housing bubble, many economists believe that changes in 
the market for mortgages may have played a bigger role.
The Changing Mortgage Market
Until the 1970s, the commercial banks and savings and loans that granted mortgages 
kept the loans until the borrowers paid them off. As we saw in Chapter 25, a financial as-
set such as a mortgage is a security only if it can be resold in a secondary market. Many 
members of Congress believed that home ownership could be increased by creating a 
secondary market in mortgages. If banks and savings and loans could resell mortgages, 
then, in effect, individual investors would be able to provide funds for mortgages. The 
process would work like this: If a bank or savings and loan granted a mortgage and then 
resold the mortgage to an investor, the bank could use the funds received from the in-
vestor to grant another mortgage. In this way, banks and savings and loans could grant 
more mortgage loans because they would no longer depend only on deposits for the 
funds needed to make the loans. One barrier to creating a secondary market in mort-
gages was that most investors were unwilling to buy mortgages because they were afraid 
of losing money if the borrower stopped making payments, or defaulted, on the loan.
To reassure investors, Congress used two government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs): 
the Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”) and the Federal Home Loan 
Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie Mac”). These two institutions stand between investors 
and banks that grant mortgages. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac sell bonds to investors and 
use the funds to purchase mortgages from banks. By the 1990s, a large secondary market 
existed in mortgages, with funds flowing from investors through Fannie Mae and Freddie 
Mac to banks and, ultimately, to individuals and families borrowing money to buy houses.
The Role of Investment Banks
By the 2000s, further changes had taken place in the mortgage market. First, invest-
ment banks became significant participants in the secondary market for mortgages. As 
we have seen, investment banks, such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, differ 
from commercial banks in that they do not take in deposits and rarely lend directly to 
households. Instead, investment banks concentrate on providing advice to firms issu-
ing stocks and bonds or considering mergers with other firms. Investment banks be-
gan buying mortgages, bundling large numbers of them together as bonds known as 
mortgage-backed securities, and reselling them to investors. Mortgage-backed securities 
proved very popular with investors because they often paid higher interest rates than 
other securities with comparable default risk.
Second, by the height of the housing bubble in 2005 and early 2006, lenders had 
greatly loosened the standards for obtaining a mortgage loan. Traditionally, only bor-
rowers with good credit histories and who were willing to make a down payment equal 
to at least 20 percent of the value of the house they were buying would be able to re-
ceive a mortgage. By 2005, however, lenders were issuing many mortgages to subprime 
borrowers with flawed credit histories. In addition, “Alt-A” borrowers who stated—but 
did not document—their incomes and borrowers who made very small down payments 
found it easier to take out loans. Lenders also created new types of adjustable-rate mort-
gages that allowed borrowers to pay a very low interest rate for the first few years of the 
mortgage and then pay a higher rate in later years. The chance that the borrowers using 

892 
C H A P T E R  2 6  Monetary Policy
these nontraditional mortgages would default was higher than for borrowers using 
traditional mortgages. Why would borrowers take out mortgages if they doubted that 
they could make the payments, and why would lenders grant these mortgages? The an-
swer seems to be that both borrowers and lenders were anticipating that housing prices 
would continue to rise, which would reduce the chance that borrowers would default 
on the mortgages and would also make it easier for borrowers to convert to more tradi-
tional mortgages in the future.
Unfortunately, the decline in housing prices led to rising defaults among subprime 
and Alt-A borrowers, borrowers with adjustable-rate mortgages, and borrowers who had 
made only small down payments. When borrowers began defaulting on mortgages, the 
value of many mortgage-backed securities declined sharply. Investors feared that if they 
purchased these securities, they would not receive the promised payments because the 
payments on the securities depended on borrowers making their mortgage payments, 
which an increasing number were failing to do. Many commercial and  investment banks 
owned these mortgage-backed securities, so the decline in the value of the securities 
caused these banks to suffer heavy losses. By mid-2007, the decline in the value of mort-
gage-backed securities and the large losses suffered by commercial and investment banks 
began to cause turmoil in the financial system. Many investors refused to buy mortgage-
backed securities, and some investors would buy only bonds issued by the U.S. Treasury.
The Wonderful World of Leverage
Traditionally, most people taking out a mortgage make a down 
payment equal to 20 percent of the price of the house and 
borrow the remaining 80 percent. During the housing boom, 
however, many people purchased houses with down payments 
of 5 percent or less. In this sense, borrowers were highly leveraged, which means that 
their investment in their house was made mostly with borrowed money.
To see how leverage works in the housing market, consider 
the following example: Suppose you buy a $200,000 house on 
January 1, 2014. On January 1, 2015, the price of the house—if 
you decide to sell it—has risen to $220,000. What return have you 
earned on your investment in the house? The answer depends on 
how much you invested when you bought the house. For exam-
ple, if you paid $200,000 in cash for the house, your return on 
that $200,000 investment is the $20,000 increase in the price of 
the house divided by your $200,000 investment, or 10 percent. 
Suppose that rather than paying cash, you made a down payment 
of 20 percent, or $40,000, and borrowed the rest by taking out a 
mortgage loan of $160,000. Now the return on your investment in 
the house is the $20,000 increase in the price of the house divided 
by your $40,000 investment, or 50 percent. If the down payment 
is less than 20 percent, your return on investment will be higher. 
The second column in the table below shows how the return on your investment in-
creases as your down payment decreases:

Fed Policies during the 2007–2009 Recession 
893
The Fed and the Treasury Department Respond
Because the problems in financial markets resulting from the bursting of the housing 
bubble were so profound, the Fed entered into an unusual partnership with the U.S. 
Treasury Department to develop suitable policies. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and 
U.S. Treasury Secretaries Henry Paulson (in the Bush administration) and Timothy 
Geithner (in the Obama administration) responded to the crisis by intervening in fi-
nancial markets in unprecedented ways.
Initial Fed and Treasury Actions The financial crisis significantly worsened 
following the bankruptcy of the investment bank Lehman Brothers on September 15, 
2008. So it is useful to look at the actions taken by the Fed and Treasury before and 
after that date. First, although the Fed traditionally made loans only to commercial 
banks, in March 2008, it announced it would temporarily make discount loans to pri-
mary dealers—firms that participate in regular open market transactions with the Fed. 
This change was intended to provide short-term funds to these dealers, some of which 
are investment banks. Second, also in March, the Fed announced that it would loan up 
to $200 billion of Treasury securities in exchange for mortgage-backed securities. This 
temporary program made it possible for primary dealers that owned mortgage-backed 
securities that were difficult or impossible to sell, to have access to Treasury securities 
that they could use as collateral for short-term loans. Third, once again in March, the 
Fed and the Treasury helped JPMorgan Chase acquire the investment bank Bear  Stearns, 
which was on the edge of failing. The Fed agreed that if JPMorgan Chase would acquire 
Bear Stearns, the Fed would guarantee any losses JPMorgan Chase suffered on Bear 
Stearns’s holdings of mortgage-backed securities, up to a limit of $29 billion. The Fed 
and Treasury were convinced that the failure of Bear Stearns had the potential of caus-
ing a financial panic, as many investors and financial firms would have stopped making 
short-term loans to other investment banks. Finally, in early September, the Treasury 
moved to have the federal government take control of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. 
Although Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had been sponsored by the federal government, 
An investment financed at least partly by borrowing is called a leveraged investment. 
As this example shows, the larger the fraction of an investment financed by borrow-
ing, the greater the degree of leverage in the investment, and the greater the potential 
return. But as the third column in the table shows, the reverse is also true: The greater 
the leverage, the greater the potential loss. To see why, consider once again that you buy 
a house for $200,000, except that in this case, after one year the price of the house falls 
to $180,000. If you paid $200,000 in cash for the house—so your leverage was zero—the 
$20,000 decline in the price of the house represents a loss of 10 percent of your invest-
ment. But if you made a down payment of only $10,000 and borrowed the remaining 
$190,000, then the $20,000 decline in the price of the house represents a loss of 200 per-
cent of your investment. In fact, the house is now worth $10,000 less than the amount of 
your mortgage loan. The equity in your house is the difference between the market price 
of the house and the amount you owe on a loan. If the amount you owe is greater than 
the price of the house, you have negative equity. A home owner who has negative equity 
is also said to be “upside down” on his or her mortgage.
When the housing bubble burst and housing prices started to fall, many  people 
found that they had negative equity. In that situation, some people defaulted on 
their loans, sometimes by simply moving out and abandoning their homes. Lever-
age had contributed to the housing boom and bust and the severity of the 2007–2009 
recession.

they were actually private businesses whose stock was bought and sold on the New York 
Stock Exchange. Under the Treasury’s plan, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were each 
provided with up to $100 billion in exchange for 80 percent ownership of the firms. 
The firms were placed under the supervision of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. 
The Treasury believed that the bankruptcy of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would have 
caused a collapse in confidence in mortgage-backed securities, further  devastating this 
already weak housing market.
Responses to the Failure of Lehman Brothers Some economists and policy-
makers criticized the decision by the Fed and the Treasury to help arrange the sale of 
Bear Stearns to JPMorgan Chase. Their main concern was with what is known as the 
moral hazard problem, which is the possibility that managers of financial firms such as 
Bear Stearns might make riskier investments if they believe that the federal government 
will save them from bankruptcy. The Treasury and Fed acted to save Bear Stearns be-
cause they believed that the failure of a large financial firm could have wider economic 
repercussions. As we discussed in Chapter 25, when a financial firm sells off its holdings 
of bonds and other assets, it causes their prices to fall, which in turn can undermine the 
financial position of other firms that also own these assets. In September 2008, when the 
investment bank Lehman Brothers was near bankruptcy, the Fed and the Treasury had 
to weigh the moral hazard problem against the possibility that the failure of Lehman 
Brothers would lead to further declines in asset prices and endanger the financial posi-
tions of other firms.
The Fed and the Treasury decided to allow Lehman Brothers to go bankrupt, which 
it did on September 15. The adverse reaction in financial markets was stronger than the 
Fed and Treasury had expected, which led them to reverse course two days later, when 
the Fed agreed to provide an $85 billion loan to the American International Group 
(AIG)—the largest insurance company in the United States—in exchange for an 80 per-
cent ownership stake, effectively giving the federal government control of the company. 
One important result of the failure of Lehman Brothers was the heavy losses suffered 
by Reserve Primary Fund, a money market mutual fund that had invested in loans to 
Lehman Brothers. The problems at Reserve led many investors to withdraw their funds 
from it and other money market funds. These withdrawals reduced the ability of the 
money market funds to purchase commercial paper from corporations. Because in re-
cent years corporations had become dependent on selling commercial paper to finance 
their operations, the Treasury and the Fed moved to stabilize this market and ensure that 
the flow of funds from investors to corporations continued. The Treasury announced a 
plan to provide insurance for deposits in money market mutual funds, similar to the 
existing insurance on bank deposits. The Fed announced that for a limited time it would 
lend directly to corporations by purchasing three-month commercial paper issued by 
non-financial corporations.
Finally, in October 2008, Congress passed the Troubled Asset Relief Program 
(TARP), under which the Treasury attempted to stabilize the commercial banking 
system by providing funds to banks in exchange for stock. Taking partial ownership 
positions in private commercial banks was an unprecedented action for the federal 
government.
Clearly, the recession of 2007–2009 and the accompanying financial crisis had led 
the Fed and the Treasury to implement new approaches to policy. Many of these new 
approaches were controversial because they involved partial government ownership of 
financial firms, implicit guarantees to large financial firms that they would not be al-
lowed to go bankrupt, and unprecedented intervention in financial markets. Although 
the approaches were new, they were intended to achieve the traditional macroeco-
nomic policy goals of high employment, price stability, and stability of financial mar-
kets. What remains to be seen is whether these new approaches represent a permanent 
increase in federal government involvement in U.S. financial markets or whether the 
end of the recession will see policy return to more traditional approaches.

 
Conclusion 
895
Conclusion
Monetary policy is one way governments pursue goals for inflation, employment, and 
financial stability. Many journalists and politicians refer to the chairman of the Federal 
Reserve as second only to the president of the United States in his ability to affect the 
U.S. economy. Congress and the president, however, also use their power over spending 
and taxes to try to stabilize the economy. In Chapter 27, we discuss how fiscal policy—
changes in government spending and taxes—affect the economy.

serve’s new policies designed to reenergize the sluggish U.S. housing market.

Economics in Your Life
Should You Buy a House during a Recession?
At the beginning of this chapter, we asked whether buying a house during a recession is a good 
idea. Clearly, there are many considerations to keep in mind when buying a house, which is the 
largest purchase you are likely to make in your lifetime. Included among these considerations are 
the price of the house relative to other comparable houses in the neighborhood, whether house 
prices in the neighborhood have been rising or falling, and the location of the house relative to 
stores, work, and good schools. Also important is the interest rate you will have to pay on the 
mortgage loan you would need in order to buy the house. As we have seen in this chapter, dur-
ing a recession the Fed often takes actions to lower interest rates. So, mortgage rates are typically 
lower during a recession than at other times. You may want to take advantage of low interest 
rates to buy a house during a recession. But, recessions are also times of rising unemployment, and 
you would not want to make a commitment to borrow a lot of money for 15 or more years if you 
were in significant danger of losing your job. We can conclude, then, that if your job seems secure, 
buying a house during a recession may be a good idea.

Fed Attempts to Stimulate Housing  
Market . . . Again
ATLANTIC
Will the Fed’s New 
Policies Revitalize 
the Housing Market?
Congress is gridlocked, consumers 
are pessimistic, and firms are barely 
hiring. To speed this recovery up—or 
to prevent a double dip—it might be 
up to the Federal Reserve. Last week 
it announced its latest attempt to re-
vitalize the economy. Its chief target 
appears to be the still anemic housing 
market. Will the new policies work?
The Fed’s Plan
 The central bank will take two 
different actions meant to jumpstart 
the economy. First, there’s “Operation 
Twist.” The Fed will attempt to push 
down long-term interest rates by pur-
chasing $400 billion in Treasury se-
curities with six to 30 year terms. The 
program will last for nine months—
through June 2012.
But here’s the clever part: the 
Fed will sell shorter-dated Treasuries 
in exchange for bank reserves. This 
will prevent the Fed from having to 
expand its balance sheet to purchase 
longer-term Treasury securities. The 
relative increase in short term rates 
should be small, since short-term 
Treasuries are in high demand. . . .
The Fed announced another 
policy change as well. It has been re-
investing its maturing principal in 
additional Treasury securities. The 
central bank will refine that approach 
by investing maturing principal from 
its agency bonds and mortgage-
backed securities in additional agency 
mortgage-backed securities. In this 
way, it will keep the size of its mort-
gage  securities exposure level. But 
more importantly, this action will also 
increase the demand for mortgage-
backed securities, which should push 
down mortgage interest rates.
The Medicine the Housing Market 
Needs?
In fact, the major target for all 
of the Fed’s new action appears to be 
the U.S. housing market. Both Opera-
tion Twist and the new MBS reinvest-
ment policy should help to push down 
mortgage interest rates. And they’re 
low already: this week Freddie Mac 
reports the  average 30-year mortgage 
interest rate at just 4.09%. Through 
the Fed’s new policy, rates should eas-
ily dip below 4%.
Operation Twist could also help 
the reinvestment policy to have a 
more dramatic effect: as mortgage 
interest rates begin to decline, we 
should see mortgage refinancing soar. 
That means more maturing principal, 
which will provide even more capital 
for the Fed to reinvest in MBS to push 
down mortgage interest rates even 
further. . . .
But Will It Boost the Economy?
 If mortgage interest rates de-
cline significantly, then we’ll almost 
certainly see more refinancing occur. 
That will provide a little bit of stimu-
lus. Some Americans will lower their 
monthly mortgage payment. The im-
pact that this has on the economy de-
pends on how much these payments 
are lowered and how many people take 
advantage of the opportunity. That ad-
ditional money they’ll have can then 
be spent to stimulate the economy.
 What’s less clear, however, is 
whether or not the very low mortgage 
interest rates will lead to more home 
sales. Over the past year, even though 
interest rates were extremely low, they 
weren’t enough to push more buyers 
into the market. Will even lower rates 
do the trick?
If home sales do increase, then 
prices may begin to stabilize—at least 
for a time. If the market isn’t near the 
bottom, then once interest rates begin 
rising again, sales could decline and 
prices could begin to drop again. This 
is what we saw when the home buyer 
credit created a temporary burst of 
demand.
What we probably won’t see is a 
significant increase in construction. 
The market still has plenty of exist-
ing inventory to work through before 
more homes are needed. So unless 
home demand truly explodes, we 
shouldn’t expect a tidal wave of con-
struction jobs.
As always, the effectiveness of the 
Fed’s policy relies on the willingness of 
consumers, banks, and businesses to 
play along. First, Americans will need 
to seek refinancing and home pur-
chases. Then, the banks must be will-
ing to provide the credit for those new 
loans. If that encourages more spend-
ing due to consumers having more 
money in their pockets, then firms 
could begin hiring more aggressively. 
That’s the plan—we’ll see if it works.

Key Points in the Article
In late 2011, the Federal Reserve an-
nounced two new policies to stimulate the 
economy. One policy, referred to as “Op-
eration Twist,” has the Fed purchasing lon-
ger-term Treasury securities in an attempt 
to lower long-term interest rates. With the 
second policy, the Fed will invest matur-
ing principal from its mortgage-backed 
securities and agency bonds in additional 
mortgage-backed securities, a move the 
Fed hopes will lower interest rates on 
mortgages. The primary focus of both 
policies is aiding the still-sluggish U.S. 
housing market. A decline in mortgage 
rates should encourage refinancing, lead-
ing to lower monthly mortgage payments 
and, therefore, more income to spend on 
other goods and services. Lower mort-
gage rates might also boost home sales, 
and this increase in demand may help sta-
bilize housing prices. Whether these new 
Fed policies will be effective in boosting 
the economy by stimulating the housing 
market depends both on the willingness of 
banks to provide new mortgage loans and 
on the willingness of consumers to take 
advantage of the lower mortgage rates to 
either refinance existing loans or to pur-
chase new homes.
Analyzing the News
a In December 2008, the Fed pushed the 
target for the federal funds rate to 
nearly zero, where it remained through 
2011. Due to the severity of the 2007–2009 
recession, this very low rate still did little to 
stimulate the economy. Because the fed-
eral funds rate cannot go below zero, the 
Fed embarked on a policy of quantitative 
easing: purchasing longer-term securities 
such as 10-year Treasury notes and certain 
mortgage-backed securities in an effort to 
keep mortgage rates low and help increase 
the demand for housing. With the economy 
remaining weak and the housing market 
still lethargic, the Fed announced its inten-
tion of implementing two new policies to at-
tempt to boost the economy by increasing 
the demand for housing. With Operation 
Twist, the Fed will attempt to lower long-
term interest rates by selling shorter-term 
Treasury securities and using the proceeds 
to buy Treasury securities with 6- to 30-
year terms. The Fed will also invest the ma- 
turing principal from its mortgage-backed 
securities in additional mortgage-backed 
securities, which should reduce mortgage 
interest rates by increasing the demand for 
these securities.
b The Fed hopes that a significant 
 decrease in mortgage rates will encour-
age current homeowners to refinance their 
mortgages to lower their monthly pay-
ments. Lower mortgage payments will pro-
vide these homeowners with additional 
funds that can be spent on more goods 
and services, helping to stimulate the 
economy.

annual interest rates for federal funds,

the rates on these longer-term Treasury se-
curities, the Fed hopes to reduce mortgage 
rates and increase home sales. An increase 
in home sales should help to stabilize home 
prices and boost the economy.
Thinking Critically 
About Policy
1. More than 80 percent of mortgages in 
the United States involve fixed inter-
est rates rather than adjustable interest 
rates. How would the effect of monetary 
policy on aggregate demand change 
if there were more adjustable-rate 
 mortgages than fixed-rate mortgages?
2. According to the figure, the federal 
funds rate began to increase dramati-
cally in 2004, reaching a level closest to 
the 30-year fixed mortgage rate in 2007 
before rapidly falling from 2007 to 2009. 
Explain how this rate change corre-
sponds to the bursting of the U.S. hous-
ing bubble in 2005 and what the change 
in the federal funds rate indicates about 
the monetary policy employed by the 
Fed beginning in 2004.

Summary
Monetary policy is the actions the Fed takes to manage the money 
supply and interest rates to pursue its macroeconomic policy 
goals. The Fed has four monetary policy goals that are intended to 
promote a well-functioning economy: price stability, high employ-
ment, stability of financial markets and institutions, and economic 
growth.

1.8 Stock prices rose rapidly in 2005, as did housing prices 
in many parts of the country. By 2008, both stock prices 
and housing prices were declining sharply. Some econo-

the prices of assets such as shares of stock or houses can 
damage the economy. Currently, stabilizing asset prices is 
not one of the Federal Reserve’s policy goals. In what ways 
would a goal of stabilizing asset prices be different from 
the four goals listed on page 866? Do you believe that sta-
bilizing asset prices should be added to the list of the Fed’s 
policy goals? Briefly explain.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE: Describe the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy targets and explain how 
expansionary and contractionary monetary policies affect the interest rate.
Summary
The Fed’s monetary policy targets are economic variables that it 
can affect directly and that in turn affect variables such as real 
GDP and the price level that are closely related to the Fed’s pol-
icy goals. The two main monetary policy targets are the money 
supply and the interest rate. The Fed has most often chosen to 
use the interest rate as its monetary policy target. The Federal 
Open Market Committee announces a target for the federal 
funds rate after each meeting. The federal funds rate is the in-
terest rate banks charge each other for overnight loans. To lower 
the interest rate, the Fed increases the money supply. To raise the 
interest rate, the Fed decreases the money supply. In a graphi-
cal analysis of the money market, when the money supply curve 
shifts to the right, the result is a movement down the money 
demand curve and a new equilibrium at a lower interest rate. 
When the money supply curve shifts to the left, the result is a 
movement up the money demand curve and a new equilibrium 
at a higher interest rate.

2.8 In response to problems in financial markets and a slowing 
economy, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) 
began lowering its target for the federal funds rate from

FOMC cut its federal funds rate target in a series of steps. 
Writing in the New York Times, economist Steven Levitt 
observed, “The Fed has been pouring more money into the 
banking system by cutting the target federal funds rate to 
0 to 0.25 percent in December 2008.” What is the relation-
ship between the federal funds rate falling and the money 
supply increasing? How does lowering the target for the 
federal funds rate “pour money” into the banking system?

 26.3 
LEARNING OBJECTIVE: Use aggregate demand and aggregate supply graphs to show the effects of 
monetary policy on real GDP and the price level.
Summary
An expansionary monetary policy lowers interest rates to in-
crease consumption, investment, and net exports. This increased 
spending causes the aggregate demand (AD) curve to shift out 
more than it otherwise would, raising the level of real GDP and 
the price level. An expansionary monetary policy can help the Fed 
achieve its goal of high employment. A contractionary monetary 
policy raises interest rates to decrease consumption, investment, 
and net exports. This decreased spending causes the aggregate 
demand curve to shift out less than it otherwise would, reducing 
both the level of real GDP and the inflation rate below what they 
would be in the absence of policy. A contractionary monetary pol-
icy can help the Fed achieve its goal of price stability.

3.7 An article by three economists at the Federal Reserve Bank

“ After a long period of unemployment, affected workers 
may become effectively unemployable.” They conclude 
that: “Policy options [such as providing additional train-
ing] that increase the ability of unemployed workers to 
find work . . . may be more effective at reducing unemploy-
ment than additional monetary stimulus.”
 
a. What is a policy of monetary stimulus?

3.9 [Related to the Chapter Opener on page 865] At the be-
ginning of 2005, Robert Toll, CEO of Toll Brothers, argued 
that the United States was not experiencing a housing bub-

restrictions imposed by local governments on building 
new houses. He argued that the restrictions resulted from 
“NIMBY”—“Not in My Back Yard”—politics. Many ex-
isting homeowners are reluctant to see nearby farms and 
undeveloped land turned into new housing developments. 
As a result, according to Toll, “Towns don’t want anything 
built.” Why would the factors mentioned by Robert Toll 
cause housing prices to rise? Would it be possible to decide 
whether these factors or a bubble was the cause of rising 
housing prices?

between August [2010] and the end of the year. That, of 
course, is what the Fed had been hoping for.”

Model, pages 880–884

LEARNING OBJECTIVE: Use the dynamic aggregate demand and aggregate supply model to analyze 
monetary policy.
Summary
We can use the dynamic aggregate demand and aggregate supply 
model introduced in Chapter 24 to look more closely at expansion-
ary and contractionary monetary policies. The dynamic aggregate 
demand and aggregate supply model takes into account that (1) 
the economy experiences continuing inflation, with the price 
level rising every year, and (2) the economy experiences long-run 
growth, with the LRAS curve shifting to the right every year. In the 
dynamic model, an expansionary monetary policy tries to ensure 
that the aggregate demand curve will shift far enough to the right 
to bring about macroeconomic equilibrium with real GDP equal 
to potential GDP. A contractionary monetary policy  attempts to 
offset movements in aggregate demand that would cause mac-
roeconomic equilibrium to occur at a level of real GDP that is 
greater than potential real GDP.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE: Discuss the Fed’s setting of monetary policy targets.
Summary
Some economists have argued that the Fed should use the money 
supply, rather than an interest rate, as its monetary policy tar-
get. Milton Friedman and other monetarists argued that the Fed 
should adopt a monetary growth rule of increasing the money 
supply every year at a fixed rate. Support for this proposal de-
clined after 1980 because the relationship between movements 
in the money supply and movements in real GDP and the price 
level weakened. John Taylor analyzed the factors involved in Fed 
decision making and developed the Taylor rule for federal funds 
targeting. The Taylor rule links the Fed’s target for the federal 
funds rate to economic variables. Over the past decade, many 
economists and central bankers have expressed significant inter-
est in using inflation targeting, under which monetary policy is 
conducted to commit the central bank to achieving a publicly an-
nounced inflation target. A number of foreign central banks have 
adopted inflation targeting, but the Fed has not. The Fed’s perfor-
mance in the 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s generally received high 
marks from economists, even without formal inflation targeting.

Review Questions
 
5.1 What is a monetary rule, as opposed to a monetary policy? 
What monetary rule would Milton Friedman have liked 
the Fed to follow? Why has support for a monetary rule of 
the kind advocated by Friedman declined since 1980?
 
5.2 For more than 20 years, the Fed has used the federal funds 
rate as its monetary policy target. Why doesn’t the Fed tar-
get the money supply at the same time?
 
5.3 What is the Taylor rule? What is its purpose?
Problems and Applications
 
5.4 Suppose that the equilibrium real federal funds rate is 2 
percent and the target rate of inflation is 2 percent. Use the 
following information and the Taylor rule to calculate the 
federal funds rate target:
Current inflation rate 5 4 percent
Potential real GDP 5 $14.0 trillion
Real GDP 5 $14.14 trillion
 
5.5 According to an article in the Economist:
Calculations by David Mackie, of J.P. Mor-
gan, show that virtually throughout the past 
six years, interest rates in the euro area have 
been lower than a Taylor rule would have 
prescribed, refuting the popular wisdom that 
the [European Central Bank] cares less about 
growth than does the Fed.
 
 Why would keeping interest rates “lower than a Taylor rule 
would have prescribed” be an indication that the European 
Central Bank cared more about growth than popular wis-
dom held?
From “The European Central Bank: Haughty Indifference, or Mas-
terly Inactivity?” Economist, July 14, 2005.
 
5.6 Glenn Rudebusch, an economist at the Federal Reserve 
Bank of San Francisco, argues that if the Fed had followed 
the Taylor rule during the recession of 2007–2009, then by 
the end of 2009 the target for the federal funds rate would 
have been −5 percent. Provide values for the Taylor rule 
equation given on page 886 that would result in a negative 
target for the federal funds rate. Is it possible for the federal 
funds rate to be negative?
Based on Glenn Rudebusch, “The Fed’s Monetary Policy Response to 
the Current Crisis,” FRBSF Economic Letter, May 22, 2009.
 
5.7 While serving as the president of the Federal Reserve Bank 
of St. Louis, William Poole stated, “Although my own pref-
erence is for zero inflation properly managed, I believe that 
a central bank consensus on some other numerical goal of 
reasonably low inflation is more important than the ex-
act number.” Briefly explain why the economy might gain 
the benefits of an explicit inflation target even if the target 
chosen is not a zero rate of inflation.

of St. Louis Review, Vol. 89, No. 1, January/February 2007, p. 4.
 
5.8 [Related to the Making the Connection on page 888] If 
the core PCE is a better measure of the inflation rate than 
is the CPI, why is the CPI more widely used? In particular, 
can you think of reasons the federal government uses the 
CPI when deciding how much to increase Social Security 
payments to retired workers to keep the purchasing power 
of the payments from declining?

LEARNING OBJECTIVE: Discuss the policies the Federal Reserve used during the 2007–2009 recession.
Summary
A housing bubble that began to deflate in 2006 led to the recession 
of 2007–2009 and an accompanying financial crisis. In  response, 
the Federal Reserve instituted a variety of policy actions. In a series 
of steps, it cut the target for the federal funds rate from 5.25 percent 
in September 2007 to effectively zero in December 2008. The de-
cline in the housing market caused wider problems in the financial 
system, as defaults on home mortgages rose and the value of mort-
gage-backed securities declined. The Fed and the U.S. Treasury De-
partment implemented a series of new policies to provide liquidity 
and restore confidence. The Fed expanded the types of firms eli-
gible for discount loans and began lending directly to corporations 
by purchasing commercial paper. Under the Troubled Asset Relief 
Program, the Treasury provided financial support to banks and 
other financial firms in exchange for part ownership. The Treasury 
also moved to have the federal government take control of Fannie 
Mae and Freddie Mac, government-sponsored firms that play a 
central role in the mortgage market. The failure of the investment 
bank Lehman Brothers in September 2008 led to a deepening of 
the financial crisis and provided the motivation for some of the 
new policies. Ultimately, the new policies stabilized the financial 
system, but their long-term effects remain the subject of debate.

6.3 Some economists argue that one cause of the financial 
problems resulting from the housing crisis was the fact that 
lenders who grant mortgages no longer typically hold the 
mortgages until they are paid off. Instead, lenders usually 
resell their mortgages in secondary markets. How might a 
lender intending to resell a mortgage act differently than a 
lender intending to hold a mortgage?
 
6.4 An article in a Federal Reserve publication observes that 
“20 or 30 years ago, local financial institutions were the 
only option for some borrowers. Today, borrowers have ac-
cess to national (and even international) sources of mort-
gage finance.” What caused this change in the sources of 
mortgage finance? What would be the likely consequence 
of this change for the interest rates borrowers have to pay 
on mortgages? Briefly explain.

Mortgage Market and Mortgage Finance,” Federal Reserve Bank of St. 
Louis Review, January/February 2008.
 
6.5 Charles Calomiris, an economist at Columbia Univer-
sity, was quoted as saying the following of the initiatives 
of the Treasury and Fed during the financial crisis of 
2007–2009: “It has been a really head-spinning range of 
unprecedented and bold actions. . . . That is exactly as it 
should be. But I’m not saying that it’s without some cost 
and without some risk.” What was unprecedented about 
the Treasury and Fed’s actions? What risks did these ac-
tions involve?

Criticism,” New York Times, May 28, 2008.
 
6.6 Recall that “securitization” is the process of turning a loan, 
such as a mortgage, into a bond that can be bought and 
sold in secondary markets. An article in the Economist 
notes:
That securitization caused more subprime 
mortgages to be written is not in doubt. By 
offering access to a much deeper pool of capi-
tal, securitization helped to bring down the 
cost of mortgages and made home-ownership 
more affordable for borrowers with poor credit 
histories.
 
 What is a “subprime mortgage”? What is a “deeper pool of 
capital”? Why would securitization give mortgage borrow-
ers access to a deeper pool of capital? Would a subprime 
borrower be likely to pay a higher or a lower interest rate 
than a borrower with a better credit history? Under what 
circumstances might a lender prefer to loan money to a 
borrower with a poor credit history rather than to a bor-
rower with a good credit history? Briefly explain.
From “Ruptured Credit,” Economist, May 15, 2008.
 
6.7 In the fall of 2011, investors began to fear that some Eu-
ropean governments, particularly Greece and Italy, might 
default on the bonds they had issued, making the prices 
of the bonds fall sharply. Many European banks owned 
these bonds, and some investors worried that these 
banks might also be in financial trouble. An article in 
the Economist magazine referred to the “prospect of an-
other Lehman moment.” The article noted that, “Govern-
ments are once again having to step in to support their 
banks.” What did the article mean by another “Lehman 
moment”? Why might European governments have felt 
the need to support their banks in order to avoid another 
Lehman moment?

Economics in Your Life
What Would You Do with $500?
Suppose that the federal government announces that it will immediately mail you, and everyone 
else in the economy, a $500 tax rebate. In addition, you expect that in future years, your taxes will 
also be $500 less than they would otherwise have been. How will you respond to this increase in 
your disposable income? What effect will this tax rebate likely have on equilibrium real GDP in 
the short run? As you read the chapter, see if you can answer these questions. You can check your 
 answers against those we provide on page 935 at the end of this chapter.
economists argue that government spend-
ing shifts employment from one group of 
workers to another but doesn’t increase total 
employment. Casey Mulligan, an economist 
at the University of Chicago, compares the 
effect of increases in government spending 
on projects like the Caldecott Tunnel to the 
effect of the New York Yankees building a 
new Yankee Stadium on the north side of 
East 161st Street in New York, across the 
street from the old Yankee Stadium on the 
south side of East 161st Street: “Not surpris-
ingly, . . . spending by consumers, news or-
ganizations and entertainment businesses, 
among others, on the north side of East 
161st Street was a lot more than it had been 
in years past. . . . [But] much of what hap-
pened north of East 161st Street was just 
a displacement of activity from the south 
side, rather than a creation of new activity.” 
The debate over the effects of govern-
ment spending were particularly important 
during 2011 because the economy was re-
covering slowly from the 2007–2009 reces-
sion, with the unemployment rate remaining 
above 9 percent. In this chapter, we will ex-
amine discretionary fiscal policy and the 
debate over its effects. AN INSIDE LOOK 
AT POLICY on page 936 discusses whether 
government-sponsored infrastructure 
spending is an effective means to create jobs 
in a slow-growing U.S. economy.

Tutor-Saliba was founded in Southern Cali-
fornia in 1949 and is today one of the larg-
est heavy construction firms in the United 
States. In the fall of 2011, workers employed 
by Tutor-Saliba were hard at work on the 
Caldecott Tunnel in Northern Califor-
nia. The project would expand the tunnel 
through the Berkeley Hills from six lanes to 
eight in order to ease congestion between 
the cities of Orinda and Oakland. Part of 
the funding for the project came from the 
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act 
(ARRA, often referred to as the “stimulus 
bill”), which President Barack Obama and 
Congress had enacted in early 2009, in an 
 attempt to increase aggregate demand dur-
ing the recession of 2007–2009. Without 
this funding, the state of California would 
not have gone ahead with the project. The 
ARRA is an example of discretionary fiscal 
policy aimed at increasing real GDP and 
employment. To carry out the Caldecott 
Tunnel project,  Tutor-Saliba hired an addi-
tional 106 workers. A spokesperson for the 
state agency in charge of the project argued 
that the increased employment effects from 
the project were even larger: “There is a rip-
ple effect. There’s truckers and equipment 
builders, and the deli in Orinda has never 
been as busy before.”
The project to expand the Caldecott 
Tunnel is an example of increased govern-
ment spending leading to increased em-
ployment. Or is it? A majority of economists 
agree that increased government spending 
leads to increased employment. But some

I
n Chapter 26, we discussed how the Federal Reserve uses monetary policy to pur-
sue macroeconomic policy goals, including price stability and high employment. In 
this chapter, we will explore how the government uses fiscal policy, which involves 
changes in taxes and government purchases, to achieve similar policy goals. As we 
have seen, in the short run, the price level and the levels of real GDP and total employment 
in the economy depend on aggregate demand and short-run aggregate supply. The govern-
ment can affect the levels of both aggregate demand and aggregate supply through fiscal 
policy. We will explore how Congress and the president decide which fiscal policy actions to 
take to achieve their goals. We will also discuss the debates among economists and policy-
makers over the effectiveness of fiscal policy.
What Is Fiscal Policy?
Since the end of World War II, the federal government has been committed under the 
Employment Act of 1946 to intervening in the economy “to promote maximum em-
ployment, production, and purchasing power.” As we saw in Chapter 26, the Federal 
Reserve closely monitors the economy, and the Federal Open Market Committee meets 
eight times per year to decide whether to change monetary policy. Less frequently, 
Congress and the president also make changes in taxes and government purchases to 
achieve macroeconomic policy objectives, such as high employment, price stability, and 
high rates of economic growth. Changes in federal taxes and spending that are intended 
to achieve macroeconomic policy objectives are called fiscal policy.
What Fiscal Policy Is and What It Isn’t
In the United States, federal, state, and local governments all have responsibility for tax-
ing and spending. Economists typically use the term fiscal policy to refer only to the 
actions of the federal government. State and local governments sometimes change their 
taxing and spending policies to aid their local economies, but these are not fiscal policy 
actions because they are not intended to affect the national economy. The federal gov-
ernment makes many decisions about taxes and spending, but not all of these decisions 
are fiscal policy actions because they are not intended to achieve macroeconomic policy 
goals. For example, a decision to cut the taxes of people who buy hybrid cars is an envi-
ronmental policy action, not a fiscal policy action. Similarly, the spending increases to 
fund the war on terrorism and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were part of defense 
and homeland security policy, not fiscal policy.
Automatic Stabilizers versus Discretionary  
Fiscal Policy
There is an important distinction between automatic stabilizers and discretionary fiscal 
policy. Some types of government spending and taxes, which automatically increase and 
decrease along with the business cycle, are referred to as automatic stabilizers. The 
word automatic in this case refers to the fact that changes in these types of spending 
and taxes happen without actions by the government. For example, when the economy 
is expanding and employment is increasing, government spending on unemployment 
insurance payments to workers who have lost their jobs will automatically decrease. 
During a recession, as employment declines, this type of spending will automatically 
increase. Similarly, when the economy is expanding and incomes are rising, the amount 
the government collects in taxes will increase as people pay additional taxes on their 
higher incomes. When the economy is in recession, the amount the government collects 
in taxes will fall.
With discretionary fiscal policy, the government takes actions to change spending 
or taxes. The tax cuts Congress passed in 2008, 2009, and 2010 are examples of discre-
tionary fiscal policy actions.

An Overview of Government Spending and Taxes
To provide a context for understanding fiscal policy, it is important to understand the 
big picture of government taxing and spending. Before the Great Depression of the 
1930s, the majority of government spending took place at the state and local levels. As 
Figure 27.1 shows, the size of the federal government expanded significantly during the 
crisis of the Great Depression. Since World War II, the federal government’s share of 
total government expenditures has been between two-thirds and three-quarters.
Economists often measure government spending relative to the size of the economy 
by calculating government spending as a percentage of GDP. Remember that there is a 
difference between federal government purchases and federal government expenditures. 
When the federal government purchases an aircraft carrier or the services of an FBI 
agent, it receives a good or service in return. Federal government expenditures include 
purchases plus all other federal government spending. As Figure 27.2 shows, federal 
government purchases as a percentage of GDP have actually been falling since the end 
of the Korean War in the early 1950s. Total federal expenditures as a percentage of GDP 
rose from 1950 to the early 1990s and then fell from 1992 to 2001, before rising again. 
The decline in expenditures between 1992 and 2001 was partly the result of the end of 
the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United States, which allowed for a sub-
stantial reduction in defense spending. Real federal government spending on national 
defense declined by almost 25 percent between 1990 and 1998, before rising by more

Federal Purchases and Federal 
Expenditures as a Percentage 
of GDP, 1950–2010
As a fraction of GDP, the federal government’s 
purchases of goods and services have been 
declining since the Korean War in the early 
1950s. Total expenditures by the federal 
government—including transfer payments—
as a fraction of GDP slowly rose from 1950 
through the early 1990s and fell from 1992 
to 2001, before rising again. The recession 
of 2007–2009 and the slow recovery that 
followed led to a surge in federal government 
expenditures causing them to rise to their 
highest level as a percentage of GDP since 
World War II.

than 60 percent between 1998 and 2010 in response to the war on terrorism and the 
wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The recession of 2007–2009 and the slow recovery that 
followed led to a surge in federal government expenditures causing them to rise to their 
highest level as a percentage of GDP since World War II.
In addition to purchases, there are three other categories of federal government ex-
penditures: interest on the national debt, grants to state and local governments, and trans-
fer payments. Interest on the national debt represents payments to holders of the bonds 
the federal government has issued to borrow money. Grants to state and local govern-
ments are payments made by the federal government to support government activity 
at the state and local levels. For example, to help reduce crime, Congress implemented 
a program of grants to local governments to hire more police officers. The largest and 
fastest-growing category of federal expenditures is transfer payments. Some of these 
programs, such as Social Security and unemployment insurance, began in the 1930s. 
Others, such as Medicare, which finances health care for the elderly, or the food stamps 
and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families programs, which are intended to aid the 
poor, began in the 1960s or later.
Figure 27.3 shows that in 2010, transfer payments were 46.6 percent of federal gov-
ernment expenditures. In the 1960s, transfer payments were only about 25 percent of 
federal government expenditures. As the U.S. population ages and medical costs con-
tinue to increase, federal government spending on the Social Security and Medicare 
programs will continue to increase, causing transfer payments to consume an increasing 
share of federal expenditures. Figure 27.3 shows that spending on most of the federal 
government’s day-to-day activities—including running federal agencies such as the En-
vironmental Protection Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the National Park 
Service, and the Immigration and Naturalization Service—makes up only 9.4 percent of 
federal government expenditures.
Figure 27.4 shows that in 2010, the federal government raised 36.9 percent of its 
revenue from individual income taxes. Payroll taxes to fund the Social Security and

percent of the federal budget—and spending 
on everything else the federal government

agents, to operating the national parks, to 
supporting scientific research—which makes 
up 9.4 percent of the budget. In addition to 
purchases, there are three other categories of

raised 13.6 percent of federal revenues. The remaining 9.6 percent of federal revenues 
were raised from excise taxes on certain products, such as cigarettes and gasoline, from 
tariffs on goods imported from other countries, and from other sources, such as pay-
ments by companies that cut timber on federal lands.
Is Spending on Social Security and 
Medicare a Fiscal Time Bomb?
Social Security, established in 1935 to 
provide payments to retired workers, be-
gan as a “pay-as-you-go” system, meaning that payments to cur-
rent retirees were paid from taxes collected from current workers. 
In the early years of the program, many workers were paying into 
the system, and there were relatively few retirees. For example, in 
1940, more than 35 million workers were paying into the system, 
and only 222,000 people were receiving benefits—a ratio of more 
than 150 workers to each beneficiary. In those early years, most re-
tirees received far more in benefits than they had paid in taxes. For 
example, the first beneficiary was a legal secretary named Ida May 
Fuller. She worked for three years while the program was in place 
and paid total taxes of only $24.75. During her retirement, she col-
lected $22,888.92 in benefits.
The Social Security and Medicare programs have been very successful in reducing 
poverty among elderly Americans, but in recent years, the ability of the federal govern-
ment to finance current promises has been called into doubt. After World War II, the 
United States experienced a “baby boom,” as birthrates rose and remained high through 
the early 1960s. Falling birthrates after 1965 have meant long-run problems for the 
Social Security system, as the number of workers per retiree has continually declined. 
Currently, there are only about three workers per retiree, and that ratio is expected to 
decline to two workers per retiree by 2035. Congress has attempted to deal with this 
problem by raising the age to receive full benefits from 65 to 67 and by increasing pay-
roll taxes. In 1940, the combined payroll tax paid by workers and firms was 2 percent; in 
2011, it was 15.3 percent (although a tax cut temporarily reduced it to 13.3 percent for 
that year).
Under the Medicare program, which was established in 1965, the federal govern-
ment provides health care coverage to people age 65 and over. The long-term financial 
situation for Medicare is an even greater cause for concern than is Social Security. As 
Americans live longer and as new—and expensive—medical procedures are developed, 
the projected expenditures under the Medicare program will eventually far outstrip pro-
jected tax revenues. The federal government also faces increasing expenditures under 
the Medicaid program, which is administered by state governments and provides health 
care coverage to low-income people. In 2010, federal spending on Social Security, Medi-
care, and Medicaid equaled 10.4 percent of GDP. Spending on these three programs was 
less than 3 percent of GDP in 1962. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) indicates 
that spending on these three programs will rise to 15.2 percent of GDP in 2030, 18.9 
percent by 2050, and 25.8 percent by 2085. The graph on the next page illustrates these 
forecasts. Over the past 40 years, the federal government has spent an average of about 
18.5 percent of GDP on all programs combined—from buying aircraft carriers to pay-
ing the salaries of FBI agents. So, if current trends continue, the federal government 
will eventually be spending, as a fraction of GDP, more on these three programs than it 
currently does on all programs combined. Over the coming decades, the gap between 
the benefits projected to be paid under the Social Security and Medicare programs and 
projected tax revenues is a staggering $72 trillion, or nearly five times the value of GDP 
in 2011. If current projections are accurate, policymakers are faced with the choice 
of significantly restraining spending on these programs, greatly increasing taxes on

C H A P T E R  2 7  Fiscal Policy
The Effects of Fiscal Policy on Real GDP 
and the Price Level
The federal government uses macroeconomic policies to offset the effects of the busi-
ness cycle on the economy. We saw in Chapter 26 that the Federal Reserve carries out 
monetary policy through changes in the money supply and interest rates. Congress 
and the president carry out fiscal policy through changes in government purchases 
and taxes. Because changes in government purchases and taxes lead to changes in 
aggregate demand, they can affect the level of real GDP, employment, and the price 
level. When the economy is in a recession, increases in government purchases or de-
creases in taxes will increase aggregate demand. As we saw in Chapter 24, the inflation

households and firms, or implementing some combination of spending restraints and 
tax increases. The alternatives will all clearly involve considerable pain. A report from 
the Congressional Budget Office concluded, “Even if taxation reached levels that were 
unprecedented in the United States, current spending policies could become financially 
unsustainable.”
A lively political debate has taken place over the future of the Social Security and 
Medicare programs. Some policymakers have proposed increasing taxes to fund future 
benefit payments. The tax increases needed, however, could be as much as 50 percent 
higher than current rates, and tax increases of that magnitude could discourage work 
effort, entrepreneurship, and investment, thereby slowing economic growth. There have 
also been proposals to slow the rate of growth of future benefits, while guaranteeing 
benefits to current recipients. While this strategy would avoid the need to raise taxes sig-
nificantly, it would also require younger workers to save more for their retirement. Some 
economists and policymakers have argued for slower benefit growth for higher-income 
workers while leaving future benefits unchanged for lower-income workers. Whatever 
changes are ultimately made in the Medicare and Social Security programs, this policy 
debate is one of the most important for young people.

rate may increase when real GDP is beyond potential GDP. Decreasing government 
purchases or raising taxes can slow the growth of aggregate demand and reduce the 
inflation rate.
Expansionary and Contractionary Fiscal Policy
Expansionary fiscal policy involves increasing government purchases or decreasing 
taxes. An increase in government purchases will increase aggregate demand directly 
 because government purchases are a component of aggregate demand. A cut in taxes 
has an  indirect effect on aggregate demand. Remember from Chapter 19 that the 
 income households have available to spend after they have paid their taxes is called 
disposable income. Cutting the individual income tax will increase household dispos-
able income and consumption spending. Cutting taxes on business income can increase 
 aggregate demand by increasing business investment.
Figure 27.5 shows the results of an expansionary fiscal policy, using the basic version 
of the aggregate demand and aggregate supply model. In this model, there is no economic 
growth, so the long-run aggregate supply (LRAS) curve does not shift. Notice that this figure 
is very similar to Figure 26.7 on page 875, which shows the effects of an expansionary mon-
etary policy. The goal of both expansionary monetary policy and expansionary fiscal policy 
is to increase aggregate demand relative to what it would have been without the policy.
In panel (a) of Figure 27.5, we assume that the economy is in short-run equilibrium 
at point A, where the aggregate demand (AD1) curve intersects the short-run aggregate 
supply (SRAS) curve. Real GDP is below potential real GDP, so the economy is in reces-
sion, with some firms operating below normal capacity and some workers having been 
laid off. To bring real GDP back to potential GDP, Congress and the president increase 
government purchases or cut taxes, which will shift the aggregate demand curve to the 
right, from AD1 to AD2. Real GDP increases from $14.2 trillion to potential GDP of 
$14.4 trillion, and the price level rises from 98 to 100 (point B). The policy has success-
fully returned real GDP to its potential level. Rising production will lead to increasing 
employment, reducing the unemployment rate.

In panel (a), the economy begins in recession at point A, with real GDP of 
$14.2 trillion and a price level of 98. An expansionary fiscal policy will cause 
aggregate demand to shift to the right, from AD1 to AD2, increasing real GDP 
from $14.2 trillion to $14.4 trillion and the price level from 98 to 100 (point B). 
In panel (b), the economy begins at point A, with real GDP at $14.6 trillion 
and the price level at 102. Because real GDP is greater than potential GDP, the 
economy will experience rising wages and prices. A contractionary fiscal policy 
will cause aggregate demand to shift to the left, from AD1 to AD2, decreasing 
real GDP from $14.6 trillion to $14.4 trillion and the price level from 102 to 100 
(point B).

C H A P T E R  2 7  Fiscal Policy
Contractionary fiscal policy involves decreasing government purchases or increasing 
taxes. Policymakers use contractionary fiscal policy to reduce increases in aggregate de-
mand that seem likely to lead to inflation. In panel (b) of Figure 27.5, the economy is in 
short-run equilibrium at point A, with real GDP of $14.6 trillion, which is above potential 
real GDP of $14.4 trillion. With some firms producing beyond their normal capacity and 
the unemployment rate very low, wages and prices will be increasing. To bring real GDP 
back to potential GDP, Congress and the president decrease government purchases or in-
crease taxes, which will shift the aggregate demand curve from AD1 to AD2. Real GDP 
falls from $14.6 trillion to $14.4 trillion, and the price level falls from 102 to 100 (point B).
We can conclude that Congress and the president can attempt to stabilize the econ-
omy by using fiscal policy to affect the price level and the level of real GDP. Of course, in 
practice it is extremely difficult for Congress and the president to use fiscal policy to elim-
inate the effects of the business cycle and keep real GDP always equal to potential GDP.

Aggregate Demand

Don’t Confuse Fiscal Policy  
and Monetary Policy
If you keep in mind the definitions of money, income, and 
spending, the difference between monetary policy and fis-
cal policy will be clearer. Students often make these two 
related mistakes: (1) They think of monetary policy as the 
Fed fighting recessions by increasing the money supply so 
people will have more money to spend; and (2) they think 
of fiscal policy as Congress and the president fighting re-
cessions by spending more money. In this view, the only 
difference between fiscal policy and monetary policy is the 
source of the money.
To understand what’s wrong with the descriptions of 
fiscal policy and monetary policy just given, first remem-
ber that the problem during a recession is not that there is 
too little money—currency plus checking account depos-
its—but too little spending. There may be too little spend-
ing for a number of reasons. For example, households may 
cut back on their spending on cars and houses because 
they are pessimistic about the future. Firms may cut back 
their spending because they have lowered their estimates 
of the future profitability of new machinery and factories. 
Or the major trading partners of the United States—such 
as Japan and Canada—may be suffering from recessions, 
which cause households and firms in those countries to cut 
back their spending on U.S. products.
The purpose of expansionary monetary policy is to 
lower interest rates, which in turn increases aggregate de-
mand. When interest rates fall, households and firms are will-
ing to borrow more to buy cars, houses, and factories. The 
purpose of expansionary fiscal policy is to increase aggregate 
demand either by having the government directly increase its 
own purchases or by cutting taxes to increase household dis-
posable income and, therefore, consumption spending.
Just as increasing or decreasing the money supply 
does not have a direct effect on government spending or 
taxes, increasing or decreasing government spending or 
taxes does not have a direct effect on the money supply. 
Fiscal policy and monetary policy have the same goals, but 
they have different effects on the economy.

and all other factors affecting the variables involved. In other words, we are again invok-
ing the ceteris paribus condition we discussed in Chapter 3. This point is important be-
cause, for example, a contractionary fiscal policy does not cause the price level to fall. 
A contractionary fiscal policy causes the price level to rise by less than it would have 
without the policy.
Fiscal Policy in the Dynamic Aggregate 
Demand and Aggregate Supply Model*
The overview of fiscal policy we just finished contains a key idea: Congress and the 
president can use fiscal policy to affect aggregate demand, thereby changing the price 
level and the level of real GDP. The discussion of expansionary and contractionary fiscal 
policy illustrated by Figure 27.5 on page 911 is simplified, however, because it ignores 
two important facts about the economy: (1) The economy experiences continuing infla-
tion, with the price level rising every year, and (2) the economy experiences long-run 
growth, with the LRAS curve shifting to the right every year. In Chapter 24, we devel-
oped a dynamic aggregate demand and aggregate supply model that took these two facts 
into account. In this section, we use the dynamic model to gain a more complete under-
standing of fiscal policy.
To briefly review the dynamic model, recall that over time, potential real GDP in-
creases, which we show by the long-run aggregate supply curve shifting to the right. 
The factors that cause the LRAS curve to shift also cause firms to supply more goods 
and services at any given price level in the short run, which we show by the short-run 
aggregate supply curve shifting to the right. Finally, during most years, the aggregate 
demand curve also shifts to the right, indicating that aggregate expenditure is higher at 
every price level.
Figure 27.6 shows the results of an expansionary fiscal policy using the dynamic 
aggregate demand and aggregate supply model. Notice that this figure is very similar to 
Figure 26.9 on page 881, which showed the effects of an expansionary monetary policy. 
The goal of both expansionary monetary policy and expansionary fiscal policy is to in-
crease aggregate demand relative to what it would have been without the policy.
In the hypothetical situation shown in Figure 27.6, the economy begins in equi-
librium at potential real GDP of $14.0 trillion and a price level of 100 (point A). In the 
second year, LRAS increases to $14.4 trillion, but AD increases only to AD21without policy2,

which is not enough to keep the economy in macroeconomic equilibrium at potential 
GDP. Let’s assume that the Fed does not react to the situation with an expansionary 
monetary policy. In that case, without an expansionary fiscal policy of spending in-
creases or tax reductions, the short-run equilibrium will occur at $14.3 trillion (point B). 
The $100 billion gap between this level of real GDP and the potential level means that 
some firms are operating at less than their full capacity. Incomes and profits will be fall-
ing, firms will begin to lay off workers, and the unemployment rate will rise.
Increasing government purchases or cutting taxes can shift aggregate demand to 
AD21with policy2. The economy will be in equilibrium at point C, with real GDP of $14.4 
trillion, which is its potential level, and a price level of 103. The price level is higher than 
it would have been without an expansionary fiscal policy.
Contractionary fiscal policy involves decreasing government purchases or increas-
ing taxes. Policymakers use contractionary fiscal policy to reduce increases in aggregate 
demand that seem likely to lead to inflation. In Figure 27.7, the economy again begins at 
potential real GDP of $14.0 trillion and a price level of 100 (point A). Once again, LRAS 
increases to $14.4 trillion in the second year. In this scenario, the shift in aggregate de-
mand to AD21without policy2 results in a short-run macroeconomic equilibrium beyond 
potential GDP (point B). If we assume that the Fed does not respond to the situation 
with a contractionary monetary policy, the economy will experience a rising inflation 
rate. Decreasing government purchases or increasing taxes can keep real GDP from 
moving beyond its potential level. The result, shown in Figure 27.7, is that in the new 
equilibrium at point C, the inflation rate is 3 percent rather than 5 percent.
The Government Purchases 
and Tax Multipliers
We saw in the chapter opener that in 2009, Congress and the president authorized 
spending to widen the Caldecott Tunnel in Northern California, in an attempt to in-
crease aggregate demand during the recession of 2007–2009. Suppose that Congress 
and the president decide to spend $100 billion on expanding the Caldecott Tunnel and 
similar projects. (The total increase in federal spending under the ARRA was actually 
about $500 billion, including the $180 million spent to widen the Caldecott Tunnel.)

The Government Purchases and Tax Multipliers

purchases? We might expect that the answer is greater than $100 billion because the 
initial increase in aggregate demand should lead to additional increases in income and 
spending. For example, to expand the Caldecott Tunnel, the California state govern-
ment hired Tutor-Saliba, a private construction firm. Tutor-Saliba and the subcontrac-
tors it used hired workers to carry out the project. The firms that carried out the many 
other projects authorized under the ARRA also hired new workers. Newly hired work-
ers are likely to increase their spending on cars, furniture, appliances, and other prod-
ucts. Sellers of these products will increase their production and hire more workers, 
and so on. At each step, real GDP and income will rise, thereby increasing consumption 
spending and aggregate demand. These additional waves of hiring are what the spokes-
person for the state agency in charge of the Caldecott Tunnel project referred to in the 
chapter opener as a “ripple effect” from the project.
Economists refer to the initial increase in government purchases as autonomous be-
cause it is a result of a decision by the government and is not directly caused by changes 
in the level of real GDP. The increases in consumption spending that result from the ini-
tial autonomous increase in government purchases are induced because they are caused 
by the initial increase in autonomous spending. Economists refer to the series of in-
duced increases in consumption spending that result from an initial increase in autono-
mous expenditures as the multiplier effect.
Figure 27.8 illustrates how an increase in government purchases affects the aggre-
gate demand curve. The initial increase in government purchases causes the aggregate 
demand curve to shift to the right because total spending in the economy is now higher 
at every price level. The shift to the right from AD1 to the dashed AD curve represents 
the effect of the initial increase of $100 billion in government purchases. Because this 
initial increase in government purchases raises incomes and leads to further increases in 
consumption spending, the aggregate demand curve will ultimately shift from AD1 all 
the way to AD2.
To better understand the multiplier effect, let’s start with a simplified analysis in which 
we assume that the price level is constant. In other words, initially we will ignore the effect 
of an upward-sloping SRAS. Figure 27.9 shows how spending and real GDP increase over 
a number of periods, beginning with the initial increase in government purchases in the 
first period. The initial spending in the first period raises real GDP and total income in the 
economy by $100 billion. How much additional consumption spending will result from 
$100 billion in additional income? We know that in addition to increasing their consump-
tion spending on domestically produced goods, households will save some of the increase 
in income, use some to pay income taxes, and use some to purchase imported goods, which 
will have no direct effect on spending and production in the U.S. economy. In  Figure 27.9, 
we assume that in the second period, households increase their consumption spending by

An initial increase in government purchases

the initial increase of $100 billion in govern-
ment purchases. Because this initial increase 
raises incomes and leads to further increases 
in consumption spending, the aggregate de-
mand curve will ultimately shift further to 
the right, to AD2.

one-half of the increase in income from the first period—or by $50 billion. This spending 
in the second period will, in turn, increase real GDP and income by an additional $50 bil-
lion. In the third period, consumption spending will increase by $25 billion, or one-half of 
the $50 billion increase in income from the second period.
The multiplier effect will continue through a number of periods, with the additional 
consumption spending in each period being half of the income increase from the previ-
ous period. Eventually, the process will be complete, although we cannot say precisely 
how many periods it will take, so we simply label the final period n rather than give it a 
specific number. In the graph in Figure 27.9, the new spending and increased real GDP 
in each period is shown in green, and the level of spending from the previous period 
is shown in orange. The sum of the orange and green areas represents the cumulative 
increase in spending and real GDP.
How large will the total increase in equilibrium real GDP be as a result of the initial 
increase of $100 billion in government purchases? The ratio of the change in equilib-
rium real GDP to the initial change in government purchases is known as the govern-
ment purchases multiplier:
Government purchases multiplier = Change in equilibrium real GDP
Change in government purchases.
If, for example, the government purchases multiplier has a value of 2, an increase 
in government purchases of $100 billion should increase equilibrium real GDP by 
2 * +100 billion = +200 billion. We show this in Figure 27.9 by having the cumula-
tive increase in real GDP equal $200 billion.

Following an initial increase in government purchases, spending and real GDP in-

and increased real GDP in each period is shown in green, and the level of spending 
from the previous period is shown in orange. The sum of the orange and green 
areas represents the cumulative increase in spending and real GDP. In total, equi-
librium real GDP will increase by $200 billion as a result of an initial increase of 
$100 billion in government purchases.

 
The Government Purchases and Tax Multipliers  
917
Tax cuts also have a multiplier effect. Cutting taxes increases the disposable income 
of households. When household disposable income rises, so will consumption spending. 
These increases in consumption spending will set off further increases in real GDP and 
income, just as increases in government purchases do. Suppose we consider a change in 
taxes of a specific amount—say, a tax cut of $100 billion—with the tax rate remaining 
unchanged. The expression for this tax multiplier is
Tax multiplier = Change in equilibrium real GDP
Change in taxes
.
The tax multiplier is a negative number because changes in taxes and changes in 
real GDP move in opposite directions: An increase in taxes reduces disposable income, 
consumption, and real GDP, and a decrease in taxes raises disposable income, consump-
tion, and real GDP. For example, if the tax multiplier is −1.6, a $100 billion cut in taxes 
will increase real GDP by -1.6 * -$100 billion = $160 billion. We would expect the 
tax multiplier to be smaller in absolute value than the government purchases multiplier. 
To see why, think about the difference between a $100 billion increase in government 
purchases and a $100 billion decrease in taxes. The whole of the $100 billion in govern-
ment purchases results in an increase in aggregate demand. But households will save 
rather than spend some portion of a $100 billion decrease in taxes, and they will spend 
some portion on imported goods. The fraction of the tax cut that households save or 
spend on imports will not increase aggregate demand. Therefore, the first period of the 
multiplier process will see a smaller increase in aggregate demand than occurs when 
there is an increase in government purchases, and the total increase in equilibrium real 
GDP will be smaller.
The Effect of Changes in Tax Rates
A change in tax rates has a more complicated effect on equilibrium real GDP than does 
a tax cut of a fixed amount. To begin with, the value of the tax rate affects the size of the 
multiplier effect. The higher the tax rate, the smaller the multiplier effect. To see why, 
think about the size of the additional spending increases that take place in each period 
following an increase in government purchases. The higher the tax rate, the smaller the 
amount of any increase in income that households have available to spend, which re-
duces the size of the multiplier effect. So, a cut in tax rates affects equilibrium real GDP 
through two channels: (1) A cut in tax rates increases the disposable income of house-
holds, which leads them to increase their consumption spending, and (2) a cut in tax 
rates increases the size of the multiplier effect.
Taking into Account the Effects of Aggregate Supply
To this point, as we discussed the multiplier effect, we assumed that the price level was 
constant. We know, though, that because the SRAS curve is upward sloping, when the 
AD curve shifts to the right, the price level will rise. As a result of the rise in the price 
level, equilibrium real GDP will not increase by the full amount that the multiplier  effect 
indicates. Figure 27.10 illustrates how an upward-sloping SRAS curve affects the size of 
the multiplier. To keep the graph relatively simple, we assume that the SRAS and LRAS 
curves do not shift. The economy starts at point A, with real GDP below its potential 
level. An increase in government purchases shifts the aggregate demand curve from 
AD1 to the dashed AD curve. Just as in Figure 27.8, the multiplier effect causes a further 
shift in aggregate demand to AD2. If the price level remained constant, real GDP would 
increase from $13.0 trillion at point A to $14.2 trillion at point B. However, because the 
SRAS curve is upward sloping, the price level rises from 100 to 103, reducing the total 
quantity of goods and services demanded in the economy. The new equilibrium occurs 
at point C, with real GDP having risen to $14.0 trillion, or by $200 billion less than if 
the price level had remained unchanged. We can conclude that the actual change in real 
GDP resulting from an increase in government purchases or a cut in taxes will be less 
than indicated by the simple multiplier effect with a constant price level.

918 
C H A P T E R  2 7  Fiscal Policy
The Multipliers Work in Both Directions
Increases in government purchases and cuts in taxes have a positive multiplier effect on 
equilibrium real GDP. Decreases in government purchases and increases in taxes also 
have a multiplier effect on equilibrium real GDP, but in this case, the effect is negative. 
For example, an increase in taxes will reduce household disposable income and con-
sumption spending. As households buy fewer cars, furniture, refrigerators, and other 
products, the firms that sell these products will cut back on production and begin laying 
off workers. Falling incomes will lead to further reductions in consumption spending. 
A reduction in government spending on defense would set off a similar process of de-
creases in real GDP and income. The cutback would be felt first by defense contractors 
selling directly to the government, and then it would spread to other firms.
We look more closely at the government purchases multiplier and the tax multiplier 
in the appendix to this chapter.
Figure 27.10
The Multiplier Effect and 
Aggregate Supply
The economy is initially at point A. An in-
crease in government purchases causes the 
aggregate demand curve to shift to the right, 
from AD1 to the dashed AD curve. The mul-
tiplier effect results in the aggregate demand 
curve shifting further to the right, to AD2 
(point B). Because of the upward-sloping 
supply curve, the shift in aggregate demand 
results in a higher price level. In the new 
equilibrium at point C, both real GDP and 
the price level have increased. The increase in 
real GDP is less than indicated by the multi-
plier effect with a constant price level.

The Limits of Using Fiscal Policy to Stabilize the Economy

The Limits of Using Fiscal Policy 
to Stabilize the Economy
Poorly timed fiscal policy, like poorly timed monetary policy, can do more harm than 
good. As we discussed in Chapter 26, it takes time for policymakers to collect statistics 
and identify changes in the economy. If the government decides to increase spending or 
cut taxes to fight a recession that is about to end, the effect may be to increase the infla-
tion rate. Similarly, cutting spending or raising taxes to slow down an economy that has 
actually already moved into recession can increase the length and depth of the recession.
Getting the timing right can be more difficult with fiscal policy than with monetary 
policy for two main reasons. Control over monetary policy is concentrated in the hands 
of the Federal Open Market Committee, which can change monetary policy at any of 
its meetings. By contrast, the president and a majority of the 535 members of Congress 
have to agree on changes in fiscal policy. The delays caused by the legislative process can 
be very long. For example, in 1962, President John F. Kennedy concluded that the U.S. 
economy was operating below potential GDP and proposed a tax cut to stimulate aggre-
gate demand. Congress eventually agreed to the tax cut—but not until 1964. The events 
of 2001 and 2009 show, though, that it is sometimes possible to authorize changes in 
fiscal policy relatively quickly. When George W. Bush came into office in January 2001, 
the economy was on the verge of recession, and he immediately proposed a tax cut. 
Congress passed the tax cut, and the president signed it into law in early June 2001. 
Similarly, Barack Obama proposed a stimulus package as soon as he came into office in 
January 2009, and Congress had passed the proposal by February.
Even after a change in fiscal policy has been approved, it takes time to implement 
the policy. Suppose Congress and the president agree to increase aggregate demand 
by spending $30 billion more on constructing subway systems in several cities. It will

Step 2: Explain how the necessary increase in purchases or cut in taxes is less than 
$200 billion because of the multiplier effect. The statement is incorrect be-
cause it does not consider the multiplier effect. Because of the multiplier ef-
fect, an increase in government purchases or a decrease in taxes of less than 
$200 billion is necessary to increase equilibrium real GDP by $200 billion. 
For instance, assume that the government purchases multiplier is 2 and the 
tax multiplier is −1.6. We can then calculate the necessary increase in govern-

probably take at least several months to prepare detailed plans for the construction. Lo-
cal governments will then ask for bids from private construction companies. Once the 
winning bidders have been selected, they will usually need several months to begin the 
project. Only then will significant amounts of spending actually take place. This delay 
may push the spending beyond the end of the recession that the spending was intended 
to fight. Delays of this type are less of a concern during long and severe recessions, such 
as that of 2007–2009.
Does Government Spending Reduce Private 
Spending?
In addition to the timing problem, using increases in government purchases to in-
crease aggregate demand presents another potential problem. We have been assum-
ing that when the federal government increases its purchases by $30 billion, the 
multiplier effect will cause the increase in aggregate demand to be greater than $30 
billion. However, the size of the multiplier effect may be limited if the increase in 
government purchases causes one of the nongovernment, or private, components of 
aggregate expenditures—consumption, investment, or net exports—to fall. A decline 
in private expenditures as a result of an increase in government purchases is called 
crowding out.
Crowding Out in the Short Run
Consider the case of a temporary increase in government purchases. Suppose the fed-
eral government decides to fight a recession by spending $30 billion more this year on 
subway construction. When the $30 billion has been spent, the program will end, and 
government spending will drop back to its previous level. As the spending takes place, 
income and real GDP will increase. These increases in income and real GDP will cause 
households and firms to increase their demand for currency and checking account bal-
ances to accommodate the increased buying and selling. Figure 27.11 shows the result, 
using the money market graph introduced in Chapter 26.
At higher levels of real GDP and income, households and firms demand more 
money at every interest rate. When the demand for money increases, the equilibrium 
interest rate will rise. Higher interest rates will result in a decline in each component 
of private expenditures. Consumption spending and investment spending will decline 
because households will borrow less to buy houses, cars, furniture, and appliances, and 
firms will borrow less to buy factories, computers, and machine tools. Net exports will

If the federal government increases spend-
ing, the demand for money will increase from 
Money demand1 to Money demand2 as 
real GDP and income rise. With the supply of 
money constant, at $950 billion, the result is an 
increase in the equilibrium interest rate from  
3 percent to 5 percent, which crowds out some 
consumption, investment, and net exports.

also decline because higher interest rates in the United States will attract foreign inves-
tors. German, Japanese, and Canadian investors will want to exchange the currencies of 
their countries for U.S. dollars to invest in U.S. Treasury bills and other U.S. financial 
assets. This increased demand for U.S. dollars will cause an increase in the exchange rate 
between the dollar and other currencies. When the dollar increases in value, the prices 
of U.S. products in foreign countries rise—causing a reduction in U.S. exports—and the 
prices of foreign products in the United States fall—causing an increase in U.S. imports. 
Falling exports and rising imports mean that net exports are falling.
The greater the sensitivity of consumption, investment, and net exports to changes 
in interest rates, the more crowding out will occur. In a deep recession, many firms may 
be so pessimistic about the future and have so much excess capacity that investment 
spending will fall to very low levels and will be unlikely to fall much further, even if in-
terest rates rise. In this case, crowding out is unlikely to be a problem. If the economy is 
close to potential GDP, however, and firms are optimistic about the future, an increase 
in interest rates may result in a significant decline in investment spending.
Figure 27.12 shows that crowding out may reduce the effectiveness of an expansion-
ary fiscal policy. The economy begins in short-run equilibrium at point A, with real 
GDP at $14.2 trillion. Real GDP is below potential GDP, so the economy is in recession. 
Suppose that Congress and the president decide to increase government purchases to 
bring the economy back to potential GDP. In the absence of crowding out, the increase 
in government purchases will shift aggregate demand to AD21no crowding out2 and bring 
the economy to equilibrium at real GDP of $14.4 trillion, which is the potential level 
of GDP (point B). But the higher interest rate resulting from the increased government 
purchases will reduce consumption, investment, and net exports, causing aggregate 
demand to shift back to AD21crowding out2. The result is a new short-run equilibrium at 
point C, with real GDP of $14.3 trillion, which is $100 billion short of potential GDP.
Crowding Out in the Long Run
Most economists agree that in the short run, an increase in government spending results 
in partial, but not complete, crowding out. What is the long-run effect of a permanent 
increase in government spending? In this case, most economists agree that the result is 
complete crowding out. In the long run, the decline in investment, consumption, and 
net exports exactly offsets the increase in government purchases, and aggregate demand 
remains unchanged. To understand crowding out in the long run, recall from Chapter 24 
that in the long run, the economy returns to potential GDP. Suppose that the economy is 
currently at potential GDP and that government purchases are 35 percent of GDP. In 
Figure 27.12

trillion (point B). But the higher interest rate 
resulting from the increased government pur-
chases will reduce consumption, investment, 
and net exports, causing aggregate demand to 
shift to AD21crowding out2. The result is a new 
short-run equilibrium at point C, with real 
GDP of $14.3 trillion, which is $100 billion 
short of potential real GDP.

that case, private expenditures—the sum of consumption, investment, and net exports—
will make up the other 65 percent of GDP. If government purchases are increased per-
manently to 37 percent of GDP, in the long run, private expenditures must fall to 63 
percent of GDP. There has been complete crowding out: Private expenditures have fallen 
by the same amount that government purchases have increased. If government spending 
is taking a larger share of GDP, then private spending must take a smaller share.
An expansionary fiscal policy does not have to cause complete crowding out in the 
short run. If the economy is below potential real GDP, it is possible for both government 
purchases and private expenditures to increase. But in the long run, any permanent increase 
in government purchases must come at the expense of private expenditures. Keep in mind, 
however, that it may take several—possibly many—years to arrive at this long-run outcome.
Fiscal Policy in Action: Did the Stimulus Package  
of 2009 Work?
As we have seen, Congress and the president can increase government purchases and 
cut taxes to increase aggregate demand either to avoid a recession or to shorten the 
length or severity of a recession that is already under way. The recession of 2007–2009 
occurred during the end of the presidency of George W. Bush and the beginning of the 
presidency of Barack Obama. Both presidents used fiscal policy to fight the recession.
In early 2008, economists advising President Bush believed that the housing crisis, 
the resulting credit crunch, and rising oil prices were pushing the economy into a re-
cession. (As we now know, a recession had actually already begun in December 2007.) 
These economists proposed cutting taxes to increase household disposable income, 
which would increase consumption spending and aggregate demand. Congress enacted 
a tax cut that took the form of rebates of taxes already paid. Rebate checks totaling $95 
billion were sent to taxpayers between April and July 2008.
How effective were the rebates in increasing consumption spending? While econo-
mists are still studying the issue, economic analysis can give us some insight. Many econo-
mists believe that consumers base their spending on their permanent income rather than 
just on their current income. A consumer’s permanent income reflects the consumer’s ex-
pected future income. By basing spending on permanent income, a consumer can smooth 
out consumption over a period of years. For example, a medical student may have very 
low current income but a high expected future income. The student may borrow against 
this high expected future income rather than having to consume at a very low level in 
the present. Some people, however, have difficulty borrowing against their future income 
because banks or other lenders may not be convinced that a borrower’s future income re-
ally will be significantly higher than his or her current income. One-time tax rebates, such 
as the one in 2008, increase consumers’ current income but not their permanent income. 
Only a permanent decrease in taxes increases consumers’ permanent income. Therefore, a 
tax rebate is likely to increase consumption spending less than would a permanent tax cut.
Some estimates of the effect of the 2008 tax rebate, including studies by Christian 
Broda of the University of Chicago and Jonathan Parker of Northwestern University, 
and by economists at the Congressional Budget Office, indicate that taxpayers spent be-
tween 33 and 40 percent of the rebates they received. Taxpayers who have difficulty bor-
rowing against their future income increased their consumption the most. The 2008 tax 
rebates totaled $95 billion, so consumers may have increased their spending by about 
$35 billion as a result of the rebate.
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 Although the tax rebates 
helped to increase aggregate demand, we saw in Chapter 26 that the recession worsened 
in September 2008, following the bankruptcy of the Lehman Brothers investment bank 
and the deepening of the financial crisis. President Obama took office in January 2009, 
pledging to pursue an expansionary fiscal policy. Congress responded in February by 
passing the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, a $825 billion package 
of spending increases and tax cuts that was by far the largest fiscal policy action in U.S. 
history. The complexity of the “stimulus package,” as it came to be known, makes its 
provisions difficult to summarize, but Figure 27.13 provides some highlights.

 
The Limits of Using Fiscal Policy to Stabilize the Economy  
923
About two-thirds of the stimulus package took the form of increases in govern-
ment expenditures, and one-third took the form of tax cuts. Panel (a) shows the major 
categories of spending increases. The largest category—health care, social services, and 
 education—included funds for biomedical research and grants to state governments to 
help fund Medicare spending, as well as funds for many other programs. The energy 
 category included funding for research into alternative energy sources as well as modern-
ization of the electric grid. Transportation and housing included substantial spending on 
infrastructure projects, such as repairing and expanding highways, bridges, and airports. 
Individual aid included spending on extended unemployment insurance  payments. 
Panel (b) shows the major categories of tax cuts. The largest category was individual tax 
cuts, which included a $400 reduction in payroll taxes for workers earning up to $75,000 
per year and a tax credit of up to $2,500 for tuition and other college expenses.
How Can We Measure the Effectiveness of the Stimulus Package? How ef-
fective was the Obama administration’s stimulus package? At the time the package was 
passed, economists working for the administration estimated that the increase in ag-
gregate demand resulting from the package would increase real GDP by 3.5 percent by 
the end of 2010 and increase employment by 3.5 million. In fact, between the beginning 
of 2009 and the end of 2010, real GDP increased by 4.4 percent, while employment de-
clined by 3.3 million. Do these results indicate that the stimulus package was successful 
in increasing GDP, but not employment? We have to be careful in drawing that conclu-
sion. To judge the effectiveness of the stimulus package, we have to measure its effects 
on real GDP and employment, holding constant all other factors affecting real GDP and 
employment. In other words, the actual movements in real GDP and employment are a 
mixture of the effects of the stimulus package and the effects of other factors, such as the 
Federal Reserve’s monetary policy, other fiscal policy actions, and the typical changes in 
real GDP and employment during a business cycle that occur independently of govern-
ment policy. Isolating the effects of the stimulus package from the effects of these other 
factors is very difficult and explains why economists differ in their views about how ef-
fective the stimulus package was.
Economists at the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) have provided estimates of 
the effectiveness of the stimulus package. The CBO is a nonpartisan organization, and 
many economists believe its estimates are reasonable. But because the estimates depend

C H A P T E R  2 7  Fiscal Policy
on particular assumptions about the size of the government purchases and tax multipli-
ers, some economists believe that the CBO estimates are too high, while other econo-
mists believe the estimates are too low. Table 27.2 presents the CBO’s estimates of the 
effects of the stimulus package. To reflect the uncertainty in its calculation, the CBO 
provides a range of estimates. For example, in the absence of the stimulus package, the 
CBO estimates that employment in 2010 would have been between 1.3 million and 3.3 
million less than it actually was and the unemployment rate would have been between 
0.7 percent and 1.8 percent higher than it actually was.
If the CBO’s estimates of the effects of the stimulus package are accurate, 
then this fiscal policy action significantly reduced the severity of the recession of  
2007–2009 and its aftermath. However, relative to the severity of the recession, the  effect 
of the package was comparatively small. For example, in 2010, the unemployment rate 
was 9.6 percent, which was far above the unemployment rate of 4.6 percent in 2007. 
According to the CBO, without the stimulus package, the unemployment rate would 
have been somewhere between 10.3 percent and 11.4 percent. So, the stimulus package 
reduced the increase in the unemployment rate that might otherwise have  occurred, but 
did not come close to bringing the economy back to full employment.

Why Was the Recession of 2007–2009 
So Severe?
The CBO estimates of the effects of the stimulus package indi-
cate that even $825 billion in increased government spending 
and tax cuts left the economy with real GDP far from potential 
GDP and the unemployment rate above 9 percent. Why was 
the recession of 2007–2009 so severe? As we saw in Chapters 25 
and 26, the recession was accompanied by a financial crisis. The 
U.S. economy had not experienced a significant financial crisis 
since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Both the Great Depres-
sion and the recession of 2007–2009 were severe. Was their sever-
ity the result of the accompanying financial crises? More generally, 
do recessions accompanied by financial crises tend to be more 
 severe than recessions that do not involve bank crises?
Carmen Reinhart of the University of Maryland and Kenneth 
Rogoff of Harvard have gathered data on recessions and financial 
crises in a number of countries, in an attempt to answer this ques-
tion. The table on the next page shows the average change in key economic variables 
during the period following a financial crisis for a number of countries, including the 
United States during the Great Depression and European and Asian countries in the 
post–World War II era. The table shows that for these countries, on average, the re-
cessions following financial crises were quite severe. Unemployment rates increased 
by 7 percentage points—for example, from 5 percent to 12 percent—and continued in-
creasing for nearly five years after a crisis had begun. Real GDP per capita also declined 
sharply, and the average length of a recession following a financial crisis has been nearly 
two years. Adjusted for inflation, stock prices dropped by more than half, and housing

The Size of the Multiplier: A Key to Estimating the Effects of Fiscal Policy 
In preparing the values shown in Table 27.2, the CBO relied on estimates of the govern-
ment purchases and tax multipliers. Economists have been debating the size of these 
multipliers for many years. When British economist John Maynard Keynes and his fol-
lowers first developed the idea of spending and tax multipliers in the 1930s, they argued 
that the government purchases multiplier might be as large as 10. In that case, a $1 bil-
lion increase in government purchases would increase real GDP by $10 billion. Later 
research by economists indicated that the government purchases multiplier was much 
smaller, perhaps less than 2.
Estimating an exact number for the multiplier is difficult because over time, several 
factors can cause the aggregate demand and short-run aggregate supply curves to shift, 
leading to a change in equilibrium real GDP. It can be challenging to isolate the effect of 
an increase in government purchases on equilibrium GDP. In preparing their estimates 
of the effect of the stimulus package on GDP, Obama administration economists used 
prices dropped by more than one-third. Government debt soared by 86 percent. The 
increased government debt was partly the result of increased government spending, in-
cluding spending to bail out failed financial institutions. But most of the increased debt 
was the result of government budget deficits resulting from sharp declines in tax rev-
enues as incomes and profits fell as a result of the recession. (We discuss government 
budget deficits and government debt in the next section.)

The table above does not include data for the United States during the 2007–2009 
recession because that recession was still under way when Reinhart and Rogoff were 
compiling their data. The table below shows some key indicators for the 2007–2009 U.S. 
recession compared with other U.S. recessions of the post–World War II period:

Consistent with Reinhart and Rogoff’s findings that recessions following financial 
panics tend to be unusually severe, the 2007–2009 recession was the worst in the United 
States since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The recession lasted nearly twice as long 
as the average of earlier postwar recessions, GDP declined by more than twice the aver-
age, and the peak unemployment rate was about one-third higher than the average.
Because most people did not see the financial crisis coming, they also failed to an-
ticipate the severity of the 2007–2009 recession.
Note: In the second table, the duration of recessions is based on National Bureau of Economic Research business cycle dates, the 
decline in real GDP is measured as the simple percentage change from the quarter of the cyclical peak to the quarter of the cyclical 
trough, and the peak unemployment rate is the highest unemployment rate in any month following the cyclical peak.

an average of multiplier estimates from the Federal Reserve and from a private macro-
economic forecasting firm. Their estimate of a government purchases multiplier of 1.57 
indicates that a $1 billion increase in government purchases would increase equilibrium 
real GDP by $1.57 billion.
Because of the difficulty of estimating the size of the multiplier, some economists 
argue that the value used by the Obama administration’s economists was too high, while 
others argued that it was too low. Robert Barro of Harvard University argues that in-
creases in government spending during wartime are so large relative to other changes 
in aggregate demand that data from periods of war are best suited to estimating the 
size of the multiplier. Using such data, Barro estimated that the government purchases 
multiplier is only 0.8. Lawrence Christiano, Martin Eichenbaum, and Sergio Rebelo of 
Northwestern University argued, on the other hand, that the multiplier is likely to be 
larger when, as during 2009, short-term interest rates are near zero. They estimated that 
for these periods, the government purchases multiplier could be as large as 3.7.
As Table 27.3 shows, estimates of the size of the multiplier vary widely. The uncer-
tainty about the size of the multiplier indicates the difficulty that economists have in 
arriving at a firm estimate of the effects of fiscal policy.

Deficits, Surpluses, and Federal Government Debt 
927
Deficits, Surpluses, and Federal 
Government Debt
The federal government’s budget shows the relationship between its expenditures and its 
tax revenue. If the federal government’s expenditures are greater than its tax revenue, a 
budget deficit results. If the federal government’s expenditures are less than its tax revenue, 
a budget surplus results. As with many other macroeconomic variables, it is useful to con-
sider the size of the surplus or deficit relative to the size of the overall economy. Figure 27.14 
shows that, as a percentage of GDP, the largest deficits of the twentieth century came dur-
ing World Wars I and II. During major wars, higher taxes only partially offset massive in-
creases in government expenditures, leaving large budget deficits. Figure 27.14 also shows 
that during recessions government spending increases and tax revenues fall, increasing the 
budget deficit. In 1970, the federal government entered a long period of continuous budget 
deficits. From 1970 through 1997, the federal government’s budget was in deficit every year. 
From 1998 through 2001, there were four years of budget surpluses. The recessions of 2001 
and 2007–2009, tax cuts, and increased government spending on homeland security and 
the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan helped keep the budget in deficit in the years after 2001.
Figure 27.14 also shows the effects on the federal budget deficit of the Obama ad-
ministration’s $825 billion stimulus package and the severity of the 2007–2009 reces-
sion. From 2009 through 2011, the federal budget deficit was greater than 8 percent of 
GDP, which was the first time the deficit had been this large except during major wars 
in the history of the country.
How the Federal Budget Can Serve  
as an Automatic Stabilizer
Discretionary fiscal policy can increase the federal budget deficit during recessions by 
increasing spending or cutting taxes to increase aggregate demand. For example, as we 
have just seen, the Obama administration’s spending increases and tax cuts caused the 
federal budget deficit to soar during 2009. In many milder recessions, though, no sig-
nificant fiscal policy actions are taken. In fact, most of the increase in the federal budget 
deficit during a typical recession takes place without Congress and the president taking

During wars, government spending increases far more than tax revenues, 
increasing the budget deficit. The budget deficit also increases during recessions, 
as government spending increases and tax revenues fall.

any action, but is instead due to the effects of the automatic stabilizers we mentioned 
earlier in this chapter.
Deficits occur automatically during recessions for two reasons: First, during a re-
cession, wages and profits fall, causing government tax revenues to fall. Second, the gov-
ernment automatically increases its spending on transfer payments when the economy 
moves into recession. The government’s contribution to the unemployment insurance 
program will increase as unemployment rises. Spending will also increase on programs 
to aid low-income people, such as the food stamps, Temporary Assistance for Needy 
Families, and Medicaid programs. These spending increases take place without Con-
gress and the president taking any action. Existing laws already specify who is eligible 
for unemployment insurance and these other programs. As the number of eligible per-
sons increases during a recession, so does government spending on these programs.
Because budget deficits automatically increase during recessions and decrease dur-
ing expansions, economists often look at the cyclically adjusted budget deficit or surplus, 
which can provide a more accurate measure of the effects on the economy of the gov-
ernment’s spending and tax policies than can the actual budget deficit or surplus. The 
 cyclically adjusted budget deficit or surplus measures what the deficit or surplus would 
be if the economy were at potential GDP. In late 2011, the CBO projected that the deficit 
for 2012 would be about 6.2 percent of GDP. The CBO estimated that if real GDP were 
at its potential level, the deficit would be about 4.0 percent of GDP. The difference rep-
resented the effects of expansionary fiscal policy. If the federal government were to run 
a contractionary fiscal policy, the result would be a cyclically adjusted budget surplus.
Automatic budget surpluses and deficits can help to stabilize the economy. When the 
economy moves into a recession, wages and profits fall, which reduces the taxes that house-
holds and firms owe the government. In effect, households and firms have received an au-
tomatic tax cut, which keeps their spending higher than it otherwise would have been. In a 
recession, workers who have been laid off receive unemployment insurance payments, and 
households whose incomes have dropped below a certain level become eligible for food 
stamps and other government transfer programs. By receiving this extra income, house-
holds are able to spend more than they otherwise would have spent. This extra spending 
helps reduce the length and severity of the recession. Many economists argue that the lack 
of an unemployment insurance system and other government transfer programs contrib-
uted to the severity of the Great Depression. During the Great Depression, workers who 
lost their jobs saw their wage incomes drop to zero and had to rely on their savings, what 
they could borrow, or what they received from private charities. As a result, many unem-
ployed workers cut back drastically on their spending, which made the downturn worse.
When GDP increases above its potential level, households and firms have to pay 
more taxes to the federal government, and the federal government makes fewer transfer 
payments. Higher taxes and lower transfer payments cause total spending to rise by less 
than it otherwise would have, which helps reduce the chance that the economy will ex-
perience higher inflation.

Did Fiscal Policy Fail during  
the Great Depression?
Modern macroeconomic analysis began during the 1930s, 
with the publication of The General Theory of Employment, 
Interest, and Money by John Maynard Keynes. One conclusion many economists drew 
from Keynes’s book was that an expansionary fiscal policy would be necessary to pull 
the United States out of the Great Depression. When Franklin D. Roosevelt became 
president in 1933, federal government expenditures increased as part of his New Deal 
program, and there was a federal budget deficit during each remaining year of the de-
cade, except for 1937. The U.S. economy recovered very slowly, however, and did not 
reach potential GDP again until the outbreak of World War II in 1941.
Some economists and policymakers at the time argued that because the economy re-
covered slowly despite increases in government spending, fiscal policy had been ineffec-
tive. During the debate over President Obama’s stimulus package, the argument that fiscal

policy had failed during the New Deal was raised again. Economic historians have argued, 
however, that despite the increases in government spending, Congress and the president 
had not, in fact, implemented an expansionary fiscal policy during the 1930s. In sepa-
rate studies, economists E. Cary Brown of MIT and Larry Peppers of Washington and Lee 
University argued that there was a cyclically adjusted budget deficit during only one year 
of the 1930s, and that one deficit was small. The following table provides data support-
ing their arguments. (All variables in the table are nominal rather than real.) The second 
column shows federal government expenditures increasing from 1933 to 1936, falling in 
1937, and then increasing in 1938 and 1939. The third column shows a similar pattern, 
with the federal budget being in deficit each year after 1933 except for 1937. The fourth 
column, however, shows that in each year after 1933, the federal government ran a cycli-
cally adjusted budget surplus. Because the level of income was so low and the unemploy-
ment rate was so high during these years, tax collections were far below what they would 
have been if the economy had been at potential GDP. As the fifth column shows, in 1933 
and again in 1937 to 1939, the cyclically adjusted surpluses were large relative to GDP.

Although President Roosevelt proposed many new government spending pro-
grams, he had also promised during the 1932 presidential election campaign to balance 
the federal budget. He achieved a balanced budget only in 1937, but his reluctance to al-
low the actual budget deficit to grow too large helps explain why the cyclically adjusted 
budget remained in surplus. Many economists today would agree with E. Cary Brown’s 
conclusion: “Fiscal policy, then, seems to have been an unsuccessful recovery device in 
the ’thirties—not because it did not work, but because it was not tried.”

The federal government’s budget deficit was $207.8 billion 
in 1983 and $185.4 billion in 1984. A student comments,

C H A P T E R  2 7  Fiscal Policy
Should the Federal Budget Always Be Balanced?
Although many economists believe that it is a good idea for the federal government to 
have a balanced budget when the economy is at potential GDP, few economists believe 
that the federal government should attempt to balance its budget every year. To see why 
economists take this view, consider what the government would have to do to keep the 
budget balanced during a recession, when the federal budget automatically moves into 
deficit. To bring the budget back into balance, the government would have to raise taxes 
or cut spending, but these actions would reduce aggregate demand, thereby making the 
recession worse. Similarly, when GDP increases above its potential level, the budget au-
tomatically moves into surplus. To eliminate this surplus, the government would have to 
cut taxes or increase government spending. But these actions would increase aggregate 
demand, thereby pushing GDP further beyond potential GDP and increasing the risk of 
higher inflation. To balance the budget every year, the government might have to take 
actions that would destabilize the economy.
Some economists argue that the federal government should normally run a deficit, 
even at potential GDP. When the federal budget is in deficit, the U.S. Treasury sells 
bonds to investors to raise the funds necessary to pay the government’s bills. Borrow-
ing to pay the bills is a bad policy for a household, a firm, or the government when 
the bills are for current expenses, but it is not a bad policy if the bills are for long-lived 
capital goods. For instance, most families pay for a new home by taking out a 15- to 
30-year mortgage. Because houses last many years, it makes sense to pay for a house 
out of the income the family makes over a long period of time rather than out of the 
income received in the year the house is bought. Businesses often borrow the funds to 
buy machinery, equipment, and factories by selling 30-year corporate bonds. Because 
these capital goods generate profits for the businesses over many years, it makes sense 
to pay for them over a period of years as well. By similar reasoning, when the federal 
government contributes to the building of a new highway, bridge, or subway, it may 
want to borrow funds by selling Treasury bonds. The alternative is to pay for these 
long-lived capital goods out of the tax revenues received in the year the goods were 
purchased. But that means that the taxpayers in that year have to bear the whole bur-
den of paying for the projects, even though taxpayers for many years in the future will 
be enjoying the benefits.
Solving the Problem
Step 1: Review the chapter material. This problem is about the federal budget as an 
automatic stabilizer, so you may want to review the section “How the Federal 
Budget Can Serve as an Automatic Stabilizer,” which begins on page 927.
Step 2: Explain how changes in the budget deficit can occur without Congress and 
the president acting. If Congress and the president take action to raise taxes 
or cut spending, the federal budget deficit will decline. But the deficit will also 
decline automatically when GDP increases, even if the government takes no 
action. When GDP increases, rising household incomes and firm profits re-
sult in higher tax revenues. Increasing GDP also usually means falling unem-
ployment, which reduces government spending on unemployment insurance 
and other transfer payments. So, you should disagree with the comment. A 
falling deficit does not mean that the government must have acted to raise 
taxes or cut spending.
Extra Credit: Although you don’t have to know it to answer the question, GDP did in-
crease from $3.5 trillion in 1983 to $3.9 trillion in 1984.

Deficits, Surpluses, and Federal Government Debt 
931
The Federal Government Debt
Every time the federal government runs a budget deficit, the Treasury must borrow 
funds from investors by selling Treasury securities. For simplicity, we will refer to all 
Treasury securities as “bonds.” When the federal government runs a budget surplus, the 
Treasury pays off some existing bonds. Figure 27.14 on page 927 shows that there are 
many more years of federal budget deficits than years of federal budget surpluses. As a 
result, the total number of Treasury bonds outstanding has grown over the years. The to-
tal value of U.S. Treasury bonds outstanding is referred to as the federal government debt 
or, sometimes, as the national debt. Each year the federal budget is in deficit, the federal 
government debt grows. Each year the federal budget is in surplus, the debt shrinks.
Figure 27.15 shows federal government debt as a percentage of GDP in the years 
since 1901. The ratio of debt to GDP increased during World Wars I and II and the 
Great Depression, reflecting the large government budget deficits of those years. After 
the end of World War II, GDP grew faster than the debt until the early 1980s, which 
caused the ratio of debt to GDP to fall. The large budget deficits of the 1980s and early 
1990s sent the debt-to-GDP ratio climbing. The budget surpluses of 1998 to 2001 
caused the debt-to-GDP ratio to fall, but it rose again with the return of deficits begin-
ning in 2002. The large deficits beginning in 2008 caused the ratio to spike up to its 
highest level since 1947.
Is Government Debt a Problem?
Debt can be a problem for a government for the same reasons that debt can be a problem 
for a household or a business. If a family has difficulty making the monthly mortgage 
payment, it will have to cut back spending on other goods and services. If the family is 
unable to make the payments, it will have to default on the loan and will probably lose 
its house. The federal government is not in danger of defaulting on its debt. Ultimately, 
the government can raise the funds it needs through taxes to make the interest pay-
ments on the debt. If the debt becomes very large relative to the economy, however, the 
government may have to raise taxes to high levels or cut back on other types of spend-
ing to make the interest payments on the debt. Interest payments are currently about 10 
percent of total federal expenditures. At this level, tax increases or significant cutbacks 
in other types of federal spending are not required.
In the long run, a debt that increases in size relative to GDP, as was happening 
after 2008, can pose a problem. As we discussed previously, crowding out of invest-
ment spending may occur if an increasing debt drives up interest rates. Lower invest-
ment spending means a lower capital stock in the long run and a reduced capacity of 
the economy to produce goods and services. This effect is somewhat offset if some of 
the government debt was incurred to finance improvements in infrastructure, such as 
Figure 27.15 
The Federal Government Debt,

The federal government debt increases 
whenever the federal government runs a budget 
deficit. The large deficits incurred during 
World Wars I and II, the Great Depression, and 
the 1980s and early 1990s increased the ratio of 
debt to GDP. The large deficits of 2009 to 2011 
caused the ratio to spike up to its highest level 
since 1947.

bridges, highways, and ports; to finance education; or to finance research and devel-
opment. Improvements in infrastructure, a better-educated labor force, and additional 
research and development can add to the productive capacity of the economy.
The Effects of Fiscal Policy in the Long Run
Some fiscal policy actions are intended to meet the short-run goal of stabilizing the 
economy. Other fiscal policy actions are intended to have long-run effects by expand-
ing the productive capacity of the economy and increasing the rate of economic growth. 
Because these policy actions primarily affect aggregate supply rather than aggregate de-
mand, they are sometimes referred to as supply-side economics. Most fiscal policy ac-
tions that attempt to increase aggregate supply do so by changing taxes to increase the 
incentives to work, save, invest, and start a business.
The Long-Run Effects of Tax Policy
The difference between the pretax and posttax return to an economic activity is known 
as the tax wedge. The tax wedge applies to the marginal tax rate, which is the fraction of 
each additional dollar of income that must be paid in taxes. For example, the U.S. federal 
income tax has several tax brackets, which are the income ranges within which a tax rate 
applies. In 2011, for a single taxpayer, the tax rate was 10 percent on the first $8,500 earned 
during a year. The tax rate rose for higher income brackets, until it reached 35  percent on 
income earned above $379,150. Suppose you are paid a wage of $20 per hour. If your 
marginal income tax rate is 25 percent, then your after-tax wage is $15, and the tax 
wedge is $5. When discussing the model of demand and supply in Chapter 3, we saw that 
 increasing the price of a good or service increases the quantity supplied. So, we would ex-
pect that reducing the tax wedge by cutting the marginal tax rate on income would result 
in a larger quantity of labor supplied because the after-tax wage would be higher. Simi-
larly, we saw in Chapter 21 that a reduction in the income tax would increase the after-tax 
return to saving, causing an increase in the supply of loanable funds, a lower equilibrium 
interest rate, and an increase in investment spending. In general, economists believe that 
the smaller the tax wedge for any economic activity—such as working, saving, investing, 
or starting a business—the more of that economic activity that will occur. When work-
ers, savers, investors, or entrepreneurs change their behavior as a result of a tax change, 
economists say that there has been a behavioral response to the tax change.
We can look briefly at the effects on aggregate supply of cutting each of the  following 
taxes:
• 
Individual income tax. As we have seen, reducing the marginal tax rates on indi-
vidual income will reduce the tax wedge faced by workers, thereby increasing the 
quantity of labor supplied. Many small businesses are sole proprietorships, whose 
profits are taxed at the individual income tax rates. Therefore, cutting the individual 
income tax rates also raises the return to entrepreneurship, encouraging the open-
ing of new businesses. Most households are also taxed on their returns from saving 
at the individual income tax rates. Reducing marginal income tax rates, therefore, 
also increases the return to saving.
• 
Corporate income tax. The federal government taxes the profits earned by corpo-
rations under the corporate income tax. In 2011, most corporations faced a mar-
ginal corporate tax rate of 35 percent. Cutting the marginal corporate income tax 
rate would encourage investment spending by increasing the return corporations 
receive from new investments in equipment, factories, and office buildings. Because 
innovations are often embodied in new investment goods, cutting the corporate 
 income tax can potentially increase the pace of technological change.
• 
Taxes on dividends and capital gains. Corporations distribute some of their prof-
its to shareholders in the form of payments known as dividends. Shareholders also 
may benefit from higher corporate profits by receiving capital gains. A capital gain

The Effects of Fiscal Policy in the Long Run

is the increase in the price of an asset, such as a share of stock. Rising profits usu-
ally result in rising stock prices and capital gains to shareholders. Individuals pay 
taxes on both dividends and capital gains (although the tax on capital gains can 
be postponed if the stock is not sold). As a result, the same earnings are, in effect, 
taxed twice: once when a corporation pays the corporate income tax on its profits 
and a second time when the profits are received by individual investors in the form 
of dividends or capital gains. Economists debate the costs and benefits of a separate 
tax on corporate profits. With the corporate income tax remaining in place, one 
way to reduce the “double taxation” problem is to reduce the taxes on dividends and 
capital gains. These taxes were, in fact, reduced in 2003, and in 2011, the marginal 
tax rates on dividends and capital gains were still well below the top marginal tax 
rate on individual income. Lowering the tax rates on dividends and capital gains 
increases the supply of loanable funds from households to firms, increasing saving 
and investment and lowering the equilibrium real interest rate.
Tax Simplification
In addition to the potential gains from cutting individual taxes, there are also gains from 
tax simplification. The complexity of the tax code has created a whole industry of tax 
preparation services, such as H&R Block. At almost 3,000 pages long, the tax code is 
extremely complex. The Internal Revenue Service estimates that taxpayers spend more 
than 6.4 billion hours each year filling out their tax forms, or about 45 hours per tax re-
turn. Households and firms have to deal with more than 480 tax forms to file their fed-
eral taxes. It is not surprising that there are more H&R Block offices around the country 
than Starbucks coffeehouses.
If the tax code were greatly simplified, the economic resources currently used by 
the tax preparation industry would be available to produce other goods and services. In 
addition to wasting resources, the complexity of the tax code may also distort the deci-
sions made by households and firms. For example, the tax rate on dividends has clearly 
affected whether corporations pay dividends. When Congress passed a reduction in the 
tax on dividends in 2003, many firms—including Microsoft—began paying dividends 
for the first time. A simplified tax code would increase economic efficiency by reducing 
the number of decisions households and firms make solely to reduce their tax payments.
The Economic Effect of Tax Reform
We can analyze the economic effects of tax reduction and simplification by using the 
aggregate demand and aggregate supply model. Figure 27.16 shows that without tax 
changes, the long-run aggregate supply curve will shift from LRAS1 to LRAS2. This shift 
represents the increases in the labor force and the capital stock and the technological 
change that would occur even without tax reduction and simplification. To focus on 
the effect of tax changes on aggregate supply, we will ignore any shifts in the short-run 
aggregate supply curve, and we will assume that the aggregate demand curve remains 
unchanged, at AD1. In this case, equilibrium moves from point A to point B, with real 
GDP increasing from Y1 to Y2 and the price level decreasing from P1 to P2.
If tax reduction and simplification are effective, the economy will experience in-
creases in labor supply, saving, investment, and the formation of new firms. Economic 
efficiency will also be improved. Together these factors will result in an increase in the 
quantity of real GDP supplied at every price level. We show the effects of the tax changes 
in Figure 27.16 by a shift in the long-run aggregate supply curve to LRAS3. With aggre-
gate demand remaining unchanged, the equilibrium in the economy moves from point 
A to point C (rather than to point B, which is the equilibrium without tax changes), with 
real GDP increasing from Y1 to Y3 and the price level decreasing from P1 to P3. Notice 
that compared with the equilibrium without tax changes (point B), the equilibrium with 
tax changes (point C) occurs at a lower price level and a higher level of real GDP. We can 
conclude that the tax changes have benefited the economy by increasing output and em-
ployment while at the same time reducing the price level.

934 
C H A P T E R  2 7  Fiscal Policy
Clearly, our analysis is unrealistic because we have ignored the changes in aggre-
gate demand and short-run aggregate supply that will occur. How would a more real-
istic analysis differ from the simplified one in Figure 27.16? The change in real GDP 
would be the same because in the long run, real GDP is equal to its potential level, 
which is represented by the long-run aggregate supply curve. The results for the price 
level would be different, however, because we would expect both aggregate demand 
and short-run aggregate supply to shift to the right. The likeliest case is that the price 
level would end up higher in the new equilibrium than in the original equilibrium. 
However, because the position of the long-run aggregate supply curve is further to the 
right as a result of the tax changes, the increase in the price level will be smaller; that 
is, the price level at point C is likely to be lower than P2, even if it is higher than P3, 
although—as we will discuss in the next section—not all economists would agree. We 
can conclude that a successful policy of tax reductions and simplifications will benefit 
the economy by increasing output and employment and, at the same time, may result 
in smaller increases in the price level.
How Large Are Supply-Side Effects?
Most economists would agree that there are supply-side effects to reducing taxes: De-
creasing marginal income tax rates will increase the quantity of labor supplied, cutting 
the corporate income tax will increase investment spending, and so on. The magnitude 
of the effects is the subject of considerable debate, however. For example, some econo-
mists argue that the increase in the quantity of labor supplied following a tax cut will 
be limited because many people work a number of hours set by their employers and 
lack the opportunity to work additional hours. Similarly, some economists believe that 
tax changes have only a small effect on saving and investment. In this view, saving and 
investment are affected much more by changes in income or changes in expectations 
of the future profitability of new investment due to technological change or improving 
macroeconomic conditions than they are by tax changes.
Economists who are skeptical of the magnitude of supply-side effects believe that 
tax cuts have their greatest effect on aggregate demand rather than on aggregate supply. 
In their view, focusing on the effect of tax cuts on aggregate demand, while ignoring any 
effect on aggregate supply, yields accurate forecasts of future movements in real GDP 
and the price level, which indicates that the supply-side effects must be small. If tax 
changes have only small effects on aggregate supply, it is unlikely that they will reduce 
the size of price increases to the extent shown in the analysis in Figure 27.16.
Ultimately, the debate over the size of the supply-side effects of tax policy can be 
resolved only through careful study of the effects of differences in tax rates on labor 
Figure 27.16

gate supply curve shifts to the right, from

to P2 and real GDP increasing from Y1 to Y2. 
With tax reductions and simplifications, the 
long-run aggregate supply curve shifts fur-
ther to the right, to LRAS3, and equilibrium 
moves to point C, with the price level falling 
to P3 and real GDP increasing to Y3.

supply and on saving and investment decisions. Some recent studies have arrived at con-
flicting conclusions, however. For example, a study by Nobel Laureate Edward Prescott 
of Arizona State University concludes that the differences between the United States and 
Europe with respect to the average number of hours worked per week and the average 
number of weeks worked per year are due to differences in taxes. The lower marginal tax 
rates in the United States compared with Europe increase the return to working for U.S. 
workers and result in a larger quantity of labor supplied. But another study by Alberto 
Alesina and Edward Glaeser of Harvard University and Bruce Sacerdote of Dartmouth 
College argues that the more restrictive labor market regulations in Europe explain the 
shorter work weeks and longer vacations of European workers and that differences in 
taxes have only a small effect.
As in other areas of economics, differences among economists in their estimates 
of the supply-side effects of tax changes may narrow over time as they conduct more 
studies.
Conclusion
In this chapter, we have seen how the federal government uses changes in government 
purchases and taxes to achieve its economic policy goals. We have seen that economists 
debate the effectiveness of discretionary fiscal policy actions intended to stabilize the 
economy. Congress and the president share responsibility for economic policy with 
the Federal Reserve. In Chapter 28, we will discuss further some of the challenges that 
the Federal Reserve encounters as it carries out monetary policy. In Chapters 29 and 30, 
we will look more closely at the international economy, including how monetary and 
fiscal policy are affected by the linkages between economies.

and against using infrastructure spending to increase employment.

Economics in Your Life
What Would You Do with $500?
At the beginning of the chapter, we asked how you would respond to a $500 tax rebate and what 
effect this tax rebate would likely have on equilibrium real GDP in the short run. This chapter has 
shown that tax cuts increase disposable income and that when there is a permanent increase in 
disposable income, consumption spending increases. So, you will likely respond to a permanent 
$500 increase in your disposable income by increasing your spending. How much your spending 
increases depends in part on your overall financial situation. As mentioned in the chapter, people 
who are able to borrow usually try to smooth out their spending over time and don’t increase 
spending much in response to a one-time increase in their income. But if you are a student strug-
gling to get by on a low income and you are unable to borrow against the higher income you 
expect to earn in the future, you may well spend most of the rebate. This chapter has also shown 
that tax cuts have a multiplier effect on the economy. That is, an increase in consumption spend-
ing sets off further increases in real GDP and income. So, if the economy is not already at potential 
GDP, this tax rebate will likely increase equilibrium real GDP in the short run.

Are Infrastructure 
Projects the Answer 
to America’s Jobs 
Problem? 
Infrastructure spending is expected 
to be one of the chief components of 
the jobs plan that President Obama 
will unveil in September. The idea of 
spending on public works projects like 
road-building as economic stimulus 
has been a mainstay of jobs proposals 
from both congressional Democrats 
and the White House in recent years. 
But opponents question its efficiency 
at creating jobs—and its cost.
 According to data from Moody’s 
Analytics, which performs economic 
analysis and forecasting, infrastruc-
ture spending is more effective, dol-
lar for dollar, than many forms of tax 
cuts at boosting jobs growth. But af-
ter passing legislation, going through 
the appropriations process, identi-
fying projects, planning, and hiring 
workers, the time it takes the federal 
government bureaucracy to get that 
money out the door can mean delayed 
or even diminished economic im-
pact. Add to that a particularly slow-
moving Congress with a propensity 
for partisan divides that slow or halt 
much legislation—and the current cli-
mate of budget-cutting—and a poten-
tially promising policy move could be 
greatly undercut or never enacted.
Many Republican lawmakers have 
in the past decried spending on in-
frastructure. When President Obama 
U.S. NEWS & WORLD REPORT
introduced the idea of a national in-
frastructure bank in September 2010, 
Representative Eric Cantor called 
it “yet another government stimu-
lus effort” and House Speaker John 
Boehner called it “more of the same 
failed ‘stimulus’ spending,” alluding 
to the 2009 American Recovery and 
Reinvestment Act that the president 
introduced to counteract the Great 
Recession. That $787-billion stimulus 
package created far fewer jobs than the 
White House had initially predicted, a 
point that stimulus critics often make. 
But not all Republicans are opposed to 
infrastructure spending; Texas Sena-
tor Kay Bailey Hutchison, for example, 
co-sponsored a bill with Massachusetts 
Democrat John Kerry in March, pro-
posing an infrastructure bank.
 The theory behind infrastruc-
ture spending is the multiplier effect: 
the idea that every dollar in govern-
ment expenditures can increase GDP 
by more than one dollar by starting 
economic chain reactions: the govern-
ment pays firms for goods and services 
and those firms then pay employees 
who then spend their paychecks.
Moody’s Analytics estimates that 
the multiplier effect for increases in 
government spending is generally 
larger than the multiplier for tax cuts. 
Any additional dollar spent on perma-
nent tax cuts adds to GDP by signifi-
cantly less than a dollar. Making the 
Bush tax cuts permanent, for example, 
would add to GDP by $0.29 for every 
dollar of revenue reduction, accord-
ing to calculations from Moody’s. In-
frastructure spending would add by 
Obama Proposes Additional Spending 
to Stimulate the Economy
$1.59 for every dollar spent, while ex-
tending unemployment insurance and 
temporarily increasing food stamps 
would add even more.
 The mitigating factor, then, is 
the speed (or lack thereof) with which 
infrastructure spending works. In 
past recessions, infrastructure proj-
ects have taken so long to get off the 
ground that their effects were only felt 
after recovery had begun, says Alan 
Viard, resident scholar at the Ameri-
can Enterprise Institute, a conserva-
tive think tank. “Dollar for dollar, [tax 
cuts and direct government payments] 
may not stimulate the economy as 
much as infrastructure spending, but 
they can be timed effectively. . . . If we 
expect [economic weakness] to last 
long enough for new infrastructure 
spending to come online, we’ve really 
got pretty serious problems. . . .”
It is difficult to dispute that tax 
cuts and direct government payments 
could provide rapid stimulus, but 
like any policy, those also have their 
downsides. “It’s true that if you want 
an instant stimulus, you’d send people 
checks. . . . And a certain amount of 
that would be lost. Some would go to 
savings and paying back debt, and a 
fair amount would go to buying things 
that are not made in the U.S.,” says 
Ross Eisenbrey, vice president of the 
liberal Economic Policy Institute. . . .

is equal to the initial increase in government 
spending. Due to the multiplier effect, ag-
gregate demand continues to increase, 
from AD to AD2. The increase in spending 
therefore results in a larger increase in real 
GDP. Moody’s Analytics estimates that the 
multiplier for infrastructure spending is 1.59, 
so for every $1 increase in spending, real 
GDP will increase by $1.59.
c The length of time it takes for infra-
structure spending to affect the econ-
omy can make a large difference in the 
overall effectiveness of the spending. If the 
spending only starts after a relatively long 
period of time, the economy may have al-
ready begun to recover by the time the ad-
ditional spending can have an effect. In this 
case, the  expansionary fiscal policy could 
expand aggregate demand by too great an 
amount, leading to an eventual increase in 
inflation.
Thinking Critically 
About Policy
1. President Obama’s economic team 
calculated the effects of its economic 
stimulus package using estimates of 
the government spending multiplier. 
Some economists, though, argue that 
administration economists have over-
estimated the sizes of the government 
purchases and tax multipliers. Other 
economists have argued that the sizes 
of these multipliers were underesti-
mated. Why do economists have diffi-
culty in reaching agreement on the sizes 
of these multipliers?
2. The Obama administration’s  stimulus 
spending resulted in a large  increase in 
the federal budget deficit.  Administration 
economists, however, were relatively 
unconcerned that crowding out would 
reduce the effect of the stimulus spend-
ing on real GDP. Briefly explain what 
crowding out is and why the administra-
tion was relatively unconcerned about it 
as it implemented the stimulus package.
administration introduced the American Re-
covery and Reinvestment Act in 2009, a 
stimulus package designed to combat the 
recession that began in December 2007. A 
portion of this stimulus package was desig-
nated for infrastructure spending, and the 
administration believed that it would have a 
greater economic effect than the less-than-
successful tax rebate program implemented 
by the Bush administration in 2008. Accord-
ing to Moody’s Analytics, an economic 
analysis and forecasting company, each 
dollar of infrastructure spending has a 
greater effect on job growth than does each 
dollar in tax cuts, but infrastructure spend-
ing is subject to potentially significant time 
delays because Congress needs to approve 
the spending, infrastructure projects need 
to be identified and planned, and workers 
need to be hired. The amount of time it 
takes to actually implement these projects 
can delay or even weaken their economic 
effect.
b An increase in infrastructure spending 
is subject to the multiplier effect, where 
every dollar spent will increase GDP by 
more than one dollar. The figure below 
shows aggregate demand increasing from 
AD1 to AD when infrastructure spending is 
first increased. The amount of the increase 
Key Points in the Article
Proponents of spending on infrastructure 
as a means of stimulating the economy ar-
gue that for each dollar spent, infrastructure 
spending is more effective than tax cuts at 
creating jobs. They also estimate that the 
multiplier effect for increases in government 
spending is larger than the multiplier effect 
for tax cuts. Those opposed to using in-
frastructure spending as a way to increase 
employment argue that the 2009 American 
Recovery and Reinvestment Act created 
considerably fewer jobs than had been pre-
dicted. An important factor in determining 
job creation through infrastructure spending 
is the time needed for the spending to oc-
cur and to have its full effect on the econ-
omy. Although infrastructure spending may 
stimulate the economy more than tax cuts, 
it may also take a long time for Congress 
to approve spending programs and for the 
programs actually to take effect.

Summary
Fiscal policy involves changes in federal taxes and purchases that 
are intended to achieve macroeconomic policy objectives. Auto-
matic stabilizers are government spending and taxes that auto-
matically increase or decrease along with the business cycle. Since 
World War II, the federal government’s share of total government 
expenditures has been between two-thirds and three-quarters. 
Federal government expenditures as a percentage of GDP rose 
from 1950 to the early 1990s and fell between 1992 and 2001, be-
fore rising again. Federal government purchases have declined as 
a percentage of GDP since the end of the Korean War in the early 
1950s. The largest component of federal expenditures is transfer 
payments. The largest sources of federal government revenue are 
individual income taxes, followed by social insurance taxes, which 
are used to fund the Social Security and Medicare systems.

27.3
 
LEARNING OBJECTIVE: Use the dynamic aggregate demand and aggregate supply model 
to analyze fiscal policy.
Summary
We can use the dynamic aggregate demand and aggregate supply 
model introduced in Chapter 24 to look more closely at expan-
sionary and contractionary fiscal policies. The dynamic aggre-
gate demand and aggregate supply model takes into account that 
(1) the economy experiences continuing inflation, with the price 
level rising every year, and (2) the economy experiences long-run 
growth, with the LRAS curve shifting to the right every year. In 
the dynamic model, an expansionary fiscal policy tries to ensure 
that the aggregate demand curve will shift far enough to the right 
to bring about macroeconomic equilibrium, with real GDP equal 
to potential GDP. A contractionary fiscal policy attempts to off-
set movements in aggregate demand that would cause macroeco-
nomic equilibrium to occur at a level of real GDP that is greater 
than potential real GDP.

private enterprise . . . to dig the notes up again

come of the community . . . would probably

ernment purchases need to be increased to bring the 
economy to equilibrium at potential GDP?
 
b. Holding other factors constant, by how much will taxes 
have to be cut to bring the economy to equilibrium at 
potential GDP?
 
c. Construct an example of a combination of increased

4.6 [Related to Solved Problem 27.4 on page 918] Briefly 
explain whether you agree with the following statement:
Real GDP is currently $14.7 trillion, and po-
tential real GDP is $14.4 trillion. If Congress 
and the president would decrease government 
purchases by $300 billion or increase taxes by 
$300 billion, the economy could be brought to 
equilibrium at potential GDP.
Summary
Because of the multiplier effect, an increase in government pur-
chases or a cut in taxes will have a multiplied effect on equilib-
rium real GDP. The government purchases multiplier is equal 
to the change in equilibrium real GDP divided by the change in 
government purchases. The tax multiplier is equal to the change 
in equilibrium real GDP divided by the change in taxes. Increases 
in government purchases and cuts in taxes have a positive mul-
tiplier effect on equilibrium real GDP. Decreases in government 
purchases and increases in taxes have a negative multiplier effect 
on equilibrium real GDP.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE: Discuss the difficulties that can arise in implementing fiscal policy.
Summary
Poorly timed fiscal policy can do more harm than good. Getting the 
timing right with fiscal policy can be difficult because obtaining ap-
proval from Congress for a new fiscal policy can be a very long pro-
cess and because it can take months for an increase in authorized 
spending to actually take place. Because an increase in government 
purchases may lead to a higher interest rate, it may result in a decline 
in consumption, investment, and net exports. A decline in private ex-
penditures as a result of an increase in government purchases is called 
crowding out. Crowding out may cause an expansionary fiscal policy 
to fail to meet its goal of keeping the economy at potential GDP.

The following is from a message by President Hoover to 
Congress, dated May 5, 1932:
I need not recount that the revenues of the 
Government as estimated for the next fiscal 
year show a decrease of about $1,700,000,000 
below the fiscal year 1929, and inexorably re-
quire a broader basis of taxation and a drastic 
reduction of expenditures in order to balance 
the Budget. Nothing is more necessary at this 
time than balancing the Budget.
 
 Do you think President Hoover was correct in saying that, 
in 1932, nothing was more necessary than balancing the 
federal government’s budget? Explain.
 
6.9 According to an article in the Wall Street Journal, “Federal 
Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke warned Congress and 
the White House that the U.S. economy will suffer if they 
don’t move soon to rein in the federal budget deficit.” How 
might the economy suffer from large federal deficits? How 
can Congress and the president “rein in” the federal budget 
deficit?

Reduction, Sees Growth This Year,” Wall Street Journal, June 4, 2009.
 6.10 An editorial in the Wall Street Journal declares, “We don’t 
put much stock in future budget forecasts because they de-
pend on so many variables.” What variables would a fore-
cast of future federal budget deficits depend on? What is 
it about these variables that makes future budget deficits 
difficult to predict?
From “Fiscal Revelation,” Wall Street Journal, February 6, 2007.
 6.11 An article in the Economist described the situation in Japan 
in mid-2009: “Nor is there much sign that Japan’s gaping 
budget deficits have crowded out private investment. [In-
terest rates] on long-term Japanese bonds . . . are still only 
1.45%, even as gross public debt is heading for 200% of 
GDP.” Why would “gaping budget deficits” be expected to 
lead to crowding out? Why does the fact that interest rates 
in Japan have not risen indicate that crowding out may not 
yet be a problem?
From “Damage Assessment,” Economist, May 14, 2009.

Summary
Some fiscal policy actions are intended to have long-run effects by 
expanding the productive capacity of the economy and increasing 
the rate of economic growth. Because these policy actions primarily 
affect aggregate supply rather than aggregate demand, they are some-
times referred to as supply-side economics. The difference between 
the pretax and posttax return to an economic activity is known as the 
tax wedge. Economists believe that the smaller the tax wedge for any 
economic activity—such as working, saving, investing, or starting a 
business—the more of that economic activity will occur. Economists 
debate the size of the supply-side effects of tax changes.

Appendix
A Closer Look at the Multiplier
In this chapter, we saw that changes in government purchases and changes in taxes 
have a multiplied effect on equilibrium real GDP. In this appendix, we will build a sim-
ple economic model of the multiplier effect. When economists forecast the effect of a 
change in spending or taxes, they often rely on econometric models. As we saw in the 
appendix to Chapter 23, an econometric model is an economic model written in the 
form of equations, where each equation has been statistically estimated, using methods 
similar to those used in estimating demand curves, as briefly described in Chapter 3. In 
this appendix, we will start with a model similar to the one we used in the appendix to 
Chapter 23.
An Expression for Equilibrium Real GDP
We can write a set of equations that includes the key macroeconomic relationships we 
have studied in this and previous chapters. It is important to note that in this model, 
we will be assuming that the price level is constant. We know that this is unrealistic 
because an upward-sloping SRAS curve means that when the aggregate demand curve 
shifts, the price level will change. Nevertheless, our model will be approximately cor-
rect when changes in the price level are small. It also serves as an introduction to more 
complicated models that take into account changes in the price level. For simplicity, we 
also start out by assuming that taxes, T, do not depend on the level of real GDP, Y. We 
also assume that there are no government transfer payments to households. Finally, we 
assume that we have a closed economy, with no imports or exports. The numbers (with 
the exception of the MPC) represent billions of dollars:
(1) C 5 1,000 1 0.75(Y 2 T)
Consumption function
(2) I 5 1,500
Planned investment function
(3) G 5 1,500
Government purchases function
(4) T 5 1,000
Tax function
(5) Y 5 C 1 I 1 G
Equilibrium condition
The first equation is the consumption function. The marginal propensity to con-
sume, or MPC, is 0.75, and 1,000 is the level of autonomous consumption, which is the 
level of consumption that does not depend on income. We assume that consumption 
depends on disposable income, which is Y - T. The functions for planned investment 
spending, government spending, and taxes are very simple because we have assumed 
that these variables are not affected by GDP and, therefore, are constant. Economists 
who use this type of model to forecast GDP would, of course, use more realistic planned 
investment, government purchases, and tax functions.
Equation (5)—the equilibrium condition—states that equilibrium GDP equals the 
sum of consumption spending, planned investment spending, and government pur-
chases. To calculate a value for equilibrium real GDP, we need to substitute equations 
(1) through (4) into equation (5). This substitution gives us the following:
 Y = 1,000 + 0.75(Y - 1,000) + 1,500 + 1,500
 = 1,000 + 0.75Y - 750 + 1,500 + 1,500.
We need to solve this equation for Y to find equilibrium GDP. The first step is to sub-
tract 0.75Y from both sides of the equation:
Y - 0.75Y = 1,000 - 750 + 1,500 + 1,500.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
Apply the multiplier formula.

 
Appendix A Closer Look at the Multiplier 
945
Then, we solve for Y:
0.25Y = 3,250
or
Y = 3,250
0.25 = 13,000.
To make this result more general, we can replace particular values with general  values 
represented by letters:
C = C + MPC(Y - T)
Consumption function
I = I
Planned investment function
G = G
Government purchases function
T = T
Tax function
Y = C + I + G
Equilibrium condition
The letters with bars above them represent fixed, or autonomous, values that do not 
depend on the values of other variables. So, C represents autonomous consumption, 
which had a value of 1,000 in our original example. Now, solving for equilibrium, we get:
Y = C + MPC(Y - T) + I + G
or
Y - MPC(Y) = C - (MPC * T) + I + G
or
Y(1 - MPC) = C - (MPC * T) + I + G
or
Y = C - (MPC * T) + I + G
1 - MPC
.
A Formula for the Government  
Purchases Multiplier
To find a formula for the government purchases multiplier, we need to rewrite the last 
equation for changes in each variable rather than levels. Letting D stand for the change in 
a variable, we have
DY = DC - (MPC * DT) + DI + DG
1 - MPC
.
If we hold constant changes in autonomous consumption spending, planned investment 
spending, and taxes, we can find a formula for the government purchases multiplier, which 
is the ratio of the change in equilibrium real GDP to the change in government purchases:
DY =
DG
1 - MPC
or
Government purchases multiplier = DY
DG =
1
1 - MPC
.
For an MPC of 0.75, the government purchases multiplier will be
1
1 - 0.75 = 4.

946 
C H A P T E R  2 7  Fiscal Policy
A government purchases multiplier of 4 means that an increase in government spend-
ing of $10 billion will increase equilibrium real GDP by 4 * +10 billion = +40 billion.
A Formula for the Tax Multiplier
We can also find a formula for the tax multiplier. We start again with this equation:
DY = DC - (MPC * DT) + DI + DG
1 - MPC
.
Now we hold constant the values of autonomous consumption spending, planned in-
vestment spending, and government purchases, but we allow the value of taxes to 
change:
DY =
- MPC * DT
1 - MPC
.
Or:
The tax multiplier = DY
DT =
-MPC
1 - MPC
.
For an MPC of 0.75, the tax multiplier will be:
-0.75
1 - 0.75 = -3.
The tax multiplier is a negative number because an increase in taxes causes a decrease 
in equilibrium real GDP, and a decrease in taxes causes an increase in equilibrium real 
GDP. A tax multiplier of 23 means that a decrease in taxes of $10 billion will increase 
equilibrium real GDP by -3 * - +10 billion = +30 billion. In this chapter, we dis-
cussed the economic reasons for the tax multiplier being smaller than the government 
spending multiplier.
The “Balanced Budget” Multiplier
What will be the effect of equal increases (or decreases) in government purchases and 
taxes on equilibrium real GDP? At first, it might appear that the tax increase would exactly 
offset the government purchases increase, leaving real GDP unchanged. But we have just 
seen that the government purchases multiplier is larger (in absolute value) than the tax 
multiplier. We can use our formulas for the government purchases multiplier and the tax 
multiplier to calculate the net effect of increasing government purchases by $10 billion at 
the same time that taxes are increased by $10 billion:
 Increase in real GDP from the
increase in government purchases = +10 billion *
1
1 - MPC
 
Decrease in real GDP from
 
the increase in taxes 
= +10 billion *
-MPC
1 - MPC
So, the combined effect equals
+10 billion * c a
1
1 - MPCb + a
- MPC
1 - MPCb d
or
+10 billion * a 1 - MPC
1 - MPCb = +10 billion.

 
Appendix A Closer Look at the Multiplier 
947
The balanced budget multiplier is, therefore, equal to 11 - MPC2>11 - MPC2,  or 1. 
Equal dollar increases and decreases in government purchases and in taxes lead to the 
same dollar increase in real GDP in the short run.
The Effects of Changes in Tax Rates  
on the Multiplier
We now consider the effect of a change in the tax rate, as opposed to a change in a 
fixed amount of taxes. Changing the tax rate actually changes the value of the multi-
plier. To see this, suppose that the tax rate is 20 percent, or 0.2. In that case, an increase 
in household income of $10 billion will increase disposable income by only $8 billion 
[or 10 billion * 11 - 0.22]. In general, an increase in income can be multiplied by (1 - t) 
to find the increase in disposable income, where t is the tax rate. So, we can rewrite the 
consumption function as:
C = C + MPC(1 - t)Y.
We can use this expression for the consumption function to find an expression for the 
government purchases multiplier, using the same method we used previously:
Government purchases multiplier = DY
DG =
1
1 - MPC(1 - t)
.
We can see the effect of changing the tax rate on the size of the multiplier by trying 
some values. First, assume that MPC = 0.75 and t = 0.2. Then:
Government purchases multiplier = DY
DG =
1
1 - 0.75(1 - 0.2) =
1
1 - 0.6 = 2.5.
This value is smaller than the multiplier of 4 that we calculated by assuming that there 
was only a fixed amount of taxes (which is the same as assuming that the marginal tax 
rate was zero). This multiplier is smaller because spending in each period is now re-
duced by the amount of taxes households must pay on any additional income they earn. 
We can calculate the multiplier for an MPC of 0.75 and a lower tax rate of 0.1:
Government purchases multiplier = DY
DG =
1
1 - 0.75(1 - 0.1) =
1
1 - 0.675 = 3.1.
Cutting the tax rate from 20 percent to 10 percent increased the value of the multiplier 
from 2.5 to 3.1.
The Multiplier in an Open Economy
Up to now, we have assumed that the economy is closed, with no imports or exports. We can 
consider the case of an open economy by including net exports in our analysis. Recall that 
net exports equal exports minus imports. Exports are determined primarily by factors—
such as the exchange value of the dollar and the levels of real GDP in other countries—that 
we do not include in our model. So, we will assume that exports are fixed, or autonomous:
Exports = Exports
Imports will increase as real GDP increases because households will spend some por-
tion of an increase in income on imports. We can define the marginal propensity to im-
port (MPI) as the fraction of an increase in income that is spent on imports. So, our 
expression for imports is
Imports = MPI * Y.

948 
C H A P T E R  2 7  Fiscal Policy
We can substitute our expressions for exports and imports into the expression we 
derived earlier for equilibrium real GDP:
Y = C + MPC11 - t2Y + I + G + 3Exports - 1MPI * Y24,
where the expression [Exports - 1MPI * Y2] represents net exports. We can now find 
an expression for the government purchases multiplier by using the same method we 
used previously:
Government purchases multiplier = DY
DG =
1
1 - [MPC(1 - t) - MPI].
We can see the effect of changing the value of the marginal propensity to import on 
the size of the multiplier by trying some values of key variables. First, assume that 
MPC = 0.75, t = 0.2, and MPI = 0.1. Then:
Government purchases multiplier = DY
DG =
1
1 - (0.75(1 - 0.2) - 0.1) =
1
1 - 0.5 = 2.
This value is smaller than the multiplier of 2.5 that we calculated by assuming that there 
were no exports or imports (which is the same as assuming that the marginal propensity 
to import was zero). This multiplier is smaller because spending in each period is now 
reduced by the amount of imports households buy with any additional income they earn. 
We can calculate the multiplier with MPC = 0.75, t = 0.2, and a higher MPI of 0.2:
Government purchases multiplier = DY
DG =
1
1 - (0.75(1 - 0.2) - 0.2) =
1
1 - 0.4 = 1.7.
Increasing the marginal propensity to import from 0.1 to 0.2 decreases the value of the 
multiplier from 2 to 1.7. We can conclude that countries with a higher marginal pro-
pensity to import will have smaller multipliers than countries with a lower marginal 
propensity to import.
Bear in mind that the multiplier is a short-run effect which assumes that the econ-
omy is below the level of potential real GDP. In the long run, the economy is at potential 
real GDP, so an increase in government purchases causes a decline in the nongovern-
ment components of real GDP but leaves the level of real GDP unchanged.
The analysis in this appendix is simplified compared to what would be carried out 
by an economist forecasting the effects of changes in government purchases or changes 
in taxes on equilibrium real GDP in the short run. In particular, our assumption that 
the price level is constant is unrealistic. However, looking more closely at the determi-
nants of the multiplier has helped us see more clearly some important macroeconomic 
relationships.

Economics in Your Life
Is It Wise to Delay a Job Search?
Your friend was recently laid off from her entry-level job as a computer analyst. You call to console 
her, but she does not seem very upset. “Our state offers workers up to 99 weeks of unemployment 
compensation. I have almost two years before I have to find a new job. With my education and job 
experience, I should be able to find a new job by then without much trouble.” Your friend did well 
in school, but you are not sure that waiting almost two years to find a new job is a good idea. What 
advice would you give someone who has decided to wait nearly two years to look for a new job? 
As you read this chapter, see if you can answer this question. You can check your answer against the 
one we provide on page 973 at the end of this chapter.
When the Federal Reserve raised interest 
rates in 2006 and kept them high through 
mid-2007, it meant higher costs for con-
sumers who borrow money to buy cars.
By late 2008, the Fed had slashed the fed-
eral funds rate to near-zero levels. Although 
car dealers were hit hard by the recession, 
CarMax’s sales began to recover in 2009. 
Many consumers who balked at buying new 
cars viewed used cars as an affordable alter-
native, and low-interest loans reduced the 
monthly payments they would make. Though 
interest rates remained low and incomes had 
risen in 2010 and 2011, CarMax sales be-
gan to slip. Unemployment remained high, 
and consumer confidence was low. As CEO 
Thomas Folliard noted: “When you look at 
the product that we sell, it almost always re-
quires a loan, and somebody has . . . to be 
confident in signing up for [a loan, which can 
be] six and seven years long now on cars.” 
In this chapter, we will further explore 
the Fed’s attempts to balance its goals of 
price stability and high employment. AN 
INSIDE LOOK AT POLICY on page 974 
discusses how the Fed attempts to reduce 
unemployment without causing a signifi-
cant increase in inflation.
Based on Caitlin Nish, “Economy Crimps CarMax 
Sales,” Wall Street Journal, September 22, 2011; and 
Michael Myser, “The Wal-Mart of Used Cars,” Business 
2.0, October 2, 2006.
The Federal Reserve is continually balanc-
ing the risks of inflation against the risks of 
unemployment. A contractionary monetary 
policy that would help rein in inflation risks 
pushing the economy into recession. An 
expansionary policy that can reduce the ef-
fects of recession risks increasing inflation. 
Consider the following example of the Fed’s 
balancing act: In an attempt to cool the infla-
tionary effect of a booming housing market, 
the Fed raised the target for the federal funds 
rate to 5.25 percent in June 2006 and kept it 
there until September 2007. At that point, 
a rapidly declining housing market led the 
Fed to begin cutting the federal funds rate, 
although well into 2008, the Fed remained 
worried that rising oil and commodity prices 
could increase the inflation rate.
Behind the roller-coaster ride of GDP, un-
employment, and inflation are individual firms 
and workers. In 1991, former executives from 
Circuit City, the now-defunct consumer elec-
tronics store, started CarMax, using a new busi-
ness model. They believed customers would 
buy from dealers who  offered a large selection 
of cars with non-negotiable prices. Salespeople 
would earn flat commissions so there would be 
no incentive to coax customers to buy the most 
expensive models. Today,  CarMax has more 
than 100 “superstore” locations.
 Monetary policy affects the perfor-
mance of both new and used car companies. 
Why Does CarMax Worry  
about Monetary Policy?

952 
C H A P T E R  2 8  Inflation, Unemployment, and Federal Reserve Policy  
A
n important consideration for the Federal Reserve as it carries out monetary 
policy is that in the short run, there can be a trade-off between unemployment 
and inflation: Lower unemployment rates can result in higher inflation rates. 
In the long run, however, this trade-off disappears, and the unemployment rate 
is independent of the inflation rate. In this chapter, we will explore the relationship between 
inflation and unemployment in both the short run and the long run, and we will discuss 
what this relationship means for monetary policy. We will also provide an overview of how 
monetary policy has evolved over the years and conclude with a discussion of the debate 
over Fed policy during the 2007–2009 recession.
The Discovery of the Short-Run Trade-off 
between Unemployment and Inflation
Ordinarily, unemployment and inflation are the two great macroeconomic problems the 
Fed must deal with in the short run. As we saw in Chapter 24, when aggregate demand 
increases, unemployment usually falls, and inflation rises. When aggregate demand 
decreases, unemployment usually rises and inflation falls. As a result, there is a short-
run trade-off between unemployment and inflation: Higher unemployment is usually 
accompanied by lower inflation, and lower unemployment is usually accompanied by 
higher inflation. As we will see later in this chapter, this trade-off exists in the short 
run—a period that may be as long as several years—but disappears in the long run.
Although today the short-run trade-off between unemployment and inflation plays 
a role in the Fed’s monetary policy decisions, this trade-off was not widely recognized 
until the late 1950s. In 1957, New Zealand economist A. W. Phillips plotted data on the 
unemployment rate and the inflation rate in Great Britain and drew a curve showing 
their average relationship. Since that time, a graph showing the short-run relationship 
between the unemployment rate and the inflation rate has been called a Phillips curve. 
(Phillips actually measured inflation by the percentage change in wages rather than by 
the percentage change in prices. Because wages and prices usually move together, this 
difference is not important to our discussion.) Figure 28.1 shows a graph similar to the 
one Phillips prepared. Each point on the Phillips curve represents a possible combina-
tion of the unemployment rate and the inflation rate that might be observed in a given 
year. Point A represents a year in which the inflation rate is 4 percent and the unem-
ployment rate is 5 percent, and point B represents a year in which the inflation rate

A. W. Phillips was the first economist to 
show that there is usually an inverse relation-
ship  between unemployment and inflation. 
Here we can see this relationship at work: In 
the year  represented by point A, the inflation 
rate is 4 percent and the  unemployment rate 
is 5 percent. In the year represented by point 
B, the inflation rate is 2 percent and the un-
employment rate is 6 percent.

is 2 percent and the unemployment rate is 6 percent. Phillips documented that there 
is usually an inverse relationship between unemployment and inflation. During years 
when the unemployment rate is low, the inflation rate tends to be high, and during years 
when the unemployment rate is high, the inflation rate tends to be low.
Explaining the Phillips Curve with Aggregate 
Demand and Aggregate Supply Curves
The inverse relationship between unemployment and inflation that Phillips discovered 
is consistent with the aggregate demand and aggregate supply analysis we developed in 
Chapter 24. Figure 28.2 shows why this inverse relationship exists.
Panel (a) shows the aggregate demand and aggregate supply model from Chapter 24, 
and panel (b) shows the Phillips curve. For simplicity, in panel (a), we are using the basic 
aggregate demand and aggregate supply model, and we are assuming that the long-run 
aggregate supply curve and the short-run aggregate supply curve do not shift. To take 
a hypothetical example, assume that the economy in 2013 is at point A, with real GDP 
of $14.0 trillion and a price level of 100. If there is weak growth in aggregate demand, in 
2014, the economy moves to point B, with real GDP of $14.3 trillion and a price level of 
102. The inflation rate is 2 percent and the unemployment rate is 6 percent, which corre-
sponds to point B on the Phillips curve in panel (b). If there is strong growth in aggregate 
demand, in 2014, the economy moves to point C, with real GDP of $14.6 trillion and a 
price level of 104. Strong aggregate demand growth results in a higher inflation rate of  
4 percent but a lower unemployment rate of 5 percent. This combination of higher infla-
tion and lower unemployment is shown as point C on the Phillips curve in panel (b).
To summarize, the aggregate demand and aggregate supply model indicates that 
slow growth in aggregate demand leads to both higher unemployment and lower infla-
tion. This relationship explains why there is a short-run trade-off between unemploy-
ment and inflation, as shown by the downward-sloping Phillips curve. The AD–AS

and a price level of 100. If there is weak growth in aggregate demand, in 2014, 
the economy moves to point B, with real GDP of $14.3 trillion and a price level

which corresponds to point B on the Phillips curve in panel (b). If there is strong

C H A P T E R  2 8  Inflation, Unemployment, and Federal Reserve Policy  
model and the Phillips curve are different ways of illustrating the same macroeconomic 
events. The Phillips curve has an advantage over the aggregate demand and aggregate 
supply model, however, when we want to analyze explicitly changes in the inflation and 
unemployment rates.
Is the Phillips Curve a Policy Menu?
During the 1960s, some economists argued that the Phillips curve represented a struc-
tural relationship in the economy. A structural relationship depends on the basic be-
havior of consumers and firms and remains unchanged over long periods. Structural 
relationships are useful in formulating economic policy because policymakers can an-
ticipate that these relationships are constant—that is, the relationships will not change 
as a result of changes in policy.
If the Phillips curve were a structural relationship, it would present policymakers  
with a reliable menu of combinations of unemployment and inflation. Potentially, 
policymakers could use expansionary monetary and fiscal policies to choose a point 
on the curve that had lower unemployment and higher inflation. They could also use 
contractionary monetary and fiscal policies to choose a point that had lower inflation 
and higher unemployment. Because many economists and policymakers in the 1960s 
viewed the Phillips curve as a structural relationship, they believed it represented a per-
manent trade-off between unemployment and inflation. As long as policymakers were 
willing to accept a permanently higher inflation rate, they would be able to keep the un-
employment rate permanently lower. Similarly, a permanently lower inflation rate could 
be attained at the cost of a permanently higher unemployment rate. As we discuss in the 
next section, however, economists came to realize that the Phillips curve did not, in fact, 
represent a permanent trade-off between unemployment and inflation.
Is the Short-Run Phillips Curve Stable?
During the 1960s, the basic Phillips curve relationship seemed to hold because a stable 
trade-off appeared to exist between unemployment and inflation. In the early 1960s, 
the inflation rate was low, and the unemployment rate was high. In the late 1960s, the 
unemployment rate had declined, and the inflation rate had increased. Then in 1968, 
in his presidential address to the American Economic Association, Milton Friedman 
of the University of Chicago argued that the Phillips curve did not represent a perma-
nent trade-off between unemployment and inflation. At almost the same time, Edmund 
Phelps of Columbia University published an academic paper making a similar argu-
ment. Friedman and Phelps noted that economists had come to agree that the long-run 
aggregate supply curve was vertical (a point we discussed in Chapter 24). If this obser-
vation were true, the Phillips curve could not be downward sloping in the long run. A 
critical inconsistency exists between a vertical long-run aggregate supply curve and a 
long-run Phillips curve that is downward sloping. Friedman and Phelps argued, in es-
sence, that there is no trade-off between unemployment and inflation in the long run.
The Long-Run Phillips Curve
To understand the argument that there is no permanent trade-off between unemploy-
ment and inflation, first recall that the level of real GDP in the long run is also referred 
to as potential GDP. At potential GDP, firms will operate at their normal level of capac-
ity, and everyone who wants a job will have one, except the structurally and frictionally 
unemployed. Friedman defined the natural rate of unemployment as the unemploy-
ment rate that exists when the economy is at potential GDP. The actual unemployment 
rate will fluctuate in the short run but will always come back to the natural rate in the 
long run. In the same way, the actual level of real GDP will fluctuate in the short run but 
will always come back to its potential level in the long run.
In the long run, a higher or lower price level has no effect on real GDP because real 
GDP is always at its potential level in the long run. In the same way, in the long run, a 
higher or lower inflation rate will have no effect on the unemployment rate because the

unemployment rate is always equal to the natural rate in the long run. Figure 28.3 illus-
trates Friedman’s conclusion that the long-run aggregate supply curve is a vertical line at 
the potential real GDP, and the long-run Phillips curve is a vertical line at the natural rate 
of unemployment.
The Role of Expectations of Future Inflation
If the long-run Phillips curve is a vertical line, no trade-off exists between unemployment 
and inflation in the long run. This conclusion seemed to contradict the experience of the 
1950s and 1960s, which showed a stable trade-off between unemployment and inflation. 
Friedman argued that the statistics from those years actually showed only a short-run 
trade-off between inflation and unemployment.
The short-run trade-off existed—but only because workers and firms sometimes 
expected the inflation rate to be either higher or lower than it turned out to be. Differ-
ences between the expected inflation rate and the actual inflation rate could lead the 
unemployment rate to rise above or dip below the natural rate. To see why, consider a 
simple case of Ford negotiating a wage contract with the United Auto Workers (UAW) 
union. Remember that both Ford and the UAW are interested in the real wage, which is 
the nominal wage corrected for inflation. Suppose, for example, that Ford and the UAW 
agree on a wage of $31.50 per hour to be paid during 2015. Both Ford and the UAW 
expect that the price level will increase from 100 in 2014 to 105 in 2015, so the inflation 
rate will be 5 percent. We can calculate the real wage Ford expects to pay and the UAW 
expects to receive as follows:
Real wage = Nominal wage
Price level
* 100 = +31.50
105
* 100 = +30.
But suppose that the actual inflation rate turns out to be higher or lower than the 
expected inflation rate of 5 percent. Table 28.1 shows the effect on the actual real wage. 
If the price level rises only to 102 during 2015, the inflation rate will be 2 percent, and 
the actual real wage will be $30.88, which is higher than Ford and the UAW had ex-
pected. With a higher real wage, Ford will hire fewer workers than it had planned to at 
Figure 28.3

Milton Friedman and Edmund Phelps argued 
that there is no trade-off between unemploy-
ment and inflation in the long run. If real GDP 
automatically returns to its potential level in 
the long run, the unemployment rate must 
return to the natural rate of unemployment 
in the long run. In this figure, we assume that 
potential GDP is $14 trillion and the natural 
rate of unemployment is 5 percent.

the expected real wage of $30. If the inflation rate is 8 percent, the actual real wage will 
be $29.17, and Ford will hire more workers than it had planned to hire. If Ford and the 
UAW expected a higher or lower inflation rate than actually occurred, other firms and 
workers probably made the same assumption.
If actual inflation is higher than expected inflation, actual real wages in the econ-
omy will be lower than expected real wages, and many firms will hire more workers 
than they had planned to hire. Therefore, the unemployment rate will fall. If actual in-
flation is lower than expected inflation, actual real wages will be higher than expected, 
many firms will hire fewer workers than they had planned to hire, and the unemploy-
ment rate will rise. Table 28.2 summarizes this argument.
Friedman and Phelps concluded that an increase in the inflation rate increases em-
ployment (and decreases unemployment) only if the increase in the inflation rate is unex-
pected. Friedman argued that in 1968, the unemployment rate was 3.6 percent rather 
than 5 percent only because the inflation rate of 4 percent was above the 1 percent to 
2 percent inflation that workers and firms had expected: “There is always a temporary 
trade-off between inflation and unemployment; there is no permanent trade-off. The 
temporary trade-off comes not from inflation per se, but from unanticipated inflation.”

Do Workers Understand Inflation?
A higher inflation rate can lead to lower unemployment if both 
workers and firms mistakenly expect the inflation rate to be 
lower than it turns out to be. But this same result might be due 
to firms forecasting inflation more accurately than workers do or to firms understanding 
better the effects of inflation. Some large firms employ economists to help them gather 
and analyze information that is useful in forecasting inflation. Many firms also have hu-
man resources or employee compensation departments that gather 
data on wages paid at competing firms and analyze trends in com-
pensation. Workers generally rely on much less systematic infor-
mation about wages and prices. Workers also often fail to realize 
a fact we discussed in Chapter 20: Expected inflation increases the 
value of total production and the value of total income by the same 
amount. Therefore, although not all wages will rise as prices rise, 
inflation will increase the average wage in the economy at the same 
time that it increases the average price.
Robert Shiller, an economist at Yale University, conducted a 
survey on inflation and discovered that, although most econo-
mists believe an increase in inflation will lead quickly to an in-
crease in wages, a majority of the general public thinks otherwise. 
As part of the survey, Shiller asked how “the effect of general 
inflation on wages or salary relates to your own experience and 
your own job.” The most popular response was: “The price increase will create extra 
profits for my employer, who can now sell output for more; there will be no effect on my 
pay. My employer will see no reason to raise my pay.”
Shiller also asked the following question:
Imagine that next year the inflation rate unexpectedly doubles. How long would 
it probably take, in these times, before your income is increased enough so that 
you can afford the same things as you do today? In other words, how long will it 
be before a full inflation correction in your income has taken place?

The Short-Run and Long-Run Phillips Curves 
957
The Short-Run and Long-Run Phillips Curves
If there is both a short-run Phillips curve and a long-run Phillips curve, how are the 
two curves related? We can begin answering this question with the help of Figure 28.4, 
which represents macroeconomic conditions in the United States during the 1960s. In 
the late 1960s, workers and firms were still expecting the inflation rate to be about 1.5 
percent, as it had been from 1960 to 1965. Expansionary monetary and fiscal policies, 
however, had moved the short-run equilibrium up the short-run Phillips curve to an 
inflation rate of 4.5 percent and an unemployment rate of 3.5 percent. This very low 
unemployment rate was possible only because the real wage rate was unexpectedly low.
Once workers and firms began to expect that the inflation rate would continue to be 
about 4.5 percent, they changed their behavior. Firms knew that only nominal wage in-
creases of more than 4.5 percent would increase real wages. Workers realized that unless 
they received a nominal wage increase of at least 4.5 percent, their real wage would be fall-
ing. Higher expected inflation rates had an effect throughout the economy. For example, 
as we saw in Chapter 25, when banks make loans, they are interested in the real interest 
rate on the loan. The real interest rate is the nominal interest rate minus the expected 
inflation rate. If banks need to receive a real interest rate of 3 percent on home mortgage 
loans and expect the inflation rate to be 1.5 percent, they will charge a nominal interest 
rate of 4.5 percent. If banks revise their expectations of the inflation rate to 4.5 percent, 
they will increase the nominal interest rate they charge on mortgage loans to 7.5 percent.
28.2 LEARNING OBJECTIVE
Explain the relationship 
between the short-run and 
long-run Phillips curves.
Eighty-one percent of the public answered either that it would take several years for the 
purchasing power of their income to be restored or that it would never be restored.
If workers fail to understand that rising inflation leads over time to comparable in-
creases in wages, then when inflation increases, in the short run, firms can increase 
wages by less than inflation without needing to worry about workers quitting or their 
morale falling. Once again, we have a higher inflation rate, leading in the short run to 
lower real wages and lower unemployment. In other words, we have an explanation for a 
downward-sloping short-run Phillips curve.

C H A P T E R  2 8  Inflation, Unemployment, and Federal Reserve Policy  
Shifts in the Short-Run Phillips Curve
The new, higher expected inflation rate can become embedded in the economy, mean-
ing that workers, firms, consumers, and the government all take the inflation rate into 
account when making decisions. The short-run trade-off between unemployment and 
inflation now takes place from this higher, less favorable level, as shown in Figure 28.5.
As long as workers and firms expected the inflation rate to be 1.5 percent, the short-
run trade-off between unemployment and inflation was the more favorable one shown 
by the lower Phillips curve. Along this Phillips curve, an inflation rate of 4.5 percent was 
enough to drive down the unemployment rate to 3.5 percent. Once workers and firms 
adjusted their expectations to an inflation rate of 4.5 percent, the short-run trade-off de-
teriorated to the one shown by the higher Phillips curve. At this higher expected infla-
tion rate, the real wage rose, causing some workers to lose their jobs, and the economy’s 
equilibrium returned to the natural rate of unemployment of 5 percent—but now with 
an inflation rate of 4.5 percent rather than 1.5 percent. On the higher short-run Phillips 
curve, an inflation rate of 7.5 percent would be necessary to reduce the unemployment 
rate to 3.5 percent. An inflation rate of 7.5 percent would keep the unemployment rate 
at 3.5 percent only until workers and firms revised their expectations of inflation up to 
7.5 percent. In the long run, the economy’s equilibrium would return to the 5 percent 
natural rate of unemployment.
As Figure 28.6 shows, there is a short-run Phillips curve for every level of expected 
inflation. Each short-run Phillips curve intersects the long-run Phillips curve at the ex-
pected inflation rate.
How Does a Vertical Long-Run Phillips Curve Affect 
Monetary Policy?
By the 1970s, most economists accepted the argument that the long-run Phillips curve 
is vertical. In other words, economists realized that the common view of the 1960s had 
been wrong: It was not possible to buy a permanently lower unemployment rate at the 
cost of a permanently higher inflation rate. The moral is that in the long run, there is no 
trade-off between unemployment and inflation. In the long run, the unemployment rate 
always returns to the natural rate, no matter what the inflation rate is.
Figure 28.7 shows that the inflation rate is stable only when the unemployment rate 
is equal to the natural rate. If the Federal Reserve were to attempt to use expansionary 
Figure 28.5

By the end of the 1960s, workers and firms 
had revised their expectations of infla-
tion from 1.5 percent to 4.5 percent. As a 
result, the short-run Phillips curve shifted 
up, which made the short-run trade-off be-
tween unemployment and inflation worse.

monetary policy to push the economy to a point such as A, where the unemployment 
rate is below the natural rate, the result would be increasing inflation as the economy 
moved up the short-run Phillips curve. If the economy remained below the natural rate 
long enough, the short-run Phillips curve would shift up as workers and firms adjusted 
to the new, higher inflation rate. During the 1960s and 1970s, the short-run Phillips 
curve did shift up, presenting the economy with a more unfavorable short-run trade-off 
between unemployment and inflation.
If the Federal Reserve used contractionary policy to push the economy to a point 
such as B, where the unemployment rate is above the natural rate, the inflation rate 
would decrease. If the economy remained above the natural rate long enough, the 
short-run Phillips curve would shift down as workers and firms adjusted to the new, 
lower inflation rate. Only at a point such as C, where the unemployment rate is equal

the inflation rate increases, and, eventually,

to the natural rate, will the inflation rate be stable. As a result, the natural rate of un-
employment is sometimes called the nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment 
(NAIRU). We can conclude that in the long run, the Federal Reserve can affect the infla-
tion rate but not the unemployment rate.

Does the Natural Rate of 
Unemployment Ever Change?
Life would be easier for the Federal Reserve if it knew ex-
actly what the natural rate of unemployment was and if that 
rate never changed. Unfortunately for the Fed, the natural rate does change over time. 
Remember that at the natural rate of unemployment, only frictional and structural 
unemployment remain. Frictional or structural unemployment can change—thereby 
changing the natural rate—for several reasons:
• 
Demographic changes. Younger and less skilled workers have higher unemploy-
ment rates, on average, than do older and more skilled workers. Because of the baby 
boom, the United States had an unusually large number of younger and less skilled 
workers during the 1970s and 1980s. As a result, the natural rate of unemployment 
rose from about 5 percent in the 1960s to about 6 percent in the 1970s and 1980s. 
As the number of younger and less skilled workers declined as a fraction of the la-
bor force during the 1990s, the natural rate returned to about 5 percent.
• 
Labor market institutions. As we discussed in Chapter 20, labor market institutions 
such as the unemployment insurance system, unions, and legal barriers to firing work-
ers can increase the economy’s unemployment rate. Because many European coun-
tries have generous unemployment insurance systems, strong unions, and restrictive 
policies on firing workers, the natural rate of unemployment in most European coun-
tries has been well above the rate in the United States. In 2011, some economists be-
lieved that many workers in the United States had become less mobile because of the 
bursting of the housing bubble. These economists argued that because workers either 
were unable to sell their homes or were unwilling to do so because they did not want 
to sell for a low price, they were less likely to move from a geographic area of high 
unemployment to one of lower unemployment. Economists at JPMorgan Chase es-
timated that this lack of mobility might have increased the natural rate of unemploy-
ment to about 6 percent. Economists at the Congressional Budget Office disagreed, 
estimating that the natural rate had increased only from 5.0 percent to 5.2 percent.

Past high rates of unemployment. Evidence indicates that if high unemployment 
persists for a period of years, the natural rate of unemployment may increase. When 
workers have been unemployed for longer than a year or two, their skills deteriorate, 
they may lose confidence that they can find and hold a job, and they may become 
dependent on government payments to survive. Robert Gordon, an economist at 
Northwestern University, has argued that in the late 1930s, so many U.S. workers 
had been out of work for so long that the natural rate of unemployment may have 
risen to more than 15 percent. He has pointed out that even though the unemploy-
ment rate in the United States was 17 percent in 1939, the inflation rate did not 
change. Similarly, many economists have argued that the high unemployment rates 
experienced by European countries during the 1970s increased their natural rates of 
unemployment. As high rates of unemployment persisted more than two and a half 
years after the end of the 2007–2009 recession, some economists and policymakers 
were concerned that natural rate of unemployment might eventually rise.

and unemployment rates.” What does McCallum mean by 
a “long-run and exploitable Phillips-type tradeoff”? How 
would the Fed have attempted to exploit this long-run trade-
off? What would be the consequences for the inflation rate?
Solving the Problem
Step 1: Review the chapter material. This problem is about the relationship between 
the short-run and long-run Phillips curves, so you may want to review the 
section “The Short-Run and Long-Run Phillips Curves,” which begins on 
page 957.
Step 2: Explain what a “long-run exploitable Phillips-type tradeoff” means. A 
“long-run exploitable Phillips-type tradeoff” means a Phillips curve that 
in the long run is downward sloping rather than vertical. An “exploitable” 
trade-off is one that the Fed could take advantage of to permanently reduce 
unemployment, at the expense of higher inflation, or to permanently reduce 
inflation, at the expense of higher unemployment.
Step 3: Explain how the inflation rate will accelerate if the Fed tries to exploit a 
long-run trade-off between unemployment and inflation. As we have seen, 
during the 1960s, the Fed conducted expansionary monetary policies to move 
up what it thought was a stationary short-run Phillips curve. By the late 1960s, 
these policies resulted in very low unemployment rates. In the long run, there 
is no stable trade-off between unemployment and inflation. Attempting to 
permanently keep the unemployment rate at very low levels leads to a rising 
inflation rate, which is what happened in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

Changing Views of the Phillips Curve
Writing in a Federal Reserve publication, Bennett McCallum,  
an economist at Carnegie Mellon University, argues that 
during the 1970s, the Fed was “acting under the influence 
of 1960s academic ideas that posited the existence of a long-
run and exploitable Phillips-type tradeoff between inflation 
Expectations of the Inflation Rate 
and Monetary Policy
How long can the economy remain at a point that is on the short-run Phillips curve but 
not on the long-run Phillips curve? It depends on how quickly workers and firms adjust 
their expectations of future inflation to changes in current inflation. The experience in 
the United States over the past 60 years indicates that how workers and firms adjust 
their expectations of inflation depends on how high the inflation rate is. There are three 
possibilities:
• 
Low inflation. When the inflation rate is low, as it was during most of the 1950s, the 
early 1960s, the 1990s, and the 2000s, workers and firms tend to ignore it. For ex-
ample, if the inflation rate is low, a restaurant may not want to pay for printing new 
menus that would show slightly higher prices.
• 
Moderate but stable inflation. For the four-year period from 1968 to 1971, the in-
flation rate in the United States stayed in the narrow range between 4 percent and

5 percent. This rate was high enough that workers and firms could not ignore it 
without seeing their real wages and profits decline. It was also likely that the next 
year’s inflation rate would be very close to the current year’s inflation rate. In fact, 
workers and firms during the 1960s acted as if they expected changes in the infla-
tion rate during one year to continue into the following year. People are said to have 
adaptive expectations of inflation if they assume that future rates of inflation will 
follow the pattern of rates of inflation in the recent past.
• 
High and unstable inflation. Inflation rates above 5 percent during peacetime have 
been rare in U.S. history, but the inflation rate was above 5 percent every year from 
1973 through 1982. Not only was the inflation rate high during these years, it was 
also unstable—rising from 6 percent in 1973 to 11 percent in 1974, before falling 
below 6 percent in 1976 and rising again to 13.5 percent in 1980. In the mid-1970s, 
Nobel Laureates Robert Lucas of the University of Chicago and Thomas Sargent of 
New York University argued that the gains to accurately forecasting inflation had 
dramatically increased. Workers and firms that failed to correctly anticipate the 
fluctuations in inflation during these years could experience substantial declines in 
real wages and profits. Therefore, Lucas and Sargent argued, people should use all 
available information when forming their expectations of future inflation. Expec-
tations formed by using all available information about an economic variable are 
called rational expectations.
The Effect of Rational Expectations  
on Monetary Policy
Lucas and Sargent pointed out an important consequence of rational expectations: An 
expansionary monetary policy would not work. In other words, there might not be 
a trade-off between unemployment and inflation, even in the short run. By the mid-
1970s, most economists had accepted the idea that an expansionary monetary policy 
could cause the actual inflation rate to be higher than the expected inflation rate. This 
gap between actual and expected inflation would cause the actual real wage to fall below 
the expected real wage, and the unemployment rate would be pushed below the natural 
rate. The economy’s short-run equilibrium would move up the short-run Phillips curve.
Lucas and Sargent argued that this explanation of the Phillips curve assumed that 
workers and firms either ignored inflation or used adaptive expectations in making 
their forecasts of inflation. If workers and firms have rational expectations, they will use 
all available information, including knowledge of the effects of Federal Reserve policy. If 
workers and firms know that an expansionary monetary policy will raise the inflation 
rate, they should use this information in their forecasts of inflation. If they do, an expan-
sionary monetary policy will not cause the actual inflation rate to be above the expected 
inflation rate. Instead, the actual inflation rate will equal the expected inflation rate, the 
actual real wage will equal the expected real wage, and the unemployment rate will not 
fall below the natural rate.
Figure 28.8 illustrates this argument. Suppose the economy begins at point A, where 
the short-run Phillips curve intersects the long-run Phillips curve. The actual and ex-
pected inflation rates are both equal to 1.5 percent, and the unemployment rate equals 
the natural rate of 5 percent. Then suppose the Fed engages in an expansionary mon-
etary policy. If workers ignore inflation or if they form their expectations adaptively, the 
expansionary monetary policy will cause the actual inflation rate to be higher than the 
expected inflation rate, and the short-run equilibrium will move from point A on the 
short-run Phillips curve to point B. The inflation rate will rise to 4.5 percent, and the 
unemployment rate will fall to 3.5 percent. The decline in unemployment will be only 
temporary, however. Eventually, workers and firms will adjust to the fact that the actual 
inflation rate is 4.5 percent, not the 1.5 percent they had expected. The short-run Phil-
lips curve will shift up, and the unemployment rate will return to 5 percent at point C.
Lucas and Sargent argued that if workers and firms have rational expectations, 
they will realize that the Fed’s expansionary policy will result in an inflation rate of

formed by using all available 
information about an economic 
variable.

 
Expectations of the Inflation Rate and Monetary Policy

4.5 percent. Therefore, as soon as the Fed announces its new policy, workers and firms 
should adjust their expectations of inflation from 1.5 percent to 4.5 percent. There will 
be no temporary decrease in the real wage, leading to a temporary increase in employ-
ment and real GDP. Instead, the short-run equilibrium will move immediately from 
point A to point C on the long-run Phillips curve. The unemployment rate will never 
drop below 5 percent, and the short-run Phillips curve will be vertical.
Is the Short-Run Phillips Curve Really Vertical?
The claim by Lucas and Sargent that the short-run Phillips curve is vertical and that 
an expansionary monetary policy cannot reduce the unemployment rate below the 
natural rate surprised many economists. An obvious objection to the argument of 
Lucas and Sargent was that the record of the 1950s and 1960s seemed to show that 
there was a short-run trade-off between unemployment and inflation and that, there-
fore, the short-run Phillips curve was downward sloping and not vertical. Lucas and 
Sargent argued that the apparent short-run trade-off was actually the result of un-
expected changes in monetary policy. During those years, the Fed did not announce 
changes in policy, so workers, firms, and financial markets had to guess when the Fed 
had begun using a new policy. In that case, an expansionary monetary policy might 
cause the unemployment rate to fall because workers and firms would be taken by 
surprise, and their expectations of inflation would be too low. Lucas and Sargent 
argued that a policy that was announced ahead of time would not cause a change in 
unemployment.
Many economists have remained skeptical of the argument that the short-run 
 Phillips curve is vertical. The two main objections raised are that (1) workers and firms 
actually may not have rational expectations, and (2) the rapid adjustment of wages and 
prices needed for the short-run Phillips curve to be vertical will not actually take place. 
Many economists doubt that people are able to use information on the Fed’s monetary 
policy to make reliable forecasts of the inflation rate. If workers and firms do not know 
what effect an expansionary monetary policy will have on the inflation rate, the actual 
real wage may still end up being lower than the expected real wage. Also, firms may 
have contracts with their workers and suppliers that keep wages and prices from ad-
justing quickly. If wages and prices adjust slowly, then even if workers and firms have 
rational expectations, an expansionary monetary policy may still be able to reduce the 
unemployment rate in the short run.

fall. If workers and firms have rational ex-
pectations, an expansionary monetary 
policy will cause the short-run equilibrium 
to move up the long-run Phillips curve from 
point A to point C. Inflation will still rise, but 
there will be no change in unemployment.

Real Business Cycle Models
During the 1980s, some economists, including Nobel Laureates Finn Kydland of 
 Carnegie Mellon University and Edward Prescott of Arizona State University, argued 
that Robert Lucas was correct in assuming that workers and firms formed their expec-
tations rationally and that wages and prices adjust quickly but that Lucas was wrong in 
assuming that fluctuations in real GDP are caused by unexpected changes in the money 
supply. Instead, Kydland and Prescott argued that fluctuations in “real” factors, particu-
larly technology shocks, explain deviations of real GDP from its potential level. Technol-
ogy shocks are changes to the economy that make it possible to produce either more 
output—a positive shock—or less output—a negative shock—with the same number of 
workers, machines, and other inputs. Real GDP will be above its previous potential level 
following a positive technology shock and below its previous potential level following a 
negative technology shock. Because these models focus on real factors—rather than on 
changes in the money supply—to explain fluctuations in real GDP, they are known as 
real business cycle models.
The approach of Lucas and Sargent and the real business cycle models are some-
times grouped together under the label the new classical macroeconomics because these 
approaches share the assumptions that people have rational expectations and that wages 
and prices adjust rapidly. Some of the assumptions of the new classical macroeconomics 
are similar to those held by economists before the Great Depression of the 1930s. John 
Maynard Keynes, in his 1936 book The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and 
Money, referred to these earlier economists as “classical economists.” Like the classical 
economists, the new classical macroeconomists believe that the economy will normally 
be at its potential level.
Economists who find the assumptions of rational expectations and rapid adjust-
ment of wages and prices appealing are likely to accept the real business cycle model 
approach. Other economists are skeptical of these models because the models explain 
recessions as being caused by negative technology shocks. Negative technology shocks 
are uncommon and, apart from the oil price increases of the 1970s, real business cycle 
theorists have had difficulty identifying shocks that would have been large enough to 
cause recessions. Some economists have begun to develop real business cycle models 
that allow for the possibility that changes in the money supply may affect the level of 
real GDP. If real business cycle models continue to develop along these lines, they may 
eventually converge with the approaches the Fed uses.
Federal Reserve Policy from the 
1970s to the Present
We have already seen that the high inflation rates of the late 1960s and early 1970s were 
due in part to the Federal Reserve’s attempts to keep the unemployment rate below the 
natural rate. By the mid-1970s, the Fed also had to deal with the inflationary impact of 
the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) oil price increases. By 
the late 1970s, as the Fed attempted to deal with the problem of high and worsening 
inflation rates, it received conflicting policy advice. Many economists argued that the 
inflation rate could be reduced only at the cost of a temporary increase in the unem-
ployment rate. Followers of the Lucas–Sargent rational expectations approach, however, 
argued that a painless reduction in the inflation rate was possible. Before analyzing the 
actual policies used by the Fed, we can look at why the oil price increases of the mid-
1970s made the inflation rate worse.
The Effect of a Supply Shock on the Phillips Curve
As we saw in Chapter 24, the increases in oil prices in 1974 resulting from actions 
by OPEC caused the short-run aggregate supply curve to shift to the left. This shift 
is shown in panel (a) of Figure 28.9. (For simplicity, in this panel, we use the basic 
Real business cycle models Models 
that focus on real rather than 
monetary explanations of fluctuations 
in real GDP.

rather than dynamic AD–AS model.) The result was a higher price level and a lower 
level of real GDP. On a Phillips curve graph—panel (b) of Figure 28.9—we can shift 
the short-run Phillips curve up to show that the inflation rate and unemployment rate 
both increased.
As the Phillips curve shifted up, the economy moved from an unemployment 
rate of about 5 percent and an inflation rate of about 5.5 percent in 1973 to an unem-
ployment rate of 8.5 percent and an inflation rate of about 9.5 percent in 1975. This 
combination of rising unemployment and rising inflation placed the Federal Reserve 
in a difficult position. If the Fed used an expansionary monetary policy to fight the 
high unemployment rate, the AD curve would shift to the right, and the economy’s 
equilibrium would move up the short-run Phillips curve. Real GDP would increase, 
and the unemployment rate would fall—but at the cost of higher inflation. If the Fed 
used a contractionary monetary policy to fight the high inflation rate, the AD curve 
would shift to the left, and the economy’s equilibrium would move down the short-
run Phillips curve. As a result, real GDP would fall, and the inflation rate would be 
reduced—but at the cost of higher unemployment. In the end, the Fed chose to fight 
high unemployment with an expansionary monetary policy, even though that decision 
worsened the inflation rate.
Paul Volcker and Disinflation
By the late 1970s, the Federal Reserve had gone through a two-decade period of con-
tinually increasing the rate of growth of the money supply. In August 1979, President 
Jimmy Carter appointed Paul Volcker as chairman of the Board of Governors of the 
Federal Reserve System. Along with most other economists, Volcker was convinced that 
high inflation rates were damaging the economy. To reduce inflation, Volcker began 
reducing the annual growth rate of the money supply. This contractionary monetary 
policy raised interest rates, causing a  decline in aggregate demand. Figure 28.10 uses the

GDP declined from $4,917 billion to $4,880 billion, and the price level rose from 
28.1 to 33.6. Panel (b) shows that the supply shock shifted up the Phillips curve. 
In 1973, the U.S. economy had an inflation rate of about 5.5 percent and an un-
employment rate of about 5 percent. By 1975, the inflation rate had risen to about 
9.5 percent and the unemployment rate to about 8.5 percent.

Phillips curve model to analyze the movements in unemployment and inflation from 
1979 to 1989.
The Fed’s contractionary monetary policy shifted the economy’s short-run equilib-
rium down the short-run Phillips curve, lowering the inflation rate from 11 percent in 
1979 to 6 percent in 1982—but at a cost of raising the unemployment rate from 6 per-
cent to 10 percent. As workers and firms lowered their expectations of future inflation, 
the short-run Phillips curve shifted down, improving the short-run trade-off between 
unemployment and inflation. This adjustment in expectations allowed the Fed to switch 
to an expansionary monetary policy. By 1987, the economy was back to the natural rate 
of unemployment, which during these years was about 6 percent. The orange line in 
Figure 28.10 shows the actual combinations of unemployment and inflation for each 
year from 1979 to 1989.
Under Volcker’s leadership, the Fed had reduced the inflation rate from more 
than 10 percent to less than 5 percent. The inflation rate has generally remained below 
5  percent ever since. A significant reduction in the inflation rate is called disinflation. 
In fact, this episode is often referred to as the “Volcker disinflation.” The disinflation 
had come at a very high price, however. From September 1982 through June 1983, the 
unemployment rate was above 10 percent, the first time this had happened since the end 
of the Great Depression of the 1930s.
Some economists argue that the Volcker disinflation provided evidence against 
the view that workers and firms have rational expectations. Volcker’s announcement 
in October 1979 that he planned to use a contractionary monetary policy to bring 
down the inflation rate was widely publicized. If workers and firms had rational ex-
pectations, we might have expected them to have quickly reduced their expectations 
of future inflation. The economy should have moved smoothly down the long-run 
Phillips curve. As we have seen, however, the economy moved down the existing 
short-run Phillips curve, and only after several years of high unemployment did the 
Phillips curve shift down. Apparently, workers and firms had adaptive expectations—
only changing their expectations of future inflation after the current inflation rate had 
fallen.
Robert Lucas and Thomas Sargent argue, however, that a less painful disinflation 
would have occurred if workers and firms had believed Volcker’s announcement that he 
was fighting inflation. The problem was that previous Fed chairmen had made similar 
promises throughout the 1970s, but inflation had continued to get worse. By 1979, the

the growth of the money supply, thereby

the inflation rate had fallen to 6 percent. 
As workers and firms lowered their expec-
tations of future inflation, the short-run 
Phillips curve shifted down, improving the 
short-run trade-off between unemployment 
and inflation. This adjustment in expecta-
tions allowed the Fed to switch to an ex-
pansionary monetary policy, which by 1987 
brought the economy back to the natural 
rate of unemployment, with an inflation rate 
of about 4 percent. The orange line shows 
the actual combinations of unemployment 
and inflation for each year from 1979 to

be about 6 percent.

credibility of the Fed was at a low point. Some support for Lucas’s and Sargent’s argu-
ment comes from surveys of business economists at the time, which showed that they 
also reduced their forecasts of future inflation only slowly, even though they were well 
aware of Volcker’s announcement of a new policy.
Don’t Confuse Disinflation with Deflation
Disinflation refers to a decline in the inflation rate. Defla-
tion refers to a decline in the price level. Paul Volcker and the 
Federal Reserve brought about a substantial disinflation in 
the United States during the years between 1979 and 1983. 
The inflation rate fell from over 11 percent in 1979 to below 
5 percent in 1984. Yet even in 1984, there was no  deflation: 
The price level was still rising—but at a slower rate.
The last period of significant deflation in the United 
States was in the early 1930s, during the Great Depression. 
The following table shows the consumer price index for 
each of those years.
Because the price level fell each year from 1929 to 
1933, there was deflation.

Solving the Problem
Step 1: Review the chapter material. This problem is about using a Phillips curve 
graph to show how the Fed can fight inflation, so you may want to review the 
section “Paul Volcker and Disinflation,” which begins on page 965.
Step 2: Explain how the Fed can use monetary policy to reduce the inflation rate. 
To reduce the inflation rate significantly, the Fed will have to raise the target 
for the federal funds rate. Higher interest rates will reduce aggregate demand, 
raise unemployment, and move the economy’s equilibrium down the short-
run Phillips curve.
Step 3: Illustrate your argument with a Phillips curve graph. How much the un-
employment rate would have to rise to drive down the inflation rate from 
6  percent to 2 percent depends on the steepness of the short-run Phillips curve.

Using Monetary Policy  
to Lower the Inflation Rate
Consider the following hypothetical situation: The economy 
is currently at the natural rate of unemployment of 5 per-
cent. The actual inflation rate is 6 percent, and, because it 
has remained at 6 percent for several years, this is also the 
rate that workers and firms expect to see in the future. The 
Federal Reserve decides to reduce the inflation rate perma-
nently to 2 percent. How can the Fed use monetary policy to 
achieve this objective? Be sure to use a Phillips curve graph 
in your answer.

Once the short-run Phillips curve has shifted down, the Fed can use an 
expansionary monetary policy to push the economy back to the natural rate 
of unemployment. This policy is similar to the one carried out by the Fed after 
Paul Volcker became chairman in 1979. The downside to these policies of dis-
inflation is that they lead to significant increases in unemployment.
Extra Credit: A follower of the new classical macroeconomics approach would have a 
more optimistic view of the consequences of using monetary policy to lower the infla-
tion rate from 6 percent to 2 percent. According to this approach, the Fed’s policy an-
nouncement should cause people to immediately revise downward their expectations 
of future inflation from 6 percent to 2 percent. The economy’s short-run equilibrium

low. Table 28.3 shows that the average annual inflation rate was lower during  Greenspan’s 
term and Bernanke’s term through late 2011 than it had been during the terms of their 
three most immediate predecessors. Under Greenspan’s leadership of the Fed, inflation 
was reduced nearly to the low levels experienced during the term of Chairman William 
McChesney Martin in the 1950s and 1960s. Greenspan’s term was marked by only two 
short and mild recessions, in 1990–1991 and 2001. When Greenspan left office in 2006, 
he was widely applauded by economists, policymakers, and the media.
But with the severity of the 2007–2009 recession, some critics questioned whether 
decisions made by the Fed under Greenspan’s leadership might have played a role in 
bringing on the crisis. We will discuss those arguments after briefly reviewing two other 
developments in monetary policy during the past 20 years:
• 
Deemphasizing the money supply. Greenspan’s term was notable for the Fed’s 
continued movement away from using the money supply as a monetary policy 
target. We saw in Chapter 25 that during the 1980s and 1990s, the close relation-
ship between growth in the money supply and inflation broke down. Before 1987, 
the Fed would announce annual targets for how much M1 and M2 would increase 
during the year. In February 1987, near the end of Paul Volcker’s term, the Fed 
 announced that it would no longer set targets for M1. In July 1993, Alan Greenspan 
announced that the Fed also would no longer set targets for M2. Instead, the Fed-
eral Open Market Committee (FOMC) has relied on setting targets for the federal 
funds rate to meet its goals of price stability and high employment.
• 
The importance of Fed credibility. The Fed learned an important lesson during 
the 1970s: Workers, firms, and investors in stock and bond markets have to view 
Fed announcements as credible if monetary policy is to be effective. As inflation 
would move directly down the long-run Phillips curve from an inflation rate of 6 per-
cent to an inflation rate of 2 percent, while keeping the unemployment rate constant at 
5 percent. For the reasons discussed in this chapter, many economists are skeptical that 
disinflation can be brought about so painlessly.

C H A P T E R  2 8  Inflation, Unemployment, and Federal Reserve Policy  
worsened throughout the late 1960s and the 1970s, the Fed announced repeatedly 
that it would take actions to reduce inflation. In fact, policies were either not im-
plemented or were ineffective, and inflation rose. These repeated failures to follow 
through on announced policies had greatly reduced the Fed’s credibility by the time 
Paul Volcker took office in August 1979. The contractionary monetary policy that 
the Fed announced in October 1979 had less effect on the expectations of workers, 
firms, and investors than it would have had if the Fed’s credibility had been greater. 
It took a severe recession to convince people that this time, the inflation rate really 
was coming down. Only then were workers willing to accept lower nominal wage 
increases, banks willing to accept lower interest rates on mortgage loans, and inves-
tors willing to accept lower interest rates on bonds.
Over the past two decades, the Fed has taken steps to enhance its credibility. 
Most importantly, whenever a change in Fed policy has been announced, the change 
has actually taken place. In addition, Greenspan revised the previous Fed policy of 
keeping secret the target for the federal funds rate. Since February 1994, any change 
in the target rate has been announced at the conclusion of the FOMC meeting at 
which the change is made. In addition, the minutes of the FOMC meetings are now 
made public after a brief delay. In February 2000, the Fed helped make its intentions 
for future policy clearer by announcing at the end of each FOMC meeting whether 
it considered the economy in the future to be at greater risk of higher inflation or 
of recession. In 2011, Ben Bernanke held a press conference following an FOMC 
meeting, which was the first time a Fed chair had done so.
The Decision to Intervene in the Failure of Long-Term Capital Manage-
ment Greenspan’s ability to help guide the economy through a long period of economic 
stability and his moves to enhance Fed credibility were widely applauded. However, two 
actions by the Fed during Greenspan’s term have been identified as possibly contribut-
ing to the financial crisis that increased the length and severity of the 2007–2009 reces-
sion. One was the decision during 1998 to help save the hedge fund Long-Term Capital 
Management (LTCM). Hedge funds raise money, typically from wealthy investors, and 
use sophisticated investment strategies that often involve significant risk. Hedge funds 
generally rely heavily on borrowing in order to leverage their investments, thereby in-
creasing potential returns. LTCM included as partners Robert Merton and Myron Scho-
les, who had both been awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics.
In the spring of 1998, LTCM suffered heavy losses on several of its investments, 
partly because the Russian government announced it would no longer make payments 
on some of its bonds, causing their value to plummet. Other financial firms that had 
loaned money to LTCM feared that the hedge fund would go bankrupt and began 
to push for repayment of their loans. We saw in Chapter 25 that a run on a financial 
firm can cause widespread problems in the financial system. If LTCM had been forced 
to quickly sell all of its investments, the prices of the securities it owned would have 
declined, causing problems for other financial firms that held the same securities. 
The Fed was concerned that a sudden failure of LTCM might lead to failures of other 
 financial firms. With the support of Alan Greenspan, William McDonough, presi-
dent of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, held a meeting between the manage-
ment of LTCM and the other financial firms to which LTCM owed money. The other 
firms were persuaded to give LTCM enough time to slowly sell off—or “unwind”—its 
investments to keep the prices of those investments from falling too rapidly and to 
avoid a financial panic.
The Fed’s actions succeeded in avoiding wider damage from LTCM’s failure, but 
some critics argued that the Fed’s intervention had negative consequences in the long 
run because it allowed the owners of LTCM and the firms that had loaned LTCM 
money to avoid the full consequences of LTCM’s failed investments. These critics 
argued that the Fed’s intervention set the stage for other firms—particularly highly 
leveraged investment banks and hedge funds—to take on excessive risk, with the ex-
pectation that the Fed would intervene on their behalf should they suffer heavy losses 
on the investments.

 
Federal Reserve Policy from the 1970s to the Present  
971
Although some critics see the Fed’s actions in the case of LTCM as encouraging 
the excessive risk taking that helped result in the financial crisis of 2007–2009, other 
observers doubt that the behavior of managers of financial firms were much affected by 
the Fed’s actions.
The Decision to Keep the Target for the Federal Funds Rate at 1 Percent 
from June 2003 to June 2004 In response to the popping of the dot-com stock 
bubble in the spring of 2000, the beginning of a recession in March 2001, and the terror-
ist attacks of September 11, 2001, the Fed successively lowered the target for the federal 
funds rate. The target rate was cut in a series of steps from 6.5 percent in May 2000 to 1 
percent in June 2003. The target remained at 1 percent until it was raised to 1.25 percent 
in June 2004. The Fed’s decision to continue cutting the target for the federal funds rate 
for more than 18 months after the end of the recession in November 2001 and to keep 
the rate at 1 percent for another year has been criticized. At the time, the FOMC argued 
that although the recession of 2001 was mild, the very low inflation rates of late 2001 
and 2002 raised the possibility that the U.S. economy could slip into a period of defla-
tion. As we discussed in Chapter 26, deflation can damage the economy by raising real 
interest rates and by causing consumers to postpone purchases, based on the expecta-
tion that future prices will be lower than current prices.
Critics argued, though, that by keeping interest rates low for an extended period, the 
Fed helped to fuel the housing bubble that eventually deflated beginning in 2006, with 
disastrous results for the economy. We have seen that the origins of the housing bubble 
are complex and that contributing factors included the increase in securitization of mort-
gages, the willingness of banks and other lenders to give loans to subprime and Alt-A 
borrowers, and the widespread use of adjustable-rate mortgages that allowed borrowers 
to qualify for larger loans than would have been possible using conventional mortgages. 
Economists will continue to debate whether the Fed’s policy of keeping the target for the 
federal funds rate very low for an extended period caused the housing bubble.
Has the Fed Lost Its Independence?
The financial crisis of 2007–2009 led the Fed to move well beyond the federal funds 
rate as the focus of monetary policy. With the target federal funds rate having been 
driven to zero without much expansionary effect on the economy, some observers be-
gan to speak of a “crisis in monetary policy.” We reviewed the Fed’s new policy initia-
tives in Chapters 25 and 26. Like other policies that represent a sharp break with the 
past, the Fed’s actions had both supporters and critics. At this point, we can review the 
debate over whether the Fed’s policy actions reduced its independence. The Fed worked 
closely with the Treasury Department in arranging to inject funds into the commer-
cial banking system by taking partial ownership of some banks and in several other 
policy  actions. Typically, the chairman of the Fed has formulated policy independently 
of the secretary of the Treasury, who is a political appointee and can be replaced at any 
time by the president of the United States. Close collaboration between the Fed and 
the Treasury, were it to continue, raises the question of whether the Fed will be able to 
pursue policies independent from those of the administration in power. In addition, 
by 2011, the Fed’s extensive interventions in the financial system had led members of 
Congress to  scrutinize—and in many cases, criticize—Fed policy to an unusual degree. 
Some  observers worried that this intense congressional oversight might limit the Fed’s 
 freedom of action in the future.
The main reason to keep the Fed—or any country’s central bank—independent of 
the rest of the government is to avoid inflation. Whenever a government is spending 
more than it is collecting in taxes, it must borrow the difference by selling bonds. The 
governments of many developing countries have difficulty finding anyone other than 
their central bank to buy their bonds. The more bonds the central bank buys, the faster 
the money supply grows, and the higher the inflation rate will be. Even in developed 
countries, governments that control their central banks may be tempted to sell bonds to 
the central bank rather than to the public.

972 
C H A P T E R  2 8  Inflation, Unemployment, and Federal Reserve Policy  
Another fear is that if the government controls the central bank, it may use that 
control to further its political interests. It is difficult in any democratic country for a 
government to be reelected at a time of high unemployment. If the government controls 
the central bank, it may be tempted just before an election to increase the money supply 
and drive down interest rates to increase production and employment. In the United 
States, for example, a president who had direct control over the Fed might be tempted to 
increase the money supply just before running for reelection, even if doing so led in the 
long run to higher inflation and accompanying economic costs.
We might expect that the more independent a country’s central bank is, the lower 
the inflation rate in the country and the less independent a country’s central bank, the 
higher the inflation rate. In a classic study, Alberto Alesina and Lawrence Summers, 
who were both at the time economists at Harvard University, tested this idea by compar-
ing the degree of central bank independence and the inflation rate for 16 high-income 
countries during the years 1955–1988. Figure 28.11 shows the results.
Countries with highly independent central banks, such as the United States, Swit-
zerland, and Germany, had lower inflation rates than countries whose central banks had 
little independence, such as New Zealand, Italy, and Spain. In the past few years, New 
Zealand and Canada have granted their banks more independence, at least partly to bet-
ter fight inflation.
Whether the changes in the Fed’s policies and procedures during and after the 
2007–2009 recession will have lasting effects on its independence remains to be seen.
Figure 28.11 
The More Independent  
the Central Bank, the Lower  
the Inflation Rate
For 16 high-income countries, the greater the 
degree of central bank independence from 
the rest of the government, the lower the in-
flation rate. Central bank independence is 
measured by an index ranging from 1 (mini-
mum independence) to 4  (maximum inde-
pendence). During these years, Germany had 
a high index of independence of 4 and a low 
average inflation rate of just over 3 percent. 
New Zealand had a low index of indepen-
dence of 1 and a high average inflation rate of 
over 7 percent.

Conclusion
The workings of the contemporary economy are complex. The attempts by the Federal 
Reserve to keep the U.S. economy near the natural rate of unemployment with a low rate 
of inflation have not always been successful. Economists continue to debate the best way 
for the Fed to proceed.
An Inside Look at Policy on the next page discusses the challenges the Federal Re-
serve faces in trying to reduce unemployment without increasing inflation.

Economics in Your Life
Is It Wise to Delay a Job Search?
At the beginning of the chapter, we posed this question: What advice would you give someone 
who has decided to wait nearly two years to look for a new job? As we discussed in the chapter, 
evidence shows that many of those who are unemployed for longer than a year or two find it 
more difficult to find new employment than if they searched for a new job soon after they were 
laid off. The longer workers are unemployed, especially in a high-technology field, the more their 
skills deteriorate. By delaying her job search, your friend risks being unemployed for longer than 
two years. Eventually, she may have to be retrained or take additional courses in a different field 
in order to find a job. Tell your friend to start her job search right away!

the statistics began being kept in 1948; 
the only other annual decline occurred 
in 2003 and was a scant 0.25 percent.
 The Fed is attacked from both the 
left (for doing too little to create jobs) 
and the right (for doing too much 
and tempting inflation), notes for-
mer Fed vice chairman Donald Kohn. 
 Bernanke aims for a middle course. 
One argument for a less secretive Fed 
is this: Investors, managers and work-
ers who better understand the Fed’s 
goals won’t futilely try to defy them. 
The Fed’s very commitment to low in-
flation will restrain wages and prices. 
Up to a point, this may be true. But 
public relations alone won’t control 
behavior. Actions outrank intentions.
The lesson of the 1970s’ great 
inflation (13 percent in 1980) is that 
once prices begin to rise consistently, 
they feed on themselves. The fallout 
is disastrous. People and companies 
can’t plan for the future; recessions 
become more frequent. Unexpectedly 
high inflation would probably doom 
today’s cheap credit policy. The Fed 
would have to raise rates. Criticism 
from both left and right would inten-
sify. So, much is riding on Bernanke’s 
bet: If he loses, we all lose.

But there’s a growing debate 
about whether all the pump-priming 
is helping recovery or simply foster-
ing inflation. The economy’s fate may 
hang on who’s right. Studies by Fed 
economists are, not surprisingly, sup-
portive. One estimated that QE1 and 
QE2 lowered long-term interest rates 
by about 0.5 percentage points and 
saved nearly 3 million jobs; the jobless 
rate otherwise could have approached 
11 percent. Many private economists 
are less impressed; they suspect the 
benefits of QE1 faded with QE2. . . .
 Meanwhile, inflation creeps up. 
Over the past year, the consumer price 
index rose 2.7 percent; six months ear-
lier, the year-over-year gain was only 
1.2 percent. Bernanke blames higher oil 
and food prices, reflecting temporary 
factors (the war in Libya, poor harvests) 
that may be reversed. The danger of an 
inflationary wage-price spiral, goes this 
argument, is negligible because unem-
ployment is high and pay is stagnant.
Maybe. But inflation’s dynam-
ics might be changing. Here’s why. The 
 recession caused enormous factory and 
business closures; now, there’s less capac-
ity to meet rising demand. Companies 
have more power to raise prices; a depre-
ciating dollar compounds the effect by 
making imports more expensive. . . .
The problem might become more 
widespread. The Fed regularly mea-
sures manufacturers’ production ca-
pacity. From 2007 to 2010, it fell 5.4 
percent. That’s the largest drop since 
Ben Bernanke’s Bet 
on Jobs and Inflation
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben 
 Bernanke glided smoothly through 
his first regular news conference the 
other day—an event both remarkable 
and unremarkable. It was remark-
able for symbolizing the Fed’s ongo-
ing transformation from a citadel of 
secrecy into an agency that tries to 
explain itself to the public. “The origi-
nal attitude . . . was that it was no one’s 
business what they did—and if you 
wanted to figure it out, do so yourself,” 
says economist Allan Meltzer, author 
of a history of the Fed. Until now, 
there had been no news conferences, a 
legacy of the tight-lipped past.
 What was unremarkable is that 
reporters’ questions focused on an 
old issue: How much can the Fed re-
duce unemployment without stoking 
inflation? Bernanke’s bet is: a lot. He’s 
embraced super-easy credit to cut the 
appalling 8.8 percent jobless rate; that’s 
13.5 million people, nearly half out of 
work for six months or more. Since 
late 2008, the Fed has held short-term 
interest rates near zero. To cut long-
term rates, the Fed is buying gobs of 
Treasury bonds and mortgage securi-
ties: $1.725 trillion from late 2008 to 
March 2010; an additional $600 billion 
from last November through June. 
These purchases are known as QE1 
and QE2, for “quantitative easing.”

Phillips curve relationship is less clear, as 
the unemployment rate remained between 
9 and 10 percent, while the inflation rate 
rose from 22.10 percent to 3.63 percent. 
The article states that the dynamics of infla-
tion may be changing and prices may rise 
due to reduced capacity coupled with in-
creasing demand. As you learned in this 
chapter, if a higher inflation rate becomes 
expected in the economy, the short-run 
Phillips curve will shift up, and the short-run 
trade-off between unemployment and infla-
tion will take place at a higher inflation rate. 
In the figure, the data from July 2010 to July 
2011 could be indicating that workers and 
firms are expecting the inflation rate to 
increase.
c Some critics argue that the Fed has not 
done enough to create jobs and others 
claim that the Fed’s actions will generate in-
flation. However, Bernanke is sticking with 
the policy decisions he believes will boost 
employment while keeping inflation under 
control. By announcing these policies and 
moving forward with them, the Fed main-
tains its credibility and therefore has a bet-
ter chance of meeting its goals.
Thinking Critically 
about Policy
1. Suppose that the unemployment rate 
in mid-2011 was the same as it actually 
was, but the inflation rate during those 
months averaged 10 percent rather than 
the rate shown in the figure. What effect 
might the higher inflation rates have had 
on the Fed’s monetary policy?
2. Suppose the unemployment rate is cur-
rently equal to the nonaccelerating infla-
tion rate of unemployment (NAIRU) of 5 
percent, and the inflation rate is 0 per-
cent. If the Fed wants to raise the infla-
tion rate permanently to 2 percent, what 
should it do? Explain your answer using 
a Phillips curve graph.
Analyzing the News
a Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke argues 
that Fed policies that have reduced 
both short-term and long-term interest 
rates will be successful in lowering the high 
unemployment rate while keeping inflation 
in check. But some economists are con-
vinced that monetary policy actions are do-
ing less to improve the job situation and 
more to generate inflation. As you read in 
this chapter, A. W. Phillips discovered an in-
verse short-run relationship between the 
unemployment rate and the inflation rate. 
The figure below shows the short-run Phil-
lips curve relationship from July 2008 
through July 2011. For the months from 
July 2008 to July 2009, the Phillips curve 
relationship appears to fit the data well, as 
the unemployment rate rose from 5.8 per-
cent to 9.5 percent while the inflation rate, 
measured by the percent change of the 
consumer price index, fell from 5.6 percent 
to 22.10 percent.
b The figure below also shows that from 
July 2009 to July 2011, the short-run 
Key Points in the Article
In an effort to reduce the unemployment 
rate and increase real GDP, the Fed held 
its target for the federal funds rate close 
to zero for three years beginning in late 
2008. The Fed also successfully lowered 
long-term interest rates with its quantita-
tive easing programs. While Fed econo-
mists argue that the Fed’s policies helped 
save nearly 3 million jobs, some econo-
mists are concerned that these policies 
did more to increase inflation than to as-
sist the recovery. From mid-2010 to mid-
2011, the consumer price index rose 2.7 
percent, with the largest increase coming 
in the last six months. Some observers 
criticized Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke 
for not doing enough to lower unemploy-
ment, while others criticized him for do-
ing too much and fanning the flames of 
inflation. Bernanke argues, however, that 
the Fed’s recent policy actions will help 
reduce the unemployment rate with-
out causing a significant increase in the 
 inflation rate.

Problems and Applications
 
1.5 In October 2011, Christina Romer, former chair of the 
Council of Economic Advisers, noted that, “Today, infla-
tion is still low, but unemployment is stuck at a painfully 
high level.” Why might we normally expect that inflation 
will be low when unemployment is high? What economic 
concept is used to represent this relationship between un-
employment and inflation?

Summary
The Phillips curve illustrates the short-run trade-off between 
the unemployment rate and the inflation rate. The inverse re-
lationship between unemployment and inflation shown by the 
Phillips curve is consistent with the aggregate demand and ag-
gregate supply analysis developed in Chapter 24. The aggregate 
demand and aggregate supply (AD–AS) model indicates that 
slow growth in aggregate demand leads to both higher unem-
ployment and lower inflation, and rapid growth in aggregate de-
mand leads to both lower unemployment and higher inflation. 
This relationship explains why there is a short-run trade-off be-
tween unemployment and inflation. Many economists initially 
believed that the Phillips curve was a structural relationship 
that depended on the basic behavior of consumers and firms and 
that remained unchanged over time. If the Phillips curve were a 
stable relationship, it would present policymakers with a menu of 
combinations of unemployment and inflation from which they 
could choose. Nobel Laureate Milton Friedman argued that there 
is a natural rate of unemployment, which is the unemployment 
rate that exists when the economy is at potential GDP and to 
which the economy always returns. As a result, there is no trade-
off between unemployment and inflation in the long run, and 
the long-run Phillips curve is a vertical line at the natural rate of 
unemployment.

 Robert Shiller asked a sample of the general public and 
a sample of economists the following question: “Do you 
agree that preventing high inflation is an important na-
tional priority, as important as preventing drug abuse or 
preventing deterioration in the quality of our schools?” 
Fifty-two percent of the general public, but only 18 percent 
of economists, fully agreed. Why does the general public 
believe inflation is a bigger problem than economists do?
 1.13 [Related to the Making the Connection on page 956] 
When Shiller asked a sample of the general public what 
they thought caused inflation, the most frequent answer he 
received was “greed.” Do you agree that greed causes infla-
tion? Briefly explain.
 1.14 [Related to the Chapter Opener on page 951] Why 
might a firm such as CarMax, which we discussed in the 
chapter opener, pay more attention than firms in, say, the 
restaurant or clothing industries, to the Federal Reserve 
raising or lowering interest rates? In other words, why 
are movements in interest rates particularly important to 
CarMax?

1.9 In macroeconomics courses in the 1960s and early 1970s, 
some economists argued that one of the U.S. political par-

achieve lower inflation and that the other major politi-
cal party was willing to have higher inflation in order to 
achieve lower unemployment. Why might such views of 
Summary
There is a short-run trade-off between unemployment and infla-
tion only if the actual inflation rate differs from the inflation rate 
that workers and firms had expected. There is a different short-
run Phillips curve for every expected inflation rate. Each short-
run Phillips curve intersects the long-run Phillips curve at the 
expected inflation rate. With a vertical long-run Phillips curve, 
it is not possible to buy a permanently lower unemployment rate 
at the cost of a permanently higher inflation rate. If the Federal 
Reserve attempts to keep the economy below the natural rate of 
unemployment, the inflation rate will increase. Eventually, the 
expected inflation rate will also increase, which causes the short-
run Phillips curve to shift up and pushes the economy back to the 
natural rate of unemployment. The reverse happens if the Fed at-
tempts to keep the economy above the natural rate of unemploy-
ment. In the long run, the Federal Reserve can affect the inflation 
rate but not the unemployment rate.

2.5 In 1968, Herbert Stein, who would later serve on President 
Nixon’s Council of Economic Advisers, wrote, “Some who 
would opt for avoiding inflation would say that in the long 
run such a policy would cost little, if any, additional un-
employment.” Was Stein correct? Did most economists in 
1968 agree with him? Briefly explain.

 University of Chicago Press, 1969), p. 382.
 
2.6 [Related to Solved Problem 28.2 on page 961] In a 
speech in September 1975, then Fed Chairman Arthur 
Burns said the following:
There is no longer a meaningful trade-off be-
tween unemployment and inflation. In the 
current environment, a rapidly rising level of 
consumer prices will not lead to the creation 
of new jobs. . . . Highly expansionary mone-
tary and fiscal policies might, for a short time, 
provide some additional thrust to economic 
activity. But inflation would inevitably accel-
erate—a development that would create even 
more difficult economic problems than we 
have encountered over the past year.
 
 How do Burns’s views in this speech compare with the 
views at the Fed in the late 1960s? Why do you think he 
specifically says that “in the current environment” there is 
no trade-off between unemployment and inflation?

ment,” in Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Federal Reserve Readings

2.7 In testifying before Congress, former Federal Reserve 
Chairman Alan Greenspan remarked, “The challenge of 
monetary policy is to interpret data on the economy and 
financial markets with an eye to anticipating future infla-
tionary forces and to countering them by taking action in 
advance.” Why should the Fed take action in anticipation 
of inflation becoming worse? Why not just wait until the 
increase in the inflation rate has occurred?

Rules for Monetary Policy,” in John B. Taylor, ed., Monetary Policy 
Rules, (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1999), p. 157.
 
2.8 In Congressional testimony, Federal Reserve Chairman 
Ben Bernanke said:
Another significant factor influencing 
 medium-term trends in inflation is the public’s 
expectations of inflation. These expectations 
have an important bearing on whether transi-
tory influences on prices, such as changes in 
energy costs, become embedded in wage and 
price decisions and so leave a lasting imprint 
on the rate of inflation.
 
 What did Bernanke mean when he said that the public’s 
expectations of inflation could “become embedded in 
wage and price decisions”? What would be the effect on 
the short-run Phillips curve of the public coming to expect 
a higher inflation rate?

nomic Committee, U.S. Congress,” March 28, 2007.
 
2.9 [Related to the Making the Connection on page 960] 
In 2011, an article in the Economist magazine argued that 
the natural rate of unemployment in the United States may 
have risen as high as 7.5 percent. The article suggested 
that:
Lowering this new natural rate of unemploy-
ment will require structural reforms, such as 
changing education to ensure that people enter 
work equipped with the sort of skills firms are 
willing to fight over, adjusting the tax system 
and modernising the welfare safety net, and 
more broadly creating a climate conducive to 
entrepreneurship and innovation.
 
 Why should policymakers be concerned with lowering the 
natural rate of unemployment? How would the “structural 
reforms” listed in the article contribute to lowering the 
natural rate of unemployment? Would the Fed be able to 
implement any of these reforms? Briefly explain.

 2.10 [Related to the Making the Connection on page 960] 
An article in a publication of the Federal Reserve Bank of 
San Francisco described the natural rate of unemployment 
in 2011:
Recent labor market developments, including 
mismatches in the skills of workers and jobs, 
extended unemployment benefits, and very 
high rates of long-term joblessness, may be im-
peding the return to “normal” unemployment 
rates of around 5%. An examination of alter-
native measures of labor market conditions 
suggests that the “normal” unemployment 
rate may have risen as much as 1.7 percentage 
points to about 6.7%, although much of this 
increase is likely to prove temporary.
 
a. Explain why each of the factors mentioned—mis-
matches in the skills of workers and jobs, extended 
unemployment benefits, and very high rates of long-
term joblessness—might increase the natural rate of 
unemployment.
 
b. Draw short-run and long-run Phillips curves that illus-
trate the effects of the natural rate of unemployment in-
creasing from 5.0 percent to 6.7 percent. Briefly explain

ing labor market slack.

 28.3 
LEARNING OBJECTIVE: Discuss how expectations of the inflation rate affect monetary policy.
Summary
When the inflation rate is moderate and stable, workers and firms 
tend to have adaptive expectations. That is, they form their expec-
tations under the assumption that future inflation rates will follow 
the pattern of inflation rates in the recent past. During the high 
and unstable inflation rates of the mid- to late 1970s, Robert Lucas 
and Thomas Sargent argued that workers and firms would have 
rational expectations. Rational expectations are formed by using 
all the available information about an economic variable, includ-
ing the effect of the policy being used by the Federal Reserve. Lu-
cas and Sargent argued that if people have rational expectations, 
expansionary monetary policy will not work. If workers and firms 
know that an expansionary monetary policy is going to raise the 
inflation rate, the actual inflation rate will be the same as the ex-
pected inflation rate. Therefore, the unemployment rate won’t fall. 
Many economists remain skeptical of Lucas and Sargent’s argu-
ment in its strictest form. Real business cycle models focus on 
“real” factors—technology shocks—rather than changes in the 
money supply to explain fluctuations in real GDP.

Review Questions
 
3.1 Why do workers, firms, banks, and investors in financial 
markets care about the future rate of inflation? How do 
they form their expectations of future inflation? Do cur-
rent conditions in the economy have any bearing on how 
they form their expectations?
 
3.2 What does it mean to say that workers and firms have ra-
tional expectations?
 
3.3 Why did Robert Lucas and Thomas Sargent argue that the 
Phillips curve might be vertical in the short run? What dif-
ference would it make for monetary policy if they were right?
Problems and Applications
 
3.4 During a time when the inflation rate is increasing each 
year for a number of years, are adaptive expectations or 
rational expectations likely to give the more accurate fore-
casts? Briefly explain.
 
3.5 An article in the Economist magazine contains the fol-
lowing: “Robert Lucas . . . showed how incorporating 
expectations into macroeconomic models muddled the 
framework economists prior to the ‘rational expectations 
revolution’ thought they saw so clearly.” What economic 
framework did economists change as the result of Lucas’s 
arguments? Do all economists agree with Lucas’s main 
conclusions about the effectiveness of monetary policy? 
Briefly explain.
From “How to Know What Causes What,” Economist, October 10, 
2011.
 
3.6 Would a monetary policy intended to bring about disinfla-
tion cause a greater increase in unemployment if workers 
and firms have adaptive expectations or if they have ratio-
nal expectations? Briefly explain.
 
3.7 If both the short-run and long-run Phillips curves are ver-
tical, what will be the effect on the inflation rate and the 
unemployment rate of an expansionary monetary policy? 
Use a Phillips curve graph to illustrate your answer.
 
3.8 An article in the Wall Street Journal contains the following 
about the views of William Poole, who was then the presi-
dent of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis:
Mr. Poole said both inflation expectations and 
the output gap—the spare room the economy 
has between what it’s producing and what it 
could potentially produce—go into the infla-
tion process. But “inflation expectations . . . 
trump the gap. If inflation expectations were to 
rise, that development by itself would tend to 
drag the inflation rate up . . . and it might take 
a very long time before the (output gap) would 
be able to offset what’s going on with inflation 
expectations.”
 
a. Use the short-run and long-run Phillips curves to 
 explain what Poole meant in saying that both infla-
tion expectations and the output gap affect the current 
 inflation rate.
 
b. In terms of Phillips curve analysis, what are the impli-
cations of Poole’s claim that “it might take a very long 
time before the (output gap) would be able to offset 
what’s going on with inflation expectations”?
 
c. Why might inflation expectations be slow to respond to 
the output gap?

Summary
Inflation worsened through the 1970s. Paul Volcker became Fed 
chairman in 1979, and, under his leadership, the Fed used contrac-
tionary monetary policy to reduce inflation. A significant reduc-
tion in the inflation rate is called disinflation. This contractionary 
monetary policy pushed the economy down the short-run Phillips 
curve. As workers and firms lowered their expectations of future 
inflation, the short-run Phillips curve shifted down, improving 
the short-run trade-off between unemployment and inflation. 
This change in expectations allowed the Fed to switch to an ex-
pansionary monetary policy to bring the economy back to the 
Federal Reserve Policy from the 1970s to the Present, pages 964–972

natural rate of unemployment. During Alan Greenspan’s term as 
Fed chairman, inflation remained low, and the credibility of the 
Fed increased. In recent years, some economists have argued that 
monetary policy decisions during Greenspan’s term may have 
contributed to the problems the financial system experienced dur-
ing the 2007–2009 recession. Some economists and policymakers 
fear that actions taken by the Fed during the 2007–2009 recession 
may have reduced its independence.

Review Questions
 
4.1 What was the “Volcker disinflation”? What happened to 
the unemployment rate during the period of the Volcker 
disinflation?
 
4.2 Why is the credibility of the Fed’s policy announcements 
particularly important?
 
4.3 Why do most economists believe that it is important for a 
country’s central bank to be independent of the rest of the 
country’s central government?
Problems and Applications
 
4.4 According to an article in BusinessWeek, many workers 
who retired in the year 2000 expected to live off the inter-
est they would receive from bank certificates of deposit or 
money market mutual funds. “Then came disinflation—
and a steep fall in interest rates.” What is disinflation, and 
why should it lead to a fall in interest rates?
From Peter Coy, “The Surprise Threat to Nest Eggs,” BusinessWeek, 
July 28, 2003.
 
4.5 [Related to the Don’t Let This Happen to You on page 967] 
Look again at the table on prices during the early 1930s 
on page 967. Was there disinflation during 1933? Briefly 
explain.
 
4.6 Suppose the current inflation rate and the expected infla-
tion rate are both 4 percent. The current unemployment 
rate and the natural rate of unemployment are both 5 per-
cent. Use a Phillips curve graph to show the effect on the 
economy of a severe supply shock. If the Federal Reserve 
keeps monetary policy unchanged, what will happen even-
tually to the unemployment rate? Show this on your Phil-
lips curve graph.
 
4.7 [Related to Solved Problem 28.4 on page 967] Suppose 
the inflation rate has been 15 percent for the past four 
years. The unemployment rate is currently at the natural 
rate of unemployment of 5 percent. The Federal Reserve 
decides that it wants to permanently reduce the inflation 
rate to 5 percent. How can the Fed use monetary policy to 
achieve this objective? Be sure to use a Phillips curve graph 
in your answer.
 
4.8 [Related to Solved Problem 28.4 on page 967] In 
1995, some economists argued that the natural rate of 
unemployment was 6 percent. Then Fed Chairman Alan 
Greenspan was convinced that the natural rate was actually 
about 5 percent. If Greenspan had accepted the view that 
the natural rate was 6 percent, how might monetary policy 
have been different during the late 1990s?
 
4.9 During the recession of 2007–2009, some economists were 
concerned that the U.S. economy might begin experienc-
ing deflation. An article in the Federal Reserve Bank of San 
Francisco’s Economic Letter stated: “A popular version of 
the well-known Phillips curve model of inflation predicts 
that we are on the cusp of a deflationary spiral in which 
prices will fall at ever increasing rates over the next several 
years.”
 
a. How might a deflationary spiral occur in the Phillips 
curve model?
 
b. Why do you think that a deflationary spiral did not ac-
tually occur during or after the recession of 2007–2009?
From John C. Williams, “The Risk of Deflation,” FRBSF Economic 
 Letter, March 27, 2009.
 4.10 According to an article in the Wall Street Journal, 
“J.P.  Morgan Chase economist Michael Feroli finds that in 
the past two decades it has taken a far larger drop in the 
jobless rate to boost inflation by one percentage point than 
it did in the previous 25 years.” If this economist is correct, 
has the short-run Phillips curve become steeper during the 
past 25 years or less steep? If true, would this fact have any 
implications for monetary policy? Briefly explain.
From Greg Ip, “Fed Sees Inflation Rise as Fleeting,” Wall Street 
 Journal, August 4, 2006.
 4.11 Robert Lucas has been quoted as saying: “In practice, it is 
much more painful to put a modern economy through a 
deflation than the monetary theory we have would lead 
us to expect. I take this to mean that we have ‘price sticki-
ness.’” What does Lucas mean by “the monetary theory we 
have”? What events may have led Lucas to conclude that 
it is more painful to reduce the inflation rate than theory 
would predict? Why does he conclude that the U.S. econ-
omy apparently has “price stickiness”?
From Paul A. Samuelson and William A. Barnett, eds., Inside Econo-
mist’s Mind: Conversations with Eminent Economists, (Malden, MA: 
Blackwell Publishing, 2007).
 4.12 During the 2012 presidential election campaign, Texas 
Governor Rick Perry criticized the actions of Fed Chair 
Ben Bernanke. Perry argued that, “Printing more money 
to play politics at this particular time in American his-
tory is almost . . . treasonous in my opinion.” An article 
in the Wall Street Journal commented that despite Perry’s 
remarks, “. . . Bernanke is willing to embrace the political 
independence embedded in his role to do what Fed of-
ficials think the economy needs.” How is “political inde-
pendence” embedded in the role of Fed chair? Why did 
Congress initially decide to make the Fed independent of 
the rest of the federal government?

litical Risks Facing the Fed,” Wall Street Journal, August 16, 2011.

Economics in Your Life
The South Korean Central Bank and Your Car Loan
Suppose that you are shopping for a new car, which you plan to finance with a loan from a local 
bank. One morning, as you head out the door to visit another automobile dealership, you hear the 
following newsflash on the radio: “The Bank of Korea, South Korea’s central bank, announces it 
will sell its large holdings of U.S. Treasury bonds.” What effect will the Bank of Korea’s decision to 
sell its U.S. Treasury bonds likely have on the interest rate you pay on your car loan? As you read this 
chapter, see if you can answer this question. You can check your answer against the one we provide 
on page 1003 at the end of this chapter.
in exchange for other currencies. In some 
years, converting revenue from  foreign 
 currencies yields more dollars than in 
other years. For example, in August 2011, 
global revenues for McDonald’s increased 
by 11.3 percent from the previous year 
when measured in local currency—pounds 
in Great Britain, euros in France, yen in 
 Japan. But when measured in terms of dol-
lars, the company’s revenues rose by only  
5.4  percent. Why the discrepancy? The 
value of the dollar had increased relative 
to most other currencies. So, converting 
pounds, euros, and yen into dollars yielded 
fewer dollars for McDonald’s.
What explains fluctuations in the 
 exchange rate between the dollar and other 
currencies? In this chapter and the next, 
we will look more closely at how exchange 
rates are determined and at other important 
 issues involving the international finan-
cial system. Read AN INSIDE LOOK on 
page 1004 for a discussion of the effects of a 
 decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar rela-
tive to other currencies.
Based on Dimitra Defotis, “McDonald’s Shares Hit New 
High; Sales Strong in EU,” Barron’s, July 22, 2011; and 
 McDonald’s, “Financial Press Release,” September 9, 2011.
The McDonald’s Big Mac is one of the most 
widely available products in the world. 
 McDonald’s has 32,000 outlets in 118 coun-
tries, serving 60 million customers per day. 
The company’s stock was one of only two 
in the Dow Jones Industrial Average to 
post a gain in 2008, which was a bad year 
for most U.S. firms. During the recession of 
2007–2009, McDonald’s prospered as many 
consumers switched to eating out at fast-
food restaurants rather than at restaurants 
that provide table service. The success of 
McDonald’s continued into 2010, with the 
company’s stock price increasing 22.5 per-
cent, more than double the 11 percent gain 
in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
With expansion in the U.S. market 
limited, McDonald’s has grown in recent 
years mostly by expanding in foreign mar-
kets. About 34 percent of its sales come 
from the United States; 40 percent from 
Europe; 20 percent from the Middle East, 
Asia, and  Africa; and about 6 percent 
from Canada and Latin America. Because 
 McDonald’s has restaurants in so many 
different  countries, it receives revenue in 
many  different  currencies. As a result, the 
company’s  revenue and profits are affected 
by fluctuations in the value of the dollar

C H A P T E R  2 9  Macroeconomics in an Open Economy 
I
n Chapter 8, we looked at the basics of international trade. In this chapter, we look 
more closely at the linkages among countries at the macroeconomic level. Countries 
are linked by trade in goods and services and by flows of financial investment. We 
will see how policymakers in all countries take these linkages into account when 
 conducting monetary policy and fiscal policy.
The Balance of Payments: 
Linking the United States  
to the International Economy
Today, consumers, firms, and investors routinely interact with consumers, firms, and 
investors in other economies. A consumer in France may use computer software pro-
duced in the United States, watch a television made in South Korea, and wear a sweater 
made in Italy. A firm in the United States may sell its products in dozens of countries 
around the world. An investor in London may sell a U.S. Treasury bill to an investor in 
Mexico City. Nearly all economies are open economies and have extensive interactions 
in trade or finance with other countries. Open economies interact by trading goods and 
services and by making investments in each other’s economies. A closed economy has 
no interactions in trade or finance with other countries. No economy today is com-
pletely closed, although a few countries, such as North Korea, have very limited eco-
nomic interactions with other countries.
A good way to understand the interactions between one economy and other econo-
mies is through the balance of payments, which is a record of a country’s trade with 
other countries in goods, services, and assets. Just as the U.S. Bureau of Economic Anal-
ysis is responsible for collecting data on the GDP, it is also responsible for collecting data 
on the balance of payments. Table 29.1 shows the balance of payments for the United 
States in 2010. Notice that the table contains three “accounts”: the current account, the 
financial account, and the capital account.
The Current Account
The current account records current, or short-term, flows of funds into and out of a 
country. The current account for the United States includes exports and imports of 
goods and services (recall from Chapter 19 that the difference between exports and im-
ports of goods and services is called net exports); income received by U.S. residents from 
investments in other countries; income paid on investments in the United States owned 
by residents of other countries (the difference between investment income received and 
investment income paid is called net income on investments); and the difference between 
transfers made to residents of other countries and transfers received by U.S. residents 
from other countries (called net transfers). If you make a donation to a charity caring for 
orphans in Afghanistan, it would be included in net transfers. Any payments received by 
U.S. residents are positive numbers in the current account, and any payments made  
by U.S. residents are negative numbers in the current account.
The Balance of Trade Part of the current account is the balance of trade, which 
is the difference between the value of the goods a country exports and the value of the 
goods a country imports. The balance of trade is the largest item in the current account 
and is often a topic that politicians and the media discuss. If a country exports more 
goods than it imports, it has a trade surplus. If a country exports less than it imports, it 
has a trade deficit. In 2010, the United States had a trade deficit of $646 billion. In the 
same year, Japan had a trade surplus of $76 billion, and China had a trade surplus of 
$183 billion. Figure 29.1 shows imports and exports of goods between the United States 
and its trading partners and between Japan and its trading partners. The data show that 
the United States ran a trade deficit in 2010 with all its major trading partners and with 
every region of the world except for Latin America. Japan ran trade deficits with China,

international trade statistics are not measured exactly.)
Net Exports Equals the Sum of the Balance of Trade and the Balance of 
Services In previous chapters, we saw that net exports is a component of aggregate 
expenditures. Net exports is not explicitly shown in Table 29.1, but we can calculate it by 
adding together the balance of trade and the balance of services. The balance of services 
is the difference between the value of the services a country exports and the value of the 
services a country imports. Notice that, technically, net exports is not equal to the cur-
rent account balance because this account also includes net income on investments and 
net transfers. But these other two items are relatively small, so, as we will see later in this 
chapter, it is often a convenient simplification to think of net exports as being equal to 
the current account balance.
The Financial Account
The financial account records purchases of assets a country has made abroad and for-
eign purchases of assets in the country. The financial account records long-term flows of 
funds into and out of a country. There is a capital outflow from the United States when 
an investor in the United States buys a bond issued by a foreign company or government 
or when a U.S. firm builds a factory in another country. There is a capital inflow into 
the United States when a foreign investor buys a bond issued by a U.S. firm or by the 
 government or when a foreign firm builds a factory in the United States. Notice that we

are using the word capital here to apply not just to physical assets, such as factories, but 
also to financial assets, such as shares of stock. When firms build or buy facilities in for-
eign countries, they are engaging in foreign direct investment. When investors buy stock 
or bonds issued in another country, they are engaging in foreign portfolio investment.
Another way of thinking of the balance on the financial account is as a measure of 
net capital flows, or the difference between capital inflows and capital outflows. (Here 
we are omitting a few transactions included in the capital account, as discussed in the 
next section.) A concept closely related to net capital flows is net foreign investment, 
which is equal to capital outflows minus capital inflows. Net capital flows and net for-
eign investment are always equal but have opposite signs: When net capital flows are 
positive, net foreign investment is negative, and when net capital flows are negative, net 
foreign investment is positive. Net foreign investment is also equal to net foreign direct 
investment plus net foreign portfolio investment. Later in this chapter, we will use the 
relationship between the balance on the financial account and net foreign investment to 
understand an important aspect of the international economic system.
The Capital Account
A third, less important, part of the balance of payments is called the capital account. 
The capital account records relatively minor transactions, such as migrants’  transfers—
which consist of goods and financial assets people take with them when they leave 
or enter a country—and sales and purchases of nonproduced, nonfinancial assets. A 
nonproduced, nonfinancial asset is a copyright, patent, trademark, or right to natural 
resources. The definitions of the financial account and the capital account are often 
misunderstood because the capital account prior to 1999 recorded all the transactions 
included now in both the financial account and the capital account. In other words, 
capital account transactions went from being a very important part of the balance of 
Net foreign investment The 
difference between capital outflows 
from a country and capital inflows, 
also equal to net foreign direct 
investment plus net foreign portfolio 
investment.

payments to being a relatively unimportant part. Because the balance on what is now 
called the capital account is so small—only $152 million in 2010—for simplicity we will 
ignore it in the remainder of this chapter.
Why Is the Balance of Payments Always Zero?
The sum of the current account balance, the financial account balance, and the capital 
account balance equals the balance of payments. Table 29.1 shows that the balance of 
payments for the United States in 2010 was zero. It’s not just by chance that this bal-
ance was zero; the balance of payments is always zero. Notice that the current account 
balance in 2010 was –$471 billion. The balance on the financial account (which has 
the opposite sign to the balance on the current account) was $254 billion. To make the 
balance on the current account equal the balance on the financial account, the balance 
of payments includes an entry called the statistical discrepancy. (Remember that we are 
ignoring the balance on the capital account. If we included it, we would say that the sta-
tistical discrepancy takes on a value equal to the difference between the current  account 
balance and the sum of the balance on the financial account and the balance on the 
capital account.)
Why does the U.S. Department of Commerce include the statistical discrepancy en-
try to force the balance of payments to equal zero? If the sum of the current account 
balance and the financial account balance does not equal zero, some imports or exports 
of goods and services or some capital inflows or capital outflows were not measured 
accurately.
To better understand why the balance of payments must equal zero every year, 
consider the following: In 2010, the United States spent $471 billion more on goods, 
services, and other items in the current account than it received. What happened to 
that $471 billion? We know that every dollar of that $471 billion was used by foreign 
individuals or firms to invest in the United States or was added to foreign holdings of 
dollars. We know this because logically there is nowhere else for the dollars to go: If the 
dollars weren’t spent on U.S. goods and services—and we know they weren’t because 
in that case they would have shown up in the current account—they must have been 
spent on investments in the United States or not spent at all. Dollars that aren’t spent are 
added to foreign holdings of dollars. Changes in foreign holdings of dollars are known 
Don’t Confuse the Balance of Trade,  
the Current Account Balance,  
and the Balance of Payments
The terminology of international economics can be tricky. 
Remember that the balance of trade includes only trade 
in goods; it does not include services. This observation is 
important because the United States, for example, usually 
imports more goods than it exports, but it usually exports 
more services than it imports. As a result, the U.S. trade 
deficit is almost always larger than the current account 
deficit. The current account balance includes the balance of 
trade, the balance of services, net investment income, and 
net transfers. Net investment income and net transfers are 
much smaller than the balance of trade and the balance of 
services.
Even though the balance of payments is equal to the sum 
of the current account balance and the financial  account 
balance—and must equal zero—you may sometimes see 
references to a balance of payments “surplus” or “deficit.” 
These references have two explanations. The first is that 
the person making the reference has confused the balance 
of payments with either the balance of trade or the current 
account balance. This is a very common mistake. The sec-
ond explanation is that the person is not including official 
reserve transactions in the financial account. If we separate 
changes in U.S. holdings of foreign currencies and changes 
in foreign holdings of U.S. dollars from other financial ac-
count entries, the current account balance and the financial 
account balance do not have to sum to zero, and there can 
be a balance of payments surplus or deficit. This may sound 
complicated—and it is! But don’t worry. How official reserve 
transactions are accounted for is not crucial to understand-
ing the basic ideas behind the balance of payments.

as official reserve transactions. Foreign investment in the United States and  additions to 
foreign holdings of dollars both show up as positive entries in the U.S. financial  account. 
Therefore, a current account deficit must be exactly offset by a financial  account 
 surplus, leaving the balance of payments equal to zero. Similarly, a country that runs 
a current account surplus, such as China or Japan, must run a financial account deficit 
of exactly the same size. If a country’s current account surplus is not exactly equal to its 
financial account deficit, or if a country’s current account deficit is not exactly equal to 
its financial account surplus, some transactions must not have been accounted for. The 
statistical discrepancy is included in the balance of payments to compensate for these 
uncounted transactions.
Solving the Problem
Step 1: Review the chapter material. This problem is about the relationship between the 
current account and the financial account, so you may want to review the section 
“Why Is the Balance of Payments Always Zero?” which begins on page 987.
Step 2: Explain the errors in the commentator’s argument. The argument sounds 
plausible. It would be easy to find statements similar to this one in recent 
books and articles by well-known political commentators. But the argument 
contains an important error: The commentator has failed to understand the 
relationship between the current account and the financial account. The com-
mentator asserts that developing countries are receiving large capital inflows 
from industrial countries. In other words, developing countries are running 
financial account surpluses. The commentator also asserts that developing 
countries are exporting more than they are importing. In other words, they 
are running current account surpluses. As we have seen in this section, it is 
impossible to run a current account surplus and a financial account surplus 
simultaneously. A country that runs a current account surplus must run a 
 financial account deficit and vice versa.
Extra Credit: Most emerging economies that have received large inflows of foreign in-
vestment during the past two decades, such as South Korea, Thailand, and Malaysia, have 
run current account deficits: They import more goods and services than they export. 
Emerging economies, such as Singapore, that run current account surpluses also run 
 financial account deficits: They invest more abroad than other countries invest in them.
The point here is not obvious; if the point was obvious, it wouldn’t confuse so many 
intelligent politicians, journalists, and political commentators. Unless you understand 
the relationship between the current account and the financial account, you won’t be 
able to understand a key aspect of the international economy.

more to the industrial countries than they import.

 
The Foreign Exchange Market and Exchange Rates  
989
The Foreign Exchange Market 
and Exchange Rates
A firm that operates entirely within the United States will price its products in dollars 
and will use dollars to pay its suppliers’ bills, wages and salaries to its workers, inter-
est to its bondholders, and dividends to its shareholders. A multinational corporation 
such as McDonald’s, in contrast, may sell its products in many different countries and 
receive payments in many different currencies. Its suppliers and workers may also be 
spread around the world and may have to be paid in local currencies. Corporations may 
also use the international financial system to borrow in a foreign currency. For example, 
during a period of rapid expansion in East Asian countries such as Thailand and South 
Korea during the late 1990s, many large firms received dollar loans from foreign banks. 
When firms make extensive use of foreign currencies, they must deal with fluctuations 
in the exchange rate.
The nominal exchange rate is the value of one country’s currency in terms of  another 
country’s currency. Economists also calculate the real exchange rate, which corrects the 
nominal exchange rate for changes in prices of goods and services. We discuss the real 
 exchange rate later in this chapter. The nominal exchange rate determines how many units 
of a foreign currency you can purchase with $1. For example, the exchange rate between 
the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen can be expressed as ¥ 100 = +1. (This  exchange 
rate can also be expressed as how many U.S. dollars are required to buy 1  Japanese yen: 
+0.01 = ¥ 1.) The market for foreign exchange is very active. Every day, the equivalent 
of more than $3 trillion worth of currency is traded in the foreign  exchange market. 
The e xchange rates that result from this trading are reported on a number of online sites 
 devoted to economic news and in the business or financial sections of most newspapers.
Banks and other financial institutions around the world employ currency traders, who 
are linked together by computer. Rather than exchange large amounts of paper currency, 
they buy and sell deposits in banks. A bank buying or selling dollars will actually be buying 
or selling dollar bank deposits. Dollar bank deposits exist not just in banks in the United 
States but also in banks around the world. Suppose that the Crédit Agricole bank in France 
wants to sell U.S. dollars and buy Japanese yen. The bank may exchange U.S. dollar deposits 
that it owns for Japanese yen deposits owned by the Deutsche Bank in Germany. Busi-
nesses and individuals usually obtain foreign currency from banks in their own country.

The market exchange rate is determined by the interaction of demand and  supply, 
just as other prices are. Let’s consider the demand for U.S. dollars in exchange for 
 Japanese yen. There are three sources of foreign currency demand for the U.S. dollar:
 1. Foreign firms and households that want to buy goods and services produced in the 
United States.
 2. Foreign firms and households that want to invest in the United States either through 
foreign direct investment—buying or building factories or other facilities in the 
United States—or through foreign portfolio investment—buying stocks and bonds 
issued in the United States.
 3. Currency traders who believe that the value of the dollar in the future will be greater 
than its value today.
Equilibrium in the Market for Foreign Exchange
Figure 29.2 shows the demand and supply of U.S. dollars for Japanese yen. Notice that as 
we move up the vertical axis in Figure 29.2, the value of the dollar increases relative to 
the value of the yen. When the exchange rate is ¥ 150 = +1, the dollar is worth 1.5 times 
as much relative to the yen as when the exchange rate is ¥ 100 = +1. Consider, first, 
the demand curve for dollars in exchange for yen. The demand curve has the normal 
downward slope. When the value of the dollar is high, the quantity of dollars demanded 
will be low. A Japanese investor will be more likely to buy a $1,000 bond issued by the 
U.S. Treasury when the exchange rate is ¥ 100 = +1 and the investor pays only ¥100,000 
foreign currency. So, the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the British pound 
can be stated as either 0.635 British pounds per U.S. dollar or 1>0.635 = 1.574 U.S. 
 dollars per British pound.
Banks are the most active participants in the market for foreign exchange. Typi-
cally, banks buy currency for slightly less than the amount for which they sell it. This 
spread between the buying and selling prices allows banks to cover their expenses from 
currency trading and to make a profit. Therefore, when most businesses and individu-
als buy foreign currency from a bank, they receive fewer units of foreign currency per 
dollar than would be indicated by the exchange rate shown on online business sites or 
printed in the newspaper.

to buy $1,000 than when the exchange rate is ¥ 150 = +1 and the investor must pay 
¥150,000. Similarly, a Japanese firm is more likely to buy $150 million worth of micro-
chips from Intel Corporation when the exchange rate is ¥ 100 = +1 and the microchips 
can be purchased for ¥15 billion than when the exchange rate is ¥ 150 = +1 and the 
microchips cost ¥22.5 billion.
Consider, now, the supply curve of dollars in exchange for yen. The supply curve 
has the normal upward slope. When the value of the dollar is high, the quantity of dol-
lars supplied in exchange for yen will be high. A U.S. investor will be more likely to 
buy a ¥200,000 bond issued by the Japanese government when the exchange rate is 
¥ 200 = +1 and he needs to pay only $1,000 to buy ¥200,000 than when the exchange 
rate is ¥ 100 = +1 and he must pay $2,000. The owner of a U.S. electronics store is more 
likely to buy ¥20 million worth of television sets from the Sony Corporation when the 
exchange rate is ¥ 200 = +1 and she only needs to pay $100,000 to purchase the televi-
sions than when the exchange rate is ¥ 100 = +1 and she must pay $200,000.
As in any other market, equilibrium occurs in the foreign exchange market where 
the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded. In Figure 29.2, ¥ 120 = +1 is the 
equilibrium exchange rate. At exchange rates above ¥ 120 = +1, there will be a surplus 
of dollars and downward pressure on the exchange rate. The surplus and the downward 
pressure will not be eliminated until the exchange rate falls to ¥ 120 = +1. If the exchange 
rate is below ¥ 120 = +1, there will be a shortage of dollars and upward pressure on the 
exchange rate. The shortage and the upward pressure will not be eliminated until the ex-
change rate rises to ¥ 120 = +1. Surpluses and shortages in the foreign exchange market 
are eliminated very quickly because the volume of trading in major currencies such as the 
dollar and the yen is very large, and currency traders are linked together by computer.
Currency appreciation occurs when the market value of a country’s currency in-
creases relative to the value of another country’s currency. Currency depreciation oc-
curs when the market value of a country’s currency decreases relative to the value of 
another country’s currency.
How Do Shifts in Demand and Supply  
Affect the Exchange Rate?
Shifts in the demand and supply curves cause the equilibrium exchange rate to change. 
Three main factors cause the demand and supply curves in the foreign exchange market 
to shift:
 1. Changes in the demand for U.S.-produced goods and services and changes in the 
demand for foreign-produced goods and services
 2. Changes in the desire to invest in the United States and changes in the desire to in-
vest in foreign countries
 3. Changes in the expectations of currency traders about the likely future value of the 
dollar and the likely future value of foreign currencies
Shifts in the Demand for Foreign Exchange Consider how the three factors 
listed above will affect the demand for U.S. dollars in exchange for Japanese yen. Dur-
ing an economic expansion in Japan, the incomes of Japanese households will rise, and 
the demand by Japanese consumers and firms for U.S. goods will increase. At any given 
exchange rate, the demand for U.S. dollars will increase, and the demand curve will shift 
to the right. Similarly, if interest rates in the United States rise, the  desirability of invest-
ing in U.S. financial assets will increase, and the demand curve for dollars will also shift 
to the right. Speculators are currency traders who buy and sell foreign exchange in an 
attempt to profit from changes in exchange rates. If a speculator becomes convinced that 
the value of the dollar is going to rise relative to the value of the yen, the speculator will 
sell yen and buy dollars. If the current exchange rate is ¥ 120 = +1, and the speculator 
is  convinced that it will soon rise to ¥ 140 = +1, the speculator could sell ¥600,000,000 
and receive +5,000,000 (= ¥ 600,000,000>¥ 120) in return. If the speculator is correct

and the value of the dollar rises against the yen to ¥ 140 = +1, the speculator will be 
able to exchange $5,000,000 for ¥ 700,000,000 (=+5,000,000 * ¥ 140), for a profit of 
¥100,000,000.
To summarize, the demand curve for dollars shifts to the right when incomes in 
Japan rise, when interest rates in the United States rise, or when speculators decide that 
the value of the dollar will rise relative to the value of the yen.
During a recession in Japan, Japanese incomes will fall, reducing the demand for 
U.S.-produced goods and services and shifting the demand curve for dollars to the left. 
Similarly, if interest rates in the United States fall, the desirability of investing in U.S. 
financial assets will decrease, and the demand curve for dollars will shift to the left. 
Finally, if speculators become convinced that the future value of the dollar will be lower 
than its current value, the demand for dollars will fall, and the demand curve will shift 
to the left.
Shifts in the Supply of Foreign Exchange The factors that affect the sup-
ply curve for dollars are similar to those that affect the demand curve for dollars. An 
 economic expansion in the United States increases the incomes of Americans and 
 increases their demand for goods and services, including goods and services made in 
Japan. As U.S. consumers and firms increase their spending on Japanese products, they 
must supply dollars in exchange for yen, which causes the supply curve for dollars to 
shift to the right. Similarly, an increase in interest rates in Japan will make financial 
 investments in Japan more attractive to U.S. investors. These higher Japanese interest 
rates will cause the supply of dollars to shift to the right, as U.S. investors exchange dol-
lars for yen.  Finally, if speculators become convinced that the future value of the yen will 
be higher relative to the dollar than it is today, the supply curve of dollars will shift to 
the right as traders attempt to exchange dollars for yen.
A recession in the United States will decrease the demand for Japanese products and 
cause the supply curve for dollars to shift to the left. Similarly, a decrease in interest rates 
in Japan will make financial investments in Japan less attractive and cause the  supply 
curve of dollars to shift to the left. If traders become convinced that the future value of 
the yen will be lower relative to the dollar, the supply curve will also shift to the left.
Adjustment to a New Equilibrium The factors that affect the demand and 
 supply for currencies are constantly changing. Whether the exchange rate increases or 
 decreases depends on the direction and size of the shifts in the demand curve and supply 
curve. For example, as Figure 29.3 shows, if the demand curve for dollars in  exchange 
for Japanese yen shifts to the right by more than the supply curve shifts, the equilibrium 
 exchange rate will increase.
Figure 29.3
Shifts in the Demand and 
Supply Curve Resulting in 
a Higher Exchange Rate
Holding other factors constant, an increase 
in the supply of dollars will decrease the 
equilibrium exchange rate. An increase 
in the demand for dollars will increase 
the equilibrium exchange rate. In the case 
shown in this figure, the demand curve and 
the supply curve have both shifted to the 
right. Because the demand curve has shifted 
to the right by more than the supply curve, 
the equilibrium exchange rate has increased 
from ¥120 to $1 at point A to ¥130 to $1 at 
point B.

What Explains the Fall and Rise  
and Fall of the Dollar?
An American vacationing in Paris during the spring of 2002 
could have bought a meal for €50 and paid the equivalent of 
$44 for it. In the summer of 2008, that same €50 meal would have cost the equivalent of 
$79. A few months later, in early 2009, it would have cost only $64. In the fall of 2011, it 
would have cost $69. Clearly, during these years, the value of the dollar in exchange for the 
euro was going through substantial fluctuations. And it wasn’t just against the euro that 
the dollar was losing value, then regaining some of it, and then losing it again. The graph 
below shows fluctuations for the period from 1990 to late 2011 in an index of the value 
of the dollar against an average of other major currencies, such as the euro, the British 
pound, the Canadian dollar, and the Japanese yen. The shaded areas indicate recessions.
The graph indicates that although the dollar gained value against other currencies 
for a brief period during late 2008 and early 2009, and again during mid-2010, overall it 
has lost value since 2002. What explains the decline in the value of the dollar? We have 
just seen that an increase in the demand by foreign investors for U.S. financial assets can 
increase the value of the dollar, and a decrease in the demand for U.S. financial assets 
can decrease the value of the dollar. The increase in the value of the dollar in the late 
1990s, as shown in the graph, was driven by strong demand from foreign investors for 
U.S. stocks and bonds, particularly U.S. Treasury securities. This increase in demand 
was not primarily due to higher U.S. interest rates but to problems in the international 
financial system that we will discuss in Chapter 30. Many investors saw U.S. financial 
 assets as a safe haven in times of financial problems because the investors believed the 
U.S. Treasury was unlikely to default on its bonds.

Data from Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.
Conditions began to change in 2002, however, for a couple of reasons. First, as we 
saw in Chapter 26, the Fed began aggressively cutting the target for the federal funds 
rate to deal with the recession of 2001 and the initially slow recovery that followed. By 
May 2003, the target for the federal funds rate was at a historically low level of 1 per-
cent. Low U.S. interest rates mean that investors are likely to buy foreign assets rather 
than U.S. assets, which depresses the demand for dollars and lowers the exchange value 
of the dollar. Although the Fed did begin raising the target for the federal funds rate 
in 2004, it resumed cutting the target in the fall of 2007. Low U.S. interest rates have 
played a role in the declining value of the dollar. Second, many investors and some cen-
tral banks became convinced that the value of the dollar was too high in 2002 and that 
it was likely to decline in the future. As we will see later in this chapter, the United States 
has run large current account deficits since the early 2000s. Many investors believed 
that the substantial increase in the supply of dollars in exchange for foreign currencies 
that resulted from these current account deficits would ultimately result in a significant

Some Exchange Rates Are Not Determined 
by the Market
To this point, we have assumed that exchange rates are determined in the market. This 
assumption is a good one for many currencies, including the U.S. dollar, the euro, the 
Japanese yen, and the British pound. Some currencies, however, have fixed exchange rates 
that do not change over long periods. For example, for more than 10 years, the value of 
the Chinese yuan was fixed against the U.S. dollar at a rate of 8.28 yuan to the dollar. As 
we will discuss in more detail in Chapter 30, a country’s central bank has to intervene in 
the foreign exchange market to buy and sell its currency to keep the  exchange rate fixed.
How Movements in the Exchange Rate  
Affect Exports and Imports
When the market value of the dollar increases, the foreign currency price of U.S. exports 
rises, and the dollar price of foreign imports falls. For example, suppose that initially the 
market exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the euro is $1 = €1. In that case, an 
Apple iPhone that has a price of $200 in the United States will have a price of €200 in 
France. A bottle of French wine that has a price of €50 in France will have a price of $50 
in the United States. Now suppose the market exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and 
the euro changes to $1.20 = €1. Because it now takes more dollars to buy a euro, the 
dollar has depreciated against the euro, and the euro has appreciated against the dollar. 
The depreciation of the dollar has decreased the euro price of the iPhone from €200 to 
$200>(1.20 dollars>euro) = €167. The dollar price of the French wine has risen from 
$50 to €50 * 1.20 dollars>euro = $60. As a result, we would expect more iPhones to 
be sold in France and less French wine to be sold in the United States.
To generalize, we can conclude that a depreciation in the domestic currency will 
 increase exports and decrease imports, thereby increasing net exports. As we saw in 
previous chapters, net exports is a component of aggregate demand. If real GDP is 
 currently below potential GDP, then, holding all other factors constant, a deprecia-
tion in the domestic currency should increase net exports, aggregate demand, and real 
GDP. An appreciation in the domestic currency should have the opposite effect: Exports 
should fall, and imports should rise, which will reduce net exports, aggregate demand, 
and real GDP.
decline in the value of the dollar. Once investors become convinced that the value of a 
country’s currency will decline, they become reluctant to hold that country’s financial 
assets. A decreased willingness by foreign investors to buy U.S. financial assets decreases 
the  demand for dollars and lowers the exchange value of the dollar.
What explains the increase in the value of the dollar in late 2008 and early 2009 and 
again in mid-2010? The increase was largely the result of the deepening of the financial 
crisis in the fall of 2008. Just as during the financial crisis of the late 1990s, many inves-
tors saw U.S. Treasury securities as a safe haven and demanded dollars in order to invest 
in them. By the summer of 2009, the easing in the financial crisis resulted in the dollar 
resuming its decline. Worries that some European governments—particularly Greece—
might default on their government bonds caused a temporary increase in the value of 
the dollar during mid-2010. A smaller increase in the value of the dollar during 2011 
caused the problems for McDonald’s mentioned in the chapter opener.
The fall in the value of the dollar over the long run has been bad news for U.S. 
tourists traveling abroad and for anyone in the United States buying foreign goods and 
services. It has been good news, however, for U.S. firms exporting goods and services to 
other countries.

The Foreign Exchange Market and Exchange Rates  
995
Don’t Confuse What Happens When a 
Currency Appreciates with What Happens 
When It Depreciates
One of the most confusing aspects of exchange rates is that 
they can be expressed in two ways. We can express the ex-
change rate between the dollar and the yen either as how 
many yen can be purchased with $1 or as how many dol-
lars can be purchased with ¥1. That is, we can express the 
exchange rate as ¥ 100 = +1 or as +0.01 = ¥ 1. When a 
currency appreciates, it increases in value relative to an-
other currency. When it depreciates, it decreases in value 
relative to another currency.
If the exchange rate changes from ¥ 100 = +1 to 
¥ 120 = +1, the dollar has appreciated and the yen has de-
preciated because it now takes more yen to buy $1. If the 
exchange rate changes from +0.01 = ¥ 1 to +0.015 = ¥ 1, 
however, the dollar has depreciated and the yen has appre-
ciated because it now takes more dollars to buy ¥1. This 
situation can appear somewhat confusing because the ex-
change rate seems to have “increased” in both cases. To 
determine which currency has appreciated and which has 
depreciated, it is important to remember that an appre-
ciation of the domestic currency means that it now takes 
more units of the foreign currency to buy one unit of the 
domestic currency. A depreciation of the domestic cur-
rency means it takes fewer units of the foreign currency to 
buy one unit of the domestic currency. This observation 
holds no matter which way we express the exchange rate.

Solving the Problem
Step 1: Review the chapter material. This problem is about changes in the value of 
a currency, so you may want to review the section “How Movements in the 
Exchange Rate Affect Exports and Imports” on page 994.
Step 2: Explain whether the value of the U.S. dollar appreciated or depreciated 
against the Canadian dollar. We know that if the U.S. dollar appreciates against 
the Canadian dollar, it will take more Canadian dollars to purchase 1 U.S. dol-
lar, and, equivalently, fewer U.S. dollars will be required to purchase 1 Canadian 
dollar. A Canadian consumer or business will need to pay more Canadian dol-
lars to buy products imported from the United States: A good or service that had 
been selling for 100 Canadian dollars will now sell for more than 100 Canadian 
dollars. A U.S. consumer or business will have to pay fewer U.S. dollars to buy 
products imported from Canada: A good or service that had been selling for 
100 U.S. dollars will now sell for fewer than 100 U.S. dollars. We can conclude 
that if the price of goods imported into the United States from Canada fell, the 
value of the U.S. dollar must have appreciated versus the Canadian dollar.
Step 3: Explain what happened to the average price in Canadian dollars of goods 
exported from the United States to Canada. If the U.S. dollar appreciated 
relative to the Canadian dollar, the average price in Canadian dollars of goods 
exported from the United States to Canada will have risen.

C H A P T E R  2 9  Macroeconomics in an Open Economy 
The Real Exchange Rate
We have seen that an important factor in determining the level of a country’s exports 
to and imports from another country is the relative prices of each country’s goods. The 
relative prices of two countries’ goods are determined by two factors: the relative price 
levels in the two countries and the nominal exchange rate between the two countries’ 
currencies. Economists combine these two factors in the real exchange rate, which is 
the price of domestic goods in terms of foreign goods. Recall that the price level is a 
measure of the average prices of goods and services in an economy. We can calculate the 
real exchange rate between two currencies as
Real exchange rate = Nominal exchange rate * a Domestic price level
Foreign price level b.
Notice that changes in the real exchange rate reflect both changes in the nominal 
exchange rate and changes in the relative price levels. For example, suppose that the ex-
change rate between the U.S. dollar and the British pound is +1 = ₤1, the price level in 
the United States is 100, and the price level in the United Kingdom is also 100. Then the 
real exchange rate between the dollar and the pound is
Real exchange rate = 1 pound>dollar * a 100
100 b = 1.00.
Now suppose that the nominal exchange rate increases to 1.1 pounds per dollar, 
while the price level in the United States rises to 105 and the price level in the United 
Kingdom remains 100. In this case, the real exchange rate will be
Real exchange rate = 1.1 pound>dollar * a 105
100 b = 1.15.
The increase in the real exchange rate from 1.00 to 1.15 tells us that the prices of U.S. 
goods and services are now 15 percent higher than they were relative to British goods 
and services.
Real exchange rates are reported as index numbers, with one year chosen as the 
base year. As with the consumer price index, the main value of the real exchange rate is 
in tracking changes over time—in this case, changes in the relative prices of domestic 
goods in terms of foreign goods.
The International Sector and National 
Saving and Investment
Having studied what determines the exchange rate, we are now ready to explore further 
the linkages between the U.S. economy and foreign economies. As we saw in Figure 9.1 
on page 275, until 1970, U.S. imports and exports were usually 4 percent to 5 percent of 
GDP. Imports and exports are now two to three times as large a fraction of U.S. GDP. 
Imports have also consistently been larger than exports, meaning that net exports have 
been negative.
Net Exports Equal Net Foreign Investment
If your spending is greater than your income, what can you do? You can sell some 
 assets—maybe those 20 shares of stock in the Walt Disney Company your grandparents 
gave you—or you can borrow money. A firm can be in the same situation: If a firm’s 
costs are greater than its revenues, it has to make up the difference by selling assets or by 
borrowing. A country is in the same situation when it imports more than it exports: The 
country must finance the difference by selling assets—such as land, office buildings, or 
factories—or by borrowing.
In other words, for any country, a current account deficit must be exactly offset by 
a financial account surplus. When a country sells more assets to foreigners than it buys

from foreigners, or when it borrows more from foreigners than it lends to  foreigners—
as it must if it is running a current account deficit—the country experiences a net capi-
tal inflow and a financial account surplus. Remember that net exports is roughly equal 
to the current account balance. Remember also that the financial account balance is 
roughly equal to net capital flows, which are in turn equal to net foreign investment but 
with the opposite sign. To review these two points, look again at Table 29.1 on page 985, 
which shows that the current account balance is determined mainly by the balance of 
trade and the balance of services, and the financial account is equal to net capital flows. 
Also, remember the definition of net foreign investment.
When imports are greater than exports, net exports are negative, and there will be a 
net capital inflow as people in the United States sell assets and borrow to pay for the sur-
plus of imports over exports. Therefore, net capital flows will be equal to net exports (but 
with the opposite sign), and net foreign investment will also be equal to net exports (and  
with the same sign). Because net exports are usually negative for the United States, in 
most years, the United States must be a net borrower from abroad, and U.S. net foreign 
investment will be negative.
We can summarize this discussion with the following equations:
Current account balance + Financial account balance = 0
or
Current account balance = - Financial account balance
or
Net exports = Net foreign investment.
This equation tells us, once again, that countries such as the United States that import 
more than they export must borrow more from abroad than they lend abroad: If net 
exports are negative, net foreign investment will also be negative by the same amount. 
Countries such as Japan and China that export more than they import must lend abroad 
more than they borrow from abroad: If net exports are positive, net foreign investment 
will also be positive by the same amount.
Domestic Saving, Domestic Investment,  
and Net Foreign Investment
As we saw in Chapter 21, the total saving in any economy is equal to saving by the pri-
vate sector plus saving by the government sector, which we called public saving. When 
the government runs a budget surplus by spending less than it receives in taxes, it is 
saving. When the government runs a budget deficit, public saving is negative. Negative 
saving is also known as dissaving. We can write the following expression for the level of 
saving in the economy:
National saving = Private saving + Public saving
or
S = Sprivate + Spublic.
Private saving is equal to what households have left of their income after spending on 
consumption goods and paying taxes (for simplicity, we assume that transfer payments 
are zero):
Private saving = National income - Consumption - Taxes
or
Sprivate = Y - C - T.
Public saving is equal to the difference between government spending and taxes:
Government saving = Taxes - Government spending

998 
C H A P T E R  2 9  Macroeconomics in an Open Economy 
or
Spublic = T - G.
Finally, remember the basic macroeconomic equation for GDP or national income:
Y = C + I + G + NX.
We can use this last equation, our definitions of private and public saving, and the 
fact that net exports equal net foreign investment to arrive at an important relationship, 
known as the saving and investment equation:
National saving = Domestic investment + Net foreign investment
or
S = I + NFI.
This equation is an identity because it must always be true, given the definitions we have 
used.
The saving and investment equation tells us that a country’s saving will be invested 
either domestically or overseas. If you save $1,000 and use the funds to buy a bond 
 issued by General Motors, GM may use the $1,000 to renovate a factory in the United 
States (I) or to build a factory in China (NFI) as a joint venture with a Chinese firm.
Saving and investment equation An 
equation that shows that national 
saving is equal to domestic investment 
plus net foreign investment.
Solving the Problem
Step 1: Review the chapter material. This problem is about the saving and  investment 
equation, so you may want to review the section “Domestic Saving, Domestic 
Investment, and Net Foreign Investment,” which begins on page 997.
Step 2: Derive an expression for national saving (S) in terms of national income 
(Y), consumption (C), and government purchases (G).We can bring to-
gether the four equations we need to use:
1. Sprivate = Y -  C - T
2. Spublic = T - G
3. Y = C + I + G + NX
4. NX = NFI
 
Because national saving (S) appears in the saving and investment equation, we 
need to find an equation for it in terms of the other variables. Adding equa-
tion 1 plus equation 2 yields national saving:
S = Sprivate + Spublic = 1Y - C - T2 + 1T - G2 = Y - C - G.
Step 3: Use the result from Step 2 to derive an expression for national saving in 
terms of investment (I) and net exports (NX). Because GDP (Y) does not 
appear in the saving and investment equation, we need to substitute the 
 expression for it given in equation (3):
S = 1C + I + G + NX2 - C - G
Solved Problem 29.3
Arriving at the Saving and Investment Equation
Use the definitions of private and public saving, the equa-
tion for GDP or national income, and the fact that net 
exports must equal net foreign investment to arrive at the 
saving and investment equation.

 
The Effect of a Government Budget Deficit on Investment 
999
A country such as the United States that has negative net foreign investment must 
be saving less than it is investing domestically. To see this, rewrite the saving and invest-
ment equation by moving domestic investment to the left side:
S - I = NFI.
If net foreign investment is negative—as it is for the United States nearly every year—
domestic investment (I) must be greater than national saving (S).
The level of saving in Japan has been well above domestic investment. The result 
has been high levels of Japanese net foreign investment. For example, Japanese automo-
bile companies Toyota, Honda, and Nissan have all constructed factories in the United 
States. Sony purchased the Columbia Pictures film studio. Japan has made many similar 
investments in countries around the world, which has sometimes caused resentment in 
those countries. There were some protests in the United States in the 1980s, for exam-
ple, when Japanese investors purchased the Pebble Beach golf course in California and 
the Rockefeller Center complex in New York City.
Japan needs a high level of net exports to help offset a low level of domestic invest-
ment. When exports of a product begin to decline and imports begin to increase, gov-
ernments are often tempted to impose tariffs or quotas to reduce imports. (See Chapter 9  
to review tariffs and quotas and their negative effects on the economy.) In fact, many 
Japanese firms have been urging the Japanese government to impose trade restrictions 
on imports from China.
The Effect of a Government Budget Deficit 
on Investment
The link we have just developed among saving, investment, and net foreign investment 
can help us understand some of the effects of changes in a government’s budget deficit. 
When the government runs a budget deficit, national saving will decline unless private 
saving increases by the amount of the budget deficit, which is unlikely. As the saving 
and investment equation 1S = I + NFI2 shows, the result of a decline in national sav-
ing must be a decline in either domestic investment or net foreign investment. Why, 
though, does an increase in the government budget deficit cause a fall in domestic in-
vestment or net foreign investment?
To understand the answer to this question, remember that if the federal govern-
ment runs a budget deficit, the U.S. Treasury must raise an amount equal to the deficit 
by selling bonds. To attract investors, the Treasury may have to raise the interest rates on 
its bonds. As interest rates on Treasury bonds rise, other interest rates, including those 
on corporate bonds and bank loans, will also rise. Higher interest rates will discour-
age some firms from borrowing funds to build new factories or to buy new equipment 
or computers. Higher interest rates on financial assets in the United States will attract 
foreign investors. Investors in Canada, Japan, or China will have to buy U.S. dollars to 
be able to purchase bonds in the United States. This greater demand for dollars will in-
crease their value relative to foreign currencies. As the value of the dollar rises, exports 
from the United States will fall, and imports to the United States will rise. Net exports 
and, therefore, net foreign investment will fall.

C H A P T E R  2 9  Macroeconomics in an Open Economy 
When a government budget deficit leads to a decline in net exports, the result is 
sometimes referred to as the twin deficits, which refers to the possibility that a govern-
ment budget deficit will also lead to a current account deficit. The twin deficits idea 
first became widely discussed in the United States during the early 1980s, when the fed-
eral government ran a large budget deficit that resulted in high interest rates, a high 
exchange value of the dollar, and a large current account deficit.
Figure 29.4 shows that in the early 1980s, the United States had large federal budget 
deficits and large current account deficits. The figure also shows, however, that the twin 
deficits idea does not match the experience of the United States after 1990. The large 
federal budget deficits of the early 1990s occurred at a time of relatively small current 
account deficits, and the budget surpluses of the late 1990s occurred at a time of then-
record current account deficits. Both the current account deficit and the federal budget 
deficit increased in the early 2000s, but the federal budget deficit declined in the mid-
2000s much more than did the current account deficit. Beginning in 2008, the federal 
budget deficit soared, more than doubling as a percentage of GDP, while the current ac-
count deficit declined.
The experience of other countries also shows only mixed support for the twin 
deficits idea. Germany ran large budget deficits and large current account deficits 
during the early 1990s, but both Canada and Italy ran large budget deficits during the 
1980s without running current account deficits. The saving and investment equation 
shows that an increase in the government budget deficit will not lead to an increase in 
the current account deficit, provided that either private saving increases or domestic 
investment declines. According to the twin deficits idea, when the federal govern-
ment ran budget surpluses in the late 1990s, the current account should also have 
been in surplus, or at least the current account deficit should have been small. In fact, 
the increase in national saving due to the budget surpluses was more than offset by a 
sharp decline in private saving, and the United States ran very large current account 
deficits.
Why Is the United States Called  
the “World’s Largest Debtor”?
The following graph shows the current account balance as a 
percentage of GDP for the United States for the period 1950–
2010. The United States has had a current account deficit every year since 1982, with 
the exception of 1991. Between 1950 and 1975, the United States ran a current account 
deficit in only five years. Many economists believe that the current account deficits of

the 1980s were closely related to the federal budget deficits of those years. High inter-
est rates attracted foreign investors to U.S. bonds, which raised the exchange rate be-
tween the dollar and foreign currencies. The high exchange rate reduced U.S. exports 
and  increased imports, leading to current account deficits.

Data from U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.
As the federal budget deficit narrowed in the mid-1990s and disappeared in the late 
1990s, the foreign exchange value of the dollar remained high—and large current ac-
count deficits continued—because foreign investors persisted in investing in the United 
States, despite low interest rates. In the late 1990s, a number of countries around the 
world, such as South Korea, Indonesia, Brazil, and Russia, suffered severe economic 
problems. In a process known as a flight to quality, many investors sold their invest-
ments in those countries and bought investments in the United States. In addition, the 
strong performance of the U.S. stock market through the spring of 2000 attracted many 
investors. Finally, the sharp decline in private saving in the United States that began 
during the late 1990s also contributed to the U.S. current account deficit. The fall in 
the value of the dollar after 2008 helped reduce the size of the current account deficit, 
although the deficit still remained substantial.
Do persistent current account deficits represent a problem for the United States? 
Current account deficits result in U.S. net foreign investment being negative. Each 
year, foreign investors accumulate many more U.S. assets than U.S. investors accu-
mulate foreign assets. At the end of 2010, foreign investors owned about $2.5 trillion 
more of U.S. assets—such as stocks, bonds, and factories—than U.S. investors owned 
of foreign assets, which is why the United States is sometimes called “the world’s larg-
est debtor.” But the continued willingness of foreign investors to buy U.S. stocks and 
bonds and foreign companies to build factories in the United States can be seen as a 
vote of confidence in the strength of the U.S. economy and the buying power of U.S. 
consumers. When private saving rates declined in the United States to historically 
low levels in the mid-2000s, only the continued flow of funds from foreign inves-
tors made it possible for the United States to maintain the high levels of domestic 
investment required for economic growth. Beginning in 2009, private saving rates 
increased, but public saving turned sharply negative as the federal budget deficit 
soared. Domestic investment in the United States remains reliant on funds from for-
eign investment.

Monetary Policy and Fiscal Policy 
in an Open Economy
When we discussed monetary policy and fiscal policy in Chapters 26 and 27, we did not 
emphasize that the United States is an open economy. Now that we have explored some 
of the links among economies, we can look at the difference between how monetary 
policy and fiscal policy work in an open economy as opposed to in a closed economy. 
Economists refer to the ways in which monetary policy and fiscal policy affect the do-
mestic economy as policy channels. An open economy has more policy channels than 
does a closed economy.
Monetary Policy in an Open Economy
When the Federal Reserve engages in an expansionary monetary policy, it buys Treasury 
securities to lower interest rates and stimulate aggregate demand. In a closed economy, 
the main effect of lower interest rates is on domestic investment spending and purchases 
of consumer durables. In an open economy, lower interest rates will also affect the ex-
change rate between the dollar and foreign currencies. Lower interest rates will cause 
some investors in the United States and abroad to switch from investing in U.S. financial 
assets to investing in foreign financial assets. This switch will lower the demand for the 
dollar relative to foreign currencies and cause its value to decline. A lower exchange rate 
will decrease the price of U.S. products in foreign markets and increase the price of for-
eign products in the United States. As a result, net exports will increase. This additional 
policy channel will increase the ability of an expansionary monetary policy to affect ag-
gregate demand.
When the Fed wants to reduce aggregate demand to reduce inflation, it engages in 
a contractionary monetary policy. The Fed sells Treasury securities to increase inter-
est rates and reduce aggregate demand. In a closed economy, the main effect is once 
again on domestic investment spending and purchases of consumer durables. In an 
open economy, higher interest rates will lead to a higher foreign exchange value of the 
dollar. The prices of U.S. products in foreign markets will increase, and the prices of 
foreign products in the United States will fall. As a result, net exports will fall. The con-
tractionary policy will have a larger effect on aggregate demand, and therefore it will be 
more effective in slowing down the growth in economic activity. To summarize: Mon-
etary policy has a greater effect on aggregate demand in an open economy than in a closed 
economy.
Fiscal Policy in an Open Economy
To engage in an expansionary fiscal policy, the federal government increases its pur-
chases or cuts taxes. Increases in government purchases directly increase aggregate de-
mand. Tax cuts increase aggregate demand by increasing household disposable income 
and business income, which results in increased consumption spending and invest-
ment spending. An expansionary fiscal policy may result in higher interest rates. In a 
closed economy, the main effect of higher interest rates is to reduce domestic invest-
ment spending and purchases of consumer durables. In an open economy, higher inter-
est rates will also lead to an increase in the foreign exchange value of the dollar and a 
decrease in net exports. Therefore, in an open economy, an expansionary fiscal policy 
may be less effective because the crowding out effect may be larger. In a closed economy, 
only consumption and investment are crowded out by an expansionary fiscal policy. In 
an open economy, net exports may also be crowded out.
The government can fight inflation by using a contractionary fiscal policy to slow 
the growth of aggregate demand. A contractionary fiscal policy cuts government pur-
chases or raises taxes to reduce household disposable income and consumption spend-
ing. It also reduces the federal budget deficit (or increases the budget surplus), which 
may lower interest rates. Lower interest rates will increase domestic investment and pur-
chases of consumer durables, thereby offsetting some of the reduction in government

spending and increases in taxes. In an open economy, lower interest rates will also 
 reduce the foreign exchange value of the dollar and increase net exports. Therefore, in 
an open economy, a contractionary fiscal policy will have a smaller effect on aggregate 
demand and therefore will be less effective in slowing down an economy. In summary: 
Fiscal policy has a smaller effect on aggregate demand in an open economy than in a closed 
economy.

Economics in Your Life
The South Korean Central Bank and Your Car Loan
At the beginning of the chapter, we posed this question: What effect will the Bank of Korea’s deci-
sion to sell its U.S. Treasury bonds likely have on the interest rate that you pay on your car loan? To 
sell its holdings of Treasury bonds, South Korea’s central bank may have to offer them at a lower 
price. When the prices of bonds fall, the interest rates on them rise. As the interest rates on U.S. 
Treasury bonds increase, the interest rates on corporate bonds and bank loans, including car loans, 
may also increase. So, the decision of the Bank of Korea has the potential to increase the interest 
rate you pay on your car loan. In practice, the interest rate on your car loan is likely to be affected 
only if the Bank of Korea sells a very large number of bonds and if investors consider it likely that 
other foreign central banks may soon do the same thing. The basic point is important, however: 
Economies are interdependent, and interest rates in the United States are not determined entirely 
by the actions of people in the United States.
Conclusion
At one time, U.S. policymakers—and economics textbooks—ignored the linkages 
 between the United States and other economies. In the modern world, these linkages 
have become increasingly important, and economists and policymakers must take them 
into account when analyzing the economy. In Chapter 30, we will discuss further how 
the international financial system operates.

What a Weak Dollar 
Means for Consumers
The value of U.S. currency might 
seem trivial in the face of soaring 
gas prices and high unemployment, 
but the ripple effects of a chronically 
weak greenback impacts consumers 
both here and abroad. The U.S. Dol-
lar Index, which tracks a basket of 
foreign currencies, has fallen almost  
5 percent year-to-date. Despite a re-
cent rebound, just last month it tum-
bled to levels not seen since the worst 
days of the financial crisis in 2008.
But how did the dollar drop to 
this point, and more importantly, how 
much should you worry?
The answer is complicated, but it 
has much to do with fundamental sup-
ply-and-demand dynamics, says Ad-
olfo Laurenti, deputy chief economist 
at Chicago-based financial services 
firm Mesirow Financial. Stronger econ-
omies tend to attract investors, putting 
pressure on the supply of that country’s 
currency and driving up its value. “The 
stronger the country’s economy, the 
more people want to go and invest in 
that country and the stronger the cur-
rency is expected to be,” Laurenti says. 
On the flip side, investors tend to avoid 
struggling economies, which lessens 
demand for investment in the country 
and weakens its currency.
 The Federal Reserve’s bond buy-
ing programs have also had a hand in 
pushing the dollar lower by driving 
Struggling Economy Contributes  
to a Weak Dollar
making U.S.-produced goods more 
attractive in the global market, it also 
makes imports more expensive. U.S. 
companies can only absorb those 
higher costs for so long before they 
start passing hikes on to consumers.
“If you buy goods from abroad and 
their price continues to escalate, sooner 
or later, those rising costs will need to 
be offset in the United States by passing 
higher costs to the consumer,” Laurenti 
says. “That would, in turn, generate 
higher inflation.” Higher inflation erodes 
the purchasing power of consumers, 
which could put strain on the U.S. con-
sumer spending-driven economy.
A weak dollar is a double-edged 
sword, says Axel Merk, founder of 
Merk Investments and author of Sus-
tainable Wealth. U.S. exporters might 
see a bump in quarterly earnings as a 
result of a weaker dollar, but the ben-
efits will be short-lived, he says. The 
fundamental issue, Merk says, is that 
advanced economies rarely compete on 
the prices of goods, because they can’t. 
“When you think of low-end consumer 
goods that compete on price, you think 
of Vietnam,” he says. “We have no 
chance to compete with Vietnam. We 
have to compete in high tech. We have 
to compete on value added.”

ers; The dollar has fallen almost 5 percent this

c
interest rates to all-time lows. While 
meant to reduce the cost of borrowing 
to spur economic growth, low inter-
est rates have stunted yields on finan-
cial products such as bonds,  reducing 
 demand for investments denominated 
in dollars and weakening the currency.
“What we’re seeing now is that 
other economies, as they come out of 
recession faster than we are and [are] 
experiencing more robust growth than 
we are, their central banks are starting 
to tighten and raise interest rates mak-
ing those countries look more attrac-
tive,” says J. Bradford Jensen, associate 
professor of international business and 
economics at the McDonough School 
of Business at Georgetown University. 
“They might sell U.S. dollar-denomi-
nated assets to purchase assets in other 
currencies, which puts downward 
pressure on the dollar.”
 The specter of inflation also re-
mains on investors’ minds. “The Fed’s 
bond buying created very low inter-
est rates and created fear for many 
investors that future inflation will go 
up,” Laurenti says. “Higher inflation 
expectations and lower yields on fi-
nancial assets tend to bring weaker 
currency, and that’s exactly what we 
are seeing for the dollar.”
 But investors aren’t the only ones 
who have to worry about the impact of 
inflation. Consumers, too, are bound 
to see the cost of goods inching up if 
the dollar remains weak. Although 
weaker currency helps exporters by

Key Points in the Article
Through 2011, the Federal Reserve had 
kept interest rates at historically low levels 
in an effort to stimulate growth. As a result, 
the value of the dollar had declined relative 
to foreign currencies. At the same time, the 
central banks of some countries that were 
experiencing faster recoveries from the re-
cession had begun to tighten their mone-
tary policies by raising interest rates. Higher 
interest rates made those economies more 
attractive to investors and strengthened 
their currencies relative to the dollar. If the 
dollar remains weak, consumers will likely 
feel the effect in the form of rising prices for 
imported products. These rising prices will 
increase the U.S. inflation rate, reducing the 
purchasing power of consumers.
Analyzing the News
a  In an effort to boost economic growth 
in the United States, the Federal Re-
serve has purchased very large quantities of 
Treasury bonds, which has helped to push 
U.S. interest rates to record low levels. The 
low interest rates have lowered the demand 
for dollar-denominated investments. A de-
crease in the demand for U.S. financial 
assets by foreign investors decreases the 
demand for U.S. dollars, which in turn de-
creases the dollar’s value against foreign 
currencies. Figure 1 below shows move-
ments in the value of the dollar since 2002. 
The index used to measure the value of the 
dollar is an average of the exchange rates 
between the dollar and the currencies of 
major trading partners of the United States. 
Beginning in 2002, the dollar has declined 
gradually over time, rising in 2008 and 
2009, and then declining again through the 
middle of 2011.
 b As you read in this chapter, lower inter-
est rates result in a decline in the de-
mand for financial assets by foreign 
investors. Figure 2 shows the exchange 
rate between the dollar and the euro. A de-
crease in the demand for U.S. assets by for-
eign investors causes a decrease in the 
demand for dollars in exchange for euros, 
so that the demand curve for the dollar 
shifts from D1 to D2. As a result, the ex-
change rate falls from €0.80 per $1 to €0.75 
per $1. The low interest rates resulting from 
the Fed’s bond-buying programs also have 
some investors concerned about the possi-
bility that the U.S. inflation rate will increase 
in the future. Expectations of higher inflation 
combined with lower yields on financial se-
curities have the potential to weaken the 
value of a currency relative to other curren-
cies. Adolfo Laurenti of the financial ser-
vices company Mesirow Financial believes 
this is what has happened to the U.S. 
dollar.
 c Concerns about rising inflation can af-
fect consumers as well as investors. A 
weak dollar makes imports more expensive 
in the United States. If the dollar remains 
weak, U.S. companies that sell imported 
products and those that use imports in the 
manufacture of products will likely need to 
pass these higher costs along to U.S. con-
sumers by raising prices. The result would 
be higher inflation and reduced consumer 
purchasing power.
Thinking Critically
1. How would a decrease in the value of 
the U.S. dollar relative to other curren-
cies affect future U.S. trade deficits?
2. Suppose the value of the U.S. dollar 
increased. Which sectors of the U.S. 
economy would benefit from such an 
adjustment? Briefly explain.

C H A P T E R  2 9  Macroeconomics in an Open Economy 
Summary
Nearly all economies are open economies that trade with and in-
vest in other economies. A closed economy has no transactions in 
trade or finance with other economies. The balance of payments 
is the record of a country’s trade with other countries in goods, 
services, and assets. The current account records a country’s net 
exports, net investment income, and net transfers. The financial 
account shows investments a country has made abroad and for-
eign investments received by the country. The balance of trade 
is the difference between the value of the goods a country exports 
and the value of the goods a country imports. Net foreign invest-
ment is the difference between capital outflows from a country 
and capital inflows. The capital account is a part of the balance of 
payments that records relatively minor transactions. Apart from 
measurement errors, the sum of the current account and the fi-
nancial account must equal zero. Therefore, the balance of pay-
ments must also equal zero.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE: Explain how exchange rates are determined and how changes in exchange rates

Summary
The nominal exchange rate is the value of one country’s currency 
in terms of another country’s currency. The exchange rate is deter-
mined in the foreign exchange market by the demand and supply 
of a country’s currency. Changes in the exchange rate are caused 
by shifts in demand or supply. The three main sets of factors that 
cause the supply and demand curves in the foreign exchange mar-
ket to shift are changes in the demand for U.S.-produced goods 
and services and changes in the demand for foreign-produced 
goods and services; changes in the desire to invest in the United 
States and changes in the desire to invest in foreign countries; 
and changes in the expectations of currency traders—particularly 
speculators—concerning the likely future values of the dollar and 
the likely future values of foreign currencies. Currency apprecia-
tion occurs when a currency’s market value increases relative to 
another currency. Currency depreciation occurs when a cur-
rency’s market value decreases relative to another currency. The 
real exchange rate is the price of domestic goods in terms of for-
eign goods. The real exchange rate is calculated by multiplying the 
nominal exchange rate by the ratio of the domestic price level to 
the foreign price level.

In January 1, 2002, there were 15 member countries in 
the European Union. Twelve of those countries elimi-
nated their own individual currencies and began using a 
new common currency, the euro. For a three-year period 
from January 1, 1999, through December 31, 2001, these 
12 countries priced goods and services in terms of both 
their own currencies and the euro. During that period, 
the value of their currencies was fixed against each other 
and against the euro. So during that time, the dollar had an 
exchange rate against each of these currencies and against 
the euro. The information in the following table shows the 
fixed exchange rates of four European currencies against 
the euro and their exchange rates against the U.S. dollar on

LEARNING OBJECTIVE: Explain the saving and investment equation.
Summary
A current account deficit must be exactly offset by a financial ac-
count surplus. The financial account is equal to net capital flows, 
which is equal to net foreign investment but with the opposite 
sign. Because the current account balance is roughly equal to net 
exports, we can conclude that net exports will equal net foreign 
investment. National saving is equal to private saving plus gov-
ernment saving. Private saving is equal to national income minus 
consumption and minus taxes. Government saving is the differ-
ence between taxes and government spending. As we saw in pre-
vious chapters, GDP (or national income) is equal to the sum of

and supply of dollars and the resulting change in the ex-

3.8 [Related to Solved Problem 29.3 on page 998] Look again 
at Solved Problem 29.3, in which we derived the saving and 
investment equation S = I + NX. In deriving this equa-
tion, we assumed that national income was equal to Y. But Y 
only includes income earned by households. In the modern 
U.S. economy, households receive substantial transfer pay-
ments—such as Social Security payments and unemploy-
ment insurance payments—from the government. Suppose 
that we define national income as being equal to Y + TR, 
where TR equals government transfer payments, and we 
also define government spending as being equal to G + TR. 
Show that after making these adjustments, we end up with 
the same saving and investment equation.
 
3.9 Use the saving and investment equation to explain why the 
United States experienced large current account deficits in 
the late 1990s.
 3.10 Former congressman and presidential candidate  Richard 
Gephardt once proposed that tariffs be imposed on 
 imports from countries with which the United States has 
a trade deficit. If this proposal were enacted and if it were 
to succeed in reducing the U.S. current account deficit to 
zero, what would be the likely effect on domestic invest-
ment spending within the United States? Assume that no 
other federal government economic policy is changed. 
(Hint: Use the saving and investment equation to answer 
this question.)
 3.11 According to a May 2009 article from Reuters:
Net capital inflows into the United States were 
$23.2 billion in March, reversing a revised 
net outflow of $91.1 billion in the previous 
month . . . . It shows that money was returning 
into U.S. dollars . . . . The dollar extended gains 
against the euro, which last traded down 0.5 
percent at $1.3572.
 
 From the U.S. point of view, do the changes mentioned in 
the first sentence represent an increase or a decrease in net 
foreign investment? Why would this change in net foreign 
investment show that “money was returning into U.S. dol-
lars” and cause the exchange value of the dollar to rise?

LEARNING OBJECTIVE: Explain the effect of a government budget deficit on investment in an open economy.
Summary
When the government runs a budget deficit, national saving will 
decline unless private saving increases by the full amount of the 
budget deficit, which is unlikely. As the saving and investment 
equation 1S = I + NFI2  shows, the result of a decline in na-
tional saving must be a decline in either domestic investment or 
net foreign investment.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE: Compare the effectiveness of monetary policy and fiscal policy in an open economy 
and in a closed economy.
Summary
When the Federal Reserve engages in an expansionary monetary 
policy, it buys government bonds to lower interest rates and in-
crease aggregate demand. In a closed economy, the main effect of 
lower interest rates is on domestic investment spending and pur-
chases of consumer durables. In an open economy, lower inter-
est rates will also cause an increase in net exports. When the Fed 
wants to slow the rate of economic growth to reduce inflation, it 
engages in a contractionary monetary policy. With a contraction-
ary policy, the Fed sells government bonds to increase interest rates 
and reduce aggregate demand. In a closed economy, the main ef-
fect is once again on domestic investment and purchases of con-
sumer durables. In an open economy, higher interest rates will also 
reduce net exports. We can conclude that monetary policy has a 
greater impact on aggregate demand in an open economy than in 
a closed economy. To engage in an expansionary fiscal policy, the 
government increases government spending or cuts taxes. An ex-
pansionary fiscal policy can lead to higher interest rates. In a closed 
economy, the main effect of higher interest rates is on domestic 
investment spending and spending on consumer durables. In an 
open economy, higher interest rates will also reduce net exports. A 
contractionary fiscal policy will reduce the budget deficit and may 
lower interest rates. In a closed economy, lower interest rates in-
crease domestic investment and spending on consumer durables.

Exchange Rate Risk in Your Life
Suppose that you decide to take a job in Spain. You plan to work there for the next 10 years, build 
up some savings, and then return to the United States. As you prepare for your move, you read 
that economists expect the average productivity of Spanish firms to grow faster than the average 
productivity of U.S. firms over the next 10 years. If economists are correct, then, all else being equal, 
will the savings that you accumulate (in euros) be worth more or less in U.S. dollars than it would 
have been worth without the relative gains in Spanish productivity? As you read this chapter, see if 
you can answer this question. You can check your answer against the one we provide on page 1029 
at the end of this chapter.
euros than it would have if the value of the 
dollar hadn’t declined against the euro. 
Airbus’s main competitor is Boeing, 
which conducts its buying and selling in 
dollars. As a result, Boeing is not subject to 
losses resulting from fluctuations in exchange 
rates. Unlike Airbus, Air France has suffered 
less from exchange rate changes because it 
receives much of its revenue in euros, while 
the costs of planes, fuel, and other inputs pur-
chased by Air France are priced in dollars. So, 
an increase in the value of the euro against 
the dollar increases Air France’s profits.
In 2011, EADS announced that its first-
half profits decreased by 41 percent due to the 
appreciation of the euro relative to the U.S. 
dollar. As a result, Airbus announced that it 
was considering pricing its aircraft in euros.
In this chapter, we will look more 
closely at the international financial sys-
tem and at what determines fluctuations 
in  exchange rates. AN INSIDE LOOK AT 
POLICY on page 1030 discusses a bill that 
the U.S. Senate passed to raise tariffs on 
Chinese imports in response to claims that 
the Chinese yuan was undervalued.
Based on Daniel Michaels, “Strong Euro Weighs on 
Airbus,  Suppliers,” Wall Street Journal, October 30, 2009; 
and  David Pearson, “EADS Hit By Currency Swings,” Wall 
Street Journal, July 29, 2011.
In 1967, France, Germany, and the United 
Kingdom formed Airbus as a firm to develop 
and manufacture passenger aircraft. The new 
firm was formally organized as a manufactur-
ing subsidiary of the European Aeronautic 
Defense and Space Company (EADS), located 
in France. The first Airbus plane, the A300, 
was introduced at the Paris Air Show in 1969. 
Over the following decades, Airbus manufac-
tured more than 6,000 passenger aircraft and 
sold them to airlines around the world.
In October 2009, Airbus delivered 
its first A380 super-jumbo jetliner to Air 
France. Although the sale was cause for 
celebration among Airbus executives, it 
had a downside. Even though Airbus is a 
 European firm and Air France is a European 
airline, the worldwide aerospace industry 
conducts business in U.S. dollars. Because 
Airbus received dollars from Air France 
rather than euros, Airbus had to convert the 
dollars it received into euros. Between 2001, 
when Air France agreed to buy 10 A380 jet-
liners from Airbus, and 2009, the exchange 
value of the euro increased by about 60 per-
cent against the U.S. dollar—or, in other 
words, the value of the dollar had decreased 
against the euro. Therefore, when Airbus 
converted the dollars it received from Air 
France into euros, it received many fewer

C H A P T E R  3 0  The International Financial System
A 
key fact about the international economy is that exchange rates among the ma-
jor currencies fluctuate. These fluctuations have important consequences for 
firms, consumers, and governments. In Chapter 29, we discussed the basics of 
how exchange rates are determined. We also looked at the relationship between 
a country’s imports and exports, as well as at capital flows into and out of a country. In 
this chapter, we will look further at the international financial system and at the role central 
banks play in the system.
Exchange Rate Systems
A country’s exchange rate can be determined in several ways. Some countries sim-
ply allow the exchange rate to be determined by demand and supply, just as other 
prices are. A country that allows demand and supply to determine the value of its 
currency is said to have a floating currency. Some countries attempt to keep the 
exchange rate between their currency and another currency constant. For example, 
China kept the exchange rate constant between its currency, the yuan, and the U.S. 
dollar, from 1994 until 2005, when it announced it would allow greater exchange rate 
flexibility. When countries can agree on how exchange rates should be determined, 
economists say that there is an  exchange rate system. Currently, many countries, 
including the United States, allow their currencies to float most of the time, although 
they occasionally intervene to buy and sell their currency or other currencies to af-
fect exchange rates. In other words, many countries attempt to manage the float of 
their currencies. As a result, the current exchange rate system is a managed float 
exchange rate system.
Historically, the two most important alternatives to the managed float exchange 
rate system were the gold standard and the Bretton Woods system. These were both fixed 
exchange rate systems, where exchange rates remained constant for long periods. Un-
der the gold standard, a country’s currency consisted of gold coins and paper currency 
that the government was committed to redeem for gold. When countries agree to keep 
the value of their currencies constant, there is a fixed exchange rate system. The gold 
standard was a fixed exchange rate system that lasted from the nineteenth century until 
the 1930s.
Under the gold standard, exchange rates were determined by the relative amounts 
of gold in each country’s currency, and the size of a country’s money supply was deter-
mined by the amount of gold available. To rapidly expand its money supply during a 
war or an economic depression, a country would need to abandon the gold standard. 
In response to the Great Depression, by the mid-1930s, most countries, including the 
United States, had abandoned the gold standard. Although during the following de-
cades there were occasional discussions about restoring the gold standard, no serious 
attempt to do so occurred.
A conference held in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, in 1944 set up an exchange 
rate system in which the United States pledged to buy or sell gold at a fixed price of $35 
per ounce. The central banks of all other members of the new Bretton Woods system 
pledged to buy and sell their currencies at a fixed rate against the dollar. By fixing their 
exchange rates against the dollar, these countries were fixing the exchange rates among 
their currencies as well. Unlike under the gold standard, neither the United States nor 
any other country was willing to redeem its paper currency for gold domestically. The 
United States would redeem dollars for gold only if they were presented by a foreign 
central bank. Fixed exchange rate regimes can run into difficulties because exchange 
rates are not free to adjust quickly to changes in demand and supply for currencies. As 
we will see in the next section, central banks often encounter difficulty if they are re-
quired to keep an exchange rate fixed over a period of years. By the early 1970s, the dif-
ficulty of keeping exchange rates fixed led to the end of the Bretton Woods system. The 
appendix to this chapter contains additional discussion about the gold standard and the 
Bretton Woods system.

The Current Exchange Rate System 
1015
The Current Exchange Rate System
The current exchange rate system has three important aspects:
 1. The United States allows the dollar to float against other major currencies.
 2. Seventeen countries in Europe have adopted a single currency, the euro.
 3. Some developing countries have attempted to keep their currencies’ exchange rates 
fixed against the dollar or another major currency.
We begin our discussion of the current exchange rate system by looking at the 
changing value of the dollar over time. In discussing the value of the dollar, we can look 
further at what determines exchange rates in the short run and in the long run.
The Floating Dollar
Since 1973, the value of the U.S. dollar has fluctuated widely against other major cur-
rencies. Panel (a) of Figure 30.1 shows the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and 
the Canadian dollar between January 1973 and October 2011, and panel (b) shows the

of the current exchange rate 
system.

European countries.
Remember That Modern Currencies Are 
Fiat Money
Although the United States has not been on the gold stan-
dard since 1933, many people still believe that somehow gold 
continues to “back” U.S. currency. The U.S. Department of 
the Treasury still owns billions of dollars worth of gold bars, 
most of which are stored at the Fort Knox Bullion Deposi-
tory in Kentucky. (Even more gold is stored in a basement of 
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which holds about 
one-quarter of the world’s gold supply—almost 10 percent 
of all the gold ever mined. This gold, however, is entirely 
owned by foreign governments and international agencies.) 
The gold in Fort Knox no longer has any connection to the 
amount of paper money issued by the Federal Reserve. As 
we saw in Chapter 25, U.S. currency—like the currencies of 
other countries—is fiat money, which means it has no value 
except as money. The link between gold and money that 
 existed for centuries has been broken in modern economies.

The Canadian Province of . . . Arizona?
In 2011, there seemed to be a lot of Canadians buying houses 
in Phoenix and other cities in Arizona. For many years, some 
Canadians have found buying a second home in Arizona or 
Florida a good way to avoid the harsh Canadian winters. As 
Figure 30.1 shows, the value of the U.S. dollar has been declining relative to the Ca-
nadian dollar for most of the period since 2000. Although the value of the U.S. dollar 
soared by more than 30 percent relative to the Canadian dollar during the height of the 
financial crisis in 2008, it continued to decline during most of the period after the crisis 
had ended. The falling value of the U.S. dollar was a great help to Canadian buyers of 
U.S. homes.
In late 2001, it took 1.60 Canadian dollars to purchase 1 U.S. dollar. So, a Canadian 
purchasing a house in Phoenix priced at $125,000 would have had to pay $200,000 in 
Canadian dollars. In the summer of 2011, it took only 0.95 Canadian dollars to purchase 
1 U.S. dollar. The stronger Canadian dollar meant that a Canadian could now purchase 
a house in Phoenix priced at $125,000 for only $118,750 in Canadian dollars. In other 
words, the decline in the value of the U.S. dollar resulted in a more than 40 percent reduc-
tion in the price of the house in Canadian dollars. As one Canadian who was buying a 
vacation home in Desert Ridge, Arizona, put it: “It’s purchasing power, plain and simple. 
In the days when our dollar was 60 or 65 [U.S.] cents, I wouldn’t even be talking to you. 
The strong Canadian dollar has created a lot of opportunities for Canadians.” In addition 
to the decline in the value of the U.S. dollar, many Canadians found Arizona to be an ideal 
place to buy a second home because overbuilding in the state during the housing bubble 
had resulted in many property owners being willing to accept sharply lower prices (in 
U.S. dollars). Little wonder that by 2011, restaurants and bars in Arizona began staging 
Canada Day celebrations to attract the growing Canadian population.
In addition to individual Canadians looking to buy second homes in Arizona, some 
Canadian investors bought multiple properties, hoping to resell them for a profit in the 
future after local housing prices had risen and after the value of the U.S. dollar had in-
creased relative to the Canadian dollar. Some Canadian manufacturers have also shifted 
operations to the United States. For example, E.H. Price, a firm that produces venti-
lation systems for commercial buildings and is headquartered in Winnipeg, Canada, 
doubled the size of its operations in the United States, where nearly half of its sales were. 
The rising value of the Canadian dollar would have priced its products out of the U.S. 
market if it had continued manufacturing the products in Canada.
Of course, further fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar could pose problems 
for Canadians buying and investing in the United States. For example, if the value of the 
U.S. dollar were to continue to decline, then Canadians who bought second homes in 
the United States or Canadian investors buying multiple U.S. homes would take a loss in 
terms of Canadian dollars should they decide to sell. An increase in the value of the U.S. 
dollar would be good news for Canadian owners of U.S. houses but bad news for Cana-
dian manufacturers if they intended to export goods to Canada from their U.S. plants.
Based on Chana R. Schoenberger, “Canadians Warm to Phoenix,” Wall Street Journal, October 8, 2011; Julie Schmit, 
 “Foreign Buyers Lifting U.S. Home Sales,” USA Today, July 14, 2011; and Barrie McKenna, “For Canadian Manufacturers,

The Current Exchange Rate System 
1017
What Determines Exchange Rates in the Long Run?
Over the past 40 years, why has the value of the U.S. dollar fallen against the Japanese 
yen but risen slightly against the Canadian dollar? In the short run, the two most im-
portant causes of exchange rate movements are changes in interest rates—which cause 
investors to change their views of which countries’ financial investments will yield the 
highest returns—and changes in investors’ expectations about the future values of cur-
rencies. Over the long run, other factors are also important in explaining movements in 
exchange rates.
The Theory of Purchasing Power Parity It seems reasonable that, in the long 
run, exchange rates should be at a level that makes it possible to buy the same amount 
of goods and services with the equivalent amount of any country’s currency. In other 
words, the purchasing power of every country’s currency should be the same. The idea 
that in the long run, exchange rates move to equalize the purchasing powers of different 
currencies is referred to as the theory of purchasing power parity.
To make the theory of purchasing power parity clearer, consider a simple example. 
Suppose that a Hershey candy bar has a price of $1 in the United States and £1 in the 
United Kingdom and that the exchange rate is £1 5 $1. In that case, at least with respect 
to candy bars, the dollar and the pound have equivalent purchasing power. If the price of 
a Hershey bar increases to £2 in the United Kingdom but stays at $1 in the United States, 
the exchange rate will have to change to £2 per $1 in order for the pound to maintain its 
relative purchasing power. As long as exchange rates adjust to reflect purchasing power, 
it will be possible to buy a Hershey bar for $1 in the United States or to exchange $1 for 
£2 and buy the candy bar in the United Kingdom.
If exchange rates are not at the values indicated by purchasing power parity, it ap-
pears that there are opportunities to make profits. For example, suppose a Hershey candy 
bar sells for £2 in the United Kingdom and $1 in the United States, and the exchange 
rate between the dollar and the pound is £1 5 $1. In this case, it would be possible to ex-
change £1 million for $1 million and use the dollars to buy 1 million Hershey bars in the 
United States. The Hershey bars could then be shipped to the United Kingdom, where 
they could be sold for £2 million. The result of these transactions would be a profit of 
£1 million (minus any shipping costs). In fact, if the dollar–pound exchange rate does 
not reflect the purchasing power for many products—not just Hershey bars—this pro-
cess could be repeated until extremely large profits were made. In practice, though, as 
people attempted to make these profits by exchanging pounds for dollars, they would 
bid up the value of the dollar until it reached the purchasing power exchange rate of  
£2 5 $1. Once the exchange rate reflected the purchasing power of the two currencies, 
there would be no further opportunities for profit. This mechanism appears to guaran-
tee that exchange rates will be at the levels determined by purchasing power parity.
Three real-world complications, though, keep purchasing power parity from being 
a complete explanation of exchange rates, even in the long run:
 1. Not all products can be traded internationally. Where goods are traded interna-
tionally, profits can be made whenever exchange rates do not reflect their purchas-
ing power parity values. However, more than half of all goods and services produced 
in the United States and most other countries are not traded internationally. When 
goods are not traded internationally, their prices will not be the same in every coun-
try. For instance, suppose that the exchange rate is £1 for $1, but the price for having 
a cavity filled by a dentist is twice as high in the United States as it is in the United 
Kingdom. In this case, there is no way to buy up the low-priced British service and 
resell it in the United States. Because many goods and services are not traded inter-
nationally, exchange rates will not reflect exactly the relative purchasing powers of 
currencies.
 2. Products and consumer preferences are different across countries. We expect the 
same product to sell for the same price around the world, but if a product is similar 
but not identical to another product, their prices might be different. For example, a 
3-ounce Hershey candy bar may sell for a different price in the United States than

does a 3-ounce Cadbury candy bar in the United Kingdom. Prices of the same prod-
uct may also differ across countries if consumer preferences differ. If consumers in 
the United Kingdom like candy bars more than do consumers in the United States, 
a Hershey candy bar may sell for more in the United Kingdom than in the United 
States.
 3. Countries impose barriers to trade. Most countries, including the United States, 
impose tariffs and quotas on imported goods. A tariff is a tax imposed by a gov-
ernment on imports. A quota is a government-imposed limit on the quantity of a 
good that can be imported. For example, the United States has a quota on imports 
of sugar. As a result, the price of sugar in the United States is much higher than the 
price of sugar in other countries. Because of the quota, there is no legal way to buy 
up the cheap foreign sugar and resell it in the United States.

government imposes on the quantity

The Big Mac Theory  
of Exchange Rates
In a lighthearted attempt to test the accuracy of the theory 
of purchasing power parity, the Economist magazine regu-
larly compares the prices of Big Macs in different countries. If purchasing power 
parity holds, you should be able to take the dollars required to buy a Big Mac in the 
United States and exchange them for the amount of foreign cur-
rency needed to buy a Big Mac in any other country. The following 
table is for July 2011, when Big Macs were selling for an average 
price of $4.07 in the United States. The “implied exchange rate” 
shows what the xchange rate would be if purchasing power parity 
held for Big Macs. For example, a Big Mac sold for 20.0 pesos in 
Argentina  and $4.07 in the United States, so for purchasing power 
parity to hold, the exchange rate should have been 20.0 pesos/$4.07, 
or 4.91 pesos = $1. The actual exchange rate in July 2011 was 
4.13 pesos = $1. So, on Big Mac purchasing power parity grounds, 
the Argentine peso was overvalued against the dollar by 19  percent 
(((4.91 - 4.13)>4.13) * 100 = 19 percent). That is, if Big Mac 
purchasing power parity held, it would have taken 19 percent more 
Argentine pesos to buy a dollar than it actually did.
Could you take advantage of this difference between the purchasing power parity 
exchange rate and the actual exchange rate to become fabulously wealthy by buying up 
low-priced Big Macs in New York and reselling them at a higher price in Buenos Aires? 
Unfortunately, the low-priced U.S. Big Macs would be a soggy mess by the time you got 
them to Buenos Aires. The fact that Big Mac prices are not the same around the world 
illustrates one reason purchasing power parity does not hold exactly: Many goods are 
not traded internationally.

Solving the Problem
Step 1: Review the chapter material. This problem is about the theory of purchas-
ing power parity, as illustrated by prices of Big Macs, so you may want to re-
view the sections “The Theory of Purchasing Power Parity,” which begins on 
page 1017, and the Making the Connection “The Big Mac Theory of  Exchange 
Rates” on page 1018.
Step 2: Fill in the table. To calculate the purchasing power parity exchange rate, di-
vide the foreign currency price of a Big Mac by the U.S. price. For example, 
the implied exchange rate between the Brazilian real and the U.S. dollar is 
9.50 reais/$4.07, or 2.33 reais per dollar.
Solved Problem 30.2
Calculating Purchasing Power Parity  
Exchange Rates Using Big Macs
Fill in the missing values in the following table. Remember 
that the implied exchange rate shows what the exchange 
rate would be if purchasing power parity held for Big Macs. 
Assume that the Big Mac is selling for $4.07 in the United 
States. Explain whether the U.S. dollar is overvalued or un-
dervalued relative to each currency and predict what will 
happen in the future to each exchange rate. Finally, calculate 
the implied exchange rate between the Polish zloty and the 
Brazilian real (plural: reais) and explain which currency is 
undervalued in terms of Big Mac purchasing power parity.

Step 3: Explain whether the U.S. dollar is overvalued or undervalued against 
the other currencies. The dollar is overvalued if the actual exchange rate is 
greater than the implied exchange rate, and it is undervalued if the actual ex-
change rate is less than the implied exchange rate. In this case, the dollar is 
overvalued against the zloty, the won, and the ringgit, but it is undervalued 
against the real. So, we would predict that in the future the value of the dollar 
should rise against the real but fall against the zloty, the won, and the ringgit.
Step 4: Calculate the implied exchange rate between the zloty and the real. The 
implied exchange rate between the zloty and the real is 8.63 zlotys/9.50 reais, 
or 0.91 zlotys per real. We can calculate the actual exchange rate by taking 
the ratio of zlotys per dollar to reais per dollar: 2.80 zlotys/1.54 reais, or 1.82 
zlotys per real. Therefore, the zloty is undervalued relative to the real because 
our Big Mac purchasing power parity calculation tells us that it should take 
fewer zlotys to buy a real than it actually does.

The Four Determinants of Exchange Rates in the Long Run We can take 
into account the shortcomings of the theory of purchasing power parity to develop 
a more complete explanation of how exchange rates are determined in the long run. 
There are four main determinants of exchange rates in the long run:
 1. Relative price levels. The purchasing power parity theory is correct in arguing that 
in the long run, the most important determinant of exchange rates between two 
countries’ currencies is their relative price levels. If prices of goods and services rise 
faster in Canada than in the United States, the value of the Canadian dollar has to 
decline to maintain demand for Canadian products. Over the past 30 years, prices 
in Canada have risen slightly faster than average prices in the United States, while 
prices in Japan have risen more slowly. The relationship among inflation rates helps 
explain why the U.S. dollar has increased slightly in value against the Canadian dol-
lar while losing value against the Japanese yen.
 2. Relative rates of productivity growth. When the productivity of a firm increases, 
the firm is able to produce more goods and services using fewer workers, machines, 
or other inputs. The firm’s costs of production fall, and usually so do the prices of 
its products. If the average productivity of Japanese firms increases faster than the 
average productivity of U.S. firms, Japanese products will have relatively lower prices 
than U.S. products, which increases the quantity demanded of Japanese products 
relative to U.S. products. As a result, the value of the yen should rise against the 
dollar. For most of the period from the early 1970s to the early 1990s, Japanese pro-
ductivity increased faster than U.S. productivity, which contributed to the fall in the 
value of the dollar versus the yen. However, between 1992 and 2011, U.S. productiv-
ity increased faster than Japanese productivity.
 3. Preferences for domestic and foreign goods. If consumers in Canada increase their 
preferences for U.S. products, the demand for U.S. dollars will increase relative to the 
demand for Canadian dollars, and the U.S. dollar will increase in value relative to the 
Canadian dollar. During the 1970s and 1980s, many U.S. consumers increased their 
preferences for Japanese products, particularly automobiles and consumer electron-
ics. This greater preference for Japanese products helped to increase the value of the 
yen relative to the dollar.
 4. Tariffs and quotas. The U.S. sugar quota forces firms such as Hershey Foods Cor-
poration to buy expensive U.S. sugar rather than less expensive foreign sugar. The 
quota increases the demand for dollars relative to the currencies of foreign sugar 
producers and, therefore, leads to a higher exchange rate. Changes in tariffs and 
quotas have not been a significant factor in explaining trends in the U.S. dollar– 
Canadian dollar or U.S. dollar–yen exchange rates.
Because these four factors change over time, the value of one country’s currency can 
increase or decrease by substantial amounts in the long run. These changes in exchange 
rates can create problems for firms. A decline in the value of a country’s currency lowers 
the foreign currency prices of the country’s exports and increases the prices of imports. 
An increase in the value of a country’s currency has the reverse effect. Firms can be both 
helped and hurt by exchange rate fluctuations.
The Euro
A second key aspect of the current exchange rate system is that most Western European 
countries have adopted a single currency. After World War II, many of the countries of 
Western Europe wanted to more closely integrate their economies. In 1957, Belgium, 
France, West Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands signed the Treaty of 
Rome, which established the European Economic Community, often referred to as 
the European Common Market. Tariffs and quotas on products being shipped within 
the European Common Market were greatly reduced. Over the years, Britain, Sweden, 
 Denmark, Finland, Austria, Greece, Ireland, Spain, and Portugal joined the European 
Economic Community, which was renamed the European Union (EU) in 1991. By 2011, 
27 countries were members of the EU.

 
The Current Exchange Rate System 
1021
EU members decided to move to a common currency beginning in 1999. Three of 
the 15 countries that were then members of the EU—the United Kingdom, Denmark, 
and Sweden—decided to retain their domestic currencies. The move to a common cur-
rency took place in several stages. On January 1, 1999, the exchange rates of the 12 par-
ticipating countries (risen to 17 in 2011) were permanently fixed against each other and 
against the common currency, the euro. At first the euro was a pure unit of account. No 
euro currency was actually in circulation, although firms began quoting prices in both 
the domestic currency and euros. On January 1, 2002, euro coins and paper currency 
were introduced, and on June 1, 2002, the old domestic currencies were withdrawn 
from circulation. Figure 30.2 shows the countries in the EU that had adopted the euro as 
of 2011. These countries are sometimes referred to as the “euro zone.”
A new European Central Bank (ECB) was also established. Although the central 
banks of the member countries continue to exist, the ECB has assumed responsibility 
for monetary policy and for issuing currency. The ECB is run by a governing council 
that consists of a six-member executive board—appointed by the participating govern-
ments—and the governors of the central banks of the 17 member countries that have 
adopted the euro. The ECB represents a unique experiment in allowing a multinational 
organization to control the domestic monetary policies of independent countries.

Can the Euro Survive?
The euro was first introduced as a currency at the begin-
ning of 2002. The period from then until the beginning of 
the global economic downturn at the end of 2007 was one of 
relative economic stability in most of Europe. With low inter-
est rates, low inflation rates, and expanding employment and production, the advan-
tages of the euro seemed obvious. The countries using the euro no longer had to deal 
with problems caused by fluctuating exchange rates. Having a common currency also 
makes it easier for consumers and firms to buy and sell across borders. It is no longer

necessary for someone in France to exchange francs for marks in 
order to do business in Germany. Having a single currency re-
duces costs and increases competition. Some of the lower-income 
European countries seemed to particularly prosper under the 
euro. The Spanish economy grew at a rate of 3.9 percent between 
1999 and 2007. The unemployment rate in Spain had been nearly 
20 percent in the mid-1990s, but it had dropped to 7.9 percent in 
2007. Ireland and Greece also experienced rapid growth during 
these years.
But by 2008, with the global recession gathering force, some 
economists and policymakers were starting to question whether 
the euro was making the economic crisis worse. The countries 
using the euro are not able to pursue independent monetary 
policies, which are instead determined by the ECB from its head-
quarters in Frankfurt, Germany. Countries that were particularly hard hit by the re-
cession—for example, Spain, where the unemployment rate had more than doubled to 
18 percent by 2009 and was nearly 21 percent in 2011—were unable to pursue a more 
expansionary policy than the ECB was willing to implement for the euro zone as a 
whole. Similarly, countries could not attempt to revive their exports by allowing their 
exchange rates to depreciate because (1) most of their exports were to other euro zone 
countries, and (2) the value of the euro was determined by factors affecting the euro 
zone as a whole.
Problems in the euro zone were made worse by a sovereign debt crisis that devel-
oped in 2010. Sovereign debt refers to bonds issued by a government. The recession of 
2007–2009 caused large increases in government spending and reductions in tax rev-
enues in a number of European countries, particularly Greece, Ireland, Spain, Portugal, 
and Italy. The resulting government budget deficits were paid for by issuing government 
bonds. By the spring of 2010, many investors had come to doubt the ability of Greece, in 
particular, to make the interest payments on the bonds. If Greece defaulted and stopped 
making interest payments on its bonds, investors would be likely to stop buying bonds is-
sued by several other European governments, and the continuation of the euro would be 
called into question. The ECB helped Greece avoid a default by  directly buying its bonds. 
The bank extended similar help to Spain, Ireland, and Italy. The International Mone-
tary Fund and the European Union put together aid packages meant to keep Greece and 
other countries from defaulting. In exchange for the aid, these countries were required 
to cut government spending and raise taxes even though doing so resulted in signifi-
cant protests from unions, students, and other groups. In late 2011, it was not yet clear 
whether the actions the European Union had taken would be sufficient to keep Greece 
and possibly other countries from defaulting on their bonds.
During the years of the gold standard, countries couldn’t run expansionary mon-
etary policies and were unable to have their exchange rates depreciate. During the Great 
Depression of the 1930s, these drawbacks to remaining on the gold standard led one 
country after another to abandon it, and by the mid-1930s, the gold standard had col-
lapsed. In 2011, some economists and policymakers were predicting a similar abandon-
ment of the euro. There were significant reasons, though, that no government had yet 
been willing to consider reverting from the euro to its own currency. Because many 
euro zone countries export a significant fraction of GDP to other euro zone countries, 
exchange rate stability has been important to their economic stability, making these 
countries reluctant to abandon the euro. In addition, some of the European countries 
hit hardest by the recession, particularly Spain and Ireland, were suffering from the 
bursting of housing bubbles. More expansionary monetary policies or depreciating ex-
change rates were unlikely to result in economic recovery until the effects of the collapse 
in residential construction had run its course. So, it was unclear that the constraints 
imposed by the euro were holding back recovery in Europe. Finally, because so many 
contracts and agreements among households, firms, and governments in Europe were 
written in euros, abandoning the euro was likely to be disruptive to the financial system 
and to trade.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, 
then Greek Prime Minister George 
Papandreou, left, and French 
President Nicolas Sarkozy debated 
how to handle Greece’s financial 
rescue.

 
The Current Exchange Rate System 
1023
Pegging against the Dollar
A final key aspect of the current exchange rate system is that some developing countries 
have attempted to keep their exchange rates fixed against the dollar or another major 
currency. Having a fixed exchange rate can provide important advantages for a country 
that has extensive trade with another country. When the exchange rate is fixed, business 
planning becomes much easier. For instance, if the South Korean won increases in value 
relative to the dollar, Hyundai, the Korean car manufacturer, may have to raise the dol-
lar price of cars it exports to the United States, thereby reducing sales. If the exchange 
rate between the Korean won and the dollar is fixed, Hyundai’s planning is much easier.
In the 1980s and 1990s, an additional reason developed for having fixed exchange 
rates. During those decades, the flow of foreign investment funds to developing coun-
tries, particularly those in East Asia, increased substantially. It became possible for firms 
in countries such as Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia to borrow dollars directly 
from foreign investors or indirectly from foreign banks. For example, a Thai firm might 
borrow U.S. dollars from a Japanese bank. If the Thai firm wants to build a new factory 
in Thailand with the borrowed dollars, it has to exchange the dollars for the equiva-
lent amount of Thai currency, the baht. When the factory opens and production begins, 
the Thai firm will be earning the additional baht it needs to exchange for dollars to 
make the interest payments on the loan. A problem arises if the value of the baht falls 
against the dollar. Suppose that the exchange rate is 25 baht per dollar when the firm 
takes out the loan. A Thai firm making an interest payment of $100,000 per month on 
a dollar loan could buy the necessary dollars for 2.5 million baht. But if the value of the 
baht declines to 50 baht to the dollar, it would take 5 million baht to buy the dollars 
necessary to make the interest payment. These increased payments might be a crushing 
burden for the Thai firm. The government of Thailand would have a strong incentive to 
avoid this problem by keeping the exchange rate between the baht and the dollar fixed.
Finally, in the 1980s and 1990s, some countries feared the inflationary consequences 
of a floating exchange rate. When the value of a currency falls, the prices of imports rise. 
If imports are a significant fraction of the goods consumers buy, a fall in the value of the 
currency may significantly increase the inflation rate. During the 1990s, an important 
part of Brazil’s and Argentina’s anti-inflation policies was a fixed exchange rate against 
the dollar. (As we will see, though, there are difficulties with following a fixed exchange 
rate policy, and, ultimately, both Brazil and Argentina abandoned fixed exchange rates.)
The East Asian Exchange Rate Crisis of the Late 1990s When a country 
keeps its currency’s exchange rate fixed against another country’s currency, it is pegging 
its currency. It is not necessary for both countries involved in a peg to agree to it. When 
a developing country has pegged the value of its currency against the dollar, the respon-
sibility for maintaining the peg has been entirely with the developing country.
Countries attempting to maintain a peg can run into problems, however. We saw 
in Chapter 4 that when the government fixes the price of a good or service, the result 
can be persistent surpluses or shortages. Figure 30.3 shows the exchange rate between 
the dollar and the Thai baht. The figure is drawn from the Thai point of view, so we 
measure the exchange rate on the vertical axis as dollars per baht. The figure represents 
the situation in the 1990s, when the government of Thailand pegged the exchange rate

dent countries with diverse economies can successfully maintain a joint monetary pol-
icy and a single currency.

between the dollar and the baht above the equilibrium exchange rate, as determined 
by demand and supply. A currency pegged at a value above the market equilibrium ex-
change rate is said to be overvalued. A currency pegged at a value below the market 
equilibrium exchange rate is said to be undervalued.
Pegging made it easier for Thai firms to export products to the United States and 
protected Thai firms that had taken out dollar loans. The pegged exchange rate was 25.19 
baht to the dollar, or about $0.04 to the baht. By 1997, this exchange rate was well above 
the market equilibrium exchange rate of 35 baht to the dollar, or about $0.03 to the baht. 
The result was a surplus of baht on the foreign exchange market. To keep the exchange 
rate at the pegged level, the Thai central bank, the Bank of Thailand, had to buy these 
baht with dollars. In doing so, the Bank of Thailand gradually used up its holdings of 
dollars, or its dollar reserves. To continue supporting the pegged exchange rate, the Bank 
of  Thailand borrowed additional dollar reserves from the International Monetary Fund 
(IMF). The Bank of Thailand also raised interest rates to attract more foreign investors 
to investments in Thailand, thereby increasing the demand for the baht. The Bank of 
 Thailand took these actions even though allowing the value of the baht to decline against 
the dollar would have helped Thai firms exporting to the United States by reducing the 
dollar prices of their goods. The Thai government was afraid of the negative conse-
quences of abandoning the peg even though the peg had led to the baht being overvalued.
Although higher domestic interest rates helped attract foreign investors, they made 
it more difficult for Thai firms and households to borrow the funds they needed to 
 finance their spending. As a consequence, domestic investment and consumption de-
clined, pushing the Thai economy into recession. International investors realized that 
there were limits to how high the Bank of Thailand would be willing to push inter-
est rates and how many dollar loans the IMF would be willing to extend to Thailand. 
These investors began to speculate against the baht by exchanging baht for dollars at the 
 official, pegged exchange rate. If, as they expected, Thailand was forced to abandon the 
peg, they would be able to buy back the baht at a much lower exchange rate, making a 
substantial profit. Because these actions by investors make it more difficult to maintain 
a fixed exchange rate, they are referred to as destabilizing speculation. Figure 30.4 shows 
the results of this destabilizing speculation. The decreased demand for baht shifted 
the demand curve for baht from D1 to D2, increasing the quantity of baht the Bank of 
 Thailand needed to buy in exchange for dollars.
Foreign investors also began to sell off their investments in Thailand and exchange 
the baht they received for dollars. This capital flight forced the Bank of Thailand to run 
through its dollar reserves. Dollar loans from the IMF temporarily allowed Thailand 
to defend the pegged exchange rate. Finally, on July 2, 1997, Thailand abandoned its

By 1997, the Thai Baht Was

The government of Thailand pegged the 
value of the baht against the dollar to make 
it easier for Thai firms to export to the 
United States and to protect Thai firms that 
had taken out dollar loans. The pegged ex-
change rate of $0.04 per baht was well above 
the equilibrium exchange rate of $0.03 per 
baht. In the example in this figure, the over-
valued exchange rate created a surplus of 70 
million baht, which the Thai central bank 
had to purchase with dollars.

pegged exchange rate against the dollar and allowed the baht to float. Thai firms that 
had borrowed dollars were now faced with interest payments that were much higher 
than they had planned. Many firms were forced into bankruptcy, and the Thai economy 
plunged into a deep recession.
Many currency traders became convinced that other East Asian countries, such 
as South Korea, Indonesia, and Malaysia, would have to follow Thailand and abandon 
their pegged exchange rates. The result was a wave of speculative selling of these coun-
tries’ currencies. These waves of selling—sometimes referred to as speculative attacks—
were difficult for countries to fight off. Even if a country’s currency was not initially 
overvalued at the pegged exchange rate, the speculative attacks would cause a large 
reduction in the demand for the country’s currency. The demand curve for the cur-
rency would shift to the left, which would force the country’s central bank to quickly 
run through its dollar reserves. Within a few months, South Korea, Indonesia, the 
Philippines, and Malaysia abandoned their pegged currencies. All these countries also 
plunged into recession.
The Decline in Pegging Following the disastrous events experienced by the East 
Asian countries, the number of countries with pegged exchange rates declined sharply. 
Most countries that continue to use pegged exchange rates are small and trade primarily 
with a single, much larger, country. So, for instance, several Caribbean countries con-
tinue to peg against the dollar, and several former French colonies in Africa that for-
merly pegged against the French franc now peg against the euro. Overall, the trend has 
been toward replacing pegged exchange rates with managed floating exchange rates.
The Chinese Experience with Pegging As we discussed in Chapter 22, in 1978, 
China began to move away from central planning and toward a market system. The 
result was a sharp acceleration in economic growth. Real GDP per capita grew at a rate 
of 6.5 percent per year between 1979 and 1995 and at the very rapid rate of more than 9 
percent per year between 1996 and 2010. An important part of Chinese economic policy 
was the decision in 1994 to peg the value of the Chinese currency, the yuan, to the dollar 
at a fixed rate of 8.28 yuan to the dollar. Pegging against the dollar ensured that Chinese 
exporters would face stable dollar prices for the goods they sold in the United States. 
By the early 2000s, many economists argued that the yuan was undervalued against the 
dollar, possibly significantly so. Many U.S. firms claimed that the undervaluation of the 
yuan gave Chinese firms an unfair advantage in competing with U.S. firms.
To support the undervalued exchange rate, the Chinese central bank had to buy 
large amounts of dollars with yuan. By 2005, the Chinese government had accumulated

Destabilizing Speculation 
against the Thai Baht
In 1997, the pegged exchange rate of 
$0.04 = 1 baht was above the equilibrium 
exchange rate of $0.03 = 1 baht. As investors 
became convinced that Thailand would have 
to abandon its pegged exchange rate against 
the dollar and allow the value of the baht to 
fall, they decreased their demand for baht, 
causing the demand curve to shift from D1 
to D2. The new equilibrium exchange rate be-
came $0.02 = 1 baht. To defend the pegged 
exchange rate, the Bank of Thailand had to 
increase the quantity of baht it purchased in 
exchange for dollars from 70 million per day 
to 140  million. The destablizing speculation 
by investors caused Thailand to abandon its 
pegged exchange rate in July 1997.

more than $700 billion, a good portion of which it had used to buy U.S. Treasury bonds. 
In addition, China was coming under pressure from its trading partners to allow the 
yuan to increase in value. Chinese exports of textile products were driving some textile 
producers out of business in Japan, the United States, and Europe. China had also be-
gun to export more sophisticated products, including televisions, personal computers, 
and cell phones. Politicians in other countries were anxious to protect their domestic 
industries from Chinese competition, even if the result was higher prices for domestic 
consumers. The Chinese government was reluctant to revalue the yuan, however, be-
cause it believed high levels of exports were needed to maintain rapid economic growth. 
The Chinese economy needs to create as many as 20 million new nonagricultural jobs 
per year to keep up with population growth and the shift of workers from rural areas to 
cities. Because of China’s large holdings of dollars, it would also incur significant losses 
if the yuan increases in value.
By July 2005, the pressure on China to revalue the yuan had become too great. The 
government announced that it would switch from pegging the yuan against the dollar to 
linking the value of the yuan to the average value of a basket of currencies—the dollar, 
the Japanese yen, the euro, the Korean won, and several other currencies. The immedi-
ate effect was a fairly small increase in the value of the yuan from 8.28 to the dollar to 
8.11 to the dollar. The Chinese central bank declared that it had switched from a peg to 
a managed floating exchange rate. Some economists and policymakers were skeptical, 
however, that much had actually changed because the initial increase in the value of the 
yuan had been small and because the Chinese central bank did not explain the details 
of how the yuan would be linked to the basket of other currencies. By late 2011, the 
value of the yuan had slowly increased to 6.38 to the dollar. Despite this increase, some 
economists and policymakers still believed that the yuan was overvalued and urged 
the Chinese government to allow its currency to become more responsive to changes in 
demand and supply in the foreign exchange markets.
Crisis and Recovery in South Korea
Korea spent the first part of the twentieth century as a colony 
of Japan. In 1945, at the end of World War II, Korea was di-
vided into Communist North Korea and democratic South 
Korea. North Korea’s invasion of South Korea in June 1950 set 
off the Korean War, which devastated South Korea, before ending in 1953. Despite these 
difficult beginnings, by the 1960s, the South Korean economy was growing rapidly. As 
one of the newly industrializing countries, South Korea was a model for other developing 
countries.
To make it easier for firms such as Hyundai to export to the United States and to 
protect firms that had taken out dollar loans, the South Korean government pegged the 
value of its currency, the won, to the U.S. dollar. Following Thailand’s decision in July 
1997 to abandon its peg, large-scale destabilizing speculation took place against the 
won. Foreign investors scrambled to sell their investments in Korea and to convert their 
won into dollars. South Korea was unable to defend the peg and allowed the won to float 
in October 1997.
Like other countries that underwent exchange rate crises, South Korea had at-
tempted to maintain the value of the won by raising domestic interest rates. The result 
was a sharp decline in aggregate demand and a severe recession. However, unlike other 
East Asian countries—particularly Thailand and Indonesia—that made only slow prog-
ress in recovering from exchange rate crises, South Korea bounced back rapidly. The 
figure on the next page shows that after experiencing falling real GDP through 1999, 
South Korea quickly returned to high rates of growth.
Why was the performance of South Korea so much better than that of other East 
Asian countries? Jahyeong Koo and Sherry L. Kiser, economists at the Federal Reserve 
Bank of Dallas, cite several factors:
• South Korea benefited from a $21 billion loan from the IMF in December 1997. This 
loan helped stabilize the value of the won.

International Capital Markets
One important reason exchange rates fluctuate is that investors seek out the best invest-
ments they can find anywhere in the world. For instance, if Chinese investors increase 
their demand for U.S. Treasury bills, the demand for dollars will increase, and the value 
of the dollar will rise. But if interest rates in the United States decline, foreign investors 
may sell U.S. investments, and the value of the dollar will fall.
Shares of stock and long-term debt, including corporate and government bonds and 
bank loans, are bought and sold on capital markets. Before 1980, most U.S. corporations 
raised funds only in U.S. stock and bond markets or from U.S. banks. U.S. investors 
rarely invested in foreign capital markets. In the 1980s and 1990s, European govern-
ments removed many restrictions on foreign investments in their financial markets. It 
became possible for U.S. and other foreign investors to freely invest in Europe and for 
European investors to freely invest in foreign markets. Improvements in communica-
tions and computer technology made it possible for U.S. investors to receive better and 
more timely information about foreign firms and for foreign investors to receive better 
information about U.S. firms. The growth in economies around the world also made 
more savings available to be invested.
Although at one time the U.S. capital market was larger than all other capital mar-
kets combined, this is no longer true. Today there are large capital markets in Europe

and Japan, and there are smaller markets in Latin America and East Asia. The three 
most important international financial centers today are New York, London, and Tokyo. 
Each day, the Wall Street Journal provides data not just on the Dow Jones Industrial Av-
erage and the Standard & Poor’s 500 stock indexes of U.S. stocks but also on the Nikkei 
225 average of Japanese stocks, the FTSE 100 index of stocks on the London Stock Ex-
change, and the DJ STOXX 50 index of European stocks. By 2011, corporations, banks, 
and governments had raised more than $1 trillion in funds on global financial markets.
Beginning in the 1990s, the flow of foreign funds into U.S. stocks and bonds—or 
portfolio investments—increased substantially. As Figure 30.5 shows, foreign purchases 
of stocks and bonds issued by corporations and bonds issued by the federal government 
increased dramatically between 1995 and 2007. In 2010, however, foreign purchases of 
U.S. corporate stocks and bonds declined sharply, as the slow recovery in the United 
States from the recession of 2007–2009 increased the degree of risk foreign investors 
saw in holding these securities. Foreign purchases of U.S. government bonds soared, 
however, as fears that some European governments might default on their bonds led in-
vestors to a flight to safety, in which they sold other investments to buy U.S. government 
bonds. The fact that the United States continued to run large current account deficits 
also fueled some of the demand for U.S. government bonds. These current account defi-
cits led to an accumulation of dollars by foreign central banks and foreign investors who 
used the dollars to purchase U.S. government bonds.
Figure 30.6 shows the distribution during 2010 of foreign portfolio investment in 
the United States by country. Investors in the United Kingdom accounted for about half 
of all foreign purchases of U.S. stocks and bonds. The two other countries with the larg-
est shares of foreign purchases were Japan, with 18 percent, and China, with 7 percent.

Conclusion 
1029
The globalization of financial markets has helped increase growth and efficiency in 
the world economy. Now it is possible for the savings of households around the world 
to be channeled to the best investments available. It is also possible for firms in nearly 
every country to tap the savings of foreign households to gain the funds needed for ex-
pansion. No longer are firms forced to rely only on the savings of domestic households 
to finance investment.
But the globalization of financial markets also has a downside, as the events of 
2007–2009 showed. Because financial securities issued in one country are held by inves-
tors and firms in many other countries, if those securities decline in value, the financial 
pain will be widely distributed. For example, the sharp decline in the value of mortgage-
backed securities issued in the United States hurt not only U.S. investors and financial 
firms but investors and financial firms in many other countries as well.

At the beginning of the chapter, we posed this question: If economists are correct about the rela-
tive rates of average productivity growth between Spain and the United States in the next decade, 
then, all else being equal, will the savings that you accumulate (in euros) be worth more or less in 
U.S. dollars than it would have been worth without the relative gains in Spanish productivity? To 
answer this question, we saw in this chapter that when the average productivity of firms in one 
country increases faster than the average productivity of firms in another country, the value of the 
faster-growing country’s currency should—all else being equal—rise against the slower-growing 
country’s currency. Of course, Spain is only 1 of the 17 countries using the euro, so the impact of 
productivity increases in Spain on the value of the euro may not be large. But the savings that you 
accumulate in euros while you are in Spain are likely to be worth more in U.S. dollars than they 
would have been worth without the gains in Spanish productivity.
Conclusion
Fluctuations in exchange rates continue to cause difficulties for firms and governments. 
From the gold standard to the Bretton Woods system to currency pegging, governments 
have attempted to find a workable system of fixed exchange rates. Fixing exchange rates 
runs into the same problems as fixing any other price: As demand and supply shift, sur-
pluses and shortages will occur unless the price adjusts. Seventeen countries in Europe 
are attempting to avoid this problem by using a single currency. Economists are looking 
closely at the results of that experiment.

aimed at raising tariffs on goods from China in response to claims that country’s cur-
rency was undervalued.

could damage the full array of U.S.–
Chinese cooperation. That ranges 
from efforts to protect U.S. intellectual 
property rights in China to assuring 
the security of Taiwan and keeping 
the Korean Peninsula peaceful. . . .
 The currency legislation would 
set in motion the imposition of higher 
tariffs on a country if the U.S. Treasury 
Department decides its currency is “mis-
aligned” and the country does not act to 
correct it. Currently, Treasury must re-
solve that a country is willfully manipu-
lating its currency, a higher bar to reach, 
before sanctions can be considered.
The bill also makes it easier for 
specific industries to petition the 
Commerce Department for redress if 
they believe an exchange rate is giving 
a foreign competitor the equivalent of 
an export subsidy.
Beijing has said repeatedly it is 
pushing ahead reforms of its exchange 
rate controls but says it will set the 
pace. Chinese leaders have warned 
that an abrupt rise in the yuan could 
lead to job losses and fuel unrest.
The yuan’s value has been allowed 
to rise by about 5 percent against the 
dollar over the past year in tightly 
controlled trading. The rise has quick-
ened in recent weeks.
On Wednesday, China’s central 
bank issued a statement defending its 
currency controls as an “important 
contribution” to international finan-
cial stability.

 U.S. manufacturers complain 
that Beijing’s controls keep the yuan 
undervalued by up to 40 percent. They 
say that gives China’s exporters an un-
fair price advantage and hurts foreign 
competitors, eroding American em-
ployment. The currency bill’s support-
ers say it would support creation of 1 
million jobs in the United States.
American critics of the bill have 
warned Beijing might retaliate, hurt-
ing U.S. companies in China’s rela-
tively robust markets, which are a rare 
bright spot for exporters amid weak 
demand elsewhere.
If it becomes law, “Sino–U.S. eco-
nomic and trade relations will inevita-
bly be severely damaged,” Commerce 
Ministry spokesman Shen Dayang 
said in a statement.
Some opponents of the measure 
argue that currency sanctions would 
do little to help the U.S. job market 
because Chinese goods would simply 
be replaced by goods from other low-
wage countries such as Vietnam and 
Bangladesh.
Ma, the Foreign Ministry spokes-
man, said the measure violates World 
Trade Organization rules.
“It not only cannot solve the 
problems in the U.S. economy or un-
employment, but will seriously im-
pede Sino–U.S. economic and trade 
ties and impede the joint efforts that 
China, the U.S. and the international 
community have made to enable a 
strong recovery and the growth of the 
global economy,” Ma said.

possible response but have warned in

Currency Bill as 
Threat to Trade
China criticized an American 
currency bill as a threat to a shaky 
global economic recovery and warned 
Wednesday that trade ties will be 
 “severely damaged” if it becomes law.
Beijing rejected the measure 
passed Tuesday by the Senate as a 
form of damaging protectionism at 
a time when other nations are trying 
to sustain free trade. The bill would 
allow Washington to raise tariffs on 
Chinese imports that critics say are 
unfairly cheap due to Beijing’s ex-
change-rate controls and are destroy-
ing U.S. jobs.
“It is completely harmful and 
unbeneficial,” said Foreign Ministry 
spokesman Ma Zhaoxu in a state-
ment. Ma said it would do nothing 
to reduce U.S. unemployment and 
would disrupt global efforts to revive 
 economic growth.
Tuesday’s 63–35 Senate vote 
showed a bipartisan consensus in fa-
vor of tougher action against Beijing 
after years of diplomatic pressure and 
a gradual rise in China’s currency, the 
yuan, that critics say is inadequate.
Still, the bill is unlikely to become 
law because it lacks the support of the 
majority Republican leadership in 
the lower House of Representatives, 
who are reluctant to take up the mea-
sure. The White House and President 
Barack Obama have not come out 
against the bill but have shown they 
are uncomfortable with it.

c The U.S. Treasury is required by law to 
investigate whether any country unfairly 
manipulates its currency. If it became law, 
the Senate bill would impose higher tariffs 
on countries if the Treasury Department de-
termined that a currency is “misaligned” 
and the country took no corrective action. 
The bill also would make it easier for manu-
facturing firms to petition for sanctions if 
they believe a country is undervaluing its 
currency and giving foreign manufacturers 
what amounts to an export subsidy. China 
is the largest creditor of the United States, 
with holdings of more than $1.1 trillion in 
Treasury securities as of August 2011.
Thinking Critically 
about Policy
1. Supporters of the tariff bill discussed in 
this article claim that the yuan is under-
valued, and tariffs on Chinese products 
would save jobs in the United States. 
Would passage of the bill hurt anyone in 
the United States? Briefly explain.
2. China is currently the largest creditor of 
the United States, with holdings of more 
than $1 trillion in U.S. Treasury securities  
in 2011. Suppose the Senate tariff bill 
were signed into law and China retaliated 
by selling all of its holdings of U.S. Trea-
sury securities. How would interest rates 
in the United States be affected? How 
would the exchange rate of the U.S. dol-
lar be affected? Briefly explain.
undervalued in order to keep the prices of 
its exports low. The figure below shows the 
value of the yuan against the U.S. dollar. Af-
ter 2005, the appreciation of the yuan 
against the dollar was relatively modest in 
comparison with the growing U.S. trade 
deficits with China. As you read in this 
chapter, the Chinese central bank has man-
aged to keep the yuan at relatively low lev-
els by buying large amounts of U.S. dollars 
with yuan. An increase in the U.S. trade def-
icit with China caused an increase in the 
supply of dollars in the foreign exchange 
market. Without any government interven-
tion, the exchange rate between the U.S. 
dollar and the yuan might have dropped be-
low 6 yuan per dollar. By increasing the de-
mand for dollars in exchange for yuan, the 
Chinese government was able to keep the 
exchange rate  between 6 and 7 yuan per 
dollar.
b U.S. manufacturers supporting the tariff 
bill claim that the Chinese yuan is un-
dervalued by up to 40 percent, and this has 
given Chinese exporters an unfair advan-
tage in competing with U.S. firms, leading 
to job losses. Supporters of the bill claim it 
would help create 1 million jobs in the 
United States. Critics have warned that Chi-
nese retaliation could hurt U.S. companies 
that currently export to China and lead to 
unemployment in those exporting 
industries.
Key Points in the Article
China was the main target of a U.S. Senate 
bill to raise tariffs. Many politicians claimed 
that China had manipulated its currency to 
give Chinese exporters an unfair advantage 
over U.S. companies. Politicians and U.S. 
manufacturers supporting the bill argued 
that the Chinese yuan was undervalued 
by up to 40 percent, leading to job losses 
in the United States. Some opponents of 
the bill claimed that the sanctions would 
do little to help employment in the United 
States because the targeted Chinese prod-
ucts would just be replaced by goods from 
other countries. China said that the bill vio-
lates World Trade Organization rules and 
might retaliate should the bill become law. 
However, the bill was not expected to pass 
in the House of Representatives, nor did it 
get support from the Obama White House.
Analyzing the News
a In October 2011, the U.S. Senate 
passed a bill that would allow U.S. 
companies to apply for tariffs on imports 
from countries that deliberately underval-
ued their currencies in order to become 
more competitive. As you read in this chap-
ter, a currency is said to be undervalued if it 
is pegged at a value below the market equi-
librium exchange rate. Many politicians 
claimed that China kept its currency

dollar relative to other currencies. Purchasing power parity does 
not provide a complete explanation of movements in exchange 
rates for several reasons, including the existence of tariffs and 
quotas. A tariff is a tax imposed by a government on imports. A 
quota is a government-imposed limit on the quantity of a good 
that can be imported. Currently, 17 European Union member 
countries use a common currency, known as the euro. The ex-

Summary
The current exchange rate system has three key aspects: (1) The 
U.S. dollar floats against other major currencies, (2) most coun-
tries in Western Europe have adopted a common currency, and 
(3) some developing countries have fixed their currencies’ ex-
change rates against the dollar or against another major currency. 
Since 1973, the value of the U.S. dollar has fluctuated widely 
against other major currencies. The theory of purchasing power 
parity states that in the long run, exchange rates move to equalize 
the purchasing power of different currencies. This theory helps to

macroeconomic events of the 1930s and about the possible 
problems with carrying out an expansionary monetary 
policy while remaining on the gold standard.)

Summary
When countries agree on how exchange rates should be deter-
mined, economists say that there is an exchange rate system. A 
floating currency is the outcome of a country allowing its curren-
cy’s exchange rate to be determined by demand and supply. The 
current exchange rate system is a managed float exchange rate 
system, under which the value of most currencies is determined 
by demand and supply, with occasional government intervention. 
A fixed exchange rate system is a system under which countries 
agree to keep the exchange rates among their currencies fixed. 
Under the gold standard, the exchange rate between two curren-
cies was automatically determined by the quantity of gold in each 
currency. By the end of the Great Depression of the 1930s, every 
country had abandoned the gold standard. Under the  Bretton 
Woods system, which was in place between 1944 and the early 
1970s, the United States agreed to exchange dollars for gold at a 
price of $35 per ounce. The central banks of all other members of 
the system pledged to buy and sell their currencies at a fixed rate 
against the dollar.

 When a country keeps its currency’s exchange rate fixed 
against another country’s currency, it is pegging its cur-
rency. Pegging can result in problems similar to the prob-
lems countries encountered with fixed exchange rates 
under the Bretton Woods system. If investors become 
convinced that a country pegging its exchange rate will 
eventually allow the exchange rate to decline to a lower 
level, the demand curve for the currency will shift to the 
left. This illustrates the difficulty of maintaining a fixed ex-
change rate in the face of destabilizing speculation.

dollar. In January 2002, the government decided to aban-

ment bonds have increased greatly in the period since 1995. As a 
result, firms around the world are no longer forced to rely only on 
the savings of domestic households for funds.

Appendix
The Gold Standard and the Bretton 
Woods System
The Gold Standard and the Bretton  
Woods System
It is easier to understand the current exchange rate system by considering further two 
earlier systems, the gold standard and the Bretton Woods system, which together lasted 
from the early nineteenth century through the early 1970s.
The Gold Standard
As we saw in this chapter, under the gold standard, the currency of a country consisted 
of gold coins and paper currency that could be redeemed for gold. Great Britain ad-
opted the gold standard in 1816, but as late as 1870, only a few nations had followed. In 
the late nineteenth century, however, Great Britain’s share of world trade had increased, 
as had its overseas investments. The dominant position of Great Britain in the world 
economy motivated other countries to adopt the gold standard. By 1913, every country 
in Europe, except Spain and Bulgaria, and most countries in the Western Hemisphere 
had adopted the gold standard.
Under the gold standard, the exchange rate between two currencies was automati-
cally determined by the quantity of gold in each currency. If there was 1/5 ounce of gold 
in a U.S. dollar and 1 ounce of gold in a British pound, the price of gold in the United 
States would be $5 per ounce, and the price of gold in Britain would be £1 per ounce. 
The exchange rate would therefore be +5 = £1.
The End of the Gold Standard
From a modern point of view, the greatest drawback to the gold standard was that the 
central bank lacked control of the money supply. The size of a country’s money supply 
depended on its gold supply, which could be greatly affected by chance discoveries of 
gold or by technological change in gold mining. For example, the gold discoveries in 
California in 1849 and Alaska in the 1890s caused rapid increases in the U.S. money 
supply. Because the central bank cannot determine how much gold will be discovered, 
it lacks the control of the money supply necessary to pursue an active monetary pol-
icy. During wartime, countries usually went off the gold standard to allow their central 
banks to expand the money supply as rapidly as was necessary to pay for the war. Britain 
abandoned the gold standard at the beginning of World War I in 1914 and did not re-
sume redeeming its paper currency for gold until 1925.
When the Great Depression began in 1929, governments came under pressure 
to abandon the gold standard to allow their central banks to pursue active monetary 
policies. In 1931, Great Britain became the first major country to abandon the gold 
standard. A number of other countries also went off the gold standard that year. The 
United States remained on the gold standard until 1933, and a few countries, including 
France, Italy, and Belgium, stayed on even longer. By the late 1930s, the gold standard 
had collapsed.
The earlier a country abandoned the gold standard, the easier time it had fight-
ing the Depression with expansionary monetary policies. The countries that abandoned 
the gold standard by 1932 suffered an average decline in production of only 3 percent 
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Appendix The Gold Standard and the Bretton Woods System

between 1929 and 1934. The countries that stayed on the gold standard until 1933 or 
later suffered an average decline of more than 30 percent. The devastating economic 
performance of the countries that stayed on the gold standard the longest during the 
1930s is the key reason no attempt was made to bring back the gold standard in later 
years.
The Bretton Woods System
In addition to the collapse of the gold standard, the global economy suffered during 
the 1930s from tariff wars. The United States had started the tariff wars in June 1930 by 
enacting the Smoot–Hawley Tariff, which raised the average U.S. tariff rate to more than 
50 percent. Many other countries raised tariffs during the next few years, leading to a 
collapse in world trade.
As World War II was coming to an end, economists and government officials in 
the United States and Europe concluded that they needed to restore the international 
economic system to avoid another depression. In 1947, the United States and most other 
major countries, apart from the Soviet Union, began participating in the General Agree-
ment on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), under which they worked to reduce trade barriers. 
The GATT was very successful in sponsoring rounds of negotiations among countries, 
which led to sharp declines in tariffs. U.S. tariffs dropped from an average rate of more 
than 50 percent in the early 1930s to an average rate of less than 2 percent in 2011. 
In 1995, the GATT was replaced by the World Trade Organization (WTO), which has 
similar objectives.
The effort to develop a new exchange rate system to replace the gold standard 
was more complicated than establishing the GATT. A conference held in Bretton 
Woods, New Hampshire, in 1944 set up a system in which the United States pledged 
to buy or sell gold at a fixed price of $35 per ounce. The central banks of all other 
members of the new Bretton Woods system pledged to buy and sell their curren-
cies at a fixed rate against the dollar. By fixing their exchange rates against the dollar, 
these countries were fixing the exchange rates among their currencies as well. Unlike 
under the gold standard, neither the United States nor any other country was willing 
to redeem its paper currency for gold domestically. The United States would redeem 
dollars for gold only if they were presented by a foreign central bank. The United 
States continued the prohibition, first enacted in the early 1930s, against private citi-
zens owning gold, unless they were jewelers or rare coin collectors. The prohibition 
was not lifted until the 1970s, when it again became possible for Americans to own 
gold as an investment.
Under the Bretton Woods system, central banks were committed to selling dollars 
in exchange for their own currencies. This commitment required them to hold dollar re-
serves. If a central bank ran out of dollar reserves, it could borrow them from the newly 
created International Monetary Fund (IMF). In addition to providing loans to central 
banks that were short of dollar reserves, the IMF would oversee the operation of the 
system and approve adjustments to the agreed-on fixed exchange rates.
Under the Bretton Woods system, a fixed exchange rate was known as a par ex-
change rate. If the par exchange rate was not the same as the exchange rate that would 
have been determined in the market, the result would be a surplus or a shortage. For ex-
ample, Figure 30A.1 shows the exchange rate between the dollar and the British pound. 
The figure is drawn from the British point of view, so we measure the exchange rate on 
the vertical axis as dollars per pound. In this case, the par exchange rate between the 
dollar and the pound is above the equilibrium exchange rate as determined by supply 
and demand.
In this example, at the par exchange rate of $4 per pound, the quantity of pounds 
demanded by people who want to buy British goods and services or who want to invest 
in British assets is smaller than the quantity of pounds supplied by people who would 
like to exchange them for dollars. As a result, the Bank of England must use dollars 
to buy the surplus of £1 million per day. Only at an exchange rate of $2.80 per pound 
would the surplus be eliminated. If the par exchange rate was below the equilibrium

exchange rate, there would be a shortage of domestic currency in the foreign exchange 
market.
A persistent shortage or surplus of a currency under the Bretton Woods system 
was seen as evidence of a fundamental disequilibrium in a country’s exchange rate. Af-
ter consulting with the IMF, countries in this position were allowed to adjust their ex-
change rates. In the early years of the Bretton Woods system, many countries found that 
their currencies were overvalued versus the dollar, meaning that their par exchange rates 
were too high. A reduction in a fixed exchange rate is a devaluation. An increase in a 
fixed exchange rate is a revaluation. In 1949, there was a devaluation of several cur-
rencies, including the British pound, reflecting the fact that those currencies had been 
 overvalued against the dollar.
The Collapse of the Bretton Woods System
By the late 1960s, the Bretton Woods system faced two severe problems. The first was 
that after 1963, the total number of dollars held by foreign central banks was larger 
than the gold reserves of the United States. In practice, most central banks—with the 
Bank of France being the main exception—rarely redeemed dollars for gold. But the 
basis of the system was a credible promise by the United States to redeem dollars for 
gold if called upon to do so. By the late 1960s, as the gap between the dollars held 
by foreign central banks and the gold reserves of the United States grew larger and 
larger, the credibility of the U.S. promise to redeem dollars for gold was called into 
question.
The second problem the Bretton Woods system faced was that some countries 
with undervalued currencies, particularly West Germany, were unwilling to revalue 
their currencies. Governments resisted revaluation because it would have increased the 
prices of their countries’ exports. Many German firms, such as Volkswagen, put pres-
sure on the government not to endanger their sales in the U.S. market by raising the 
exchange rate of the deutsche mark against the dollar. Figure 30A.2 shows the situation 
faced by the German government in 1971. The figure takes the German point of view, 
so the exchange rate is expressed in terms of dollars per deutsche mark.
Under the Bretton Woods system, the Bundesbank, the German central bank, 
was required to buy and sell deutsche marks for dollars at a rate of $0.27 per deutsche 
mark. The equilibrium that would have prevailed in the foreign exchange market if the 
Bundesbank had not intervened was about $0.35 per deutsche mark. Because the par 
exchange rate was below the equilibrium exchange rate, the quantity of deutsche marks 
demanded by people wanting to buy German goods and services or wanting to invest

Equilibrium Results in a Surplus

Under the Bretton Woods system, if the par 
exchange rate was above equilibrium, the re-
sult would be a surplus of domestic currency 
in the foreign exchange market. If the par ex-
change rate was below equilibrium, the result 
would be a shortage of domestic currency. In 
the figure, the par exchange rate between the 
pound and the dollar is $4 = ₤1, whereas 
the equilibrium exchange rate is $2.80 = ₤1. 
This gap forces the Bank of England to buy £1 
million per day in  exchange for dollars.

in German assets was greater than the quantity of deutsche marks supplied by people 
who wanted to exchange them for dollars. To maintain the exchange rate at $0.27 per 
deutsche mark, the Bundesbank had to buy dollars and sell deutsche marks. The num-
ber of deutsche marks supplied by the Bundesbank was equal to the shortage of deutsche 
marks at the par exchange rate.
By selling deutsche marks and buying dollars to defend the par exchange rate, the 
Bundesbank was increasing the West German money supply, risking an increase in 
the inflation rate. Because Germany had suffered a devastating hyperinflation during 
the 1920s, the fear of inflation was greater in Germany than in any other industrial 
country. No German government could survive politically if it allowed a significant 
increase in inflation. Knowing this fact, many investors in Germany and elsewhere 
became convinced that eventually, the German government would have to allow a re-
valuation of the mark.
During the 1960s, most European countries, including Germany, relaxed their 
 capital controls. Capital controls are limits on the flow of foreign exchange and finan-
cial investment across countries. The loosening of capital controls made it easier for 
investors to speculate on changes in exchange rates. For instance, an investor in the 
United States could sell $1 million and receive about 3.7 million deutsche marks at the 
par  exchange rate of $0.27 per deutsche mark. If the exchange rate rose to $0.35 per 
deutsche mark, the investor could then exchange deutsche marks for dollars, receiving 
$1.3  million at the new exchange rate: a return of 30 percent on an initial $1 million 
investment. The more convinced investors became that Germany would have to allow 
a revaluation, the more dollars they exchanged for deutsche marks. Figure 30A.3 shows 
the results.
The increased demand for deutsche marks by investors hoping to make a profit 
from the expected revaluation of the mark shifted the demand curve for marks to 
the right, from D1 to D2. Because of this expectation, the Bundesbank had to in-
crease the marks it supplied in exchange for dollars, raising further the risk of infla-
tion in Germany. As we saw in the chapter, because these actions by investors make 
it more difficult to maintain a fixed exchange rate, they are referred to as destabiliz-
ing speculation. By May 1971, the Bundesbank had to buy more than $250  million 
per day to support the fixed exchange rate against the dollar. Finally, on May 5, the 
West German government decided to allow the mark to float. In August, President 
 Richard Nixon decided to abandon the U.S. commitment to redeem dollars for gold. 
Attempts were made over the next two years to reach a compromise that would 
 restore a fixed exchange rate system, but by 1973, the Bretton Woods system was 
 effectively dead.

$0.27 per deutsche mark (DM). Because this 
exchange rate was lower than what the equi-
librium market exchange rate would have 
been, there was a shortage of DMs in the 
 foreign exchange market. The Bundesbank 
had to supply DMs equal to the shortage in 
exchange for dollars. The shortage in the 
 figure is equal to 1 billion DMs per day.

In 1971, the par exchange rate of $0.27 = 1 deutsche mark was below the 
equilibrium exchange rate of $0.35 = 1 deutsche mark. As investors became 
convinced that West Germany would have to revalue the deutsche mark, they 
 increased their demand for marks, shifting the demand curve from D1 to D2. The 
new equilibrium exchange rate became $0.42 = 1 deutsche mark. This increase 
in demand raised the quantity of marks the Bundesbank had to supply in ex-
change for dollars to defend the par exchange rate from 1 billion deutsche marks 
to 2 billion deutsche marks per day.

Review Questions
 30A.1 What determined the exchange rates among currencies 
under the gold standard? Why did the gold standard 
collapse?
 30A.2 Briefly describe how the Bretton Woods system operated.
 30A.3 What is the difference between a devaluation and a 
revaluation?
 30A.4 What are capital controls?
 30A.5 What role did the International Monetary Fund play in 
the Bretton Woods system?
 30A.6 What is destabilizing speculation? What role did it play in 
the collapse of the Bretton Woods system?
Problems and Applications
 30A.7 Suppose that under the gold standard, there was 1/5 
ounce of gold in a U.S. dollar and 1 ounce of gold in a 
 British pound. Demonstrate that if the exchange rate 
between the dollar and the pound was $4 = ₤1, rather 
than $5 = ₤1, you could make unlimited profits by buy-
ing gold in one country and selling it in the other. If the 
exchange rate was $6 = ₤1, how would your strategy 
change? For simplicity, assume that there was no cost to 
shipping gold from one country to the other.
 30A.8 An article in the Economist observes, “When the Depres-
sion [of the 1930s] struck, this gold standard became a 
noose around the necks of struggling economies.” In what 
sense was the gold standard a “noose around the necks of 
struggling economies” during the 1930s?
From “A Brief Post on Competitive Devaluation,” Economist, 
 October 31, 2011.
 30A.9 According to an article in the Economist, when most 
countries left the gold standard in the 1930s, in South Af-
rica “the mining industry flourished.” Briefly explain why 
the end of the gold standard might be good news for the 
owners of gold mines.
From “Johannesburg,” Economist, August 18, 2004.
 30A.10 By the mid-1960s, the price of gold on the London mar-
ket had increased to more than $35 per ounce. (Remember 
that it was not legal during these years for investors in the 
United States to own gold.) Would this have happened if 

 
Appendix The Gold Standard and the Bretton Woods System 
1041
foreign investors had believed that the U.S. commitment 
to buy and sell gold at $35 per ounce under the Bretton 
Woods system would continue indefinitely? Briefly explain.
 30A.11 An article in the New York Times states that, “On Aug. 15, 
1971, President Nixon unhitched the value of the dollar 
from the gold standard.” Is the author of this article cor-
rect that the United States abandoned the gold standard 
in 1971? What led President Nixon to take the action 
 described in the article?
From “Bretton Woods System” New York Times, October 31, 2011.
 30A.12 Barry Eichengreen, an economist at the University of Cal-
ifornia, Berkeley, describes actions taken by the Federal 
Reserve in 1931 to try to keep the United States on the 
gold standard: “[T]he New York Fed raised its discount 
rate by a full percentage point to defend the dollar. A week 
later it raised the discount rate a second time, again by a 
full percentage point.” Why would an increase in interest 
rates help the United States stay on the gold standard?
From Barry Eichengreen, Exorbitant Privlege, (Oxford: Oxford 
 University Press, 2011), p. 36.
 30A.13 One economist has argued that the East Asian exchange 
rate crisis of the late 1990s was due to “the simple failure 
of governments to remember the lessons from the break-
down of the Bretton Woods System.” What are these les-
sons? In what sense did the East Asian governments fail 
to learn these lessons?
From Thomas D. Willett, “Crying for Argentina,” Milken Institute 
Review, Second Quarter 2002.
 30A.14 An article in the Wall Street Journal argues that, “The 
Bretton Woods system ran into trouble in the 1960s, in 
part because U.S. trade deficits mounted.” Why would 
increases in the U.S. trade deficit cause problems for the 
Bretton Woods system?
From Jon E. Hilsenrath and Mary Kissel, “Currency Decision Marks 
Small Shift toward Flexibility,” Wall Street Journal, July 22, 2005.
 30A.15 An article in the Economist notes that after the end of 
the Bretton Woods system, “The Europeans did not like 
leaving their currencies to the whims of the markets. . . 
.” What does it mean for a country to leave its currency 
to the “whims of the markets”? What problems might a 
country experience as a result? What exchange rate sys-
tem did most European countries ultimately adopt?

Auto-generated Test and 
Assignments. MyEconLab comes 
with preloaded assignments, all of 
which are automatically graded 
and include select end-of-chapter 
questions and problems from the 
textbook.

from each student’s results on quizzes  
and tests. Students can clearly see 
which topics they have mastered and, 
more importantly, which they need to 
work on.

Learning Resources. To further reinforce understanding, Study Plan and 
Homework problems link to additional learning resources:
■ A step-by-step Guided Solution helps students break down a problem 
much the same way as an instructor would do during office hours.
■ The eText page on which the topic of the exercise is explained 
promotes reading the text when further explanation is needed.
■ A graphing tool encourages students to draw and manipulate graphs 
and deepen their understanding by illustrating economic relationships 
and ideas.
Unlimited Practice. Many Study 
Plan and Instructor-assigned exer-
cises contain algorithms to ensure 
students get as much practice as 
they need. 
    As students work through  
Study Plan or Homework exer-
cises, instant feedback and tuto-
rial resources guide them towards 
understanding.
