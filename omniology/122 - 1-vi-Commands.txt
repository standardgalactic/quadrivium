     :1,10s/old/new - substitute new for first occurrence 
                      of old in lines 1 - 10 
     :.,$s/old/new  - substitute new for first occurrence

     :%s/old/new/g  - substitute new for all occurrences 
                      of old in the entire file 

     :%s/old/new/gc - interactively substitute new for all  
                      occurrences of old - will prompt for  
                      y/n response for each substitution.

vi Options  
 
You can change the way vi operates by changing the value of certain options which control 
specific parts of the vi environment.  
 
To set an option during a vi session, use one of the commands below as required by the option:  
 
     :set option_name 
     :set option_name=value 
      
Some examples of the more common options are described below.  
 
     :set all       - shows all vi options in effect  
 
     :set ai        - set autoindent - automatically indents 
                      each line of text  
 
     :set noai      - turn autoindent off   
 
     :set nu        - set line numbering on  

 
     :set nonu      - turn line numbering off  
 
     :set scroll=n  - sets number of lines to be scrolled  
                      to n.  Used by screen scroll commands.  
 
     :set sw=n      - set shiftwidth to n. Used by autoindent  
                      option. 
 
     :set wm=n      - set wrapmargin to n. Specifies number  
                      of spaces to leave on right edge of the  
                      screen before wrapping words to next  
                      line.  
 
     :set showmode  - reminds you when you are inserting  
                      text.  
 
     :set ic        - ignore case of characters when  
                      performing a search.  
 
      
Options can be set permanently by putting them in a file called .exrc in your home directory. A 
sample .exrc file appears below. Note that you do not need the colon (:) as part of the option 
specification when you put the commands in a .exrc file. Also note that you can put them all on 
one line.  
 
     set nu ai wm=5 showmode ic
