How Does Electricity Work?

To understand electronics, we first need to understand electricity. Electricity is the flow of electrons, negatively 
charged particles, through a conductor, such as a copper wire. Imagine electrons as little balls that move along a path, 
creating an electric current. This electrical current is what powers all of our electronic devices.

CHAPTER 2: BASIC ELECTRICITY
In this chapter, we will explore the fundamentals of electricity, one of the essential building blocks of electronics. Let's 
unveil the basic concepts of electric current, voltage and resistance in a simple and accessible way.
Electric current
Electric current is the flow of electrons through a conductor, such as a metal wire. Think of it as a river of electrons 
flowing from one point to another. The unit of measurement for electrical current is the ampere, abbreviated as "A". It 
is important to understand that current flows from the positive pole to the negative pole, although the electrons, which 
are negative, move in the opposite direction.
Electrical Voltage (Voltage)
Electrical voltage, also called voltage, is the force that pushes electrons through a circuit. It is measured in volts (V). 
Analogously, you can think of tension as the pressure of water in a hose. The higher the voltage, the more force the 
electrons have to move.
Electrical Resistance

Electrical resistance is the measure of the opposition that a material offers to the flow of electrical current. It is 
represented by the letter "R" and measured in ohms (Q). Materials like copper have low resistance while materials like 
glass have high resistance. Resistance is fundamental to controlling the flow of current in a circuit.
Ohm's Law
Ohm's Law is an important relationship in electricity that describes how voltage, current, and resistance are related. It 
is expressed by the formula V = I * R, where "V" is the voltage in volts, "I" is the current in amps and "R" is the resistance 
in ohms. This law allows you to calculate any of these quantities if you know the other two.
Simple Circuits
Electrical circuits can be very simple, like a light bulb connected to a battery, or complex, like a computer. Learning to 
build and understand simple circuits is the first step to mastering electronics. We will see more about circuits in the 
following chapters.
Conclusion
In this chapter, you have gained a fundamental understanding of electricity, current, voltage, and resistance. These 
concepts are the basis for exploring electronics in more depth. As we continue our journey, you will be more prepared 
to deal with the electronic components and circuits you will encounter in future chapters. Electricity is the language of 
electronics, and now you have begun to decipher its first words.

CHAPTER 3: ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS
In this chapter, we will explore the fundamental electronic components that form the basis of any electronic circuit. 
Let’s get to know resistors, capacitors and inductors, understanding how they work and where they are used.
Resistors
Resistors are passive components that have the function of limiting the flow of electrical current in a circuit. They are 
usually made of metal or carbon wire. The main characteristic of a resistor is its electrical resistance, measured in ohms 
(Q). Resistors are used to control current in a circuit, divide voltage, and perform other important functions.
Capacitors
Capacitors are components that temporarily store electrical charge. They consist of two conductive plates separated by 
an insulating material, called a dielectric. The unit of measurement for capacitance is the farad (F). Capacitors are used 
in circuits to store energy and to filter electrical signals.
Inductors
Inductors are components that store energy in the form of a magnetic field when an electric current passes through 
them. They are made up of a wire wound in a spiral. The unit of measurement for inductance is the henry (H). 
Inductors are used to store energy in alternating current (AC) circuits and also to filter signals.

Diodes
Diodes are semiconductor devices that allow electrical current to pass in only one direction. They have one polarity, 
with an anode (positive) terminal and a cathode (negative) terminal. Diodes are used to rectify alternating current into 
direct current and protect reverse polarity circuits.
Transistors
Transistors are semiconductor components that can amplify or control the flow of current in a circuit. They are widely 
used in electronics for signal amplification and switching. There are different types of transistors, such as bipolar 
transistors (NPN and PNP) and field effect transistors (FET).
Integrated Circuits (ICs)
Integrated circuits are components that incorporate multiple electronic devices on a single chip. They are the backbone 
of modern electronics and can include complex functions such as microprocessors and memory. ICs are used in 
virtually all electronic devices.
Conclusion
In this chapter, you learned about the main electronic components: resistors, capacitors, inductors, diodes, transistors, 
and integrated circuits. These components play essential roles in building electronic circuits. As we progress through 
this book, you will gain a deeper understanding of how these components interact and how to use them to create 
functional circuits. This is an important step towards your mastery of electronics.

CHAPTER 4: OHM'S LAWS
In this chapter, we will deepen our knowledge of Ohm’s laws, which are fundamental to understanding how electric 
current, voltage and resistance are related in an electrical circuit.
Ohm's Laws
Georg Simon Ohm, a German physicist, formulated the laws that bear his name in the early 19th century. These laws 
are essential to understanding the behavior of electrical components in a circuit. There are three Ohm's laws:
1. Ohm's First Law (Voltage Law)
- Ohm's first law establishes that the voltage (V) in a circuit is directly proportional to the current (I) that flows through 
it, keeping the resistance (R) constant. In mathematical terms, this is expressed as V = I * R.
2. Ohm's Second Law (Current Law)
- Ohm's second law establishes that the current (I) in a circuit is directly proportional to the applied voltage (V) and 
inversely proportional to the resistance (R) of the circuit. The corresponding formula is I = V / R.
3. Ohm's Third Law (Law of Resistance)

- Ohm's third law states that the resistance (R) of a component is directly proportional to the voltage (V) applied and 
inversely proportional to the current (I) that flows through it. It is expressed as R = V / I.
Interpretation of Ohm's Laws
Let's understand these laws with a simple example. Imagine a 100 ohm (&) resistor and we apply a voltage of 10 volts 
(V) to it. Using Ohm's Law, we can calculate the current passing through the resistor:
- 1 = V/R
- i = iov/ ioo n
- 1 = 0.1 A (or 100 mA)
This means that a current of 0.1 amps (A) will flow through the resistor when a voltage of 10 volts is applied. Ohm's 
laws allow us to predict how voltage, current, and resistance in a circuit interact and how adjusting one of these 
parameters will affect the others.
Applications of Ohm's Laws
Ohm's laws are widely used in electronics to calculate and design circuits. They are essential for sizing resistors, 
understanding how circuits work and solving electrical problems.
Conclusion

Ohm's laws are the basis of electrical theory and play a crucial role in electronics. Understanding how voltage, current 
and resistance relate is fundamental to designing and troubleshooting electronic circuits. As we progress through this 
book, you will apply these laws in various contexts and gain confidence in dealing with electrical circuits.

CHAPTER 5: SERIES AND PARALLEL CIRCUITS
In this chapter, we will explore two fundamental types of component arrangements in a circuit: series circuits and 
parallel circuits. Understanding these configurations is crucial for building and analyzing electronic circuits.
Series Circuits
In a series circuit, components are connected in a single line or path, like beads on a necklace. This means that electrical 
current passes through each component in sequence. Characteristics of series circuits include:
- The same current flows through all components.
- The total voltage of the circuit is the sum of the voltages in each component.
- The total resistance of the circuit is the sum of the individual resistances of the components.
Imagine a series of Christmas lights connected in series. If one bulb burns out, all lights in the series will go out as 
current cannot flow.
Parallel Circuits

In a parallel circuit, components are connected so that the current splits into separate paths, like the branches of a tree. 
Characteristics of parallel circuits include:
- The voltage is the same on all components.
- The current splits between the branches, but rejoins at the exit.
- The total resistance is less than the resistance of the component with the lowest resistance.
A common example of a parallel circuit is an electrical outlet in your home. All devices connected to it operate with the 
same voltage as the socket, but the current is divided to power each device separately.
Series Circuits vs. Parallel
The choice between series and parallel circuits depends on the purpose of the circuit. Series circuits are useful when 
you want the same current to pass through all components, such as in strings of lights. Parallel circuits are used when 
you want to power multiple devices with the same voltage but separate currents.
Circuit Combinations
In more complex electronic projects, you will often find combinations of series and parallel circuits. These 
arrangements can be challenging, but Ohm's laws and circuit analysis rules help solve these problems.
Conclusion

Understanding series and parallel circuits is fundamental to electronics. You will learn to analyze and design circuits 
based on these concepts as we go along. With this foundation, you can create more complex circuits and solve electrical 
problems with confidence.

CHAPTER 6: DIRECT CURRENT AND
ALTERNATING CURRENT CIRCUITS
In this chapter, we'll explore the differences between direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC) - two common 
types of electricity that power our electronic devices.
Direct Current (DC)
Direct current is a type of electricity in which the current flows in a single, constant direction. It is characterized by:
- Constant tension over time.
- Used in batteries and power supplies for electronic devices.
- Represented by a straight line on a current versus time graph.
Alternating Current (AC)
Alternating current is a type of electricity in which the direction of the current regularly reverses, going back and forth 
at a specific rate, usually 60 times per second (60 Hz) in many places. It is characterized by:
- Voltage that varies cyclically.

- Used in most domestic electrical networks.
- Represented by a sine waveform on a current versus time graph.
Differences between DC and AC
The main difference between DC and AC is the direction of flow of electrical current and the voltage waveform. 
However, these differences have significant implications:
- Use of DC: Direct current is widely used in electronic devices such as laptops and cell phones, as well as in battery- 
powered vehicles. It is ideal for electronics that require constant, direct voltage.
- Use of AC: Alternating current is used in domestic and industrial electrical networks as it is effective in transmitting 
energy over long distances. The ability to transform the voltage into different voltage levels is another advantage.
- Voltage Transformation: Transformers work only with alternating current, allowing the voltage to be increased or 
reduced as necessary.
Conversion between DC and AC
Devices called inverters are used to convert DC to AC and vice versa. This is useful in solar power systems, for example, 
where power is generated in DC and needs to be converted to AC for domestic use.
Conclusion

Understanding the differences between direct current and alternating current is crucial for working with electricity 
and electronics. These two types of electricity play distinct roles in our everyday lives, and the choice between them 
depends on the specific application. As we continue to explore electronics, you will see how these types of current are

electron vacancies called "holes" and free electrons that can move around the structure.
Diodes
A diode is a semiconductor device that allows current to flow in a single direction and prevents flow in the opposite 
direction. It has two terminals, the anode (positive) and the cathode (negative). When a positive voltage is applied to the 
anode relative to the cathode, the diode becomes conductive, allowing current to flow.

Characteristics of Diodes
