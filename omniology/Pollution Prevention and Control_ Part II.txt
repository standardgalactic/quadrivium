Preface
Preface
Engineering design is about the creation of artificial things that have desired properties by combining 
elements into a coherent whole. These ‘things’ must be analyzed to make the elements correctly fit 
together so the desired result is accomplished. 
There is little hope of an effective solution until the designer knows the amounts of material and energy 
moving through the system. Many of the systems we analyze exist only as alternatives in our mind, or on 
paper. We cannot measure that which does not yet exist and, still, we must have accurate estimates of the flow 
rates and compositions in order to assess and weigh the proposals that stand a chance of implementation. 
Skill in deducing the changes enables the necessary flow and composition data to be inferred. 
The two fundamental tools for making the process analysis are the material balance and the energy 
balance. A material balance will be needed for virtually every pollution prevention and control problem. 
The material balance and the energy balance are needed when accounting for the use and flow of energy. 
All mass and energy entering the system must be accounted for. The inputs, of both mass and energy, 
must equal the outputs plus any accumulation within the system
This book explains how to calculate the material balance and the energy balance. Twenty five case studies 
and 85 examples explain how these tools are used. The examples include a variety of air, wastewater, and 
solid waste management problems and the student will learn a good deal about these areas of engineering 
while mastering the design tools. They will also be introduced to some fundamental concepts for chemical 
and biological reactions, material separations, and economic evaluations. Instructors can expand the 
learning experience by taking a minute or two to explain the context of the problem. 
Pollution control engineers bring logic and order and solid quantitative information to the discussion 
about how public and private funds will be used to solve problems so better decisions will be made. 
Implementing the proposed solution goes beyond engineering design into public policy and business 
management so the overall result will be better if the people in these related areas understand some 
basic tools of the engineer. 
The concepts and calculations in this book are accessible to students in non-engineering disciplines. 
Chapters 1–4, 6, 9 and 10 will make a useful short course for non-engineers, and also a strong introductory 
course or a supplement to conventional introductory courses in environmental engineering. 
This is the second of five books on Pollution Prevention and Control. The first, Pollution Prevention and 
Control: Human Health and Environmental Quality, was about the general strategy of design, natural 
environmental cycles, toxicity and risk assessment for the protection of human and environmental health, 
the fate of pollutants in the environment, and a review of U.S. and international laws and regulations.

Preface
The books to follow will deal with:
•	 Using chemical and biological reactions to destroy and transform pollutants to facilitate the 
separation of different materials, or to make substances safe for discharge to water, air or soil.
•	 Systems to separate solids from liquids, solids from gases, solids from solids, and so on in all 
combination. The solution of a problem is never stymied by lack of separation technology, 
but it may be weakened by failure to organize them into efficient processing systems, or to 
overlook an innovative combination of transformation and separation.
•	 Minimizing costs and comparing alternate designs. Engineering projects almost always have 
more than one feasible solution, and often there are several that are attractive. The options 
must be measured and compared by using objective criteria like construction cost, lifetime 
cost, or mass of pollutant discharged. Also discussed are methods for evaluating non-
monetary aspects of projects.
The goal of the series is to build problem-solving strategies and skills that are widely useful in water 
pollution control, air pollution control, and solid waste control. We want to stimulate innovation in 
pollution control systems design and pollution prevention.
The ultimate goal of environmental engineering, and the part of it that we call pollution control 
engineering, is to increase the level of health and happiness in the world. We hope this series of books 
will help to do that.
Shyi Tien Chen, National Kaohsiung First University of Science and Technology, Taiwan, and Mark Milke, 
University of Canterbury, New Zealand, reviewed a very early version and helped keep the project alive. 
Special thanks go to Dale Rudd (UW-Madison, Department of Chemical Engineering) for his support 
and ideas over many years. Also to our colleagues, Emeritus Professors William C. Boyle and Erhard 
Joeres, of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering) for 
reviewing and improving the book.

The Fundamentals of Design
1	 The Fundamentals of Design
1.1	
The Design Problem
Science teaches about natural things and how they work. Engineering is about how artificial things are 
designed and constructed to serve some useful purpose.
Engineering design is a blend of synthesis and analysis. “Synthesis deals with the creation of artificial 
things that have desired properties by combining often diverse elements into a coherent whole. Analysis 
examines the elements and their relations. Each synthesis creates an analysis problem, the solution of 
which often provides insights that create a new synthesis (Rudd et al 1973).”
The basic elements that are organized into pollution prevention and control systems are 
•	 Reactors in which chemical and biochemical reactions are promoted and controlled so 
that toxic, offensive, unstable, or low value materials can be transformed into non-toxic, 
inoffensive, stable, and useful materials.
•	 Separation processes that will concentrate or upgrade a material by selectively removing one 
species of material from another (solids from a liquid, for example).
Process synthesis cannot be studied without learning about transformations and separations, which 
are the subjects of other books. Analysis can be understood and practiced without knowing about the 
machinery that is used to accomplish the transformations and separations. We only need to know what 
change is accomplished or required.
1.2	
The Fundamental Concepts
There is little hope of an effective solution until the designer knows the amounts of material and energy 
that will be managed. In an existing system one might install meters, gauges, and instruments to measure 
flow rates and chemical composition. Information can be tallied from production records, waste shipping 
manifests, and product specifications.
But this will not provide all the needed information for two reasons, one technical and one philosophical.
The technical reason is that some quantities are not immediately available and can be obtained only 
by deductive reasoning from fragmentary available data. Certain kinds of effluents cannot be detected 
without extreme expenditures of time and money, if at all. Sometimes we cannot afford the luxury of 
making measurements, especially if the same information can be generated by scientific inference.

The Fundamentals of Design
The philosophical reason is that we are concerned not only with the way things are but with the way 
things ought to be. Many of the systems we analyze exist only as alternatives in our mind, or on paper. 
We cannot measure that which does not yet exist but, we must have accurate estimates of the flow 
rates and compositions in order to assess alternate designs. This is done by using the two fundamental 
concepts shown in Figure 1.1.
Figure 1.1 The fundamental principles: Conservation of Mass and Conservation of Energy
Conservation of Mass – Mass is neither created nor destroyed. All material flowing into and out of a 
system must be accounted for.
Conservation of Energy – Energy is neither created nor destroyed. All energy flowing into and out of a 
system must be accounted for.
The two most important design tools – the material balance and the energy balance – derive from 
these principles.
Large chunks of material and molecules can be changed within the system. Water becomes steam, steam 
becomes water, fuel becomes gas, particles dissolve, solutes precipitate, gases are absorbed by or stripped 
from liquids, and so on. Molecules are decomposed and the atoms are rearranged to make molecules 
of new materials. Whatever happens within the system, the mass that enters either leaves or is stored 
within the system.
The same is true for energy. Energy can be dissipated from a useful form into waste heat by friction or 
heat loss from steam pipes. Heat energy can become mechanical energy as when steam is used to drive 
a generator shaft. Mechanical energy can become kinetic energy as when a pump imparts motion to a 
fluid. After nature has done all the manipulations the total amount of energy must be the same. Some 
careful analysis may be needed to account for everything, but the Second Law of Thermodynamics says 
that the account must balance.
The concepts are easy to understand and the calculations are readily learned. In practice the more 
difficult work is estimating or collecting the necessary information about the flow and composition of 
the input and output streams.

The Material Balance and the Energy Balance
A material balance will be needed for virtually every pollution prevention and control problem. The 
material balance and the energy balance are needed when accounting for the use and flow of energy.
The material balance is used to answer such questions as:
•	 How will the amount of chemical sludge change if different chemicals are used to remove 
turbidity from river water?
•	 How much disinfectant per month must be purchased in order to achieve a specified 
disinfectant concentration in drinking water?
•	 How should the biological solids in a wastewater treatment plant be managed to yield a high 
quality effluent? 
•	 How much useful (combustible) biogas will be produced in a landfill?
•	 How much sewage sludge must be blended with the solid refuse of a city to produce 
useful compost? 
•	 How much sulfur dioxide will be emitted in the stack gas of a power plant per ton of 
coal burned? 
•	 How much wastewater and sludge will be created by using lime slurry to scrub sulfur 
dioxide from stack gas? 
•	 How much water is needed to rinse and clean parts in metal plating? 
•	 Will waste chloride discharged from a proposed industry exceed what is tolerable in a river? 
The energy balance is used to answer such questions as:
•	 How much heat energy can be obtained from biogas that is extracted from a landfill?
•	 How much heat energy can be recovered from the hot exhaust of a gas engine?
•	 Does a sludge digester produce enough biogas to heat the sludge that enters the digester?
•	 How much steam and cooling water can be saved by increasing the efficiency of a heat 
exchanger network?
•	 How much air must be supplied to an incinerator for efficient combustion of a waste gas?
•	 How much power is needed to supply air for activated sludge treatment of wastewater?
A variety of 85 example problems and 25 case studies will analyze problems such as these.

Block Diagrams
A variety of drawings are used from conception to final design of a project. To begin, when the process 
is mostly still in our imagination, block diagrams are used to show the process components and the flow 
of material and/or energy between them.

The Fundamentals of Design
There are four basic process components: mixers, splitters, reactors, and separators. The reactors that 
transform materials are almost always integrated with processes that do separations. Mixers and splitters 
facilitate the process integration.
Figure 1.2 shows the inputs and outputs of the basic components for a simple process for removing lead 
from wastewater by adding lime to form a precipitate that is removed by filtration. 
Figure 1.3 shows the components organized as a block diagram. A process block diagram provides no 
detail about the internal workings of the processes, but it does organize the information needed to do 
the material balance.

Figure 1.3 Process block diagram or flow sheet for a hypothetical lead removal process.
How is the block diagram constructed? The lead in the influent wastewater is soluble and the treatment 
concept is to convert dissolved lead into particles that can be removed by some kind of physical separation 
process, such as settling or filtration. The block diagram does not show the ultimate disposition of the 
particles that are removed as sludge. The effluent from the separator is safe for disposal to the environment 
and it is of sufficiently good quality to be reused in the manufacturing process.
1.5	
Block Diagrams and the Material Balance
Figure 1.4 shows how the block diagram is used to organize the material balance. The block diagram 
shows a three-stage solid-liquid separation sequence and the mass of water and solids entering and 
leaving each stage. At each stage, the mass of water in equals the mass of water out. The same is 
true for the solids and for the total mass (water + solids). The influent solids concentration is 2%  
(2 T/100 T) and the solids leave the centrifuge at a 25% concentration (2 T/8 T). Three stages are used 
because each separation process is restricted on the solids concentration it can accept as feed and how 
much thickening it can do.
Figure 1.4 Block diagram for a 3-stage solid-liquid separation process to remove and concentrate solids.  
The mass of water that enters each stage equals the amount of water that leaves.  
The same is true for the solids and for the total mass (water + solids).
1.6	
Inventing the Block Diagram
If the influent contains a mixture of materials that must be removed, the number of processing options 
increases and several alternatives may be evaluated to find the most cost effective.

The Fundamentals of Design
Materials can be separated if they differ in some way and we can devise machinery to exploit that 
difference. Here is a simple example for separating a mixture of four dry materials that differ in size and 
solubility in water, as shown in the ordered property lists in Figure 1.5(a). One separation process will 
split one of the property lists into two parts. 
Making the first separation using solubility will yield a solution that contains A and D, and another 
solution that contains B and C and the further separations will be difficult. Clearly the first separation 
must exploit the difference in size. Figure 1.5(b) and (c) shows two feasible processing schemes based on 
splitting the raw material according to size. (The inventive student will find one more feasible method of 
separating the four materials.) The processing shown in Figure 1.5(b) is easier because the size difference 
is larger than the 0.5 cm difference between D and the other solids.
Additional processing may be desirable. For example, the moisture may need to be removed from material 
A. Or, material C, which was dissolved to remove it from A, may need to be recovered as a solid which 
might lead to some kind of precipitation or drying process. 
Another possibility is to look for a third property that will differentiate A and C, such as magnetic 
attraction or color difference. 
Inventing block diagrams for processes is an inventor’s playground.

Process Flow Diagrams
As details emerge the block diagram becomes a process flow diagram, or process flow sheet. Figure 1.6 
is a flow diagram of the sort that is useful in brochures for visitors to a facility. It shows all process 
equipment connected into a complete system. Equipment used to move the material (pumps, etc.) and 
to heat and cool materials are shown. The convention is that material enters on the left and leaves on 
the right and, generally, gas streams are at the top, liquid streams are in the middle, and solid streams

Design Drawings and Specifications
Figure 1.7 represents the large collection of detailed drawings needed for construction. These are scale 
drawings that give all dimensions, elevations, and a multitude of other details. Preparing these detailed 
drawings is time consuming and costly. The designer always estimates the number of pages of drawings 
that will be needed and this estimate is a keystone in setting the design fee.

A book of technical specifications for material type and quality and the performance of mechanicals is 
provided with the drawings.
Figure 1.8 is a historical design drawing from a Boston sewer project that was built in the 1870s and 
1880s. Sewage flowed by gravity to the Calf Pasture Pumping Station from where it was pumped away 
from the original harbor outfalls to Moon Island in Boston Harbor. Six tons of coal per day was burned to 
provide steam to drive the two Leavitt pumps that could each produce a 35-foot (11 m) lift for 25 million 
gallons (95,000 m3/d) of sewage per day. Coal was delivered by ship.

The process flow diagram shows less information than a piping and instrumentation diagram (P&ID). 
Figure 1.9 is a simple P&ID. There are two control loops. Loop 100 is for metering soda ash and loop 
101 is for pH control by the addition of phosphoric acid. There is a standard system for lines, icons 
for valves and other elements, and nomenclature for tag names. All tag names in a loop have the same 
number. Tag names usually have two or more letters. The first letter indicates what is being measured, 
transmitted or controlled. The second letter indicates the function of the mechanical or electrical device.

Structure of this Book
The book has fourteen chapters. Chapter 2 is about pollutants and the units used to quantify concentrations 
and masses. Chapter 3 is a collection of case studies that illustrate what is meant by pollution prevention 
and what can be accomplished once the flow of materials through a system is known. 
Chapters 4 and 5 explain how material balance problems are formulated and solved. There are examples 
from all areas of pollution prevention and control. Chapter 6 teaches how to make the material balance 
when there are chemical reactions. Chapter 7 deals with unsteady-state material balances for processes 
in which volumetric and mass flow rates vary over time. Chapter 8 is about using the material balance 
for water conservation and reuse.
Chapters 9 to 10 are about energy balance problems, starting with the units that are used to quantify 
energy flow and how the energy balance is made using a property known as enthalpy, which is analogous 
to mass in the material balance. Chapters 11, 12 and 13 deal with the efficient use of energy and with 
the use of waste materials, including biogas, as fuels. Chapter 14 is about the design of pumping and air 
blower systems, which account for nearly all the energy use in a wastewater treatment plant.

Conclusion
This has been an overview of the design process, from the initial concepts that are sketched out in block 
diagrams (some designers call these cartoons) through to the detailed final design. 
The analysis of material and energy flow in this book will be done with block diagrams and simplified 
process flow diagrams. 
Cost estimates are needed in preliminary design to assess financial feasibility and to compare different 
ideas. More detailed designs with more accurate cost estimates are needed later for client consultations. 
Finally, detailed designs and cost estimates are needed to arrange budgets and financing. The accuracy 
of these estimates may be ±25% at the preliminary stage and ±5% for the detailed design. 
Our interest lies in the early stages of design. These are the most creative and they offer the best possibilities 
to be innovative with pollution prevention and pollution control. The information that is available for 
making preliminary cost estimates comes entirely from process flow diagrams and material and energy 
balances. These are the fundamental tools and the focus of the next few chapters.

Measures of Pollution
2	 Measures of Pollution
2.1	
The Problem
Pollutants come in many physical and chemical forms, and almost always as a mixture. There will be 
dissolved chemicals in water, particles in liquids and gases, solids mixed with other solids, and gases 
mixed with air. The pollutants need to be identified and quantified as the first step in defining the 
problem. Then concentrations, volume flow rates, and mass flow rates are needed to solve the problem.
This chapter reviews common units that are used to measure concentration, volume, mass, and flow 
rate. It will also define some measures of pollution.
2.2	
Pollutants
2.2.1	
Classes of Pollutants
Toxic and hazardous chemicals, such as benzene, copper and other heavy metals, pesticides, and other 
organic chemicals, are specifically identified and given limits in the regulations. These must be measured 
individually as specific chemicals.
 ‘Lumped’ characteristics are commonly used for solids and organics in wastewater, including particulate 
matter (PM), suspended solids (SS), total dissolved solids (TDS), and chemical oxygen demand (COD). 
In water the particles may be organic or inorganic, biological (bacteria and algae), or chemical. 
Particulate matter (PM) in air measures the total concentration or total mass and does not differentiate 
the kinds of solids, such as metal fumes, fly ash, dust or pollen in air. 
2.2.2	
Solids in Water and Wastewater
Solids in water and wastewater are measured as mass per volume, usually mg/L. In many applications 
it is sufficient to use ‘lumped’ or aggregate measures, such as total solids, total volatile solids (organic 
solids), and total fixed solids (inert solids). These measures give no information about composition of 
the individual solid particles. Specific dissolved ions and dissolved organic compounds are unknown. 
Total solids is the residue left in a vessel after the sample has been dried to a constant weight at 103-
105°C. Total solids includes particles and dissolved materials. Volatile solids is measured as the mass of 
material that will burn off at 550°C. Fixed solids are whatever will not burn at a temperature of 550°C; 
fixed solids are the ash (APHA 1992).

Measures of Pollution
Volatile solids is an aggregate measure of all the organic matter in a sample. All carbohydrates, fats, 
proteins, and synthetic chemicals will be measured as volatile solids. When a biological treatment process 
reduces the mass of total solids, the lost mass is volatile solids that have been converted to gas (usually 
methane or carbon dioxide). If the volatile solids decrease and fixed solids increase it is because organic 
compounds have been mineralized. 
Suspended solids are particles that can be captured on a filter of 2.0 µm (or smaller) pore size. ‘Dissolved 
solids’ pass through the filter. More correctly these are called filterable solids because this fraction 
includes very small particles (colloids) as well as truly dissolved chemicals. Dissolved solids could be 
measured by using filters with a finer pore size, or by using an ultra-centrifuge to remove the particles. 
The distinction between filterable solids and dissolved solids is unimportant in most applications and 
we will use dissolved solids.
The relations are
Total solids (TS) = Volatile solids (VS) + Fixed solids (FS)
Total solids (TS) = Total suspended solids (TSS) + Total dissolved solids (TDS)
Total suspended solids (TSS) = Volatile suspended solids (VSS) + Fixed suspended solids (FSS)
Total dissolved solids (TDS) = Volatile dissolved solids (VDS) + Fixed dissolved solids (FDS)
Example 2.1 RELATIONS OF SOLIDS IN WATER AND WASTEWATER
Figure 2.1 shows a possible distribution of solids in wastewater, but not necessarily a typical distribution. The objective 
is to define the classes of solids that are commonly measured to characterize wastewater.
TDS = VDS + FDS = 300 mg/L + 700 mg/L = 1,000 mg/L
TSS = VSS + FSS = 100 mg/L + 100 mg/L = 200 mg/L
FS = FDS + FSS = 700 mg/L + 100 mg/L = 800 mg/L
VS = VDS + VSS = 300 mg/L + 100 mg/L = 400 mg/L
TS = VS + FS = 400 mg/L + 800 mg/L = 1,200 mg/L

Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)
There are no specific limits for carbohydrates, fats and proteins, or for the individual kinds of carbohydrates 
(glucose, starch, etc.) or for proteins and their amino acid building blocks (glycine, tryptophan, etc.). 
There are regulations for aggregates of these kinds of organic chemicals. What they have in common is 
that they can be decomposed and metabolized by bacteria and other microbes. Almost all wastewater 
treatment plants include processes to accomplish this biodegradation under controlled conditions. 
Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) is a measure of the oxygen consuming activity of aerobic (i.e, 
oxygen consuming) microorganisms. Oxygen consumption is proportional to the amount biodegradable 
organic compounds that are metabolized by the organisms as they consume the oxygen. 
Every wastewater treatment plant has an effluent limit for BOD, which may range from 5 mg/L to 30 
mg/L (in the U.S.).  Whatever portion of influent BOD that is not eliminated in the treatment process 
can be exerted in a lake or stream, thus reducing the dissolved oxygen that is needed for a healthy 
aquatic population.

Measures of Pollution
The 5-day BOD test is a bioassay that is done in sealed bottles (BOD bottles) that contain diluted 
wastewater. The dilution water-wastewater mixture is aerated to give an initial dissolved oxygen (DO) 
concentration close to 9 mg/L. (The saturation concentration of oxygen in clean water is 9.18 mg/L at 
20°C). The samples are incubated at a standard temperature of 20°C for 5 days to measure the 5-day 
BOD, or BOD5. The dissolved oxygen concentration is measured after 5 days of incubation at a standard 
temperature of 20°C. 
The DO depletion (∆DObottle) from the initial to the final concentration is proportional to the amount of 
biodegradable organic matter in the sample. The BOD of the bottle contents is
BODbottle = ∆DObottle = [initial DO] – [final DO]
The final DO must be 2 mg/L or greater for the measurement to be valid. The DO depletion in the bottle 
must be less than 6-7 mg/L. This requirement is the reason for incubating a diluted mixture. 
The dilution factor (DF) is the ratio of the BOD bottle volume to the volume of wastewater in the bottle. 
DF = (Vbottle)/(Vsample). DF = 30 means a 10 mL wastewater volume in a 300 mL bottle; DF = 300/10.  
DF = 2 means that the incubated mixture is 50% effluent and 50% dilution water: DF = 300/150.
The BOD of the undiluted wastewater is 
The effluent from a well-operated modern activated sludge process will be less than 10 mg/L BOD5. A 
dilution factor of 2 should be suitable. A BOD5 concentration of 200 mg/L to 300 mg/L is typical for 
municipal wastewater. A dilution factor (DF) of 25–50 is needed so the mixture has BODbottle ≤ 6–7 mg/L.
A longer incubation time of 20 to 30 days is used to measure the ultimate BOD. The ultimate BOD is 
proportional to the quantity of biodegradable organic compounds that were present at the start of the 
incubation period. The 5-day BOD is approximately two-thirds of the ultimate BOD for municipal 
wastewater.
The BOD test is problematic in many ways, aside from taking 5-days to get a result. One problem, 
because it is a bioassay, is toxicity, especially with some industrial wastewaters. COD can be used as a 
surrogate for biodegradable organics in wastewater even though it will measure some compounds that 
are not biodegradable.

Four 300 mL BOD bottles (see Figure 2.2) are used to measure the 5-day BOD of a municipal wastewater. The test 
conditions are given in Table 2.1. Three of the four dilutions (bottles) give valid test results. These are averaged to estimate 
the 5-day BOD of 297 mg/L, which is rounded to 300 mg/L.

2.2.4	
Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)
Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) is another “lumped” or aggregate measure of organics. BOD measures 
oxidation by bacteria under aerobic conditions. This is the mechanism that robs streams of oxygen 
when they are polluted with organic wastes. BOD is what we want to know. The COD is an estimate of 
the ultimate BOD. COD is always larger than the ultimate BOD, which is always larger than the BOD5.
The COD test measures all organic compounds that can be oxidized to carbon dioxide with a strong 
chemical oxidizing agent (dichromate) under acidic conditions. This includes all carbohydrates, fats and 
proteins and most synthetic organic compounds. It can be measured on the whole wastewater or on the 
‘soluble’ (filterable) fraction of a wastewater.
The COD test has two advantages. It can be completed in a few hours, compared to 5 days for the BOD5 
test. It can be measured on wastewaters that are toxic to the bacteria on which the BOD test depends. 
This makes it useful for certain kinds of industrial wastewaters.

Example 2.3 MEASURES OF BIODEGRADABLE ORGANICS IN WASTEWATER
The influent to a biological wastewater treatment process (e.g. an activated sludge process) contains 250 mg/L ultimate 
BOD and 300 mg/L COD (total oxidizable organics). The treatment removes 245 mg/L ultimate BOD so the effluent 
contains 5 mg/L ultimate BOD. The treatment will also remove 245 mg/L COD (the same compounds that make up 
the ultimate BOD) and the effluent COD is 55 mg/L. The non-biodegradable COD in the influent passes through to the 
effluent untouched by microbial action. 
The influent and effluent BOD5 are 80% of the ultimate BOD.

Units
Material quantities, flow rates, and concentrations are expressed in a variety of units. It is most convenient 
to work entirely in SI units (liters, kilograms, and meters). Gallons, pounds, and feet are still used widely 
in the U.S., as they were once in the UK and some other countries. Converting units is a nuisance, but 
many engineers sooner or later will be retrofitting an old design that used these units. Therefore, some 
knowledge of both systems of units is a useful complement to one’s skill set.

Tables 2.2 and 2.3 give the most common units used in material balances. Volumetric flow rate is measured 
as liters per hour, cubic meters per second, gallons per hour, and so on. Temperature and pressure, within 
ordinary limits, have a negligible effect on the volume of liquids. 
Air and other gases expand and contract with changes in temperature and pressure and volume must be 
reported either at standard conditions or at the actual temperature and pressure of the gas.

Measures of Pollution
Material flows are expressed in terms of mass per time, such as kilograms per hour (kg/h), kg-moles per 
hour (kg-mol/h), and lb/day. Mass flow is computed from the volumetric flow, density of the material, 
and the concentration of the pollutant in the material. 
A mixture is described by giving the concentration of each species in the mixture. Concentration can 
be expressed as mass per unit mass, mass per unit volume, or volume per unit volume. In solids it is 
common to report concentration as mass per unit mass, for example mg of pollutant per kg of dry solid 
material. Note that 1 mg/kg is one part per million (ppm) on a dry mass basis. In solids and liquids, 
ppm is always a mass ratio. In a gas, ppm indicates one part in a million parts based on volume, and it 
should be identified by ppmv instead of simply as ppm.
2.4	
Liquids, Sludge and Solids 
Concentrations in liquids are given as mass per volume concentrations, such as grams per liter (g/L), 
milligrams per liter (mg/L), and micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m3). They may also be expressed as 
mass ratios, such as parts per million (ppm) or parts per billion (ppb). 
When the specific gravity of the liquid is 1.000, mg/L and ppm are equivalent. One liter of solution weighs 
1 kg = 1,000,000 mg and 1 mg pollutant in 1,000,000 mg of solution is the same as 1 mg pollutant in 
1 liter of solution. Interchanging mg/L and ppm is acceptable for municipal sewage (which is 99.99% 
water), and for many industrial wastewaters, and dilute slurries of low-density solids. It should not be 
used for highly saline wastewater, sludge, soil, or sediments. 
Concentrations of pollutants in dense slurries, sludge, sediments, soil, and other solids are given as 
mass ratios. It is important to make clear whether the mass of bulk material is on a dry or wet basis.  
A concentration of 1 mg/kg means 1 milligram of pollutant in 1 kilogram of dry material; 1 µg/kg means 
1 microgram of pollutant in 1 kilogram of dry material. Also, a concentration of 1 mg/kg means 1 part 
per million and 1 µg/kg means 1 part per billion.
Concentration as a weight percent can be used for solids or liquids. To say that sludge is “4% solids by 
weight” means that 4% of the total sludge mass is solids. The total sludge mass includes the water and 
the solids. Thus, 4% solids by weight also means 96% water by weight. And it means 0.04 kg dry solids 
per kg of wet sludge. 
Example 2.4 SLUDGE VOLUME AND MASS
An industry is holding 8000 m3 of dense industrial sludge that has specific gravity 1.3. Calculate the sludge mass.
•	
One cubic meter of water weighs 1000 kg
•	
One cubic meter of the sludge weighs 1300 kg
•	
Sludge mass = (8000 m3)(1300 kg/m3) = 10,400,000 kg = 10,400 metric tons

Example 2.5 MERCURY IN WATER
A wastewater effluent of 1000 liters per hour contains an average of 6 µg/L mercury (Hg). Calculate the mass flow of 
mercury discharged per day (g/d).
•	
Volume of water = (1000 L/h)(24 h/d) = 24,000 L/d
•	
Each liter contains 6 µg = 0.006 mg = 0.000,006 g Hg
•	
Mass of Hg discharged = (24,000 L/d)(6 µg/L)(1 g/1,000,000 µg) = 0.144 g Hg/d
Example 2.6 CADMIUM IN SLUDGE
How much cadmium, Cd, is added to a farm field if 20 m3 of liquid sludge that is 6% solids (by weight) is incorporated 
into soil? The density of the liquid sludge is 1030 kg/m3. The measured concentration of cadmium in the sludge is 10 
ppm, defined in terms of the dry sludge solids. 
•	
10 ppm = 10 mg Cd/1,000,000 mg dry sludge solids = 10 mg Cd/kg dry solids
•	
Dry solids in the sludge = (20 m3)(1030 kg/m3)(0.06) = 1236 kg
•	
Cd contained in the dry solids = (1236 kg dry solids)(10 mg Cd/106 kg dry solids) = 0.01236 kg

Example 2.7 SOLIDS IN SLUDGE
Sludge, a slurry of solids and water, is pumped from a wastewater sedimentation basin at specific gravity 1.03, total solids 
concentration 6%, and volumetric flow rate of 50 m3/d. Calculate the mass flow rate of the sludge and the dry solids.
•	
1 m3 of water has a mass of 1,000 kg
•	
1 m3 of sludge has a mass of 1.03(1000) =1030 kg
•	
Mass flow rate of sludge pumped = (50 m3/d)(1030 kg/m3) =51,500 kg/d
•	
Mass flow rate of dry sludge solids = (0.06)(51,500 kg/d) = 3090 kg/d
Example 2.8 SAMPLING AN AIR DUCT
A rectangular air duct has a total area of 3.2 m2 that has been divided into four 0.8 m2 sectors. Figure 2.4 shows the dust 
concentration (mg/m3) and the air velocity (m/s) data, which are at 20°C and 1 atm pressure. Calculate the total air flow 
rate and the mass emission rate for dust. 
For the top left sector	
 
•	
Air flow rate = (0.8 m2)(4 m/s) = 3.2 m3/s 
•	
Mass flow rate of dust = (3.2 m3 /s)(0.11 mg/m3) = 0.352 mg/s
Total air flow = (0.8 m2)(4 m/s) + (0.8 m2)(4.1 m/s) + (0.8 m2)(4.4 m/s) + (0.8 m2)(4.2 m/s) 
 = 3.2 m3/s + 3.28 m3/s + 3.52 m3/s + 3.36 m3/s = 13.36 m3/s
Total mass flow of dust 
 = (3.2 m3 /s)(0.11 mg/m3) + (3.28 m3 /s)(0.13 mg/m3) + (3.52 m3 /s)(0.16 mg/m3) + (3.36 m3 /s)(0.15 mg/m3)
 = 0.352 mg/s + 0.4264 mg/s + 0.5632 mg/s + 0.504 mg/s = 1.8456 mg/s
Note: Multiplying the average air flow rate and the average dust concentration will give the wrong answer.
•	
	Average air flow = 3.34 m3/s
•	
	Average dust concentration = 0.1375 mg/m3
•	
	Mass flow of dust = 4(3.34)(0.1375) = 1.837 mg/s

Example 2.9 ORGANIC WASTEWATER LOADING
The influent to a wastewater treatment plant has a flow of 10 million gallons per day (mgd) and a 5-day BOD concentration 
of 250 mg/L. What is the organic load in units of pounds of BOD per day?
•	
Assume the wastewater specific gravity = 1.00
•	
Assume specific weight of wastewater = 8.34 lb/gal
•	
Mass flow of wastewater = (8.34 lb/gal)(10,000,000 gal/day) = 83,400,000 lb/day

The Ideal Gas Law
Gases expand as temperature is increased and compress as pressure is increased, so gas volume or 
volumetric flow rate have no useful meaning until the corresponding gas temperature and pressure 
are known. 
The most used “standard conditions” are those of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry 
(IUPAC) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Other organizations have 
adopted alternative definitions of standard conditions.
Normal cubic meters per hour (Nm3/h) is the volumetric flow rate for gases at 0°C and 1 atm  
(101.325 kPa).
In the U.S. a common measure is scfm to indicate ’standard cubic feet per minute’ or acfm to indicate 
‘actual cubic feet per minute’. The ‘standard’ refers to a reference condition known in chemistry and 
physics as standard temperature and pressure (STP). A similar reference condition in industrial hygiene 
and air pollution work is the normal condition (normal temperature and pressure, or NTP). Several 
widely used definitions for the reference, or “standard” conditions are given in Table 2.4.

Gas concentrations are usually measured as a volumetric ratio, typically parts per million by volume, 
ppmv. The ppmv concentration is independent of changes in pressure and temperature because all gases 
in a mixture expand or contract to the same extent. For example, if the concentration of SO2 in air is 15 
ppmv, then every million volumes of air contains 15 volumes of SO2 regardless of how the gas mixture 
is compressed or expanded. This is one advantage of using ppmv units for air pollution work.

A mass concentration, say µg/m3 or mg/m3, is needed to make a material balance. The mass concentration 
is calculated using the molecular mass of the gaseous pollutant. Corrections for pressure and temperature 
may be required. These corrections are made using the ideal gas law:
PV = nRT
where	
P = pressure, atm
T = absolute temperature, K
V = gas volume, L
n = number of moles of gas
R = universal gas constant = 0.08205 L atm/mole K
The value of R depends on the units used for pressure, temperature, and volume, as given in Table 2.5.

Example 2.10 MASS OF A GAS
Calculate the mass of the gas that occupies a volume of 2000 L at 20°C and 1.2 atm and has molar mass = 16 g/mole.
For these units the universal gas constant is 0.08205 L atm/mole K. Absolute temperature: = 20°C + 273 = 293 K.  
From the ideal gas law: PV = nRT
(1.2 atm)(2,000 L) = n (0.08205 L atm/mole K)(293 K)
n = 99.8 moles
Total mass of the gas = (99.8 moles) (16 g/mole) = 1600 g
2.5.2	
Pollutant Concentrations in Gases
Pollutant concentrations in gases can be given in terms of volume (ppmv) or mass (mg/m3). Conversion 
from one form to the other is accomplished using the molar mass (MM) of the pollutant and the ideal 
gas law. One g-mole of an ideal gas occupies a volume 0.02241 m3 (22.41 L) at standard temperature 
and pressure (0°C = 273 K and 1 atm). One lb-mole occupies a volume of 359 ft3 at STP. Also, 1 m3 of 
an ideal gas contains 1/0.02241 m3 = 44.623 g-moles of the gas.
The mass (mg) of a gas occupying 1 m3 is 
where	 MM is the molar mass of the gas (g/mole). 
If a gas mixture contains a pollutant at a concentration of 1 ppmv, or 1 m3 of pollutant in 1,000,000 m3 
of mixture, the mass concentration will be given by
A simple adjustment is needed when the gas is at non-standard temperature and pressure. The mass of 
pollutant will remain constant while the volume of the gas in which it is contained expands or contracts.

Measures of Pollution
Pollution regulations in the United States typically reference their pollutant limits to an ambient 
temperature of 20 to 25°C as noted in Table 2.4. 
Example 2.11 CONVERTING FROM VOLUME CONCENTRATION TO MASS CONCENTRATION
The concentration of a gaseous pollutant in air is 50 ppmv. The molecular mass of the pollutant is 16 g/mol. Find the 
concentration as mg/m3 at standard conditions. 
Example 2.12 MASS CONCENTRATION IN GASES
A gaseous emission has an SO2 concentration of 25 ppmv. The gas temperature and pressure are 26°C and 1.1 atm. The 
molar mass of SO2 is 64 g/mole. 
Mass concentration of SO2 at standard temperature and pressure (STP) of 1 atm and 0°C.

The volumetric flow of toluene is
	
(60,000 m3/h)(1,200 m3/1,000,000 m3) = 72 m3/h.
The density of toluene is 4.12 kg/m3 (at STP). The mass flow of toluene is
	
(72 m3/h)(4.12 kg/m3) = 297 kg/h

Dalton’s Law of Partial Pressure
Dalton’s law of partial pressure states that at constant temperature the total pressure exerted by a mixture 
of gases in a definite volume is equal to the sum of the individual pressures each gas would exert if it 
occupied the same total volume. In other words, the total pressure of a gas mixture is equal to the sum 
of the partial pressures of the individual components of the mixture. For a mixture of gases A, B and 
C, this is

Example 2.14 MIXTURE OF FOUR IDEAL GASES
The contents of four rigid flasks of one-liter volume are to be mixed together to prepare a calibration gas mixture. The 
flasks contain sulfur dioxide (SO2) at 75 mm Hg pressure, nitrogen (N2) at 120 mm Hg, methane (CH4) at 45 mm Hg, and 
carbon monoxide (CO) at 60 mm Hg. What will be the final pressure after these four flasks are combined in a one-liter flask?
	
	
PT = 75 mm Hg + 120 mm Hg + 45 mm Hg + 60 mm Hg = 300 mm Hg
Example 2.15 APPARENT MOLECULAR MASS OF DRY AIR
A gas that is composed of a single species has a molar mass, but a mixture of gases, such as air, does not because there 
is no thing as an “air molecule.” Nevertheless, if one imagines that air does consist of “air molecules”, a standard mixture 
of air can be defined and an apparent molar mass can be calculated. 
The molar mass of this mixture will be the weighted average of the molar masses of each of the individual component. 
Each component will exert its molecular mass (Mi) weighted by its volume fraction (VFi). The volume fraction is the 
decimal equivalent of the volume percentage. For example, air is 78.084% nitrogen by volume and the volume fraction 
of nitrogen is 0.78084. The standard composition of dry air and the calculations are given in Table 2.6

Adjusting Pollutant Concentrations to Reference Conditions
Air pollutant concentrations sometimes must be adjusted or ‘corrected’ to concentrations at specified 
reference conditions of moisture content, oxygen content or carbon dioxide content. For example, a 
regulation might limit the concentration in a dry combustion exhaust gas to 55 ppmv NOx (at a specified 
reference temperature and pressure) corrected to 3 volume percent O2 in the dry gas. Another regulation 
might limit the concentration of total particulate matter to 200 mg/m3 of an emitted gas (at a specified 
reference temperature and pressure) corrected to a dry basis and further corrected to 12 volume percent 
CO2 in the dry gas. The adjustments are explained by example.
Environmental agencies in the U.S. often use the terms scfd (or dscf) to denote a ‘standard’ cubic foot of 
dry gas. Likewise, scmd (or dscm) denotes a ‘standard’ cubic meter of gas. Since there is no universally 
accepted set of ‘standard’ temperature and pressure, such usage can be confusing. It is recommended 
that the reference temperature and pressure always be clearly specified when stating gas volumes or gas 
flow rates.

Example 2.16 ADJUSTING GAS COMPOSITION TO A DRY BASIS
A gaseous emission has a pollutant concentration of Cwet basis = 40 ppmv and 10 volume percent of water vapor. The  
40 ppmv should be designated as the “wet basis” pollutant concentration. The adjustment of the measured “wet basis” 
concentration to a “dry basis” concentration is done using
	
W
where:	
C = Concentration of the air pollutant in the emitted gas
	
W = fraction, by volume, of water vapor in the emitted gas
	
Example 2.17 ADJUSTING GAS COMPOSITION TO A REFERENCE OXYGEN CONTENT
A measured NOx concentration of 45 ppmv in a dry gas having 5 volume % O2. This is adjusted to give a measured 
pollutant concentration in a dry emitted gas with a measured O2 content to an equivalent pollutant concentration in a 
dry emitted gas with a specified reference amount of O2 using 
	
where:	
CR = corrected concentration of a dry gas with a specified reference volume % O2

Conclusion
Pollutants have many physical and chemical forms. They may be carried by water or some other liquid, 
or by air or some other gas, or they may be part of a solid material, such as soil. They may be dissolved 
or particulate.

Measures of Pollution
Specific chemicals, such as copper, chlorine, or benzene, are measured as copper, chlorine, or benzene. 
In wastewater treatment, pollutants with similar properties are lumped together because it is too difficult 
to measure individual species or simply because it is not necessary. Suspended solids, volatile solids, 
dissolved solids, biochemical oxygen demand, and chemical oxygen demand are ‘lumped’ measurements.
Likewise, environmental quality standards may be written for specific chemicals, which is the case for 
toxic air and water pollutants, or for lumped parameters in most municipal wastewater effluents.
This variety of pollutant forms and measurements generates the need to use a variety of units, such as 
mg/L in water, mg/kg in solids, and volume percent or ppmv in air and gases. 
The difficulty in working with unfamiliar units is not making the arithmetic conversions between systems. 
It is losing one’s sense of the magnitude of quantities. Working in treatment plants where flows are 
measured in gallons and million gallons, and where pipes are measured in inches, gives the experienced 
engineer an instinctive sense of the correct size. Working in cubic meters and centimeters creates a 
questioning attitude of “How big is that?” or “Does that seem about the right size.” We hope students 
who use this book are not too much troubled by that feeling, when the examples are in unfamiliar units.

Pollution Prevention
3	 Pollution Prevention
3.1	
The Design Problem
This chapter is different than the others. It is about ideas and not calculations. The goal is to demonstrate 
how knowing the material balance will stimulate ideas about pollution prevention and control. The 
ideas are illustrated with case studies that show the materials that move through the manufacturing 
and pollution control system. In all cases, mass in equals mass out, which is required by the law of 
conservation of mass. The examples are quantitative, but the methods of calculating the material balance 
are not discussed until Chapter 4.
The case studies are food processing, metal fabrication, organic chemical manufacturing, and 
semiconductor manufacturing. A possible first reaction may be “I don’t know anything about those 
industries. I won’t be able to understand the case studies.” Don’t be intimidated. There will be unfamiliar 
names of processes, chemicals and equipment, but you need not worry too much about these details. 
Focus on what the case studies have in common – the material balance concept – and you will learn. 
Pollution prevention is done in the manufacturing process. Watch for the changes that reduce water use 
and waste quantities. Waste treatment is done on whatever materials are discharged as waste liquids, gas, 
or solids. Watch for how the characteristics of the wastes, in particular the presence of toxic chemicals, 
will influence decisions about waste management. These concepts, and the material balance, are useful 
in any kind of process. That is the message of this chapter.
Some students may wish to come back to this chapter when they are more familiar with basic concepts 
and vocabulary. This is fine, and a second reading is recommended, but do not skip over it on the first 
reading. It will be helpful to use the examples to build the concept of processing systems and how they 
can be rearranged and improved, and how the material balance data guides the innovation.
The goal in pollution prevention is to find low-cost or no-cost improvements to save money. The savings 
may come from higher yield, reclaimed material, lower utility costs, lower raw material cost, or lower 
waste disposal cost. During design these savings are made or lost at the drawing board. 
An existing industry must first find waste and then reduce it. Accounting for all the material flowing 
through the system is the ultimate material balance exercise. Acquiring the necessary data requires a 
good deal of care and effort. Many industries do not know the flow of water into or the flow of waste 
materials out of various processes. Sometimes the best estimate of a pollutant discharge comes from 
purchasing records. It may be known, for example, that mercury is being purchased and put into the 
process, but mercury is not detected in the discharges from the plant (Caban & Chapman 1972).

3.2	
Pollution Audit – The First Steps
The first step for an existing industry is to walk through manufacturing areas, plant utilities, and waste 
treatment facilities and look for waste.
•	 Look in the waste bins.
•	 Identify the various waste streams produced on site.
•	 Look at packaging for both suppliers and customers. Packaging is paid for twice – once to 
buy it and once to dispose of it. 
•	 Water use and disposal is critical because you pay for the clean water input and the 
wastewater output. Check meters and bills to be sure you pay only for what you are 
discharging. Turn off water to idle processes. Eliminate leaks and dripping faucets. 
•	 Look for energy savings. Saving water almost always saves energy, and vice versa. 
•	 Compressed air leaks are expensive, but easy to find and eliminate.
Information about the manufacturing and waste treatment processes must be organized.
1.	 Draw a flow diagram of the manufacturing process. The starting diagram might look like 
Figure 3.1. Many details remain to be filled in.
2.	 Identify and quantify all raw material inputs, products and byproducts. Help will be needed 
from the purchasing department. Many raw materials are sold under trade names so it 
may take some work to discover the chemical components. Material safety data sheets are 
useful here. 
3.	 Check all permits, compliance test data, violations and complaints, past and potential spills, 
underground tank inventory, and accidental containment plans.
4.	 Identify the source of all pollutants and waste discharges (solid wastes, drums, and gaseous 
emissions as well as wastewater). Fugitive gaseous emissions represent a special challenge to 
locate and quantify. Maps of drainage and ventilation ducts must be checked. Existing plans 
may be wrong in the details of plumbing and drainage and some sewers and drains may 
not be shown at all. It may be necessary to use dye or smoke to trace some discharges. Flow 
meters and sampling devices may need to be installed.
5.	 Quantify all discharges in terms of flow and contaminant levels. Make the material balance 
on water and other contaminants. Getting an accurate accounting of material flow in a 
real system requires care and effort. If the material balance is based, wholly or in part, on 
field measurements, there will be discrepancies due to imperfections in the measurement 
process or failure to identify and measure all inputs and outputs. Similar problems exist with 
regard to getting representative samples of discharges and of measuring concentrations in 
the laboratory. All sampling must be coordinated with the laboratory to eliminate mistakes 
about sample preservation, sample size, and whether measurements will be made in the field 
(pH, temperature) or in the laboratory.

sources in terms of magnitude, toxicity, or treatment cost. Develop a list of ideas, screen and 
rank them, and work toward implementing the best.

Case Study – Sweet Potato Canning
A sweet potato canning factory processes sweet potatoes coming directly from the fields. Operation is 10 
h/day, 6 days a week, for a six-week season. Figure 3.2 shows the amount of water used and the pollutant 
load from each manufacturing step for an input of 1,000 kg/h. There is no way to compute these values 
from theory so they must be measured in the plant. This is laborious and expensive, but necessary to 
support intelligent redesign decisions.

For every 1000 kg (1 T) of sweet potatoes that comes from the field, 400 kg leaves as canned product, 
520 kg is lost immediately as solid waste (dirt, plant material, and substandard vegetables), and 80 kg 
leaves in the wastewater.
The total water use is 10,585 L/T. One-third of this is used for cleanup and cooling. Another one-third 
is used in the canning process. Preparation for canning (lye bath peel removal, snippers, abrasive and 
brush washer) accounts for another 25% of water use. The retorts (industrial pressure cookers) use the 
most water, but the wastewater is clean. Cleanup uses a lot of water and contributes six to eight percent 
of the pollutant load. The cooling water is a large volume but it never becomes polluted.

Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and suspended solids (SS) are the only pollutants of interest in 
this industry. The pollutant concentrations of the combined wastewater are 2,940 mg/L BOD and 1,480 
mg/L SS. The mass pollutant loads per ton of product are 31.1 kg BOD and 15.6 kg of SS. The lye bath/
peel removal, snippers, and the abrasive peelers are the source of roughly 90% of the BOD and SS loads. 
Slightly more than half of the total BOD load comes from the lye bath peel removal step. Abrasive peeling 
contributes 25% of the BOD load. Peeling accounts for almost all of the suspended solids load.
Peeling is the first target for process redesign. A search of the food processing literature and consultation 
with experts suggests dry caustic peeling as an option. The peel is removed as a pasty solid. This eliminates 
the abrasive scrubbing step and reduces the wastewater flow by 80% and BOD and SS loads by 90%. The 
estimated waste reductions are in Table 3.1

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Table 3.1 Waste loadings for the conventional process and the dry caustic process.
There are direct cost savings by reducing water use, chemicals, steam, fuel, and waste surcharges. In 
addition there will be slightly more product to sell because peel loss is reduced. The savings from 
wastewater and solids disposal and water purchased is $710 per day or $25,560 per canning season.
Are there other improvements to consider? It may be possible to recycle some water from the retort to 
the first washing step. The lye can be cleaned of solids and reused. The high-solids water coming from 
washing, snipping, brush washers, and trimming could be screened to remove 60–80% of the solids. 
This simultaneously reduces the BOD and the wastewater disposal costs. 
Making the material balance was the key to setting priorities and selling the solution to management.

Case Study – Water Reuse and Toxic Metals Management
An industry uses 12 L/m of city water to supply three manufacturing processes. The process water contains 
200 ppm total dissolved solids (TDS), which is excellent for the manufacturing process. 
The objectives are to minimize the discharge to the city sewer, eliminate the toxic sludge, and minimize 
all waste outputs.

Table 3.2 and Figure 3.3 summarize what is known. The three waste streams are combined for treatment. 
The tumbler water contains about 5,000 ppm of non-toxic suspended solids. The acid-etch water contains 
dissolved toxic metals. The alkaline rinse water contains 230 ppm TDS but is not toxic. 
Most of the solids, which are non-toxic, come from the tumbler water. The pollutants carried in the 
acid etch water and alkaline rinse water are dissolved; they are free of suspended solids. The alkaline 
rinse water is not important in terms of pollution, but it contributes 20 L/m, or 17%, of the total flow.
Coagulants enhance the removal of suspended solids in a settling tank. This also causes the removal 
of some toxic metals so sludge from the settling tank is contaminated with toxic metals from the acid 
etch rinse. The sludge is thickened by gravity and dewatered in a filter press. Mixing the metals with the 
non-toxic tumbler solids creates a filter cake that must he handled as a hazardous waste. 
The effluent is neutralized by adding acid or base as needed. The effluent has a total dissolved solids 
concentration of 600 mg/L TDS, which is too high for water reuse.

The salt that prevents the effluent from being recycled is proportional to the drag-out from the acid 
etch and alkaline rinses. The chemicals added for neutralization are also proportional to the drag-out 
and they increase the salinity.
The engineers have some ideas after seeing the material balance information.
Engineer 1	
We should treat the tumbler water separately with some sort of solid-liquid separation 
process. Removing the suspended solids should make the water suitable for reuse. The 
solids will be non-hazardous for purposes of disposal to a landfill.
Engineer 2	
True, that would mean having two clarifiers, one for the tumbler water and one for the 
other combined wastes. There is no room to build a new unit for this waste stream
Engineer 1	
There are other ways to removed solids, like microfiltration. This is a membrane process 
that is widely used and extremely versatile. I would expect to find a membrane that 
would do the job.
Engineer 2	
Let’s make a quick phone call to Membranes International.

Engineer 2	
You are right. There is an ultrafiltration system that will deliver excellent water with 
500–600 ppm TDS and a reject slurry with 35% solids. The volume of water in the slurry 
is 1 L/m or less, so let’s say we can recycle the 79 L/m of tumbler water. The operating 
pressure is reasonable. This slurry will be non-hazardous and therefore disposal is not 
a problem. 
Engineer 1	
The next step should be to reduce the drag-out from the acid etch and alkaline rinses. 
This will reduce the salt buildup and the metals in the sludge. 
Engineer 2	
There are low-cost ways to do that. Modify the drip tanks and put in air knives to blow-
dry the parts before rinsing. Put in automatic shut-off valves and countercurrent rinsing. 
That will reduce each rinse by half and the salt content will be low. We could recycle  
11 L/m water. We can’t recycle everything. Our effluent is like the blow-down on a 
cooling tower or a boiler. Some effluent is needed to control the salt build up. 
Engineer 1	
That gets us to the flow sheet shown in Figure 3.4. That is a nice improvement. The volume 
of sludge and the metals content are greatly reduced. The sludge may still be hazardous, 
depending on the metal concentration and its stability in the RCRA leaching test.
Engineer 2	
We could treat the acid-etch water separately. This would reduce the sludge volume and 
it might make metal recovery possible. 
Engineer 1	
Right. And the volume is so small – the volume for one day is 10,800 L (10 L/m for 18 
hours), the same as the flow for one hour when we used 180 L/m of city water. That 
means the existing settling tank has sufficient volume to treat one day’s waste as a batch. 
Add chemicals directly to the settling tank, mix it, settle the precipitate, allow the sludge 
to thicken, and dewater it. 
Engineer 2	
What happens to the alkaline rinse? It’s non-toxic. We might mix it with the tumbler 
water and use the ultrafiltration system to recover a few more liters of water.
Engineer 1	
Figure 3.5 is a sketch of the proposed system. Details need to be checked to be sure it 
will work, but it is an excellent working plan. City water purchase is reduced from 120 
L/m to 5 L/m. Most solids are in a non-toxic slurry. The metals are concentrated in a 
very small volume of sludge.

Case Study – Reducing Phenol Emissions
An industry produces approximately 100,000 kg/d of phenolic chemicals using a batch process to react 
a chlorinated organic chemical with an excess of a phenolic chemical. The reaction is carried out in an 
aqueous solution. The products can be a variety of specific chemicals, depending upon the chemical 
that is reacted with phenol. 
Phenol, caustic (NaOH), an organic chloride (R-Cl) and water are charged to a reactor. After a brief period 
of mixing and settling, sulfuric acid and benzene are added. When the reaction reaches the desired state 
the organic layer that contains benzene, unreacted raw material, and product is decanted. A large volume 
of brine is discarded as waste. Washwater comes from cleaning the equipment with water at the end of 
processing. 
Wastewater is restricted to less than 0.1 mg/L phenol and less than 0.05 mg/L benzene. Emissions of total 
organics to the air is limited to 4.5 kg/d maximum and 2 kg/h maximum. Present performance, given 
in Table 3.3 and Figure 3.6 shows that the existing system violates the air and water pollution laws. A 
pollution audit is needed to discover where and how the emissions originate.

A typical batch leaving the decanter contains 70% benzene, 28% product, 1% phenol, and some tars. 
This is fractionated by distillation in stages. The first stage removes benzene and phenol for recycle over 
a 10-hour period. In the second phase, 98% of the product is recovered over a one-hour period. At the 
conclusion of the distillation, 25,000 kg of tars remain in the still. Tars are stored in a pond, but new 
regulations prohibit this in the future.

The distillate is condensed using a water-cooled non-contact condenser followed by a two-stage steam 
jet and a direct-contact condenser. Non-contact means that the cooling water and the condensed vapor 
are separated by a metal surface so the cooling water is not contaminated. The water effluent from the 
direct-contact condenser is called the tailwater. It is heavily contaminated because the cooling water is 
sprayed into the vapor and whatever chemical is removed becomes part of the tailwater. There are losses 
of 500 kg of benzene and 5 kg of phenol through the condenser to the atmosphere. In addition, 485 kg 
of benzene and 10 kg of phenol are lost to the sewer in the condenser tailwater.
The obvious change is to increase the efficiency of the condensers. The direct-contact condenser will be 
removed. Condensing capacity can be increased by installing a larger condenser, or by using a colder 
condensing fluid. This will reduce air emissions and keep benzene and phenol out of the wastewater. 
If condensation alone cannot solve the problem, additional emission controls will be needed, such as 
an incineration or adsorption system. Heat recovery from an incinerator might be economical. Benzene 
recovery from a carbon adsorption system would be possible. 
The still bottoms are combustible. They could be incinerated to produce steam for use in the distillation 
process, or they might be shipped elsewhere for burning.
Phenol and benzene are both biodegradable so the water pollution problem could be solved with biological 
wastewater treatment at the industry or in a municipal facility. Disadvantages, aside from cost, are that 
these chemicals are destroyed and not available for reuse, sludge will be produced, and volatilization of 
the benzene from the treatment plant might be an air pollution problem in itself. The goal should be to 
eliminate these chemicals from the wastewater.
It should be possible to reuse the washwater in the reactor, recover phenol by adsorption, segregate 
cooling water so it does not become contaminated, and practice other pollution prevention strategies, 
such as finding a less toxic solvent to replace benzene.

Case Study – Reclaiming Gallium Arsenide from 
Semiconductor Manufacturing
Gallium arsenide, a mixture of gallium and arsenic, is a semiconductor that is used to make computer 
chips and solar panels. Gallium is a byproduct of the smelting of other metals, notably aluminum and 
zinc. It is more rare than gold. Arsenic is toxic. 
More than 15 steps are needed to make gallium arsenide (GaAs) semiconductor crystals, including crystal 
growth, ingot grinding, wafer slicing, etching, cleaning, etc. Several of these steps generate a waste slurry 
of fine GaAs particles. In addition there is hydrofluoric acid (HF) from wafer etching waste and acid waste 
streams from other processing operations. Figure 3.7 summarizes the material balance on gallium arsenide.

The CaF2 and GaAs solids are removed with the sludge, which is dewatered with a filter press. The arsenic 
makes the sludge cake a hazardous waste that contains 735.6 kg/yr of GaAs solids. 
Obviously the form of the arsenic is critical in choosing a treatment process. The arsenic in this wastewater 
exists primarily as 10-micron particles that can be removed by filtration. Figure 3.8 lists some feasible 
solid-liquid separation processes.
The redesigned process keeps the coolant side and the non-coolant side wastewaters separate to facilitate 
water recovery. The coolant side slurry recovery process is a filter that recovers 620 kg/yr of GaAs solids. 
The filter backwash water is combined with the HF wastewater and neutralized. 
The filtrate from sludge processing is combined with the hydrofluoric acid waste for treatment with lime. 
The chemistry is the same as shown earlier, but the volume of water treated is reduced and the filter cake 
now contains 113.1 kg/yr GaAs (54.5 kg Ga and 58.6 kg As). At this concentration the arsenic contaminant 
in the CaF2 sludge cake is low enough that the sludge is not classified as hazardous and the sludge can be 
sold. The high pH filtrate from the sludge dewatering is used to neutralize the dilute acid waste stream. The 
neutralized effluent can be discharged to the sewer system. The redesigned system for arsenic recovery is 
shown in Figure 3.9.

Figure 3.9 Redesigned wastewater treatment system for arsenic recovery (Hertz 1990).
It was estimated (Hertz 1990) that there would be savings of $35,000 per year in landfill costs for sludge 
disposal costs if the sludge did not contain arsenic and $100,000 could be earned from the sale of CaF2. 
If GaAs could be recovered, its value would be $5,000 per year. In addition there would be an estimated 
$15,000 savings in reduced safety and health costs. The price of gallium today is $700/kg.

Conclusion
The material balance is the most valuable tool for determining the magnitude of a pollution problem 
and stimulating ideas about pollution prevention. We use it to expand fragmentary information into a 
more complete picture that stimulates the synthesis-analysis iterative cycle. The methods for doing this 
are explained in the next chapter.
Opportunities for pollution prevention in an existing plant may be discovered during a plant walk-
around and from discussions with operators and plant engineers. When the easy fruit has been harvested, 
sampling and analytical work may be needed to assemble the necessary flow and pollutant load data. We 
have skipped over the important details of how to design a sampling program, how to measure flows 
and collect representative samples, and the parameters that should be measured. Data are expensive, but 
information is valuable and short cuts will not be rewarded.
The plant ‘walk-around’ during design is a creative exercise to imagine the kinds and sources of possible 
pollution and to use material balance calculations to estimate quantities. In particular, we hope to discover 
opportunities to minimize the creation of wastes and to recover and recycle material. Recognizing that 
zero emissions is almost never possible, the material balance also guides the designer in formulating 
treatment systems to deal with pollutant discharges that cannot be avoided.

Conservation of Mass
4	 Conservation of Mass
4.1	
The Basic Principle
Conservation of mass means that mass is neither created nor destroyed during ordinary physical, chemical, 
and biological activities. Using the law of conservation of mass to account for material is commonly 
referred to as making a material balance or making a mass balance.
The law of conservation of mass is much like the principles of accounting used to keep track of money in 
a bank. The bank does not create or destroy money. All the money that enters a bank in a given period 
must accumulate in the vault or leave the bank.
In the same way, all the mass that enters an enclosed region must accumulate within the region or leave 
the region. We are concerned only with the passage of material across the boundaries of a region. The 
internal details of the machinery are not important. 
The basic material balance, pictured in Figure 4.1, is
The left-side diagram is a special case where there is no accumulation of material within the region. The 
right-side shows the more general material balance.
The balance is maintained even when material species are being created or destroyed within the region. 
If a solid is converted to a gas by combustion, the mass of the solid destroyed must equal the mass of 
combustion products that are created. (Also, since we are not concerned with nuclear explosions or 
generating energy in a nuclear reactor, our atoms will remain intact to provide a basis for analyzing 
material flow.)
The units are identical for each term in the equation. If ‘mass in’ has units of kg then ‘mass out’ and all 
other terms must also be kg. Form the habit of checking units before calculating.

Conservation of Mass
If no chemical reaction creates or destroys a particular species, the conservation of that species is
Accumulation can be positive or negative; it is negative if there is a decrease of mass within the region. 
Conservation of mass applies to every natural and constructed system and the material balance is the 
most important tool for analyzing these systems. In this chapter you will see it used on air pollution, 
water and wastewater treatment, and solid waste processing. Try to understand what the processes do 
and remember the terminology. In this way you will learn a good deal about pollution control while 
you master making material balances. 
Example 4.1 SOLVENT LOSS IN A PAINT SPRAY BOOTH
Unpainted metal parts enter a spray-painting booth at a rate of 300 kg/h, where they are sprayed with a solvent based 
paint. Paint usage is 10 kg/h and the paint is 50% solvent and 50% solid pigment. The dry painted parts leave the booth 
at a rate of 304 kg/hr. Assume that all solvent has evaporated from the adhered paint when the part leaves the spray 
booth. A portion of the paint pigment adheres to the metal parts, but some is wasted. Solvent is lost by evaporation 
and with paint droplets that did not adhere to the parts. 
The first step is to show on a diagram, Figure 4.2, what is known about the problem. 
Figure 4.2 Paint spray booth material balance
Overall material balance:	
Clean Parts + Paint = Dry Painted Parts + Waste Paint
	
	
	
300 kg/h + 10 kg/h= 304 kg/h+ 6 kg/h Waste
Solvent material balance:	
Solvent In = Waste Solvent
	
	
	
5 kg/h = 5 kg/h
Pigment material balance:	
Pigment In = Pigment on painted parts + Waste Pigment
	
	
	
 5 kg/h = 4 kg/h + 1 kg/h
This simple calculation is useful in making a plan to reduce paint waste and solvent emissions. The amount of solvent 
lost as waste in this process could be reduced by using (1) water-based paint, (2) solvent-base paint with a higher 
pigment content, or (3) solid-deposition painting. The lose of pigment lost could be reduced by using a more focused 
spray or solid-deposition painting.

Conservation of Mass
It is often convenient to deal with mass flow rates, such as kg/h or T/d. The conservation laws then take 
on these special forms.
Steady state is the special case when the rate of accumulation is zero. The sum of the inputs equals the 
sum of the outputs. The rate of material inflow and outflow from the system are not changing with time. 
The volume of liquid or gas in any process vessels is constant. 
Steady state conditions can often be assumed over some time period of interest. This is a great convenience, 
but it is not a cheat or a short cut. Making a steady state analysis for average load, minimum load, and 
peak load often provides a sound basis for design. The assumption also reduces the amount of information 
that is needed, information that usually is lacking during preliminary design.

4.2	
Accumulation of Mass
A process that accumulates material can only do so temporarily so positive accumulation must be followed 
by a period of negative accumulation. Allowing solids to accumulate in the bottom of a settling tank will 
eventually reduce the efficiency, so the solids must be removed at regular intervals. 
The material balance on a process or system that accumulates material will have two parts, one for the 
accumulation phase and one for the cleaning/regeneration phase. These two can be added to get the 
overall material balance for one operating cycle.
Figure 4.3(a) shows an ion exchange process for making high-purity water. Salts and minerals are 
absorbed by resin and replaced by hydrogen ions (H+) and hydroxyl ions (OH-) that combine to form 
water. The feed is water plus dissolved salts; the product water is nearly salt-free. Salts accumulate in 
the ion exchanger.
Figure 4.3(b) is a reverse osmosis process that splits the feed into a high-quality product and concentrated 
reject stream. The flow of water and salts is continuous and at steady state. There is no accumulation of 
salts or water within the system.
Figure 4.4 shows the complete operating cycle for the ion exchange process. The operating cycle is 
shown as one day, which perhaps is a 23-hour production cycle, with salt accumulation, and 1-hour 
regeneration cycle. At the end of the production cycle the ion exchange resin will be exhausted of its 
capacity to exchange salts and it will be regenerated back to its original capacity.

(b) Reverse osmosis process that does not accumulate salts or water.

Figure 4.4 One operating cycle for the ion exchange process includes production, with salt accumulation, 
and regeneration, which removes the accumulate salts.
Many waste treatment processes temporarily accumulate material within the system. Water filters, air 
filters, activated carbon adsorption, and ion exchange resins are examples. These processes operate on 
an alternating cycle of accumulation followed by cleaning or regeneration. Water filters are cleaned 
by backwashing, typically once a day, to remove the accumulated solids. Air filters are cleaned more 
frequently by a reverse pulse of air or by shaking. Ion exchange resins are regenerated by flushing with a 
strong chemical solution (brine or acid or base). Carbon from adsorption processes can be regenerated 
using steam if the adsorbed chemicals are volatile, or by thermal heat if they are not.
4.3	
Style in Material Balance Formulation
Five guidelines in developing the material balance are:
1.	 Draw a block diagram or flow sheet for the problem and show all known quantities and 
streams. Pressures, temperatures, and the like do not need to be shown.
2.	 Decide on the basis for solving the problem, for example, a time interval of one day, or an 
input of 1000 kg.
3.	 Identify tie components. A tie component is an element, molecule, or kind of material that 
goes through the process unchanged. Dry air, water, or an inert solid are good choices as a 
tie component.
4.	 Select the boundaries of the region over which the material balance will be made. The law 
of conservation of mass applies to any and all regions so we are free to try and choose 
boundaries crossed only by one unknown flow to simplify the work.
5.	 Write the material balance equations and check the units. Each term of the equation must 
have the same units.

Example 4.2 AIR EMISSION TEST
During an air emission test, the inlet gas stream to a fabric filter (Figure 4.5) is 4,000 standard m3/min and the particulate 
loading of dust is 0.005 kg/m3. The particulate removal efficiency is 99.25%. Compute the dust concentration in the 
emitted air and the mass of dust removed by the filter. The volume of air removed with the collected dust is negligible.

Example 4.3 SALT TRACER MEASUREMENT OF FLOW
Flow will be measured by adding a known mass of inert tracer, such as chloride or lithium, because it is not possible to 
install a conventional flow meter in a pipe. The tracer concentration is measured after it has mixed with the flow in the 
pipe. The mixing zone is shown in Figure 4.6. Chloride concentration above the injection point is 50 mg/L.
Chloride solution at 200,000 mg/L concentration (20% by weight) is added at a rate of 5 L/m. The concentration measured 
downstream is 1000 mg/L. There is no accumulation of chloride or water within the mixing zone.
Figure 4.6 Diagram of flow measurement by tracer dilution.
Basis = I min
The tie component is chloride
Boundary = mixing zone
Material balance on water: 
	
Water In (L/min) = Water Out (L/min) = W L/min + 5 L/min
Material balance for chloride, with units of mg/min:
	
(W L/min)(50 mg/L) + (5 L/min)(200,000 mg/L) = (W + 5 L/min)(1000 mg/L)
	
chloride from upstream 	
chloride added 	
chloride leaving downstream
	
	
50W + 1,000,000 = 1000W + 5000
	
	
(950 mg/L) (W L/min) = 995,000 mg/m
	
	
W = 1,047 L/min (270.2 gpm = 0.3891 mgd)
The precision of this value is misleading because the chloride concentrations cannot be measured exactly. The reported 
concentration could be in error by ±5%. The tracer injection rate may not be a constant 5 L/m. Let us say, as a practical 
estimate, that the flow is 1,050 L/m. Repeated measurements should be made if greater accuracy is required.

Example 4.4 SLUDGE DEWATERING
A vacuum filter, Figure 4.7, removes water from sludge or slurry. The input sludge is 8% solids by weight. Seventy percent 
of the water in the feed sludge is removed as filtrate, which will be assumed free of solids. All the feed solids and 30% 
of the water in the feed sludge leave as a filter cake. 
Figure 4.7 Vacuum filter removes water from sludge.
Basis: 1000 kg feed sludge
Tie component = water or solids
Boundary = vacuum filter equipment
Material balance on water:	
	
Water in feed = Filtrate + Water in filter cake
	
1000 kg of feed sludge contains (0.92)(1000) = 920 kg of water 
Water in filtrate = 0.7(920 kg) = 644 kg
Volume of filtrate = 0.644 m3/ton of sludge processed.
Water in the filter cake = 920 kg – 644 kg = 276 kg
Material balance on solids:	 	
	
Solids in feed = Solids in filtrate + Solids in filter cake
	
1000 kg of feed sludge contains (0.08)(1000) = 80 kg solids
Filter cake contains 80 kg solids and 276 kg water.
	
Total mass of sludge cake = 80 kg solids + 276 kg water = 356 kg
	
Moisture content = 100(276/356) = 77.5%

Checking the Material Balance for Accuracy
The previous examples use the material balance to determine one or more quantities that have not been 
measured or specified. Another situation is when all inputs and outputs have been measured and a 
check can be made that the material balance is satisfied. This is a way to verify that measurements are 
being made with sufficient accuracy, that sampling procedures are correct, and that all input and output 
streams are included. 
Example 4.7 TWO-STAGE MEMBRANE SEPERATION SYSTEM
Figure 4.10 shows a two-stage process that converts a feed into two products and a reject stream. It doesn’t matter 
what the material is, but for convenience assume it is total solids.
Figure 4.10 A two-stage process with all inputs and outputs measured.

(25 L/s)(980 mg/L) = (16.2 L/s)(60 mg/L) + (5.9 L/s)(120 mg/L) + (2.9 L/s)(2,980 mg/L) ± Error

Reject 2
	
24,500 mg/s = 972 mg/s + 708 mg/s + 8,642 mg/s ± Error
	
24,500 mg/s= 10,322 mg/s ± Error
	
Error = 14,178 mg/s
The imbalance is too large to be explained by random measurement error in the total solids concentrations, which 
might reasonably be ±5%. Possibly the reject concentration is in error.
The material balance on module 1 gives
	
Mass of solids into module 2 = (25)(980) – (16.2)(60) = 23,528 mg/s
	
Feed1 	
Product 1 	
Reject 1
Assuming this is correct and Product 2 is correct, the reject from module 2 should be
	
Reject 2 = 23,528 mg/s – (5.9 L/s)(120 mg/L) = 22,820 mg/s
	
Reject 2 concentration = (22,820 mg/s)/2.9 L/s) = 7,869 mg/L
Perhaps the measured value was 7,980 mg/L and the person who made the drawing mistakenly put down 2,980 mg/L. 
Or there may be a problem with totals solids measurements. Either way, more work is needed to quantify the process.

Example 4.8 RECYCLE TO A PRIMARY SETTLING TANK FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENT
A primary clarifier in a wastewater treatment plant receives raw sewage (RS), waste activated sludge (WAS), and centrate 
(C) from a sludge dewatering centrifuge. WAS is waste activated sludge, which is intentionally removed from the activated 
sludge process to balance the new biomass that is produced by the treatment process. Centrate is the dilute effluent 
from a centrifuge that is used to dewater digested sludge. Primary effluent (PE) and primary sludge (PS) are removed 
from the clarifier. Figure 4.11 shows the process and data measured on the process are given below. The operator has 
used these data to make a check on the mass balance. The solids concentrations in the calculations are kg/m3.
	
Solids In	 = QRSCRS + QC CC + QWASCWAS
	
	
= 1000(0.2) + 18(8) + 3(2.5) = 351.5 kg/d

Application – Desalting Water by Reverse Osmosis
A city needs water with a salt concentration of 500 mg/L for drinking and normal household use but it 
must take its water from a brackish source that has a salt concentration of 10,000 mg/L. Salt refers to all 
the dissolved minerals in the water. 
A flow of 10 L/s of brackish water will enter the desalting system (reverse osmosis, or RO). A portion 
will be treated to reduce the salt concentration to 100 mg/L and this will be blended with untreated 
water to produce a mixture having a salt concentration of 500 mg/L. An input of X L/s brackish water 
yields 0.75X L/s of water at 100 mg/L and 0.25X L/s of brine that is useless. Figure 4.12 shows the water 
treatment system and all known flows and concentrations.

Region 1 – Overall material balance  
Figure 4.13 Selection of region over which to make the material balance.
Material balance equations. The four possible material balance equations for salt are: 
Region 1:	
10(10000) = (10 – 0.25X)(500) + (0.25 X)C
Region 2:	
10(10000) = 10000 X + (10 – X)(10000)
Region 3:	
10000 X = (0.25 X) C + (0.75X) (100)
Region 4:	
(10 – X)(10000) + 0.75 X)(100) = (10–0.25X)(500)
There are M = 2 unknowns so N = 2 equations are needed to solve the problem. The material balance 
equation for Region 2 is an identity and provides no useful information. One of the other equations is 
redundant. For example, adding the material balances on regions 2, 3 and 4 gives the overall material 
balance equation for Region 1. 
In this example, the material balances on Region 1 and Region 3 involve both the unknowns, X and C. 
These two equations could be solved simultaneously. There is an easier way because the equation for 
Region 4 has only one unknown quantity, X, and can be solved directly.
(10 – X L/s)(10,000 mg/L) + (0.75X L/s)(100 mg/L) = (10 – 0.25X L/s)(500 mg/L)

(also 10.0 – 2.42 = 7.58 L/s) 
The material balance for salt on the RO module (region 3) is
Mass of salt in the brine = 96.9 – 0.727 = 96.2 g/s
Concentration of salt in the brine = C = (96.2 g/s)/(2.42 L/s) = 39,800 mg/L

Application – Drying Sludge with Warm Air
Wet sludge will be dried by contacting it with hot dry air. Part of the humid air leaving the dryer will 
be recycled through a heater and bone-dry air will be added as make-up for the humid air removed. 
The sludge is initially 30% water and 70% solids. It will be dried to 10% water. Calculate the amount 
of air brought into the drying system if the humid air stream is 5% water by weight (Rudd et al. 1973).

the solution.

Application – Boiler Blowdown
Feed water enters the boiler; steam and blowdown exit. The blowdown depends on steam consumption 
(steam not returned as condensate to the boiler), the concentration of impurities in the feed water, and 
the maximum allowable TDS in the boiler. 
The blowdown rate calculation is a material balance problem, as shown in Figure 4.17. The total dissolved 
solids (TDS) in the circulating boiler water must be maintained below a specified level by removing salts 
in the blowdown, which has a flow rate of QBD and a total dissolved solids concentration TDSBD. Feed 
water is added to the system to makeup the water lost as steam and blowdown.
Figure 4.17 Material diagram for boiler blowdown
The material balances on water and total dissolved solids are
The boiler blowdown rate is 
where	
QF = feed water rate (makeup) (kg/h)
QBD = blowdown rate (kg/h)
QS = steam consumption (kg/h)
TDSF = Total Dissolved Solids in the feed water (ppm)
TDSBD = Total Dissolved Solids in the boiler blowdown 
          = maximum allowable TDS in the boiler water (ppm)

The concentration of a specific ion can replace TDS in this formula. Chloride is commonly used. Or, 
conductivity can be used as a surrogate for total dissolved solids. 
Example 4.9 BOILER BLOWDOWN
A boiler system is to be controlled so the total dissolved solids in the blowdown does not exceed TDSBD = 2000 mg/L for 
a feed water (makeup) that has TDSF = 200 mg/L TDS. Steam consumption, QS, is 1000 kg/d. The blowdown is

The cycles of concentration is 
	
Cycles = 190/40 = 4.75

Application – Water Conservation in Rinsing Operations
Rinsing and cleaning operations can provide excellent opportunities to save water and, at the same time, 
concentrate wastewater streams so material recovery is more feasible. 
Parts leaving a plating bath must be rinsed clean before going to the next manufacturing step. The racks 
that carry the parts are coated with residual acid and metal solution that is called drag-out. The volume 
of drag out is a function of the shape of the parts, drain time, and plating bath viscosity. The used rinse 
water is contaminated so efficient rinsing is often part of a pollution prevention program.
An engineer doing a plant walk-through sees the single-stage rinsing scheme shown in Figure 4.18. The 
concentration carried on the parts and racks (Figure 4.18b) as drag-out is 100,000 mg/L. This needs 
to be reduced to 10 mg/L by rinsing. The 1 L/h drag-out has to be diluted 10,000 times (actually 9,999 
times). The input of clean water for rinsing is 10,000 L/h. The 10,000 L/h output of slightly contaminated 
rinse water has a concentration of 10 mg/L.

arrangements. One possibility is to add a drip tank so the parts rack could be drained before going

Another possibility is to dip the part racks into a dead-rinse tank before additional rinsing, as shown 
in Figure 4.19. The water in the dead-tank will be clean initially but would become contaminated over 
time. A rough calculation shows that a 100 L dead-tank would have a concentration of 20,000 mg/L 
after 24 hours of use. The lower dragout concentration coming from the dead-rinse allows the amount 
of rinse water to be reduced from 10,000 L/h to the amounts estimated in the graph of Q versus time. 
When the dead tank needs to be refreshed with clean water, its contents could be recycled to the plating 
tanks, to make up water lost from drag-out and evaporation. 
Figure 4.19 Dead Rinse tank preceding a single-stage rinse.
Other options include spray rinses over the plating tanks (the spray rate would have to be less than the 
evaporation rate so the tanks would not overflow) and air jets to blow off the drag-out. If the drag-out 
going to the rinses could be reduced from 1 L/h to 0.1 L/h, the rinse water flow would be reduced from 
10,000 L/h to 1,000 L/h. Certainly one of these ideas, or a combination, could be used to improve the 
rinse efficiency.
Another strategy is staged rinsing. A two-stage rinse will be more efficient than a single-stage rinse, and 
a countercurrent process will be more efficient than a crossflow process. Countercurrent processing is 
used in many situations, including this one.

Example 4.11 TWO-STAGE CROSSFLOW RINSE
Figure 4.20 shows a two-stage crossflow rinsing system. The drag-out and rinse water leaving rinse bath 2 must have 
concentration C2 = 10 mg/L. The concentration C1 is unknown. Equal flow to each stage will minimize the total water use.
Figure 4.20 Two-stage crossflow rinsing system
The material balance equations are:
	
Rinse bath 1:	
 (1 L/h)(100,000 mg/L) + 0 = (1 L/h) C1 + Q C1
	
Rinse bath 2:	
(1 L/h) C1 + 0 = (1 L/h) (10 mg/L) + Q (10 mg/L)
Solving these two equations gives
	
	
Q2 + 2 Q – 9,999 = 0
	
	
Q = 99 L/h
The total rinse flow needed for the two tanks is 2 Q = 198 L/h
In general, the concentrations for crossflow rinsing, with equal flow to each stage, are
For an n-stage crossflow rinse for equal flow to each stage is
Countercurrent rinsing is better than crossflow rinsing, as Example 4.12 shows.

Example 4.12 TWO-STAGE COUNTERCURRENT RINSE
In countercurrent rinsing, Figure 4.21, the dirtiest part is rinsed with once-used water, and cleanest part is rinsed with 
clean water. The drag-out and rinse water leaving rinse bath 2 have concentration C2 = 10 mg/L. 
Figure 4.21 Two-stage countercurrent rinsing system
The concentration C1 is unknown. 
The material balance equations are:
	
Rinse Bath 1:	
DCD + QC2 = DC1 + QC1
	
Rinse Bath 2:	
DC1 = DC2 + QC2
For D = 1 L/h, CD = 100,000 mg/L, and C1 = 10 mg/L
	
Rinse Bath 1:	
(1)(100,000) + Q (10) = (1) C1 + Q C1
	
Rinse Bath 2:	
(1) C1 = (1)(10) + Q (10)
Solving these two equations gives
	
	
	
Q 2 + Q – 9999 = 0
	
	
	
Q = 99.5 L/h
The equations for a 3-stage countercurrent rinse are
Stage 1:	
DCD + QC2 = DC1 +QC1
Stage 2:	
DC1 + QC3 = DC2 + QC2 
Stage 3:	
DC2 + 0 = DC3 + QC3
The approximate equations are
Stage 1:	
DCD + QC2 = QC1
Stage 2:	
DC1 + QC3 = QC2	
C1 = (Q/D)2C3 – (Q/D)C3 
Stage 3:	
DC2 = QC3	
	
C2 = QC3/D

Table 4.1 summarizes the results for D = 1 L/h and CD = 100,000 mg/L. The single-stage rinse will use the 
most water. The 2-stage crossflow rinse without recycle is better, but rinsing with countercurrent recycle 
is the most efficient system we can devise. Some results for 3-stage rinse systems are included in Table 4.1.

Adding more stages reduces the amount of rinse water and increases the concentration of the 
contaminated rinse water. Two and three-stage systems are widely used. The cost of space, tanks, and 
plumbing discourages using more tanks. 
Countercurrent processing is used in many different processes, including soil washing, carbon adsorption, 
and air stripping.

Application – Effluent Limits and Waste Load Allocation
Every municipality has pretreatment regulations and sewer ordinances that set limits on substances that 
might expose the sewer system to corrosion, clogging, explosion, and other risks. Pretreatment regulations 
prohibit industry from discharging any toxics or other substance (priority pollutants) that will:
•	 pass through the municipal treatment works and violate the discharge permit
•	 interfere with sludge disposal, or
•	 interfere with the treatment process.
Domestic and industrial wastewater, in the respective flows of 3,500 m3/d and 200 m3/d, are treated jointly 
in a municipal treatment plant and discharged to a river. The sludge removed from the treatment plant 
is 50 m3/d, leaving an effluent of 3,650 m3/d that is discharged to the river. The treatment plant removes 
80% of the influent lead and this leaves the plant in the sludge.
The concentration of lead in the domestic wastewater is 0.002 mg/L and the concentration in the river 
upstream from the discharge is 0.001 mg/L. The aquatic chronic toxicity limit of 2.5 µg/L (0.0025 mg/L) 
must be satisfied at the critical flow condition, which is when the treatment plant effluent is 3,650 m3/d and 
the stream flow is 3,000 m3/d. Toxicity and water quality limits are explained in Berthouex & Brown (2013).
Figure 4.22 shows the completed material balances on lead and flow, and the waste load allocation. 
Figure 4.22 Domestic and industrial wastewater are treated jointly in the publicly owned treatment 
works and discharged to a river. The wasteload allocation satisfies the requirements for river quality, 
sludge quality and treatment process protection, and it includes an allowance for future growth.
Mass flow of Pb measured in the river upstream of the mixing zone

Conservation of Mass
Mass of Pb allowed for a combined river and effluent flow of 6,650 m3/d at 0.0025 mg/L is
Pbdown = (6,650 m3/d)(0.0025 mg/L)(0.001) = 0.0166 kg/d
Mass of Pb allowed in the POTW effluent
Pbeff = (Pbdown – Pbup) = 0.0166 – 0.003 = 0.0163 kg/d
Mass of Pb allowed in the treatment plant influent, assuming 80% removal of the influent Pb,
Pbeff = (1 – 0.80)Pbinf
Pbinf = 0.0163/0.20 = 0.0815 kg/d
Mass Pb contributed in domestic wastewater
Pbdom= (3,500 m3/d)(0.002 mg/l)(0.001) = 0.007 kg/d
Mass Pb load from industrial wastewater
Pbind = Pbinf – Pbdom = 0.0815 – 0.007 = 0.0745 kg/d
The mass loadings can be converted to concentrations:
Treatment plant influent = (0.0815 kg/d)(1000)/(3,700 m3/d) = 0.022 mg/L
Industrial wastewater = (0.0745 kg/d)(1000)/(200 m3/d) = 0.372 mg/L Pb 
Treatment plant effluent = (0.0163 kg/d)(1000)/3,685 m3/d) = 0.0044 mg/L
The treatment plant can reserve 20–50% of the wasteload allocation for future growth. The industrial 
contribution would be reduced by the reserved amount, and the treatment plant influent and effluent 
concentrations will be reduced, as will the downstream concentration in the river. The reader may wish 
to make these calculations as an exercise.
The lead concentration used in these calculations was total lead, or total recoverable metal in the language 
of the laboratory test methods. Some fraction of the total lead is not available in a toxic form to the 
protected organisms. The free-ion form (non-complexed form) is generally thought to be the most 
bioavailable and toxic. This form is difficult to measure and for practical reasons it seldom is. Expressing 
effluent and ambient toxicity limits as total recoverable metal provides for the maximum toxic potential 
should all the metal somehow revert to its most toxic form when mixed with the receiving water.

There can be a discrepancy between the toxic effects observed in laboratory tests and in a specific river. 
These differences are attributed to difference in the physical and chemical forms of the metals in the two 
environments. The water-effects ratio (WER) procedure is an accepted procedure to make site-specific 
adjustments for the reduced metals bioavailability (Berthouex & Brown 2013). The WER is the ratio of 
the toxic endpoint in river water at the discharge point to the toxic endpoint in laboratory water. This 
is a direct measure of the amount by which the permit limit could be raised without increasing risk to 
aquatic organisms.

Material Balance for Partitioning Between Air, Water, and Soil
A chemical that enters the environment may become associated with the soil, water, air, or biota as shown 
in Figure 4.23. Predicting where the chemical goes is a special kind of material balance that estimates 
how much of the chemical will be found in each environmental compartment. 
We will consider the special situation where the chemical concentrations in the water, soil, biota, and 
air are in equilibrium with each other. Equilibrium means that the concentrations are not changing over 
time. It may seem unrealistic to think of equilibrium in a lake or pond, where conditions are changing 
constantly, but there is a lot of averaging and blending happening and it can be a reasonable approximation. 
Also, for practical purposes, we can assume that equilibrium between air and water is reached quickly 
(seconds or minutes), and equilibrium between water and solids is reached within hours or a few days. 
Reaching equilibrium between water and biota takes longer.

Figure 4.23 The scheme for modeling the fate of a chemical in an environmental compartment
The equilibrium concentrations in two compartments, such as soil and water, are related by simple 
proportionality factors. The proportionality factors, which are called partition coefficients, indicate how 
a chemical will be partitioned (i.e. distributed) between the two compartments. 
The most familiar of these proportional relations is Henry’s Law, which defines the relation between 
concentrations in water and air at equilibrium. At a given temperature, 
Ca = HCw
where	
H = Henry’s Law Constant
Ca = air phase concentration 
Cw = water phase concentration. 
H is the partition coefficient for the gas-water system. In environmental work, the gas of interest is often 
air, but Henry’s law also applies to other gases. A large value of H indicates that the chemical will tend 
to move easily from water to air. 
The units of H depend on the units used to define the concentrations. H is dimensionless if both phases 
are defined in the same units of mass per unit volume, for example mg/L, µg/L, or mg/m3. If Ca is defined 
with units of partial pressure in atmospheres and Cw is measured in mg/L, the units of H are atm-L/mg. 
Many combinations of units have been used and one must check carefully to avoid mistakes. We will 
use the dimensionless form.
Similar partition coefficients can be defined for other two-phase equilibrium systems. For a soil-water 
system
Cs = KdCw

Pollution Prevention and Control: Part II 
Material and Energy Balances
86 
Conservation of Mass
where	
Cs = concentration in the soil phase 
Cw = concentration in water. 
Kd increases as the organic content of the soil increases because an organic chemical tends to associate 
more strongly with other organic matter than with inorganic matter like silica and calcium carbonate. 
This simple form is valid when the pollutant concentration is low. At high concentrations the surface of 
the solid becomes saturated with chemical and the linear proportion is not valid.
The partition coefficient between water and biota, Kb, is called the bioconcentration factor 
Cb = KbCw
where Cb (mg/kg) is the concentration of chemical in the biota (e.g. fish). 
The time needed for a fish to come into equilibrium with a chemical in water depends on the relative 
rate at which the fish takes up the chemical and the rate at which it can cleanse itself of the chemical 
by excretion, metabolism, or other means. The collective effect of all the active cleansing mechanisms is 
called depuration. Equilibrium exists when the rates of uptake and depuration are equal. 
A fish may continue to take up chemical as it grows and, as a result, strict equilibrium may not be 
reached. This is why advisories on eating fish with contaminated flesh are based on the size of the fish. 
Larger fish tend to have higher contaminant concentrations. The practical solution to this complication 
is to assume that the bioconcentration factor represents an average over fish of all species and all sizes.

Example 4.13 ESTIMATING THE BIOCONCENTRATION FACTOR
The bioconcentration factor is the equilibrium ratio of the chemical concentration in the fish flesh to the concentration in 
the water. The data in Figure 4.24 were obtained by keeping fish in water having a constant level of 10 µg/L of Chemical 
A for 40 days and then putting the fish into clean water. Fish were sacrificed every few days to measure the chemical 
content of their flesh. 
After 40 days, the concentration in the fish is still changing, but only a little, so the bioassay system is essentially at 
equilibrium. The equilibrium fish flesh concentration is Cb = 4000 µg/kg. The water concentration was maintained at a 
constant Cw = 10 µg/L. 
The bioconcentration factor is 
	
Kb = Cb /Cw = 4000/10 = 400 (µg/kg)/(µg/L)

To summarize, partitioning between air, water, soil, and biota is defined by:
Air-Water:	
Ca = Cw H (Henry’s Law)
Soil-Water:	
Cs = Cw Kd
Biota-water:	
Cb = Cw Kb
where	
Ca = concentration in air (mass/volume)
Cw = concentration in water (mass/volume)
Cs = concentration in solid (mass/mass)
Cb = concentration in biota (mass/mass)
H = Henry’s Law Constant (dimensionless)
Kd = Soil-water partition coefficient (volume/mass). 
Kb = Bioconcentration factor (volume/mass)
Another important proportionality factor is the octanol-water partition coefficient, Kow. This coefficient is 
measured by introducing the chemical into a mixture of water and octanol, an organic solvent, shaking 
the mixture until equilibrium is attained, and then measuring the concentration of chemical in the solvent 
and in the water. Chemists have measured Kow for many compounds and have determined a relationship 
between Kow and the soil-water partition coefficient Kd, and between Kow and the bioconcentration 
factor, Kb.

lake is negligible. Estimate the mass of chemical in the water, soil, and biota. Also estimate the mass of 
chemical lost from the system.
The partition coefficients are

Rounding these results to a useful approximation, the fate of the 400 kg of chemical spilled is: 
47% of the total spilled has disappeared from the water
25% is in the water
27% is in the soil and sediment
Less than 1% is in the biota. 
The mechanisms that might cause the chemical to disappear are microbial degradation, volatilization 
to the air, and hydrolysis.

Conclusion
All the examples in this chapter are for steady state processes. Steady state is an ideal, but it is a useful 
and workable ideal during design. 
The material balance is the most valuable tool for analyzing pollution problems. We use it to expand 
fragmentary information into a more complete picture that suggests creative solutions for controlling 
pollutant emissions. It facilitates discovery of opportunities to minimize the creation of wastes and to 
recover and recycle material. Recognizing that zero emissions is almost never possible, the material 
balance also guides the designer in formulating treatment systems to deal with pollutant discharges that 
cannot be avoided.
Real processes are never stationary. Conditions change rapidly when a process is being started or shut 
down. Conditions drift and change slowly during normal operation. Ambient conditions and raw 
materials change, mechanical parts wear out, and so on. This is why there are sometimes problems with 
output quality and process stability. Maintaining tight control of a real operating system may require 
dealing with these dynamic and drifting conditions. 
Inputs to most pollution control systems can be highly variable. The flow into a municipal wastewater 
treatment plant may change by a factor of three or four in a 24-hour period. The average flow on the 
peak day may be triple the average flow. Concentrations and mass loadings will change in similar ratios. 
A treatment plant typically is designed for a 20-year service life, and the flows and loads will grow from 
the beginning to the end of the design period.

Conservation of Mass
The designer deals with this by assuming and analyzing steady-state conditions at the estimated ‘average 
day design flow’ and ‘peak design flow’ at the end of the design period. Cold winter weather will slow 
down a biological process, and warm summer weather will decrease the efficiency of supplying oxygen 
to aerobic treatment processes, so these critical conditions are checked. 
In other words, the designer imagines that the system must function for an extended period of time, at 
a stable, steady state, under the most critical high and low flow loads and environmental conditions. A 
design that can survive these extremes is expected to also survive all the daily and seasonal dynamics.

Solving Systems of Equations
5	 Solving Systems of Equations
5.1	
The Design Problem
A processing system consists of easily identifiable components or modules, such as mixers, reactors, 
settling tanks, filters, heat exchangers, and so on. These component parts are arranged to interact with each 
other to perform some larger function. A single component may be fully constrained by its connections 
to other parts of the system, but the organized components will offer the designer some flexibility to 
select the best flow rates, operating temperatures, pH, detention times, and other details.
The designer will use a collection of design equations, including material and energy balances, along with 
additional information in the form of performance tables and graphs, and cost estimating manuals. When 
this information is organized and reduced to something definite and manageable there will be certain 
variables that the designer is free to adjust to search for the design that best meets the processing need. 
To make use of this flexibility and freedom it helps to understand and organize the information flow 
structure of the design equations because this can lead to significant simplifications in the calculations.
5.2	
Design Degrees of Freedom
There will be, in general, N sources of information about the system, including references to M variables 
(equipment size, flow rates, etc.). The design relations must be independent sources of information, and 
any relation that can be derived from the others should be eliminated in the tally of equations.
In general, the number of degrees of freedom is the difference between the number of pertinent variables 
(M) and the number of independent design relations (N).
F = M – N
This means that F of the system variables may be selected as design variables, the values of which are free 
to be adjusted. The remaining variables are called state variables. Once the designer has assigned values 
to the design variables, the state variables are obtained by solving the set of design relations.
The number of degrees of freedom will not be obvious in a large problem. Murphy (2007) is an excellent 
resource, with several examples, for those who wish to learn more about this. Other good references are 
Himmelblau & Riggs (2004) and Rudd & Watson (1968).

Solving Systems of Equations
The most interesting case is when N ≤ M so the design can be manipulated in order to find the best 
conditions. The number of variables the designer controls, F = (M – N) > 0, is the design degrees of 
freedom. The designer assigns values for these variables, called design variables, in order to create a 
solvable system of N equations and N unknowns. Different values can be assigned to create new designs. 
In this way the design improves iteration by iteration. Chapter 14 (section 14.6) gives an example with 
one degree of freedom.
A second case is when the number of equations equals the number of unknowns. That is, N = M and 
F = M – N = 0. There are no degrees of freedom. The designer has no flexibility to optimize the design 
because there is only one solution. 
A third possibility is poorly formulated problem that has N > M, in which case it is generally not possible 
to find values for all of the M variables that satisfy the design relations.

Solving Systems of Equations
Example 5.1 BLENDING PROBLEM – CONTRADICTORY PROBLEM FORMULATION
Figure 5.1 shows a blender designed to mix materials A and B to produce 2,000 kg of material C. The buyer specifies 
that R = B/A = 4.There are N = 5 design relations and M = 4 variables. It not possible to solve for B because N > M is an 
impossible contradiction.
Material Balance:	
A + B = C 
Quality of the blend:	
R = B/A
Specifications:	
	
A = 1,000 kg
	
	
	
C = 2,000 kg
	
	
	
R = 4
Example 5.2 BLENDING PROBLEM – FULLY CONSTRAINED FORMULATION
Relaxing the specification on the amount of C produced by the blender gives these design equations
	
Material Balance:	 	
A + B = C
	
Quality of the blend:	
R = B/A
	
Specifications:	
	
A = 1,000 kg
	
	
	
	
R = 4
There are N = 4 design relations and M = 4 variables (A, B, C and R). 
The solution is
	
B = RA = 4(1,000) = 4,000 kg
	
C = A + B = 1,000 + 4,000 = 5,000 kg
Example 5.3 BLENDING PROBLEM – FLEXIBLE DESIGN
The specification on the amount of C and the value of K can be relaxed to give one degree of freedom.
	
Material Balance:	 A + B = C
	
Quality of blend:	
R = B/A
	
Specifications:	
A = 1,000 kg
Then N = 3, M = 4, and F = 4 – 3 = 1 degree of freedom to explore different designs. 
A value can be assigned for B to calculate K, or vice versa. Blends with different values of K will have different properties 
and hence different market values. The designer’s freedom might be used to explore a goal such as “Maximize the cost 
of the blend, C, minus the cost of the raw materials, A and B.” 
5.3	
Design Variable Selection
Given a design problem with F = M – N degrees of freedom, the designer must select F variables  to 
consume those degrees of freedom and create a solvable problem with N design relations that will be 
used to calculate the N state variables.

Solving Systems of Equations
Three rules-of-thumb are: 
1)	 When a variable involves a choice among discrete alternatives it is usually best to make the 
discrete variable a design variable. This is shown in Example 5.4.
2)	 The design variables should, when possible, be those variables that are most constrained.
3)	 If the design equations include exponential, logarithmic, or trigonometric functions, the 
solution will be easier if the variable in the argument (e.g. the t in x = exp(-t) or  
θ in x = 2 + cosθ) can be made a design variable. 
For this equation
either A or t could be the design variable. The better choice is t because this allows a direct solution for 
A. Specifying A would require a more difficult calculation. This is an example of how the design variable 
selection can influence the work required to solve the equations.
Design variable selection can be important even for a set of simple equations. Example 5.5 shows how 
the selection can simplify the calculations by avoiding simultaneous equations.

Solving Systems of Equations
Example 5.4 MAXIMIZING PRODUCT RECOVERY
Coagulant A or B is to be mixed with the feed to facilitate concentration of the product, P, and minimize the reject, 
R. The relation between the kind of coagulant, K, the coagulant dose, W, and the reject/product ratio (R/P) is known 
from experiments and is expressed as a graph. K is a discrete variable; K = kind A or K = kind B. The mixer-settler and 
the performance graph are Figure 5.2. The goal us to maximize the profit by selecting the best coagulant (A or B) and	
 coagulant dosage.	
	
Figure 5.2 Mixer-settler process with coagulant addition
The N = 3 design relations are:	
F = 1000 kg
	
	
	
	
F = R + P
	
	
	
	
R/P = f (W, K)
The M = 5 variables are F, R, P, W and coagulant type (K = A or K = B)
Degrees of freedom:	
	
F = 5 – 3 = 2
The feasible choices of the 2 design variables are:
	
1)	
W and K	 	
Determine R/P → R and P 
	
2)	
P and W	 	
Determine R and K (coagulant type)
	
3)	
R and W	 	
Determine P and K (coagulant type)
Choice 1 is an easy calculation. Choices 2 and 3 are several times more difficult.

Example 5.5 DESIGN VARIABLE SELECTION TO SIMPLIFY CALCULATIONS
Figure 5.3 shows a simple system with M = 7 variables, N = 3 material balance equations, and F = 7 – 3 = 4 degrees of 
freedom. Assume that X1 and X5 are specified by external conditions, say X1 = 100 and X5 = 2. This reduces the degrees 
of freedom from 4 to 2. It does matter which two variables are selected as design variables.
Figure 5.3 Hypothetical system with M = 7, N = 3 and F = 7 – 3 = 4.
Figure 5.4 shows two possible selections of design variables. The given input values are X1 = 100 and X5 = 2 in both cases.
In Option (a), X2 and X4 are the design variables; they will be specified by the designer. This selection allows the three 
equations to be solved one after another, with each equation yielding a value for one more variable. The sequence of 
solution is known as the precedence order.
Option (b) selects X3 and X7 as design variables. This selection has no precedence order and solving simultaneous 
equations is necessary. 
Figure 5.4 Two possible selections of design variables for the system in Figure 5.3. The design variable selection 
in Option (a) allows the equations to be solved sequentially. The selection in Option (b) makes this impossible.

Information Flow and Precedence Order
Figure 5.5 shows a simple system in which 70% of the feed is captured in process 1 and directed into 
process 2, where 95% of the feed is captured as product and 5% is lost as waste. There are 5 equations 
and 5 variables. A sixth equation, the overall material balance, could be written but it is redundant.

Solving Systems of Equations
This system has N = 5 equations with M = 5 variables. Specifying the basis, X1 = 1000, consumes one 
degree of freedom, leaving N = M = 4 and X2, X3, X4 and X5 as unknowns. There is a unique solution 
and the equations can be solved sequentially, for example, in this order
Eq. 4	 X3 = 0.7 X1	
	
X3 = 0.7(1000) = 700
Eq. 5	 X5 = 0.95 X3	
	
X5 = 0.95(700) = 665
Eq. 3	 X4 = X3 – X5	
	
X4 = 700 – 665 = 35
Eq. 2	 X2 = X1 – X3	
	
X2 = 1000 – 700 = 300
If the equations can be solved sequentially without dealing with simultaneous equations, the sequence 
in which the equations are to be solved is called the precedence order. This precedence order (solving 
equation 4, 5 3 and 2, in that order) is not unique for these equations. The important characteristic is 
that there is a sequence that allows the needed information to flow from one equation to the next so 
they can be solved one by one. 
Figure 5.6 The information flow diagram and precedence order for the system shown in Figure 5.5.
Figure 5.6 shows the flow of information from one equation to another. The arrows with solid lines 
represent a calculated value (an X). Arrows with dotted lines represent the known value of a variable 
entering an equation. 
The fixed value, X1 = 1000, is used first in Equation 4 and later in Eq. 2. Equation 4 yields a value for 
X3, which is used in Eq. 5 to calculate X5 and in Eq. 2 to calculate X2. Eq. 3 can then be solved using the 
calculated values of X5 and X3.

Iterative Solutions of Systems with Information Recycle
Information recycle in a system of equations means two variables are linked and cannot be separated 
from each other. This can occur in models for processes that do not have physical recycle of material.
Here is an example of two nonlinear equations that both contain x1 and x2.

Solving Systems of Equations
Sequential computation is not possible. There is no practical solution except iteration. Figure 5.7 shows 
four possible iterative schemes. The tear variable – the variable you choose to specify (i.e. to guess) in 
order to start the calculations – can be either x1 or x2 and for each choice there are two directions for 
the information to flow. The four schemes are not equal in terms of computational work.
If x1 is the tear variable, it is much easier to calculate x2 using the information flow shown in Figure 5.8(b). 
That is, x2 is calculated directly if x1 is entered into 
but this is not true when using
.
If, on the other hand, x2 is selected as the tear variable, the most direct information flow is from x1 to 
x2, as used in iterative solution in Table 5.1. Both functions give values of x1 and x2 between 0 and 10. 
Assume a mid-range initial value, say x2 = 5	
Iteration 1
x2 = 5
x1 = 10 exp[-0.1(5)] = 5.488 
→
 x2 = 10 [1 – exp[-0.2)(5.488)] = 6.663
Iteration 2
x2 = 6.633
x1 = 10 exp[-0.1(6.633)] = 5.136 
→
 x2 = 10 [1 – exp[-0.2)(5.136)] = 6.420
Iteration 3
x2 = 6.420
x1 = 10 exp[-0.1(6.420)] = 5.262 
→
 x2 = 10 [1 – exp[-0.2)(5.262)] = 6.509
Iteration 4
x2 = 6.509
x1 = 10 exp[-0.1(6.509)] = 5.216
→
 x2 = 10 [1 – exp[-0.2)(5.216)] = 6.476
Iteration 5
x2 = 6.476
x1 = 10 exp[-0.1(6.476)] = 5.233 
→
 x2 = 10 [1 – exp[-0.2)(5.233)] = 6.488
Iteration 6
x2 = 6.484
x1 = 10 exp[-0.1(6.484)] = 5.226 
→
 x2 = 10 [1 – exp[-0.2)(5.226)] = 6.484

Systems with Physical Recycle of Material
There are systems of equations where information flows between equations in recycle loops that cannot 
be unraveled regardless of the design variable selection. The solution then requires solving simultaneous 
equations or doing an iterative solution. Solving simultaneous equations is feasible for a simple problem, 
but it is not when the equations are quadratic, cubic, or when the equations contain exponential, 
logarithmic, or trigonometric functions. In that case an iterative solution will be used. Many software 
design packages use this method without the user being aware of what is happening.

Solving Systems of Equations
Example 5.6 MATERIAL BALANCE FOR TWO PROCESSES WITH RECYCLE
The process in Figure 5.9 shows the mass flow of material through two processes with recycle. The material balance 
equations are
Figure 5.9 Mass flow through two processes with recycle.
There are two material balance equations and three mass specifications
Material balance
	
1)	
X1 + X4 – X2 – X3 = 0
	
2)	
X3 – X4 – X5 = 0
Mass specifications
	
3)	
X3 = 0.7(X1 + X4) = 0.7(1000 + X4) = 700 + 0.7 X4
	
4)	
X5 = 0.95 X3 = 0.95(700 + 0.7 X4) = 665 + 0.665 X4
	
5)	
X1 = 1000
The simultaneous solution of equations 2, 3 and 4 gives:
	
	
(700 + 0.7 X4) – X4 – (665 + 0.665 X4) = 0
	
	
0.965 X4 = 35
	
	
X4 = 36.27
From Eq. 5	
X5 = 665 + 0.665(36.27) = 689.1
From Eq. 2	
X3 = X4 + X5 = 36.27 + 689.1 = 725.4
From Eq. 1	
X2 = 1000 + 36.27 – 725.4 = 310.9 
Start by assuming a value for one variable. In this example X2, X3, X4 or X5 could be assumed, but the ease of calculation 
usually depends on which variable is selected. Often you know more about one variable than the others and this 
knowledge will help estimate a workable starting value. If a variable must be within a certain range, that variable is a 
good one to assume.
There are several possible iterative solutions. One is to tear variable X4 as shown in Figure 5.10(a), and another is to tear 
X2 as shown in Figure 5.10(b).

Solving Systems of Equations
The iterative solution will be illustrated using X3 as the tear variable, starting with an assumed value of X3 = 700. This 
amounts to neglecting the recycle to get started. (It is equivalent to assuming X4 = 0.)
Eq. 4	
	
	
X5 = 0.95 X3 = 0.95(700) = 665
Eq. 2	
	
	
X4 = X3 – X5 = 700 – 665 = 35
Eq. 1	
	
	
X2 = X1 + X4 – X3 = 1000 + 35 -700 = 335
Eq. 3 – Solve for X3.	 	
X3 = 0.7(X1 + X4) = 0.7(1000 + 35) = 724.5
	
	
	
Assumed and calculated values do not agree.
2nd Iteration – Assume X3 = 724.5
Eq. 4	
	
	
X5 = 0.95 X3 = 0.95(724.5) = 688.3
Eq. 2	
	
	
X4 = X3 – X5 = 724.5 – 688.3 = 36.2
Eq. 1	
	
	
X2 = X1 + X4 – X3 = 1000 + 36.2 – 724.5 = 311.7
Eq. 3 – Solve for X3.	 	
X3 = 0.7(X1 + X4) = 0.7(1000 + 36.2) = 725.3
	
	
	
Assumed and calculated values agree.

Example 5.7 SUPERNATANT RECYCLE FROM A SLUDGE THICKENER RECYCLE
Figure 5.11 shows a portion of a wastewater treatment plant that has the same structure as the hypothetical system in 
Figure 5.10.
Figure 5.11 Primary settling tank sludge is concentrated in a gravity thickener.  
Supernatant from the thickener is recycled to the primary settling tank.
The settling tank influent is 100,000 m3/d (26.4 mgd) with a total suspended solids concentration of 0.25 kg/m3 
(250 mg/L). This is a total suspended solids load of (100,000 m3/d)(0.25 kg/m3) = 25,000 kg/d. The settling tank removes 
60% of the influent solids and delivers sludge at a concentration of 2% and specific gravity = 1.02 to a gravity sludge 
thickener. The sludge thickener concentrates this sludge to 6.5% at specific gravity = 1.03. The thickener captures 95% 
of the influent solids as thickened sludge and returns 5% of the solids to the settling tank as supernatant. 
When the solids qualities are known the volume flow rates can be calculated.
Material balance on solids
	
Settling tank:	
	
(1) X1 + X4 = X2 + X3
	
Sludge thickener	 	
(2) X3 = X4 + X5
Mass specifications:		
	
(3) X3 = 0.6(X1 + X4)
	
	
	
	
(4) X5 = 0.95 X3
	
	
	
	
(5) X1 = 25,000
There are F = 0 degrees of freedom. The iterative solution that corresponds to Figure 5.18 is to assume a value for X3. If 
the supernatant adds no solids to the settling tank load, X3 = 0.6(25,000) = 15,000. This could be used as a starting value, 
but we know the quantity will be more than 15,000 so we will try X3 = 15,500.
First Iteration – Assume X3	
	
X3 = 15,500
	
	
Eq. 4	
	
X5 = 0.95 X3 = 0.95(15,500) = 14,725
	
	
Eq. 2	
	
X4 = X3 – X5 = 15,000 – 14,725 = 275
	
	
	
	
X2 = X1 + X4 – X3 = 25,000 + 275 – 15,500 = 9775
Calculate new value for X3:	 	
X3 = 0.6(X1 + X4) = 0.6(25,000 + 275) = 15,165
Second Iteration – Assume X3		
X3 = 15,165
	
	
	
	
X5 = 0.95(15,165) = 14,407
	
	
	
	
X4 = 15,165 – 14,407 = 758
	
	
	
	
X2 = 25,000 + 758 – 15,165 = 10,593
Calculate new value for X3:	
	
X3 = 0.6(25,000 + 758) = 15,445

Solving Systems of Equations
Third Iteration – Assume X3	 	
X3 = 15,455
	
	
	
	
X5 = 0.95(15,455) = 14,682
	
	
	
	
X4 = 15,455 – 14,682 = 773
	
	
	
	
X2 = 25,000 + 773 – 15,455 = 10,318
Calculate new value for X3	
	
X3 = 0.6(25,000 + 773) = 15,464
A fourth iteration will close the material balance:
	
X2 = 10,309 kg/d	
X3 = 15,464 kg/d	
X4 = 773 kg/d	
X5 = 14,691 kg/d	
	
The wastewater and sludge flows are calculated next.
	
Q3 (1,020 kg/m3)(0.02) = 15,464	
→	
Q3 = 758 m3/d
	
Q5 (1,030 kg/m3)(0.065) = 14,691	
→	
Q5 = 219 m3/d
	
Q4 = Q3 – Q 5 = 758 – 219 = 539 m3/d
	
Q2 = Q1 + Q4 – Q3 = 100,000 + 539 – 758 = 99,781 m3/d
Figure 5.12 shows the completed material balance.

Using the Structural Array to Organize Calculations
In a simple system the selection of the design variables and the ordering of the equations for solution can 
be done by inspection. A system of 10 equations and 10 state variables can be ordered in thousands of ways. 
Some of these ways will be numerically intractable and some will be relatively easy. Fortunately, design 
variable selection algorithms have been developed (Himmelblau & Bischoff 1968, Lee et al 1966, Lee & 
Rudd 1966, Christensen & Rudd 1968) and these are used in many process design software programs.
A precedence order is an order that allows the equations to be solved sequentially, without simultaneous 
equations. The existence of a precedence order depends on the structure of the equations and on which 
variables are assigned numerical values to start the calculations. The design variable selection algorithm 
reveals a precedence order when one exists. The algorithm will also discover when a precedence order 
does not exist. 
These ideas were introduced in sections 5.3 and 5.4. This section gives a more systematic way to look 
at the problem.

Solving Systems of Equations
The structure of a system of equations refers to how the variables participate in the design relations. This 
can be shown in the structural array, which contains the same information as the diagram in Figure 5.6. 
The structural array is more convenient as the number of variables and equations increases. 
Figure 5.13 is the structural array for the five equations from Figure 5.5. In this simple system, 70% of 
the feed captured in process 1 is directed into process 2, where 95% of the feed is captured as product 
and 5% is lost was waste. There N = 5 equations with M = 5 variables.
1)	 X1 = 1000 	
(Basis)
2)	 X1 - X2 – X3 = 0
3)	 X3 - X4 – X5 = 0
4)	 X3 = 0.7 X1
5)	 X5 = 0.95 X3
There N = 5 equations with M = 5 variables. Specifying the basis, X1 = 1000, consumed one degree of 
freedom, leaving N = M = 4 and X2, X3, X4 and X5 as unknowns. N = M means there is a unique solution. 
We want the calculations to be as easy as possible, and that means using a precedence order, if one exists.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Solving Systems of Equations
The structural array, Figure 5.13, has a row for each equation and a column for each variable. Dots in 
the columns show how the variables participate in the equations. For example, equation 2 uses variables 
X1, X2 and X3. Shading will be added to indicate which variables are known (shaded) and unknown 
(unshaded). The four panels in the diagram show the progress in the structural analysis.
The basis, X1 = 1000, is given so the column for X1 in Figure 5.13b is shaded to indicate that the value 
is known. 
A row (equation) that has one unshaded dot (unknown variable) can be solved using the information 
at hand, namely X1 = 1000. Such a row is equation 4.
X3 = 0.7 X1
X3 = 0.7(1000) = 700
Shade the row for equation 4 and the column for X3 to indicate Eq. 4 has been used and X3 is known. 
This is Figure 5.13c.
Rows (equations) 2 and 5 now contain a single dot (variable). The next calculation can be X2 from 
equation 2 and X5 from equation 5. The final calculation is X4 from equation 3.

Very often the precedence order is not unique. The important result is finding a sequence of the needed 
information flow from one equation to the next, so they can be solved one by one. In this case, two 
sequences have been discovered.

X4 = 700 – 665 = 35
	
Eq. 2	
X2 = X1 – X3	
	
X2 = 1000 – 700 = 300
The algorithm we used to analyze the structural array can be run in reverse to select design variables 
that create a precedence order, when one exists. Figure 5.14 is used to illustrate the procedure.
Figure 5.14 shows a simple system with M = 7 variables, N = 3 material balance equations, and F = 7 – 3 = 4 
degrees of freedom. Assume that X1 and X5 are specified by external conditions, say X1 = 100 and X5 = 2. This 
reduces the degrees of freedom from 4 to 2. It does matter which two variables are selected as design variables.
We start with X1 and X5 shaded out because they cannot be design variables. The purpose of the new 
column will become apparent as we run through the design variable selection algorithm.

Solving Systems of Equations
One dot in a column identifies a variable that participates in only one equation. That variable should 
not be a design variable; it should be calculated later. Shade it out to protect it, along with the equation 
that will be used to calculate it. We can shade out X3 and X7. Arbitrarily we select X3 and equation 1 to 
shade out first, and X7 with equation 2 second. (The reverse is equally good.) Keep track of the deletions 
in the column labeled ‘Order of deletion’.
Any two of the unshaded variables, that is X2, X4 or X6 can be the design variables. Select one and delete 
equation 3.
The order of solving the equation is the reverse of the order in which they were deleted. Solve Eq. 3, 
then Eq. 2, and then Eq 1. (Or, you could do Eq. 3, Eq. 1 and Eq. 2.)
It may happen, at some point in the algorithm, that all columns have two or more dots. This indicates 
information recycle that cannot be untangled simply by making an intelligent selection of design variables. 
There is no precedence order. Figure 5.15 is an example. X1 and X5 are known from external conditions. 
X3 is identified as a variable that should be calculated last, using equation 1. The algorithm can take us 
no further toward a precedence order. All remaining variables participate in two equations. Any two of 
X2, X4, X6 or X7 can be used as design variables. There may be some feature of the equations that makes 
one selection more attractive than another, but whatever the choice the solution will involve iteration 
or simultaneous equations.

Computer-Aided Design
The concepts in this book are illustrated with examples that can be analyzed using simple algebra. Paper 
and pencil solutions with hand-drawn diagrams are often the best way to clarify concepts and stimulate 
new process arrangements. But, it is true that many problems benefit from more powerful methods, 
especially processes that can be arranged in many combinations and large systems with many pollutants 
and material recycle.
These are some of the available software systems.
CapdetWorks – Accurate and rapid preliminary design and cost estimating for wastewater treatment plant 
construction projects Extensive research went into checking and obtaining updated costs for all of the 
equipment and unit costs that are required when designing wastewater treatment plants. Costs were obtained 
from suppliers and manufacturers throughout North America (Hydromantis 2014, www.hydromantis.com).
Toxchem – Drag-and-drop creation of virtually any treatment plant configuration of unit processes with 
state-of-the-art models to simulate different volatilization, adsorption and biodegradation mechanisms. 
Toxchem includes a comprehensive contaminants database for compounds that are regulated by the 
U.S.EPA (Hydromantis 2014, www.hydromantis.com).
GPS-X – A modular, multi-purpose computer program for the modeling and simulation of municipal 
and industrial wastewater treatment plants. Whether you are designing a new facility, or simulating an 
existing plant, GPS-X will help you improve your design and operating efficiency. The software can be 
used, for example, to investigate the impact of increased organic and hydraulic loading on an existing 
plant, verify plant capacity under different loading conditions, temperatures and or operating strategies, 
compare alternatives for retrofitting an existing process and assess different diffused aeration design (e.g., 
diffuser design, taper and DO control), and investigate cost savings for proposed changes in process 
operation (Hydromantis 2014, www.hydromantis.com).

Conclusion
Two interesting problems are (1) those that require an iterative solution, which includes many processes 
that use recycle, and (2) optimization problems, in which the designer can evaluate different solutions 
by manipulating one or more design variables.
An evaluation of the degrees of freedom of a problem and an understanding of the information flow 
from equation to equation is always helpful. Simple problems do not need this kind of attention, but 
many real designs involve dozens of equations and many variables. This chapter has introduced some 
of the tools that will be useful.

Chemical Reactions
6.1	
The Design Problem
The interesting design problems go beyond mixing, splitting, or separating streams of non-reactive 
materials. More often chemical and biological transformations are used to make materials easy to separate 
from a bulk flow, or to make them safe for discharge. Chemical reagents are added or active biological 
agents (e.g. bacteria) are cultivated to initiate or accelerate the transformation. 
The material balance must account for whatever is added and whatever is created or destroyed by 
chemical or biochemical reactions. 
The rate at which the chemistry occurs is relevant for reactor design, which is selecting the reactor shape, 
mixing, operating conditions (pH, temperature, oxygen levels, etc.) and calculating the reactor volume 
and detention time. In this book we are concerned only with the extent of conversion or transformation, 
not with the speed of the reaction or physical details about the reactor. If a waste gas containing benzene 
is burned in a catalytic converter, the conversion of benzene to carbon dioxide happens in one second. 
The same oxidation may take an hour or more if it happens in a biological waste treatment process. 
To make the material balance we need to know, for example, that 99% of benzene that enters a reactor 
(whatever its internal details) is converted to carbon dioxide.

The reference to species i indicates the need to keep track of the kinds and amounts of molecules and 
substances that are moved around and transformed. Atoms, of course, are not destroyed; they are just 
rearranged as molecules are broken apart and elements are recombined into new species. The material 
balance keeps track of what happens.

Material Balance with Chemical Reactions
If common salt (NaCl) is added to water as it enters a reactor, the salt will dissolve into sodium ions 
(Na+) and chloride ions (Cl-). This is a simple change in physical form and not a chemical reaction, 
but the material balance must keep track of chloride. The mass of chloride going in equals the amount 
of coming out. The same must be for sodium. But it is not true for NaCl, the undissolved chemical 
compound, which may not exist in the effluent.
In a similar way, calcium chloride (CaCl2) will dissolve in water to give one calcium (Ca2+) and two 
chloride ions (Cl–). The chloride will exist as dissolved ions. If the water contains carbonate (CO3
2–) or 
sulfate (SO4
2–), some fraction of the calcium may form CaSO4 or CaCO3, which are solids. The material 
balance must account for calcium in all the species where it may be found. The mass of calcium is 
conserved and the moles of calcium is conserved. The mass of CaCl2 is not. 
The chemical reactants and products, and the masses of materials converted and produced, are described 
by a stoichiometric equation. When there is one or more reaction, add these steps to the guidelines in 
section 4.3 for organizing the material balance equations.
1.	 Write a separate stoichiometric equation for each reaction. 
2.	 Do not include more than one reaction in an equation. 
3.	 Calculate the mass of each reactant and product on the basis of the chemical reaction.

A brief explanation of this will be given. Readers who understand how to read a chemical reaction 
equation may wish to skip this section.
6.3	
Reaction Stoichiometry
Stoichiometry is the science of deciphering chemical ‘sentences’ that give the end points of a chemical 
reaction. The sentence contains both qualitative and quantitative information.
This is the stoichiometric equation for the reaction of heptane (C7H16) with oxygen (O2) to produce carbon 
dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O). By convention reactants are on the left and products are on the right.
1 C7H16  +  11 O2  →  7 CO2  +  8 H2O
	
heptane 	
oxygen 	
carbon dioxide 	 water
The reaction equation gives the definite molecular proportions of the reaction. The stoichiometric 
coefficients (1 for heptane, 11 for oxygen, and so on) refer to molecular units. One heptane molecule reacts 
with eleven oxygen molecules to produce seven carbon dioxide molecules and eight water molecules.
The stoichiometry shows how many atoms are involved and how they are rearranged. The 7 carbon 
atoms in the heptane are incorporated into carbon dioxide. The hydrogen from the heptane appears in 
the water. The 22 atoms of oxygen appear as carbon dioxide (2 × 7 = 14 atoms) and water (8 atoms).
This is a balanced reaction because the number of carbon atoms in the reactants (left side) is the same 
as in the products (right side), and the same is true for the numbers of hydrogen and oxygen atoms. 
The number of moles of products and reactants do not usually balance. Burning heptane (above) shows 
12 moles of reactants forming 15 moles of products. 
The balanced reaction equation is also a statement of the mass balance because the masses of reactants 
on the left side must equal the masses of products on the right. But the stoichiometric coefficients 
indicate moles of material. They do not directly indicate the masses involved. Because of this, the key to 
deciphering the reaction stoichiometry is the conversion of molecular units to mass units. 
A mole is a measure of the number of atoms, molecules, or other specified particles. One gram mole 
(g-mole) contains about 6 × 1023 molecules, and one pound mole (lb-mole) contains about 2.7 × 1028 
molecules. 
The mole unit is defined as the mass of material divided by its molecular mass.
g-mole = mass in grams per molar mass
lb-mole = mass in pounds per molar mass
and so forth in any mass unit we wish to use.

Use the molar mass of each compound to convert from a molar basis to a mass basis. 
The atomic masses are C = 12, H = 1, and O = 16. 
The molar masses are the sum of the atomic masses in the molecule:
C7H16 = 7(12) + 16(1)  = 100 g/g mole  = 100 lb/lb mole  = 100 ton/ton mole 
CO2  = 1(12) + 2(16)  = 44 g/g mole  = 44 lb/lb mole  = 44 ton/ton mole 
O2  = 2(16)  
= 32 g/g mole  = 32 lb/lb mole  = 32 ton/ton mole 
H2O = 2(1) + 16  
= 18 g/g mole  = 18 lb/lb mole  = 18 ton/ton mole  
The mass in grams of substance reacting is calculated by multiplying the molar mass (grams per g-mole) of each substance 
by the number of moles. The proportions of reactants and products hold for any mass units. 
1 C7H16 
+ 
11 O2

7 CO2

1(100 g) = 100 g C7H16

Example 6.2 BURNING SLUDGE DIGESTER GAS (METHANE)
Digester gas or biogas is produced by anaerobic treatment of high-strength organic industrial wastewaters (e.g., food 
and brewing industries), municipal sewage sludge, agricultural waste (manure), and waste decomposition in landfills. 
A municipal sludge digester produces gas that is about 70% methane (CH4) and 30% carbon dioxide (CO2), plus traces 
of other gases. This gas has about seventy percent the fuel value of natural gas and can be burned to heat processes 
or buildings, or to drive motors connected to electric generators, pumps, or blowers. 
Calculate the material balance on the gases and water vapor entering and leaving the burner. Figure 6.1 shows the 
inputs and outputs of the combustion chamber. The entering nitrogen is unchanged in the burner and is not included 
in the stoichiometric equation. 
Figure 6.1 Combustion of gas from an anaerobic digester.
The basis will be an input of 1000 kg of dry digester gas, which contains 700 kg methane (70%) and 300 kg carbon 
dioxide (30%). 
The combustion of methane produces carbon dioxide according to 
	
CH4     +    2 O2            CO2      +      2 H2O

That is	
16 kg CH4 + 64 kg O2  44 kg CO2 + 36 kg H2O
Methane (CH4) is completely combustible so its material balance is 
	
Carbon Dioxide (CO2). The balanced chemical equation shows that 16 kg of methane burned produces 44 kg of carbon 
dioxide. Burning 700 kg methane yields
	
The material balance on carbon dioxide is

Material Balance with Chemical Reactions
Oxygen (O2). Oxygen is supplied by blowing air into the burner chamber. Ten percent excess is provided to insure 
complete combustion. The stoichiometric requirement for oxygen is 64 kg oxygen for every 16 kg of methane burned, 
or four parts oxygen per part of methane. This gives
	
Stoichiometric demand: Burning 700 kg methane consumes 4(700 kg) = 2,800 kg oxygen.
	
10% excess = 280 kg
	
Total input = 2,800 + 280 = 3,080 kg
	
O2 in exhaust gas = 3,080 – 2,800 = 280 kg 
Nitrogen (N2) is an inert gas that enters with the supplied air and exits, unreacted, in the exhaust gases. Air is 76.8% 
nitrogen and 23.2% oxygen by weight so each unit of oxygen brings along 76.8/23.2 = 3.31 units of nitrogen. The 
nitrogen carried into the burner with the 3,080 kg of oxygen will be (3.31)(3,080 kg) = 10,195 kg nitrogen. The same 
mass leaves in the exhaust gas.
Water. The digester gas and the incoming air will contain some water vapor. This may be important in an energy balance, 
because it will have to be heated in the gas burner, but it can be ignored in this example. The mass of water produced 
by the combustion is (700)(36/16) = 1,575 kg. It leaves as vapor in the exhaust gas.
In summary, assuming dry digester gas and dry input air, the material balance is

Case Study – Chemical Precipitation of Metals
Acidic wastewater (pH 2) from a metal fabricating shop contains 200 mg/L Nickel (Ni), 500 mg/L Zinc 
(Zn), and 50 mg/L Lead (Pb). These are total concentrations and the metals are 100% soluble at the 
acidic feed conditions. The wastewater flow is 1,000 m3/d.
The metals can be precipitated as sulfides (NiS, ZnS, and PbS) by adding a soluble form of sulfide (S2-). 
Sodium sulfide (Na2S) will be used. The reactor will operate at pH 8 and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) will 
be added to neutralize the acidic influent. A polymer is also added to coagulate the fine sulfide precipitates 
and facilitate separation by settling and filtration. The process is shown in the block diagram of Figure 6.2.
The sludge density will be 1,020 kg/m3 and the solids concentration will be 2% by weight (20 kg dry 
solids/m3 wet sludge). 
Figure 6.2 Block diagram of a process to remove lead, zinc, and nickel as a solid sulfide precipitate by adjusting the wastewater pH 
and adding sodium sulfide. The mass of metals in the effluent and in the filter washwater are important environmentally, but are 
negligible in the mass balance. Therefore, the calculations assume that all the metals precipitate and are removed as sludge from 
the settler.
Figure 6.3 shows how the solubility of the metals depends on the pH of the wastewater (Lewis 2010). 
The difficult problem of calculating the minimum solubility is not discussed here. Empirical data from 
the graph will be used.

Material Balance with Chemical Reactions
The maximum amount of all three metals will be removed if the reactor operates at pH 10, but an effluent 
of pH 10 would have to be brought into the range of 6-9 before discharge. Operating at pH 8 is a better 
choice, with an expected effluent quality of Zn = negligible, Ni = 0.01 mg/L and Pb = 0.002 mg/L. 
For comparison, the human health water quality criteria are 0.61 mg/L Ni, 7.4 mg/L Zn, and 0 mg/L 
Pb. The acute aquatic life criteria for freshwater are 0.47 mg/L Ni, 0.12 mg/L Zn, and 0.065 mg/L Pb.
There are two obstacles to achieving these effluent levels. The first is that the precipitation reaction 
may not reach equilibrium. That is, the concentration of soluble metal may be higher than predicted 
by Figure 6.3. Second, the separation process may not remove all of the precipitate solids. A polymer is 
added to agglomerate the small solids so they are easier to remove, but 100% removal is unlikely. One 
reference says that the estimated achievable 30-day average for sulfide precipitation followed by filtration 
is 0.02 mg/L Zn, 0.1 mg/L Ni, and 0.05 mg/L Pb (Whang 2005). 
The stoichiometry is simple. One atom of metal combines with one atom of sulfide. (The atomic and 
molecular masses are rounded to one decimal place.)

The superscripts indicate the ionic charge of the ions. Negative and positive ions combine to form neutral 
solids. Ions have the same atomic mass as the unionized atoms.
The arrow (↓) indicates a solid species that can be removed by settling or filtration. The details of the 
separation are omitted except to say that the treated water contains a negligible mass of particulate metal 
sulfides and the removed metals are contained in a sludge that has 2% solids concentration (2 kg dry 
solids per 100 kg of sludge) and a density of 1020 kg/m3.
Some empirical stoichiometry is needed to account for precipitates, such as calcium sulfate and iron 
hydroxides, that will form simultaneously with the sulfides. Experiments indicate that 2 kg of non-sulfide 
precipitates will be formed for each cubic meter of wastewater treated.

Assumptions: 
1)	 The estimated volume and mass of sludge are nearly the same whether the final effluent 
concentration of zinc is 0.01mg/L or 0.1 mg/L. Sludge quantities will be calculated as though 
all the metals have been removed.
2)	 The mass of solids removed in the filter is negligible compared with the amount removed in 
the settler. Therefore, the sludge quantities are calculated assuming 100% of the solids are in 
the settler sludge.
The basis for material balance is 1,000 m3.
Mass of metals in the wastewater feed
Mass Ni = (1000 m3)(0.2 kg/m3) = 200 kg
Mass Zn = (1000 m3)(0.8 kg/m3) = 800 kg
Mass Pb = (1000 m3)(0.05 kg/m3) = 50 kg

Sludge mass and volume
Total mass of solids in sludge = MS + Mother = 3,557 kg
Mass of sludge, at 2% solids = 3,557/0.02 = 177,850 kg
Sludge density = 1,020 kg/m3 
Volume of sludge = 177,850 kg/1020 kg/m3 = 174 m3 (rounded)
Figure 6.4 shows the material balance. About 17% of the influent leaves the process as metal-contaminated 
sludge that must be handled according to the regulations for hazardous waste disposal. The cost of 
disposal will be reduced by thickening the sludge. Doubling the concentration to 4% will reduce the 
volume by 50%, from 174 m3 to 87 m3. Another doubling, to 8% solids, will halve the volume again to 
43.5 m3. Reducing the volume to less than 10 m3 should be possible.

Empirical Stoichiometry in Wastewater Treatment 
Biological transformations are used in wastewater treatment to remove biodegradable organic compounds. 
Biodegradable means ‘able to be consumed or altered by a living organism’. The organisms of primary 
interest are bacteria. The organic compounds are mainly carbohydrates, fats and proteins, that contain 
carbon (C), hydrogen (H), oxygen (O), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and traces of other elements. 
It is impossible to write precise balanced stoichiometric equations for biological wastewater treatment 
because the kinds and amounts of the biodegradable organic compounds are not known. The empirical 
composition of the biodegradable organics in municipal wastewater can be obtained by analyzing for 
the common elements (C, H, O, N, P, S, etc.) but this is difficult and not useful unless one knows the 
fraction of the organics that become new bacterial cells.
Common practice is to measure the compositions of wastewater and sludge in ‘lumped’ or aggregated 
quantities, such as Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), total solids and volatile solids. A ‘lump’ of COD 
contains many kinds of organic chemicals and we don’t know or care what they are. We only need to 
know that COD can be changed into lumps of something else, like carbon dioxide or bacterial solids. 
Unlike a mass of an element (Ca) or chemical compound (CaCl2), “lumped parameters” cannot be 
expressed in the traditional chemical units of g-moles or kg-moles. They are measured in mass units 
(mg/L or mg/kg) and the empirical stoichiometry is in the form of a statement like “1 kg COD → 0.65 
kg suspended solids”.
Most of the substances in wastewater that are measured as COD are biodegradable organic compounds, 
but COD also includes compounds that are not biodegradable. 
This means that a biologically treated effluent may have a relatively large COD. It may happen that 98% 
of biodegradable organic compounds are removed but only 80% of COD is removed. The portion of the 
influent COD that is not touched by microbial action remains as COD in the effluent. Efficiency is best 
measured by the change in COD and not by the final concentration or the percent removal.
Organic solids are more precisely known as volatile solids because they are measured by burning 
(volatilizing) at 550°C. C, H, O, and N are volatilized when burned. Non-volatile substances remain as 
ash. Phosphorus is not volatile; it becomes part of the ash residue and is measured as an inert solid. The 
loss in mass (initial mass – ash residue) is the mass of the volatile solids.
An aerobic process (aerobic means that oxygen is required) will yield carbon dioxide and new bacterial 
cells. The hydrogen is converted to water. Nitrogen becomes ammonia or nitrate. Phosphorus is 
incorporated into new bacterial cells.

Material Balance with Chemical Reactions
The empirical relations for an aerobic process are 
1 kg BOD removed → 0.5 kg VSS (bacterial cells)
1 kg COD removed → 0.5 kg total suspended solids (TSS) produced
1 kg COD removed → 0.35–0.4 kg volatile suspended solids (VSS) produced
An anaerobic process (anaerobic means that oxygen is not required) will convert a fraction of the organic 
carbon to a gas that is typically 60-70% methane (CH4) and 30-40% carbon dioxide (CO2). Hydrogen is 
converted to water (H2O). The fate of nitrogen and phosphorus depends on the process.
The empirical relations for an anaerobic process are
1 kg Volatile Solids destroyed → 0.7–1.1 m3 gas produced (CH4 + CO2)
1 kg Volatile Solids destroyed → 0.55–0.75 m3 CH4 produced (assuming the gas is 70% methane)
1 kg COD destroyed → 0.30–0.45 m3 methane produced

Case Study – Anaerobic Sludge Digestion
Figure 6.5 shows sludge entering an anaerobic digester at a total solids concentration of 4% solids by 
dry weight; 70% of the solids are organic and 30% are inert. This is typical of municipal sewage sludge. 
The digested sludge solids are 50% organic and 50% inert.

The basis is 1000 kg of sludge. The tie components are inert solids (fixed solids) and water. All the inert 
solids leave in the digested sludge. Water entering with the sludge leaves with the sludge.
The sludge consists of 40 kg solids and 960 kg of water. 
The 40 kg of solids are divided into 28 kg (70%) of volatile solids (organic solids) and 12 kg (30%) of 
inert solids. The inert solids pass through the digester unchanged. The material balance on inert solids 
The solids in the digested sludge are 50% organic and 50% inert and
The 16 kg of gas produced can be burned to heat the digester or drive a gas engine. The composition is 
70% methane (CH4) and 30% carbon dioxide (CO2), by volume percent.

The solids concentration in the digested sludge = (100)(24)/(960 + 24) = 2.44%. Digestion changes the 
physical properties of the solids so the digested sludge can be easily dewatered, while the raw sludge 
cannot. A thickening process that would double the solids from 2.44% to 4.88% will reduce the sludge 
volume by half.

Case Study – Aerobic Wastewater Treatment
An activated sludge process is an aerated reactor that converts COD to carbon dioxide and bacterial 
cells followed by a clarifier to remove the solids (mainly flocculated bacterial cells) from the effluent. The 
bacterial cells are the ‘activated sludge’. The clarifier also functions to concentrate the solids for recyle 
to the reactor (return activated sludge = RAS) or for removal for sludge treatment (waste activated  
sludge = WAS). 
The next two sections explain the biological yield coefficient, first how it can be estimated from process 
operating data and, second, how the mass of biological solids produced in the process is estimated.
6.7.1	
Biomass Yield Factor in an Activated Sludge Process
The activated sludge process shown in Figure 6.6 has measured values for all the flow rates, total suspended 
solids (TSS) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD). These values can be used to calculate the biomass 
yield factor (Y) for the process, in kg TSS/kg BOD removed. 
WAS is waste activated sludge, which is intentionally removed from the activated sludge process to 
balance the new biomass that is produced by the treatment process.

Solids in waste activated sludge = QWASBODWAS = (16 m3/d)(12 kg/m3 TSS) = 192 kg/d TSS
Total solids out = 192 kg/d + 14.8 kg/d = 206.8 kg/d
Solids yield from BOD removal = Total solids out – Solids in primary influent
= 206.8 kg/d – 80 kg/d = 126.8 kg/d
BOD removed = (1,000 m3/d)(0.2 – 0.015 kg/m3) = 185 kg/d
Yield factor = (126.8 kg/d TSS produced)/(185 kg/d BOD removed) = 0.68 kg TSS/kg BOD removed
6.7.2	
Estimating the Waste Activated Sludge for an Activated Sludge Process
Figure 6.7 is the block diagram for an activated sludge process that will treat 24,000 m3/d with a COD = 
0.5 kg/m3 (500 mg/L). This is a daily load of 12,000 kg/d. Ninety percent of the influent COD is removed, 
so the effluent contains 0.05 kg/m3 (50 mg/L), or 1,200 kg/d. The effluent contains 0.01 kg/m3 of total 
suspended solids, or 10 mg/L TSS. 
The empirical stoichiometry is
1 kg COD removed → 0.5 kg total suspended solids (TSS) produced
1 kg COD removed → 0.35 – 0.4 kg volatile suspended solids (VSS) produced
The bacterial solids in the sludge coming off the bottom of the clarifier have a specific gravity just slightly 
larger than 1.0 and we assume the density of the waste activated sludge is 1000 kg/m3. The total solids 
concentration is 1% solids by weight, which is 10 kg/m3 = 10,000 mg/L. The solids are 75% volatile and 
25% fixed, or 7,500 mg/L volatile solids and 2,500 mg/L fixed solids. Another assumption is that the 
dissolved solids are negligible in comparison to the suspended solids (roughly 200 mg/L dissolved and 
10,000 mg/L suspended solids).

The basis is 24,000 m3 of wastewater and 12,000 kg COD.
The overall material balance on COD is:
CODinf = CODremoved + CODeff + CODWAS
(24,000 m3)(0.5 kg/m3) = COD removed + (24,000 – QWAS)(0.05 kg/m3) + (QWAS)(0.05 kg/m3)
CODremoved = (24,000 m3)(0.5 kg/m3) – (24,000 m3)(0.05 kg/m3) = 10,800 kg COD

The term QWAS (0.05 kg/m3) is the mass of COD in the liquid that carries the waste activated sludge, 
assuming it is the same concentration as the effluent COD.
The empirical stoichiometry for the conversion of COD to biomass
0.5 kg TSS produced per 1 kg COD removed
TSS produced = (0.5 kg/kg)(10,800 kg COD removed) = 5,400 kg TSS 
VSS produced = 0.75 TSS produced = (0.75)(5,400 kg) = 4,050 kg VSS
Waste Activated Sludge Calculation. The reactor is operated so the mass of total suspended solids and 
volatile suspended solids is constant. This means that all solids produced are removed, either in the 
effluent or as waste activated sludge (WAS).
TSS produced = TSS removed as WAS +TSSeff
5,400 kg = (10 kg/m3)(QWAS) + (0.01 kg/m3)(24,000 m3 – QWAS)
5,400 kg = 10 QWAS +240 kg – 0.01 QWAS
9.99 QWAS = 5,160
QWAS = 517 m3
The waste activated sludge flow (WAS) is about 2% of the influent. The WAS must be further concentrated 
and stabilized before disposal. This can be done by gravity thickening and anaerobic digestion. The volume 
can be reduced by 75% by thickening the solids from 1% to 4%. The limit for gravity thickening or dissolved 
air flotation is 4–6% solids. More thickening requires special equipment and is not often economical. 
After anaerobic digestion the sludge volume can be reduced by a variety of economical treatments.
A short-cut approximation assumes that effluent suspended solids are negligible in comparison to WAS 
solids. The relative amounts calculated in this example were 240 kg effluent solids and 5,160 kg WAS 
solids. This assumption gives an approximate WAS volume of 540 m3 instead of 517 m3. Approximations 
based on reasonable assumptions can be useful first approximations.

Hypothetical Case Study – Cutter Chemicals
This hypothetical case study is about the Cutter Chemicals Company’s request for a permit from the 
Department of Environmental Protection to discharge treated wastewater into the Fox River. The 
chemistry is simplified and many details are omitted, but it illustrates a realistic problem analysis. 
The company has proposed a new chemical manufacturing plant near Barstow on the Fox River. Figure 
6.8 is a map of the region indicating several factors that must be assessed.

Figure 6.8 Map of the Fox River showing the proposed location of the Cutter Chemicals facility.
Cutter Chemicals. We propose to construct a chemical plant on the Fox River, south of the city of 
Barstow. The output will be 20 T/d of silicone polymer. About 100 new jobs will be created with an 
annual payroll of $6,000,000. We need a permit to discharge small amounts of wastewater into the river. 
An explicit requirement is that dissolved oxygen in the river shall not fall below 4 mg/L at any time or 
place. Discharge of grease or other floating materials is not permitted. Chloride concentration shall not 
exceed 250 mg/L. No toxic chemicals shall be discharged. The treated wastewater effluent BOD and the 
effluent suspended solids shall not exceed an average of 20 mg/L over any monthly period.
Those requirements are clear and we have no problem with compliance. Our difficulty is with another 
part of the state statute that uses the non-technical term ‘injurious’. We are not sure how to evaluate that. 
The language is: “What is or may become injurious to public health, safety, and welfare; what is or may 
become injurious to recreational uses; what is or may become injurious to industrial or municipal water 
use; what is or may become injurious to fish, migratory bird life, or wild animal life shall be prohibited 
under water pollution control provisions of the State.”
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). We can begin by helping you assemble the technical data 
that must be submitted in the application for a discharge permit. A public hearing will eventually be 
called to give all interested parties a chance to testify. These are some areas where there could be injury, 
which we would avoid by negotiating special conditions in your discharge permit.

We are particularly concerned about the down-river effects of the discharge. 
1.	 The City of Atlantis, 10 miles downstream of Barstow, takes its drinking water from 
the river, which is an excellent source of municipal water. The calcium content is less 
than 40 mg/L. Calcium, along with magnesium, causes hardness, so it is obvious why 
Atlantis is interested in this water quality parameter. They would object to an increase in 
water hardness.
2.	 The Atlantic Canning Company cans vegetables during July, August, September, and 
October and uses water purchased from the Atlantis Municipal Water Utility. While the 
municipal water supplied is usually of high quality, there are problems during the low 
summer flow when the water has a slight musty odor. Thus far, this has caused no problem 
for the canning company, but we must be careful not to aggravate the odor problem. 
Obviously anything that affected the taste of the water would be objectionable as well. 
3.	 The Fox River is used for recreation, and fish and wildlife are abundant.
4.	 The fruit and vegetable farms, located north and east of Atlantis, irrigate their crops with 
river water during the summer growing season. Table 6.1 gives guidelines for irrigation 
water quality.

Before going farther, help us understand how your manufacturing process, the kinds if wastes it will 
generate, and their sources in the factory.
Cutter. We manufacture synthetic polymers that are composed of the elements silicon, carbon, hydrogen, 
and oxygen. They may take the form of oily liquids, resins, or rubbery solids (elastomers), depending 
on their chemical composition and the average size of the molecule. The product is able to withstand 
comparatively high temperatures without decomposing and it is chemically inert to dilute acids and most 
reagents, except strong alkalis and hydrofluoric acid, both of which can destroy their basic structure.
The starting material is silica in the form of sand or quartzite (SiO2). Silicon is vigorously attacked by 
gaseous chlorine, and hydrofluoric acid, nitric acid, or aqueous ammonia at ordinary temperatures. It 
stands just below carbon in the periodic table and is expected by simple analogy to form chain and ring 
compounds with hydrogen and halides (Cl, F), as well as to form complex hydrogen-oxygen compounds.
The process starts by reacting methyl chloride (CH3Cl) with silicon (Si) to make a simple chlorosilane 
compound. A catalyst is required.
                                            catalyst 
2 CH3Cl      +     Si     Æ    CH3CH3SiCl2 
methyl chloride       silicon                chlorosilane 
Then water is added to replace the chloride with hydroxide. Sometimes this is done in a solvent. This 
yields dimethylsiloxane, a silicone resin that will condense to form a polymer. The process can be adjusted 
to manufacture polymers with different desirable properties.

EPA. The acidic process and quench water cannot be discharged directly into the river. They will need to 
be neutralized and discharged into an aerated lagoon with a settling pond. The pond must be constructed 
to avoid groundwater contamination or seepage directly to the river. The clear water from this pond 
may be discharged to the river.
The 150,000 mg/L chloride content of the quench water is a problem. It raises the chloride concentration 
of the combined effluent to 78,000 mg/L.
The cooling water blowdown contains mineral salts and can be discharged directly to the river, if it is 
not contaminated with biocides, corrosion inhibitors, copper, or phosphates.
Cutter. The acidity of the quench and process water streams is caused by hydrochloric acid (HCl) which 
is formed in the hydrolysis reaction during the manufacturing. All we need to do is inject lime (Ca(OH)2) 
into these waste streams prior to aeration to bring the pH toward the 7 to 8 range. 
Environmental Protection Agency. Neutralization does not change the chloride content, but it does 
increase the calcium, because lime is calcium hydroxide. The calcium and the chloride will be soluble 
in the river.
The balanced stoichiometric equation for the neutralization is
 
Ca(OH)2  + 2 HCl      Æ     Ca2+   +      2Cl-      +      2 H2O 
                        lime                 acid                    calcium           chloride               water

This shows that approximately 74 kg of lime is needed to neutralize 72.8 kg of HCl, or about 1 kg 
per kg. Each kg of acid neutralized results in 40/72.8 = 0.55 kg of calcium and about 1 kg of chloride  
(70.8/72.8 = 0.97 kg/kg). This is 1.55 kg of soluble minerals, Ca and Cl, put into the river for each kg 
of acid neutralized.

CaCO3. Neutralization of 1 kg of HCl creates 1.38 kg of hardness.
Atlantis and the Atlantis Canning Company will argue that the higher levels of hardness and chloride 
are injurious. 
The neutralization could be done with sodium hydroxide, NaOH, instead of calcium hydroxide but this 
would only put sodium into the river instead of calcium.
NaOH + HCl → Na+ + Cl– + H2O
This does not increase the water hardness, but each 1 kg of NaOH adds almost 0.6 kg of Na+ and sodium 
is not good in irrigation water, so changing chemicals does not eliminate our concern.
Cutter Chemicals. The total effluent is only 230 m3/d and the river is large enough to provide substantial 
dilution. The concentrations in the river need to be calculated.
The theoretical stoichiometry for producing 20,000 kg/d dimethylsiloxane and 15,834 kg/d HCl predicts 
a chloride concentration in the quench water of 132,000 mg/L. The actual stoichiometry will be less 
efficient so we have based our analysis on a chloride concentration of 150,000 mg/L in 120 m3/d of 
quench water, which is 18,000 kg/d Cl. 
We will use this higher value and assume that all the chloride comes from the production of HCl. 
The 18,000 kg/d Cl contained in 18,508 kg HCl is
(18,508 kg HCl)/(36.45 kg/kg-mol) = 507.8 kg-mol HCl
To neutralize 1 mole of HCl requires 0.5 moles of lime, or 253.9 kg-mol Ca(OH)2. The mass of lime is
(253.9 kg-mol)(74.1 kg/kg-mole) = 18,812 kg/d Ca(OH)2
The mass of calcium is
The calcium causes water hardness: 40 kg Ca2+ = 100 kg hardness expressed as CaCO3.

Table 6.4 gives representative historical river flows measured just below Cutter’s proposed discharge. The 
lowest river flow occurs in September; the average flow for this month is 2.69 m3/s. The lowest recorded 
river flow is 1.30 m3/s. The chloride and calcium concentrations observed at the record low flow condition 
were 125 mg/L and 75 mg/L, respectively.
At the lowest flow ever recorded the effluent would be diluted by 1.30 m3/s = 112,320 m3/d with a chloride 
concentration of 125 mg/L. The dilution factor is 1000 to 1.
Calculate the chloride in the river below the discharge.
(River Cl, mg/L)(112,550 m3/d) = (78,300 mg/L)(230 m3/d) + (125 mg/L)(112,320 m3/d)
River Cl = 285 mg/L
The estimated chloride concentration for each month, based on the average river flow, is given in Table 6.4. 
The concentrations are increased greatly by the industrial waste load and they reach worrisome levels, 
even at average flow conditions. At low flow the concentrations might be two or three times larger the 
estimates shown.

EPA. Discharging this neutralized waste acid will definitely degrade the water quality. We will not 
grant a discharge permit for the proposed levels of chloride and the anticipated levels of calcium after 
neutralization.
The Atlantis Canning Company and Atlantis electric power utility use river water in their cooling system 
and boilers. The existing concentrations of 40–60 mg/L chloride and 20–40 mg/L calcium are excellent. 
The water can be recycled through the cooling towers and the boilers many times before the chloride 
levels increase to a problem level. The same is true for calcium because at the low natural levels there 
are no major scaling problems.

Cutter. This is a question of economics as well as technical feasibility. Both can be studied. We will 
redesign to reduce the waste production. We do not want to face the cost and embarrassment of building 
the process only to discover that it is a polluter and has to be extensively modified.
EPA. There may be other wastewater problems. We may ask you to remove at least 90 percent of the 
phosphorus from the sanitary sewage. Also, you will need to justify your assertion that the cooling water 
can be discharged directly. We also advise that you check on whether any material that enters the process 
contains a regulated toxic substance.
You will need similar evaluations in support of permits for gaseous emissions, solids waste disposal, and 
stormwater management. 
In short, it is essential to assess the hazard potential of every step of the manufacturing process, including 
raw materials receiving and product shipping, to insure no problem has been overlooked.
Cutter. (A short time later). We have discovered a much better way of synthesizing silicone that 
eliminates most of the problems with chloride and calcium in the wastewater. Instead of adding water 
to hydrolyze the chlorosilanes, we can use methanol (methyl alcohol). The chlorosilane and methanol 
react to produce methyl chloride and silicone. The methyl chloride is recycled. This reaction eliminates 
the acid formation and the need for neutralization. The amount of wastewater is reduced by about 75 
percent and the amount of salts going to the river is reduced by almost 99 percent. Figure 6.12 shows 
the proposed “river-friendly” silicone synthesis process. The wastewater output is approximately 0.75 T 
per 1 T of silicone produced, with less and 50 kg waste salts.
 Figure 6.12 Flow diagram for the revised process. 
Final Comments. The material balance is an essential tool for assessing the potential impacts of industrial 
and domestic effluents on the environment. In this case the original effluent was too acidic. The proposed 
lime treatment would solve that problem, but it would do nothing to reduce the chloride emissions, 
and the calcium in the lime was itself a new pollutant. The high levels of calcium and chloride would 
degrade the river and disadvantage users of the river water and, as a result, were pollutants even though 
they were not toxic.

Conclusion
The balanced chemical equation that shows reactants and products, in their proper proportions, is a 
statement of a material balance. The mass of atoms in the reactants (inputs) must also appear as products 
(outputs). The process material balance with chemical transformations is how we keep track of the 
material as it moves through the system. 
Empirical stoichiometry is often used in pollution control work. This stoichiometry is expressed as 
‘lumped’ measurements of substances that cannot be expressed in the usual chemical units of moles. 
Total solids, suspended solids, BOD and COD are such substances. They are measured in mass units and 
the empirical stoichiometry in statements such as “1 kg COD → 0.65 kg suspended solids”.
This introduction to the material balance showed how to work out a great deal of information about a 
process, but it did not determine the size of the processes. The volume and detention time of the reactors 
were not calculated. The implicit assumption was that the detention time, whatever its duration, was 
sufficient for the chemical transformations to run to completion. That is, all reactants became part of 
the products as shown in the balanced stoichiometric equation. The calculation of reaction rates and 
detention times will be explained in another book about chemical and biological transformations.

The Unsteady-State Material Balance
7	 The Unsteady-State 
Material Balance
7.1	
The Design Problem
Unsteady-state problems have changing inputs and/or outputs and/or changing operating conditions. 
Flows and concentrations may change, reactor temperatures may change, and so on.
These issues can be handled during preliminary design by making a steady-state analysis for minimum, 
maximum, and average conditions. The later stages of detailed design may require more study of the 
process dynamics.
7.2	
The Unsteady-State Material Balance
The unsteady-state material balance, shown in Figure 7.1, applied over a specified time interval is 
This balance is maintained even when material species are being created or destroyed within the region. 
Figure 7.1 Accumulation of material within the region makes the process unsteady-state.
7.3	
Unsteady-State Storage Systems
Some processes and operations are unsteady-state because material is being intentionally stored 
or discharged. 
•	 A batch drying operation retains solids while water or solvent is lost by evaporation. The 
rate of evaporation decreases as the solids concentration increases, so this is an unsteady-
state process.
•	 Pumping stations have a small reservoir (wet well) from which water is drawn into the 
pumps. The rate of inflow is variable so the volume of water in the wet well varies. If the 
reservoir is large enough the pump may be able to operate continuously at a uniform 
rate, which increases the efficiency. If the wet well is relatively small, pumps will operate 
intermittently, being switched off when the wet well is drawn down and turned on when the 
wet well is full.

The Unsteady-State Material Balance
•	 A storm water detention pond collects rainfall runoff and snowmelt at certain times 
and the accumulated volume is discharged in a pattern that controls sediment loss and 
avoids flooding.
•	 A run-of-river reservoir for flood control or drinking water supply has the same behavior. 
The reservoir volume, depth and surface area will change throughout the year as inflows 
fluctuate with rainfall and snow melt. Outflows may be controlled by hydroelectric turbine 
operations or water demand. 
•	 Influents to wastewater treatment processes that are highly variable in pH or pollutant 
loading can be smoothed in mixed tanks of constant or variable volume. This can be 
economical and beneficial.

Example 7.1 SLUDGE DRYING
A 1 kg portion of sludge was dried in a shallow pans exposed to outdoor summer conditions. At the beginning of 
the experiment each pan contained 0.05 kg solids and 0.95 kg water. From time to time, a pan of drying sludge was 
weighed to obtain the results in Table 7.1, which shows the unsteady-state material balance for the sludge, solids, and 
water in the drying pans at one-hour intervals for 8 hours. Figure 7.2 shows the mass of water in the pan and the rate 
of evaporation. The rate of evaporation decreases over time because the water cannot migrate to the sludge surface as 
easily when the solids are more concentrated.

The Unsteady-State Material Balance
Example 7.2 STORMWATER DETENTION POND
A 25 hectare (ha) development will have a one hectare stormwater collection pond with a volume of 20,000 m3. 
(1 ha = 10,000 m2 = 2.47 acres). There is no stream to feed the pond. The soil is sandy clay loam with an infiltration rate 
of I = 0.05 m/day. The site is 75% impervious surfaces (roads, roofs, etc.). The runoff coefficient is 0.64, meaning that 
64% of the precipitation onto the land will runoff, while 36% will infiltrate, evaporate, or be stored in depressions. Will 
the site support the proposed retention pond?
The change in volume of water in the detention pond is
 
ΔV = Runoff + Direct Precipitation– Evaporation– Infiltration
Direct Precipitation falls directly onto the 1 ha surface of the pond. Runoff is calculated from precipitation that falls on 
the 24 ha land area. All quantities are seasonal except infiltration rate, which for convenience is assumed constant over 
the year.
The quantities in the material balance are calculated for January, using the values in Table 7.2.
The proposed storage pond has a maximum volume of 20,000 m3 so there are months when water can be stored in the 
pond and months when it overflows. The storage is calculated assuming a pond volume of 14,635 m3 at the beginning 
of January. A pond volume of almost 29,000 m3 would be required if no overflow is permitted.

The Unsteady-State Material Balance
Example 7.3 PUMPING STATION WET WELL
Pumps draw their input from a reservoir (wet-well) that always contains a minimum depth of water so the pump will 
not run dry. The flow rate into the reservoir is variable so the reservoir inventory increases and decreases. The reservoir 
is an unsteady-state process and the material balance must account for that.
Figure 7.3 is a cumulative inflow diagram for a wet well that will equalize flow over short time periods. The goal is to 
pump from the reservoir at the average rate of inflow, which is 40,000 m3/20 h = 2,000 m3/h over the 20-hour period. 
The graph is a graphical solution for the amount of water that must be stored. 
Lines with a slope of 2000 m3/h have been drawn tangent to the cumulative inflow curve to identify the times when 
the rate of inflow is equal to the desired average rate of outflow. Point a is such a point. From about hours 7 -10 hours 
the rate of inflow exceeds the rate of outflow and the reservoir is filling (the pumps are shut off). At point b inflow and 
outflow rates are again equal, the rate of inflow decreases, and the reservoir volume starts to decrease (the pumps are 
turned on). At point c there is another reversal in the fill-empty cycle. The volume of water that must be stored between 
points a and b (hours 7–10) is 7,000 m3; the volume of water that must be stored between points c and d is 5,000 m3.
Figure 7.3 Cumulative inflow diagram for a graphical solution for flow equalization.  
The average rate of inflow over the 20-hour interval is 40,000 m3/20 h = 2,000 m3/h.
For a wastewater pumping station the cumulative inflow curves would be constructed for a series of days 
that represent the average and the extreme conditions. Storage is beneficial because pumping efficiency is 
higher when the flow is more constant (see chapter 14). Flow equalization of the influent to a wastewater 
treatment plant is rare because the required storage volume is large and the benefits are not.
This cumulative flow analysis is most useful for inflows that have a continuous flow with a fairly regular 
seasonal or diurnal pattern. The cumulative curve is not so convenient for batch discharges, especially 
if they arrive randomly.

The Unsteady-State Material Balance – Batch Smoothing
Many industries produce product and waste in batches. Tanning, brewing, and pharmaceuticals are 
examples. Batches that are variable in volume and strength can create problems in wastewater treatment 
processes. Depending on the magnitude of the variation and the downstream processing, blending may 
be helpful to smooth the flow, the concentration and the mass load, or the flow and the mass load.
Figure 7.4 Three-steps for batch blending.
Batch smoothing and blending is done in three steps, shown in Figure 7.4. An incoming batch is dumped 
into a blender and mixed with the contents. Mixing makes the contents homogeneous and keeps particles 
from settling out. Then a batch is withdrawn. A material balance is made for each blending sequence.

The Unsteady-State Material Balance
7.5	
Smoothing the Flow Rate
Batch dumps of wastewater vary randomly in volume and this creates an unacceptable condition in the 
receiving wastewater treatment process. The flows need to be smoothed or equalized. The problem is to 
determine the storage volume of the flow equalization tank. The solution is found by making a material 
balance for each batch.
Figure 7.5 shows 20 random batches of wastewater that have volumes ranging from 1,000 m3 to 10,000 m3. 
The average volume of the 20 batches is 4,850 m3. Each arriving batch will be put into a mixed tank. 
Before the next batch arrives, 4,850 m3 (the average batch size) will be withdrawn. The volume of liquid 
in the tank will increase or decrease after each fill-draw cycle. 
The general material balance equation is 
Vt = Vt-1 + Bt – 4,850 m3
where Vt is the volume stored in the tank and Bt is the volume of an incoming batch. The subscripts 
indicate the sequence over time.

Figure 7.5 Pattern of batch dumps from an industrial process. The average batch size is 4,850 m3.
Begin by assuming an initial volume of liquid in the blender, say V0 = 5,000 m3. The material balances 
for the first three batches are 
V1 = V0 + B1 – 4,850 m3 = 5,000 + 5,000 – 4,850 = 5,150 m3
V2 = V1 + B2 – 4,850 m3 = 5,150 + 10,000 – 4,850 = 10,300 m3
V3 = V2 + B3 – 4,850 m3 = 10,300 + 8,000 – 4,850 = 13,450 m3

The Unsteady-State Material Balance
The results of the 20 step-wise calculations are in Table 7.3. The maximum volume in the blender is 
18,750 m3 and the minimum is 5,050 m3, for this load pattern and an initial volume of 5,000 m3. The 
maximum volume change is ΔV = 18,730 – 5,000 = 13,750 m3. Based on this admittedly short record of 
batch dumps, a reasonable volume for the tank would be 20,000 m3 to prevent overflow and to be sure 
the tank is never pumped dry.

Smoothing Concentrations
Figure 7.6 shows the results of smoothing the concentration of 50 random batches of wastewater, each 
of volume 5 m3, in blenders with initial volumes of 5 m3, 20 m3 and 50 m3. The initial concentration in 
the blender is assumed at 15 kg/m3, giving initial stored inventories of 75 kg, 300 kg, and 750 kg. The 
larger blender volumes do more smoothing, but V0 = 20 m3 is almost efficient as V0 = 50 m3.
Table 7.4 shows some calculations for an initial volume of 5 m3. The operation is to mix one batch into 
the blender until the contents are homogeneous and then to withdraw 5 m3. The initial volume of 5 m3 
increases to 10 m3 and then goes back to 5 m3. 
Figure 7.6 Smoothed concentrations of batch dumps using blending tanks with initial volumes of 5 m3, 
20 m3 and 50 m3. The volume of each entering batch is 5 m3 and 5 m3 is removed at the end of each 
mixing cycle.

Smoothing Mass Loads
Smoothing the flow rate to a treatment process will also smooth the mass load. The 20 random batch 
volumes in Table 7.3 vary from 1 to 10 m3. The pollutant concentrations of the batches vary from 2 to 
8 kg/m3 (2,000 to 8,000 mg/L). The mass of pollutant in a batch varies from 72 to 2 kg/m3. This 10 to 
1 variation in volume and 35 to 1 variation in mass load would produce shock after shock to a waste 
treatment process. Smoothing will be beneficial.

The Unsteady-State Material Balance
The total volume of the 20 batches is 97 m3 and the total pollution mass load is 494 kg, giving an average 
mass load of 494 kg/20 = 24.7 kg per batch, or 494 kg/94 m3 = 5.25 kg/m3. 
Figure 7.7 shows the results for an initial blender volume = 5 m3 and the initial blender contents 
concentration = 3 kg/m3, giving an initial mass of pollutant in the blender of (5 m3)(3 kg/m3) = 15 kg. 
The volume removed is a uniform 4.85 m3 per batch.
Even a small blender is quite effective because the volumes and concentrations are both random, and 
random variation is the easiest kind to smooth. The 35/1 range in mass load has been reduced to about 3/1.

Dynamic Response of Continuous Flow Reactors
Batch operations, as discussed in the previous section, are common when relatively small volumes of 
material are processed, as one might see in pharmaceuticals, brewing, and tanning. Continuous-flow 
reactors are more common in water and wastewater treatment. 
We use the term reactor even though the flow in these examples carries an inert tracer so there is no 
reaction. The focus is on the behavior of the reactor. 
A plug-flow reactor (PFR) is a long tube or tank that has no mixing along the axis of the reactor. This is 
an idealization. Every real tank has some mixing, if only from the turbulence of the flowing fluid, but 
this can often be ignored, as we do here.
The theoretical hydraulic detention time, θ, of a reactor is the volume, V, divided by the flow rate, Q.
θ = V/Q 
This is the average length of time that a fluid element is held within the reactor volume. 
In the examples that follow, θ = V/Q = 5 h, which is chosen arbitrarily. This could result when V = 10 
and Q = 2, or with many other values of V and Q. We will assume that V = 50 m3 and Q = 10 m3/h.
Figure 7.8(a) shows an ideal plug-flow reactor with detention time, θ = 5 h. Whatever enters the tank at 
time t leaves at time t + θ. In the top panel, a pulse of 50 mg/L enters at t = 5 h and exits at t = 5 + θ. In 
the bottom panel the concentrations steps from 0 mg/L to 50 mg/L and stays at that level indefinitely. 
The step at the inlet occurs at t = 5 h and it appears at the reactor exit and at t = 5 + θ = 10 h.
Figure 7.8(b) shows a more realistic reactor that has some mixing along the direction of flow (i.e. 
axial mixing), as would result from natural turbulence. The slight distortion between the ideal and the 
more realistic effluent can usually be ignored. This is the case in the transport of material in rivers and 
pipelines. In estuaries and reservoirs, and in reactors that are aerated or otherwise mixed, plug flow is 
a poor reactor model.

 (b) Response for a real plug flow reactor (θ = V/Q = 5 h)
Figure 7.8 An ideal plug-flow reactor conveys material without intermixing along the reactor axis. A pulse that 
enters at time t = 5 h leaves the reactor as an identical pulse one hydraulic detention time later. In this case the 
detention time is 5 hours. A more realistic reactor has some axial mixing, but this can often be ignored.
Figure 7.9 shows the behavior of an ideal continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR), which is mixed so well 
that the contents are homogeneous. That is, whatever enters the tank is instantaneously mixed with the 
contents and the concentration is the same everywhere in the tank. It follows that the concentration of the 
effluent, no matter where it may be withdrawn, is the same as the concentration in the reactor.

The Unsteady-State Material Balance
The top panel of the diagram shows a pulse (or slug) of inert tracer coming into the CSTR in an amount 
that causes the concentration in the tank to immediately increase from zero to 50 mg/L. For a reactor 
volume of V = 50 m3, a 2.5 kg pulse of tracer will produce the 50 mg/L concentration.
After the sudden 2.5 kg input, the influent is free of tracer and the concentration of tracer in the 
tank decreases exponentially as it washes out. At one detention time (whatever value it may be), the 
concentration will been reduced by about two-thirds. For this example, C0 = 50 mg/L and θ = 5 h, and
After three detention times the tracer in the reactor and in the effluent is 5% of the initial concentration. 
At five detention times the concentration is less than 1%.
A step input (lower panel of Figure 7.9) causes the concentration to increase from zero to the level of 
the step concentration, 50 mg/L in this series of examples. The model is
For C0 = 50 and θ = 5
For t = 5, C(t=5) = 31.6; for t = 10, C(t=10) = 43.2
The CSTR is another idealization, but there are reactors that are vigorously mixed with mechanical 
agitators or aeration and do closely approximate the ideal. 
•	 A neutralization tank may have a detention time of 10 to 30 minutes, compared with a time 
of 10-30 seconds to uniformly distribute the neutralizing chemicals throughout the tank. 
There is no significant error in treating the reactor as an ideal CSTR. 
•	 Aeration tanks in the activated sludge biological treatment process are thoroughly mixed by 
the large volumes of air that are injected to sustain the aerobic bacteria that are cultured to 
degrade the waste. An ideal CSTR, or a series of two or three CSTRs, is an adequate model 
for the process. 
•	 The wind-mixed upper layer (the epilimnion) of a stratified lake is often modeled as a 
CSTR. The same can be done for the virtually unmixed bottom layer (the hypolimnion), 
not because it is well mixed but because it is homogeneous. During turnover a deep lake or 
reservoir actually does become homogeneous.

Figure 7.10 The response of an inert tracer in two CSTRs in series. Both reactors have constant volume and are stirred 
so the contents are homogeneous at any given time. The total hydraulic detention time is 5 hours, as in Figure 7.9.
Figure 7.11 Response of n stirred tanks-in-series to a spike input of C0 = 50 mg/L.
Figure 7.10 shows the response of two CSTRs in series. The tanks are constant volume, each with a 
detention time of 2.5 h, so the total detention is 5 h, the same as the example in Figure 7.9. Figure 7.11 
shows the behavior of n = 1, 2, 4 and 10 tanks-in-series. The total detention time of the n tanks is θ = 5 h 
and the tanks have identical and constant volumes. It is interesting, and probably unexpected, that adding 
more tanks-in-series makes the system behave more and more like a plug flow reactor with axial mixing. 
This makes tanks-in-series models a convenient way to approximate many real reactor configurations.
The equation derivations have been omitted because, for most people, what is useful is to have a picture 
of the dynamics in your mind. This picture is a reminder that one or two stirred tanks reduce the ‘shock’ 
of sudden changes in the input.

Numerical Solutions
The response of any reactor to changes in input conditions can be approximated by using iterative 
calculations over small time intervals. Consider a step change in input to a CSTR (lower panel of

Here are the first three time intervals for a step change in concentration from 0 mg/L to 50 mg/L, for 
the conditions V = 1, Q = 5, θ = V/Q = 5 and Dt = 0.1.
This simple arithmetic was repeated 250 times to simulate 25 hours of flow through the stirred reactor. 
The partial results are in Table 7.6. The right hand column in Table 7.6 is the exact solution. The difference 
between the numerical approximation and the exact solution is unimportant in an application such as this. 
Making Dt smaller will improve the accuracy of the estimation.

A new term is added to the material balance equation when there is a chemical reaction. For the case 
of a chemical that disappears at a rate proportional to the concentration of the chemical in the reactor 
the term is (-kCV), where k is a rate coefficient. The change in mass in the continuous-flow stirred tank 
reactor over a small time interval, Dt, is

In the example above, the chemical was an inert material (a non-reactive tracer) so there was no reaction

We have shown the numerical approximation that can be used by anyone who does not know calculus 
and differential equations. Also it can be adapted to more complicated systems where it may be difficult 
to find an analytical solution to the differential equations. (Anyone who is interested in the differential 
equations can find them in numerous books and on-line articles.)

Case Study – Municipal Activated Sludge Process
Figure 7.12 shows the flow, activated sludge process influent BOD and effluent BOD, measured at 2-hour 
intervals over a ten day period, at the Nine Springs Wastewater Treatment plant in Madison, WI. This 
data is for 1976, which is ancient history for this treatment plant, but the influent patterns today are the 
same and the levels are somewhat higher. 
The maximum inflow every day is about twice the minimum flow, ranging from 23 mgd to 48 mgd. The 
day with the lowest flow is Sunday. The strength of the influent to the activated sludge aeration basin 
typically ranges daily between 125 mg/L BOD5 at night to 200 mg/L BOD5 during the day. The raw 
wastewater entering the treatment plant varied between 170 mg/L and 260 mg/L. This means that the mass 
load of BOD coming into the treatment process changes by a factor of about 4 every 24-h diurnal cycle.

The Unsteady-State Material Balance
Figure 7.12 The dynamic behavior of a conventional activated sludge wastewater treatment plant 
(Madison, WI, 1976) before the process was modified for nitrification and biological phosphorus removal.
The bottom panel of Figure 7.12 shows the effluent BOD from the activated sludge process. The total 
effluent BOD varies between 10 and 20 mg/L, except for three spikes, and the soluble BOD varies between 
5 and 10 mg/L. The spikes are caused ineffective removal of suspended solids and they correspond to 
high flow during the day. 
This old conventional process did a good job of absorbing the four to five-fold fluctuations of the influent 
load (flow × BOD). There are three reasons for this. The process had a long detention time, about 10 
hours, a high concentration of bacteria was maintained in the system, and the reactor was essentially 
three stirred tanks-in-series. Stirred tanks buffered changes in influent concentration and having several 
tanks in series increased the buffering and blending that occurred.
The plant was upgraded in the 1980s to do nitrification and again in the 1990s for biological phosphorus 
removal. Since then the average effluent SS and BOD are about 2 mg/L, despite the same diurnal influent 
loading change of at least four to one.

Conclusion
Unsteady-state dynamics are normal in real environmental systems. The behavior of many important 
real natural and constructed processes can be understood by analyzing ideal reactors. 
It is often acceptable to assume steady-state conditions for design. Common practice is to analyze a system 
at a maximum, minimum, and average loading. If good performance is indicated at these conditions, 
the system is expected to handle the normal dynamic variations, unless the changes are shockingly fast 
and large. 
Two exceptions are flow equalization and blending, which are strongly unsteady state and must be 
modeled that way. The analysis is easily done with a series of simple material balance calculations.
Numerical (iterative) procedures often give excellent approximate solutions when exact analytical 
solutions of differential equations are difficult or unavailable.

Water Conservation and Reuse
8	 Water Conservation and Reuse
8.1	
The Design Problem
Water conservation sustains the available water supply, protects fresh water habitats, reduces the need for 
building new storage reservoirs, eliminates or postpones the expansion of existing water and wastewater 
treatment plants, conserves energy, and stabilizes the price of water. Sustainability demands that the 
withdrawal of fresh water from an ecosystem should not exceed its natural replacement rate. Sadly, many 
parts of the world, and the United States, are operating at unsustainable rates of water use.
Figure 8.1 shows four ways that water use could be arranged in a simple two-process system. A common 
way is (a), which might be necessary because neither Process 1 nor Process 2 has an output that is suitable 
in terms of water quality or volume for use in the other.
Arrangement (b) will be attractive when the water quality leaving Process 1 makes a suitable input for 
Process 2. The water quantities do not need to be identical; the Process 1 effluent could be augmented 
or diluted with fresh water, or a portion of it could bypass Process 2. The processes might be in the same 
industry or in neighboring industries, or they might be a municipal wastewater treatment plant and a 
cooling tower or irrigation system.
Figure 8.1 Arrangements for water reuse, regeneration, and recycle. 
It may be technically feasible to upgrade an effluent from one process for reuse in another. If so, the 
cost of regeneration will be weighed against the savings in fresh water and wastewater treatment cost. 
Arrangement (c) shows poor quality effluent from Process 1 being reused in Process 2 after regeneration, 
which might be to adjust the pH, or to remove dissolved salts, suspended solids, or an undesirable gas. 
An environmental system that has this same pattern is a wastewater effluent discharge to a river, which 
provides the regeneration, with subsequent withdrawal for irrigation or drinking water supply.

Panel (d) combines regeneration and recycle. Obviously there can be several combinations of these two 
strategies. This scheme could be used for two different industries, for example a power plant using high 
quality sewage effluent for cooling.
8.2	
Industrial Water Cycle
Industry uses water in the manufacturing process, and for cooling and heating, as shown in Figure 8.2. 
Figure 8.2 The industrial water cycle includes process water, cooling water, and steam for heating.
Boilers and cooling towers are recirculating systems. With each cycle of reuse some water is lost, by 
evaporation in cooling towers and by steam losses in boilers. The evaporated water and lost steam carry 
no salts with them so the salt concentration of the recirculating water increases. The salt concentration 
is controlled by removing a portion of the salt-laden circulating water and replacing it with fresh water. 
The water that is removed is cooling tower blowdown or boiler blowdown. The fresh water that is added 
is called makeup water. Makeup will equal blowdown plus other losses, including evaporation. Table 8.1 
indicates plausible quantities for three types of systems.

Cooling Towers
Cooling towers may be natural draft or forced draft. Both use evaporative cooling. Natural draft cooling 
towers are dependent on temperature gradients between air and water and the wind forces. Forced draft 
cooling towers use fans and blowers to circulate air and control the evaporation. The efficiency of natural 
draft towers is more variable over time and in general lower.
Figure 8.3 shows a recycle cooling water system. Water pumped from the tower basin is the cooling 
water routed through the process coolers and condensers in an industrial facility. The cool water absorbs 
heat from the hot processes that need to be cooled or condensed, and the absorbed heat warms the 
circulating water. 
The warm water returns to the top of the cooling tower and, as it trickles down the fill material in the 
tower, ambient air rises through the tower, either by natural draft or by forced draft. This causes a small 
amount of the water to be lost as drift (D) and a large amount to evaporate (E). The heat required to 
evaporate the water is derived from the water itself, which cools the water so it is ready to recirculate.

Figure 8.3 The water balance for a fan-induced forced draft cooling tower. M = BD + E + D
Evaporation removes heat from the circulating water, but it does not remove dissolved minerals. Drift, 
the uncontrolled blowing of water droplets from the tower, removes both water and minerals; it is 
functionally the same as blowdown. A new tower in good condition, with drift eliminators, loses about 
0.005% of the recirculating water via drift. 
Blowdown is the intentional, controlled removal of mineral-laden water from the cooling system. 
Blowdown is quantified by the term cycles of concentration or simply cycles. Cycles are equal to the ratio 
of make-up water volume to blowdown water volume, assuming that drift and spills are negligible.
Fresh water makeup (M) is supplied to replace evaporation loss, drift loss, and blowdown.
Figure 8.3 is the basis for the material balance on a wet, evaporative cooling tower system. The flow 
rates and concentrations are:
M = Makeup water (m³/h)
BD = Draw-off (blowdown) water (m³/h)
E = Evaporated water (m³/h)
D = Drift loss of water (m³/h)
TDSBD = Blowdown concentration of TDS (or chlorides) (ppm or mg/L)
TDSM = Makeup water concentration of TDS (or chlorides) (ppm or mg/L)
The water balance is:
	
M = E + D + BD
For convenience, drift is considered as part of the blowdown.
	
M = E + BD
Since the evaporated water (E) has no salts, the material balance on dissolved solids is simple. The 
dissolved solids entering with the makeup water must leave with the blowdown.
	
M × TDSM = BD × TDSBD

Water Conservation and Reuse
The average number of times the water is circulated through the cooling tower is the cycles of concentration, 
or simply cycles. If the mineral in the recirculating water were four times as concentrated as in the make-
up water, the tower would be running at 4 cycles.
Most cooling towers operate in the range of 3 to 7 cycles. This depends on the quality of the makeup 
water supply. Well water usually has high levels of dissolved solids. On the other hand New York City 
has a surface rainwater source that is low in minerals and cooling towers in that city are often able to 
operate at 7 or more cycles.
Municipal wastewater effluent, or other reclaimed water, has been used to replace a portion of the 
makeup water in cooling systems. 
Example 8.1 COOLING TOWER SYSTEM
An air conditioning cooling tower system uses 180m3/d of makeup water that is purchased from the city. Corrosion 
inhibitors and biocides are added and the makeup has a total dissolved solids (TDS) concentration of 500 mg/L. The 
blowdown has TDS = 3,000 mg/L. The makeup water will be changed to 50% city water plus 50% reclaimed water at 
1,800 mg/L TDS. The 50-50 mixture will have TDS = (1,800 mg/L + 500 mg/L)/2 = 1,150 mg/L.
The original water balance for 100% city water makeup is
	
E = Evaporation = 150 m3/d
	
BD = Blowdown = 30 m3/d (drift is included in the blowdown)
	
M = Makeup = 180 m3/d
	
Cycles = M/BD = 180/30 = 6     or     Cycles = TDSBD / TDSCity = 3,000/500 = 6
Operation with 50% reclaimed water has these characteristics
	
TDS of makeup water mixture = 1,150 mg/L
	
Cycles = 3,000/1,150 = 2.6
	
BD = E/(cycles – 1) = 150/1.6 = 94 m3/d
	
Makeup = E + BD = 150 + 94 = 244 m3/d
The new operation uses 122 m3/d reclaimed water plus 122 m3/d city water. This reduces city water purchases by 58 
m3/d, or 20,000 m3/y, a substantial savings.
8.4	
Process Water Reuse
The design goal is to move away from the wasteful approach shown in Figure 8.4, where water is used 
once and discarded. Reducing the intake of fresh water simultaneously reduces the output of wastewater, 
thus saving money at both ends of the system. This is not a process flow diagram; only the flow of water 
is being shown. The example is unrealistically simple because no water is lost or consumed.

‘Fresh water’ is a generic description of the supply that is available to service processes. It may be from 
a river (e.g. cooling water), a city water supply, a well, a water softening plant (boiler feed water), or a 
deionization plant (high purity water for electronics manufacture). A large industry may use ‘fresh water’ 
of different qualities in different sections of the plant.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Water Conservation and Reuse
If water quality requirements are ignored and only the quantity of water is considered, the water leaving 
Operations 1, 2 or 3 could supply the 5 T/h needed in Operation 4. The 40 T/h from Operation 3 could 
supply Operation 1, Operation 2, Operations 1 and 4, or Operations 2 and 4. The 30 T/h of effluent from 
Operation 2 could supply Operations 1 or 4. 
Some of these matches will not be feasible because of water quality requirements, but making the matches 
based on mass flow or volume flow is an interesting exercise.
Figures 8.5 shows two arrangements of water reuse that have a 60 T/h fresh water input and a 60 T/h 
wastewater output, which is 35 T/h less than the scheme in Figure 8.4. In one case, water from Operation 
3 is reused in Operations 2 and 4. In the other, water from Operations 2 and 4 is reused in Operation 
3. (There is at least one other arrangement that uses less water and we leave its discovery as an exercise 
for the reader.)
Figure 8.5 Two systems redesigned to incorporate water reuse with an almost 40% savings.

Water Reuse and Water Quality
Once-through water use can be reduced if one process can accept used effluent from another. Figure 
8.6(a) shows a once-through system that uses 100 T/h in Process A and 50 T/h in process B, for a total 
of 150 T/h of fresh water. Process B fully consumes the 50 T/h input. 
Process A can accept water with 100 ppm of pollutant (e.g., salts). It discharges water with 200 ppm 
pollutant. Process B can accept water with 200 ppm pollutant, so it can be supplied by the effluent from 
Process A. This scheme, shown in Figure 8.6(b), uses only 100 T/h and discharges half the amount 
of wastewater.

Water Conservation and Reuse
Figure 8.6 Once-through water use can be reduced if one process can accept used water from another.
The nearest neighbor rule is a simple way to match water sources and demands when pollutant level is 
an issue. The rule is:
•	 Satisfy a demand by using water from the neighbor sources that are nearest to the demand 
in terms of the pollutant concentration. 
•	 If a single preferred source cannot satisfy the demand, use all that is available from 
the preferred source and blend water from the next nearest neighbor to satisfy the 
remaining demand. 
•	 A source that is just cleaner and a source that is just dirtier than the demand are mixed to 
satisfy the demand.
Figure 8.7 shows a demand for 80 T/h of water that has a pollutant concentration not to exceed 50 ppm 
(CD ≤ 50 ppm). One possibility is to supply 80 T/h of fresh water, but the goal is to reuse water from 
sources 2 and 3, which have pollutant concentrations of C2 = 50 ppm and C3 = 100 ppm. 
The neighbor source that is nearest the demand specification is Source 2, which has a pollutant 
concentration C2 = 50 ppm, but it can supply only 60 T/h of the required 80 T/h. Adding 20 T/h fresh 
water give an 80 T/h supply with pollutant level 37.5 ppm, as shown in Figure 8.7(a). This leaves Q3 = 
20 T/h of the most highly polluted water going to wastewater.
A better option is to use Q2 = 60 T/h, Q3 = 10 T/h and Q1 = 10 T/h. This is the scheme in Figure 8.7(b). 
The mixture of Q1 + Q3 = 20 T/h has a concentration of 50 ppm and so does the mixture of Q1 + Q2 + 
Q3 = 80 T/h. This scheme uses less fresh water and discharges only 10 T/h of wastewater.

Mass Exchange Operations 
There is a class of processes that chemical engineers call mass-exchange operations. Mass-exchange 
operations have in common a transfer of mass from a rich stream to a lean stream. Figure 8.8 shows 
three examples of some substance being added or removed from water.

The slope of the line in the C vs. m plot, right-hand panel of Figure 8.9, is the inverse of the flow rate.
	
The flow rate of water determines the concentration of contaminant exiting from the operation. This is 
shown in Figure 8.10. Figure 8.10a shows the condition when the water flow rate is reduced, and the 
contaminant concentration at the outlet increases. Figure 8.10b shows the condition where the inlet 
concentration and flow rate are reduced, while maintaining the outlet concentration.

The Composite Mass-Concentration Curve
The system from Figure 8.4 will be used to illustrate these ideas (Foo, et al. 2006, Manan, et al. 2004). 
Information about the maximum allowable inlet concentrations, CIn, Max, and output concentrations, 
COut, are given in Table 8.2. The input concentration can be less, but not more, than the maximum 
concentration. The increase in mass across the process, Δm, is fixed and will be added to the mass that 
enters the process. 
Operation 1 has an input of fresh water (CIn = 0). The mass entering is 0 kg/h and the mass exiting is 2 
kg/h. The flow rate that will carry 2 kg/h at a concentration of 100 ppm is 20 T/h.

For Operation 2, the input of fresh water that will carry 6 kg/h with an output concentration of 200 ppm 
is 30 T/h. If the input has the maximum allowable concentration of 50 ppm, and an output concentration 
of 200 ppm, the flow rate must increase to 40 T/h. If the input concentration is somewhere between 
freshwater (C = 0 ppm) and the maximum allowed (50 ppm), the flow rate must be between 30 T/h 
and 40 T/hr.

The dashed arrows in Figure 8.11 show the mass-concentration diagrams for the four operations with 
fresh water input (CIn = 0 ppm) and at the outlet concentration determined by the mass transfer that 
occurs within the operation.
The maximum flow rates (blue arrows) corresponding to the maximum input concentrations can be used 
to construct the composite concentration curve shown in Figure 8.12(a). It is a composite curve because it 
collects the information for all operations into one graph. This curve gives a graphical solution for the 
minimum possible fresh water input.
These are the steps to construct the composite mass-concentration curve.
1.	 Order, from low to high, the operations on the basis of the maximum allowable input 
concentration.
2.	 For each operation, plot a line that covers the range (CIn, Max, COut) and Δm.
•	 The quantities of Δm accumulate on the horizontal axis. The lines for the 4 operations are 
shown with blue arrows from the input condition to the output condition. 
•	 Red horizontal dotted lines show the intervals of concentration and Δm for each 
operation. For this problem there are 5 concentration levels, 1–50 ppm, 50–100 ppm, 
100–200 ppm, 200–400 ppm, and 400–800 ppm.
3.	 The red arrows in Figure 8.12(b) go upward from one concentration level to the next to 
cover the full range of concentrations and the full range of the accumulated transported mass 
flow. They are constructed, starting with the lowest concentration interval, by drawing a line 
covering the range of concentrations in each interval and the range of mass flows from each 
operation active in that interval, and repeating this over all concentration intervals.
Thus for the first concentration interval (0–50 ppm), only Operation 1 is active, and the composite line 
goes from [0,0] to [1,50]. For the second interval (50–100ppm), Operations 1 and 2 are active and the 
composite line goes from [1,50] to [4,100]. For the third interval (100–200 ppm), Operations 2 and 
3 are active and the composite line goes from [4,100] to [~9.4, 200]. The process is repeated over all 
concentration intervals to get the complete composite concentration diagram in Figure 8.12(b).

Figure 8.13 Graphical solution of the composite mass-concentration curve for the minimum fresh water input of 47 T/h.
Figure 8.13 is the graphical solution for the minimum fresh water input. Draw a straight line from the 
origin to locate the vertex (intersection of two lines) with the largest mass flow that can be intersected 
without going above the mass-concentration composite curve. 
This vertex is called the pinch point. The location of the pinch point is important because the process 
does not require fresh water above this point. Water from elsewhere in the system can be reused above 
the pinch point. Therefore, the minimum water flow rate with water reuse is the flow rate required to 
reach the pinch point.

Water Conservation and Reuse
This line from the inlet concentration through the pinch point has a slope of 1/FMin, where FMin is the 
minimum flow rate with water reuse.
	
For this example the construction identifies the vertex at a mass flow rate of 9.4 T/h and a concentration 
of 200 ppm. The inverse slope of this line is the water flow rate
	
Figure 8.14 shows the implementation. The water requirement, when worked out more exactly than 
the graphical solution gives, is 47.14 T/h. Fresh water must supply Operation 1 because the input 
concentration is specified to be CIn = 0. The Operation 1 output, with concentration 100 ppm, can be 
diluted with fresh water to supply Operation 2, which accepts a pollutant level of 50 ppm. This means 
that Operation 1 is zero discharge and Operation 2 uses 50% less fresh water, both desirable outcomes.
Operation 3 can accept Operation 2 effluent when it is diluted with fresh water. 
Operation 4 can accept Operation 2 effluent directly to satisfy its water demand.

Figure 8.14 Water reuse scheme. Fresh water input = 47.14 T/h; Wastewater output = 47.14 T/h.  
Pollutant transferred in the four operation is ∆m = 20 kg/h; pollutant in the wastewater = 20 kg/h.

Conclusion
Recirculating systems, cooling towers for example, conserve water by increasing the cycles of reuse 
before discharge. The conservation efficiency is increased if once-used water from other sources, such 
a municipal wastewater treatment plants, can be used for makeup water.
An industry often can find opportunities to reduce the intake of fresh water by recycling used water 
from one process to another. The composite mass-concentration diagram is a tool for analyzing these 
possibilities. The examples in this chapter consider only a single contaminant. Extending the formal 
analysis to multiple contaminants is complicated, but the strategy of cascading water from process to 
process, so long as the water quality does not interfere with the processing, is sound.

The Design Problem
Designing systems to manage the flow of energy is much like designing systems to manage the flow of 
materials. In existing systems we can measure temperatures, electrical use, steam flow, and fuel burned 
and make a balance on the energy entering and leaving the system. The energy flow of systems on the 
drawing board (in the CAD system) cannot be measured, so it is calculated. Because energy is not lost, 
the amount entering a system or process equals the amount leaving. The energy balance is the designer’s 
counterpart to the material balance.
The energy balance is based on an empirical principle called the first law of thermodynamics, which 
states that heat and work are convertible. Energy in a system can change from one form to another (e.g., 
from mechanical to electrical), but the total amount of energy does not change. No exception to the 
first law has ever been observed so the energy balance principle applies to all natural and engineered 
processes and systems. 
Much of our concern with energy has to do with converting it from one form to another. Chemical energy 
in natural gas is converted to thermal energy in steam, which is converted to mechanical energy in a 
turbine, which is converted into electrical energy. Each conversion is inefficient, due in part to restrictions 
imposed by Nature and in part to technology. This needs to be understood to make predictions about 
how much heat can be obtained from burning different kinds of fuels, and how much useful energy can 
be obtained from machinery. 
The energy balance is used to answer such questions as:
•	 How much heat energy can be obtained from one ton of fuel oil?
•	 How much steam can be produced from one ton of fuel oil?
•	 How much electricity can be produced from one ton of fuel oil?
•	 How much energy is required to pump water into an elevated tank?
•	 How much heat energy can be recovered from the hot exhaust gas from a gas engine?
•	 Does a sludge digester produce enough biogas to heat the sludge that is fed to the digester?
In many problems the changes in energy are inconsequential, like the change in heat energy (temperature) 
of water as it flows through a settling tank, so an energy balance is not needed. The reverse is not true. 
Whenever an energy balance for a process is needed, material flow information will be needed, such as 
the mass of water converted to steam, the mass of oil entering a boiler, and the volume and mass rate 
of flow of flue gas and its components.

Accounting for Energy
For example, most energy and water conservation problems involve the flow of heat energy in water 
or steam that are used for heating and cooling. The simultaneous flow of heat and mass explains why 
reducing water use usually reduces energy use, and using less energy often allows a reduction in water. 
This and the following chapters deal with the law of conservation of energy and the basic principles 
of thermodynamics, but only in simple situations. We will be able to account for the flow of energy as 
materials flow through a processing system and to approximate the heat available from burning different 
fuels, including waste materials. More complicated problems are in the realm of the mechanical and 
chemical engineer. 
9.2	
Conservation of Energy – The First Law of Thermodynamics
There are many forms of energy: gravitational, kinetic, heat, elastic, electrical, chemical, radiant, nuclear, 
and mass energy. Energy can be changed into various forms, but a balance can always be made to account 
for it. This is the first law of thermodynamics – the principle of conservation of energy. 
“There is no known exception to the law of conservation of energy … It is not a description of a mechanism, 
or of anything concrete; it is just a strange fact that we can calculate some number and when we finish 
watching nature go through her tricks and calculate the number again, it is the same. (Feynman 1996).”

Accounting for Energy
The law of conservation of energy is analogous to the law of conservation of mass. The law of conservation 
of energy is the basis for an energy balance.
Figure 9.1 shows an enclosed volume or system over which the energy balance is to be made. We are 
not concerned with the internal details, only with the passage of energy across the system boundaries. 
Energy crossing the boundary may be associated with a mass of flowing material, or it can cross the 
boundary as the flow of heat, for example, transferred across the surface of a heat exchanger. Or, it 
could enter in the form of fuel that releases its energy upon combustion, or as chemicals that react to 
consume or release heat. 
Figure 9.1 All energy that enters an enclosed volume of the system must accumulate in or leave the system.
We will study energy balances that involve heating, cooling, and combustion processes that operate at 
constant pressure. In constant pressure processes the energy balance is analogous to the material balance, 
with enthalpy (kJ/kg or kJ/L) taking on the role of concentration (mg/kg or mg/L). If the process is not at 
constant pressure, vapors and gases expand and contract and a thermodynamic function called entropy 
must be used in the analysis. These processes are important but they will not be covered in this book. 
For the case where no energy accumulates within the process boundary, the energy balance is 
Total energy in = Total energy out 
Each term in the equation must have the same units (Joule, kWh, Btu, etc.).
Example 9.1 ENERGY RECOVERY IN INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINES
The chemical energy released from fuel that is burned in an internal combustion engine leaves the engine in these ways. 
	
Useful mechanical work	
30–38%
	
Hot jacket water	
	
20–26%
	
Hot lubricating oil	 	
2–8%
	
Hot exhaust gas	
	
30–37%
	
Radiation from metal parts	 1–10%
If the hot jacket water is passed through a radiator that cools the water by dumping heat to the air, the energy in the 
jacket water is wasted. In stationary installations such as engines that drive pumps, generators, compressors, it is possible 
to recover about 20 percent of the heat from the jacket water, about 13 percent from the exhaust, and perhaps some 
more from the hot lubricating oil, to bring the overall thermal efficiency from 30 – 38% up to the range of 50 to 70%.

Example 9.2 COMBINED HEAT AND POWER (CHP)
Combined Heat and Power (CHP), also called Cogeneration, is the generation of electricity plus the recovery of heat. A 
typical CHP system is 70–80% efficient, while the separate generation of electricity and heat has a combined efficiency 
of about 50%. The comparison is shown in Figure 9.2, where separate power generation and steam heating plants have a 
combined energy input of 100 + 47 = 147 units to produce 35 units of electricity and 40 units of heat. The cogeneration 
plant has an input of 100 units to produce the same amount of electricity and steam heat, and is thus 75% efficient.

The Heat Trap – The Second Law of Thermodynamics
The laws of thermodynamics are:
•	 First law: Energy can be changed into various forms, but the total amount of energy is 
unchanged and a balance can always be made to account for it. This is the principle of 
conservation of energy. 
•	 Second law: No machine is one hundred percent efficient in converting energy input into 
work output. It is impossible to devise a machine which working in a cycle shall produce no 
other effects than the extraction of heat from a reservoir and the performance of an equal 
amount of work. 
•	 Third law: It is impossible to reduce the temperature of a system to absolute zero in a finite 
number of steps.
The second law explains the efficiency, or lack of efficiency, of energy conversions in heat engines. A 
heat engine converts thermal energy to mechanical energy, as in a fossil fuel power plant or internal 
combustion engine. The application to heat engines is shown in Figure 9.3, in which heat energy (Qh) 
is withdrawn from a hot reservoir and converted into work (W) and waste heat (Qc). Work is energy 
which can in principle be quantitatively converted to the lifting of a weight. Heat is that part of total 
energy flow that is caused by a temperature difference. 
Figure 9.3 General heat engine.
The efficiency of the heat engine, ε, is the useful work produced per unit of energy withdrawn from the 
hot reservoir.
ε = W/Qh

The inefficient conversion of thermal energy is a consequence of the second law of thermodynamics and 
not of inept engineering. The thermodynamic limit of the heat engine is a heat trap that cannot be avoided 
in any energy conversion scheme that involves operations with thermal energy. No heat engine can be 
more efficient than the theoretical Carnot engine and the efficiency of the Carnot engine is determined 
by the temperatures of the hot and cold reservoirs, Th and Tc, measured in kelvins (K = °C + 273).
In theory the efficiency of a Carnot heat engine can be 100 percent only if the temperature reservoir to 
which heat is ejected is at absolute zero. (Scientists have been able to reach a temperature of 1 nanokelvin, 
which is one-billionth of a degree Kelvin. At this temperature it takes an atom half a minute to move 
one inch. The average temperature of the universe is 2.73 K.)
To improve the efficiency the temperature at which an engine receives its energy must be as high as 
possible and the temperature at which it rejects its waste heat must be as low as possible. The upper limit 
is determined by the endurance of materials of construction and is on the order of 600°C. The lower limit 
of the cold reservoir for most applications (power plants, automobiles, etc.) is the temperature of the 
surrounding air, land, or water, which is usually 10 to 20°C. These conditions give a Carnot efficiency of

Accounting for Energy
This describes a theoretical heat engine that must reject one-third of its energy as waste heat. Real engines 
reject as much as two-thirds of their input as waste heat. 
Any real device that converts heat into work must be less efficient than a Carnot engine that operates 
over the same temperature range:
 
Example 9.3 POWER PLANT WASTE HEAT
A thermal electric power plant, Figure 9.4, burns 1,000,000 kg /day of coal that has a heating value of 9.35 kWh/kg 
(33.66 MJ/kg). The thermal efficiencies of the boiler, turbine, and generator are 80%, 45%, and 98%, respectively. The 
losses are waste heat. 
Coal input = (1,000,000 kg/day coal)(9.35 kWh/kg) = 9,350,000 kWh (33,660,000 MJ)
Boiler efficiency = 80%
	
Energy transmitted to the turbine = (0.80)(9,350,000 kWh) = 7,480,000 kWh (26,930,000 MJ)
	
Energy lost with the exhaust gas = 1,870,000 kWh (6,730,000 MW)
Turbine efficiency = 45%
	
Energy transmitted to the generator = (0.45)(7,480,000) = 3,366,000 kWh (12,120,000 MJ)
	
Energy lost with cooling water = 4,114,000 kWh (14,810,000 MJ)
Generator efficiency = 98%
	
Energy produced = (0.98)(3,366,000) = 3,300,000 kWh (11,880,000 MJ)
	
Energy lost as waste heat = 66,000 kWh (240,000 MJ)
About 100(3,300,000/9,350,000) = 35.3 % of the energy input is converted to electricity. Almost two-thirds of the energy 
input is lost from the power plant to the environment, mostly by rejection to cooling water in the condensers. The waste 
heat absorbed by the cooling water is subsequently dissipated in the river or to the atmosphere via evaporation in a 
cooling tower.

Energy Units
The energy stored in water trapped behind a dam is called potential energy and is converted to kinetic 
energy as the water is released through the raceway of a hydroelectric plant. Kinetic energy is converted 
to mechanical energy by the water driven turbine and then to electric energy in a generator. The electric 
energy is converted to mechanical energy in electric motors, into chemical energy in charging batteries, 
and into heat for cooking and heating. The measurement units for these energy flows and transformations 
are varied because they involve units of force, mass, distance, time, and temperature. 
Energy is defined as the capacity to do work. In physical terms
Energy (work) = Force × Displacement
The Newton is that force which will give an acceleration of one meter per second per second to a mass 
of one kilogram. The Joule is the work done by a force of one Newton when its point of application is 
moved through a distance of one meter in the direction of the force. The Joule is used for the measurement 
of every kind of energy, including heat. The Newton-meter (N-m) and Joule (J) are identical in value. 
Mechanical work energy has units of N-m = Joule (J) or foot-pound (ft-lb). Heat energy may be Joule, 
British thermal unit (Btu), kilocalorie (kcal). 
Power is the rate of expending energy, or the rate of energy flow
Power = change in (or flow of) Energy per unit time
The Watt is the power experienced by an energy flow of one Joule per second. The Watt is used for the 
measurement of every kind of power. Power has units of J/s, = Watt (W), kilowatt (kW), ft-lb/sec, or 
horsepower (hp). Electric power is typically measured in kilowatts (kW) or megawatts (MW).
Mechanical power in the U.S. is normally reported as horsepower (hp), where 1 hp = 550 ft-lb/s = 0.7457 
kW = 2.685 MJ.
Finally, energy is often expressed as
Energy = (Power)(Time) 
which has units of Watt-second (W-s), kilowatt-hour (kWh) or horsepower-hour (hp-h)
9.5	
Arithmetic Equivalence of Energy Units
The arithmetic equivalence of energy units indicates how numerical values are converted from one set 
of units to another. It provides no useful information about the conversion of energy from one form to 
another. Table 9.1 lists some frequently needed energy and power equivalence factors.

Accounting for Energy
Most of the world measures energy in Joules and kilowatt-hours. The Joule is a small amount of energy. 
One Joule raises the temperature of 1 g of water by 0.239°C and it takes 4184 J to raise the temperature 
of 1 kg of water by 1°C. Also, 1 kWh = 3,600,000 J = 3,412 Btu. KiloJoules (kJ) or megaJoules (MJ) are 
more convenient units in most engineering problems. 
The most commonly used units in the U.S. are kWh, Btu, and horsepower. Horsepower is widely used 
to measure the mechanical power of a motor or engine. Btu is a convenient measure of energy when 
mass is measured in pounds (lb), as one Btu will raise the temperature of one pound of water by one 
degree Fahrenheit (°F). 
The examples in this book will use both metric units (Joules, Watt, °C) and Customary U.S. units 
(horsepower, Btu, °F).
Example 9.4 HEAT ENERGY AND ELECTRIC ENERGY
The energy released by burning one kilogram of West Virginia bituminous coal (4.5% ash, 1% S) is 33.66 x 106 J. The 
arithmetic equivalent of electrical energy, using 1 kWh= 3.6 x 106 J from Table 9.1 is
	
	
 (33.66 x 106 J)(1 kWh / 3.6 x 106 J) = 9.35 kWh
The heat energy released by the combustion of one kilogram of coal is arithmetically equivalent to the operation of a 
100 W light bulb for 93.5 hr. Unfortunately, the efficiency of converting coal to electrical energy is only about 35%. The 
amount of electricity delivered from the generator is closer to 3.3 kWh. Some of that is used in the power plant and 
some (about 6%) is lost in transmission from the plant to the consumer. Therefore, the more realistic yield from 1 kg of 
coal is enough electrical energy to operate a 100 W light bulb for less than 30 hours.
Example 9.5 WATER HEATING EFFICIENCY 
Water can be heated by burning natural gas for direct heating or by using natural gas to make electricity to heat a 
resistance element, as shown in Figure 9.5. In each case the end result is enough heat to warm 50 gallons of water from 
45°F to 160°F. Electrical heating consumes substantially more gas even though the efficiency of the electric heater is 
nearly 100 percent. The amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of water from 45°F to 160°F is 48,000 Btu. 
The 48,000 Btu input to the electric heater requires 150,000 Btu in the form of natural gas into the electric power plant. 
Delivering natural gas directly to the water heater consumes only 77,000 Btu of energy.

Energy Conversion Efficiency
Energy can be converted from one form to another, for example the chemical energy in natural gas 
can be converted to thermal energy to make steam, which can be converted to mechanical energy in a 
turbine-generator to make electrical energy. Each conversion degrades some energy to a form that is not 
useful. We say that this energy is ‘lost’ or ‘wasted’. (It is not lost. It still exists, but in some other form.) 
Figure 9.6 shows the energy conversion efficiencies of a variety of devices. New technologies, such as 
wind turbines, photovoltaic solar cells, etc., will become more efficient in the future.

Figure 9.7 Four traditional methods of converting energy into electricity:  
Hydro-turbine, Gas turbine, Nuclear energy, Fossil fuel combustion.
Figure 9.7 shows the four traditional methods of producing electricity. A hydro-turbine converts about 
75 percent of the potential energy of the passing water into electricity. 
A fossil fuel plant converts only 35–40% percent of the heat generated by burning fossil fuel into electrical 
energy. The conversion of chemical energy in coal to thermal energy in a large boiler is 88% efficient; 
the conversion of thermal energy into mechanical energy in a steam plant is about 45% efficient, and the 
conversion of mechanical energy into electricity by a generator is 98% efficient. The complete conversion 
of chemical energy to electric energy has an efficiency of (0.88)(0.45)(0.98) = 0.388, or 39%. About two-
thirds of the chemical energy stored in the coal is released to the environment, primarily as hot gases 
and cooling water. The laws of thermodynamics indicate that it is impossible to do much better than this.
A nuclear plant makes steam by controlled fission of Uranium 235. In nuclear reactors, an extra layer 
of protection against leaks is provided by the heat exchanger between the reactor and the steam-driven 
turbine. The cooling water for steam condensation does not contact the cooling fluid that has passed 
through the reactor.

Wind Energy
A wind turbine, Figure 9.8, operates 75–80% of the time and converts about 30% of the kinetic energy of 
wind to electric energy. The wind-driven rotor drives an electric generator. The available wind power is 
much greater than the rated efficiency of the wind turbine for several reasons. The velocity of the wind 
leaving the rotor cannot be zero so it is impossible to extract all of the wind energy. According to Betz’s 
Law no turbine can capture more than 59.3% of the kinetic wind energy. This could be achieved only 
with an ideal propeller operating at a very high rotor tip speed. 
If the incoming air has 100 units of energy (kinetic energy), about 40 units will be transferred into 
mechanical energy by the rotor blades. Friction in the brake and gearbox reduces the mechanical energy 
delivered to the generator to 35 units. The electrical output from the generator will be about 33 units 
and the final output is about 30 units, due to energy loss in voltage conversion and distribution.

Figure 9.8 Installation of wind turbines
Example 9.6 WIND ENERGY TO ELECTRICAL ENERGY
As of January, 2013, the world’s largest wind turbine, built by Vestas, has a rotor diameter of 164 m and a rated capacity 
of 10 MW (Wikipedia). Calculate the power for a wind velocity of 14 m/s and an air density of ρ = 1.2 kg/m3. 
The rotor swept area is 
	
A = πD2/4 = π(164 m)2/4 = 21,124 m2
The wind power is calculated using 
	
P = 0.5 ρ AV 3 
	
P = 0.5(1.2 kg/m3)(21,124 m2)(14 m/s)3 = 34.8 MW
The turbine can deliver about 30-35% of this total wind power as electricity, hence the rated capacity of  
10 MW.
9.7.2	
Solar Energy 
Insolation is the rate of solar energy arriving on a specific flat surface perpendicular to the line of the sun. 
The average rate of solar energy arriving at the outer edge of the earth’s atmosphere, before any losses 
is 1.366 kW/m2 (429 Btu/h-ft2). At sea level, the least possible loss is 29 to 30 percent. The maximum 
possible insolation is therefore about 70% of the incident value, or 0.956 kW/m2 (320 Btu/ft2-h). An 
actual solar collector will deliver a fraction of this, say 10–30%, depending on the technology used, the 
geographic location of the collector, and local conditions such as shade and snow cover. 
Solar heating of water is relatively simple. A solar absorber, usually a flat black surface with high 
absorbance, receives the radiant energy from the sun and converts it to heat. Water is warmed as it 
passes through the absorber.
Solar electric or photovoltaic cells convert sunlight directly into electricity. A 1 kW solar electric system 
will generate one kilowatt hour (1 kWh) of electricity after exposure to one hour of sunlight. In Wisconsin, 
an unshaded 1-kW panel, facing south and inclined between 25° and 50°, will generate about 1,200 kW 
per year. A 1-kW pole-mounted tracking panel that constantly faces the sun will generate about 1,600 
kWh/yr.

Example 9.7 PHOTOVOLTAIC CONVERSION OF SOLAR ENERGY TO ELECTRICAL ENERGY
Solar electric power will be installed in house that receives an average of 4 hours of sun per day to provide an output 
of 1,500 Watt-h/day (Wh/d). The wattage output is 80% of the collected solar energy, so the collection requirement is 
1,500/0.8 = 1,825 Wh/d. Divide the daily power requirement by the average of 4 h/d of sun to get the required system 
output of (1,875 Wh)/(4 h) = 470 W (rounded up). The proposed installation is four 120 W panels or eight 60 W panels. 
The Watt-peak (Wp) or kilowatt peak (kWp) is a standardized measure that excludes solar conditions. 
This must be translated into a kWh value that takes account of the solar conditions at the particular 
location of the solar collector. As a rough idea, a 1 kWp system will produce 1,800 kWh/year in Southern 
California and 850 kWh/year in Northern Germany. The average Wisconsin home consumes 8,500 kWh 
of electricity per year, which would require a 10 kWp system. 
The map in Figure 9.9 shows the average watt-hours per square meter per day (Wh/m2-d) available to 
a flat-plate solar collector in the United States. Figure 9.10 shows a NASA map of world solar energy 
potential (incident solar radiation or insolation), with units of kW/m2-year.
Figure 9.9 Map shows solar energy available on a flat-plate collector, measured in Watt-hours per square meter per day.

Conclusion
This chapter has introduced the concept of the energy balance, the units commonly used to measure 
energy and power, the efficiency of converting energy from one form to another, and a few ways of 
producing electricity.
The law of conservation of energy is analogous to the law of conservation of mass. The energy balance 
is analogous to the material balance. Furthermore, making an energy balance requires knowledge 
of the material balance in order to account for energy carried with materials as they move through 
the system. Understanding the conservation of energy guides design decisions that are effective in 
energy conservation.

The Energy Balance and Enthalpy
10	 The Energy Balance 
and Enthalpy
10.1	
The Design Problem
A method is needed to quantify the energy that is associated with the flow of a mass of material. Enthalpy 
is a measure of the amount of energy stored in material. This energy is stored in chemical bonds that 
hold a molecule together, by the internal forces that hold solids and liquids as a cohesive mass, by the 
random motion of molecules in a gas, and by other internal phenomena. The enthalpy changes during 
processing, as the temperature and form of material changes, and by computing the enthalpy change we 
can estimate the amount of energy consumed or generated.
Because Btu and °F are still widely used in the U.S., in contrast to the rest of the world, these units are 
used in some examples, while others will use metric units, and some examples will give both units. 
This should not confuse understanding of the underlying concepts and general methods for making 
the energy balance.
10.2	
Enthalpy
In a simple batch operation in which a mass of material is being changed from state 1 to state 2, the 
difference between the heat energy added to the material, and the mechanical work done on the material, is
	
	
Q – W = mH2 – mH1
	
where	Q = heat energy (kJ, Btu)
	
W = mechanical work (kJ, Btu) 
	
m = mass of material (kg, lb)
	
H1 and H2 = enthalpy of the material at states 1 and 2 (kJ/kg, Btu/lb)
The energy balance is
Each term must have the same units (e.g. kJ, Btu, or kWh).
The accounting for energy flow rates (kJ/m, kJ/h, Btu/h, or kW) is
where the units are kJ/min, kJ/h, BTU/h, or kW.

The Energy Balance and Enthalpy
It is not correct to speak of the heat content of a substance because from the thermodynamic point of 
view it is heat only when it is being transferred. Something is needed which is a property of the material 
and this is enthalpy. 
Enthalpy (H) is a thermodynamic quantity that is used to describe the change in heat energy when a 
material changes from one temperature to another. It cannot be detected directly and it has no absolute 
value. Only changes in enthalpy can be measured, and the change is calculated relative to some initial 
condition or standard reference condition, with units of kJ/kg, kJ/g-mol, Btu/lb, or Btu/lb-mol.
Enthalpy increases or decreases depending on the direction of the temperature change. If the enthalpy 
of a substance is known at different temperatures it is simple to calculate the heat required to bring the 
substance from one condition to another.
The change in enthalpy is referenced to an arbitrarily chosen standard state or reference state. At the 
standard state the enthalpy is assumed to be zero. For gases, 25°C (77°F) and 1 atm pressure is commonly 
used as the standard state, and will be used here. For steam the standard state is liquid water at 0°C 
(32°F). Obviously the choice of a standard state affects the number assigned to the enthalpy, but it does 
not affect the change in enthalpy for a given process. 
The enthalpy for liquids and solids depends on the temperature and mass of the material. The value 
of H for gases or vapor depends on pressure, temperature, and mass. This dependency (for gases) is a 
subject for a more advanced course.
10.3	
Specific Heat
Sensible heat effects are changes in temperature that can be sensed, say, by the touch of the hand, and 
for this reason the energy involved with temperature change is called sensible heat. 
The amount of sensible heat, Q, that must be added (or removed) to change mass m from temperature 
T1 to temperature T2 is
Q = cp m (T2 – T1)
where 	 cp is the specific heat (or heat capacity) of the substance. 
The specific heat of a substance is the amount of heat per unit mass required to raise its temperature by 
one degree. It is the basis of the definition of the Btu (British thermal unit) and the calorie. In the SI 
system of units, the calorie is rarely used, and has been largely replaced by the Joule.

The Energy Balance and Enthalpy
1 Btu will raise the temperature of 1 lb of water by 1°F
1 calorie will raise the temperature of 1 g of water by 1°C
4.184 kJ will raise the temperature of 1 kg of water by 1°C.
Thus, the specific heat of water is 1 Btu/lb°F, 1 cal/g°C, or 4.184 kJ/kg°C:
Derived quantities that specify heat capacity as an intensive property (independent of the size of the 
sample) are the molar heat capacity (heat capacity of a mole of pure substance) and the specific heat, 
which is the heat capacity per unit mass of material. The specific heat is sometimes called the heat capacity, 
cp, and is measured in units of J/g°C, kJ/kg°C, or Btu/lb°F. 
When substances melt, evaporate, or change from one crystalline phase to another, there is a heat 
effect known as the heat of fusion or heat of transition. Sometimes this heat effect is called latent heat to 
distinguish it from sensible heat. Latent heat is that required to cause a change in state with no change 
in temperature. 
The heat effect when a substance changes from a solid to a liquid or from a liquid to a vapor is the latent 
heat of fusion or latent heat of evaporation. The latent heats of fusion and evaporation are always positive. 
For pure substances this heat effect takes place at constant temperature; with mixtures the temperature 
changes. In calculating the enthalpy of a substance, the latent heat must be added if there is a change of phase.

The Energy Balance and Enthalpy
For example, water at 100°C (212°F) can be changed to steam by adding 2,257 kJ/kg (970 Btu/lb) of 
water. If this is done at constant pressure, the temperature of the steam is 100°C. Adding an amount of 
heat equal to the heat of vaporization (2,257 kJ/kg or 970 Btu/lb) changes the liquid to vapor but does 
not change the temperature. Likewise, changing 100°C steam to 100°C water requires the removal of 
2,257 kJ/kg (970 Btu/lb) of heat.
Because of the importance of steam for heating, its enthalpy has been calculated for various temperatures 
and pressures, based on liquid water at 0°C (32°F). Tables of the thermodynamic properties of steam list 
vapor pressure (usually absolute pressure), specific volume (ft3/lb or m3/kg) of liquid and vapor, enthalpy 
(Btu/lb or kJ/kg) of liquid and vapor, and entropy (Btu/lb°R or kJ/kg-K) of liquid and vapor. The boiling 
point of a liquid depends on the pressure. The heat of vaporization decreases as the pressure increases 
and therefore as the temperature increases. Appendix 5 gives some data for saturated water and steam. 
Table 10.1 gives the specific heat of air, water vapor and some common gases at different temperatures. 
The heat capacity of gases varies with pressure, but only slightly with temperature. The specific heat of 
air is about 1.00 kJ/kg°C (0.24 Btu/lb°F) from 0°C–260°C (0°F–500°F). Several other gases, with the 
notable exception of hydrogen, have a similar value. Water vapor has a higher specific heat, about 1.88 
kJ/kg°C (0.45 Btu/lb°F) over a wide range. All these values will increase if the gases are pressurized. 
Table 10.2 gives the specific heat and heat of vaporization of selected liquids. The specific heat for liquid 
organic chemicals is about 0.5 Btu/lb°F (2.1 kJ/kg°C). Water is the exceptional liquid, with a much higher 
specific heat.

Table 10.2 Specific heat and heat of vaporization for some liquids
Example 10.1 MAKING STEAM
Five thousand pounds per hour of water at 100°F is heated to make steam at 212°F and 1 atmosphere pressure. The 
amount of heat required will be calculated in two ways.
Method 1. Use the specific heat (1 Btu/lb-°F) and the latent heat of vaporization (970 Btu/lb)
Basis: m = 5,000 lb
•	
Heating the water from 100°F to 212°F requires
	
Q = mcp(T2 – T1) = (5000 lb/h)(1 Btu/lb°F)(212°F – 100°F) = 560,000 Btu/h
•	
Changing the 212°F water to 212°F steam requires
	
Q = mHv = (5000 lb/h)(970 Btu/lb) = 4,850,000 Btu/h
•	
The total heat required is
	
560,000 + 4,850,000 = 5,410,000 Btu/h
Method 2. Use enthalpy.
The amount of heat required is equal to the change in enthalpy of the incoming water and the exiting steam.
From Appendix 5
	
Enthalpy of liquid water at 100°F and 1 atm	
	
H1 = 67.97 Btu/lb 
	
Enthalpy of water vapor (steam) at 212°F and 1 atm 	
H2 = 1,150.4 Btu/lb
•	
Change in enthalpy and the total amount of heat required to make the steam 
	
Q = m(H1 – H2) = (5000 lb/h) (1,150.4 Btu/lb – 67.97 Btu/lb) = 5,412,000 Btu/h 
This answer is slightly different than the 5,410,000 Btu/h calculated by Method 1 because the enthalpy values from the 
steam tables are more precise than we calculate using a specific heat of 1.00 Btu/lb°F and a latent heat of 970 Btu/lb. 
The difference is not important in our understanding of the basic principles of making an energy balance.

Air saturated with water vapor air at 25°C, has a mass fraction water vapor of x = 0.0203 kg H2O/kg air. The enthalpy of 
dry air at T = 0°C is 0.0 kJ/kg.

The Energy Balance and Enthalpy
Example 10.4 HEAT RECOVERY
Steam that has been used in a process or a boiler is condensed and the condensate is used to heat air. The arrangement 
shown in Figure 10.1
The cooling water entering the condenser is 10°C. The steam entering the condenser is at 150°C. The system is designed 
to have 25°C cooling water leave the condenser. The condensate enters the heater at 80°C and leaves at 20°C. Calculate 
the amount of cooling water, X, that is needed and the amount of air, Y, that can be heated. 
There are two unknowns so two energy balance equations are needed. The possibilities are
1.	 energy balances on the condenser and on the heater
2.	 overall energy balance plus an energy balance on the condenser
3.	 overall energy balance plus an energy balance on the heater.
Ignore any loss of heat from the walls of the condenser, air heater, or piping.
Figure 10.1 Heating air with heat recovered from a steam condenser.
The enthalpies of water and steam are found in Appendix 5.
	
Water at 10°C 	
H = 42.02 kJ/kg
	
Water at 20°C 	
H = 83.92kJ/kg 
	
Water at 25°C 	
H = 104.84 kJ/kg
	
Water at 80°C 	
H = 334.95 kJ/kg
	
Steam at 150°C	
H = 2745.9 kJ/kg
The heat capacity of air, from Table 10.1, is cp = 0.24 Btu/lb°F = 1.005 kJ/kg°C
Energy balance on the condenser will give the cooling water flow rate, X
	
Enthalpy absorbed by water = enthalpy given up from steam
	
(X kg/h)(104.84 kJ/kg – 42.02 kJ/kg) = (100 kg/h)(2745.9 kJ/kg – 334.95 kJ/kg)
	
X = (100 kg/h)(2411 kJ/h)/(62.82 kJ/h) = 3,838 kg/h water
Energy balance on the heater will give the air flow rate, Y.
	
Enthalpy absorbed by air = enthalpy given up from condensate
	
(1.005 kJ/kg°C)(Y kg/h)(25°C – 15°C) = (100 kg/h)(334.95 kJ/kg – 83.92 kJ/kg))
	
Y = (25,103 kJ/h)/10.05 kJ/kg) = 2,498 kg/h air

The Energy Balance and Enthalpy
Example 10.5 CONDENSING ETHANOL
A flow of 1000 kg/h of Ethyl alcohol (ethanol) vapor at 78.3°C is to be condensed and cooled to 20°C. The boiling point 
of ethanol is 78.3°C so the vapor does not need additional cooling before condensation will occur. The latent heat of 
vaporization is 855.5 kJ/kg and this is the amount of heat that must be removed to accomplish the phase change from 
vapor to liquid. The specific heat of liquid ethanol is cP = 2.85 kJ/kg°C. Cooling water is available at 10°C.
Energy balance on ethanol:
	
(1000 kg/h)(2.85 kJ/kg °C)(78.3°C -20°C) + (1000 kg/h)(855.5 kJ/kg) = 166,155 kJ/h
Energy balance on water, assuming the water is heated to 65°C. ∆T is 65 – 10 = 55°C
	
(X kg/h)(65 -10°C)(4.187 kJ/kg °C) = 166.155 kJ/h
	
X = (166.155 kJ/h)/(65°C – 10°C)(4.187 kJ/kg) = 722 kg/h 
Example 10.6 POWER PLANT COOLING WATER
Consider the thermal electric power plant of Example 9.3. The plant discharges waste heat to cooling water that is used 
to condense the steam so it can be returned to the boiler after passing through the turbine. Calculate the amount of 
cooling water required for a once through cooling system if the increase in cooling water temperature is 15°C. 
From Figure 9.4, the waste heat that the cooling water must dissipate is 4.11 x 106 kWh. The mass of cooling water 
required to achieve this is
	
	
This volume of water (62.3 million gallons) would meet the daily water demand of a city of about 400,000 people, 
assuming 600 L/cap-day (150 gal/cap-d). A much smaller flow of water would be used in a recirculating cooling system.
10.4	
Cooling Tower Energy Balance
The material balance around a wet, evaporative cooling tower system in Figure 8.2 and Section 8.3 
explained how the evaporation that cools the recirculating water causes the salt content to increase 
with each cycle of use. This section uses an energy balance on the cooling tower to explain how the 
recirculating water is cooled by the evaporation. Figure 10.2 defines the variables.
Warm water, at temperature TWarm, is returned to the top of the cooling tower. An amount of water, E, 
evaporates as it falls or trickles down through the tower. The heat required to evaporate the water is 
derived from the water itself, which is cooled to the original water temperature, TCool, and the water is 
once again ready for cooling service.

Dry-bulb temperature (TDB) is the property of air that is most commonly used. When people refer to the 
air temperature, they are normally referring to its dry-bulb temperature. The wet-bulb temperature (TWB) 
is the lowest temperature that can be reached by evaporation of water only. Cooling towers can achieve 
water temperatures below the dry bulb temperature of the cooling air.

Figure 10.3 Definition of Range and Approach of a cooling tower.
Cooling towers are rated in terms of range and approach, as shown in Figure 10.3. The range is the 
temperature difference of the warm water entering the cooling tower and the cool water that is leaving. 
The approach is the difference in temperature between the cooled-water temperature and the entering-
air wet bulb temperature. It is impossible for the cooled water temperature to be less than the wet bulb 
temperature and uneconomical to approach it too closely.
Range = TWarm – TCool
Approach = TCool – TWB
where	
TWarm = inlet temperature of water to the tower (°C, °F)
TCool = outlet temperature of water from the tower (°C, °F)
TWB = wet bulb temperature of entering air (°C, °F)
The range is normally 6°C to 16°C (approx. 10–30°F). 
The approach is a good indicator of cooling tower performance. The lower the approach, the better the 
cooling tower performance. A larger cooling tower (that is, more air or more fill) will produce a closer 
approach (colder outlet water) for a given heat load, flow rate and entering air condition. The lower the 
wet-bulb temperature, which indicates either cool air, low humidity or a combination of the two, the 
lower the cooling tower can cool the water.
The cooling tower efficiency, ηCT, is defined by the temperatures shown in Figure 10.3 and is usually 
70–75%.
Cooling tower effectiveness is quantified by the ratio of the actual range to the ideal range, that is, the 
difference between cooling water inlet temperature and ambient wet-bulb temperature. It is defined in 
terms of percentage.

The Energy Balance and Enthalpy
The cooling capacity of a tower is the heat rejected in kJ/h or Btu/h.
where	
mCW = mass flow rate of water (kg/h, lb/h)
cP = specific heat of water (kJ/kg °C, Btu/lb °F)
TWarm = inlet temperature of water to the tower (°C, °F)
TCool = outlet temperature of water from the tower (°C, °F)
Air conditioning and refrigeration equipment capacity in the U.S. and much of North America is 
often specified in “tons” of refrigeration. Many manufacturers also specify Btu/h, especially for smaller 
equipment.
A ton of refrigeration (commonly abbreviated as TR) is a unit of power that describes the heat extraction 
capacity of cooling equipment. It is equivalent to the consumption of one ton (2000 lb) of ice per day 
and originated during the transition from stored natural ice to mechanical refrigeration. More precisely, 
it is the heat of fusion (144 Btu/lb or 333kJ/kg) absorbed by melting 1 ton (2,000 lb or 907 kg) of pure 
ice per day at 0°C (32°F). A ton of cooling is the removal of 12,000 Btu/h (3,517 W = 12,660 kJ/h = 
12.66 MJ/h) from water. 
TR = mHf = (2000 lb/day of ice)(144 Btu/lb)(d/24h) = 12,000 Btu/h
where Hf = heat of fusion
A mechanical chiller adds approximately 3,000 Btu/h (879 W or 3.165 MJ/h) of parasitic heat load. 
Therefore, a ton of cooling in a cooling tower is the removal of 15,000 Btu/h (4,396 W or 15.83 MJ/h). 
An absorption chiller generates 18,000 Btu of heat for each ton of chilled water produced. Thus a cooling 
tower for an absorption chiller must remove 30,000 Btu/h (8,792 W or 31.65 MJ/h).
From a simplified heat balance around the cooling tower, the energy required for evaporation must equal 
the energy supplied from cooling the circulating stream (as shown in Figure 10.2):
	
EHv = mCW cp ∆T or E = mCW cp∆T/Hv
where	
E	
= evaporation rate (lb/h or kg/h)
mCW	 = mass flow rate of circulating water (lb/h or kg/h)
HV	
= latent heat of vaporization of water (970 Btu/lb or 2260 kJ/kg)
ΔT	 = water temperature difference from tower top to tower bottom (°F or °C)
cp	
= specific heat of water (1 Btu/lb°F or 4.184 kJ/kg°C)

The Energy Balance and Enthalpy
Rule-of-thumb 1. One ton of cooling means that 15,000 Btu/h of heat must be removed from the water, 
and for a ∆T = 10°F, that requires a 3 gal/min flow of water (1 gal water = 8.34 lb).
15,000 Btu/h = mCW cp ∆T = mCW (1 Btu/lb-°F)(10°F)
mCW = (15,000 Btu/h)/(10 Btu/lb) = 1,500 lb/h = 25 lb/min = 3 gal/min
Rule of thumb 2. Removing 15,000 Btu/h requires evaporating 1.85 gal/h. Evaporation of 1 lb of water 
takes about 970 Btu of heat. 
15,000 Btu/h = (E) Hv = (E) (970 Btu/lb)
E = (15,000 Btu/h)/(970 Btu/lb) = 15.5 lb/h = 1.85 gal/h
Operating an absorption chiller requires the removal of twice the amount of heat and twice the amount 
of water must be evaporated.

Boiler Efficiency and Water Use
Water absorbs more heat for a given temperature rise than any other common inorganic substance. 
It expands 1600 times as it evaporates to form steam at atmospheric pressure. The steam is capable of 
carrying large quantities of heat. These unique properties of water, and its ready availability, make it an 
ideal raw material for heating and power generating processes.

All natural waters contain varying amounts of dissolved and suspended matter and dissolved gases the 
amount of minerals dissolved in water varies from 30 g/L in sea water to anything from 50 mg/L to 1500 
mg/L in fresh water supplies. Since water impurities cause boiler problems, careful consideration must 
be given to the quality of the water used for generating steam. Table 10.3 gives the American Society of 
Mechanical Engineers (ASME) guidelines for water quality in modern industrial water tube boilers for 
reliable continuous operation. 
The boiler feed water must be of such quality that it can be concentrated a reasonable number of times 
inside the boiler, without exceeding the tolerance limits of the particular boiler design. If the feed water 
does not meet these requirements it must be treated to remove impurities. The impurities need not be 
completely removed in all cases, however, since chemical treatment inside the boiler can effectively and 
economically counteract them.

Table10.3 Guidelines for water quality in modern industrial water tube boilers for reliable continuous operation. 
Boiler blowdown is the intentional removal of boiler water to control the level of total dissolved solids 
(TDS) in the boiler during the steam production. The blowdown material balance was covered in an 
example in Chapter 8. 
The blowdown rate of a boiler depends on
1)	 steam consumption (steam used in the process and not returned as condensate to the boiler)
2)	 concentration of impurities in the feed water, and 
3)	 maximum allowable TDS in the boiler. 
From the view of the boiler, feed water enters, steam and blowdown exit. The boiler adds fuel energy 
to the steam and blowdown that exit the boiler. Blowdown is expressed as a fraction of feedwater mass 
flow and can range from less than 1% to more than 10% depending on water chemistry, boiler operating 
pressure, and other factors. However, a 10% blowdown rate does not mean 10% energy loss because 
it is moderate-energy water and not high-energy steam. The energy added to the blowdown stream is 
blowdown flow rate times the difference in the enthalpy of the blowdown and the feedwater. Therefore, 
10% blowdown rate can translate into 5% fuel energy input. 
The fraction of energy loss associated with blowdown, LBD, is the heat energy lost divided by the fuel 
energy put into the boiler.
where	
LBD = loss due to blowdown (%)
mBD = mass flowrate of blowdown (lb/h)
mFuel = mass flow rate of fuel (lb/h)

HBD = enthalpy of blowdown (Btu/lb)
HFW = enthalpy of feedwater at saturation temperature (Btu/lb)
HHV = higher heating value of fuel (Btu/lb)

Conclusion 
The law of conservation of energy is analogous to the law of conservation of mass. The energy balance 
is analogous to the material balance. Furthermore, making an energy balance requires knowledge of the 
material balance in order to account for energy carried with materials as they move through the system. 
Enthalpy, H, is a thermodynamic quantity that is used to describe the change in heat energy when 
the temperature of a material changes from one temperature to another. Enthalpy cannot be detected 
directly and it has no absolute value. What can be measured is the change in enthalpy relative to some 
initial condition or to a standard reference condition. It is measured in units of kJ/kg, kJ/kg-mol, Btu/
lb, or Btu/lb-mol.

11.1	
The Design Problem
Conserving energy use usually conserves water use and that reduces the demand for waste treatment. 
This is a win-win-win situation.
One way to reduce energy use is to use more efficient devices to transform energy, e.g., buy high 
efficiency motors and pumps or install more efficient lighting systems. Another is to be more efficient 
in the exchange and recovery of heat by designing efficient heat exchanger networks. 
Energy can be recovered by transferring heat from a hot stream to a colder stream by means of a heat 
exchanger. The real significance of the second law is often directional, as well as quantitative. Even without 
calculations, the second law can give insights into the design of a process, or to the improvement of an 
existing design.

Figure 11.1. A simple energy integration system conserves energy.
Figure 11.1(a) shows a reactor that uses feedstock that is available at 20°C and a product stream that 
must be delivered at 25°C (to stop further reaction or to assist a following process). To improve the 
conversion in the reactor, the input is heated from 20°C to 150°C by adding steam in the amount of 708 
MJ. Chemical reactions inside the reactor release heat and the output leaves at 200°C. Cooling water is 
used to remove 729 MJ from the output stream. This wastes energy by dumping heat energy from the 
reactor into cooling water.

Figure 11.1(b) shows how the hot reactor output can be used to heat the input stream. In the heat 
exchange, the same 708 MJ provided by steam in the original design is transferred from the hot reactor 
output stream to the cold input stream. Cooling water use is four times smaller because only 187 MJ 
needs to be removed.
11.2	
Heat Exchangers
Heat exchangers are the essential element in energy system integration. Two incoming flows, which 
may be gas or liquid, are separated by a metal surface and heat moves across the surface from the 
warmer flow to the colder one. The internal geometry of the heat transfer surface, its material (corrosion 
resistance is important in most applications), and other construction details exist in many variations and 
combinations. These details will be overlooked in order to focus on how much heat can be exchanged 
and how heat exchangers are networked for energy recovery efficiency.
Figures 11.2 shows countercurrent and cocurrent flow through an idealized heat exchanger. The cost of 
a heat exchanger depends on the surface area across which the heat energy moves from the hot stream 
to the cold stream. The greater the temperature difference between the two streams, the faster heat is 
transferred and the smaller the heat exchanger can be. This is accomplished by having counter-current 
flow of the hot and cold streams.
In a co-current flow heat exchanger, the benefit of a large initial temperature difference is quickly lost 
as the two streams approach a common temperature mid-way between the temperatures of the entering 
hot and cold streams. In countercurrent flow, the exiting hot stream can be cooled to near the entering 
cold stream temperature and the exiting cold stream temperature can approach the incoming hot 
stream temperature. This gives a larger ‘average’ temperature difference and makes a countercurrent heat 
exchanger more efficient than the cocurrent design. 
The practical operating difference for effective heat exchange is ∆T = 5°C; working at a smaller ∆T wastes 
investment in the heat exchanger.

The general heat transfer equation for a heat exchanger is 
	
Q = U A ∆Tm
where	
Q is the amount of heat transferred (MJ/h, W, or Btu/h)
U is the overall heat transfer coefficient (MJ/h-m2°C, W/m2°C, or Btu/h-ft2°F)
A is the area of the heat transfer surface (m2 or ft2), and 
∆Tm is the log mean temperature difference (°C or °F) between the hot and cold streams. 
The log mean temperature difference, ∆Tm, is calculated using the temperature difference at the two ends 
of the heat exchanger for both concurrent or countercurrent flow, as shown in Figure 11.3. The larger 
difference is defined as Tmax and smaller difference is Tmin. The hot stream is identified by the subscript 
H, as in TH. Likewise the cold stream is labeled TC. Figure 11.4 is a graphical estimation of ∆Tm.
Tmax = maximum temperature diﬀerence  
             between hot and cold streams

The value of the overall heat transfer coefficient depends on the physical arrangement and material, and

Example 11.1 HEAT EXCHANGER AREA CALCULATION
A heat exchanger will transfer Q = 1,000 MJ/h and operates with U = 1.4 MJ/h-m2-°C. 
Countercurrent heat exchange
  
TH, In = 150°C	
TH, Out = 90°C
 
TC, Out = 80°C 	
TC, In = 30°C
Tmax = TH, In – TC, Out =150°C – 80°C = 70°C 
Tmin = TH, Out – TC, In = 90°C – 30°C = 60°C
Countercurrent heat exchange 
TH, In = 150 ⁰C	  
TH, Out = 90 ⁰C	  
TC, Out = 80 ⁰C	  
TC, In = 30 ⁰C	  
	
	
A = Q/U∆Tm = (1000 MJ/h)/(1.4 MJ/h-m2-°C)(64.9°C) = 11 m2
Cocurrent heat exchange
 
TH, In = 150°C	
TH, Out = 90°C
  
TC, In = 30°C TC, Out = 80°C 
Tmax = TH, In – TC, In =150°C – 30°C = 120°C 
Tmin = TH, Out – TC, Out = 90°C – 80°C = 10°C
Cocurrent heat exchange 
TH, In = 150 ⁰C	  
TH, Out = 90 ⁰C	  
TC, Out = 80 ⁰C	  
TC, In = 30 ⁰C	  
	
	
A = Q/U∆Tm = (1000 MJ/h)/(1.4 MJ/h-m2-°C)(44.4°C) = 16 m2
The cocurrent heat exchanger is 45% larger than the countercurrent exchanger that does the same work. 
Example 11.2 HEAT TRANSFER
Calculate the heat transfer surface area of a heat exchanger that must transfer 1000 Btu/min if the heat transfer 
coefficient is U = 25 Btu/h-ft2-°F. The temperature of the liquid to be cooled is 92°F at the inlet and the inlet cooling 
water temperature is 40°F. The temperatures of the exiting liquid and cooling water are 68°F and 52°F, respectively. 
Assume countercurrent flow of the liquid and the cooling water.
 
TH, In = 92°F	
TH, 
Out 
= 
68°F 
 
TC, Out = 52°F 	
TC, In = 40°F
Tmax = TH, In – TC, Out =92°F – 52°F = 40°F 
Tmin = TH, Out – TC, In = 68°F – 40°F = 28°F
Countercurrent heat exchange 
TH, In = 92 ⁰F	  
TH, Out = 68 ⁰F	  
TC, Out = 52 ⁰F	  
TC, In = 40 ⁰F

Example 11.3 ODOR CONTROL
A packinghouse rendering process vents 25,000 kg/h of steam at 2300 kJ/kg heat energy. Odorous compounds emitted 
with the steam can be removed by condensing the steam and cooling the condensed water below 70°C. A condenser 
with A = 420 m2 heat exchange area and a heat transfer coefficient U = 2,400 kJ/h-m2-°C can operate at a log mean 
temperature difference ∆Tm = 60°C.
The heat transferred in the heat exchanger is:
	
Condensing the steam to water (at 100°C) requires 2257kJ/kg, for a heat requirement of
	
The additional heat transferred cools the 100°C water to Tout
	
	
	
Tout = 100°C – 39°C = 61°C
Condensation will solve the odor problem.
11.3	
Heat Exchanger Networks (HENs)
A process may have several streams that need to be heated or cooled and the maximization of heat 
recovery requires that a network of heat exchangers should be used. This section shows what can be 
done with an intelligent arrangement, but without explaining the design strategy. 
Figure 11.5 shows a heat exchange network (HEN) with three heat exchangers (labeled 1, 2, and 3), two 
hot streams (H1 and H2) and two cold streams (C1 and C2). The relative mass flows are C1 = 1, C2 = 4, 
H1 = 2, and H2 = 3.
The objective is to achieve target temperatures for the hot and cold streams with the least use of steam or 
cold water. Table 11.1 shows initial and target stream temperatures, the heat to be added (+) or removed 
(–) and the ratio of the flow heat capacities (mcp) between the hot and cold streams. The sum of the 
required heat additions and removals is (2.5 + 33.0 – 16.5 – 22.5) = –3.5 MW.
A practical technical limitation is that the minimum temperature difference between a hot stream and 
a cold stream is 5°C. This limit is reached in exchanger number 2: the temperature difference is 10°C 
(172.5°C – 162.5°C). Steam provides 5.75 MW heat and cooling water removes 9.25 MW. Furthermore, an 
energy balance (first law of thermodynamics) requires that any heat added from steam be accompanied 
by a commensurate increase in cooling water duty. The use of 5.75 MW of steam in the proposed initial 
HEN requires 5.75 + 3.5 = 9.25 MW of cooling water.

Design Guideline
1.	 The larger the mass flow, the larger the opportunity to save (or waste) energy.
2.	 Minimize the mixing of streams with differences in temperature, pressure, or chemical composition.
3.	 Do not discard heat at high temperatures to the ambient, or to cooling water.
4.	 Do not heat refrigerated streams with hot streams or with cooling water.
5.	 When choosing streams for heat exchange, try to match streams where the final temperature of one is close 
to the initial temperature of the other.
6.	 When exchanging heat between two streams, the exchange is more efficient if the flow heat capacities of the 
streams are similar. If there is a big difference between the two, consider splitting the stream with the larger 
flow heat capacity.
7.	 Minimize the use of intermediate heat transfer fluids when exchanging heat between two streams.
8.	 Heat (or refrigeration) is more valuable when its temperature is farther from ambient.
9.	 Do not use excessively large or excessively small thermodynamic driving forces in process operations.
10.	The economic optimum ∆T at a heat exchanger decreases as the temperature decreases and, vice versa.
Table 11.2 Some Common Sense Second Law Guidelines (Sama 1995)
The guidelines in Table 11.2 identify three important design decisions and potential improvements in 
the network in Figure 11.4.

Energy Conservative Design
Guideline #5. The first heat exchange match for stream H1 (the hottest stream) at 245°C should be 
with C2, the cold stream that needs to be heated to the highest temperature, 215°C. For stream C2, this 
should be its final match before its need for heat from steam.
Guideline #6. The ratio of the flow heat capacity between streams H1 and C1 is 2, while that ratio 
between H2 and C1 is 6. This indicates that H1 should be used to heat C1 and that a match between 
stream H2 and C1 should be avoided. If a match between H2 and C1 cannot be avoided, the possibility 
of splitting stream H2 should be considered.
Guideline #3 says “Do not discard heat at high temperature to the ambient, or to cooling water.” In the 
original network, heat is discarded to cooling water from stream H1 at 172.5°C .

Improved networks for energy recovery are shown in Figure 11.6. The system in 11.6(a) reduces steam 
and cooling water by 43% and 27%, respectively, from the original design. In this network, stream 
C2, after cooling stream H2, is used to cool stream H1 first, as suggested by guidelines 5 and 6. Using 
guideline 3, stream C1 then further cools H1 to a lower temperature than the original design (147.5 vs. 
172.5) in heat exchanger 2. 
The network in 11.6(b), which is an optimal energy recovery scheme, requires only 2.5 MW of heat from 
steam and reduces steam and cooling water by 57% and 35%, respectively.

Pinch Analysis for Heat Exchanger Network Design
The use of a composite mass-concentration diagram to identify water reuse opportunities was outlined 
in Chapter 8. Pinch analysis is a similar method for analyzing efficient heat exchanger networks that uses 
a enthalpy-temperature diagram on which are plotted curves for the hot streams and the cold streams. 
Pinch analysis will find the most effective network, whereas the more intuitive analysis in the previous 
section may not, even in fairly small networks.
Heat exchanger network (HEN) design falls within the realm of chemical and mechanical engineers. 
Work on systematic design of networks was established years ago (Holman 1971, Linhoff & Hindmarsh 
1983, Rudd et al 1973). Later work has improved the methods and provided computer-aided design 
software and a vast literature can be found on-line.
Two freeware programs that use thermodynamic pinch analysis for heat exchanger network design are 
THEN (Knopf 2009) and HINT (Martin and Mato 2008). They integrate networks of heat exchangers, 
boilers, condensers and furnaces for best energy utilization. Grand composite curves (analogous to the 
mass-composite curve for water reuse system analysis) can be plotted to show the enthalpy of the process 
streams as a function of temperature. They also show the heat exchanger network design in a graphical 
form as a grid diagram for visualization of the network configuration.
11.5	
Conclusion
Recovery of heat within the processing system is essential for energy and water conservation. Heat that 
is removed to cooling water and dumped to the environment is wasted energy. The goal is to minimize 
this by designing efficient heat exchange networks.
Energy conservative design is important because heating and cooling are expensive. The pumps, heat 
exchangers, and cooling towers are expensive to maintain because of problems with scaling and corrosion. 
Countercurrent heat exchangers are the most efficient design because they have the highest average 
temperature difference and this translates to the minimum exchange surface area.

Combustion of Municipal Refuse and Biogas
12	 Combustion of Municipal Refuse 
and Biogas
12.1	
The Design Problem
When a waste material, such as municipal refuse or landfill gas, is considered as a fuel the design 
problems are to determine its composition so the pollution potential of the end products are known and 
to determine how much useful energy will be released so the economics can be calculated.
Combustion products may be completely harmless or harmful, and this is often determined by the 
combustion conditions. Carbon will burn to carbon monoxide (CO) or carbon dioxide (CO2). For many 
years we thought CO2 was harmless, but the increasing amount of CO2 in the atmosphere is causing 
climate change. Combustion can convert nitrogen to nitrous oxides (NOx), which are air pollutants and 
contribute to smog formation. Sulfur burns to form sulfur dioxide (SO2) and sulfate (SO4
2-).
12.2	
Combustion Stoichiometry
The simplest possible description of combustion is
C + O2  → CO2 + heat
The most important product is the heat. The basic combustion reactions for carbon and hydrogen are:
C + O2 → CO2 + 14,500 Btu for each pound of C
2H2 + O2 → 2H2O + 61,000 Btu for each pound of H2
The amount of heat released cannot be calculated from the stoichiometry but data are available on 
the heating value of liquids and solids that can be used as fuels. Section 12.4 is an introduction to the 
available data.
A combustible waste can be analyzed for carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and other elements. A simplified 
empirical formula of the main constituents of a dry material is CaHbOc and a generic reaction is
The end products are carbon dioxide (CO2), a greenhouse gas, and water vapor (H2O).
The stoichiometric equation must be balanced. That is, it must satisfy the law of conservation of mass. 
The stoichiometric coefficients (a, b, c) must take on values so that the number of atoms of C, H, and 
O are equal for reactants and products.

Combustion of Municipal Refuse and Biogas
All of the carbon goes to CO2 so a atoms of carbon in the fuel create a molecules of CO2. This requires 
2a atoms of oxygen. The hydrogen from the fuel forms water. Specifically, b atoms of H are used to create 
b/2 molecules of H2O. This requires b/2 atoms of oxygen. The stoichiometric coefficient for oxygen must 
make the number of atoms of oxygen on the reaction side equal the number of atoms on the products 
side. The atoms of oxygen coming from O2 is (2a+ b/2 –c). Each molecule of oxygen gas provides 2 
atoms of O and the coefficient is (2a+ b/2 –c)/ 2 = a + b/4 – c/2.
More directly, say the coefficient of O2 is x. The equation is balanced when
2x + c = 2a + b/2 and x = a + b/4 – c/2
Example 12.1 COMBUSTION OF ORGANICS 
An organic material consisting of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur has an empirical chemical formula Ca 
Hb Oc Nd Se. Write a balanced reaction for the complete combustion of this material.
	
	
	
Ca Hb Oc Nd Se + x O2 → a CO2 + (b/2 )H2O + d NO2 + e SO2
Balance the oxygen:	
2x + c = 2a + b/2 + 2d + 2e
	
	
	
x = a + b/4 – c/2 + d + e
	
	
	
Ca Hb Oc Nd Se + (a + b/4 – c/2 + d + e) O2 → a CO2 + (b/2) H2O + d NO2 + e SO2

Combustion of Municipal Refuse and Biogas
Example 12.2 COMBUSTION OF MUNICIPAL REFUSE
A dried municipal refuse has the following empirical chemical composition, C59H93O37N. Find the mass of oxygen required 
to completely combust 1000 kg/h of this material.
The balanced combustion reaction is
	
C59H93O37N + xO2 → a CO2 + (b/2) H2O + d NO2 
where 	
a =59, b = 93, c = 37, and d = 1
	
x = a + b/4 – c/2 + d = 59 + 93/4 – 37/2 + 1 = 64.75
Balanced reaction:	C59H93O37N + 64.75 O2 → 59 CO2 + 46.5 H2O + NO2
	
	
1,407 kg	       2,072 kg      2,596 kg  837 kg        46 kg
The stoichiometric oxygen requirement is
	
The mass of air that will supply this amount of oxygen, assuming air is 23.2% O2 by weight, is
	
mass of air = (1773 kg O2/h)/0.232 = 7,642 kg/h
Some excess air beyond the stoichiometric requirement will be needed to have complete combustion.
The convention for writing balanced stoichiometric equations is that non-reactive substances are not 
included. Some overlook this convention for combustion stoichiometry because air is always added to 
the process. Most of the oxygen in the air is consumed by the fuel oxidation, but there is some excess. 
The operating targets for some equipment include a percentage of oxygen in the exhaust gas to make 
sure combustion is complete. Including air in the stoichiometry links this percentage to the excess air 
that is provided.
For oxygen:	
	
For air (O2 + N2)	
The 3.76 factor for N2 comes from the ratio of nitrogen to oxygen in air. The volume fractions are 79% 
N2 and 21% O2. The molar fractions are the same, 79% and 21%, and 79/21 = 3.76. That is, 3.76 moles 
of nitrogen accompany each mole of oxygen in the air.
Once again it is required that c + 2d = 2a + b/2 and d = a + b/4 – c/2 and
This can be modified with a factor, βExAir, that accounts for excess air

Combustion of Municipal Refuse and Biogas
For 10% excess air βExAir = 1.1; for 25% excess air βExAir = 1.25.
Burning methane (CH4) in air is
CH4 + 2(O2 + 3.76 N2) → CO2 + 2 H2O + 7.52 N2
Burning methane with 10% excess air gives
CH4 + 1.1 [2(O2 + 3.76 N2)] → CO2 + 2 H2O + 0.2 O2 + 8.27 N2
The stoichiometric ratio is the ideal fuel ratio where all fuel and air are consumed without any excess 
left over. In practice, burning conditions are never ideal and more air than ideal must be supplied for 
complete combustion. The amount of air above the theoretical requirement is referred to as excess air. 
Insufficient air supply to the burner causes unburned fuel, soot, smoke, and carbon monoxide exhausts, 
and other problems that result in heat transfer surface fouling, pollution, lower combustion efficiency, 
flame instability and a potential for explosion. 
Boilers and high temperature process furnaces usually incorporate a modest amount of excess air, 
about 10 to 20% more than what is needed to burn the fuel completely. Power plant boilers normally 
run about 10 to 20 percent excess air. Natural gas-fired boilers may run as low as 5 percent excess air. 
Pulverized coal-fired boilers may run with 20 percent excess air. Gas turbines run very lean with up to 
300 percent excess air. 
The stoichiometric reaction does not show impurities and inert substances in the fuel, such as trace 
elements (i.e., Hg and Cl), moisture or ash. Trace elements (<1% of total by dry weight) may become 
gases, acids, fumes, or ash. 
If the fuel (CaHbOc) contains a few elements that form gases, such as N, or S, these will be liberated 
from the parent molecule and the combustion products will include SO2, SO3, NO2, NOx. Sulfuric acid 
(H2SO4) and nitric acid (HNO3) are formed when these products react with water vapor. 
Elements such as mercury (Hg), chlorine (Cl), fluorine (F), copper (Cu) can form toxic metal fumes 
(Hg and Cu) and acids (HCl and HF). Elements such as iron (Fe), phosphorus (P), calcium (Ca) do not 
form gases or fumes and they become part of the ash. 
Knowing the combustion products is important for selecting materials of construction to avoid corrosion, 
and in selecting additional air pollution control equipment to neutralize the acidic compounds. The 
chemistry of combustion is complicated by inefficiencies and side reactions. These complications are 
handled by specialists.

Composition of Solid Waste
The composition of residential, municipal, commercial, or industrial solid waste is highly variable with 
season, city, state and country. Even so, it is helpful to have an idea of the composition of the most 
common components in residential solid waste. This information is in Table 12.1. The percentages for 
carbon, hydrogen, etc. apply to the dry weight fraction of the solid waste component. Example 12.3 shows 
how these data are used to calculate the empirical stoichiometric formula for a mixed waste.

Example 12.3 EMPIRICAL STOICHIOMETRIC FORMULA FOR A MIXED SOLID WASTE
Large quantities of mixed solid waste are available as a fuel. A representative sample of the waste has this as-delivered 
(wet) composition: 40 kg paper, 10 kg cardboard, 15 kg plastics, and 10 kg wood. The moisture content for each 
component, given in Table 12.2, is used to calculate the kilograms of dry solids and water in the sample that are found 
in columns 5 and 6.
The elemental composition of each component is calculated using the percentages in Table 12.1.

Heating Value of Waste Materials
The production of municipal solid waste (MSW) in the U.S. in 2010 was about 225 million tons  
(2.25 × 1011 kg). The composition of this waste is about 13% inert material (metal, glass, etc.), 25% 
moisture, and 50% combustible paper, wood, rubber, and plastic. By definition, municipal solid waste 
does not include industrial, agricultural, medical wastes or sewage sludge.

Combustion of Municipal Refuse and Biogas
Water is a product of combustion. This water must be heated to the boiling point, vaporized, and the 
vapor must be heated to the temperature of the combustion gas. This consumes some of the heat released 
by the fuel. The net heating value is the amount of enthalpy (kJ/kg, Btu/lb) available after adjusting for 
water vapor produced during combustion. This value is sometimes called the lower heating value, to 
distinguish it from a higher heating value that would be available if water vapor were not involved. 
Example 12.4 REFUSE AS FUEL
A refuse processing plant shreds 980 T/d of raw refuse in a hammermill. Metals are removed at the rate of 74 T/d. The 
remaining 906 T/d of solid material is mixed with coal according to heating value in proportions of 10% refuse and 90% 
coal and burned in an electric generating plant boiler. The refuse heating value is 5000 Btu/lb and the coal heating value 
is 12,000 Btu/lb. In order to burn all the processed refuse, the total daily energy input to the boiler is:
	
Refuse:	 (906 T/d)(2000 lb/T)(5000 Btu/lb) = 9,060 x 106 Btu
	
Coal:	
(9 Btu coal/Btu refuse) (9060 x 106 Btu/d) = 81,540 x 106 Btu
	
Total: 	
 90,600 x 106 Btu
At 40% energy conversion, this should generate about
	
	
0.4(90,600 x 106 Btu)/(3412 Btu/kWh) = 10.6 x 106 kWh 
of electricity over a 24-h day. The energy from the refuse, accounts for ten percent of this total. The true energy yield of 
the refuse is lower because of the energy consumed in the shredding, sorting, and hauling.

Combustion of Municipal Refuse and Biogas
Example 12.6 UPGRADING THE FUEL VALUE OF SOLID WASTE
Figure 12.1 shows the material flow in a 30,000 kg/h (30 T/h) municipal solid waste (MSW) test processing facility. 
Ferrous metals are removed by magnetic separation before the waste is shredded. Air classification separates lighter 
and heavier particles. The lighter material, which has a high organic content, is further separated into three size fractions 
with a trommel screen. The trommel overflow (material larger than 100 mm) is the lightest and has the highest organic 
content. This is the most desirable material for sale to power plants as refuse derived fuel (RDF). The mid-size fraction 
(25–100 mm) also can be used as RDF.
 Figure 12.1 Municipal solid waste sorting process.
The RDF yield from a 30 T/h input is the two larger size fractions discharged from the trommel screen. That is
	
RDF = 7.2 T/h + 6.6 T/h = 13.8 T/h
The sorting has produced these changes from MSW to RDF:
•	
Plastics content increased from 26% in the MSW to 68% in the RDF, on a dry weight basis. 
•	
Food waste, metal, glass, and ceramics are almost zero in the trommel overflow. 
•	
Water content of the trommel overflow decreased to 40% from 51% in the air classifier feed. 
•	
Combustible content increased from 20% in the MSW to 29% in the RDF. 
•	
Sulfur content decreased from 0.8% to 0.05%.
•	
Chlorine content increased from 0.18% to 0.23% because plastics have been concentrated in the RDF. 
•	
Higher heat value increased from 2.65 kWh/kg in the MSW to 4.32 kWh/kg in the RDF.
The power requirement for the 30 T/h test facility was measured as:
	
Shredder = 825 kW		
Magnetic separator = 5 kW
	
Trommel screen = 12 kW	
Air classifier = 33 kW
	
Conveyors = 15 kW	
Cyclone = 65 kW (air pollution control)
Energy used to produce 13.8 T/h (13,800 kg/h) of RDF, assuming an 8-hour operating day, is approximately 
	
= (955 kW)(8 h) = 7,640 kWh 
Energy used per kg of RDF produced is
	
= (955 kW)(8 h)/(13,800 kg) = 0.554 kWh/kg of RDF produced. 
Energy content of the 13.8 T/d of RDF, assuming an 8-hour operating day and a fuel value of 4.32 kWh/kg
	
(13,800 kg/h)(8h)(4.32 kWh/kg) = 477,000 kWh 
Net energy output of the process = 477,000 kWh– 7,640 kWh = 469,360 kW
Net energy output per kg RDF produced = 4.32 kWh/kg – 0.554 kWh/kg = 3.765 kWh/kg
The energy used was less than 13% of the 4.32 kWh/kg fuel value of the RDF.

Combustion of Municipal Refuse and Biogas
12.5	
Incineration of Solid Waste and Sludge
Incineration is controlled combustion to reduce the volume and weight of waste. In Europe, most 
municipal refuse is incinerated. In the U.S. certain toxic chemicals and hospital wastes are incinerated, 
but municipal refuse generally is not, largely because the commonly held image of inefficient old-style 
systems, but also because of cost. New technology makes it possible to operate at higher temperatures 
with better control of combustion conditions. Also, new incinerators have highly efficient air pollution 
control systems. Burning wastes for heat recovery should be technically feasible in many situations. 
Economic feasibility is a separate question.
The heart of an incinerator system is the combustion chamber. The energy released by the combustion 
of the organics in the waste may not be sufficient to reach the desired reactor temperature, especially if 
the material is moist, and an auxiliary fuel such as natural gas must be added. Auxiliary air also may be 
needed to get complete combustion. 
Incineration produces bottom ash, slag, and fly ash. Depending on the methods used for air pollution 
control, there may also be wastewater from ash handling and flue gas scrubbing. 
12.6	
Energy Recovery from Landfill Gas
Biogas comes from anaerobic fermentation of organic compounds in municipal sludge digesters, 
agricultural manure digesters, anaerobic treatment of strong organic industrial wastes, and landfills. 
Biogas can be used directly or it can be converted to pipeline quality methane gas by removing most of 
the carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide. 
Natural gas has the highest energy/carbon ratio of any fossil fuel, and thus produces less carbon dioxide 
per unit of energy. The primary component of natural gas is methane (CH4), the lightest hydrocarbon 
molecule, but it may also contain ethane (C2H6), propane (C3H8), butane (C4H10) and other gases in 
lesser amounts. Combustion of one cubic meter of natural gas yields 38 MJ (10.6 kWh or 36,000 Btu).

Combustion of Municipal Refuse and Biogas
Example 12.7 CLEAN ENERGY
Natural gas is often touted as the ‘clean energy’ alternative to coal. Both fuels produce the same amount of CO2 per mass 
of carbon burned, but natural gas yields more energy per mass of CO2 produced.
Natural gas is about 95% methane and coal is about 95% carbon. For simplicity, use 100% carbon and methane as 
surrogates for coal and natural gas. The balanced chemical reactions and fuel values (from Table 12.1) are
	
Coal (carbon): C + O2 → CO2 		
	
	
and 9.61 kWh/kg Carbon
	
Natural gas (methane): CH4 + 2O2 → CO2 + 2 H2O 	
and 14.66 kWh/ kg CH4
Coal (carbon) combustion releases 44 kg CO2 for every 12 kg carbon burned, so the energy released is
	
(9.61 kWh/kg C) (12 kg C/44 kg CO2) = 2.62 kWh released/ kg CO2 produced
Natural gas (methane) combustion produces 44 kg CO2 for every 16 kg methane burned, so the energy released is
	
(14.66 kWh/kg CH4)(16 kg CH4/44 kg CO2) = 5.33 kWh released/kg CO2 produced
Natural gas combustion releases about twice the energy per mass CO2 produced and is, thus, the ‘cleaner’ of the two. 
Burning coal also has associated problems with sulfur and particulate emissions as well as disposal of ash (from the 5% 
or so of coal that is not carbon).
The U.S. EPA estimated that the approximately 6,000 landfills in the U.S. produce an estimated 13–18 
billion m3 (450–650 billion ft3) of methane annually.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Combustion of Municipal Refuse and Biogas
Methane gas has twenty times the global warming potential (GWP) of carbon dioxide, so collecting it 
for use as fuel is beneficial in terms of energy produced and reduction of green house gases. Just over 
half of landfill-produced CH4 is recovered and burned through flaring or electricity generation. The 
number of landfill gas projects using the methane gas from decomposing refuse went from 399 in 2005 
to 594 in 2011 (USEPA).

Figure12.2 Conceptual model of the development of methane production in a landfill.
Figure 12.2 is a conceptual model of the development of methane production in a landfill. When the refuse 
is first placed and covered, the gas within the buried material is essentially air (oxygen and nitrogen). 
Within a fairly short time the oxygen is consumed and the initial aerobic conditions turn anaerobic, the 
pH and moisture content become tolerable for the methane forming bacteria and fermentation starts to 
produce organic acids (acetic, etc.). The economically interesting phase has useful volumes of methane 
being produced continuously over a number of years. Finally, the organic substrate necessary for methane 
production is exhausted, the volume of gas produced and the methane content of the gas decline below 
useful levels. This phase is not shown in Figure 12.2. 
A simplified and very approximate reaction for landfill gas production, using C6H12O6 as an empirical 
‘refuse molecule’ is
C6H12O6 → 3CO2 + 3CH4
The predicted yield is 3 moles of CO2 and 3 moles of CH4. The mixture is, by volume percent, 50% 
methane and 50% carbon dioxide. Landfill gas from the productive phase is approximately 50% to 60% 
methane, with the remainder being mostly carbon dioxide. When the landfill is young or very old, the 
methane content may be only 10–20%.

Table 12.5 Fuel value of waste gases
In 1991, the USEPA identified 94 non-methane organic compounds (NMOCs), including toxic chemicals 
like benzene, toluene, chloroform, vinyl chloride, and carbon tetrachloride. At least 41 of the non-methane 
organic compounds contain chlorine, fluorine, or bromine. These compounds usually make up less than 
one percent of landfill gas but they cannot be neglected.

Combustion of Municipal Refuse and Biogas
Table 12.5 compares the composition of landfill gas with natural gas and a few other industrial waste gases.
Landfill gas can be managed by flaring (wasting by burning) or it can be used as fuel for boilers, internal 
combustion engines, gas turbines, or fuel cells. Methane can be converted to methyl alcohol, or it can be 
cleaned and piped to other industries or into natural gas lines. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) must be removed 
prior to most uses so sulfuric acid is not formed during combustion.
Example12.8 DIGESTER GAS (METHANE) FOR MICROTURBINE ELECTRICITY GENERATION
A Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources survey of methane use in wastewater treatment plants reports the 
following details for the Village of Grafton. Digester gas is to be used in a microturbine that will generate 30 kW at a 
digester gas feed rate of 13.13 ft3/min (0.374 m3/min). The microturbine will operate 90 percent of the time and has an 
O&M cost of $0.025/kWh. Electric energy is worth $0.08 kWh and recovered heat energy is worth $6 per million Btu. 
Considering only operating costs, calculate the payback time for installing a microturbine.
Total solids to digester = 1,714 kg/d (3,773 lb/d) 
Volatile solids fraction = 75%
Volatile Solids to digestion = 0.75(1,714 kg/d TS) = 1,286 kg/d VS (2,834 lb/d VS)
VSS reduction by digestion = 50%
VSS Destroyed = (0.5)(1,286 kg/d VS) = 643 kg/d VS destroyed (1,417 lb/d VS destroyed)
Digester gas yield factor = 0.93 m3/kg VS destroyed (15 ft3/lb VS destroyed)
Gas Production = (0.93 m3/kg VS destroyed)(643 kg/d VS destroyed) = 598 m3/d (21,100 ft3/d)
Methane production (gas = 70% methane) = (0.7)(598 m3/d) = 419 m3/d
Energy value of methane = (419 m3/d)(9.33 kWh/m3) = 3,909 kWh/d = 14,070,000 kJ/d (13,340,000 Btu/d)
Microturbine (Capstone C30 Biogas) power generating potential = 30 kW
Microturbine electricity generating potential = 720 kWh/d
Annual utilization at 90% = (0.9)(24 h/d)(365 d/y) = 7884 h/y (use 7900 h/y)
Value of electricity generated at 7,900 h/y and $0.08/kWh = (30 kW)(7,900 h/y)($0.08/kWh) = $18,960/y (use $ 19,000/y)
Heat recovered from the microturbine at 25% efficiency = (0.25)(14,070,000 kJ/d) = 3,518,000 kJ/d (3,334,000 Btu/d)
Value of heat recovered from the microturbine at 7,900 h/y utilization and $6/1,000,000 Btu
	
 = (3,334,000 Btu/d)(d/24h)(7,900 h/y)($6/1,000,000 Btu) = $6,584/y (use $6,600/y)
Annual O&M costs of operating a microturbine at $0.025/kWh = ($0.025/kWh)(30 kW)(7,900 h/y)= $5,925/y (use $5,900)
Microturbine purchase and installation = $140,000
Payback period = $140,000/($19,000 + $6,600 – 5,900) = $140,000/$19,700 = 7.1 years.
Example12.9 LANDFILL GAS
Gas will be collected from a landfill that receives the solid waste from a city of 200,000 people. Assuming 900 kg of 
refuse per year per person, the landfill has been receiving 180,000,000 kg/y, or about 500,000 kg/d. Each kg of municipal 
refuse put into a landfill yields 0.41 m3 of landfill gas that is about 50 percent methane and 50 percent carbon dioxide. 
The heating value of methane is about 50,000 kJ/kg, or 33.6 MJ/m3 (9.33 kWh/m3).
Expected gas production = (500,000 kg/d)(0.41 m3/kg) = 205,000 m3/day
Heating value of methane = 9.33 kWh/m3 
Landfill gas is approximately 50% methane
Approximate heating value of the landfill gas = 4.67 kWh/m3
Heating value of the gas produced is (205,000 m3/day )(4.67 kWh/m3) = 9.57 x 105 kWh/d

Combustion of Municipal Refuse and Biogas
Constant gas production increases the pressure within the landfill and causes lateral and vertical gas 
migration. Migration to the surface adds to the inventory of atmospheric greenhouses gases, which 
should be prevented. Landfills are capped with an impervious layer to reduce the entry of water. This 
also reduces the emission of gas. 
Lateral gas migration can cause environmental, hygiene, and security problems. Accidents have occurred 
when gas moved out of the landfill and into nearby buildings and houses. There have been explosions 
that destroyed property and killed people. 
The best way to control gas migration is extraction. The extracted gas needs to be burned in a flare or 
put to use as a fuel. Figure 12.3 shows the layout of a system for recycling landfill off-gas. Instead of 
using natural gas, a Dow chemical plant pipes methane from a local landfill to its manufacturing plant 
in Dalton, GA. The gas is used to generate steam for the manufacture of latex carpet backing. This site 
is expected to use approximately 169 million MJ (160 billion Btu) per year of landfill gas (the energy 
equivalent of 5.3 million liters of gasoline (1.4 million gallons).

hydrogen sulfide and other corrosive or harmful compounds and burned to produce heat or electricity. 
The landfill gas system for energy in Dalton, Georgia is shown in this diagram. (1) Landfill waste is 
structured. (2) Anaerobic bacteria decompose the municipal solid waste. (3) Methane off-gas is generated. 
(4) A system of pipes and blowers collects gas and delivers it to a central location. (5) Gas is used as fuel to

Energy Recovery from Anaerobic Sludge Digestion
Wastewater treatment plants use anaerobic sludge digestion to stabilize sludge that is highly offensive 
and unhealthful. Digestion makes the sludge easier to dewater so the volume can be reduced before 
composting, drying, or spreading on farmland. 
An important by-product of the digestion process is biogas, which is 50–70% methane and 30–50% 
carbon dioxide, with traces of hydrogen sulfide (1–3%), small amounts of nitrogen and hydrogen, and 
traces other gases (mercaptans, etc.). The gas is used to heat raw sludge as it enters the digester and to 
maintain the desired internal temperature of the digester, which is 35°C or 55°C, depending on the type 
of process that is used. Excess gas can be used to heat buildings, to fuel pump or blower engines, or to 
generate electricity.
The conventional mesophilic anaerobic sludge digester (MAD) operates at 35°C with a detention time of 
20–30 days and achieves 45–50% volatile solids reduction. Gas production is 0.8–1.1 m3/kg of volatile 
solids destroyed.

Combustion of Municipal Refuse and Biogas
Thermophilic anaerobic digestion (TAD) at a temperature of 55°C and a detention time of 20 days has been 
gaining favor over the traditional mesophilic process because it accomplishes more solids destruction, 
yields more biogas, greatly reduces pathogenic organisms in the sludge, and the digested sludge is more 
easily dewatered.
TAD and MAD can be combined to create a two-stage digestion process called temperature-phased 
anaerobic digestion (TPAD). 
Example 12.10 ENERGY BALANCE FOR MESOPHILIC ANAEROBIC DIGESTION
The three digestion systems are compared in Figure 12.4. In each case the digester feed is 1,000 m3/d = 1,000 T/d. The 
volume of the sludge leaving the digester is 1,000 m3/d, but the mass is less than 1,000 T/d because some volatile solids 
are converted to gas.
The sludge is 3% solids by weight and the volatile solids fraction is 0.7, giving 30,000 kg/d of total solids, 21,000 kg/d of 
volatile solids and 9,000 kg/d of fixed solids. The fixed solids pass through the digesters. The volatile solids are reduced 
by 40% or 50% as shown in Figure 12.4.
The assumed values for methane production and heating value are
	
Methane production = 0.7 m3 CH4/kg VS destroyed
	
Lower heating value of methane (CH4) = 0.037 GJ/m3
 The energy balances for the entering and exiting sludge streams are
	
	
Sludge heating requirement (GJ/d) = cp msludge ∆Theating
	
	
Heat recovery (GJ/d) = cp msludge ∆Trecovery
where 	
specific heat capacity of sludge = cp = 0.0042 GJ/T-°C
	
∆Theating	
applies to the sludge that is heated as it enters the digester
	
∆Trecovery	 applies to the digested sludge that flows through the heat exchanger
The overall energy balance summarized in Table 12.6 gives the energy value of the biogas, the energy requirement 
to heat the sludge, the heat energy recovered from the exiting warm sludge, and the heat losses through the walls, 
floor and cover of the digesters. The recovered energy is used to partially heat the feed sludge. Energy recovered from 
beneficial use of the methane gas is not included in the heat recovery values.

Figure 12.4 Three arrangements of anaerobic sludge digestion.
Heat is lost through the floor, cover, and walls of the digester in proportion to these areas and the difference 
between the ambient temperature of the air and earth and the temperature of the digester contents. They 
are small in comparison with the quantities of the energy balance so the details can be omitted. 
The energy loss from the thermophilic digester is larger than the mesophilic digester because the internal 
temperature is higher. This is based on an assumption that the wall, floor, and cover construction is the 
same for both kinds of digesters; that is, no special insulation was added for the thermophilic process.
Local conditions (air temperatures, sludge quality, etc.) do affect the energy balances and may cause the 
most favorable digestion arrangement to differ from place to place. The air and earth temperatures used 
were 10°C, which is appropriate for northern regions. Obviously higher temperatures would be more 
suitable in many parts of the world (Puchajda & Oleszkiewicz 2008).

raw sludge at 10°C heated to 30°C in a countercurrent heat exchanger, using digested sludge at 35°C as the heating 
fluid. A boiler raises the sludge temperature from 30°C to 35°C. A portion of the 216 GJ/d biogas energy is used in the

Biogas production = (8,400 kg/d VS destroyed)(0.7 m3 CH4/kg VS destroyed)(0.037 GJ/m3 CH4) = 218 GJ/d
Heat losses = 16 GJ/d 
(Note: Heat is lost through the floor, cover, and walls of the digester in proportion to these areas and the difference 
between the ambient temperature of the air and earth and the temperature of the digester contents. The loss is small 
in comparison with the quantities of the energy balance so the calculations are omitted.)

Conclusion
Materials once considered wastes are now seen as sources of useful energy. Municipal refuse has been 
used for fuel in boilers and power plants since the 1970s. Landfill gas is extracted and used for heating and 
power generation instead of being vented to the atmosphere and waste gas flares. Biogas from anaerobic 
wastewater treatment processes, in particular municipal and agricultural sludge digesters, allows many 
treatment facilities to be self-sufficient for heating with excess biogas energy for powering gas engines 
to run air blowers and pumps.

Thermal Incineration of Waste Gas
13	 Thermal Incineration of 
Waste Gas
13.1	
The Design Problem
Waste gases that contain solvents and other hazardous organic compounds are regulated under air 
pollution rules. There are several ways to remove organic chemicals from a gas, but it is also possible to 
recover energy by burning the organic material.
13.2	
Safety – The Explosive Limits
The workplace, ventilation systems, and the area around a thermal or catalytic incinerator are at risk of 
explosion if the concentration of volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) is too high. Before a fire or explosion 
can occur, fuel and oxygen (air) must exist in certain proportions, along with an ignition source, such as 
a spark or flame. The ratio of fuel and oxygen that is explosive varies with each combustible gas or vapor. 
The minimum concentration of a particular combustible gas or vapor necessary to support its combustion 
in air is defined as the Lower Explosive Limit (LEL). Below this LEL, the mixture is too lean to burn 
because there is not enough fuel value. 
The maximum concentration of a gas or vapor that will burn in air is defined as the Upper Explosive 
Limit (UEL). Above this level, the mixture is too rich to burn because there is not enough oxygen. The 
range between the LEL and UEL, shown in Figure 13.1, is the flammable range.
Figure 13.1 The lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) form nine common substances.  
The range between the LEL and the UEL is the explosive/flammable range. Below the LEL the mixture is too lean to burn  
(not enough fuel value). Above the UEL the mixture is too rich to burn (not enough oxygen).

Thermal Incineration of Waste Gas
Waste gases are usually dilute and that makes the LEL the important factor. Safety regulations limit 
VOC concentrations in an exhaust or vent stream to a fraction, typically 25%, of the Lower Explosive 
Limit (LEL). If the gas is a mixture of VOCs, the gas with the lowest VOC controls. Table 13.1 gives the 
limiting concentration for some commonly used VOCs and dusts.

Table 13.1 Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) concentrations corresponding to 25% of Lower Explosive Limits (LELs)
Dust clouds can be flammable and explosive. The lower explosive limits for some flammable dusts are 
given in Table 13.1. The most violent explosions are produced when the proportion of oxygen present 
is not far from that which will result in complete combustion. The range of explosive concentrations 
of a dust cloud is not simply a function of the chemical composition of the dust. The limits vary with 
the size and shape of the particles in the dust cloud, with smaller sizes generally being more dangerous.

Thermal Incineration of Waste Gas
Example 13.1 LOWER EXPLOSIVE LIMIT OF VOCS
Solvent vapors are drawn from workplace ventilation hoods at concentrations of 7,000 ppmv toluene and 7,500 ppmv 
acetone. The 25% LELs are 3,500 ppmv for toluene and 7,500 ppmv for acetone. For safety in the ventilation system, the 
waste air stream must be diluted with fresh air so the toluene concentration is 3,500 ppmv. This will double the volume 
of contaminated air that must be handled and double the size of the incinerator or any other process that is used to 
clean the gas. It will also increase the amount of fuel needed to heat the incoming air. The alternative is to somehow 
reduce the toluene concentration at the source.
13.3	
Thermal Incineration
Thermal incineration, sketched in Figure 13.2, is the combustion of gaseous mixtures in a refractory 
lined vessel that raises the temperature of the waste gas from its inlet temperature, about 20–35°C 
(approx. 68–100°F), to the required reactor temperature. The reactor temperature varies from 650–1100°C 
(1200–2000°F) for different compounds and is determined empirically to get sufficient destruction within 
the 1–5 second residence time of the combustion chamber.

The temperature required in the combustion chamber to get 99.99% destruction with a one second 
residence time is about 700°C for toluene and about 870°C for methyl chloride. Higher temperatures 
give faster oxidation and a higher degree of destruction. Longer residence times give a higher degree of 
destruction. The gas pre-heater is a heat exchanger that heats the inlet gas by recovering energy from 
the exiting hot gas.
The required volume of the combustion chamber and the residence time are calculated using the actual 
volumetric flow rate of the combustion gases.
	
Vchamber = (TR)(Factual)	
and	
TR = Vchamber / Factual
where	
Vchamber = volume of the combustion chamber (m3)
TR = residence time (sec)
Factual = actual volumetric flowrate of the waste gas (m3/s)

Thermal Incineration of Waste Gas
The necessary residence time depends on the chemicals that are incinerated and the operating conditions 
(temperature, turbulence, etc.). ‘Actual’ means the volume at the temperature in the combustion chamber. 
Since volume is proportional to the temperature, the gas volume is very large and the equipment may 
be surprisingly large to engineers who are accustomed to working with water.
The energy balance for the combustion chamber of a thermal incinerator is
13.4	
Catalytic Incineration of Waste Gases
Catalytic incineration, shown in Figure 13.3, is attractive for treating gaseous emissions when the organic 
concentration is in the range of 50 ppmv to 10,000 ppmv and the flow is less than 3,000 m3/min (about 
100,000 scfm). The catalyst increases the reaction rate, which allows the reactor temperature to be reduced. 
The waste stream is usually heated with auxiliary fuel, but it can be preheated by heat exchange with the 
incinerator’s effluent gas or some other process stream. The heated gas is then passed through the catalyst 
bed in which the reaction between the oxygen in the carrier air and the gaseous pollutants takes place. 
The typical minimum temperature at the catalyst bed inlet is about 320°C (600 °F) and the temperature 
at the catalyst bed outlet is 550–650°C, depending on the compounds being burned and the catalyst used.
Efficiency increases as the residence time increases and can reach 98 percent. Typical residence times 
are 0.05 to 0.25 second.
	
TR, empty = V/Factual
	
TR, actual = Vvoid /Factual
where	
TR, empty = empty-bed residence time (sec)
V = volume of the empty catalytic chamber (m3)
TR, actual = actual residence time (sec)
Vvoid = void volume of the catalytic bed (m3)
Factual = actual volumetric flowrate of the waste gas (m3/s)
Gases containing chlorine, sulfur, and certain other atoms can deactivate (poison) noble metal catalysts 
(e.g., platinum and palladium). Lead, arsenic, and phosphorous should be considered poisons for 
most oxidation catalysts, though if their concentration is low enough the catalyst deactivation rate 
is economically acceptable. Particulate matter, including aerosols, can also foul and inactivate a 
catalyst surface.

Case Study – Recovery of Heat from Combustion of Waste Gases
13.5.1	
The Problem
An industry proposes to destroy a mixture of waste gases in air and a liquid waste using thermal oxidation 
at 900°C with a 1 second residence time. Heat energy from the combustion will be used to generate 
steam (Straltz 1993). 
The liquid waste is 500 kg/h of pinene (C10H16), more commonly known as turpentine. The heating value 
of this waste is very high.

Thermal Incineration of Waste Gas
The waste gas is 3,100 normal cubic meters per hour (Nm3/h) that contains 2,962 Nm3/h of air and 138 
Nm3/h (243 kg/h) of odorous sulfur compounds and methane. Normal cubic meters per hour (Nm3/h) 
is the volumetric flow rate for gases at standard conditions: T = 0°C and 1 atm (101.325 kPa). 
13.5.2	
Stoichiometric Oxygen Requirement
A material balance on oxygen will determine whether the oxygen in the waste gas stream will meet 
the stoichiometric demand for combustion. The balanced combustion equations for the five waste gas 
components and the waste pinene are:
Methane	
	
CH4 + 2O2 → CO2 + 2H2O
Hydrogen sulfide	
H2S + 1.5O2 → H2O + SO2
Methyl mercaptan 	
CH3SH + 3O2 → CO2 + 2H2O + SO2
Dimethyl sulfide	
CH3SCH3 + 4.5O2 → 2CO2 + 3H2O + SO2
Dimethyl disulfide	
CH3S2CH3 + 5.5O2 → 2CO2 + 3H2O + 2SO2
Pinene (turpentine)	
C10H16+ 14O2 → 10CO2 + 8H2O
The balanced stoichiometric reaction for the combustion of methyl mercaptan (CH3SH) is
 
 
       $)34)02  Æ  CO2 )2O + SO2 
      Molar masses                      48           3(32)            44          2(18)        64 
 Mass flow rates (kg/h)         66.4           133               61            50          88 
The reaction shows that combustion of 48 kg/h of methyl mercaptan consumes 3(32) = 96 kg/h of oxygen 
and produces 44 kg/h carbon dioxide, 36 kg/h water, and 64 kg/h sulfur dioxide. 
The mass flow rate of methyl mercaptan in the waste gas is 66.4 kg/h and the actual quantities, obtained 
by simple proportion, are 133 kg/h O2, 61 kg/h CO2, 50 kg/h H2O, and 88 kg/h SO2. These values are 
shown below the reaction equation.
Table 13.2 is a summary of the volumetric and mass flow rates for the six waste inputs, the gaseous 
combustion products, and the stoichiometric oxygen requirements. 
The stoichiometric oxygen demands calculated using the balanced chemical reactions are given in Table 
13.2. The waste gas stream requires 598 kg/h and the pinene waste demands 1647 kg/h, for a total oxygen 
requirement of 2,245 kg/h. The air in the waste gas stream contains only 888 kg/h oxygen. An additional 
1356 kg/h is needed for stoichiometric combustion of all six compounds and this must come from an 
auxiliary blower supply.

Thermal Incineration of Waste Gas
The calculation of the additional air requirement is also in Table 13.2. In this calculation we assume a 
volumetric composition of blower air of 79.1% nitrogen and 20.9% oxygen. The corresponding mass 
flow rates are 76.9% nitrogen and 23.1% oxygen. For example, blower air containing 1361 kg/h oxygen 
must have a mass flow of 1361/0.231 = 5890 kg/h. The stoichiometric airflow contributes no oxygen to 
the output gas stream because all of the oxygen it carries is consumed by the combustion. The nitrogen 
output equals the nitrogen input because it is inert.
Normally a small amount of excess air (typically 10%) is added to insure complete oxidation. Before 
adding this in, the energy balance is checked to see if a larger volume is needed to control the combustion 
temperature at 900°C

The Energy Balance
The heat energy released by the combustion, taking CH3SH as an example is
Heat energy released (kJ/h) =(m)(HHV) = (66.4 kg/h)(23,518 kJ/kg) = 1,562,000 kJ/h
The heat energy increase in the output gas stream, using CO2 as an example is
Heat energy increase = m cP ∆T = (1965 kg/h)(1.2728 kJ/kg°C)(900°C – 25°C) = 2,189,000 kJ/h
The heat energy yield of the waste gas stream is 6,730,000 kJ/h. The pinene (C10H16) fuel releases 
an additional 22,349,000 kJ/h. The combined fuel energy of 29,079,000 kJ/h makes the process self-
supporting. Auxiliary fuel will not be needed. In fact, the pinene has so much heating value that careful 
control of its feed rate will be needed to avoid damage to the equipment. 
The very large heat energy release is summarized in Table 13.3.

There is more heat energy released in the inputs than is carried away by 900°C exhaust gases: (29,079,000 –

Thermal Incineration of Waste Gas
A fraction of the approximately 29,000MJ/h of energy generated in this combustion will be used to 
preheat the waste gas, as shown in Figure 13.3, and some can be used to generate steam and/or heat 
process flow streams for beneficial use elsewhere in the industrial plant.
13.5.4	
Combustion Chamber Volume
The volume of the combustion chamber is calculated using the actual volumetric gas flowrate through 
the combustion chamber. The combustion reaction is extremely fast and the gas temperature everywhere 
in the combustion chamber is 900°C. Therefore the actual gas flow through the incinerator is the total 
rate of carbon dioxide, water vapor, sulfur dioxide gas, oxygen and nitrogen, which is 20,989 Nm3/h = 
350 Nm3/min = 5.83 Nm3/s
The conversion from standard conditions (T = 0°C = 273K and 1 atm) to actual conditions (900°C and 
1.2 atm) is 
where 	   Factual = actual volumetric flow rate (m3/s)
T = temperature (K = 273 + °C)
P = pressure (atm)
Subscripts a and s indicate actual and standard conditions.

The Problem
Thermal oxidation will be investigated as a means of meeting a requirement of 98% volatile organic 
chemical destruction of a 20,000 scfm waste gas flow (standard cubic feet per minute; standard conditions 
are 77°F and 1 atm). The waste gas contains two volatile organic chemicals: 1000 ppmv benzene (BZ) 
and 1000 ppmv methyl chloride (MC).
The combustion chamber exhausts into a waste gas preheater so energy can be recovered. The desired 
thermal energy recovery efficiency is 70%. Figure 13.4 shows some of the known data and the calculated 
preheater temperature of 1150°F.

Thermal Incineration of Waste Gas
The lower explosive limits are LELBZ = 14,000 ppmv and LELMC = 82,500 ppmv. The VOC concentrations 
of 1000 ppmv do not present any risk of explosion or accidental fires in the ventilation system.
The concentration of benzene and methyl chloride are both 1,000 ppmv. The volume fractions are 
both 0.1%.
volume fraction = 100(1000 volumes of Benzene)/(1,000,000 volumes of gas) = 0.1%
The gas composition is
Volume fractions:	
0.1% benzene	
0.1% methyl chloride	
99.8% air
The heating values are 3,475 Btu/scf benzene and 705 Btu/scf methyl chloride. 
Thus the heating value of the waste gas is (3,475 + 705)(0.001) = 4.18 Btu/scf
Methane (CH4) will be used as an auxiliary fuel. It has a heating value of 877.3 Btu/scf. The amount will 
be calculated by making an energy balance on the combustion chamber.
13.6.2	
The Thermal Recovery Efficiency
The energy balance, shown in Figure 13.5, defines the thermal recovery efficiency (TRE) and shows that 
the preheater exit temperature of 1150°F will give the desired 70% efficiency. The temperature in the 
preheater cannot rise too close to the ignition temperature and it cannot drop below the acid dew point.

Thermal Incineration of Waste Gas
The maximum possible heat transfer at 100% efficiency would be when the exiting flue gas (being 
cooled) and the exiting waste gas (being heated) reach the same temperature. This condition is physically 
impossible to achieve. It is, however, a convenient simplification for making the calculation and Figure 13.5 
shows the cooled flue gas and the preheated waste gas with the same temperature of 1150°F.
The actual heat transfer to the waste gas is:
The maximum possible heat transfer is:

Overall Energy Balance and the Methane Fuel Requirement
Figure 13.6 Definition diagram for the energy balance on the combustion chamber to calculate the fuel 
requirement. F denotes a volumetric flow rate (scfm).
The overall energy balance for the combustion chamber is
where 	
QFG = sensible heat flow in the flue gas (Btu/min)
HWG = heat supplied by combustion of benzene and methyl chloride (Btu/min)
HFuel = heat supplied by the methane fuel (Btu/min)
Subscripts indicate waste gas (WG), flue gas (FG), and fuel (F)
The heat loss (HLoss) is assumed as 10% of the heat energy in the combustion chamber flue gas, so the 
energy balance simplifies to
The quantities are
HWG = (20,000 scfm)(4.18 Btu/scf) = 83,600 Btu/min
HFuel = (FFuel scfm)(877.3 Btu/scf) = 877.3FFuel Btu/min
QFG = (20,000)(0.0739 lb/scf)(0.255 Btu/lb°F)(1600°F – 1150°F) 
	
 + (FFuel)(0.0739 lb/scf)(0.255 Btu/lb°F)(1600°F – 77°F) 
	
= 169,600 + 28.7FFuel
HLoss = 0.1QFG = 16,960 + 2.87FFuel 
where 	
FFuel = volumetric flow rate (scfm) of methane and other variables are as defined above.

Thermal Incineration of Waste Gas
These values are used in the energy balance equation 
83,600 + 877.3FFuel = 169,600 + 28.7FFuel + 16,960 + 2.87FFuel
FFuel = 102,960/845.7 = 122 scfm
Without heat recovery about five times more methane fuel would need to be added to raise the temperature 
of the waste gas from 100°F to 1600°F. The reader may wish to calculate the savings as a practice exercise.
13.6.4	
Power and Electricity Costs
The power needed for the fan to move the gas through the incinerator is
where 	
FWG is the flow rate (acfm) of the waste gas input to the incinerator
∆P is the pressure drop (inches of water) through the system
η is the combined efficiency of the motor and fan
Typically η = 0.4–0.7. The total pressure drop depends on the equipment elements and the details of 
the installation.

Thermal Incineration of Waste Gas
Example 13.2 POWER REQUIREMENT AND ELECTRICITY COST
Calculate the power requirement of fan that will move FWG = 30,000 acfm through an incinerator system that has a 
pressure drop of 19 inches of water. The efficiency is 60%.
	
The cost of electricity, assuming 8,000 hours of operation per year and a cost of $0.07/kWh is
	
Electricity cost ($/yr) = (111.1 kW)(8,000 h/yr)($0.07 kWh) = $62,200
13.6.5	
A Preliminary Cost Estimate
These design calculations are sufficient for making preliminary cost estimates in the early stages of a 
project evaluation. The accuracy of these estimates is ±30%. Preliminary cost estimates start with the 
purchased equipment costs (EC) of the major equipment, in this case a recuperative thermal incinerator. 
Other costs are estimated as percentages of the EC.
Example 13.3 ECONOMY OF SCALE
The cost of two units of different capacities can be compared using
	
	
The exponent (0.25) is a measure of the economy of scale. It is the slope of the line in the log-log graph, Figure 13.7. 
For 	
	
 
 
 
 
 
 20.25 = 1.19
The economy-of-scale for this equipment is impressive. Doubling the size of the unit causes a modest (<20%) increase 
in the cost.
The cost estimating equations given below for recuperative thermal incinerator equipment (Vatavuk 
2002) were used to make Figure 13.7. The cost estimates are in 1999 US dollars.

Conclusion
Ventilation air and waste gases from industries and a variety of manufacturing processes contain regulated 
organic chemicals, usually solvents. The first option is source control – change the manufacturing process 
to eliminate the emission or to substitute a non-toxic chemical or an unregulated solvent. When the 
contaminated air/gas stream cannot be eliminated at the source, the contaminant must be removed 
or destroyed. 
Removal of organic chemicals can be accomplished by adsorption, for example onto activated carbon. 
This may allow for solvents to be recovered for sale or reuse.
Destruction is usually accomplished by incineration or catalytic oxidation. This removes the option of 
recovering solvent or some other organic chemicals, but instead heat energy can be recovered.

Energy Consumption by Pumping
14	 Energy Consumption 
by Pumping
14.1	
Water and Energy
Water and energy share a critical interdependency. It takes energy to treat, pump and prepare water for 
end-use, and water is needed to produce electricity and liquid fuels. Success in conserving water almost 
always conserves energy, and vice versa.
Pumping systems account for nearly 20% of the world’s energy use by electric motors and 25-50% of the 
total electrical usage in certain industrial facilities. Energy used in pumping, treating, delivering, and 
preparing water for end uses accounts for about 13% of the U.S. total annual energy consumption. Each 
pump installation will provide an opportunity to either waste energy or save energy.
Discharge 
Intak
Impeller 
Figure 14.1 Single-stage radial centrifugal pump (Source: Wikipedia)
There are many kinds of pumps (Wikipedia has an animated catalog of pump types.) Most pumps used 
for water are centrifugal pumps, such as shown in Figure 14.1. The cutaway shows an impeller (the disk 
with red vanes) that will be rotated by the drive motor. The quantity of water discharged depends on 
the diameter of the impeller (the size of an impeller in a pump can be changed), the speed of rotation, 
and the shape of the impeller. 
14.2	
Pump Efficiency
The efficiency of any machine refers to how well it can convert one form of energy into another. The 
efficiency is 50% if one unit of energy supplied to a machine yields an output of one-half unit.

Pollution Prevention and Control: Part II

Energy Consumption by Pumping
Pumping systems involve two extremely simple, yet efficient machines – the centrifugal pump and the AC 
induction motor. The centrifugal pump converts mechanical energy into hydraulic energy (flow, velocity, 
and pressure) and the AC motor converts electrical energy into mechanical energy. Many medium and 
larger centrifugal pumps operate at 75–90% efficiency and even smaller ones usually fall into the 50–70% 
range. Large AC motors, on the other hand, can approach an efficiency of 97% and any motor, five hp 
(4 kW) and above, can be designed to break the 90% barrier.
Most pumps will operate at peak efficiency only intermittently because the discharge is frequently 
changing, and the pipe networks change over time either by aging or by intentional modifications. The 
pumps themselves may be poorly maintained so they drift away from optimal performance.
A well-maintained centrifugal pump can provide excellent service for 30 years. A pump that is abused 
or poorly maintained will need replacement in a much shorter time, as suggested by Figure 14.2.

The Pump Curve and Efficiency Curve
Pressure is the resistance a pump works against. It is measured as kPa, kg/m2, or lb/ft2.
Pressure = (water density) (water depth)
P = ρd
A water depth of 2 m is equivalent to
P (kg/m2) = (1000 kg/m3)(2 m) = 2000 kg/m2 = 0.2 kg/cm2
A water depth of 2 ft is equivalent to 
P (lb/ft2) = (62.4 lb/ft3)(2 ft) = 124.8 lb/ft2 = 0.867 lb/in2

259 
Energy Consumption by Pumping
Another common term for this resistance – curious term called head (h) – needs to be defined. Head is 
pressure expressed as an equivalent water depth and it is measured in meters or feet. This is convenient 
because the main job of a pump is to lift water, and it is natural to think of the lift as so many meters 
or feet.
Pressure and head measure the same quantity, but in different units; they are interchangeable. 
Other equivalencies are:
1 atmosphere of pressure =14.7 lb/in2 = 2,116 lb/ft2 = 10,330 kg/m2 = 101.35 kPa
1 atmosphere of pressure = 33.9 ft = 10.33 m of water
A water depth of 1 m = 1,000 kg/m2 = 9.807 kPa
A water depth of 1 foot = 62.4 lb/ft2 = 0.433 lb/in2 (psi)
The pump curve and the efficiency curve are characteristics of the pump: the type of pump, the diameter 
of the pump impellor, and the speed of rotation. Figure 14.3 is a pump curve for a centrifugal pump. As 
the operating head, or the pumping resistance, increases the pump discharge decreases.

determined by type of pump, pump speed, and type of pump impeller. The system curve is 
quadratic with flow. The duty point is at the intersection of the curves. If the duty point is at the 
peak efficiency it is called the best efficiency point. This curve shows a correspondence of the 
duty point and best efficiency point (85% efficiency) at flow Q = 15 L/s and total head h = 42 m.
The system curve shows the operating head as a function of the discharge. It is defined by the system of 
piping, valves, filters, heat exchangers, and other devices the through which the fluid must be pumped. 
The upward curving shape is because the friction resistance increases as the flow increases.
The height to which a fluid must be lifted is called the static head. This is the value of the system curve 
at Q = 0. If a pipe from the pump discharge were directed straight up the pump could lift the fluid to 
some height and no higher. That height is the shut-off head – the head at a flow of zero.
The resistance to flow caused by the pipe, fittings, and devices is proportional to the kinetic energy of the 
fluid, v2/2g. For a fixed pipe diameter (D), the velocity increases with the discharge: Q = vA = vπD2/4 
and v = 4Q/πD2. When this quantity is expressed in meters (or feet) it is called the velocity head. 
The duty point is at the intersection of the pump curve and the system curve. If the duty point is at the 
peak efficiency it is called the best efficiency point. This curve shows a correspondence of the duty point 
and best efficiency point at flow Q= 15 L/s and total head H= 42 m. The design flow is usually at the 
best efficiency point, although the flow under actual operation may be more or less.

Figure 14.4 If the discharge is shifted from 15 L/s to 8 L/s the pump efficiency drops from 85% to 64%.
Operating away from the best efficiency point increases operating costs and stress on the pump. Figure 
14.4 shows that the pump efficiency drops from 85% to 64% when the discharge shifts from 15 L/s to 8 
L/s. This shift could be caused by closing a valve to reduce the flow, or it might be caused by blockage 
or severe corrosion in a pipe. 
If the normal operating point were to be changed from 15 L/s to 8 L/s, the pump should be changed, the 
pump impeller should be changed, or the operating speed should be changed. The reasons go beyond the 
efficiency of energy use. Continuous running below the best efficiency point will reduce the life of bearings, 
seals, and impellers. (Running above the best efficiency point carries similar risks to the equipment.)
A variable speed pump might be a better solution when the discharge needs to fluctuate to meet changing 
conditions. Changing the speed essentially produces a new pump curve with a higher efficiency. Another 
possibility is to install two pumps of different capacities so each could operate at its peak efficiency.

Power Requirements
The power required depends on the efficiency of the drive motor and the pump. The power delivered 
by the pump to the fluid is 
Power in horsepower	 Po = ρgHQ/550 
	
	
	
Po = 32.2ρHQ/550
Power in kW 		
Po = 0.0437 ρHQ

Calculating Head Losses from K Values
The pressure loss through pipes and pipe fittings is a multiple of the quantity v2/2g, 
where 	
v = fluid velocity (m/s) 
g = gravitational constant = 9.81 m/s2 or 32.2 ft/s2
This is a measure of the kinetic energy of the moving fluid and can be measured in meters (or feet) or 
in pressure units (kPa or lb/in2). It is called the velocity head when it is measured in meters (or feet).
The head loss for straight pipe is
where f, the pipe friction factor, depends on the velocity, fluid viscosity, pipe diameter and pipe roughness. 
The head loss for pipe fittings (elbows, valves, etc.) is
A few values of K are: 
Standard 45° elbow: 	 K = 0.35
Standard 90° elbow: 	 K = 0.75
Gate valve:	
Fully open: K = 0.17	
¼ closed: K = 0.9
	
	
½ closed: K = 4.5	
¾ closed: K = 24
The head loss can be written in terms of flow instead of velocity. The flow in a pipe is
Q = vA and v = Q/A
and	
where 	
A = cross-sectional area of the pipe (m2) 
The system head curve can be developed as a quadratic equation

Example 14.1 HEAD LOSS IN A PIPE WITH THREE ELBOWS
Figure 14.5 a hypothetical pipe that is 50 m long and has three elbows. The friction loss is the same if this is a plan view 
(looking down) or an elevation view. The calculation is for the pipe alone, and does not include the static head due to 
change in elevation.
Pipe length = L = 50 m 
Pipe diameter = D = 0.1 m 
Fluid velocity = v = 3 m/s 
Head loss = hL = K(v2/2g) 
Kpipe = fL/D where f = 0.018 
Kelbow = 0.75 
20 m 
10 m 
10 m 
Figure 14.5 Simple pipe section with L = 50 m, 3 elbows, and v = 3 m/s has a head loss of 5.16 m.
The quantity 
will be used to calculate the head loss in every element of the piping system. For simplicity, in this 
piping system the diameter of pipe and the elbows is D = 0.1 m. The velocity of water flowing in the system is v = 3 m/s. 
The gravitational constant, g = 9.81 m/s3. The headloss of any element can be calculated using
	
For the pipe friction factor use f = 0.018. The head loss due to pipe friction is 
	
The head losses for one elbow and 3 elbows are
	
	
Now put a gate valve in the piping system (it does not matter where in the system). The fully open gate valve has  
K = 0.17 and the head loss is
	
For a half-closed gate valve, K = 4.5 and the head loss is
	
For a ¾-closed gate valve the head loss is
	
The total friction head losses for some possible systems are:
•	
50 m pipe + 3 elbows = 4.128 + 1.032 = 5.16 m
•	
50 m pipe + 3 elbows + fully open gate valve = 4.128 + 1.032 + 0.078 m = 5.238 m
•	
50 m pipe + 3 elbows + 50%-closed gate valve = 4.128 + 1.032 + 2.064 m = 7.221 m
•	
50 m pipe + 3 elbows + 75%-closed gate valve = 4.128 + 1.032 + 11.009 m = 16.169 m

Example 14.2 OPERATING HEAD FOR A PUMP
The general expression for the energy balance of a hydraulic system is 
	
For the system in Figure 14.6, points 1 and 2 are at the surface of the two reservoirs. where z is elevation and p/g is 
pressure expressed as meters. The diameter of the pipe is constant, D = 0.1 m, so v1 = v2. The pressures at points 1 and 
2 are atmospheric, so p1 = p2. Define the water surface elevation of the lower tank as z1 = 0 so z2 = 10 m. The head loss 
equation simplifies to 
.
As in the previous example, the pipe diameter is D = 0.1 m and the velocity is 3 m/s, giving
	
The head loss in the pipe for a pipe friction factor of f = 0.02 is
	
Z1 =0 
Static lift 
= Z2 – Z1 
= 10 m 
K = 0.5 
K = 0.75 
K = 1.5 
   Pump 
Pipe diameter = D = 0.1 m 
Total pipe length = L = 200 m 
f = 0.02 
Friction losses in the hydraulic elements 
     hpipe = 18.35 m 
     hminor = 1.72 m 
Total friction losses = htotal = 20.07 m 
Total system head = 20.07 m + 10 m = 60.14 m 
 Z2 = 10 m 
K = 1.0 
Figure 14.6 The total system head of the pump is 30.07 m, which is a static lift of 10 m plus the friction 
loss in 200 m of 0.1 m diameter pipe, plus four minor losses (pipe inlet, pipe outlet, elbow, and 
pump intake). 
There are four minor head losses:
Inlet to the suction pipe	
K = 0.5
Outlet to the upper tank	
K = 1.0
Inlet to the pump	
K = 1.5
90° elbow	
	
K = 0.75
The total head loss for these four elements is
	
hminor – (0.5 + 1.0 + 1.5 + 0.75)(0.4587 m) = 3.75(0.0487 m) = 1.72 m
The pump must lift the fluid the 10 m of static head plus provide the energy to overcome the friction losses in the pipe 
and the minor losses in the fittings. The total head is
	
h = hstatic + hpipe + hminor = 10 m + 18.35 m + 1.72 m = 30.07 m

Designing Pumping Systems to Minimize the Cost
Pumping accounts for about 20% of world energy usage so there are opportunities to find efficiencies. 
Changing pumps, pump impellers, motors, and pump controls can be cost effective. But it is often difficult 
and costly to make extensive piping changes in large existing system so the greatest opportunities are 
in systems yet to be built.
Figure 14.7 is an example of the complex pipe networks that are common. The nodes identify points 
of withdrawal. The input locations are not shown, but they could be pumping stations, elevated storage 
tanks, or reservoirs. This example comes from a web brochure about the WatDis software (Transparent 
Blue 2013)
Figure 14.7 A complex looped hydraulic network being analyzed with the WatDis hydraulic network design software  
(Transparent Blue Consulting, 2013).
Such a network is analyzed using a system of equations that define the head loss in each pipe and a 
material balance equation for each loop, and an energy balance equation for each loop. The flow into 
each pipe junction must equal the flow out of the junction and there can only be one pressure at each 
junction. An initial assignment of flows is adjusted in an iterative solution (Epp & Fowler 1972). 
Modern optimization technology can search simultaneously for a pipe and pump system that will 
minimize either the first cost or the life-cycle cost, Figure 14.8. An excellent source for pump and piping 
costs is Means (2014). Energy costs will be available locally.

Figure 14.8 Optimized systems for pumps of different head levels and power show a region of cost 
effective designs. The design criterion was minimal life-cycle cost for a 20-year life. 
The traditional method of design was to specify the pipe system and select pumps that had the 
required discharge and operating head. Better design software has encouraged an iterative approach 
to simultaneously design the piping and the pumps by proposing a pipe system, selecting pumps, re-
examining the pipe system, and so on (Hodgson & Walters, 2002). Some hydraulic design software 
packages are WatDis, EPANet, and WaterCAD.

Energy Consumption by Pumping
This concept is illustrated by finding the pipe diameter that minimizes the system cost for the pipe 
geometry shown in Figure 14.6, for a flow of 0.5 m3/s (11.4 mgd). The pump efficiency is ηp = 0.9, motor 
efficiency is ηm = 0.95, and the overall efficiency is ηpηm = 0.855. The cost of power is $0.08 per kWh. 
The cost of pipe, in 2013 US$, with diameter D (m) is CPipe = 620 D, and the cost of the pump is CPump 
= 100,000D1.4.

Annual energy use is for pump efficiency = 90%, motor efficiency = 95% and continuous operation.
Table 14.1 Hydraulic information, power output of the pump, and the annual energy requirement for continuous operation.
Obviously the cost of the pump and the piping increase as the diameter is increased. Also, the system 
head loss will decrease because of the lower friction losses in the larger pipes and the energy required 
will decrease. A criterion is needed that will combine the capital cost and the energy cost. Since the 
project will operate over some period of years that criterion should account for energy costs over the 
lifetime of the project.

Energy Consumption by Pumping
The criterion that does this is the Present Value. The present value is the amount of money one would 
need in the bank at the beginning of the project (pre-construction) to buy the equipment and pay the 
energy cost for the project’s lifetime. In this example, the project lifetime is 10 years and the cost of 
money is 5% per year.
The costs and the present value are shown in Figure 14.9. The minimum cost design is a 0.65 m pipe 
diameter, with a construction cost (pump & pipe only) of $135,312, an annual energy cost of $44,811, 
and a 10-year Present Value of $481,334.
It is assumed that the cost of installing the pump and the piping is the same for all possible pipe diameters 
so this cost is omitted. Including it would simply shift the capital cost curve and the present value curves 
up by a small amount. It would not change the location of the minimum present value.
Table 14.2 gives the costs and the present value for 10 years of operation. The present value is the amount 
of money needed at the beginning of the project to buy the equipment and pay the energy cost for 10 
years. Table 14.3 shows how that works out.

Example 14.3 A SHORT NOTE ON THE PRESENT VALUE CALCULATION
The future value of an amount P0, compounded for n years at interest rate i is
	
For example, P0 = $10,000 invested today for 10 years at 5% interest is worth
	
The converse gives the present value
	
The present value (PV) of a series of equal payments R over n time periods for an interest rate i is
	
The n terms are summed over the n year life of the project. The exponent j in the denominator is the year; j runs from 1 to n.
If the payments are not equal, that is Rj ≠ Rj+1, calculate each term with the appropriate payment and sum the terms.
A payment of $10,000 due in 10 years and valued at 5% per year is
	
For example, the present values of $10,000 payments to be made at 2, 4 and 6 years in the future is
	
A payment at time zero, say in the case where the present value is to pay for the purchase of some equipment and the 
stream of future operating costs, the initial payment is simply added to the sum. For example, if there is an initial cost 
of $75,000 for equipment or a building, the PV with the three $10,000 payments is

Air Blowers and Compressors
Industries use blowers and compressors on incinerators, sprayers, dryers, etc., and they use them to 
convey powders and for mixing and cleaning. Most air compressors run between 60-100 hours per week 
at or near full capacity. Up to10% of electricity used in industry may be to run air compressors. It takes 
about 8 kW of energy to produce 1 kW worth of work with compressed air. One cubic foot per minute 
of air (1 cfm) costs about $100 per year for energy. 
Wastewater treatment plants use blowers to supply air to aerobic biological treatment process, in particular 
the activated sludge process. Insufficient air supply causes absolute failure to meet performance standards. 
This poses a design challenge because air requirements fluctuate continually due to changes in flow, 
organic load, temperature and atmospheric pressure.

Energy Consumption by Pumping
The average amount of electricity used by modern treatment plants is 0.3 kWh/m3 of wastewater treated. 
(1,200 kWh per million gallons). Aeration accounts for 60–70% the overall energy demand. Pumping 
is about 12%.
A conventional activated sludge process will consume 0.12–0.20 kWh/m3 of wastewater treated 
(465–775 kWh per million gallons) (Henze 2008). If nitrification (oxidation of ammonia to nitrate) is 
added the air requirement increases by about 30%. A modern process that uses nitrification-denitrification 
with biological phosphorus removal needs less air, about 0.10–0.15 kWh/m3.
Energy consumption will account for about 75% of the total life-cycle cost for an air blower, compared 
with 15% for capital cost and 10% for maintenance. 
Multiple blowers can be installed to match the demand, or variable speed drives can be used. The installed 
blower capacity should be sufficient to meet the full load when one blower is out of service. The aeration 
system is usually designed to supply 200% of the average demand for air. 
Instruments and closed loop controllers can be installed so the process is given only the air it needs at 
any time. Controlling the process dissolved oxygen concentration in the 1–2 mg/L range that is sufficient 
for a healthy process, instead of 4–5 mg/L, corresponds to a 35–70% reduction in air flow.

Energy Consumption by Pumping
The basic concepts of air delivery systems are similar to liquid pumping systems, with the difference 
that air is compressible and liquids are not. Compression will raise the temperature of the air and as the 
temperature increases the power requirement goes up.
Centrifugal blowers are a popular means to supply air to an activated sludge process. The centrifugal 
blower, like a centrifugal pump, has an impeller on a rotating shaft. The output can be adjusted with a 
variable speed drive. The output will vary depending on the output pressure. 
The blower has an operating curve that determines the relation of air flow and discharge pressure. The 
air delivery piping and equipment (filters, diffusers, etc.) determine the system power curve. This also 
relates air flow and discharge pressure. The intersection of the operating curve and the system curve is 
the operating point.
Figure 14.10 is the performance map for a variable speed centrifugal blower. The operating curves are 
shown for the maximum speed (100% rpm) and for a few other speeds. The lowest speed for a compressor 
is the turndown limit, or simply turndown. Turndown can also be given as a percentage of the rated flow. 
Values range from 45–60% but 50% is a good value for many blowers.
Figure 14.10 Centrifugal compressor performance map 
Surge is the point at which the compressor cannot add enough energy to overcome the system resistance 
or backpressure. This causes a flow reversal, or surge.
Choke occurs as the airflow increases, its velocity can approach sonic speed somewhere within the 
compressor stage.

Figure 14.11 in Example 14.4 outlines the components that determine the operating pressure, which are
1.	 blower inlet filter and inlet manifold piping
2.	 header losses from blower to aeration tanks
3.	 drop-pipe and diffuser piping in basin
4.	 diffuser losses
5.	 static pressure water depth to diffuser
6.	 allowance for diffuser clogging
7.	 safety factor (usually 0.50–0.75 psia)
Items 1, 2, 5 and 7 are the responsibility of the process designer. Items 3, 4, and 6 are the responsibility 
of the diffuser equipment supplier (Environmental Dynamics Int’l 2005, 2011, Siemens AG/Turblex, 
Inc. 2009, Mueller et al 2002).
The static pressure due to the depth of the water over the diffuser is
	
ps = k d
where	
k = 0.433 for ps = gage pressure (psig, lb/in2) and d = water depth (ft)
k = 1.877 for ps = gage pressure (kg/cm2) and d = water depth (m)
k = 0.01914 for ps = gage pressure (kP) and d = water depth (m)
Example 14.4 shows plausible pressure loss values for a simplified system.
Example 14.4 PRESSURE DROP IN FINE BUBBLE DIFFUSER SYSTEM
The barometric pressure at the blower air filter inlet is 14.5 psia. The loss in the filter and the blower inlet manifold is 0.2 
psi so the inlet pressure at the blower is 14.5 – 0.2 = 14.3 psia.
There is a pressure loss of 0.8 psi in the air distribution piping and a loss of 0.4 psi in the aeration tank downpipe and the 
fine bubble diffusers. The water depth of 15 ft causes a static pressure of 6.5 psi. This gives a diffuser discharge pressure of
	
Pdischarge = 14.3 + 0.8 + 0.4 + 6.5 = 22 psia
The design pressure is usually includes an allowance for a diffuser clogging (0.5 psi) and perhaps a safety factor (0.5 
psia), which would give a design discharge pressure of 23 psia.

Finally
These are absolute temperatures: K = 273 + °C , °R = 460 + °F. The pressures are absolute pressures (i.e. 
gauge pressure plus atmospheric pressure). (Note: In some references the exponent on the pressure ratio 
is 0.283.)
Example 14.5 BLOWER OUTLET TEMPERATURE
A blower operates at atmospheric (barometric) pressure pb = 14.6 psia with a pressure drop ∆p = 0.2 psig through the 
inlet filter and inlet manifold. This makes the blower inlet pressure p1 = 14.6 – 0.2 = 14.4 psia. The inlet temperature T1 
= 50°F = 510°R. The outlet pressure is 8.0 psig, which gives p2 = 14.4 + 8.0 = 22.4 psia.
The outlet temperature T2 is 
 
   ∆T = T2 – T1 = 118.7°F – 50°F = 68.7°F
Example 14.6 BLOWER POWER
The air requirement is 14,000 scfm and the air density is 0.075 lb/ft3. The inlet conditions are p1 = 14.2 psia and  
T1 = 55 °F = 515 °R. The outlet pressure is 14.2 psig + 8.5 psig = 22.7 psia. The specific heat for air is 0.24 Btu/lb°F (0.24 
Btu/lb°R).
Calculate the blower power.
	
	
P = (1,118,000 Btu/h)(1 hp/2,544 Btu/h) = 439.5 hp
	
P = (1,118,000 Btu/h)(2.931x10-4 kW/Btu/h) = 327.7 kW
	
P = (1,118,000 Btu/h)(1 kJ/0.9478 Btu) = 1,180,000 kJ/h = 1,180 MJ/h

The organic load on an activated sludge process changes continually, typically being a minimum in the early 
morning, with a peak mid-day and evening. The load is at 100% of the daily average from 0800–1000 hours and the 
average daily air flow rate for this time interval is 14,000 scfm. The blower inlet pressure is 14.2 psia. The demand 
for air is given in columns 1–4 of Table 14.4. The discharge pressure in column 6 is based on a blower inlet pressure 
of 14.2 psia. The calculation of columns 7–9 is explained in the footnotes to the table. The inlet temperature

The mass and volume of air required is easily obtained in most applications, such as ventilation air or 
incineration air supply. An important application that is not obvious is for the supply of oxygen to an 
activated sludge wastewater treatment process. The details, which are not within the scope of this book, 
may be found in any textbook about biological wastewater treatment design (Qasim 1998, Henze 2008). 
Still, this discussion of air blowers seems incomplete without a rough outline of the procedure.

A 1mgd activated sludge process needs an oxygen supply of 3,150 lb/d. 
The oxygen content of 1 scfm of air is 0.0173 lb O2/min = 24.91 lb O2/d. 
The selected fine bubble diffusers will dissolve 29% of this oxygen operating in clean water at 20°C, 1 atm, and 0 mg/L 
dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration. 
The standard oxygen transfer rate (SOTR) is
	
SOTR = 0.29(24.91 lb O2/d) = 7.224 lb O2/d per scfm of air supplied
The oxygen transfer rate wastewater at field conditions is less than the SOTR for a variety of reasons, such as the 
temperature not being 20°C, different air pressure, impurities in the wastewater, and the DO concentration being 1-2 
mg/L (instead of zero). Making adjustments for such factors gives an actual oxygen transfer rate (AOTR) of
	
AOTR = 0.33 SOTR
	
AOTR = 0.33(7.224 lb O2/d) = 2.384 lb O2/d per scfm air supplied
The required air flow rate is
	
14.8	
Conclusion
This simplified introduction of how the design of piping systems and the selection of pumps relates to 
energy consumption is not sufficient to do actual hydraulic design, but it should alert you to opportunities 
to economize. 
The pipe-pump system is rarely a single long pipe with a pump at one end. Actual systems have branches 
and loops, changes in pipe diameter, many kinds of restrictions in the network (valves, heat exchangers, 
etc.) and changes in elevation. 
Air supply for an activated sludge process will account for 60% or more of the total energy use in 
conventional wastewater treatment. The design of air blowers is in many ways similar to the design of 
liquid pumps. The main difference is that air is compressible and this comes into the calculation of the 
power requirements.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Appendix 4 – Heating Values
19	 Appendix 4 – Heating Values
The heating value is the amount of heat produced by combustion of a unit quantity of a fuel. We 
differentiate between gross and net heating values:
Gross (or high, upper) Heating Value. The gross or high heating value is the amount of heat produced 
by the complete combustion of a unit quantity of fuel. The gross heating value is obtained when all 
products of the combustion are cooled down to the temperature before the water vapor formed during 
combustion is condensed.
Net (or lower) Heating Value. The net or lower heating value is obtained by subtracting the latent heat 
of vaporization of the water vapor formed by the combustion from the gross or higher heating value.
Common Units for heating values:
1 Btu/ft3 = 8.9 kcal/m3 = 3.73×104 J/m3
1 Btu/lb = 2,326.1 J/kg = 0.55556 kcal/kg
1 J/kg = 0.00043 Btu/lb = 2.39×10-4 kcal/kg
1 kcal/kg = 1.80 Btu/lb = 4,187 J/kg
