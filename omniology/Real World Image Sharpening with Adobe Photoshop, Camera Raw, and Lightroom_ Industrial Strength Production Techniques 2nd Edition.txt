Preface
Real World Sharpening
For almost 20 years, ever since it ﬁ rst shipped in 1990, Bruce and Jeff have 
labored in the vineyards of Photoshop, coaxing pixels to do our bidding. 
In that time, we’ve seen huge advances in the handling of image tone and 
color. When Bruce started digital imaging, getting the image to look the 
same on two different monitors was a major breakthrough, and matching 
the print to the screen appearance was the stuff of science ﬁ ction. Nowadays, 
it tends to be the rule rather than the exception.
We’ve made gargantuan strides in the handling of image tone and color, but 
when it comes to control of image detail, which is what this book is really 
about, we’re still only a little more advanced than we were in 1990. It’s just 
about impossible to make two different displays render image sharpness 
exactly the same way, and predicting print sharpness from the display is an 
exercise fraught with pitfalls and perils. In fact, we’re back in the days of, 
“If you want to know what it will look like when you print it, print it and 
then look at it.”
As a result, sharpening (and the equally important other side of the coin, 
noise reduction and smoothing) tends to be an ad hoc practice. We ﬂ ail 
around until we get something that looks decent on the display and hope 
that appearance will somehow be transferred to the printed piece.

Photoshop CS4, Camera Raw, and Lightroom offer many powerful features 
for handling image detail. But how do you know what to aim for? This 
book contains a plethora of different sharpening tricks and techniques, but 
perhaps the most important contribution it strives to make is to provide you 
with an analytical framework that lets you think about sharpening in a new 
way. When we sharpen, we have to take at least three things into account:
* 
The relationship between image detail and system noise that’s imposed 
by the capture medium—we want to sharpen image details but we don’t 
want to exaggerate ﬁ lm grain or digital noise.
* 
The requirements of the image content—the wrong kind of sharpening 
can exaggerate texture we’d rather downplay, or even obscure detail 
instead of emphasizing it.
* 
The needs of the print process—when we translate pixels into marks 
on paper (or canvas, or any other substrate on which we print) we 
inevitably introduce some softness for which we try to compensate by 
sharpening.
The huge problem is that these needs often contradict one another.
THE SHARPENING WORKFLOW
The solution is the sharpening workﬂ ow. By treating each demand separately, 
we can assure that all are addressed optimally. To some, this may smack of 
heresy: Doesn’t everyone know that you can sharpen an image only once? 
We demonstrate that multipass sharpening is not only feasible but optimal. 
It’s simply impossible to address all the conﬂ icting needs of image source, 
image content, and output process in a single round of sharpening.
That said, multipass sharpening demands care and attention to detail. 
Blasting images with multiple hits of sharpening can create a hideously 
oversharpened mess, which is why the conventional wisdom dictates that 
you sharpen only once. However, the techniques described in this book 
allow you to sharpen images safely and optimally.

THE SHARPENING WORKFLOW
ix
The sharpening workﬂ ow confers another beneﬁ t. By separating sharpening 
for output from the other sharpening processes, it creates use-neutral master 
images that you can easily repurpose for different output processes, at differ-
ent sizes and resolutions.
Sharpening and the Display
One of the hardest sharpening lessons to learn is that what you see on your 
computer display can be highly misleading. But the screen is often all you 
have to rely on for your judgments before output. 
Some display technologies render images much more sharply than others—
the same image almost invariably looks sharper on an LCD display than it 
does on a CRT. Display resolution also has an impact. We’ve gone to some 
lengths to debunk the polite ﬁ ction that computer screens display images at 
72 pixels per inch, and have even given instructions that will let you deter-
mine the real resolution of your display, which is the one that really matters.
The most important lesson of all, however, is that good sharpening for print 
can often look terrible—really, hideously, horribly bad—on screen. Learning 
the relationship between what you see on your display and what shows up on 
hard copy is a vital skill this book helps you acquire.
Objective Realities
Some parts of the sharpening equation are determinate. Human visual 
acuity—the ability to discern ﬁ ne details—has limits that are rooted in the 
physiology of the eye. The same visual properties that we exploit to produce 
the illusion of continuous tone from dots of four colors of ink also have a 
direct bearing on sharpening.
Print sharpening is also a determinate process. Any given print process will 
always translate pixels into dots in the same way, regardless of image source 
or image content, so for any print process, there’s a right answer in terms of 
sharpening. (Of course, there are also many wrong ones.) 

Creative Capacities
Sharpening is also a creative tool. We use sharpening to emphasize impor-
tant detail (and sometimes we use blurring to suppress irrelevant, distracting 
detail), make a point, tell a story, invoke an emotion, or provide an illusion 
of three dimensions in our two-dimensional photographs. The sharpening 
workﬂ ow has a place for creativity, too. But it’s important to know when to 
be creative and when to go by the numbers.
Multiple-Application Workﬂ ows
The ﬁ rst edition of this book dealt only with sharpening in Photoshop. For 
many reasons, a Photoshop-only workﬂ ow is no longer practical for most 
people using digital cameras. As a result of the changes in the industry 
(some of them helped by Bruce’s philosophies) we wanted to describe and 
facilitate the approach of using the right tool for the job. Sometimes that 
won’t be just Photoshop but may be Camera Raw or Lightroom or all three.
WHO NEEDS THIS BOOK?
If you work with images that are destined for hard copy, and you aren’t 
totally conﬁ dent about all your sharpening decisions, our hope is that you’ll 
ﬁ nd this book beneﬁ cial. No matter whether you make your own prints, 
send them out to an online printing service, or deliver commercial work 
destined for offset press, the sharpening workﬂ ow can help you get the most 
out of your images. 
This is not a book for Photoshop beginners, but neither is it a book only 
for Photoshop experts. Some of the techniques described herein use fairly 
esoteric Photoshop features with which you may or may not be familiar. 
Don’t let that put you off. We’ve yet to encounter a piece of software that 
was smarter than its users, and Photoshop is no exception. Almost all the 
techniques in this book are nondestructive—they don’t touch your original 
pixels—so you can’t do any harm to your images by trying them.

How the Book Is Organized
We’ve tried to present all the information you need to build your own 
sharpening workﬂ ow. 
The ﬁ rst two chapters look at the technical underpinnings of sharpening. 
Chapter 1, What Is Sharpening?, explores the fundamental nature of sharpening
—what it does and how it works. Chapter 2, Why Do We Sharpen?, discusses 
the need for sharpening, and all the factors we need to address when we 
sharpen.
Chapter 3, Sharpening Strategies, provides an overview of the sharpening 
workﬂ ow and shows how it addresses each sharpening phase. Chapter 4, 
Sharpening Tools, describes the various tools that the sharpening workﬂ ow 
employs.
Chapter 5, Industrial-Strength Sharpening Techniques, shows how to use the 
tools described in Chapter 4 to satisfy the goals outlined in Chapter 3 by 
building a sharpening workﬂ ow from initial sharpening, through creative 
tweaking, all the way to ﬁ nal output.
Chapter 6, Putting the Tools to Work, shows how to create actions and do 
batch processing in Photoshop. It also emphasizes the importance of presets 
in Camera Raw and Lightroom.  All of this is aimed at making your sharp-
ening workﬂ ow efﬁ cient.
A WORD TO WINDOWS USERS
This book applies to both Windows and Mac OS. Since Bruce and Jeff have 
been using Macs for over 20 years, all the dialog boxes, menus, and palettes 
are illustrated using screen shots from the Mac OS version. Similarly, when 
discussing the many keyboard shortcuts in the program, we cite the Mac 
OS versions and try to include the Windows version. In every shortcut cited 
in this book, the Command key translates to the Ctrl key and the Option 
key translates to the Alt key. We apologize to all you Windows users for the 
small inconvenience, but because Photoshop is so close to being identical on 
both platforms, we picked the one we knew and ran with it.

THIS BOOK’S ORIGINS
Much of the material in this book is an outgrowth of work that Bruce Fraser 
originally did in the process of developing a commercial sharpening tool, 
PhotoKit Sharpener, from PixelGenius, LLC. Bruce was proud of PhotoKit 
Sharpener and was particularly proud to have been asked by Adobe to con-
sult on the development of the advanced capture sharpening that went into 
Camera Raw 4.1 and Lightroom 1.1. While Bruce didn’t get the chance to 
ﬁ nish the consult, the Camera Raw team worked with Jeff to incorporate 
Bruce’s capture-sharpening philosophies into Camera Raw and Lightroom.
PixelGenius is also proud that Adobe chose to work with us to adapt the 
PhotoKit Sharpener technology for Lightroom and Camera Raw. We appreci-
ate that the Camera Raw and Lightroom teams have exhibited such respect 
to what Bruce thought was his most important contribution to the industry: 
the development of the concept of a sharpening workﬂ ow and its compo-
nents; capture, creative, and output sharpening.

What Is Sharpening?
And How Does It Work?
An old saw in photography goes, “If you want great prints, use a tripod!” 
While it’s usually delivered half-jokingly, the important grain of truth is that 
one of the ways our brains try to make sense of the world as seen through 
our eyes is by breaking down the scene into edges (objects) and non-edges 
(surfaces). If the edges in an image appear too sharp or not sharp enough, 
our brains tell us that there’s something wrong, and in the case of a photo-
graph, the image appears unconvincing.
Sharpening is arguably one of the most important yet least understood aspects 
of digital image reproduction. Examples of badly sharpened images are easy 
to ﬁ nd—you probably need look no further than your daily newspaper or 
favorite magazine. Good sharpening, on the other hand, is invisible. 
Sharpening can’t ﬁ x sloppy focus or a shaky camera. What it can and should 
do is to ensure that the sharpness of the original capture is carried through 
faithfully to the ﬁ nal output. Of course, sometimes we also use sharpening 
to improve reality—we may add some extra snap to the eyes and hair in a 
head shot, for example. But the primary purpose of sharpening is not to 
rescue overly soft images, but simply to counteract the inevitable softening 
that happens when we turn photons into pixels and pixels into marks on paper.
In Chapter 2, we’ll look at the various factors that give rise to the need for 
sharpening. But before we examine those, let’s look at how sharpening 
works, whether it’s done in a wet darkroom using analog tools or accom-
plished digitally either in the camera or in Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Camera 
Raw, or Adobe Lightroom.

CHAPTER 1: WHAT IS SHARPENING?

Emphasizing Edges
Sharpening works by increasing the contrast around edges. Edges in images 
always involve darker tonal values adjacent to lighter ones. We can empha-
size the edges by making the dark tonal values darker and the light tonal 
values lighter. 
In the analog darkroom, this was accomplished using an unsharp mask. (See 
the sidebar “Why Is It Called ‘Unsharp Mask’ When It’s Used to Sharpen?” 
for details on just how this process worked.) In the digital domain, we 
sharpen by identifying the dark and light pixels that represent edges, and 
then we lower the value of the dark pixels to make them darker and raise 
the value of the light pixels to make them lighter.
This adjustment creates a “halo” that makes the edges, and, hence, the entire 
image, seem sharper. The concept is simple, but as with many things in dig-
ital imaging, the devil is in the details that we discuss throughout this book!
Figure 1-1 shows the same image before and after sharpening. (The image 
also illustrates the pitfalls of driving in rural Scotland—a good meta-
phor for the myriad things that can go wrong when we use sharpening 
inappropriately.)

The only difference between the two versions is the sharpening. Figure 1-2 
shows a zoomed-in comparison with an accompanying graph of the values 
of a single row of pixels before and after sharpening.
Notice that the tonal range—the distance between the lightest and darkest 
tones—of the sharpened version is wider than that of the unsharpened 
version. Also notice that the biggest differences occur at the edge transi-
tions of the capital O, while smaller differences emphasize the texture of 
the sign’s background.
Sharpening is closely related to contrast, but simply increasing the contrast 
over an entire image just produces an over-contrasted image. Successful 
sharpening demands that we localize the contrast boost to those parts of the 
image that actually represent edges.

Why Is It Called “Unsharp Mask” When It’s Used 
to Sharpen?
Sharpening predates digital imaging by many decades. If you’ve often won-
dered why one of Photoshop’s main sharpening tools is named the Unsharp 
Mask fi lter when it’s supposed to make the image sharper, rest assured that 
you’re not alone.
The name originated from an analog wet-darkroom technique that increases 
the apparent sharpness of a photographic print using a duplicate of the nega-
tive to create a mask that increases contrast along the edges. The original and 
the duplicate negatives are placed on either side of a piece of glass—often 
just plain old window glass—and the entire sandwich is placed in the enlarg-
er’s negative carrier. 
When the enlarger is focused on the bottom negative, the top, out-of-focus 
copy creates a contrast mask that boosts the contrast along the edges in the 
image. Meanwhile, the out-of-focus dark contour burns the dark side of the 
edges and the out-of-focus light contour dodges the light side of the edges.
This technique is called “unsharp masking” because the mask—the top nega-
tive—is out of focus and, hence, isn’t sharp. In short, it’s an unsharp mask that 
has the eff ect of increasing the apparent sharpness in the print!
So the “unsharp” in “unsharp mask” refers to the mask, not the result, and it’s 
this analog technique that Photoshop’s Unsharp Mask fi lter replicates (though 
with much more control than its analog counterpart).
Analog Roots
As a photographic practice, sharpening has its roots in the analog world. 
However, the analog unsharp masking technique offered only two controls:
• 
The distance between the two negatives (the thickness of the glass) 
controlled the width of the sharpening halo.
• 
The exposure time controlled the strength of the contrast boost.
The tedious alignment, limited control, and uncertain results prevented 
unsharp masking from becoming a mainstream practice in analog photog-
raphy. But it did see considerable use in sharpening analog color separations 
for offset printing. It was done by making a blurred duplicate of the contin-
uous-tone separation and then printing it together with the sharp version 

DIGITAL PROCESSING

as a contact print, after which the separation was screened for halftone lines 
(lines of dots per inch). 
Sharpening for continuous-tone photographic prints was something of 
a luxury, but when the continuous-tone original was turned into cyan, 
magenta, yellow, and black dots of ink, some of the original sharpness was 
lost. So sharpening became, and remains to this day, a standard operation 
in prepress. When the drum scanner replaced the stat camera (stationary 
camera used to shoot ﬁ lm from camera-ready artwork), digital sharpening 
became the norm.
DIGITAL PROCESSING
Digital sharpening tools offer far more precision, control, and options than 
the analog darkroom ever did. The inevitable downside is that with greater 
control comes greater responsibility, and the more options on offer, the 
more opportunities for mistakes, as we’ll demonstrate throughout this book. 
Unsharp Mask Filter
Photoshop’s Unsharp Mask (USM) ﬁ lter is a process that is similar to the 
analog version of sharpening. It creates an unseen (meaning you never see 
it) blurred version of the image in the background and uses the difference 
between the original version and the blurred version to determine edges 
that will be sharpened. Figure 1-3 shows a graphical representation of how 
Photoshop’s USM ﬁ lter works.
Figure 1-3 shows an original unsharpened image. The original layer was 
duplicated and the second layer was blurred three pixels using the Gaussian 
Blur ﬁ lter. The blurred copy layer was set to Difference mode. To show the 
resulting difference, we’ve added a strong Levels adjustment layer to empha-
size the results.
In the last image, the result of placing the layers in Difference mode was 
loaded as a selection (where white allows an effect and black resists) and 
used as a layer mask for a Curves adjustment to lighten the light edges and 
darken the dark edges. This is essentially the same function as the USM 
Radius and Amount adjustments, and is the basis of most digital sharpening 
algorithms.

CHAPTER 1: WHAT IS SHARPENING?

The Threshold adjustment determines how much of a difference there 
must be between the blurred and unblurred copy before the sharpening 
process is applied. With a zero threshold, the sharpening would be applied 
to any difference. The higher the threshold, the less the sharpening will be 
applied for lower contrast edges. Figure 1-4 shows the result of increasing 
the threshold.
Increasing the threshold from zero to 50 means that only the higher contrast 
edges will be sharpened—the lower contrast edges will not.

Digital Noise Reduction
There are other digital sharpening algorithms above and beyond Photoshop’s 
USM ﬁ lter, and we cover them extensively in this book. However, there’s one 
key difference between digital and analog sharpening with which we have to 
contend in varying degrees: the handling of noise. Analog sharpening rarely 
increased noise and often had the effect of reducing it, because the mask 
was made from a different piece of ﬁ lm than the original, so the distribution 
of the ﬁ lm grain—the main noise component in ﬁ lm images—was different. 
This had the desirable effect of making the noise in the mask cancel out the 
noise in the original. With digital sharpening, we aren’t so lucky.
When it comes to digital sharpening, noise reduction is the ﬂ ip side of the 
same coin. Sharpening tools such as Photoshop’s USM ﬁ lter evaluate one 
pixel at a time, determining how different it is from its neighbors. If the dif-
ference is great enough, the ﬁ lter decides that this pixel represents an edge 
and adjusts its value accordingly.

CHAPTER 1: WHAT IS SHARPENING?

The inherent problem is that the computer has no way of knowing whether 
the pixel differences represent real image information or noise, so unless 
we take steps to prevent it, most sharpening routines emphasize the noise as 
well as the edges. If you refer back to Figure 1-2, you’ll see that the capital O 
in the sharpened version of the image is much noisier than in the unsharp-
ened one. 
However, if you refer even further back to Figure 1-1, it’s unlikely that you’ll 
see any objectionable noise in the printed reproduction at that size. The 
noise is conﬁ ned to dark tones in small areas. Figure 1-5, on the other hand, 
shows what can happen if we fail to take noise into account.

reduction and no sharpening.

emphasizing noise as well as detail.

This image is something of a “bad-case” scenario, shot at ISO 1600 on a 
fairly noisy digital SLR. It would have been a worst-case scenario if the shot 
had been unexposed, but it dramatizes the point that we must take noise 
into account when we sharpen if we don’t want our images to appear like 
sandpaper.
In many cases, we can prevent the sandpaper effect simply by protecting the 
noisy areas from sharpening. But in extreme cases like the one shown in 
Figure 1-5, some more proactive noise reduction may be needed before the 
application of sharpening. 
Digital noise reduction is essentially the opposite of sharpening. Instead of 
increasing localized contrast, it reduces it, thereby rendering the noise less 
visible or even removing it entirely. Of course, the inevitable catch is that as 
it reduces the noise it also de-emphasizes the edges, making the image softer.
So one of the ﬁ rst key skills to master in sharpening is striking the right bal-
ance between emphasizing edges and reducing noise—walking the ﬁ ne line 
between sharpness and sandpaper. Overly aggressive noise reduction creates 
an irreparably soft image, so noise reduction must be used with caution, and 
always should be done prior to sharpening (otherwise we sharpen the noise 
as well as the image). Most of the time, simply making sure that we don’t 
sharpen noise does the trick. But when images are captured on high-speed 
ﬁ lm or at high ISO settings on a digital camera, we may have to do a little 
more to reduce noise.
Sharpening and Pixels
All digital sharpening is carried out on pixels. Throughout this book, we’ll 
examine images at the pixel level to see what happens to the pixels through 
various stages of image reproduction. But, with the exception of images des-
tined for on-screen display on the Web or in an information kiosk, the ﬁ nal 
product is not pixels but, rather, marks on paper or some other substrate.
The physical relationship between the image pixels on a display and the 
marks on paper is rarely obvious. In conventional halftone printing—the 
kind we use on printing presses—it typically takes between two and four 
pixels to form a single halftone dot in grayscale printing. When we print 
in color, this relationship is even less obvious, since the halftone dots are 
spread across four different color plates.

CHAPTER 1: WHAT IS SHARPENING?
10
Inkjet printers use a different type of screening, but again, the relationship 
between printer dots is complicated. Even in the relatively simple scenario of 
printing to a true continuous-tone printer, where the pixels are reproduced 
one-to-one, the pixels on the print are typically much smaller than the same 
pixels on screen.
We can’t control how the pixels get turned into printer dots, yet we can con-
trol the degree of contrast boost and the size of the pixels on output. In so 
doing, we control, in turn, the width of the sharpening halo. The goal is to 
avoid haloes that our eyes pick out as discrete features, while making them 
strong enough and just wide enough to produce a sharpening effect.
Since we can control only the ﬁ nal size of the pixels, we must do our ﬁ nal 
sharpening at ﬁ nal output size and resolution to get the sharpening halo right. 
If the image is resized after sharpening, the haloes either get bigger and 
visually obvious, or they become too small and we lose the sharpening effect.
For some people, that means that all sharpening must be deferred until 
the image is at output size; otherwise, multiple rounds of sharpening will 
destroy the image. That’s one of the notions this book seeks to challenge: 
It’s certainly true that multiple rounds of sharpening can destroy the image, 
and that the ﬁ nal, critical round of sharpening must be tailored to the out-
put process and applied to the ﬁ nal image pixels. But throughout this book, 
we argue that optimal sharpening simply cannot be accomplished by a 
single pass of sharpening at the end of the image preparation process. This 
is because the softening that occurs when pixels are turned into print dots is 
only one of several, often competing factors that must be addressed.
In the next chapter, we’ll look at all of the different factors we must take 
into account when we sharpen.

chapter 
two
Why Do We Sharpen?
And What Must We Take Into Account 
When We Do So?
Whenever we turn photons into pixels, we lose some degree of sharpness. 
No matter how high-resolution our capture devices or how expensive our 
lenses, they sample a ﬁ xed grid of pixels and are thus limited. So cameras 
(and scanners) turn the continuous gradations of tone and color that exist in 
the real world into discrete pixels of the digital world. When the pixels are 
small enough, they provide the convincing illusion of continuous tone, but it 
is just an illusion. Image sharpening is one of the things we simply must do 
to make the illusion convincing.
The reason that sharpening is such a complex topic (and the reason for this 
book) is that successful sharpening requires the consideration of several 
potentially competing factors. These factors, which we’ll discuss in detail in 
this chapter, fall into three basic categories:
• 
The image source
• 
The image content
• 
The image use
11

CHAPTER 2: WHY DO WE SHARPEN?
12
For decades, the standard operating procedure has been to punt on the issue 
of how and when to sharpen, and just try to handle all sharpening in one 
single pass, usually at the end of image processing, just before output. With 
ﬁ lm scans, this worked after a fashion, though we suspect the results were 
rarely optimal. With most digital captures, the results are even less likely to 
be optimal simply due to how most digital cameras work.
Does My Image Need Sharpening?
Yes. Even if your image appears reasonably sharp when viewed at Actual Pixels 
(the Adobe Photoshop View menu command that displays the image at 100% 
zoom) on your computer display, the image will need sharpening depending 
on the fi nal use. Of course, if your image appears in soft focus in Actual Pixels 
view, it defi nitely needs sharpening no matter what the fi nal use. 
One of the harshest sharpening lessons we’ve learned is that it’s extremely 
diffi  cult to make judgments about output sharpening by looking at pixels on 
a computer display. If your images are destined for a specifi c type of display—
for example, a kiosk—ideally, you should look at the images on that display 
before making any fi nal judgments. Barring that, use the display as a guide, as 
explained in the “The Display as a Guide” section, below.
SHARPENING AND DISPLAYS
Unless a TV or computer display is your ﬁ nal output, making images 
look sharp on the display almost invariably results in an under-sharpened 
printed output. But even displays themselves vary hugely in the way they 
reproduce sharpness.
Display Technologies
LCDs (liquid crystal displays) are much sharper than CRT (cathode-ray 
tube) displays when set to their native resolution. An image that looks sharp 
on an LCD device may still look soft on a CRT, and an image that looks 
sharp on a CRT display may look slightly crunchy on an LCD. 
If your images are being prepared for the Web, realize that you have very 
little control over what the other billion or so Web users will see. Nowadays, 
NOTE: You’ll notice 
that we refer to the 
screen that connects to your 
computer that allows you 
to see images as a “display.” 
A computer “monitor” is some-
thing that monitors your com-
puter, not a display. We realize 
this is a small distinction, but 
we have good friends in the 
computer industry who would 
complain if we referred to the 
device on which we view 
images as a “monitor.”

SHARPENING AND DISPLAYS

many more users have LCDs than CRT displays. In fact, CRTs are no 
longer being made. All you can do is aim for the middle of a very large barn 
door, but remember that an LCD is likely to be more representative of the 
general Web population than is a CRT.
Display Resolution
The resolution of the display also has a major impact on how we see image 
sharpness. An image that looks pleasingly sharp on a display running at 
1600 x 1200 shows obvious, less-pleasing sharpening haloes on the same 
display running at 1024 x 768. The pixels are displayed at a larger size when 
the display is run at 1024 x 768, so the sharpening haloes become bigger 
and, thus, more obvious.
Again, if you’re sharpening images for the Web, you need to aim for the 
“average” display resolution, which is probably closer to 1024 x 768 than 
1600 x 1200.
The Display as a Guide
Sharpening for use on a display is an uncertain endeavor unless you know 
the exact display for which you’re sharpening. Yet a much bigger issue is 
how to use the display as a guide for print sharpening. The easy answer is, 
unfortunately, that there are no easy answers!
Luckily, the situation isn’t entirely hopeless—it’s just challenging. The fun-
damental concern that should always be foremost in your mind is the actual 
size of the pixels on output. But to understand the relationship between 
what you see on the screen and what you get on output, some additional 
information is useful.
First, determine the display’s true resolution. Many of us tend to leave 
unquestioned the polite ﬁ ction that computer displays have a resolution of 
72 pixels per inch (ppi). This is often not the case—in fact, it’s quite unlikely 
that your display’s resolution is exactly 72 ppi, though it may be close.
Display vendors usually specify the size of the image area as a diagonal 
measurement, which makes for a big number but isn’t the actual resolution. 
Determining the display’s true resolution is a simple exercise that requires 
no equipment more complicated than a tape measure:

CHAPTER 2: WHY DO WE SHARPEN?
14
1. Using a tape measure, measure the width, in inches, of the image area 
on your display.
2. Divide the number of horizontal pixels that your display can show by 
the number of inches from Step 1.
The resulting number is the true resolution of your display in pixels 
per inch.
For example, the horizontal image area of both of Jeff’s main LCDs (a 30" 
NEC 3090WXi and an Apple 30" Cinema) is 25.25 inches. The native reso-
lution for both is 2560 x 1600 pixels, so the actual resolution is 101.4 ppi. A 
third LCD has a resolution of 1920 x 1200 pixels and is running at 87.8 ppi. 
The image area on CRTs is more variable than on LCDs, because the 
geometry controls let you adjust the picture size. 
Table 2-1 shows the approximate resolutions for typical display sizes and 
pixel dimensions.

Knowing your display’s true resolution is the key to understanding the 
relationship between the pixels you see on your display and the ﬁ nal 
printed results. 

SHARPENING AND DISPLAYS
15
If your display is around 100 ppi and you’re printing at around 240 ppi, 
viewing the image at 50% will give you a truer picture of the ﬁ nal sharpen-
ing. Similarly, if your display is around 75 ppi and you’re printing at 300 
ppi, the 25% view will give you a closer idea of ﬁ nal sharpness than any of 
the higher zoom percentages. It still won’t be perfect—Adobe Photoshop’s 
downsampling algorithms, regardless of the version, have a different effect 
on sharpness than do the mechanisms by which printers or platesetters turn 
image pixels into dots—but it’ll be a lot closer than the Actual Pixels (100%) 
view. See the sidebar “How Does Photoshop Display Images?” for informa-
tion about changes in Photoshop CS4’s display engine.
Thus the problem remains: You simply cannot reliably judge image sharpen-
ing intended for printed output on a computer display. Even if you reduce the 
screen zoom, you are still evaluating your higher-resolution image on a low-
resolution device. Neither the image sharpening nor image noise nor grain 
can be displayed accurately at a reduced zoom. The effective resolution of the 
display will be a third to a quarter of the resolution contained in the image.
How Does Photoshop Display Images?
Photoshop CS4 takes the open image (or images) and scales it down (down-
samples) from its actual resolution to a size and resolution for on-screen 
display. In previous versions of Photoshop, users had to avoid odd zoom 
percentages because Photoshop scaled images for display using a Nearest 
Neighbor interpolation for speed. The 50%, 25%, and conceivably the 12.5% 
views preserved sharpness reasonably well, but the odd zoom percent-
ages (66.7%, 33.3%, and intermediate zoom percentages) did not, because 
Photoshop applied fairly strong anti-aliasing (partial fi lling of edge pixels to 
create smooth line edges) to those zoom levels. Photoshop CS4’s ability to 
use your computer’s video card’s GPU (graphics processing unit) for display 
enhancements is a major change in how Photoshop can display images.
With the Enable OpenGL Drawing option checked, Photoshop uses high-preci-
sion modeling and smoothing by using a bilinear interpolation when scaling 
images for on-screen display. However, while this is a great improvement in 
display quality, it further complicates an already complicated situation, because 
not everybody has suitable video cards, or users may need to turn off  the 
Enable OpenGL Drawing for compatibility reasons. And while it certainly can 
make a wide range of display percentages look good, the GPU doesn’t magi-
cally add any resolution to your display. So your computer’s display is still a 
low-resolution viewing device (even if it looks a lot better in Photoshop CS4).

CHAPTER 2: WHY DO WE SHARPEN?
16
The only really reliable method of actually seeing your image pixels is to 
evaluate the image at a screen zoom of 100%, where one image pixel will be 
displayed on one display pixel. Only at this 1:1 ratio can you see what image 
detail is contained in the image. The problem with this is that at 1:1, the 
image will be two to four times larger than the printed dimensions. At that 
size, the relationship of image detail to printed detail is inaccurate. Thus 
there are no good solutions short of making a print and evaluating it.
The key point to all this is that when we look at sharpening on a display, 
we’re viewing it “through a glass, darkly” (though the Apostle Paul doubt-
less had something else in mind when he coined the phrase). At some fairly 
far-off future date, we may beneﬁ t from some technology that compensates 
for the large variation in the ways different displays show the same pixels’ 
sharpness, just as color management currently lets us compensate for the 
way different displays show the same pixels’ colors.
But that day won’t come soon. Until then, you’ll have to learn to make that 
compensation in your head. This is not trivial, but is it not impossible. First, 
you need to understand the size relationship between your pixels on screen 
and your pixels on output. Then it’s a matter of learning the behavior of 
your display, and making constant comparisons between what it shows you 
and what ends up in print, so that you gain experience as to what will work. 
Throughout the remainder of this book, we’ll provide pointers as to the 
kinds of things to look for.
SHARPENING ISSUES
As photographers and digital imaging artists, we are confronted by a variety 
of sharpening issues. Most prominent is the inevitable softening that 
occurs whenever we digitize, or turn a continuous stream of photons into 
discrete square pixels. No matter how good our lenses, no matter how high-
resolution our digital cameras or scanners, the digitization process always 
loses some apparent sharpness. 
In addition, there are the normal photographic aspects that impact sharp-
ness, such as camera or subject blur, lens diffraction, optical defects, and 
issues of ﬁ lm grain or sensor noise. 

IMAGE SOURCES
17
Further softening occurs on output, when we translate image pixels to printer 
dots. Each output process has its own requirements for sharpening—we must 
apply very different sharpening to the same pixels printed at 300 ppi on a con-
tinuous-tone printer than at 300 ppi on a 150-line screen halftone printer.
Last but not least are the issues presented by the image content itself. A for-
est of trees needs different sharpening treatment than a model’s headshot. 
Sharpening that emphasizes the ﬁ ne detail in the trees turns the model’s 
skin into a moonscape, while sharpening that emphasizes the model’s eyes 
and lips may obscure the detail in the forest. Somehow, we have to reconcile 
the various and often contradictory needs of the image source, the image 
content, and the output process. 
We’ll spend the rest of this chapter looking at these disparate demands in 
detail, because until they’re understood and addressed, sharpening won’t do 
justice to the image—and may actually do more harm than good.
IMAGE SOURCES
The image source imposes its own signature and its own limitations on the 
image. The signature is the relationship between the noise that we want to 
de-emphasize and the detail that we want to emphasize. The limitations are 
the degree to which the image can be enlarged and the smallest details that 
can be captured. 
In part, enlargement is limited by the gross pixel count, especially with 
digital captures. But the noise signature also plays a role—we typically scan 
ﬁ lm to obtain a signiﬁ cantly higher pixel count than digital captures offer, 
yet ﬁ lm scans cannot withstand as much enlargement as a digital capture of 
equivalent pixel dimensions. This is because digital captures generally have 
less noise than scanned ﬁ lm: The interaction between the ﬁ lm grain and the 
scanner’s pixel grid exaggerates the grain to produce a noise signature that’s 
stronger than noise from digital cameras.
NOTE: Much more 
heat than light has 
been generated in discussions 
of the equivalent information 
content of digital and fi lm 
captures. Without adding 
too much fuel to the fi re, our 
experience tells us that 35mm 
fi lm scanned at 6300 ppi 
(creating a fi le approximately 
8900 x 5700 pixels) has about 
the same potential for enlarge-
ment as a digital capture in 
the 6 to 8 megapixel range 
(approximately 3000-3500 x 
2000-2350 pixels). This is a very 
approximate rule of thumb.

CHAPTER 2: WHY DO WE SHARPEN?
18
DETAIL, FILM GRAIN, AND
SCANNER NOISE
A primary sharpening challenge lies in emphasizing detail without empha-
sizing noise. We can often accomplish this by simply protecting the noisy 
areas from sharpening. In more extreme cases, we may need to apply some 
noise reduction prior to sharpening. (We’ll discuss speciﬁ c techniques for 
doing both in Chapter 4, “Sharpening Tools.”)
Many of the techniques you’ll need to deploy depend on the ﬁ nal use of 
the image. Downsampling can hide a great deal of noise, making the image 
easier to sharpen, so for one-off uses at sizes that are small enough to allow 
downsampling by 50% or more, noise may be less of a concern. But as we 
approach the practical size limitations of the capture, the noise becomes ever 
more obvious and may need special handling. 
Scanned transparencies, scanned negatives, and digital captures all have 
their own noise characteristics. They share the property that noise increases 
with higher ISO (International Standards Organization) ratings, but they 
differ in important ways too. First, let’s look at scanned ﬁ lm.
Transparency Film Grain
The grain in scanned ﬁ lm becomes visually obvious at scanning resolutions 
far below that required to resolve individual grains. (Resolving individual 
grains would require scanning at ridiculously high resolutions of around 
11,000 ppi, providing no more usable image information than a lower-
resolution scan.)
Grain is most obvious in small formats like 35mm, and much less obvious 
in medium or large-format transparencies. However, much of the image 
noise comes not from the grain itself, but from the interaction of the grain, 
the scanner’s sampling grid, and any digital noise introduced by the scanner. 
The grain in color transparencies tends to be monochromatic, but the scan-
ner noise is typically strongest in the blue channel, since the blue ﬁ lter is 
the least efﬁ cient in terms of allowing light to pass through. As a result, 
transparency grain often shows up at its strongest in clear blue skies, though 
close examination of the pixels shows that the grain is present in the other 
channels, albeit to a lesser extent.

DETAIL, FILM GRAIN, AND SCANNER NOISE 
19
Figure 2-1 shows three views of typical scanned 35mm transparency noise:
• 
The ﬁ rst view is an attempt to show the actual image pixels, printed at 
72 ppi. Note, however, that the grain viewed on screen actually looks 
worse than the grain in print due to the softening effect of the halftone 
process.
• 
The second view is a “contact print” that reproduces the actual scanned 
pixels at 300 ppi, the optimal resolution for the 150-line screen with 
which this book is printed. This view represents the optimal enlarge-
ment one can reasonably attempt from this capture. (On many images, 
we can drop the resolution to 225 ppi, and hence make a bigger print, 
but ﬁ ne diagonal features will usually suffer.)
• 
The third view shows the entire image, still unsharpened, but down-
sampled to 300 ppi. The image appears reasonably sharp and more or 
less grain-free, due to the massive downsampling—the image is now 
only 16% of the original captured size.
Figure 2-2 shows noise reduction and sharpening for the image at the con-
tact print resolution. The sharpened version was created by applying noise 
reduction and preliminary sharpening, and selectively using layer masks to 
isolate the edges on the full-resolution 6300-ppi capture. The image was 
resized (but not resampled) to 300-ppi, and then sharpening was applied, 
which was tuned to the halftone printing process. 
For the downsampled image, the preliminary sharpening and noise reduction 
for the optimally sharpened version were performed on the full-resolution 
6300-ppi capture. Then the image was downsampled to 300 ppi using 
Photoshop’s Bicubic Sharper algorithm and sharpened for the halftone process.
The differences between Figures 2-1 and 2-2 are much more subtle on the 
downsampled version than they are in the contact print, reinforcing the 
point that ﬁ nal output size makes a big difference. Also, note how crunchy 
and oversharpened the zoomed-in view appears. If one were sharpening by 
eye, it’s unlikely that one would be willing to take the sharpening and noise 
reduction this far.

Figure 2-3 shows the individual color channels of the unsharpened scan in 
the same Actual Pixels view as the ﬁ rst illustration in Figure 2-1, and how 
dramatically noisier the blue channel is than the red or green. This is more a 
function of scanner noise than ﬁ lm grain. The blue tricolor separation ﬁ lters 
in most scanners are terribly inefﬁ cient and absorb a lot of light, so less light 
is gathered in the blue channel of the ﬁ lm scan. The purpose of the ﬁ gure is 
to convey an impression of typical grain in a transparency scan, and to show 
its diminishing inﬂ uence as we reduce the image size.

Color Negative Film Grain
Grain is typically much more obvious in scanned color negatives than in 
scanned transparencies. It’s not that color negative material is inherently 
grainier than transparencies, but color negatives record a wide dynamic 
range from the scene and compress it into a narrow dynamic range on ﬁ lm. 
When we scan the less contrasty negative ﬁ lm, we expand that narrow 
dynamic range recorded on the negative ﬁ lm using tone curves. In so doing, 
we exaggerate the grain more than we do with color transparencies.
As with a color transparency, noise is a product of the ﬁ lm grain, the scanner’s 
sampling grid, and the noise introduced by the scanner. However, the color 
negative’s noise signature is noticeably different from that of transparency 
ﬁ lm. Noise in color negatives manifests itself as color noise rather than 
monochromatic noise, and thus demands a different treatment.
Moreover, while the degree to which we have to address grain separately 
from sharpening depends on the enlargement factor needed, just as it does 
with transparency ﬁ lm, color negative requires more aggressive treatment, 
and requires it at lower enlargement factors, than transparency ﬁ lm.
Figure 2-4 shows the typical noise before sharpening from a 35mm color 
negative scanned at 6300 ppi, using the same view sizing as Figure 2-1:
• 
The ﬁ rst image is an Actual Pixels view printed at 72 ppi. Again, 
remember that the on-screen appearance is a little worse than the print 
you see here due to the softening effect of the halftone process.
• 
The second image is a contact print view showing a snippet of the 
image made by printing the captured pixels at 300 ppi—the full-sized 
image would be around 20" x 30".
• 
The third image is the full image downsampled to 300 ppi.
The extreme downsampling to 300 ppi in the bottom image mitigates the 
grain by downsampling the grain almost out of existence. But the contact 
print view shows that grain in color negative scans is stronger and a bigger 
problem than that in transparency scans, and hence requires special handling 
at lower magniﬁ cation factors than color transparencies. 
As a result, traditional prepress has generally shunned color negatives in 
favor of transparencies, no matter the ﬁ lm format. Reproducing images 
from 35mm color negative is certainly challenging, but it’s by no means 

CHAPTER 2: WHY DO WE SHARPEN?
24
impossible to produce good results. Shooting larger-format ﬁ lm reduces the 
grain problem by reducing the enlargement factor, which is why prepress 
has generally preferred the larger formats.

the unsharpened pixels from a

in scanned color negatives 

DETAIL, NOISE, AND  DIGITAL CAPTURE
27
Figure 2-6 shows the actual pixels from the individual channels. Again, the 
blue channel is the noisiest of the three due to the physics of the scanner, 
but the color negative shows more noise in the green and blue channels than 
the transparency shows. This increased noise (or grain) is a function of the 
increase of the contrast of lower contrast color negative material with a ﬁ nal 
tone curve applied.
With the color negative, the difference between the two versions is more 
obvious than with the transparency example, even in the downsampled ver-
sion. So clearly, grain is a more pressing concern with color negative than 
with transparency, though it varies with enlargement factor.
DETAIL, NOISE, AND
DIGITAL CAPTURE
Noise in digital captures differs from the noise in scanned ﬁ lm in several 
important ways. But before examining the differences in detail, we should 
point out that several different technologies, each with its own properties, 
get lumped into the “digital camera” general category. There are Bayer array 
cameras used in DSLR and medium-format cameras and scanning-back 
cameras. The primary type we’ll be discussing is the Bayer array type, as 
shown later in Figure 2-7.
Sensor Types
Depending on whom you talk to, there will always be a debate on the relative 
merits of CCD (charge-coupled device) sensors versus CMOS (complimen-
tary metal-oxide semiconductor) camera sensors. Their fundamental difference 
lies in the manner of manufacturing. CMOS sensors are made just like any 
other integrated circuit and can be produced for less cost than the more 
exotic (and expensive) manner of manufacturing CCDs. 
CCD and CMOS sensors also operate slightly differently:
• 
A CCD captures photons on the capacitor array (the photoactive photo 
site region, or the photosensitive part of the sensor), causing each capac-
itor to accumulate an electric charge in proportion to the amount of 
light falling in that region. Once the capacitor array captures the charge, 
a control circuit causes each capacitor to transfer the charge to the 

CHAPTER 2: WHY DO WE SHARPEN?
28
coupled transmission region. The controlling circuit converts the entire 
semiconductor contents of the array to a sequence of voltages, which is 
recorded to memory (or disk).
• 
A CMOS is a broader class of integrated circuit that is used in a 
variety of microprocessors, static RAM, and other digital logic circuits. 
CMOS circuits use a combination of P-type and N-type metal-oxide-
semiconductor ﬁ eld-effect transistors (MOSFETs) to implement logic 
gates in signal-processing equipment such as camera sensors. The 
MOSFET is used to amplify or switch electronic signals. When on but 
static, CMOS sensors generate less heat and consume and dissipate less 
power than CCD sensors.
Which Is Better, CCD or CMOS?
Neither sensor type is perfect. Both are generally Bayer fi lter mosaics in digital 
camera use. However, the Foveon X3 sensor uses three stacked active pixel 
sensors, utilizing the sensor’s silicon itself as the color fi lter, based on the wave-
length-dependent absorption of light in silicon. Large-format digital camera 
backs, such as the BetterLight (www.betterlight.com), use a scanning trilinear 
array instead of a Bayer pattern (explained in Figure 2-7). The downside is that 
the array must travel the width of the capture area, which takes time, but the 
upside is that no demosaicing is required.
The vast majority of digital cameras, whether point-and-shoot or digital 
SLRs, are color ﬁ lter array (CFA) cameras. In a CFA camera, each photo site, 
or sensel, on the sensor is covered by a color ﬁ lter and contributes a single 
pixel to one color channel. The “missing” color information is then interpo-
lated from the neighboring pixels in a process known as demosaicing. 
Figure 2-7 shows a typical Bayer pattern CFA, in which each photosensor 
is ﬁ ltered so that it captures only a single color of light: red, green, or blue. 
Twice as many green ﬁ lters are used as red or blue, because our eyes are 
most sensitive to green light.
When you shoot JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group, which was the 
name of the committee that created it) or TIFF (Tagged Image File Format), 
the demosaicing is performed in the camera using the camera vendor’s pro-
prietary routines. When you shoot in the raw image format, the demosaicing 
is done by the raw converter, which typically offers more control. 

DETAIL, NOISE, AND DIGITAL CAPTURE 
29
Figure 2-7 A typical Bayer 
pattern color fi lter array 
Demosaicing is a complex process that inevitably involves a trade-off 
between localized contrast (which looks a lot like sharpening) and anti-
aliasing (which looks like blurring), to prevent artifacts that arise when a 
detail in the image falls on only one color of pixel. Many cameras include 
an optical low-pass ﬁ lter to reduce artifacts, but the raw converter, whether 
in the camera or in post-capture software, performs a signiﬁ cant role, so 
one raw converter’s output with “no sharpening” may appear sharper than 
another raw converter also set to no sharpening. Similarly, while most raw 
converters offer some noise reduction, the actual results may differ.
 
NOTE: Most all DSLR cameras contain a piece of glass called an anti-aliasing (AA), or 
optical low-pass blur, fi lter to prevent Moiré patterns. Moiré patterns are repeating 
light and dark bands (that often introduce colors) that may occur when photographing a 
repeating pattern or texture. Moiré patterns can appear when the sampling resolution (the 
sensor) approaches the frequency of the captured signal. To reduce or eliminate this digital 
artifact, camera manufacturers add AA fi lters to soften or blur the high-frequency image 
data. Removal of the AA fi lter can increase the apparent sharpness of the sensor, yet at the 
risk of having a lot of potential Moiré patterns in your captures. While not suggested for 
most common uses, companies such as LPD (www.maxmax.com) can remove one or more 
of the AA fi lters and increase the sensors’ sharpness. LPD can also remove a camera’s infrared 
fi lter, thus giving a false-color infrared camera whose color rendering is unnatural and 
unique. Note that removing fi lters voids a camera’s warranty, so you may end up with a 
limited-purpose digital camera.
Figure 2-8 shows an array of digital captures from a variety of Bayer array 
cameras. The cameras include a Canon EOS-1Ds Mark III, a Canon EOS 
Digital Rebel XTi, a Fuji FinePix A820, a Phase One P65+ 6x4.5 camera 
back, and an Apple iPhone. The captures were all brought into Adobe 
Photoshop Camera Raw 5.3 for processing and slight cropping (to hide

which image came from which camera). The ﬁ gures were then resampled 
using Bicubic Sharper to match the same width, and then output sharpen-
ing was applied. When looking at the images reproduced in the book, try to 
determine which camera produced which image.

DETAIL, NOISE, AND DIGITAL CAPTURE 
31
As long as the size of the image capture provides resolution that is above the 
threshold needed for reproduction, even an Apple iPhone can produce a rea-
sonable image. However, the size will be severely restricted due to limited 
resolution. In Figure 2-9, we reveal which capture came from which camera 
by reproducing a “contact print” of a 2.5" x 2" section of the capture at 300 
ppi. This will show how a 60MP P65+ medium-format capture compares 
to a 1.9MP iPhone. 
As you can see, the capture from a P65+ back has a lot more resolution than 
the iPhone. Though it must be said: Properly handled, the iPhone does a 
decent job of capturing an image, as long as you don’t have unreasonable 
expectations from a 1.9MP camera phone.
To better understand the relative usable image sizes, here are the repro-
duction sizes, uncropped, that each of the cameras can produce without 
upsampling:
• 
iPhone: 4" x 5.3"
• 
Fuji FinePix A820: 8.2" x 11"
• 
Canon EOS Digital Rebel XTi: 10.8" x 16.2" 
• 
Canon EOS-1Ds Mark III: 15.6" x 23.4"
• 
Phase One P65+ camera back: 28" x 37.4"
Clearly, one doesn’t expect a capture from a $199 Apple iPhone to equal a 
capture from a $39,990 digital back, particularly when evaluating the maxi-
mum reproduction size of a capture. Figure 2-10 shows a small section of 
each capture at a Photoshop screen zoom of 400% to illustrate the real dif-
ference in the captures’ effective resolutions.

The other difference in this camera comparison is that of the ﬁ ve cameras, 
only the iPhone and the Fuji FinePix can capture only JPEG ﬁ le formats. 
The other cameras can capture raw ﬁ les that allow substantially more post-
processing, including image sharpening and noise reduction. Both of the 
JPEG-only cameras apply a dose of sharpening and probably some noise 
reduction in the analog to digital conversion. 
Cameras that shoot JPEG present an additional issue: The nature of JPEG 
compression creates 8-by-8-pixel blocks that can become visually obvious 
after editing or, at high ISO ratings, before editing. 
Sensor Noise
Sensor noise is present in every digital capture because it’s an unavoidable 
phenomenon of the way digital sensors capture light. If you have enough 
light for an optimal exposure, the ratio of signal (real image data) to noise 
may be so good that the noise is not perceptible. As you push the limits of 
your camera to capture a scene with low light levels, long exposures, and/or 
higher ISO ampliﬁ cation (or gain), the ratio of signal to noise will decrease, 
and you will experience visible noise in the image. Many technological fac-
tors (usually proportional to the cost) have an effect on the amount of noise 
created by a particular sensor, but you cannot eliminate it.
There are two main types of sensor noise: random noise (or pseudo-random 
noise following a Poisson distribution) and pattern noise. Pattern noise can 
often be substantially reduced by computational methods. Random noise 
really can’t be eliminated, although low-level blurring can reduce it.

CHAPTER 2: WHY DO WE SHARPEN?

ISO and Sensor Noise
Increasing a camera’s ISO setting increases the amplifi cation applied to the 
sensor’s captured signal, thereby increasing perceptible shot noise, early-
stage electronic read noise, and thermal noise. The amplifi ers themselves may 
also contribute some noise of their own, thus adding to the total read noise 
present in the fi nal image. Consequently, increasing the ISO results in noisier-
looking images, particularly in the shadow areas where the SNR ratio is lowest. 
Ironically, while the noise is amplifi ed (and images appear noisier), the actual 
noise signature in a high-ISO capture is essentially the same as at a lower 
ISO—it’s just made more visible by the amplifi cation and thus considered 
objectionable.
The better the sensor design and light gathering effi  ciency, the better the 
noise signature of a given camera will be. There have been great strides in 
recent years in the substantial improvement of light gathering effi  ciency by 
reducing the wasted space surrounding sensor photo sites, as well as develop-
ing light-gathering microlenses. Recent cameras such as the Nikon D3 have 
even claimed to off er up to ISO 25,600. However, these extended ISO settings 
are not implemented through true analog hardware amplifi cation as described 
above, but instead through digital gains (equivalent to pushing the Exposure 
control in post-processing by +1 or +2 stops). Even so, the highest real ISO 
of the D3 (using hardware amplifi cation) is 6400, which is remarkable and 
very usable in practice. Recent Canon cameras such as the 5D Mark II have 
increased the highest available real ISO to 3200, just a stop behind Nikon.
If this discussion of sensor noise made your eyes glaze over, here’s the main 
takeaway: To a certain degree, sensor noise will always be there. The higher 
the ISO setting on the camera, the more the noise will become perceptible. 
With a given camera, the noise may become objectionable at some higher ISO 
settings and lead you toward wanting to do something to reduce the appar-
ent noise. The manner of dealing with the various sensor noises usually breaks 
down into color noise and luminance noise reduction, and will depend entirely 
on what application you are using. Camera Raw and Adobe Lightroom have 
separate noise controls for color and luminance. Photoshop’s Reduce Noise 
fi lter also has separate controls as well as adjustments for detail preservation. 
Reduce Noise also enables you to use diff erent levels of noise reduction on a 
per-channel basis. 

DETAIL, NOISE, AND DIGITAL CAPTURE 
35
To show these two noise types in Figure 2-11, captures were made with the 
Canon 10D at ISO 100 and processed in Camera Raw. To make the noise 
more visible, a levels adjustment was made.
There are three common causes of sensor noise, and it’s useful to make the 
distinction between the noise type and its cause:
•
Shot noise (or photon noise) is a quantum effect of light and time. An 
image sensor photo site, the photosensitive part of the sensor, counts 
the stream photons that strike it over a particular period of time, but 
the light from a scene does not arrive at the sensor in an even regular 
stream. When you expose the sensor for a short period of time (in ratio 
to the total number of photons), the lack of regularity in the stream 
will create ﬂ uctuations in the photon count, causing random noise. 
The more photons that strike a sensor during exposure, the higher the 
signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio, and the less the amount of perceived noise. 
Sensors with larger pixels, like those found on full-frame DSLRs or 
medium-format digital camera backs, gather more photons per pixel (in 
other words, each pixel is more efﬁ cient) and hence produce images with 
less perceived shot noise. Since shot noise is a fundamental property of

light, even images captured by a theoretically perfect sensor would still 
have some shot noise. 
•
Read noise (or readout noise) is a combination of noise components 
inherent in the sensor electronics that convert the stored sensor charge 
into digital data (zeros and ones). Read noise often contains ﬁ xed-
pattern and random components. Fixed-pattern read noise is the more 
visually objectionable of the two, often showing up in images as hori-
zontal or vertical lines, or other easily seen patterns. Fortunately, most 
of the ﬁ xed-pattern noise can be eliminated through so-called “black 
subtraction” or “black frame subtraction” methods. Some cameras actu-
ally perform this step in hardware prior to writing the raw ﬁ le to the 
memory card.
•
Dark noise (or thermal noise) is caused primarily by the heat energy in 
the sensor itself being converted into a digitized signal. Like read noise, 
dark noise also tends to have random and ﬁ xed-pattern components. 
In some cases, the ﬁ xed pattern is related to the position of various 
electronics around the sensor and can lead to one part of the image 
being considerably noisier than other areas; this unpleasant effect can be 
reduced by the same dark exposure subtraction methods used for pat-
terned readout noise. Very high-end astronomical cameras and some 
medium-format backs use cooling systems to reduce or eliminate ther-
mal noise, though this is very expensive and can be quite bulky.
NOISE REDUCTION
We’ll cover noise-reduction strategies and techniques in later chapters, but 
it’s useful to note that most noise reduction in raw or post-processing is dealt 
with by separating chroma or color noise separately from luminance noise.
Color Noise
All CFA cameras suffer from color noise to a greater or lesser degree. Color 
noise can appear in highlights, shadows, or midtones, though it is usually 
more visible in the shadows and at higher ISO settings. The visual charac-
teristics of the color noise vary from camera to camera, depending on the 
sensor’s color ﬁ lters and analog-to-digital hardware.

NOISE REDUCTION
37
Color noise in JPEGs, discussed below, can be more problematic. The 
in-camera conversion doesn’t always do a good job of eliminating color 
noise, and the JPEG compression process tends to accentuate any color 
noise that isn’t eliminated in the in-camera conversion.
Figure 2-12 shows color noise from a digital raw capture made at ISO 3200. 
The capture is from an older camera, a Canon EOS 10D, to better show the 
color noise. Recent cameras exhibit better color noise reduction as part of 
the analog to digital conversion.

color noise reduction

reduction set to 50 in Camera Raw
Luminance Noise
Like color noise, luminance noise varies with both ISO speed and 
exposure. Underexposed digital captures are much more prone to noise, 
particularly in the shadows, than underexposed ﬁ lm captures. It’s quite 
possible (and rather likely) that a well-exposed ISO 1600 digital capture may 
be less noisy than a very underexposed ISO 100 digital capture. Figure 2-13 
shows examples of the noise signature of the same poor old Canon EOS 
10D. We tend to use this camera a lot for demos needing really bad noise 
(because the camera is so good at producing noise). Recent Canon cameras, 
however, have improved their noise signatures tremendously, and that’s 
what we shoot real images with!

NOISE REDUCTION
39
Each of the raw ﬁ les in Figure 2-13 were processed in Camera Raw 5.3 with 
the default Detail panel settings of zero luminance noise reduction and 25 
color noise reduction. The noise, when viewed at a 400% zoom, is obvious 
and objectionable at ISO 800 and above. But what exactly are you seeing 
when zoomed into 400% in Photoshop? It’s visual science ﬁ ction. Remember 
that a computer display is a low-resolution device that shows views of an 
image that are either greatly exaggerated in size or substantially lowered in 
resolution. What you see on the display is not going to be what you get in 
ﬁ nal reproduction unless the display is the ﬁ nal destination. Even then, an 
image would likely have to be downsampled substantially, which acts as its 
own noise-reduction agent.
Figure 2-14 shows that noise is size sensitive. The ﬁ rst image shows the 
same 400% zoom after both color and noise reduction have been applied, and 
the second image shows the reduced noise image when at contact print size.

print size
While the contact print in Figure 2-14 still shows evidence of higher ISO 
noise, the noise reduction certainly mitigates how objectionable the noise 
would be if the overall image were reproduced at the capture’s native size, 
which would be 10.2" x 6.8" at 300 ppi. If the image were downsampled, 
the noise would become virtually invisible. Figure 2-15 shows both the ISO 
100 and the ISO 3200 reduced to 50% of the original size, as well as the full 
crop of the ISO 3200 at about 30% of the original size.

CHAPTER 2: WHY DO WE SHARPEN?
40
The main point to be made when considering high-ISO noise and noise-
reduction techniques is at what point is noise relevant or irrelevant? Looking 
at an image at 100-400% zoom in Photoshop does not give you a realistic 
(nor particularly useful) view of your image’s noise signature for print. 
Zooming out to 25-50% can give you a more realistic representation, albeit 
in much lower resolution than your printer can print. 
Some raw converters, particularly those from camera vendors, have a ten-
dency to bury shadow noise by simply clipping shadows to black, but it’s 
usually worthwhile addressing luminance noise in the raw converter when 
you shoot raw. At very high ISO speeds, however, a dedicated third-party 
noise removal tool may be needed to get the best rendering.

Luminance noise in high-ISO JPEGs should always be addressed before 
sharpening, and any remaining noise should be protected from sharpening, 
otherwise it will simply become more obvious. We’ll discuss speciﬁ c tech-
niques for doing so in Chapter 5.
Noise, Exposure, and ETTR
There are photographic exposure techniques that can help reduce noise and 
improve the signal even before doing the image processing. The concept 
of  “expose to the right” (ETTR) has received considerable discussion and 
debate. One of the ﬁ rst people to have written about ETTR was Michael 
Reichmann, who manages and writes for the Luminous Landscape website 
(www.luminous-landscape.com). A lot of people tend to misunderstand the 
instructions or misconstrue the reasoning behind the ETTR concept. While 
in practice the intent is to increase the overall exposure in a digital capture, 
the increase is not designed to be an overexposure, but rather a correct 
exposure for the scene.
The ﬁ rst tenet of ETTR is that in order to even engage in the practice, you 
must understand the implications of the scene contrast range and how it 
ﬁ ts into the dynamic range of your sensor. If you are shooting on a bright 
sunny day with lots of light and deep shadows, don’t even think about 
ETTR. However, if you are shooting a scene that has low contrast and all 
of the tonality you want to capture falls within the 10 to 12 stops (or more) 
that today’s sensor can capture, you will get a better signal-to-noise ratio if 
you move the histogram to the right by increasing the exposure. You can do 
this either manually by opening up the aperture or using a slower shutter 
speed, or by setting the exposure compensation in your camera to increase 
the exposure. How much you may want to increase the exposure (expose 
to move the histogram to the right) depends entirely on the scene contrast 
range and your dynamic range of the sensor. But if the contrast range is 
only six to seven stops, you can probably increase the exposure compensa-
tion one to two stops without fear of actual tone clipping (driving tones 
to saturation).
You should also take your camera’s overexposure warning with a degree of 
skepticism. Most of these warnings will be at least one full stop conserva-
tive, which will tend to induce you to ETTL (expose to the left, resulting in 
wasted signal).

CHAPTER 2: WHY DO WE SHARPEN?
42
Figure 2-16 shows three exposures and their Camera Raw histograms 
before and after normalizing the image adjustment settings in Camera Raw. 
The images were shot with a Canon EOS-1Ds Mark III at ISO 400. The 
camera was set to auto-bracket exposure by the camera for normal, under 
1.33, and over 1.33 stops. The F-stop was F/11 and the shutter speed was 
used to vary the exposures from 1/320, 1/125, and 1/50 of a second. 
There are several points to note about the before and after in the image 
adjustments. First, it can be argued that even the “normal” exposure was 
actually a slight underexposure by the camera meter. In Camera Raw, 
the normal needed a .20 Exposure increase. Also, the normal and under-
exposure had shadow clipping before adjustment that was eliminated by 
increasing or moving the levels to the right. The overexposure is indicating 
potential highlight clipping, which is eliminated in the after adjustments by 
moving the levels to the left. 
All three of the post-adjustment histograms are very similar, as might be 
expected since care was given to make the image adjustments so all three 
exposures ended up alike. There was no noise reduction applied in Camera 
Raw, but the capture sharpening was optimized and the color noise reduc-
tion was at default. The images were output sharpened after downsampling 
with Photoshop’s Bicubic Sharper.
While the original scene contrast wasn’t measured, the estimated range was 
eight to nine stops. Considering the 1Ds Mark III has arguably 10-11 stops 
of dynamic range, a +1.33 exposure compensation really wasn’t putting 
highlight texture at much risk of being clipped.
So, this shows that three different exposures can be normalized by an expe-
rienced Camera Raw user, which is all well and good, but what about the 
SNR ratio? Does this prove that ETTR is useful in producing a better signal 
(image) with less noise? Yes. Figure 2-17 shows the ETTR results up close.

CHAPTER 2: WHY DO WE SHARPEN?
44
As you can see, the underexposed image suffered from a substantial increase 
in perceptible noise after the required image adjustments were applied. This 
is a typical result of trying to substantially lighten digital captures and a very 
good reason not to underexpose if at all possible. Even the normal exposure 
has a slight noise that might be expected with an ISO of 400 and a small 
increase in exposure. What is notable is that the +1.33 image, the ETTR 
one, has a superior signal to noise ratio. Why?
Some people may think that due to the linear nature of raw digital captures, 
that more levels are contained in the brightest portions of the exposure. For 
a 12-bit capture, the brightest stop of data contains 2048 levels of data. Each 
step down reduces the data levels by half. When you end up in the lower 
exposure areas, you end up with very few levels of data.
However, if you understand what noise is and what causes it, you’ll real-
ize that simply increasing the number of photons your sensor captures will 
increase the SNR ratio (and reduce the noise in the capture). Opening the 
aperture or using a slower shutter speed allows the sensor to gather more 
light, and that’s why there’s less noise. As long as the increased exposure

doesn’t lead to highlight texture clipping, you improve the image quality by 
increasing the exposure.
You’ll note that we don’t say to increase your ISO when trying to deploy 
ETTR. Increasing the ISO does indeed increase the ampliﬁ cation of the 
analog to digital converter, but it doesn’t magically add a bunch of photons 
to the capture. Whether you shoot at ISO 100 or ISO 3200, the amount of 
light available in a given set of exposure parameters remains constant. It is 
the amount of light—the number of photons—that dictates the actual noise. 
If you increase the photon count, you increase the SNR ratio.
In practice, there may indeed be situations where increasing your ISO is 
useful and more than compensates for the increase in noise. If you are 
locked into a certain aperture and shutter speed, increasing the ISO will 
have the effect of moving at least the shadow regions of the image to the 
right and improving the shadow’s SNR ratio. However, the increase in the 
SNR in the shadows yields less and less beneﬁ t as you increase the ISO. 
Going from ISO 100 to 200 will improve the shadow SNR, while going 
from ISO 1600 to 3200 probably won’t return much value. You should 
test your own camera to determine where the sweet spot is for increasing 
shadow SNR via ISO boosts. The odds are that going much past ISO 400 
will offer diminishing returns or add additional problems in other regions 
of the image.
Noise, Detail, and Enlargement
We’ve seen that the inﬂ uence of the image source decreases with down-
sampling, particularly the issue of noise. The converse is also true. When 
we enlarge digital captures past their native resolution, noise reduction and 
localized sharpening become increasingly more important as the enlarge-
ment factor increases.
The degree to which we can enlarge digital captures depends in part on the 
image quality and content. Images with soft detail can generally withstand 
more enlargement than those with lots of ﬁ ne detail. (We’ll look at image 
content issues in greater detail later in this chapter.) Images that have excel-
lent image quality, such as lower noise, no camera shake, and proper expo-
sure, can still be successfully enlarged.
The images shown in Figure 2-15 contain ﬁ ne detail. But if the demands of 
the reproduction require it, they can, with care, easily be enlarged by 200%. 

CHAPTER 2: WHY DO WE SHARPEN?
46
However, the lower the noise, the better the upsampled result will be, 
because upsampling noise just makes bigger noise. The key is ﬁ rst to apply 
appropriate noise reduction. The ISO 100 image is relatively clean, but the 
ISO 400 image needs noise reduction prior to upsampling.
Figure 2-18 shows the ISO 100 and ISO 400 images before and after 
upsampling 200% using Photoshop’s Bicubic Smoother interpolation. What 
you are seeing is the native resolution images shown at an 800% zoom while 
the upsampled images are shown at 400% zoom. This is to compare the 
before and after upsampled images at the same dimensions.
Neither the ISO 100 nor ISO 400 images had substantial noise reduction 
applied (except the default color noise reduction) prior to upsampling. You 
can see that Bicubic Smoother did a good job of creating pixels and elimi-
nating the pixilated look of the 800% zoom. However, the ISO 400 image’s

noise did not interpolate well. It would have been optimal to apply noise 
reduction prior to upsampling to help keep the noise from being factored 
into the algorithm. Even the ISO 100 image should have had some level of 
noise reduction applied prior to upsampling.
Figure 2-19 shows the result of having already applied a round of noise 
reduction to the ISO 400 image prior to upsampling in Photoshop.
As you can see, there is a substantial improvement in the post upsampling if 
the noise reduction is applied prior to resampling. Noise reduction will be 
covered in more detail later, but it’s pretty clear that noise can cause image 
problems and must be addressed as far upstream in the image-processing 
pipeline as possible.
JPEG and Noise
When we shoot raw, the raw converter offers a good deal of control over 
sharpening and noise reduction. When we shoot JPEG, however, we simply 
have to work with what the camera gives us. Most cameras offer settings for 
JPEG quality, size, and sharpness, but few, if any, offer control over noise 
reduction.
It’s much easier to deal with noise that hasn’t been sharpened in the camera 
than it is to de-emphasize it after the fact, so we generally recommend leav-
ing any in-camera sharpening turned off (see the sidebar, “Why Camera 
Vendors Offer In-Camera Sharpening”).

CHAPTER 2: WHY DO WE SHARPEN?
48
Why Camera Vendors Off er In-Camera Sharpening
Camera vendors off er in-camera sharpening to play to two very diff erent audi-
ences: consumers who use point-and-shoot cameras and pros who are com-
pelled to shoot JPEG for speed reasons. 
Most consumers don’t have access to sophisticated sharpening tools and tech-
niques like the ones we discuss in this book, and would be dismayed to fi nd 
that all of their images looked softer than those from a point-and-shoot fi lm 
camera, which their current digital point-and-shoot probably replaced (and 
were designed to emulate). 
Pros who shoot JPEG typically do so because time pressures (both in shooting 
and in processing) prevent them from shooting raw. Many photojournalists 
and wedding photographers fall into this category. In-camera sharpening pro-
duces reasonable (though hardly ever optimal) results with no substantial user 
intervention, and thus allows them to deliver their images in a timely fashion.
But in-camera sharpening is a global, one-size-fi ts-all process. If the fi nal use 
is a small-size reproduction, it may be good enough, but if you want optimal 
sharpening using the techniques described in this book, and you have to 
shoot JPEG, we recommend that you turn off  in-camera sharpening and do 
the sharpening in post-processing.
JPEG presents special challenges, not just because of the relative lack of 
control it offers over raw, but also due to the nature of JPEG compression. 
JPEG attempts to produce “visually lossless” compression, and at low com-
pression settings (such as the typical JPEG Fine that’s offered by most digital 
cameras) you may be hard-pressed to tell the difference between a JPEG and 
a raw capture simply by looking at them side by side. Figure 2-20 shows just 
such a comparison.
The JPEG is the left image in Figure 2-20, the raw is on the right. Both 
were sharpened identically and printed at 300 ppi. The two versions have 
small differences in tonality and color balance, but they’re extremely similar 
in terms of sharpness and detail.

NOISE REDUCTION
49
However, Figure 2-20 represents something of a best-case scenario. Both 
images were well exposed and shot at ISO 100. At higher speeds or with 
underexposed images, the relative inﬂ exibility of JPEG becomes more 
apparent, with increased noise and, at higher ISO speeds, some magenta-
green color artifacts.
Figure 2-21 shows what JPEG compression does to colors when the JPEG 
compression is encoded. JPEG compression tries to preserve the luminance 
information of the image while compressing the heck out of the color infor-
mation. Not all JPEG compression is lossy, resulting in some degree of 
image degradation, but the JPEG compression used in cameras to produce 
JPEGs is. The compression uses blocks (called Minimum Coded Units, or 
MCUs), usually 16 x 16 pixels, and does substantial chroma subsampling 
(compression). The end result: Color gradients and noise are the compo-
nents of an image that suffer the most with JPEG encoding.
The example shown in Figure 2-21 is done speciﬁ cally to highlight what 
JPEG encoding compression does to colors and gradients. Obviously this is 
a radical example designed to show very bad results. But it’s useful to show 
this so you understand, at the camera level, what’s going on when you capture 
JPEG. Obviously the camera JPEG won’t have this dramatic degradation, 
but there is some, and the color space conversion and gamma encoding 
prior to JPEG compression mean that the resulting ﬁ le has substantially less 
editing headroom than the raw ﬁ le would.

JPEG and ISO Speed
JPEG captures shot at low ISO ratings are relatively well behaved. But at higher speeds, they become progres-
sively more diffi  cult to handle. Figure 2-22 shows two JPEGs, one at ISO 100 and the other at ISO 800. There 
is also an image shot raw at ISO 100 and one at ISO 800. For the raw processed images, optimal sharpening 
was done in Camera Raw. The ISO 800 image had luminance noise reduction of 20, and the default color noise 
reduction for each was 25. The processed images were then output sharpened. For the JPEG versions, only 
output sharpening was done.

Figure 2-22 JPEG and raw ISO speed comparison
At ISO 100, the diff erence between the JPEG and the raw image is pretty minimal. One might argue that the 
sharpening included in the original JPEG fi le plus output sharpening was too strong, but since the capture 
sharpening was baked in the JPEG, we would have had to modify the output sharpening to get an optimal 
result—which, as we’ll show throughout the rest of this book, should not be needed.
Where the raw and JPEG comparison really highlights the upside to raw and the downside of JPEG is at ISO 
800. Sharpening the already brittle JPEG with its stronger noise became a real problem compared to the 
smoother raw image. This is what we laughingly call “pixel-peeping”: zooming far into an image and becoming 
enraptured by pixels that are way outside of any reasonable visual reality. But it is useful to show what happens 
to your image even though it’s on a micro scale.

LENSES AND IMAGE QUALITY
Regardless of the camera and sensor you use to make captures, the lens 
stands between your subject and your sensor. The quality of the lens, 
how well its autofocus is aligned, lens diffraction due to aperture settings, 
whether you used a tripod or a fast shutter speed… all of these factors affect 
image quality. Image sharpening may or may not be able to help eliminate 
or reduce many of these factors’ effects on image quality. But if you are 
interested in achieving the maximum image quality your camera, lens, and 
sensor can deliver, you must address the following photographic factors 
before you make the capture.
Monochromatic Lens Aberrations 
Slapping a cheap lens on a high-resolution digital camera is a shame—
unless you want the creative effect of a digital Holga, a trendy camera with 
poor lenses. High-quality prime, ﬁ xed focal-length lenses will generally 
give better image quality than zoom lenses. But not all primes or zooms 
are equally good or bad. Individual copies of even expensive lenses can vary 
in their performance, so testing a new lens should be a mandatory exercise 
before buying one. 
The quality of a lens is generally based on how well various lens defects or 
aberrations are handled. The aberrations discussed in this section are all 
monochromatic, meaning they impact lens performance even for a single 
color of light. Chromatic aberrations (CAs), discussed in the next section, 
lead to image-forming problems with different colors of light.
There are three lens aberrations that directly impact image sharpness: 
spherical aberration, astigmatism, and coma. Spherical aberration affects the 
whole image, while astigmatism, coma, and curvature of ﬁ eld mostly affect 
the edges and corners. 
•
Spherical aberration is the inability of all light rays to focus at the same 
point. Rays at the edge (marginal rays) of the lens come to focus closer 
to the lens than do rays parallel to the axis or center (paraxial rays). 
This causes the focus to drift as you stop down the lens. Some lenses 
use aspheric elements to better correct spherical aberration at wide 
apertures.

LENSES AND IMAGE QUALITY
53
•
Astigmatism is the inability of the lens to bring to focus both vertical 
and horizontal lines on the same plane. It will appear that lines of equal 
density (darkness) are less dense horizontally or vertically. Stopping 
down the lens (using a smaller f-stop) can improve astigmatism.
•
Coma causes parallel oblique rays passing through a lens to be focused 
not as a point, but as a comet-shaped oval image. Stopping down the 
lens can improve coma.
•
Curvature of ﬁ eld is another lens aberration that can impact critical focus. 
Field curvature results in the image from the lens being formed as a 
curved surface, not ﬂ at. As a result, when the center of the image is in 
focus, the edges are not, and vice-versa. Stopping down the lens may 
improve the overall sharpness, but it won’t ﬁ x the ﬁ eld curvature. 
Figure 2-23 shows the impact of a curved ﬁ eld.
As you can see in Figure 2-23, a quality 50mm F1.4 prime lens is outper-
forming an inexpensive consumer-grade lens when it comes to ﬁ eld 
curvature. While stopping down (the same F/5.6 aperture was used on both 
lenses) would make some improvements, there is little one could do in post-
processing to make the cheap lens corners as sharp as the prime lens corners.
Another aberration that has less impact on image sharpness but does impact 
image quality is curvilinear distortion. This results in lens barrel distortion 
(convex), where straight lines are bowed out, or pincushion distortion (con-
cave), where straight lines are bowed inward. Photoshop’s Lens Correction 
plug-in corrects for this defect. There are also third-party utilities, such as 
DXO (www.dxo.com) or PTLens, that can ﬁ x even more lens problems.
Figure 2-24 shows a curvilinear distortion comparison between a 50mm 
prime lens and a consumer grade 28-135mm zoom lens. Depending on 
focal length, the zoom lens suffers from variable amounts of barrel distortion. 
However, this zoom lens does show good corner sharpness, so correcting 
to the distortion would be possible in Photoshop. You would lose part of 
the image due to the corrections, as shown in the Lens Correction dialog in 
Figure 2-24.

CHAPTER 2: WHY DO WE SHARPEN?
56
Chromatic Lens Aberrations
There are two types of chromatic aberration (CA), which differ from those 
before in that they impact lens performance with different colors of light: 
•
Longitudinal chromatic aberration is the inability of a lens to focus all 
wavelengths (colors) of light at the same plane on the lens axis. Shorter 
wavelengths come to focus in front of the focal plane, longer behind. 
This defect is not improved by stopping down the lens. This is normally 
noticeable only in cheaper, long telephoto lenses, and is reduced by the 
use of exotic glass elements, referred to as LD (low dispersion), ED 
(extra-low dispersion), AD (anomalous dispersion), and Fluorite. There 
is very little that can be done to correct this problem in post-processing.
•
Lateral chromatic aberration is the lateral displacement of color images at 
the focal plane. This type of aberration is caused by different sizes of 
images produced by different colors, even though the image is all on the 
same plane. This CA produces color fringing of red or blue, and it is not 
improved by stopping down. 
Lateral chromatic aberration is pretty easy to correct in post-processing, as 
shown in Figure 2-25. However, it’s best to ﬁ x any CA before performing 
noise reduction or sharpening, both of which will make CA removal later 
more difﬁ cult. The Chromatic Aberration correction feature in Camera 
Raw ﬁ xes CAs in the proper place in the raw processing pipeline, at the 
same time as sharpening and noise reduction.
Stopping Down a Lens: An Aberration Cure-All?
Stopping down a lens greatly reduces spherical aberration and coma. It has 
a small positive eff ect on astigmatism and fi eld curvature, but little or no 
eff ect on chromatic aberrations or distortion. So, it might be assumed that 
you should always just stop down to get better lens performance, right? Up 
to a point, this is true. Most lenses have a sweet spot where a given aperture 
provides an optimal image-forming capability. This optimal aperture is usually 
found when the lens is stopped down two to four stops from wide open. As a 
result, a fast lens with a very wide aperture such as F/1.4 will perform better at 
an aperture between F/2.8 and F/5.6. Stopping the lens down to F/8 or F/11 
probably will not degrade performance, but stopping way down to F/22 or 
F/32 will, due to lens diff raction.

CHAPTER 2: WHY DO WE SHARPEN?
58
Lens Diffraction
Not really a lens defect per se, because diffraction is a property of light, lens 
diffraction is caused by the slight bending of light rays as they pass by (or 
through) a sharp edge such as a lens aperture. The smaller the aperture, the 
greater the effect of the diffraction will be on the overall image-sharpness 
reduction. Figure 2-26 shows the impact of depth of ﬁ eld and lens diffraction.

PHOTOGRAPHIC ASPECTS OF  IMAGE QUALITY
59
In Figure 2-26, the 100% view shot at F/4.0 is sharp in the area of critical 
focus but suffers from limited depth of ﬁ eld. The F/11 shot shows good 
depth of ﬁ eld—the higher and lower coins are in sharp focus. But when 
the lens is stopped all the way down to F/32, the entire image gets softer 
because of lens diffraction. While sharpening may help reduce the softness 
of the lens at F/32, it would never match the real sharpness found in the 
image shot at F/11. 
Lens Flare
Lens ﬂ are can also have a negative impact on image quality by reduc-
ing contrast and color saturation, but it’s not really a typical lens defect in 
today’s high-performance multicoated lenses. Flare can still happen when 
using too many lens ﬁ lters, failing to use a lens shade, or, very commonly, 
simply having a dirty and grimy lens. 
Some people seem to think it’s a good idea to put a UV ﬁ lter on the front 
of a lens to protect it. While this does offer lens protection, it also cuts 
down on image quality, especially if it’s a cheap ﬁ lter without perfectly ﬂ at 
optical properties.
PHOTOGRAPHIC ASPECTS OF
IMAGE QUALITY
Remember the opening line of Chapter 1, about using a tripod if you want 
great prints? We said we were only half joking. Actually, we weren’t joking 
at all. Shooting a camera from atop a tripod is an excellent way of getting 
a very sharp image if slower shutter speeds are required for a given shot. 
Sure, a lens that offers image stabilization (IS) can help overcome having to 
hand-hold a longer lens at slower shutter speeds. But there’s no better way 
to reduce camera shake than setting your camera on a tripod, using a remote 
release, locking up the mirror, and setting a sandbag on top of everything to 
completely dampen vibration. 
Figure 2-27 shows a comparison of images taken using a tripod and using a 
hand-held camera. It’s pretty obvious that for optimal image quality, using 
a tripod and locking up the mirror (as well as using a shutter release and 
sandbag) can help substantially.

The best image sharpness in Figure 2-27 comes from the image shot on 
a tripod with the mirror locked up and a sandbag on the lens to further 
dampen any camera vibrations. Figure 2-28 shows a picture of Jeff shooting 
his 300mm F2.8 lens on a Canon EOS-1Ds Mark III on a tripod, mirror 
lockup and sandbag version.
Figure 2-28 Jeff  shooting on a tripod with a sandbag resting on the lens
What, you don’t want to have to carry a tripod and sandbag with you every-
where? We suppose that’s reasonable, and one can get an image that rivals 
shooting on a tripod with a fast enough shutter speed, as in the last image 
in Figure 2-27. To increase the shutter speed, Jeff increased the ISO from 
100 to 400. This allowed him to shorten the shutter speed from 1/320 of 
a second down to 1/1250 of a second. Combined with IS, this faster shut-
ter speed rivals the capture shot on a tripod without the mirror lockup and 
sandbag. The only downside is the increased perception of noise due to the 
higher ISO. But, it is a reasonable trade-off to increase the ISO in order to 
capture a sharper image. 
Even if you have a really good lens and are shooting with a fast shutter 
speed, if you rely upon autofocus, you are at the mercy of your equipment’s 
autofocus accuracy. Front or back focusing of a lens can kill image sharpness 
just as surely as using cheap lenses or slow shutter speeds. If the autofocus

misses the critical subject, you can’t save the image by sharpening (although 
some improvement can sometimes be accomplished). Figure 2-29 shows 
an overall image and two cropped captures showing missed focus and 
critical focus.

As good as Bruce and Jeff are at image sharpening, there’s simply nothing 
we could do to make the back-focused image look like the image whose 
critical focus is accurate. If your camera and lens combination constantly 
front- or back-focuses, you should send them in for repair because the 
problem can be corrected. Some newer cameras actually enable the user to 
do a focus correction based on the actual lens and save it in the camera.
To make the process of adjusting lenses easier, Michael Tapes of 
RawWorkﬂ ow.com has created a product called LensAlign that provides a 
lens calibration system. The object is to set the LensAlign unit on a tripod 
in front of your lens and camera, and have the autofocus system focus on 
the main target. Care must be given to setting the unit up so that the target 
is square to and a speciﬁ c distance from the camera. Then you shoot the 
target and inspect the lens ruler to discover at which point on the ruler the 
autofocus is focusing.
Figure 2-30 shows the result of an initial calibration shot and the result after 
adjusting the autofocus in the camera.

SHARPENING AND THE
IMAGE SOURCE
For the past 30 or so pages, we’ve shown examples of different image source 
types and their inﬂ uence on sharpening and noise reduction. In some cases 
the differences are painfully obvious, while in others, they are rather subtle. 
Rest assured that this was a conscious decision on our part!
What lessons can we draw from the preceding examples?
• 
The need to address the image source speciﬁ cally is not always clear-cut. 
In some cases, it may simply create extra work. In other cases, it’s abso-
lutely necessary if you want a usable image. Most real-world scenarios 
lie somewhere between these two extremes, but the better the funda-
mentals of the photography itself, the better the resulting image quality 
will be. There’s a reason why some people buy expensive lenses, or 
large- or medium-format cameras, and plop their cameras on tripods in 
the search for ultimate image quality. And sharpening those images for 
optimal output can be a lot easier.
• 
The degree of enlargement is a key factor in determining the need for 
applying noise reduction and sharpening to the high-resolution data. 
We’ve shown you extremes—such as making a 20" x 30" print from 
a 35mm original, and making a 4.3" x 3" print from the same 35mm 
original. With greater enlargement, the need for sharpening tailored to 
the source becomes more likely. But the point at which it becomes nec-
essary depends on both the source and the usage.
• 
With larger ﬁ lm formats or higher-resolution digital captures, the need 
to address grain and noise diminishes because the enlargement factor 
diminishes—unless, of course, you’re pushing the limits to make the 
largest prints possible. In that case, you’ll certainly get better results if 
you apply noise reduction and sharpening that is tailored speciﬁ cally to 
the image source before applying ﬁ nal sharpening for output.
• 
ISO speed, whether with ﬁ lm or with digital captures, also plays a criti-
cal role. The higher the speed, the more noise, so for any given medium 
or any given use, specialized treatment will be required sooner at high 
ISO speeds than at lower ones.
• 
Underexposed digital images contain more apparant noise, and hence 
are more likely to need special handling than underexposed ﬁ lm images.

SHARPENING AND IMAGE CONTENT
65
• 
The computer display can show you what is happening to the image 
pixels, but is a far-from-reliable guide to ﬁ nal printed appearance, 
because the size of the pixels on the display is typically much larger than 
the size of the pixels translated to print.
• 
Understanding all of these factors is key not only in learning how to 
apply sharpening tailored to the image source, but also in deciding 
whether and when to do so.
While it’s undoubtedly the most complex part of the whole equation, the 
image source is only one of the factors we need to understand and, in some 
cases, address when we sharpen. The next factor, and one that we always
have to address in sharpening, is the image content.
SHARPENING AND IMAGE CONTENT
While the range of inﬂ uence of the image source can be quite subtle, the 
inﬂ uence of the image content is quite obvious. In any given image, there 
exists a level of detail that we want to emphasize, but that level of detail 
varies from image to image. If we simply treat all images the same, we may 
end up either emphasizing unwanted detail or noise, or obscuring detail we 
really wanted to emphasize.
A “busy” image with lots of ﬁ ne detail, like the upper image in Figure 2-31, 
needs a much different treatment than one with soft detail, like the lower 
image in Figure 2-31. Both images have been sharpened with the content 
taken into account, and both images have received two passes of sharpening. 
The ﬁ rst pass matched the sharpening haloes to the size of the details we 
want to emphasize. The second pass was tailored to the 150-line halftone 
process. 
We’ll look at the whole question of multipass sharpening in much more 
detail in Chapter 3, “Sharpening Strategies,” but for the moment, let’s focus 
on the issue of matching sharpening radius to image content. The images in 
Figure 2-31 and the subsequent examples have all had identical sharpening 
applied in the second phase. The only difference is in the ﬁ rst sharpening pass. 
Special thanks to Martin Evening, who shot the image of Natasha that we’re 
using for the example of the softer detail.

SHARPENING AND IMAGE CONTENT
67
Low-Frequency and High-Frequency Images 
The top image in Figure 2-31 is known as a high-frequency image, because 
it has lots of sharp tonal transitions in a small area. The bottom image is of 
the type known as a low-frequency image, because the tone stays relatively 
constant over a given small area and the tonal transitions are gradual rather 
than sudden.
Many, if not most, images contain both high- and low-frequency compo-
nents, but in the vast majority of cases, there’s a single dominant tendency 
that we want to emphasize. If you’re willing to do a good deal of manual 
work, you can even sharpen low-frequency and high-frequency elements 
separately in a single image, but you can obtain good results with relatively 
little work by sharpening in the ﬁ rst pass for the dominant characteristics of 
the image.
To make the low-frequency/high-frequency distinction a little clearer, 
Figure 2-32 shows a theoretical single row of pixels from each image in 
Figure 2-31, graphed according to their tonal values. The high-frequency 
image has sudden jumps in tonal value spread across a relatively small area, 
which is another way of saying that the image has lots of narrow edges. The 
low-frequency image features much more gradual transitions spread over a 
much wider area, indicating that the image contains big, wide edges. 
Figure 2-33 shows an extreme example of what can happen if we apply the 
wrong sharpening in the ﬁ rst pass. For the high-frequency image of the 
trees, we used a radius of 1.5 pixels for the “incorrect” sharpening. For the 
low-frequency image, the radius amount was inverted, with the incorrect 
radius setting of .6 pixels. While coming from different image sources—the 
high-frequency image was from a Digital Rebel, and Martin’s shot from a 
1Ds Mark III—the optimal radius is dictated more by the edge width and 
frequency than by the image source.

High-frequency and 
low-frequency images

tonal transitions in a small area.
A low-frequency image has smooth tonal 
transitions spread across a large area.

CHAPTER 2: WHY DO WE SHARPEN?
68
Figure 2-33 High-frequency and low-frequency images with incorrect sharpening
In the left image in Figure 2-33, applying the wrong sharpening produces 
an image that actually has less textural detail. The wide sharpening haloes 
obscure some of the ﬁ ne detail instead of making it more obvious, and the 
image seems blocky—the opposite of the result we wanted!
In the right image, applying the wrong sharpening produces a more obvi-
ously unacceptable result. Even with a model with good skin and makeup, 
the skin looks like sandpaper because the incorrect sharpening has intro-
duced unwanted enhancement of the skin texture.
When we applied the wide-edge sharpening to the high-frequency image in 
Figure 2-33, we created sharpening haloes that were much wider than the 
details in the image, so it ended up looking soft and losing detail. When we 
applied the narrow-edge sharpening to the low-frequency image in Figure 
2-33, we emphasized the small tonal transitions that represented texture 
rather than edges, producing the sandpaper effect.
A casual glance at Figure 2-33 might lead us to conclude that the incorrectly 
sharpened left image is undersharpened, while the incorrectly sharpened 
right image is oversharpened. In actuality, it’s not the quantity, but the quality,
of sharpening that’s the problem. No matter how much we increased the 
intensity of the sharpening in the left image, we’d still wind up obscuring 
detail, because the haloes are too wide; if we backed off the amount of 
sharpening on the right image until the sandpaper disappeared, we’d have a 
soft, unsharpened image.

As we noted earlier, it’s easy to mistake the wrong kind of sharpening for the 
wrong amount of sharpening. We’ll discuss the tools and techniques that let 
us inﬂ uence both the quality and the quantity of sharpening in much more 
detail in Chapters 4 and 5, but for now let’s stay focused on the sharpening 
requirements themselves rather than how to obtain them.
At the beginning of this chapter, we emphasized the difﬁ culty of using your 
computer display as a guide for print sharpening. Figure 2-34 shows sections 
of the images from Figure 2-31 printed at approximately the resolution of 
the display. They look quite ugly, but these are exactly the same pixels used 
to print Figure 2-31.
Figure 2-34 
Sharpened pixels 
This magnifi ed view of the pixels used to 
print the images in Figure 2-31 corresponds 
approximately to what you’d see if you 
looked at the images on the computer 
display in Actual Pixels (100% zoom) view.
The magnifi ed pixels look fairly hideous, 
especially in the upper, high-frequency 
image, but when they’re rendered in print, 
the objectionable “jaggies” are simply 
too small for the eye to pick them out 
as distinct features. Instead, we see a 
sharp image.

CHAPTER 2: WHY DO WE SHARPEN?
70
What the computer display does show is the difference in the sharpening 
haloes between the high-frequency and low-frequency images. The 
high-frequency image has very small, high-contrast haloes, while the low-
frequency image has larger, lower-contrast ones. Ultimately, you have to 
gain experience at judging sharpening with your own display, but the one 
factor you always need to bear in mind is the size of the pixels on ﬁ nal output. 
Faced with scary-looking images on screen, many of us end up undersharp-
ening our images with the result being lower image quality in print.

How Sharp Is Sharp Enough?
Figure 2-35 shows different sharpening treatments of the same image, rang-
ing from unsharpened to oversharpened. To some degree, sharpening is a 
matter of taste, but we suspect that most readers will agree that the image at 
the extreme left in Figure 2-35 is undersharpened (in fact, it isn’t sharpened 
at all), and the one at the extreme right is oversharpened.
The difference between the two middle images is more subtle (but again, 
subtle differences are ultimately what this book is all about). Our opinion 
is that the image sharpened in two passes (the third from the left) has more 
of an illusion of “depth” than the one sharpened with a single pass (second 
from the left). The peeling bark has more texture, though not overly so, and 
the background foliage is more clearly deﬁ ned. The highlights are a little 
less bright and contain more detail.
Now let’s look at the actual pixels—you may ﬁ nd them surprising!

The image in Figure 2-36 with no sharpening, at the extreme left, looks soft 
in Actual Pixels view, and it’s no surprise that it also prints that way, though 
it doesn’t look as soft at the reduced print size in Figure 2-35 as it does in 
Actual Pixels view.
The image sharpened with a single pass for output, second from the left, 
looks reasonably sharp in Actual Pixels view, but still prints a little soft. It’s 
acceptable, but it’s less sharp than it could be.
The image sharpened with multiple passes looks downright crunchy in 
Actual Pixels view, yet it prints well. Note that while the edges appear jag-
ged, the highlights and shadows still hold detail, and the sharpening con-
tours, while strong, are relatively narrow, so they don’t obscure any ﬁ ne 
details. In short, the sharpening is matched to the image content.
The ﬁ nal image, at right, is indeed oversharpened—lots of pixels have been 
forced to pure white or solid black. But the underlying problem is that the 
sharpening haloes are too big, obscuring detail rather than emphasizing it.

The combination of overlarge haloes and too much sharpening also causes 
some hue shifts, such as the bright lime greens in the upper-left corner that 
aren’t present in any of the other versions.
In the real world, this is often what happens when a client looks at a proof 
and asks for “more sharpening.” What they really need is a different kind
of sharpening that is sensitive to the image content, but when they ask for 
more sharpening, that’s exactly what they get, so highlights get blown to 
white and shadows get plugged to black, without actually ﬁ xing the problem.
The main argument that is raised against sharpening images more than 
once is that you’ll end up with an oversharpened mess. It’s certainly possible 
to destroy images with multiple rounds of sharpening, but as you just saw 
in Figures 2-35 and 2-36, it’s equally possible to do so with just one ill-
considered sharpening pass.

CHAPTER 2: WHY DO WE SHARPEN?

The relationship between pixels on the computer display and dots in the 
ﬁ nal print is sufﬁ ciently indirect that we can’t really judge ﬁ nal output 
sharpness from the display without a good deal of experience. But as we’ve 
said before, looking at the pixels on the display is one of the essential paths 
to gaining that experience. The key point to remember is that optimally 
sharpened images often look ugly on screen, particularly at higher zoom 
levels.
We can’t control the halftoning process, and unless you’re unusually knowl-
edgeable about screening algorithms, it’s just about impossible to know 
which four pixels will go to make up a particular cyan, magenta, yellow, or 
black dot on the print. What you can do is to check that the sharpening 
haloes aren’t too wide—they should be just wide enough to provide the 
appearance of sharpness in the print, but still too small for the eye to pick 
out the halo as a discrete feature. We use the beneﬁ t of the sharpening 
haloes without making them obvious in the print, which is the key to 
good sharpening.
This leads us to the last of the three factors we need to address when we 
sharpen: the softening introduced by the output process.
SHARPENING AND THE
OUTPUT PROCESS
Just as the process of turning photons into pixels introduces softness, so 
does the process of turning pixels into marks on a substrate (typically, but 
not always, ink on paper). There are three basic types of printed output 
(these are discussed in more detail later in this chapter):
•
Halftone output (see Figure 2-37), used on most printing presses and 
some color laser printers, turns the pixels into regularly spaced variable-
sized dots. The spacing between the dots is called the screen frequency, 
and is usually expressed in lines per inch (lpi). Light tones are produced 
by small dots, dark tones by larger ones.
This book is printed using a 150-lpi screen. Trade magazines typically 
use 133 lpi, newspapers use 85 or, on modern presses, up to 120 lpi. 
Glossy magazine covers and premium-quality print jobs use 175 lpi, and 
some ﬁ ne art coffee-table books may use 200 or even 300 lpi, though 
the latter is still very rare.

SHARPENING AND THE OUTPUT PROCESS 
75
•
Error diffusion dither output (see Figure 2-37), used on almost all inkjet 
printers, many color laser printers, and on a few printing presses (where 
it’s more commonly known as stochastic screening), turns the pixels 
into ﬁ xed-sized dots with variable placement. Light tones are produced 
by printing fewer dots in a given area, and dark tones are produced by 
printing more dots in that same area.
Some inkjet printers offer variable-size dots. Don’t confuse these with 
halftone dots, which are continuously variable in size—the inkjets that 
use this feature typically have only two dot sizes, the larger one being 
used only in dark areas.
•
Continuous-tone output includes dye-sublimation printers, and print-
ers such as the Fuji Pictrography and Frontier, the Océ LightJet, and 
the Durst Lambda, which use color lasers to expose traditional photo-
graphic paper. Unlike the ﬁ rst two printed-output types, this one prints 
dots that have the same properties as pixels—the dots are all the same 
size, and all three (cyan, magenta, and yellow) colors are laid down in 
the same dot, with varying density of each color to produce different 
tone and color values.
With continuous-tone printers, the relationship between image pixels 
and print dots is direct—one pixel in the image produces one dot on the 
print—but the dots are round where the image pixels are square, and 
the edges are softer than pixels displayed on an LCD (though probably 
In a CMYK diff usion dither, the size of the 
dots is regular, and the illusion of diff erent 
tonal values is produced by varying the 
dot placement.
In a conventional CMYK halftone, dot 
placement is regular, and the illusion of 
diff erent tonal values is produced by 
varying the size of the dots.

not on a CRT display). However, unless you’re printing an unusually low-
resolution image, the print dots are likely to be much smaller than the 
image pixels viewed on the display.
We can’t control how pixels get turned into dots. What we can control is the 
resolution—the number of pixels per inch—we send to the print device and 
how we sharpen those pixels. Moreover, the resolutions we usually send to 
the various different print technologies aren’t just picked out of thin air—
they’re based on the physiology of the eye itself, which imposes limits on 
the ﬁ nest detail we can see.
Resolution and the Eye
It should be obvious, but we’ll state it anyway: It takes two photoreceptors 
to detect a difference in luminance or color, because to detect a difference, 
you need two signals. It follows that the smallest difference we could possi-
bly see is one that is projected onto two photoreceptors on the retina.
Human Visual Acuity
The generally accepted deﬁ nition of normal (20/20) visual acuity is the abil-
ity to resolve a spatial pattern whose features are separated by one minute of 
arc, or 1/60 of a degree. This number comes directly from the retina. The 
lens in the eye projects one degree of the scene across 288 micrometers (or 
microns) of the retina.
In the fovea, the area of the retina where the photoreceptors are most tightly 
packed, a linear 288 micrometers contains about 120 photoreceptors. So, if 
more than 120 alternating black and white lines, or 60 cycles, are projected 
onto this area, someone with normal visual acuity will see a solid gray mass. 
Most printing processes exploit this fact to create the illusions of continuous 
tone from a bunch of discrete dots.
The actual size of the features that fall at the limit of visual acuity depend, 
of course, on viewing distance. With a little trigonometry, we can calculate 
the threshold of normal visual acuity for a given viewing distance. One 
minute of arc (1/60 of a degree) is 0.00029089 radians. We can calculate the 
limit L of visual acuity at distance D by this formula:
L=D*TAN(0.00029089)

SHARPENING AND THE OUTPUT PROCESS 
77
Table 2-2 shows the limit of visual acuity at different viewing distances, and 
the minimum print resolution, in dots per inch (dpi), needed to provide the 
illusion of continuous tone to an observer with 20/20 vision.

However, although useful, these numbers aren’t set in stone for the follow-
ing important reasons:
• 
Most of the work done to establish these limits uses black and white 
line pairs, but our ability to discern individual features diminishes as 
contrast is reduced. So in most real photographic imagery (which is 
not comprised of black and white line pairs), the practical limit may be 
larger, and, hence, the required ppi to provide the illusion of continuous 
tone may be lower.
• 
Conversely, some people have better than 20/20 vision. The maximum 
acuity of the unaided human eye is generally thought to be about 20/15 
(meaning that the observer can distinguish details at 20 feet that some-
one with “normal” 20/20 vision could distinguish at only 15 feet), and 
with modern corrective lenses, 20/10 vision (where the observer can 
distinguish details at 20 feet that someone with 20/20 vision could dis-
tinguish only at 10 feet) may be achievable.
• 
A slew of other factors can come into play, including but not limited 
to defects in the eye’s lens, the pupil size, the level of illumination, the 
duration of exposure to the target, the area of the retina that is stimu-
lated, the state of adaptation of the eye, and eye movement.
So treat the numbers in Table 2-2 as useful guidelines rather than as abso-
lutes. One reason for mentioning these numbers is to provide insight into 
the reasons that we print at the resolutions we typically use. Yet another 

CHAPTER 2: WHY DO WE SHARPEN?
78
equally important reason is to help us understand what we need to do to 
keep our sharpening haloes near the threshold of visual acuity. By doing so, 
we can produce prints that appear sharp, yet lack the obvious and disturbing 
sharpening haloes that mar so much of the work we see in print.
Viewing Distance
Bruce observed this phenomenon so many times that he couldn’t resist 
commenting on it. He has often said that “when some otherwise-sane pho-
tographers learn that a print was produced digitally, the concept of ‘normal 
viewing distance’ suddenly changes from the distance at which they can see 
the image to one that is largely determined by the length of their noses.” If 
you examine a 30" x 40" traditional darkroom print at such close proximity, 
you’ll likely see unpleasant grain artifacts that become invisible when you 
move back far enough to see the image. It’s the same with digital!
Figure 2-38 contains 75 line pairs per inch, with increasing contrast from 
solid midtone gray at the top to solid black and white at the bottom. As you 
move the image farther or closer to your eye, the point at which you can 
no longer discern the individual line pairs changes. As you move closer, 
you can discern the line pairs higher up the page, and if you move back far 
enough, the whole ﬁ gure becomes one solid gray mass.
Notice that the right side of the ﬁ gure is different from the left side. The 
difference is that the left side of the ﬁ gure has had no sharpening applied, 
while the right side has been sharpened. As a result, you can discern the line 
pairs on the right side higher up than you can on the left side at any given 
viewing distance.
This is exactly what good sharpening does: increases localized contrast 
to reveal detail. But each printing process imposes its own requirements 
and limitations.

CHAPTER 2: WHY DO WE SHARPEN?

PRINT RESOLUTION
When we print, we need to decide how many pixels per inch we send to the 
printing process. In part, the decision depends on how many pixels we captured 
in the ﬁ rst place. We can create more pixels by interpolation, but interpolation 
can’t create detail—it simply takes the original pixels, spreads them apart, 
and creates new pixels with intermediate values in the spaces between the 
original ones.
When interpolation is combined with careful sharpening, it can improve the 
print results slightly on some images, but it tends to be a great deal of extra 
work for questionable return. Bruce recommended attempting it only when 
printing at the uninterpolated resolution has clearly failed. Jeff has seen where 
interpolation can help (covered in Chapter 5).
Interpolating downward to achieve the required output resolution is, however, 
necessary and normal. It’s possible to drown printers in data: If you send far 
more data than the printer can resolve, it will either throw away the excess data 
(in which case you’ve just wasted some time) or, worse, it will attempt to use the 
extra data, with the result that detail gets blocked up instead of being resolved.
In either case, ﬁ nal sharpening for print must be done after any interpolation. 
If you downsample, the sharpening haloes can simply disappear as they’re 
downsampled out of existence. If you upsample, the sharpening haloes become 
too large and hence visually obvious. The print sharpening must always be 
done at the ﬁ nal print resolution.
Halftone Output
The general rule of thumb for halftone output is to send a number of pixels 
per inch that corresponds to between 1.5 and 2 times the screen frequency 
in lines per inch. If the platesetter or the imagesetter is driven by PostScript 
(which they invariably are), anything over 2.5 times the screen frequency is 
automatically discarded, so it’s an absolute certainty that there’s no reason to 
send more than 2.5 times the screen frequency.
In the real world, we’ve yet to encounter an image that showed any visible 
difference when printed from 2.5 times the screen frequency instead of two 
times. But images with ﬁ ne detail generally reproduce better when two times 
the screen frequency is used rather than 1.5, particularly at lower screen 
rulings. At higher screen frequencies of 175 lpi and greater, the difference 
becomes more subtle and is apparent on fewer images.

PRINT RESOLUTION
81
Figure 2-39 shows the same image printed from a 300-ppi ﬁ le (native 
resolution, two times the screen frequency) and from a 225-ppi ﬁ le (down-
sampled from 300 to 225 ppi, 1.5 times the screen frequency). Can you see 
the difference? There are differences—we had to sharpen the 225-ppi version 
more aggressively for output than we did the 300-ppi version—but they’re 
quite subtle!

CHAPTER 2: WHY DO WE SHARPEN?
82
Continuous-Tone Output
A great deal depends on the software used to drive the continuous-tone 
printer, but a useful rule of thumb is to send pixels at the printer’s native 
resolution. Some older dye-sublimation printers may still insist that you do 
so, but most modern continuous-tone printers have sophisticated control-
lers that will perform the necessary interpolation to the printer’s native 
resolution.
Some pundits advocate sticking to resolutions that are even multiples of the 
printer’s native resolution. Doing so certainly simpliﬁ es the interpolation 
tasks that the software controller needs to conduct, but we’ve found the 
practice to be advantageous only with some older printers and with some 
entry-level dye-sub printers.
It’s almost certainly a bad idea to send signiﬁ cantly more than the printer’s 
native resolution, not because the interpolation algorithms will do a bad job, 
but simply because in doing so, you lose some control over the sharpening, 
since the sharpening haloes will be downsampled along with the rest of the 
image. But it’s not worth downsampling an image that had been prepared 
at 305 ppi for a Fuji Frontier to 300 ppi before printing it on a 300-ppi Océ 
LightJet—the difference is just too small to worry about on normal images. 
(You may see a detectable difference on synthetic targets made up of black 
and white line pairs, but that difference disappears with even slightly low-
ered contrast.) Most minilabs and online services who offer continuous-
tone output specify 300 ppi for high-quality printing. If you aren’t sure 
about the optimal ppi for your preferred service, ask!
Error Diffusion Dither Output
Most inkjet and color laser printers use an error diffusion dither of some 
kind, though the details are usually proprietary. Most color laser printers 
quote a resolution of 600 or 1200 dpi, while most inkjet printers specify 
some multiple of these resolutions. Canon’s photo inkjet printers range from 
1200 x 1200 to 9600 x 2400 dpi; Hewlett-Packard’s photo inkjets generally 
use 4800 x 1200 dpi; and Epson’s inkjet printers typically specify 720 x 2880 
or 1440 x 5760 dpi.
What these numbers represent is the addressable resolution of the printer—
the accuracy with which it attempts to lay down droplets of ink. Their 

PRINT RESOLUTION
83
relationship to the pixel resolution of the image is fairly indirect, but the 
optimal ppi value is lower than these numbers may suggest. The conven-
tional wisdom is that the “effective” resolution of Epson inkjets is 360 ppi, 
while that of the Canon and Hewlett-Packard inkjets is 300 ppi. 
Notice that we didn’t say dpi here. Inkjet printers eject tiny droplets of ink 
from nozzles rather than creating dots as in halftones. Most Epson printers 
can literally print 180, 3 picoliter droplets per inch, because that’s how many 
nozzles the print heads contain. Newer printers have increased that count to 
360 nozzles per inch. But take note that picoliter is a unit of measurement of 
volume, not dimension. 
What Bruce’s own testing indicated was that there’s deﬁ nitely no point in 
upsampling images to achieve a resolution higher than the native ones stated 
above, and little point in upsampling even to these resolutions. For large 
prints that are likely to be viewed from 20 inches or more, 180 ppi is prob-
ably plenty. However, if you are at the low end of acceptable resolution and 
you have an image with a lot of high-frequency texture and/or high-contrast 
diagonal lines (particularly problematic for inkjet printers), you may see a 
beneﬁ t by upsampling about 50% prior to applying the ﬁ nal sharpening for 
output.
However, if you’re making small prints and you have real captured data (that 
is, with no interpolation) in excess of the native resolution, you may not 
want to downsample it to the native resolution. With Epson printers, there 
seems to be a small but useful advantage to sending 480 ppi of real data, 
suitably sharpened, to the printer. At higher resolutions, the advantage dimin-
ishes, and sending more than 720 ppi actually seems to degrade the image.
Some pundits claim that you’ll always get better results if you print at even 
multiples of the native resolution. This holds true for line pair targets, but 
on real-world images the beneﬁ t is much less certain, and may often be out-
weighed by the damage done by resampling the image. We almost always 
print at the native capture resolution, and if that turns out to be 342 ppi 
rather than 360, or 191 ppi rather than 180, we simply don’t worry about it.
Note that this is simply a statement of what we do, albeit based on consid-
erable testing and experience. Each generation of new printers brings new 
capabilities and, probably, new challenges, so beware of any statements on 
optimal resolution for inkjet printers that claim to be deﬁ nitive—and don’t 
be afraid to put conventional wisdom to the test!

CHAPTER 2: WHY DO WE SHARPEN?
84
SHARPENING FOR OUTPUT
Whether you adopt the multipass workﬂ ow we’ll advocate in Chapter 3 or 
the more traditional single-pass sharpening, output sharpening is where the 
strongest sharpening comes into play. The key point to bear in mind when 
sharpening for output is that it’s resolution dependent—it’s all about the size 
of the pixels.
Remember—you have no control over how the pixels get turned into dots, 
so all you can do is sharpen the pixels themselves. For any given size of 
output, you need to sharpen higher-resolution images more aggressively 
than lower-resolution ones to achieve the same perceived sharpness. More 
aggressive sharpening can mean wider haloes, higher contrast between dark 
and light contours, or a combination of both.
The goal with output sharpening is to produce a satisfactorily sharp image 
without introducing visually obvious sharpening haloes. To do so, the secret 
is to keep the size of the haloes below the threshold of visual acuity at the 
anticipated viewing distance—this is where the size of the pixels on output 
becomes a critical factor.
Bear in mind that the numbers given in Table 2-2 for the limits of visual 
acuity refer to very high-contrast edges, since they’re based on black and 
white line pairs. In practice, you can take some liberties with these num-
bers. The following rules of thumb have served Bruce well:
• 
For smaller reproductions, such as small inkjet prints, magazine repro-
duction, or most of the images in this book, we try to keep the light 
and dark sharpening haloes to around 0.01 inches each. If we’re printing 
to an inkjet printer at 360 ppi, that means that the sharpening haloes 
can be as wide as 3.6 pixels if the image content requires it, and if we’re 
printing a 200-ppi image to a 133-line halftone, we need to keep the 
haloes to around one pixel for the light halo and one pixel for the 
dark one.
• 
For larger reproductions, we may relax these limits to make light and 
dark contours of around 0.02 inches. If we’re making a large inkjet print 
at 180 ppi, which is the lowest resolution we would typically print, that 
still allows light and dark haloes of close to two pixels each. However, 
we still try to keep the haloes as small as possible, varying the contrast 
to make the contours stronger or weaker.

SHARPENING FOR OUTPUT
85
Paper stock also has an inﬂ uence. Inks bleed more on uncoated papers than 
on coated ones, so sharpening for uncoated papers has to be stronger than 
that for coated papers to achieve the same degree of sharpness.
Figure 2-40 shows the same native-resolution pixels sharpened for differ-
ent print sizes and processes, zoomed in approximately 400% to make the 
differences obvious. The sharpening for the 4" x 6" inkjet print appears the 
gentlest of the three, because the inkjet can actually resolve the ﬁ ne detail 
that wider sharpening haloes would obscure.

CHAPTER 2: WHY DO WE SHARPEN?
86
The haloes for the halftone sharpening are wider than for the inkjet, 
because it takes several pixels to make up one halftone dot. Therefore, 
rendering single-pixel details isn’t possible (you could render single-pixel 
details by sending a lower-resolution image, but then you’d have obvious 
single pixels, which looks worse than bad sharpening). The haloes for the 
85-line halftone need to be higher-contrast than those for the 175-line 
halftone to achieve the same apparent sharpness.

INTRODUCTION TO CREATIVE SHARPENING
87
There’s one last thing to note about output sharpening. Unlike the other 
sharpening factors we’ve discussed, the relationship between pixels and 
printer dots is ﬁ xed, for any given print process at any given resolution, and 
doesn’t depend on image content or source. We’ll discuss the implications 
of this in detail in Chapter 3.
INTRODUCTION TO CREATIVE
SHARPENING
 Creative sharpening, as we’ll discover in subsequent chapters, is the middle 
part of a sharpening workﬂ ow; it starts with sharpening for source and con-
tent, and ﬁ nishes with sharpening for output. In between is what Bruce and 
Jeff called “creative sharpening.” Rather than spend a lot of time discussing 
creative sharpening and showing examples here, we’ll do that in Chapter 6, 
“Putting the Tools to Work.” But we wanted to brieﬂ y explain why there 
is this thing called creative sharpening, and that’s because we often need 
to improve reality. The concept of improving reality is anathema to some 
photographers, and if you’re one of them, feel free to skip this section—
but do recognize that it’s what some other photographers get paid to do!
We sometimes want to call extra attention to an element in an image by 
making it appear a little sharper than its surroundings. Headshots often 
beneﬁ t from a little extra sharpening around the eyes, for example. We call 
this kind of sharpening “creative sharpening” because, unlike the other 
kinds of sharpening we’ve discussed so far—source-sensitive, content-
sensitive, and output-sensitive—creative sharpening can’t be automated. 
It requires manual application and human decision-making.
There are a variety of reasons why one may need to apply a sharpening 
effect that does not relate to source, content, or output. That is considered 
“sharpening for effect.” This also falls under the general umbrella of creative 
sharpening and shares the fact that, most often, these kinds of sharpening 
are optimal when done on a local basis, not global.
There are really no hard and fast rules, beyond those imposed by good 
taste, regarding creative sharpening. Obviously, if you overdo it, you’ll wind 
up with a crunchy image; if you don’t do enough, you’ll waste time doing 
things that don’t show up in the ﬁ nal image. But within those bounds, you 
have a lot of leeway.

CHAPTER 2: WHY DO WE SHARPEN?
88
A reasonable rule of thumb is to apply creative sharpening in such a way 
that it doesn’t stick out from the rest of the image as an area that has obvi-
ously been more heavily sharpened—the transition between the areas that 
have received creative sharpening and those that have not should be imper-
ceptible at Actual Pixels zoom or lower. The smoothness of the transition 
is more important than the actual appearance of the pixels on the screen, 
unless you’re actually sharpening for on-screen viewing.
ONE SIZE DOES NOT FIT ALL
This chapter contains a lot of details, but the overall message is that, when 
it comes to sharpening, one size doesn’t ﬁ t all. If you fail to take the image 
source into account, you end up sharpening noise as well as detail. If you 
ignore the image content, you may exaggerate unwanted detail or obscure 
wanted detail. And if you don’t tailor the sharpening for the output process, 
your images will appear undersharpened or oversharpened.
The challenge, then, is to reconcile these disparate needs to produce optimally 
sharpened images. In the next chapter, we’ll discuss a sharpening workﬂ ow 
that attempts to do just that.

Sharpening Strategies
Why Use a Sharpening Workfl ow
In the last chapter, we saw that when sharpening, we must take into account 
a variety of different and often contradictory demands. In this chapter, we’ll 
offer a means of reconciling these disparate demands, while pointing out the 
potential pitfalls in doing so.
Having tried for decades to meet all the requirements imposed by image 
source, image content, and image use in a single sharpening operation, 
we’ve reluctantly concluded that it is, in fact, impossible to do so. Of course, 
this conclusion ﬂ ies in the face of conventional wisdom, which dictates that 
sharpening should be applied in a single pass as either the last or next-to-last 
step (before conversion to ﬁ nal CMYK in an RGB workﬂ ow) in the image 
reproduction chain. The conventional wisdom does have some foundation:
• 
Back when the drum scanner was king, images were usually scanned 
directly to RGB and automatically converted to CMYK, at reproduction 
size, with sharpening appropriate to the halftone screen applied by the 
scanner. The conventional wisdom workﬂ ow tries to replicate this.
• 
If downsampling is done after sharpening, the image has to be resharp-
ened, because the haloes get downsampled out of existence.
• 
Multiple passes (of the wrong kind) of sharpening tend to ruin images.
These are all good points that deserve careful consideration, but let’s look at 
the downsides to the conventional wisdom (aside from it coming from the 
last millennium and, therefore, being way out of date).

CHAPTER 3: SHARPENING STRATEGIES
90
TRADITIONAL PREPRESS
SHARPENING
First, let’s be clear that traditional sharpening works reasonably well as 
long as it’s done with the requisite skill and the built-in assumptions aren’t 
violated. But there’s a substantial difference between “reasonably well” and 
“optimally.” 
In the traditional sharpening workﬂ ow, sharpening is applied either as the 
ﬁ nal process (which allows tricks like sharpening only the black plate, so 
that eyelashes and hair get sharpened, but skin textures don’t) or as the next-
to-last process before conversion to ﬁ nal CMYK. It offers a simple workﬂ ow 
(which is no small advantage), but it also has its share of disadvantages.
One-Pass Sharpening Is Inﬂ exible
A key assumption in the traditional sharpening workﬂ ow is that the ﬁ nal 
use is known and the image has been sized for that ﬁ nal use. Back in the 
Rubylith days, this assumption was generally valid because the size of an 
image reproduction was set by the supplied mechanical design. But as soon as 
page layout applications gave designers the ability to resize images in layout, 
that assumption went out the window because, of course, designers will resize 
the images in page layout.
Nowadays, it’s common practice for prepress operations to act both as sup-
pliers of original scans and as the ﬁ nal step in the output chain. As a result, 
it’s not uncommon for scanned images to receive two rounds of sharpening 
behind the scenes: once at the time of the scan on the high-resolution 
image, and again on the resized image before output. The key point is that 
traditional sharpening was designed to be applied only to the ﬁ nal image at 
ﬁ nal output resolution. The further the image is from that state, the less 
successful the traditional sharpening approach is likely to be.
TIP: Buy unsharpened scans. If you’re buying drum scans for images whose fi nal use 
is unknown or to use as master images for multiple outputs, specify no sharpening 
during the scan process. Inappropriate sharpening is extremely hard to undo and, unless the 
images are scanned to their fi nal output resolution, any sharpening applied during the scan 
is almost guaranteed to be inappropriate. Even if you opt to stay with a one-pass sharpening 
workfl ow, that workfl ow will work better when you reserve sharpening for the fi nal output-
sized image.

One-Pass Sharpening Is Often Overdone
Traditional sharpening, as it is commonly in use today, is sensitive neither to 
image content nor to ﬁ nal use. As a result, it’s common to see grossly over-
sharpened images, especially in the case where a sharpened scan receives a 
second round of sharpening at ﬁ nal output size. 
Figure 3-1 shows an image scanned without sharpening, then sharpened 
carefully in two passes, and the same image sharpened during the scan and 
then again after resizing. 
Figure 3-1 Oversharpening
This version of the image was 
scanned with no sharpening, 
then sharpened carefully in 
two passes: once on the high-
resolution scan, then again at 
fi nal output resolution after 
resampling to size.
This version of the image was 
sharpened during the scan, then 
sharpened again at fi nal output 
size, using “standard” sharpen-
ing techniques.

CHAPTER 3: SHARPENING STRATEGIES
92
While this kind of oversharpening is rare in high-end work (because someone 
has paid to make sure that it doesn’t happen), it’s depressingly commonplace 
in commercial publishing. However, this is not an argument against multi-
pass sharpening; both versions of the image in Figure 3-1 received two 
sharpening passes. Rather, it’s an argument against careless sharpening that 
fails to account for image source, content, and ﬁ nal use. 
Figure 3-2 shows details of both images zoomed in 200%. You’ll note that 
the oversharpened image has crunchy grain and overly bright-edged haloes. 
Both of these image attributes are undesirable and rather difﬁ cult to ﬁ x or 
eliminate. Once oversharpening has occurred, there is very little one can do 
to undo the damage done to the image.

TRADITIONAL PREPRESS SHARPENING
93
One-Pass Sharpening and Digital Capture
Traditional one-pass sharpening was very much tailored to scanned trans-
parencies, since it essentially tries to simulate the sharpening that was built 
into drum scanners. It’s possible to get good drum scans from color negative, 
but relatively few operators know how to do so. 
Traditional Sharpening Is Global
A salient feature of traditional sharpening is that it’s applied globally to the 
entire image. While this worked reasonably well with transparency scans, 
it generally fails to do justice to digital raw captures, where it sharpens the 
noise along with the edges.
The problem can become worse if unsophisticated global sharpening is 
applied by the conversion from raw camera capture into a rendered RGB 
image. Bear in mind that when you shoot JPEG, the camera itself performs 
a raw conversion, often with global sharpening applied as default. 
Global sharpening in the raw converter followed by traditional sharpening 
produces images with sharp noise, but not necessarily with optimally sharp 
image detail. 
Most raw converters offer the option to produce an unsharpened image, but 
many photographers decline to exercise this option because the results are 
obviously soft on the display. Yet many of the major stock agencies specify 
that submissions should be unsharpened. This is a recipe for soft images.
 
NOTE: When stock photo agencies ask for unsharpened images for digital submis-
sion, what they are really asking for are images that haven’t been ruined by over-
sharpening. Since fi nal output type, size, and resolution cannot be known in advance, 
photographers should not be tempted to apply any output sharpening to images supplied 
to stock agencies. Properly sharpening for output is the role of the fi nal buyer, unless the 
agency off ers that service. However, photographers should do careful preliminary “capture 
sharpening” and any “creative sharpening” as required by careful examination of the image.
Traditional Sharpening Fails to Exploit Digital Capture
By their nature, unsharpened digital captures produce images that both 
tolerate and require a good deal more sharpening than those from ﬁ lm. 
Most digital cameras actually include an optical low-pass ﬁ lter to prevent 

CHAPTER 3: SHARPENING STRATEGIES
94
color artifacting and Moiré patterns (discussed in Chapter 2, “Why Do 
We Sharpen?”), which has the effect of softening the image. As a result, 
traditional sharpening, which is optimized for transparency scans, often 
undersharpens digital captures. 
Figure 3-3 shows the difference between a traditionally sharpened and an 
optimally sharpened digital raw capture.

ppi (pixels per inch).
This contact-print–sized version 
of the image was produced by 
applying zero global sharpening 
in the raw converter, followed 
by traditional one-pass sharpen-
ing at fi nal print size. It’s not 
really sharp at all.

This failure to understand the inherent properties of digital capture and 
the differences between digital capture and scanned transparencies has 
given rise to a considerable body of prepress myth regarding the perceived 
superiority of ﬁ lm over digital capture. But like it or not, digital capture has 
already largely replaced ﬁ lm for most commercial work, and the trend is 
clear and irreversible.
This contact-print–sized version 
of the image was produced 
by applying optimal selective 
sharpening in Adobe Camera 
Raw, followed by output sharp-
ening at print size. It’s noticeably 
sharper than the version above.

suitable for 150-lpi (lines per inch) halftone 
with 300-ppi resolution.

CHAPTER 3: SHARPENING STRATEGIES

Traditional Sharpening Roots
Traditional sharpening is rooted in the drum scanner and, moreover, in the 
analog drum scanner. The earliest drum scanners, from the 1960s, were 
analog devices that produced actual CMYK ﬁ lm separations, and the sharp-
ening was done optically. By the 1980s, drum scanners produced digital 
CMYK ﬁ les from RGB scans, still with optical sharpening.
When the desktop revolution hit in the early 1990s, the old paradigm of 
scanning at ﬁ nal resolution for a speciﬁ c use fell by the wayside. Adobe 
Photoshop 2.0 introduced CMYK support and changed print manufactur-
ing forever—though not overnight. Proprietary systems from the likes of 
Scitex, Linotype-Hell, Crosﬁ eld, and Agfa continued to hold sway for much 
of the decade, but by 1999, Photoshop had become not only a ubiquitous 
noun, but also a verb.
Photoshop Sharpening Practice
As has often been the case when an analog process is replaced by a digital one, 
most practitioners of sharpening in Photoshop used Photoshop’s sharpening 
tools to replicate the drum scanning workﬂ ow. There is still considerable 
debate as to whether to sharpen before or after conversion to CMYK (some 
even advocate converting to Lab and sharpening the Lightness channel), but 
it’s generally agreed that sharpening must be done at the ﬁ nal output size 
and resolution, after all major tonal adjustments have been performed.
Traditional Sharpening Problems 
The main problem with the traditional sharpening approach is that it tries 
to account for image source, image content, and output process in a single 
round of sharpening. After nearly 20 years of experience using Photoshop 
to produce images both on press and on desktop printers, Bruce and Jeff 
have concluded that it’s simply impossible to address all three factors in one 
sharpening pass. The preceding pages of this book show the kinds of prob-
lems that arise when we attempt to do so. While the results aren’t invariably 
bad, they’re never as good as they could be.

A MULTIPASS SHARPENING WORKFLOW
97
Multipass Sharpening Problems 
Many Photoshop users have, at some point, tried a multipass sharpening 
approach. A few have made it work, but the vast majority have wound up 
creating grossly oversharpened images, usually by falling into one or more 
of four potential pitfalls:
• 
Relying on the computer display to judge sharpness is a practice fraught 
with peril, yet until we make the print, it’s all we have. The temptation 
is to make the image look sharp on screen, then to sharpen it again for 
output, often with unacceptable results.
• 
Failure to take image content into account in the ﬁ rst round of sharpen-
ing typically results in applying the wrong kind of sharpening for the 
image, so wanted detail may be obscured, and unwanted detail or noise 
may be exaggerated. 
• 
Applying the ﬁ rst pass of sharpening globally, rather than through a 
mask that isolates edges, sharpens noise, ﬂ at-textured surface areas 
(such as skies), and the edges. When the second pass of sharpening is 
applied, the image becomes oversharpened.
• 
Applying the ﬁ rst pass of sharpening to the entire tonal range, rather 
than protecting the extreme highlights and shadows, almost guarantees 
that the second pass of sharpening will create blown highlights and 
plugged shadows.
The good news is that all of these problems are avoidable given sufﬁ cient 
attention, care, and skill. Building a multipass sharpening workﬂ ow is not 
a trivial undertaking, but neither is it impossible—otherwise we wouldn’t 
have bothered writing this book!
A MULTIPASS SHARPENING WORKFLOW
It’s impossible to address the varying needs of the image source, the image 
content, and the output process in a single pass, because each imposes require-
ments that can contradict the others. The solution, then, is to build a multi-
pass sharpening workﬂ ow that addresses the individual needs separately.
Each component has its own requirements, and by ignoring everything else, 
we can tailor each sharpening pass to address a speciﬁ c issue.

CHAPTER 3: SHARPENING STRATEGIES
98
Phase One: Capture Sharpening
When the ﬁ rst edition of the book was released, some people were some-
what confused about the deﬁ nition and role of capture sharpening. Bruce 
had written about sharpening for the image source as well as the image 
content as though they were two different sharpening passes. They weren’t. 
The intent was to describe two different aspects that needed to be consid-
ered when doing sharpening at the early input stage, which Bruce called 
“capture sharpening.”
Whether the capture is on ﬁ lm and scanned or made with a digital camera, 
the concept remains the same. You must apply initial sharpening to the image, 
and this initial sharpening must consider two components very carefully: 
the image source and the image content. Done properly, both components 
can be addressed in a single round of capture sharpening.
The goal of this ﬁ rst pass of the sharpening workﬂ ow is to create an image 
that responds well to subsequent rounds of sharpening aimed at the image 
content and at the output process. We recommend performing any major 
tonal correction before doing any sharpening or noise reduction, because 
sharpening and noise reduction can’t easily be undone if it’s done before the 
tone and color correction. 
Figure 3-4 shows an image in Camera Raw at the default sharpening set-
tings. (We’ll follow this image through the entire sharpening workﬂ ow.) 
Optimizing Camera Raw’s sharpening settings is one example of capture 
sharpening. Note that the tone and color correction settings have already 
been determined; only the sharpening and noise-reduction settings are 
being addressed at this stage.
Optimizing for the Image Source
Optimization for the image source is dictated by two factors: the noise sig-
nature and the amount of detail the system can record. The inherent softness 
of most digital captures (due to the anti-aliasing ﬁ lter) requires actual sharp-
ening, where with ﬁ lm the emphasis may be on grain reduction instead.
Optimizing digital captures. With digital capture, the lens is more often 
than not the practical limiting factor on the amount of detail the system can 
record, but the optical low-pass (anti-aliasing) ﬁ lter found in the majority of 
digital SLRs sets an absolute limit. 

A MULTIPASS SHARPENING WORKFLOW
99
For those few cameras that lack an anti-aliasing ﬁ lter, it may be worthwhile 
making lens-speciﬁ c settings, but in general we can come up with a single 
sharpening routine that is optimal for a given camera. High-ISO shots and 
signiﬁ cantly underexposed images may need special handling of noise, in 
either the raw converter or in Photoshop. Severe noise may call for a dedi-
cated third-party noise-reduction plug-in. 
With normal exposures at low ISO settings, it’s often enough to simply 
avoid sharpening the noise by protecting the extreme shadows. 
Figure 3-5 shows the beginning of the process of optimizing the settings. 
In general, the controls of Camera Raw are set out in the logical order of 
use. It should be expected, however, that adjusting subsequent settings may 
require modiﬁ cations of previously made adjustments. In this ﬁ gure, the 
Option key (Mac) or Alt key (Windows) is being held down while adjusting 
the Amount slider. This instructs Camera Raw to display the luminance 
image data that will be sharpened in the processing pipeline. In addition to 
sharpening only the luminance data, Camera Raw also rolls off the extreme 
highlight and shadow detail so that image sharpening won’t cause clipping.

CHAPTER 3: SHARPENING STRATEGIES

Optimizing ﬁ lm captures. It’s a little more difﬁ cult to make generaliza-
tions about ﬁ lm capture, since the scanner represents a huge variable in both 
tonal rendering and resolution. With ﬁ lm, the amount of resolvable detail 
may be limited by the ﬁ lm grain or by the lens. On most ﬁ lm captures, the 
ﬁ rst pass is less about sharpening the image and more about mitigating the 
ﬁ lm grain. At one extreme, 35mm color negative requires strong grain 
reduction, while at the other extreme, large-format (4” x 5” or 8” x 10”) 
transparencies can usually skip the ﬁ rst pass altogether.
We’ll discuss speciﬁ c techniques you can use to achieve these ends in 
Chapter 5, “Industrial-Strength Sharpening Techniques.” Photoshop invari-
ably offers several different ways to accomplish any given task, and for the 
moment, it’s more important to understand the goals of the different stages 
in the workﬂ ow than it is to focus on the details of the techniques needed 
to attain those goals.
Optimizing for Image Content
As you saw in Chapter 2, a busy, high-frequency image with lots of ﬁ ne 
detail demands a different kind of sharpening than does a low-frequency 
image with soft, wide edges. This phase of the sharpening workﬂ ow is 
where that difference is taken into account.

nance preview as a guide to

stage of adjusting for both 
image source and content.

Figure 3-6 shows the live edge mask being generated on the ﬂ y by Camera 
Raw. The mask plays a dual role: It prevents sharpening areas of ﬂ at texture, 
leaving headroom for the ﬁ nal output sharpening, and it provides some 
control over the width of the sharpened edges. Again, the preview is being 
generated by holding down the Option (Alt) key while adjusting the slider. 
The layer mask offers some limited control over the width of the sharpening 
halo, but it’s vital to match the actual sharpening settings to the image con-
tent rather than relying on the mask. We’ll discuss techniques for building and 
applying layer masks, and applying sharpening through them, in Chapter 4. 
For now, it’s enough to remember the simple rule that white reveals and 
black conceals. (Logically enough, intermediate shades of gray apply varying 
opacities to the masked layer proportional to the shade of gray.)
The layer mask’s real job is to protect the areas we don’t want to sharpen at 
this stage, which is everything except the obvious edges. Note the qualiﬁ er, 
“obvious”—almost all images contain a mixture of low-frequency, mid-fre-
quency, and high-frequency edges. In this phase of workﬂ ow, you need to 
decide the dominant tendency and sharpen accordingly.
Content optimization shares some of the properties of source optimization
—the sharpening is applied in luminosity blend mode to eliminate the pos-
sibility of color shifts, and the sharpening is focused mostly on the midtones 
while highlights and shadows are protected. The sharpening radius is tuned

trate the sharpening on the 
edges, not the surfaces.

CHAPTER 3: SHARPENING STRATEGIES

to the image content we want to emphasize rather than being dictated by 
the properties of the sensor.
Figure 3-7 shows the ﬁ nal, optimized capture sharpening settings for this 
image. The radius setting of 0.8 is intended to concentrate the sharpening 
on the high-frequency edges of the image. The Detail setting was also 
increased to reduce halo dampening, and a slight amount of Luminance 
noise reduction was added. The Color noise reduction was also reduced 
because this capture had less need. The aim of these settings is to optimize 
the capture sharpening of the image prior to opening in Photoshop, which 
will bring us to the next phase: creative sharpening.
Phase Two: Creative Sharpening
Creative sharpening isn’t required for every image (if you’re shooting 500 
plumbing widgets on white seamless backgrounds, creative sharpening 
probably isn’t in the budget), but on some images, subtle sharpening (or 
blurring) moves can make a big difference.
For example, on headshots we often add a little extra sharpness to the eyes 
and hair. Sometimes skin texture needs a little softening. And of course, 
while one way to make a subject stand out from its surroundings is to 
sharpen it, it’s sometimes more effective to blur the surroundings (which 
makes the subject appear sharper without actually sharpening it).
Figure 3-7 The fi nal 
capture-sharpening settings 
used for this image

A MULTIPASS SHARPENING WORKFLOW
103
Figure 3-8 shows some examples of creative sharpening and blurring. They 
represent subjective decisions made on our part with which you may well 
disagree, but they serve to illustrate the point that localized control of detail 
can be a creative tool. The Progressive Sharpening layer is a result of running 
multiple passes of an increasing radius in the Unsharp Mask ﬁ lter while fading 
each step. The Box Blur layer is being used to soften the corners of the image, 
while the Midtone Contrast is increasing the contrast of only the image’s 
midtones. All three of these creative sharpening steps (and more) will be 
shown in detail in Chapter 5, “Industrial-Strength Sharpening Techniques.”
There are few rules for creative sharpening beyond those dictated by taste: 
You have to learn the behavior of your display so that you can make reason-
able judgments as to how far to push the sharpening, and there’s no shortcut 
for doing that. 
As with all the previous steps in the sharpening workﬂ ow, it’s a good idea to 
leave headroom for the ﬁ nal output sharpening by protecting the extreme 
highlights and shadows, and to do your creative sharpening on the native-
resolution image. We’ll discuss speciﬁ c techniques for creative sharpening 
in Chapter 5.
Figure 3-8 This fi gure 
shows the result of three 
diff erent creative sharp-
ening steps: Progressive 
Sharpening, Box Blur, and 
Midtone Contrast.

CHAPTER 3: SHARPENING STRATEGIES
104
Phase Three: Output Sharpening
The ﬁ nal step in the sharpening workﬂ ow compensates both for the softness 
introduced by the output process and for the softening induced by resizing 
to ﬁ nal output resolution. At this stage in the workﬂ ow, all the other factors 
that affect sharpening have already been addressed, so this step can focus 
(no pun intended) entirely on the output process.
Since the relationship between input pixels and output dots is always the 
same for a given output process, it’s possible to create a single optimal sharp-
ening routine for each different output process and resolution. It’s true that 
different platesetters or different inkjet printers use subtly different screen-
ing algorithms, but all we can do is sharpen the pixels—we can’t control 
how they get turned into dots—and, in practice, these small differences are 
below the threshold that we can address by sharpening pixels. 
Figure 3-9 shows the ﬁ nal image resizing and output sharpening.
You’ll note in Figure 3-9 that the image has been resized and resampled to 
4.25” x 2.8” at 300 ppi. The output sharpening was applied after the resize/
resample and broken down into two layers: the Light Contour and Dark 
Contour. Again, we’ll describe the process of creating output sharpening in 
detail in later chapters.
By far the most important factor when output sharpening is the pixel reso-
lution you send to print, because that resolution dictates the size of the pixels 
and, hence, the size of the sharpening haloes. Up to this point in the work-
ﬂ ow, we’ve tried to avoid obvious sharpening haloes. For output sharpening, 
however, we want haloes that may be obvious on the computer display 
when viewed at actual pixels (or higher) zoom, but that will still fall below 
the threshold of visual acuity at reasonable viewing distance for the print.
Matte papers need slightly more sharpening than glossy or luster papers to 
achieve the same apparent sharpness, since the ink bleeds a little more on 
matte papers, but the difference is quite small. It’s up to you to decide whether 
it’s worthwhile making separate sharpening routines for the same device on 
matte and glossy papers. It’s almost certainly overkill to make more than 
two paper-speciﬁ c routines.

A MULTIPASS SHARPENING WORKFLOW
105
Unlike all the previous sharpening passes, output sharpening is applied 
globally to the entire image, with no masking, and often to the entire tonal 
range without protecting the highlights and shadows. It’s by far the simplest 
of the sharpening passes, but it’s a vital one. 
Figure 3-10 shows the ﬁ nal result of capture sharpening, creative sharpen-
ing, and output sharpening.
Figure 3-9 This fi gure 
shows the result of resizing 
the image to the fi nal size, 
and resolution for the book

Identifying Hamish: A Case for CSI
When Jeff  was preparing screenshots for this edition of the book, he thought 
he recognized this Highland steer as being Hamish from Real World Camera Raw 
with Adobe Photoshop CS4—or at least he thought he did. How many Highland 
steers could Bruce have photographed while visiting Scotland?
Figure 3-11 shows both images.
The metadata indicates that image _MG_5589 was shot on August 4, 2005, and 
image _MG_6044 was shot four days later, on the 8th. Jeff  thought the odds 
were pretty good that this might be a case of Bruce revisiting a likely subject 
and that both shots were of Hamish—whose horns, apparently, the Scots have 
a hard time keeping American tourists from grabbing.
There are enough points of similarity in the steer’s nose that Jeff  feels confi dent 
that even the TV show CSI would conclude that both images are of the same 
Highland steer (even though in the two shots, Hamish tried to disguise himself 
by parting his hair diff erently).

BENEFITS OF A MULTIPASS
SHARPENING WORKFLOW
If care and craft are applied to the development of a sharpening workﬂ ow, 
the beneﬁ ts of such workﬂ ow far outweigh what may be seen as more steps 
and more work. Even in a high-production environment, a properly designed 
workﬂ ow can lead to improved results with more efﬁ cient processes. 
Use-Neutral Capture-Sharpened Master 
Images
The combination of source and content optimization produces a “use-neutral” 
master image that can be repurposed for different outputs. The optimized 
image can be downsampled or, to a lesser extent, upsampled, then sharpened 
for the speciﬁ c use at hand. This is a very different model from the tradi-
tional sharpening workﬂ ow, where sharpening starts from scratch at every 
different use. The presharpened image becomes a digital asset, ready for a 
wide range of output uses.
Of course, there are limits. Film grain makes scanned images less amenable 
to resizing than digital captures, but experience suggests that we can upsam-
ple presharpened digital captures to 200% or downsample to 10% without 
additional handling beyond output sharpening.
Fixed Output Sharpening
A second beneﬁ t of this workﬂ ow is that, since all the image-speciﬁ c and 
source-speciﬁ c issues have already been addressed, output sharpening 
becomes a ﬁ xed, determinate process that requires no decision-making. 
Since the relationship between input pixels and output dots (or output pixels, 
if the output is to the display) is ﬁ xed—that is, it doesn’t vary from image to 
image—it becomes possible to create optimal routines for output sharpen-
ing that do not and need not vary with image source or content.

CREATING A MULTIAPPLICATION SHARPENING WORKFLOW
109
In the future, such sharpening routines may be embedded in printer drivers 
or RIPs (raster image processors), where they can be applied automatically. 
(Many workﬂ ows already rely on in-RIP separations and in-RIP trapping, 
so in-RIP sharpening doesn’t seem like much of a stretch.) At this stage in 
the workﬂ ow, only these factors inﬂ uence sharpening:
• 
The type of output (halftone, continuous-tone, inkjet, etc.)
• 
The image size and resolution
• 
The paper type (glossy/coated papers need slightly less—and different—
sharpening than matte/uncoated ones to achieve the same apparent 
sharpness)
All these factors are known at print time, so output sharpening becomes a 
simple matter of selecting and running the appropriate routine. This is one 
of the beneﬁ ts with Adobe Lightroom’s Print module. Output sharpening 
can be applied on the ﬂ y during the printing process, which greatly aids 
output efﬁ ciency and consistency.
CREATING A MULTIAPPLICATION
SHARPENING WORKFLOW
So far we’ve not really broken down the various sharpening tools available 
in Photoshop, Camera Raw, and Lightroom. In Chapter 5, we’ll concentrate 
on explaining the relative beneﬁ ts and various sharpening techniques avail-
able in these applications. But we wanted to give an outline and a ﬂ owchart 
in this chapter. 
Which application you use for which function will play a role in deﬁ ning 
your own personal sharpening workﬂ ow. Figure 3-12 shows a potential 
sharpening workﬂ ow deploying Photoshop, Camera Raw, and Lightroom 
for various tasks. As you can see, there are various options depending on 
whether the source image is a scan or a capture. Lightroom can be used 
for database organizational tasks while also developing capture sharpening 
settings in the Develop module.

Sharpening in Photoshop
As the granddaddy of digital-imaging applications, there’s no doubt one can 
“do it all” with Photoshop (or one of its third-party plug-ins). Photoshop’s 
main sharpening tools are the Unsharp Mask and Smart Sharpen ﬁ lters. 
There are a wide variety (some might say dizzying variety) of other methods 
of sharpening using a variety of other tools, ﬁ lters, and layers. Noise reduc-
tion can also be handled using the Reduce Noise ﬁ lter or other ﬁ lters and 
tools. Figure 3-13 shows the main tools in Photoshop’s arsenal.

The massive power and complicated ﬂ exibility of Photoshop must also be 
considered a usability weakness. While all the tools provide virtually unlim-
ited functionality, it’s left to the user to ﬁ gure out what tool to use, and in 
what order, to accomplish a sharpening workﬂ ow. Then, as if Photoshop 
weren’t enough functionality, you have a healthy third-party developer com-
munity offering specialized tools that further extend Photoshop. 
Sharpening in Camera Raw
Camera Raw 5.2+, which works with Photoshop CS4, offers the potential 
for a complete sharpening workﬂ ow. In practice however, Camera Raw 
really excels in capture sharpening. 
Figure 3-14 shows Camera Raw’s main sharpening toolset for capture 
and creative sharpening. The Detail panel allows four parameters under 
Sharpening and two under Noise Reduction. We would argue that the 
Luminance noise-reduction slider is really the ﬁ fth sharpening slider, because 
unless you ﬁ ne-tune the Luminance noise reduction, you won’t be able to 
ﬁ ne-tune the Detail slider of Sharpening.

Camera Raw does have a localized sharpening channel available as an 
Adjustment Brush. However, Jeff believes that the Sharpness slider of the 
Adjustment Brush is a good placeholder for a tool yet to be developed, as 
the current implementation leaves a lot to be desired. As it stands in Camera 
Raw 5.x, it’s not really ready for prime time as a creative sharpening tool. 
Ironically, Clarity (with either negative or positive numbers) is a very useful 
creative sharpening tool.
NOTE: Camera Raw 5.0, which shipped in October 2008, was updated with new 
functionality in version 5.2 at the end of November 2008. One of the big changes to 
5.2 was output sharpening being added to the Camera Raw 5.2 Workfl ow Options dialog. 
This was consistent with Lightroom 2.2 and was part of the agreement between Adobe and 
PixelGenius to incorporate Bruce Fraser’s PhotoKit Sharpener’s output sharpening philoso-
phies into Lightroom and Camera Raw.
As far as the output sharpening available in Camera Raw, it works in version 
5.2 and above, but only in very limited uses where the exact ﬁ nal size and 
resolution can be determined and set inside of Camera Raw. Figure 3-15 
shows the Camera Raw Workﬂ ow Options dialog. Since Output Sharpening 
must be applied only after the ﬁ nal size and resolution can be determined, 
that limits the type of output for which Camera Raw can be used.
Sharpening in Lightroom
Lightroom shares the same processing pipeline found in Camera Raw. So, 
while usability may vary, the same parameters set in Lightroom and Camera 
Raw will produce the same rendered result. The primary differences are 
usability and user interface.

Workfl ow Options dialog

Lightroom also shares the relatively limited creative sharpening tools found 
in Camera Raw’s Adjustment Brush. We suggest very limited use of the 
Sharpness slider in the Adjustment Brush, as over-application cannot be 
undone once an image has been processed as a rendered image ﬁ le. 
Figure 3-16 shows Lightroom’s capture and creative sharpening options.
Lightroom’s output sharpening is arguably much more reﬁ ned and useful 
than what is currently found in Camera Raw. Since Lightroom can sharpen 
on the ﬂ y when sending an image to a printer, there’s no need for resizing 
and resharpening different versions of the same image. Lightroom takes 
the current capture sharpening, applies it to the image in memory, resizes 
(and/or resamples) the image for the image cell size, and sharpens the image 
data on the way to the printer. This on-the-ﬂ y print sharpening is one of 
the reasons that printing out of Lightroom is one of the program’s most 
popular features.

Figure 3-17 shows print sharpening in Lightroom’s Print module and 
Export dialog box. 
Lightroom can also deploy output sharpening when exporting images, as 
shown in Figure 3-17. Lightroom offers more control over ﬁ nal image size 
and resolution than Camera Raw does, so the option to use output sharpen-
ing upon export is enhanced.
Output Sharpening in Practice
In this book, we’re limited to showing the output sharpening for the 150-line 
screen used to print it. But within these constraints, we can show how output 
sharpening interacts with the previous stages of the sharpening workﬂ ow 
on the same images downsampled to different resolutions.
Figure 3-18 shows several versions of an image. All versions were produced 
from the same native-resolution master ﬁ le. The only differences are in the 
output resolution and the output sharpening that accommodates it, and 
whether or not it had been optimized for source and content.

CHAPTER 3: SHARPENING STRATEGIES
118
There may be very little visible difference between the two sharpened 
images, since the difference between 300 ppi and 225 ppi will show subtle 
differences in print. In practice, you need to send somewhere between 1.5 
and two times the halftone line screen for adequate halftone dot creation. 
We tend to stick with the 2x ﬁ gure because our experience shows it’s opti-
mal for photography.
Output sharpening is very much like traditional prepress sharpening. You’ll 
see that the versions without optimization for source and content aren’t 
unacceptably soft, but you’ll also see that the optimized versions are sharper, 
without appearing oversharpened. The optimizations for source and content 
allow us to take the same master ﬁ le and produce optimally sharp versions 
of the image at different sizes and resolutions simply by downsampling and 
applying the appropriate output sharpeners.
Output Sharpening and the Display
Just to round out the picture, Figure 3-19 shows a zoomed detail of the opti-
mized and output-sharpened image that corresponds roughly to viewing 
the image pixels on screen at 200% and 400% zoom. We included these 
views not because attempting to judge sharpness by looking at pixels at 200% 
or 400% zoom is a useful or even rational activity—it isn’t—but simply to 
dramatize the fact that images that are well sharpened for output will almost 
certainly look scary on the computer display. 
We fully admit that Figure 3-19 forces you to engage in an unseemly activity 
commonly called “pixel-peeping.” Photoshop CS4 even allows you to extend 
the degree of peeping to an eerie 3200% zoom. While we’ll admit to some-
times gleaning useful image info from 400% zooms, we’ve never gotten 
anything useful out of looking at an image at 3200%.
As we explained back in Chapter 2, it’s nearly impossible to judge ﬁ nal print 
sharpness from the display. At the risk of some redundancy, we reiterate the 
point here because it bears repeating. One of the biggest leaps of faith in the 
entire Photoshop universe is sending pixels that look hideous on screen to 
a printing device. But if the pixels don’t look seriously crunchy on the dis-
play, you’re almost certainly undersharpening your images. The only reliable 
way to evaluate print sharpening is to sharpen the image, print it, and look 
at the print!

FROM THEORY TO PRACTICE
Thus far, the focus of this book has been to expound the theory of a 
workﬂ ow-based approach to sharpening images. In the ensuing chapters, 
we’ll shift that focus to concentrate on the practical application of the theory. 
Good sharpening requires mastery of a signiﬁ cant body of technique and 
knowledge of some of the murkier depths of Photoshop. So in Chapter 4 we 
cover all the tools we use, and in Chapter 5 we cover all the techniques and 
tricks that we use in our own sharpening workﬂ ow, including nondestructive 
layer-based sharpening and the all-important use of layer masks.

chapter

Sharpening Tools 
Learning to Sharpen
Thus far, this book has been fairly long on theory and short on practice. 
In this chapter, we’ll switch focus to looking in depth at what the tools 
Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Camera Raw, and Adobe Lightroom offer for 
sharpening images, and how to use them effectively in a capture-to-output 
sharpening workﬂ ow. The tools themselves are important, but there’s a 
world of difference between simply running the Unsharp Mask ﬁ lter on a 
ﬂ attened image and running it on a layer with an edge mask: The former 
uses a tool, while the latter employs a technique.
So in this chapter, we’ll explain the basic tools, but we’ll also discuss using 
those tools in ways that may not be obvious. Of course, Photoshop always 
offers multiple ways to carry out any given task. It’s not our intention to 
cover every possible way to sharpen pixels. To do so would greatly lengthen 
this book, and take us into territories that our friend and colleague Fred 
Bunting eloquently describes as “more interesting than relevant.” 
Instead, we’ll cover the tools that we’ve tested exhaustively, that we use on 
a daily basis, and in which we have total conﬁ dence. If a treasured trick of 
yours isn’t covered here, don’t worry—it’s entirely possible that you know 
something that we don’t. By the same token, if we debunk a cherished 
myth, rest assured that we do so without malice—at some point in time, 
they were very likely myths that we, too, cherished.

CHAPTER 4: SHARPENING TOOLS
122
SHARPENING TOOLS IN PHOTOSHOP
Photoshop offers a variety of sharpening tools, ranging from the indispens-
able Unsharp Mask ﬁ lter to the extremely hard to control Sharpen tool. But 
Photoshop also offers ways to sharpen images using features that don’t pro-
vide any hint by their names that sharpening is one of their capabilities. 
Everyone has their preferred sets of tools, but few of us actually spend time 
analyzing what they do, so before examining the tools themselves, let us 
show you an easy way to see the effects of different sharpening routines.
Analyzing Sharpeners
One very easy way to compare the effect of different sharpening routines is 
to look at what they do to a variety of edges with different contrast. Figure 
4-1 shows a simple test ﬁ le that you can make yourself, which contains a 
single edge with varying contrast from solid black on white to midtone gray 
on midtone gray.
There are, of course, several ways to create a target like this. For on-screen 
use, which is what this target is best for, we do the following:
1. Create a new document, either RGB or Grayscale, 512 pixels wide by 
50 pixels tall.
2. Fill it with a black-to-white gradient using the Gradient tool.
3. Select either the top or the bottom half of the image (the selection 
should be 512 pixels by 25 pixels—you can use the Info palette and/or 
the rulers to get the selection the right size).
4. Invert the selected area (choose Image > Adjustments > Invert, or 
press Command-I).
5. Crop the image in half horizontally from the right edge to obtain an 
image that looks like Figure 4-1, 256 pixels wide by 50 pixels tall.
Figure 4-1 
Sharpener analysis target

SHARPENING TOOLS IN PHOTOSHOP
123
If you zoom to around 400% or 500%, the target will still ﬁ t most screens, 
and you can easily see what happens at the pixel level. This target helps you 
understand what different sharpening tools do to edges, with the important 
caveat that their behavior on real images may be more complex than on this 
simple target.
The Sharpen Filter
Located on the Filter > Sharpen submenu, the Sharpen ﬁ lter applies a simple, 
nonadjustable sharpening routine that creates a single-pixel halo for the 
light contour and a single-pixel halo for the dark contour. The haloes reach 
maximum intensity (solid black and pure white) when the difference 
between the light and dark sides of the edge is 169 levels.
Sharpen is virtually identical to running the Unsharp Mask ﬁ lter (discussed 
later in this chapter) with Amount at 130, Radius at 0.4, and Threshold at 0. 
Figure 4-2 shows the target from Figure 4-1 after applying the Sharpen ﬁ lter.
The Sharpen More Filter
As its name suggests, the Sharpen More ﬁ lter, also on the Filter > Sharpen 
submenu, is a stronger version of Sharpen. It also creates a single-pixel halo, 
but reaches maximum intensity sooner, when the difference between the 
light and dark sides of the edges is 85 levels.
Sharpen More is virtually identical to running the Unsharp Mask ﬁ lter with 
Amount at 390, Radius at 0.4, and Threshold at 0. Figure 4-3 shows the 
target from Figure 4-1 after applying the Sharpen More ﬁ lter.
Figure 4-2

NOTE: Frankly, we 
don’t use this or the 
Sharpen fi lter, because we can 
obtain the same results using 
the Unsharp Mask fi lter.

Sharpen More fi lter

CHAPTER 4: SHARPENING TOOLS
124
The Sharpen Edges Filter
Sharpen Edges, which appears on the Sharpen submenu of the Filter menu 
between Sharpen and Sharpen More, is a little different than those ﬁ lters: 
Its effect can’t be replicated exactly using Unsharp Mask. However, 
Unsharp Mask with Amount at 140, Radius at 0.4, and Threshold at 3 
comes very close—the Unsharp Mask produces very slightly stronger con-
trast in the midtones. Like Sharpen, Sharpen Edges reaches maximum 
intensity at a difference of 169 levels. The main difference between the two 
is that Sharpen Edges has a gentler start on values that differ only slightly.
Sharpen Edges isn’t really any more useful than Sharpen or Sharpen 
More—the difference between what it does and what we can accomplish 
with Unsharp Mask is so small as to be merely academically interesting, 
and the lack of control makes it inﬂ exible. 
Figure 4-4 shows the target from Figure 4-1 after applying the Sharpen 
Edges ﬁ lter.
While the ﬁ rst three entries on the Filter > Sharpen submenu are mostly 
of academic interest, the last two, Smart Sharpen and Unsharp Mask, are 
essential sharpening tools. However, it’s just about impossible to understand 
Smart Sharpen until you’ve mastered Unsharp Mask, so we’ll discuss 
Unsharp Mask ﬁ rst.
The Unsharp Mask Filter
The Unsharp Mask ﬁ lter is by far the most important item in the sharpen-
ing toolbox—if we were forced to rely on a single sharpening tool, we’d 
choose Unsharp Mask for its speed, power, and ﬂ exibility. In short, Unsharp 
Mask is indispensable! Unlike Sharpen, Sharpen Edges, and Sharpen More, 
all of which simply apply preset routines, the Unsharp Mask ﬁ lter offers a 
great deal of control over sharpening. 
Figure 4-4 
Sharpen Edges fi lter

SHARPENING TOOLS IN PHOTOSHOP
125
Figure 4-5 shows the Unsharp Mask ﬁ lter dialog box at its default settings: 
Amount at 100, Radius at 1, and Threshold at 0. Note, however, that the 
settings are sticky (remembered) between ﬁ lter applications, so you’ll see the 
default settings only once. 
Figure 4-5 Unsharp Mask dialog box
Mastery of these three Unsharp Mask controls is the key to good 
sharpening:
• 
Amount
• 
Radius
• 
Threshold
Amount
The Amount control sets the intensity of the sharpening halo—the increase 
in contrast along edges. At low settings, it takes more difference between 
levels for the sharpening haloes to reach pure white and solid black; at 
higher settings, it takes less difference. 
Figure 4-6 shows the effect of the Amount slider at constant Radius and 
Threshold settings.

CHAPTER 4: SHARPENING TOOLS
126
Radius
The Radius control sets the width of the sharpening haloes, though it also 
has some effect on their intensity. However, because it was designed by 
engineers rather than photographers, the number you enter into the Radius 
ﬁ eld doesn’t actually produce haloes of that size (not that it’s possible to pro-
duce a sharpening halo 0.4 pixels wide).
What the Radius setting actually does is a little more complicated than add-
ing a determined pixel halo. The Unsharp Mask ﬁ lter changes pixels one at 
a time, examining the surrounding pixels to determine the difference in 
contrast between the subject pixel and its neighbors. The Radius setting tells 
the ﬁ lter how many surrounding pixels to take into account when calculat-
ing the new value for the subject pixel.

maximum intensity at the 
selected Radius.

127
The net effect is that low Radius settings produce narrow sharpening haloes 
and higher settings produce wider ones. (At very high settings, the sharpen-
ing haloes collide and merge into one another, so the effect changes from a 
pure sharpening to an overall contrast adjustment—see “Local Area Contrast,” 
later in this chapter.)
Figure 4-7 shows the effect of the Radius setting at constant Amount and 
Threshold settings. (We’ve zoomed and cropped the target to exclude the 
higher-contrast edges so that the difference between settings is more obvi-
ous.) Lower settings produce narrower haloes and higher settings produce 
wider ones, but the width of the haloes also depends on the contrast of the 
edge that’s being sharpened.

The red line shows the point at which 
the sharpening haloes reach maximum

The width of the haloes increases with 
contrast at any single Radius setting.

CHAPTER 4: SHARPENING TOOLS
128
Notice that the intensity of the haloes increases with Radius—at higher set-
tings, the sharpening haloes reach solid black and pure white earlier than 
they do at lower settings. However, Radius has a much smaller effect on 
intensity than Amount does.
The Radius control determines the “ﬂ avor” of the sharpening. Low-frequency 
images with wide edges and soft detail require higher Radius settings than 
high-frequency images with narrow edges and sharp tonal transitions. One 
of the most important aspects of sharpening images for content is matching 
the Radius setting to the edges in the image.
One aspect of  Unsharp Mask that’s less than optimal is the fact that it increases 
the width of the sharpening haloes as the contrast of the edge being sharp-
ened increases. This is rarely the behavior we want. 
Threshold 
Threshold delays the onset of the sharpening haloes by telling the Unsharp 
Mask ﬁ lter to ignore a certain amount of difference between pixels before 
applying any sharpening. Figure 4-8 shows the effect of the Threshold set-
ting at constant settings for Radius and Amount—we’ve cropped the target 
to show the areas of interest.
The Threshold control is designed to allow you to protect textured areas, 
such as skin tones or slightly noisy skies, from being sharpened. At low set-
tings (1 to 4), it works reasonably well on lightly textured areas, but may not 
provide enough protection. At higher settings, Threshold has a tendency to 
create unnatural-looking transitions between the sharpened and unsharp-
ened areas. Because of this tendency, generally we rely on edge masks to 
protect textured areas rather than using Threshold. We’ll cover techniques 
for doing so later in this chapter.

SHARPENING TOOLS IN PHOTOSHOP
129
Working the Controls
Whether we apply Unsharp Mask globally or through a layer mask, we 
always set the Radius ﬁ rst, because more than any of the controls, it dictates 
the character of the sharpening. Many different combinations of Amount 
and Radius produce the same apparent amount of sharpening, but with sub-
tly different characteristics.
As you increase the Radius, you need to reduce the Amount, and vice versa, 
to maintain the same degree of apparent sharpness. Figure 4-9 shows the 
same image detail with two very different Unsharp Mask settings that 
nevertheless produce approximately the same degree of sharpness.

The difference between the two versions below is extremely subtle—we’d 
be surprised if you can see it—but that subtle difference becomes more 
obvious when a second round of sharpening is applied for the output. 
Figure 4-10 shows the same image detail-sharpened for output, along with 
a 400% zoomed-in view of the output-sharpened pixels.
Before output sharpening, the two versions seemed identical, but after output 
sharpening we begin to see subtle differences. The high-frequency detail on 
the ﬂ ower center is revealed more clearly in the lower, small-radius version 
than in the upper, larger-radius version. Examination of the zoomed-in 
pixels conﬁ rms this—the detail on the yellow center has higher contrast, 
and hence is more visible, in the small-radius version.

131
Figure 4-10 shows something else important: While targets like the one ﬁ rst 
shown in Figure 4-1 can help us understand a good deal about the basic 
behavior of sharpening tools, the application of those tools to real photo-
graphic images is a good deal more complicated, because edges in real 
images are often more complex than a single row of dark pixels against a 
single row of white pixels. 
The behavior of the target might lead you to expect that the versions of the 
image in Figure 4-10 that were sharpened with a Radius setting of 1.5 might 
feature wider sharpening haloes than the one sharpened with a Radius set-
ting of 0.4. Yet in practice the haloes have essentially the same width in both 
versions, because the image edges themselves constrain the width of the 
haloes. The higher-Radius version simply ends up with weaker contrast on 
the haloes.

CHAPTER 4: SHARPENING TOOLS
132
Unsharp Mask Limitations
Unsharp Mask is an immensely useful and powerful tool, but it suffers 
from two signiﬁ cant limitations:
• 
The Threshold control isn’t terribly good at protecting noisy or lightly 
textured areas from sharpening. At low settings, it may not provide 
enough protection, while at higher settings it can produce unnatural-
looking transitions. More signiﬁ cantly, the Threshold control wipes out 
midtone sharpening, which is often where we need it most.
• 
Unsharp Mask always sharpens high-contrast edges more than low-
contrast ones, which is usually the exact opposite of the behavior we 
need. On edges that are already at maximum contrast (solid black and 
pure white), Unsharp Mask simply widens the sharpening halo—a 
behavior that’s almost always undesirable.
Local Area Contrast
Earlier in this section we mentioned using Unsharp Mask with a smaller 
Amount setting and larger Radius to adjust what some people call the 
“local area contrast.” Substantially increasing the Radius to 50 or more 
actually inverts the edges and introduces a contrast adjustment that is image 
dependent. Thus, the image edges are used to adjust the tonal curve. This 
image-adaptive adjustment isn’t really a sharpening effect from the Unsharp 
Mask ﬁ lter, but it can produce useful results. Figure 4-11 shows the Unsharp 
Mask dialog box with lowered Amount and higher Radius.
Local area contrast image adjustments are similar to the Clarity slider of 
Camera Raw and Lightroom. Yet there is a different method of producing 
what we refer to as “midtone contrast” adjustments using the High Pass 
ﬁ lter on an image layer set to Overlay blend mode.

The Smart Sharpen Filter
The Smart Sharpen ﬁ lter is a good deal more complex than the Unsharp 
Mask ﬁ lter because it offers more options. Figure 4-12 shows the Smart 
Sharpen dialog box in Basic mode.
Smart Sharpen has no Threshold control, only Radius and Amount, but the 
additional controls it offers add up to many different permutations:
• 
The Basic and Advanced radio buttons control whether the Shadow and 
Highlight tabs become available. In Advanced mode, these two additional 
tabs let you shape the tonality of the light and dark contours, allowing 
you to reduce the sharpening on high-contrast edges (see Figure 4-13).
• 
The Remove menu lets you choose one of three ﬂ avors of sharpening. 
Remove Gaussian Blur works essentially the same as Unsharp Mask, 
Remove Lens Blur uses a different sharpening algorithm that attempts 
to differentiate actual edges from image noise, and Remove Motion 
Blur lets you (within limits) undo motion blur caused by subject or 
camera movement.
• 
Selecting the More Accurate checkbox makes the ﬁ lter run more itera-
tions, producing a signiﬁ cantly different result than when it’s unselected. 
It also makes the ﬁ lter run more slowly.
Figure 4-12 
Smart Sharpen dialog box

135
Smart Sharpen also allows you to save commonly used parameters and call 
them back up as needed. Figure 4-14 shows the Save and Trash buttons, the 
New Filter Settings dialog box, and the saved setting in Smart Sharpen’s 
drop-down menu.

Gaussian Blur
When Gaussian Blur is selected from the Remove menu, the More Accurate 
checkbox is unselected and the ﬁ lter is in Basic mode. It behaves identically 
to Unsharp Mask with the same Amount and Radius settings and Threshold 
at 0.
When the More Accurate checkbox is selected, the ﬁ lter behavior changes, 
producing a wider halo with gentler contrast. Figure 4-15 shows the differ-
ence between Gaussian Blur, Basic mode, with More Accurate unselected 
(which is the same as Unsharp Mask), and Gaussian Blur, Basic mode, with 
More Accurate selected.
When More Accurate is unselected (upper image), Smart Sharpen with Gaussian Blur behaves 
exactly like Unsharp Mask. When More Accurate is selected (lower image), Smart Sharpen produces 
a wider, lower-contrast halo. The red line indicates where the sharpening haloes reach maximum 
intensity.
On real images, Gaussian Blur with More Accurate selected produces much 
weaker sharpening than when it’s unselected, so much so that small-radius 
sharpening is very weak indeed. Figure 4-16 shows an image detail that had 
Smart Sharpening applied for content before being sharpened for output, 
using Amount 500 and Radius 0.5, with More Accurate unselected, and 
with More Accurate selected.
Both versions are acceptable, but the one that had the More Accurate button 
unselected has a little more snap. Numerous similar examples have led us to 
conclude that in the majority of cases, Smart Sharpen with Gaussian Blur in 
Basic mode offers little or no advantage over Unsharp Mask.

Gaussian Blur Advanced Mode
When the Advanced radio button is selected, the Shadow and Highlight tabs 
(see Figure 4-13) become active. These tabs let you fade the contrast of the 
dark and light sharpening contours, respectively. 
Both tabs offer the same three controls: Fade Amount, Tonal Width, and 
Radius, which together determine the way the Shadow (dark) and Highlight 
(light) contours along edges have their intensity reduced.
•
Fade Amount controls the degree of fading of the Shadow or Highlight 
contour.
•
Tonal Width controls the tonal range across which the fade applies, 
starting from solid black (level 0) for the Shadow contour and pure 
white (level 255) for the Highlight contour.

•
Radius works akin to the Radius control in Photoshop’s Shadow/
Highlight image adjustment command, specifying the neighborhood the 
ﬁ lter evaluates in determining whether a pixel is a Shadow or Highlight 
pixel and hence is affected by the Shadow and Highlight tab settings. 
When used in conjunction with Gaussian Blur, the effect of the Radius 
setting is barely detectable (and is detectable only by doing actual pixel-value 
comparisons—you can’t see it). However, it has an obvious effect, not on the 
image, but on the speed of the ﬁ lter—it’s much, much slower at high Radius 
settings than at lower ones!
Figure 4-17 shows the effect of the Advanced mode options at several differ-
ent settings. The difference between (Advanced) Radius set at 1 and the 
much slower (Advanced) Radius set at 100 is detectable, though not terribly 
visually signiﬁ cant, when the Tonal Width is set to a low amount, but it’s 
basically insigniﬁ cant at higher Tonal Width settings.
The ability to fade the highlight and shadow contours, and thus force more 
of the sharpening into the midtones, is useful for early-stage sharpening for 
image content, but you can lose a lot of time ﬁ ddling with settings that 
make almost no difference to the result!

Lens Blur
Choosing Lens Blur from the Remove menu makes Smart Sharpen use a 
different algorithm that sharpens the midtones rather more aggressively 
than either Unsharp Mask or Smart Sharpen with Gaussian Blur. The More 
Accurate and Advanced options modulate the effect of the sharpening much 
like they do when Gaussian Blur is selected.
Figure 4-18 compares the Lens Blur and Gaussian Blur “ﬂ avors” of sharpen-
ing at two different strengths, with More Accurate on and off.

Lens Blur tends to sharpen the midtones 
more aggressively than Gaussian Blur, 
and maintains tighter haloes as edge 
contrast increases.
The red lines indicate the maximum 
intensity of the sharpening haloes.

The More Accurate option works approximately the same with Lens Blur as 
it does with Gaussian Blur, making a slightly wider but gentler sharpening 
halo. The most obvious difference between Gaussian Blur and Lens Blur is 
that the latter does a much better job of controlling the width of the halo 
along high-contrast edges than does Gaussian Blur, which creates ever-
widening haloes as contrast increases. 
Lens Blur Advanced Mode
The Advanced option enables Smart Sharpen’s Shadow and Highlight tabs, 
allowing you to fade the light and dark contours of the sharpening haloes. 
The controls operate similarly to the way they do with Gaussian Blur 
(including the dramatic slowdown produced by high Radius settings in the 
Shadow and Highlight tabs), but the effect of the Shadow and Highlight 
Radius settings is a little more discernible than with Gaussian Blur, as 
shown in Figure 4-19.
With Lens Blur, the Advanced options do a better job of sharpening mid-
tones while protecting extreme highlights and shadows than they do with 
Gaussian Blur. But the effects of the Radius setting are still quite subtle, and

the extreme slowdowns caused by high Radius settings in the Shadow and 
Highlight tabs provide an exercise in frustration.
 
WARNING: Advanced options persist even when they’re hidden. One of the more 
infuriating aspects of Smart Sharpen is that switching from Advanced to Basic mode 
doesn’t actually turn off  the settings in the Shadow and Highlight tabs—it just hides them. 
So it’s all too easy to fade the highlights and shadows without meaning to. The only safe 
solution is to always use Advanced mode, and always check the settings in the Shadow and 
Highlight tabs before doing anything else. Otherwise you may fi nd yourself getting entirely 
unexpected results.
Figure 4-20 shows the same image detail unsharpened and then sharpened 
with Unsharp Mask, and ﬁ nally Smart Sharpen using the Gaussian and the

CHAPTER 4: SHARPENING TOOLS

Smart Sharpen does a good job on the high-frequency detail (though the 
difference between the Gaussian and the Lens options is very subtle indeed), 
but copes less well with the soft edges where the Lens option can introduce 
undesirable edge artifacts. It should be noted that all of the sharpening in 
Figure 4-20 was done without the beneﬁ t of using an edge mask, which we 
consider a requirement when using these tools for capture sharpening.
Motion Blur
The third and ﬁ nal Smart Sharpen ﬂ avor, Motion Blur, is (as its name sug-
gests) designed to undo motion blur caused by subject or camera movement. 
Don’t expect miracles—those happen only on TV crime shows—but with 
care, Smart Sharpen with Motion Blur can do a reasonable job of extracting 
detail from a moving subject. Figure 4-21 shows one such example of a 
more theoretical nature.
When Motion Blur is selected from the Remove menu, one additional con-
trol, Angle, becomes enabled. The Angle setting is the key parameter in 
using Smart Sharpen’s Motion Blur mode to undo motion blur. Just click to 
drag the angle or enter in a rotation by degree. Once the Angle is correct, 
the next step is to set the Radius and Amount, followed by the options in 
the Shadow and Highlight tabs. 
Figure 4-21 shows the Motion Blur tool’s theoretical capabilities. It’s actually 
doing a reasonable job of unblurring the artiﬁ cially blurred image with only 
a few defects. The Motion Blur option is using a deconvolution algorithm to 
reverse the effects of the convolution—in this case, the motion blur that was 
intentionally applied to the circles. To determine the optimal deconvolution 
that would remove the blur, the exact nature of the cause of the blur or its 
point spread function (PSF) needs to be determined. The Smart Sharpen 
Motion Blur removal uses the Amount and Radius as well as angular direction 
settings to attempt to unblur the motion.
 
NOTE: When the Hubble Space Telescope was fi rst launched into space, scientists 
were dismayed to discover that the telescope’s mirrors were fl awed, which caused 
distorted and blurry images. Yet because the exact nature of the mirror fl aws were known, 
deconvolution image processing could substantially sharpen the images. However, as with 
Smart Sharpen, it was only an improvement, not a fi x. Since the Hubble mirror was so precise 
but too big to replace in space, the solution was to design new optical components with 
exactly the same error, but in the opposite direction, to be added to the telescope at the 
servicing mission. This was eff ectively like applying glasses to correct the spherical aberration.

The unblurring of the image can certainly be useful, but in the real world, it 
can do only so much. Since there is no way to create a mathematically precise 
PSF, Smart Sharpen can go only so far with the deconvolution. Currently 
the maximum radius is only 64 pixels, which often falls short of ﬁ xing many 
images. Additionally, if either the subject or camera blur is not in an exact 
straight line, the unblurring can’t really ﬁ x the blur. We ﬁ nd that the Motion 
Blur removal can only help, not remove, the blur. 
Figure 4-22 shows the use of Smart Sharpen to reduce (not totally eliminate) 
motion blur.

Unlike the other Smart Sharpen ﬂ avors, Motion Blur rarely works when it’s 
applied to an entire image. It’s best used for unblurring speciﬁ c subjects in 
the image, and the work goes much faster if you make a rough selection of 
the subject, then copy it to a new layer. Once the sharpening is applied, you 
can either erase the unwanted areas from the rough selection or mask them 
using a layer mask, as we did in the example shown in Figure 4-23.

Smart Sharpen Issues
Smart Sharpen is an intriguing tool that has won its share of devotees. 
We confess that we can’t number ourselves among them. We do use Smart 
Sharpen for some tasks—the Motion Blur option is the only game in town 
for undoing motion blur, and Smart Sharpen works very well indeed for 
on-screen output, which typically involves fairly small ﬁ les. On print-
resolution images, however, Smart Sharpen is often infuriatingly slow.

CHAPTER 4: SHARPENING TOOLS
146
The persistence of the Shadow and Highlight settings when the ﬁ lter has been 
switched back to Basic mode has undoubtedly caused a great deal of head-
scratching, and is at best a questionable design decision. And while the Shadow 
and Highlight tabs attempt to address a real issue—reducing the intensity 
of the highlight and shadow contours—they simply don’t offer the degree of 
control we need. As a result, we still rely on the Unsharp Mask ﬁ lter for the 
majority of our sharpening tasks.
The Sharpen Tool
Before continuing with Photoshop’s array of sharpening tools, we would be remiss if we didn’t mention the 
one tool in Photoshop that’s actually named the Sharpen tool. It’s a brush-based tool that shares a slot in 
Photoshop’s toolbox with the Blur tool and the Smudge tool. At its default setting of 50% opacity, it applies 
sharpening that is similar (but not identical) to the Sharpen fi lter—it’s a little more aggressive in the midtones 
than Sharpen.
Figure 4-24 shows the results of the Sharpen tool applied up to fi ve times. A single-pixel halo quickly turns into 
a grid of parallel lines. 
Used sparingly, at low opacities, the Sharpen Tool is moderately useful for adding a slight increase in sharpness 
to a specifi c area in the image. But caution is most defi nitely required, because repeated applications of the 
Sharpen tool can quickly destroy images! That’s why we suggest building your own sharpening brush, which 
will be covered in the next chapter.

However, it’s relatively rare for us to simply apply Unsharp Mask globally to 
an image. Instead, we use an edge mask, described later in this chapter. At 
ﬁ rst glance, making edge masks may seem to require more work than Smart 
Sharpen, but much of that work can be automated, and the actual routines 
run quite quickly. 
But before we get to making masks, we have an additional “tool” to discuss, 
even though there’s no name for it in Photoshop: We call it the Overlay/
High Pass method.
The Overlay/High Pass Method
There is no actual tool in Photoshop named “Overlay/High 
Pass”: You need to make this custom tool—or method, if you 
will—in Photoshop yourself. Overlay/High Pass refers to using 
an Overlay blend mode on an image layer and then applying the 
High Pass ﬁ lter to that layer, resulting in an important custom 
tool for image sharpening. We wish the Photoshop engineers 
would turn this into an actual tool, but until they do you must 
use this method to make your own. It’s worth the effort.
The High Pass Filter
The High Pass ﬁ lter actually does what its name suggests—it 
passes high-frequency image data, such as edges of an image, 
but blocks lower frequencies. The end result is that anything in 
the image that is not an edge gets turned into middle gray while 
the high-frequency edge is preserved based on the pixel radius.
Figure 4-25 shows what happens with the High Pass ﬁ lter 
being applied to the original sharpener analysis target in Figure 
4-1, at the beginning of this chapter. Admittedly, our sharpener 
analysis target is a theoretical image, but it does endeavor to 
show what the ﬁ lter is doing.

The Overlay Blend
Showing the sharpening effects on an image requires a series of steps that 
you must follow to prepare your image for applying this method. Figure 
4-26 shows the image we’ll be using as an example as well as the steps 
required for Overlay/High Pass sharpening. 
1. Start with an image and drag the layer’s icon to the New Layer icon on 
the Layers panel. 
This will duplicate the Background image layer. 
2. Change the layer’s blending mode from Normal to Overlay. This can 
be done in either the Layers panel or the Layer Style dialog box.

Pass steps

Layer Style is a big and somewhat intimidating dialog box that may be 
overkill for simply changing the blend mode. But this dialog box will 
become a cornerstone of sharpening techniques outlined in the next 
chapter, so get used to it. (It won’t bite, and Photoshop always has Undo 
in case you make an error.) 
Once the Background copy layer is set to the Overlay blend mode, 
you’ll note that the image gains contrast. This is to be expected and is 
the basis of how we’ll use this blending mode. The Overlay blend mode 
is a procedural blend that lightens the image’s lighter areas while dark-
ening the darks. The cutoff is middle gray (level 128 in an RGB ﬁ le). 
Above 128, Overlay uses a Screen mode to lighten the image. Below 
128, it uses Multiply to darken the image. If the tone is exactly level 128 
(as measured by the Eyedropper Tool), then nothing occurs.

3. Finally, use the High Pass ﬁ lter to turn everything that isn’t an edge 
into level 128 gray, which will do nothing to the underlying image. 
We’re using the combination of the Overlay blend mode’s inherent 
contrast boost with the High Pass ﬁ lter’s ability to ﬁ nd the edges while 
turning the non-edge image areas to a null gray. Adjusting the radius of 
the High Pass ﬁ lter controls the width of the area where the image con-
trast is boosted. A Radius of .5 or 1 will increase the contrast in only a 
very small area. Figure 4-27 shows the result of applying various Radius 
settings to the image.

SHARPENING TOOLS IN PHOTOSHOP
151
As you can see in Figure 4-27, the higher the Radius setting, the wider the 
sharpening haloes that are created. At this zoom (200%), the haloes are very 
obvious. That’s because the haloes are actually about six times wider than 
they would be for the actual print resolution of about 12” x 18” at 300 ppi. 
One limitation of the Overlay/High Pass sharpening method is there is no 
simple way of controlling the relative amount of the effect, other than using 
the layer’s opacity to reduce the strength or duplicating the layer to increase 
the strength, as shown in Figure 4-28. 
TIP: The Overlay blend mode isn’t the only procedural blend mode that can be useful 
with the High Pass fi lter. Soft Light and Hard Light are modifi ed versions of Overlay; 
their names describe their eff ects. Vivid Light, Linear Light, and Pin Light modes can also 
be used, though the odds are you’ll need to substantially reduce the opacity or face over-
blown eff ects. Of the procedural blend modes, only Overlay has a symmetrical eff ect on both 
shadows and highlights, and, as such, is the most useful blend mode for image sharpening.

CHAPTER 4: SHARPENING TOOLS
152
The power of the layer blending and the ﬂ exibility of combining layer 
masks to localize the effect of the Overlay/High Pass method makes this 
sharpening tool worth the extra effort to create it. Plus, it can be easily auto-
mated by creating an action, which will be discussed in depth in Chapter 6, 
“Putting the Tools to Work.”
We’ve covered the obvious and not so obvious sharpening tools found in 
Photoshop. That’s not to say there aren’t third-party tools that can be inter-
esting and useful––there are. But this book is about sharpening in 
Photoshop, and inside of Photoshop you’ll ﬁ nd plenty of tools that can 
sharpen your images. There is one additional and very important tool that 
anybody practiced in the art of image sharpening must know: creating an 
edge mask (and the edge mask’s alter ego, the surface mask) to control how 
areas of an image do or don’t get sharpened.
Edge and Surface Masks
The High Pass ﬁ lter is an example of how an algorithm that can ﬁ nd image 
edges use the edges to modify the image. Unfortunately there is no simple 
tool inside of Photoshop to generate an edge or surface mask. Creating these 
masks is essential for producing images with optimized sharpening and 
noise reduction. So, like the Overlay/High Pass sharpening method, you 
will need to create your own tools. Figure 4-29 shows the image we’ll be 
using to create an edge mask as well as the Channels panel. 
 
NOTE: This section is about creating edge masks, which are very similar to surface 
masks. Since the method outlined here is designed to fi nd, create, and enhance the 
edges, the inversions of the edges are considered the surfaces, or non-edge portions, of the 
image. Sometimes by simply inverting the edge mask (Image > Adjustments > Invert), a 
suitable surface mask will be the result. However, the surface mask will often need special 
modifi cations to spread or contract the mask. We’ll cover that in the next chapter.

SHARPENING TOOLS IN PHOTOSHOP
153
Edge Mask Beginnings
To create an edge mask, it is ideal to start with the luminosity of the image. 
There are a variety of methods, including using a copy of the Green channel 
of an RGB image or using a Calculations command to generate a specialized 
channel from other channels. In this basic look at creating an edge mask, we’ll 
use the simplest method: Command-clicking (Mac) or Control-clicking 
(Windows) the composite RGB channel in the Channels panel. You can also 
use the Command-Option-2 (Mac) or Control-Alt-2 (Windows) keyboard 
shortcuts. This loads the image’s luminosity as an active selection. From 
there, save the selection as a channel for further work.

CHAPTER 4: SHARPENING TOOLS
154
Once you have the basic channel created, target the channel and select 
Filter > Stylize > Find Edges. Not unlike the High Pass ﬁ lter, Find Edges 
looks for edges and separates them from the rest of the image. Since the ﬁ lter 
results in an inverted image, the result will need to be inverted again so the 
actual edges will end up becoming the selection (the white portions of the 
mask). If you were creating a surface mask, you would leave the image the 
way the Find Edges ﬁ lter left it. Figure 4-30 shows these three steps.

155
Tuning the Mask
If you were to use the edge mask in this current condition, the results of the 
sharpening would be too abrupt because the resulting selection would be 
too hard. So the next step we take is to soften the edges by using the Filter > 
Blur > Gaussian Blur ﬁ lter to essentially feather what will end up being the 
edges of the selection. (The Gaussian Blur ﬁ lter is the same algorithm as the 
Select > Modify > Feather command.) After blurring, we need to apply a 
tonal adjustment to the image. By clipping the highlights and shadows, we’ll 
add contrast to the mask in order to adjust where the sharpening will and 
won’t get applied. Figure 4-31 shows the result of blurring and adjusting the 
levels in the channel.

CHAPTER 4: SHARPENING TOOLS
156
The steps shown in 4-31 are not written in stone. There are a variety of 
methods of modifying the edge mask to ﬁ ne-tune the results to apply 
sharpening to speciﬁ c parts of the image. By using Find Edges and making 
further modiﬁ cations, we’re actually using the image itself to adapt the edge 
mask to the image. We could, of course, manually paint away any areas in 
the mask where we don’t want sharpening by painting black in the mask or 
add sharpening by painting white. Anything that alters the tonality of the 
mask will end up impacting how and where the ﬁ nal sharpening will or 
won’t be applied.
Preparing the Image for Sharpening
To prepare the image for sharpening, you could simply load the edge mask 
as a selection and apply any of the sharpening tools we’ve already outlined. 
However, that wouldn’t be optimal, as the resulting sharpening would be 
applied to the RGB color image. Sharpening the color data can result in 
sharpening artifacts being introduced into the color portions of the image. 
What we need to do is sharpen a copy of the image with the layer’s blending 
mode set to Luminosity. 
Figure 4-32 shows the steps to duplicate the Background layer and adjust 
the blending mode as well as renaming the layer—in this case, to the 
amount we’ll end up sharpening the image. How do we know the amount? 
Well, we’ve done this a time or two.
Using the Edge Mask Channel
Once the new layer is set to Luminosity, the next step is to load the Edge 
Mask channel as an active selection. You can do so by choosing Select > Load 
Selection and picking the Edge Mask channel. (You can also Command-
click (Mac) or Control-click (Windows) the channel.) After the selection is 
active, the Edge Mask selection is turned into a layer mask. The ﬁ nal step is 
to run the Unsharp Mask ﬁ lter to apply the edge sharpening. Figure 4-33 
shows this process.

158
Creating an edge mask can take at least ten separate steps with a lot of 
potential for additional ﬁ ne-tuning steps. Performing these steps manually 
for each and every image you want to sharpen would be needlessly compli-
cated and inefﬁ cient. The ideal is to automate them. We’ll cover how to 
record these steps as actions in the last chapter, but let’s jump ahead slightly 
and show the result of Camera Raw’s ability to create an edge mask on the 
ﬂ y. Figure 4-34 shows the Photoshop ten-step edge mask and compares it to 
Camera Raw’s parametric edge mask.
Figure 4-34 Comparing Photoshop and Camera Raw edge masks
You’ll note minor variations between the Photoshop and Camera Raw edge 
masks. In actuality, the Camera Raw edge mask is merely a preview and not 
the actual mask. The preview also sometimes appears a bit higher-contrast than 
how the edge mask is actually being applied in Camera Raw. Nevertheless, 
it’s pretty remarkable that a single slider in Camera Raw can take the place 
of so many steps in Photoshop. Makes one wonder why Photoshop doesn’t 
have its own edge mask tool!
The edge mask is a fundamental tool for image sharpening but its alter ego, 
the surface mask, is critical for the next series of tools in Photoshop: the 
noise-reduction tools.

NOISE REDUCTION IN PHOTOSHOP
159
NOISE REDUCTION IN PHOTOSHOP
As we learned in Chapter 2, “Why Do We Sharpen?”, noise or ﬁ lm grain is 
a fact of life for photographers. If you use a higher ISO or underexpose your 
image, the reduction of photons collected by the sensor or ﬁ lm results in 
more obvious perceptible noise. Shooting with a higher ISO often requires 
noise-reduction strategies in order to optimize an image for reproduction. 
Sometimes simply downsampling the image will be a sufﬁ cient noise-reduc-
tion tool. Other times you’ll need to deploy more aggressive reduction tools. 
One thing to keep in mind, however, is that these are noise-reduction tools, 
not noise elimination tools. A certain degree of noise is expected or even 
desirable. If you totally eliminate noise or ﬁ lm grain, not only will the 
image look synthetic, but it will also have lost a large amount of actual 
image detail. That is the ultimate challenge of noise reduction: reducing the 
noise while preserving real image detail.
Just as it’s easy to overdo sharpening, it’s also easy to overdo noise and grain 
removal, leading to two undesirable conditions:
• 
Overly aggressive noise removal produces soft, unnatural-looking 
images that scream “digital” and, in extreme cases, appear to have been 
run through the Median ﬁ lter.
• 
Many noise-reduction tools, including Photoshop’s Reduce Noise ﬁ lter, 
have a tendency to produce images that aren’t as easily sharpened, 
because as soon as you apply sharpening, artifacts from the noise 
removal pop into view.
In many cases, the best way to handle noise is to simply protect it from 
being sharpened. But in extreme cases—for example, high-ISO or heavily 
underexposed digital captures, or scans from high-speed ﬁ lm, especially 
color negative—you may have to reduce the noise before you start 
sharpening.
 
TIP: It’s worth noting that the market for third-party noise-reduction plug-ins is one 
of the most competitive segments of the greater Photoshop plug-in market. If you 
routinely have to work with very noisy images, we suggest you consider one of the many 
third-party solutions available, because almost all of them do a better job than can be 
achieved with Photoshop’s tools. 

CHAPTER 4: SHARPENING TOOLS
160
The Reduce Noise Filter
Photoshop’s Reduce Noise ﬁ lter can do a creditable job, though as noted 
previously, frankly it’s not as good as most third-party plug-ins. The danger 
with Reduce Noise is that you wind up creating an image that can’t be 
sharpened. Figure 4-35 shows an example.

The Reduce Noise version 
appears to eliminate most

the noise back but also intro-
duces ugly artifacts, which is as 
bad as (if not worse than) the 
original noise!

NOISE REDUCTION IN PHOTOSHOP

Reduce Noise Advanced Options
As with Smart Sharpen, clicking the Advanced button changes the interface 
and brings up a Per Channel option to apply differing amounts of noise 
reduction based on the channel. This is useful for ﬁ lm scans, as the Blue 
channel is often noisier than the other channels. As with Smart Sharpen, 
however, the settings you apply when in the Advanced mode continue to be 
in play when you select the Basic button. For this reason, we suggest always 
using the Advanced mode. Figure 4-36 shows the Advanced options.

CHAPTER 4: SHARPENING TOOLS
162
When selecting the Advanced options, the Per Channel settings override the 
Overall settings for Strength and Preserve Details. The only Overall set-
tings that will be applied will be the Reduce Color Noise, Sharpen Details, 
and the option to Remove JPEG Artifact. If you process raw ﬁ les from 
Camera Raw or Lightroom, the optimal place for doing color noise reduc-
tion would be in that processing pipeline. Reapplying color noise reduction 
in Reduce Noise is not suggested, as it will potentially blur the color data 
and leads to color bleeding across color boundaries.

Like Smart Sharpen, Reduce Noise allows you to save commonly used set-
tings as a preset to be applied more efﬁ ciently. Figure 4-37 shows the Save 
and Trash icons in the Reduce Noise dialog box, as well as the New Filter 
Settings dialog box and the Settings drop-down menu. To save settings, 
click the Save New Filter button and name the saved setting, which will 
then appear in the drop-down menu.
Strength vs. Preserve Details
As with all noise-reduction tools, the primary challenge is to reduce the 
noise while preserving the edge detail in the image. We strongly suggest 
applying Reduce Noise on only a copy of a pixel layer so that you can adjust 
the opacity and create your own surface mask to more accurately attack the 
noise and preserve details. The technique for creating the layer and mask is 
essentially the same as that for a sharpening layer with an edge mask, only 
the edge mask for noise reduction isn’t inverted, so the edges show as black 
and hence are protected from the noise reduction.

The Surface Blur Filter
Tucked into the Blur ﬁ lter group is a little known and rather underused blur 
ﬁ lter that’s useful for reducing noise. The ﬁ lter has a Radius setting and a 
levels threshold. Combined, the settings allow the blur to be applied on the 
non-edge areas of an image—hence the name Surface Blur. It should be 
noted that this is a rather un-subtle tool. It’s very strong; used too strongly, 
it can quickly turn your photographic image into an impressionistic mess. 
However, used with a degree of ﬁ nesse and with the addition of a surface 
mask, Surface Blur can reduce some of the most stubborn noise, particu-
larly noise that is ampliﬁ ed by strong boosts in post-processing exposure 
adjustments. 
Figure 4-38 shows the Surface Blur dialog box as well as the surface mask 
we’ve created for use with Surface Blur and Despeckle.
The key to using Surface Blur successfully is to localize the application both 
by using a surface mask as well as using reduced opacity. We’ve often found 
that applying Surface Blur and applying the result at 50% opacity allows a 
reduction in the perception of strong noise. The noise is still there because 
the opacity is reduced. But the gentle use lessens the strength of the natu-
rally present noise.

Noise Reduction with Despeckle
The Despeckle ﬁ lter is useful for dealing with mild-to-moderate luminance 
noise (as opposed to color noise). The secret is to apply Despeckle differen-
tially to the three color channels—the red channel usually has the least 
noise, and the blue channel usually has the most.
Figure 4-39, below, shows the result of this technique, which is a simple 
ﬁ lter menu command (Filter > Noise > Despeckle), in action along with 
additional noise-reduction tools. When overdone, this technique can pro-
duce color shifts, but it provides an easy way of knocking back some of the 
worst of the noise. As with all sharpening and noise-reduction tools, it’s best 
applied to a copy of the image.
Comparing Noise Reduction Tools
In Photoshop, there’s often not a single “perfect tool” you can call on to solve 
your imaging needs, and this is certainly true with noise reduction. Many 
times you’ll need to combine multiple tools to achieve optimal results. In this 
section we’ll compare the preceding noise-reduction tools as well as a couple 
extras: a third-party tool (Noiseware™ from www.imagenomic.com) and 
Photoshop’s own Camera Raw. There will be two sets of comparison images, 
one set for pixel-peeping at a screen zoom of 400% and a contact-sized print 
set to 300 ppi and sharpened for output. The original, an ISO 1600 digital 
capture from a Digital Rebel XT, is a 6 MP capture and would reproduce at 
11” x 7” at 300 ppi.
Comparing at 400% Zoom
Figure 4-39 shows an array of six images of a small portion of the original 
capture. At 400%, the image on screen would be effectively 12 times the 
actual size (at 100% of a 100-ppi display, the image would be three times the 
original, so at 400% it would be an additional four times bigger). So while 
what we are seeing is accurate, it is not at all representational of ﬁ nal output 
reality. In fact, viewing these images in the book is even further removed 
from reality, because the results have been put though the halftone screen-
ing process to produce 150-lpi halftone dot.

CHAPTER 4: SHARPENING TOOLS
166
There are some interesting conclusions to be drawn from this comparison. 
First, looking at the noise results of image processing at a 400% zoom isn’t 
particularly enlightening. Yes, you can see what the pixels look like, but you 
can’t really see what they mean in terms of signal-to-noise. Camera Raw, 
which is often criticized for inferior noise reduction, fares pretty well com-
pared to Reduce Noise. Surface Blur with a surface mask does a good job 
(better than Despeckle) of substantially minimizing noise without too much 
obliteration of image detail. The third-party plug-in at default appears best, 
which isn’t surprising—as with all things in life, you tend to get what you 
pay for.
Comparing at Contact-Print Size
In the grand scheme of things, what really matters about noise reduction is 
what do the results look like in the real world? Going back to the concept of 
a contact print, introduced in Chapter 2, the following images are crops 
of the full frame at 300 ppi, then output sharpened for this book’s 150-lpi 
halftone screen. Let’s see if these contact prints conﬁ rm or conﬂ ict with 
your impression of the noise-reduction tools’ results when viewed at the 
previous 400% zoom. 
Figure 4-40 shows the contact-print size of each of the noise-reduction 
examples.
If you’re not quite sure what to think about this comparison, let us take this 
opportunity to tell you what we think. We think that by the time the image 
has been processed, cropped, and output sharpened for reproduction, the 
differences between these results are very subtle indeed. We would argue 
that, in many respects, the image processed in Camera Raw has perhaps the 
best combination of noise reduction without artiﬁ cial, detail-losing smooth-
ing. It looks more photographic.
We also think that Reduce Noise is a ﬁ ne and dandy tool if used well, but if 
you have a few extra shekels, investing in a third-party noise-reduction tool 
is well worth the money. While we use Noiseware, that’s not to say that any 
of the others are not equally useful when compared to Photoshop’s toolset.

Third-Party Solutions
In extreme noise situations, many third-party plug-ins do a better job than 
can be achieved using Photoshop’s tools. ABSoft’s Neat Image, Visual 
Inﬁ nity’s Grain Surgery, PictureCode’s Noise Ninja, and Imagenomic’s 
Noiseware Professional all provide industrial-strength noise reduction with 
a great deal of control over the process. (If we’ve failed to mention your per-
sonal favorite, it’s simply because the aforementioned plug-ins are the ones 
with which we’re most familiar.)
Here are a few general guidelines for using third-party noise-reduction 
solutions:
• 
Always do noise reduction before sharpening unless the sharpening and 
noise reduction are integrated in the same processing pipeline. If you 
sharpen ﬁ rst separately, you’ll almost certainly make the noise worse. 
The noise-reduction tool will have to work harder, and will probably 
wipe out the sharpening you did anyway.
• 
If you perform noise reduction on a layer, you can reduce the noise 
slightly more than you actually want, then ﬁ ne-tune the noise reduction 
by tweaking the layer opacity.
• 
Don’t overdo the noise reduction. A certain amount of noise is usually 
preferable to an image that looks like it’s been blurred.
In practice, we ﬁ nd we need to resort to third-party tools only with high-
ISO (1600 or greater) or severely underexposed (more than 1 f-stop) digital 
captures, or with scans from color negative. In virtually all other situations, 
the techniques presented here work well.
Ironically, it was during the preparation of these images for the book that a 
key aspect of noise reduction and image sharpening sort of fell into place—
the ideal place to accomplish the noise reduction is in conjunction with 
and in the same process as the capture sharpening. This isn’t such an earth-
shattering revelation, since Bruce had advocated something similar in the 
ﬁ rst edition of this book. But the principal has been driven even further 
home now: If at all possible, do your capture sharpening and at least the 
primary noise reduction in your raw processor, particularly if that raw 
processor happens to be Camera Raw or Lightroom.

SHARPENING AND NOISE REDUCTION IN CAMERA RAW AND LIGHTROOM

SHARPENING AND NOISE REDUCTION
IN CAMERA RAW AND LIGHTROOM
In the preceding pages, we’ve covered the numerous Photoshop tools for 
the sharpening and noise reduction of digital images. However, for digital 
capture (and even TIFFs from ﬁ lm scanners), processing images in the 
Camera Raw/Lightroom processing pipeline offers many advantages, 
including the following:
• 
The image adjustment settings in Camera Raw and Lightroom are 
parametric adjustments that can be revisited and changed right up to 
the point when the ﬁ nal output ﬁ le is rendered. Much has been made 
of “nondestructive” workﬂ ows (which we think is marketing hype), but 
it is relevant to the extent that your original will always stay original 
with parametric editing until you decide to process—if you even need 
to process. In the case of Lightroom, some images may never need to 
be rendered because the imaging controls and output are sufﬁ cient to 
handle a photographer’s needs. 
• 
Whether you are sharpening a single image or hundreds or thousands 
of images, applying the settings can be as simple as applying a preset or 
copying and pasting the settings in Camera Raw (via Bridge) or syncing 
Lightroom. If you want to apply sharpening and noise reduction in 
Photoshop, those ﬁ les must be opened in Photoshop for processing and 
then saved. While batch operations can certainly automate the process, 
the Photoshop-based process is still far more time consuming.
• 
A strong argument can be made that the optimal time to do image 
sharpening and noise reduction would be combined with the rest of the 
raw image processing and demosaicing. As we’ve shown, it’s important 
to do the noise reduction either before sharpening or at least during the 
raw processing. Doing the sharpening and noise reduction directly 
inside of Camera Raw or Lightroom offers the ability to leverage both 
the sharpening and noise-reduction tools for optimal image quality.
We would not be honest and forthright if we didn’t state right here that both 
Bruce and Jeff have a vested interest in advocating and evangelizing image 
sharpening in Camera Raw and Lightroom, since both of us were directly 
involved in certain aspects of the products’ sharpening development. We 
also coauthored another book dedicated to Camera Raw, Real World Camera

Raw in Adobe Photoshop CS4. So, it’s only natural to have a certain degree of 
paternalistic pride in the results of our efforts. However, don’t confuse that 
pride with blind faith and love. We are perfectly capable of getting into the 
correct peoples’ faces in an effort to make sure Camera Raw and Lightroom 
do the best image processing possible. We are also completely gratiﬁ ed that 
those same faces on the Camera Raw and Lightroom teams are strongly 
self-motivated towards those same goals. So, with this caveat stated, let’s get 
down to the business of learning how to use Camera Raw and Lightroom 
for sharpening and noise reduction.
Comparing Camera Raw and Lightroom’s 
Environments
Both Camera Raw and Lightroom employ the same processing pipeline, 
assuming an equivalent version of each application. At the time of this writing, 
the current shipping versions were Camera Raw 5.4 and Lightroom 2.4. The 
matching .x number guarantees that the underlying processing engines are 
capable of exactly the same image processing and rendering. So whether 
Camera Raw 5.4 or Lightroom 2.4 processes an image, with all other factors 
such as color space and image size being equal, both applications produce 
the same results. 
However, usability and the user interfaces vary, sometimes considerably. 
Figure 4-41 shows both Camera Raw 5.4 and the Develop module of 
Lightroom 2.4.
The sliders are named the same, although Lightroom combines the 
Chromatic Aberration and Defringe controls in the Detail panel; in Camera 
Raw, those controls are in the Lens Corrections panel. In Lightroom, you 
have a 1:1 (or 2:1 if you change it) live preview and the ability to use the 
Targeted Adjustment tool to change where the preview is from; in Camera 
Raw, you just see a message that says “Zoom preview to 100% or larger to 
see the effects of the controls in this panel.”
Why? For several reasons. First and foremost, as we’ve already said repeat-
edly, the only zoom where one image pixel equals one display pixel is 100% 
(or 1:1 in Lightroom). The moment a screen zoom is anything lower than 
100%, substantial inaccuracies occur because of screen dithering. Second, 
it’s a lot faster to not have to even try to render the sharpening and noise 
reduction at smaller screen zooms, thus Camera Raw and Lightroom will 
render the rest of the image adjustment settings more quickly.

CHAPTER 4: SHARPENING TOOLS
172
The real reason, though, is that Thomas Knoll doesn’t think it’s a good idea 
to render previews of sharpening and noise reduction at anything other than 
100% zoom or above. We are being a bit facetious when we say that—but only 
a bit. If Mr. Knoll doesn’t think something is the right thing to do, he sim-
ply doesn’t do it. It takes a pretty compelling argument to change his mind.
The Camera Raw and Lightroom 
Sharpening Philosophy 
Some people complain that the sharpening tools in Camera Raw and 
Lightroom aren’t good enough or strong enough, and that other tools are 
needed. We agree with using additional tools, but we disagree that the 
Camera Raw/Lightroom tools aren’t good enough. Many people fail to fully 
understand the applications’ sharpening philosophy.
The image sharpening tools in Camera Raw and Lightroom are designed 
for capture sharpening only, not sharpening for effect. The intent is to use 
the tool to adjust an image to be “good at 100%.” This means no under-
sharpening in expectation of additional sharpening down the road. It also 
means no oversharpening to try to compensate for ﬁ nal output. In order to 
fully understand the philosophy, you must fully understand the sharpening 
workﬂ ow that Camera Raw and Lightroom were designed around: capture, 
creative, and output sharpening. 
At this point, Lightroom 2.x has fully formed capture and output sharpen-
ing components. Camera Raw has the same fully formed capture sharpening 
component but only a simple and limited output sharpening implementation 
(which we are sure will be improved). Neither application has a fully formed 
creative sharpening component as of yet, which is why we still need Photoshop 
for creative sharpening and sharpening for effect. 
Analyzing Camera Raw and Lightroom’s 
Sharpening Tool
We’re going to return to the original sharpener analysis target that was 
explained back in Figure 4-1. Instead of opening the target in Photoshop, 
we’ll be opening the TIFF ﬁ le inside Camera Raw and Lightroom to show 
you what the controls do relative to Photoshop’s sharpening tools.

Evaluating Radius
Figure 4-42 shows the original target and four additional targets whose 
Radius settings have been adjusted. The sharpening Amounts for each of 
these four adjusted examples are pegged at the maximum of 150 to better 
show off the somewhat subtle nature of Camera Raw and Lightroom’s 
sharpening. We say subtle because they’re designed for capture sharpening, 
not sharpening for effect.
As mentioned earlier, like the radius control of the Unsharp Mask ﬁ lter in 
Photoshop, Radius is the control that sets the width of the sharpening 
haloes. The Radius setting tells the ﬁ lter how many surrounding pixels to 
take into account when calculating the new value for the subject pixel.

Figure 4-42

CHAPTER 4: SHARPENING TOOLS
174
However, the Radius settings in Camera Raw and Lightroom do not operate 
exactly the same as the Radius settings in either the Unsharp Mask or 
Smart Sharpen ﬁ lters. Since the processing space for all sharpening in 
Camera Raw is linear luminance data, the Radius setting in Camera Raw is 
slightly different than Photoshop’s ﬁ lters. A Radius of 0.5 in Camera Raw 
5.4 is about the same as 0.3 in Unsharp Mask.
That said, the net effect of Camera Raw/Lightroom’s Radius settings is the 
same as Unsharp Mask or Smart Sharpen; low Radius settings produce nar-
row sharpening haloes and higher settings produce wider ones. For high-
frequency images, you’ll want to use a Radius setting below 1.0, and for 
low-frequency images, a setting above 1.0. How much below or above the 
default setting of 1.0 you go depends on the image (which means it’s your 
responsibility to determine the optimal setting). 
Evaluating Detail
Perhaps the most confusing of all of the image sharpening settings, regard-
less of the tool, is the Detail slider in Camera Raw and Lightroom. It’s difﬁ -
cult to understand because Detail actually controls multiple parameters with 
a single slider. While the default setting is 25, the actual middle of the slider 
effect is 50. When moved lower than 50, Detail kicks in a halo suppression 
component that will help reduce the strength of the haloes the sharpening 
produces. Moving the slider to the right turns off halo suppression and con-
centrates the sharpening amount towards the higher frequencies of the image. 
The Detail setting is highly dependent on the Radius settings. The lower 
the Radius, the more the increase of Detail’s concentration on the high-
frequency texture.
Setting Detail to the maximum of 100 will make the Amount and Radius 
settings behave in a similar manner to Unsharp Mask in Photoshop. 
However, there is nothing in Unsharp Mask that can replicate the effect of 
reducing the Detail setting when halo suppression kicks in. Figure 4-43 
shows the impact of going from a Detail setting of 0 to 100.
One of the things that should jump out at you is what the higher Detail set-
tings are doing to the actual texture of the gradations in the target. At a setting 
of 50 or above, the sharpening algorithm is actually accentuating the noise 
Photoshop puts into its Gradient tool. Yes, it’s sharpening the noise! At the 
lower Detail settings, the noise is not being over accentuated—in fact, with 
a Detail setting of 0, there’s very little effect of sharpening taking place.

SHARPENING AND NOISE REDUCTION IN CAMERA RAW AND LIGHTROOM
175
Detail Settings and Noise
As you can see in Figure 4-43, if you have noise in your images, increasing 
the Detail slider can substantially increase the perception of the noise. Some 
might say the higher Detail settings could be called noise enhancers, and 
they would be correct. However, what is not quite so obvious, largely because 
the Camera Raw engineers wanted separate categories for sharpening and 
noise reduction, is that adjusting the Luminance noise-reduction slider has 
an impact on the strength of the Detail slider’s impact. By adding noise 
reduction, you can mitigate the increase in the Detail slider’s negative impact. 
Figure 4-44 shows what happens when you add noise reduction to higher 
Detail settings.

Figure 4-43

CHAPTER 4: SHARPENING TOOLS
176
As you can see, adding noise reduction has the impact of somewhat undoing 
the increase of the Detail settings’ impact on high-frequency enhancement. 
However, while the noise reduction can help cancel out the increase in 
Detail’s high-frequency enhancement, don’t forget that the Detail slider 
doesn’t just do one thing—the other impact the slider has is to suppress 
haloes. So, you can increase Detail’s numbers to reduce the halo suppression 
and increase the Luminance noise reduction to cut down on the high Detail 
setting’s negative impact on noise.
In effect, the Luminance slider is the ﬁ fth sharpening slider. To optimally 
tune sharpening requires that you also adjust Luminance noise reduction. 
If you fail to adjust both interactively, you are leaving image quality, in the 
form of optimal sharpening, on the table.
Masking
As we saw in the “Edge and Surface Masks” section, creating a mask based 
upon the edges within an image can be a laborious series of steps in 
Photoshop. In Camera Raw and Lightroom, the process has been distilled 
down to moving a single slider. Figure 4-45 shows previews of the edge 
mask being created on the ﬂ y. To see the preview, the Option (on a Mac; 
Alt in Windows) key was held while adjusting the Masking slider.
We didn’t bother showing a target with Masking set to 0, as of course it 
would be a white frame. In Figure 4-44, where the target is showing white, 
the sharpening effect will be applied at the full strength of the settings con-
tained in Amount, Radius, and Detail. Note that Masking has no impact on 
Luminance noise reduction. As you increase the Masking setting, more of 
the image will be protected from the sharpening effect, up to the maximum

of 100, where the edges are about the only things still showing. However, 
it should be noted that even if the mask preview is 100 black, Camera Raw 
and Lightroom will still apply a slight degree of sharpening. We have been 
told this is a bug, not a feature, and will probably be modiﬁ ed in the future.
Using Camera Raw or Lightroom for 
Image Sharpening
It’s all well and good to look at a bunch of targets, but to fully understand 
how to use the tools, you have to use the tools on real images. We’re going 
to show the process of sharpening an image by using the Option/Alt special 
sharpening preview. You should note that the preview will show only when 
the zoom is 100% (1:1) or larger. You also need to hold down the Option 
(Mac) or Alt (Windows) key while adjusting a parameter for the preview 
to appear.

CHAPTER 4: SHARPENING TOOLS
178
While the parameters are arranged top to bottom, we generally don’t adjust 
Amount ﬁ rst; we usually adjust Radius based on the overall needs of the 
image’s edges. Once the Radius is set, we then start adjusting the Amount. 
Since we’re going to follow the individual controls, we are going to go in 
order, top to bottom, in this example. 
It should also be noted that once set, any of the parameters are likely to be 
adjusted or tweaked, perhaps even multiple times. It is not at all unusual to 
work back and forth between Radius and Detail and to readjust the Amount, 
or to adjust Luminance noise reduction and then readjust Detail. Often we’ll 
test the validity of some of our settings by adjusting the Amount ridiculously 
high (over 100) for the purpose of seeing what’s happening to the pixels. 
Be sure to reduce it back to reasonable levels before ﬁ nishing.
Let’s quickly walk through each of the sharpening controls.
Adjusting Amount
Amount is the strength setting that takes all the other settings and applies 
a volume control. The default is 25, and that was selected as somewhat 
representative of the old Camera Raw 3.x single slider sharpening control. 
Figure 4-46 shows the luminance sharpening preview and the Amount 
setting adjusted to 65. The additional settings are still at default.
Virtually every image will need to be adjusted upwards in the Amount 
setting. The default of 25 is a legacy holdover. Depending on your image 
source, the setting may need to go up only a bit. But if you are shooting 
with a camera that has a strong antialiasing ﬁ lter (such as Canon digital 
cameras), the Amount may need to go way up. Figure 4-47 shows the lower 
and upper ranges of the Amount setting.
 
TIP: If you fi nd yourself constantly adjusting any Camera Raw or Lightroom parame-
ter each and every time you use it, you really should consider changing the Camera 
Raw/Lightroom default for your camera. This applies not only to sharpening but any of the 
parameters. You should also note that Camera Raw and Lightroom both share the same 
defaults. So if you change the default in Camera Raw, Lightroom will pick up that new 
default and use it for the camera. You can also make the default specifi c to camera serial 
numbers as well as ISO settings, so you can have a camera-specifi c default that will be 
dependent upon the shot ISO.

Some people may wonder why the Amount goes up to 150 instead of top-
ping off at 100. During the development of the new sharpening routines, we 
found images whose settings for Radius, Detail, and Masking were simply 
too weak at 100. So the decision was made to allow the parameter to be set 
to 150. There was a precedent with Camera Raw’s Brightness setting, which

used to be limited to 100 but was later increased to 150. We will say, however, 
that unless you really ﬁ ne-tune the Detail slider very low and have a very 
high Masking setting, the odds of needing to go above 100 isn’t very high.
Adjusting Radius
Probably the single most important parameter to adjust in the Camera Raw/
Lightroom sharpening scheme is the Radius setting. Not only does the 
Radius sharpening amount depend on it, but both Detail and Masking 
depend on it as well. How the Detail slider “tweens” between halo suppres-
sion and high-frequency enhancement depends on the Radius setting. Mask 
creation also depends on the Radius setting, because increasing the Radius 
parameter makes the mask edges wider. Figure 4-48 shows our image being 
previewed, and the Camera Raw and Lightroom Detail panels.
When your image has a preponderance of high-frequency textual detail, 
you really must lower the Radius setting down from the default of 1. All 
of the other adjustments you make to the image are so dependent on the 
proper Radius setting that failing to nail this setting is the root cause of 
Figure 4-48

most people’s problems with Camera Raw/Lightroom sharpening. Figure 
4-49 shows the lower and upper limits of the Radius setting on this image.
If one were to err, it could be argued it’s better to err on the side of a smaller 
Radius setting as opposed to a larger setting. We’ve rarely ever found a use 
for a setting above 2, and the more useful low-frequency setting tends to 
be 1.5. Putting the Radius setting too high can have a negative impact on 
Detail and Masking, which also interact with whatever the currently set 
Radius parameter is set to.
Adjusting Detail
If you want a short and concise deﬁ nition of Detail, try this: Detail is a 
multifrequency halo suppression adjustment for the Amount and Radius 
parameters. Does that help? We thought not…but don’t feel bad. Even the 
engineer who wrote the code for Detail can’t really explain precisely what 
it does. The bottom line is, season to taste and be sure you factor in the 
Luminance noise reduction as an additional modiﬁ er to the Detail setting. 
Figure 4-50 shows the adjusted Detail setting and the preview.
For this image, adjusting the Detail setting upwards to 60 helps bring out the 
super high-frequency detail in the stone and the carvings. The halo suppres-
sion at 60 is almost off. We don’t know the exact point where the suppression 
quits entirely, but we can’t see much if any evidence of suppression above 
75. At one point in the development of these new sharpening parameters, 
the default Detail setting was 50. However, it was thought to be too aggres-
sive when comparing the legacy sharpening settings, so the default was

reduced to 25. We don’t disagree with that decision, however we point this 
out to suggest that for many users, changing their defaults might be a fruit-
ful endeavor (read: Change your default to 50). Figure 4-51 shows the lower 
and upper range of the Detail setting.

Adjusting Masking
At this point, the main sharpening settings have been applied. We still need 
to adjust the Masking setting and do a tiny tweak to the Luminance noise 
reduction. By default there is no Masking setting being applied. It is set to 0 
for several reasons. First, since creating the edge mask is processor intensive, 
the thought was that to force a user to take the processing hit on a mask 
generation wasn’t efﬁ cient. But the primary reason is that since the mask is 
so image dependent, it’s pretty difﬁ cult if not impossible to have a one-size-
ﬁ ts-all mask. You need to see the impact that the mask has on the image to 
determine what setting to use. 
Make no mistake about using the Masking in Camera Raw and Lightroom. 
For optimal image sharpening, you must use some masking for virtually 
every image you process. The only question is how much? 
Figure 4-52 shows adjusting the Masking parameter as well as a slight tweak 
to the Luminance noise reduction.

CHAPTER 4: SHARPENING TOOLS
184
The Masking for this image didn’t need to be too high. The primary goal 
was to keep the sharpening from hitting the sky and any other large surface 
areas. Generally a minimum setting of between 10 and 25 is enough to keep 
too much of the sharpening effect from falling onto the surfaces and concen-
trating the sharpening to the edges. Remember, as of Camera Raw 5.4 and 
Lightroom 2.4, some sharpening will always be applied to the entire image. 
It’s important to make the determination where to back it off and where to 
concentrate the effect. Also remember that the proper Radius setting is impor-
tant too. Figure 4-53 shows lower and higher Masking previews for this image.
Normally, the process of arriving at the optimal settings for a given image 
would involve adjustment and then readjustment of all of the sharpening 
parameters and the Luminance noise reduction. To achieve the optimal 
results, there really is no alternative to using your eyes (and mind) to judge 
the impact of the sharpening parameters on your image. Granted, that’s a 
pretty user-intensive process. However, once you master the Camera Raw/
Lightroom sharpening toolset, it’s not hard to put most images into one of a 
relatively few categories and, as a result, be able to apply relatively accurate 
presets to large numbers of images very quickly in Bridge or Lightroom. 
We’ll cover the use of presets in the next chapter.
Comparing Default and Optimized Sharpening Parameters
While looking at the images zoomed in is useful for arriving at the optimal 
sharpening settings, the true test of optimization accuracy is to process the 
image out and combine it with output sharpening and then output the

For those people who have not yet mastered the intricacies of using Camera 
Raw or Lightroom’s sharpening tool, we hope this has been helpful. For 
those who had previously thought that the sharpening was inferior, we hope 
that learning how to use the tool will change your opinion. Now, the next 
step is to try to convince you that noise reduction in Camera Raw/
Lightroom isn’t half bad either.
Using Camera Raw or Lightroom for Noise 
Reduction
Some people have given Camera Raw and Lightroom a bad rap for produc-
ing mushy, soft, and impressionistic rendering of camera noise. For some 
cameras whose noise signature is particularly poor, or for those people who 
are driving the real ISO into unrealistically high numbers, or for people 
who seem predisposed to ETTL (considerable underexposure), we suppose 
the Noise Reduction portion of the Detail panel leaves something to be 
desired. Rest assured, everyone: The elves that work on the Camera Raw 
processing pipeline are actively engaged in substantially increasing the 
image quality that comes out of the pipeline. But even as it stands, for most 
cameras at most ISO settings, properly used in conjunction with appropriate 
image sharpening settings, Camera Raw and Lightroom are capable of pro-
ducing very good image quality. Of course, to achieve this, one must be 
ﬂ uent with the use of the controls, so let’s look at them now.
The Noise Reduction Controls
Really, the important control one needs to learn how to ﬁ nesse is the 
Luminance slider in the Noise Reduction portion of the Detail panel. As 
with the Sharpening controls, the only way to see what’s going on is to zoom 
in to 100% (1:1) or closer to see the actual impact on the pixels. We often 
ﬁ nd it useful to zoom in to 200% (2:1) to get a better feel of what the image 
noise signature looks like and to gauge how much noise reduction to apply. 

SHARPENING AND NOISE REDUCTION IN CAMERA RAW AND LIGHTROOM
187
Figure 4-55 shows a digital capture done with a Canon EOS 10D (the same 
poor camera we beat up in Chapter 2, we’re afraid), downsampled and 
reproduced full frame here in the book. The image was optimized for 
sharpening and noise reduction in Camera Raw, downsampled, and output 
sharpened for the book. The native size of the capture would have been 
10.25” x 6.875” at 300 ppi.
The capture was shot at 1600 ISO and a -1.35 Exposure setting was needed 
to reduce the bright windows, but a Brightness setting of +130 was needed 
to lighten up the resulting tone curve. As a result, the shadows did get an 
increase in processing with an attendant increase in perceived noise.
At this reproduction size, the image in Figure 4-55 looks relatively noiseless. 
Part of that was due to downsampling, which has the effect of substantially 
reducing noise all by itself. The other part was the noise reduction applied 
in Camera Raw.
Figure 4-56 shows the same image with a screen zoom of 300% (3:1). At 
this zoom, the noise is large and ugly. Something needs to be done about it, 
right? Let’s see what can be done.

• 
Adjusting the Luminance noise reduction: To successfully make accurate 
adjustments to the Luminance noise reduction, one must make all of 
the other sharpening adjustments as well. Remember that there is an 
interrelationship between the Detail slider and the Luminance noise-
reduction slider. Figure 4-57 shows the ﬁ nal Detail panel settings for 
both Sharpening and Noise Reduction.
When you compare the images from Figures 4-56 and 4-57, the reduction 
in the apparent noise is considerable. But because the image sharpening 
is optimized, the overall image appearance is not particularly soft. Has 
the noise been completely eliminated? No. To completely obliterate it 
would also mean a loss of image detail as well as the noise elimination. 
But Camera Raw has done a useful amount of noise reduction to the 
point that, for many purposes, no further noise reduction would need 
to be done.
• 
Adjusting the Color noise reduction: This discussion is really short 
because in general, Camera Raw and Lightroom do a wonderful job of 
color noise reduction, so for the most part you can ignore this setting. 
We’ve tried to ﬁ nd a visually good sample of an image that needed less
than the default. Alas, we’ve failed. On occasion we have found images 
that needed more. The only caution we make when increasing the 
Color noise reduction is to be sure you are actually seeing color noise 
(learn how to recognize it) and that you use only the amount needed to

eliminate it. Unlike Luminance noise reduction, there is no reason not 
to eliminate noise as long as the settings you use don’t also blur the 
color boundaries of objects.
COMBINING CAMERA RAW,
LIGHTROOM, AND PHOTOSHOP’S TOOLS
We’re going to keep this section short because this is the very tip of a 
very big and important subject we’ll be covering in depth in Chapter 5, 
“Industrial-Strength Sharpening Techniques.” But we thought it would 
be useful to show, on the same example image we’ve been working, how 
to combine the best of all the applications’ toolsets.
Figure 4-58 shows three contact-print-sized images. Each image was pro-
cessed, then output sharpened for book reproduction. The ﬁ rst one was 
output at the camera default sharpening of Amount 25 and zero noise 
reduction. The next is the image where we optimized both the Sharpening 
and Noise Reduction parameters. The last image was then opened in 
Photoshop for a gentle dose of the Reduce Noise ﬁ lter and added using a 
surface mask to preserve the edges.

We think you’ll agree that each step we took was an upgrade to the overall 
image quality. Leaving the image at default gives a grainy, noisy result 
whose details aren’t as sharp as the noise. Optimizing the sharpening and 
the noise reduction is a clear improvement in image quality—the image 
details are sharper than the noise. Yes, it looks like a higher ISO shot, but 
the noise is not as objectionable as the ﬁ rst example. The last image is the 
overall best image quality. There are still some telltale signs of the image 
having come from a higher-ISO capture, but those signs are very subtle. 
Figure 4-59 shows the layer stack as well as the surface mask that was gener-
ated for the ﬁ nal image.
It should be clear after reading this chapter that knowing how a particular 
sharpening or smoothing tool works is only part of the answer. Learning to 
work with various tools and creating layers and masks provides you with 
much more control and ﬂ exibility than when you simply use the tools to 
burn changes into the pixels of a ﬂ attened image.

But as we all know, there’s no such thing as a free lunch, and the downsides 
of doing everything on layers are that the ﬁ les become very large, and also 
very complex. If you plan to leave the layers intact for maximum ﬂ exibility, 
name them in a way that you know will make sense to you several years hence. 
Otherwise you’ll ﬁ nd yourself spending considerable amounts of time just 
ﬁ guring out what each layer does when you come to revisit the image.
In the next chapter, we’ll show you how to assemble the various tools 
covered in this chapter into a complete arsenal of advanced techniques 
dedicated to getting the best image quality available while automating the 
work wherever possible.

Industrial-Strength 
Sharpening Techniques
Using the Tools
Knowing your way around Adobe Photoshop CS4, Adobe Photoshop Camera 
Raw, and Adobe Photoshop Lightroom’s sharpening tools is a good start, but 
learning how to actually deploy them is the key to mastering sharpening, 
especially if you plan to use the workﬂ ow-based approach to sharpening 
that we outlined in Chapter 3, “Sharpening Strategies.” Multipass sharpen-
ing must be approached with care and diligence, lest you end up with an 
oversharpened mess.
This chapter will break down the techniques based on the sharpening 
phases of capture sharpening, creative sharpening, and output sharpening. 
We’ll describe techniques for controlling sharpening not only while it’s 
being applied, but also after it’s been applied. We’ll show you how to 
sharpen nondestructively, so that if things go horribly wrong you still have 
an escape route. We’ll also explain how to conﬁ ne sharpening to speciﬁ c 
tonal ranges and image areas, so that you can sharpen edges without affect-
ing textured areas or sharpening noise.

LAYERS, BLENDING, AND
MASK-MAKING TECHNIQUES
IN PHOTOSHOP
When you run the Unsharp Mask ﬁ lter on a ﬂ at image, you have very lim-
ited control after you’ve applied the sharpening. You can immediately use 
the Fade command to reduce the strength of the sharpening or to apply it 
with a blend mode, but a single mouse-click can render Fade unavailable, as 
shown in Figure 5-1.
If you apply sharpening or noise reduction on a layer instead of on a ﬂ at 
image, a whole range of post-application tweaks become available. Much of 
this section is devoted to these tweaks, such as using blending modes, lumi-
nosity targeting, and the creation of edge and surface masks to localize the 
effects of sharpening or noise reduction. We’ll start off by talking about the 
effects we’ll be applying to layers and how to create those layers.

Sharpening on a Layer
In Chapter 4, “Sharpening Tools,” we showed you how to duplicate the 
Background layer to apply sharpening or noise reduction on a separate layer 
above. This provides the beneﬁ ts of offering various layer-blending modes 
and the ability to alter the opacity (or strength) of the sharpening or noise- 
reduction effect. This is ﬁ ne with basic image editing, but if you have a 
complicated image with a bunch of stacked layers, simply duplicating the 
Background layer will be insufﬁ cient. You need a method of creating a layer 
intended for sharpening based on the visible layers you have checked.
Before you can run, you must learn to walk, so ﬁ rst let’s look at the basics of 
creating sharpening layers. There are really only two ways:
• 
If the image is a ﬂ at ﬁ le, duplicate the Background layer.
• 
If the image is a layered ﬁ le, press Option (Mac) or Alt (Windows) 
while selecting Merge Visible from the Layer menu, or press 
Command-Option (or Alt)-Shift-E.
Figures 5-2a and 5-2b show both methods.
You can then apply sharpening to the new layer, leaving the Background or 
underlying layers untouched.

Advanced Option/Merged Procedures
To take advantage of automating the Option/Merged process (which we 
really encourage you to do), you may need to alter the steps you take when 
recording an action to automate this process. Figure 5-3 shows the process 
of recording an error-proof action.
Figure 5-2 showed a simple method of making an Option/Merged layer, but 
doing so does not control exactly where and how the layer is created. We’ll 
cover writing actions in further depth in the last chapter, but it’s important 
to start to develop logical thinking regarding the steps that many of the 
techniques in this chapter will require. Figure 5-3 shows a more compli-
cated layer stack where not all layers are visible—an important consideration 
when doing the Option/Merged command, since many times there may be 
layers you don’t want captured in the resulting merged layer.

CHAPTER 5: INDUSTRIAL-STRENGTH SHARPENING TECHNIQUES

The Action panel shows that selecting the Background layer was a recorded 
step. This is important because the Background layer is about the only layer 
you can be relatively assured of having in an image. Recording this as a step 
will mean that no matter what layer or mask may be active in the layers stack, 
the Background layer will always start as the active target, and the merged 
layer will always show up immediately above. From there it’s a matter of 
moving the layer to the top of the layer stack, renaming the layer, and 
adjusting the blending and opacity.
 
TIP: Reduce opacity before sharpening. If you reduce the sharpening layer’s opacity 
to, for example, 66% before sharpening, you can use the Layer Opacity slider in the 
Layers palette to increase or decrease the strength of the sharpening after it’s been applied. 
Luminosity Blending
One of the key beneﬁ ts of sharpening on a layer is that you can set the layer’s 
blending mode to Luminosity, thereby avoiding the possibility of sharpening-
induced hue shifts.
Some Photoshop gurus recommend converting images to Lab mode, sharp-
ening the Lightness channel, then converting back to RGB. However, unless 
the image actually requires some other operation that demands Lab mode, 
roundtripping from RGB to Lab to RGB is a somewhat destructive process 
on 8-bit/channel images (you lose anywhere from 20 to 35 of the 256 levels 
available due to quantization error) that can lead to unwanted hue shifts and 
possible posterization. On 16-bit/channel images, the quantization error is 
not an issue, but the conversion to Lab and back is time consuming and may 
force you to ﬂ atten the image.
Applying sharpening with the Luminosity blend mode produces results that, 
while not identical to converting to Lab then sharpening the Lightness 
channel, still provide the same main beneﬁ t of doing so—the sharpening 
changes only luminosity, not hue or saturation. 

LAYERS, BLENDING, AND MASK-MAKING TECHNIQUES IN PHOTOSHOP
199
Sharpening Tonal Ranges
Yet another beneﬁ t to sharpening on a layer is that you can constrain the 
sharpening to a speciﬁ c tonal range. This is particularly useful in the early 
stages of the sharpening workﬂ ow, when it’s essential to protect the extreme 
highlights and shadows so that there’s enough headroom for ﬁ nal sharpen-
ing for output.
The key set of controls for this are the Blend If sliders in the Layer Style dialog 
box, which you can open by selecting one of the commands from the Layer 
Style submenu on the Layer menu, or, more conveniently, by double-clicking 
the layer’s icon in the Layers palette. Note that you have to double-click either 
the layer thumbnail or the blank area to the right of the layer name—dou-
ble-clicking the layer name simply makes the name editable! 
Figure 5-4 shows the Layer Style dialog box.
The Blend If sliders are located at the bottom of the dialog box. The top 
slider controls which values in the overlying layer are applied to the image, 
while the bottom slider controls which values in the underlying layer(s) 
receive values from the overlying layer. Figure 5-5 shows the sliders in action.

dialog box and the Blend If

These sliders control which values will 
be applied from the overlying layer.

With the sliders at their default position, 
the overlying layer is fully applied to the

Setting both sliders blocks the extreme 
values in both the overlying and under-
lying layers, but creates harsh transitions.
Adjusting the upper sliders blocks the 
extreme values in the overlying layer 
from being applied.
Pressing Option (Mac) or Alt (Windows) 
lets you split the sliders, thereby 
smoothing the transitions.
Adjusting the lower sliders prevents the 
values in the overlying layer from being 
applied to the extreme values in the 
underlying layer.
Splitting the sliders on both layers 
constrains the sharpening applied by the 
overlying layer to the midtones, protect-
ing the highlights and shadows.

LAYERS, BLENDING, AND MASK-MAKING TECHNIQUES IN PHOTOSHOP
201
Midtone Sharpening
The Blend If sliders are the key to applying strong sharpening to the mid-
tones while protecting the highlights and shadows. Using the sliders, it’s 
possible to apply strong sharpening, yet conﬁ ne it to the midtones, as shown 
in Figure 5-6.
We also use the Blend If sliders to apply midtone contrast, the lack of which 
is often confused with a lack of sharpness.
Sharpening Layer Controls
In practice, we often combine all the techniques discussed thus far on a 
single sharpening layer, starting with either a layer created by duplicating 
the Background layer on a ﬂ at ﬁ le or a new layer created by using Option-
Merge Visible on a layered ﬁ le.
We set the layer to Luminosity blending and 66% opacity. We set the Blend 
If sliders to apply sharpening only to the midtones, we create an edge mask 
and apply it to the layer, and then we sharpen the layer. But we still have a 
signiﬁ cant amount of control after applying the sharpening:
• 
We can increase or decrease the global strength of the sharpening by 
adjusting the layer opacity up or down.
• 
We can adjust the strength of the sharpening along edges by editing the 
layer mask to lighten or darken the edges in the mask—this is made 
easy by using the endpoint controls in Levels.
Figure 5-6

With the sliders at their default position, 
the overlying layer is fully applied to the

Adjusting the sliders as shown at 
left constrains the sharpening to the 
midtones.

CHAPTER 5: INDUSTRIAL-STRENGTH SHARPENING TECHNIQUES

• 
We can adjust the transition between sharpened and unsharpened areas 
by adjusting the contrast of the mask, using either Curves or the gray 
slider in Levels.
• 
We can adjust the width of the sharpening haloes by blurring the mask 
with Gaussian Blur, then editing with Levels or Curves to maintain the 
original tonality.
• 
We can ﬁ ne-tune the tonal range to which the sharpening is applied by 
adjusting the Blend If sliders.
This type of layer-based sharpening lends itself well to automation using 
actions. Most of the difﬁ culties in doing so are a matter of taking into 
account the various assumptions and dependencies actions always entail. 
One of the appealing aspects of automated sharpening layers that use these 
techniques is that they can be run as batch processes to make a large num-
ber of images good automatically, yet still provide enough control after 
sharpening to make the handful of hero images that justify handwork great, 
rather than just good.
Splitting the Sharpening Haloes
When adjusting a single sharpening layer, sometimes it becomes difﬁ cult to 
target the speciﬁ c luminance ranges. Depending on the tonal range of the 
image, you may need to target the darks more or sometimes the lights. By 
splitting up the light and dark haloes, you can control the relative amounts 
of sharpening far more accurately. 
Figure 5-7 shows the image we’ll use to adjust the luminance targets for 
sharpening. The image has an Unsharp Mask ﬁ lter applied with the Amount 
setting at 200 and Radius at .6. The sharpening was done on a separate layer 
set to Luminosity blend and an opacity of 66% (Figure 5-8).
• 
Adjusting the light haloes: In Figure 5-9, which shows the light con-
tours being adjusted, we’ve set the white clip to be 250. We don’t want 
to drive any textural tones to pure white. We’ve set the blend to taper in 
until level 220, where the full effect of the sharpened layer will be applied 
down to 140, when we once again taper off until level 110. This set of 
blending options concentrates the sharpening for this layer to target the 
quarter tones of the image. The overlay in the middle becomes the split 
point between the lights and the darks.

It’s tough to visualize how the blend split impacts an image, so Figure 5-10 
shows the original unsharpened and sharpened images, and the two sepa-
rate blend layers.

Be aware that the Photoshop working space you choose to use has an impact 
on the Blend If split points. Bruce and Jeff use Pro Photo RGB almost 
exclusively. Pro Photo RGB has a gamma of 1.8. If you use Adobe RGB (or, 
heaven forbid, sRGB), the gamma of those spaces is 2.2. (Actually, sRGB 
has a slightly modiﬁ ed 2.2 tone curve, but that’s not relevant for this discus-
sion.) As a result, you may need to slightly alter the split point up or down, 
and you may also need to vary the shadow halo blends. Gamma 2.2 is a 
steeper tone curve, and therefore shadow three-quarter tones tend to be 
emphasized. Narrowing the shadow feather of 15 to 40 down to 10 to 30 
may help with the gamma adjustment tweaks. In terms of the light halo clip 
point, there shouldn’t be much need to alter those other than ﬁ ne-tuning 
them for your own taste.
Jeff is often asked whether or not it matters which of the Blend If sliders are 
adjusted. (The top set of sliders, labeled “This Layer,” refers to the layer that 
is being blended down. The bottom set of sliders, “Underlying Layer,” dic-
tates the area of the bottom layer that gets blended into.) Yes, it does matter, 
but in the case of image sharpening or noise reduction, it matters very little. 
Since the intention is to roll off or otherwise reduce the impact of the 
effects on extreme highlights and shadows, the net impact is so similar as to 
not matter. 
There are times, particularly if you use any of the Advanced Blending 
options in the middle of the Layer Style dialog box, where it does indeed 
matter whether you are adjusting the top or bottom sliders. The most criti-
cal adjustment point, in the case of splitting the haloes, is where you set the 
top of the dark and bottom of the light haloes. Our setting of 110 to 140 is a 
very gentle split point. If you narrow the numbers, you get a more speciﬁ c 
cutoff between the light and dark haloes. If you do narrow the blend, be 
sure to check the results so that they are as expected.
Between adjusting the overall opacity and the blending options, you can 
acquire a lot of control over how and where sharpening and noise reduction 
will get applied. However, to ﬁ ne-tune exactly where the effects occur, you 
need to deploy layer masks. 

CHAPTER 5: INDUSTRIAL-STRENGTH SHARPENING TECHNIQUES
206
Layer Masks
A signiﬁ cant beneﬁ t to applying sharpening on a layer is that you can use a 
layer mask to localize the sharpening to speciﬁ c areas of the image. You can 
adjust the transition between sharpened and nonsharpened areas by adjust-
ing the blur and contrast of the layer mask. You can, within limits, adjust 
the width of the sharpening haloes by blurring, then adjusting the contrast, 
of the mask.
We use layer masks with sharpening or noise-reduction layers in two dis-
tinct ways:
• 
Edge or surface masks localize effects along the edges or surfaces in the 
image.
• 
Brush masks let you paint the effect in (and out) by painting on the 
layer mask with white or black.
Edge Masks
Creating an edge mask is a multistep process. The ﬁ rst step is to create a 
new channel that has good contrast along the edges you want to sharpen. 
In many cases, you can simply duplicate the red or green channel (the blue 
channel usually has more noise, and hence isn’t a good candidate). In 
Chapter 4, we showed the ability to load the Luminance image info by 
Command-clicking (Mac) the RGB composite channel. You can also use 
the keyboard shortcuts of Command-Option-2 (Mac) or Control-Alt-2 
(Windows). This loads the image’s luminosity as an active selection. From 
there you save the selection as a channel for further work. 
Figure 5-11 shows the image we’ll be using for this edge mask example. 
This is the full-frame image downsampled and output sharpened for print.
We used Command-click on the RGB composite channel to load the lumi-
nosity of the image as a selection and saved the selection as a channel. 
Figure 5-12 shows the luminosity of the center portion of the image.

NOTE: In the previous edition of this book, Bruce outlined a procedure for using the 
Calculations command in Photoshop to combine the Red and Green channels using 
a Pin Light blending and saving this as a channel. Bruce used this approach while Jeff  
appreciated the more immediate method of Command-clicking the RGB composite channel. 
A careful examination will indeed reveal very slight diff erences between the two techniques. 
We’ll leave it to the reader to test the very “Brucian” alternative of using Calculations and 
determine if it matters.

Figure 5-13 shows the result of applying the Find Edges ﬁ lter under the 
Stylize submenu in the Filters main menu. This is a one-trick pony. The 
results depend entirely on the edges in your images, and it’s up to you to 
modify the edges as you see ﬁ t. Figure 5-13 will need to be inverted to act 
as an edge mask. Further modiﬁ cation will require blurring and toning to 
achieve the optimal edge or surface mask result.
Figure 5-14 shows the original edge mask (Figure 5-13 inverted) as well as 
four different blurred results. Adding blur will soften the transitions between 
edge and surface areas. For high-frequency images, blur at a lower amount 
to preserve the edges for sharpening. For wider edges you’ll often need to 
soften them with a higher Radius. With surface masks for noise reduction, 
it’s typical to blur the mask a lot.
As you can see, very small amounts of blurring can have a big impact in the 
edge-width transitions. Figure 5-15 shows before and after applying the 
3-pixel blurred edge mask.
The aim of the edge mask is to cut back on the harshness of the effect that 
sharpening has on surface areas while concentrating the sharpening to the 
edges. It’s sometimes very hard to determine the extent to which to blur the 
edge mask. We suggest zooming in on critical areas of your image and 
applying the Gaussian Blur to the layer mask while looking at the actual 
image. Adjusting the pixel radius of the blur up or down lets you ﬁ ne-tune 
the effect for your speciﬁ c image.

Find Edges, Then Gaussian Blur…or Vice Versa?
The order of operations does matter. Figure 5-16 shows the result of changing 
the order in which the Gaussian Blur was applied. The fi rst image shows the 
proper order of Find Edges and then Gaussian Blur. The second image shows 
what happens to the edges if you apply the blur before the Find Edges fi lter. 
In general we suggest using Find Edges fi rst—particularly for higher-resolution 
images where you want to accurately control how the edges are tweaked. 
You may also wonder whether you want to apply the edge mask as a layer 
mask before or after you do the image sharpening to the pixel layer. That will 
depend in large part on your sharpening workfl ow. It doesn’t functionally matter 
whether you apply the edge mask as a layer mask before or after you apply 
the sharpening. If you are sharpening by eye (which, as we’ve stated, has risks), 
you may want to sharpen the layer and then apply the layer mask with blur-
ring to suit the image. Often, tonal adjustments must be done after the edge 
mask is made into the layer mask.
Figure 5-16 Comparing the order of operations
Blurring the edge mask can go only so far. Generally you must adjust the 
tonality of the mask to your image. You can use Levels or Curves, but we 
ﬁ nd the quick tone adjustment of Levels to be more suitable, since we are 
generally trying to choke (make smaller) or spread (make bigger) the edges. 
By lightening the tonality, more of the sharpening effect will be allowed to 
pass through with the increased opacity that a lighter mask gives.

Figure 5-17 shows the effect of substantially lightening the clipping point of 
the mask.
You can also ﬁ ll with a slight opacity of white to lighten the entire mask to 
ensure that all of the image will get a touch of sharpening. Jeff often does 
this with high-resolution scans of large-format ﬁ lm (4” x 5” or 8” x 10” 
chromes, but not negatives) because he scans without any sharpening. 
Figure 5-18 shows the result of taking the mask from Figure 5-17 and add-
ing a 25% opacity ﬁ ll with white.
This can be done right on the mask with the layer mask targeted while 
viewing the color image. You can undo the ﬁ ll if you don’t like the effect, or 
modify it by using the Fade command to cut back on the strength of the ﬁ ll.
Edge masks will generally want to be sharper masks, but when you want to 
turn an edge mask into a surface mask, you will generally need further blur-
ring and tone modiﬁ cation.

212
Surface Masks
While edge masks are used for sharpening the edges in an image, a surface 
mask can be used to apply noise reduction to the non-edges areas that we 
call surfaces. Surface masks are often more blurred and lighter in nature to 
allow noise reduction to gently hit more areas of the image prior to sharp-
ening the result of the noise reduction. That’s the order you’ll want to do 
the effects: noise reduction before (or during, at least) the sharpening.
Figure 5-19 shows the result of taking the original edge mask from Figure 
5-14 and adding an 8-pixel Gaussian Blur to make a softer surface mask.
There are times when you may need to modify the tonality of a surface 
mask, usually by increasing the strength of the edge protection from noise 
reduction. Figure 5-20 shows darkening the edges to reduce the smoothing 
effect of the noise reduction.

Figure 5-21 shows a contact-size image with the ﬁ nal Layers and Channels 
panel. The contact-size image was output sharpened for the book. The 
entire image would have reproduced as a 13” x 9” image at 300 ppi. 
At the bottom of the layers stack is a layer that used Reduce Noise at an 
Amount of 6 and Preserve Details setting of 60%. It had a surface mask 
based on the Find Edges result and then blurred 8 pixels. The sharpening 
layers used an Unsharp Mask ﬁ lter with an Amount of 400 and a Radius of 
.7. The edge mask was a 2-pixel blur of the original edge mask shown in 
Figure 5-14.
All of this is rather abstract considering that ultimately we want to create 
images, not a bunch of layers and masks, right? Well, the rest of this chapter 
is chock full of edge and surface masks, and rather than rewrite the steps 
each and every time, we wanted to concentrate on how to create and use 
layers and masks for sharpening and noise reduction. Now let’s move on to 
capture sharpening as a process in Photoshop.

Selections, Channels, and Masks
Selections, channels, and masks are all the same thing as far as Photoshop is 
concerned. They are simply three diff erent roles played by the same data. 
A selection is simply a temporary channel, which can be made permanent by 
saving it using the Save Selection command from the Select menu.
Saved Channels appear in the Channels palette. To load a channel as a selec-
tion, you can choose Load Selection from the Select menu, then choose the 
channel in the Load Selection dialog box. Or you can do this much more 
quickly by Command-clicking the channel’s tile in the Channels palette.
To add a channel as a layer mask, you must fi rst load it as a selection using 
either of the methods just described. Then you can add it as a layer mask by 
selecting the layer and either choosing one of the Layer Mask commands from 
the Layer menu, or clicking the Add Layer Mask button in the Layers palette.
CAPTURE SHARPENING IN
PHOTOSHOP
Capture sharpening is a combination of sharpening for source and content. 
The goal in source optimization is to counteract the softening effects of the 
demosaicing process and, when present, the antialiasing ﬁ lter. The goal in 
content sharpening is to enhance the edges while mitigating the adverse 
effects of ﬁ lm grain or camera noise. 
The capture-sharpening process varies considerably depending on whether 
you are using Photoshop, Camera Raw, or Lightroom. With Photoshop, you 
need to create sharpening layers, add layer masks for edges and surfaces, and 
in general do a lot of image-by-image handwork. It’s tedious and time con-
suming, although automating large chunks makes it less of a burden. We’re 
going to keep the automation for the next chapter and concentrate here on 
the process of sharpening in Photoshop. Most of these examples will be for 
ﬁ lm sharpening, where the processing techniques are used to both reduce 
noise while adding sharpness.
If you are scanning ﬁ lm, you’ll want to be doing your capture sharpening in 
Photoshop. Scanning ﬁ lm properly requires a large degree of attention to 
detail as well as reliance on the hardware you are using. Jeff and Bruce used

a high-end CCD scanner rather than a drum scanner. But even with a 
relatively low-end ﬂ atbed scanner, you can get good results if you make 
sure you don’t let the scanner try to do the sharpening—and sometimes it 
can be a real challenge to turn off that unwanted sharpening. We’ll start 
with the relatively easy scanning of a medium-format transparency, move 
on to a 35mm chrome, and ﬁ nish the ﬁ lm scans with a very difﬁ cult ISO 
1600 color negative, where we had to punt Photoshop and turn to a third-
party tool.
Medium-Format Transparency
When we said scanning and sharpening medium-format ﬁ lm was relatively 
easy, we meant it. The larger ﬁ lm sizes equate to better image detail and 
generally lower ﬁ lm grain—the two main areas where capture sharpening is 
directed. We’ll start by scanning a 6” x 7” transparency in the scanner’s soft-
ware. Figure 5-22 shows the preview of the image and the Texture controls 
to turn off sharpening on the software.

CHAPTER 5: INDUSTRIAL-STRENGTH SHARPENING TECHNIQUES
216
Turning Off Sharpening 
As you see in Figure 5-22, the Texture dialog box controls the sharpening 
applied to the image during scanning. One might think that setting the 
sharpening to zero would turn off the sharpening, but alas, no. In order to 
completely eliminate any effects of sharpening, you actually have to set this 
to -120. If you don’t know this little secret, life can be pretty irritating. For 
most scanners, simply turning off the sharpening is sufﬁ cient. We point this 
out not so much to point fun at this otherwise very good scanner software, 
but to clarify that one must be very careful when setting up the scanner to 
be sure to disable any sharpening.
Preparing for Sharpening 
Upon opening the image in Photoshop, ﬁ nal tone and color correction was 
done and close-up spotting was ﬁ nished. There’s nothing as frustrating as 
setting up all your sharpening layers only to ﬁ nd out that what you’ve done 
is nicely sharpened a whole bunch of dust and scratches as well as your 
image. An edge and a surface mask were created as well. Figure 5-23 shows 
both masks.

The low-blur edge mask allowed restricting the sharpening to the many 
high-frequency textural elements in the image. The softer surface mask 
allowed a general overall noise reduction that was already slightly edge 
protected by using the Reduce Noise ﬁ lter. 
Figure 5-24 shows a tiny contact-print-sized portion of the ﬁ nal image. 
The overall scanned image size was 22.5” x 28.25” at 300 ppi. The ﬁ gure 
also shows the ﬁ nal Layers panel.
Slight Noise Reduction and Sharpening
Since the edge mask was controlling the edge width, the Unsharp Mask ﬁ lter 
could be used at a slightly higher radius. The Reduce Noise layer helped get 
rid of the ﬁ lm grain signature prior to the sharpening. The sharpening layer 
was made by creating an Option/Merged layer of the Background layer plus 
the Reduce Noise layer. The Blend If sharpening was a simple roll off of 
the lights and the darks without the need to split the sharpening haloes. 
As we said, noise reduction and sharpening for medium-format ﬁ lm scans 
is rather easy! 
Figure 5-25 shows the original unsharpened scan as well as the noise reduc-
tion and ﬁ nal sharpening.

35mm Transparency 
Capture sharpening small-format ﬁ lm is a bit more difﬁ cult than medium-
format. Everything done to the scan is magniﬁ ed because the ﬁ lm is 
smaller, so the grain is more obvious and the images need more aggressive 
noise reduction and sharpening.
Moderate Noise Reduction and Sharpening
Figure 5-26 shows a scan from a 35mm transparency that requires stronger 
noise reduction than the previous example of a medium-format transpar-
ency. The stronger grain of 35mm requires stronger Reduce Noise settings 
that soften the image noticeably, so we mitigate the effect by adding a layer 
mask to the Reduce Noise layer that protects the edges.

After Reduce Noise
This layer mask was made by creating a Luminance selection with 
the Noise Reduction layer targeted, then saving the selection as 
a channel. We then ran the Find Edges fi lter, applied a 5-pixel 
Gaussian Blur, and adjusted the white Input slider in Levels to 240.

220
The addition of the edge mask to the noise-reduction layer allows for the 
application of enough noise reduction to reduce the grain in the sky without 
softening the important edges in the image too much. The addition of the 
sharpening layer essentially returns the image to its original sharpness, but 
with less grain.
High-Speed 35mm Color Negative
Where our ﬁ rst two examples could be handled adequately completely inside 
of Photoshop’s toolset, this next example is simply outside of Photoshop’s 
capabilities. The image of the Irish pub in Dublin was shot on Fuji ISO 
1600 color negative ﬁ lm. The combination of being a negative plus the high 
ISO means that Photoshop’s built-in tools won’t make much of a dent in the 
excessive high-ISO grain. 
Figure 5-27 shows the full frame of the image after noise reduction, sharp-
ening, and downsampling. The ﬁ lm grain doesn’t look very obvious in the 
downsampled version, but in the contact-print size (at 300 ppi), you can see 
all that lovely ﬁ lm grain busting through. If reproduced small, we really 
wouldn’t need to do too much, but if we want to use the image near its 
native scan size of 13” x 20” at 300 ppi, some pretty industrial-strength 
noise reduction will be needed.
Resorting to a Specialized Tool 
We tried a variety of special noise-reduction techniques using Reduce 
Noise, Surface Blur, and Despeckle, but to no avail. The high-speed ﬁ lm 
grain could not be reduced to any useful degree using just Photoshop. So, we 
turned to a third-party specialty plug-in called Noiseware from Imagenomic 
(www.imagenomic.com). Bruce and Jeff were introduced to this plug-in by 
our good friend and colleague Mac Holbert of Nash Editions fame. Mac 
prints for some of the world’s top artists and photographers, and sometimes 
he really needs some heavy-duty noise reduction.
Figure 5-28 shows the main Noiseware Profession plug-in dialog box. The 
settings represent special adjustments to really go after both luminance and 
color noise reduction. It is hitting into the edge detail a tiny bit. You can see 
that the resulting layer and layer mask has a few areas painted out (black 
added) to reduce the effects of the noise reduction in key areas.

NOTE: A note here regarding your own personal favorite noise-reduction tool: If you 
already have something you like, such as Neat Image, Noise Ninja, or a variety of oth-
ers, that’s all fi ne and good. The main point we are trying to get across here is not a specifi c 
endorsement of Noiseware, but rather the fact that it’s simply not worth struggling to do 
something in Photoshop that can’t really be done. Bite the bullet and go out and get a tool 
that is specially designed to do serious noise reduction. This holds true both for high-speed 
fi lm grain such as this example but high-ISO digital captures as well.

222
Sharpening the Reduced Noise
After applying noise reduction, we created a new sharpening layer by using 
the Option/Merged technique. This allowed us to apply sharpening on the 
already reduced noise image. We used Unsharp Mask with an Amount of 
200 and a Radius of 1.2. We created an edge mask with a 3-pixel Gaussian 
blur and applied the edge mask as a layer mask. In order to allow some of 
the sharpening to hit all over the image, we ﬁ lled the layer mask with a 33% 
opacity white ﬁ ll. Yes, this tended to resharpen some of the reduced noise 
back into stronger appearance, but we could control the relative strength via 
the edge mask. We intentionally overreduced the grain using Noiseware 
with the expectation of resharpening the image. 
Figure 5-29 shows the sharpening layer and the tone-modiﬁ ed layer mask.
The sharpening layer was set to 66% Opacity with Luminance blending. We 
used the typical single-layer roll off of the highlights and shadows using the 
Blend If slider options. The ﬁ nal results are shown in Figure 5-30.
Having to resort to a third-party plug-in may frustrate some Photoshop 
users. Yes, we agree that Photoshop could and should have the best-of-breed 
functionality, but we are also sensitive to the fact that one of Photoshop’s 
greatest strengths through the years is a healthy and viable third-party devel-
opment environment. If Photoshop took away all the nooks and crannies of 
plug-in development, we wouldn’t have third parties, and the industry would 
be less for that.

NOTE: Clearly we can’t cover each and every fi lm and scanner type in the book. The 
main essence of fi lm scanning is to try to get the highest-resolution scan possible 
with no sharpening and in 16 bit. Optimizing the scan for tone, color correction, dust, and 
scratches prior to noise reduction and sharpening is imperative. 
Scanning to Reduce Noise
Some scanner drivers let you scan the ﬁ lm multiple times to reduce scanner 
noise. You can often get a much cleaner scan using four passes than you can 
using one. Some scanner drivers let you scan as many as 16 passes, which in 
our view is overkill. This technique suppresses scanner noise, but doesn’t 
address ﬁ lm grain. A technique that does address ﬁ lm grain is to scan at a 
higher resolution than is needed, then downsample—this mitigates both 
scanner noise and ﬁ lm grain.
Using Third-Party Raw Processing Software
Before we move on to Camera Raw and Lightroom capture sharpening, 
there is still another type of image sharpening that needs to be addressed in 
Photoshop: digital capture from cameras that aren’t supported by Camera 
Raw and Lightroom. One such camera back is the Phase One P 65+. 
Additionally, when that back is mounted on the Phase One/Mamiya 645 
camera using the newest lenses, you need to use the Capture One software 
Noise-reduced layer

CHAPTER 5: INDUSTRIAL-STRENGTH SHARPENING TECHNIQUES
224
to process out images while taking advantage of the automatic lens correc-
tions that Capture One offers.
For this example we’ll be using Capture One raw processing software to 
process a raw capture from a Phase One P 65+ capture. We’re doing this for 
two reasons: For one, while Camera Raw and Lightroom can process out P 
65+ raw captures, the processing isn’t optimized at this point in time. We 
could process out the captures as digital negative (DNG) ﬁ les from Capture 
One and then use those linear DNGs in Camera Raw and Lightroom, but 
there are “issues” with doing that at this time. But the main reason we want 
to use the Capture One software is that for the 4.x version, Phase has added 
automatic lens-correction processing that handles spherical aberrations, 
lateral chromatic aberrations, and lens distortion and vignetting. So, for the 
cameras and lens supported, Phase One’s Capture One can output more 
fully optimized images. We do still like to take control of the noise reduc-
tion (if needed) and capture sharpening ourselves, however.
Using Capture One 
The primary settings we want to show in Capture One are the Lens 
Correction adjustments. Figure 5-31 shows the main interface for Capture 
One 4.8 as well as details on two important panels: the Lens Corrections 
and the Process Recipe where Sharpening has been disabled. The Lens 
Correction settings are set to correct for chromatic aberration, purple fring-
ing, sharpness falloff, and vignetting.
This is the same image we used in Chapter 2, “Why Do We Sharpen?”, for 
the camera comparison in Figure 2-9. The capture’s native size after pro-
cessing is 22.4” x 26.9” at 300 ppi. There was no need for any noise reduc-
tion. The ISO for the capture was 50, the lowest on the back. There was 
simply no appreciable or noticeable noise in the capture. We have seen noise 
occur with this sensor when using longer timed exposures over 30 seconds.

CAPTURE SHARPENING IN PHOTOSHOP
225
Creating the Sharpening Layers 
In this simple case, we dragged the Background layer 
to the New Layer icon to make a copy of the layer. We 
applied an Unsharp Mask ﬁ lter with an Amount of 
400 and a Radius of .5. We set the Blend If settings to 
split the sharpening haloes. We also slightly modiﬁ ed 
the light halo opacity down from our normal 66% to just 50%, because we 
felt that, in some of the super light textural areas, we were getting just a tad 
too much sharpening. We could have mitigated this with the Blend If set-
tings, but adjusting the opacity was quicker. Figure 5-32 shows the Layers 
panel for the darks and lights sharpening as well as the Blend If settings.
The edge mask was created using the typical Find Edges. In this case, the 
Gaussian Blur was 2 pixels. The actual edge width was determined more by 
the Unsharp Mask settings instead of the width of the edge mask. But the 
edge mask kept the sharpening from affecting the surface areas. Figure 5-33 
shows the edge mask at a 200% zoom.

For the layer mask we ﬁ lled a slight amount with white (15% opacity) to 
allow some of the sharpening to be applied over the entire image. This is 
really seasoning to taste, but in general we caution that it’s far better to 
undersharpen than to oversharpen at the capture-sharpening stage. You 
can always go back and increase relative opacities or create completely new 
creative sharpening to pump up the sharpening level.

For the purposes of capture sharpening, we’ve covered a variety of tech-
niques that are needed in Photoshop. In the next section, we’ll cover doing 
capture sharpening in Camera Raw and Lightroom.
CAPTURE SHARPENING IN CAMERA
R AW AND LIGHTROOM
We used to turn off sharpening in Camera Raw because the sharpening 
wasn’t what we would call optimal. Since the advent of improved capture 
sharpening in Camera Raw and Lightroom, however, we rarely if ever need 
to resort to using Photoshop for capture sharpening. A lot of people using 
Camera Raw and Lightroom for capture sharpening fail to understand the 
relationship between the predominant edge width in the image and the 
radius being set for sharpening. While it’s not absolutely critical that you nail 
the correct radius in measurements of .1, it is critical that you don’t com-
pletely misconstrue and use the complete opposite. For narrow-edged images 
that have a lot of high-frequency textural image data, you’ll want to use a 
radius below 1.0. For images with wider edges that have lower frequency, 
the radius should be above 1.0.

CHAPTER 5: INDUSTRIAL-STRENGTH SHARPENING TECHNIQUES
228
Determining Edge Width
Images with super high-frequency texture aren’t all that hard to ﬁ nd. Many 
if not most landscape images tend to have a high preponderance of narrow 
edges. Most portraits of people tend toward wide edges and lower frequency. 
Figure 5-35 shows the super high-frequency edges while 5-38 shows low-
frequency edges.
Super High-Frequency Edges
All of the images in the super high-frequency array of images need very 
small radius settings in Camera Raw or Lightroom. While not disastrous, 
a radius of 1.0 (the default) will be suboptimal, particularly if you push the 
amounts higher than the default of 25. In general you’ll also want detail 
settings that are on the higher side.
To further drive home the point, we’ll use an image of golden-colored 
Aspen trees as an example. Figure 5-36 shows the sharpened image with 
the Camera Raw and Lightroom settings that we arrived at as optimal.
The Radius setting of 0.5 is the smallest radius we can get in Camera Raw 
and Lightroom at this time (that’s not to say it won’t change in the future—
we hope it gets lowered). To arrive at the radius was pretty simple. Experience 
has taught us that cutting the radius in half for these kinds of images is suit-
able. Reducing the radius allows us to increase the amount of the sharpening

frequency edges

229
as well as the detail setting to further concentrate the sharpening into the 
high-frequency range. Remember that radius is tied to the detail settings as 
well as to the mask settings, so getting the radius correct is important.
Figure 5-37 shows the preview of the Radius, Detail, and the Masking set-
tings we determined were optimal. Note that this image has Luminance 
noise reduction set to 20, which allows us to push the Detail settings higher 
than default.

Low-Frequency Edges
We present a series of images in Figure 5-38 that we have determined are 
low-frequency-edged images. All of these images will need a radius setting 
above the 1.0 default. How much higher? That takes an image-by-image 
assessment, but the upper range that we’ve found useful is a radius of 2.0. 
Generally 1.2 to 1.5 is what we consider the normal setting for these sorts 
of images.
We’ll take an image by Martin Evening of model Courtney as our example 
for the edge adjustment. The primary areas of the image we need sharpened 
are the eyelashes, hair, and lips. We don’t want to emphasize the skin texture
—if anything, we’ll end up wanting to minimize it. Figure 5-39 shows the 
ﬁ nal settings we arrived at for this image. We used a Radius of 1.4, which is 
almost 50% larger than the default 1.0. We also used a lower Detail setting 
and a rather high Masking setting.
We’ll admit to a certain degree of local image correction and spot healing on 
this image—discretion precludes us from showing just how much. It sufﬁ ces 
to say that Martin’s lighting and the excellent makeup went a long way 
toward making the image look good, but reality always requires a special 
touch. Since we did some touch-up (in Camera Raw/Lightroom only, not 
Photoshop), we were free to punch up the strength of the capture sharpening.

With Detail set to 15, we’ve deemphasized the high-frequency texture and 
suppressed the haloes. That allowed us to increase the amount to a rather 
high 65. We also have Masking set rather high and added a touch of noise 
reduction. The original image was well exposed at an ISO of 125, but we 
wanted to further smooth down the skin (which Luminance noise reduc-
tion will do) and could compensate with increased sharpening. Figure 5-40 
shows the Radius, Detail, and Masking previews.

Medium-Frequency Edges 
While it’s fairly easy to discriminate between the two opposite extremes 
of edge frequencies, where it becomes more of a challenge is when the 
frequencies fall in the middle—what we call “medium,” which we realize 
isn’t very deﬁ nitive, but there you have it. Figure 5-41 shows a range of 
images that we consider medium with regard to the frequency of the edges.
The one thing these images have in common is each image has areas of 
higher frequency that might beneﬁ t from a really low radius, while other 
areas in the images would do better with a higher radius. The only guidance 
we can offer is to do what looks best for each individual image. Know that 
the range of radius settings will probably be above 0.5 and below 1.5. 
Setting the Detail will have a big impact on the way in which the higher 
frequency is handled. Also know that a bit of masking will almost always 
be needed, and most images—even well-exposed, low-ISO images—may 
beneﬁ t from a small amount of noise reduction. Where the real challenges 
lay, however, is when you have an image that has diametrically opposed 
sharpening requirements. When you encounter this sort of image, it’s time 
to call in the big guns (if you want the optimal results): either Camera Raw 
or Lightroom and Photoshop.

Blending Image Frequencies with 
Smart Objects
When faced with an image whose sharpening needs exceed the ability for 
either Camera Raw or Lightroom to adequately cope, the only option is to 
do the capture sharpening twice and blend the result. You could simply 
process the image twice and bring both images into Photoshop as layers 
for blending using layer masks. This is a good technique, but it’s not quite 
as ﬂ exible as we like. We like to use Camera Raw or Lightroom raw ﬁ les 
opened in Photoshop as Smart Objects (SOs).
Setting Up Camera Raw to Create Smart Objects 
To create SOs from Camera Raw, you must open an image in Camera Raw 
to access the Camera Raw Workﬂ ow Options dialog box. Figure 5-42 shows 
Camera Raw, the Workﬂ ow Options dialog box, and what happens to the 
Open button when you change the options.
As shown in Figure 5-42, once you select the “Open in Photoshop as Smart 
Objects” option, the main Open button alerts you to the change in the 
behavior. If you want to bypass the Smart Objects option and simply open 
the image directly as a raster image in Photoshop, hold down the Shift key 
when clicking the Open button.
Using Camera Raw Snapshots 
Actually, before even opening the image in Photoshop, we suggest ﬁ ne-
tuning the two sets of capture sharpening you’ll want to use in your SO. 
The reason to adjust the sharpening before opening as a SO is because once 
opened in Photoshop, the embedded raw ﬁ le no longer has a direct relation-
ship to the original raw ﬁ le. It’s very difﬁ cult to propagate any changes made 
in the embedded raw ﬁ le inside of the Smart Object back to the original 
raw ﬁ le. 
Figure 5-43 shows the result of adjusting the sharpening for the two primary 
edge widths in the image. Two Snapshots are created and saved before 
opening the image in Photoshop.

Creating a Smart Object Copy Layer 
Combining two or more copies of a raw Smart Object requires a slightly 
different technique than simply dragging the SO to the New Layer icon in 
the Layers panel. You need to use the New Smart Object via Copy com-
mand, found in the Layers > Smart Objects menu. Using this command 
keeps both layers as discrete objects and allows you to alter the parametric 
settings of each object separately. Figure 5-44 shows the command to create 
a new Smart Object via Copy.

Editing Smart Object Parameters 
Once you have both SO layers in your stack, double-clicking either image 
icon will actually launch a special version of Camera Raw designed for Smart 
Objects. Instead of the Open buttons, they are changed to OK and Cancel. 
Figure 5-45 shows double-clicking the top SO copy and selecting the LF 
Sharp Snapshot from the Snapshots panel. If you wanted to make any other 
changes, such as tone or color adjustments, to the image, you could do so at 
this time. Once you’ve made the Snapshot selection, clicking the OK button 
will update that layer’s settings. From there, it’s a matter of using a layer 
mask to blend the modiﬁ ed sharpening in or out by painting on the mask.

The ﬁ nal results in Figure 5-46 show the two layers and the ﬁ nal combination 
using a layer mask. Note that on the HF Sharp layer, the noise in the sky and 
the high-frequency texture are both enhanced. In the LF Sharp layer, a wider 
radius and the Detail settings reduced to zero have the effect of substantially 
smoothing out the image. The ﬁ nal result shows the higher-frequency tex-
tural enhancements while preserving the smoother areas of the sky.

Using Smart Objects with Lightroom 
Both Camera Raw and Lightroom can create Smart Objects in Photoshop. 
Both also support the creation of Snapshots, as shown in Figure 5-47. 
Lightroom allows you to create the Snapshots and automatically adds them 
into the resulting embedded raw Smart Object inside Photoshop.
Editing in Photoshop from Lightroom 
In the Edit In menu, rather than selecting the normal Edit in Adobe 
Photoshop CS4, we’ll select the “Open as Smart Object in Photoshop” 
option. Lightroom hands off the image to Photoshop, where the embedded 
raw object will be on a layer, as shown back in Figure 5-42. In fact, once the 
Smart Object ﬁ le is created in Photoshop, everything is the same as the pre-
ceding sections, including the way in which you add a copy layer and edit 
parameters. Since we’ve created Lightroom Snapshots, those same Snapshots 
will be available inside of the special version of Camera Raw. In fact, it is 
Camera Raw that will be doing the Smart Object layer parameter editing, 
even though you started out in Lightroom. 
Figure 5-48 shows the Lightroom command in the Photo menu.

Saving the Smart Object in Lightroom 
Once you complete the image editing, including any creative sharpening 
you may want to do, saving the image from within Photoshop will make 
that Smart Object image ﬁ le appear back in Lightroom as a rendered TIFF 
or PSD ﬁ le (depending on your Lightroom preferences). Figure 5-49 shows 
the original DNG ﬁ le as well as the edited TIFF ﬁ le back in Lightroom.

Reediting the Smart Object File 
With Lightroom, the ability to keep original raw ﬁ les and rendered image 
ﬁ les (such as this Smart Object ﬁ le) together greatly aids in image organiza-
tion. You can still edit the Smart Object image ﬁ le back inside of Photoshop 
by selecting the Edit in Adobe Photoshop CS4 command in Lightroom. In 
the dialog box that opens, shown in Figure 5-50, you can select what you 
want to edit in Photoshop, or you can select Edit a Copy with Lightroom 
Adjustments, Edit a Copy, or Edit Original. Select Edit Original to be able 
to open the original Smart Object image ﬁ le with all your layers intact.
Using Smart Objects for dual-edge frequency sharpening does provide a lot 
of ﬂ exibility to combine multiple iterations of raw ﬁ les. It does, however, come 
at a price: ﬁ le size. An image whose pixel dimensions might be 4000 x 2700 
would be about a 63 MB ﬁ le when saved as a ﬂ attened 16-bit TIFF. The same 
ﬁ le with the original Smart Object dual layers and perhaps a couple more 
retouching layers would swell to a ﬁ le over 250 MB saved to disk. If you are 
looking to save hard drive space, using Smart Objects isn’t the way to do so.
While we do encourage people to be very conservative when saving layers 
ﬁ les (save all the layers you may ever need to change), using Smart Objects 
for a large number of raw ﬁ les isn’t advisable. That brings us to the discus-
sion of whether or not you should keep layered ﬁ les containing all your 
capture sharpening saved as layers. 
Figure 5-50 
The Edit in Photoshop 
dialog box

CONTROLLING FILE SIZE

CONTROLLING FILE SIZE
Sharpening and noise-reduction layers and masks add signiﬁ cantly to the 
size of the ﬁ le. A single sharpening layer doubles the size of the ﬁ le, and 
each extra channel or layer mask adds one-third of the original ﬁ le size. 
So ﬁ le sizes can balloon quite quickly.
Of course, the only way to retain complete control over the sharpening is to 
keep the layers intact and take the hit on ﬁ le size. Other sensible strategies are
• 
Once you’ve tweaked the sharpening to your satisfaction, archive the 
layered ﬁ le and continue to work on a ﬂ attened copy.
• 
Once you’ve tweaked the sharpening to your satisfaction, simply ﬂ atten 
the image.
• 
To retain some degree of control over the sharpening, create a new layer 
using Option-Merge Visible, then delete the sharpening layers and 
masks. Note that the merged layer will be a Normal blend layer with 
100% opacity, so you won’t be able to reduce the sharpening. You can 
work around this by increasing the opacity of the sharpening layer to 
100% before creating the merged layer, then you can reduce the opacity 
of the merged layer to the strength you prefer.
So, to the question of whether to ﬂ atten or not, our answer is yes and no. 
Yes, it is useful and advisable to save the layers—you can always ﬂ atten a 
Smart Object down to a simple pixel layer. But no, if you are sure you’ve 
optimized the image ﬁ le for capture sharpening, then go ahead and merge 
or otherwise reduce the layer count—if you are sure you won’t ever need to 
revisit the layers.
This is one of the reasons we greatly prefer Camera Raw and/or Lightroom 
for capture sharpening—the sharpening parameters are stored only in meta-
data and can be changed at any time until the ﬁ le is rendered into pixels.
This brings us to the close of the capture sharpening discussion. The next 
section starts down the road of being creative (something many people 
refuse to admit they love to be).

Smart Filters
Bruce and Jeff  have a standing reaction to anything on which Adobe hangs the “Smart” moniker in Photoshop. 
The feature itself isn’t necessarily smart, but it sure does take a really smart person to use the feature. Smart 
Filters follow along with the Photoshop legacy. If you want to use Smart Filters, you better plan on getting an 
advanced degree in Photoshop.
Smart Filters can be attached to any Smart Object (you see the trend here?), and to use Smart Filters you must 
have Smart Objects in your fi le. Figure 5-51 shows a Smart Filter applied to a Smart Object in the same image 
as our Smart Objects example image. The Smart Filter appears in the Layers panel below the Smart Object, 
as layer eff ects do. The diff erence is that you can double-click the fi lter to reaccess the fi lter dialog box to 
make changes.
You can also access and modify the fi lter’s Blending Options. However, unlike the Layers Style dialog box, 
the Blending Options for a Smart Filter are limited to opacity and blend mode. There are no Blend If options 
available. Figure 5-52 shows accessing the Blending Options dialog box for the Smart Filter.
The Smart Filter has a built-in layer mask that allows localized layer mask opacity controls. You can disable or 
delete the layer mask by using the context menu. Figure 5-53 shows using a layer mask and modifying the 
Filter Mask Display options. As we stated, you can apply a Smart Filter to any Smart Object and can convert 
pixel layers to Smart Objects, so just about any layer can have Smart Filters applied.

Smart Filters continued
Figure 5-54 shows the process of converting a regular layer to a Smart Object 
layer so you can apply a Smart Filter. 
As we said, it takes a pretty 
smart person to use this feature. 
While it does have its uses (we 
have used Smart Filters a time 
or two), for the most part it’s a 
feature in search of a problem 
to solve. And if you are at all 
concerned about fi le sizes, add-
ing Smart Filters won’t help you 
there. The fi le size for the fi nal 
Smart Object example when 
including two Smart Filters grew 
from over 250 MB to just over 
500 MB. By our calculations 
that’s over 425 MB of “Smart” 
(too smart for us).

CREATIVE SHARPENING IN
PHOTOSHOP
Creative sharpening is the catch-all term for localized adjustments to image 
detail. We include blurring and a few additional techniques as well as sharp-
ening. Unlike the optimizations for capture and output processes, creative 
adjustments can’t be applied automatically based on speciﬁ c parameters—
they require creative judgment, hence the name.
But automation plays an important role in making many of the tools we use 
for creative sharpening. The only part of the process that can’t be automated 
is the actual localizing of an effect to a speciﬁ c area of an image. So in this 
section we’ll discuss building creative sharpening (and blurring) tools and 
applying them effectively to images in Photoshop. The ﬁ rst valuable lesson 
to learn is that you can turn any adjustment into a brush!

CREATIVE SHARPENING IN PHOTOSHOP
245
You can turn any adjustment into a brush using three simple steps:
• 
Make the adjustment on a separate layer—usually you’ll create the layer 
using Option-Merge Visible, then apply the adjustment globally to the 
entire layer.
• 
Add a layer mask set to Hide All—that is, solid black. The easiest way 
to do this is to Option-click the “Add layer mask” button in the Layers 
palette. This hides the effect.
• 
Select the brush tool with the desired size, hardness, and opacity, and 
paint with white on the layer mask to reveal the effect.
This deceptively simple technique offers very precise control over localized 
sharpening. As long as the layer has a layer mask, you can paint the effect in 
or out depending on the color you paint onto the mask. You can start with 
an all-white or all-black mask, which we’ll show you next.
Choosing the Type of Mask 
Figure 5-55 shows an image that has a Midtone Contrast effects layer 
created as the top layer. To localize the effect, we’ll add a layer mask. The 
question is whether to add a “reveal all” mask or a “hide all” mask, as shown 
in Figure 5-56.
Figure 5-55 
Adding a layer mask
Image with Midtone Contrast layer
Layers panel showing Add layer 
mask button

CHAPTER 5: INDUSTRIAL-STRENGTH SHARPENING TECHNIQUES
246
Whether you add a hide all or reveal all mask is really dependent on how 
you want to get to where you want to end up. Either mask can produce the 
same results once you’re done editing the ﬁ nal mask. The real question is 
which approach will get you to your ﬁ nal result the quickest. If the effect 
you want to add needs a gentle addition and will be kept in relatively smaller 
localized areas, we suggest creating a hide all mask. This allows a slow 
build-up of the effect by addition rather than subtraction. Figure 5-57 shows 
the addition of the effect by painting white gently into the hide all mask.
One word of caution when painting into layer masks: Make very sure you 
have actually targeted the layer mask and not the pixel layer before starting to 
paint. We can’t tell how many times we’ve failed to make sure and ended up 
painting into the pixels instead of the mask. Since Photoshop can’t know in 
advance what your true intentions are, it’s really up to you to make sure you 
do the right thing. Figure 5-58 shows using the other alternative approach 
of painting out an effect.

Sharpening Brush Techniques 
You don’t have to do everything with the brush, though it’s often easiest. 
The goal of brushing is to localize the effect and to obtain the desired rela-
tive strength of the effect within the brushed area. In addition to black and 
white brush strokes, you have two other important controls over the effect:
• 
You can increase or reduce the layer opacity as a master control over the 
strength of the effect.
• 
You can make tonal edits to the layer mask using Levels or Curves to 
adjust the way the effect is applied locally.
As you work the mask, regardless of what ﬂ avor you started with, you can 
toggle back and forth between white or black (the foreground and back-
ground colors) by pressing the X key. 
We tend to paint on masks with a rather low opacity or ﬂ ow. You are not 
restricted to using only a paintbrush to modify the layer mask; you can use 
any selection tool and ﬁ ll with black or white. You can also run ﬁ lters over 
the layer mask such as a Gaussian Blur to soften the mask.
Most of the techniques we’ll be covering in this section are designed to be 
used locally and often in very low doses, as some are “industrial strength.” 
Use these techniques with a degree of subtlety.

Depth-of-Field Brush
You can’t really counteract insufﬁ cient depth of ﬁ eld (DOF) any more than 
you can make out-of-focus elements in focus. But you can produce a rea-
sonable illusion by using the following technique, which combines Unsharp 
Mask and Overlay/High Pass sharpening (discussed in Chapter 4).
We start the process by making a sharpening layer set to Overlay blend with 
a 50% opacity and the Blend If options set to roll off highlights and shadow. 
We’ll run an Unsharp Mask at an Amount of 200% and a Radius of 2.5 fol-
lowed by a High Pass ﬁ lter at a radius of 30 pixels.
Figure 5-59 shows the creation of the sharpening layer, the application of 
the ﬁ lters, and the addition of a layer mask set to hide all. The last ﬁ gure 
shows the ﬁ nal painted layer mask.

The effect is something between conventional sharpening and a midtone 
contrast boost. It’s often quite difﬁ cult to see the effect while you’re painting 
it in, but turning the layer on and off makes it quite obvious. This doesn’t 
take the place of proper focusing but, in a pinch, can increase the apparent 
sharpness of areas within an image. Figure 5-60 shows the before and after 
with detail crops.

Haze-Cutting Brush
The haze-cutting brush is a variant of the depth-of-ﬁ eld brush that’s useful 
for bringing distant elements in landscapes closer. It uses the same tech-
niques as the DOF brush, but incorporates a cooling step after creating the 
sharpening layer. While we used the same numbers for the Unsharp Mask 
and High Pass ﬁ lters in this example as we did in the previous example, feel 
free to play with different amounts and different blends. This is, after all, a 
creative process. Once you get a formula you like, create an action so you 
can achieve the same effects repeatedly. We’ll cover creating actions in the 
next chapter.
Figure 5-61 shows the addition of a sharpening layer and layer mask to con-
centrate the effect to the horizon to alleviate the aerial haze in downtown 
San Francisco. After the sharpening we created a Color Fill layer set to a 
Color blend mode and opacity of 33%. The exact opacity will vary, since the 
amount of color needed to kill a colorcast will vary. The main idea to grasp 
is to select a color that is the opposite color of the haze.

251
Creating a Clipping Mask 
Once you’ve added the Color Fill layer, you’ll see that the color goes over 
the entire image. We want to localize the cooling color just to the areas 
where we painted in the layer mask. To accomplish this, we’ll create a 
Clipping Mask so the Color Fill layer will be applied only in the areas where 
we painted in white on the sharpening layer’s mask. In this way, the one 
layer mask controls both layers’ local opacities. It’s a useful two-for-one deal 
and allows for adding or subtracting both effects at the same time. You’ll 
note, however, that the Color Fill layer retains its own discrete layer mask in 
the event you need to edit the local opacity of just the Color Fill layer. 
Figure 5-62 shows selecting the Layer > Create Clipping Mask command 
as well as the resulting layer stack with the Color Fill layer clipped to the 
Haze Cutting layer mask.
The ﬁ nal result both clears the warm smog haze from the skyline and pops 
out the detail of the distant buildings. Figure 5-63 shows the results of 
applying the haze-cutting effect.

Effects Layers
The previous examples of creative sharpening relied primarily upon hand 
brushing the effects in or out. Now we’re going to switch direction and 
deal with blurring layers instead of sharpening, and concentrate on differ-
ent approaches to localize the results. Layer masks will still be involved, 
but sometimes you need a more precise application instead of freehand 
brush strokes.

Lens Blur Layer
We’ve often stated that sometimes the best way to make something look 
sharper is to soften everything else in the image. The Lens Blur ﬁ lter is a 
perfect tool for this. Gaussian Blur works ﬁ ne for mechanical blurs, but if 
you want the blur effect to look photographic, Lens Blur looks far more 
authentic. Figure 5-64 shows the image we’ll be working on in this exam-
ple, before any sharpening.
This image of an old automobile was actually shot in Ushuaia, Argentina 
(even though it looks like it could be Colorado). The intent was to isolate 
the car from the background. While it was shot at 70mm wide open at F4, 
the foreground and background intrude.
To make the car stand out, we duplicated the Background layer and created 
a path outline of the car. The hard outline was then softened by creating a 
selection from the path with a 2-pixel feather and saved as a channel. The 
channel was further modiﬁ ed so that the resulting blur would better blend 
into the foreground and background. The next step was to turn the channel 
into a layer mask on the Lens Blur layer. Figure 5-65 shows the path, the 
channel, and the resulting layer mask.

example image, before

CHAPTER 5: INDUSTRIAL-STRENGTH SHARPENING TECHNIQUES
254
The key to using the ﬁ lter to increase the apparent lens bokeh (the out-of-
focus areas) is to select the Layer Mask option in the Lens Blur Depth Map.
To be accurate, we could have used a channel instead of a layer mask as the 
source for the Depth Map option. However, we ﬁ nd it easier to visualize 
what the ﬁ nal result will be when we use the layer mask as a guide to what 
will and won’t be blurred. Figure 5-66 shows the technique we use of tem-
porarily inverting the layer mask to aid in determining the visible area 
needed in the layer mask.

Once the layer mask is in place, we apply the Lens Blur ﬁ lter to the layer. 
Figure 5-67 shows the Lens Blur ﬁ lter dialog box and the Depth Map 
option selected.
The ﬁ nal result is shown in Figure 5-68. If you compare Figure 5-68 with 
the before image in Figure 5-64, we think you’ll see that the car itself has 
increased in apparent sharpness. We haven’t done anything to the sharpness 
of the car except make everything else appear less sharp. Pretty sneaky, huh?

Box Blur Filter
The Lens Blur ﬁ lter can do a convincing imitation of lens bokeh, but it can 
be very slow. We often use an alternative  ﬁ lter when we don’t need to apply 
Lens Blur’s special options. Our alternative is the Box Blur ﬁ lter. The algo-
rithm for Box Blur is very similar to Lens Blur in that it uses a shape to 
modify the blurring. Where Lens Blur uses multi-sided shapes (as in a lens 
aperture), Box Blur uses a simple square box.
Progressive Sharpening Layer
We could use the depth-of-ﬁ eld effect in an attempt to recover a certain 
degree of focus, but the effect is limited. The concept in this next example is 
to build up sharpening step-by-step; each new step will use the previous 
step’s result and apply increasing degrees and levels of sharpening. Be 
warned, however: Any areas of your image that are already sharp will prob-
ably break and result in being substantially oversharpened. 
Figure 5-69 shows the full frame of the image we’ll be using in this example 
as well as the sharpening layer set to Luminosity blend mode. At this point, 
the opacity is left at 100% to be able to judge the effects as they build up.

NOTE: While we’ll show you the progression that we used for this image, note that all 
of this process is subject to modifi cation and adaptation based on the demands of 
your image. You should remain fl exible and be willing to try variations upon this basic 
theme. 
Figure 5-70 shows the Unsharp Mask ﬁ lter dialog box for the ﬁ rst sharpen-
ing round. Immediately after the application at full strength, we selected 
Fade Unsharp Mask and reduced the opacity to 20%. This resulted in a 
substantial reduction in the strength from the 500% and Radius .3 of the 
ﬁ rst ﬁ lter application.
At this point we barely scratched the surface, so to speak. To build up the 
effect, we kept applying additional Unsharp Mask applications at gradually 
reducing amounts and increasing radii. The following applications were used:
1. Amount 500%, Radius .3, faded to 20% opacity (the ﬁ rst step shown)
2. Amount 300%, Radius .6, faded to 20% opacity
3. Amount 200%, Radius 1.0, faded to 20% opacity
4. Amount 100%, Radius 5.0, faded to 20% opacity
5. Amount 50%, Radius 10, faded to 20% opacity
6. Amount 25%, Radius 25, faded to 20% opacity

As you might expect, the buildup of sharpening can be substantial. Each 
subsequent step builds on the previous step, producing an end result you 
can’t duplicate with any single application of the ﬁ lter. 
Figure 5-71 shows a 100% zoom view of the image before and after the 
complete sequence of applications.
We warned you, right? At the full 100% opacity, you really wouldn’t want 
your image to look like this. Reducing the opacity of the sharpening layer 
and adding a layer mask to get rid of the vastly oversharpened areas, how-
ever, produces a very useful result, as shown in Figure 5-72.

Remedy for Oversharpening
Since we’ve shown how to oversharpen your images, we thought it was only fair to also show you how to 
address oversharpening when it occurs. As with any remedy, the ideal is to not need it in the fi rst place! But if 
you are handed an oversharpened and brittle mess, there are a couple things that will help mitigate the disaster. 
Figure 5-73 shows the full frame of the example image as well as a 100% zoom view.
There’s no Un-Unsharp Mask fi lter, but there is a Gaussian Blur fi lter. We created a blur layer at 100% opacity set 
to a Darken blend mode, which will apply the .2-radius Gaussian Blur to darken the lighter areas. We applied 
the .2-radius fi ve times in a row—no fade, just ran it fi ve times. Figure 5-74 shows the result of fi ve applications.

Remedy for Oversharpening continued
The blurring set to Darken has reduced the amount of overlightening of the 
high-frequency texture that has occurred as a result of the oversharpening. It’s 
not a perfect fi x, but it does help restore a better tonal balance to the texture. 
To go further will require handwork up close. Figure 5-75 shows working up 
close with the Clone Stamp tool set to a Darken blend mode. The cloning is 
reducing the white halo between the sky and the shoes.
The next two examples aren’t strictly sharpening nor blur layers, but they 
are effects layers that will impact the detail in your images.
Image Sculpting
This technique was taught to us by R. Mac Holbert (the R stands for Roy) 
of Nash Editions, where he has deployed this on thousands of images (often 
without his clients even knowing it). It’s an extension of the basic concept of 
midtone contrast, but rather than using the image to modify itself, it’s up to 
the user to paint in the midtone contrast effect. 
We’re going to break form here a bit and show the before, middle, and ﬁ nal 
results up front. Then we’ll show you how we did it. Figure 5-76 shows the 
example image. This image was a three-image stitch done in Photoshop CS4.

262
We added a Reduce Noise layer with surface mask as well as a sharpening 
layer with edge mask. Since we did the stitch in Photoshop, we couldn’t do 
our normal sharpening in Camera Raw because the sharpening might get 
altered or distorted by the stitching process. We also added a Midtone 
Contrast layer with a 75-pixel High Pass ﬁ lter set to 25% opacity. We used 
the Blend If slider to concentrate the effect on the midtones. Once we 
reached this stage, we added a new layer ﬁ lled with 50% gray also set to 
Overlay blend mode. The opacity was 66%, and we rolled off the highlights 
and shadows with the Blend If sliders. Figure 5-77 shows these steps.

Sculpting layer

263
At this point, we painted in with white to lighten and black to darken 
speciﬁ c areas of the image. Some of the work was done with a selection 
outlining the iceberg, and a lot of the work was done by hand. We also 
used a Color Range selection for a portion of the tone work. 
Figure 5-78 shows preliminary painting through a selection, close-in 
freehand detail, and the ﬁ nal Sculpting layer.

CHAPTER 5: INDUSTRIAL-STRENGTH SHARPENING TECHNIQUES
264
If you ﬂ ip back and forth between Figures 5-76 and 5-78, you can see the 
areas where we lightened and darkened to bring out the contrast in the 
image. Since this is an interactive process—meaning, you can toggle the 
foreground and background color to change the effect you’re painting 
with—this is a process that can’t easily be duplicated with traditional tone 
adjustments alone. We freely admit this isn’t so much a sharpening tech-
nique as it is an image-enhancement technique, but it does achieve more 
enhancement than a simple Midtone Contrast layer ever could.
The next example is also a departure in that instead of sharpening or blur-
ring the image, we’ll actually endeavor to add grain for effect.
Adding Film Grain
It may seem counterintuitive, but sometimes adding grain will actually help 
a digital image look a lot less digital. Extensive noise reduction or sharpen-
ing and adding blur effects will often make an image look smeared or 
impressionistic. Retouching can also tend to leave telltale signs of manipula-
tion. Since we work in high bit depth (approximately 16-bit/channel in Pro 
Photo RGB), we rarely ever face posterization or banding, but this technique 
will also help mitigate that.
For this example, we’re going to use an image that has had some Box Blur 
effects applied, which tend to overly soften the image detail. Figure 5-79 
shows the full-frame image and the Layers panel with the Grain layer added 
at a 66% luminosity blend.
The process will attempt to replicate the natural grain found in ﬁ lm scans. 
If you remember the discussion about scanner noise in Chapter 2, the Blue 
channel always had the most noise and the Red channel the least. This 
process applies an unequal amount of noise across the three channels and 
then tops it off with a small dose of Gaussian Blur to soften the noise that 
Photoshop produces. Figure 5-80 shows targeting the Green channel, adding 
noise, and then adding blur.

CREATIVE SHARPENING IN PHOTOSHOP
265
Then we repeated the exact same process with the Blue and Red channels, 
but slightly changed the amounts; the Blue noise amount was 10% and the 
Red amount was 6%. The same .3 Gaussian Blur was used. Figure 5-81 
shows the before and after.

CHAPTER 5: INDUSTRIAL-STRENGTH SHARPENING TECHNIQUES
266
We will admit that the effect of the added ﬁ lm grain is very subtle. While 
we’ve zoomed into 200% to have the grain appear in the book, it’s very 
unlikely you could ever see the grain with any sort of downsampling. As 
we’ve discovered, downsampling is a great noise terminator. But if you need 
to upsample or are going to reproduce an image near its maximum size for 
the ﬁ le’s resolution, then adding a touch of ﬁ lm grain at the end will give 
digital ﬁ les a more realistic “tooth” or texture. And, hey, unlike real noise, 
all you need to do to get rid of it is turn off the layer.

CREATIVE SHARPENING IN CAMERA
R AW AND LIGHTROOM
We would love to be able to write as lengthy of a volume on creative sharp-
ening in Camera Raw and Lightroom as the earlier section on creative 
sharpening in Photoshop, but, alas, the Sharpening slider in the Adjustment 
Brush of Camera Raw and Lightroom is a bit lacking. Well, a lot lacking—
which we hope will change along with the other major modiﬁ cations 
expected with new versions. But there is one local control you can use with 
the Adjustment Brush in both Camera Raw and Lightroom that is worth 
using and is very difﬁ cult to do in Photoshop: negative Clarity.
Clarity produces an increase in the midtone contrast in an image. We can 
readily duplicate this effect in Photoshop with our local area contrast effect 
with Unsharp Mask or using Overlay/High Pass ﬁ lter on a layer. But doing 
negative Clarity in Photoshop isn’t so easy. You can accomplish a similar sort 
of contrast reduction by using a Shadows/Highlights adjustment in Photoshop, 
but the usability of that tool doesn’t lend itself to painted-in effects. 
We’re going to presume that you are familiar with the basic functionality of 
the Adjustment Brush in Camera Raw 5.x and/or Lightroom 2.x. Figure 5-82 
shows both Camera Raw and Lightroom with the Adjustment Brush tool 
selected. You’ll see a face there in dire need of some attention. Rather than 
abuse an attractive model, we decided to use Jeff’s face. He was cheaper, 
as well.

We ﬁ nd constantly twiddling with the sliders a bit annoying, so we suggest 
you do as we do and save any commonly used combination of local adjust-
ment settings as Local Correction Settings. You can select the same saved 
settings from either the Adjustment Brush or the Gradation Filter in both 
Camera Raw and Lightroom, though note that the settings don’t inter-
change between Camera Raw and Lightroom (which we think would be a 
useful capability). Figure 5-83 shows saving a Local Correction Setting in 
Camera Raw.
When you save the setting, it shows up not only in the Adjustment Brush 
but also in the Graduated Filter panel. Figure 5-84 shows the newly saved 
setting in the Graduated Filter ﬂ yout menu.

Lightroom has the same capability to save Local Correction Settings. The 
option is in the Effect drop-down menu, as shown in Figure 5-85.
As far as the actual effect, you simply paint it in as you would any other 
local adjustment in Camera Raw or Lightroom. If a single application isn’t 
enough, you can create an additional pin (adjustment set) and keep adding 
to the effect. Though as with any local adjustment, one can go too far. 
Figure 5-86 shows the before and after on Jeff’s face.
It might be said Jeff went a bit too far on his own face, but it’s his preroga-
tive to do so. Our thanks (and apologies) to Martin Evening for the use of 
his portrait of Jeff.

As far as additional local smoothing or sharpening in Camera Raw and 
Lightroom, we seriously suggest deferring any substantial local adjustments 
of those sorts to Photoshop. The current toolset is too limited and Photoshop 
is too powerful to be ﬂ ailing away in Camera Raw or Lightroom. Since 
Camera Raw is actually designed to open raw ﬁ les in Photoshop, that’s not 
much of a deferral. In the case of Lightroom, however, that limitation does 
require roundtripping an image from Lightroom to Photoshop and back—
which just happens to be the last topic in the creative sharpening discussion.
Lightroom to Photoshop to Lightroom for 
Creative Sharpening (and Other Things)
While there is an advantage to keeping many of the edits to your images as 
parametric metadata-based edits, sooner or later you are going to need real 
pixel editing. Lightroom can send your raw image to Photoshop for pixel-
based editing. When you save the ﬁ le, it automatically imports that edited 
image back into the Lightroom catalog. You can even have Lightroom take 
the original image and the rendered pixel image stacked together. 
Most people who use Lightroom are probably quite familiar with the pro-
cess of going from Lightroom to Photoshop and back, but we wanted an 
excuse to put a photograph of Max the Perfect Dog into the book (Max was 
the Schewe family dog who, alas, is no longer with us). Figure 5-87 shows a 
raw capture of Max in the Develop module of Lightroom. You can use key-
board commands, Command-E (Mac) or Control-E (Windows), to open 
the image in Photoshop or use the Photo > Edit In > Edit in Adobe 
Photoshop CS4 menu command as shown.
Lightroom sends the image to Photoshop based on the preferences you’ve 
set in Lightroom. Lightroom 2 and Photoshop CS4 communicate using 
BridgeTalk, a scripting language for use between various Creative Suite 
applications. If you are using an earlier version of Photoshop or another 
application, the directions and preferences will differ. Figure 5-88 shows 
the Lightroom Preferences dialog box for External Editing.
We set up Lightroom to use the TIFF ﬁ le format in ProPhoto RGB and 16 
bits without compression. The Resolution setting is simply a metadata tag 
and won’t alter the pixel density of the image. You can change this at any 
time in Photoshop, or later when printing or exporting from Lightroom. 

CREATIVE SHARPENING IN CAMERA RAW AND LIGHTROOM
271
Photoshop opens the image ﬁ le, and then you can do whatever you need. In 
this example, we threw in a bunch of the creative sharpening techniques 
we’ve previously discussed, including sculpting, progressive sharpening, box 
blur, midtone contrast, and adding a grain layer.

NOTE: TIFF vs. PSD fi les? Just as Bruce and Jeff  advocate for a nonproprietary raw fi le 
format such as Adobe’s DNG, they also feel strongly about using a nonproprietary 
rendered fi le format as well. The TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) fi le type was originally 
created by a consortium of companies including Aldus, the primary developer, as well as 
Kodak and Microsoft. Adobe inherited the copyright ownership to TIFF in its purchase of 
Aldus in 1994. While many people presume the Photoshop PSD fi le format is a native of 
Photoshop, it ceased being the native fi le format when the Creative Suite was introduced. 
With the exception of certain Creative Suite functionality, everything you can do with a PSD 
fi le, you can also do with a TIFF fi le. However, TIFF is a publicly documented fi le format while 
the PSD format is not. For this reason, Bruce and Jeff  have adopted using primarily TIFF fi les 
in their archives of rendered image fi les.
Figure 5-89 shows the image of Max open in Photoshop with the ﬁ nal 
layer stack.
While we try to do as much as we can in parametric edits to metadata, we’ve 
found that some work in Camera Raw and Lightroom is incredibly difﬁ cult 
and tedious but very simple and fast in Photoshop. Spot healing is great on a 
raw ﬁ le but doesn’t hold a candle to the regular Healing Brush in Photoshop 
for retouching. In this situation, we wanted to get the image of Max further 
enhanced than we could possibly do in Lightroom, but we wanted the 
image back in Lightroom for printing and for other purposes. 
Figure 5-90 shows the saved TIFF image back in Lightroom. The ﬁ gure 
also shows the command to edit the TIFF ﬁ le back in Photoshop.

Back in Lightroom, you can always choose to reedit the rendered pixel ﬁ le. 
As long as you saved out the TIFF ﬁ le with all the layers, channels, and 
paths from Photoshop, you can always get back to those layers for further 
edits. The major caveat is you must use the Edit Original option and forgo 
any subsequent tone and color corrections from within Lightroom. You can 
choose to edit a copy, but this will spawn off yet another rendered ﬁ le, 
which is what we are trying to avoid.
Creative Sharpening Rules
Very few rules apply to creative sharpening, which in part is why we call it creative sharpening! The big ones are:
• Always perform creative sharpening or smoothing at the image’s native resolution. Remember, the goal is 
to create a use-neutral master image that you can repurpose through diff erent kinds of output sharpening 
at diff erent sizes.
• Don’t overdo things. While judging fi nal sharpness from the computer display is quite unreliable, if things 
look overdone at the creative phase, it’s likely that they’ll look that way in the fi nal output too.
Ultimately, control of detail is just as important a creative function as control of tone or color, even if it tends to 
get much less attention. So absorb these techniques and let your creativity fl ow!

274
OUTPUT SHARPENING IN
PHOTOSHOP
Where optimizing for capture and creative sharpening require human skill, 
sharpening for output is essentially a deterministic process, since any given 
print process always turns pixels into marks on paper the same way, no mat-
ter the input. Creativity at this stage is not only unnecessary, but should be 
actively discouraged.
In the previous workﬂ ow phases, we tried to avoid obvious sharpening 
haloes. When we sharpen for print, haloes are not only desirable, but neces-
sary. The trick is to keep them small enough that they don’t appear as dis-
crete features on the print when viewed at reasonable viewing distances.
The rule of thumb that has served Bruce well is to keep the sharpening 
haloes no smaller than 1/100th of an inch and no larger than 1/50th of an 
inch, with the smaller number being preferred for small (up to 11” x 14”) 
prints, dropping to the larger number as dictated by the resolution of the 
image and the size of the print.
The ﬁ rst and most important rule in output sharpening is that it must be 
done at the ﬁ nal output resolution, after any required resampling. There are 
no exceptions to this rule.
Do the Math
With the goal of the sharpening haloes in mind, remember that all you can do 
is sharpen the pixels themselves. The amount of sharpening required is a func-
tion of the size of the pixels, which in turn is a function of the resolution you’re 
sending to the output process.
For example, this book is printed using a 150-lines-per-inch (lpi) screen, and 
most of the images are printed at 300 pixels per inch (ppi). Simple arithmetic 
dictates that a halo of 1/100th of an inch is 3 pixels wide, so that was the goal 
when we sharpened images for this print process.
For larger prints at lower resolutions, the same-sized halo will obviously have 
smaller pixel dimensions. At 180 ppi, which we regard as the lower limit for 
inkjet printing, a 1/100th-inch halo is 1.8 pixels wide, and a 1/50th-inch halo is 
3.6 pixels wide, so again a 3-pixel halo is a reasonable aim point.

OUTPUT SHARPENING IN PHOTOSHOP
275
For halftone sharpening, we use plain old Unsharp Mask on a layer set to 
Luminosity blending at 66% opacity. In practice, it’s rare that we’ll adjust the 
layer opacity of the output sharpening layer, but it’s always nice to know that 
we can! 
We set the Blend If sliders to the values shown in Figure 5-91. There’s really 
no point in applying sharpening to pixels lighter than level 250 (which in 
halftone terms is a 1% dot), and feathering off the sharpening in the deep 
shadows below level 10 (which is a 99% dot).
Halftone Sharpening
The very simple sharpening shown in Figure 5-91 works very well for 
300-ppi, 150-lpi halftone printing on coated paper. For uncoated papers, 
we increase the Amount setting in Unsharp Mask to 158. Bruce arrived at 
these numbers empirically, which is to say, by trial and error, but they have 
now been through extensive testing on tens of thousands of images, and 
we stand by them.
Figure 5-92 shows an image before and after output sharpening for this 
book’s halftone process. For lower screen frequencies, use a smaller Radius 
value and a higher Amount; for higher screen frequencies, use a larger 
Radius and a lower Amount, always with the goal of keeping the sharpening 
haloes around 1/100th of an inch.

CHAPTER 5: INDUSTRIAL-STRENGTH SHARPENING TECHNIQUES
276
Inkjet Sharpening 
Inkjet printers use error-diffusion screening rather than halftone dots, 
which produces a rather different effect that in turn requires a rather differ-
ent type of sharpening. You can use the same Blend If settings in the Layer 
Style dialog box as for halftone sharpening, but we use a combination of 
Unsharp Mask and Overlay/High Pass sharpening.
For a 300-ppi inkjet print on glossy or semigloss paper, we create the sharp-
ening layer but leave it with Normal blending for the Unsharp Mask step, 
which is Unsharp Mask with Amount 320, Radius 0.6, and Threshold 4. 
Then we immediately choose Edit > Fade with 70% opacity and Luminosity 
blend mode. Next set the layer to Overlay blending with an opacity of 50% 
and run the High Pass ﬁ lter with a Radius of 2 pixels.

a 1.5-pixel light contour and a 
1.5-pixel dark contour, for a total

OUTPUT SHARPENING IN PHOTOSHOP
277
Obviously we can’t show you inkjet screening in this book. The results of 
the inkjet sharpening are very similar in pixel terms to those of the halftone 
output sharpening, but the haloes are just slightly more intense (even 
though they’re the same size as for halftone sharpening). The tighter dither 
of the inkjet screen can render the contrast a bit more precisely than halftone 
output can, so the higher contrast is effective. 
Figure 5-93 shows a detail from the image in Figure 5-92, comparing 
halftone sharpening and inkjet sharpening. 
Continuous-Tone Sharpening 
For continuous-tone printers such as the Durst Lambda or the Fuji Frontier, 
we use the same sharpening technique as for inkjet, but with slightly 
different values (which again were the product of much trial and error). 
For 300-ppi output, use Unsharp Mask with Amount 350, Radius 0.6, and 
Threshold 4, faded to 70% opacity with Luminosity blend mode, then set 
the layer to Overlay at 50% opacity and run the High Pass ﬁ lter with a 
Radius of 1.5 pixels.

CHAPTER 5: INDUSTRIAL-STRENGTH SHARPENING TECHNIQUES
278
For lower resolutions, use smaller Radius settings and higher Amount set-
tings; for higher resolutions, use larger Radius settings and lower Amount 
settings, always keeping in mind the ﬁ nal size of the sharpening haloes.
Sharpening for Computer Display 
It may seem obvious, but we suppose we need to say it anyway: When 
sharpening for output that is intended to be seen on a display or video 
screen, it’s a very good idea to sharpen it to look good on that ﬁ nal screen. 
How you do that, however, is not so obvious or straightforward. Assuming 
you are starting with rather high-resolution images, simply downsampling 
using Photoshop’s Image Size tool, shown in Figure 5-94, will certainly get 
your images smaller, but perhaps at a cost of detail. 
Taking an image from 3252 x 2023 pixels to 500 x 311 pixels means that a 
whole bunch of image pixels need to just go away in the interpolation. 
Which pixels go and which stay is up to the algorithm, and you have very 
little control over the results other than choosing the downsampling algo-
rithm in the Image Size dialog box. Generally, going down in size means 
using Bicubic Sharper, while upsampling uses Bicubic Smoother; plain old 
Bicubic is sort of the middle ground. However, if you do the downsampling 
in one big jump, you’re stuck with just the one algorithm, which is one of 
the reasons we suggest downsampling in steps. Figure 5-95 shows an alter-
native downsampling approach.
Figure 5-94 Photoshop’s 
Image Size dialog box

OUTPUT SHARPENING IN PHOTOSHOP
279
We don’t suggest using multiple steps of Bicubic Sharper; the results would 
be way oversharpened. Using the two downsampling steps using Bicubic 
plus the last step of Bicubic Sharper has the beneﬁ t of using both algo-
rithms. You end up with the sample number of pixels as you would with a 
single big downsample, but experience has shown us that ﬁ ne texture is 
held better doing it in steps.
Smart Sharpen for Display Sharpening 
While we tend not to use Smart Sharpen for general sharpening tasks, we 
ﬁ nd it an excellent sharpening tool for display purposes. We like to see the 
image in the dialog box at 100% and look at the image preview at 200% to 
judge what is happening to the pixels. Figure 5-96 shows the settings we 
used for this image.
You’ll see that the amounts of sharpening we’ve done is rather slight. On 
top of that, we used the Fade command to set the blend to Luminosity and 
faded to 75%. Since this was a disposable image intended for the Web, we 
didn’t bother creating a separate sharpening layer. The sharpening halo, 
with Smart Sharpen set to a 0.6 radius, is just over 1 pixel. Depending on 
the edge frequency in the image, you can tweak this up or down a few frac-
tions, because while other output sharpening is not edge-width-dependent, 
sharpening for display is.

Figure 5-97 shows a comparison of three approaches to the downsampling 
and sharpening. We’ll warn you that here in halftone, it’s not as easy to see 
what we see on our display. We’ve presented these images at a screen zoom 
of 300% to show the relatively subtle differences in techniques.

Magic Numbers
The numbers we’ve quoted for the sharpening settings for diff erent output 
processes may seem like voodoo, but they’re the product of exhaustive test-
ing, by both Bruce and Jeff . That said, it’s entirely possible that you can come 
up with numbers that you prefer to ours.
We recommend you take heed of this key piece of advice: The only way to 
evaluate print sharpening is to sharpen the image, make a print, and examine 
it carefully. Looking at image pixels on the screen can give you a gross pic-
ture of the size of the sharpening haloes, but subtle diff erences like the ones 
shown in Figure 5-93 can be evaluated only in the print itself.
OUTPUT SHARPENING IN
CAMERA R AW
As we indicated in Chapter 3, we don’t think output sharpening for Camera 
Raw is quite ﬁ nished. Yes, you can set your images to a speciﬁ c megapixel 
size and use the batch save function to quickly process a lot of images for 
both capture and output sharpening, but only if you pull out your calculator. 
Since output sharpening must be applied only at the ﬁ nal output size and 
pixel density, you’ll need to do some ﬁ guring to do it in the current version 
of Camera Raw. 
Figure 5-98 shows setting up Camera Raw’s Workﬂ ow Options for the pixel 
size of the processed image.

CHAPTER 5: INDUSTRIAL-STRENGTH SHARPENING TECHNIQUES
282
As you see in Figure 5-98, you can select only from a ﬁ xed set of interpola-
tion sizes and are limited to specifying the pixels per inch. You have no 
direct control over image dimensions—which, if you are outputting for 
print, is rather important. So, we weren’t kidding when we said to keep a 
calculator handy, because unless you can do the math in your head, you’ll 
need it to ﬁ gure out print sizes. Figure 5-99 shows how to determine the 
ﬁ nal print size.
If you want your 3504-pixels-wide raw image processed out for a 12” print 
width, you need to enter 292 as the resolution—not the sort of elegant solu-
tion to output sharpening we would like to see from Camera Raw. If you 
can properly set up Camera Raw’s resolution to achieve your desired print 
size, Camera Raw is capable of optimal output sharpening. 
Figure 5-100 shows Camera Raw’s output sharpening drop-down menu 
options. Note that normally you wouldn’t see both drop downs; this was 
done to save space.

We have a high degree of conﬁ dence (and a bit of inside information) 
that the current usability limitations won’t last long. It’s our expectation 
that future versions of Camera Raw will address this limitation, and that 
image sizing and output sharpening in Camera Raw will be equal to that 
in Lightroom.
OUTPUT SHARPENING IN
LIGHTROOM
We kept the best for last. As you know, Bruce, Jeff, and the other members 
of PixelGenius (PG) are rather proud of the output sharpening found in 
Lightroom. While Bruce never actually got to use it, he knew it was going 
to happen. Bruce was incredibly proud that Adobe (and the Camera Raw/
Lightroom team members) had wanted to use PhotoKit Sharpener’s inkjet 
output sharpening right in Lightroom. We (Bruce, Jeff, and PG) would 
like to particularly thank Thomas Knoll for being so persistent and making 
it happen.
Truth be told, Jeff really no longer does output sharpening in Photoshop for 
anything except images intended for halftone reproduction. Lightroom deals 
only with inkjet/contone sharpening and sharpening for the screen. In this 
section, we’ll primarily discuss output sharpening in the Lightroom Print 
module, as that’s where Jeff does the majority of his output sharpening.
Output Sharpening in the Print Module
One of the highly desirable aspects of output sharpening in the Lightroom 
Print module is that it happens on the ﬂ y. Since Lightroom sets the image 
dimension based on the print cell size, you don’t need to make different 
sized images for different sized prints. Believe us, that is a really big thing. 
As long as the native resolution of the image is between 180 and 480 ppi, 
Lightroom will resize without resampling and then sharpen the print as it 
sends the image to the printer. The only thing you need to worry about is 
properly setting the media type (and the sharpening strength). 

CHAPTER 5: INDUSTRIAL-STRENGTH SHARPENING TECHNIQUES
284
Figure 5-101 shows the main Print module interface as well as details of the 
Guides options and the image size and output resolution readouts that 
appear on the print preview.
Determining the Size and Resolution 
Lightroom does not have (nor does it need) a 
function for actually changing the size and res-
olution of the original ﬁ le, only the print or an 
export. However, when printing, it’s useful and sometimes important to 
know the exact size that a speciﬁ c image will print and the native resolution 
of the image at that size. In the Guides panel, if you select the Dimensions 
option, the actual dimensions will appear in the upper-left corner of the print 
preview. If you don’t select the Print Resolution checkbox (force an interpo-
lation), the readout also shows the image resolution. This image would print 
at 12” x 18” at 216 ppi as the readout shown in Figure 5-101 shows. This is in 
the range of the suggested 180- to 480-ppi resolutions for printing to inkjet.

Figure 5-102 shows the Print Job panel and the output sharpening options.
Print Sharpening Options 
When you have output sharpening active, you’ll have the option to select 
the strength and the media type on which you’ll be printing. There is an 
inside joke at PixelGenius that John Paul Caponigro, a well known ﬁ ne-art 
photographer and print maker, always complained the PhotoKit Sharpener 
was a bit too strong on his output. On the other hand, Mac Holbert (now a 
principal of PixelGenius) always thought it was too weak, while Bruce always 
thought it was just right. So Jeff always thinks of the options in Lightroom 
as Low for JP, High for Mac, and Standard for Bruce. Jeff almost always uses 
Standard. Since the output sharpening is tied to the capture sharpening in 
the Detail panel, you may need to test where your images fall when properly 
capture sharpened.
As for the media type, the primary distinguishing factor for Glossy or Matte 
is whether the paper you are printing on has a strong coating on which the 
ink will sit or it’s at all absorbed into the paper. Watercolor paper absorbs a 
lot of ink and is therefore considered matte. A photo paper that has a sheen 
or a gloss on the surface would, naturally, be glossy. The sharpening differs 
between the two media types in an attempt to achieve the same apparent 
sharpness in the print.

Upsampled Print Output 
In the previous edition of Real World Image Sharpening with Adobe Photoshop 
CS2, Bruce stated that he didn’t see any point in up- or downsampling 
images for print. This is what Bruce wrote in 2006:
Some pundits recommend resampling images to reach print resolution. I cheerfully 
downsample images, particularly for halftone printing where it’s certain that any 
additional resolution beyond 2.5 times the screen frequency will simply be dis-
carded. But I tend to avoid upsampling unless there’s really no choice. I’ve made a 
good many satisfying 20-inch prints from an 8-megapixel camera by sending the 
printer 180 real pixels per inch. I’ve yet to see a beneﬁ t to forcing Photoshop to 
make up more pixels by upsampling.
Fast-forward to mid-2009 and Jeff has some new ideas. While he certainly 
agrees with Bruce that it’s silly to contemplate downsampling your images 
solely for the purpose of hitting some magic number, with the advent of 
Lightroom’s excellent output sharpening, he needed to slightly alter 
Bruce’s position.
With Lightroom 2.3 and above (there was an important “ﬁ x” in Lightroom 
2.3), you can see a beneﬁ t with some images whose edge frequency is high 
when making prints where the ﬁ nal resolution is on the low side of the 
acceptable range. If the ﬁ nal output resolution is below 300 ppi and the 
image has high-frequency image data (or strong high-contrast diagonal 
lines), adding about 50% to the native resolution will produce a better and 
smoother result on most media.
If the image is already at about 300 ppi or above, there really isn’t any bene-
ﬁ t. The primary reason for this is Lightroom has an adaptive upsampling 
routine that combines the Bicubic and Bicubic Smoother algorithms, and 
adaptive upsamples the image prior to output sharpening at the ﬁ nal size 
and resolution. 
Figure 5-103 shows taking our example image and entering 300 ppi. This 
will take the native resolution as reported by Lightroom (see Figure 5-101) 
and upsample to 300 ppi, and then perform the ﬁ nal output sharpening for 
the print. Does it help? For this image, yes it does. Proving it in the scope of 
this book is sort of difﬁ cult, so you’ll have to take our word for some of it 
and use your imagination for the rest of the proof. 
Figure 5-103 
Upsampling the image

OUTPUT SHARPENING IN LIGHTROOM
287
In order to actually “see” Lightroom’s output sharpening applied after the 
adaptive upsample, we needed to use Lightroom’s ability to print to a ﬁ le. 
Figure 5-104 shows taking the native resolution of 150 ppi up to 300 ppi. 
We changed the print dimensions so we would end up with even multipliers 
to aid in making screenshots. The differences between 150 ppi and 219 ppi 
were negligible. The ﬁ nal print dimensions (including the white borders) 
were 24” x 30” at either 150 ppi or 300 ppi after the upsampling.
This is the part you’ll have to trust us on: If you look at both images printed 
out from an Epson Stylus Pro 7900 (Jeff’s printer of choice) on Epson’s 
Exhibition Fiber Paper (EFP), you can see a difference between the 150-ppi 
and the 300-ppi prints. The print at 300 ppi shows less stair-stepping on the

diagonals and better overall high-frequency image area. While we can’t 
show you the prints in the book, and it would be useless to try to scan the 
prints and then reproduce them in halftone, we will make both images 
available for download from the Real World Image Sharpening website at 
www.peachpit.com/RWIS. 
We can give you some hint of what we are seeing by looking at two screen-
shots from the resulting JPEG print ﬁ les. We’ve set the screen zoom to be 
effectively 400%, although that required downsampling the 300 ppi using 
the Nearest Neighbor option in Photoshop’s Image Size command. Why 
the resample? Because the 300-ppi image was literally two times the pixel 
density as the 150-ppi image, the actual screen zooms in Photoshop were 
out of scale. Trust us, this works but you can download the ﬁ les yourselves. 
Figure 5-105 shows the two resolutions.

OUTPUT SHARPENING IN LIGHTROOM
289
What you see in Figure 5-105 is a magniﬁ ed view of what Jeff sees when 
looking at the two prints. The 150-ppi print has the jaggies on the strong 
diagonal lines and a reduction of high-frequency texture compared to the 
300-ppi print.
Does this mean every image should just be resampled to 300 ppi for printing? 
No. You really won’t see much difference on watercolor paper really, just 
glossy media types. You also won’t see much difference for images without 
high-frequency texture. If your images are already over 300 ppi, upsampling 
won’t gain you anything. You also certainly would never want to throw pixels 
away by downsampling unless you have in excess of 480 ppi (the upper 
limit). Lightroom will even make sure you don’t. If you try to enter in more 
than 480 in the Print Resolution ﬁ eld, you’ll get the warning shown in 
Figure 5-106.
Output Sharpening with Export
Lightroom also provides the opportunity for output sharpening when 
exporting. The Lightroom Export dialog box shown in Figure 5-107 shows 
where it’s activated. The fact that Lightroom provides better size and resolu-
tion controls means exporting makes sense from Lightroom while saving 
out of Camera Raw at this point doesn’t. We’ll cover how to use Export for 
batch processing in the next chapter.

THE POWER OF THE WORKFLOW
291
THE POWER OF THE WORKFLOW
The biggest advantage of the sharpening techniques we’ve described in this 
chapter is that images receive optimal sharpening. That in itself is no small 
thing, but an equally signiﬁ cant advantage is that images receive optimal 
use-neutral sharpening, so you can easily repurpose them for different outputs 
and sizes.
Decoupling the image source and image content concerns from the demands 
of the output process makes sense from both a quality and a productivity 
standpoint. It’s conceivable that in the future, savvy printer vendors will 
build optimal output sharpening into commercial software or hardware 
RIPs (raster image processors) and printer drivers so that we can deliver 
images without having to worry about output size and resolution. 
Looking even further forward, it’s at least conceptually possible that display 
proﬁ les could contain sharpness parameters that controlled antialiasing to 
the display, ironing out differences in sharpness the way they do color dif-
ferences today. But in the here and now, it’s fair to say that detail control is 
a subject that has received far less attention than tone and color control. 
In the next, ﬁ nal chapter, we’ll demonstrate how to harness the tools and 
techniques in an efﬁ cient sharpening workﬂ ow that incorporates actions, 
presets, and automated batch processing.

Putting the Tools to Work
Building a Sharpening Workfl ow—Effi  ciently
In the last couple of chapters, we covered a large body of sharpening and 
noise-reduction tools and techniques. In this chapter, we’ll show you how to 
combine them to make a complete but efﬁ cient sharpening workﬂ ow. The 
primary goal of the sharpening workﬂ ow is, of course, optimally sharpened 
images, but other beneﬁ ts accrue too:
• 
Images that have been optimized for source and content become 
“use-neutral” master images that can easily be repurposed for 
multiple outputs.
• 
Much of the workﬂ ow can be automated (the creative localized 
sharpening application cannot). An automated sharpening workﬂ ow 
can help you make hundreds of images good, so that you can reserve 
the manual work for the smaller number that need to be made great.
Regardless of the optimization, the steps involved are often repetitive, 
tedious, and error prone if you aren’t paying close attention. For these rea-
sons (and that, fundamentally, we’re lazy), we try to improve our efﬁ ciency 
through automation. But simply automating without a structure in place 
would be pointless. That’s why we need to know when to sharpen and how 
so we automate the process efﬁ ciently.
293

CHAPTER 6: PUTTING THE TOOLS TO WORK
294
When Do We Sharpen?
As detailed in Chapter 3, “Sharpening Strategies,” the sharpening workﬂ ow 
uses three sharpening phases, one of which, creative localized sharpening, is 
optional.
• 
Optimization for source and content can be achieved in a single opera-
tion we call capture sharpening. We recommend carrying out this phase 
as soon as basic spotting and retouching, and all major corrections for 
tone and color have been done. Large moves in tone or color can 
increase noise, and distort or even wipe out sharpening, so the image 
should be close to ﬁ nal tonality before the initial sharpening. 
• 
Optional creative sh arpening can be done at any time after the initial 
optimizations for source and content have been carried out, but should 
be done at the image’s native resolution prior to any resampling for 
output.
• 
Sharpening for output should be done after any resampling to ﬁ nal out-
put resolution. We do output sharpening as the last step prior to the 
color space conversion to output space. 
Each of these phases can be partially or completely automated. With capture 
sharpening, a speciﬁ c source and edge frequency can be turned into a single 
action that returns layers for post-application modiﬁ cations. In the case of 
creative sharpening, the steps required for creating the effect can be 
recorded—even the selection of a brush and a layer mask can be automated. 
You will, however, need to manually paint in the effect. Output sharpening 
for a speciﬁ c device, media, and resolution can easily be turned into a time-
saving action, too. These actions can be applied to a variety of ﬁ les without 
constantly producing errors, but it requires some practice and expertise. We 
can offer the expertise, but the practice is up to you.
AUTOMATION IN PHOTOSHOP
Our general rule of thumb is that if you ﬁ nd yourself using the exact same 
series of steps more than three or four times on a regular basis, you would 
beneﬁ t by recording an action to make your life easier (and, at least, spend 
less time at the keyboard). The more complicated and tedious the steps, the 
stronger the argument for automation. Many of the tools and techniques we’ve 

AUTOMATION IN PHOTOSHOP
295
discussed are prime candidates for automation. Before we get into lengthy 
and complicated action writing, we need to cover some of the fundamentals.
Action Basics
Recording an action to accomplish a series of steps and arrive at a ﬁ nal goal 
may seem a bit geeky and certainly needs to be done with a clear head (and 
not under the pressure of short deadlines), but it’s really not too difﬁ cult. 
The key is to start simple and then grow your ambition.
Creating an Action Set
The Actions panel of Adobe Photoshop CS4 contains a set of actions called 
Default Actions. They were written to provide some useful examples and to 
have something populating the panel. However, you should start off by cre-
ating your own set of actions. Figure 6-1 shows clicking the “Create new 
set” button and naming the new set “Sharpening.”
Once you’ve named and created the set, actions that you create will be 
added to that set. We’ll walk you through the process of recording the exact 
series of steps required for making a sharpening layer, one of the most basic 
components you’ll need to create in order to automate sharpening. As we 
said in Chapter 4, “Sharpening Tools,” there are two ways of creating a 
sharpening layer: duplicating the Background layer or using the Option/
Merged procedure. This action will use the Option/Merged procedure.
Recording an Action
You must have an image open in order to record this action. It is useful if 
the image is something other than a simple Background layer image. Since 
this sharpening layer will often need to be produced after basic spotting and 
retouching as well as major tone and color corrections, the image you use to

button on the Actions panel.

CHAPTER 6: PUTTING THE TOOLS TO WORK
296
record the action should already contain those layers (even if you simply 
make them up for the purpose of the recording). 
Figure 6-2 shows the beginning of the action-recording process.
At this point, Photoshop is recording. Before you actually start recording 
steps, relax, think your way through the process, and don’t rush. Photoshop 
will wait patiently as you plan and execute each step. Remember, you can 
always stop at any step in the process and start again. You can also simply 
trash an aborted recording and start again from the top. 
We ﬁ nd it useful to do some practice runs and, if need be, take notes (par-
ticularly of speciﬁ c settings) while rehearsing. While the Actions panel does 
not offer an excellent editing environment, you can go back in and edit 
steps, reorder them (take great care with that), and drag individual steps to 
the trash. 
We’ll go through the next steps, shown in Figure 6-3, rather quickly—they 
should be familiar from Chapter 5, “Industrial-Strength Sharpening 
Techniques.”

CHAPTER 6: PUTTING THE TOOLS TO WORK
298
To record this action, we included an 
additional step not previously men-
tioned to make the action run 
whether or not the image has layers. 
After selecting the Background layer, 
we added a new blank layer. If we 
didn’t, running the action on an 
image without any layers would fail, 
since the command to Merge Visible 
cannot run on a simple Background 
layered image. 
Figure 6-4 shows the ﬁ nal recorded 
action steps.
Testing an Action
Once you record an action, you 
should test it on a wide variety of 
images with different layers and layer 
types to be assured that the action is 
error proof. There’s nothing worse 
than starting a batch operation on a 
bunch of images only to ﬁ nd out later 
that the action has kindly stopped and given you a warning or otherwise 
halted the whole process. Actions, like any sort of computer programming, 
are logical steps written in code that either work or don’t work. While it may 
seem at times like Photoshop conspires to thwart your efforts, we can assure 
you there is no conspiracy going on, just a rather limited (yet valuable) tool 
that takes you at your literal word. If you say, “do this, then do this,” that is 
exactly what the action will do, time and time again. So it behooves you to 
be sure that what the action does is what you want to do.
To test a recorded action, you can run it either by clicking the Play button or 
using the keyboard shortcut of pressing Command (Mac) or Control 
(Windows) while clicking the actual action name.

The Actions Panel Flyout Menu
There are some important options in the main Actions panel ﬂ yout menu, 
shown in Figure 6-5 along with the Action Options and Playback Options 
dialog boxes. At the top of the ﬂ yout are commands that duplicate the func-
tions of the panel buttons. 
At the top of the ﬂ yout menu is an option called Button Mode. You are 
welcome to try this out, but since we tend to have many, many actions 
installed, making each and every action into its own button doesn’t work 
for us, but it may for you. 
The two options dialog boxes are important to set up correctly:
•
Action Options allow you to rename actions (which you can also do 
by double-clicking the action name) as well as assign Function keys to 
play actions at the press of a button.
•
Playback Options are for accelerated or step-by-step operations. You 
can also program in a pause for a speciﬁ c set of seconds. For action 
troubleshooting, it’s often useful to take the playback off of accelerated 
Figure 6-5 Actions panel 
fl yout menu and options 
dialog boxes

fl yout menu

CHAPTER 6: PUTTING THE TOOLS TO WORK
300
to allow you time to watch what the action is doing. Normally you want 
the accelerated options selected—unless you charge by the hour and 
want to pad your invoice.
From the ﬂ yout menu you can choose Insert Menu Item, which is a useful 
function when recording actions that call up menu items and dialog boxes. 
You can also record an Insert Stop command to allow you to include mes-
sages or instructions, but this isn’t useful for batching.
TIP: When you run an action on an open image in accelerated mode, it will run as fast 
as Photoshop can, given the fact that certain interface items tend to slow things 
down. Photoshop doesn’t try to update most windows and icons, but if you want to run an 
action as fast as possible, try putting Photoshop into the background as a process (activate a 
diff erent application of the main Finder). You’ll see the speed jump up considerably. This is 
important when running a Photoshop batch operation as well.
Editing Actions
Once you record an action, you can do limited editing of it. Double-clicking 
the action step will prompt whatever dialog box was recorded to reopen for 
modiﬁ cations of the settings. This can be frustrating because the exact same 
conditions that existed when the action was recorded must also exist to edit 
the step. 
In Figure 6-6, the last step of our recorded Sharpening Layer action was 
used to record the Layer Style options and Blend If settings. If you double-
click the step on an image that has no layers, you’ll get the dreaded “command 
not currently available” warning. All that means is you must remember to 
re-create the conditions that allow that action step to be rerecorded in order 
to edit that step.
When you record the settings of a ﬁ lter or some other command such as a 
tone adjustment, the parameters are hard-coded into the action. You can 
double-click them to rerecord the parameters, or you can toggle the option 
Figure 6-6 Rerecording 
action steps
Double-clicking an action step to rerecord
Warning if conditions don’t allow editing

AUTOMATION IN PHOTOSHOP
301
to force the dialog box for the ﬁ lter or adjustment to appear for manual 
entry. Figure 6-7 shows toggling the dialog box by clicking in the dialog box 
column. You can also decide to temporarily disable any steps in a recorded 
action. The action will bypass those steps and either stop or continue run-
ning as though those steps were never recorded.
In the event you accidentally record a step or record an undo and a new step, 
you can always choose to eliminate steps from a recorded action. Figure 6-8 
shows the easy way of dragging the step to the trash.
One of the action-editing steps we often use is to copy individual action 
steps from one action to another. In the event we forget a step, we can grab 
the step from an action that has the step we need. Figure 6-9 shows taking 
the important step of adding a layer from the Sharpening Layer action we 
previously recorded, and adding it to an action recorded subsequently.

If you hold down the Option (Mac) or Alt (Windows) key while dragging, 
the step will be copied, not moved. We already mentioned that adding the 
new layer step was important for making an error-proof action, but when 
we recorded the Midtone Contrast Brush action, we missed that step, so we 
needed to add it after the fact.
Saving Your Action Set
Once you create a series of actions, it’s important to save them as a set. You 
can’t save individual actions, only sets. It’s critical to save sets because until 
saved they exist only virtually in Photoshop’s preferences. If you quit and 
restart Photoshop “normally” you won’t have a problem, but if you crash, 
whatever you’ve done in an action set will be lost unless you save it. We 
can’t tell you the number of times that we have personally been burnt by 
this, and it hurts! Hours spent recording and troubleshooting some compli-
cated actions can be completely lost. 
Figure 6-10 shows the Save Actions command from the Actions panel ﬂ yout 
menu and the Save dialog box.
Where you save your action set isn’t particularly important unless you want 
the set to show as an Actions panel ﬂ yout menu option. If you do, you must 
save the set in the root Photoshop CS4 application folder, in the Presets 
folder under Actions. It’s the same location for Mac and Windows.

We could continue going through the tools and techniques that we’ve out-
lined in Chapters 4 and 5, but space limitations preclude us from doing so. 
In lieu of extended examples, we’ve taken the actual actions written for the 
book and made them available on the Real World Image Sharpening page on 
the Peachpit website, www.peachpit.com/RWIS. The actions are shown in 
Figure 6-11.
Batch Processing Using Photoshop
The Batch command (which you access by choosing File > Automate in 
Photoshop or Tools > Photoshop > Batch in Adobe Bridge) is one of 
Photoshop’s most powerful and scary features, but conceptually it’s very 
simple. You point it at a batch of images, it runs an action on them, and then 
it does one of the following:
• 
Saves new ﬁ les
• 
Delivers open images in Photoshop
• 
Saves and closes, overwriting the source ﬁ les or creating new ones
The devil, however, is in the details, and some of the details in the Batch 
dialog box are distinctly counterintuitive if not obtuse. Figure 6-12 shows 
the Batch dialog box before customizing any of the settings.

for download

CHAPTER 6: PUTTING THE TOOLS TO WORK
304
The dialog box is split into four sections, each of which controls a different 
aspect of the batch process’s behavior:
•
Play lets you choose an action from an action set that will be applied to 
all the images. Be sure this is the action you really want!
•
Source lets you designate the source of the images on which the batch 
will be executed. It also lets you choose some very important options 
whose functionality will become apparent later. You can run a batch: 
•  On a designated folder that you choose in the Batch dialog box by 
clicking the Choose button
• On opened ﬁ les
•  On images imported through the Photoshop File menu’s 
Import command

•  When Batch is called from Bridge’s Tools > Photoshop menu, on the 
images that are currently selected in Bridge
For processing raw images, the source will invariably be a folder or the 
selected images in Bridge.
•
Destination lets you control what happens to the processed images. 
None delivers them as open images in Photoshop or as images saved 
by steps in the action. Save and Close saves and closes the processed 
images. Folder lets you designate a folder in which to save the processed 
images. It also includes the renaming features offered by Batch Rename.
Unless you are experienced at batch processing, you should choose 
either None or, much more commonly, Folder. Save and Close often 
ends up being a “hurt-me” button because its normal behavior is to 
overwrite the source image. So avoid Save and Close unless you are 
really, really sure!
•
Errors lets you choose, when an error is encountered, whether to stop 
the entire batch or log the errors to a ﬁ le. We usually stop the batch 
when debugging an action used in Batch, and log errors to a ﬁ le when 
actually running a batch in a production situation. 
The difﬁ culties that users typically encounter in running Batch are in the way 
the selections in the Source and Destination sections interact with the action 
applied by the batch operation. Here are The Rules. (Note: These are our rules 
and we swear by them. They don’t represent the only possible approach, but 
by the time you’re sufﬁ ciently skilled and knowledgeable to violate them 
with impunity, you’ll have long outgrown the need for this book.)
 
NOTE: The Batch function can be launched by either Bridge or Photoshop. However, 
the only way you can select images to run a Batch from Bridge is if Bridge has 
launched the Batch operation. The Batch operation from Photoshop is limited to running on 
folders, imported images, or open fi les. While Bridge can communicate to Photoshop via 
scripts, there’s no way for Photoshop to query Bridge to discover selected images. As a 
result, we suggest always starting from Bridge when calling the Batch function if you need 
to run a Batch on specifi c images rather than on an entire folder of images.
The Rules for Opening Files in a Batch Operation
To make sure that raw ﬁ les get opened and processed the way you want 
them in a batch operation, you need to record an Open step in the action 
that will be applied in Batch. When you record the open step, make sure 

CHAPTER 6: PUTTING THE TOOLS TO WORK
306
that Adobe Camera Raw’s Settings menu is set to Image Settings, so that it 
applies the custom-tailored Camera Raw settings you’ve made for each 
image. You’ll also want to make sure that Camera Raw’s workﬂ ow set-
tings—Space, Bit Depth, Size, and Resolution—are manually set to produce 
the results you want.
Now comes one of the counterintuitive bits. If you record an Open step in 
the action, you must select Override Action “Open” Commands. When you 
select this option, you’ll get a warning as shown in Figure 6-13. If you don’t, 
the batch will simply keep opening the image you used to record the Open 
step in the action. Override Action “Open” Commands doesn’t override 
everything in the recorded Open command; it just overrides the speciﬁ c 
choice of ﬁ le to open, while ensuring that the Selected Image and workﬂ ow 
settings get honored. 
If you aren’t processing raw ﬁ les, however, the Open step is optional and 
likely not a good idea unless you encounter a situation that requires it.
The Rules for Saving Files in a Batch Operation
To make sure that the processed ﬁ les get saved in the format you want with 
the options you want, you need to record an actual Save step in the action 
that will be applied in Batch. This Save step dictates the ﬁ le format (.tif, .jpg, 
.psd) and options that go with that format—TIFF compression options, 
JPEG quality settings, and so on.
Now comes the second counterintuitive bit. You must select Override Action 
“Save As” Commands; otherwise, the ﬁ les don’t get saved where you want 
them, saved with the names you want, or possibly saved at all! Selecting this 
option will give you the warning shown in Figure 6-14. 
Figure 6-13 The Override 
Action “Open” Commands 
conundrum
Override checkbox
Warning you see when 
selecting this option

AUTOMATION IN PHOTOSHOP
307
Also, the ﬁ le format and ﬁ le format parameters recorded in the action’s 
Save step are applied when saving the ﬁ le, but the name and destination are 
overridden by the options you speciﬁ ed in the Batch Choose Destination 
dialog box.
Yes, recording or not recording an Open and Save As step is confusing to 
say the least. You also need to decide whether the remaining checkboxes in 
the Source dialog box are selected or unselected. The option to Include All 
Subfolders is straightforward; selecting this option will burrow down and 
process all images in the enclosing folder. However, the subfolder structure 
will be lost. So be careful when selecting this. The Suppress File Open 
Options Dialog is something you can pretty much always leave selected 
unless your open command requires some sort of user input such as select-
ing which page in a PDF to open or how to rasterize an EPS ﬁ le. The 
Suppress Color Proﬁ le Warnings is another one you probably always want 
to select unless you like seeing color management warnings. 
Playing by the Rules
If you follow these relatively simple rules we’ve provided, your batch opera-
tions won’t fall prey to any of these ills, and they’ll execute smoothly with 
no surprises. If you fail to do so, it’s very likely that your computer will 
labor mightily and then deliver either results that are something other than 
you desired or, even more frustrating, no results at all—or, heaven forbid, 
your original ﬁ les ruined! The best way to learn batch processing is to do so 
when you are not already under an incredible time crunch. Batching is 
meant to save time, not ruin images.

SAVING IMAGES WITH
IMAGE PROCESSOR
If the discussion of batching with actions has left you just a bit queasy from 
geekiness, you’ll be happy to know there is a simpler and easier method of 
selecting a bunch of images in Bridge and getting processed ﬁ les out the 
backside. It’s called Image Processor and it offers a quick (and arguably 
much easier although less powerful) method of saving up to three versions 
of the selected images—a JPEG, a TIFF, and a Photoshop ﬁ le, with each 
format in a separate subfolder. You can set different sizes for each format 
and, optionally, run an action and include a copyright notice. 
Figure 6-15 shows the Image Processor dialog box.
These are the Image Processor options:
• 
“Open ﬁ rst image to apply settings” is primarily useful for process-
ing unedited raw images that require approximately the same treatment. 
When you run Image Processor, the ﬁ rst raw image opens in Camera 
Raw. The settings you make there are applied to all the other images. 
Figure 6-15 Image 
Processor dialog box

SAVING IMAGES WITH IMAGE PROCESSOR
309
These settings are used only by Image Processor—they aren’t written to 
the image’s metadata.
• 
“Select location to save processed images” lets you save the images 
in either the same folder or one that you designate here. In either case, 
if you’ve chosen multiple ﬁ le formats, a subfolder is created for each 
ﬁ le format.
•
File Type lets you save any combination of JPEG, PSD, and TIFF, with 
the option to resize the image in any of the chosen formats.
•
Preferences lets you choose an action that runs on all the processed 
images. It should be noted that the action will run when the image is 
ﬁ rst opened, which means you could also run an action that includes 
separate save steps. The Copyright Info allows you to include copyright 
information if you haven’t done so already, and gives you a choice to 
include the ICC (International Color Consortium) proﬁ le in the images.
One nifty feature of Image Processor is that it takes care of ﬂ attening and 
downsampling to 8-bit/channel automatically for the JPEGs while saving 
the PSDs and TIFFs as layered 16-bit/channel images if an action you 
choose to run creates layers. So it’s by far the quickest and easiest way to 
save a high-resolution TIFF and low-resolution JPEG version of the same 
image—something many of us need to do often.
Whether you go the full-blown action and Photoshop batch operations route 
or use the simpler Image Processor (hey, we use it all the time because of 
expedience), you still need to learn how to create sharpening, noise reduc-
tion, and mask-making actions simply to make your life quicker and easier. 
The other thing we love about actions is they never have a hangover or 
headache, and they’ll produce the exact same results on Friday at the end of 
a busy workweek as they do ﬁ rst thing Monday morning! Consistency is 
almost as important as saving time.

EFFICIENT CAPTURE SHARPENING
IN CAMERA R AW
While there isn’t an automated way of applying capture sharpening in Camera 
Raw, there are more efﬁ cient methods than simply opening an image at 100% 
in Camera Raw and ﬁ ddling with the sliders until you get the image looking 
sharp. That works, don’t get us wrong, but doing it image-by-image is a slow 
and tedious process. If you need to edit a ton of images, make picks, and 
deliver good-quality processed raws with capture sharpening, you can do so 
more quickly if you make and use Camera Raw presets.
Creating Camera Raw Sharpening Presets
If you remember back to Figures 5-35 and 5-38 from Chapter 5, we showed 
you examples of high-frequency and low-frequency edge widths. It’s really 
not all that hard to train yourself to be able to determine the most predomi-
nate edge width right from within Bridge, so that makes it a perfect place to 
apply presets—but only if you’ve already taken the time to create them. 
Figure 6-16 shows the image we’ll use to set up a new preset. The ﬁ gure 
includes the optimized sharpening settings in the Detail panel of Camera Raw.

Detail panel parameters

Once you have the settings adjusted, you’ll navigate to the Presets panel to 
create a new preset. Figure 6-17 shows the Presets panel as well as the New 
Preset dialog box you get when you click the New Preset button.
In the New Preset dialog box, it’s useful to give the preset a descriptive 
name that will make sense to you in what might be a lengthy drop-down 
menu down the road. We like to include the speciﬁ c parameters and some 
sort of name start that provides for alphanumeric order. You can’t change 
the preset order, and currently you can’t even rename them in Camera 
Raw—you can only delete or re-create them. We used the name Sharp-HF 
to indicate it’s a high-frequency image sharpening preset, and the settings 
we used were 50, .8, 40, and 10 as shown in Figure 6-16.
It’s also important to understand the impact of saving presets as subsets. In 
this case we’ve selected only the Details subset, which includes Sharpening,

Luminance Noise Reduction, and Color Noise Reduction. We speciﬁ cally 
selected that subset from the drop-down menu, as shown in Figure 6-17, 
because we want to be able to apply this subset over other presets without 
overwriting those image settings. As a result we can apply a White Balance 
subset, a curve, and some split toning for effect, and still be able to use the 
sharpening preset to only modify the Detail settings.
We wish we could further break down the parameter settings for Sharpening 
in presets, but alas, not at this time (it’s something we’re hoping for in the 
future). Once you’ve created and saved your preset, it will show up in the 
Presets panel in Camera Raw as well as in Bridge. Figure 6-18 shows the 
new preset in the Presets panel and the same preset in the Bridge Develop 
Settings ﬂ yout menu under Edit.
One of the things we like to do is use the Context Menu directly on thumb-
nails in Bridge. The Context Menu provides a variety of useful things to do 
to images, including the same Develop Settings ﬂ yout as in the Edit menu.

Controlling Camera Raw’s Preferences
As useful as presets in Camera Raw may be, it still takes some sort of 
decision on your part when to apply the preset, and of course you need to 
have already made the preset. Instead, you can have Camera Raw automati-
cally apply a given set of parameters every time Camera Raw ﬁ rst sees an 
image. This is called the Camera Raw Default, and it differs from presets 
in two ways. First, the default settings in Camera Raw preferences can be 
dependent on the camera’s serial number, not just model. So, if you have 
two cameras of the same model, you can tweak the defaults of each camera 
based on its serial number stored in metadata. Second, you can have Camera 
Raw apply different default settings based on the metadata of your camera’s 
ISO setting. 
Figure 6-19 shows the three ways to access Camera Raw’s preferences.
Once the Camera Raw preferences dialog box, shown in Figure 6-20, 
opens, you’ll see a variety of options. There are a couple of rather important 
settings you need to consider.

CHAPTER 6: PUTTING THE TOOLS TO WORK
314
In previous versions of Camera Raw, it was often advocated to turn off 
image sharpening when processing out of Camera Raw. We now no longer 
believe this is the case; in fact, we like the new sharpening. But if you really 
don’t want Camera Raw to sharpen your images, you can change the option 
in the “Apply Sharpening to” drop-down menu.
In the Default Image Settings section, you can choose to make the defaults 
speciﬁ c to camera serial number and ISO setting. We think each is an 
important consideration and well worth the time and effort to arrive at 
camera- and ISO-speciﬁ c defaults. 
When you alter the defaults, be aware that any settings you change from the 
standard Adobe-provided default will be captured as part of the new default. 
While you may want to tweak the Luminance Noise Reduction settings for 
your camera’s ISO 400 setting, if you’ve adjusted any other parameter, that 
parameter will be part of the new default; so an adjustment for exposure or 
brightness will also be caught as well as the ISO setting.
The ideal situation is to open an image that has no actual image settings 
applied yet, and set only the parameters you want to change. For the camera 
serial number, it may be the calibration settings or perhaps an exposure bump 
if that one camera’s meter is off. In the case of the ISO settings, we suggest 
modifying only the Luminance and perhaps to back down on the Color 
settings. Zoom in 200% to 400% and really evaluate the noise signature, 
and try to arrive at an optimal.

Figure 6-21 shows the Camera Raw ﬂ yout menu option to Save New 
Camera Raw Defaults as well as the command to set them back (in case you 
change your mind).
While Camera Raw and Lightroom can’t easily exchange presets (because 
the formats differ), what a lot of users don’t realize is they do share the same 
Camera Raw defaults. That means if you make changes to Camera Raw’s 
Adobe-provided defaults, Lightroom picks up those same changed defaults. 
This has gotten Jeff a couple of times when working with new cameras. 
Figure 6-22 shows the Lightroom command to change the defaults as well 
as the dialog box that gives you the option to update or restore the defaults.

316
While you can move presets from computer to computer by placing them in 
the correct locations for Camera Raw and Lightroom, respectively, there is 
no easy way to move the default settings. You can take the same image you 
used to create the new defaults, copy that image to a different computer, and 
use that image to change the defaults. Not elegant, but it works. 
AN EFFICIENT SHARPENING
WORKFLOW FOR LIGHTROOM
Since Lightroom contains an entire workﬂ ow (well, except for creative 
sharpening), simply setting up Lightroom’s Develop module is just the tip 
of a pretty big iceberg (almost 90% of an iceberg is actually invisible and 
underwater). You also have the ability to import images with presets as well 
as using output sharpening for prints and upon export. Lightroom is a rich 
sharpening ecosphere even without the creative sharpening. 
Creating Sharpening Presets in the Develop 
Module
The place to create capture sharpening presets is the Develop module. You 
need to zoom to 100% (1:1 in Lightroom) in order to see the sharpening and 
the previews in Lightroom. Figure 6-23 shows an image zoomed to 1:1 with 
sharpening adjusted for a high-frequency image. It’s only happenstance that 
the settings are pretty similar to the settings arrived at for the seal image in 
Camera Raw.
The settings here really pop this high-frequency image detail. Normally, 
since the ISO was set to 200, we would probably tweak the noise settings. 
Ideally we should have already altered the Camera Raw/Lightroom shared 
defaults. Unfortunately, we don’t always practice what we preach.
Once you arrive at the preferred settings, you’ll use the Create New Preset 
button on the Presets panel, as shown in Figure 6-24.

CHAPTER 6: PUTTING THE TOOLS TO WORK
318
Once you create the new 
preset, you may need to 
modify or rename it. 
Unlike Camera Raw, 
Lightroom allows you to 
use a context menu to 
modify the name or update 
the settings. You can also 
export or import the set-
tings in the event you need 
to move to different com-
puters. Figure 6-25 shows 
the context menu items 
when you Control-click (Mac) or right-click (Windows) a preset.
Once you have the preset saved, it becomes available in a variety of time-
saving locations. For example, you can access the Develop settings in the 
Library module’s Quick Develop panel, shown in Figure 6-26, as well as in 
the Lightroom Import dialog box. Both areas offer a great degree of power 
and ﬂ exibility aiding in creating an efﬁ cient workﬂ ow. 
As with Camera Raw presets, you can apply multiple presets from Quick 
Develop that include subsets. You can apply tone and color settings, and 
then select sharpening settings to apply on top. As long as you keep the 
subsettings separate, they won’t overlap and compete—although Quick 
Develop will display only the last settings. If the subsettings do compete, 
the last setting wins.
While you can apply multiple settings in Develop and in Quick Develop, 
you can apply only a single Develop setting when importing images. Figure 
6-27 shows the Import Photos dialog box in Lightroom with the Sharp-HF 
40 .6 40 0 settings selected as the Develop presets.

While the application of presets at import is slightly limited (you can’t apply 
some presets to certain images and different presets to other images), you 
can at least start down the road of being as efﬁ cient as possible when work-
ing in Lightroom. That’s not to say that applying a preset somehow locks 
you into a speciﬁ c set of parameters. The advantage of parametric editing is 
you can always go back later and make adjustments. 
Figure 6-28 shows working on a single image from the previous import and 
zooming into the image to ﬁ ne-tune the sharpening settings.
The coin image needed a slight modiﬁ cation from the applied preset. Rather 
than keeping the Radius at .8, we reduced it to .7. We also increased the 
Detail setting to 60 to increase the high-frequency texture. We kept Masking 
the same but increased the Luminance settings. This was done in part to 
compensate for the rather high Detail settings.

AN EFFICIENT SHARPENING WORKFLOW FOR LIGHTROOM
321
Whether you use Lightroom presets in the Develop module, in the Library 
via Quick Develop, or when ﬁ rst importing into Lightroom, the key point 
to remember is that you need to have already created the presets. Not unlike 
sitting down to record actions for Photoshop, the process of creating presets 
needs time set aside outside the hubbub of a busy deadline. The upside to 
presets (as opposed to images processed by actions) is that any Develop 
preset you apply in Lightroom can also be unapplied.
We wish we could include a whole section on Lightroom’s creative sharpening 
but, as we’ve indicated, we still consider that functionality under develop-
ment. We advocate the trip from Lightroom into Photoshop and then back 
for Lightroom’s organizational capabilities and, more importantly, the ability 
to make printing much easier.
Creating and Using Templates in Print
The Print module has become the primary place for both output sharpening 
for inkjet and photo lab prints, as well as harnessing Lightroom’s capabilities 
for making and using templates to increase efﬁ ciency and reduce user error. 
Quick, everyone who has ever sent a job off to a printer with the wrong 
paper orientation, raise your hands. That’s everybody, correct? This, as well 
as other potential spots for user error, can be eliminated. Yes, you do still 
need to load the correct paper size and type in the printer—there’s not 
much Lightroom can do about that. But in the Print module, selecting the 
correct printer, printer proﬁ le, image orientation, output sharpening, and 
image size is distilled down to a simple click of a button—once you’ve made 
your templates. 
Figure 6-29 shows an image in the Print module. On the right side are the 
primary module settings, and on the left are the Templates storage and the 
Collections access.

CHAPTER 6: PUTTING THE TOOLS TO WORK

The image shown in this Print module is one of the images in Jeff’s main 
retrospective print show. At the bottom of the Print module is the ﬁ lmstrip 
(very small) showing the other 30 images in the show. On the left is 
Lightroom’s Collections panel (more about that in a moment).
The Right-Side Print Module Panels
The main emphasis when using Lightroom’s Print module is to make print-
ing simple, efﬁ cient, and painless. One of the most irritating aspects of 
printing is when your page setup doesn’t match your image orientation. 
Accidentally printing a vertical image on horizontal paper sucks! Lightroom 
can easily handle that with the Rotate to Fit option shown in Figure 6-30.

AN EFFICIENT SHARPENING WORKFLOW FOR LIGHTROOM

At the top right in the Print module is the 
Layout Engine. As you can see in the ﬁ gure, 
we’re going to concentrate on dealing with a 
single image, not contact sheets or picture 
packages of multiple images.
The Image Settings panel holds the most 
important productivity enhancement. 
When you select the Rotate to Fit option, 
Lightroom will automatically rotate a land-
scape image to ﬁ t a portrait paper setting (or 
vice versa). So you never need to change 
your paper orientation settings in the print driver, nor physically rotate an 
image, as you would in Photoshop. If you do a lot of printing, this is a simple 
and yet critical enhancement for workﬂ ow.
The next panel down is the main Layout 
panel, where you determine the page margins 
and the image cell size settings. While the 
overall page dimensions are set by the printer’s 
page setup, the Layout panel determines how 
big the image will be and with what margin 
size. Figure 6-31 shows the margins set to 
2 inches and the cell size set to a maximum 
of 26” x 20”. This reﬂ ects the page size of 
30” x 24” minus the margins. The actual size 
of the image will end up being 20” x 25.21” 
because the 20” dimension tops out due to 
the image’s proportions.
We’ve already covered selecting output 
sharpening in Chapter 5, but the Print Job 
panel is also where Lightroom handles color 
management duties. This is another area of potential user error, and simpli-
fying the selection and use of output proﬁ les makes Lightroom more efﬁ cient.

CHAPTER 6: PUTTING THE TOOLS TO WORK
324
Figure 6-32 shows the Print Job panel as well as the drop-down menu 
options for the Proﬁ le and Rendering Intent menus.
Once you set Print Resolution and Print Sharpening, the primary settings 
you’ll want to set and ultimately capture in a saved template are the Color 
Management settings. In the Proﬁ le menu (see Figure 6-32), you choose the 
proﬁ le you want to print with. You’ll notice this is a short and abbreviated 
list; we have a lot more proﬁ les loaded. If you click the Other option in the 
Proﬁ le drop-down, you can choose which proﬁ les you want shown in the 
display. Figure 6-33 shows the dialog box that allows you to select visible 
proﬁ les. Figure 6-32 also shows the Rendering Intent menu. Which is the 
best one? Unfortunately the only way to know is to use soft prooﬁ ng 
(which Lightroom doesn’t yet have) and see which intent works best with 
your image. For critical ﬁ nal color, we use Photoshop for soft prooﬁ ng, 
which we combine with creative sharpening duties. 
Figure 6-33 shows the list of installed output proﬁ les. The only proﬁ les that 
will appear are RGB printer-type proﬁ les and optionally Display Proﬁ les 
(which we translate to mean RGB color spaces such as Adobe RGB). The 
proﬁ les selected are for the Epson 3800 printer and constitute the three 
papers Jeff commonly uses for that printer: Enhanced Matte (EMP), 
Premium Glossy (PGPP), and Premium Luster (PLPP).

The Left-Side Print Module Panels
The real joy in using Lightroom manifests itself with the capability to capture 
both the Page Setup and the Print Settings for your paper size, media type, 
and print driver. Figure 6-34 shows the Mac version of the Lightroom buttons 
and the Page Setup and Print dialog boxes for Mac.

CHAPTER 6: PUTTING THE TOOLS TO WORK
326
The key thing to note on the Print dialog box is that on the bottom, the 
button says Save, not Print. This is because what you are doing is actually 
setting up Lightroom’s print template to capture the page and print settings. 
Figure 6-35 shows a Windows Vista version of the Print Properties dialog box.
Since Windows print properties can set both page setup and print driver 
settings, Lightroom has a Print Settings button only on the Windows ver-
sion (shown in Figure 6-35).
We really must stress the potential for a greatly enhanced print workﬂ ow 
when capturing all the layout, print job, page setup, and print driver settings 
to store in a Lightroom print template. Figure 6-36 shows creating a new 
template.
One of the real time-savers Jeff has found is when you create a collection in 
your main Lightroom catalog, that collection will be available not only in 
Library but in the other modules, such as Slideshow, Web, and Print. This 
greatly facilitates the assembly of print shows and organized collections of 
images intended for printing. 
Figure 6-37 shows the Collections panel in the Print module as well as the 
ﬁ lmstrip at the bottom of the module.

CHAPTER 6: PUTTING THE TOOLS TO WORK
328
If it hasn’t dawned on you yet, perhaps Figure 6-37 will help drive home the 
point. In Photoshop, to make a print you need to open the image, make sure 
it’s the right size for the print, correctly set the page setup and the print driver, 
navigate through a myriad of dialog boxes for color management, and 
ﬁ nally hit the Print button—and hope you set everything correctly. If you 
want to make one print from each of 31 prepared print ﬁ les in Photoshop, 
you would need to do the exact same series of steps correctly, 31 times. In 
Lightroom, you would create one Print module template, select the 31 
images, and click Print. Then all you need to do is make sure the printer is 
on and loaded with paper. Which seems the most efﬁ cient to you?
Consider also that with Lightroom, you don’t need to spawn off a new ﬁ le 
interaction each and every time you want to make a different sized print, 
and that output sharpening is automatically applied at the right output reso-
lution for whatever size and media you are printing to. That’s one of the 
reasons we really love Lightroom for printing. 
Figure 6-38 shows the real payoff: the Print One button in Lightroom.
To be clear, you can still use the old-fashioned Print button if you have a 
burning desire to see more dialog boxes (the main Print dialog box will 
come up). But if you’ve got everything set correctly, all you need to do is 
click the Print One button. That bypasses any other dialog boxes and sends 
the image to the printer. If you have one image selected, only that one 
image goes. If you have multiple images selected, they all get sent to the 
printer. Cool, huh? Makes using Lightroom just as a print utility program 
almost worthwhile.
The last part of the efﬁ cient Lightroom sharpening workﬂ ow deals with 
output sharpening when exporting images.
Image Sizing and Output Sharpening 
in Export
While we tend to keep images inside Lightroom and roundtrip to Photoshop 
only for creative sharpening or soft prooﬁ ng for print, there are of course 
times when we need to produce consumable ﬁ les for outside of Lightroom. 
Producing images for this book is a prime example, since we need to do 
output sharpening for CMYK output. When you need to get images out, 
use the Export dialog box, as shown in Figure 6-39.
Figure 6-38 Lightroom

The left side has the ever-present presets, which we’ll address in a moment. 
On the right are a series of drop-down menus highlighting the main Export 
functions such as Export Location and File Naming. We want to concentrate 
on the Output Sharpening and the Image Sizing sections. Figure 6-40 shows 
the main Image Sizing portion as well as a drop-down units menu.

CHAPTER 6: PUTTING THE TOOLS TO WORK
330
Since output sharpening really can’t be done until the image is at the ﬁ nal 
dimensions and pixel resolution, exporting the ﬁ les from Lightroom means 
properly setting the Image Sizing panel settings. You can set the panel to 
Width & Height, which allows explicit sizing, but if your images vary in 
orientation or proportions, that is less useful than the other options. We 
ﬁ nd it easier to determine the Long Edge or Short Edge dimension, then 
set the Resolution settings. Figure 6-41 shows changing from Dimensions 
to Long Edge.
Here the Long Edge option is set to 16 inches at 300 ppi, which means that 
any images will end up 16” by whatever their cropped proportions dictate. 
Vertical, horizontal, and square images will all respect the Long Edge image 
settings. 
After setting the ﬁ nal dimensions and resolution, then we can set the output 
sharpening. If we were going to output images for halftone reproduction, 
of course we can’t do the sharpening in Lightroom, since only print and 
screen sharpening are offered. In that case, simply deselect the Sharpen For 
options. Figure 6-42 shows the Output Sharpening options.

In this case, we want to select the Glossy Paper option for the output type 
and we tend to prefer the Standard Amount setting. If we were saving for 
Web output, we would use the Screen option instead of either of the paper 
settings. In testing we’ve determined that whether you are printing from an 
inkjet-type printer or a continuous-tone printer, such as might be used at a 
photo lab, the same respective media settings will work well. However, you 
may want to test which sharpening amount to use, as the machine settings 
on continuous-tone printers can have an impact on both the resolution and 
apparent sharpening.
Output Presets in Export
As might be expected, if you often have to export the same type of ﬁ les, 
you would want to take advantage of Lightroom’s capability to create Export 
presets. The whole purpose of drilling down on Lightroom’s preset and 
template capability is to encourage their use. Creating and then getting used 
to using presets can greatly improve your workﬂ ow efﬁ ciency (and gives 
hope for having a life outside of digital imaging). 
Figure 6-43 shows the New Preset dialog box in the Export module and the 
resulting preset saved in the User Presets menu.

menus (both are shown 
for clarity)

CHAPTER 6: PUTTING THE TOOLS TO WORK
332
Post-Processing from Export
Normally Lightroom can’t take advantage of any actions or recorded macros. 
There are presets, templates, and defaults you can use, but you need to 
actively command their use. However, from Export you can use Lightroom 
to command Photoshop to process exported ﬁ les using Export actions 
(which are really just Photoshop droplets). 
Figure 6-44 shows the Post-Processing After Export drop-down menu.

333
As you can see, you have the choice to do nothing, show or open the result-
ing image, or actually use a Photoshop droplet that is appearing in the 
menu because we previously created and saved a droplet from Photoshop. 
Figure 6-45 shows the Photoshop Create Droplet dialog box, which is 
accessed from File > Automate > Create Droplet.
Figure 6-44 After Export 
drop-down menu in Post-
Processing
Figure 6-45 Photoshop’s 
Create Droplet dialog box

CHAPTER 6: PUTTING THE TOOLS TO WORK
334
If it looks like the Photoshop Batch dialog box, that’s because that is what a 
droplet actually is: a saved Batch process in executable form. In this case 
we’ve created a droplet using the Grain Layer action from the Sharpening 
set (which you can download). We’ve saved the droplet to the location that 
Lightroom needs to be able to “discover” it from, and once saved it will show 
up in the After Export menu. Figure 6-46 shows that actual saved droplet.
The exact location to save droplets 
in for Mac is User/Library/
Application Support/Adobe/
Lightroom/Export Actions. The 
easy way to navigate to the folder is 
select the Go to Export Actions 
Folder Now command in the After 
Export drop-down menu. 
For Windows users, well, the loca-
tion is a bit more complicated:
• 
Vista: User\Username\AppData\Roaming\Adobe\Lightroom\Export 
Actions
• 
XP: Documents and Settings\Username\Application Data\Adobe\
Lightroom\Export Actions
Or just use the Go to Export Actions Folder Now command!
There are some caveats to using Photoshop droplets (either in Photoshop or 
Lightroom), the ﬁ rst being that the actual action that is embedded into the 
droplet executable is no longer editable once you’ve created the droplet. If 
you want to alter or edit the action, you’ll need to save out a new droplet. 
If the droplet has a Save As step as part of the action, be very, very careful 
that the destination is known and understood. Once you save the action as 
a droplet, you can’t really tell where ﬁ les will be saved. If the ﬁ le is saved in 
the same location as the original, you risk overwriting that ﬁ le, which could 
be a disaster. We seriously suggest keeping Save As steps out of any actions 
you save as droplets to eventually be run from Lightroom. Be safe, not 
sorry, when it comes to automation—which is actually a good rule to follow 
with any sort of automation you may deploy, be it in Photoshop, Camera 
Raw, or Lightroom. It’s better to know exactly what will be the ﬁ nal output

than guess—particularly when it involves original images and unattended 
automated processes. Seriously, we don’t want to automate you out of all 
your priceless original images!
SWEATING THE DETAILS
We admit that this chapter’s drill-down on automation in Photoshop and 
the creation of presets in Camera Raw and Lightroom may seem like a 
whole bunch of work. It is, but the work done setting up an efﬁ cient 
sharpening workﬂ ow offers a return on investment that makes the sweat 
equity worthwhile. 
The way we handle image detail is every bit as important to the ﬁ nal 
appearance of our images as is the way we handle tone and color. Yet detail 
control has, thus far in the short history of digital imaging, received far less 
attention than those other, admittedly crucial, aspects of imaging.
For years, we, like most practitioners, did sharpening as an ad hoc, seat-of-
the-pants procedure until the realization slowly dawned on us that by ﬂ ailing 
around trying different sharpening tricks, we often created extra work and 
produced results that, while acceptable, weren’t nearly as good as they 
should be.
In evangelizing the workﬂ ow approach to sharpening that we’ve taken 
throughout this book, our goal has been to educate and inform, but also to 
move the discussion forward. We don’t claim to have all the answers, but we 
hope you’ve found the ones we do have useful.
