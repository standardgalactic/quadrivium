Semantics of propositional logic
So far, we have developed the syntax or symbols of
propositional logic – by defining a formal language of formulas.

Semantics of propositional logic
So far, we have developed the syntax or symbols of
propositional logic – by defining a formal language of formulas.
Now, we have to examine the semantics or meaning of
propositional logic formulas – by examining the
truth and falsity of formulas in terms of their component parts.

Two-valued Semantics
Propositions are the sort of things that are
true or false.

Two-valued Semantics
Propositions are the sort of things that are
true or false.
We write 1 for ‘true’ and 0 for ‘false’.

We write 1 for ‘true’ and 0 for ‘false’.
This is classical two-valued logic.

Possible truth valuations
If you have three atomic propositions p, q and r, there are eight
different possible combinations of truth values. Why?

Possible truth valuations
If you have three atomic propositions p, q and r, there are eight
different possible combinations of truth values. Why?
In general, given n different atomic propositions, the total number
of different possible truth valuations is 2 × 2 × · · · × 2 (n times),
which is 2n.

Possible truth valuations
The number 2n grows very fast indeed as n gets larger.
