Preface
The first recording of the electric field of the human brain was made by Hans 
Berger, the German psychiatrist, in 1924. These recordings came to be known 
as electroencephalogram (EEG). Since then, the EEG has been a useful tool 
in understanding and diagnosing neurophysiological and psychological 
disorders.
Recent advances in digital recording and signal processing, together with the 
leaps in computational power, are expected to spawn a revolution in the pro-
cessing of measurements of brain activities, primarily EEGs and event-related 
potentials (ERPs). This will enable the implementation of more complicated 
denoising techniques of ERP than ensemble averaging and the implementa-
tion of more complicated EEG quantification analysis methods (qEEG) than 
the amplitudes and frequencies, including nonlinear dynamics and higher-
order statistics. Furthermore, this will help in the implementation of various 
techniques describing the interactions between different regions of the brain, 
which offer more insights into the functional neural networks in the brain.
This book provides an introduction to both the basic and advanced tech-
niques used in EEG/ERP analysis and presents some of their most success-
ful applications. Before we present EEG/ERP methods and applications, in 
Chapter 1 we introduce the physiological foundations of the generation of 
EEG/ERP signals and their characteristics. This chapter first explains the 
fundamentals of brain potential sources and then describes the various 
rhythms of the brain, the different electrode cap systems, EEG recording 
and artifacts, and finally outlines the application of EEG in neurological 
disorders.
In Chapter 2, the basic digital signal processing topics are first explained, 
including time-domain, frequency-domain, and signal filtering; stochastic 
processes; power spectrum density, autoregressive modeling of EEG; and the 
joint time-frequency methods for EEG representation including the short-
time Fourier transform and the wavelet. Next, the nonlinear descriptors of 
the EEG signal are explained, including the higher-order statistics; chaos 
theory and dynamical analysis using correlation dimension and Lyapunov 
exponents; and dynamical analysis using entropy. In addition, motivated by 
research in the field over the past two decades, techniques specifically used 
in the assessment of the interaction between the various regions of the brain, 
such as the normalized cross-correlation function, the coherency function, 
and phase synchronization, are explained. MATLAB® code is provided in 
order to enable the reader to run the presented techniques with his or her 
EEG/ERP data.
Chapter 3 explains the extraction of event-related signals using the multi-
trials-based ensemble averaging technique and the recently proposed

single-trial subspace-based technique, outlining their implementation. 
In addition, this chapter explains brain activity assessments using ERP sig-
nals, including the applications of P100 in the assessment of the functional 
integrity of the visual system and some psychophysiological disorders, the 
application of N200 in the assessment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity dis-
order (AD/HD), and the application of P300 as a biomarker of the severity of 
alcoholism, Alzheimer’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease.
Chapter 4 gives a brief description of the forward and the inverse problem, 
and then outlines the different EEG source localization methods, includ-
ing the minimum norm, the weighted minimum norm (WMN), low resolu-
tion brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA), standardized LORETA, 
recursive multiple signal classifier (MUSIC), recursively applied and pro-
jected MUSIC, shrinking LORETA-FOCUSS, the hybrid weighted minimum 
norm method, recursive sLORETA-FOCUSS, and standardized shrinking 
LORETA-FOCUSS (SSLOFO).
Chapter 5 presents the successful clinical applications of qEEG in the 
detection and monitoring of epileptic seizures. This chapter describes 
the  various proposed techniques for epileptic seizure onset detection 
and epileptic seizure event detection and compares them. In addition, it 
describes a recently proposed method that relies on the singular value 
decomposition of the EEG data matrix for feature extraction and the 
­support vector machine (SVM) for classification.
The brain undergoes several types of dysfunctions caused by internal or 
external stimuli. The cause may be an injury or a neurodegenerative dis-
ease. Chapter 6 discusses the issue of monitoring a neurological injury with 
the qEEG. It describes the assessment criteria of a neuronal injury, the post-
concussion syndrome (PCS), and common evaluations of functional con-
nectivity, including functional homogeneity, differentiation, or topographic 
reciprocities. The monitoring process of a brain injury using the qEEG is also 
outlined, and a review of the various entropy measures, such as information 
entropy, mutual entropy, and approximate entropy, is given.
The brain–computer interface (BCI) is an emerging field of study where 
qEEG techniques are used as a direct nonmuscular communication channel 
between the brain and the external world. In Chapter 7, the different neu-
rotechnologies for the brain–computer interface based on the detection of 
ERPs such as the P300 or the steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) 
are described. Moreover, the different parameters of the P300 waveform that 
can be used to quantify attentional processes are outlined in addition to the 
different technologies for the measurement of arousal, valence, and stress. 
Experimental work conducted in the field is also provided.
Chapter 8 reviews the use of qEEG in psychiatry and presents its applica-
tions as a biomarker for stress, unipolar depression, and alcohol addiction. 
A case study on stress assessment is included and discussed.
EEG is known to have a high temporal resolution but a low spatial res-
olution. On the contrary, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)

Preface
is known to have a high spatial resolution but a low temporal resolution. 
Combining EEG with fMRI may provide high spatiotemporal functional 
mapping of brain activity. Chapter 9 reviews EEG and fMRI fusion tech-
niques, addresses the theoretical and practical considerations for recording 
and analyzing simultaneous EEG-fMRI, and describes some of the current 
and emerging applications. Furthermore, it introduces some integrative 
models for solving the multimodal fusion.
Chapter  10 provides an introduction to memory-related processes. Two 
important processes are memory retention and memory recall, and these 
two processes are discussed in this chapter. Various memory models are 
presented that describe the cognitive loads and memory. The brain ana-
tomical regions associated with memory retention and recall processes are 
discussed. Both short-term and long-term memory processes are described. 
Memory experimental design issues are discussed while keeping in view 
the various factors affecting memory.
Chapter 11 is intended as a general survey of neurofeedback and is written 
to help the reader understand neurofeeback in a general way. It provides a 
starting point for deeper investigation by giving a short history of the field 
and offering an introductory description of the existing clinical modalities 
that are developed as a result. It also describes basic clinical processes and 
neurofeedback interventions, including biological, technical, and scientific 
considerations.
With the advancements in technology, researchers are attempting to 
combine various modalities to reap the benefits of all those modalities. 
One  example is the combination of EEG with fMRI, which can provide 
both spatial and temporal resolution. Chapter 12 discusses the EEG-fMRI 
data fusion and analysis with respect to psychiatry, psychology, and cul-
tural neuroscience. The chapter begins by giving an introduction to cultural 
neuroscience. One section in the chapter is dedicated to psychopathy and 
criminal ­behavior. The final section describes the role of EEG-fMRI in the 
rehabilitation of developmental and psychological disorders such as autism 
and obsessive compulsive disorder.
Chapter 13 discusses the future of EEG, ERP, and EEG-fMRI. These modal-
ities can result in better treatment, prognostication, and rehabilitation for 
various neurological ailments. This chapter provides an insight into how 
EEG technology can be used in neurosurgery. In addition, clinical applica-
tions of EEG are also discussed. Future clinical applications of EEG-fMRI 
and EEG-MEG are presented with a specific emphasis on epilepsy, stroke, 
and traumatic brain injury.

EEG/ERP Analysis
1.1  Introduction to EEG and ERP Signals
1.1.1  History
Electroencephalography (EEG) is the recording of electrical activity along 
the scalp. The flow of current due to firing of neurons in the brain results in a 
voltage fluctuation that is measured as EEG. The measurement of the brain’s 
response to a stimulus is called event-related potential (ERP). The stimulus 
can be sensory, motor, or cognitive in nature.
Richard Caton (1842–1926), a physician, deserves credit for the discov-
ery in 1877 of the fluctuation potentials in rabbits, cats, and monkeys 
that ­constitute the EEG. However, the first measurement and pictorial 
demonstration of EEG was performed by Vladimir Pravdich-Neminsky. 
He ­measured the electrical activity in the brains of dogs in 1912 and named 
it electrocerebrogram [1,2].
Hans Berger (1873–1941), a neuropsychiatrist, started his study of human 
EEG in 1920. The first human EEG tracings were shown in his first report in 
1929. Berger used a bipolar technique and photographic paper to record elec-
trical activities of the brain and named it electroenkephalogram [3]. This term 
later evolved into electroencephalogram or EEG.
In the United States, the first EEG work was reported in Harvard at Boston 
in 1934 by Hallowell Davis [1]. During the years 1935 and 1936, Pauline and 
Hallowell Davis recorded the first known ERPs on conscious humans. They 
published their findings in 1939. In 1964, Grey Walter and his colleagues 
reported the first cognitive ERP component, contingent negative variation 
(CNV) [4].
The development of clinical and experimental EEG work reached a high 
point around 1960. The interest of electroencephalographers in academic 
institutions shifted from tracing to automatic data analysis because of 
computerization. By 1967, people thought that the traditional EEG reading 
would soon become obsolete, being eventually replaced by fully automatic 
interpretation. In the 1970s, studies on the evoked potential progressed 
greatly. The introduction of the pattern changer in the visually evoked 
potential (VEP) technique by Speckrejse and Spehlmann made this 
method very reliable [1]. The 1970s and 1980s saw the emergence of struc-
tural neuroimaging techniques, computed tomography, and magnetic 
resonance imaging.
For 30 years after its discovery, EEG was primarily used for assistance 
in clinical diagnostics, the study of neurological disorders, and brain func-
tion assessments. Different areas of the brain involved in specific neurologi-
cal activities were studied. In 1973, Jacques J. Vidal from the University of 
California introduced a new concept of brain–computer communication [5,6]. 
In his study, he proposed the concept of VEP and the route for the future of 
the brain–computer interface (BCI).

Introduction
Currently, ERP is the most widely used method in cognitive neuroscience 
research. It is used to study the physiological correlation associated with 
the processing of information, such as sensory, perceptual, and cognitive 
activity [7].
1.1.2  Source of Neural Activities
To understand the origins of the EEG signal, a brief introduction to the 
human brain and the neuron, the most fundamental cell in neuropsychol-
ogy, has been presented in the following sections.
1.1.2.1  Human Brain
The human brain may be divided into three major parts: cerebrum, cerebel-
lum, and brain stem. Here, we will only consider the actions of the cerebrum 
and cerebellum. The cerebellum mainly controls complex body movements, 
involving coordination and muscle tone modulation. The cerebrum may be 
subdivided into six parts: frontal lobe, parietal lobe, temporal lobe, occipi-
tal lobe, insular lobe, and limbic lobe. The parietal lobe perceives pain and 
taste sensations, and is involved in problem-solving activities. The temporal 
lobe is concerned with hearing and memory. The occipital lobe mainly con-
tains the regions used for vision-related tasks. The frontal lobe is mainly 
­associated with emotions, problem solving, speech, and movement. It con-
tains the primary motor cortex located anterior to central gyrus as shown in 
Figure 1.1 [8,9].

EEG/ERP Analysis
The primary motor cortex is located between the somatosensory cortex and 
premotor cortex. Different areas of the primary motor cortex control vari-
ous movements of the body. Upper extremity movements also have a differ-
ent representation for the shoulder, elbow, wrist, fingers, and thumb. Facial 
movements, including the neck, eye, face, lips, jaw, tongue, and swallowing, 
occupy a large area of the primary motor cortex. Any body movement or sen-
sory activity of the body is accompanied by specific signals originated from 
the primary motor cortex. Thus, to assess motor-related brain activity, the 
EEG recording should originate from the appropriate location in the spatial 
domain to ensure the correct reading of each electrode. The auditory cortex 
is located below the primary motor cortex. Therefore, audio stimulation may 
affect studies of motor imaginary tasks. Motor imaginary tasks, such as hand 
movements, are controlled by the contralateral parts of the brain. Left-hand 
and right-hand movements are controlled by the right and left hemispheres of 
the brain, respectively [10]. The central nervous system (CNS) mostly consists 
of nerve cells and glia cells. Every nerve cell (neuron) consists of dendrites, 
cell bodies, and axons as shown in Figure 1.2. Nerve cells respond to stimuli 
and information transmission over distances. An axon is a cylindrical tube 
that sends and transmits an electrical signal in vertebrates. The transport sys-
tem of an axon is responsible for delivering proteins to the end of the cell.
1.1.2.2  Structure and Function of the Neuron
Neurons (or nerve cells) are functional units of the nervous system. An adult 
human brain contains, on an average, 100  billion neurons [11]. Neurons 
process and transmit information through electrical and chemical signals.

Introduction
Neurons have a resting membrane potential of about −70 to 60  mV [12]. 
A neuron consists of a cell body (also known as soma), dendrites, and an 
axon (see Figure 1.2) [13]. Depending on the information the dendrites receive 
from other neurons, the neuron makes a decision that is then sent to other 
neurons’ dendrites over the axon.
1.1.2.2.1  Action Potentials
The neuron is surrounded by the cell membrane, which controls the in and 
out movement of charged sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+) ions. The cell 
body is negatively charged on the outside and has a resting potential of 
−70 mV [8]. The membrane potential becomes less negative because of the 
incoming electrical current from the dendrites (see A in Figure 1.3) [8,14]. 
The cell membrane completely opens up for Na+ ions if this depolarization 
reaches −55 mV, when the ions now enter the cell, resulting in a momentarily 
positive action potential (see B in Figure  1.3) [8]. The cell membrane also 
opens up again, and the K+ ions present in the cell leave (see C in Figure 1.3), 
which causes the repolarization of the membrane’s potential [9]. Owing to 
the loss of permeability of the cell membrane for the K+ ions, the potential 
temporarily falls below 70 mV (this is known as hyperpolarization; see D 
in Figure 1.3). Finally, the action potential stabilizes at the resting potential. 
This action potential is carried over by the axon to other neurons. Hence, the 
neuron becomes activated if the total electrical current from all the incoming 
axons exceeds a certain threshold. This results in the transfer of information 
(the action potential) to subsequent neurons.

EEG/ERP Analysis
The EEG activity cannot pick the electrical potential generated by a ­single 
neuron [15]. In fact, the EEG activity is a reflection of the summation of the 
synchronous activity of a big group of neurons, probably thousands or 
­millions, having a similar spatial orientation. A similar spatial orientation is 
necessary for the ions to line up and create waves that will be strong enough 
to pass the detection threshold. It is known that the voltage fields fall off with 
the square of the distance, and hence the pyramidal neurons of the cortex 
that are well aligned and fire together are thought to produce most EEG sig-
nals. The EEG activity from deep sources is difficult to detect as compared to 
the activity that happens near the skull [16].
1.2  Brain Rhythms and Wave Patterns
Neural oscillations are observed throughout the central nervous system. 
These are generated by large groups of neurons and can be character-
ized by the frequency, amplitude, and phase of the oscillations. Cognitive 
functions such as information transfer, perception, motor control, and 
memory are in one way or another related to neural oscillations and 
synchronization [17–19].
EEG recordings are commonly used to investigate neural oscillations. 
Neurons can generate action potentials or spikes in a rhythmic pattern. Some 
neurons have the tendency to fire at particular frequencies and are called 
resonators. Spiking patterns that are the result of bursting are considered 
fundamental for information coding. In many neurological disorders, the 
cause is excessive neural oscillation. For example, in seizures, excessive syn-
chronization has been observed. Similar phenomena have been observed in 
tremor patients in Parkinson’s disease. Oscillatory activity can also be used 
in BCIs to control external devices.
The human brain can produce five major brain waves, classified by their 
frequency ranges. These five major waves can range from low frequency to 
high frequency. These are known as alpha (α), theta (θ), beta (β), delta (δ), 
gamma (γ), and mu (μ). Berger, in 1929, discovered alpha and beta waves; 
gamma waves were discovered by Jasper and Andrews in 1938, while delta 
and theta waves were discovered by Walter in 1936, both of which represent 
waves with a frequency below the alpha range [11].
Delta waves fall within the range of 0.5–4.0 Hz. These waves have the 
highest amplitude among the other waves but have the lowest frequency. 
These occur frontally in adults and posteriorly in children. These waves 
are primarily associated with deep sleep. These delta rhythms may also 
be associated with subcortical lesions, deep midline lesions, or meta-
bolic encephalopathy hydrocephalus. Figure 1.4 shows delta waves in the 
­interval 0 to 1 s.

observed in young children. However, in older children and adults, these 
waves are observed in a state of drowsiness or arousal, as well as in medita-
tion. These waves may occur anywhere and are not related to the tasks at 
hand. An excess of theta waves may represent abnormal activity.
Alpha waves lie in the frequency range of 8–13 Hz. These waves were dis-
covered by Dr. Hans Berger in 1908. Because these waves were the first to 
be discovered, they are called alpha waves (first waves). Alpha waves are 
associated with wakefulness, closing the eye, effortless alertness, and cre-
ativity. These waves normally appear in the posterior half of the head and 
have higher amplitude over the occipital areas.
Beta waves lie in the frequency range 14–26 Hz. Found only in normal 
adults, these waves are correlated with active attention, active thinking, solv-
ing critical problems, or focusing on the outside world and, therefore, are 
also known as sensory motor rhythm. Rhythmical beta waves are experi-
enced mainly in the frontal and central regions. Beta waves are low in ampli-
tude and are normally under 30 μV.
Gamma waves lie in the ranges above 30 Hz (up to 100 Hz). These waves 
help to determine the binding of different populations of neurons together. 
They occur rarely in the human brain. They occur only during crossmodal 
sensory processing, that is, the process of combining different senses such 
as sound and sight.
Mu wave ranges from 8 to 13 Hz. These waves are mixed with other waves 
and sometimes partly overlap other rhythms. It shows the synchronous 
firing of motor neurons over the sensorimotor cortex. The different brain 
rhythms are shown in Figure 1.4.
1.3  Techniques of EEG and ERP Recording
An EEG recording could be noninvasive or invasive. The noninvasive proce-
dures use surface electrodes and hence are safe and painless. Human EEG 
can be measured using special electrodes with a typical diameter of 0.4 cm to 
1.0 cm. The electrodes are held on the scalp with a paste (wet or dry), depend-
ing on how these electrodes are designed.
1.3.1  Electrodes
Electrodes are placed on the scalp in special positions (following the 
International 10/20 system as shown in Figure 1.5) [11] to acquire the EEG 
data. These are small metallic disks, usually made of silver, gold, tin, or 
stainless steel; and covered with a silver chloride coating. The positions are 
measured on the scalp relative to the known skull landmarks, from the front

Introduction
at the nasion to the inion at the back of the head and side to side from the two 
ear canals. This allows researchers and clinicians in different labs to stan-
dardize their measurements and reporting. The location of each electrode 
is labeled with a letter and a number. The letter refers to the area of brain in 
which the electrode is located, for example, P for the parietal lobe and T for 
the temporal lobe. Even numbers denote the right side of the head, whereas 
odd numbers denote the left side of the head.
In some applications such as BCI and ERP studies, a minimal number of 
electrodes (usually 14 recorded electrodes) is often used and placed at the 
movement-related area or selection area in which the signals are strong 
using the conventional electrode positioning system. In advanced research 
or neural laboratories, more than 16 electrodes (often 64 to 131 recording 
electrodes) are used to get more detailed data. However, adding more elec-
trodes may generate less useful data unless computer algorithms are used 
to manage the raw EEG data. Often, the potential at each location can be 
measured by taking the average of all the potential differences when a large 
number of electrodes are used [20].

EEG/ERP Analysis
1.3.2  Montages
The placement of the electrodes is referred to as a montage. Either a ­bipolar 
montage or a referential montage is used to monitor the EEG. In a bipo-
lar montage, there are two electrodes per channel, which implies that there 
is a reference electrode for each channel. In a referential montage, there is a 
common reference electrode for all channels.
1.3.2.1  Bipolar Montage
In a bipolar montage, each waveform represents the difference between 
two adjacent electrodes. For example, the channel Fp1–F3 represents 
the ­difference in voltage between the Fp1 and the F3 electrodes. Similarly, 
F3–C3 represents the difference in voltage between the F3 and C3 
electrodes.
1.3.2.2  Referential Montage
In this montage, the difference between a certain electrode and a desig-
nated reference electrode is measured. This difference is represented by 
the channel. The reference electrode has no standard position. However, 
the position of the reference electrode is different from the record-
ing electrodes. Midline positions are often used to avoid the amplifica-
tion of signals in one hemisphere relative to the other. Another popular 
reference that is used considerably is “linked ears.” It is the physical or 
mathematical average of the electrodes attached to both the earlobes and 
the mastoids.
1.3.2.3  Average Reference Montage
In this montage, an average signal is obtained by summing and averaging 
the outputs of all the amplifiers, which is then used as the common reference 
for each channel.
1.3.2.4  Laplacian Montage
In this montage, the difference between an electrode and a weighted average 
of the surrounding electrodes is used to represent a channel. When digital 
EEG is used, all signals are typically digitized and stored in a particular 
(usually referential) montage. Because the stored information is digital, it is 
possible to mathematically construct any ­montage from any other montage. 
However, for the case of analog EEG, which is stored on paper, the person in 
charge has to switch between the montages during the recording to focus or 
highlight special features of the EEG.

Introduction
1.4  Recording and Artifacts
“Potential fluctuations of non-neural origin are called artifacts” [5]. EEG 
­signals that originate from noncerebral origins are called EEG artifacts. 
These signals are detected along the scalp by EEG. The amplitude of the 
signals that constitute an artifact can be quite large relative to the amplitude 
of the signals of interest.
EEG noise or artifacts may be subdivided into two different classes. 
Biological artifacts arise from the internal brain functions. The technical arti-
facts are introduced into the EEG signal by the experimental equipment at 
the surrounding, or various human errors. The EEG artifacts are briefly dis-
cussed below.
1.4.1  Biological Artifacts
These artifacts arise from biological activity in the brain.
1.4.1.1  Electrooculographic Artifacts or Ocular Artifacts
Electrooculographic (EOG) artifacts, or simply ocular artifacts, arise from 
vision-related stimuli. In simple words, this means that EOG artifacts are 
induced by eye movements and blinks. Visual stimuli are highly localized 
in the occipital lobe [8]. Artifacts such as eye blinks, eyeball movements, and 
extraocular muscle activities can be found in the frontal lobe, whereas VEPs 
are usually associated with the occipital lobe.
Eye blink artifacts may introduce observable alterations in both the amplitude 
and the frequency content of the EEG. These artifacts may considerably reduce 
the classification accuracy. Eye blink artifacts also fall in the alpha band fre-
quency region. For motor classification, the alpha rhythm is the most important 
frequency band [10]. We may also view eye blink artifacts as muscle artifacts.
A VEP is induced when the subject is exposed to different visual stimuli. 
A VEP is phase-locked to the event, so it may affect the temporal resolution. We 
need the precise temporal location of the event in a classification process. A VEP 
also affects the primary motor cortex in some subjects by producing VEP arti-
facts at the time of a motor imaginary event. Because of its high amplitude, a VEP 
may completely obscure the desired evoked potential in the ­frequency domain.
As shown in Figure 1.6 [21], eyeball movements can cause muscular arti-
facts in EEG signals. This artifact may be avoided by keeping the viewing 
angle constant during the recording time.
1.4.1.2  Electromyogram Artifacts
The electromyogram (EMG) artifacts are found when electrical current is 
generated by the contraction of muscles. This represents neuromuscular 
activities. An example of EEG signals recorded from the EMG is depicted 
 

12
EEG/ERP Analysis
in Figure 1.7 [22]. The subjects are instructed to avoid movements as much 
as possible during signal recordings. Muscle artifacts may include the 
following.
Hand/leg muscle artifacts may cause a slow drift in the EEG amplitude. 
This drift is usually high compared to other brain activities. To minimize this 
artifact, we have avoided hand or leg movements during EEG recordings.

Introduction
Facial muscle artifacts are also undesirable unless the facial expression 
is used as a signal. Different swallowing motions produce different arti-
fact shapes.
1.4.1.3  Electrocardiogram Artifacts
Electrocardiogram (ECG) artifacts occur when there is a potential difference 
in the cardiac muscle cell. In each cycle of the heartbeat, such a potential dif-
ference occurs during depolarization and repolarization. The ECG influence 
depends on the length and width of a person’s neck. An example of ECG 
artifacts is shown in Figure 1.8 [23].
These artifacts arise from heart activity. Cardio artifacts are present in 
every subject, while their magnitude and location might vary depending on 
the subject. We can remove cardio artifacts using an ECG signal. Specific 
methods are proposed for ECG artifact mitigation [11]. Using these ­methods, 
one can approximately reconstruct the electrical signal produced by the heart 
function. Depending on the experimental setup, ECG noise may severely 
damage EEG recordings.
1.4.1.4  Other Bio-Artifacts
Acoustic noise produces an artifact when the subject encounters acoustic 
stimuli such as noise coming from the outside, people moving inside the lab, 
telephone calls, and so on. Therefore, any form of distraction capturing the 
subject’s attention should be avoided while capturing EEG signals.

EEG/ERP Analysis
1.4.2  Technical Artifacts
1.4.2.1  AC or Power Line Artifacts
Power line artifacts have a significant peak of about 50/60 Hz in the power 
spectrum. High-impedance electrodes can cause the wire running from 
them to function as antennae that receive electrostatic noise. Shielding the 
power source can reduce the electrostatic noise. A notch filter can be used to 
remove this artifact [7].
1.4.2.2  DC Noise
A DC offset is frequently observed in recorded signals. Only hardware is 
responsible for these offsets. For each trial, the DC noise might differ in 
amplitude.
1.4.2.3  Artifacts due to Improper Placement of Electrodes
In bipolar recordings, placing electrodes at slightly different locations dur-
ing each recording may produce additional artifacts in EEG signals.
1.4.2.4  Artifacts due to High Impedance
The high impedance of EEG electrodes (>5 kΩ) may result in artifacts. The 
EEG is a very weak signal, having an amplitude up to approximately 100 μV. 
The contact resistance of electrodes is generally kept below 5 kΩ to avoid 
high-impedance artifacts [24]. Table 1.1 gives a brief overview of the different 
types of artifacts [21].

Introduction
1.5  Properties of EEG and ERP Signals
The EEG has the ability to monitor human brain activity noninvasively, with 
a precision of milliseconds. This is necessary for understanding the founda-
tions of cognitive functions. The EEG reflects thousands of ongoing brain 
processes.
Continuous EEG recordings consist largely of oscillations at different fre-
quencies that fluctuate over time and provide valuable information about a 
subject’s brain state. Brain oscillations such as EEG alpha activity (8–13 Hz) 
clearly respond to sensory stimulation (e.g., alpha suppression). To what 
extent these oscillations contribute to event-related EEG signals such as 
ERPs is a matter of ongoing research. It has become evident that an ERP does 
not necessarily capture all event-related information present in the EEG. 
For instance, the oscillations induced by, but not perfectly phase-locked to, 
an event of interest, zero out in the process of ERP calculation. It is there-
fore helpful to distinguish between evoked, phase-locked oscillations and 
induced, non-phase-locked signals.
In pure EEG data, it is difficult to focus or isolate individual neurocogni-
tive processes; hence, such processes are considered difficult to assess and 
analyze. To extract more specific information related to sensory, cognitive, 
and motor events, ERPs are used.
The common way of analyzing event-related EEG signals is the calculation 
of ERPs. This can be done by repeating an event of interest such as a visual 
stimulus on a computer screen and analyzing a small fraction of the EEG 
activity that is evoked by this event.
An ERP in response to sensory and cognitive events usually consists of a 
number of peaks and deflections, which, if characterized by latency, mor-
phology, topography, and experimental manipulation [25], are called ERP 
components. Early components typically reflect sensory processing and can 
be associated with the respective sensory cortical areas, whereas later ERP 
components convey information about cognitive effects of brain function. 
ERP components are usually small in magnitude (i.e., 1 to 20 μV). They show 
substantial interindividual variation and are susceptible to various artifacts. 
It is therefore necessary to carefully evaluate ERP properties before any con-
clusions can be drawn.
ERP components are referred to with different acronyms. Most compo-
nents are represented by a letter N, representing negative polarity, and P, 
representing positive polarity. This is followed by a number that indicates 
either the latency (measured in milliseconds) or the component’s ordinal 
position in the waveform.
For example, the first substantial negative peak in the waveform that often 
occurs about 100  milliseconds after a stimulus is often referred to as the 
N100 or N1. N100 indicates that it is a negative peak, and its latency is 100 ms. 
 

16
EEG/ERP Analysis
N1 indicates that it is the first negative peak. This is often followed by a 
­positive peak, usually called the P200 or P2. However, it is to be noted that 
the stated latencies for ERP components are often quite variable. For exam-
ple, the P300 component may exhibit a peak of anywhere between 250 ms 
and 700 ms [26].
ERPs are caused by processes that might involve memory, attention, or 
changes in the mental state, among others, whereas the processing of the 
physical stimulus is reflected by evoked potentials. ERPs are used exten-
sively in neuroscience, cognitive psychology and science, and psychophysi-
ological research. Dementia, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, stroke, 
head injuries, and obsessive compulsive disorder [27–32] all have shown 
abnormalities in ERP components.
In the recent past, P300 is used to develop BCIs. This is done by arranging 
many signals in a grid. The rows of the grid are randomly flashed, and the 
P300 responses of a subject staring at the grid are observed. In this manner, 
the subject can communicate which stimulus he is looking at [33].
1.6  Application of EEG in Neurological Disorders
The nervous system consists of the brain, nerves, and the spinal cord. A disor-
der in any of the components of the nervous system of a structural, ­biochemical, 
or electrical nature is called a neurological disorder. There are many common 
and rare neurological disorders. General symptoms of neurological disorders 
may include seizures, paralysis, muscle weakness, poor coordination, altered 
levels of consciousness, loss of sensation, pain, and confusion.
The specific causes of neurological problems may vary from genetic disor-
ders to environmental and lifestyle problems, including trauma, spinal cord, 
brain or nerve injury, and malnutrition. The origin of the problem is not 
necessarily the nervous system; it may start in any other body system that 
interacts with the nervous system. For example, problems in cardiovascular 
systems, that is, blood vessels supplying the brain, may result in cerebrovas-
cular disorders; the immune system of the body may cause autoimmune dis-
orders, and so on. However, in some cases, no neural cause can be identified 
in spite of the presence of neurological symptoms. Such conditions invite 
different theories about the causes of the condition.
The brain and spinal cord are physically enclosed in the bones of the skull 
and spinal vertebrae. Chemically, these are isolated by the blood–brain 
­barrier. They are very susceptible to damage if compromised. Similarly, 
nerves tend to lie deep under the skin but can still become exposed to dam-
age. The peripheral nervous system may be healed by the process of neurore-
generation and thus overcome the injuries to some extent, but this is thought 
to be rare in the case of the brain and spinal cord.
 

17
Introduction
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a chronic and progressive degenerative ­disorder 
of the central nervous system. The general symptoms are impairment of motor 
skills and speech, resulting in rigidity of muscles, tremor, slowing of physical 
movements, and in extreme cases total loss of physical movement. The pri-
mary symptoms are the result of decreased stimulation of the motor cortex, 
and secondary symptoms may include a high level of cognitive dysfunction 
and speech problems.
Alzhemier’s disease is a neurodegenerative disease. It causes progressive 
cognitive deterioration along with symptoms of behavior changes and a 
decline in daily activities. Minor forgetfulness or loss of short-term memory 
is one of the early symptoms. However, the progression of the disease results 
in the impairment of skilled movements, recognition, decision-making, and 
planning.
Myasthenia gravis is a disease that causes muscle weakness and fatigue 
while performing simple daily activities. Demyelination is the loss of myelin 
sheath insulating the nerves. It results in the impairment or loss of the ­signals 
along the nerves. The nerves eventually whither, which leads to disorders 
such as multiple sclerosis.
Brain rhythms can help to treat different brain disorders. Recent studies 
have led to the discovery of brain rhythms for PD [34]. By implanting elec-
trodes within the brain, irregular brain rhythms can be detected. The mea-
surement of signals from the cerebral cortex, that is, the outermost layer of 
brain that helps govern memory, physical movement, and consciousness, 
can be used for the detection of the disease. In normal circumstances, the 
cells of the brain work independently, but in the case of PD, the cells dis-
play synchronization most of the time, which is not an appropriate behavior. 
This leads to different characteristic symptoms displayed by PD. Deep brain 
stimulation is now also used to treat depression and obsessive compulsive 
disorder. It requires a surgeon to implant electrodes inside tiny parts of the 
brain to deliver an electrical current. In PD, these electrodes are implanted 
normally in patients who cannot fully benefit from drugs owing to unknown 
reasons or complications, and have mid-range disease. Deep brain stimula-
tion can free them from severe immobility and other related symptoms, so 
that they may have a better quality of life for many years.
In addition to PD, it has been observed that many psychiatric and neuro-
logical conditions are caused by an abnormality in the brain rhythms, that is, 
the firing mechanism of neurons. Hence, various symptoms can be generated 
depending on the location of the abnormality in the brain. Rhythm abnor-
malities may happen anytime a group of neurons begin to generate oscil-
latory activity at a lower frequency, and coherently at a longer wavelength, 
than in a normal alert brain. A pattern very similar to this happens in the 
brain in the sleeping state. However, when it occurs in the awakened state, 
then it results in abnormality; that part of the brain remains fixed at a lower 
frequency, and it stops responding to stimulants and external inputs. Hence, 
the brain becomes nonresponsive, as though it is under general anesthesia.
 

18
EEG/ERP Analysis
PD, depression, obsessive–compulsive disorder, and many other neuropsy-
chiatric conditions are being considered for treatment by deep brain stimula-
tion (DBS). The principle underlying DBS is that the firing pattern of neurons 
is changed by the targeted stimulation of the brain.
Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological diseases. Seizures are 
the characteristic symptom of epilepsy and could be recurrent and unpro-
voked [35]. Epilepsy is the most common condition among children and 
ranks third among adults after Alzheimer’s and stroke. Currently, there is no 
cure for epilepsy; however, it can be controlled using medication. Abnormal, 
excessive, or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain results in transient 
epochs called seizures. Epilepsy has widely divergent symptoms that are 
the result of abnormal brain electrical activity. The cause for 30% of epilepsy 
cases is known, whereas 70% of them have no known causes. Among the 
known causes are brain tumor, stroke, head trauma, gunshot wounds, acci-
dents, falls, poisoning, infection, and the genetic factor. It has been observed 
that the EEG of the epileptic brain is a nonlinear signal with deterministic 
properties [35]. A mathematical modeling of the nonlinear brain can help 
pave the way for avenues of treatment where the early onset of the seizures 
can be identified and preventive measures can be taken to control it.

2.1  Introduction
It is common knowledge that a signal contains information about the behav-
ior or nature of some phenomenon. The task of biomedical signal ­processing 
in general is to extract useful information contained in the signal. The method 
used to extract this information depends on the nature of the signal and the 
kind of information contained in it. In fact, there is no unique way to process 
signals for information extraction but rather a wide range of approaches. 
Generally speaking, the first step in extracting information from the signals 
is selecting the right analytical representation. This representation can be 
achieved through basis functions in the original domain of occurrence or in 
a transformed domain. Similarly, the process of information extraction may 
be performed in either domain.

The Fundamentals of EEG Signal Processing
Before discussing the representation of signals in the time and frequency 
domains, it is necessary to distinguish between deterministic and nondeter-
ministic signals. A deterministic signal is one whose future values can be 
exactly predicted if enough information about its past is available. Often, one 
only requires a small amount of information related to the past. This means 
that the values of the signal may be calculated by means of closed math-
ematical expressions as a function of time or extrapolated by the knowledge 
of a certain number of preceding samples of the signal. On the contrary, the 
signal is called nondeterministic or stochastic if it is impossible to predict an 
exact future value even if one knows its entire past history. Generally speak-
ing, with stochastic signals, every sample is considered a random variable 
with a specific probability distribution function. The entire sequence of the 
samples of the stochastic signals is called a stochastic process, and its mea-
surement at a certain time is called its realization.
With the EEG signal, despite its predominantly unpredictable (nondeter-
ministic) nature, we could theoretically rescue some deterministic informa-
tion through direct recording in certain cortical areas. In practice, the EEG 
signal is generally processed with statistical methods, extending from first-
order to second-order and to higher-order statistics.
In this chapter, we outline the time and frequency domain representations 
of the deterministic signals, the representation of stochastic processes in the 
time and frequency domains, parametric models of nondeterministic sig-
nals, joint time–frequency representation of EEG signals, higher-order statis-
tics for EEG data analysis, nonlinear analysis of EEG signals, and bivariable 
analysis of EEG signals.
2.2  Continuous-Time and Discrete-Time Signals
Many biomedical measurements such as electroencephalography (EEG) and 
electrocardiography (ECG) or arterial blood pressure are inherently defined 
at all instants of time. The signals resulting from these measurements are 
called continuous-time signals, and it is traditional to represent their func-
tions of time in the form x(t), p(t), and so forth. On the contrary, we could 
sample the values of the continuous-time signal at integral multiples of a 
fundamental time increment, called the sampling time, and obtain a signal 
that consists of a sequence of samples, each corresponding to one instant of 
time. This signal is called a discrete-time signal, and it is traditional to indi-
cate its function of time as x[n], where n is an integer.
Despite the continuous nature of the majority of biomedical signals, the 
continuing development of high-speed digital computers, integrated ­circuits, 
and sophisticated high-density device fabrication techniques have made it 
increasingly advantageous to consider processing continuous-time signals by 
 

24
EEG/ERP Analysis
converting them first to discrete-time signals. This process includes sampling 
the continuous-time signals at a suitable sampling time related to the maxi-
mum frequency in the signal. For the aforementioned reasons, we will con-
sider the discrete-time domain for the representation and processing of EEG 
signals in the rest of this chapter.
2.2.1  Typical Discrete-Time Sequences and Their Representation
We shall now give a brief explanation of several basic discrete-time sequences 
that play an important role in signal and systems analysis.
The first sequence is the unit impulse (or the unit sample), which is defined as
	
[ ]
δ
=
≠
=
0,
0
1,
0
n
n
n
	
(2.1)
The second sequence is the discrete unit step, denoted by u[n] and defined as
	
[ ] =
<
≥
0,
0
1,
0
u n
n
n
	
(2.2)
It is possible to represent the unit step sequence in terms of the unit impulse 
sequence and vice versa. This is given as
	
∑[
]
[ ] =
δ
−
=
∞
0
u n
n
k
k
	
(2.3)
and
	
δ [n] = u [n] − u [n − 1]	
(2.4)
Another important signal in discrete time is the complex exponential sig-
nal or sequence, defined as
	
[ ] =
ω 0
x n
Ae
j
n 	
(2.5)
where A is, in general, a complex number, and ω0 is a real number. Using 
Euler’s relation allows us to relate the complex exponential in Equation 2.5 
and the sinusoidal:
	
cos

The Fundamentals of EEG Signal Processing
A point to be noted when discussing discrete sinusoidals is that they are 
periodic if and only if ω0 is a rational multiple of 2π, or equivalently
	
ω
π =
2
0
n
m 	
(2.8)
where n and m are positive integers. Accordingly, the angular frequency of 
the discrete-time sinusoidal signal is given as
	
ω =
π = ω

N
m 	
(2.9)
2.2.2  Classification of Discrete-Time Signals
In this section, we outline the often-used classes of discrete-time signals.
The energy of a sequence x[n] over an infinite interval, N, is given as
	
lim
E
x n
N
n
N
N
∑
[ ]
=

→∞

(2.10)
and the average power is defined as

2
P
N
x n
N
n
N
N
∑
[ ]
=
+
∞
→∞
= −
	
(2.11)
The signal x[n] is classified as an energy signal if E∞ < ∞, or equivalently, 
P∞ = 0.
The signal x[n] is classified as a power signal if P∞ < ∞.
The signal x[n] is classified as a periodic signal with fundamental period N if
	
x [n] = x [n ± kN]	
(2.12)
where k is an integer. The periodic signal has infinite energy but finite aver-
age power, and therefore it is an example of a power signal.
2.3  Continuous-Time and Discrete-Time Systems
In contexts ranging from signal processing to electromechanical motors and 
chemical processing plants, a system can be viewed as a process in which 
input signals are transformed by the system or cause the system to respond 
in some way, resulting in other signals as outputs.
 

26
EEG/ERP Analysis
Because the discrete-time domain will be used for EEG signal represen-
tation and processing in this chapter, we have confined our discussion to 
discrete-time systems.
2.3.1  Classification of Discrete-Time Systems
Discrete-time systems are typically classified based on their input–output 
relationships into the following classes.
2.3.1.1  Linear Systems
A discrete-time system is called linear if it possesses the important property 
of superposition: if the input consists of the weighted sum of several signals, 
then the output is the weighted sum of the responses of the system to each 
of those signals. More precisely, let y1[n] be the response of the system to an 
input x1[n], and y2[n] be the output corresponding to the input x2[n]. Then the 
system is linear if the response to
	
ax1 [n] + bx2 [n] is ay1 [n] + by2 [n]	
(2.13)
2.3.1.2  Time-Invariant Systems
The system is time invariant if the behavior and characteristics of the sys-
tem are fixed over time. Specifically, a system is time invariant if a time 
shift in the input signal results in an identical time shift in the output sig-
nal. That is, if y[n] is the output of the system when x[n] is the input, then 
the system is time invariant if y[n−n0] is the output when x[n−n0] is applied 
at the input.
2.3.1.3  Linear Time-Invariant System
We call a system that possesses the properties of both linearity and time 
invariance a linear time-invariant (LTI) system. Such a system is amendable 
to simple mathematical analysis and characterization, which makes it widely 
used.
The main advantage of an LTI system is that the input–output relationship 
is fully described by the system response to the unit impulse function. This 
relationship is given as
	
y n
x k h n
k
k∑[ ] [
]
[ ] =
−
=−∞
∞
	
(2.14)
where h[n] is called the impulse response of the system and is the output of 
the system to the unit impulse, δ[n].
 

27
The Fundamentals of EEG Signal Processing
2.3.1.4  Causal Systems
A system is causal if the output at any time depends on values of only the 
present and past inputs. Specifically, the system is causal if the response at 
n0, namely y[n0], depends only on input samples, x[n], for n ≤ n0 and not on 
input values n > n0. In words, the system is causal if it does not precede the 
stimulus (input) with its response (output).
In terms of an LTI system, it can be shown that the system is causal if 
h[n] = 0 for n ≤ 0 [1,2].
2.3.1.5  Stable System
Stability is another important system property. In general, a system is ­stable 
if a bounded input produces a bounded output. This type of stability is 
called bounded-input bounded-output (BIBO) stability. For the case of an 
LTI system, it can be shown [1,2] that BIBO stability is equivalent to satisfy-
ing the condition
	
h n
n∑[ ] < ∞
= −∞
∞
	
(2.15)
where h[n] is the impulse response of the system.
2.4  Representation of Discrete-Time Signals in 
Frequency Domain
It is well known that different domain descriptions of the same phenom-
enon reveal different aspects of the phenomenon and enable us to gain more 
insight into it. This is equally true of the mathematical representation of 
brain signals, where the time domain alone is inadequate. More insight can 
be obtained if the frequency domain is used to represent the signal in terms 
of its spectrum.
2.4.1  The Discrete-Time Fourier Transform
The discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT) of a discrete-time signal, x[n], of 
N samples is defined as

EEG/ERP Analysis
In general, X(ejω) is a complex-valued function of the real variable ω and 
has the following two properties:
It is a continuous function of ω.
It is periodic with period 2π.
Consequently, x(n) can be determined from X(ejω) through the inverse 
­discrete-time Fourier transform (IDTFT), given as

[ ] =

(2.17)
The DTFT equation in (2.16) is called the synthesis equation, and the IDTFT 
equation in (2.17) is called the analysis equation.
2.4.1.1  The Convolution Property
One of the important aspects of the DTFT is its effect on the operation of 
convolution and its use in representing and analyzing discrete-time LTI sys-
tems. Specifically, if x[n], h[n], and y[n] are the input, impulse response, and 
output, respectively, of an LTI system, so that
	
y [n] = x [n] * h [n]	
(2.18)
then
	
Y(ejω) = X(ejω) H(ejω)	
(2.19)
where X(ejω), H(ejω), and Y(ejω) are the Fourier transforms of x[n], h[n], and y[n], 
respectively.
Clearly, Equation 2.19 maps the convolution of two signals to the simple 
algebraic operation of multiplying their Fourier transforms, a fact that 
both facilitates the analysis of signals and systems and adds significantly 
to our understanding of the way in which an LTI system responds to the 
input signals that are applied to it. In particular, from Equation 2.19, we 
see that the frequency response H(ejω) captures the change in the complex 
amplitude of the Fourier transform of the input at each frequency ω. Thus, 
in frequency-selective filtering, we require │H(ejω)│ ≈ 1 over the desired 
range  of frequencies and │H(ejω)│ ≈  0 over the range of undesired fre-
quencies, or frequencies to be eliminated. Figure 2.1 plots the frequency 
responses of four types of ideal filters: (1) low pass, (2) high pass, (3) band 
pass, and (4) band reject. The frequency range for which the gain is 1 is the 
passband of the ideal filter.
As we previously mentioned, the EEG signal has a predominantly non-
deterministic nature, so it is generally processed with statistical methods, 
 

29
The Fundamentals of EEG Signal Processing
extending from first-order to second-order and to higher-order statistics. 
In the following section, we outline the definition of the stochastic process 
and the main descriptors in the time and frequency domains.
2.5  Stochastic Processes
In probability, we usually conduct experiments consisting of procedures and 
observations. When we study random variables, each of the observations cor-
responds to one or more values, whereas when we study stochastic processes, 
each observation corresponds to a function of time. The word stochastic means 
random, and the word process in this context means a function of time.
Definition: A stochastic process x(n) consists of an experiment defined on 
the sample space Ω and a function that assigns a time function xi(n) to each 
outcome ωi in the sample space of the experiment.
Definition: A sample function xi(n) is the time function associated with the 
outcome ωi of an experiment.
Definition: The ensemble of a stochastic process is the set of all possible 
time functions that can result from an experiment.
Figure 2.2 shows the correspondence between the sample space of an 
experiment and the ensemble of sample function xi(n) of a stochastic process.

2.5.1  Mean and Autocorrelation Functions of Stochastic Processes
In studying random variables, we frequently refer to properties of the prob-
ability model, such as expected value, variance, covariance, and correlation. 
In the case of stochastic processes, deterministic functions of time provide 
corresponding summaries of the properties of the model. For a stochastic 
process x(n), x(n1) is a random variable with pdf 
(
)
1
fx n  (x) and expected value 
E{x (n1)}. Because E{x(n1)} is simply a number, the function E{x(n)} is a deter-
ministic function of n.
In general, we define the kth-order joint cdf function of x(n) by

A complete characterization of x(n) requires knowledge of all distributions 
as k → ∞. Fortunately, often much less information is sufficient [3].

In applications involving more than one stochastic process, it is often of 
interest to determine the cross-correlation and cross-covariance functions. 
These two functions are given for the two random variables x(n) and y(n), 
respectively, by

The two random processes x(n) and y(n) are said to be uncorrelated if 
cxy(k,l) = 0 and orthogonal if their cross-correlation is zero.
2.5.2  Stationarity and Ergodicity of Random Processes
If a random process x(n) possesses some special probabilistic structure, we 
can specify it less fully to characterize it. Some random processes are com-
pletely characterized by their first- and second-order distributions.
2.5.2.1  Stationary Processes
A random process x(n) is said to be stationary of order L if for every set of L 
time instants, we have

for any k. Hence, the distribution of a stationary process will not be affected 
by a shift in time, and x(n) and x(n + k) will have the same distribution for 
any k. If the process is stationary for all L > 0, then it is said to be stationary in 
the strict sense [4,5].
If the first-order distribution
	
fx(n) (α) = fx(n + k) (α)	
(2.29)
 

32
EEG/ERP Analysis
is independent of time for all k, then the process is said to be first-order 
­stationary. For a first-order stationary process, the first-order statistics will be 
independent of time. For example, the mean will be constant:
	
μx (n) = E {x(n)} = μx	
(2.30)
Similarly, if the second-order distribution

is invariant to a time shift, then the process is called second-order stationary.
If the random process x(t) is stationary of first order and second order, then it 
is said to be wide-sense stationary (WSS).
Definition: A stochastic process x(n) is wide-sense stationary (WSS) if its 
mean function µx(n) is constant and its autocorrelation rx(k,l) and autocovariance 
cx(k,l) depend only on the difference k−l:

The autocorrelation sequence (ACS) of a WSS process has a number of use-
ful and important properties:
Property 1. The autocorrelation sequence of a WSS process is a symmetric 
function of k,
	
rx (k) = rx (−k)	
(2.33)
Property 2. The autocorrelation sequence of a WSS process at lag k = 0 is 
equal to the average power of the process,

2.5.2.2  Ergodic Processes
It is clear that the mean and autocorrelation sequences of a random process 
are an ensemble-averaging-based function, because an ensemble of all pos-
sible discrete-time signals is required for their calculation. Although these 
 

33
The Fundamentals of EEG Signal Processing
ensembles are required in finding the first- and second-order statistics of a 
random process, they are not generally available. In this section, we present 
some conditions for which it is possible to estimate the mean and autocor-
relation using a time average.
Let us begin with the estimation of the mean value of the random process 
x(n). Consider a random process x(n) with a typical sample function xi(n). If M 
realizations of the process are available, then the mean value can be esti-
mated as
	
∑
( )
( )
=
=

M

x

ˆ

(2.36)
However, in most situations, such a collection of M sample functions is not 
available, and the mean value needs to be estimated from single realization. 
Given only a single realization x(n) of a WSS process, we may consider esti-
mating the ensemble average with a sample mean that is taken over time of 
x(n) as follows:
	
∑( )

−

x n

(2.37)
If the sample mean in Equation 2.37 of the process converges to µx in the 
mean-square sense as
N → ∞, then the process is said to be ergodic in the mean.
Similarly, the autocorrelation function of a WSS process estimated from a 
single realization x(n) can be defined as

If ˆ ( )

 converges to rx (k) in the mean-square sense as N → ∞, then the 
­process is said to be autocorrelation ergodic [6].
2.6  Gaussian Processes
An important class of random processes that arises in a wide spectrum of 
applications is the Gaussian processes.
Definition: x(n) is a Gaussian stochastic process if and only if X = [x(n1) 
x(n2) … x(nk)] is a Gaussian vector for any integer k > 0 and any set of time 
instants n1, n2, …, nk.
 

34
EEG/ERP Analysis
Definition: A discrete-time white noise process, d(n), is a WSS zero-mean 
­random process whose autocorrelation function is zero for all k ≠ 0
	
rd (k) = σ2δ (k)	
(2.39)
where δ(k) is the unit impulse function and σ2 is the noise variance. This 
means that the samples d(n) and d(n + k) remain uncorrelated for any k no matter 
how small it is [7]. Figure 2.3 shows the autocorrelation function of the white 
noise random process.
A random process that consists of a sequence of uncorrelated Gaussian 
random variables is called white Gaussian noise (WGN).
2.7  The Power Spectrum of Random Processes
As with deterministic discrete-time signals, Fourier analysis plays an important 
role in the study of random processes. However, because a random process is an 
ensemble of discrete-time sample functions, the Fourier transform of a random 
process cannot be computed. Nevertheless, it is possible to develop a Fourier 
representation if the process is WSS. Because the autocorrelation sequence of a 
WSS process is a deterministic sequence, its Fourier transform is given as

which is called the power spectrum density (PSD) or power spectral density of 
the process. In the case of real-valued random process, the autocorrelation 
sequence is real and even, which means a real and even power spectrum. 
In  addition, the power spectrum is nonnegative, P(ejω) ≥ 0, and the total 
power in the zero mean WSS process is proportional to the area under the 
power spectral density curve.

2.8  Linear Filtering of Random Processes
LTIs are frequently used to process signals in various applications rang-
ing from detection and estimation to signal representation and synthesis. 
Because the inputs to LTI filters are often random signals, it is important 
to know how the statistics change as a result of filtering. In this section,

2.9  The EEG Signals and Their Characteristics
The electrical activity of the active nerves in the brain produces currents flow-
ing through the head. Some of these currents reach the scalp surface, resulting 
in voltages on the scalp that can be recorded as the EEG. Because the cerebral 
cortex lies immediately beneath the scalp, the EEG recorded from the top of the 
head reflects mostly activities of the cortical neurons. Typically, the EEG signal 
has amplitude ranging from 10 to 100 mV, and its spectrum extends from 0.4 Hz 
to 40.0 Hz, because this is the band with most of the power of the EEG signals. 
Within this frequency band, specific sub-bands are often analyzed, depending 
on the application. The most commonly used bands are as follows.
Delta: This band has a frequency of 3.5 Hz and below. It tends to be the 
highest in amplitude and the lowest in frequency. It is the dominant 
rhythm in infants up to one year and in stages 3 and 4 of sleep [8].
 

37
The Fundamentals of EEG Signal Processing
Theta: This band has a frequency of 3.5–7.5 Hz and is classified as 
“slow” activity. It is normal in children up to 13 years and in sleep, 
but abnormal in awake adults. Theta arises from emotional stress, 
especially frustration or disappointment [9].
Alpha: This band has a frequency between 7.5 and 12.5 Hz and is usu-
ally best seen in the posterior regions of the head on each side, with 
the higher amplitude on the dominant side. It appears when clos-
ing the eyes and relaxing, and disappears when opening the eyes or 
when concentrating on any mechanism (thinking, calculating). It is 
the major rhythm seen in normal relaxed adults. It is present during 
most of life, especially after the 13th year [10].
Beta: This band has a frequency between 12.5 and 30.0 Hz and is usu-
ally seen on both sides in a symmetrical distribution; it is most evi-
dent frontally. It is the dominant rhythm in people who are alert or 
anxious or have their eyes open.
Gamma: This band has a frequency range of 31 Hz and greater. It is 
thought that it reflects the mechanism of consciousness. Beta and 
gamma waves together have been associated with attention, percep-
tion, and cognition [11].
EEG data are generally considered to be nonstationary because its statisti-
cal characteristics change with time owing to the variations in the mental 
states. In the analysis of the EEG signals for information extraction, two 
different methods are used. If the EEG is considered stationary over a long 
time, the classical methods used in the characterization of random pro-
cesses, such as means, variance, and autocorrelation functions in addition 
to the power spectrum density estimated using the periodogram and the 
correlogram, are used. On contrary, if the signal is considered stationary 
over a short time interval (quasi-stationary), parametric methods, such as 
autoregressive (AR) and autoregressive and moving average (ARMA) are 
used to best-fit the EEG data for its analysis and ­classification [12].
The following two sections explain the classical methods and the paramet-
ric models in EEG data analysis.
2.9.1  Time and Frequency Domains Methods
In these methods, the EEG signal is considered stationary over a sufficient 
time interval for efficient estimation of the different average functions, such 
as the autocovariance or autocorrelation in time domain and the power spec-
trum density in the frequency domain.
As mentioned before, estimating the autocovariance or autocorrelation of 
random processes requires averaging over a number of realizations of an 
ensemble. However, if the process is WSS and ergodic, then the autocovari-
ance or autocorrelation sequence can be obtained through the time average 
 

38
EEG/ERP Analysis
over a single realization. Because the EEG sequence is limited in time, due 
to the stationarity issue, the covariance can only be estimated. Practically, 
two estimators are used to estimate the autocorrelation sequence, rx(k), of the 
EEG signal x(n). The first estimator of rx(k) is called the biased estimator and 
is given as

(2.47)
Practically speaking, among the two ACS estimators, the biased one in 
Equation 2.46 is most commonly used, for the following reasons:
For most stationary signals, the autocorrelation function decays rapidly 
with large lags k. Comparing the two estimators, it can be seen that the 
biased estimator tends to produce small values for large k, whereas the unbi-
ased estimator could take large and erratic values for large k. This observa-
tion implies that the biased estimator is likely to produce a more accurate 
estimation for the ACS than the biased one [13].
The ACS obtained by the biased estimator is guaranteed to be positive 
semi-definite, but this is not the case for the biased estimator [14]. This is spe-
cifically important for the PSD estimation, because a non-positive-definite 
ACS may lead to a negative power estimate, which is undesirable in most 
applications.
2.9.1.1  Periodogram for Power Spectrum Estimation
The periodogram method relies on the definition of the PSD. Neglecting the 
expectation and the limit operation in Equation 2.42, which cannot be per-
formed with a limited number of samples, we get

In order to reduce the large fluctuations of the periodogram, Bartlett pro-
posed to split up the N available samples into L segments of M samples 
each and then obtain the periodogram for each segment and find their aver-
age [15,16]. To describe the Bartlett method in mathematical form, let Si(ejω) 
 

39
The Fundamentals of EEG Signal Processing
represent the periodogram of the ith segment, where i = 1, 2, …, L; then the 
Bartlett spectral estimate is given by

Because the Bartlett method operates on data segments of M samples, the 
resolution is reduced by a factor of L in comparison to the original periodo-
gram method. On the contrary, the variance of the estimator is reduced by 
the same factor L.
In 1967, Welch proposed another method based on the periodogram [17]. 
This method is similar to that proposed by Bartlett in segmenting the N data 
samples into L segments of M samples each but differs in two aspects. First, 
the segments in the Welch method are allowed to overlap. Second, each data 
segment is windowed prior to computation of the periodogram. To describe 
the Welch method in mathematical form, let the segments be overlapped 
with 50%, so that the number of segments G = 2M/N.
The windowed periodogram for the ith segment is given by

By introducing the window in the periodogram computation, we hope 
to get more control over the bias or resolution properties of the estimated 
spectrum. Further, by allowing the segments to overlap and thereby allow-
ing more periodograms to be averaged, we hope to decrease the fluctuations 
(variance) in the estimated spectrum.
2.9.1.2  Commonly Used Windows
In this section, we list some common window functions and outline their rel-
evant properties. Our intention is not to provide a detailed derivation or listing 
but rather to provide a quick reference of common windows used in EEG soft-
ware. More detailed information on the windows can be found in Refs. [13,14]. 
Table 2.1 lists some common windows along with some useful properties.

EEG/ERP Analysis
In order to show the variation in the power spectral density of the signal 
with its time content, the EEG recording of an epileptic patient is considered. 
The data are extracted from the CHB-MIT scalp EEG data set [18]. This data 
set is also known as Physionet EEG data set and contains EEG recordings of 
24 pediatric patients acquired at Children’s Hospital, Boston. The patients’ 
age range is between 1.5 years and 19 years. The patients were suffering from 
intractable epilepsy. The EEG was recorded using the International 10–20 
system of electrode placement with bipolar montages.
Figure 2.5 shows the EEG recording of one seizure extracted from the 
­temporal lobe area.

Figure 2.6 shows the power spectrum density estimated using the Welch 
method of the epileptic data in Figure 2.5.
In order to show the variation in the power spectrum density due to the 
seizure, the data in Figure 2.5 is partitioned into two parts, before and after 
the start of the seizure. The power spectrum density as estimated by Welch 
is computed and depicted in Figure 2.7.
The results in Figure 2.7 show clearly the significant increase in the power 
over all frequencies due to the epileptic seizure.

2.9.1.3  MATLAB Functions for Welch Spectrum Estimation
In MATLAB®, the following functions are used to compute Welch’s estima-
tion of the power spectral density:
h = spectrum.welch;
Hpsd = psd(h,x,’Fs’,256);
where x is the data vector that contains the EEG time series data and 256 is 
the sampling rate.
2.9.1.4  Correlogram for Power Spectrum Estimation
The correlogram relies on the Fourier transform of the autocorrelation 
sequence and leads to the correlogram spectral estimation [19]. The formula 
for the correlogram is given by

where rx(k) is the ACS estimated using either the biased estimators in 
Equation 2.46 or the unbiased estimators in Equation 2.47.
As we know, the main problem with the periodogram is the high statisti-
cal variability or variance in this spectral estimator. The correlogram has 
the same problem, which arises from the poor estimation of r(k) values for 
extreme lags (k ≈ N). In order to mitigate this effect, Blackman–Tukey pro-
posed to truncate the sum in the correlogram formula in Equation 2.53. This 
idea implemented with the right window is called the Blackman–Tukey esti-
mator of the PSD, which is given as

where w(k) is an even function, with w(0) = 1 and w(k) = 0 for │k│ ≥ M. 
w(k) is called a lag window. If w(k) is selected to be rectangular, then we 
simply obtain a truncated version of the basic formula of the correlogram 
in Equation 2.53. However, w(k) can be chosen in many other ways, giving 
us the flexibility to improve the accuracy of the Blackman–Tukey spec-
tral estimator. Generally speaking, we may expect smaller values of M 
to reduce fluctuations in the spectral estimator but at the expense of a 
reduced resolution. Analysis of the Blackman–Tukey spectral estimator 
shows that the resolution of the spectrum is on the order of 1/M, whereas 
its variance is on the order of M/N [13]. Thus, a compromise between 
the resolution and the variance should be considered when choosing the 
­window length.

2.9.2  The Parametric Methods for EEG Modeling
This section introduces another powerful approach to signal representation 
called parametric signal modeling. In this approach, a signal is represented 
by a mathematical model that has a predefined structure involving a limited 
number of parameters. Generally speaking, parametric signal modeling has 
a wide range of applications, including spectrum analysis, signal prediction, 
system identification, signal detection, and signal classification. The three 
key elements for successes in all of the applications are an appropriate choice 
of model, good estimation of its length, and an accurate estimation of its 
parameters.
The general model for a stationary random process x(n) is given as the 
input–output relationship of a linear system driven by white noise. This rela-
tionship is given as

where w(n) is the driving noise of the system of the variance σ2
w. This form 
is the general model called the autoregressive and moving average (ARMA). 
As the name clearly indicates, ARMA includes two models, the autoregres-
sive (AR) of order p and the moving average (MA) of order q. Generally 
speaking, among the ARMA, AR, and MA models, the AR is the most popu-
lar. This is mainly for three reasons:
	
i.	Its p parameters can be obtained as a solution of linear equations.
	
ii.	It tends to exhibit peaks in its spectrum, a feature associated 
with high resolution.
	
iii.	Its relationship with the linear prediction.
In terms of EEG, it is widely accepted that AR can accurately represent the 
signal, so its parameters can be used for classification and prediction. For 
example in Ref. [20], the parameters of the AR model are used as inputs of a 
neural network for predicting movements during anesthesia. In Ref. [21], an 
off-line distance measure based on the AR model parameters was proposed 
to effectively quantify the changes in EEG signals related to brain injury. 
In Ref. [22], a multivariate AR model was proposed to analyze EEG signals 
for classification of spontaneous EEG signals during mental tasks. Because 
multichannel synchronization of EEG signals is one of the important char-
acteristics of brain activities that help in analyzing the brain disorder, its 
ictal and interictal measures based on the residual covariance matrix of a 
multichannel AR model are presented in Ref. [23]. In Refs. [24] and [25], the 
AR parameters are used in brain–computer interfacing for the identification 
and classification of various mental tasks.

EEG/ERP Analysis
Even though there is a wide range of applications of AR modeling of 
EEG signals, the AR capability in estimating the power spectrum density 
from short data is one of its great advantages. Generally speaking, the EEG 
data are generally considered to be nonstationary because their ­statistical 
characteristics change with time owing to the changes in the mental states. 
In order to handle this feature, one approach is to assume that over short 
time intervals the signal remains stationary. In this case, the spectrum of 
the signal can be estimated using the periodogram or correlogram, but 
it is known that they perform poorly with limited data. This makes the 
AR a reliable choice in solving the spectrum estimation issue of a quasi-­
stationary EEG signal.

2.9.2.2  Selecting the Order of the AR Model
One of the critical issues in AR spectrum estimation or data fitting is how 
to select the order p of the AR process. If the model order is too small, the 
error in fitting the data will be large and the spectrum will be smoothed, 
resulting in poor resolution. If, on the contrary, the model order is too large, 
then the spectrum may have spurious peaks and may lead to ­spectral line 
splitting  [14]. Therefore, it would be useful to have a criterion that indi-
cates the  appropriate model order to be used with the given set of data. 
Several  ­criteria have been proposed, among them the Akaike’s Information 
Criterion (AIC) [26]. The AIC(p) criterion is given as
	
AIC (p) = N log εp + 2p	
(2.60)
where εp is the energy of the modeling error, obtained as

where ( )
ˆx n  is the estimated value of x(n). The idea, then, is to select the value 
of p that minimizes AIC(p). It is useful to indicate that the AIC gives too small 
an estimation of the order if the modeled process is nonautoregressive and 
tends to overestimate the order as N increases [6].
In summary, using AR to model the EEG data in the time and frequency 
domains involves three major steps. In step one, the appropriate model order 
 

46
EEG/ERP Analysis
should be obtained. In step two, an estimation of the AR(p) parameters is 
made. In step three, the estimated parameters are either inserted into 
Equation 2.56 for time-domain modeling or into Equation 2.58 for frequency-
domain modeling.
Among the aforementioned implementation steps of the AR for EEG data 
modeling, step two is of major importance. A large body of material has 
been developed on the estimation of AR(p) parameters during the past four 
decades. The majority of the proposed methods utilize the relationship 
between the autoregressive model and the linear predictor (LP) in estimating 
AR(p) parameters [27].
2.9.3  The Relationship between the AR Process 
and the Linear Prediction
Suppose that we are given the EEG samples x(0), x(1), …, x(N−1). The forward 
linear prediction (FLP) of the sample x(n) is given as

(2.62)
where fL(1), fL(2), … fL(L) are the FLP coefficients and L is the predictor order. 
The error of the FLP is defined as the difference between the accrual and the 
predicted values, as given by

then the similarity between the autoregressive model given in Equation 2.56 
and the linear predictor becomes clear. Even with the similarity between 
Equation 2.56 and Equation 2.64, there are two major distinctions: (1) the 
sequence w(n) of Equation 2.55 is a white noise process used as a driv-
ing sequence at the input of the autoregressive model, whereas the 
( )

sequence is the output of the forward linear prediction error (FLPE) filter; 
(2) the FLPE sequence is not, in general, a white process unless x(n) is gener-
ated as an AR(p) process and the order of predictor (L) is equal to the order 
of the AR process [14].

From now on, we shall consider that the EEG data are generated as an 
AR(p) process; thus, for a predictor with order L = p, the AR(p) parameters are 
simply given as the predictor coefficients.
Many algorithms addressing the problem of predictor coefficient esti-
mation have been proposed. Among the proposed algorithms, Burg and 
the  ­forward–backward linear prediction (FBLP) remain among the best. 
In the next two sections, we briefly describe these two algorithms.
2.9.3.1  Burg Algorithm
As a consequence of the Levinson recursion [28–31], we may relate the coef-
ficients of a linear predictor of order L to the coefficients of a linear predictor 
of order L−1 as follows:
	
fL(k) = fL−1(k) + ΓL fL−1 (L−k),  for 1 ≤ k ≤ L − 1	
(2.67)
where ΓL = fL(L) is called the reflection coefficient. By substituting Equation 2.67 
into the FLPE and BLPE equations in Equations 2.63 and 2.66, respectively, 
we obtain the following alternative expressions for the FBLPE and the BLPE:

This special structure is known as a lattice filter. The Burg algorithm 
exploits the lattice structure to minimize an objective function defined as 
the mean-squared values of the forward and backward predictor errors, 
given as

EEG/ERP Analysis
By substituting the lattice structure in Equation 2.68 into the objective 
function and then differentiating θ with respect to ΓL and setting the result 
to zero, an optimum value for the reflection coefficients is obtained [14]. 
Having obtained the optimum value of ΓL, then by using the lattice structure 
in Equation 2.68 and the Levinson recursion, the coefficients of the forward 
linear predictor that minimizes the objective function in Equation 2.69 are 
obtained.
Figure 2.8 shows Burg estimation of the power spectrum density of the 
epileptic data set in Figure 2.5 before and after the seizure as compared 
with Welch.
The results in Figure 2.8 show clearly the superior capability of the 
parametric technique of Burg in showing the frequency components of 
the ­epileptic data in Figure 2.5 compared to the averaging technique of 
Welch.
2.9.3.2  The Modified Covariance Method
The basic idea behind this algorithm is to combine the prediction errors in 
the forward and backward directions, and then to perform the least squares 
minimization with respect to all of the linear prediction parameters. This 
algorithm was apparently proposed independently by Ulrich and Clyton [32] 
and Nuttal [33].

where [.]T is the vector transpose. Thus, the predictor equations can be 
expressed as
	
Df = w	
(2.72)
where f = [f1 f2 … fL]T. By solving the last equation using the least squares 
criterion, we obtain the predictor coefficients.

If D is rank deficient with rank value = r, then the null(DT) ≠ 0, and the LS 
has an infinite number of solutions. This issue can be resolved by develop-
ing a minimum norm solution or the general definition of the pseudoinverse. This 
solution guarantees a unique least squares solution in terms of the minimum 
norm even with null(DT) ≠ 0.
2.9.4  MATLAB Functions for AR Parameters and Spectrum Estimation
In MATLAB, the following functions are used to estimate the AR(p) param-
eters using the foregoing two methods:
a = arburg(x,p)% Burg’s method
a = armcov(x,p)% the modified covariance method
 

50
EEG/ERP Analysis
where x is the data vector that contains the EEG time series data, and p is the 
order of the AR model.
The following are MATLAB functions for the estimation of the PSD using 
the Burg and the modified covariance methods:
h = spectrum.burg(p) % Burg’s method
h = spectrum.mcov(p)% the modified covariance method.
Hpsd = psd(h,x,‘Fs’,256);
2.10  Joint Time–Frequency Representation of EEG Signals
The classical spectrum techniques represented by the periodogram and 
correlogram are efficient when the signal is stationary over a long time. 
On the contrary, the parametric techniques are efficient when the signal is 
quasi-stationary or stationary over a short interval. Practically, EEG signals 
are in general a nonstationary type or process, which means that there 
will be problems in obtaining the frequency components from the classi-
cal spectrum estimators and to some extent the parametric-based estima-
tors. In order to overcome this problem, the nonstationary EEG data can be 
divided into short durations over which the signal is considered stationary, 
and then the correlogram or periodogram is computed. The same applies to 
the parametric methods, where the model parameters are estimated from 
each division, and the spectrum is obtained. With the parametric meth-
ods, the use of a short window may result in poor estimation of the model 
parameters and a correspondingly inaccurate estimation of the spectrum. 
On the contrary, with the classical spectrum estimators, the use of a short 
window leads to poor spectral resolution. Nevertheless, if the length of the 
window is increased, the frequency resolution will improve, whereas the 
time resolution will deteriorate. The relationship between the time resolu-
tion and frequency resolution is an inverse relationship associated with 
the Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, which states that simultaneous 
improvement over time and frequency resolutions cannot be achieved [34]. 
This relationship is given as
	
f t ≥
π
1
4
	
(2.74)
where Δf and Δt are the frequency and time resolutions, respectively. An alter-
native representation of the signal called the joint time–frequency representa-
tion may provide better EEG information than is possible in either the time 
or frequency domains. Several joint time–frequency representation techniques 
have been proposed, among them the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and 
the wavelet transform (WT).
 

51
The Fundamentals of EEG Signal Processing
2.10.1  The Short-Time Fourier Transform
With the STFT, the EEG data record is first segmented into short segments, 
and then a Fourier transform is applied on each segment after modifying it 
with the right window. Accordingly, the STFT can be expressed as

(2.76)
Windows are typically selected in order to eliminate discontinuities at the 
block edges and to improve the spectral resolution.
2.10.2  Wavelet Transform (WT)
The Fourier transform uses exponential functions of the form ejωn as the 
orthogonal basis. With a Fourier transform of a time domain signal x(n), we 
obtain accurate localization of the basis functions in the frequency domain 
but with no information about the times at which these frequencies occur. 
As outlined before, one of the solutions to this problem is to implement the 
STFT. However, the inverse relationship between time and frequency resolu-
tion makes it impossible to improve the resolution simultaneously over the 
two domains. This issue can be resolved by the wavelet transform.
The Morlet–Grossmann definition of the continuous wavelet transform of 
signal x(t) is given as [35]

where Ψ(t) is a basic and unique function called the mother wavelet, {.}* denotes 
the complex conjugate, a > 0 is the dilation parameter, and b is the translation 
parameter. If a > 1, then Ψ is stretched along the time axis, and if 0 < a < 1, 
then Ψ is contracted. The waveforms generated from the different values 
of a are called the analyzing waveforms. Wavelet coefficients represents the 
similarity between the wavelets at different dilations and translations and 
the signal x.
Among the various mother wavelets, or simply wavelets, the Morlet and 
the Mexican hat are the most popular. Morlet’s wavelet is a complex wave-

Figure 2.9 shows the wavelet transform of the epileptic EEG signal of 
Figure 2.5, showing the change in frequency upon the start of the seizure. 
For a correct view of the time axis, it should be scaled by the sampling time 
(T = 1/265 s).
2.11  Nonlinear Descriptors of the EEG Signals
Generally speaking, the head acts as a mixing medium of a large number 
of locally generated EEG signals at the different positions of the sensors 
over the scalp. The changes in brain metabolism as a result of biological and 
physiological changes may alter the mixing process, making the brain, as a 
system, act on the signals in a nonlinear way. Analysis of such a complicated 
nonlinear system through system modeling is extremely difficult. Therefore, 
it appears that using the existing methods within the framework of nonlin-
ear dynamics and higher-order statistics for the study of nonlinear systems, 
is a viable alternative. Where the nonlinear dynamics measure complexity 
­(correlation dimension and ­stability), Lyapunov and Kolmogorov entropy 
quantifies critical aspects of the dynamics of the brain [34]. On the contrary,

sure the nonlinear interactions between the components of the signal or 
between signals.
2.11.1  Higher-Order Statistics for EEG Data Analysis
It is clear that power spectrum estimation based on second-order statistics 
is a powerful tool that provides sufficient information about the frequency 
content of the undergoing process. However, this is only applicable if the 
process is a linear Gaussian process and the phase is not of interest. When 
the process is nonlinear or when accurate detection of the phase differences 
is required, analysis going beyond the second-order statistics needs to be 
performed. Generally speaking, there are four major application areas for 
higher-order statistics: (1) suppress additive colored Gaussian noise with 
unknown PSD; (2) extract information due to deviations from Gaussianity; 
(3) reconstruct nonminimum phase information; and (4) characterize nonlin-
ear properties in signals and identify nonlinear systems [37,38].
The first application area stems from the property that the higher-order 
spectra, known as polyspectra and defined in terms of higher-order statistics 
(cumulants), are zero for Gaussian signals. If a non-Gaussian signal, such as 
the event-related potentials (ERPs), is received along with Gaussian-colored 
noise, such as EEG signals, then the transformation of ERP + EEG into the 
higher-order cumulants will eliminate the EEG signal from the polyspec-
tra. The second application area is based on the zero higher-order spectra of 
Gaussian signals, which enables the polyspectra to store information about 
the non-Gaussian components of the signals. This can be used in signal 
recognition, where distinct features can be extracted from the cumulants’ 
domain. The third application area is based on the fact that polyspectra pre-
serve the phase information of the signal regardless of whether the phase is 
minimum phase or not, contrary to second-order moments (autocorrelation), 
where phase information is preserved only if the phase of the signal is mini-
mum. Finally, the cumulants and higher-order spectra can be used to ana-
lyze the nonlinearity of a system operating under random input. Polyspectra 
can play a major role in the detection and characterization of nonlinearity in 
a system from its output [38].
2.11.1.1  Definitions and Properties
In this section, the definitions and the properties of the higher-order statis-
tics (moments and cumulants) and their spectra are introduced.
If x(n) is a real stationary and its moments up to order k exist, then the 
k-order moment function is given as
	
Mk (τ1, τ2, …, τk−1) = E {x (n) x (n + τ1) ... x (n + τk−1)}	
(2.80)
 

54
EEG/ERP Analysis
Clearly, the second-order moment, M2(τ1), is the autocorrelation of x(n), 
whereas M3(τ1, τ2) is the third-order moment and M4(τ1, τ2, τ3) is the fourth-
order moment.
The kth-order cumulants function of a non-Gaussian stationary random 
process x(n) is given as

signal that has the same mean value and correlation sequence as x(n). This 
is the reason why the cumulants have zero value if the process is Gaussian.
The following are the relationships between moments and cumulants for 
k = 1, 2, 3:

Cumulants that are higher than third order are also important and have 
many applications. For example, if the process is symmetrically distributed 
(e.g., Laplace, uniform, Gaussian), then the third-order cumulants are zero; 
hence, we must use the fourth-order cumulants. In addition, in some cases 
the third-order cumulants are extremely small, and much larger values can 
be obtained through the fourth-order cumulants.
Figure 2.10 shows the third-order cumulants of the epileptic data of 
Figure 2.5, respectively, before and during the seizure.
Figure 2.10 shows clearly the significant increase in the values of third-
order cumulants during epileptic seizure in comparison to their values 
before the start of the seizure.

The Fundamentals of EEG Signal Processing
Higher-order spectra are defined either in term of moments (moment 
spectra) or in term of cumulants (cumulant spectra). In the case of sto-
chastic signals, cumulant spectra are usually used, and in the case of 
­deterministic signals, the moment spectra are used. Higher-order spectra 
are multidimensional Fourier transform of the higher-order statistics. The 
second-order ­cumulant-related spectrum is called the power spectrum and 
is given as

where │ω1│≤ π, │ω2│≤ π, │ω1 + ω2│≤ π.
The bispectra are generally complex functions; that is, they have magni-
tude and phase.
Cumulant spectra are more efficient in analyzing random processes for the 
following reasons:
•	 The bispectrum is zero if the process is Gaussian, so it can be used 
as a measure of non-Gaussianity.
•	 In the case of a white noise process, the cumulants are multidi-
mensional impulse functions, and bispectra are multidimension-
ality flat.
•	 The bispectrum quantifies the presence of quadratic phase coupling 
between two frequency components in the signal. Two frequencies’ 
components are quadratically phase-coupled when a third compo-
nent, whose frequency and phase are the sums of the frequencies 
and phases of the two components, respectively, exists in the bispec-
trum. Because the bispectrum represents the product of tuple of 
three Fourier components in which one frequency equals the sum of 
the two frequencies, peaks in the bispectrum indicate the presence 
of quadratic phase coupling.
Figures 2.11 shows the bispectrum of the epileptic EEG data in Figure 2.5 
in 2D plots.
Figures 2.12 shows the bispectrum of the epileptic EEG data in Figure 2.5 
in 3D plots.
The results in Figures 2.11 and 2.12 show clearly the higher values of the 
magnitude of the bispectrum and the greater concentration of its energy in 
certain bands during the seizure than before the start of the seizure.

The Fundamentals of EEG Signal Processing
The biocoherency function is also useful in the detection and charac-
terization of nonlinearities in a time series and in discriminating linear 
processes from nonlinear ones [38]. The signal is a linear non-Gaussian 
process of order three if the magnitude of the biocoherency function is 
constant over all frequencies; otherwise, the signal is said to be a nonlinear 
process [38].
In Figures 2.13 and 2.14, the bispectrum of the data in Figure 2.5 is shown, 
respectively, in 2D and 3D plots.

However, this section will show that a nonlinear dynamical system with 
chaotic behavior can be studied and understood from the measured EEG 
data, even if the model is unknown or too complex. This can be achieved 
through the deterministic chaos theory.
Chaotic systems have an apparently noisy behavior but are in fact ruled 
by deterministic laws. They are characterized by their sensitivity to initial 
conditions. This means that similar initial conditions give completely dif-
ferent outcomes after some time. Several methods were developed in order 
to calculate the degree of determinism (or random nature), complexity, cha-
oticity, and so on of these signals. Among these, the correlation dimension, 
Lyapunov exponents, and Kolmogorov entropy have been the most popular. 
In this section, the mathematical background of these methods and their 
application to the study of EEG signals have been discussed.

2.11.3.1  Definitions
State space: It is a common practice to generate the state space portrait of the 
system in order to visualize its multidimensional dynamics. A state space is 
created by treating each time-dependent variable of the system as one com-
ponent in the vector space [39]. In classical mechanics, the state space is the 
space of all possible states of a physical system. By “state,” we mean the posi-
tions of all the objects in the system and their velocities or momenta.
In general, the state space is identified with a topological manifold, and an 
n-dimensional state space is spanned by a set of n vectors called embedding 
vectors. Each point in the state space represents the instantaneous state of the 
system. However, for the most dynamic systems, the state vectors are con-
fined to a subspace of the state space, and their evolution with time creates 
curves that are commonly called attractors [40].
Attractor: A set of states of a dynamic system toward which the system 
tends to evolve, regardless of the initial conditions of the system. According 
to their topology, several types of attractors can be distinguished.
Point attractor: The attractor consists of a single state. A typical example is 
a damped pendulum that has come to rest after some time.
Periodic attractor: The attractor consists of a finite set of states, where the 
evolution of the system results in cyclic movement through each state. The 
ideal orbit of a planet around a star is a periodic attractor. A periodic attrac-
tor is also called a limit cycle.
Strange attractor: It is an attractor that is sensitive to initial conditions and 
evolves through the set of possible physical states in an aperiodic (chaotic) 
way. Most real physical systems involve strange attractors, and signals cor-
responding to strange attractors have a random appearance.
The geometric characteristics of the attractors give valuable information 
about the nonlinear behavior of the system. Different methods were pro-
posed to study the systems in state space, among them were the correlation 
dimension and the Lyapunov exponents [41,42].
2.11.3.2  Reconstruction of the State Space
In principle, in order to have a complete description of the nonlinear dynam-
ics of a system, a simultaneous measurement of all the state variables is 
required. Unfortunately, in many real applications, one has no information 
about these variables and their values at certain times. Instead, we have mea-
surements in terms of a time series of the output of the system, which has 
a relationship with the state variables of the system, but this relationship 
is not known. Fortunately, Taken [43] has managed to show that we may 
reconstruct the dynamics of a deterministic finite-dimensional system from 
its output measurements.
Let us denote the state space of a dynamic system as M. The state of the sys-
tem at time n, denoted as sn ∈ M, evolves according to sn+1 = f (sn). The system 
 

62
EEG/ERP Analysis
is observed using a smooth measurement function y:M→R giving a scalar 
time series yn = g(sn). The purpose of the so-called method of delays is to 
reconstruct the state space M from the time series. Because M is high dimen-
sional and each component of yn is only one dimensional, it is evident that in 
order to obtain a suitable state space, we need to group different elements of 
the time series. The most straightforward way of doing this is to take succes-
sive yn values to create a vector:
	
y
y
y
y
...
n
n
n
n
m
–
– (
–1)
=
τ
τ
	
(2.89)
where τ indicates the interval of the time series that creates the ­reconstructed 
state space (lag time). Usually τ is chosen to be the first zero of the auto-
correlation function or the first minimum of the mutual ­information [44]. 
Commonly, the number of components m is referred to as the embedding 
dimension. Although the data are embedded in m-dimensional space, it is not 
necessarily to fill in that space. Sometimes the system defines a nonlinear 
hypersurface in which the state variables exist. The dimension of this hyper-
surface is often referred to as a topological or local dimension, d. Takens 
proved that ideal systems (an infinite number of points without noise) 
converge to the real dimension if m ≥ 2d+1 [43]. According to Sauer et al., 
in ­practical cases m ≥ d+1 can be enough to reconstruct the original state 
space [45].
2.11.3.3  Correlation Dimension
The estimation of the local dimension d of an attractor from the corre-
sponding data series is an important measure of its complexity. One of the 
­estimators of d of an attractor is the correction dimension D.
The correlation dimension quantifies the complexity of attractor in the state 
space, where a larger correlation dimension corresponds to a larger degree 
of complexity and less self-similarity. Generally speaking, the correlation 
dimension has finite values for deterministic signals and infinite values for 
stochastic signals, so it is a good parameter for evaluating the deterministic 
or chaotic nature of a system.
The frequently used method to estimate the correlation dimension was 
introduced by Grassberger and Procaccia [46,47]. They defined the correla-
tion sum for a collection of points (i = 1,2, …, N) in some state space to be the 
fraction of all possible pairs of points that are closer than a given distance 
ε in a particular norm:

where Θ is the Heaviside step function, Θ(y) = 0 if y = 0 and Θ(y) = 1 if y > 0. 
The summation counts the pairs of points (yi, yj) whose distance is smaller 
the ε. In the limit of an infinite amount of data (i.e., N → ∞) and for small 
ε, C scales like a power law: C(ε) ∝ εD, where D is known as the correlation 
dimension. Thus, D is defined as

(2.91)
It is clear that Equation 2.91 cannot be satisfied with real data, and an 
approximation has to be made.
2.11.3.4  Lyapunov Exponents
Another useful tool for characterizing the attractor is Lyapunov exponents, 
which provide a quantitative indication of the level of chaos of a system. 
It measures the exponential divergence (positive exponents: chaotic motion) 
or convergence (negative exponents: regular motion) of two initially close 
state space trajectories with time. In other words, they measure the degree 
of unpredictability of the future. This means that the more rapidly two tra-
jectories diverge, the more chaotic the system and the more sensitive it is to 
initial conditions.
There are many different Lyapunov exponents for a dynamical system. 
The most important is known as the maximal Lyapunov exponent (Lmax). Usually, 
only this exponent is computed.
If it is positive, trajectories will diverge; otherwise, they will get closer, 
reaching a nonchaotic attractor. Thus, for an attractor to be chaotic, at the very 
least the maximum Lyapunov exponent, Lmax, should be positive. Lyapunov 
exponents also give an indication of the period of time in which predictions 
are possible, and this is strongly related to the concept of information theory 
and entropy.
Many techniques were proposed to estimate Lmax, among them is the Wolf’s 
algorithm [42]. With Wolf’s algorithm, a set of m-dimensional embedding 
vectors that span the state space must be first constructed. These vectors are 
constructed as follows [43]:
	
s(t) = [ s(t), s(t−τ), … , s(t−(m−1)τ) ]	
(2.92)
where τ is a fixed time increment and m is the embedding dimension. After 
reconstruction of the state space through the embedding vectors, the near-
est neighbor is searched for one of the first embedding vectors. Once the 
neighbor and the initial distance (L) is determined, the system is evolved 
forward for some fixed time (evolution time), and the new distance (L′) is 
calculated. This evolution is repeated, and the distances are calculated until 
 

64
EEG/ERP Analysis
the separation becomes greater than a certain threshold. Then a new ­vector 
(replacement vector) with approximately the same ­orientation as the first 
neighbor and as close as possible to it is searched. Finally, Lyapunov expo-
nents can be estimated using the following formula [34]:

where δsi,j (0) = s(ti) s(tj), │δsi,j (Δt)│ = │s(ti + Δt) − s(tj + Δt)│ represents the dis-
tance between the reference trajectory (fiducial) and the perturbed trajectory, 
s(ti) is a point at the fiducial trajectory, δsi,j (0) is the displacement vector at the 
initial time, Δt is the evolution time,
ti = t0 + (i−1) Δt, and tj = t0 + (j−1) Δt, where i ∈ [1, Na] and j ∈ [1, Na] with j ≠ i. 
The term Na represents the number of local Lmax estimated every Δt within 
the duration T data segment.
2.11.4  Dynamical Analysis of EEG Signals Using Entropy
As previously outlined, a system is defined as chaotic if its attractor is sen-
sitive to the initial conditions. This means that it evolves along two com-
pletely different trajectories even if the initial conditions are very close to 
each other. The entropy is another mathematical tool that can be used to 
assess the level of chaoticity in nonlinear systems, with higher entropy 
values representing a more chaotic system and lower values representing 
a close-to-deterministic system. On the contrary, the entropy may also be 
used to assess the uncertainty in signals, where higher values indicate less 
predictability (more noisy), and lower values indicate high predictability 
(less noisy). In EEG applications, entropy has been used to analyze epilep-
tic seizures [48,49], Alzheimer’s disease [50], and Parkinson disease [51]. 
Compared with the correlation dimension and Lyapunov exponents, the 
calculation of entropy requires less data.
Mathematically, the entropy of a discrete signal x(n) is given as

where N is the number of samples, and p{.} represents the probability dis-
tribution function. One of the simplest methods of obtaining the approxi-
mate probability distribution function of the data set x(n) is to use the 
histogram [34].
So far, we have been discussing tools for single time series analysis (uni-
variate) of the EEG signal. In the rest of this chapter, we extend the analyti-
cal tools of the EEG signals to two time series, which is known as bivariate 
analysis.

2.12  Bivariate Analysis of EEG Signals
Bivariate analysis is one of the simplest forms of the quantitative analysis 
of two variables in order to determine the relationship between them and 
accordingly to find to what degree they are related to each other. In this brief 
discussion of the bivariate analyses of EEG signals, we outline the normal-
ized cross-covariance, coherency, and synchronization because they are the 
most popular among the bivariate descriptors in EEG applications.
2.12.1  Normalized Cross-Covariance Function
The cross-correlation function is a widely used measure of the interdepen-
dence between two signals in neuroscience. Suppose that x(n) and y(n) rep-
resent two real-time random variables, then the cross-correlation function is 
given as
	
rxy (m) = E [x(n + m) y(n)]	
(2.95)
where E {.} is the expected value operator. Frequently, the mean values of 
the two random variable x and y are subtracted, and the resultant formula is 
called the cross-covariance:
	
cxy (m) = E {[x (n + m) − μx] [y(n) − μy]}	
(2.96)
Although the covariance function in Equation 2.96 does provide informa-
tion on the linear relationship between the two random variables x and y, 
the magnitude of the function does not reflect the strength of the relation-
ship, because it is not scale free. There is a scale-free version of the covari-
ance called the normalized cross-covariance that is widely used in statistics and 
given as
	
cxy ( )
( )
= σ σ
m
c

(2.97)
where σx and σy are the standard deviations of the random variables x and y, 
respectively. For any two random variables, we have
	
cxy (
)
−≤
≤
1
m
1

	
(2.98)
If the two random variables are closely related to each other, the nor-
malized covariance function will be close to +1, and if they are close but 
with opposite polarity, the normalized covariance function will take val-
ues close to −1. On the contrary, if the two random variables are weakly 
 

66
EEG/ERP Analysis
related to each signal, the normalized covariance function will take ­values 
close to zero. However, it is important to indicate that the normalized 
covariance function can only capture the linear relationship between the 
random variables, and a value of zero simply means there is no linear 
relationship.
Different estimators were proposed to estimate the normalized covari-
ance function in Equation 2.98, among them the unbiased estimator, which 
is given by

In order to show the mutual relationships between the various lobes of the 
brain during an epileptic seizure, the normalized cross-covariance functions 
between the temporal, occipital, and frontal lobes for the left-temporal EEG 
data in Figure 2.5 are calculated and depicted in Figure 2.15.

between the different frequencies of the signal. This is particularly interest-

2.12.3  Phase Synchronization
In the classical sense, synchronization means the adjustment of frequencies 
of periodic self-sustained oscillators due to weak interaction. This effect is also 
referred to as phase locking. During the last 15 years, the notion of synchro-
nization has been generalized to the case of interacting chaotic oscillators.

EEG/ERP Analysis
Where the interaction of two or more chaotic systems means that their states 
can coincide, while their dynamics in time remains chaotic [53,54]. This inter-
action between the chaotic oscillators may vary between high and slight syn-
chronization. Generally speaking, the effect of phase ­synchronization of chaotic 
systems is mostly described in a similar way to synchronization of periodic 
oscillations, where only the phase locking is important, with no restriction on 
the amplitudes [55]. This allows one to describe both effects within a common 
framework.
Classically, the synchronization of two periodic oscillators x and y is under-
stood through their phase locking, which reads as follows:

where n and m are integers, and φx, φy are the phases of two oscillators, and 
φn,m is the phase difference, or relative phase. Note that for the determination 
of synchronous states, it is irrelevant whether the amplitudes of both oscilla-
tors are different or not. We say that x and y are m:n synchronized if the (n,m) 
phase difference of Equation 2.101 remains bounded for all t. And in most 
cases, only (1:1) phase synchronization is considered. The phase synchroni-
zation index is defined as follows [56]:

to one for a close-to-constant phase difference.

3.1  Event-Related Potential Extraction
3.1.1  The Averaging Technique
In most event-related potential (ERP) studies, the averaging technique is 
used twice for ERP extraction. First, the trials are averaged separately for 
each experimental condition and for each participant. We can call this proce-
dure average within subject; through this step, we get the averaged file. This step 
extracts the ERPs from the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal, because the 
EEG signal is usually larger, and the ERPs are contained in it, which prevents 
the ERPs from being directly revealed in one or too few trials. The second 
time, all the individual participants’ ERP files are averaged into one file. We 
can call this step average between subjects; the result of this step is usually 
named as the grand average file.
Average within subject. Figure 3.1 illustrates this procedure. Although 
the signal of each trial (left column in Figure 3.1) has already gone through 
filter, artifact detection, and bad channel replacement, which help to eliminate 
the noise and other artifacts to some extent, these epochs varied from one 
to another, and it is hard to detect the ERP components. As these epochs

are time-locked and aligned with respect to the stimuli, they can be averaged 
together easily in a point-by-point manner. The right column of the figure 
shows the ERP waveform gradually presenting when more and more trials 
were averaged together.
The logic behind the averaging procedure is as follows. The EEG data of a 
single trial consists of an ERP waveform and random noise. The ERP wave-
form is elicited by the stimulus, and it is assumed to be identical in shape 
and phase, whereas the noise is assumed to be completely unrelated to the 
time-locking event. Therefore, if several trials are averaged together, the ERP 
waveform can be retained, whereas the noise would be canceled out to some 
extent. As more and more trials are included for averaging, the noise remain-
ing in the averaged waveform becomes smaller and smaller. Mathematically 
speaking, if the amount of noise in a single trial is R and the number of trials

is N, then the size of the noise in an average of the N trials will be decreased 
to R
N , while the signal elicited by the experimental stimulus is assumed 
to be unaffected by the averaging processing. That is, the signal-to-noise 
ratio (SNR) increases as a function of the square root of the number of trials.
However, the relationship between the number of trials and the SNR is 
rather sobering. Taking Figure  3.1 as an example, the difference between 
trial 1 alone and the average of trials 1 and 2 is obvious; the ERP waveform 
looks much better and more stable in the average of trials 1 and 2. Hereafter, 
the improvement is slow. Even the difference between the average of trials 
1 to 8 and the average of trials 1 and 2 is not very obvious. In fact, although 
the number of trials included into these two averages differ by a factor of 
4 (8:2), the SNRs of two averages differ by only a factor of 2 (
)
8 :
2 . On 
the contrary, considering the participants’ psychological variables, increas-
ing the number of trials by repeated presentation of the stimuli is also a 
constraint, because the meaning of the stimulus might change for the par-
ticipants if it repeats too many times; the participants may find the dull rep-
etition unbearable. Therefore, improving the SNR of the data by decreasing 
sources of noise is much easier and more important than by increasing the 
number of trials.
Furthermore, we should remember that the basic assumptions for the tech-
nique of extracting an ERP signal by averaging trials are unrealistic. These 
assumptions are that (1) the ERP to the time-locking stimulus is the same on 
every trial and (2) only the EEG noise varies from trial to trial. First, if the 
EEG noise is due to some constant interference variable, it is not randomly 
presented and cannot be canceled by averaging. Second, the ERP to the stim-
ulus could vary for many reasons even if the stimuli presented are all the 
same; the participant cannot react identically to the stimulus for the whole 
experiment. Therefore, there is also trial-to-trial variability in the amplitude 
and the latency of the ERP component.
In most cases, such violations of the assumption for the trials averaging are 
not problematic. For example, even if the amplitude of one ERP component 
varies from trial to trial, this component wave in the averaged ERP wave-
form will simply reflect the average amplitude of this component, which is 
meaningful for most studies. In fact, most studies base their conclusions on 
averaged data. However, trial-to-trial variability in latency is sometimes a 
significant problem, especially when the amount of latency variability differs 
across experimental conditions. If two experimental conditions differ in the 
amount of latency variability for some component, even if the amplitudes of 
this component are the same on the single trial, the amplitude of this compo-
nent in the averaged waveform of these two experimental conditions will be 
different. If the ERP component has greater latency variability in one experi-
mental condition, the amplitude of the ERP component in the averaged data 
for this experimental condition would be smaller.
There are several ways to mitigate the effect of latency variability, for example, 
(1) by measuring the mean amplitude instead of the peak amplitude for one component 
 

76
EEG/ERP Analysis
in the averaged data. Usually, the peak amplitude of one component is more 
­sensitive to its latency jitter. It is feasible to cover one ­component in various tri-
als by measuring the mean amplitude of a specific time window for this com-
ponent. Sometimes we can use the adaptive mean amplitude instead to prevent 
the mixing of other components in one time window. Two steps are included 
in adaptive mean amplitude measurement. The first is to find the peak of one 
component; the second step is to measure the mean amplitude in a restricted 
time window (e.g., 80 ms) centering on the peak. (2) Adopting response-locked 
instead of stimuli-locked averages. In a response-locked average, the response 
rather than the stimulus is used to align the single-trial EEG epochs during 
the averaging process. This method is used when the participants’ response 
time varies greatly from trial to trial, and particularly when the response times 
are correlated with the latency variations of the ERP component of interest. 
(3) Time-frequency analysis. When we perform traditional averaging for trials 
directly, some neural activities are lost because they are not phase locked to the 
time-locking event. The non-phase-locked oscillation information could only 
be obtained by time-frequency analysis; that is, by measuring the power of the 
neural oscillation activity in a specific frequency band on single trials and then 
averaging these power measures across trials. Wavelet analysis is one of the 
widely used methods of performing such a time-frequency analysis.
Average between subjects. An ERP experiment usually requires a suf-
ficient number of participants. In most of the current publications, the par-
ticipants range from 15 to 30 persons for one ERP experiment. Further, the 
conclusion of the paper is based on the averaged data of all these ­participants. 
On the contrary, the figure of this averaged ERP waveform would usually 
be presented on the publication. We call this averaged ERP waveform the 
grand average ERP waveform, which is used to refer to a waveform created 
by ­averaging together the averaged waveforms of the individual subjects. 
This procedure can be named the average between subjects. Similar to aver-
aging trials that help mitigate some random noise in each trial, averaging 
the ERP of subjects helps to mitigate some random noise in each subject. 
Figure 3.2 shows the effect of averaging the ERP between subjects.
Figure 3.2 shows that the ERP waveforms become smaller and smoother 
as more subjects are included for averaging, because averaging masks the 
variability and spreads the similarity across the subjects. It helps to pick out 
the ERP component and to set the time window for measuring the mean 
amplitude of an ERP component. However, it is better to check whether this 
­general time window setting is suitable for each single subject. Furthermore, 
we should pay attention to the fact that some of the subject’s variability 
might not be attributed as noise. For example, participants’ age, mindset, 
psychopathology, and personality might affect their ERP response. This field 
of individual difference is worthy of an ERP study.
In summary, the averaging technique is an easy and simple way to extract 
the ERP component. However, multiple trials are required and many partici-
pants as well, as it loses some non-phase-locked neural activity and masks 
 

77
Event-Related Potentials
some valuable variability. How to dig out the ERP information by using the 
minimum number of trials and participants is a fascinating problem for 
investigation.
3.1.2  Single-Trial Subspace-Based Technique
The ERPs are usually corrupted by the ongoing background EEG ­generated 
in the brain [1]. The EEG is a correlated type of noise (colored) and usu-
ally exists at much higher level than the ERP, with a typical SNR of −5 to 
−10 dB [2]. This makes the extraction of the ERP signal from the EEG noise 
a ­challenging issue. The conventional method of ensemble averaging does 
improve the SNR, but at the expense of a longer recording time causing dis-
comfort and fatigue to the subject under study. In fact, hundreds of response 
trials need to be gathered to obtain a satisfactorily clean ERP estimate.
In this section, we present a single-trial ERP extraction algorithm based 
on the signal subspace called the generalized subspace approach (GSA) [1].

EEG/ERP Analysis
The algorithm first uses a linear estimator in order to estimate the clean ERP 
signal by minimizing signal distortion while maintaining the residual noise 
energy below some given threshold. Next, the generalized eigendecomposi-
tion of the covariance matrices of the ERP signal and brain background EEG 
noise is used to transform them jointly to diagonal matrices. The general-
ized subspace is then decomposed into the signal subspace and the noise 
subspace. Enhancement is performed by removing the noise subspace and 
estimating the clean signal from the remaining signal subspace.

vention. Lower case boldface letters will generally refer to vectors. Uppercase

colored and additive form of noise that usually exists at a much higher level 
than the ERP, making the extraction of the ERP signal from the brain back-
ground noise a challenging process.
Let y denote the corresponding K-dimensional vector of the noisy ERP.

tains its unitary eigenvectors called the inverse Karhunen–Loeve transform 
(IKLT) in the literature, and the unitary matrix Vx
T is called the Karhunen–
Loeve transform (KLT).
In fact, the property of the KLT is that the covariance matrix of Vx

Note that for white noise with variance σn
2, the covariance matrix of Vx
T n 
(the transformation of the noise vector) is a diagonal matrix, equal to σn
2I, 
and the aforementioned estimator reduces to the Ephraim and Van Trees 
estimator [4]. However, in colored noise, each component of Vx
T n has a differ-
ent variance, and accordingly the covariance matrix (Vx
T n Vx) is not diagonal. 
This is not surprising, because Vx is the eigenvector matrix of the symmetric 
Rx, which diagonalizes Rx and not Rn.
The solution to the colored noise problem is to use a transformation that 
jointly transforms the matrix pair (Rx,Rn) to diagonal matrices. This can be 
achieved by using the generalized eigendecomposition transformation.

RxV = RnVD

Before the final form of the optimal estimator, Hopt, is considered, it is 
noteworthy that there is strong empirical evidence indicating that the trans-
formed covariance matrices of most ERP signals transformed by the gener-
alized eigenvectors of the pair (Rx,Rn) have some eigenvalues small enough 
to be considered as zeros. This can be verified by examining matrix D of 
the empirical covariance matrices, Rx and Rn. This means that the number 
of basis vectors for the ERP signal is smaller than the dimension of its vector.
The fact that some of the generalized eigenvalues of matrix D are close to 
zero indicates that the energy of the clean ERP vector is distributed among a 
subset of its coordinates, and the signal is confined to a subspace of the noisy 
Euclidean space. Because all noise-generalized eigenvalues are strictly posi-
tive, the noise fills the entire vector space of the noisy ERP. Hence, the vector 
 

82
EEG/ERP Analysis
space of the noisy ERP signal is composed of a signal-plus-noise ­subspace 
and a complementary noise subspace. The signal-plus-noise subspace or 
simply the signal subspace comprises vectors of the clean signal as well as 
those of the noise process. The noise subspace contains vectors of the noise 
process only.
Consider the covariance matrix of the clean ERP signal Rx, as a ­rank-deficient 
matrix with rank r. Assume matrix V (K × K) as the generalized eigenvectors 
of the pair (Rx,Rn). Let us partition the generalized eigenvectors matrix V 
into r vectors that span the signal subspace and (K − r) vectors that span the 
noise subspace. Mathematically, this can be expressed as V = [v1 v2], where 
V1 = [v1 v2 … vr] is a K × r matrix whose rank is r, and V2 = [vr+1 vr+2 … vK] 
is a K × (K − r) matrix. Having established the basis of the signal and noise 
subspaces through the above partition of the eigenvectors, we have to find 
the oriented energy measured in the direction of both subspaces. This can be 
achieved by partitioning the matrix of the generalized eigenvalues of (Rx,Rn) as 
D = [D1 D2], where D1 = diag(d1,d2, …, dr) and D2 = diag(dr+1, dr+2, …, dK). The diag-
onal elements of D1 represent the oriented energy measured along the column 
vectors of matrix V1, and the diagonal elements of D2 represent the measured 
energy along the column vectors of V2.
Having decomposed the vector space of the noisy ERP signal into a sig-
nal subspace spanned by the vectors of matrix V1 with oriented energy D1, 
and a noise subspace spanned by V2 with oriented energy D2, enhancement 
in the clean signal estimator Hopt in Equation 3.13 is performed by remov-
ing the noise subspace and estimating the clean signal from the remaining 
­signal subspace. This results in the following form for the linear estimator 
in Equation 3.13:

To implement Equation 3.19 for Hopt, the rank of the signal subspace r 
and the optimum value of the Langrage multiplier μ are considered a priori 
known. In the next two sections, the optimum values of r and μ are discussed.
3.1.2.1  Estimation of the Signal Subspace Dimension
As stated before, the dimension of the signal subspace is not known a priori 
and should be estimated. Many criteria have been proposed over the past 
three decades for the estimation of the signal subspace. The Akaike informa-
tion criteria (AIC) by Akaike [6], the minimum description length (MDL) by 
Schwartz and Rissannen [7,8], and the extended AIC by Wax and Kailath [9] 
are considered to be among the best. Testing the GSA with these criteria, we 
found no significant difference in its performance, so any one of them can be 
used to estimate the signal subspace dimension.

3.1.2.2  The Optimum Value of the Lagrange Multiplier
The other parameter that needs to be defined prior to the implementation 
of the proposed GSA is the Lagrange multiplier μ. Theoretically, finding the 
optimum value of μ is a complicated topic that is beyond the scope of this 
chapter. In practice, the GSA reaches its optimum performance, in terms of 
minimum errors in detecting the peaks P100, P200, and P300, when μ = 8 [1]. 
Accordingly, this value of μ will be considered for GSA implementation in 
the area of ERP detection.

3.2  Brain Activity Assessment Using ERP
In the early years of ERP study, the focus was on discovering and under-
standing ERP components rather than using them to address questions 
of broad scientific interest. Around the mid-1980s, the ERP technique was 
widely used to answer various questions in cognitive neuroscience, which 
has developed explosively since then. The questions have changed from rela-
tively general questions to the more specific step-by-step questions. In other 
words, ERP is not only used to explore the general process of cognition but 
is also applied in the field of clinical diagnosis, man–machine interaction, 
and so on.

EEG/ERP Analysis
3.2.1  Applications of P100
P100 is an early sensory-specific ERP component. For visual stimuli, it is 
­usually identified at the lateral posterior electrodes as the first positive deflec-
tion appearing between 50 and 150 ms after stimulus onset [10]. It can ­provide 
important diagnostic information regarding the functional integrity of the 
visual system, and even provide diagnostic information for some psycho-
physiological disorders.
P100 is used for diagnosing the functionality of the visual system by its 
stable character in normal people. That is, the peak latency of P100 shows 
relatively little variation between subjects, minimal within-subject inter-
ocular difference, and minimal variation with repeated measurements over 
time [11]. Therefore, having set up norms including standards of P100 mea-
surement and data based on normal sample people, we can diagnose the 
dysfunction of the visual system by comparison with the norms.
Because P100 is sensitive to nonpathophysiologic parameters such as pat-
tern size, pattern contrast, pattern mean luminance, refractive error, poor 
fixation, and so on, it is recommended that each laboratory establish its own 
normative values using its own stimulus and recording parameters; and the 
construction of a normal sample for laboratory norms should report the par-
ticipants’ age, gender, and inter-ocular asymmetry. Adult normative data 
cannot be generalized to pediatric or elderly populations; P100 in children 
should be recorded when the infant or child is in an attentive behavioral 
state and compared with appropriate age-related normal values [2].
There are also some comparison studies on P100 between people suffer-
ing from psychophysiological illness or disorders and the normal sample. 
The results might have implications for the diagnosis of these problems. For 
example, one study revealed that the amplitude of P100 was significantly 
larger in children with migraine headaches compared with other types of 
headaches. This result implies that P100 might be helpful in the work-up of a 
child with headache, particularly a young child, when the signs and symp-
toms may not be characteristic [2].
Previous study also revealed the P100 is abnormal in schizophrenic patients 
compared with the normal controls. Campanella et al. compared 14 schizo-
phrenic patients with seven normal controls in an ERP study [4]. Participants 
were confronted with a visual face-detection task, in which they had to detect 
deviant faces among a train of standard stimuli (neutral faces) as quickly as 
­possible. Deviant faces changed either with respect to emotion (same identity, 
happy, fearful, or sad expression) or with respect to identity (different iden-
tity, neutral expression). The results revealed that the schizophrenics exhib-
ited a decrease in the amplitude of P100 in response to the deviant faces.
3.2.2  Applications of N200
N200 (or N2) is a negative-going component, which is typically evoked 180 to 
325 ms following the presentation of a specific visual or auditory stimulus. 
 

85
Event-Related Potentials
This specifically evoked stimulus is usually a deviation from the prevailing 
stimulus in the form or context. Several distinct N200 potentials have been 
characterized: N2a, N2b, and N2c. In repetitive stimulus-presentation, the 
N2a is a negativity of the anterior cortical distribution; it is evoked by either 
conscious attention to, or ignoring of, a deviating stimulus; in the auditory 
oddball detection paradigms, the N2a elicited by the deviating stimulus is 
more often called the mismatch negativity (MMN). The N2b is a negativ-
ity of the central cortical distribution and only presents during conscious 
stimulus attention; the N2b does not specifically reflect a departure from a 
collection of standard stimuli, but indexes a mismatch from the template, or 
a deviation from a mentally stored expectation of the standard stimulus. The 
N2c arises frontally and centrally during classification tasks. Furthermore, 
stimuli presented in visual search tasks with specific laterality and that are 
task relevant may evoke an N2c deflection, as an index of attentional shift, in 
the occipital–temporal region of the contralateral cortex [12].
Because N200 (N2) is closely related to the attention and inhibitory process, 
it has been widely used in diagnostic studies of attention-deficit/­hyperactivity 
disorder (AD/HD). AD/HD refers to a variable cluster of hyperactivity, impul-
sivity, and inattention symptoms, which substantially affects the ­individual’s 
normal cognitive and behavioral functioning. It can be categorized into three 
subtypes: the combined type (AD/HDcom), the predominantly inattentive 
type (AD/HDin), and the predominantly hyperactive/impulsive type (AD/
HDhyp).
During a continuous performance test (CPT) in which participants respond 
to a target stimulus (e.g., when the letter X is preceded by a predefined cue 
stimulus such as the letter A), and inhibit responses to cued nontargets 
(e.g., when letters other than X follow the A), with cues requiring orienting 
and targets requiring selection for action, children with AD/HDcom were 
reported to show reduced frontal N1 and N2 amplitudes and parietal P2 and 
P3 amplitudes to target stimuli, indicating diminished evaluative and pro-
cessing capabilities [13].
3.2.3  Application of P300
The classical P300 deflection, appearing as positivity, typically emerges 
approximately 300 to 400 ms following stimulus presentation. However, the 
duration of this component may range widely from 250 to 900 ms, with the 
amplitude usually varying from 5 to 20 μV for auditory and VEPs. Its typical 
subcomponents are the P3a and the P3b.
The P3a, typically with shorter latencies and a frontally oriented topog-
raphy, is usually elicited by the more infrequently appearing stimulus of a 
two-stimulus oddball task, regardless of attentional (i.e., target or nontar-
get) status. It is supposed to reflect a passive comparator. The latency of 
the P3b is usually longer than that of the P3a, and its distribution is typi-
cally over and around the central parietal sites; the amplitude of the P3a 
 

86
EEG/ERP Analysis
will be markedly increased in response to the rare stimulus of an oddball 
­experimental ­paradigm. The P3a is proposed to reflect a match/mismatch 
with a ­consciously maintained working memory trace by indexing memory 
storage as well as serving as a link between stimulus characteristics and 
attention; the P3b is the “classical P3”; in most of previous articles, the P300 is 
used as the synonym of the P3b. The P300 might be the ERP component that 
has been most extensively studied. Beginning in the 1970s, attempts have 
been made to objectify various aspects of the disease and its pathogenesis 
via analysis of the P300. Up to now, the P300 has been applied in a wide array 
of clinical research settings.
Many studies have revealed differences in the P300 between schizo-
phrenics and normal controls. These differences are: the P300 effect size 
was smaller in amplitude and longer in latency in schizophrenics com-
pared to normal controls. The paranoid subtype demonstrated larger P300 
amplitude effect sizes than other disease subtypes, and the P300 latency 
effect size decreased with disease duration. Psychopathology severity and 
antipsychotic medications were unrelated to the P300 amplitude effect 
size [14]. One meta-analysis on 46 studies including 1443 patients and 1251 
controls also confirmed that schizophrenics have severe deficits in their 
P300 amplitude [15].
P300 characteristics have been noted to differ in subjects who engage in 
addictive behavior. In a longitudinal study, the P300 amplitude was recorded 
for 1100 adolescent twins at the age of 14 from two midline electrodes during 
a visual oddball paradigm; semi-structured clinical interviews were used 
to investigate whether these children met the criteria for any symptoms of a 
substance use disorder. These data were used to examine the amplitude of 
the P300 changes in relation to early adolescent (i.e., by age 14) onset of patho-
logical substance use (PSU), late adolescent onset of PSU (i.e., ages 14 to 18), 
misuse of different classes of substances (PSU–nicotine, PSU–­alcohol, PSU–
illicit), and the degree of PSU comorbidity. The results revealed that the 
amplitude of the P300 decreased in relation with the degree of drug class 
comorbidity, early adolescent onset PSU for all three substance classes, and 
late adolescent onset PSU for alcohol and illicit PSU [16].
P300 characteristics have even been noted to differ in subjects who are at 
risk of addictive behavior. For example, one study compared participants with 
high risk for alcoholism and participants with low risk for alcoholism with 
respect to the P300 [17]; the high-risk participants were sons of alcoholic fathers; 
the low-risk participants had no exposure to alcohol or other substances of 
abuse, and had no history of alcoholism, or other psychiatric disorder in first- 
or ­second-degree relatives; the results showed that, compared to a matched 
­low-risk group, the boys with high-risk for alcoholism exhibited attenuated 
P300 amplitudes [17].
P300 characterization has also shed light on diseases linked etiologically to 
deep brain structures, including the basal ganglia, as well as clinically evident 
dysfunction of the superficial cerebral cortex, associated in particular with 
 

87
Event-Related Potentials
spreading and advanced disease. For instance, the anterior P3a is ­attenuated 
in amplitude in patients with Parkinson’s disease [18], while the P3b was 
found to be significantly delayed for the Parkinson’s disease group when 
compared with normal controls [19]. A marked reduction or absence of P300 
­differentiating target and standard stimuli in visual search tasks is observed 
in patients with Huntington’s disease, which typically demonstrates caudate 
nuclear ­atrophy  [20]. Patients with Alzheimer’s disease, which classically 
affects temporal and associative cortex regions, exhibit prolonged P300 latency 
and attenuated P300 amplitude [21].
P300 latency may also be applied clinically as a diagnostic tool and a prog-
nostic marker for recovery after cortical insult. A small study of patients 
with ischemic stroke has shown that a delay in P300 latency correlated with 
subclinical damage to the right parietal lobe. Furthermore, the value of the 
latency in the Cz derivation, nine days after the occurrence of the cerebral 
infarction, was related to the number of mistakes made by the subjects five 
months later in the attention test [22].
3.3  Summary and Conclusions
ERPs allow researchers to gain insight into the temporal-spatial characteris-
tics of neural activity related to the component processes of behaviors such 
as selective attention, information coding, response selection, ­inhibitory con-
trol, and performance monitoring, which are usually ­respectively reflected 
by some ERP components with special ­temporal-spatial ­distributions. By 
­providing a “microscope” into the sensory, affective, and cognitive ­processes, 
ERPs provide a deeper and more objective level of analysis over and above 
overt behavioral and task performance measures, ­allowing consideration of 
typical (e.g., developmental) and atypical processes (e.g., ­clinical compared 
to healthy groups). That is the potential of ERP for diagnosis ­application. 
Further, the diagnosis provided by ERP is a ­process diagnosis; that  is, 
it can tell which stage of the participant’s affective and cognitive process is 
abnormal.
When we adopt the ERP technique as a diagnostic tool, some norm data 
are usually needed for comparison. Therefore, the ERP norm data are critical 
for its clinical application. As ERP component characteristics (such as tim-
ing, amplitude, and topography) are sensitive to various factors such as the 
physical character of the stimulus, the participants’ age, sex, and educational 
level, and so on, we should compare the participant’s ERR results with the 
norm collected from the strictly matched group and the ERP acquisition with 
the identical stimulus, procedure, measurement environment, and analysis 
parameters. It is strongly suggested that each laboratory set up its own norm 
besides referring to the universal norms.
 

88
EEG/ERP Analysis
Furthermore, as many ERP studies are conducted that compare patients 
and normal subjects, it is time to move beyond describing the ERP deficits 
associated with the syndrome—rather, we should use ERPs to probe and 
understand the underlying brain dysfunctions producing the symptom. 
On the contrary, as dense array nets with more and more electrodes are used 
for EEG-ERP acquisition, the information on the neural activity will become 
dauntingly complex and large. Digging out and understanding this informa-
tion needs good theory guided by advanced calculation techniques, and is a 
challenging and productive avenue for EEG–ERP study.

error between the calculated and measured boundary potential. This ­process 
of source estimation, which is also known as the inverse problem, is help-
ful in understanding the physiological, pathological, mental, and functional 
abnormalities, and cognitive behavior of the brain. This understanding leads 
to specifications for diagnoses of various brain disorders such as epilepsy 
and tumors. The human brain anatomy is shown in Figure 4.1 [1].
Functional imaging techniques are widely used for brain study with high 
temporal and spatial resolution. These techniques include single photon emis-
sion computer tomography (SPECT), positron emission tomography (PET), 
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), magneto ­encephalography 
(MEG), and electroencephalography (EEG) [2]. The functionalities of these 
methods are used to discover various diseases related to the central nervous 
system (CNS) that are responsible for brain dysfunction [3]. Epilepsy is the 
most important and also the most common neurological disorder related to 
brain studies, as 1% of the world population is suffering from it. Because 
epileptic activity propagates very fast, several hyper regions are seen in the 
images; therefore, a method with high temporal resolution is required to 
cope with this problem. For this, EEG is regarded as best ­noninvasive diag-
nostic tool used at epilepsy surgery centers as it has ­temporal resolution in 
milliseconds [4]. The comparison between various neuroimaging techniques 
in regard to their resolution (temporal and spatial) is shown in Figure 4.2 [5].
EEG is a neuroimaging technique that was developed by Hans Berger, a 
German physicist, in 1929, which was used to measure the electrical activity of 
the brain with the help of few electrodes [6–8]. Berger was interested in cerebral 
localization, particularly the localization of tumors in the brain [9]. However, 
Kornmuller was the first neuroscientist who discovered the significance of 
using multichannel recordings for the coverage of a wider brain region.
EEG can be defined as “a noninvasive/invasive neuroimaging technique

Brain Source Localization Using EEG Signals
the brain activity by measuring electrical signals generated with the help of 
electrodes placed on the scalp in order to diagnose/analyze different neural 
disorders (epilepsy, tumors, locating head injuries, etc.).” In other words, EEG 
is a functional imaging technique that has millisecond temporal resolution 
with measured potential differences as linear functions of source strengths 
and nonlinear functions of dipole locations. The EEG recordings can be used 
for direct, real-time monitoring of spontaneous and evoked brain activity, 
which allows for spatiotemporal localization of neuronal activity [10].
The source localization of seizure onset is very important for ­presurgical 
evaluation in epilepsy patients for neurophysiologists, neurologists, and 
­neurosurgeons. Here, scalp EEG and long-term video EEG monitoring are 
biomarkers to localize the source of seizure where electrodes are placed by an 
international 10–20 system [11]. In recent times, although we have had more 
opportunity to use dense electrode caps (sensor net) to record EEG/ERP, the 
use of silver cup electrodes for the 10–20 system has not decreased. In both scalp 
EEG and video EEG monitoring, many technicians/­neurologists are still using 
adhesive gel or collodion to put silver cup electrodes. Placement of all electrodes 
is based on underlying areas of the cerebral cortex. With the 10–20 system,

EEG/ERP Analysis
the anterior temporal areas of the right and left sides are not covered by any 
electrodes. With this system, the source of epileptiform discharges is always 
missing if the source is from the anterior temporal areas (mesial temporal 
areas). T1 (left) and T2 (right), two extra electrodes, can localize the source of 
the ictal zone mainly for mesial temporal ­seizures more accurately than sphe-
roidal electrodes [12]. Another investigation ­discovered that 59% of seizures 
come from bilateral (T1 and T2 both) electrodes, and 65.7% ­seizures arise from 
unilateral (T1 or T2) electrodes [13]. Therefore, the use of T1 and T2 electrodes 
are not ignored with the 10–20 system (Figure 4.3a). T1/T2 extra electrodes 
were used first by Silverman [14] before Chatrian et al. [15]. After that, T1/T2 
electrodes were used more ­extensively to localize the source of seizure for 
epileptic patients. We strongly recommend that T1 and T2 electrodes should 
be used to avoid any misdiagnosis and mistreatment, though some neurolo-
gists are not aware about the use of these two electrodes. To put the silver cup 
electrodes, adhesive paste or collodion is used. However, to avoid some of the 
disadvantages of adhesive paste or collodion [16] for electrode placement to 
record scalp EEG and video EEG monitoring, more advanced dense electrode 
caps were used to record EEG. Nowadays, researchers use a higher number 
of channels with EEG acquisition ­systems; not only 128-channel (Figure 4.3b) 
but also 256-­channel EEG systems [17] are used that can also cover T1/T2 
electrode locations. The source localization of seizures, therefore, is now more 
accurate than before. Technology has given us more opportunities to locate 
the source of seizures (the inverse problem) with many algorithms.
The approximation for the location and distribution of the sources 
­responsible for the electromagnetic activity inside the brain based on the poten-
tial recorded through the electrodes is one of the major problems in EEG. This 
problem is known as the source localization or the EEG inverse problem as the 
data (potentials) are given and one has to design the model from the available 
data. In other words, given a set of electric potentials from ­discrete sites on the 
surface of the head and the associated positions of those ­measurements and 
the geometry and conductivity of regions within head, the location and mag-
nitude of the current sources within the brain are ­calculated [18].
Source modeling by using EEG signals for noninvasive localization of 
­epileptogenic zones helps in clinical applications such as surgery in patients 
with partial seizures [19]. Therefore, EEG source localization has been an 
active area of research for decades. In the past few years, the source localiza-
tion method, owing to its application in clinical applications for epileptic 
­surgery, has been the subject of more than 150 research publications [20].
These publications are on software-based mathematical solutions for the EEG 
inverse problem. However, fewer than half of the publications addressed the 
clinical validation for investigation of focal epilepsy [21].
This chapter deals with the basic concepts behind the EEG inverse ­problem 
and the various algorithms that have been proposed so far. The existing 
algorithms such as minimum norm, LORETA, sLORETA, eLORETA, MUSIC, 
FOCUSS, WMN-LORETA, hybrid WMN, and shrinking LORETA-FOCUSS

are discussed thoroughly to give the reader a clear view of these methods. 
After a detailed discussion followed by the mathematical interpretation and 
physical meaning of each algorithm, the advantages and limitations of each 
algorithm are presented. Finally, tables are produced as results from the 
study for the various techniques employed.
The localization process involves the prediction of scalp potentials from 
the current sources in the brain (the forward problem) and the estimation of 
the location of the sources from scalp potential measurements (the inverse 
problem) [22]. The efforts to understand the localization problem began 
40 years ago by correlating the existing body of electrophysiologic knowl-
edge about the brain to the basic physical principles controlling the volume 
currents in conductive media [23–28].
4.1.1  Forward and Inverse Problem
In the physical world, if the data values are extracted/estimated from the 
given model with the help of physical theories applied to the model, then the 
problem is said to be a modelization problem, simulation problem, or for-
ward problem [29]. This is a straightforward procedure that requires fewer 
computations with less error because the model with a complete description 
is with us. However, the inverse problem involves predicting the model with 
the help of available measured parameters.
In the physical world, a finite amount of data are available to reconstruct a 
model with infinitely many degrees of freedom. Hence, the inverse problem 
is not unique, and there are many models that can explain the data equally 
well. On the contrary, the forward problem has a unique solution. As an 
example taken from [29], consider measurements of the gravity field around 
a planet: given the distribution of mass inside the planet, we can uniquely 
predict the values of the gravity field around the planet (forward problem). 
However, there are different distributions of mass that provide exactly the 
same gravity field in the space outside the planet. Therefore, the  inverse 
problem of inferring the mass distribution from observations of the ­gravity 
field has multiple solutions (in fact, an infinite number of solutions). Because 
of this, in the inverse problem, one needs to make explicit any a priori 
information on the model parameters. One also needs to be careful in the 
­representation of the data uncertainties.
The inverse problem is nonunique in nature, which means many models 
can fit the data. Also, the estimated data are tainted with errors, and there-
fore the estimated model always differs from the true model. The model with 
finite degrees of freedom is termed a discrete model, and the model with 
continuous data and infinite degrees of freedom is termed a continuous 
model. The model estimation and model appraisal are different for both sys-
tems. According to Hadamard [30], if a physical problem has a solution with 
uniqueness and stability, then the inverse problem is assumed to be well 
posed; otherwise, it is termed an ill-posed inverse ­problem. The majority of 
 

97
Brain Source Localization Using EEG Signals
geophysical problems are ill posed, which means they are characterized by 
nonuniqueness and instability. Therefore, it is assumed that the predicted 
model is just an approximation of the true model. The inversion problem 
consists of two steps, that is, an estimation problem and an appraisal prob-
lem [31]. Let the true data be denoted by d, the true model by m, the esti-
mated model by m, and assume that the data are tainted by error. Then one 
can frame the inverse problem as a combination of what is to be estimated 
and a relationship between the estimated and the true models, as termed 
appraisal (Figure 4.4). Therefore,
	
Inverse problem = Estimated problem + Appraisal problem.
The EEG source localization is an underdetermined ill-posed inverse 
problem as the number of unknown parameters is greater than number of 
known parameters. There exist two general approaches for localization as 
proposed by researchers. In the first approach, the signals are assumed to 
be generated by a small number of focal sources. This approach is called the 
equivalent current dipole (ECD). However, if all possible source locations are 
assumed simultaneously, the approach is known as the linear distributed 
approach [32]. There are many existing methods to solve the EEG inverse 
problem, which can be categorized according to the methodology adopted 
for the implementation of each method. Some of the methods are defined 
independently. However, other methods are either hybrid methods that mix 
the existing algorithms with the other algorithms for better results with 
fewer errors and accurate localization of sources within the brain. Figure 4.5 
shows the simplified EEG source localization model with EEG data on the 
left hand side and forward and inverse modelling at the right hand side.
Figure  4.6 shows the categorization of the various inverse methods of 
source localization using EEG signals.

4.1.2  Localization Techniques
4.1.2.1  Minimum Norm
This solution for the distributed, discrete, and instantaneous EEG inverse 
problem was suggested by Hamalainen and Ilmoniemi in 1984 [33]. The EEG 
inverse problem is solved by proposing a linear combination of magnetom-
eter lead fields as an estimate for the current distribution. The lead field Li of 
a magnetometer at location I can be defined as
	
B J
L r
J r dV
( )
( )
( )

=
⋅
	
(4.1)
The linear relationship between the magnetometer readings, current 
­distribution, and the lead fields can be expressed as follows:
	
B = LJ	
(4.2)
Hence, the shortest current vector required to explain the magnetometer 
output can be defined by multiplying the output vector B by the pseudo- 
inverse of L such that
	
=
+
J
L B 	
(4.3)
where L+ = LT(LLT)+ denotes the Moore–Penrose generalized inverse  [34]. 
The minimum norm solution was predicted for pure signals; signals 
­contaminated by noise and smoothed noisy signals. The proposed method 
estimated sources with 1 cm resolution near the central sulcus and with 
about 4 cm resolution from the midline. However, it was suggested that the 
performance of the minimum norm solution would improve if some a priori 
information or assumption such as confining the integration area within the 
cortex was provided. Furthermore by increasing the number of magnetom-
eters, better localization can be achieved.
Although the minimum norm provides good results in terms of resolu-
tion and current estimation, it fails to address the issue of deep source 
localization in the outermost cortex. This is because the minimum norm 
solution for EEG/MEG is a harmonic function, that is, ∇2J = 0. Harmonic 
functions attain maximum values at the boundaries of their domain, 
 

100

which in this case is the outermost cortex. Upon comparison with newer 
techniques such as LORETA and WMN, the minimum norm solution has 
more localization error with the disadvantage of an inability to localize 
nonboundary sources [35].
4.1.2.2  Low Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography (LORETA)
Introduced and defined by Pascual-Marqui in 1994 [36], LORETA computes 
the current distribution throughout the full brain volume. This method 
assumes the simultaneous and synchronous excitation of neighboring neu-
rons; that is, the current density at any given point on the cortex is maxi-
mally similar to the average current density of its neighbor. The discrete, 
3D distributed, linear inverse solution is provided with a much better time 
resolution but low spatial resolution.
The generalized inverse problem for the LORETA can be defined and 
explained mathematically as

tance, and diag(A11M) is a diagonal matrix whose entries are obtained from 
the matrix A11M. The set of equations explains the Laplacian ­operator used 
to implement LORETA. LORETA provides smooth and better localization for 
deep sources with less localization errors but with a low spatial resolution 
and blurred localized images of a point source with dispersion in the image. 
The low spatial resolution of LORETA is undesirable in some cases such as 
feature extraction of spatiotemporal pattern recognition, where a high resolu-
tion is needed. Also, it is shown in Ref. [36] that LORETA has a high localiza-
tion capability for localizing the boundary sources: out of 819 cases, LORETA 
localized 383 cases with zero-­localization error (47%).
4.1.2.3  Focal Underdetermined System Solution (FOCUSS)
This tomographic reconstruction technique for the solution of the ill-posed 
EEG/MEG inverse problem was proposed and explained in Ref. [37]. FOCUSS 
is a high-resolution nonparametric technique that uses the forward model 
which assigns the current to each element within a predetermined recon-
struction region. It is recursive in nature, which means that the weights are 
iterated at each step from the solution of the previous step. The mathematical 
calculations for the recursive steps in FOCUSS are done with the help of the 
WMN method. The expression for the computation of the unknown current 
element I can be given as

where W is a dimensionless n × n matrix that can be altered to produce recur-

where Iik−1 represents the ith element of the vector I at the (k−1)th ­iteration, and 
k is the index of the iteration step. The next weight matrix can be ­calculated 
by just multiplying Wk−1 by Wk to get a new matrix. It can be observed that the 
diagonal elements of the weight matrix correspond to the current elements. 
With the help of the foregoing mathematical and theoretical concepts, simula-
tions and comparisons are carried out between true, minimum norm, unbiased

minimum norm, and FOCUSS algorithms for near-surface, ­mid-depth, and 
deep sources in Ref. [37].
The FOCUSS algorithm provides better localization capability as com-
pared with the other algorithms and is able to handle nonuniquely defined 
localized energy sources. Furthermore, the FOCUSS algorithm has a better 
spatial resolution and is stable whenever subjected to changes.
4.1.2.4  Recursive Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC)
This algorithm was proposed and explained in Ref. [38]. A single dipole is 
scanned through a grid confined to a 3D head or source volume. The for-
ward model for the dipole at each grid point is projected against a ­signal 
subspace that has been calculated from the EEG measurements. The sources 
are located where the projection is best onto the signal subspace. However, 
one of the major problems with the MUSIC approach is the selection of 
the location that can provide the best projection in the practical case, as 
noise and errors are present in the signal subspace and forward model. The 
modified recursive MUSIC algorithm is the modified MUSIC algorithm as 
it can combat the limitations of MUSIC in terms of localizing synchronous 
sources through the use of the spatiotemporal independent topographies 
(IT) model.
The mathematical relationship relating the IT model and the signal ­subspace 
can be defined as [38]
	
F = AST + E

is to determine the dipole location (rho) and orientation (theta) when F is

ulation of the true and estimated data by taking noise into consideration.

(referring to signal subspace), is the weighted sum of the projections of the esti-
mated signal subspace eigenvectors, and Σe is the weighted sum of the errors. 
The recursive MUSIC algorithm and its modifications such as RAP MUSIC [39] 
provide good localization with less complexity. Furthermore, the algorithm is 
extendable with a straightaway procedure rather than a sequential way.

4.1.2.5  Hybrid WMN
This algorithm was produced and explained in Ref. [40] as a hybrid algo-
rithm with an initial reconstruction that was carried out with the help of 
the LORETA algorithm and then iterative calculations by using the FOCUSS 
algorithm. The LORETA algorithm is applied as it can localize the real 
­current density distribution under the framework of the WMN method, 
which provides a smooth solution.
The discrete result for the inverse problem in this algorithm with the 
­initialization of LORETA can be suggested as

(4.13)
where V is an N.1 matrix comprising potential differences, J comprises ­current 
densities at M points within the brain volume, K is the lead field matrix defin-
ing the relationship between the scalps measurements and the current densi-
ties, and B is the discrete Laplacian operator. The weighted matrix W can be 
defined as
	
W = Ω ⊗ I	
(4.14)
Here, I refers to the identity matrix, ⊗ denotes the Kronecker product, and 
Ω is an M × M diagonal matrix with the following diagonal elements:

The weighted iterative method is adapted to the forward problem 
to ensure the strengthening of the grid’s energy in the solution space.

Hence,  the  weighted matrix WK for the kth step can be calculated by the 
­solution Jk−1 of the (k−1)th step as

The results in Ref. [40] are provided by using a four-shell (brain, CSF, 
skull, scalp) spherical head model with related electrical conductivities. The 
­solution space has a radius of 0.84 with 729 grid points within it. The ­methods 
provide better results with initialization of LORETA and then iteration of the 
weight matrix. The LORETA provides a rough estimation of sources, and 
then the iterations improve the accuracy of the results, yielding in-depth 
localization with minimized errors and good estimation.
The disadvantage of this hybrid algorithm is heavy computations and 
repeated iterations that result in greater accuracy but at the expense of heavy 
calculations and time. Owing to continuous iterations, there is also a chance 
of loss of information and induction of noise.
4.1.2.6  sLORETA
This method is based on the assumption of the standardization of the cur-
rent density, which implies that not only the variance of the noise in the 
EEG measurements is taken into account but also that the biological vari-
ance in the actual signal is considered [41]. This biological variance is taken 
as independently and uniformly distributed across the brain, resulting in a 
linear imaging localization technique having exact, zero-localization error. 
This localization technique resembles the method provided by Dale et al. [42] 
in which the localization is provided on a standardization of the estimates 
of current density. The current density estimates are given by the minimum 
norm method as in Dale, with the localization inference based on standard-
ized values of the current density estimates. The way standardization for 
sLORETA is performed is different from Dale’s method, resulting in zero 
localization for the sLORETA.
The mathematical formulation for the sLORETA is given as

The simulations are carried out by using the Talairach human brain atlas. 
A total of 6430 voxels at 5 mm spatial resolution were produced under these 
constraints. For each dipole, there exist three unknown values, making the 
number of unknowns 3 × 6430 = 19,290 with 25 electrodes. Different local-
ization methods are compared with sLORETA, which include the minimum 
norm and that proposed by Dale et al. [42] in terms of localization errors and 
spatial spread. The simulations with noise and without noise demonstrate 
that sLORETA has far better quality with exact localization and zero-error 
localization as compared with the minimum norm and Dale methods, which 
shows that the sLORETA is a perfect first-order localization technique.

4.1.2.7  eLORETA
There have been many useful attempts to minimize the localization error by 
choosing the weight matrix in a more adequate way. However, there exists 
one methodology that gives greater importance to the deeper sources with 
reduced localization error. The study carried out in Ref. [43] shows that this 
method achieves depth weighting with reduced localization error from 12 to 
7 mm. This method was developed and recorded as a working project in 
the University of Zurich in March 2005 [44]. According to Pascual-Marqui [43], 
eLORETA is a genuine inverse solution that provides exact localization 
with zero error in the presence of measurement and structured biological 
noise. Hence, the family of linear imaging methods are parameterized by a 
­symmetric matrix C

method is elaborated by considering the actual source as an arbitrary point

ϕ = KjA	
(4.28)
where Kj is the lead field matrix, and A

The eLORETA method is standardized, which implies that its theoreti-
cal expected variance is unity. The simulations for the validation of this 
method were carried out under the free academic eLORETA-KEY software 
with data available in Ref. [43]. The results show that eLORETA is an authen-
tic localizing method with no localization bias, which provides zero-error 
localization in the case of nonideal conditions, that is, the presence of struc-
tured biological noise.
4.1.2.8  WMN-LORETA
This is the hybrid algorithm suggested and explained in Ref. [45], in which 
the WMN method is used to initialize LORETA algorithm. For the WMN 
method, the forward problem can be written as

This technique was demonstrated by using 138 electrodes distributed on 
the scalp surface with 429 sources on the cerebral volume. The simulations 
for WMN, LORETA, and hybrid WMN-LORETA are shown for comparison. 
The comparison is done in terms of the resolution matrix, that is, R = TK. 
The resolution matrix for these methods shows that the WMN-LORETA 
method has the nearest value to that of the identity matrix, which leads to 
ideal conditions for less error and greater accuracy. Also, in terms of the 
computational time, the suggested algorithm uses less computing time than 
the LORETA algorithm. Hence, the hybrid algorithm is an efficient solution 
of the EEG inverse problem.
4.1.2.9  Recursive sLORETA-FOCUSS
This is a hybrid algorithm that combines the features of sLORETA and 
FOCUSS in a recursive manner to estimate the electrical activity inside 
the brain. The algorithm is presented and explained in Ref. [46]. It 
starts with the estimation of the current density by using the sLORETA 
method. The ­current density is estimated by using the sLORETA method

FOCUSS is a recursive method in which the weight matrix is updated 
each time based on the data provided by the current density estimation of 
the previous ith iteration. This procedure is repeated (and hence the name 
“recursive”) to eliminate the nonactive areas of the brain. Hence, after this 
elimination, a new space is defined for the active area only. These steps are 
repeated until the so-called convergence criterion is met. Here, “conver-
gence” means that the number of nodes in the newly defined solution space 
is less than the number of sensors used for measurements.
The algorithm is designed and analyzed by simulation in MATLAB® by 
assuming the presence of two current dipoles in the brain, and a compari-
son is made between various localization algorithms such as sLORETA, 
FOCUSS, sLORETA-FOCUSS, and recursive sLORETA-FOCUSS. According 
to the simulated images, sLORETA produces smooth and diffused recon-
structed images for two dipoles, which shows its inability to localize the 
dipoles ­correctly. The hybrid sLORETA-FOCUSS provides exact conver-
gence to the real dipole with no localization error. However, the problem 
with this hybrid algorithm is the generation of small fake sources besides 
the space solution. The ­recursive sLORETA-FOCUSS algorithm gives the 
best solution and provides exactly the same result as the simulated dipole. 
Upon making a comparison between the said four algorithms in terms 
of the computational time taken for a method to localize the sources, 
the newly designed hybrid algorithm, recursive sLORETA-FOCUSS, is 
more time efficient as it takes 323.72 s, in contrast to sLORETA-FOCUSS 
(330.45 s) and FOCUSS (494.03 s).

4.1.2.10  Shrinking LORETA-FOCUSS
This is a hybrid algorithm combining the features of LORETA and FOCUSS 
in which the weight matrix is iterated along with the solution space, which 
is also subjected to alteration during the localization. The idea is presented 
and explained in Ref. [47]. First, the current density is computed using the 
LORETA algorithm as it provides smoothness and a relatively small localiza-
tion error. After this, the weight matrix and the solution space are recursively 
iterated. The algorithm works by estimation of the current density using 
the LORETA algorithm. Next, the weight matrix is calculated. After that, a 
smoothing operator L is introduced such that

where si denotes the number of neighboring nodes with the region defined

The smoothing operator is used for the retention of prominent nodes in the 
estimated topography. The selection of prominent nodes is done by setting 
down a threshold value in the topography. This process is repeated until 
convergence occurs. The results show that the algorithm provides recon-
struction of sources with relatively high spatial resolution as compared to 
the LORETA algorithm. The localization capability is compared with other 
algorithms in terms of the energy error (Eenrg), which is calculated as

LORETA-FOCUSS, and shrinking LORETA-FOCUSS are presented in 
Table 4.1.
4.1.2.11  Summary with Comparison Tables
After this detailed discussion of the methods described so far in the lit-
erature, it is necessary to summarize the methods. The summary can be

categorized by the author, year of publication, citations, advantages, and 
limitations of the localization method. Table 4.2 shows that LORETA is the 
most popular method for source localization even though there is still the 
disadvantage of low spatial localization. However, the methods derived 
from LORETA such as sLORETA and eLORETA have better localization 
capability but lag in terms of resolution. The hybrid weighted minimum 
norm method employs a hybridization of the minimum norm method and 
LORETA, which involves great system complexities that ultimately increase 
the required computational time. Shrinking LORETA-FOCUSS is also a 
hybrid algorithm that takes advantage of LORETA and FOCUSS, but it has 
not been validated experimentally. The other methods such as ICA, MUSIC, 
RAP MUSIC, and RCD method perform better in terms of localization but 
suffer from the disadvantages of complex computations, long computa-
tional time, and loss of data.
We will now present a feature-based comparison between various source 
localization methods in Table 4.3. The comparisons are made by different 
authors: a comparison between the LORETA, Backus and Gilbert, minimum 
norm, and WROP methods is made by Pascual in terms of the localization 
error and the estimated current density, and it shows that LORETA performs 
better than the other algorithms. The other comparison is made between 
Shrinking LORETA-FOCUSS, LORETA, and LORETA-FOCUSS by He Sheng 
Liu et  al. in terms of energy and the localization error, and it is shown 
that the shrinking LORETA-FOCUSS algorithm has a comparatively small 
localization error, resulting in better performance. The sLORETA-FOCUSS 
technique is compared with the individual sLORETA and hybrid LORETA-
FOCUSS in terms of the localization error. The other hybrid algorithms 
developed by Khemakhem et  al. such as WMN-LORETA and recursive

Fails to address the issue of deep source localization; has 
more localization error as compared to LORETA, 
WMN, etc.; incapable of localizing nonboundary 
sources.
LORETA [36]
R. D. Pascual 
et al. (1994)
High localization capability for localizing 
boundary sources and deep sources. Many 
variations are available on this basic 
localization algorithm.
Has low spatial resolution with blurred images. Low 
spatial resolution is undesirable in feature extraction of 
spatiotemporal pattern recognition. Regularization 
increases in spatial blurring.
FOCUSS [37]
I. F. Gorodnitsky 
et al. (1995)
Better localization with the capability to 
handle nonuniquely defined localized 
energy sources. Provides stable outputs.
Involves large mathematical calculations and hence high 
computational time owing to continuous iteration of 
weight matrix.
Recursive MUSIC, 
RAP MUSIC [38,39]
J. C. Mosher and 
R. M. Leahy 
(1998, 1999)
Recursive MUSIC along with its 
modifications provides better estimation 
with low localization error.
Model estimation includes random error and noise, 
which cause difficulties for true signal estimation. 
Procedure includes weighted sum of errors and noise, 
which increase complexity in the algorithm.
sLORETA [41]
R. D. Pascual 
(2002)
Exact zero-error localization as compared 
with minimum norm and Dale method.
Due to low-resolution imaging method, poor 
performance in recovering multiple sources when the 
point-spread functions of sources overlap. Also, owing 
to instability of EEG inverse problem, sometimes 
regularization is employed, which increases spatial 
blurring of LORETA and sLORETA solutions.

Shrinking LORETA-
FOCUSS [47]
L. Hesheng et al. 
(2003)
Provides better results in terms of minimized 
localization error as compared to LORETA 
and LORETA-FOCUSS algorithms.
Only evaluated on simulated data and not validated 
through real-time data.
Hybrid weighted 
minimum norm [40]
C. Y. Song et al. 
(2005)
Provides better estimation by using features 
of LORETA and WMN as iterations make 
the algorithm more accurate with in-depth 
localization and less error.
The algorithm involves large computations and 
repeated iterations which results in high computational 
time. Data could also be lost owing to continuous 
iterations of the weight matrix.
eLORETA [43]
R. D. Pascual
(2007)
Standardized method with theoretical 
expected variance as unity. Authentic 
localization technique with zero-localization 
error.
The low-resolution feature of eLORETA causes blurring 
in the images when the space is subjected to 
regularizations.
WMN-LORETA [45]
R. Khemakhem 
et al. (2008)
Hybrid method with combined features of 
LORETA and WMN, which provides better 
resolution than LORETA and WMN alone.
The system is complex and requires more computational 
time. System is valid for localization in highly active 
regions such as somatosensory evoked potentials.
Recursive sLORETA-
FOCUSS [46]
R. Khemakhem 
et al. (2008)
More efficient in terms of computational time 
and localization.
No validation provided. Results were produced on 
simulated data.

sLORETA-FOCUSS are compared with WMN, LORETA, sLORETA-FOCUSS, 
and FOCUSS, respectively, with respect to the ­computational time, resolu-
tion, and localization capability.
Before going into the section on challenges and discussion on future 
studies and better implementation of the EEG inverse problem, you should 
analyze Table 4.4, which provides a quick overview of the methods used so 
far in terms of the resolution, computational time (which corresponds to 
processing speed), validation, and localization error. The following sym-
bols are used in Table 4.4, which defines the relative features of different 
algorithms.
The methods having a low spatial resolution such as LORETA, eLORETA, 
and sLORETA are crossed, and methods having a better resolution as 
compared to others are checked. The same convention is applied to the 
computational time, as methods characterized by large iterations and 
repeated procedures (such as FOCUSS and hybrid WMN) are classi-
fied as ­nonfavorable methods for these features, so they are marked with

a cross, whereas the remaining methods, being efficient in terms of the 
­computational time, are checked. There are some methods that are just 
checked by using simulated data and so are classified as having no valida-
tion; hence, a cross is placed for these, and vice versa. The last parameter is 
the localization error, which can be regarded as the most important param-
eter for a quality check for any localization method. A better method is one 
with a smaller localization error. The localization error is compared for dif-
ferent algorithms relatively. “NA” in Table 4.4 means that the information 
is not available from the literature.
4.2  Recommendations for the Future
The EEG, an imaging technique, provides good temporal resolution for the 
reflection of the neuronal activity but poor spatial resolution, which results 
in undesirable feature whenever it is used for source localization  [46]. 
Hence, for the solution of the EEG Inverse problem, different methods are 
invented and explained by different researchers aiming at exact localiza-
tion with less error and high accuracy. However, the mathematical rela-
tions governing the methods, the results obtained, comparisons in terms 
of the computational time taken, localization ability, localization error,

EEG/ERP Analysis
energy error, system complexity, and improved resolution are important 
parameters. It can be deduced from the foregoing discussion that for the 
solution of the ill-posed EEG inverse problem, the following points are 
noteworthy:
	
1.	The designed algorithm should avoid the problem of not localizing 
the deep sources, unlike the minimum norm solution.
	
2.	The algorithm should be developed with the ability of localiz-
ing the sources with better spatial resolution, unlike the problem 
posed by LORETA (and its derived methods, such as sLORETA 
and eLORETA), because the recovery of multiple sources is diffi-
cult with low resolution. Further, due to ill-posedness of the EEG 
inverse problem, one has to employ regularization methods, which 
cause an increase in the blurring of images in the LORETA family. 
So the method should be developed with higher and improved spa-
tial resolution.
	
3.	Repeated iterations, which is an issue with some hybrid algorithms 
(LORETA-FOCUSS, sLORETA-FOCUSS, etc.) cause the system to 
become slow as the continuous iterations in the weight matrix are 
time consuming. This increases the system complexity and some-
times results in the loss of information and induction of noise. So 
the computations should be minimized to reduce the time taken and 
calculations.
	
4.	The algorithm should be validated with real-time data to confirm 
the results produced; the results obtained with simulated data are 
not good enough.
From the above discussion, it is evident that the methods applied so far 
have though provided good results and facilitated continuous improvement 
in the field of the inverse problem. Solutions are emerging, but the follow-
ing issues remain: low resolution, system complexity, slow processing, result 
validation, solution stability, and localization error. Therefore, the inverse 
problem needs to be solved with the aforementioned constraints so as to 
resolve issues related to applied neuroscience.
The following are some results showing brain activation during stimuli 
taken from the NETSTATION software package. The subject was shown 
a visual stimulus, and the EEG was taken during experiments by using a 
HydroCel Geodesic 128 channel montage and a 300 Net Amplifier of EGI 
Inc., USA. The sampling rate for the experiments was set at 250 samples per 
second with the impedance between scalp and sensors set as 50 kΩ. The 
experiments were held at the Intelligent Neuro Signal and Medical Imaging 
Laboratory, Centre for Intelligent Signal and Imaging Research (CISIR), 
Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Universiti Teknologi 
PETRONAS, Tronoh, Perak, Malaysia.

Brain Source Localization Using EEG Signals
The MRI results of the experiments were taken for LORETA and 
sLORETA with a four-shell spherical model known as Sun-Stok and finite 
difference head modeling. Sun-Stok is an isotropic four-shell spherical 
head modeling scheme. The term isotropic means that uniform conduc-
tivity is assumed for all the four shells (i.e., brain, skull, CSF, and scalp) 
involved in head modeling for the forward problem solution. However, the 
information about the radii and conductivity for each shell is predefined 
for this head modeling scheme. However, finite difference method (FDM) 
is an effective tool for solving electromagnetic boundary value problems. 
Both Sun-Stok and FDM are used for the solution of the ­forward problem, 
which further leads to an approximate location of the active source by 
using the inverse methods. Hence, LORETA and sLORETA are used with 
both head modeling schemes to produce results for comparison between 
various localization methods. The results were produced for localization 
comparison between various methods with results taken from the same 
time interval. These results show the activation in various regions of the 
brain by using LORETA and sLORETA in conjunction with standard-
ized head modeling methods. The corresponding intensity level is also 
shown in nA for every method. In Figure 4.7, where LORETA is used as 
the ­inversion technique, activation is shown in the occipital lobe. For the 
second case (Figure 4.8), with the same subject but a different ­inversion 
technique (sLORETA), the activation is shown in the occipital lobe. Unlike 
the previous result for LORETA, sLORETA exhibits a higher intensity level 
(5.35 nA) compared with the intensity level of LORETA (0.828 nA). Figure 4.9 
shows the activation results for LORETA with finite difference head mod-
eling. It again shows activation in the occipital lobe with an intensity

level of 15.78 nA. The result for sLORETA with finite difference head mod-
eling is shown in Figure 4.10. This shows activation in the occipital lobe 
with the maximum intensity level (~280 nA). Therefore, FDM-sLORETA 
exhibits the maximum intensity value for activation in the occipital lobe 
with the same time interval. It can be concluded that sLORETA with FDM 
head modeling can produce promising results. However, other numeri-
cal schemes (such as the finite element method (FEM) and the boundary

sLORETA, MUSIC, RAP MUSIC, and so on, to get better results in terms of 
less localization error and less computational complexity.

5.1  Introduction
Epilepsy is a chronic condition that is characterized by recurrent and 
­unprovoked seizures. A seizure can be defined clinically as “intermittent 
paroxysmal, stereotyped disturbance of consciousness, behavior, emotion, 
motor function, perception, or sensation, which may occur singly or in 
combination and is thought to be the result of abnormal cortical neuronal

­discharges.” The exact type of seizure will depend on where it starts and 
then spreads within the brain. Abnormalities in synaptic transmission, neu-
ronal excitability, voltage gated ion channels, neuronal proteins, and gene 
expression are all implicated in the pathogenesis of epilepsy.
According to the WHO, epilepsy is the most common primary disorder of 
the brain. More than 50 million people in the world are affected by epilepsy, 
and 80% of them are in developing countries. About 70% of epilepsy cases 
can be treated effectively, but 30% generally remains refractory to medical 
treatment and constitute a heavy burden on the quality of life of the suf-
ferer and the caregiver and an economic burden on health delivery systems. 
Alternative treatment options for these patients are surgical removal of the 
epileptogenic tissue or vagal nerve stimulation.
5.2  Types of Epileptic Seizures
Seizures are categorized into two main groups based on the involvement of 
the brain region responsible for the seizure. Generalized seizures involve 
almost the whole brain, whereas focal seizures, also called partial seizures, 
start from a particular brain region and may spread from there to other parts 
of the brain. Generalized seizures are further classified into petit mal, tonic–
clonic, myoclonic, and atonic seizures. Partial seizures are classified into

They do not cause loss of consciousness, but they may be a warning 
sign of more serious seizures in the future.
•	 Complex Partial Seizures: Complex partial seizure is an epileptic sei-
zure that is associated with unilateral cerebral hemisphere involve-
ment and causes impairment of awareness or responsiveness (i.e., 
alteration of consciousness).
5.3  Electroencephalography and Epileptic Seizure Detection
Different techniques are used to detect epileptic seizures including electro-
encephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and functional 
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Among them, EEG is the most widely 
used as it is cheaper and offers a high temporal resolution. Most of the work 
in epileptic seizure detection is based on EEG in conjunction with machine 
learning tools. The next section will discuss the most relevant studies on 
seizure detection using EEG signals. Figure 5.2 shows the signals of 17-EEG 
channels at the start of epileptic seizure.

5.3.1  Seizure Detection Algorithms
Various studies have been done in the past two decades for the detection of 
epileptic seizures using EEG. Nasehi and Pourghassem [1] have surveyed sev-
eral automated algorithms for the detection of epileptic seizures based on the 
scalp EEG and ECG signals up to 2011. They suggest that there are two types 
of seizure detection: epileptic seizure onset detection and epileptic seizure 
event detection, both of which have patient-specific or ­non-patient-specific 
applications. Seizure event detectors identify seizures with a higher percent-
age of accuracy but not with the shortest ­possible delay [2]. Seizure onset 
detectors identify the start of seizure with the shortest possible delay, but 
these algorithms are not usually as accurate as seizure event detectors [3].
Moreover, there are separate studies on seizure detection algorithms based 
on the intracranial EEG. Usually, it is seen that intracranial ­epileptic ­seizure 
­detection gives better results as compared to the scalp EEG, but ­placement 
of intracranial electrodes requires surgery and can only be used in ­specific 
monitoring conditions in hospitals. Accordingly, an efficient ­seizure detec-
tion algorithm using the scalp EEG is required so that seizure detection for 
­immediate epilepsy treatment can be improved. In general, seizure detection 
algorithms can be divided into two major classes—(i) seizure event detec-
tors and (ii) ­seizure onset detectors. The two classes of seizure detectors are 
shown in Figure 5.3.
5.3.1.1  Seizure Event Detection
Seizure event detectors are meant for the detection of epileptic seizures in 
EEG signals. They usually have good accuracy but unsatisfactory latency 
in detecting the onset of a seizure. These algorithms are used by physicians 
to monitor the duration and frequency of seizures of individual patients [4]. 
This may allow them to prescribe better medication to suppress the disorder.
In 1992, Liu et al. [5] developed a patient-independent algorithm to detect 
neonatal seizures from EEG. Autocorrelation analysis was used to differ-
entiate between the seizure activity and the normal background EEG. EEG 
data from 14 infants were recorded using a 12-channel EEG amplifier and 
divided into 30 s epochs, with 58 epochs containing seizures and 59 epochs 
for control EEG being selected for further analysis. No preprocessing was

applied on the raw EEG data. Some of the control EEG epochs contained 
some common EEG artifacts such as eye blinks and respiratory artifacts 
that coincide with seizure activities and may account for false detections, 
but it was proved in terms of results that the developed technique is robust 
to these periodic and rhythmic activities as these are of low amplitude and 
minimal duration. Scored autocorrelation moment (SAM) analysis was per-
formed for performance evaluation of the developed technique as it provides 
a measure of the periodicity of a signal. The sensitivity and specificity of the 
system were 84% and 98%, respectively, and 9 out of 58 test seizure epochs 
were falsely classified as nonseizure epochs.
In 1997, Gotman et al. [6] developed a system for neonatal seizure detection 
that consists of three different methods of detecting rhythmic patterns at dif-
ferent frequencies and different spike patterns. EEG data were taken from 43 
newborns recorded at three different children’s hospitals. In the first method, 
the EEG was divided into epochs of 10 s shifting forward with a 75% overlap. 
For each epoch, the frequency spectrum was calculated, and the frequency 
of the dominant peak was calculated. The dominant peak was defined as 
the peak with the largest average power in the full width half maximum of 
that peak. The width of the dominant peak was calculated, and if it had a 
small width, it was represented as a rhythmic activity. The power ratio was 
calculated between the power of the band of the dominant peak and the 
power of the same frequency band in the background spectrum. The second 
method consisted of multiple spike detection [7], and a seizure was declared 
if six spikes were detected in an epoch of 10 s. The third method considered 
the detection of very slow rhythmic activities that were not detected by the 
first method. The EEG was filtered with a 2nd order low-pass filter of cutoff 
frequency 1 Hz. The system gave an average seizure detection rate of 71% 
when all the three methods were combined. The average false detection rate 
was 1.7 FD/h. In another publication [8], this methodology was reapplied on 
a completely new data set with 54 neonatal patients, and the average seizure 
detection rate was 66% with 2.3 false detections per hour.
In 2004, Hassanpour et al. [9] developed a method for seizure detection 
based on the estimation of the distribution function of the singular vectors 
related to the time-frequency distribution of EEG epochs to find patterns 
that can differentiate between a seizure and nonseizure activity. These fea-
tures were used to train a neural network to classify seizures and normal 
EEG activity. EEG data were recorded from eight newborns ranging in age 
between two days and two weeks. The EEG was recorded using a 20-­channel 
EEG amplifier and was divided into 30-s epochs. Right and left singular val-
ues were used corresponding to the largest singular value for finding the 
characteristics of the signals. Each EEG epoch was mapped into the time-fre-
quency domain using the β distribution. Two of the left and two of the right 
singular values were computed for the matrix containing the TF representa-
tion, and the singular values were squared transform them into density func-
tions. These density functions were further used to compute the distribution 
 

128

functions. Histograms were computed, and the dominant features were 
selected and fed into a neural network of two hidden layers. The ­average good 
detection rate (GDR) for eight patients was 92.5%, and the false detection rate 
(FDR) was 3.7%. The GDR was defined as the total number of true detections.
In 2004, Wilson et al. [10] developed an algorithm for seizure detection 
called the Reveal algorithm. It was based on the matching pursuit algo-
rithm, which transforms EEG signals into the sum of overlapping “atoms,” 
which are localized in time and frequency. Each atom can then be taken 
as the time-frequency evolution of an independent component of the EEG 
waveform. It divides the EEG into 2 s epochs and computes the matching 
pursuit decompositions. In the Reveal algorithm, only the first two atoms 
are generated for each decomposition, and each atom is represented by its 
total root mean square amplitude, its maximum amplitude excursion, and 
the summed duration of flat periods corresponding to the amplifier satura-
tion. This algorithm was tested on 672 seizures from 426 patients, and the 
observed sensitivity was 76% with 0.11 false detections per hour.
In 2005, Alkan et  al. [11] developed a seizure detector using the EEG 
power spectra as an input to the classifier. Different methods were applied 
to compute the power spectral density (PSD) of the signals, for example, 
multiple signal classification (MUSIC), autoregressive (AR), and periodo-
gram approaches. Then, different classification methods were applied 
and compared. Eleven patients participated in the study, out of whom five 
were epileptic. The EEG was recorded using four channels, namely, F7-C3, 
F8-C4, T5-O1, and T6-O2. The recordings were annotated by two neurolo-
gists to mark the start and end of the seizures. The PSD of the frequency of 
the signals was first computed using the periodogram method after divid-
ing the data into finite-sized windows. The AR method was also used for 
calculating the PSD. This method for spectral estimation consisted of two 
steps. First, the AR parameters were estimated from a given data sequence, 
and then the PSD was calculated from these estimates. The subspace-based 
MUSIC method was also applied to estimate the PSD of the signal, which 
was based on the eigendecomposition of the correlation matrix of the noisy 
signal. This method performed better than the previous methods as it 
is best suited to signals that contain noise and have a low SNR. Logistic 
regression and multilayer perceptron artificial neural networks (MPL-NN) 
were used for classification. MLP-NN is more robust to noise as compared 
to LR, and thus the overall results showed that MLP-NN when trained with 
the PSD estimated with the MUSIC method was more accurate in terms of 
sensitivity and specificity. With this configuration, the classification accu-
racy was 92% with a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 93.6%.
In 2007, Greene et  al. [12] developed a seizure detection system based 
on EEG and ECG. ECG also contains responses related to seizure activity, 
and thus it is often used as a second physiological signal along with EGG 
to boost the performance of seizure detectors. The algorithm was evalu-
ated in both the patient-specific and patient-independent configurations. 
 

129
Epilepsy Detection and Monitoring
The results were better in the patient-specific mode compared to the 
­patient-independent mode. The data set contained EEG recordings of 10 
neonatal epilepsy patients with 633 seizures. The EEG was divided into 
12 records, and the total recording duration was 154 h and 10 min. Six fea-
tures were extracted from each EEG channel, namely the dominant spec-
tral peak, power ratio, bandwidth of dominant spectral peak, nonlinear 
energy, spectral entropy, and line length. The dominant spectral peak, 
power ratio, and the bandwidth of dominant spectral peak are the same 
features that were used by Gotman et al. [6]. The complexity of the signal 
reduces during a seizure [13], and thus spectral entropy was calculated to 
measure the ­complexity. The mean nonlinear energy was also reported to 
be a good feature to classify seizure and nonseizure epochs [14]. The line 
length was calculated as it is a measure of the fractal properties of a signal 
and a very strong feature for seizure detection [15]. For ECG signals, the R-R 
interval was calculated first. The R-R interval is defined as the time in sec-
onds between two adjacent R-wave maximums. ECG features include the 
mean R-R interval, standard deviation between R-R intervals, mean spec-
tral entropy, mean change in the R-R interval, coefficient of variation, and 
the PSD. ECG features were calculated from 60 s nonoverlapping epochs. 
Both EEG and ECG features were then fused using early integration and 
late integration. Early integration refers to the integration of both types of 
features before classification, which gives the overall result at the output. 
Late integration involves classifying both types of features separately and 
then determining the probability of seizures for each single mode and then 
combining both the probabilities. In the patient-specific mode and with 
early integration fusion, the classifier has an accuracy of 86.32%, a sensitiv-
ity of 76.37%, a specificity of 88.77%, a GDR of 95.82%, and an FDR of 11.23%. 
With late integration fusion, the classifier has an accuracy of 84.66%, a sen-
sitivity of 74.08%, a specificity of 86.82%, a GDR of 97.52%, and an FDR of 
13.18%. In the patient-independent mode and with early integration fusion, 
the classifier has an accuracy of 71.51%, a sensitivity of 71.73%, a specificity 
of 71.43%, a GDR of 81.44%, and an FDR of 28.57%. With late integration 
fusion, the classifier has an accuracy of 68.89%, a sensitivity of 74.39%, a 
specificity of 66.95%, a GDR of 81.27%, and an FDR of 68.89%.
In 2007, Aarabi et al. [16] developed a multistage knowledge-based neo-
natal EEG detection system. The system consisted of multiple stages, that 
is, band-pass filtering and normalizing the amplitude of the EEG signals, 
automatic removal of artifacts, segmentation into EEG epochs, feature 
extraction, ­feature selection, channel-by-channel classification, and integra-
tion of the individual channel decisions. EEG was recorded from 10 neonates 
aged between 39 and 42 weeks post conception. Eleven electrodes were 
used for recording with the 10-20 system for a bipolar montage. Data were 
recorded at a sampling rate of 256 Hz and was passed through a band-pass 
filter with frequencies between 0.2 and 70 Hz. A total of 110 h of EEG were 
recorded. Because the skull thickness and the skin impedance affect the 
 

130
EEG/ERP Analysis
neonatal EEG [17], the data were first equalized by dividing it by the mean 
standard deviation of ­amplitude of 1 min of data without any seizures or arti-
facts. At the artifact removal stage, eye blinks and eyeball movements were 
removed by correlation-based template matching. Segments with constant 
amplitudes were considered as saturation artifacts, and all segments with 
zero derivatives were removed. ECG artifacts were removed by summed 
squared error-based template matching [18]. Electrode movement artifacts 
and EMG muscle artifacts were removed by thresholding. The segmentation 
stage was divided into two steps. First, the EEG was divided into 10 s epochs 
with 75% overlap. Second, these epochs where further subdivided into three 
subsegments to separate out the slow and rapid EEG activities. Various fea-
tures were extracted from these segments, including time-domain features, 
frequency-domain features, AR coefficients, wavelet features, and cepstral 
features. The feature vector was 275-dimensional for each segment. Mutual 
information-based forward feature selection (MIFFS) [19] is a method based 
on relevance and redundancy and was used for feature selection to deduce 
the feature vector’s dimensionality.* A back propagation neural network with 
three hidden layers was used as a classifier. Overall, the training and test 
performance were measured for the classifier, giving a sensitivity of 74%, 
a specificity of 70.1%, and an FDR of 1.55/h.
In 2011, Temko et al. [20] developed a neonatal seizure detection system 
based on support vector machines (SVMs). Two postprocessing steps were 
proposed to increase the temporal precision of the system. The data set used 
contained EEG recordings of 267.9 h from 17 neonatal epileptic patients. 
The recordings contained 705 seizures in all. The first step was the prepro-
cessing in which EEG was downsampled from 256 Hz to 32 Hz. The EEG 
was then divided into epochs of 8 s with 4 s overlap. A total of 55 differ-
ent features were extracted from the frequency domain, time domain, and 
information theory (entropy measures). It was observed during the classifi-
cation stage that feature selection to reduce the number of features does not 
significantly reduce the processing time, so all the 55 features were used 
for classification. At the classification stage, leave-one-out cross-validation 
method was used to assess the performance of the system. In the post-
processing stage, the classifier output for the input channel was converted 
into probabilistic values, filtered, and then the threshold was applied along 
with multichannel decision making to improve the performance of the sys-
tem. After that, the outputs from all the channels were combined to make 
*	 The final feature vector contained AR coefficients a3, a6, a12, a13; the relative spectral power 
in delta, theta, and alpha bands; zero crossings of wavelet coefficients; kurtosis of wavelet 
coefficients; relative energy of wavelet coefficients; mean and coefficient of variation of the 
first derivative of the signal; the coefficient of variation of amplitudes and curvatures of slow 
waves; the coefficient of variation of durations and curvatures of rapid waves; the mean of 
the rise time to the fall time of slow and rapid waves; the coefficient of variation of durations; 
slopes and curvatures of spike-like waves; mean left-side amplitude/mean right-side ampli-
tude of slow waves; and first and second Hjorth coefficients.

it a multichannel system. Results showed that the ­algorithm detected 89% 
of seizures with one false detection per hour, 96% with two false detections 
per hour, and 100% with four false detections per hour.
A summary of all the foregoing epileptic seizure event detection ­algorithms 
is given in Table 5.1.
5.3.1.2  Seizure Onset Detection
In 2005, Saab and Gotman [21] developed a system for seizure onset detec-
tion based on the probability of seizure in small EEG epochs. A 5-level 
wavelet transform using the Daubechies-4 wavelet was performed for EEG 
epochs of 2 s for each channel. Three characterizing measures were derived 
from the wavelet coefficients, namely, the relative average amplitude, the 
relative scale energy, and the coefficient of variation of amplitude. In order 
to estimate the conditional probability of a seizure or nonseizure event, 
Bayes’ formula was applied for probabilistic analysis. The system was eval-
uated on 652 h of continuous EEG recordings of 28 patients with 126 sei-
zures. Training and testing of the data were done on separate subsets of the 
data. The system showed a sensitivity of 77.9%, a false detection rate of 0.86 
false detections per hour, and an average latency of 9.8 s. After applying 
a tuning mechanism for the artifact rejection, the sensitivity decreased to 
76% and the latency increased to 10 s, but the false detection rate improved 
to 0.34 false detections per hour.
In 2005, Grewal and Gotman [22] developed a clinical seizure warning sys-
tem for intracerebral EEGs. The technique applied consisted of data filtering 
in different bands, spectral feature extraction, and spatiotemporal analysis. 
EEGs were first filtered into seven frequency bands using the band-pass

Chebyshev IIR filter. The EEG was divided into 4 s epochs for each ­frequency 
band, and features were extracted from these epochs, including the rela-
tive energy, relative amplitude, and coefficient of variation of amplitude. 
Furthermore, the coefficient of variation of amplitude and the relative ampli-
tude were calculated from the frequency band containing the first harmonic 
frequency of each epoch to find the harmonic characteristics of the signal. 
The feature vector finally contained five features. The data set consisted of 
EEG recordings of 407 h from 19 patients with 152 seizures. Different subsets 
were used for training and testing using the probabilistic analysis. Bayes’ 
theorem was used for classifying epochs based on the probabilities of the 
feature values. The system when evaluated gave a sensitivity of 89.4%, a false 
detection rate of 0.22 false detections per hour, and a delay time of 17.1 s.
In 2009, Shoeb [23] developed a machine learning algorithm based on EEG 
and ECG to detect the onset of epileptic seizures in pediatric patients. The 
algorithm was based on the spectral and spatial features of the EEG signals. 
The data set used contained 916 h of EEG recordings of 23 pediatric patients 
and 1 adult patient. The total data set contained 173 seizures. Spectral and 
spatial features were used to find the rhythmic activity in the signals as the 
rhythmic activity associated with the onset of a seizure is composed of many 
spectral components. A sliding window length of 2 s was selected, and a 
filter bank of 8 filters was used, which helped to better discriminate between 
seizures and nonseizures. For time evolution, the feature vector was stacked 
with a concatenation of feature vectors from three nonoverlapping 2 s epochs 
so that the feature vector captures the relation of an epoch relating to the 
epochs in the recent past. An SVM was used for classification using the radial 
basis kernel function. Training of the classifier was done with 20 s from each 
seizure and a 24 h normal EEG for each patient. When only EEG features 
were used to train the classifier, an overall 96% of the seizures were detected 
by the classifier with a mean latency of 4.6 s. The average false detection rate 
was 2 per 24 h period. When the EEG and the heart rate variability from the 
ECG were used together for 10 seizures of a specific patient, it was observed 
that the mean latency was reduced to 2.7 s, and all the seizures were detected 
correctly with five false detections per 24 h period.
In 2011, Kharbouch et  al. [24] developed a seizure onset detection sys-
tem using intracranial EEG. Spectral, spatial, and temporal features were 
extracted from iEEG and fed to a classifier to detect the onset of the seizure. 
The method was based on combining the time evolution of spectral proper-
ties of brain activities into a single feature vector for classification. The data 
set used in this study consisted of 875 h of continuous iEEG recordings from 
10 patients with 67 seizures and sampled at 500 Hz. Ninety-seven percent of 
the 67 test seizures were detected by this method with an average detection 
delay of 5 s and a false detection rate of 0.6 false detections per 24 h period. 
The average sensitivity was 95.8%.
In 2011, Nasehi and Pourghassem [25] developed a seizure onset detector 
using dynamic cascade feed-forward neural networks. The discrete Fourier 
 

133
Epilepsy Detection and Monitoring
transform was used to calculate the spectrum energy of each epoch, which 
was used further as a feature for binary classification between seizure and 
nonseizure events. A three-layer dynamic cascade feed-forward neural 
network was used for classification as it is efficient for determining non-
linear decision boundaries. Moreover, it is faster than multilayer percep-
tron and offers a smaller latency for onset detection. Eighty percent of the 
data was used for training the classifier, and 20% was used for testing. 
The CHB-MIT scalp EEG database was used in this study, which contains 
continuously recorded 844 h of EEG recordings from 23 patients and with 
173 seizures. The overall sensitivity and specificity were calculated as 
98% and 91%, respectively. The average latency was 3.5 s. Later, Nasehi 
and Pourghassem [26] used a neural network based on an improved par-
ticle swarm ­optimization (IPSONN) to determine an optimal nonlinear 
decision boundary. IPSO searches for a better solution to the problem of 
weight assignment in a neural network such as the implementation of the 
modified evolutionary direction operator (MEDO). This technique further 
improved the results. With IPSONN, the average sensitivity was 98% with 
a latency of 3 s. However, the false detection rate of 3 false detections per 
24 h was not a good outcome.
In 2012, Khan et al. [27] developed a seizure detection algorithm based 
on kurtosis, skewness, and the normalized coefficient of variation of ampli-
tude. The EEG was divided into nonoverlapping epochs of 1 s, and fea-
tures were extracted from these epochs. Skewness measures asymmetry 
in the probability distribution of data, whereas kurtosis is a measure of 
“peakedness” [28]. A background window of 25 s was taken to normalize 
epoch features. Linear classification was applied for labeling the data as 
epileptic or nonepileptic. Ten patients’ data out of 24, with 55 seizures, from 
the CHB-MIT scalp EEG database was used in this study, and the sensitiv-
ity was 100% with 1.1 false detections per hour. The mean latency of the 
­system was 3.2 s.
In 2012, Rabbi and Fazel-Rezai [29] developed an iEEG seizure onset detec-
tion system based on fuzzy logic. The data were first divided into epochs 
of 2.5 s with a 0.5 s overlap. Saturation artifacts and electrode movement 
artifacts were removed, and the data were filtered to remove high-frequency 
noise, low-frequency artifacts, and power line noise. Four features were 
extracted from each epoch: average amplitude, rhythmicity, the dominant 
frequency, and entropy. A three-stage fuzzy-rule-based system comprising 
a feature combiner, a spatial combiner, and a final decision-making system 
was used for onset detection. False detections caused by artifacts are rejected 
at the postprocessing step. The Freiburg database was used to evaluate the 
system with 112.5 h of iEEG recordings from 20 patients and with 56 sei-
zures. The system showed a sensitivity of 95.8% with 0.26 false detections 
per hour and a detection latency of 15.8 s.
The foregoing epileptic seizure event detection algorithms are summarized 
in Table 5.2.

5.4  Development of a Seizure Detection System 
Using the Singular Values of EEG Signals
In this section, the development of a seizure event detection algorithm 
based on the singular values of EEG signals is proposed. Singular values 
contain very important information about the oriented energy of a signal 
and are very sensitive to sudden changes in the signal. This property of sin-
gular values is used for epileptic seizure detection using EEG signals [30]. 
The subsequent sections will discuss in detail the methodology used for the 
development of such an algorithm.
5.4.1  Database
EEG data for 24 pediatric patients with 198 seizures used in this study 
were acquired from the PhysioNet Online EEG database [31]. The data were 
recorded from pediatric patients at the epilepsy monitoring unit of Boston 
Children’s Hospital. The EEG was captured using an 18-channel bipolar 
montage and sampled at 256 samples/s.
The EEG data are divided into small epochs of 8 s each that are shifted 
forward with a 50% overlap. Singular value decomposition (SVD) is applied 
on each window, and the largest r-singular values are obtained. The second 
norms of these values are plotted starting some time before the seizure, 
during the seizure, and some time after the seizure. Such a plot is shown in 
Figure 5.4.

Epilepsy Detection and Monitoring
It can be clearly observed from Figure  5.4 that singular values (SVs) of 
EEG signals show an increasing trend during seizures. This is because SVs 
are very sensitive to the energy changes in a signal, and thus the increased 
energy of EEG signals during an epileptic attack can be detected using SVs. 
This finding can be made the basis for the development of a seizure detec-
tion algorithm using some machine learning tools.
5.4.2  Machine-Learning-Based Seizure Detection System Using SVD
In the past few years, many studies have used machine learning techniques 
to develop automated epileptic seizure detection systems. A similar method 
is proposed here using an SVM and using singular values of EEG signals as 
features to detect epileptic activity from EEG recordings.
An SVM is an efficient tool for nonlinear binary classification problems 
as it projects the nonlinear problem to a higher-dimensionality space where 
the problem can more likely be treated as a linear problem. The SVM then 
creates a hyperplane between the two classes, separating them with the larg-
est possible distance. SVMs have been used in many previously developed 
seizure detection algorithms.
For the development of a singular-values-based seizure detection sys-
tem, EEG data are first divided into epochs of 8 s, and SVD is applied on 
each epoch. For every epoch, a singular value matrix is generated that 
is then converted into a feature vector. These feature vectors are then 
passed to the SVM for classification. The system is trained on feature vec-
tors obtained from an equal number of seizure and nonseizure epochs.

EEG/ERP Analysis
Leave-one-out cross-validation is used at the validation stage with 10 folds 
to achieve the highest possible accuracy.
The proposed system was evaluated in a patient-specific mode. Each time, 
the SVM was trained and tested on an individual patient’s data. The classifier 
gave the confusion matrix at the output, which was used for calculating the 
evaluation parameters. Figure 5.5 shows the results for classification accuracy, 
sensitivity, and specificity achieved by this system.
The mean classification accuracy for the system is 90.14% with a ­sensitivity 
and specificity of 91.22% and 89.19%, respectively. This proves that the singu-
lar values when used as features to distinguish between epileptic and nor-
mal EEG shows very promising results, and this technique can be employed 
in clinical use as SVD is a very fast technique from the computational 
­perspective and requires less hardware complexity.
5.5  EEG Time-Series Analysis
A time series is defined as “a sequence of data points, measured at ­successive 
uniform intervals of time.” Time-series analysis has a major application in elec-
troencephalography as the temporal resolution of EEG is in the ­milliseconds 
range, which is higher than that of CT or MRI. Time-series analysis is 
used in both the frequency domain and the time domain in EEG ­analysis. 
Time-series analysis is most widely used for epileptic  seizure  detection

using EEG signals. Many studies have been done in the past two decades 
that use features extracted from the time-domain and frequency-domain 
representation of an EEG signal. These features when evaluated using 
­machine-learning-based classification algorithms show a high degree of pre-
cision in indicating the changes in the signal due to epileptic activities. A list 
of commonly used time-domain and frequency-domain features used for 
seizure detection is shown in Table 5.3 [32].
5.6  Multivariate Measures
Multivariate measures take multiple EEG channels into consideration at 
once. Multivariate measures are used when different EEG channels have a 
high correlation among them. This is useful if multiple brain regions show 
similar activations during an epileptic seizure. Multivariate measures are 
further divided into a subset called bivariate measures, which consider only 
two EEG channels for analysis at a time. The two notable bivariate mea-
sures are the simple synchronization measure and the lag synchronization. 
Simple synchronization measures are used to detect synchronous activity in 
different brain regions. In case of an epileptic seizure, high rhythmic activ-
ity can be seen in different brain regions, which may be synchronous. This 
synchronization may be helpful in correlation analysis and ultimately for 
dimensionality reduction for fast analysis. In a similar way, if there is syn-
chronization in different parts of the brain shifted by some time delay, then 
lag synchronization is used, which may be used for the same purpose as that 
of simple synchronization.

5.7  Principal Component Analysis
Principal component analysis (PCA) is a mathematical procedure for dimen-
sionality reduction. It was invented by Karl Pearson in 1901 [33]. If the data 
are from different sources, it finds correlation between the data and trans-
forms it into a set of linearly uncorrelated variables. These linearly uncor-
related variables are called principal components. The dimensions of the 
new set may be unchanged or reduced depending on the number of linearly 
uncorrelated variables. Technically, PCA is an orthogonal linear transforma-
tion that transforms the data to a new coordinate system where it becomes 
linearly uncorrelated.
Because usually multichannel EEG analysis is preferred, PCA is a very 
effective technique in EEG signal processing for dimensionality reduction. 
It is used to remove the channels that are correlating to a large extent owing 
to their proximity. This helps reduce the size of the data, which facilitates 
computational efficiency.
For epileptic seizure detection, because the seizure usually starts from a 
small region and spreads all over the brain eventually, most of the EEG elec-
trodes are correlated to one another in some way. Therefore, PCA is effective 
for data analysis related to epileptic seizure detection for fast processing, 
especially for seizure onset detection.
5.8  Closed-Loop Seizure Prevention System
Closed-loop seizure prevention systems are used in continuous EEG moni-
toring to suppress a seizure before or as soon as a seizure starts. In seizure 
onset detection, the onset of a seizure is the start of the electrical seizure 
activity and may precede the visual symptoms in an individual. Thus, 
closed-loop systems are incorporated with seizure onset detectors to sup-
press the seizure by giving some stimulus to the patient. Shoeb [23] used 
a vagus nerve stimulator (VNS) along with their SVM-based seizure onset 
detector to suppress the seizure as soon as the onset is detected. A lot of 
work is being done in the field of seizure prediction, which means to predict 
the occurrence of an epileptic seizure before the event.
Seizure prediction algorithms when combined with closed-loop seizure 
prevention systems will be ideal to stop a seizure before it occurs. This 
requires a robust seizure prediction mechanism so that the seizures are 
predicted well in time with high precision and accuracy. Seizure prediction 
is a very promising research area in this field, and numerous studies are 
under way to develop a seizure prediction system that accurately predicts 
the occurrence of a seizure before the event.

This chapter discussed the types and symptoms of epilepsy along with a 
review of the best epileptic seizure detection algorithms developed in the past 
few years. A new algorithm for seizure detection based on the singular values 
of EEG signals has also been proposed and evaluated. Time-series analysis of

6.1  Human Brain Dysfunctions
The human brain is the most resilient and pliable structure in the human 
body as well as in nature. The brain is the source of human emotions, percep-
tions, thoughts, memories, and behaviors that collectively define a personal-
ity. The brain comprises hundreds of billions of neurons or nerve cells. These 
microscopic elements employ a chemical messaging mechanism to regulate

electrical activity throughout the brain. These activities define ­emotions, 
perceptions, and thoughts. However, the intricate mechanism of how a brain 
forms as a mind has not been understood as yet. It must also be noted that 
after developed inside the mother’s womb, nerve cells cannot recover from 
any forms of injury, but just degenerate.
The brain undergoes several types of dysfunctions caused by internal 
or external stimuli. The cause may be an injury or a neurodegenerative 
disease.
6.1.1  Injury
Any trauma (caused by external stimuli) that results in dysfunction or 
­bruising of scalp, skull tissue, or the brain itself is categorized as a head 
injury. When the external force damages the brain, it normally undergoes a 
temporary or permanent impairment, which is commonly known as mild cog-
nitive impairment (MCI) at a preliminary state. However, if this ­impairment 
worsens, it is termed as a traumatic brain injury (TBI) [1]. This impairment 
after intracranial neurological insult involves structural, functional, or both 
forms of insults. The structural insult physiologically damages the brain, 
whereas functional disruption of neuronal network connectivity delays or 
prevents (temporarily or prolonged) the regular brain activities from per-
forming regular tasks.
The type of brain injury that occurs owing to internal infection or stroke 
is known as a nontraumatic brain injury (nTBI). This injury is due to inter-
nal stimuli, and may also trigger certain particular dysfunctions, such as 
­epilepsy or hemorrhage.
6.1.2  Neurodegenerative Disorder
Brain cells degenerate with age. However, several diseases, such as Alzheimer’s, 
Huntington’s, and Parkinson’s diseases, result in progressive loss of structural 
and functional connectivity of neurons. Neurons die, which eventually dis-
rupts the structural and functional connectivity. Therapeutic advances have 
been partially improving the brain’s functional network activity in order to 
improve the effects of impairment through a process called rehabilitation.
Encephalopathy, a general term used for brain dysfunction, is often observed 
to be associated with delirium. Delirium is a temporary and acutely instable 
state of mind that evolves with some physical or mental illness. Studies show 
that delirium can be distinguished from dementia using qEEG. Delirious 
subjects are differentiated from controls by measuring the theta rhythm, 
relative power in the delta band, and activity in slow waves as compared 
to alpha waves. On the contrary, encephalopathy subjects are differenti-
ated from controls by estimating the relative power in alpha waves using 
qEEG [2–4].

Neurological Injury Monitoring Using qEEG
6.2  Assessment Criteria of Neuronal Injury
The initial neurological examination is based on the patient’s history of 
­memory, thinking, and attention. Physical and cognitive responses are evalu-
ated by short screening tests followed by subjective judgment. Diagnosis and 
monitoring of neurodegenerative disorders are performed by conducting a 
range of diagnostic tests, which define the type of impairment associated 
with a particular neuronal dysfunction (caused by injury or disease). Mini 
mental status examination (MMSE) is a common dementia screening test 
that assesses reading, writing, orientation, and memory. Neuropsychological 
testing is also executed to evaluate memory recall and reasoning. A periodic 
assessment reveals the rate of change in neurophysiological dysfunction. 
Advances in technology have ensured highly accurate, measured cognitive 
screening with 100% sensitivity. A standardized examination is devised for 
neurophysiological impairment as shown in Table  6.1 [5]. However, more 
expert testing is required in the case of physical disabilities, because the 
standard tests involve speaking, writing, seeing, or hearing.
The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) [6,7] score is most commonly used in the 
clinical classification of the severity of neuronal dysfunction due to injury, 
out of the several most commonly schemes as shown in Table 6.2. The GCS is 
based on a physical assessment of eye, verbal, and motor responses.
A human brain is always experiencing chemical activity throughout a 
­person’s life, even when he or she is sleeping or doing nothing. Usually, mul-
tiple low-frequency coherent networks are active when the brain is idle. The 
default mode network (DMN) has been the major point of focus for dementia 
­evaluations via functional neuroimaging modalities. The DMN is ­primarily 
composed of the posterior cingulate, medial temporal regions, lateral inferior 
parietal regions, and medial frontal cortex. For instance, the posterior cingu-
late and medial ­temporal regions are the first to be affected in Alzheimer’s 
­disease, because they are found to be the most closely related to memory 
functions. Certain regional deficits established in various studies are shown 
in Table 6.3 [5].
Laboratory tests are also performed in order to confirm if the symptoms 
are only due to some physical problems, such as a deficiency of vitamin B-12 
or a malfunctioning thyroid gland—and not dementia. A psychiatric evalu-
ation also helps to eliminate depression or a similar psychological condition 
as the cause of the mental condition.
Clinicians evaluate network abnormalities by gaining insight into functional 
connectivity using functional neuroimaging modalities such as functional 
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), computed tomography (CT), diffusion 
tensor imaging (DTI), positron emission tomography (PET), single-photon 
emission computed tomography (SPECT), and electroencephalography (EEG). 
EEG is relatively new, and it is used to get insight into cortical processing. 
EEG is a noninvasive and low-cost biomarker for visualizing structural and

metabolic abnormalities. One such abnormality may be ­excessive or deficient 
connectivity between brain areas.
Sometimes, the GCS is not estimated correctly after a TBI, or hospital records 
may be missing. At times, the accuracy of the acute TBI measures is uncer-
tain. Discriminant scores based on relative power, total power, coherence, and 
asymmetry in the phase and amplitude of EEG variables describe the neuro-
logical basis for a patient’s condition. The EEG severity index may also provide 
an insight during the recovery process and the kind of treatment that may 
improve neurological and/or neuropsychological functioning in the future [10].
6.3  Concussion
A temporary loss of regular brain functionality after a mild TBI is called con-
cussion; however, mild TBI and concussion are used interchangeably in the 
literature. The symptoms usually disappear under a month’s time; however, 
prolonged dawdling of these symptoms is associated with complications, 
which are mostly physical, cognitive, and emotional. Repeated or prolonged 
concussion increases the risk of dementia. Common types of concussion 
described in the literature are related to military and sports injuries.

EEG/ERP Analysis
­evidence after a mild TBI, is termed as post-concussion syndrome (PCS) 
or shell shock. PCS subjects often suffer from memory issues, social phobia, 
and headaches, which are usually treated with cognitive rehabilitation and 
psychological assistance. However, such treatment is not effective in PCS [11].
PCS is undetectable by standard clinical evaluation procedures because 
the damage is very slight. Usually, clinicians conduct tests related to memory, 
attention, and sports concussion as described in Table 6.1. Doctors can also 
prescribe a CT scan or an MRI. However, quantitative EEG is highly sensitive 
for diagnosis and prognosis of PCS, and it is used throughout ­neurotherapy in 
order to recover from PCS.
6.5  Neurotherapy
Studies suggest that thalamocortical dysrhythmia (lack of synchronization 
in the neurons of the thalamus) is the basis of psychiatric disorders [12]. 
Neurotherapy, also known as biofeedback, is a computer-assisted painless 
treatment method that trains brain waves in order to improve memory, atten-
tion, and cognitive functions. Mood disorders are also observed in many 
cases, followed by anxiety, concentration, dizziness, or sleep disorders.
6.6  Example: Sports Concussion and Neurotherapy
Studies suggest that football is responsible for a relatively higher rate of 
­concussion as compared with other sports; similarly, girls are more suscepti-
ble to concussion as compared with boys within the same sports domain [13]. 
Young athletes heal soon, but sometimes an athlete may suffer repeated 
­concussion when the earlier concussion is not fully healed, which causes 
complications. Athletes may develop emotional, cognitive, or physical issues 
if concussion persists for a long time or occurs multiple times before healing; 
this is known as second-impact syndrome (SIS). The situation is aggravated if 
such a concussion or some post-concussion syndrome remains undetectable. 
This may occur when the athlete returns to the field before a complete recov-
ery from neurological damage. Minors are vulnerable to a greater threat 
because their brains are still immature, and any persistent symptom hinders 
maturity of the particular activity [14].
Regular neuroimaging modalities, such as CT/CAT, or MRI, do not prove 
to be useful in such a situation, because they cannot detect damage at the 
axon level. Topographical mapping representation indicates evidence of con-
cussion [11], and hence qEEG-guided neurotherapy is known to significantly 
restore normal functionality after mild or moderate concussion.

Neurological Injury Monitoring Using qEEG
6.7  Abnormal Brain Activity Monitoring
Most common evaluations of functional connectivity involve functional 
homogeneity, differentiation, or topographic reciprocities, which are mea-
sured by coherence analysis, comodulation analysis, or both. These evalu-
ations can be performed by using qEEG recordings. Coherence or power 
analysis measures the phase consistency (e.g., lag) between signals. On the 
contrary, comodulation analysis enumerates magnitude consistency [15]. 
Coherent signals have a stable phase relationship, as shown in Figure 6.1. 
Conversely, comodulated signals have a stable magnitude relationship irre-
spective of the absolute difference between them, as shown in Figure 6.2.
6.7.1  qEEG Parameters
Several approaches to quantitative analysis of EEG practiced today are 
­predominantly based on some or all of the following parameters [16].
•	 Frequency or period
•	 Amplitude
•	 Phase relations
•	 Morphology (waveform)
•	 Topology
•	 Abundance
•	 Reactivity and variability (e.g., continuous, random, paroxysmal)

EEG/ERP Analysis
6.7.2  Monitoring Mechanism
EEG voltages sensed at the scalp through the electrodes are converted to 
­digitized frequencies during spectral analysis of EEG signals because ­mental 
processes are better reflected in the periodicities than the raw values. EEG 
signals are nonlinear and run the risk of being empirically uninterruptable. 
Nonetheless, on one level, neural coding is linearly related to perception [17], 
but the processing of EEG data must not be too far away from the actual 
recording under any approach.
Each behavioral and mental state is assumed to be reasonably homoge-
neous in nature during quantitative analysis of EEG signals. This assumption 
is termed macrostate, which is the basis for cognitive neuroscience. Moreover, 
these perceptual and cognitive operations are adequately assumed to exhibit 
a distinct and reliable profile of brain activity [18].
Time, frequency, and joint time–frequency analysis of EEG signals identify 
the features linked to neuronal disorders. Frequency analysis is specifically 
related to measurements of changes of the subband order, termed spectral 
analysis. Different types of neuronal disorders exhibit different kind of spec-
tral changes; for instance, when a subject suffers a TBI, there is a significant 
decrease in the overall brain signal strength; conversely, epileptic subjects 
show very high activity at the focal point. Changes in the EEG signal due to 
injury is treated as a random process. Signal entropy calculations (6.10.2) are 
used to assess this randomness or nonstationary (or unpredictable) nature of 
the EEG recording of a person with a brain injury.
Studies show that psychological, behavioral, psychiatric, and neurological 
disorders exhibit abnormal patterns of spectral activity [19]. Neurotherapists 
train subjects suffering from a particular neural disorder to correct abnor-
mal patterns of neural activity, for instance, through rehabilitation exercises. 
Mental rehabilitation is the process where patients suffering from neurode-
generative disorders learn how to restore their mental health. The goal is to 
improve learning through psychological therapies in order to achieve self-
regulation of cerebral mechanisms. Neurotherapeutics are equipped with 
the tools that tend to improve functional connectivity inside the brain, and 
the behavior improves accordingly. The improvement in the functional con-
nectivity is identified by qEEG assessment in order to monitor the recovery, 
and hence serves as a promising monitoring tool for the diagnosis and prog-
nosis of neurodegenerative disease.
6.8  qEEG in Human Behavior Studies after Neuronal Injury
Behavioral analysis from brain activity using qEEG can be categorized as 
spontaneous and evoked. Spontaneous activity is a relaxed mental state 
in the absence of any task execution (e.g., relaxed wakefulness with eyes 
 

151
Neurological Injury Monitoring Using qEEG
continuously opened or closed), whereas evoked activity involves a state of 
task execution (e.g., mathematical processing, reading). These mental states 
are distinct and uniform in nature, where distinct mental operations pres-
ent distinct EEG and biochemical profiles. Clinicians focus on training and 
limiting brain activity based on a population norm; otherwise, the activity is 
interpreted as evidence of an abnormal neurophysiological state [20].
6.9  Effect of Human Diversity on the Nature of qEEG Signals
The degree of neuronal maturity (or immaturity) plays a vital role in evaluat-
ing a population of various ages, ethnicities, handedness (left or right), and 
gender. For instance, a low alpha rhythm is observed in children and is neg-
ligible in newborns, as shown in Table 6.4 [21]. It is observed that an alpha 
rhythm of 10 Hz is achieved when the child reaches the age of 11 years.
Children suffering from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) 
exhibit an immature frequency of the dominant thalamocortical rhythm [22]. 
On the contrary, a similar frequency indicates a different type of mental dis-
order in adults. The dominant (or peak) frequency in an EEG profile refers 
to the frequency range carrying the most energy in the spectrum. The peak 
frequency, as it is sometimes called, may exhibit topographic variability, 
with higher peak frequencies toward the back of the head and lower peak 
frequencies toward the front [23]. Furthermore, during closed eye EEG 
recordings, healthy adults usually exhibit a peak frequency between 8 and 
12 Hz [24]. Moreover, laterality patterns associated with left-handedness are 
different from those associated with right-handedness [25,26]. Left-handed 
­individuals may show abnormal hemispheric specialization such as speech 
functions in the right hemisphere [25,27]. Furthermore, assessment tests 
to discover handedness (e.g., the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory [28]) 
have been ­discovered in addition to just evaluating writing samples from 
each hand.
Males reveal stricter functional segregation and hence greater functional 
asymmetry than females [29–34].

EEG/ERP Analysis
6.10  Analysis Techniques
Data obtained from EEG recordings contain time (e.g., voltage amplitude, 
time lag) and frequency (e.g., magnitude, phase) information. Analytically, 
frequency analysis has been more studied than time analysis of EEG data. 
Frequency analysis slashes EEG data to a manageable number of coefficients. 
Information obtained via spectral analysis of EEG can be presented in a wide 
range of layouts (e.g., numerical tables, histograms, line graphs, brain maps). 
The most renowned layout is brain maps, which convert digital signals into 
values on a colored scale.
Generally, mean spectral magnitude of coherence or power for multiple 
frequency bands are computed and reported for subjective analysis and 
network diagnosis for functional connectivity variations. Evaluation of the 
reported information relative to existing or observed information (e.g., means, 
percentage change, and statistical database comparisons) is used to support 
subjective conclusions and recommend rehabilitation training.
The information reported only carries computations executed on values 
recorded at the particular positions on the scalp where the electrodes are 
set. The spatial accuracy can be improved by increasing the number of elec-
trodes or by interpolation. However, interpolation cannot reconstruct the 
original values in the region between the electrodes. Therefore, the best 
way to be certain about the actual potential is to use as many electrodes as 
possible.
6.10.1  Interpolation Technique
In order to morph details between the scalp sensors, several interpolation 
techniques are used. A mathematical technique to spawn data points in the 
region surrounding the electrode sensors is called interpolation. The dis-
tribution of electric potentials over the scalp is smooth, and therefore inter-
polation furnishes fairly accurate values owing to the smearing effect. The 
distribution of potentials on the scalp generates an electrical field modeled 
by several dipoles. The values of maxima and minima of these dipoles need 
to be positioned as precisely as possible. K-nearest neighbors, a nonpara-
metric classification method that is also used for interpolation, measures the 
closest point where the value needs to be calculated. Usually, a higher order 
will result in a smoother interpolation, which is deemed fit for brain maps.
The accuracy of the interpolation technique is calculated by interpolating 
at the position of an electrode, because it can be compared with the actual 
potential at that point.
Quantification of the time-series characteristics can be performed by linear 
and nonlinear analysis. Linear analysis deals with the amplitude component 
of the EEG power spectrum, whereas nonlinear analysis quantifies the EEG 
signal entropy [35].
 

153
Neurological Injury Monitoring Using qEEG
6.10.2  Entropy
Information gain and learning is calculated through entropy ­calculation. 
This new concept in nonlinear analysis is often associated with more ran-
domness and less system order [36]. EEG signals carry spatiotemporal 
information about potentials recorded through the electrode sensors. The 
temporal data are available in the form of a time series. The entropy of 
this time series can be quantified by using the following estimators, which 
­indicate the ­dynamics and significance of a study [35]:
•	 Information entropy
•	 Mutual entropy
•	 Approximate entropy
6.10.2.1  Information Entropy
Let m be the dimension of the phase space of one lead data, where m is larger 
than the Hausdorff dimensions [37]. If the phase space is separated into l 
equal partitions in each dimension, then the achieved space has lm subspaces. 
In such a case, each subspace carries a probability distribution Ps(Si) of the 
signal vector 
=

 where n = lm.
6.10.2.2  Mutual Entropy
Mutual entropy measures the statistical dependencies between two EEG time 
series for linear and nonlinear analyses altogether. If Q and S are two subsys-
tems with a dimension of m and partition l, then the joint entropy of the two is 
calculated with 
∑

 where M = m2m. The mutual 
entropy of subsystems S to Q can be calculated as ME(QS) = H(S)+H(Q)−H(QS). 
A lower ME(QS) output reflects lower information gain and vice versa.
6.10.2.3  Approximate Entropy
A relatively new estimator, known as approximate entropy (ApEn), describes the 
regularity of a system, where larger values indicate a higher ­complexity [38,39]. 
Very limited and noisy data are well analyzed by using ApEn owing to its 
scale-invariant and model-independent nature.
Consider an EEG epoch series {xi}, where i = 1, 2, …, N, from a series of m 
vectors. The series Xi is given by

where j = 1, 2, …, N−m+1. The displacement between Xi and Xj is expressed as 
d(Xi, Xj) = maxk|x(i + k − 1) − x(j+k − 1), where k = 1, 2, …, m. Count the number 
of Xj for every Xi, where I ≠ j and displacement d(Xi , Xj) ≤ r, where r = Nm(i).

6.11  Summary
This chapter discusses the common human brain dysfunctions and focuses 
on the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of head injury. It provides an 
insight into the clinical processes and standard evaluation criteria involved 
in assessing the severity of brain injury and the associated neuroimaging 
modalities. Concussion and neurotherapy techniques are reviewed with an 
example of sports-related concussion. The importance of qEEG is also high-
lighted here, shedding some light on the commonly exercised parameters 
and their monitoring mechanism. The effects of neuronal injury on human 
behavior and variation in population are elucidated. Information on analysis 
techniques is presented, followed by a description of different entropy esti-
mation techniques on EEG measurement pairs.

7.1  Introduction
This chapter attempts to give different examples of applications of quanti-
tative EEG (qEEG) for the realization of brain–computer interfaces (BCIs). 
In particular, we think that neurotechnologies for BCIs based on electroen-
cephalography (EEG) offer advanced tools of interest for other research and 
application fields. EEG–BCI technologies are based on the electrical nature of 
brain activity. EEG–BCI captures the user state or intent via electrical signals 
recorded on the scalp and maps them into computer or device commands. 
As the reader can imagine, such a process goes through an intermediate pro-
cess of quantification. We explain some of these techniques in the following 
chapter.

EEG/ERP Analysis
We describe in Section 7.2 two of the most classical paradigms used in 
BCIs for communication. The so-called P300 paradigm is often used in BCIs 
for spelling purposes. We detail here its relationship to attentional processes 
and the way it can be measured. Moreover, we discuss the so-called steady-
state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) responses, which are elicited while 
observing a flickering light source.
Affective Computing is an emerging field within BCI that involves detect-
ing the emotional content within the subjects’ brain activity. Arousal, work-
load, and stress can be studied through EEG quantitative analysis. We 
describe in Sections 7.4 to 7.6 different developments and experimental stud-
ies that we have conducted in this field.
Neurofeedback (NF) is a type of user feedback that uses real-time displays 
of EEG measurements of brain activity features. qEEG has been extensively 
used in this therapeutic field. EEG features are extracted and displayed, 
allowing the user to modulate their temporal evolution. This results in 
neuromodulatory techniques based on NF training with therapeutic appli-
cations, which are detailed in Section 7.7 on attention deficit hyperactivity 
disorder (ADHD). We finally present in Section 7.10 some conclusions to this 
overview.
7.2  Event-Related Potentials for BCI
7.2.1  P300 as a Tool for Attention Measurement
We recall in this section the quantification of attention in mental ­processes 
as described in Ref. [1]. BCIs have been using a particular paradigm based on 
attentional processes denoted P300 [2,3] for communication. The main idea 
of the experimental paradigm is that when an external stimulus attracts the 
attention of a subject, a characteristic brain waveform appears [4]. A typical 
P300 waveform or complex is formed by a negative peak at approximately 
200 ms followed by a positive one of larger amplitude at 300 ms. The peak at 
300 ms, which is formed by two different components, can be used for atten-
tional studies. In particular, the component of the P300 event-related potential, 
which originates in the frontal part of the brain, is associated with attention 
mechanisms during task processing, whereas the one found in the tempopa-
rietal part relates to memory processes [5]. In this ­communication we extend 
the observation of peripheral muscle activity [1] with the ­measurement of 
such brain activity. We expect from this paradigm shift to get a more direct 
access to attentional processes as originated in the brain. This could lead 
to a more objective quantification of the relationship between, for example, 
creativity and attention.
In particular, we describe our work with the so-called rapid serial visual 
presentation (RSVP) paradigm [6]. In this experimental setup, a sequence 
 

159

of images is shown to the experimental subjects. The images are shown at 
a high presentation rate of between 100 and 1000 ms. The time between 
stimuli has an influence on the P300 amplitude as shown in Ref. [5]. In such 
a setup, the subject is instructed to consciously detect a particular image 
in the sequence. Each time this image appears, her brain activity shows 
the so-called P300 waveform. We describe here the results obtained with 
such a setup.
Three different subjects went through the RSVP of 500 natural images in 
sets of 10 different pictures at the rate of 10 images per second. The subjects 
were told to detect one particular image in each of the sets. The image to 
be detected is denoted as the target stimulus, and the remaining images in 
the set are the nontarget stimuli. Each image of a 10 set gilts as the target 
image five times for each subject. During the experiment, the brain activity 
of the subject was monitored through an EEG device using 32 different chan-
nels placed in accordance with the 10–20 standard positioning.
In order to conduct the data analysis, we have used the methodology 
described in Ref. [7], which uses an ensemble of support vector machines 
(SVMs). The first stage of this methodology includes filtering the data in the 
band 0.1 to 10 Hz, decimating the obtained signals, and cutting a window of 
667 ms duration after stimuli presentation. We show the grand averages of 
the waveforms obtained on all target stimuli in Figure 7.1. We have selected

here by visual inspection the channels presenting the best response, and 
used them later in the classification. It is worth mentioning that the latency 
of the peak corresponding to the P300 appears delayed with respect to 
the usual value at 300 ms owing to the complexity of the stimuli used in the 
experiment.
After the signals have been preprocessed and reduced to 15 ­component 
feature vectors per channel, we concatenate each channel feature and deliver 
it to a set of 10 classifiers in order to measure the classification performance. 
Here, the goal is to discriminate between target and nontarget images 
based on the P300 waveforms. We use as performance the classification 
rate, that is, the percentage of right-classified stimuli. Such a ­classification 
can be used to characterize the attentional process that leads each subject 
to detect the presence of the target images. As in the case of the feature vec-
tors (see Figure 7.1), the classification result will improve when averaging 
the detection of several results. Hence, we characterize the performance 
in a plot that depicts the classification rate with respect to the number of 
averaged classification outputs, that is, the number of times an image has 
to be shown to a subject in order to present a classifiable P300 waveform. 
The result is shown in Figure 7.2. As can be observed, the methodology 
gives excellent performance for two out of three ­subjects. The poor perfor-
mance in Subject2 could already be observed in his grand average plots,

which  do  not show a clear distinction between ­target and nontarget 
­stimuli. Such a poor performance could be due to a lack of attention during 
the experimental task.
The results described in this section, that is, a characterization of the 
P300 wave with respect to its latency and amplitude, and its classification 
­performance, can be used for the objective measurement of attentional 
­psychophysical features.
7.2.2  Steady-State Visual Evoked Potentials
In recent years, there has been increased interest in using SSVEPs in BCI 
­systems. The SSVEP approach currently provides the fastest and most ­reliable 
communication, making it the ideal BCI paradigm. SSVEP-based BCIs offer 
two main advantages over BCIs based on other electrophysiological sources: 
(1) They have a higher information transfer rate and (2) they require a shorter 
calibration time [8].
SSVEP is a resonance phenomenon arising mainly in the visual cortex when 
a person is focusing his or her visual attention on a light source ­flickering 
with a frequency from 1 to 100 Hz [9]. When an SSVEP is ­elicited, it is mani-
fested as oscillatory components in the user’s EEG, especially in the ­signal 
from the primary visual cortex [10]. SSVEP-based BCIs can be ­classified into 
three categories depending on the ­specific stimulus sequence modulation in 
use: time-modulated VEP (t-VEP) BCIs, ­frequency-modulated VEP (f-VEP) 
BCIs, and pseudorandom-code-­modulated VEP (c-VEP) BCIs [11].
BCI systems based on f-SSVEP have been the approach most commonly 
used in BCI research. In f-SSVEP-based systems, each target is flashed at a 
unique frequency, generating a resonance response that can be measured 
in the EEG as oscillatory components matching the repetitive visual stim-
ulation (RVS) frequency and its harmonics. When an SSVEP is elicited, its 
response is characterized by an energy increase at the RVS frequency, and its 
harmonics are phase-locked with the stimulus [12].
Frequency is a crucial property of the RVS. An SSVEP is elicited when 
a person is focusing his or her visual attention on a light source flicker-
ing with a frequency ranging from 1 to 100 Hz [9]. The SSVEP response 
has a strong subject and is RVS frequency dependent; therefore, for practi-
cal SSVEP-based BCI systems construction, it is recommended to tune this 
parameter for each subject under evaluation in order to obtain a large SSVEP 
response (Figure  7.3). The choice of the flickering frequency determines 
which cortical network synchronizes with the flickering frequency [13], and 
therefore the electrode or combination of electrodes in which the SSVEP 
response appears.
Practical SSVEP-based BCI systems in general are compound of ­several 
­targets consisting of RVS sources flickering at different frequencies. When 
the system detects the elicited response corresponding to one of the frequen-
cies under evaluation, it carries out the associated action. Two main types 
 

162
EEG/ERP Analysis
of SSVEP-based BCI paradigms exist: asynchronous and synchronous. 
Synchronous paradigms, also known as cued-paced BCI paradigms, do not 
consider the possibility that the user does not wish to communicate. RVS is 
always ­present, and the SSVEP response is continuously evaluated. Although 
these BCIs are relatively easy to use and develop, they are impractical for 
many in many real-world settings [14].
In asynchronous or self-paced BCI, users can interact with the BCI at their 
leisure, without worrying about well-defined time frames [15]. In this case, the 
system detects when the user wants to interact with the BCI, ­switching on the 
stimulation sources during a short ­time-defined period. During this period, 
the user focuses his or her attention on the ­target whose ­associated action is 
to be carried out. After the stimulation, the response of the ­target frequencies 
is evaluated, and the frequency ­responsible for ­eliciting the evoked potential 
is determined (Figure 7.4) [16].
7.3  Affective Computing: Novel BCIs
The effect of emotional and affective states of the user on ­human–­computer 
interaction systems has been widely studied [7–19]. Moreover, the impact of 
affective states on BCI systems’ performance has also been studied [20,21], 
proving the importance of incorporating mechanisms for dealing with affec-
tive states on the realization of BCIs. Affective computing methodologies and 
techniques have been used to develop BCI systems in which ­performance was 
improved by taking into account the affective state of the user [22,23].

163
Quantitative EEG for Brain–Computer Interfaces
We present in the following sections our studies on emotion detection 
and on stress detection using EEG that can be applied to the realization of 
advanced BCI systems incorporating affective computing to achieve high 
levels of performance.
7.4  Arousal–Valence Detection
Following the dimensional approach to model emotions, we can take the 
valence state of the subject as the first dimensional state, and the arousal 
state of the subject as the second dimensional state. From the standpoint of 
the detection’s method, these two dimensions are usually considered to be 
independent. Therefore, the emotional state on each of them is measured 
separately, and a variety of proposed detection methods are available for 
valence and arousal.
The detection of arousal using EEG has been widely published and dif-
ferent methodologies have been proposed. However, the most common

164
EEG/ERP Analysis
approaches are those that make use of the relation between asymmetric 
­frontal cortical activity and the valence state [24]. Studies show that in pos-
itive-valence states, the left hemisphere of the brain cortex presents higher 
activity compared to the right hemisphere, whereas in negative-valence 
states, the right hemisphere presents higher activity than the left one [25,26]. 
Moreover, according to recent publications, this asymmetric activation is 
stronger or specific to the frontal cortex [27].
In order to measure the activation of each hemisphere or region, some 
studies exploit the reported evidence that brain activity is inversely related 
to the preeminence of the alpha (8–12 Hz) frequency band of an EEG signal. 
In low brain activity periods, the alpha band increases its power relative to 
other bands, and vice versa [28].
To compute the asymmetric activation of the right and left hemisphere, 
the power in the alpha band is computed in the right and left hemispheres, 
obtaining what is commonly called alpha asymmetry: alpha power on the 
right hemisphere minus alpha power on the left hemisphere. Positive values 
of this value will respond to greater activity of the left hemisphere relative 
to the right hemisphere and, therefore, correspond to positive valence states. 
On the contrary, negative values of alpha asymmetry will correspond to neg-
ative valence states.
Following this asymmetry-based approach, we developed a valence state 
detector based on EEG. Placing the electrodes on the right and left hemi-
sphere locations for the frontal and prefrontal cortex, we averaged the alpha 
activation of the electrodes located on the right hemisphere and the elec-
trodes of the left hemisphere. The difference between the averaged activa-
tions of the right hemisphere and those of the left hemisphere is taken as the 
value corresponding to the valence state of the subject.
While for valence most of the methodologies share a clear approach 
based on asymmetric activation, the different methodologies to detect 
the arousal state from brain activity adopt a great variety of approaches. 
Arousal states have traditionally been detected from the reactions of the 
autonomic nervous system through the monitoring of the heart rate, skin 
temperature, or the galvanic skin response. However, more recently brain 
activity has also been used to detect arousal. Some publications related 
high mental workloads with high arousal states [29], and low mental states 
and boredom with low arousal [30]. Other publications related event-
related reactions in different bands and locations of the brain to arousal. 
Variances of event-related synchronization and desynchronization in 
alpha (8–12 Hz) and theta (4–8 Hz) bands in different areas of the brain 
to different arousal states induced by pictures have been reported  [31]. 
Gamma bands (30–65  Hz) have also been reported to present higher 
­activation for high arousal states [32].
Following the mental-load approach, we developed an arousal state 
detector based on EEG. Taking advantage of the reported activation of beta 
bands upon higher workloads, we took the ratio between beta activation 
 

165

and alpha activation to compute the ratio of activation versus ­deactivation. 
This ratio corresponds to the arousal state in our detection.
7.5  A qEEG Platform for Visualizing Emotional Features
In this section, we present an EEG-based system for tracking emotions in 
real time, building on the application programming interface (API) for the 
Enobio® electrophysiological sensor*. It is based on the valence–arousal 
framework [33], a representation in which the arousal dimension measures 
how dynamic the emotional state is, and the valence is a global measure of 
the positive or negative feeling associated with the state.
The graphical user interface (GUI) consists of a control panel (Figure 7.5a) 
in which the user can configure the Enobio® setup, and an emotion visu-
alization panel (Figure 7.5b), in which the detected emotions are shown in 
real time.
The control panel allows the user to configure the electrode positions that 
will be used to compute the valence and arousal values. Moreover the power 
in the alpha and beta bands will be averaged over the selected channels for 
each element in the valence and arousal calculation, as follows:

where Palpha (channeli) and Pbeta (channeli) are the powers in the alpha and 
beta bands in the ith channel, and I, J, and K are the number of selected chan-
nels for each element. The user can also select among four normalization 
methods applied to the valence and arousal values: (1) range normalization; 
(2) historical normalization, in which the minimum and maximum are com-
puted only over the last L samples; (3) sigmoid normalization, where sigmoid 
parameters can be set up; and (4) no normalization.
The emotion visualization panel consists of a two-dimensional plot in 
which the valence and arousal are represented on the horizontal and verti-
cal axes, respectively. Such a representation was proposed by Russel [34]. 
Every time a valence–arousal pair is computed, an emotion is represented 
with a circle in its corresponding position, color, and size. The position of

the circle depends on the values of the valence and arousal, and the color 
of the circle is set according to a color scheme derived from Plutchik [35] 
(Figure 7.5b). The size of the circle is determined by the recentness of the 
sample—the more recent the sample, the bigger the circle; as time passes, 
the size of the older samples becomes smaller. The resulting system outputs 
a new ­emotion every 0.4 s, taking into account that the Enobio outputs 500 
samples per ­second and that the values of valence and arousal are computed 
every block of 200 samples.
7.6  Stress Detection
According to [36], psychological stress occurs when an individual perceives 
that the environmental demands tax or exceed his or her adaptive capacity. 
In this study, we focused on this type of stress and applied a protocol in 
which several tasks were designed to stress participants to different ­levels. 
The protocol included a baseline recording, a reading task (low stress), 
a Stroop test, an arithmetic task (medium stress), and finally a false blood 
sample test (high stress). In the first part of our study, we computed the aver-
ages over the 12 participants of our EEG features.
Following the Rel model of emotions [34], “stress” emotion is characterized 
by a negative valence and a positive arousal, which can be placed in a line 
over the plus and asterisk sectors of the diagram given in Figure 7.6. Based 
on the literature (for example, [37], [38], and [39]), we see that alpha asym-
metry is related to the valence dimension of emotions, whereas the beta/
alpha ratio is related to the arousal dimension. In our study, we have focused

on these two EEG features, and in order to extract them, we used three EEG 
channels (F7, F8, and Cz) as a reference.
The results shown in Figure 7.6 are as expected: our low-stress tasks have 
higher valence and lower arousal, whereas our high-stress tasks have the 
opposite characteristics. The medium-stress tasks fall in between these two 
extremes.
In the next step of our study and in order to study the possibility of detect-
ing stress levels on a subject-to-subject basis, we applied machine learning 
techniques in order to train a classifier (linear discriminant analysis) using 
a leave-one-subject approach. In this case, we obtain a performance as high 
as 88% between the Baseline and the Fake Blood Sample task, 72% between 
the Stroop test and the Blood Sample, and finally 83% between the Baseline 
and the Stroop test.
The conclusion of this study is that EEG can be used to extract the stress 
level, and it is interesting to note that only three EEG channels are needed, 
making the system unobtrusive. Moreover, this system has the capacity to 
work in real time, making it very suitable for augmented reality, NF applica-
tions, and stress management therapies.
7.7  Therapeutic Usage of qEEG and BCI: NF for ADHD
ADHD is the most common psychiatric disorder in children (2–5%) [40] and 
is generally diagnosed in children who exhibit attention difficulties, impul-
sive behaviors, and extreme levels of hyperactivity. Children with ADHD 
frequently also exhibit a variety of physical problems such as headaches and 
immune system deficiencies that cause frequent illnesses.
For over 50 years and increasingly more since 1990s, Ritalin and amphet-
amine derivates have been used to treat ADHD worldwide [41]. Even 
though they are considered safe drugs, they have frequent side effects, for 
example, appetite suppression, abdominal pain, insomnia, headache, and 
anorexia [42]. NF therapy opens new possibilities for ADHD care by pro-
viding an adverse-side-effect-free treatment. EEG measures electric currents 
in the brain that reflect the function of certain brain activities. Since the 
1970s, studies have revealed specific ADHD patterns measured in the EEG. 
The goal of EEG ­biofeedback training is to teach ADHD patients how to alter 
these abnormal patterns. During NF treatment, children learn how to self-
regulate these patterns, usually by playing videogames. Attention and alert-
ness levels are transformed into game commands, encouraging the child 
to operate at the desired levels. NF training has many therapeutic applica-
tions, ­including ADHD. Creative states and meditation patterns can also be 
found in the EEG, and the same training as in a clinical NF application can 
be applied.
 

169
Quantitative EEG for Brain–Computer Interfaces
7.8  EEG Patterns
The most common pattern found in ADHD is the excess slow wave activity 
in the frontal regions [42]. There are numerous other ways of looking at sub-
types of ADHD based on EEG band power analysis. Excess theta activity is 
the most common type, as reflected in theta–beta ratios using a single chan-
nel [43]. There could also be excess alpha activity, usually in the lower alpha 
range (8–10 Hz). The goal of EEG biofeedback training is to teach the child 
how to alter these abnormal brain waves and normalize the EEG activity.
Band power meditation patterns can also be found in the EEG. Signiﬁcantly 
increased theta power was found during nondirective meditation, while 
there was also a signiﬁcant increase in alpha power [44]. Professionally 
signiﬁcant enhancement of music, dance, performance, and mood has fol-
lowed training with an EEG-neurofeedback protocol that increases the ratio 
of theta to alpha waves using auditory feedback with eyes closed [45].
7.9  NeuroSurfer: NeuroElectrics NF Application
NeuroSurfer, a flexible, general-purpose, fully configurable NF application 
developed by Neuroelectrics®, aims to address ADHD treatment requirements. 
The application has been designed to satisfy the needs of both experienced 
researchers and clinicians. NeuroSurfer monitors the temporal power evolu-
tion of customized frequency bands, fulfilling almost every NF band-power-
based training protocol. NeuroSurfer uses Enobio® in its 8-channel version, a 
wearable, wireless electrophysiology sensor system for the recording of EEG, 
which makes it simple and quick to set up the device montage; another added 
advantage is that the patient need not be attached to the measuring device. 
NeuroSurfer performs robust band power calculations in real time. Signal pro-
cessing stages include filtering, referencing, eye artifact correction, windowing, 
and power spectral density extraction. The calculated power feature is presented 
to the clinician/researcher, allowing him or her to monitor its temporal evolu-
tion and its levels is used to command the patient’s video game application.
NeuroSurfer gives the possibility of automatically configuring the NF 
application parameters for most ADHD popular training protocols, includ-
ing the ones previously described. Experienced users have also the chance of 
fully configuring the application setting.
During the NF training, the operator is able to follow the calculated feature 
evolution in real time. NeuroSurfer feature monitoring includes temporal 
feature evolution (Figure 7.7), power spectral density (PSD), and bar repre-
sentation. qEEG (Figure  7.8) of the feature at every connected electrode is 
also presented. BrainSurfer also provides simple statistics of the ­performance 
 

170
EEG/ERP Analysis
of both training trials and the entire training session, which is useful for 
­following the treatment evolution. Current NF clinical applications such as 
Neurosurfer can be easily configured to calculate meditation and creative 
state features, boosting the possibilities of emotional and creative NF training.
7.10  Conclusions
This chapter describes different neurotechnologies to be used for the quan-
tification of brain activity. All types of techniques take as their starting 
point the electrical nature of such activity. BCIs based on the detection of

event-related potentials such as the P300 or the SSVEPs described here and 
the detection of affects can be used for the objective measurement of cogni-
tive processes. Different parameters of the P300 waveform and its detection 
can be used to quantify attentional processes. SSVEPs used the reaction to 
flickering stimulation sources as reflected in the brain activity. Moreover, 
we have described different technologies for the measurement of arousal, 
valence, and stress. All these interface paradigms rely on quantification 
­techniques to be exploited in other research and application fields.
Moreover, NF, which is based on the real-time application of quantitative 
techniques to brain activity, is used to modify the dynamics of brain activ-
ity. The presented NF application can be tuned to monitor different brain 
rhythms in real time. This measurement is fed to the control loop of the 
visual feedback mechanism. The modulatory action of these technologies in 
therapy has not been exploited fully. We expect the following years to wit-
ness the full flowering of these technologies.

EEG/ERP Analysis
8.1  Introduction
Conventional EEG techniques are based on visual inspection of patterns 
from EEG records. This involves observation of changes in wave shapes, 
­frequencies, and transitions of states that may not be found in healthy 
­subjects. During the last few years, more robust techniques based on signal 
digitization and processing have been proposed, including quantitative elec-
troencephalography (qEEG).
qEEG covers techniques involving computer algorithms and methods 
for quantification, analysis, diagnosis, discrimination of clinical disease 
­subtypes, and prediction of treatment response of medicine. It requires digi-
tal recording of EEG as an unavoidable preliminary step, known as digital 
EEG (DEEG). It is a well-established methodology and the inevitable first step 
before qEEG analysis can be applied. DEEG includes computer techniques 
for the digital storage of EEG signals. It provides flexibility in terms of signal 
display, change of filters settings, and so on. qEEG substantially boosts the 
capacity of conventional EEG techniques. Both techniques complement each 
other: conventional EEG is used to aid the diagnosis of a disease, whereas 
qEEG precisely discriminates individuals by analyzing EEG features into 
clinically significant subgroups.
qEEG has been suggested in clinical cases for discriminating patients 
into different subgroups, and it is also being used as a biomarker to 
aid ­clinicians in the selection of a treatment plan. Unfortunately, so far 
the ­outcomes have not been significant despite a huge body of research 
­evidence. This is mainly because individual has a unique EEG signal/
pattern, that makes it difficult to be measured based on a certain ­biomarker. 
Development of such a biomarker to generalize the signals is a challenge 
and involves advanced techniques. However, it has been recognized that 
the qEEG biomarker is critical and will be playing an important role in 
clinical cases.
This chapter introduces the development of a number of biomarkers 
using conventional and qEEG techniques for stress, unipolar depression, 
and alcohol addiction. A case study on stress assessment is included and 
discussed.
8.2  Psychiatric Disorders
A major application of EEG lies in psychiatric disorders, including ­depression 
and schizophrenia. They may result from social interactions, separation of 
partners, job dissatisfaction, or unemployment. One of the common factors 
 

177
EEG and qEEG in Psychiatry
that make individuals vulnerable to any psychiatric disorder is their mental 
health or their inability to tackle such situations.
8.2.1  Stress
Hans Selye is considered a pioneer in describing the role of stress in a 
­general adaptation syndrome (GAS) [1]. He defined stress as the transition 
from a calm to an excited state for the sake of preserving the integrity of the 
­organism [2]. According to cognitive activation theory, stress is a physiologi-
cal and psychological response to threatening situations that need adjust-
ment in homeostatic imbalance caused by a general “alarm.” Formally, the 
alarm occurs when there is a discrepancy between what it should be and 
what it is [3].
8.2.2  Depression and Subtypes
Depression is a common experience in daily life. For example, we sometimes 
feel “depressed” about a friend’s cold shoulder, misunderstandings in our 
marriage, tussles with teenage children, and sometimes we feel “down” for 
no reason. Depression is specific to the following symptoms:
	
1.	The mood state is severe.
	
2.	It lasts for 2 weeks or more.
	
3.	It interferes with the individual ability to function.
8.2.2.1  Nonmelancholic Depression
It is a more commonly existing nonbiological depression mainly due to 
severe daily life events. It normally has the following symptoms:
	
1.	A depressed mood for more than 2 weeks
	
2.	Social impairment (e.g., difficulty in dealing with work or relationship)
8.2.2.2  Melancholic Depression
It is a less common form of biological depression with the following character-
istics. It is normally treated with physical treatments such as antidepressants.
	
1.	A more severe depression than the case with nonmelancholic depres-
sion, with a lack of pleasure and difficulty in being cheered up
	
2.	Psychomotor disturbance (e.g., low energy, poor concentration, slow 
or agitated movements)
 

178
EEG/ERP Analysis
8.2.2.3  Psychotic Depression
It is a less common type as compared to melancholic and nonmelancholic 
depression. It has a low remission rate and is normally dealt with physical 
treatment such as antidepressants. It has the following symptoms:
	
1.	An even more severely depressed mood than the case with either 
melancholic or nonmelancholic depression
	
2.	More severe psychomotor disturbance than the case with melancholic 
depression
	
3.	Psychotic symptoms (either delusions or hallucinations, with delu-
sions being more common) and overvalued guilt ruminations
8.2.2.4  Atypical Depression
It has different symptoms as compared to other subtypes. For example, 
instead of a weight loss, weight gain; instead of appetite loss, appetite 
increase; instead of insomnia, increased sleep time. Additional features are 
as follows:
	
1.	Being able to be cheered up by pleasant events
	
2.	Significant weight gain or increase in appetite (especially with ­comfort 
foods)
	
3.	Excessive sleeping (hypersomnia)
	
4.	Heaviness in the arms and legs
	
5.	A long-standing sensitivity to interpersonal rejection; the individual 
is quick to feel that others are rejecting him or her.
8.2.2.5  Causes of Depression
Depression may be caused by multiple factors including biological, nonbi-
ological, and a combination of the two. Nonbiological causes may involve 
life events such as death of a loved one or the loss of a job, the first birth of 
a baby, postnatal effects, and so on. This is categorized under melancholic 
depression. Biological effects may be considered as biological osteoporosis 
of mental systems and are mainly included in either the nonmelancholic or 
psychotic subtypes.
8.2.2.6  Diagnosis of Depression
Depression is diagnosed based on standard clinical procedures. An individ-
ual with a potential depression problem is screened by a professional, usually 
a psychiatrist, using the DSM-IV criteria in a psychiatry clinic. The screen-
ing is normally based on standard questions, and the response can lead to 
 

179
EEG and qEEG in Psychiatry
­diagnostic conclusions. Some other clinical tools are also required to check 
the severity of depression, for example:
	
1.	Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) Scale
	
2.	Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)
	
3.	Hamilton Depression (HAM-D) Scale
	
4.	Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Scale
8.3  Clinical Treatment Methods
8.3.1  Stress
Stress response can be measured and evaluated in terms of perceptual, 
behavioral, and physical responses. One way to quantize mental stress in 
­psychological studies is through questionnaires. Several well-established 
questionnaires have been employed in clinical and psychological applica-
tions for stress evaluation, for example, the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) [4], 
the Life Events and Coping Inventory (LECI) [5], and the Stress Response 
Inventory (SRI) [6]. The PSS, designed for adults, determines the extent 
to which conditions are perceived as stress, based on experience during 
events in the ­duration of one month. It quantifies adult life in unpredictable, 
­uncontrollable, and overloaded levels. The LECI comprises 125 questions 
to measure the degree to which children experience stress in association 
with life events. The SRI consists of 39 items and produces scores for seven 
­factors of tension, violence, somatization, rage, depression, exhaustion, and 
­frustration [6].
It is also designed for adults, but the difference from the PSS is that it 
assesses mental and physical symptoms associated with psychological 
stress. Unfortunately, the questionnaires mostly rely on symptoms that 
appear after suffering from mental stress. The personal experiences in the 
past and the subject’s capacity to feel and explain the behavioral changes 
vary from one subject to another, which makes the methods very subjec-
tive. Furthermore, these methods hardly provide insight into physiological 
variability. As a result, it is difficult to detect physiological changes at the 
early stages.
8.3.2  Depression
In general, depression can be treated either psychologically or physically, or both 
types of treatment can be simultaneously applied. Physical treatment includes 
antidepressants and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Psychological treatment 
is mainly based on verbal counseling by a psychiatrist or a psychologist.
 

180
EEG/ERP Analysis
Specifically, depression that is more biological in origin (melancholic 
depression  and  psychotic depression) is more likely to need physical 
treatments  rather than psychological treatments alone. Nonmelancholic 
­depression  can be treated equally effective with  physical treatments 
(­antidepressants) or with psychological treatments.
8.4  EEG in Psychiatry
8.4.1  Stress Characterization
The effect of a real-life stressor on frontal-EEG asymmetry and negative 
health is investigated in Ref. [7]. Forty-nine subjects are tested during peri-
ods of low and high examination stress. Low examination stress period is 
the week when no test or assignment is pending for the students. The high 
examination stress period occurs in the week when students have at least 
three exams or assignment pending. Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory 
and Cohen’s Perceived Stress Scale are used for a subjective assessment 
of stress. Subjects report higher stress during the high examination stress 
period. The asymmetry in the alpha band of EEG is measured during the 
stress tests. For the EEG recording, the subject took part in eight random 
blocks of 1 min of “eyes-open” and “eyes-closed.” The results show a relative 
shift in the alpha asymmetry from the left to the right hemisphere. In other 
words, during the low examination period, the left frontal activity is greater, 
whereas a comparatively larger right frontal activity occurs during the high 
examination period.
A system is designed to categorize the subject’s tasks into three difficulty 
levels in Ref. [8]. This study aims to establish an artificial neural network 
(ANN) for an individual operator and focuses on determining the param-
eters that would be used with an ANN. The experimental design consists 
of a simulation that is divided into 5 min intervals of relaxation and low 
and high stages of difficulty. EEG, ECG, EOG, and respiration are measured 
­during the experiment, and an ANN is used for classification between 
­conditions. The extracted features to train the ANN are EEG spectral 
­features, inter-beat intervals from ECG signal, eye blinking rate and length 
of blink interval, and respiration rate. Initially, a training session of 5 min 
segments is implemented to test the algorithm; thereafter, the algorithm is 
run ­constantly to detect stress in real time. The classification accuracy of 
this system is 84.9%, 82%, and 86% for baseline, medium, and high stress 
conditions, respectively.
A thorough study is performed in Ref. [9] to analyze the EEG in order 
to identify mental states in which five subjects would have to go through 
five tasks. Every task is repeated five times, and each time, 10 s of data are 
recorded. This is the core investigation of the topic of identifying mental 
 

181
EEG and qEEG in Psychiatry
states. The tasks offered to perform in this study are: baseline, in which 
no activity is performed; arithmetic problems, in which subjects are shown 
nontrivial arithmetic multiplications to solve with static and quiet ­posture; 
and geometric figure rotation, whereby a drawing of a complex figure 
is exposed in front of the subject. After 30 s, the figure is removed, and 
the subject is instructed to visualize the rotated drawing; mental letter 
­composing is tested, whereby the subject is asked to perceptually compose 
a letter to a friend or relative, without making a noise; and visual count-
ing is tested, whereby the subject is instructed to think of an imaginary 
blackboard and imagine a sequence of numbers being written on it. This 
study did not address exactly the mental stress studies, but experiments 
implemented for the purpose of mental state identification followed the 
same procedure. Another study is conducted in Ref. [10] in order to classify 
mental tasks using EEG signals. Two experiments are performed to fulfill 
this purpose. This research did not directly address mental stress. However, 
the first experiment is performed in a similar manner as in mental stress 
studies. Eight subjects participated in this research. In the first experiment, 
three tasks are presented: “rest,” “mental arithmetic,” in which the sub-
ject is needed to mentally multiply a single digit number by a three-digit 
­number; and “mental rotation,” in which the subject is required to imagine 
particular objects. EEG signals are recorded from two parietal locations. 
The extracted features are in terms of the signal power in frequency bands 
of delta, theta, alpha, low-beta, high-beta, and gamma for each channel; the 
phase coherence in every band across channels; and the power difference 
in every band between the two channels. Additionally, the mean spectral 
power, peak frequency, peak frequency magnitude, mean phase angle, 
mean sample value, zero-crossing rate, number of samples above zero, and 
the mean spectral power difference between two input channels are also 
calculated in every frequency band. These features are applied to a Bayesian 
network. The classification accuracy is 83.8% between arithmetic and rota-
tional tasks, 86.5% for rest versus arithmetic task, and 82.9% for rest versus 
rotational task. However, the accuracy decreases to 68.3% when all three 
tasks are classified.
Another type of study performed to assess stress uses emotional meth-
ods. The contribution of these studies is to identify different emotional 
states. Most of these studies are related to maintaining concentration in a 
simulation environment. A method proposed in 2011 [11] tries to analyze 
and understand stress by categorizing emotions into its four basic types: 
happy, calm, sad, and fearful. Four subjects participated in this study. The 
EEG is recorded while displaying International Affective Picture System 
(IAPS) images as the stimulus in order to discriminate the four emotional 
states. Kernel density estimation (KDE) is employed as the feature extrac-
tion method. The extracted features are then classified using a multilayer 
perceptrons (MLP). The classification accuracy reached maxima of 73.21%, 
87.5%, 75%, and 96.43% for happy, calm, sad, and fearful classes for a single 
 

182
EEG/ERP Analysis
subject when the MLP is trained and tested with a combination of valence 
and arousal. The accuracy for the same subject is 92.68%, 55.36%, 89.29%, 
and 89.29% for the four discrete emotions, respectively, when valence and 
arousal are separately used to train and test the MLP. However, the accuracy 
of the system for all the subjects is 71.69%, 60.74%, 71.84%, and 65.94% for the 
four discrete emotions, respectively, using 5-fold cross-validation.
A study on feeling/emotion (happiness, rage, sadness, and relaxation) 
based on EEG data were described in Ref. [12]. In order to induce this 
feeling, music, television, video, and puzzle games are used. EEG data 
are recorded after the subject reports that this feeling is induced. Power 
spectra of EEG data, especially alpha, beta, and gamma bands, are used 
as features. The wavelet transform is used on 8 s of data for this purpose. 
Subsequently, principle component analysis (PCA) is applied for dimen-
sionality reduction. Ultimately, a feed-forward neural network is applied 
for feelings classification. The classifications results are 54.5%, 67.7%, 59%, 
and 62.9% for happiness, rage, sadness, and relaxation. However, another 
observation is that happiness and rage exhibit large variance of amplitude, 
whereas sorrow and relaxation exhibit a small variance. So this observation 
is approached in another way; happiness and rage are considered as one 
class, and sadness and relaxation are considered another class. Whenever 
happiness or rage is given as input, the prediction accuracy of being happy 
or enraged increases (73.2% and 94.9% for happiness and rage, respectively). 
When sadness or relaxation is given as input, the prediction accuracy of 
being sad and relaxed also increases (89.2% and 97.2% for sadness and 
relaxation, respectively).
An EEG-signal-based analysis method is proposed to inspect a driver’s 
mental response to traffic lights [13]. Driving simulation is performed in a 
virtual reality environment. This study includes nonparametric weighted 
feature extraction (NWFE), PCA, and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). 
PCA and LDA are also used for dimensionality reduction and projecting the 
data into a feature space spanned by their eigenvectors. The projected data 
are classified using a k-nearest neighbor classiﬁer (KNNC) and a naive Bayes 
classiﬁer (NBC). The experiment is conducted with six subjects for data col-
lection. The classification results show that NWFE+NBC can achieve the best 
classiﬁcation accuracy of 77%.
A study described in Ref. [14] involves two experiments. The first is 
for assessing stress among nine participating subjects. In order to induce 
stress, three difficulty levels are proposed: initial level, medium level, and 
hard level besides the rest condition at the start. Playing video games is the 
stress stimulus. EEG signals are recorded during the experiment, and the 
power spectral density (PSD) and inter-electrode coherence are extracted 
from the signals. The second experiment examines the influence of emotion 
on the EEG; the information might be used to design an interface for dis-
abled persons to interpret emotions. Instead of exploring the neural mecha-
nisms of emotions, this part of the study focused on finding EEG measures 
 

183
EEG and qEEG in Psychiatry
that would allow good discrimination between various emotional phases, 
and possibly, a quantification of emotional strength. Sound, pictures, and a 
combination of both are presented as the stimulus to 20 ­subjects who partic-
ipated in the experiment. Similar to the first ­experiment, selected ­features 
are PSD and inter-electrode coherence. An ANN is used as a classifier on 
these features.
8.4.2  Depression
Numerous qEEG studies have found increased alpha and/or theta power in a 
high percentage of depressed patients [15–22]. Antidepressants reduce alpha 
activity [18,23–26], suggesting normalization of these ­deviant qEEG features 
(in contrast to the increased alpha caused by ­neuroleptics) ­[27–29]. Inter-
hemispheric asymmetry, especially in anterior regions, has been reported 
repeatedly [30–34], as having decreased ­coherence [16,35,36].
Both EEG and qEEG studies report that a high proportion of patients 
with mood disorders display abnormal brain electrical activity. EEG stud-
ies report that small sharp spikes and paroxysmal events are often found, 
especially on the right hemisphere, and that studies on abnormal sleep are 
common. There is broad consensus in qEEG studies that increase in alpha or 
theta power, as well as asymmetry and hypocoherence in anterior regions, 
appear most often in unipolar depressed patients.
8.4.2.1  Discriminant Functions (Depression)
Conventional EEG studies have found a substantial proportion (typically 
20% to 40%) of depression patients to have EEG abnormalities, with several 
characteristic and controversial patterns, as described in Ref. [37]. In their 
review of the literature, Holschneider and Leuchter [38], taking the oppo-
site viewpoint, note that the majority of conventional EEGs are normal in 
depression, and that abnormalities are generally mild, such as a slowing 
of the posterior dominant rhythm. From this standpoint, they argue that a 
patient with severe cognitive impairment and a normal or nearly normal 
EEG may be suffering from a pseudo-dementia of depression, whereas a 
similarly impaired patient with severe EEG slowing is likely to be suffer-
ing from another disease process, such as Alzheimer’s disease. However, 
this distinction is not likely to be seen in early stages of Alzheimer’s dis-
ease, when the EEG is normal or only mildly abnormal, generally showing 
posterior slowing. Holschneider and Leuchter make the point that abnor-
mal EEGs predict functional decline regardless of the diagnostic group. 
They also argue that EEG may be more useful than neuropsychological 
tests for identifying pseudo-dementia since motivational and attentional 
problems are less likely to interfere with testing. For all of these reasons 
Holschneider and Leuchter maintain that “although an abnormal EEG in a 
depressed patient is not specific for dementia, it does identify the patients 
 

184
EEG/ERP Analysis
at greatest risk for functional decline, and therefore is a useful part of the 
evaluation.” Unfortunately, no indications of the accuracies (e.g., sensitiv-
ity, specificity) of these statements are presented, but the authors’ view 
probably reflects the informed clinical consensus when EEGs are visually 
analyzed.
qEEG studies of depression yield widely varying results depending 
­primarily on the analytic technique employed. A decade of studies reviewed 
by Pollock and Schneider [21] revealed increased alpha and beta power in 
slightly more than half, which in principle might allow discrimination of 
depression from dementia with its decreased alpha and beta. Univariate 
approaches using single qEEG feature fail to classify depressed patients 
in a clinically useful manner. In contrast, by considering several variables 
simultaneously, multivariate approaches appear to offer the ability to clas-
sify mood disorder patients in ways that are clinically useful. Hughes 
and John [37] note that numerous qEEG studies have reported increased 
power in the theta or alpha band and decreased coherence and asymmetry 
over frontal regions among unipolar depressed patients, which is essen-
tially the opposite pattern of changes seen in schizophrenia (discussed in 
the following) and which may aid in the differential diagnosis of difficult 
cases. Similarly, unipolar and bipolar depression appears to have differ-
ent patterns of qEEG changes, with schizophrenia-like alpha decreases and 
beta increases in the latter. Hughes and John suggest that this difference 
may serve to separate unipolar from bipolar patients presented in a state 
of depression without a prior history of mania, but this distinction may 
be compromised by antidepressant medication, which tends to reduce the 
excessive alpha among unipolar depressed patients.
8.4.2.2  Depression Detection
Using multivariate qEEG techniques, the accurate separation of depressed 
from healthy individuals has been demonstrated repeatedly and replicated 
in large samples. Prichep and John [39] attained 83% sensitivity and 89% 
specificity (jackknife replicated to 81% and 87%, respectively). A four-way 
classification (healthy, depression, alcoholism, and dementia) identified 
depressed individuals with 73% (jackknife replicated to 65%) sensitivity 
and 84% (jackknife replicated to 76%) specificity. A follow-up [16] using 
the same four-way classification identified depressed individuals with 
72% sensitivity and 77% specificity (independently replicating to 85% and 
75%, respectively). Higher accuracies are reported by John et al. [40], who 
found that depressed individuals could be separated from their healthy 
counterparts using a two-way discriminant with 83% sensitivity and 
86% specificity (independently replicated at 93% and 88%, respectively). 
A three-way discriminant (healthy, depression, and dementia) identified 
depressed patients with 84% sensitivity and specificity (independently 
replicated at 80% and 85%, ­respectively), and a four-way discriminant 
 

185
EEG and qEEG in Psychiatry
(healthy, depression, alcoholism, and dementia) identified them with 72% 
sensitivity and 77% specificity (independently replicated at 85% and 75%, 
respectively).
These results also demonstrate the trade-off between the number of 
simultaneous discriminations (the number of possible diagnostic catego-
ries into which a patient might be placed) and the accuracy (sensitivity and 
specificity) of the discrimination. This trade-off highlights the principle 
that qEEG does not take the physician out of the diagnostic loop. The more 
the physician knows about the patient, the more alternative ­diagnoses 
can be excluded a priori, and the more accurate the qEEG ­discrimination 
can be.
8.4.2.3  Differential Diagnostic Classification
Several replicated qEEG studies of differential diagnostic classifications 
of depression versus other disorders have been based on four-way dis-
criminants. Prichep and John [39] used a four-way discriminant to ­identify 
depressed patients with 73% (jackknife replicated to 65%) sensitivity, with 
specificities of 73% (73%) versus dementia and 74% (64%) versus ­alcoholism. 
John et al. [16,40] used a four-way discriminant with independent ­replication 
and achieved sensitivities of 72% (85%) for depression, with specificities 
of 79% (77%) versus dementia and 80% (90%) versus ­alcoholism. The lat-
ter report also used a two-way discriminant with independent replication 
to categorize depressed patients with 84% (88%) sensitivity and 84% (85%) 
specificity versus schizophrenia. Similarly, a three-way discriminant cat-
egorized depressed patients with 84% (80%) sensitivity and a specificity of 
84% (71%) versus dementia. Finally, a four-way discriminant with indepen-
dent replication achieved 72% (85%) sensitivity for depression with speci-
ficities of 79% (77%) for dementia and 80% (80%) for alcoholism. The crucial 
­differentiation between unipolar and bipolar mood disorders has been 
assessed using multivariate techniques by Prichep and John [39], who 
reported jackknife replicated unipolar classification sensitivities of 87% 
(87%) and specificities of 90% (85%) versus bipolar patients. John et al. [16] 
found nearly identical unipolar sensitivities of 85% (85%) and specificities of 
85% (87%) versus bipolar, and John and Prichep [41] reported independently 
replicated unipolar sensitivities of 84% (87%) versus bipolar specificities 
of 88% (94%). Prichep et al. [36] similarly found independently replicated 
unipolar sensitivities of 91% (76%) versus specificities of 83% (75%) for 
bipolar patients. These already high accuracies could be boosted further 
by adding quantitative evoked potential (QEP) data, giving independently 
replicated unipolar sensitivities of 98% (76%) and specificities of 91% (82%) 
versus bipolar. Some caution must be exercised, however, in generalizing 
results from primary depression to the secondary depression seen so often 
in clinical practice. Prichep et al. [42] studied qEEG characteristics of crack 
cocaine dependence and noted that 28 patients (54% of the total sample) 
 

186
EEG/ERP Analysis
had a secondary diagnosis of major depression. When a previously used 
­depression discriminant is applied to this group, it successfully ­identified 
only 8 of the 28 patients, for a sensitivity of 29%.
8.4.2.4   Prediction of Treatment Response for Depression
One of the suggested uses of qEEG is to predict the most effective ­treatment 
for a given patient, and one of the most frequently cited papers in this regard 
is from Suffin and Emory [43]. These authors recorded un-medicated qEEG, 
treatment, and reported outcome data from 54 patients diagnosed with 
DSM-III-R “affective” (mood) disorders (major depression, bipolar ­disorder, 
depressive disorders not otherwise specified) and from 46 patients ­suffering 
from ADD/ADHD. Although actual treatments varied, ­affective disorder 
patients generally are treated with antidepressants, to which ­anticonvulsants 
or lithium are added in refractory cases, followed by stimulants in those cases 
that are still unresponsive. Attention deficit patients generally are treated 
initially with stimulants, then antidepressants, and finally ­anticonvulsants 
for increasingly refractory cases. Pretreatment spectral analysis revealed sig-
nificantly increased alpha in some patients and increased theta in others. 
It also revealed hyper-­coherence among some but not other patients.
The authors “heuristically” divide the data into frontal alpha excess, fron-
tal theta excess, and “other” groups, the last of which (N = 19) is essentially 
dropped from further analysis or discussion. When treatment data from the 
remaining subjects are analyzed, patients with similar neurometric features 
are found to respond to the same classes of medications, despite their differ-
ing DSM-III-R diagnoses. For example, summarizing their findings they state, 
“The frontal theta excess group is 100% responsive to stimulants,” which is 
an exciting finding. The ability of qEEG to predict treatment response would 
have immediate clinical utility and might further suggest the presence of 
an underlying electrophysiological taxonomy of psychiatric disorders not 
entirely congruent with DSM. Unfortunately, major flaws in design, analy-
sis, and reporting plague the Suffin and Emory [43] study, and many of their 
conclusions appear to be overstatements of their findings. For example, the 
summary statement that the frontal theta excess group is 100% responsive to 
stimulants might lead the reader to think that all of the 21 patients found to 
have frontal theta excess also responded to stimulant medication. However, 
in the paper it is stated, “The frontal theta excess/­normocoherent subgroup 
appeared only in the attentionally disordered clinical population. In that 
population it is 100% responsive to stimulants.” Indeed, the data shows only 
seven of these patients to have responded to stimulants, and all seven had 
attentional disorders. This and a host of similar problems make the conclu-
sions somewhat less exciting than they at first appear. However, the paper 
does illustrate the importance of identifying subgroups in making treat-
ment predictions, and in that regard it serves as a valuable addition to the 
literature.

8.5  Case Study of Mental Stress
This section provides a case study of mental stress. The following sections 
provide a brief methodology and results of the study.
8.5.1  Experiment and Subjects
The experiment consists of six sequential phases, as shown in Figure 8.1. 
Phase one requires a subject to perform training by solving sample 
­questions. Phase two involves placing sensors and checking the impedance. 
The third phase requires habituation for 5 min for the subjects to get used 
to the ­environment. Physiological signal recording does not start until phase 
four, that is, Rest 1. It performs collection of baseline data by asking subjects 
to look at the circle in the center of the screen for 5 min. Phase five involves 
performing the task phase for 20 min in which the subject is required to 
solve experimental tasks. The last phase (Rest 2) is the recovery phase, where 
physiological signals are collected by staring at a circle in the center of the 
screen. The minimum duration between two sessions is seven days in order 
to minimize the learning effect.
The experiment contains two groups of subjects: stress and nonstress (the 
control). In both cases, the core task is the same, that is, to solve mental arith-
metic problems. The difference is that in the stress condition there is a time 
restriction along with stressful feedback and statements. However, that is not 
the case for the controlled condition.
During the experiment, two steps are performed: half the subjects appear 
in the stress session followed by the control session and half the subjects 
appear in the control session followed by the stress session. The task phase 
in the stress and control sessions is divided into four levels of increasing dif-
ficulty as shown in Figure 8.2. The duration of each level is 5 min.
In every level, multiple trials of the same difficulty are repeated. In the 
stress session, the duration to solve a trial is fixed. After the trial, a feed-
back is displayed in words: “correct,” “incorrect,” or “no response” based on

stress session, the feedback display also shows the average performance at a 
particular level as well as the response time in order to pressurize the subject 
further. Moreover, in the stress session, after a certain number of trials at 
every level, a stressful interrupt pops up showing some stimulating state-
ments such as “Don’t guess answers,” “Your performance is below average,” 
and so on. In the control session, only “correct” or “incorrect” messages will 
be displayed.
Individual performance is quantified based on the task difficulty at every 
level using the formula shown in (8.1). It varies from 0 (min.) to 1 (max.).

Ten healthy male subjects (age: 19–25 years) are recruited for this study 
based on the following criteria: their previous medical record, for example, 
they must have no head injury and must not be on any medication that 
might increase cardiac activation. The selected subjects need to fast for at 
least 2 h before the start of the experiment. Each subject also needs to sign an 
informed consent agreeing to participate and will be given an honorarium of 
RM40 for his or her contribution.
8.5.2  Data Acquisition and Analysis
EEG and ECG data are simultaneously measured during the experiment. 
The data are acquired using an Electrical Geodesic Inc. (EGI) Net Amps 
300 ­amplifier and Net Station 4.4.5 acquisition software. EEG data is recorded 
using the 129 electrodes cap with reference at the Cz location at a sampling 
rate of 500 ­samples per second. The reference of offline signals is changed 
to the average mastoid. The impedance of all the electrodes is kept below 
50 kΩ. Two Ag/AgCl surface electrodes are patched onto the bottom of the 
neck to measure the ECG at 500 samples per second using the same system. 
ECG signals are later downsampled to 200 samples per second before heart 
rate variability (HRV) analysis.

EEG and qEEG in Psychiatry
EEG data is manually cleaned to remove artifacts. After that, data for 
1 min is selected to keep the test-retest reliability of data at 95% [44]. Heart 
rate (HR) analysis is performed on the 5 min blocks of Rest 1 and Rest 2 and 
task levels (levels 1, 2, 3, and 4), respectively. The paired t-test is applied on 
the results of the ratio Fz(θ)/Pz(α), the HR, and performance in order to mea-
sure significance. It is applied between the ratio Fz(θ)/Pz(α) and the HR in 
every level under both stress and control conditions with respect to the Rest 
1 conditions. The same levels in stress and control are also tested for the ratio 
Fz(θ)/Pz(α), the HR, and performance. The details of calculating the ratio 
Fz(θ)/Pz(α) and HR can be found in Ref. [45].
8.5.3  Results
The experiment results are provided in the following three sections. 
The results are analyzed in stress vs. control conditions.
8.5.3.1  Performance Results
Figure 8.3 shows the task difficulty at every task level of the stress and con-
trol sessions. It is evident from the figure that difficulty for the stress session 
is considerably higher than for control session for all the levels. Under the 
stress conditions, the difficulty of solving tasks continuously increases with 
every level (0.42, 0.5, 0.59, and 0.76). Under the control condition the difficulty 
at levels 2 and 3 varies slightly, but at other levels it increases continuously 
(0.25, 0.35, 0.33, and 0.53). The subjects are less able to solve trials correctly 
under stress conditions as compared to the control conditions. This differ-
ence in task difficulty under stress and control is significant (p < 0.003 in all 
levels), which shows the poor performance and trouble faced under stress 
conditions.

EEG/ERP Analysis
8.5.3.2  EEG Results
Figure 8.4 presents results of the ratio Fz(θ)/Pz(α) for all the subjects during 
Rest 1, for every task level, and during Rest 2. The ratios show a significant 
difference in values for tasks as compared to Rest 1 (p < 0.013). The ratio 
also indicates significant difference between stress and control sessions at 
levels 1, 2, and 3 (p < 0.042). The ratio in Rest 1 is very precise for both the 
sessions (1.26 and 1.3 in stress and control, respectively), which implies that 
the baseline for both conditions is almost ­identical. In the stress session, 
the first three levels of stress continuously increase (2.04, 2.12, and 2.31 at 
levels 1, 2, and 3). However, at level 4, the ratio slightly decreases (2.25). 
This reduction indicates that subjects may have lost interest in attempting 
to solve questions because of the restricted time and extreme difficulty at 
level 4. Therefore, θ in Fz is reduced in power, which is reflected in the ratio 
at level 4 of stress. In the control session, the ratio shows a similar pattern 
as shown by the task difficulty. In the first two levels, the ratios increase 
(1.69 and 1.92 in levels 1 and 2, respectively), then decrease for level 3 (1.84), 
and then increase for level 4 (2.05). The ratio during Rest 2 in both con-
ditions revert back toward the baseline level (1.36 and 1.31 for stress and 
control, respectively), which indicates that the subject recovers after the 
experiment.
8.5.3.3  HR Results
Figure 8.5 illustrates the results of HR at all levels in the stress and control 
sessions. It is seen that the HR increases significantly for all task levels in 
stress and control sessions with respect to individual Rest 1 (p < 0.05 at all 
levels of stress and control). However, the HR fails to display any signifi-
cance between stress and control conditions.

EEG and qEEG in Psychiatry
8.6  Conclusion
This chapter presents a number of biomarkers using conventional and qEEG 
techniques for stress, unipolar depression, and alcohol addiction. The impor-
tance of qEEG techniques is highlighted in the literature. A case study is 
introduced with stress assessment. Both EEG and qEEG studies report that 
a high proportion of patients with stress, depression, and alcohol addiction 
display abnormal brain electrical activity. There is a broad consensus in 
qEEG studies that an increase in alpha or theta power, as well as asymmetry 
and hypo-coherence in anterior regions, appeared most often in depressed 
patients. Therefore, qEEG can be potentially used as a diagnosis or discrimi-
nant tool for these conditions.

9.1  Introduction
Recently, brain imaging techniques have been developed by numerous 
efforts directed at multimodal data fusion, which seeks to combine high-­
temporal resolution information, as can be provided by electromagnetic-
based techniques (M-EEG), with high-spatial resolution, as has been 
traditionally achieved by the use of hemodynamic-based neuroimaging 
methods such as positron emission tomography (PET) and functional mag-
netic resonance imaging (fMRI) [1]. In particular, the EEG/fMRI fusion has 
been well known for more than a decade owing to the higher levels of 
information on brain activity that can be obtained by the simultaneous

EEG/ERP Analysis
combination of these complementary modalities, and the significantly 
increasing capacities for ­carrying out these studies [2,3].
EEG is a widely used brain mapping technique because it is cheaper, 
­portable, and irreplaceable for mapping transient brain activity as in ­epileptic 
studies. The main advantage of EEG is that it is a direct ­measurement of elec-
trical activity in the brain via voltage sensors on the scalps and provides a 
milliseconds temporal resolution measurement of brain activity [4]. The EEG 
can be stated mathematically by using traditional forward models that gather 
together the biophysics of dynamic local field potential and their propagation 
across the brain volume conductor medium until the ­conversion applied to 
voltage measurements at the scalp sensors. Analogously, forward models are 
posed for MEG technique where sensors measure the magnetic field associ-
ated with its locally tangential electrical field. Sources of ­electrical activity that 
possibly contribute to the M-EEG signals are glial potentials, neuronal action 
potentials, dipolar/quadrupolar electrical fields ­associated with excitatory 
and inhibitory post-synaptic potentials, and so on. It is widely accepted that 
the main contribution to M-EEG signals is the stable and strong dipole ­created 
by the synchronized activity of the ­palisade-structured pyramidal cells, 
which are oriented perpendicular to the cortical surface [5]. Unfortunately, 
estimating the sources of M-EEG ­signals as ­surrogate of underlying bioelec-
tric activity is an ill-posed ­problem given that multiple current configurations 
can produce similar M-EEG ­measurements and that deep sources are highly 
affected by the low signal/noise rate which is worsened by the smearing 
properties of the skull for the EEG, and the dampening of the magnetic field 
because of the quasi-radial orientation of deep magnetic sources on the MEG 
sensor space [6,7]. These problems are numerically ­evidenced by the fact that 
forward models usually produce kernels that are ill-conditioned [4].
In the past two decades, fMRI became the standard technique for neuroimag-
ing studies due mainly to its noninvasiveness and the fact that it allows direct 
measurements in the source space. This technique emerged naturally from 
developments in the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and magnetic reso-
nance imaging (MRI) fields. The latter ­originally allowed the structural map-
ping of the brain by exploiting the magnetic ­properties of the 1H nuclei. Using 
similar principles, Ogawa et al. [8] ­developed the ­blood-oxygen-level-dependent 
(BOLD) contrast based on the ­paramagnetic properties of the deoxygenate 
hemoglobin. When the functional ­capabilities were further developed, fMRI 
became essential for cognitive and behavioral studies [9]. In summary, fMRI 
allows quantifying the ­metabolic-hemodynamic cascade associated with local 
neuronal activity, and thus it is a reflex of the accompanying changes in blood 
flow and the deoxyhemoglobin content in the surrounding tissue [10]. This 
allows the whole brain to be mapped by the acquisition of 3D functional vol-
umes that are separated by few seconds down to hundreds of milliseconds. This 
poor temporal resolution is just a minor limitation of this technique: the prin-
cipal limitation is the ­sluggishness of the hemodynamic cascade, which only 
allows for a crude representation of the rich dynamics of neuronal processes.

Perspectives of M-EEG and fMRI Data Fusion
The basic neuroimaging unit is the voxel, which in current functional 
studies may have a spatial resolution of 3 × 3 × 3 mm3. According to esti-
mates, this typical voxel contains approximately 0.9 million neurons, 3.6 km 
of dendrites, and 36 km of axons, with less than 3% of the space occupied by 
capillaries, which provide the energetic elements required for brain activity 
and endorse the millimetric resolution of the fMRI [3]. However, as a mea-
sure of the metabolic consumptions in the voxel unit, the fMRI measure has 
other important drawbacks for recording the brain activity directly: (1) its 
potential inability to identify different balances of excitatory and inhibitory 
activity and (2) the changes in the density of small vessels and neuronal ele-
ments across the voxels in the different cortical and subcortical regions. The 
latter variability can be observed in the fMRI changes across the different 
brain regions. Despite these serious limitations, the use of fMRI has enabled 
the mapping of important brain functions, for example, visual, auditory, sen-
sorimotor, and some integration areas; and it is currently actively used in the 
study of more complex systems such as those involved in memory, language, 
reasoning production, and emotions processing, among others [11].
The combination of EEG and fMRI has been proved clinically necessary 
by many current studies, while technically Ives et al. [12] showed for first 
time the feasibility of conjoint recording for EEG and fMRI signals. In the 
beginning, cognitive experiments used conjoint but interleaved recordings 
in order to exclude the scanner and other artifacts from the EEG analyzed 
segments. Today this is no longer necessary, and we can focus more on anal-
ysis and less in artifact-rejecting tasks thanks to the development of robust 
artifact detection techniques in the last few years (see Ref. [13] for a historical 
review). Multimodal measurements, such as by fusing EEG and fMRI mea-
surements, can help neuroscientists to understand the nature and structure 
of cerebral activity better by exploiting the strengths for each modality. Thus, 
the main objective of this combination is to improve the spatial and temporal 
resolutions for the particular analyses [14].
In this pursuit, we have to also take into consideration the possible confound-
ing for EEG/fMRI fusion. These are mainly threefold: (1) the absence of local 
field potential (LFP) recordings, due to a closed-field geometry of neuronal syn-
aptic processes, while we still should be able to measure the BOLD response 
because of the metabolic activity; (2) change of LFP activity by synchronization 
of neuronal processes while keeping constant the balance of metabolic con-
sumption; then we have changes in EEG activity but stable BOLD signal; and 
(3) glial cell metabolism, neurotransmitter replenishment, and other processes 
that do not directly involve the postsynaptic process but may elicit the BOLD 
response [3,6]. However, we may overestimate the impacts of these confound-
ing factors if we ignore the low-band filtering properties of the BOLD signal. 
For example, interneurons with star-shaped dendrites make a weak contribu-
tion to LFP, though they contribute indirectly because of their effects on synap-
tic processes of pyramidal cells. This can be put in another perspective: lagged 
responses in LFP are associated with very similar BOLD waveforms [15].

EEG/ERP Analysis
Next we review several outstanding current approaches. We personally 
advocate integrative models mainly because they are directly based on 
the biophysical modeling of M-EEG/fMRI signals. This approach has the 
advantage that strengths and limitations can be considered directly for each 
modality during the modeling; however, see Ref. [16] for dealing with these 
problems using some carefully designed pipelined approaches.
9.2  Methods for M-EEG/fMRI Fusion
Currently, M-EEG/fMRI approaches are classified with respect to the 
­symmetric/​asymmetric relationship of developed analyses. In the former, 
the modalities have equal relevancies in the analyses. That is, there is no 
bias of relying more on one modality, for example, estimating parameters 
for some particular model by assigning equal weights to the fitting cost 
functions for the different data [17]. Otherwise, the asymmetric approaches 
are subdivided into (1) M-EEG oriented, where the M-EEG modalities are 
the main focus of the analyses, and fMRI is only used to restrict the space of 
solutions [18,19]; and (2) fMRI oriented, where features are extracted from 
M-EEG signals, or ERP-ERF analysis, and after convolving with conve-
nient hemodynamic response functions, the obtained time series are used 
as standard covariates in generalized linear models, which is a classical 
step in statistical parametric mapping (SPM) of SPM-based analyses [20] 
(see also Refs. [21,22] for further discussion).
However, in our opinion, this division does not establish a clear ­distinction 
among the developed methods. For example, in (1) the significant regions 
detected in fMRI analyses that are viewed as prior information for M-EEG 
inverse problems can be used in a Bayesian or regularization framework, 
where control hyperparameters and assumed prior ­distributions are used 
to modelize the available information; being estimated as part of the 
­optimization process. Therefore, the prior information weights change 
gradually during the optimization, which occurs in parallel with the ­fitness 
of the data; it can be shown using primal/dual theory that both parts 
(cost and penalty functions) are interchangeable and are thus relatively 
­symmetric. On the other hand, the mathematical modeling for generating 
M-EEG and fMRI signals simultaneously has to consider that these data 
have ­different scales, distinct signal/noise rates, and contain complemen-
tary traits of the brain ­spatiotemporal dynamics. The way that we capture 
the realism for each modality, relying more or less on some modalities 
in order to reflect their ­faithfulness with the neuronal activity, automati-
cally impose ­different weights to each ­modality [23,24]. In our opinion, the 
­division between ­symmetric and asymmetric approaches is philosophical 
rather than mathematical.
 

199
Perspectives of M-EEG and fMRI Data Fusion
We prefer here a more traditional classification based on the ­mathematical/
computational procedure that is followed for combining the multimodal 
data. In Figure 9.1, we introduce a scheme that illustrates this criterion for 
separating the current approaches. In summary, data-guided approaches 
usually lead to a pipeline of procedures for extracting the ­common ­features 
and extracting the accompanying information. (We do not use the term 
­data-driven because we believe that data-guided is a more flexible term and 
does not exclude the use of interleaved models in the analysis.) On the 
­contrary, integrative-model approaches are based on the elaboration of real-
istic ­models that simultaneously generate the multimodal data. We may 
think that the former is suboptimal compared to the latter because the differ-
ent modalities only contribute to the analyses separately. However, integra-
tive-model approaches may also be biased because they do not adequately 
represent the complexity of brain dynamics. In the following, we review 
each subdivision by separate with focus on the more outstanding results. 
Obviously, the proposed criterion is much simpler than the previous crite-
rion, and we think that it avoids the confusions introduced by the latter.
9.2.1  Correlation between BOLD and M-EEG Signals in Particular Bands
Mantini et al. [25] analyzed simultaneous recording of EEG and fMRI data 
for 15 healthy subjects in order to study resting state networks (RSNs). 
In ­particular, they selected six RSNs using temporal independent ­component 
analysis of the BOLD signal, which represented the 44 ± 6% variability of the 
data. For all the participants, they tested the components’ spatial replicabil-
ity and consistency using, respectively, the multidimensional scaling tech-
nique and comparing the extracted components for the first 2 min with those 
extracted for the last 2 min. On the contrary, after cleaning the EEG data of the 
MRI scanner and other artifacts, five waveforms were computed as the time-
varying EEG power for delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma bands. Owing 
to the significant correlations among these waveforms, Mantini et al. [25]

claimed that, in particular, slow and fast rhythms are not independent, and 
thus a multivariate analysis is necessary to study the relationship between 
EEG rhythms and fluctuations in the BOLD signal. Their results are in agree-
ment with many previous studies about RSNs and the concordance between 
BOLD signal fluctuation and EEG rhythms.
For example, the analysis of the spatiotemporal patterns of their estimated 
RSN3 corroborates the disassociation between the alpha rhythm and the 
BOLD signal in the occipital cortex [26,27]. However they were able to obtain 
a wider range of interactions including also delta, theta, and beta rhythms. 
A similar link is established for their results for RSN1 and the positive correla-
tion that Laufs et al. [28,29] reported for the 17–23 Hz beta-II rhythm in the pos-
terior cingulate, dorsomedial prefrontal gyrus, and temporoparietal junction.
9.2.2  Extract Common Spatial Signatures for M-EEG and fMRI
The currently most used approaches for extracting joint features from 
M-EEG and fMRI signals simultaneously are ICA-based methods. There are 
many proposed procedures that are well reviewed by Calhoun et al. [30]. 
In the beginning, they proposed the joint ICA (jICA) procedure for fusing 
the temporal M-EEG with the spatial fMRI information, thus ignoring their 
respective spatial and temporal parts [31]. For example, for a classical audi-
tory oddball task with 23 normal subjects, they computed for each subject 
(1) the time-locked ERP waveform and (2) the fMRI activation maps (SPM-
based ROI analysis), thus obtaining the corresponding data

ERP, 
where V and T are the number of spatial and temporal points, respectively.
Next, they exploited the data variability and implemented a jICA algorithm 
based on the infomax principle [32]. They assumed that both the fMRI and 
ERP extracted from spatial/temporal waveforms can be predicted using a 
unique mixing matrix 
∈
×

A
N C, where N is the number of subjects (N = 23 in 
their experiment) and C is the number of jICA components to be determined 
by the algorithm. They proposed to estimate the latter using the minimum 
description length criteria [33].
The jICA method is determined by the formula
	
YfMRI = AS fMRI, and YERP = ASERP.	
(9.1)
The outputs of this algorithm are the jICA components’ spatial sources 
(S fMRI) and their corresponding temporal sources (SERP), which are estimated 
by computing the critical unmixing matrix of ICA-based algorithms [32]. The 
family of ICA-based algorithms has continued evolving in a way that resem-
bles the vanilla cake or tutti-frutti linear model varieties, that is, for all possible 
combinations and tasters. Currently, these algorithms concatenate together 
the fMRI and M-EEG signals either spatially or temporally (depending on the 
analysis) and extract adaptively ICA components that “separate” the multi-
modal data in independent waveforms (see Figure 1 in Moosmann et al. [34] 
 

201
Perspectives of M-EEG and fMRI Data Fusion
and Figure 5 in Calhoun et al. [35]). In this analysis, the M-EEG signal is 
­usually convolved with the hemodynamic response function (HRF) in order 
to alleviate the temporal differences between these modalities.
A somehow different approach is decomposing the data into two or more 
“cores.” This can be done simultaneously for several modalities where 
some “equivalent cores” can be cross-linked in order to extract common 
information from the modalities. In this vein, Martinez-Montes et al. [36] 
­proposed using the PARAFAC tensor decomposition and the multiway 
partial least squares algorithm for fusing M-EEG and fMRI data. Similar 
to Mantini et al. [25] and Goldman et al. [26], they computed the time-­varying 
spectra and analyze all the frequencies instead of the banded spectra, and 
consider all the ­derivations in the analysis. As a result, they created a 3D 
­tensor of dimensions corresponding to the number of spatial (electrodes), 
spectral, and temporal measurements for keeping the transformed EEG data. 
On the contrary, the fMRI data were collected in a 2D matrix of dimensions 
­corresponding to the ­number of spatial (voxels) and temporal measurements. 
From the creation process, both matrices have in common the number of 
temporal measurements, which coincides with the number of fMRI ­volumes. 
Later, they ­proceed to apply PARAFAC and matrix ­factorization methods 
to both matrices, respectively, but linking the temporal dimension by a 
­mathematical expression that aims to maximize the covariance between the 
temporal atoms. Similarly, but arranging the M-EEG-derived information in 
a standard matrix form, Correa et al. [37] proposed a multimodal canoni-
cal ­correlation analysis (mCCA) as a hybrid between the previous procedure 
and the ICA-based decompositions. The latter avoid the tensor decomposi-
tion approximation and also is more flexible, being able to include more than 
two modalities in the analysis (see also Correa et al. [38]).
Some of these methods have been extensively validated with simulations and 
the analyses of real data, which is evidence that nonparametric approaches are 
also capable of yielding interesting conclusions (see Correa et al. [38], which 
we have discussed in greater detail in the section on clinical applications). 
However, these methods have a serious limitation, which in essence is that 
they consistently ignore the volume conductor properties of the head and 
then establish direct connections between the M-EEG signals and the fMRI. 
In addition, we are of the opinion that the simulations used are nonrealistic 
and this, together with the lack of a reference and a generative model, makes a 
cautious interpretation of the extracted components necessary. Therefore, we 
firmly believe that our understanding of why and how these methods work 
must be fine-tuned with a benchmark of realistic simulations.
9.2.3  M-EEG-Informed and fMRI-Informed Analyses
These analyses can be performed on conjoint recorded EEG and fMRI data 
or in separate analysis that can include MEG, ECoG, and other modalities. 
The  basic idea is to undertake preliminary analysis using one particular 
 

202
EEG/ERP Analysis
modality, and use the results to guide further investigation of the ­multimodal 
data. These analyses may be conducted using data that is recorded either 
conjointly or separately The main advantage of conjoint recording is that 
the modalities are similarly affected for the same environment, stimulus 
synchrony, and subject state. This is mandatory for continuous tracking of 
an ERP that also requires its localization [20,39,40], because the M-EEG and 
fMRI signals are affected by the experimental conditions [41]. In ­addition, 
­M-EEG-informed studies for conjoint data are an indispensable tool for study-
ing transient epileptic activity, for example, using the onsets of spikes for ROI-
based analysis with the aim of detecting the epileptic focus. Benar et al. [40] 
also claimed that conjoint recordings are necessary for auditory paradigms 
where the noisy condition affects the subject’s brain activity and response. 
On the contrary, it can also be claimed that separate recordings may allow 
optimizing the experiment, considering different sessions’ duration, stimu-
lus intensity, and the sequence for each modality in order to increase the sig-
nal noise rate and reduce the subject’s discomfort. One obvious advantage 
of separate analyses is that related data obtained from different laboratories 
can be combined. This potential advantage is not fully exploited yet, maybe 
because of the lack of installed facilities for worldwide data sharing.
In an important application of asymmetric studies, Debener et al. [20] used 
both M-EEG-informed for fMRI analysis and fMRI-informed for M-EEG 
analysis to predict hemodynamic changes in the rostral cingulate zone 
(RCZ) that correlate with the extracted error-related negativity (ERN) inde-
pendent component for a performance-monitoring task. The fMRI-informed 
approach was used to determine a dipole located in the RCZ that explained 
90.2% of the ERN component variance. The RCZ’s ROIs were selected by 
standard fMRI analysis contrasting the corresponding conditions; then an 
EEG-informed analysis allowed predicting the BOLD signal changes for 
this  dipole, thus demonstrating the coupling between the fMRI and the 
­single-trial ERN. Other similar studies report significant fMRI activation for 
single-trial changes of N1, P2, and P3 amplitudes [42] and also for changes 
in the P3 latency [40].
Another perspective is obtained when spatial information extracted from 
SPM-ROI analysis is used to constrain the space of solutions for M-EEG 
inverse problems. In this case, mismatches between the M-EEG and fMRI 
signals can produce bias in the inverse solution. However, in some situations, 
this can be nicely checked; for example, Debener et al. [20] tested ­several 
dipoles that predict the variability of the ERN component very poorly 
compared to the dipole selected in the RCZ (see the foregoing ­discussion). 
The  fMRI-informed approach has changed the development of M-EEG 
inverse methods. Now, researchers either use the task-related activations of 
fMRI studies to restrict the generator locations [18–20,43] or use this informa-
tion in a general Bayesian framework [17,24]. Interestingly, without requir-
ing fMRI priors, Friston et al. [44] proposed a multiple sparse priors (MSP) 
algorithm based on modeling variance components corresponding to small 
 

203

cortical patches. This can be seen as an adaptive extension of the Bayesian 
modeling averaging (BMA) methodology introduced by Trujillo-Barreto 
et al. [45]. Henson et al. [24] compared the MSP algorithm with a similar 
Bayesian approach that additionally uses fMRI priors, but they did not find 
an improvement in the MSP results due to fMRI priors. However, MSP is 
critically restricted to cortical surfaces, ignoring possible deep sources that 
can be recovered with the fusion methodology.
9.2.4  DCM-Based Generative Models
The central idea of dynamic causal modeling (DCM) is to create a simpli-
fied but plausible mathematical model for neuronal dynamics. This should 
be able to produce realistic neuronal signaling by interconnecting different 
elements that stand for neuronal populations. These elements can be topo-
graphically identified as voxels or ROIs and thus can be simultaneously 
linked to generators of magneto-electroencephalographic and BOLD signals. 
Currently, the estimation is restricted to low-scale systems owing to limita-
tions in the numerical algorithms; therefore, the connections can only repre-
sent long-range interactions in the brain.
The DCM equation for bilinear systems as stated in the seminal paper [46] 
can be written using the system of ordinary differential equations:

n 1 is a time-varying vector containing the time series for each 
element, uj(t) represents each of the inputs j = 1,K,m that perturb the system, 
A represents the elements’ connectivity, and C denotes the direct influence 
of inputs over the system elements. The bilinear term is controlled by the 
matrices Bj that modulate the second-order interactions between inputs and 
the elements’ dynamic.
Usually, dynamic causal models (DCMs) are linked to hemodynamic state 
equations in different ways to disclose the hidden neuronal connectivity that 
is responsible for the BOLD signal measured in an fMRI experiment [47,48]. 
This approach is not free of difficulties, because of the sluggishness of the 
hemodynamic response and the consequent ill-posedness of the deconvolu-
tion problem. However, these models have shown their usefulness for inter-
preting real data [46,49,50]. The development of DCMs has been essentially 
determined for cognitive studies with controlled conditions, taking for granted 
the influence of an exogenous input. This may handicap the development of 
stochastic DCMs, which are not constrained by such assumptions. However, 
Daunizeau et al. [51,52] showed the potentialities of this new methodology. 
A much less explored but potentially much more interesting approach is to fit 
DCMs to recorded electrocorticogram activity, which should provide richer 
 

204

information about the content of neuronal processing. We find the fusion of 
ECoG with fMRI recordings an attractive approach that may be done con-
jointly or in separated studies, but using the same stimulation paradigm; for 
example, the brain language areas can be explored directly with intracortical 
recording and stimulation previously a mandatory surgical intervention [53].
9.2.5  Granger-Causality-Based Models
Developing in parallel with DCMs is a methodology based on Granger 
­causality to represent the typical cause-effect relationship of ­neuronal 
­information processing. These models are simpler in the sense that they 
do not rely on differential equations and are usually stated using linear 
­interactions. At the same time, this is both an advantage and a ­disadvantage 
for ­studies of brain connectivity. The linearity allows granger causality can be 
applied to analysis of ­high-dimensional data, thus overcoming missing data 
problems by ­considering as much information as possible [54,55]. In particu-
lar, Garg et al. [55] estimated whole brain connectivity using the Blue Gene 
supercomputer and a full-brain autoregressive modeling (FARM) approach. 
However, in order to deal with these high dimensions, it was necessary to 
use Lasso/LARS regressions [56] under the valid assumption that brain con-
nectivity is remarkably sparse. Otherwise, the intrinsic nonlinearities of neu-
ronal processing can lead to spurious findings [57], which implies that the 
brain connectivity findings based on Granger causality should be considered 
functional rather than effective; this is the subject of ongoing discussions 
[57–60]. Currently, it is accepted that Granger causality allows explorations of 
brain-effective connectivity [60].
fMRI brain connectivity studies based on Granger causality are sustained 
mainly by two assumptions: (1) the HRF exhibits a small variability across the 
different brain regions and (2) the hemodynamic effect can be represented 
with a convolution without additional effects on coupling [61]. Garg et al. [55] 
showed with simulations that FARM may provide valuable information over 
the brain effective connectivity whenever this variability is comparable to 
the time scale of the information processing in the brain, as in the case of 
evoked potential studies. In addition, they hypothesized that FARM could 
generate useful information for studies of default mode networks, which 
assume a background brain state with waves that oscillate with frequencies 
lower than 0.1 Hz, which is supposed to sustain conscious brain dynamics. 
However, as a personal conclusion about this study, FARM’s strengths lie in 
estimating the connection directionality rather than its strength, and many 
spurious influences may arise as result of the discretization of transient brain 
dynamics and the HRF-based assumptions. Smith et al. [62] discussed a set 
of realistic simulations that showed general limitations for these approaches.
In order to close the gap between Granger-based and dynamic causal 
models, several new methodologies have been proposed. An issue that has 
been attacked is the instantaneous associations that arise in fMRI ­analysis. 
 

205
Perspectives of M-EEG and fMRI Data Fusion
Independently, Faes and Nollo [63] and Gates et  al. [64] proposed new 
­autoregressive models to estimate mixed lagged and instantaneous influ-
ences. Additionally, Faes and Nollo [63] proposed an extension of ­partial 
directed coherence [65], which is a methodology that has been shown 
to be robust for discovering nonlinear interactions as shown by Schelter 
et  al.  [66,67]. Moreover, Gates et  al. [64] developed a group-connectivity 
­estimation strategy based on these lagged and instantaneous causal ­models 
and applied it to the simulated data created by Smith et  al. [62] with an 
­excellent ­recovering rate for simulated connections.
A final idea in this open discussion is the lack of theoretical convergence of 
previous approaches, which is a dissonant feature compared to the unified 
DCM analysis of brain connectivity. However, the papers reviewed in the 
previous paragraph display a possibly common direction to follow, though it 
is still not clear whether these methods effectively link the underlying neu-
ral activity with the accompanying hemodynamic response. Constraints of 
space and time do not allow us to continue tackling these rich discussions; 
however, see Refs. [60,68,69] for future avenues for investigation.
9.2.6  Neural-Mass-Based Generative Models
A more realistic mechanism for generating neuronal signals is provided by 
neural mass models (NMMs). They are based on simplified analyses of the 
cerebral cortical column that includes basically three neuronal ­populations 
widely regarded as pyramidal cells, inhibitory interneurons, and excitatory 
stellate cells. These models allow a realistic and simultaneous generation 
of M-EEG and fMRI signals, as elegantly demonstrated by Babajani and 
Soltanian-Zadeh ([15]; Equations 5 and 12), who used the synthetic postsynap-
tic activity in ­pyramidal cells and the sum of the absolute values for all synap-
tic processes, respectively (see also Refs. [22,70]). Figure 9.2 shows a diagram

NMMs have currently several advantages and limitations. First, they are 
a realistic way to generate both M-EEG and fMRI signals with neurophysi-
ological realism [72–75]. Currently, these models represent the most realistic 
and flexible approach for generating brain signals, which put them in a privi-
leged position for analyzing fused M-EEG and fMRI signals. However, these 
models are difficult to estimate in real scenarios owing to mainly two facts: 
(1) only postsynaptic potentials at pyramidal cells are directly linked to elec-
troencephalographic recordings and (2) the relationship with the BOLD sig-
nal is sluggish and unspecific. We believe that these problems have limited 
the role of NMMs for M-EEG and fMRI fusion applications with the benefit 
of closer relatives and practical DCM approaches.
9.3  Significance of Fusion in Various Modalities
The M-EEG techniques have been crucially used in the past for studying cog-
nitive impairments and brain pathologies, either by using ERP studies, or by 
exploring single trials directly and detecting the transient changes that occur 
in the signal such as the spikes or discharges occurring for epileptic patients. 
The accurate estimation of the affected regions is also important, for example, 
for making surgical decisions in intractable epilepsies. This cannot be done sim-
ply by using M-EEG analysis, whereas the combination with fMRI-based crite-
ria can produce the desired results. In the future, localization criteria will also 
be necessary for the treatment of other brain pathologies when the estimation 
of a target region is required for releasing a nano-drug medicine in the brain.
Currently, electrical and hemodynamic/metabolic changes can be traced 
with simultaneous recordings of EEG and fMRI activities. This widens the 
opportunities for studying the spatiotemporal patterns of brain signals [3]. 
Now, the fusion of EEG and fMRI is commonly used for epileptic analy-
ses [76–78], where, additionally, the findings are usually corroborated using 
intracortical recordings. A good surgical outcome depends on the accurate 
localization of the epileptic foci and also on the location of the affected 
region; for example, the treatment of extratemporal lobe epilepsies is still 
challenging  [79]. However,  fusion methods are progressing rapidly, and 
 

207
Perspectives of M-EEG and fMRI Data Fusion
we believe that remaining challenges will be overcome in the forthcom-
ing years. Next, we limit the discussion to interesting applications of the 
fusion methodology (for additional information, we refer to some special-
ized reviews [30,77,80]).
Some studies have evaluated the concordance between M-EEG inverse solu-
tions and fusion EEG-fMRI in focal epilepsy by analyzing data acquired in 
different sessions, based mainly on comparisons of fMRI activation ­versus 
sources estimated from M-EEG inverse problems [81–85]. For example, 
Daunizeau  et  al.  [17] analyzed interictal epileptiform discharge (IED) data 
within a Bayesian framework approach. In their study, two EEG sections were 
acquired: the first was conjoint with the fMRI, and the second was for mea-
surement of a prolonged EEG. Spikes in both EEGs were selected by an expert 
and served in the conjoint study for use as stimulus onsets in standard ROI 
analysis for detecting the corresponding activations. In the prolonged EEG, 
the selected spikes were averaged to create an ERP scalp map that was used 
simultaneously with the fMRI locations for solving the optimization proce-
dure. With this method, they found four significant active regions that were 
­confirmed later with electrocorticography (ECoG) recordings. However, 
the intracortical recordings also revealed epileptic activities in regions not 
detected by the method. All the estimated regions show a negative BOLD 
response with peak around 4–6 s, widely regarded as fMRI deactivations. The 
relations between IEDs and negative BOLD signals still remain unclear but are 
considered the result of deactivation both in the EEG and BOLD signals [86,87].
As another example, Vulliemoz et  al. [88] evaluated nine patients with 
refractory focal epilepsy as part of a surgical procedure. The resting eyes-
closed state was recorded in two sections, outside and inside the scanner, 
first for EEG only and then for conjoint EEG and fMRI analysis. They pro-
ceed to locate the fMRI activation similarly to the Daunizeau et al. study [17], 
and then solve the inverse problem for the EEG corresponding to the con-
joint analysis with possible sources limited to gray matter [89]. They reported 
a good concordance between BOLD and EEG-based activations, and both 
were also in agreement with intracortical recordings.
In another perspective, Correa et al. [38] used mCCA for analysis of fMRI 
and EEG, and fMRI and structural MRI (sMRI) data separately for patients 
diagnosed with schizophrenia and a healthy group. For the first study, the 
data were collected conjointly for an auditory oddball experiment ­revealing 
associations of the temporal and motor areas with the N2 and P3 peaks. 
In  particular, the P3 wave for the schizophrenia group was found to be 
abnormal when compared to the control group. For the second study, the 
data were collected for an auditory sensorimotor task, and the analysis 
showed a curious relationship between fMRI activations and gray matter 
densities. Compared to the control group, the schizophrenia group showed 
more activation in the motor areas and less in the temporal areas as well as 
less gray matter densities in both regions. Their results were consistent with 
standard findings for this pathology [90–94].

9.4  Practical and Realistic M-EEG/fMRI Data Integration
This last section is a little technical but is presented to show ongoing research 
that may allow the estimation of a brain dynamical system with a large 
number of interacting elements. We also present a convenient model for 
simulating “realistic” brain activity and methods that allow computational 
tractability. Next, we consider the DCM model but disregard the bilinear 
part, which we will call dynamic ARX (dARX) models. That is,

The following theorem and discussion show how to generate simulations 
based on this model by assuming that the input acts like a train of Dirac’s 
delta.
Theorem: Let ϕ(t) be any fundamental solution of x = Ax; x(tk) = xk. Then the 
solution of x = Ax + cu; x(tk) = xk, where u(t) is a continuous scalar function, 
is unique, and is given by

The proof of this theorem can be found in Coddington and Levinson’s 
book [95]. Here, we are interested in the case where u(t) represents Dirac delta 
impulses. Therefore, it is not continuous but measurable, and the theory also 
applies [95]. This can also be shown by using limit theory if we represent the 
impulse by a Gaussian distribution with infinitesimal variance.
Informally, we show that this numerical integration has an explicit form. 
For example, we can use an integration step small enough so that u(t) only 
has a single impulse in each integration interval. Suppose now that the 
impulse occurs at t0, then the previous expression is integrated as follows:

In general, if we set mk > 1 as the number of impulses in the semi-interval 
(tk, t) and represent u(t) as a sum of single impulse functions with the impulse 
onset occurring at tk ≤ τj < t, j = 1, 2, …, mk, then the previous integration 
­formula can be represented more generally as

The latter expression helps us to simulate and estimate dynamic ARX 
(dARX) models for Dirac delta impulses as input.
We introduce now two situations for generating the simulations: (1) the 
stochastic case, where we consider that noise has an effect over the signals 
only in discretely equal-spaced points and (2) a more realistic situation 
where, additionally, measurement noise is added after the entire integration 
process. The noise perturbation limited to discrete points can be justified 
using the stochastic theory for continuous Wiener process while stating the 
integration step for the corresponding discrete time points.
For the simulations that follow, we consider the connectivity matrix

In Figure 9.3, we present a single simulation for each of the noisy scenar-
ios using the previous values, which guarantees that the system will gener-
ate oscillations. In the simulations, we create 50 spikes with random onsets 
as exogenous input that affects the elements’ dynamics with vector influences 
c = (3, 0, 0, 0)T. The stochastic noise is inserted in a similar way, but onsets 
are equally spaced in the time window, and the value is generated with a 
Gaussian distribution with a standard deviation of 0.1. At the end of the inte-
gration process, the time series are contaminated with measurement noise, 
also determined by a Gaussian distribution, but with the standard deviation 
equal to 0.1 times the maximum magnitude of the original time series.
For estimating the parameters for the dARX model, we propose essentially 
two variants. The first employs a standard cost function based directly on 
the integration formula (9.7) and is written as

Perspectives of M-EEG and fMRI Data Fusion
In Figure  9.4, we presented the estimated coefficients versus the true 
­coefficients for 20 repetitions of each noise scenario. While the best fit of 
all is achieved when we optimize using the first cost function for the “only 
stochastic noise” scenario, using this cost function fails almost completely 
when we considered the noisier scenario. On the contrary, the use of the 
second cost function allows stable estimators for each case. Computationally, 
the estimation procedure only takes a few seconds and, besides, we did not 
exclude the zero connections as is usually done in DCM approaches, which 
can be seen in the graphs of Figure 9.4. This makes us ­optimistic with respect 
to solving high-dimensional dynamical systems.
We do not present here the link with the hemodynamic response because 
this is currently an ongoing study; however, we are ensuing similarly 
to DCM models, using the balloon and hemodynamic equations  [96,97].

We  conjecture that sooner than later it should be possible to ­estimate 
high-dimensional synthetic frameworks such as those proposed by Bojak 
et  al. [98] and ­Valdes-Sosa et  al. [22], with subsequent application to real 
­multimodal data analysis for directing to cognitive and clinical applications.
9.5  Conclusions
From the words of Nikos Logothetis [3]—“Research shows that the subcorti-
cal input to cortex is weak; the feedback is massive, the local connectivity 
reveals strong excitatory and inhibitory recurrence, and the output reflects 
changes in the balance between excitation and inhibition, rather than simple 
feedforward integration of subcortical inputs”—it may be thought that we 
are very far from modeling the richness of brain dynamics (maybe we are 
not able to achieve this with the current techniques and must wait for nano-
technology), but in the last 10 years important progress has been made in 
multimodal fusion methods.
The optimism expressed in the last part of this chapter is based on the 
possibility of characterizing the spatiotemporal functions and interactions of 
the brain modules that lead to the execution of the principal cognitive task, 
and understand why they are disrupted by the severity of particular dis-
eases that affect the human brain. Within the intricate world of hyperactive 
interactions, we can say that fMRI is a measure of “something that is hap-
pening in some place,” with good spatial accuracy. A similar observation is 
valid for the local field potential that can potentially be obtained by solving 
the M-EEG inverse problems or directly measured by the ECoG technique, 
though with the use of the M-EEG/ECoG technique this “something” can 
be quantified in real time, but possibly spatially displaced as in the case of 
EEG/MEG-based inverse solutions. Thus, as widely interpreted, M-EEG and 
ECoG allow meaning/content to be added to the findings made by applying 
fMRI, which may help to disclose the patterns of temporal dynamic and con-
nectivity among the neuronal populations. Undeniably, neither ECoG nor 
EEG/MEG produces massive measures with the spatial accuracy that fMRI 
can provide. Therefore, a fusion of analyses and methodologies is necessary 
to make further discoveries.
A final conclusion is that the best current alternative in our hands is to 
­continue developing fusion models owing to their advantages of enhanced 
characterizations of the brain functions and their interweaving of integra-
tion/divergence patterns. A nonevident but encouraging conclusion is that 
soon we will be able to estimate parameters for ­dynamical-systems-based 
inverse problems, and this will pave the way for modeling the brain in more 
realistic ways and thus understanding its behavior and learning capacities.

10.1  Introduction
Our knowledge is a collection of our experiences, which expands daily as we 
experience new things. The way we imbue our surroundings and ourselves 
with meaning depends on the knowledge and understanding we have, and 
this knowledge depends on our memorization of what we have  learned.

EEG/ERP Analysis
In daily life, we take in new information and store it in our brain, ­maintaining 
it and recalling it depending on our needs. This happens because our brain 
has the capability of learning new skills and experiences, storing what has 
been learned and reusing the stored knowledge. These capabilities of ­storing 
and reusing experiences and skills are informally known as the human 
memory system. Everything we do or think depends on our memory, which 
is active every moment, receiving new information from our senses, updat-
ing existing knowledge using focus and attention, retrieving the stored expe-
riences and skills, and planning for future ­activities that have not occurred 
yet. Thus far, neuroscientists have been expecting to find specific stores of 
memory in the brain and discover their exact location to know which type 
of memory lies where. Unfortunately, because of the great complexity of 
the human brain system (Figure 10.1 [1]), this concept has not been proved. 
However, some cognitive and mental functions are found in certain brain 
areas.
Generally, there are two different memory types—short-term and long-
term memory—that store and access information differently, and many brain 
regions are involved in the process. Short-term memory retains information 
for a few seconds, and its capacity ranges from seven to nine items for a nor-
mal person. It tends to weaken as the individual’s age increases. Long-term 
memory retains unlimited information for an infinite duration. The infor-
mation could be personal events, temporal and spatial relations among these 
events, and real-world entities and their meaning such as symbols, words, 
and concepts. There are three fundamental memory processes: encoding, 
retention, and recall. Encoding allows converting the perceived information

Memory Retention and Recall Process
of interest into a construct that can be retained in the brain. It is the first stage 
of creating a new memory in the brain. Retention is the storage of encoded 
information in the brain. Retrieval or recall is the re-accessing of retained 
events or information in the brain. A part of encoding or retention is mem-
ory consolidation, which stabilizes a memory trace after its initial formation. 
Neurologically, the consolidation process employs long-term potentiation; it 
strengthens the synapses by increasing the number of signals that are sent 
and received between the two neurons.
Scientists utilized different neuroimaging techniques to view these pro-
cesses such as electroencephalography (EEG), functional magnetic reso-
nance imaging (fMRI), magneto-encephalography (MEG), positron emission 
tomography (PET), etc. This chapter will focus on recent studies utilizing 
EEG for the two important memory processes: (1) retention and (2) recall, by 
focusing on their neurophysiological understanding and studying the factors 
that affect the retention and recall performance. The following sections will 
describe the traditional cognitive and memory theories of memory processes, 
the brain regions associated with memory functions, the neural understand-
ing of retention and recall, applications and, finally, the conclusions.
10.2  Overview of Traditional Approaches
10.2.1  Atkinson and Shiffrin Memory Model (1968)
Richard Atkinson and Richard Shiffrin proposed a multi-store human mem-
ory model (see Figure 10.2 [2]) that divided the human memory into three 
distinct stores: sensory memory, short-term memory (STM), and long-term 
memory (LTM). This model has many limitations and has attracted much

criticism such as an ill-defined concept of the rehearsal buffer, presence of a 
single short-term store, and incorrect prediction of total recall probability in 
free recall [3]. However, it is still useful for researchers, who can propose new 
models based on this model.
10.2.2  Dual Coding Theory of Memory (1971)
Allan Paivio [4] developed dual coding theory in 1971. According to this ­theory, 
“human cognition is unique in that it has become specialized for ­dealing 
simultaneously with language and with nonverbal objects and events.” This 
theory categorizes the process of intelligence and memory into two separate 
subsystems: verbal and nonverbal (imagery) systems. The verbal system is 
specialized for handling the language directly, while the imagery system is 
specialized for ­handling visual objects and events.
Although this theory was strongly criticized conceptually and was 
­experimentally refuted, it initiated research on verbal and visual effects 
on memory.
10.2.3  Baddeley’s Model of Working Memory (1974)
Alan Baddeley and G. Hitch proposed a working memory model to describe 
more accurately the concept and model of the short-term system in Atkinson 
and Shiffrin’s memory model. This model consists of three main parts: (1) the 
central executive, (2) the phonological loop, and (3) the visuospatial sketchpad. 
It proposes the concept of two independent short-term memory storage sub-
systems: the phonological loop, for ­verbal ­information storage, and the visuo-
spatial scratchpad, for visuospatial information ­storage (see Figure 10.3 [5]). 
The central executive controls both the ­subsystems and deals with cognitive 
tasks such as problem solving and mental arithmetic.
Baddeley and Hitch’s original working memory model also attracted much 
criticism, which led to the exploration of the episodic buffer [6] in the original

Memory Retention and Recall Process
WM model. However, this model is very critical to understand how the 
human mind manipulates and retains information during problem solving, 
reasoning, and thinking. Davidson et al. investigated cognitive control and 
executive functions for memory manipulation and inhibition in the visual 
switching task. They stated that “the mind has the ability to recollect plan 
and other things related to the present, future, and past” [7]. The ­episodic 
buffer organizes the arrangement of verbal sentences with the help of the 
phonological loop into a coherent sequence along with memory. For ­example, 
when people are involved in mutual dialogue, their brain responds by keep-
ing track of what has been said, and their assumptions about what different 
speakers intended by their explanations.
10.2.4  Cognitive Load Theory (1988)
This theory took shape from the idea of working memory’s limited capacity 
and its operations. John Sweller developed cognitive load theory [8,9] when 
studying problem-solving strategies. This theory is concerned with the way 
cognitive resources are focused and utilized while learning and ­solving 
problems. It encouraged learners to utilize working memory efficiently 
while solving difficult tasks. It has implications in the designing of learning 
material to reduce cognitive load such as multimedia content for learning.
10.2.5  Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning (1999)
Richard E. Mayer [10] proposed modality principles stating that when verbal 
and imagery content are presented together to a learner, they are processed 
along two distinct channels (see Figure 10.4). These principles are known as 
the cognitive theory of multimedia learning.
This theory combines several other concepts such as dual code theory, work-
ing memory limitation, connections between text-based and image-based

­memory while performing any task. Table 10.1 presents a summary of these 
theories with their strengths and weaknesses.
10.3  Understanding Memory Retention and Recall
Human memory processes can be classified as the ability of the mind to 
understand, retain, and successfully recall information. The role of retention 
is to store encoded events and information, and the role of recall is to re-access 
the retained events and information in the mind in response to external 
stimuli. Although memory is achieved in multiple phases, recall is the only

Memory Retention and Recall Process
way to measure memory performance. How much information is encoded? 
How much information is retained? How much information is retrieved? 
What is the memory performance? All these questions can be answered in 
the memory recall phase by asking someone ­questions and recording their 
recall responses. The correct responses will ­indicate the memory performance, 
retained information, or amount of encoded information.
Memory is closely related to the learning process, which is concerned 
with acquiring skills or knowledge. Memory is also the representation of 
­learning that has been acquired. Various brain parts are involved in learn-
ing and the memory formation process, and different mental and physical 
­factors are reported that influence memory retention and recall performance. 
These brain areas and the factors that affect retention and recall performance 
are discussed in the subsequent sections.
10.3.1  Brain Areas Associated with Memory Functions
Many areas of the brain are associated with memory and memory pro-
cesses, including the cerebral cortex of the frontal, parietal, and temporal 
lobes; the hippocampus; the amygdala; and the diencephalon (Figure 10.5).
Loss of the hippocampus leads to an inability to encode short-term mem-
ory to long-term memory. The causes of memory loss may be trauma, injury, 
stroke, disease, drugs, etc.
10.3.1.1  Cerebral Cortex
The outer covering of gray matter on the hemispheres is the cerebral ­cortex. It is a 
thin layer of tissue and covers the outer portion of cerebrum up to 5 mm. It con-
sists of 19% of all the brain cells (approximately 86.1 (±8.1) billion neurons) [12],

which are organized into a complex neural network of ­synaptic ­connections 
and develops the distributed connections among the specialized brain ­system. 
It is divided into four lobes: the frontal, central, parietal, ­temporal, and occipital 
lobes, which are responsible for specific functions such as ­thinking, ­reasoning, 
decision making, perception, movement, touch, smell, vision, ­listening, 
­attention, memory, and emotion. Some cortical regions are specialized for 
­certain functions, and some cortices are associated with more complex func-
tions, including working memory, emotion, ­attention, judgment, etc. The main 
functions of the frontal lobe include problem solving, reasoning, ­planning, 
memory, and decision making. It is experimentally proved that this lobe is 
primarily responsible for dealing with working memory and information 
­processing in connection with other task-specific brain regions [11].
The parietal lobe is responsible for spatial orientation, pain and touch 
sensation, and cognitive functions. The posterior parietal cortex has been 
associated with memory retrieval, especially in episodic memory: personal 
experiences occurring at a certain time and place [13]. Several fMRI studies 
have investigated the intra-parietal sulci in memory encoding and retrieval, 
and their results reflected parietal activation in the memorization process 
and engagement of the brain attentional network [14]. Temporal lobes are 
involved in auditory, emotional, speech, language, learning, and memory 
related functions. High gamma activity in the left temporal cortical region 
has discriminated true from false memory responses [15] in memory 
retrieval tasks. The primary visual cortex in the occipital lobe is responsible 
for processing visual information received from the eyes through the thala-
mus. The entire cerebral cortex is linked directly or indirectly in memory 
processes: encoding, retention, and retrieval.
10.3.1.2  Hippocampus
The hippocampus is a part of the limbic system, which lies inside each tem-
poral lobe. It is located along the upper edge of the parahippocampal gyrus. 
It interlocks with the dentate gyrus and forms the hippocampal–dentate 
complex. It is responsible for spatial navigation, particularly the encoding of 
new information from short-term to long-term memory, and the retrieval of 
long-term memories. Karlsgodt et al., [16] showed an fMRI study that used a 
verbal working memory test. In encoding, maintenance, and recall, a within-
subject comparison of functional activation suggested that the ­hippocampus 
had a role in working memory similar to its role in long-term memory, 
implying that the hippocampus might be involved in overall encoding and 
recalling rather than just in long-term memory tasks.
10.3.1.3  Amygdala
The amygdala is an almond-shaped nuclei located in the deep anterior infe-
rior medial temporal lobe near the hippocampus and holds 13 nuclei, each 
of which has other subsystems. It is associated with many functions in the 
 

227
Memory Retention and Recall Process
brain, such as fear and anxiety, emotional and social impact of the environ-
ment, support for memory storage across multiple brain regions, and regula-
tion of automatic responses. It consists of three classes of nuclei: baso-lateral, 
superficial, and centromedial. This classification is not consistent with all 
amygdala-anatomy-related studies. The input signals to the amygdala from 
the cortex, thalamus, hypothalamus, and brain stem include olfactory, 
somatosensory, gustatory, auditory, and visual information.
The amygdala itself is not a storage place for memory, but influ-
ences the consolidation and acquiring of memories in various learning 
­situations in the  brain, such as interactions with the hippocampus in 
emotional ­memory [17], involvement in memory storage in other brain 
systems [18], drug ­addiction memory [19], reward expectancy [20], and 
spatial learning  [21]. Several other studies have reported that emotional 
arousal ­stimulates the amygdala and has modulatory effects on memory; 
for ­example, ­neuroimaging studies investigated the positive ­association 
between  ­emotional memory retention and the amygdala activation 
­during learning [22]. These ­studies clarify the role of the amygdala in 
­memory ­consolidation (Figure 10.6) via projections to other brain memory 
­system [23], especially in emotional memory.
10.3.2  Long-Term Potentiation and Memory Retention
In neuroscience research, it is a significant challenge to find the ­cellular and 
molecular processes involved in the process of learning and ­creating new 
memories. New information is acquired through the ­learning ­process, and

EEG/ERP Analysis
memory is the route by which the acquired information is stored. Memory 
formation is dependent on neuronal changes at the ­synaptic level that allow 
strengthening of connections between ­neurons in the brain [24]. It is believed 
that task-dependent synaptic ­plasticity at the ­corresponding ­synapses dur-
ing the formation of new ­memory is crucial and is ­sufficient to store infor-
mation. This ­phenomenon of ­activity-dependent ­enhancement of synaptic 
transmission, which ­facilitates long-term ­information in the brain, is known 
as long-term ­potentiation (LTP). For further reading about the properties 
and detailed mechanism of LTP, see Ref. [25].
10.3.3  Factors Affecting Memory Retention and Recall
Cognitive research studies [26–28] have emphasized that retention and recall 
processes are related to one another and also are connected with other con-
cepts such as learning, testing, capacity limit of memory, ­attention demand, 
and complexity of material. However, there are many other factors that affect 
retention and recall performance, such as ­attention, rehearsal, sleep, testing, 
mnemonics, exercise and nutrition, and reward. The conventional concept 
of learning and retrieval is that ­learning takes place during studying, while 
retrieval helps to assess the learned content.
10.3.3.1  Attention
As human memory has a limited capacity, it is crucial to determine the infor-
mation of interest to be encoded and subsequently retained. Attention helps 
the brain to encode items selectively into memory. Recent studies have estab-
lished a link between attention and memory processes. In an experiment, 
it was established that attention-directing cues can influence the collection 
of objects from visual memory [29]. Another study concluded that attention 
and memory cannot work separately [30], but it improves memory perfor-
mance. Dividing attention may reduce the strength of retention. A recent 
study investigated long-term memory retention with full and divided atten-
tion. They found superior results with full attention as compared to divided 
attention during the memory recognition task [31]. A similar study examined 
the relationship between attention and memory processes and reported a 
strong association between attention and retention in working memory [32]. 
These studies established a strong association between attention and mem-
ory retention and the recall process.
10.3.3.2  Rehearsal
Rehearsal is the repeated reception, verbally or visually, of the same content, 
events, or information. According to the phonological loop model [33], ver-
bal information is maintained in the phonological loop, but declines after a 
moment unless rehearsed. However, some studies have reported that rehearsal 
 

229
Memory Retention and Recall Process
does not improve in the word length in a serial recognition ­memory task [34]. 
It can be concluded that rehearsal may not improve ­memory recall in each task.
10.3.3.3  Sleep
The association between sleep and memory has been studied for the last 
few decades, but it is now well established that sleep plays an important 
role in the memory consolidation process [35], which is a part of retention or 
the encoding process. There is electrophysiological and behavioral evidence 
to prove that sleep helps memory consolidation and brain plasticity. Frank 
and Benington [36] reviewed the role of sleep in memory consolidation and 
found that sleep promotes plastic changes in the brain. They divided the 
link between sleep and memory into three categories: sleep deprivation and 
memory consolidation, their correlation, and its effect on learning. Recently, 
Bell et al. [37] investigated the impact of sleep and spacing gap on long-term 
memory. Their results support the positive effects of sleep on long-term 
memory retention.
10.3.3.4  Exercise and Nutrition
Studies have reported the benefits of exercise in individuals whose cogni-
tive performance is lowest [38]. The results showed that exercise improves 
memory performance in those individuals whose cognitive score in working 
memory was the lowest (see Figure 10.7).

EEG/ERP Analysis
The effects of nutrition and exercise on verbal memory were studied for 
type 2 diabetic old age participants, and positive results were reported. 
This study showed that exercise and nutrition may help memory for old 
adults at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes [39]. The reason for this 
­finding may be that diet and exercise affect neurotropic elements and ­synaptic 
plasticity in the brain’s regions, which are directly related to memory.
10.3.3.5  Mnemonics
Mnemonics is a mental technique that helps the brain remember ­information 
easily by associating the memories with some other ­keywords such as 
­letters, images, or numbers. Several mnemonic techniques are ­available that 
help remember various pieces of information easily, ­including ­acronyms, 
acrostics, method of loci, chunking, rhymes and songs, stories, etc. [40].
10.3.3.6  Testing Effect
In educational systems, the theory of studying and testing is followed. 
Learning occurs during lectures, reading, and study groups. Tests have 
been designed to judge what has been absorbed or learned by studying. 
These tests are considered assessments or evaluations of learned knowledge. 
Researchers studied learning by trials of study (S) and a test (T). The critical 
supposition is that learning occurs through study phases, while a test simply 
measures what was learned in previous study phases (of STSTST … order). 
Recently, a study of reviewed evidence opposes this conventional percep-
tion: retrieval exercises during tests have often resulted in better learning 
and long-term retention than has studying [41].
In related studies, Roediger and colleagues [27,41,42] investigated the link 
between retention and learning with repeated testing, and they proposed 
that the repeated recalling of retained information led to better learning 
and long-term retention. In one experiment, participants were given a list 
of items to study under two different conditions. In one condition, the list 
was studied 15 times and tested 5 times, while in the other condition the 
list was studied 5 times and tested 15 times. A retrieval task after one week 
showed better learning and retention results in the repeated test condition as 
compared to the repeated study (see Figure 10.8).
In another study, they investigated the retention performance between 
repeated retrieval and single retrieval conditions. The results showed a very 
high improvement in the repeated retrieval condition as compared to the 
single retrieval condition (see Figure 10.9).
These studies explained that testing/retrieval is a powerful technique 
of enhancing memory retention and recall performance. The implications 
of these are that students should test themselves repeatedly instead of 
­studying the content frequently. However, feedback should be included in 
the frequent testing technique to avoid errors.

10.3.3.7  Reward
Researchers investigated the process of reward and punishment stimuli 
and the neural understanding of reward processing in the brain. A recent 
study [43] reported that training under reward conditions results in substan-
tial long-term retention, whereas training under neutral conditions showed a 
significant decline in memory gain. The research found reward-based train-
ing and learning more effective than neutral or punished conditions.
The effectiveness of all these techniques for memory retention and recall 
processes is experimentally proved. However, one technique may not give 
good results in all situations. Table 10.2 summarizes the factors that influ-
ence memory retention and recall performance with the underlying reasons.
TABLE 10.2
Summary of Factors Affecting Memory Retention and Recall
Factor
Affects
Reasons
Attention [30]
Full attention enhances 
memory recall and longer 
retention. Partial attention 
results in reduced recall 
performance. 
When attention is divided, the limited capacity 
of working memory cannot accommodate the 
desired information and the result is partial 
memory consolidation, which ultimately 
reduces recall performance. 
Rehearsal [44]
Frequent rehearsal improves 
recall performance. 
Frequent rehearsal strengthens the synaptic 
connections among the neurons involved in a 
certain task, and stronger synaptic 
connections support better subsequent 
information recollection. 
Sleep [45]
Sleep promotes brain plasticity 
and memory consolidation.
It remains to be determined how sleep 
produces neuronal changes that affect the 
consolidation process. 
Exercise [38] and 
nutrition [39]
Exercise and nutrition offer 
benefits for mental health and 
affect neurotransmitters. 
Nutrition and regular exercise influence 
neurotrophic elements and plasticity in brain 
regions related to memory performance. 
Further, for the elderly, regular exercise and 
balanced nutrition prevent the brain from 
shrinking and maintain memory. 
Mnemonics [40]
Mnemonics helps encode 
difficult-to-remember 
information in such a way 
that it becomes much easier 
to recall correctly. 
It strengthens network interactions and makes 
it easy to retain and retrieve difficult 
information. 
Testing effect [41]
Testing allows recalling stored 
information from memory. 
It also minimizes the errors 
in the recall result and helps 
to retain correct information. 
Repeated testing allows the same neurons 
involved initially in learning to fire repeatedly. 
The neuronal networks become more stable 
and synchronized, and recollection of stored 
information becomes easy. 
Reward [43]
Reward-based training or 
learning leads to better results 
than nonreward learning or 
punishment situation. 
Rewards may attract more attention during a 
certain task and maintain neuronal 
connections, which result in stable memory 
performance.

Memory Retention and Recall Process
10.4  Experimental Design Issues
Various practical, theoretical, and ethical issues have been cited in the literature 
about memory research. Recently, common design issues of neurocognitive 
research have been highlighted [46,47]. Here, we summarize all the possible 
memory experimental design issues which are normally not given explicit 
importance, but are sensitive to the results of the experimental investigations.
Aim: When designing a memory experiment, the aim of the experimenter 
should be well defined. If the investigator is going to study the cognitive 
load, retention time, reaction time, recall performance, modality effect, short-
term memory, long-term memory, recognition memory, and verbal or visual 
memory, the experiment must reflect the aim.
Task Simplicity: Although complex tasks have been used to examine cog-
nitive load and brain processing speed, extreme complications in shorter 
time interval tasks may confuse the subject. It is better to avoid complexity 
from the experimental task and specify it as per memory type, subject health 
and age, and the nature of the memory.
Memory type: Researchers discriminate between memory types: short-
term memory or working memory and long-term memory, on the basis of 
their capacity, retention length, and processing power. In memory experi-
mental design, memory types are as essential as other experimental param-
eter specifications.
Memory modality: Visual and auditory are the two main memory modali-
ties. The brain separately processes the information received from visual 
and auditory sources, and the capacities differ between visual memory and 
auditory memory. In designing an experiment, it should be considered that 
the experimental task with both modalities may have high cognitive load 
compared to the task with a single modality.
Specific Brain: Brain diseases such as Alzheimer’s, brain tumor, ­depression, 
and Parkinson’s affect different brain regions. Researchers have considered 
unusual tasks that focus on the affected brain part. If subjects are suffering 
from any brain disorder, the experimental task should be revised in consul-
tation with area experts to handle the target subjects.
Subjects’ characteristics: Individuals or volunteers who participate in the 
experiment are collectively called the sample. The individualities of a sample 
may be normal or patients, old or young, adolescent or children, and male or 
female. These individual differences need to be considered in task design to 
start the memory investigation.
Brain mapping method: Various brain-mapping methods are available 
such as EEG (invasive/non-invasive), fMRI, MEG, and PET. Each method has 
its own strengths and weaknesses. However, the choice of method depends 
on equipment availability, and the experimental design should be flexible 
to coordinate and overcome the limitation of the selected brain mapping 
method.
 

234
EEG/ERP Analysis
Predefined memory paradigm: Several predefined memory paradigms 
are available [47]. In order to use the existing available paradigm, one 
must be able to identify the memory paradigm that best reflects a subject’s 
responses.
Experiment duration: The duration of the experimental task tends to 
vary depending on the study objectives. However, patients may feel anxi-
ety while taking part in a prolonged experiment. This affects the patients’ 
attention and interest in the experiment and eventually disturbs the desired 
consequences. The experimental task duration can be specified according to 
patients’ health, the research aim, and the selected modality.
Consent: In memory research, the subject’s consent is an important issue. 
The research study and designed task should meet the regional, legal, and 
ethical laws and should protect patients’ well-being, mental privacy, and 
self-incrimination.
10.5  Summary
In this chapter, we have presented an overview of traditional theories of 
memory types and memory processes. We have focused on two important 
memory processes: retention and recall. The traditional theories explored 
short-term and long-term memory storage, working memory phenomena, 
verbal and nonverbal information processing, efficient use of cognitive 
capacity, and brain dual channels information processing of visual and ver-
bal data. All these theories have their own distinctions. However, they are 
linked with each other and have important contribution in today’s memory 
research.
Brain regions, especially the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala 
have been strongly linked with memory processes. The cerebral cortex in 
the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes contributes to working memory, 
episodic memory, and correct memory retrieval, respectively. In the medial 
temporal lobe, the hippocampus is the region for memory encoding and for-
mation of new memory or transfer of information from short-term to long-
term storage. The amygdala is the hub of emotional memory representation: 
fear, sadness, happiness, and other emotion-related events are associated 
with amygdala activation.
The process of long-term potentiation has a significant role in learning and 
new memory formation; the strong and weak memory depends on the syn-
aptic communication network strength. Strong synaptic links have a high 
probability of storing new information and correct recall.
Various factors have been investigated, which have contributed to retain-
ing more information and recall after a longer time. Many of them (such as

their crucial role in utilizing the limited working memory capacity and learn 
more information, and transfer to long-term storage. Not all of these factors 
may be in support of high retention or recall. However, each of them has its 
own contribution in certain scenario.
In the end, various issues regarding memory experimental design were 
­summarized. As a whole, these issues may be useful to consider in ­designing a 
memory experiment, especially for new researchers in memory research.

EEG/ERP Analysis
11.1  Introduction
Neurofeedback is a form of brain wave training that makes use of the 
­principle of learning, defined as the general process by which an organism 
alters its behavior according to certain goals. By measuring and providing 
feedback related to brain wave activity, the ­process of neurofeedback pro-
vides an additional channel of ­information that increases awareness of brain 
behavior by creating subjective experiences that are derived from electroen-
cephalography (EEG).
Neurofeedback has been commonly referred to as training rather than treat-
ment owing to similarities to physical fitness training, including nonspecific 
intervention stratagems applied to specific disorders and the need for mul-
tiple repetitions to produce positive results. Clinicians may apply a variety 
of interventions that produce symptom remission for the same ­disorder. EEG 
biofeedback has proved useful with an array of psychological and medical 
conditions. A diversity of protocols has been used to achieve this result. It can 
be argued that neurofeedback does not treat anything specific, but rather EEG 
biofeedback optimizes the central nervous system thereby improving gen-
eral function in a variety of cognitive, emotional, and homeostatic domains. 
It accomplishes this task by conditioning brain electrical activity through 
repetitive application and so is more aptly referred to as training.
Despite its birth in the halls of academia, neurofeedback as a discipline 
largely developed outside of the academy as a tool in clinical practice. Many 
of the early adopters of this intervention were not traditional mental health 
or medical practitioners. Some became developers and vendors of equip-
ment  and software as a bulwark against the lack of a wider community.

Neurofeedback
In this way, vendors often became leaders in the field. In many instances, 
these individuals filled traditional roles as therapists, teachers, and leaders 
of ­professional organizations inhabited by clinicians, academicians, and sci-
entists in other health-related disciplines.
This early history contributed to the synergy between developers and 
­clinicians, allowing for the rapid development of clinical tools. Where there 
has been interaction between clinical requirements and a manufacturer’s 
capacity, rapid advancement has been the result. This environment has his-
torically contributed to the field being less focused on scientific proof and 
more on clinical demands and market forces, adding to the field’s vulner-
ability to criticism by traditional medicine and science.
With the production of more methodologically sound research, the field of 
neurofeedback is on the precipice of a much broader acceptance. The tumultu-
ous birth of the field is inevitably giving way to the order imposed by profes-
sional standards, the demands of the growing influence of mainstream science, 
and the desire for a wider service delivery. Neurofeedback is now commonly 
performed by healthcare professionals worldwide. Professional guilds for 
neurofeedback and biofeedback have firmly taken root and a nascent quan-
titative electroencephalogram (qEEG) guild is developing. EEG biofeedback is 
increasingly being implemented in university programs, especially in Europe.
This chapter is intended as a general survey of neurofeedback. It will give 
a short history of the field and offer an introductory ­description of the exist-
ing clinical modalities that developed as a result. It will describe basic clinical 
processes and neurofeedback interventions, including biological, technical, 
and scientific considerations. This chapter is not intended to be exhaustive, 
and some areas of neurofeedback will not be included. Rather, this chapter 
was written to help the reader understand neurofeeback in a general way 
and provide a starting place for deeper investigation.
11.2  Early History of the Field
11.2.1  Joe Kamiya and Alpha Training
The roots of modern neurofeedback began with the work of Joe Kamiya at the 
University of Chicago in about 1962. Kamiya discovered that human subjects 
could be taught to consciously control alpha burst activities. Initially, this 
was done through verbal prompts each time an alpha burst spontaneously 
appeared. Later, Kamiya used a simple electronic device that would sound a 
tone when alpha was present in the recording. This early work suggested that 
feedback could be used to teach subjects what it felt like to generate increased 
levels of alpha [1,2]. Because this “felt state” was most typically associated 
with calm and relaxation, some of the earliest neurofeedback involved teach-
ing a client to increase alpha activity as a treatment for ­anxiety [3].
 

242
EEG/ERP Analysis
11.2.2  Barry Sterman and SMR Training
At approximately the same time as Joe Kamiya’s experiments, Barry 
Sterman began examining the ability of animals to control EEG activity. 
Sterman, a professor of neurobiology and psychiatry at the University of 
California, Los Angeles, taught cats to increase the sensorimotor rhythm 
(SMR) over the motor cortex [4]. In fact, he found that directly rewarding 
increases in SMR activity, which was accompanied by decreased motoric 
activity while remaining alert, was more successful than directly rewarding 
bodily stillness.
Sterman later found that the cats trained to increase SMR activity were 
also resistant to seizures when exposed to seizure-causing chemical agents. 
This finding was later replicated with monkeys and used to develop an early 
neurofeedback protocol for seizure disorders in human [5].
These early experiments helped lay the groundwork for the understand-
ing that brain wave patterns were connected to states of consciousness and 
behavior. It was not long before the pioneers in this field began applying the 
basic methods of neurofeedback to conditions such as anxiety and seizure 
disorders.
11.2.3  Eugene Penniston and Elmer Green: Alpha/Theta Training
In the early 1960s, Elmer and Alyce Green began working with the Menninger 
Foundation on the development of simple biofeedback tools and autogenic 
training, primarily to help patients ease muscular tension. In 1965, at a meet-
ing of the Psychophysiological Research Society, Elmer was exposed to the 
work of Joe Kamiya. This, in addition to other research tying brain waves 
to states of consciousness, eventually led the Greens to begin experiment-
ing with theta training to enhance creativity [6]. Much of this early work 
was based on the observations of EEG signatures in experienced meditators, 
healers, and yogis. The use of neurofeedback to enhance alpha and theta 
brain waves was an attempt to develop some of the exceptional abilities 
observed in these individuals.
After taking a seminar with the Greens, Eugene Penniston began explor-
ing specific training protocols with alcoholics in treatment at the VA Medical 
Center in Fort Lyon, Colorado [7]. Penniston observed that for many alco-
holics, there was a decreased level of theta brain wave activity in the pos-
terior region of the brain that was at times accompanied by a decrease in 
alpha activity. In conjunction with Paul Kulkosky, Penniston developed 
what became known as the alpha/theta protocol. This form of neurofeed-
back involves rewarding both alpha and theta frequencies, typically in the 
parietal or occipital regions of the brain. As the training session progresses, 
the alpha eventually decreases and becomes lower than theta wave activity. 
This process is referred to as a “crossover” and is associated with the reso-
lution of traumatic memories and the integration of previously suppressed 
 

243
Neurofeedback
psychodynamic material [7]. The alpha/theta protocol was found to have 
very positive outcomes with substance dependence and PTSD [8,9].
11.2.4  Fehmi, Hardt, and Crane: Multichannel Alpha Synchrony Training
Les Fehmihad played a prominent role in the early days of biofeedback, 
helping to found what is now known as the Association for Applied 
Psychophysiology and Biofeedback (AAPB). Dr. Fehmi was initially inter-
ested in studying alpha brain wave synchrony as this state was associated 
with autonomic nervous system balance and increased efficiency in brain 
performance [10].
Fehmi discovered that synchronous alpha band activity increased dramat-
ically when a person was able to be attentive and surrender control simulta-
neously [11]. After experimenting with this type of training, Fehmi and his 
students reportedly felt a deep state of relaxation and focus that was often 
described as “transcendent” or “in the zone.” It was noted that the subjective 
quality of attention seemed to change after engaging in alpha synchrony 
training. Attention became more open and capable of taking in the gestalt 
of a situation. This was qualitatively different from the more typical narrow 
focus that is common during a stress response.
By utilizing multiple EEG channels, Fehmi helped establish a new kind of 
neurofeedback that focused on the impact of shaping a global alpha state [12]. 
Other early innovators, including Jim Hardt and Adam Crane, also utilized 
multichannel synchrony training, advancing the notion that such a protocol 
strengthened access to deeper states of consciousness and improved self-
regulation when compared to single-channel training [3].
Clients trained with EEG synchrony and verbally guided “open focus” 
techniques report significant changes in perception and behaviors [13]. This 
work has led to the development of protocols and applications used for con-
ditions including pain, depression, anxiety, and attention deficit hyperactiv-
ity disorder (ADHD) [14].
11.2.5  Lubar: Theta/Beta Training
Joel Lubar, a professor at the University of Tennessee, published the first arti-
cle describing the use of neurofeedback to address hyperactivity [15]. Lubar 
expanded on Sterman’s earlier work that reported on the successful use of 
SMR neurofeedback to reduce hyperactivity [16]. Lubar helped establish an 
arousal model of brain activity. The model recognized that reduced vigilance 
is associated with increases in theta activity, and increases in beta activity are 
associated with increases in cognitive processing [7,17]. Along with his wife 
Judy Lubar, Dr. Lubar began systematically using neurofeedback designed 
to decrease theta and increase beta as a treatment for ADHD. His protocols 
have been refined over the years and have become a standard [18], helping to 
establish validity and credibility in the field.

EEG/ERP Analysis
11.3  Description of the Neurofeedback Process
The process of neurofeedback consists of recording a brain-related signal, 
typically the EEG, and using electronics and computers to create a represen-
tation of that signal to teach the brain to change. Neurofeedback provides 
another channel of information for the brain to understand its own process 
(Figure 11.1).
Figure 11.2 shows a view of the various tissues, bone, scalp, and hair that 
comprise the human head. Because of the intervening tissue and bone, the 
signal on the scalp is thousands of times smaller than the potential if it were 
measured inside the head.

Neurofeedback
In order to record the EEG, sensors must be attached firmly to the skin of 
the scalp, so that an accurate reading of the electrical potentials on the sur-
face can be recorded (Figure 11.3).
The representation of brain electrical activity is known as feedback, hence 
the name neurofeedback. In practice, neurofeedback requires a practitioner 
to apply EEG sensors to the client’s scalp, and to then use the equipment to 
acquire a live EEG signal. This signal must be inspected to ensure that it is 
free of artifacts and thus suitable for neurofeedback. Once a quality EEG 
signal has been achieved, the system is operated in such a manner as to 
provide feedback in the form of visual, auditory, or vibrotactile stimulation 
(Figure 11.4).
11.3.1  Signal Processing
In order to derive useful feedback information from the raw EEG signal, it 
is necessary to subject it to some signal processing. This consists of math-
ematical operations that are implemented either in hardware or in software, 
and which provide a suitable measure of the relevant EEG parameters. 
It  is  important that the signal processing be done in “real time,” which

EEG/ERP Analysis
means that the derived information must be computed and made available 
quickly (typically within less than 1/10th of a second). The most common 
transform of the signal in neurofeedback training is the Fourier transform. 
Others employ a joint time frequency analysis, and fewer still apply the 
Hilbert transform.
Signal processing for neurofeedback is most often based on a mathe-
matical analysis of the EEG, producing estimates of the amount of energy

(or connectivity) in the EEG for particular frequency ranges. For historical 
as well as physiological reasons, the EEG bands (Figure 11.5) are generally 
divided into certain standard bands shown in Table 11.1.
While neurologists and other EEG analysts view these waveforms 
directly, neurofeedback requires the reduction of these patterns to some 
type of number, so that the software can produce feedback signals related 
to quantitative patterns. It is beyond the scope of this chapter to detail the 
signal processing used for neurofeedback. However, the basic operations 
yield estimates of important parameters such as the amount of power in a 
certain frequency band. More elaborate computations provide ­information 
such as the speed of each EEG signal, the presence or absence of signals, 
and how the signals reflect the quality of connections between brain 
regions.
11.3.2  Operant Conditioning
There is a variety of mechanisms involved in the process of any learned 
behavioral change, and neurofeedback employs more than one (Table 11.2). 
Of these, the most often cited, and one of the most basic, is operant condi-
tioning. This occurs whenever an organism is provided with feedback in 
the form of a reward (or punishment), and consequently learns to perform a 
desired behavior. In the case of neurofeedback, the “behavior” is the produc-
tion of a particular type of EEG wave or waves.
It is important to view neurofeedback within the broader context of brain 
self-regulation mechanisms [19]. The brain undergoes normal cycles of acti-
vation, separated by periods of deactivation or relaxation [16]. Figure 11.6 
shows the range that the brain may work within, as it moves from a state of 
concentration (activation) to a state of relaxation (deactivation).
While it might appear that the objective of neurofeedback is to increase 
brain waves that are deficient or decrease brain waves that are excessive, the 
goal is much broader and often involves attempts to encourage the brain into 
a more efficient and flexible state (Table 11.3).

11.4  Neurofeedback Modalities: qEEG-Guided Neurofeedback
The field of neurofeeback can be loosely divided into two categories: ­clinicians 
who employ a symptom-based approach and a treatment approach guided by 
a pretreatment qEEG. Clinicians who apply neurofeedback to present com-
plaints without a quantitative analysis are symptom-based practitioners and 
those who utilize age-normed data in assessment and training are said to be 
qEEG based. Quantitative analysis is based on the use of a reference database.

Neurofeedback
One dominant theme in the analysis of EEG, and in the design of neuro-
feedback protocols, is the application of reference databases. These consist 
of EEG data in various reduced forms that provide nominal or target values 
for key parameters. Databases employed for this purpose contain what are 
considered “normal” or “typical” EEGs, used to create statistical references 
or “norms” for comparison. In addition, a database may contain a number 
of abnormal or disordered subjects, used for comparison purposes. When 
abnormal as well as normal EEG is available, it is further possible to create 
“discriminant” functions that provide statistical estimates of the likelihood 
that a subject comes from one of the clinical populations.
There is a variety of ways to employ qEEG when planning and ­performing 
neurofeedback training. The traditional approach uses a qEEG analysis 
to determine which deviations from “normal” are relevant to presenting 
symptom expression, and designs a neurofeedback protocol that encour-
ages the brain toward a more normative state. This approach seeks to make 
“large things small” and “small things larger.” While this approach makes 
sense, training decisions should be made combining client complaint with 
­functional neuroanatomy. Simple linear decisions may not be consistent 
with the complexity of brain function. qEEG deviations may be coping 
or compensatory mechanisms that facilitate normal function. In order to 
­determine whether an observed deviation is pathological or compensatory, 
it is important that the neurofeedback practitioner have an understanding of 
functional neuroanatomy.
Despite the common observation that qEEG maps may become more nor-
mal or typical after treatment, it is not necessary for this to occur for the cli-
ent to experience benefits. The brain is not a simple, linear mechanism that 
always responds in a predictable or consistent manner. Clients may have 
various ingrained tendencies or patterns, coping mechanisms, compensat-
ing strategies, or other behavioral or physiological mechanisms at play that 
can interact with the brain and the neurofeedback process in complex ways.
11.4.1  Description of qEEG Metrics
The particular computed values that are derived from the EEG are referred 
to as metrics. This simply means that something is being measured. As with 
any phenomenon or object, there are various ways to compute and use dif-
ferent metrics. When we ask “how large” an EEG signal is, we refer to its 
magnitude in microvolts. The metrics related to signal amplitude (or power) 
in a single channel include absolute power (value in microvolts), relative 
power (percentage of total band), and ratios (between bands). These val-
ues are descriptors for the activation processes in the cortex. These metrics 
reflect the quality of a response to a stimulus or the ease of shifting behav-
ioral states. As absolute power increases or decreases, it reflects the activa-
tion dynamics of groups of cortical neurons to meet a behavioral demand. 
For instance, when one moves from actively reading to a drowsy state before 
 

250
EEG/ERP Analysis
sleep, groups of cortical neurons move from a low-amplitude desynchro-
nized fast activity to a higher-amplitude slow-wave synchronous activity.
In addition to evaluating the activation processes, qEEG metrics allow the 
clinician to evaluate network dynamics. This is done through metrics that 
relate to the relationships between pairs of channels. These indices most often 
include amplitude asymmetry (a measure of the ratio of energy from one site 
to another), coherence (a measure of the amount of shared energy between net-
work pairs), and phase (the metric used to determine the speed of information 
transfer). These metrics fall under the rubric of connectivity. Other connectiv-
ity metrics include comodulation and the spectral correlation coefficient, which 
reflect the magnitude consistency between two signals and the correlation 
between amplitude spectra, respectively. Connectivity metrics are described in 
detail by Collura [20]. These metrics (Figure 11.7) are generally computed for a 
given band, so that one generally refers to them, for example, as “the coherence 
between C3 and C4 in beta or the phase lag at T4 and P4in theta.”
11.4.2  Databases
11.4.2.1  BrainDX
BrainDX is a database that is derived from the original NXLink ­database created 
and reported by E. Roy John and his laboratory at the Brain Research Laboratory 
of New York University [21–24]. Originally, it largely consisted of eyes-closed 
data from over 700 normal subjects, and also included a large number of clinical 
(abnormal) cases. It has recently been supplemented with adult eyes-open data, 
with plans to add child eyes-open data in 2014. There is also an associated soft-
ware system that can conduct EEG analyses and generate reports. This system 
provides a complement of discriminant functions, sLORETA z-score images, 
and other report capabilities. The BrainDX database is incorporated into neuro-
feedback products by one vendor, Brainmaster Technologies, Inc.

11.4.2.2  Applied Neuroscience/Neuroguide
The Neuroguide database was created at the University of Maryland, as the 
Lifespan Database, and is currently provided by the Applied Neuroscience 
Institute (ANI) [25]. It contains approximately 625 subjects, and spans the 
age range from birth to 80, with both eyes-open and ­eyes-closed data. 
The Neuroguide application includes artifacting, as well as, optional dis-
criminant functions, LORETA analysis, and other capabilities.
The ANI database is also used for z-score neurofeedback, by a number of pro-
viders, who incorporate the database into their own neurofeedback ­products. 
The consistency between the Neuroguide and the NXLink (now  BrainDX) 
database has been established and documented, showing that essentially 
identical results can be expected regardless of which database is used [25].
11.4.2.3  SKIL
The SKIL database was created by David Kaiser and Barry Sterman [26] and 
is primarily an adult database. It contains eyes-open, eyes-closed, and task 
conditions. There is also a SKIL application that can read in EEG files from 
various providers and provide analysis functions. SKIL also provides neuro-
feedback software that operates on several types of EEG equipment.
11.4.2.4  HBI/WinEEG
The Human Brain Institute (HBI) database was developed by a team in 
Russia, led by Dr. Juri Kropotov [27]. The database comprises 885 healthy 
subjects of both sexes aged 7 to 89 years. The subjects were divided into 
20 age groups. It is incorporated into the WinEEG system, and can be used to 
create maps and reports from EEGs read in from standard EEG files.
11.4.2.5  BRID
The Brain Resource International Database (BRID) is very extensive and 
includes a wide range of abnormal as well as normal EEGs. The database 
consists of more than 5,000 subjects that range in age from 6 to 100 years. 
BRID provides a report service for subscribers, and primarily uses equip-
ment provided by the company to affiliated practitioners.
11.5  qEEG-Based Neurofeedback-Inhibit/Enhance Training
Inhibit or enhance training, also known as “traditional” neurofeedback, 
is based on providing rewards when particular frequency bands are either 
present in excess and so are “inhibited” or when they are insufficient and 
 

252
EEG/ERP Analysis
so are “enhanced.” This type of training is commonly done using the tradi-
tional bands for training, such as theta, alpha, low beta, beta, or high beta. For 
example, after consulting a brain map, a protocol for relaxation may include 
enhancing when alpha absolute power is insufficient compared to the age-
normed population mean, but inhibiting when theta or high beta are large. 
The rewarding or reinforcing is commonly done when the chosen EEG band 
is above a specified threshold during enhance training and below a specified 
threshold during inhibit training. Table 11.4 shows some common protocols 
based on enhancing or inhibiting components. Enhance training is also some-
times called uptraining, while inhibit training is known as downtraining.
11.5.1  z-Score Training
z-Score training was created by the collaboration between two software and 
equipment vendors: Applied Neuroscience Inc and Brainmaster Technologies 
Inc with the contributions of several clinicians [28–30]. The training is based 
on the principle of using statistical z-scores in real time, rather than using 
raw signal amplitudes or other variables. In order to perform z-score train-
ing, it is necessary to select a suitable reference database (see Section 11.4.2), 
as well as to have software that can compute z-scores in real time. By using 
z-score parameters during the process of training, it is possible to inform the 
brain whenever any of one or more (often many more) variables are within a 
certain range of normal (e.g., +/−1.0 standard deviation). This type of train-
ing allows for the training of large numbers of variables across multiple 
brain sites simultaneously.
A typical set of pre- and post-treatment qEEG maps collected before and 
after z-score training is shown in Figure 11.8, as an example. It shows that there 
may be particular deviations from normal (excesses or deficits) in the initial 
map, and that these deviations may be partially or wholly resolved (normal-
ized) in the post-treatment assessment [28]. In order to aid in understand-
ing statistical deviance in the brain maps, an illustration of the ­relationship 
between color and standard deviations is provided in Figure 11.9. The qEEG 
and neurofeedback community accepts two standard deviations and greater 
as a representation of abnormal activity.

The following coherence maps (Figure 11.10) taken before treatment and

brain connectivity is more typical of normal following the treatment.
11.5.2  sLORETA/LORETA
LORETA and sLORETA are methods that can be used to extrapolate the 
activity of deeper brain regions from surface EEG data. This has been called 
the inverse solution as it applies an algorithm that utilizes the surface ampli-
tudes to identify current sources below the outer layer of the cortex. While 
this generally requires a minimum of 19 sensors, it allows the client to receive

feedback that is specific to deeper structures in the brain, such as the cingu-
late gyrus or the right insula. It measures the magnitude of current with 
current source density (CSD):nanoamperes per cubic millimeter. In addition, 
sLORETA/LORETA coherence and phase are currently being calculated and 
trained in some applications.
LORETA and sLORETA can also be combined with z-scores, so that each 
brain region is evaluated in comparison with a database of brain activity.

11.6  Neurofeedback Modalities: Symptom-Based Approaches
Symptom-based approaches rely on applying the appropriate training 
­protocols to the specific presenting problems. This paradigm was established 
at the commencement of the field and is applied differentially determined 
by client complaint, functional location in brain, and clinical experience. 
The symptom-based approach began with alpha band training, followed 
shortly after by SMR and alpha/theta training. More recently, symptom-
based approaches have included slow cortical potential (SCP) training, alpha 
asymmetry and infra-slow fluctuation/infra-low frequency training. These 
neurofeedback training protocols are also utilized by qEEG-based clinicians.
11.6.1  Alpha Training
Alpha training is most often used for relaxation, peak performance, pain 
relief, and anxiety. It is performed in an eyes-closed condition in one or 
more channels [13,31,32]. The client attempts to increase electrical activity 
in the 8–12 Hz range while simultaneously inhibiting slower frequencies, 
usually 4–7 Hz and a higher band in the 20–30 Hz range. Alpha activity is 
trained in the posterior regions of the cortex, most frequently in the parietal 
regions. Jim Hardt, Les Fehmi, and others train alpha synchrony in two or 
more channels. In this form of alpha training, channels are summed together 
and microvolt increases rewarded under the assumption that synchronous 
neuronal assemblies firing simultaneously are responsible for amplitude 
increases.
11.6.2  SMR Training
SMR training was developed by Barry Sterman for seizure disorders [5]. 
It was later utilized by Joel Lubar and others for ADHD [15]. It has been used 
for a host of other clinical presentations and may be the most ­frequently 
studied and utilized neurofeedback training. The SMR band is commonly 
defined as 12–15 Hz. This range of frequencies is rewarded for amplitude 
increases while simultaneously inhibiting lower and higher frequency 
bands. The protocol is executed on the sensorimotor strip at one site or a 
combination of sites, usually C3, C4, and Cz. Ordinarily, it is performed in a 
single channel montage. Less frequently, two or more channels or a bipolar 
montage electrode array is implemented. The result of the training is often 
improved attention and reduction of restlessness or motoric stillness.
11.6.3  Alpha-Theta Training
Alpha/theta training, also known as deep states work, emerged from the 
work of Elmer Green, Steven Farhion, and Dale Walters at the Menninger 
 

256
EEG/ERP Analysis
Clinic over 30 years ago [6,33]. Eugene Penniston and Paul Kulkowski later 
applied the intervention to alcoholics in recovery and Vietnam veterans 
with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [8,9]. It is executed with the eyes 
closed, usually with the client in a reclining chair. Alpha/theta training is 
performed with one or more electrodes that are most frequently placed in the 
posterior areas of the cortex. Both the alpha and theta bands are enhanced 
while inhibiting the delta band and a higher frequency band, typically 
20–30 Hz. The goal of the training is to enter a “crossover” state wherein 
the theta band is greater in amplitude than the alpha band. Physiologically, 
crossover resembles a hypnagogic/hypnopompic state: the state of con-
sciousness entered just before sleep or just before awakening. This cross-
over state is associated with spontaneous imagery and autobiographical 
memories and is said to enable individuals to process emotionally salient 
material. Alpha/theta training is frequently used with hypnotic induc-
tion or a scripted guided imagery that addresses the ­subject’s ­presenting 
problem.
11.6.4  Alpha Asymmetry Training
Alpha asymmetry training was developed by Peter Rosenfeld and Elsa and 
Rufus Baehr in the mid-1990s [34]. They found a strong correlation between 
asymmetries in alpha absolute power in the frontal lobes and mood dis-
orders. They proposed that right anterior activation is related to increases 
in withdrawal-related emotions, and left anterior activation is related to 
approach-related behaviors. Their technique was predicated on the assump-
tion that the alpha rhythm reflected hypoactivation and that a greater alpha 
magnitude in the left frontal area indicated a deficit of approach-related 
behaviors mediated by that area. They did not use normative data but relied 
on an alpha asymmetry score obtained by calculating the ratio of the left 
and right prefrontal alpha. They used a two-channel montage at F3/F4 ref-
erenced to Cz.
11.6.5  Slow Cortical Potential
Slow cortical potential (SCP) training has been employed, largely in Europe, 
for more than 30 years [35]. It has been used to train epilepsy [36], brain–
computer interface [37], and ADHD [38]. As originally applied, SCP train-
ing was a “one size fits all protocol” with the majority of the training done 
at the vertex of the brain. In this early manifestation, the client attempted 
to produce cortical excitation, a negative DC shift, in the case of ADHD; 
or cortical inhibition, a positive DC shift, in the case of epilepsy over the 
course of many short trials [36]. More recently, SCP training has evolved to 
focus on areas other than the vertex and trains both negative and positive 
 

257
Neurofeedback
gradient shifts in the same session with proportions of ­negative and 
­positive trials dependent on client presentation [39].
11.6.6  Infra-Slow Fluctuation/Infra-Low Frequency
Infra-slow fluctuation (ISF) or infra-low frequency (ILF) training is a 
­frequency-based training. The frequency bands addressed are different 
in the two techniques. However, both paradigms filter and train the very 
low frequency band known as the ultradian rhythm, which is less than 
0.01 Hz [40]. These slow rhythms are influenced by changes in amplitude 
and polarization of the direct current (DC) signal [41]. Infra-slow training 
owes its lineage to the early beta/SMR training of Susan Othmer and EEG 
Spectrum [42]. That intervention was done with a single channel of EEG and 
an intra-hemispheric bipolar montage on the motor strip and temporal lobes. 
The technique was modified by replacing a set reward band with a 3 Hz win-
dow that was shifted up or down depending on the client response.
Infra-slow training produces immediate state shifts in the client. The trainer 
targets state regulation in real time by discovering an optimum frequency 
through trial and error for each client. Success is defined by the immediate 
improvement in affect and arousal regulation in session and ultimately by 
generalized improvements in behavioral and state regulation in life.
Over time, it became apparent that the vast majority of clients were ­finding 
an optimum clinical response at lower and lower frequencies. As the opti-
mum frequencies trained went below 1 Hz, it became clear that the opti-
mum response was more readily achieved when training was executed with 
a DC-coupled amplifier. This technique has begun to ­incorporate normative 
data and simultaneous bipolar and referential montages [41].
11.7  Patient Assessment
Neurofeedback clinicians utilize a range of strategies for assessing client 
symptoms including subjective symptom questionnaires, objective neuro-
psychological testing, and qEEG. The use of assessment instruments tends 
to divide along professional boundaries, with access to neuropsychological 
tests often determined by professional practice laws.
The vast majority of neurofeedback clinicians use some form of a subjec-
tive symptom questionnaire that is often set up in a Likert Scale ­format. The 
Continuous Performance Test is an instrument also in frequent use among 
practitioners. The use of pre/post-qEEGs is becoming a more ­frequent part 
of many practices. A smaller group of practitioners, largely ­psychologists, 
utilize neuropsychological testing.
 

258
EEG/ERP Analysis
11.7.1  Symptom Assessment
Although a formal assessment or psychological evaluation is not always 
­necessary, it can be extremely helpful in the process of developing an 
­efficient treatment plan and tracking symptom change. For example, if a cli-
ent were seeking neurofeedback for “memory problems,” objective testing 
may reveal differences between auditory and visual memory; or working 
memory versus long-term memory; or it may reveal that the problem stems 
more from problems with attention or anxiety. These distinctions may be too 
subtle for many clients to accurately perceive or articulate. This clarification 
may be important in relation to electrode placement, protocol selection, and 
any adjunct strategies that may be implemented.
Neurofeedback clinicians utilize a range of strategies for assessing client 
symptoms including objective neuropsychological testing, subjective symp-
tom questionnaires, and qEEG integrated assessments. A sampling of these 
types of evaluations will now be discussed.
11.7.2  Neuropsychological Assessments
Neuropsychological assessments involve completion of a well-defined set of 
tasks known to be linked to specific brain regions. These assessments are 
based on standardized administration procedures and scored in ­relation to 
a normative database. Such testing can reveal specific deficits in neuropsy-
chological functioning and help identify brain areas that may be involved 
in the deficits. These tests commonly examine constructs such as memory, 
intelligence, language skills, sensorimotor, visual/spatial processing, and 
executive function tasks. Traditionally, these assessments consist of a battery 
of tests that would be administered to the client by a trained psychologist or 
psychometrist. Examples of this type of testing might include the Wechsler 
Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS), the Test of Memory and Learning (TOMAL), 
or the Tower of London Test. Once administered, these tests would require 
individual scoring and interpretation.
11.7.3  Computerized Neuropsychological Batteries
Programs such as MicroCog, IntegNeuro, and CNS Vital Signs are specifi-
cally designed for clinical use and allow the neurofeedback practitioner to 
administer the assessment in their office in 30–90 min. These programs often 
have both short and extended versions, include multiple domains of con-
cern, require minimal computer literacy, and provide nearly instant scoring 
and report generation. Among the most commonly used assessments in this 
­category is MicroCog.
MicroCog was the first computerized neuropsychological test ­battery 
developed for clinical use. It has measures in five domains, including atten-
tion/mental control, memory, reasoning/calculation, spatial ­processing, and 
 

259
Neurofeedback
reaction time. It is modestly priced and has been shown to be an ­effective 
screen for early dementia among elderly subjects [43]. It has also been shown 
to be effective in distinguishing between dementia and depression and mea-
suring cognitive impairment related to drug abuse [44].
11.7.4  Targeted Neuropsychological Tests
An alternative to a battery of tests is to utilize tests specific to one area of 
concern. Potentially the most popular type of assessment utilized by neu-
rofeedback practitioners is the computerized test of attention or continuous 
performance test (CPT). These tests present the client with a series of simple 
target and nontarget cues either through visual and auditory information. 
The client’s performance is measured by examining variables such as reac-
tion time, reaction time standard error, errors of omission, errors of com-
mission, and signal detection to a normative sample. Performance on these 
tests has repeatedly been shown to differentiate ADHD from nonsymptom-
atic groups [45]. The most commonly used of these tests include the T.O.V.A. 
(Test of Variables of Attention), Conners’, and the IVA (Integrated Visual and 
Auditory) continuous performance tests. This type of assessment is benefi-
cial for symptom clarification, treatment planning, and progress tracking.
11.7.5  Subjective Assessment Questionnaires
Subjective assessment questionnaires utilized by neurofeedback ­practitioners 
are extremely varied in focus, length, and target population. Some are inven-
tories that measure multiple dimensions such as the Minnesota Multiphasic 
Personality Inventory (MMPI) and The Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory 
(MCMI). Others are very specific to a concern, such as anxiety, depression, or 
autism spectrum disorders. For adult assessments, these questionnaires are 
typically self-report. As such, they must be interpreted ­cautiously, taking into 
consideration issues such as social desirability, malingering, secondary gain, 
acquiescence, and the capacity for a distressed individual to report accurately. 
Despite these concerns, self-report questionnaires have consistently been 
found to be a valuable tool for clinical assessment. Many of the scales designed 
to assess children, such as the Behavior Assessment System for Children, offer 
teacher and parent versions of the scale in addition to a self-report. This allows 
cross-comparison of ratings from different perspectives and from different 
environments.
11.7.6  qEEG Integrated Assessments
Several companies offer assessment tools that utilize qEEG data in con-
junction with additional assessments to assist neurofeedback practitioners 
in ­protocol  selection. Thatcher [46] has developed a symptom ­checklist 
with the goal of linking brain structure to neuropsychological function 
 

260
EEG/ERP Analysis
based on fMRI, PET, and EEG/MEG research studies. Other systems such 
as the MiniQ Analysis by New Mind or the CNC 1020 system by Brownback 
and Mason offer neurofeedback recommendations based on matching 
reported symptoms to implicated brain regions.
Effective and efficient treatment with neurofeedback is predicated on a 
clear understanding of the symptoms involved, related brain areas, and an 
analysis of the client’s qEEG. As this brief section illustrates, this information 
can be obtained through many avenues and must be considered alongside 
issues such as accessibility and cost. For many practitioners, finding the right 
combination of tools is a trial-and-error process that evolves with the tech-
nology and scope of practice.
11.7.7  Event-Related Potential Assessment
Event-related potentials (ERPs) have been utilized as an assessment tool to 
measure the impact of neurofeedback training for almost two decades [47]. 
ERP data that has been combined with auditory oddball tasks and other 
­testing paradigms has been largely limited to the treatment of ADHD [47–52]. 
Despite its early adoption by Joel Lubar [47], the assessment strategy is 
employed mainly outside of the United States. Professor Yuri Kropotov sug-
gests that the difference between ERP and qEEG analysis is that ERPs reflect 
information flow within cortical networks, whereas qEEG reflects mecha-
nisms of cortical self-regulation. According to Dr. Kroptov, it is quite possible 
to have a normal self-regulatory regime but an abnormal information flow 
or vice versa [50].
11.8  Addressing Conditions with Neurofeedback
From simple ADHD to complex disorders of children on the autism spec-
trum, to those with affective disorders, case reports of the positive effects of 
EEG biofeedback abound. Far fewer controlled studies exist. The dearth of 
controlled studies has begun to change recently with ADHD being the most 
thoroughly researched disorder.
11.8.1  ADHD
Lubar and Shouse published the first reports of neurofeedback training 
for ADHD in 1976. Employing an ABA research design, they demon-
strated that hyperactive symptoms decreased when SMR was enhanced 
and increased when SMR was inhibited [15]. The outcomes in this study 
led to scores of studies employing SMR and several variations of this train-
ing to address ADHD. For a more detailed description of these protocols, 
 

261
Neurofeedback
also see Monastra et al. [53]. Since that time, attention problems have been 
the most thoroughly investigated issue to date. Many controlled studies 
have demonstrated a large effect size for neurofeedback [54].
Slow cortical potential and theta/beta ratio training have been studied 
in the successful treatment of ADHD [38,55]. Both neurofeedback protocols 
show comparable results on the three features of ADHD: inattention, impul-
sivity, and hyperactivity [55]. The theta/beta ratio training was actually an 
inhibit/enhance protocol that encouraged beta and reduced theta. A few 
of the studies included frontal sites for training, whereas in the majority of 
studies the theta/beta training addressed central strip locations (C3, Cz, C4) 
as did the SCP training.
In 2009, Arns et  al. published a meta-analysis that concluded that neu-
rofeedback can be considered an efficacious and specific intervention for 
ADHD with a large effect size for inattention and impulsivity and a medium 
effect size for hyperactivity [54]. The designation of Efficacious and Specific 
was determined by guidelines jointly accepted by the International Society 
for Neurofeedback and Research (ISNR) and the Association for Applied 
Psychophysiology and Biofeedback (AAPB), and is analogous to guidelines 
accepted by the American Psychological Association (APA).
The American Academy of Pediatrics has recently declared EEG biofeed-
back a “Level 1 Best Support” intervention for ADHD. Their October 2012 
report on Evidence-Based Child and Adolescent Psychosocial Interventions 
concluded that neurofeedback had the highest level of support based on at 
least two randomized, placebo-controlled studies [56]. The academy’s deci-
sion was based on three studies [55,57,58], two that utilized fMRI to measure 
the change in the neural substrates of selective attention after neurofeedback 
training.
Other protocols that have not been systematically investigated have dem-
onstrated promise in the training of this disorder. Recently, several cases 
involving children with attention problems were treated with z-score 
training with positive results [28]. The enhancement of regional cerebral 
blood oxygenation (Hemoenphalography) in specific cerebral locations has 
been shown to increase sustained attention [59]. The training of the infra-
low ­frequency band has produced normalization on the T.O.V.A in a recent 
study [60].
11.8.2  Other Conditions
Other conditions have not yet reached a Best Support level of research. 
However, there are substantial studies for a variety of complaints that dem-
onstrate the effectiveness of neurofeedback training. From traumatic brain 
injury to autism, the list of conditions addressed continues to grow. A vari-
ety of neurofeedback protocols have proved their effectiveness with a wide 
assortment of clinical presentations. These interventions have been applied by 
providers whose specialties cut across the human service delivery spectrum,

including mental health practitioners, educators, ­physical ­therapists, and 
medical personnel [61].
Anxiety, the main staple of most psychotherapy practices, has been 
addressed effectively by neurofeeback with dozens of small studies [32,62,63], 
as have depression [64,65], obsessive compulsive disorder [66], and PTSD [8]. 
This effectiveness has led many mental health practitioners to include neu-
rofeedback in their practice, making psychologists, social workers, and 
other mental health professionals the largest group of providers in the 
field. At the same time, EEG biofeedback has expanded the typical client 
base. Many in the mental health professions have utilized neurofeedback 
for substance abuse [9,67], autism spectrum disorders [60,68–70], and sleep 
disorders [71]. Promoting peak performance in athletes, artists, and other 
professions has become the primary focus of some practices [72–74]. Mental 
health practitioners have traditionally been involved with educators in 
eliminating impediments to learning. Neurofeedback has been central to 
­addressing ADHD and more recently has been used to address other learn-
ing disabilities [75–77].
Doctors, nurses, occupational therapists, physical therapists, and other allied 
health practitioners utilize neurofeedback in their practices, and some have 
done so since the beginning of the field. Each brings a special set of skills that is 
complemented by neurofeedback. Seizure disorder, possibly the first disorder 
treated with neurofeedback [5,78], has recently become an intervention of inter-
est to neurologists and other health professionals [29,60,79]. Migraine head-
aches have been the focus of neurofeedback for over 20 years [80]. Recently, 
a large study confirmed the early promise of this intervention guided by a 
neurologist who employed qEEG in the treatment paradigm [81]. Traumatic 
brain injury has been the focus of many in the mental health field who devel-
oped neurofeedback for brain injury to supplement the sparse treatment 
options of traditional medicine. Jonathan Walker, a neurologist and pioneer in 
the neurofeedback field, has been instrumental in developing neurofeedback 
strategies for the brain injured [82].
In order to understand the magnitude of the research, a viewing of the 
Comprehensive Neurofeedback Bibliography amassed by the International 
Society for Neurofeedback and Research is suggested [61].
11.9  Conclusion
A large body of research spanning several decades contends that neuro-
feedback has proved useful for a wide variety of psychological and medi-
cal conditions. An assortment of protocols has been applied to accomplish 
these successful outcomes. It is reasonable to propose that neurofeedback 
does not treat anything specific but rather optimizes the central nervous 
 

263

system, thereby improving general function. Recent research recognizes 
that EEG biofeedback accomplishes this task by conditioning brain elec-
trical activity and so is more aptly referred to as training rather than 
treatment.
The idea that central nervous system regulation is the result of neurofeed-
back training may help to explain the reported positive impact of neurofeed-
back on a host of disorders. The growing body of research that supports this 
perception underscores neurofeedback’s recent acceptance by mainstream 
health practitioners and the general public. From its beginnings at the 
University of Chicago in the latter half of the last century, neurofeedback has 
become a worldwide phenomenon. The growth of the industry has occurred 
largely without government or academic support. Kept alive by the efforts of 
a few pioneers who recognized the efficacy of this intervention, neurofeed-
back has only recently begun to garner the popular recognition, professional 
acceptance, and institutional support that it deserves.
Frank H. Duffy, M.D., Professor and Pediatric Neurologist at Harvard 
Medical School, stated in an editorial in the January 2000 issue of the journal 
Clinical Electroencephalography that the scientific literature advocates for the 
application of neurofeedback to address many disorders. “In my opinion, if 
any medication had demonstrated such a wide spectrum of efficacy it would 
be universally accepted and widely used ..... It is a field to be taken seriously 
by all” [83].

EEG/ERP Analysis
12.1  Overview of Cultural Neuroscience Framework
In general, cultural neuroscience (CN) could be understood as a paradigm 
that put forward the framework of culture to understand the influence of 
culture’s elements such as values, practices, and beliefs regarding human 
thought. Uniquely, the construction of a CN framework relies on theories 
from various disciplines such as anthropology, psychology, and genetics. 
In a recent study, CN was framed in multiple time scales (situation, ontog-
eny, and phylogeny) in order to explain how the diversity of the cultural 
values and genetic factors contour the complexity of the human mind and 
behavior [1]. Similar to the previous contribution in CN Ref. [2] states that 
cultural capacities and their transmission that arose from complex human 
mental and neurobiological processes were critically determined from bidi-
rectional indicators (culture and gene) across two timescales: macro and 
micro timescales. As an example, the macro timescale determines phylog-
eny and lifespan, whereas the micro timescale determines the situation. 
In  this regard [3], “culture” is viewed as a set of traits that is inflexible 
and has specificities. In other words, the variation of population culture 
can manifest in neural activation patterns. In Ref. [4], the specific impor-
tance of culture for the brain is highlighted as a fundamental value in the 
­development of racial identity and ideology.
12.1.1  Benefits and Challenges
Looking at culture not only from the behavioral point of view but also at the 
neural level will prove beneficial when answering questions such as, how do 
cultural traits affect neural processes and shape human behavior? [1,5]. A cul-
tural approach, through interdisciplinary educational infrastructure and 
research [6], may provide a better understanding of health disparity across 
racial groups [7,8]. Besides of notifying interethnic ideology, the advantages 
of the cultural neuroscience approach include merging the health quality 
across diverse cultural populations [2]. In addition, CN could reflect crucial 
implication in health disparities and public policy development [1]. The CN 
framework should be expanded into integration of other neuroscience tools 
as well (such as a combination of event-related potential (ERP) and fMRI) 
and, thus, more useful data on human neural activities could be obtained. 
The existing fMRI data in culture studies that has been done mostly among 
Western, industrialized, rich, educated, and democratic populations can be 
used as a reference for further action such as exploring the CN of an underde-
veloped community and integrating powerful tools of neuroscience (i.e., ERP 
and fMRI) to develop a more specific CN framework within this community. 
Within this CN framework, the trait of “individualism–­collectivism” in cul-
tural dimensions that modulate the psychological neural basis can be high-
lighted, together with identification of other cultural traits such as a preference 
 

271
EEG-fMRI in Psychiatry, Psychology, and Cultural Neuroscience
for social hierarchy and racial identification [1]. However, ­bringing culture into 
the research mainstream for a national agenda in the future is not an easy task. 
The main challenge in the area of CN, indeed, is to empower it as an educa-
tional medium that is able to provide a ­comprehensive and culturally sensitive 
framework to educate the future generation. This objective could be achieved 
by improving the research infrastructure, increasing research capacity, and 
establishing appropriate ethical standards. It is important to note that CN is an 
interdisciplinary framework. Thus, in order to implement CN, interdisciplin-
ary training is critically needed across the social and natural sciences to meet 
the nation’s agenda.
12.1.2  Suggestions for Future Work
Neuro-culture interaction permits understanding of culturally patterned 
neural activities through neuroplasticity at the cellular level, which accel-
erates biological adaptation and social survival [9]. In order to understand 
the interaction of neuro-culture, cultural neuroscientists used various 
approaches (i.e., quantitatively and qualitatively), whether at the societal or 
individual cellular level [10]. An anthropologist, for example, implements a 
behavioral survey to detect cultural characteristics (i.e., values, practices, and 
beliefs) of a group of people from different societies [11]. Behavioral surveys 
such as using open-ended interviews and ethnography provides rich infor-
mation on values, practices, and beliefs held by oneself and others [11,12]. 
From the cultural neuroscience toolbox [5], there are three major levels that 
can be used to study and explore culture. These are level 1, a behavioral 
paradigm (to observe the interaction between culture and mind); level 2, 
which consists of using fMRI, PET, ERP, and TMS (to observe the interac-
tion between brain and mind); and level 3, which involves using candidate 
functional polymorphisms (to observe the interaction between brain and 
genes). All these classification are seen through ontogeny and phylogeny. 
In a recent critical review, the approach to the CN framework was imple-
mented by using fMRI to detect the “universalism and differentialism” in 
culture practice [3]. It was reported that the neural response is more sen-
sitive to cultural value such as “individualism–collectivism” than cultural 
origin, especially during one’s self-appraisal [2]. Another culture construct 
is “tightness–looseness,” which refers to one’s obedience to the social norms 
prevailing in society. The tightness–looseness may reflect the differentiation 
of mental patterns across cultures [13]. For example, people who live under a 
tight culture may have a great tendency to adhere to and value their cultural 
norms. However, those who are not under this kind of society (i.e., loose 
culture) are more likely to be not sensitive to their societal norms. To take 
another example, it is indicated that people’s morality is a product, at least in 
part, of the coevolution between the “tightness–looseness” value of culture 
with the serotonin transporter gene [14]. Meanwhile, culture–gene coevolu-
tionary models of human behavior established in the literature help us to 
 

272
EEG/ERP Analysis
understand the culture–biology interactions in adaptive behavior [15–17]. 
As a result, in human reaction to adaptive behavior, it was observed that the 
serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) indicates reciprocal evolutionary change 
and interaction with the cultural values of “individualism–­collectivism” [15]. 
In addition, the S allele of 5HTTLPR, the polymorphism that occurs in the 
promoter region of the gene, is likely to be more prevalent in “collectivis-
tic” nations, compared to the long (L) allele [15]. Implementation of the CN 
framework in underdeveloped countries is urgently needed, in part because 
nearly all the neuroculture evidence from the neuroimaging method was 
gathered from the Western industrialized population, which is educated and 
has high income levels [5,18]. Thus, the CN framework should be tested and 
established in Eastern underdeveloped populations in order to depict a clear 
picture of the neuroculture patterns and constructs. From the above obser-
vations, authors are hoping that some neuro-based society action could be 
undertaken in future.
First, the integration of the combination of quantitative EEG, qualitative EEG, 
and fMRI to detect values such as “individualism–collectivism” and “­tightness–
looseness” that construct culture is done in order to observe the interaction 
between culture and social problems in society. Thus, authors suggest using 
a comprehensive CN tool (that encompasses behavioral surveys, genetic stud-
ies, qualitative and quantitative EEG, as well as fMRI) to gain a comprehen-
sive understanding of “culture-social problem” interaction. To cater to social 
problems in society, it is suggested to pay attention to social problems such as 
loitering in public places by adolescents and abandonment of babies by moth-
ers, as these two issues are still understudied, and more evidence is needed to 
prove hypotheses such as this one: “culture differences in a multi-ethnic popu-
lation may construct the human mind and behavior, and thus, some races may 
be predisposed to anti-social activities such as loitering and abandonment.” 
In a multi-ethnic population such as Malaysia, the occurrence of loitering and 
abandonment is likely to be popular among certain races. This raises question 
of whether a neural substrate is playing a role in these differences. The authors 
are hoping to explore some implications from this suggestion, in particular, the 
development of a pre-CN framework prior to implementing the full framework 
of CN. The main aim of this pre-framework of CN is to detect any abnormality 
of the brain pattern that may exist in social misfits (i.e., loitering and abandon-
ment) before the interaction between culture and the social problem is observed 
(i.e., the CN framework), in order to detect “individualism–­collectivism” and 
“tightness–loitering in public places by adolescents and abandonment of babies 
by mothers’ looseness” in culture practice. Implementation of neuroscience 
tools (qualitative and quantitative EEG, as well as fMRI) to discover this social 
phenomenon can be done in two settings: the laboratory or a real setting. In 
order to observe loitering activity among adolescents, the authors suggest using 
wireless EEG-MINDO in a real setting (such as on the stairs of a shopping com-
plex, other public places, etc.) to identify the brain pattern during the real event 
while adolescents are ­loitering. This would help to discover whether loitering 
 

273
EEG-fMRI in Psychiatry, Psychology, and Cultural Neuroscience
activity has a ­positive or negative effect to the EEG pattern of the brain, than 
­pre-occupied occasion. Meanwhile, for the pre-CN framework in the cases of 
abandonment, the authors suggest using neuroscience tools (qualitative and 
quantitative EEG, as well as fMRI) to detect a woman’s “intention” to abandon 
her baby. This means that all pregnant women should be screened to detect any 
abnormality of the EEG pattern in the brain as a biomarker of their intention 
to abandon their babies. Of course, ethical issues will be raised and debated. 
In  addition, a study should be implemented in a very large population to 
develop normative data as a reference and determine the cutoff value in order 
to differentiate between positive and negative EEGs.
Second, NGOs have a role to play. It is hoped that NGOs (together with 
the government) around the world will be using wireless EEG-MINDO 
effectively as a screening tool at the community level, especially to develop 
education packages among adolescents who like loitering and wasting time 
outside their home. Similarly, it is hoped that NGOs (together with govern-
ment) will actively take action to prevent the cases of baby abandonments by 
implementing a screening program for pregnant women, by using wireless 
or non-wireless EEG (or in combination with fMRI).
At this stage, incorporating the element of neuromarketing in the CN 
framework could prove very timely. Neuromarketing is a subfield in the 
neuroscience discipline that offers an understanding of the human neural 
mechanisms underlying the cognitive response to marketing stimuli. NGOs 
and neuromarketers may work together, going beyond the scope of the 
research or community service, looking at the potential market of EEG as 
an effective tool to detect the abnormality of brain activities among social 
misfits. In this case, the social problem is manipulated as a “product.” This 
means that wireless EEG should be able to reflect any changes in brain activi-
ties while subjects are performing relevant tasks related to social problems. 
For example, in the cases of loitering, subjects are being tested to choose 
between two products (in this case, “product” refers to “social problem”), 
the first product being “During my free time, I like loitering at the shopping 
complex with my friends” and the second product “During my free time, 
I like sitting at home and watching TV.” Similarly, in the abandonment issue, 
some tricky task can be tested to detect if the EEG can detect any abnormali-
ties in brain activities to reflect “unacceptance value” in society. This task 
could be directed to pregnant women, and their response to items such as 
“I love my baby so much” (as Product 1), and “I love my baby but this is not 
the right time to have a baby” (as Product 2) could be observed.
By incorporating neuromarketing in the CN framework, the EEG mar-
keter could narrow the target through gaining a comprehensive under-
standing of the underlying neurobiology from the interaction between 
psychological and marketing phenomena [19], within the specific market 
target: social problem or social violence market. Although there are debates 
on the effect of a product’s brand (I would like to refer to the product’s brand 
here as a value and a belief held in society) on consumer decision making 
 

274
EEG/ERP Analysis
(I would like to refer “consumer” here as a unit in society who has to make a 
choice between accepted behavior and non-accepted behavior) [20]. The neu-
robiological basis of brand preference such as the dorsolateral prefrontal 
cortex (DLPFC) might instigate reward-motivated behavior through con-
nections to the mesolimbic system [21]. The ventromedial prefrontal cortex 
(VMPFC) was suggested to be involved in making choices from among the 
brands offered, even though this suggestion has been challenged [22].
The success of a CN-neuromarketing framework indeed relies on the 
element of trustworthiness in making any choices in the social market. 
Using the combination of EEG and fMRI to detect trustworthiness in brand 
preference is a great approach and could be implemented as there is evi-
dence indicating the activation of amygdala and the insula cortex from the 
fMRI scans [23]. Neurobiology modulation of trusting also involves sev-
eral neurotransmitters and hormones such as oxytocin [23,24]. However, 
in order to market EEG in this social problem market, the gender perspec-
tive should be taken into consideration as women might activate the brain 
region differently, especially related to this “trustworthiness” issue [25]. 
The challenges of CN-neuromarketing may also arise from the appropri-
ate ethical guidelines and potential ethical dilemmas to maximize the 
profit [26]. After all, the growing interest among neurologist in neuromar-
keting (and implementation of CN-neuromarketing in the future market 
target) should ensure that the marketing environment will prevent the 
market from being a manipulative way of selling unnecessary goods and 
services [27].
In summary, marketing research questions from neuromarketing (and 
neuroconsumer as well) can be a great agenda in the world of neurosci-
ence and economics [28]. To achieve any of the objectives of neuromarket-
ing, developing the model to understand the biological and behavioral 
reactions in marketing should be the primary focus. Owing to this, exhib-
iting special consumer vulnerability seems to be important to the success 
of neuromarketing competition [28]. By taking one step ahead, imple-
menting the CN-neuromarketing (or CN-neuroconsumer as an alterna-
tive) offers EEG marketers the opportunity to provide ­specialty in their 
service to the nation. Collaboration among neurologists, psychiatrists, 
and the general medical neuroscientific community may work to achieve 
the target [29].
12.2  Color and Psychology
The visual system has very complex neural circuitry compared to other 
sensory systems. The complexity of the visual system has attracted 
much attention from researchers across multidisciplinary backgrounds 
 

275
EEG-fMRI in Psychiatry, Psychology, and Cultural Neuroscience
including neuroscience, biomedicine, physiology, physics, psychology, 
and economics. One aspect of the visual system that gains attention is 
color vision. We experience color every day in our daily routine and even 
in our dreams. The color experience that we encounter is dependent on 
the amount or spectral composition of the light that reaches the eye and 
the contextual influence. The visibility of the light to human eye can be 
measured by wavelengths ranging from 400 nm to 700 nm. Researches 
in color and ­psychology have revealed new discoveries that shed light on 
how color affects our life and the way we use color, especially in the health 
and clinical ­setting. There are many studies that report color has a signifi-
cant effect on the psychological functioning of an individual. Even though 
much work has been put in to understand the fundamental issues of the 
color visual system, the development of the research remains at an early 
stage [30].
Studies on the color visual system and psychology research are develop-
ing. However, certain challenges are encountered in past studies, which can 
be improved to understand the color visual system holistically. This was dis-
cussed in detail in Ref. [30], which listed a few important points including 
the effect of color to a specific cultural background orientation, the limited 
usage of sampling (limited to only university students), lacking in the aspect 
of variability of color (chroma) used in the experiment [30].
12.2.1  Depression: Color as Biological Marker
Depression is a common and severe mental disorder. From the artistic point 
of view, this disorder is frequently associated and illustrated with certain 
colors like gray and black that evoke the feeling of sadness. Even though this 
association is just an expression of the state of depression in the form of color, 
physiologically there is some evidence of a possible biological link between 
vision and depression.
The current practice of diagnosing depression is based on the symp-
toms listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder (DSM). 
However, the lists of symptoms are rather subjective to some extent, even 
though they have been validated and recognized. Among those symptoms 
are significant weight loss, changes in sleep pattern, and fatigue. Recent 
research on visual science and major depressive disorder (MDD) has pro-
vided an alternative diagnosis method that can support the current practice 
and that is claimed to be more objective [31].
The study was conducted by a group of researchers at the University 
Hospital of Freiburg, Germany and focused on the possibility of a linkage 
between depression and visual contrast [32]. They were measuring cells at the 
retina level, such as photoreceptors, in patients with MDD by using an elec-
troretionogram, which enables the electrical response in the retina cell to be 
recorded and is usually used by the ophthalmologist to detect and diagnose 
retinal disease. This study revealed that, among patients with depression, 
 

276
EEG/ERP Analysis
whether they were on medication or not, there was significant reduction in 
their contrast gain [31]. This indicates a significant link between the visual 
system and depression.
EEG and ERP studies on color and emotion also revealed consistent find-
ings. Different colors were reported to cause significant changes in brain 
waves that resemble the changes of the mood especially in terms of arousal 
(8–13 Hz relaxation state, 15–30 Hz excitation state) [33]. The participants of 
the research were exposed to different colors: green, blue, and red. The color 
stimuli were presented for 1 s at 2 s intervals between the colors [33]. Another 
finding was that different color exposures stimulate different response areas 
and different frequency levels [33]. These recordings were made at the V1, 
V2, and V3 visual areas of the brain. This shows that mood changes caused 
by the color visual experience can be detected by certain patterns of brain 
waves as the biological marker. Therefore, prediction of the emotional state 
can be made based on the color that was seen, which is characterized by 
certain brain waves.
An animal study on color and depression also came up with interesting 
findings. Red light was found to be less depressive compared to the other 
light colors at night [34]. This study was conducted on hamsters, which were 
exposed to four different types of light including blue, red, white, and no 
light. Their behavior and the density of the dendritic spines in the hippo-
campus were analyzed. They reported that red light and no light caused less 
depressive behavior and higher density of the dendritic spines than the blue 
and white light [34].
The foregoing studies are some examples of evidence that major depres-
sive disorders could be detected through the color visual system, which 
serves as a biological marker. The future challenge for this field is to pro-
vide more physiological evidence that contributes to the detection of clini-
cal disorder.
12.2.2  Methodology for Future Predictors of Cognitive State
12.2.2.1  Eye Tracking System
The eye tracking system is one of the well-known methods in the study 
of the cognitive visual system. This method uses the properties of eye 
movement behavior to understand the underlying cognitive process 
involved in respect of certain visual tasks including color visual tasks. 
The ­primary properties of eye movement behavior are the number of fixa-
tions, the duration of fixation time, and the rapid eye movements (sac-
cade) [35]. One of the advantages of using eye movement data is that it is 
a more natural and spontaneous type of interaction with the environment 
and does not require training [35]. The development of eye movement 
studies has helped us to understand the fundamental issues related to 
eye movement in our daily behavior, the role of internal reward, and the 
 

277
EEG-fMRI in Psychiatry, Psychology, and Cultural Neuroscience
development of theoretical advancements in reinforcement learning and 
graphic ­simulation. The latest research has also revealed that by under-
standing eye movement behavior, we are able to predict the individual 
cognitive state [35].
A number of previous studies have reported that eye movement behav-
iors are highly influenced by the experimental visual task engaged in by 
the participant. For instance, reading and viewing a scene have differ-
ent saccade amplitudes and fixation durations. The same situation also 
happens in a visual searching task and a memorizing task [32]. In other 
words, specific visual tasks can determine and influence the behavior of 
eye movements. However, the changes in eye movement behavior during 
a specific task overlaps greatly across different tasks. Therefore, it is hard 
to really identify the task that an individual is engaged in based on the 
eye movement data alone. A proper classification of eye movement data is 
crucial to make sense of the cognitive state involved. Henderson and col-
leagues [35] have proved to some extent that this problem can be overcome 
by proper classification of the eye movement data. In their research [35], 
used multivariate pattern analyses (MVPA) as the method of classification 
in order to understand and predict the task engaged by the participants 
and their cognitive state through their eye movements. The participants 
were asked to complete four different tasks including memorizing, read-
ing, visual searching, and pseudo-reading. Before the process of classifi-
cation is made, some of the data acquired were removed such as fixation 
longer than 1500 ms, and some other eye signal noises such as due to the 
eye blinking. Furthermore, a naïve Bayes classifier was used for each par-
ticipant to capture the eye movement pattern. The result demonstrated 
that eye movement behaviors are significantly dependent on the task 
engaged and the cognitive state.
The classification accuracies reported were highly reliable above chance. 
The same reliability was also obtained by using four eye movement proper-
ties, the means and standard deviation of the saccade amplitude, and the 
duration of fixation [35]. This indicated that different viewing tasks have 
their own features of eye movement based on the four-way classification of 
eye movement [35]. Even though the cognitive state defined in this study 
refers to the viewing task (e.g., skimming, reading, and memorizing), other 
classifications of cognitive states might also be possible, such as confusion 
and inattention [35], which can resemble a more clinical aspect of the cogni-
tive state (e.g., anxiety, depression, phobia, arousal). However, the challenge 
is that a broader classification is needed that is not limited to only the view-
ing task. In order to achieve this goal, comprehensive and continuous eye 
movement recording is needed. The development of the technology of smart 
glass (e.g., Google glass) seems to be promising in this regard. The prototype 
of Google glass recently introduced is a more lightweight product and more 
comfortable for daily wear and this technology fundamentally based on the 
eye tracking system which is dependent on the eye movement behavior [36]. 
 

278
EEG/ERP Analysis
This development may provide a solution for continuous recording and 
­classification to cover a more general cognitive state. Through a comprehen-
sive classification of the cognitive state through eye movement behavior, early 
detection of potential psychological illnesses can be taken into account, pre-
cautions can be taken, and a preventive treatment plan can be implemented. 
This classification should be extended to color-specific stimuli because color 
always has a greater sensitivity to the center of fixation.
12.2.2.2  Imaging Techniques
There is an increased trend of using imaging techniques in color and psy-
chology research to provide physiological evidence of the effect of color on 
psychological functioning. The technique used enables us to understand the 
underlying process in the brain that has been the center of attention of recent 
studies.
Color-related information was found to be processed in the ventral 
temporal lobe in humans and the ventromedial region of the occipi-
tal lobe and the posterior temporal cortex in non-human primates [37]. 
Recently, research on the color of Chinese characters with ERP imaging 
tools detected a strong association with late posterior negativity (LPN) in 
searching, retrieving, and evaluating color objects [38]. This finding was 
in agreement with the earlier finding that the LPN component was associ-
ated with picture color source retrieval. These examples indicate that dif-
ferent techniques or tools used in research might result in different or new 
knowledge on the same subject. It is not a question of right or wrong, but 
just a matter of retrieving the information on the same object from differ-
ent perspectives.
Color has its own property to influence the level of attention. Some colors 
do have a higher degree of attention level, whereas others have a low level 
of attention. This variance of attention intensity in color has an impact on 
our physiological and cognitive system [39]. Chang and Huang [39] used two 
types of visual task (low level and high level of attention) that they defined 
by different colors, and they used EEG to record the brain activity at differ-
ent band waves. They found that theta synchronization in Fz, Cz, and Pz was 
stronger in a high-attention-level task than in a low-attention-level task [39]. 
The high-attention-level task also was found to decrease the LF component 
and LF/HF ratio compared to the low-attention-level task [39]. This indicated 
that variation in the attention level produced by color can induce different 
changes in the brain wave activity.
The combination of these two types of methodologies has huge poten-
tial in scientific color visual research in providing a better understand-
ing of human cognitive and psychological states and functioning. For 
instance, research by Nikolaev, Jurica, Nakatani, Plomp, and Leeuwen 
(2013) on visual encoding and target selection fixation used a combina-
tion of eye movement and EEG recording data and reported fascinating 
 

279
EEG-fMRI in Psychiatry, Psychology, and Cultural Neuroscience
results where they were trying to understand or predict the next fixation 
target in the natural scene by observing presaccadic electrical brain activ-
ity from the EEG [40]. In the near future, it is expected that multidisci-
plinary research and methodologies will gain greater attention in color 
and psychology research.
12.3  EEG/ERP in Psychopathy and Criminal Behavior
An approach to psychopathology that employs neurocognitive endophe-
notypes posits that behavioral and cognitive process abnormalities found 
in most psychiatric disorders are associated with distinct disturbances in 
the brain and neural systems [41]. For instance, the aberrations in affec-
tive functions and behavioral problems found in individuals with psy-
chopathic traits are believed to be correlated with focal brain lesions as 
postulated by the paralimbic system dysfunction model [42]. Prior work 
has demonstrated that ERP provides an excellent window on the brain 
with a very good temporal resolution and is very useful in elucidating 
cognitive mechanisms and neural substrates of a particular event [43]. 
Indeed, ERP components such as P140, P200, error-related negativity 
(ERN), error-positivity (Pe), and P300 are increasingly becoming impor-
tant neurophysiological markers in assessing several aspects (e.g., path-
ological reward sensitivity [44]) of criminal behaviors and other related 
psychiatric disorders.
12.3.1  P140
P140 is an early ERP component of index attentional processing under 
threat-focus conditions. Prior studies highlighted that greater P140 indicates 
superior selective attention. Psychopathy was found to be hypersensitive to 
threat-related stimuli, and there was difficulty in reallocating attention in 
goal-directed behavior. Therefore, this ERP component could be a ­useful 
marker in assessing abnormal threat processing reported in individuals 
with psychopathic traits [45].
12.3.2  P200
P200 is an orbitofrontal ERP marker to reflect attention capture modulation 
and salience detection based on a task relevance item [46–49]. The P200, which 
peaks at about 200 ms after feedback onset, has been found to be associated 
with reward sensitivity [50], and is known as a salience pathway [49] sig-
naling reward and absence of reward [51,52]. Psychopathy has been associ-
ated with impulsivity and novelty-­seeking indices of heightened sensitivity 
 

280
EEG/ERP Analysis
to reward. This ERP component could be a useful marker indexing reward 
sensitivity found in individuals with addictive behaviors [53] and criminal 
behaviors.
12.3.3  Error-Related Negativity/Feedback-Related Negativity
Error-related negativity (ERN) and/or feedback-related negativity (FRN) are 
ERP components reflecting performance monitoring and feedback process-
ing. The ERN is a negative deflection that peaks shortly after an erroneous 
response in speeded performance task, whereas the FRN peaks following 
the presentation of feedback information. These components were found to 
reflect individual learning abilities; they are believed to be generated in the 
anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) of the brain. Previous research on ERN/FRN 
indicated that psychopathy is associated with impaired learning abilities and 
error monitoring [54,55]. Current evidence suggests that the FRN could pos-
sibly assess the pathological reward sensitivity associated with reward-related 
striatal activation [56]. Thus, the FRN could be a significant electrophysiologi-
cal marker for pathological reward sensitivity reported in individuals with 
psychopathic traits.
12.3.4  Error Positivity (Pe)
Post-error positivity (Pe) is a positive deflection that occurs between 100 and 
400 ms after the ERN and is associated with recognition of error. A reduced 
Pe amplitude would indicate that participants are unaware that they have 
committed errors or are unable to identify errors [57–60]. Because previous 
studies highlighted that psychopathy is associated with impaired perfor-
mance monitoring and difficulty in conforming to social norms, the Pe could 
be a useful component for assessing deficits in awareness among psycho-
paths while they commit errors.
12.3.5  P300
The P300 amplitude is a positive ERP deflection that peaks between 300 and 
600 ms post-onset feedback. This ERP component is elicited by novel and 
salient stimuli associated with attention and orienting processes [61] and to 
high-level motivational evaluation [62]. Mixed findings concerning the P300 
amplitude and psychopathy using different paradigms (e.g., oddball task) 
are reported in the field [42]. Despite the inconsistent results with regard 
to smaller or larger P300 amplitudes, most studies highlighted a differ-
ent scale in the assessment of psychopathic traits (e.g., PCL-R, TriPM) and 
yielded different P300 results depending on the target stimuli. Therefore, 
future research with regard to the P300 amplitude is needed because this 
component is useful to identify deficiencies or abnormalities in attention and 
orienting processes found in psychopathy.

12.4  EEG/ERP and EEG-fMRI in Rehabilitation for 
Developmental and Psychological Disorders
12.4.1  Specific Language Impairment
ERPs may guide researchers in describing phonological processing’s role 
in language comprehension and speech production. The influence of lexi-
cal processing on sentences would be very important in setting the baseline 
and tracking the progress during rehabilitation for children with a specific 
language impairment [63].
12.4.2  Cerebral Palsy
The future use of EEG would move from the traditional concept to portable 
EEG, which is suitable for measuring brain waves during active movement 
such as walking, driving, and speaking. During physical therapy for children 
with cerebral palsy, portable EEG would be able to capture real-time data 
with better time resolution. Clinicians will be able to localize cortical electri-
cal activation areas in probing neuroplastic changes associated with motor 
recovery during and after rehabilitation training. Real-time cortical activation 
neurofeedback could be the basis for facilitating motor imagery training in 
the course of neurorehabilitation for children with cerebral palsy [64].
12.4.3  Autism Spectrum Disorders
In children with autism, neurofeedback training could be targeted to improve 
executive functions in connectivity-guided neurofeedback by remediating 
connectivity disturbances. Researchers have found that significant improve-
ments were noted in attentional control and cognitive flexibility in children 
with autism by increasing slow wave brain activity. Changes in qEEG could 
be seen as improvements in set-shifting, reciprocal social interactions, and 
communication skills in children with autism [65].
12.4.4  Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD)
Neurofeedback training using qEEG could be an alternative advancement 
in reducing obsession thoughts and compulsive behaviors among patients 
with OCD. The mechanism modifies brain function and improves clinical 
symptoms by decreasing obsession and compulsion behaviors. Different 
EEG waves could be discriminated by the patients by identifying alpha 
or beta waves in various triggers in the treatment program. Learning to 
associate the desired EEG patterns and learning to dissociate unwanted 
EEG patterns could be part of the treatment modules in rehabilitation 
­processes [66].

EEG/ERP Analysis
13.1  Introduction
The applications of electroencephalography (EEG) in combination with event-
related potential (ERP) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) 
are gaining importance in the field of both social neurosciences as well as 
medical neurosciences. The current research on resting-state brain networks 
looks into the science of activation of different brain and the rise and fall in 
synchronicity while the brain is assumed to be at rest. Many neuroscientists 
used fMRI to locate, characterize, and analyze data received from these net-
works. Unfortunately, a disadvantage is the relative slowness of fMRI, which 
is limited to the data collection of activities that change every 10 s [1]. Another 
disadvantage is that the data from fMRI shows that the spatial and topo-
graphical pattern of activity is similar at rest and while performing tasks [1].
A more cost-effective and robust method is magnetoencephalography 
(MEG), which detects activities at millisecond levels, recording waves of 
activity at frequencies from slow (0.1–4 Hz) to fast (greater than 50 Hz). 
The  value of the EEG in medical neurosciences after one has studied its 
effects in fMRI is the robustness, time saving, and patient friendliness, espe-
cially for the younger age group.
This technology is used for prognostication, treatment, rehabilitation, and 
most importantly as an electrical biomarker for physicians both in the acute 
setting in intensive care units, sub-acute settings for use in high dependency 
wards, and later for rehabilitation in acute neurological emergencies. It is used 
in developmental behavior disorders such as autism and dyslexia as well as in 
psychological and psychiatric conditions such as stress, anxiety neurosis, and 
psychosis as an objective method of following up a patient in a clinical setting.
Stroke and traumatic brain injury management both in the acute setting 
and in the rehabilitation phase makes this an important tool for the future. 
The classical use of this technology coupled with MEG and fMRI for both 
applied therapy in the field of epilepsy treatment and follow-up will make it 
useful both at tertiary- and secondary-level hospitals.
EEG holds great promise for the study of brain activity. Obvious advan-
tages compared to MEG, which is also capable in studying brain waves, are: 
(1) hardware costs are lower, (2) the scalp EEG is noninvasive and cheap, 
while intracranial EEG (iEEG or ECoG) offers higher temporal and spatial 
resolutions than EEG. These two advantages enable EEG technology to be 
widely used to study brain activities in two major circumstances: (1) without 
craniotomy (healthy subjects and patients) and (2) with craniotomy or burr 
holes (patients). Therefore, the future aspects of clinical applications using 
EEG can be classified based on these two considerations.
Regarding EEG and its combination with other techniques, the two most 
widely used combinations nowadays are fMRI-EEG [2–5] and MEG-EEG [6,7]. 
The current clinical applications using these combinations are mainly focused 
on epilepsy [8–10]. In our opinion, wider clinical application is likely in the 
 

289
Use of EEG, ERP, EEG/MEG, and EEG-fMRI
near future if we gain better knowledge in ­understanding and mapping brain 
waves. Similar to genetic coding (a frontier in the 20th century), which gives 
rise to heterogeneous and complex phenotypical manifestations, brain waves 
and rhythms are similarly viewed as being able to contribute to a myriad of 
diverging brain functions (a frontier for the 21st century). Therefore, one of 
the areas that is in need of vigorous exploration in future is understanding 
brain waves and their significance (or codes).
13.2  Two Main Aspects of Future EEG: Brain Waves 
and Their Maps, and EEG Technology
The future aspects of clinical applications using EEG may evolve together 
with advances in two important areas of EEG: (1) a better understanding of 
brain waves recorded by EEG and (2) advances in EEG technology itself.
13.2.1  Brain Waves and Their Maps
There are five major brain waves distinguished by their different frequen-
cies, ranging from high to low: gamma (above 30 Hz), beta (13–30 Hz), alpha 
(8–13 Hz), theta (4–8 Hz), and delta (0.1–4 Hz). Some basic and salient points 
regarding the brain waves are as follows [11,12]:
	
1.	Hertz is a unit of frequency that equals cycles per second.
	
2.	Slow waves are waves with frequencies less than 8 Hz, which include 
theta and delta waves.
	
3.	Focal slow wave activity indicates focal neuronal damage.
	
4.	Delta waves are primarily associated with deep sleep and may also 
be present in the waking state.
	
5.	Theta waves are presumed to originate from the thalamus. They 
appear as consciousness slips toward drowsiness. Theta waves have 
been associated with deep meditation, creative inspiration, and 
unconscious material. They are often accompanied by other frequen-
cies and seemed to be related to the level of arousal. They also play 
an important role in infancy and childhood.
	
6.	Larger amount of theta waves in a waking adult are abnormal and 
are caused by various pathological problems.
	
7.	Alpha waves appear in the posterior half of the head and are usu-
ally found over the parieto-occipital region of the brain. They can be 
detected in all parts of the posterior lobe of the brain. They may appear 
as round, sinusoidal, or sometimes as sharp waves. Alpha waves could 
 

290
EEG/ERP Analysis
indicate a relaxed awareness without any attention or ­concentration. 
It is the most prominent rhythm in brain activity.
	
8.	Alpha waves have higher amplitudes in the occipital region.
	
9.	Beta waves are the usual waking rhythm of the brain associated with 
active thinking, active attention, focusing on the outside world, or solv-
ing concrete problems and are found in normal adults mainly in the 
frontal region. A panic state may also induce a high level of beta waves.
	 10.	Rhythmical beta activity is encountered chiefly over the frontal and 
central regions.
	 11.	Fast beta waves or gamma waves have low amplitude, and their 
occurrence is rare. Detection of these waves can be used for confir-
mation of certain brain diseases.
	 12.	Gamma waves are also a good indicator of event-related synchroni-
zation of the brain and can be used to demonstrate the locus for right 
and left index finger movement, right toes, and tongue movement 
(Figure 13.1).
	 13.	Waves with frequency higher than 300 Hz have been found in cer-
ebellar structures.

Use of EEG, ERP, EEG/MEG, and EEG-fMRI
	 14.	Bilateral persistent EEG (burst of seizure activity/ictal wave pattern/
spikes/polyspikes) is usually associated with impaired conscious 
cerebral reaction.
	 15.	Focal persistent EEG (burst of seizure activity/ictal wave pattern/
spikes/polyspikes) or epileptiform discharges are either interictal 
(seen between seizures episodes) or ictal (seen during acute seizure 
episode) and manifest in either spikes or sharp wave form, which is 
typically followed by a slow wave. It is usually associated with focal 
cerebral disturbance such as a seizure.
The future clinical applications of EEG obviously depend on our under-
standing of brain waves. Besides the morphological aspects of brain waves 
briefly mentioned already, future mapping of brain waves with certain 
human behaviors and activities undoubtedly seem crucial to gain an insight 
into how the brain works (Figure  13.2). The information gained from this

EEG/ERP Analysis
“brain-waves–human-activities map” can be used in various sectors such as 
clinical, military, robotic, or communications technology. Mapping of the brain 
waves should ideally be first obtained via iEEG because of its current high sig-
nal resolution. Hopefully, in the near future, with advances in EEG technol-
ogy, high-resolution EEG signals will be directly obtained via the scalp EEG 
and thus the three major drawbacks of the iEEG technique will be overcome: 
(1) invasiveness, (2) restricted sampling area, and (3) mostly applied to the dis-
eased brain. Therefore, the prudent conclusion is that collateral development in 
EEG technology as well as better understanding of brain waves are required to 
completely and reliably map the brain waves with human activities.
13.2.2  EEG Technology
We may expect to see big changes in the field of EEG in the coming years. 
EEG technology is currently widely used in two main situations: (1) with 
surgery that normally requires a craniotomy or burr hole and (2) without 
surgery. Therefore, improvements in EEG technology can be separately dis-
cussed based on these two main classifications.
13.2.2.1  EEG Technology without Surgery (Noninvasive or Scalp EEG)
In order to gain a better understanding of brain activities, EEG technology 
should be able to explore the short-lived spatiotemporal dynamics of many 
of the underlying brain processes. This is currently possible only with iEEG 
(ECoG). Intraoperative EEG provides brain signals that have an exceptionally 
high signal-to-noise ratio, less susceptibility to artifacts than current scalp 
EEG, and have a high spatial and temporal resolution (i.e., <1 cm and <1 ms, 
respectively). Therefore, the current scalp EEG should be improved in terms 
of (1) higher signal resolution and (2) greater reliability and convenience.
Because there is bone and dura covering the brain, higher signal resolution 
for scalp EEG can be achieved by modifying the number of electrodes, the elec-
trode contact and sensor, recording system such as the amplifier and filter, and 
wireless system. The future EEG should make the numbers higher in order to 
sample nearly all areas of the brain. Currently, EEG channels are commonly 
available in 16, 32, and 64 channels, but lately EEG with 256 channels is available

Sensor Net, EGI Inc, Eugene, Oregon, USA). Dry electrode contact and wire-
less system are already in the market (Mindo, Contec, etc.) [13,14]. Certainly, 
improvements in EEG sensor and recording technology would improve the 
prospects for the technology. Nanotechnology may change many aspects of 
EEG technology, for example, if “each” electrode sensor is fitted with a nano-
amplifier system [15]. The greater the use of miniaturized and more sensitive 
materials for sensors, the higher the number of electrode sensors and signal 
detection that can be made. With advances in signal processing, the short-lived 
brain signals that are normally obtained via iEEG can be obtained via scalp EEG.

13.2.2.2  EEG Technology with Surgery (Intracranial EEG)
The brain wave signals obtained via iEEG are regarded as a gold standard 
for EEG analysis, mainly because of their high signal-to-noise ratio, reduced 
susceptibility to artifacts, and high spatial and temporal resolution. Further 
advances are likely to be similar to those for scalp EEG: improvement in sensors 
and their numbers, recordings, as well as signal analysis systems. The current 
frontier in this technology is a high-density microelectrode array iEEG system 
(hdMEA) [16], which has been manufactured and utilized only at the research 
level. Through this technology, researchers are able to identify high-frequency 
pathological oscillations localized to sub-millimeter scale tissue volumes and 
hence can diagnose subclinical seizures and localize the microdischarges.
13.2.2.3  Other Technologies
Besides the aforementioned advances and developments in scalp and iEEG, 
future EEG systems should also be able to not only record brain waves but 
also be capable of generating them via neural stimulation. The improvement 
should be made to enable scalp EEG to also be used as a brain waves generator 
without causing significant side effects to the person. Another advance is the 
EEG-cap system, which can be modified to tailor a site for craniotomy, espe-
cially during awake surgery with subdural EEG electrodes in situ and sterile 
scalp EEG electrodes at a non-craniotomy site. By having these technologies 
in place, brain waves and their relationship with human activities (in normal 
and diseased person) can easily be studied, and neural signals can be mapped.
13.3  The Future Aspects of Clinical Applications Using EEG
With better understanding of, and future advances in, EEG technology as 
described earlier, the clinical applications of EEG will expand, and the exist-
ing clinical applications can be made more refined to increase the expected 
yield. The future aspects of clinical applications using EEG can be classified 
into the following categories.
13.3.1  Noninvasive Mapping and Creation 
of Ideal Networks for the Brain
Anatomical mapping using MRI-DTI technology and brain atlas has been 
started and continues to evolve [17]. EEG technology may enhance those 
mapping processes and possibly create a human anatomical-brain-waves-
activities map. This map incorporates brain anatomy and brain waves that 
correlate to human activities. Together with future developments in molecu-
lar imaging and genetics, additional brain-molecular/genetic mappings can 
 

294
EEG/ERP Analysis
be incorporated to the anatomical-brain-waves–activity map and create an 
ideal brain map inclusive of anatomy (gray and white matter, atlas), molecu-
lar profiles (dopamine, acethycholine, noradrenaline, serotonin), genetic pro-
files, brain waves and rhythms, and human activity.
13.3.2  Brain–Computer Interface and Robotic Technology
Brain–computer interface (BCI) is a promising medical–engineering–­computer 
technology advancement. It is currently being widely investigated for various 
applications [18–21]. By having a normal and complete brain map for human 
brain activities, one can use these data to enhance the brain–­computer ­interface 
or brain–prosthetic interface technology. With advances in EEG ­technology and 
the availability of normal network templates for certain brain activities, a shorter 
training time in obtaining the right brain waves for certain human activities can 
be achieved. A human-like robot is another possibility. A complete understand-
ing of brain networks may allow scientists to create an “­electronic brain,” which 
could be used to create a human-like skillful robot. With this achievement, the 
robots can be used to perform surgery and to rehabilitate patients at hospital or 
at home (Figure 13.3).

13.3.3  Diagnosis and Monitoring
Epilepsy is one of the diseases that can be diagnosed based on the EEG. 
With developments in EEG technology (noninvasive techniques with high 
signal resolution, etc.) and a better understanding of brain signals and their 
analysis, other clinical diagnoses can be reliably and accurately made. These 
include stroke, brain tumors, and viral infections. The use of EEG to con-
tinuously monitor patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) has already been 
implemented [22,23], and further refinements in EEG technology and brain 
waves may give the intensivists and scientists the opportunity to study 
­consciousness and sleep in wider contexts and correlate them with diseases. 
Besides studying consciousness, intensivists can achieve a better under-
standing of brain functions when they have a universal monitoring system 
that incorporates all important brain parameters. The ICU-EEG machine 
should have wireless capability, a high signal-to-noise ratio with good spa-
tial and temporal resolution, scalp EEG system together with intracranial 
pressure waves, and blood flow and oxygenation parameters, all of which 
can be analyzed at the bedside. The availability of such technology will cer-
tainly improve the care of critical patients (Figure 13.4).
13.3.4  Therapy
Implanted EEG to detect abnormal electrical discharges prior to seizures 
has been developed [24]. This therapy can possibly be improved to avoid 
the implantation surgery, by the wearing of an EEG cap. The detected EEG 
waves can also be transferred telemetrically to the epilepsy treating center, 
and hence further advice can be given. Neuromodulation plays a significant

role in treating some neurological diseases such as Parkinson’s, dystonia, 
tremors, pain, and depression. With the availability of a high signal-to-noise 
ratio for scalp EEG, the brain waves can be studied during deep-seated brain 
anatomical stimulation. The data obtained can be used to find ways to mod-
ulate their identified networks superficially and treat accordingly with neu-
ral stimulation (implanted superficial EEG or cap EEG) without requiring 
deep brain stimulation surgery. EEG and pharmacotherapy for brain dis-
eases is obviously interesting, and clinicians and pharmacologists may learn 
enough about the brain mechanism to discriminate effective or ineffective 
drug therapy and identify brain wave biomarkers for certain disorders.
13.3.5  Neurofeedback and Neurocognition
Neurofeedback or EEG biofeedback is an EEG operant-conditioning train-
ing technique that helps individuals learn to control or modify their brain 
activity. It is used to treat a variety of conditions such as attention deficit 
hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, addictions, and epilepsy [25–29]. The person 
has to be trained to produce certain features of brain waves that fundamen-
tally has been shown to correspond to certain beneficial cognitive or clinical 
outcomes. Wider application in fields of learning disabilities, schizophrenia, 
dementia, depression, and brain injury is likely with the advances in EEG 
technology and a better understanding of brain waves and rhythms.
13.4  Future of fMRI-EEG and Its Clinical Applications
EEG technology has evolved from its single acquisition method to comple-
mentary methods of measuring brain activity. The simultaneous acquisition 
of EEG and other functional neuroimaging such as fMRI and MEG are now 
increasingly available after crucial technical challenges have been met in 
terms of amplifier systems, biocompatible EEG systems, and correction of 
scanner-related artifacts in the EEG (Figures 13.5a and 13.5b). By combin-
ing EEG with fMRI, the clinician can confidently interpret the EEG findings 
and spatially map the area of interest. Currently, such advantages have been 
widely used in managing epilepsy [30–32]. Obviously, with the advances 
in scalp EEG, signal detection, and analysis, the information provided by 
simultaneous fMRI-EEG can be used to study brain networks and cognition.
With the great advantages of EEG, in the near future we may see a 
­“universal” machine incorporating EEG and other neuroimaging techniques 
(Figure 13.5c). Ideally, the EEG sensors should have already been incorpo-
rated inside those neuroimaging techniques without the need for the techni-
cian to attach them to the head (just like the gamma knife head system used 
in radiosurgery).

13.5  Future of EEG-MEG and Its Clinical Applications
The usage of interpretation of brain signals in neurorehabilitation applica-
tions has gained attention over the recent years. This is a rapidly emerg-
ing field of brain research which involves multidisciplinary research on the 
brain with computer interfaces (BCI) [33]. The current advance researches 
in brain signals analysis, noninvasive EEG with brain–computer interface 
(BCI) technologies, have been used to manage a computer cursor or a limb 
orthosis, forward processing and accessing the Internet, and for other func-
tions including environmental control or entertainment. BCI technologies 
have improved the lifestyle of people suffering from advanced amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis (ALS) [34].
The research and development of BCI is a multidisciplinary effort involv-
ing researchers from different backgrounds, and they are still looking 
forward to creating and inventing new technologies allowing for precise, 
relevant diagnosis and effective treatment. MEG has recently been proposed 
as a potential new source of brain-derived signals to operate with BCI. MEG 
is a noninvasive method that is able to detect frequency ranges above those 
available in EEG recordings with higher spatial resolution [35]. The combina-
tion of EEG-MEG and brain interfaces is regarded as another breakthrough 
within the relatively novel but rapid developing BCI technology. The signals 
from the computer interfaces of EEG-MEG generate reliable self-control of 
sensorimotor rhythm amplitude and satisfactory two-dimensional BCI con-
trol in the rehabilitation process of stroke patients [35,36].

EEG/ERP Analysis
The combination of EEG-MEG with BCI currently requires huge and 
­expensive equipment housed in a safe environment. Future research and 
development of cryogen-free solutions such as the spin exchange relaxation-
free (SERF) magnetometer, which is operated in a closed nonmagnetic field, 
can make this combination of modalities practical for widespread clinical 
use [37]. Reconstruction of models of EEG, MEG, and fMRI signal generation 
based on computational neuroscience is a possible application for patients 
in neurorehabilitation. These models may help achieve a deeper under-
standing of complex brain processes associated with particular functions. 
Further understanding of individually shaped features of brain processes 
and ­signals may be possible [37].
However, a patient with sensory and motor cortex impairment due to 
cerebral palsy might not be able to use BCIs with EEG or single-neuron 
activity from this cortical area. The application of ERP P300 component 
with the BCI system in other brain areas of interest might be excellent alter-
natives [35].
13.6  Clinical Use of EEG/EEG Monitoring, 
ERP, and EEG-fMRI in Epilepsy
The sensitivity of EEG is valuable for detecting spikes in epilepsy. EEG is 
an important tool for accurately identifying the ictal onset zone that gener-
ates interictal sharp waves or spikes [38]. By using scalp EEG tracings in 
a 10-20 system, clinicians/neurologists can recognize the type of epilepsy 
with visual analysis, which is important in an emergency. Additional T1/T2 
electrodes in a 10-20 system are helpful for recognizing the ictal area accu-
rately to avoid misdiagnosis or mistreatment. Therefore, EEG has diagnos-
tic value for the clinicians/neurologists if additional T1 and T2 electrodes 
are used in a 10-20 system. As EEG is sensitive to activities from both the 
fissure and the gyrus, it may reveal multiple neuronal generators of elec-
trical activity [39]. Some data appear to provide curious clinical evidence 
that spikes tangential to the scalp might be less apparent or undetected by 
scalp EEG [40]. As there have been both failures [41] and successes [42] in 
recording insular spikes, it is highly recommended to use simultaneous 
EEG-MEG to detect spikes in deeply set regions. The simultaneous EEG-
MEG technique can detect insular spikes as MEG is exclusively sensitive 
to activities from the fissure cortex [39]. It is important to compare the sen-
sitivity between MEG and intracranial recording using electrocorticogra-
phy (ECoG). It was reported in Ref. [43] that all MEG spikes were observed 
with ECoG, but 56% of interictal ECoG spikes had a MEG counterpart [43]. 
They found that spike detectability varied according to the anatomical 
region; detectability was greatest in the orbitofrontal and interhemispheric 
 

299
Use of EEG, ERP, EEG/MEG, and EEG-fMRI
regions (>90%), followed by the superior frontal, central, and lateral 
­temporal regions (<75%), with mesial temporal spikes being the most diffi-
cult to detect (<25%). In Ref. [44], spike detectability was compared between 
stereostetic-EEG (SEEG) and MEG in one patient with occipital epilepsy 
and three patients with mesial temporal epilepsy. They reported that 95% 
of all interictal SEEG spikes had a MEG counterpart in the occipital case, 
while only 25 to 60% of all SEEG spikes had a MEG correlate in the mesial 
temporal cases [44].
Conventional EEG analysis is not adequate to recognize the irritative 
region and the ictal onset zone in the case of epilepsy surgery evaluation. 
Therefore, EEG source imaging (ESI) has been developed with compu-
tational techniques that can depict the presumed source of EEG activity. 
Clinical use of ESI in the past two decades has been highly successful. The 
ESI process will enhance the utility of ESI in the presurgical investigation 
of patients with refractory focal epilepsy [38]. At the time of localization of 
the ictal zone by ESI, it is necessary to define seizures accurately. Video-
EEG monitoring is a good biomarker for the clinician in such cases. On the 
other hand, for the proper management of seizures in infancy, especially in 
some clinically generalized seizures, video-EEG monitoring is still popular 
among clinicians [45], and its utility and safety cannot be ignored in pedi-
atric patients [46].
Over the last decade, epilepsy surgery has improved, though non-­seizure-
free outcomes in patients do occur. The major causes of ­non-seizure-free 
outcomes have been identified, and incomplete or ­nonresection of unrec-
ognized seizure foci usually results in ­unfavorable seizure control [47]. 
Accurate localization of the epileptic foci is an ­important factor for good sur-
gical outcomes, but it remains a challenge, especially for extra temporal lobe 
epilepsy (ETLE) and nonlesional ­epilepsy, which employ normal magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI). ­EEG-fMRI makes it possible to discover the pos-
sible generators of interictal epileptiform ­discharges (IEDs) [4] and identify 
the accurate ictal location for diagnosis and further prognosis of epileptic 
patients. There is clinical value in detecting the ­irritating zone (IZ) with the 
EEG-fMRI technique in the presurgical evaluation of epilepsy, and EEG-
fMRI often identifies scattered interictal spiking in epileptic patients who 
have frequent IEDs [48–50]. Zijlmans et al. [51] have convincingly demon-
strated that EEG-fMRI could improve source localization and corroborate a 
negative conclusion concerning surgical candidacy in complex clinical cases 
(with either unclear focus or multifocality), and EEG-fMRI is a valuable tool 
in presurgical evaluation [51].
Though ERP is not frequently used in epilepsy patients for diagnosis, it 
can be helpful for cognitive function assessment as epilepsy can decrease 
cognitive function [52].
Therefore, scalp EEG of a 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 elec-
trodes, video-EEG monitoring, ERP, MEG, and EEG-fMRI are the most valu-
able biomarkers for epilepsy patients.

EEG/ERP Analysis
13.7  Clinical Use of EEG/qEEG, ERP, and EEG-fMRI 
in Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)
While EEG is more suitable and much more cost effective than the gold 
­standard imaging modalities, EEG data play a vital role in studying the sever-
ity of injury of TBI patients, level of awareness, and unconsciousness, and to 
predict patients’ outcome. Differentiating cognitive deficits due to TBI is more 
challenging than developing EEG methods. Quantitative EEG (qEEG) is more 
useful for that purpose because it employs quantitative techniques to analyze 
EEG characteristics over time independently or in combination [53]. For diag-
nosis and for assessing the prognosis of mild TBI (mTBI), including the likeli-
hood of its progressing to the post-concussive syndrome (PCS) phase, qEEG 
is a unique method [54]. Similar to qEEG, ERP is also important to assess the 
prognosis of mTBI. It is true that TBI is a significant risk factor for post-injury 
neuropsychiatric disorders. ERP component properties (e.g., timing, amplitude, 
latencies, and scalp distribution) are good indicators for detecting the severity 
of injury. Moreover, the complex relationships between brain injury and psy-
chiatric disorders are receiving increased research attention, and ERP tech-
nologies are aiding this effort [55]. Diagnosis and prognosis in moderate and 
severe TBI using conventional imaging techniques is informative [56], but these 
techniques fail to detect the majority of mild brain injuries and provide little or 
no pathophysiological information related to the injury mechanism [57]. The 
prognostic importance of ERP is high as revealed previously that high educa-
tion group had higher cognitive functions (examined by the P300 component) 
in compare to low education group [58, Figure 13.6], Therefore, ERP should be 
an important biomarker for prognosis of TBI for the clinicians.
EEG-fMRI coregistration and high-density EEG (hdEEG) can be ­combined 
to map noninvasively abnormal brain activation elicited by epileptic pro-
cesses. Recently, these two different methods have become very popular to 
focus on the same epileptic area to map abnormal brain activation in patients 
with post-TBI [59]. For effective diagnosis of TBI, Tsallis entropy-based 
analysis of scalp EEG data has an important role as a noninvasive method. 
For indexing cognitive deficits due to neurological disorders, this method 
plays the role of a biomarker in other clinical applications [60].
13.8  Future Clinical Application of EEG/ERP in Stroke
A stroke is a cerebrovascular disease occurring when a focal deficit of brain 
function occurs owing to the interruption of blood supply to the brain 
tissues. Strokes can be categorized into two main forms: one is ischemic, 
which is related to the obstruction of a blood vessel supplying the brain, 
 

301
Use of EEG, ERP, EEG/MEG, and EEG-fMRI
and the other form is hemorrhagic, which is connected with bleeding into 
or around the brain tissue. Hemiplegia is a common disability, a complete 
paralysis on one side of the body due to a stroke. A one-sided weakness or 
hemiparesis, which is not as severe as hemiplegia, may occur due to a stroke. 
There are several stroke risk factors that are not fixed, such as high blood 
pressure, heart disease, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, obesity, smoking, 
excessive alcohol consumption, etc.
In order to identify the underlying vascular disease and the nature of the 
lesion, an electrocardiogram (ECG) and brain imaging are used. In order 
to identify the common vascular risk factors and biomarkers, simple blood 
tests are done initially after a stroke. Genetic testing or counseling can also 
identify the stroke risk factors. However, the use of EEG, which monitors 
brain electrical activity through the skull, for stroke risk factor analysis is

limited. Future clinical applications of EEG for predicting stroke risk factors 
on the basis of current research will be discussed here. One of the stroke risk 
factors, alcoholism, has been linked with a candidate gene SGIP1, which has 
an association with the EEG theta band power [61] as an end phenotype of 
alcoholism in the Plains Indians.
Although this study was not replicated using a genome-wide association 
study in a large but different group of European and/or African ancestry [62]. 
Another study showed the association between genetic variants in SGIP1 
and obesity-related traits in humans [63]. On the other hand Ref. [64], has 
documented that abnormal cortical neural synchronization and desynchro-
nization of alpha rhythms are related to healthy obese subjects [65]. We may 
expect that the qualitative and quantitative EEG findings together with the 
genome-wide association study in stroke patients may provide some valu-
able information in future.
EEG is hardly utilized in the diagnosis of stroke, but the prognostic value 
of EEG remains in an early stage. However, ambulatory EEG (AEEG) is valu-
able for early diagnosis of progressive stroke. The detective rate of progressive 
stroke with AEEG is comparatively high and is especially higher than CT in 
the early period of a stroke [66]. qEEG parameters such as pairwise derived 
brain symmetry index, (delta plus theta) or (alpha plus beta) ratio [67], and 
EEG phase synchronization [68] were associated with the functional out-
come score of stroke patients, which is pertinent to proficient management. 
In order to predict cognitive and motor performance in patients with isch-
emic stroke, one study assesses resting-state functional connectivity (FC) 
with EEG and relates the observed topography of FC to cognitive and motor 
deficits in stroke patients [69].
ERP is not utilized in the diagnosis of stroke, but some comorbidities such 
as cognitive impairment and depression are common in stroke survivors. 
One study suggests that abnormal serum apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which is 
associated with some diseases with cognitive function defect, can be a useful 
biomarker together with abnormalities in some ERP components to assess 
post-stroke depression risk and clinical diagnosis [70].
The contribution of EEG and ERP in stroke rehabilitation is becoming signif-
icant. Translating thoughts into functional movements, which is the result of 
the integration of neural and muscular components of motor control through 
BCI, would play a potential role to allow people with brain and spinal cord 
injuries to live more independent lives in future. In this brain–machine or 
brain–computer interface, researchers need to record the brain electrical activ-
ities related to specific tasks from scalp or implanted sensors near the motor 
cortex of subjects paralyzed from a stroke, as an example. The neuronal fir-
ing patterns are recorded by the computer during imagery movements of the 
patients and later translated to the movement of a device, cursor, or prosthetic 
limb when the patients think of moving their hands to grasp some objects.
Clinical application of this type of EEG or ECoG based brain–machine inter-
face for the neuro-rehabilitation in disabilities from neurological disorders, most 
 

303
Use of EEG, ERP, EEG/MEG, and EEG-fMRI
commonly in strokes, has great value in future studies. An ­electrophysiologic 
brain–computer interface system can be based on the following three systems: 
scalp recorded EEG, ECoG, and intracortical recording [71]. The most studied 
signal is the scalp EEG, which is noninvasive and easy to record, but the spatial 
resolution is poor. Sensory motor rhythms and evoked-potential-based P300 
speller have been used. ECoG activity is recorded from the cortical surface, 
which is less invasive and uses higher-frequency brain activity. Implanted 
intracortical microelectrodes, which are invasive in nature, are used to control 
neuroprosthetic limb in patients with tetraplegia [72]. One interesting future 
direction of BCI technology is mentioned in C.L. Eric’s [73] editorial about the 
sites of ECoG recording, ipsilateral cortex which is also encode complex motor 
kinematics may contribute to control neuroprosthetic through transcallosal 
inhibition in stroke-induced hemiparesis. Besides BCI guided by the brain’s 
electrical and magnetic field activity, there is limited use of fMRI and near-
infrared imaging techniques for controlling BCI systems. However, simultane-
ous fMRI-EEG recording techniques to control BCI systems are not used, which 
may be a potential procedure to guide prosthetic limbs in the future.
13.9  Neurofeedback as a Future Aspect of fMRI-EEG
Neurofeedback (NFB) is a BCI technique that allows subjects to learn how 
to volitionally influence the neuronal activation in the brain. The principle 
behind NFB training, in general, is that brain activity is self-modifiable 
through operant conditioning where the subjects are provided with feed-
back about ongoing neuronal activation with the goal of regulating it, and 
a “reward” is given should a certain level of activity be achieved. NFB can 
be implemented using various neuroimaging modalities such as EEG, fMRI, 
and functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS).
This volitional control of defined aspects of the central nervous system was 
successfully implemented at first using EEG, whereby healthy subjects learn 
to control their electric brain activity. The temporal resolution of EEG (in mil-
liseconds) allows for monitoring of the brain electrical activity in real time.
Various EEG-NFB training protocols (as reviewed in Ref. [74]) that have been 
used to target various clinical conditions: beta/sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) 
in epileptic disorders [75], alpha-theta EEG in substance use ­disorder [76], 
slow cortical potential (SCP) and theta/beta in attention deficit hyperactivity 
disorder [77], and alpha asymmetry in depressive disorders [78]. EEG-NFB 
has a long history and has been effectively established as an alternative ther-
apy to treat certain clinical conditions. However, EEG-NFB has the drawback 
of not being able to access the deeper subcortical regions such as the basal 
ganglia and the amygdala, which are often implicated in neuropsychiatric 
diseases.
 

304
EEG/ERP Analysis
This is where fMRI-NFB shows potential. In comparison to EEG, fMRI-
NFB can offer a higher spatial resolution; therefore, subcortical brain areas 
could be targeted. fMRI measures the blood oxygenation level dependent 
(BOLD) response, that is, signal differences due to local changes in the con-
centration of deoxygenated hemoglobin in the brain tissue that depends on 
neuronal metabolism and activity. Advances in real-time fMRI, which was 
first envisioned two decades ago [78], have now led to the development of 
fMRI-NFB, which relies on providing feedback of the brain activity in real 
time. In fMRI-NFB, subjects try to achieve voluntary control of BOLD activ-
ity from a defined brain region, from a network of interest. Although start-
ing to gain a foothold as an alternative treatment, fMRI-NFB is still mainly 
a research tool, whereas EEG-NFB makes up the majority of NFB therapy in 
the clinics due to EEG’s lower cost and better availability [79].
EEG-NFB and fMRI-NFB can be viewed as complementary to each other. 
In fact, these two techniques have been combined in a recent study as a proof 
of concept of real-time EEG-fMRI NFB in which the subjects wear an EEG 
cap inside the MRI scanner, and EEG recordings are performed in ­parallel 
with fMRI data acquisition [80,81]. The integration of simultaneous EEG-
fMRI NFB provides the best of both worlds by measuring the electric and 
metabolic neuronal activity concurrently, yielding information about when 
and where neural activity occurs. Although this novel system is still in its 
infancy, it is certainly promising in the field of NFB.
