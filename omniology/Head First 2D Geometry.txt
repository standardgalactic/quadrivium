the 
authors 
L i n d s e y Fallow is a self-confessed geek who 
has spent the past decade exploring science and 
technology as a writer, software developer, and 
TV presenter. 
After earning her undergraduate degree in 
manufacturing engineering, she fronted a science 
show for 8-12-year-olds on Disney, and went on 
to become a reporter and associate producer for 
Tomorrow's World (the BBC's #1 prime-time UK 
science and technology show) from 1998-2002. 
She's stood on the top of the Golden Gate bridge, 
fed sharks, filmed brain surgery, flown in military 
planes, and been bitten by a baby tiger, but is the 
most excited by far when her 14-year-old stepson 
"gets" his math homework. 
She is an avid fan of the Head First series and 
can't quite believe she's actually written one. 
Lindz claims that if she were a superhero, her 
superpower would be tesselating. When she's not 
working, she likes to spend time with her super-
lovely partner Helen, dabble in sheep farming, 
play with her boxer dog, Ruby, rock the drums on 
Guitar Hero, and walk in the wilderness. 
Dawn Griffiths started life as a 
mathematician at a top UK university where 
she was awarded a first-class honours degree in 
mathematics. She went on to pursue a career 
in software development, and she currently 
combines IT consultancy with writing, editing, 
and mathematics. 
Dawn is the author of Head First Statistics, and has 
also worked on a host of other books in the series, 
from Networking to Programming. 
When Dawn's not working on Head First books, 
you'll find her honing her Tai Chi skills, making 
bobbin lace, or cooking. She hasn't yet mastered 
the art of doing all three at the same time. She 
also enjoys traveling, and spending time with her 
wonderful husband, David. 
Dawn has a theory that Head First, Bobbin 
Lacemaking might prove to be a big cult hit, but she 
suspects that Brett might disagree.

Your brain on Geometry. 
Here you are trying to learn something, 
while here your brain is doing you a favor by making sure the learning doesn't 
stick. Your brain's thinking/'Better leave room for more important things, like 
which wild animals to avoid and whether naked snowboarding is a bad idea." 
So, how do you trick your brain into thinking that your life depends on knowing 
about triangles and circles and the Pythagorean Theorem?

Ending missing angles 
Reading between the lines 
Ever get the feeling there's something they're not 
telling you? 
If you want to master the real world, you need to get geometry. It's a set of 
tools for turning a little bit of information into a complete picture. Whether 
you want to design something, build something or find out how a situation 
really went down, geometry can make sure you've always got the lowdown. 
So if you want to keep in the loop, grab your hat, pack your pencil, and join us 
on the bus to Geometryville. 
There's been a homicide

In the ballistics lab you've got to cover all the angles 
3 
Do the angles between Benny, Micky, and the bullet match up? 
4 
Right angles aren't always marked with numbers 
6 
Angles can be made up of other, smaller angles 
7 
Complementary angles always add up to a right angle (90°) 
9 
Right angles often come in pairs 
11 
Angles on a straight line add up to 180° 
14 
Pairs of angles that add up to 180° are called supplementary angles 
17 
Vertical angles are always equal 
19 
The corner angles of a triangle always add up to a straight line

similarity and congruence 
Shrink to fit 
Sometimes, size does matter. 
Ever drawn or built something and then found out it's the w r o n g size? Or made 
something just perfect and wanted to recreate it exactly? You need Similarity and 
Congruence', the time-saving techniques for duplicating your designs smaller, 
bigger, or exactly the same size. Nobody likes doing the same work over—and with 
similarity and congruence, you'll never have to repeat an angle calculation again. 
Welcome to myPod! You're hired 
Liz wants you to etch her phone 
The designer noted some of the details 
The design tells us that some triangles are repeated 
Similar triangles don't just look the same 
To use similarity you need to be able to spot it 
You can spot similar triangles based on just two angles 
Employee of the month already? 
You sketch it—we'll etch it! 
Fire up the etcher! 
The boss isn't happy but at least you're not fired... 
It's a problem of scale... 
Complex shapes can be similar, too 
You sketch it—we'll etch it (to fit) 
Liz is back with a special request 
Similar shapes that are the same size are congruent 
Use what you know to find what you don't know 
Ratios can be more useful than sizes 
Ratios need to be consistent 
Your new design ROCKS!

All the right angles 
Sometimes, you really need to get things straight. 
Ever tried to eat at a wobbly table? Annoying, isn't it? There is an alternative to shoving 
screwed-up paper under the table leg though: use the Pythagorean Theorem to make 
sure your designs are dead straight and not just quite straight. Once you know this 
pattern, you'll be able to spot and create right angles that are perfect every time. 
Nobody likes to pick spagetti out of their lap, and with the Pythagorean Theorem, you 
don't have to. 
Giant construction-kit skate ramps 
104 
Standard-sized-quick-assembly-what?!? 
105 
The ramps must have perpendicular uprights 
106 
You can use accurate construction to test ramp designs on paper 
108 
Not all lengths make a right triangle 
115 
You can explore a geometry problem in different ways 
116 
In geometry, the rules are the rules 
118 
Any good jump has some similar scaled cousins 
121 
The lengths of the sides are linked by a pattern 
126 
The square of the longest side is equal to the squares of 
the other two sides added together 
130 
The Pythagorean Theorem: a2 + b2 = c2

Using Kwik-klik skate ramps is definitely the right angle!

triangle properties 
Between a rock show and a triangular place 
Ever had that sinking feeling that you've made a bad 
decision? 
In the real world, choices can be complex, and wrong decisions can cost you 
money and time. Many solutions aren't always straightforward: even in geometry, 
bigger doesn't always mean better—it might not even mean longer. So what should 
you do? The good news is that you can combine your triangle tools to make great 
decisions even when it seems like you don't have the right information to answer 
the question. 
Everyone loves organizing a rock festival 
150 
First we need to pick a venue 
151 
Fencing costs money 
153 
Does a bigger perimeter mean a bigger area? 
155 
How many people can each venue hold? 
156 
A triangle fits inside a bounding rectangle 
157 
The area of a triangle = 1 / 2 base X height 
163 
You've got 811,250 to spend 
168 
All speakers are not created equal 
170 
So what are you looking for in your speakers? 
171 
The ideal speakers are wider and longer than the venue... 
but only by a little 
100m will do, but can you rent the 60 speaker? 
The 60 speakers are spot on 
All that's left is to pick a spot for the drinks stall 
A triangle has more than one center 
The center of a triangle can be outside the triangle 
Let's put the drink stall at the centroid 
The rock festival is ready! 
The people behind the drinks stall won't see the stage... 
You need a screen for less than 81,440 
Will the special offer screen still do the job? 
You can find area from sides using Hero's formula 
Hero's formula and "1/2 base X height" work together 
The rock festival is gonna... rock!

Going round and round 
OK, life doesn't have to be so straight after all! 
There's no need to reinvent the wheel, but aren't you glad you're able to use it? From 
cars to rollercoasters, many of the most important solutions to life's problems rely 
on circles to get the job done. Free yourself from straight edges and pointy corners— 
there's no end to the curvy possibilities once you master circumference, arcs, and 
It's not just pizza—it's war!

Mario's business is booming! 
222 
But MegaSlice is at it again...

We need to find the area of the two pizza deals 
224 
Each sector (slice) is a triangle (kind of)

Maybe three isn't the (only) magic number. 
The world isn't just made up of triangles and circles. Wherever you look, you'll see 
quadrilaterals, shapes with four straight sides. Knowing your way 'round the quad family 
can save you a lot of time and effort. Whether it's area, perimeter, or angles you're after, 
there are shortcuts galore that you can use to your advantage. Keep reading, and we'll

regular polygons 
It's all shaping up 
Want to have it your way? Life's full of compromises, but you don't have 
to be restricted to triangles, squares, and circles. Regular polygons give you the 
flexibility to demand exactly the shape you need. But don't think that means learning a 
list of new formulas: you can treat 6-, 16-, and 60-sided shapes the same. So, whether 
it's for your own creative project, some required homework that's due tomorrow, or the 
demands of an important client, you'll have the tools to deliver exactly what you want.

And we know what your brain is thinking. 
f 
Your brain craves novelty. It's always searching, scanning, waiting for 
something unusual. It was built that way, and it helps you stay alive. 
So what does your brain do with all the routine, ordinary, normal things 
you encounter? Everything it can to stop them from interfering with 
the brain's real]oh—recording things that matter. It doesn't bother 
saving the boring things; they never make it past the "this is obviously 
not important" filter. 
How does your brain know what's important? Suppose you're out for 
a day hike and a tiger jumps in front of you, what happens inside your 
head and body? 
Neurons fire. Emotions crank up. Chemicals surge. 
And that's how your brain knows 
This must be important! Don't forget it! 
But imagine you're at home, or in a library. It's a safe, warm, 
tiger-free zone. You're studying. Getting ready for an exam. Or 
trying to learn some tough math thing that your teacher is going to 
test you on tomorrow. 
Just one problem. Your brain's trying to do you a big favor. It's trying 
to make sure that this obviously non-important content doesn't clutter 
up scarce resources. Resources that are better spent storing the 
really big things. Like tigers. Like the danger of fire. Like how you 
should never again snowboard in shorts. 
And there's no simple way to tell your brain, "Hey brain, thank 
you very much, but no matter how dull this book is, and how little 
I'm registering on the emotional Richter scale right now, I really do 
want you to keep this stuff around."

the intro 
Metacognition: thinking about thinking 
So just how DO you get your brain to think that 
geometry is a hungry tiger? 
There's the slow, tedious way, or the faster, more effective way. The 
slow way is about sheer repetition. You obviously know that you 
are able to learn and remember even the dullest of topics if you 
keep pounding the same thing into your brain. With enough repetition, your 
brain says, "This doesn't feel important to him, but he keeps looking at the same thing over 
and over and over, so I suppose it must be." 
If you really want to learn, and you want to learn more quickly and more deeply, 
pay attention to how you pay attention. Think about how you think. Learn how you 
learn. 
Most of us did not take courses on metacognition or learning theory when we were 
growing up. We were expected to learn, but rarely taught to learn. 
But we assume that if you're holding this book, you really want (or need) to learn 
about geometry. And you probably don't want to spend a lot of time. And since 
you're going to have to use this stuff in the future, you need to remember what you 
read. And for that, you've got to understand it. To get the most from this book, or any 
book or learning experience, take responsibility for your brain. 
Your brain on geometry. 
The trick is to get your brain to see the new material you're learning 
as Really Important. Crucial to your well-being. As important as a 
tiger. Otherwise, you're in for a constant battle, with your brain doing 
its best to keep the new content from sticking. 
I wonder how I 
can trick my brain 
into remembering 
this stuff.... 
The faster way is to do anything that increases brain activity, especially different 
types of brain activity. The things on the previous page are a big part of the solution, 
and they're all things that have been proven to help your brain work in your favor. For 
example, studies show that putting words within the pictures they describe (as opposed to 
somewhere else in the page, like a caption or in the body text) causes your brain to try to 
makes sense of how the words and picture relate, and this causes more neurons to fire. 
More neurons firing = more chances for your brain to get. that this is something worth 
paying attention to, and possibly recording. 
A conversational style helps because people tend to pay more attention when they 
perceive that they're in a conversation, since they're expected to follow along and hold up 
their end. The amazing thing is, your brain doesn't necessarily care that the "conversation" 
is between you and a book! On the other hand, if the writing style is formal and diy, your 
brain perceives it the same way you experience being lectured to while sitting in a roomful 
of passive attendees. No need to stay awake. 
But pictures and conversational style are just the beginning.

how to use this book 
Here's what WE did: 
We used pictures, because your brain is tuned for visuals, not text. As far as your brain's 
concerned, a picture really is worth a thousand words. And when text and pictures work 
together, we embedded the text in the pictures because your brain works more effectively 
when the text is within the thing the text refers to, as opposed to in a caption or buried in the 
text somewhere. 
We used redundancy, saying the same thing in different ways and with different media types, 
and multiple senses, to increase the chance that the content gets coded into more than one area 
of your brain. 
We used concepts and pictures in unexpected ways because your brain is tuned for novelty, 
and we used pictures and ideas with at least some emotional content, because your brain 
is tuned to pay attention to the biochemistry of emotions. That which causes you to feel 
something is more likely to be remembered, even if that feeling is nothing more than a little 
humor, 
surprise, 
or 
interest. 
We used a personalized, conversational style, because your brain is tuned to pay more 
attention when it believes you're in a conversation than if it thinks you're passively listening 
to a presentation. Your brain does this even when you're reading. 
We included loads of activities, because your brain is tuned to learn and remember more 
when you do things than when you read about things. And we made the exercises challenging-
yet-do-able, because that's what most people prefer. 
We used multiple learning styles, because you might prefer step-by-step procedures, while 
someone else wants to understand the big picture first, and someone else just wants to see 
an example. But regardless of your own learning preference, everyone benefits from seeing the 
same content represented in multiple ways. 
We include content for both sides of your brain, because the more of your brain you 
engage, the more likely you are to learn and remember, and the longer you can stay focused. 
Since working one side of the brain often means giving the other side a chance to rest, you 
can be more productive at learning for a longer period of time. 
And we included stories and exercises that present more than one point of view, 
because your brain is tuned to learn more deeply when it's forced to make evaluations and 
judgments. 
We included challenges, with exercises, and by asking questions that don't always have 
a straight answer, because your brain is tuned to learn and remember when it has to work at 
something. Think about it—you can't get your body in shape just by watching people at the 
gym. But we did our best to make sure that when you're working hard, it's on the right things. 
That you're not spending one extra dendrite processing a hard-to-understand example, 
or parsing difficult, jargon-laden, or overly terse text. 
We used people. In stories, examples, pictures, etc., because, well, because you're a person. 
And your brain pays more attention to people than it does to

Here's what YOU caw do to bend 
your brain into submission 
So, we did our part. The rest is up to you. These tips are a 
starting point; listen to your brain and figure out what works 
for you and what doesn't. Try new things. 
C u i i h i s 
sink ¡1 
re-h-igeraW. 
Slow down. The more you understand, 
the less you have to memorize. 
Don't just read. Stop and think. When the 
book asks you a question, don't just skip to the 
answer. Imagine that someone really is asking 
the question. The more deeply you force your 
brain to think, the better chance you have of 
learning and remembering. 
(5) Talk about it. Out loud. 
Speaking activates a different part of the brain. 
If you're trying to understand something, or 
increase your chance of remembering it later, say 
it out loud. Better still, tiy to explain it out loud 
to someone else. You'll learn more quickly, and 
you might uncover ideas you hadn't known were 
there when you were reading about it. 
© 
® 
Do the exercises. Write your own notes. 
We put them in, but if we did them for you, 
that would be like having someone else do 
your workouts for you. And don't just look at 
the exercises. Use a pencil. There's plenty of 
evidence that physical activity while learning 
can increase the learning. 
Read the "There are No Dumb Questions" 
That means all of them. They're not optional 
sidebars—they're part of the core content! 
Don't skip them. 
Make this the last thing you read before 
bed. Or at least the last challenging thing. 
Part of the learning (especially the transfer to 
long-term memoiy) happens after you put the 
book down. Your brain needs time on its own, to 
do more processing. If you put in something new 
during that processing time, some of what you 
just learned will be lost. 
(5) Drink water. Lots of it. 
Your brain works best in a nice bath of fluid. 
Dehydration (which can happen before you ever 
feel thirsty) decreases cognitive function.

Listen to your brain. 
Pay attention to whether your brain is getting 
overloaded. If you find yourself starting to skim 
the surface or forget what you just read, it's time 
for a break. Once you go past a certain point, you 
won't learn faster by trying to shove more in, and 
you might even hurt the process. 
@ Feel something! 
Your brain needs to know that this matters. Get 
involved with the stories. Make up your own 
captions for the photos. Groaning over a bad joke 
is still better than feeling nothing at all. 
0 Create something! 
Pick up a model kit or some wood and tools 
and make something really cool! Or work out 
something you will build one day when you have 
the time and money. All you need is a pencil 
and a problem to solve.. .a problem that might 
benefit from using the tools and techniques you're 
studying to get geometry.

how to use this book 
Read Me 
This is a learning experience, not a reference book. We deliberately stripped out everything 
that might get in the way of learning whatever it is we're working on at that point in the 
book. And the first time through, you need to begin at the beginning, because the book 
makes assumptions about what you've already seen and learned. 
We don't follow a regular school syllabus. 
We couldn't cover every single element of the syllabus so we paid attention to what 
questions our own brains were asking, asked students what they found tricky, and we 
included extra things which allow you to find patterns that link the learning together 
because your 
brain 
loves patterns. 
So, if you're going to need to pass a test, then you'll also need a reference book that covers 
the syllabus for that test, but don't worry. We've picked out the trickiest and most interesting-
parts in this book, and we've emphasized understanding geometry so you should be in great 
shape to slot those extra details into place quickly. 
We don't drag you through formal proofs of new concepts. 
If you're doing high school geometry you'll probably be familiar with—and possibly 
terrified of—geometry proofs. 
There are no formal proofs in this book. We believe 
that, for most people, proofs make learning geometry harder than it needs to be. Instead, 
we've used visual exercises to explore patterns and general rules in ways that we are 
confident that you'll remember and even be able to show other people. 
We're working on another book in this mini-series that will handle all that formal logic and 
proof stuff, but for now you're in great shape if you understand geometry in the real world 
This is just about two-dimensional (2D) geometry. 
We promise it's not just so we can sell you another book called Head First 3D Geometry 
soon! We've covered many of the most important techniques you'll use when working in 
two dimensions, so you're all set for exploring further dimensions at the end of this book. 
In fact, we've even snuck in a couple of 3D problems that you can work in 2D, because 
geometry is about solving interesting problems in the real world, not just on paper. 
We use plain English and not geometry jargon. 
We believe your brain needs to see what something is, and figure out why you would 
even care about it, before you can give it an unfamiliar label. We do use the geometry 
jargon you'll need to know for tests from time to time, but not until we're sure you'll know 
what we're talking about. We encourage you to use real words to describe patterns and not sweat 
the official formulas too much.

intro 

the intro 
We don't consider this to be the end of our conversation w i t h 
you. 
Gome and talk to us at www.headfirstlabs.com/geometry. If there's something we didn't 
cover that's really puzzling you, then throw us a question and we'll see if we can help 
you with a Head First style way of figuring it out. Of course we won't do the work for 
you, which is why... 
...the activities are NOT optional. 
The exercises and activities are not add-ons; they're part of the core content of the 
book. Some of them are to help with memory, some are for understanding, and some 
will help you apply what you've learned. Don't skip the exercises. The geometry 
investigations are particularly important; they'll help you discover how your brain likes 
to figure stuff out—known as logic in formal geometiy proofs that come much later 
(not in this book). They also give your brain a chance to hook in to the geometiy that is 
all around you in the real world. 
The redundancy is intentional and important. 
One distinct difference in a Head First book is that we want you to really get it. And we 
want you to finish the book remembering what you've learned. Most reference books 
don't have retention and recall as a goal, but this book is about learning, so you'll see 
some of the same concepts come up more than once. 
The Brain Power exercises don't have answers. 
For some of them, there is no right answer, and for others, part of the learning 
experience of the Brain Power activities is for you to decide if and when your answers 
are right. In some of the Brain Power exercises, you will find hints to point you in the 
right direction.

Ever get the feeling there's something they're not telling you? 
If you want to master the real world, you need to get geometry. It's a set of tools for 
turning a little bit of information into a complete picture. Whether you want to design 
something, build something or find out how a situation really went down, geometry can 
make sure you've always got the lowdown. So if you want to keep in the loop, grab your 
hat, pack your pencil, and join us on the bus to Geometryville.

There's been a homicide 
And the number one suspect, Benny, is firmly behind 
bars. To the officers it looked like an open and shut 
case but Benny is still claiming he's innocent. 
O w e 
So yeah, I owed Micky a little money 
and went out to meet him at some waterfront 
warehouse. Next thing I know, I hear a buncha 
noise, and Micky's lying dead, shot through the 
back! I was gonna pay him, I swear. It wasn't that 
much money, not enough to off the guy over it. 
There are veiy few clues to go on, 
so the GSIs are relying on you to 
work up the only solid clues they've 
got: the ballistics evidence.

In the ballistics lab you've got to cover 
all the angles 
As the ballistics investigator, your mission is to work out what happened 
to the bullet between when it was fired from the gun and when it stopped 
moving, and whether that ties up with what the investigators suspect— 
that Benny shot Micky. 
Pullets travel in straight lines 
The whole basis of your investigation is something that all bullets have in 
common: they travel in straight lines.

Angles are formed where straight lines meet. Because bullets move in 
straight lines, taking aim really means deciding what the angle is between 
you and the target. The angle of the shot determines whether the bullet 
hits or misses the target.

assessing the crime scene 
Vo the angles between Penny, Micky, 
and the bullet match up? 
At the crime scene, the investigators took some measurements 
and sketched the positions of Benny, Micky's body, and the point 
where they found the bullet in the wall, all relative to the building 
where the crime took place.

They must have been busy that day, because 
they didn't measure everything! But, they 
found one important detail: the bullet 
entered the wall at an angle of 18° through 
the front wall. 
So, to solve the crime, all you have to do is 
prove that from where Benny was standing 
to the target (Micky), the bullet would have 
traveled in a straight line that joins up 
perfectly with the bullet path.

Well, this is easy! You can see just 
by looking at it that the line from 
Benny to Micky and the line for the bullet 
path join up to make one straight line. 
Jill: Hang on—I'm not sure we can really go by eye like that! 
Joe: Oh, well, we could use a ruler to check it. But I'm pretty 
sure it's a straight line. 
Frank: I don't think we could trust it, even if the ruler 
showed it was straight—the sketch clearly says "drawing not 
to scale." The angles we've been given are correct, but if you 
checked it with a protractor the lines on the sketch wouldn't 
necessarily be the same angles as at the scene itself. 
Joe: What? Well, it's useless then, isn't it? 
Frank: It's not useless—if it says 18° on the sketch then it 
was 18° at the scene because they measured it there. But I 
don't think we can go on what the sketch looks like. We're 
going to actually have to work out whether the line segments 
reallyjoin up into one straight line. 
Joe: But we've only got three angles to go on. I bet the chief 
will say we need to fill them all in. He's gonna be mad. 
Jill: Wiat if we could find a way to guess some angles based 
on other angles or something? But that just sounds really 
inaccurate—not exactly good for our case in court! 
Frank: It sounds like the right kind of approach though. And 
anyway, I think they've measured five angles, not just three 
Does the sketch tell you five angles, or just three? 
Is there a way you could start to find some of the angles you haven't 
been given on the sketch?

right 
angles 
Right angles aren't always marked with numbers 
A right angle is an internal angle (the smallest angle) between 
two lines equal to 90°. Instead of drawing a curve, like we do 
for most angles, we mark it with a square corner. 
A right angle is a quarter turn—like the angle between the 
hands on the clock at 3 o'clock or the amount you have to 
turn a skateboard to get into and out of a boardslide without 
landing on your face.

lines that meet at a right angle are perpendicular 
Whether they actually cross each other or only meet 
at a point, two lines that form a right angle are called 
perpendicular lines. We could also say that one of 
the lines is perpendicular to the other. 
So it turns out that we do have five 
angles on the sketch after all. 
Although they don't say "90°" on them, the little square 
angle marks tell us that some of the angles are right angles. 
But what about all those other angles that aren't marked 
on the sketch?

Line segments are parts of lines 
In geometiy jargon, a line goes on

just a bit of a line with a start and an end.

Dumb Questions 
I checked that mystery angle with a protractor and it 
wasn't 72°—so how come you're saying it is? 
In geometry, unless you're specifically told to measure 
an angle, assume that the drawing isn't accurate, but that the 
numbers on the sketch are. We calculate missing angles rather 
than measure them. 
Q/ What about all the other lines on the diagram? Do we 
know if they're straight? 
The other line segments on the sketch represent things 
like walls or the path between two points. They're all definitely 
straight. In fact, the two line segments we're interested in—the 
bullet path and the path from Benny to Micky—are also straight. 
What we need to find out is whether they join up to form one 
single straight line.

finding

Complementary angles always 
add up to a right angle (90°) 
If two angles combine to creat a right angle we call t h e m 
complementary angles. Usually, complementary angles are adjacent 
(next to each other), but they can be any two angles anywhere that 
a d d up to 90 degrees. 
We say that the angles c o m p l e m e n t each other.

Dumb Questions 
Q/ How can I tell which angles do and 
don't have a complement? 
Only acute angles—angles less than 
90°—can be complementary. An obtuse 
angle is already greater than 90° on its own. 
Q/ Why doesn't 102° have a negative 
complement of-12°? Surely that would 
add up to 90°? 
Complements can never be negative. 
There's no real reason for this except that the 
term "complementary" means two positive 
angles which add up to 90°. 
Only acute 
angles can be 
complementary.

much, but together they make up an accurate picture

It would be great to jump straight to the most important

need to find a bunch of less exciting stuff to help us get

We know that you can always fit a pair of right angles on a 
straight line, but what if we don't have right angles? 
What might this pair of mystery angles (a and b) from our 
crime scene sketch add up to? 
l-f we had a pair o-f v-ight angles, they would add 
uf to °\0° + °\0° - ISO0. 
Ouv pair o-f mystevy angles make up the same 
total angle as a paiv o-f v-ight angles, so 
a0 + b° - ISO0. 
Angles on a straight line add up to ISO4 
Whether a half turn is made up of two quarter turns or 
lots of different small turns, the total angle of a half turn 
is always 180°. 
This means that when the angle on a straight line is 
divided up into smaller angles we can always be sure that 
they add up to 180°.

Pairs of angles that add up to 180° are 
called supplementary angles 
Any two angles which add up to 180° are known as 
supplementary angles. They are easiest to spot when 
they're on a straight line, but they can also be far apart.

Vertical angles are always equal 
When two straight lines cross they always create two pairs of 
equal opposite angles, called vertical angles. 
Each angle has to form a supplementary pair with either of 
the angles on the other side of it, so they must be equal. 
Two straight 
lines cross

The corner angles of a triangle always make a straight line,

Jill: Benny's lawyer is gonna have a field day. I don't believe it. 
We've got the right guy in custody—it's obvious he did it—and 
we're gonna have to let him go because of some messed up math! 
Can we fix it? 
Frank: The weirdest thing is that I'm looking again at the math 
for either method and it looks good. I mean—corners on a 
triangle always add up to 180 degrees, and vertically opposite 
angles are always equal. Those are the rules. 
Joe: I knew we were relying too much on these coincidences. My 
guess is that these "rules" don't always actually work! 
Jill: I really don't think that's what it means. If we haven't 
messed up the calculations then the fact that we got two different 
answers simply has to mean something else....

The mystery angle is 18° and the mystery angle is 13°.. .well, 
that clearly doesn't add up. If the mystery angle is 13°, then 
it can't be vertically opposite our 18° bullet path angle as well. 
This means that the line on the sketch from Benny to Micky 
doesn't join up perfectly with the bullet path.

You've proved that Penny couldn't have shot Micky! 
Unless Benny has a magic gun, he couldn't have 
shot Micky AND had the bullet enter the wall at 
the point that the CSIs found at the scene. 
Benny is not our shooter, so the charges have been 
dropped and he's been released from custody, which 
has produced an interesting development.... 
O 
What I tried to tell them when I was arrested 
is that I don't even own a gun! But there was this other 
guy there, Charlie, inside the building. I think he took a shot 
at me. I heard a gunshot and breaking glass so I ducked. The 
bullet hit the car that was parked behind me, and then it sped 
away. I don't know how Micky ended up shot, but at least 
you know it wasn't me! 
And the chief is on the phone.. 
Great work. This case was

up the ballistics. But who the heck is

Following up on Benny's story, officers have returned to the scene, and 
found footprints, a broken window, and a set of tire trackes that might 
indicate that he's telling the truth. But there's a big problem—from where 
Charlie appeared to be standing, he can't have shot Micky through the 
door, plus the bullet that killed him came from the outside the building! 
We do know that the bullet must have traveled in a straight line headed in 
the direction shown on the sketch, but how it got there is the big question.

Dumb Questions 
Q/ The dotted line extending the bullet path—how do we 
know it's really straight? 
We're going to start by saying that this line MUST be 
straight heading backward from where the bullet entered the wall, 
and then work up the sketch to find out how the bullet came to be 
traveling in exactly that trajectory. 

finding missing angles 
We weed a new theory 
Although you don't know what happened, if you can come up with 
some imaginative suggestions about what might have happened, 
you can test them by working out whether the angles add up, just 
like when you proved that Benny couldn't have shot Micky. 
Right. So now's the time to start 
guessing? Maybe some aliens came 
down and shot Micky? This is stupid 
It's not just a matter of guessing. 
You can use the statement Benny gave and all the relevant 
information on the crime scene sketch to guide you. Our 
points, lines, and angles are still as true as ever.

Work out what you weed to know 
Based on your sketch, you need to work out what your theory actually 
means in terms of points, lines, and angles. 
In this case we've got a few important details. We have a line from the 
point where Charlie was standing, through the hole in the window, until 
it hits the parked car. We also sketched a line moving backward from the 
bullet, until that hits the parked car, too. 
If our theory is true, and Charlie was the shooter, the way the bullet 
bounced off the car is important. 
You guys have a bouncing bullet? Cool! Well, 
whenever we do lab tests on this type of 
bullet they always bounce out at the same 
angle as they bounced in on. Does that help?

finding 
missing 
angles 
Parallel lines are lines at exactly the same angle 
Two, or more, lines which are at exactly the same angle (like the 
tire tracks from the car must be) are called parallel lines. We use 
little v-shaped tick marks to indicate sets of parallel lines or line 
segments on a sketch. 
Parallel lines can never meet or cross each other, even if you 
stretch them for miles and miles and miles.... 
Even ii you 
stretch them 
iorever, parallel 
lines never cross 
each other. 
The distance between the lines 
is Constant—they never get 
closer or -farther away-
If you have more than one set of parallel lines on the same 
sketch then you need to use a different number of tick marks 
on each set to be able to tell them apart. 
T R A C K S 
If parallel lines are always at the 
same angle, and our tire tracks 
are parallel, what should this 
angle here be?

vertical 
angle 
patterns 
Parallel lines often come with 
helpful angle shortcuts 
When you have a line which meets or crosses a set of parallel 
lines, all the sets of (opposite) vertical angles that are created are 
the same. 
So -this angle here should 
be the same-^ 0 
This means that you can find more missing angles without 
doing any math at all—just by recognizing a few patterns. The 
F Pattern, the Z Pattern, and the N Pattern are formed 
when parallel lines cross or meet another line.

Rotate the page

the Z pattern 
and the N pattern 
are pretty mudh 
the same thing. 
Look out ior F, X, and N 
patterns around parallel 
lines ior a shortcut to 
iinctingf missing angles. 
Watch it! 
The F, Z, or N can be 
hidden 
Sometimes they're upside 
down, back-to-front, or both! 
The two angles 
treated are always 
supplementary. 
Two sets o-P vertical 
angles-notiie how one 
set is exactly the same as 
the other, so we only have 
TWO different angles to 
deal with.

To use similarity, you 
need to be able to spot it 
You won't normally get instructions that 
actually tell you that shapes are similar. So 
in order to use similarity, first you need to 
be able to be certain that shapes are similar. 
You can do that by looking for matching sets 
of angles.

Solution

We know that angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees, so once 
you've got two angles in each triangle, you can always work out the 
third. 
And if you've noticed that two angles in one triangle are equal to two 
angles in another triangle, then you can tell the triangles are similar 
without even doing any math!

right and the other has a 41° angle on left? Are they similar? 
As long as you can spot another angle which is in 
both triangles then yes, they're definitely similar. Similarity is 
maintained even if your shape is reflected or rotated.

Cheating? We like to think of it as working smarter rather 
than harder. It does save you plenty of leg work though. Most

than repetitive calculations anyway—just make sure to make a 
note on your work that you used similarity.

Problems with an etching? 
8th August 2009 13:12:16 BST 
I hear you had a problem with a customer's phone? 
We keep spare stock in the store room in case of emergency. You can replace the 
phone from one of these. 
But please make sure this doesn't happen again. 
So what happened? 
Here's what the design should have looked like. What do you 
think could have gone wrong? 

the phone's 
size 
is 
important 
It's a problem of scale... 
The design Liz picked was originally created in 2007, when 
phones were a lot bigger than the one Liz has today. In fact, 
the design is twice as big as the space available on the back of 
Liz's phone for etching!

Dumb Questions 
How come there weren't any units on the drawing? If 
they'd put units we could have seen whether it fit before we 
started etching. 
You're right, we could have. In this case, though, the lengths 
on the diagram wouldn't be normal measures like millimeters or 
inches, but a special measure used by the etching machine. 
Q/ But shouldn't the drawing still have a scale? Wouldn't 
we be best to add one now? 
For now we can just adjust the lengths we've got to work 
with—we can safely assume that whatever units the etcher uses, 
they aren't going to change before we etch again. But in the next 
chapter we're going to look at using scales in a lot more detail.

Similarity isn't just for triangles! Provided you shrink or grow your shapes 
proportionally, they can also be similar. When shapes are proportional, 
the ratios between the lengths of their different lines are the same.

This week's interview: 
Ratios or angles, which is 
real similarity?

Head First: You're really becoming popular—a lot 
of people are saying you're the time-saving technique 
they wish they'd always known. 
Similarity: Yes—it's nice of you to say so! I do like 
to think I'm rather, um, efficient is the best word, I 
guess. 
Head First: That's certainly true! But there's one 
thing I'm wondering.... 
Similarity: Go on. .. 
Head First: Well, people recognize you by 
matching angles—and others use the proportional 
thing—and I'm just wondering, which is the real you? 
Similarity: I don't understand. You mean you think 
I can only be one or the other? 
Head First: Well, surely one is what you're really 
about, and the other is just a convenient alternative 
way of presenting yourself. I want to get to the heart 
of the real similarity—who are you when you're just 
relaxing at home? 
Similarity: Well, to be honest, I really am always 
both! I know it sounds silly, but I've never thought of 
my different aspects as being separate. With triangles, 
and a lot of other shapes, too, if the angles are 
matching, then the sides are also proportional. I can't 
really pick and choose one or the other! 
Head First: And what about if you've got 
proportionality; if ratios between the lengths of a 
triangle are the same, but you don't have matching 
angles? Do you feel something is missing? 
Similarity: But that could never happen with a 
triangle! That's just how it is. Anytime triangles have 
the same ratios, they have the same angles. You've 
made me anxious now.. .but honestly, it's just not 
possible. Proportionality and angles—with triangles 
it's always about both, equally together! 
Head First: Together? I didn't know you were 
mixing it up like that. Interesting... Now, you said, 
"a lot of other shapes, too"—that suggests that it's 
not always the case that angles and proportionality 
go together? 
Similarity: Ah, well, there are some shapes that are 
different. Take rectangles for example. All rectangles 
have the same angles—90, 90, 90, and 90 degrees. 
But they aren't all proportional—you can have long 
skinny ones and short fat ones. 
Head First: So you don't work with rectangles at 
all? 
Similarity: Oh, I do. But only proportional ones. 
Like if you had a rectangle with sides 3 and 6, and 
one with 4 and 8—you'd know they were similar. 
And squares! I love squares. All of them are similar. 
Every single one. Beautiful. Just beautiful. 
Head First: Right. Beautiful squares, eh? Thanks 
for the interview. 
You can spot similarity using 
angles or ike ratios between 
lengths or sides, or Loth.

Before you start sketching the design, which lengths and angles 
do you need to find? Could you use similarity to save yourself 
some time and effort? 
We need to -find the lengths and angles of the sides of one of the 
small tviangles and one o-f the big tviangles, plus the lengths o-f the 
sides of one of the small slaves and one of the big slaves. 
Although theve aven't any length ov angle markings on the diagram, 
the instructions give us plenty of ¿lues—and there's a ton of 
similarity going on here-

But calculating the 
corner angles of squares and 
equilateral triangles is the easy 
part! How's congruence going 
to help with all those angles 
between the arrows? Huh? 
For starters, congruence means you 
only have to do one third of the work. 
Those overlap angles are much trickier, but you'll only 
have to find each one once—then you can just copy it 
to each of the angles congruent with it.

Tonight's talk: Similarity and Congruence 
Similarity: 
Congruence: 
I'm worried about you. You seem neurotic, always 
concerned about being a size zero, or seven, or 
whatever. You need to relax more. 
But size DOES matter. It's all very well having your 
angles right on paper, but if something is too big or 
too small, in the real world size actually matters. 
I just think if you stopped worrying so much about 
size and focused on proportionality you'd have more 
opportunities. I get used all the time—my flexibility 
is a real asset. 
And potentially a real headache! Sometimes it 
doesn't cut it just being similar—and that's where 
I come in, when you need to rely on size as well as 
shape. Plus, I'm faster to use. 
Faster? How? I'm pretty fast, you know! 
Yeah, you're quick, but even if something's similar, 
if it's not congruent, then you've gotta do some 
math for the lengths. OK, it's only multiplication 
and division, but it all takes time. 
True. And I'm a big stickler for efficiency. People 
would do well to use both of us more! 
Yes. Are you getting much non-triangle work these 
days? I'm mostly getting triangle stuff still, and it's 
not that I don't like it.. .but you know, I have so 
much more potential. 
Oh, tell me about it! I think they forget that we're 
not all about the triangles. And that we travel so 
well.... 
Completely—I love to travel! You can flip me 
upside down, back to front, spin me around and 
move me from one place to another, and I still work 
just as well. 
Great to catch up! I'll let you know if I get any work 
you could help out with.

Dumb Questions 
Q , ' Surely even if I use the proper sizes, as long as it's 
proportional, I can just do some more math to work out a different 
size by multiplying by a new factor? 
You can—it's just that the math will be a lot harder and the ratios 
much less clear. Technically it's not wrong, it's just not the simplest 
way to go about creating a scalable design. 
92 
Chapter 2

Ratios can be more useful than sizes 
A ratio captures the proportions of a shape, and

Dumb Questions 
Q/ How come 1:1 is a ratio? Isn't that a bit pointless? 
It does sound a bit weird, doesn't it? 1:1 is a way of 
indicating that it's exactly the same size as the original. If you 
didn't put the 1:1 in there, then someone reading your work or 
diagram might wonder whether you'd forgotten to put a ratio in for 
that item. 1:1 indicates clearly that it's the same size. 
Q/ The drummer wrote that the dark arrows are 3/4 size, 
so why have you written it as 3:4? 
3/4 and 3:4 are just different ways of indicating the same 
relative proportion. 3/4 is fraction notation and 3:4 is ratio notation. 
Unless you've been specifically told to use one or the other then 
they're mostly swappable.

Uh, sorry, dude, but you've messed 
up. You're saying that the arrow heads 
are triangles with size 3, and size 4, and 
size 2...well, they can't be ALL of them! 
Frank: I kinda followed what you did though.. .with the 
ratios, and it all makes sense. 
Jim: I don't think so, it has to be wrong. There's no way it can 
be 2 and 4, or 2 and 3.. .not at the same time. You need to 
take another look. 
Joe: That or the drummer got it wrong. They're not always 
the brightest in the band.... 
Frank: Gould it be something to do with it being ratios rather 
than sizes? Like, I'm twice as old as my sister, but I'm also half 
as old as my dad.... 
Joe: And you're half as good-looking as me. What are you 
going on about? Those are both twos.. .we're worried about 
different numbers! 
Frank: Yeah, but my dad is four times as old as my kid 
sister—so, you could say their ages were 4:1, even though my 
dad and I are 2:1. They're both true; it's just relative. 
Jim: Relative to what, though? 
Frank: That's the thing—maybe we just need to choose one 
thing for our ratios to be relative to and then stick with it.

Solution 
How is making your own accurate drawing different from just 
measuring a sketch or diagram you're given? 
If you've drawing the diagram yourself you can keep it in proportion, and you tan get the 
angles right, too- You tan use a set square ov a protractor, ov gvidded paper, to make 
suve lines that ave supposed to be perpendicular ave drawn at vight angles. 
l-f you draw a line 3cm and anothev line ¿Cm—measured with a good vulev—you know fov 
suve that the first line you dvew is half the length of the othev. 
When you've given a sketch you don't know whethev the pevson who dvew it used a vulev 
and pvotvactov to make the dvawing accurate, ov just did it voughly.

Yup. If you can't draw it with a right 
angle, then you can't build it with a 
right angle, either!

Any good jump has some similar scaled cousins 
When you scale the ramp—making it bigger or smaller—none 
of the angles change, so it stays a good ramp with a right angle. 
To find whole number lengths for the smaller-scaled sizes, look 
for a common factor in your current lengths. That's easiest to do 
by using a set of factor trees.

D u m b Questions 
What if I wanted a ramp even smaller? Can I just keep 
doing more factor trees? 
The Kwik-klik units don't come in half sizes—there isn't a 1.5 
length, so you'd quickly run out of parts, but assuming you weren't 
just talking about building it with the kit parts, you still only need 
to do your factor trees until one of the numbers on the bottom is a 
prime number—that means it can't be divided by anything except 
itself and one. Then to make a really small ramp you'd multiply 
those factors by a fraction. 
How can we skate on a 2D ramp? Isn't this gonna be 
more like a rail that you can slide on? 
What we're actually representing is the side of the ramp. 
There would be two of these side triangles the same, with a panel 
connected to the sloping beam on each triangle. This is a 3D 
problem which has a 2D solution.

Frank: OK, don't freak out, but if you just try it, like for the

Jim: What? Are you sure you got your numbers right?

Right. So—for these four right triangles, 
you get this freaky pattern. Don't you think 
if you're gonna use this to design skate jumps 
you need something a bit more reliable? What if 
these are the ONLY four triangles it works for? 
It doesn't even make sense. What have squares 
got to do with triangles anyway? 
126 
Chapter 2 
True. Can we really trust this pattern? 
The numbers we've tested so far seem pretty conclusive, 
but do we definitely know that this pattern is going to work 
for all the possible right-angled jumps we might need? 
And how do the squares relate to the triangles? Let's 
investigate this pattern in a more general way.

can be a, b, and c—where c is the longest side. Below are two large 
squares, each of which has side length a+b. 
Can you arrange the gray triangles inside the squares so that in one box 
you are left with a square with side length "c"and in the other box you 
are left with two squares—one with side length "a"and one with side 
length "b"? Make sure to use four triangles in each box.

Skate Ramp Magnets Solution 
Sam's sketched out a rough design for the competition course. She wants 
three different sets of ramps for the skaters to demo their skills on—one 
with a gap to jump and two with joining rails to slide on. 
Using the Pythagorean Theorem and the construction kit magnets, work 
out where each part needs to go to complete the course design. Use each 
part exactly once.

Non-integer solutions: 
I guess we're quite a famous family. Most people can 
recognize at least one or two of us. 3-4-5 gets the 
most attention but that's not the whole range. 
Range schmange. We don't have a range—think of 
a number, and we can find you a solution. We non-
integer solutions are flexible. Any size, any place, 
you can still have a right angle. 
Yeah but you totally need a calculator—nobody 
knows the square roots of weird numbers by heart... 
and who carries one of those around? We integer 
solutions are convenient—especially if you can 
remember them!

Using Kwik-klik skate ramps is definitely the right angle! 
By finding right triangles with whole number ratios between 
the lengths of the sides, you've managed to build a whole load 
of different ramps from the Kwik-klik standard parts. It's a fast, 
cheap, and smart way to build a skate course, and you're in a 
great position to reap the rewards.

BULLET POINTS 
• 
To find the longest side, square the other two sides, add those up, and then find the 
square root. 
• 
To find a short side, square the other two sides and subtract one from the other. Make 
it a positive number and then find the square root. 
• 
Finding missing sides using the Pythagorean Theorem only works for right triangles. 
Q/ But WHY? How come it adds up 
like that? 
That is a very good question and one 
which mathematicians and philosophers 
have struggled with for centuries. 
Unfortunately there's not always good "why" 
reasons in geometry—stuff just IS. The 
good news is that it's very reliable...so 
while understanding why the Pythagorean 
Theorem works is beyond most of us, at 
least we can make good use of it. 
Q/ Why is it called The Pythagorean 
Theorem? Why not something more 
meaningful and easier to spell like 
"Right triangle check" theorem? 
Pythagoras was a Greek guy. He was 
first to write down the theorem. That isn't to 
say that nobody had noticed it before, but 
he gets the props. Shame he wasn't called 
something easier to spell!

- Dumb Questions 
Q , ' I tried to use the Pythagorean 
Theorem to find a missing short side, 
and I was stuck trying to find the square 
root of a negative number. What should 
I do? 
You've probably got your legs and 
your hypotenuse mixed up. Try to redo 
your subtraction the other way round. This 
should give you a positive number, and 
you'll be able to find the square root. 
Q. 
Q: 
• So is "c" always the hypotenuse? 
The Pythagorean Theorem uses "c" 
for the hypotenuse and "a" and "b" for the 
legs. Of course we know that algebra is just 
a tool for describing a pattern, and in this 
case, the pattern is what's important: the 
longest side squared equals the other 
two sides squared. So, if you get mixed 
up about your a, b, and c, think about what 
the pattern behind that formula is, and go 
from there. 
Do all triangles have a 
hypotenuse? What if I have two long 
sides of equal length and one short 
side? Which is the hypotenuse? 
Only right triangles officially have a 
hypotenuse. And if you've got two sides 
equally long, and one shorter one, your 
triangle can't have a right angle, because it 
would fail the c2 = a2 + b2 test, whichever of 
your longer sides you decided was "c". 
But don't think you can't use the 
Pythagorean Theorem for triangles that 
don't have a right angle...it's just takes a 
little more thought to apply it. (More on that 
in a minute.)

Subject: $3000 for some TV work

To: sam@skatedesignsunlimited.com 
Hi Sam, 
I'm the executive producer of the popular TV show Xtreme Action and one of the skaters 
we regularly film with has told me about your exciting competition. Apparently there's a 
real buzz going round—people are saying you're pushing the ramp design way beyond the 
normal level, and that you've got some cool new technology that means that the courses 
are portable? 
We can see huge potential in what you're doing, and we'd like to film your next competition 
and feature it on our show. We'll be able to offer you a fee of $3,000 dollars per competition 
in return for the filming rights. 
We'd also like you to add a huge rope swing in the middle of the course, can you handle 
the design? 
We're touring the show and at the first venue the platforms are gonna be 2m above head 
height (allowing for someone real tall), and the clearance from there to the ceiling where 
we'll fix the swing is 4m. How far apart can we place the blocks without anyone swinging 
straight into the floor? 
I've attached a couple of sketches, 
The TV company wants you to design them a rope swing, so 
that they get maximum excitement and minimum lawsuits. 
Are they right to be worried about accidents if the blocks at 
either side of the swing are too far apart?

The wider the gap between the platforms, the more exciting the swing

smashing into the floor!

Dumb Questions 
Q/ The Pythagorean Theorem formula (c2 = a2 + b2) looks 
like it's for finding the hypotenuse (c). But sometimes we're 
finding a length of a short side. How do I know what I'm 
supposed to be finding and how to find it? 
You can rearrange the formula to focus on one of the short 
sides (legs). Like a2 = c2 - b2 or b2 = c2 - a2, but the most reliable 
thing to do is to focus on the meaning behind the pattern. If you're 
looking for the hypotenuse remember that the squares of the two 
shortest sides add up to make the square of the longest side. 
If you're finding a short side then you need to think of the pattern 
like this: the difference between the square of the longest side and 
another side is the square of the remaining side.

Q/ OK, that's not so bad when I'm given the lengths of 
two sides and I have to find the other side's length. But what 
about when I'm only given one side and I have to find integer 
values that complete a right triangle? The formula can't give 
me the answer because I don't have enough valuesl 
Again, think about the pattern behind the formula. If you've 
got a load of possible values—or if you know the value is within a 
range (like "less than 20")—then here's a trick you can rely on to 
find the answers: just remember that this pattern is about square 
numbers. (1,4, 9,16,25, 36,49, 64, 81,100,...etc). 
Write down all the values you've been given to choose between, 
and then write down their squares. Then compare pairs of 
numbers and see whether they add up to a square number, or 
whether the difference between them is a square number.

How can you make the swing problem into a 
right triangle problem so that you can use the 
Pythagorean Theorem to find length d? 
Well, the rope doesn't change 
length, does it? So I guess that gives 
us two sides of the triangle, but we 
can't use the Pythagorean Theorem 
to find the missing side without a 
right angle, can we? 
^ 
That's right—the Pythagorean Theorem 
only finds missing sides for right 
triangles. 
So, when you're faced with a triangle without a right 
angle you've got two options: find something else in 
your Geometry Toolbox to solve the problem, or see if 
you can somehow turn your non-right triangle into a 
right triangle (or triangles!)

Dumb Questions 
Q/ I get that the rope length doesn't 
change, so the sides are equal, but how 
did we know that the bottom two angles 
are equal? 
An isoceles triangle has two sides 
equal but also two angles equal—always. 
So—if you see that the sides are the same 
you know the angles are the same, and the 
other way around. 
Q/ How did we know that the altitude 
would be vertical? 
The altitude is always perpendicular 
to the base that it's drawn on, so if that 
base is horizontal (as it is in this case), 
then the altitude must be vertical. 
So, which triangle does the 
altitude belong to? 
Both! The altitude is the shared side 
of the two identical (congruent) triangles it 
creates in this case. So, it belongs to both 
of them.

Dumb Questions 
Right. So, generally, is this 
Pythagorean thing for finding integer 
solutions or not? 
You'll find that a lot of geometry 
problems center around the "Pythagorean 
triples." You can think of them as Super 
Triangles—right triangles with integer side 
lengths. You've already found some—3,4,5 
and 5,12,13 are two of the most important. 
Super Triangles...cool! Do I need 
to learn the actual values or just know 
that they exist? 
You can always use the Pythagorean 
Theorem to find them, but that's gonna 
be pretty slow...so if you're good at 
remembering stuff then learning the first 
three or four (in the toolbox at the end of 
this chapter) can be a real time saver.

Dumb Questions 
Q/ What if I've got a triangle which doesn't have a horizonal 
side? How do I draw a bounding rectangle? 
Use a vertical side if you have one because it does make 
things easier, but if you don't have one, then any side will do. 
These av-e 
both -fine. 
N 
Q/ We've talked about sides and angles being the same 
in congruent triangles, but how do you know that congruent 
triangles have the same area, too? 
With a bit of flipping and rotation you can always place 
congruent triangles on top of one another, and they fit perfectly—so 
they must have the same area. 
Q/ What if I don't know the size of the bounding rectangle? 
Good point. We're going to cover some ways to find that out.

Dumb Questions 
Is this for real? Are speakers really sold by angles? 
Yup. Common sizes are 60°, 90°, and 120°. Bass 
speakers tend to be broad, and tweeters (for higher 
frequencies) are narrower, but all vary. Apparently for 
perfect sound quality you need to sit so that you and 
your two stereo speakers (left and right) make a perfect 
equilateral triangle. But that's only for really hardcore 
music geeks. 
Q/ And don't we need more than one speaker? 
What you're really ordering is a speaker system, which 
would probably have more than one unit. 
1 7 4 
Chapter 4 

triangle 
properties 
100m will do, but caw you rent the 60° speaker? 
The 60° speakers are way cheaper but are they going to do the job? 
Will everybody in the festival be able to hear or will people at the 
sides be straining to hear? 
That all depends on the angle of your venue. The speakers project 
sound in the shape of an isosceles triangle. Your venue is also an 
isosceles triangle. If the venue angle is less than 60°, then it's all good. 
Because 60° are the narrowest speakers available, it doesn't really 
matter what that angle is, as long as it's less than 60°. If it's more than 
60°, then you'll need to find an extra $1,000 for the 90° speakers. 
Uh, yeah. Did 
you notice that the 
venue diagrams don't 
HAVE angles? 
That's true. 
The only thing you know about the venue is the side 
lengths and height (you worked out the perimeter and area 
earlier, too, but they don't tell you the angles either). Is that 
enough to help you work out if the 60° speaker will do? 
Is this angle less 
than ¿o°?

Your mission is to complete the table at the bottom of this page, 
by using your own hands to investigate how we can use side 
length and height to estimate angles. 
Using your forefingers and thumbs, make a 
triangle that is roughly equilateral. 
Now change the length of the base of the 
triangle, by moving your thumbs apart or 
together. Keep your fingers the same length 
so that you know the triangle is isosceles. 
Pay attention to how changing the 
proportions of the triangle—the relative 
length of the base and sides, and the 
height—changes the apex angle.

Dumb Questions 
Q/ Are you sure it's OK to be 
estimating angles like this? Don't we 
always need to work out exactly what 
the angle is? 
If the problem or question requires 
a precise answer along the lines of "what 
is angle x," then you'll need to find the 
angle exactly, but sometimes it's possible 
to solve a problem just by knowing roughly 
what an angle is. For example, is it a right 
angle? Or maybe just is it acute or obtuse? 
Q/ And this is isosceles only, yeah? 
Yes, this technique only works 
reliably for an isoceles triangle—where 
two angles and two sides are the same. An 
equilateral triangle is an isoceles triangle 
with an extra matching side, so it works 
for those, too, but then they're pretty easy 
to spot. 
Q/ What if I only know the base and 
the side, or the base and the height? 
Sometimes that's all you need. Any 
time the base is greater than twice the 
height you know you've got an angle more 
than 90°.You really only need both for that 
tricky zone between 60° and 90°. 
But don't worry—if you've got two out of 
three for the base, side, and height lengths, 
you can use the good old Pythagorean 
Theorem to find the other. (This only works 
for right and isoceles triangles—don't 
try it on a scalene triangle or you'll come 
unglued.) 
OK—but how do I remember this? 
I'm bound to get mixed up about the 
base and sides and and which is greater 
and less than which! I'm not a computer 
you know.... 
It's almost certainly easier to 
remember the zones on the graph than it is 
to remember the inequalities. 
So, sketch that graph, mark what you know 
about the 60° and 90° triangles on it, and 
label the zones. 
Q/ Really? You think I could draw it 
just like that? 
Go on...give it a shot on a scrap of 
paper now. It's a really time efficient way to 
check your answers in an exam by the way.

triangle centers 
À triangle has more than one center 
Believe it or not, there are four common ways of finding the "center" of a triangle. 
CENTROID 
The centroid is the intersection of all 
three medians (lines from the midpoint 
of a side to the opposite vertex).

The orthocenter is the intersection 
of the altitudes drawn on all three 
sides. 
Altitude on AC 
Altitude on BC ^ 
Altitude

Altitudes go from a verte* to 
meet the opposite side, and 
ave perpendicular to that side-
e 
INCENTER 
The incenter is the center of the 
biggest circle you can draw inside 
the triangle. 
A line -from the inCenter 
to a vertex exactly bisects 
the angle at that vertex-

unusual centers 
The center of a triangle can be outside the triangle 
As crazy as it sounds, the circumcenter and orthocenter of a triangle can be 
outside the triangle. This only happens if the triangle is obtuse (one angle 
greater than 90°).

Let's put the drink stall at the centroid 
Outside the venue would be a pretty weird place to put your drinks stall, so it's 
important to pick a center which is always interior. 
The centroid also never gets pulled particularly close to one side or vertex, 
whereas the incenter can end up very far from one vertex if the triangle has 
sides of very different lengths. 
An interesting thing about the centroid is that it's where the triangle 
balances—this means that each median splits the triangle area into two equal 
halves.

Dumb Questions 
I drew an equilateral triangle 
and my centers were all in the same 
place—did I do it wrong? 
That's perfect! All the four centers 
of an equilateral triangle are in the same 
place. It's the only type of triangle that 
truly has a "middle." Centers of an isoceles 
triangle all fall on the altitude of the 
base—the line you might use to find the 
height. 
Q/ Do I really need to know four 
different centers—won't one do? 
There are actually over 3,500! These 
are the four you'll use the most, though. 
The centroid is used to balance a triangle 
in the physical world, but the other three all 
have uses. Each has different potential to 
find other things—a line from the incenter 
to any vertex of a triangle bisects that 
angle at that vertex, so you can use the 
incenter to find that angle if you need to. 
Why on earth would a center that 
lies outside the triangle be useful? 
The orthocenter and circumcenter 
only lie outside the triangle sometimes. 
If your triangle is acute then you might 
have need for a center that is exactly the 
same distance from all three corners, or 
one where a line to any side meets it at a 
right angle. It's totally dependent on what 
triangle you've got and what you're trying 
to do with it.

The two right triangles still work with the Pythagorean 
Theorem, and we know that x and y together make 30 (but 
aren't equal to each other) so we could figure this out with a set 
of three simultaneous algebra equations. If that sounds bad, 
it kinda is. Don't go there. But in case you're tempted, here's 
how it starts out:

You caw find area from sides using Hero's formula 
Fortunately there is a formula known as Hero's formula, or sometimes 
Heron's formula, which lets you find the area of a triangle when 
you only know the sides. First you find the semi-perimeter—half the 
perimeter—and then you just pop the numbers into your equation and 
wham, there's your area. Phew!

Fascinating. And really useful I'm 
sure, if you're trying to find area. But 
weren't we trying to find the height of 
that triangle? I don't think a detour into 
weird area formulas is what we need. 
Actually, it could be exactly what 
we need! 
One of the neat things about geometiy is 
the way everything links up. Like back 
in Chapter 1, when you proved Benny was 
innocent because you could find the angle two 
different ways, and they didn't match up. 
Hero's formula doesn't exist in a vacuum—it 
fits into all the tools you already have in your 
Geometiy Toolbox. And that's why it's a big 
help in finding not just area, but height as well... 
How could Hero's formula for triangle area also 
make it easy for you to find the triangle's height?

work back from area to find height 
How does Hero's formula for triangle area also 
make it easy for you to find the triangle's height? 
Using the other area -formula, area - 1/2- base * height-
So, you can use Hero to f ind area and then divide by half the base to get height-
Hero's formula and "VI base x height" work together 
If you know three sides of a scalene triangle, you can use Hero's formula to 
find the area, and then use the formula you already know to find the height. 
Area = //s (s-a) (s - b) (s - c) 
s =a + b + c

Sectors of a circle have angles totaling 360° 
When a circle is divided up using lines that pass through the center 
of the circle, the resulting "pizza slice" shapes are called sectors. 
The MegaSlice sectors each have 30° angles, so a full pizza from 
them would have to be 12 slices (30° X 12 = 360°). But they only 
give you 10 slices, which means their deal gives you less than a 
whole 12" pizza!

MegaSlice's *10 deal is a con! 
MegaSlice is only offering 10 of the 30° slices in a whole 12" pizza, so 
while they're offering a greater number of slices than Uncle Mario, 
it's actually less pizza overall than his deal! Now you've got the hard 
facts, there's no way MegaSlice can keep claiming to be a better value. 
Thanks! MegaSlice

Pepperoni crust pizza^but at what price? 
Mario's idea is to offer a pepperoni crust on any pizza. He wants to offer 
the best possible value to his customers so he'll only add the minimum 
price needed to cover the cost of the extra pepperoni. Sounds simple, 
right? But Mario has a problem with the sequence of events in the pizza 
process: 
Q 
The customer rings up with their order. 
@ 
Mario says how much it will be. 
Q 
Mario makes the pizza. 
The catch is...Mario's pizzas are custom sized! 
If Mario only offered a couple of pizza sizes you could just make 
the crust for each size once and then always add the cost of that 
amount. But Mario likes to give his customers as much choice as 
possible.

Mario needs a way to work out how many pieces of pepperoni it will 
take to edge a pizza, based only on the diameter of the pizza. Each 
piece of pepperoni is 1 inch across.

Your mission is to investigate the relationship between the diameter 
of each pizza and the "perimeter," or outside edge, of the pizza. How 
many pieces of pepperoni does Mario need to edge each pizza

In geometry terms, a circle's perimeter is called the circumference, 
and no matter how big or small that circle is, you can find the 
circumference by multiplying the diameter by the same number.

Dumb Questions 
When you showed the formula for circumference, you 
put ttD but also 2nr—does it matter which I use? 
D is diameter, and r is radius, so the two formulas always 
give the same answer since D = 2r. It doesn't matter which you 
use—it just depends on whether you've got the diameter or the 
radius available. 
Q/ So, in like two pages you've shown Pi as "just barely 
over three," 3.14159, a way-long decimal, and even 22/7... 
which is it? 
Pi is what is known as an irrational number. That means 
that even if you used a billion decimal places you couldn't write it 
down completely. Depending on what you're using Pi for you might 
need to use a more or less precise version of it. On an exam, you'll 
usually be told what to use, otherwise just take whatever your 
calculator gives you when you press the TT button, and remember to 
round your answer to fit with the question. 
OK, so Pi is really nothing more than 
a placeholder for the ratio between 
a circle's circumference and its 
diameter? I guess it's quicker than 
writing or saying 3.14159265358979 
32384626433832795...? 
Exactly. 
Math geeks talk about Pi as if it's kind of magic—and 
it's certainly pretty useful because it works for every 
circle, eveiy time—but really Pi is just a quick way of 
saying "that big long number that you get when you 
divide circumference by diameter."

Aw arc is a section of the circumference 
Covering part of the pizza crust with pepperoni creates an arc. That's 
geometryjargon for a section of the circumference of a circle—whether 
it goes almost all the way around a circle, or just a tiny part of it. 
Arcs can be described by the proportion of the circumference they 
cover—a semicircle covers half—or by the angle of the corresponding 
sector (the arc is the outside curved part of the sector). 
Arc length is circumference x sector angle / 360° 
To find the length of an arc, first you need to find the circumference of 
the circle the arc is part of. That means that you need either the diameter 
or radius of the circle. Then you can use the sector angle to find out the

really pretty different from the triangle base.

Frank: But, the more slices we chop the circle into, the nearer 
the arc length is to the triangle base length. So, eventually—if 
we chop the circle into like a million pieces—it's not an

Dumb Questions 
Q/ Eek—2nr and nr2 look pretty similar don't you think? Is 
there a way to keep them straight so I don't mix them up? 
There are a couple of tricks that might help you. First of all, if 
you can remember that circumference is also found from ttD then 
you can compare that and find which one matches (2ttr). Also, if you 
can remember that you learned about circumference before area, 
the 2 comes first on the circumference formula, and comes after in 
the area formula. 
Q/ What if I have to find just the area of a slice of pizza, 
and not the whole circle? 
Sector area is easy to find—just like you used its angle to 
find the length of an arc, you can use the sector angle to find sector 
area. Find the area of the circle then divide it by 360 (to find the 
area of a 1 degree sector) and multiply by the angle of your sector.

parallelograms 
The lawn is a parallelogram 
It kinda looks like a rectangle, but squished down so the sides are 
slanted. A parallelogram is a four-sided shape whose opposite 
sides are parallel to each other. 
A rectangle: 
Rectangles have two pairs of 
parallel sides. The parallel sides are 
also congruent. 
Each of the four corners forms a 
right angle. 
A parallelogram: 
Parallelograms have two pairs of 
parallel sides, too, and like a rectangle, 
the parallel sides are also congruent. 
Unlike a rectangle, the corners of a 
parallelogram aren't right angles. The 
most we can say is that opposite corner 
angles are congruent. 
So what should you charge? 
We need to calculate the charge for mowing a lawn in the shape 
of a parallelogram, and to do this, we need to work out the area. 
You know how to do that for a rectangle, but would that work for a 
parallelogram, too?

Let's split the parallelogram 
Vou UB s?llt a ?f ^ 
Think back to your work in previous chapters. When you needed 
to find the total area of a shape you were unfamiliar with, you split 
your shape up into other simpler shapes you were more familiar 
If you look carefully, you'll see that the parallelogram is actually 
made up of a central rectangle, with a right angle triangle on either 
end. This means that to find the area of the parallelogram, we can 
find the areas of these shapes, and then add them up together.

So how can we speed 
up the area calculation 
for a parallelogram? 
Jim: Well, a parallelogram is basically made up of just three 
shapes, a rectangle and two triangles. 
Frank: Yeah, but those two triangles look the same, right? So 
maybe they're congruent 
Joe: Nice! So we could calculate one triangle area, multiply by 
two, and then add on the area of the rectangle. 
Jim: That's still a few calculations per lawn, dull! 
Frank: True. So I wonder if we could take it any further? 
Joe: Maybe we can move these shapes around a bit. Gould 
we turn them into just one shape whose area we know how to 
calculate?

Dumb Questions 
Q/ What if I only have one pair 
of opposite sides? Do I still have a 
parallelogram? 
No. In order for a shape to be a 
parallelogram, both pairs of opposite sides 
must be parallel. If you only have one pair 
of opposite parallel sides, your shape isn't a 
parallelogram. 
Can I still use the same formula 
for finding the area for that shape? 
This formula is specific to 
parallelograms. But keep reading, 
we're going to cover more than just 
parallelograms and we might have just the 
formula you need. 
What if I only know the length of 
the sides of a parallelogram and not the 
height? Can I still work out the area? 
You can't, because you need to know 
what the height is. The reason for this is 
that the degree to which the parallelogram 
"slants" can make a big difference to the 
overall area. As an example, if the sides 
of a parallelogram are tilted so that they're 
almost horizontal, you'll have a much 
smaller area than if the sides are almost 
vertical. 
Q , ' But what if I have extra 
information such as the internal angles 
of the parallelogram? Can I work out the 
area then? 
Yes, it is possible to find out the area, 
but it takes a bit more work, not to mention 
some trigonometry! 
Q/ Are opposite sides always the 
same length? 
Yes they are, because opposite sides 
of a parallelogram are always congruent 
(same angle, same length). If opposite 
sides are different lengths, you don't have a 
parallelogram. 
Q/ What about opposite angles? They 
look the same to me. 
Yes, for parallelograms opposite 
angles are always congruent. Similarly, 
consecutive angles are supplementary. You 
can use the angle skills you developed 
earlier in the book to work this out.

You call these charges fair??? I've been 
timing you. It takes you way less time to mow 
my lawn than my neighbor's, but we're charged 
the same amount! If you don't come up with 
something better, I'll find someone else to 
do my lawn and tell your other clients that 
you're up to something.... 
S o w h a t w e n t w r o n g ? 
Both customers are charged the same amount, because 
their lawns must have the same area. But why does one 
lawn take longer to maintain than the other? 
\/o«*v ne*t t u s W v -

What other factors are involved? Why could it

it's not just area 
Let's compare the two lawns 
They should be the same, but let's see if we can track down what went 
wrong by comparing the areas of the two lawns. The angiy customer 
has a rectangular lawn, and his neighbor has a lawn in the shape of a 
parallelogram. 
Lawn 1-a rectangle 
36 meters 
20 meters 
Area of rectangle = 36 x 20 
= 720 meters2 
Lawn 2-a parallelogram 
45 meters 
Area of parallelogram = 4 5 x 1 6 
= 720 meters2 
34 meters

So the areas of both lawns 
are definitely the same. 
But you don't just mow the 
lawns, you edge them, too. I 
wonder if that has anything 
to do with it? 

quadrilaterals 
The lawns need edging, too 
Of course! When you mow lawns for Edward, you have to use an 
edger to trim where the grass ends, around the outside of each 
lawn. 
The edge of the lawn is the lawn's perimeter.

Same shape, different perimeters 
Your friends ran into a similar problem back in Chapter 4 when they 
were picking out a venue for the rock festival—the biggest field didn't 
necessarily have the most perimeter. For our lawn calculations, even if we 
know the area of a particular lawn, we can't make any assumptions about 
its perimeter or how long it will take to edge the lawn. And currently, 
Edward's charges are only based on lawn area. 
Same Area ^ Same Perimeter

Chapter 5 

quadrilaterals 
Q/ So it's not just triangles that have 
perimeter? 
No, not at all. The perimeter of a 
shape is basically the edge around the 
outside of a shape, whether it's a triangle, 
rectangle, parallelogram, or some other 
shape. 
Q/ Are there any shortcuts we can 
take in calculating the perimeter of a 
particular shape? 
It all depends on the shape. 
You calculate the perimeter of a shape by 
adding the lengths of all its sides together. 
You can take a few shortcuts if some of 
these sides are the same length. 
As an example, a square has four sides that 
are all the same length, so the perimeter of 
a square is just 4 times the length of one 
side. 
tWaiSre no 
Dumb Questions 
What about for a parallelogram? 
A parallelogram has two pairs of 
congruent sides, so there are two unique 
side lengths. You can find the perimeter of 
a parallelogram by adding these two unique 
side lengths together, and then multiplying 
by 2. 
What if two shapes have the same 
area and the same perimeter? Does this 
mean they're the same shape? 
Not automatically, no, you need 
more information. Many different shapes 
can have the same area and the same 
perimeter. 
Q/ More information? Like what? 
Well, a good starting point is if you 
know what sort of shapes you're dealing 
with. This will tell you how many sides your 
shapes have, and how many of these are 
congruent. 
As an example, if you're told you have two 
squares and they both have the same area, 
the squares must be congruent. This is 
because you calculate the area of a square 
by calculating (side length)2. The only way 
the squares can have the same area is if 
their sides are the same length. 
In general, if you know what type of shape 
you're dealing with, you can use the 
properties of the shape to help you deduce 
further facts.

diagonals 
The diagonals of a kite are perpendicular, 
but that's not all there is to say about them. 
For starters, one diagonal bisects the other, 
meaning it chops the other diagonal in half. 
It also bisects the pair of opposite angles, and 
if you look at the remaining pair of angles, 
they're congruent, too. So there's a lot you 
can know about a kite without having to do 
any calculations! 
Area and perimeter 
As you discovered earlier, you find the area of a kite by 
multiplying together the lengths of the two diagonals and 
dividing by two. To find the perimeter, remember that 
there are two pairs of congruent sides so you only have to 
add the two different sides together and multiply by two. 
Q/ So the diagonals of a kite 
are perpendicular. What about the 
diagonals of a parallelogram, are they 
perpendicular, too? 
In general, parallelograms don't have 
perpendicular diagonals. 
The diagonals of a parallelogram are 
still important though. If a shape is a 
parallelogram, then its diagonals bisect 
each other. Try adding diagonals to the 
parallelograms earlier in the chapter and 
you'll see what we mean. 
tJiereiflre no 
• Dumb Questions 
Q/ Could I have calculated the area 
of the kite by splitting it into simpler 
shapes like before? 
You could, but it would have taken 
you much longer to calculate. All you really 
need to do is multiply the two diagonals 
together and divide the result by 2. 
Q/ The kites we've looked at in this 
chapter look symmetrical. Is that a 
coincidence? 
No, not at all. Every kite is 
symmetrical along one diagonal. 
Q/ Can a shape be both a 
parallelogram and a kite? 
Yes it can. A shape is a parallelogram 
and a kite if it fits the description of both. 
In other words, it must have two pairs of 
separate adjacent congruent sides, and 
also the opposing sides must be parallel. 
This means that all four sides must be 
congruent. 
An example of a shape that is both a 
parallelogram and a kite is a square. All four 
sides are congruent, and opposite sides are 
parallel. We'll get to that in a little bit....

This week's interview: 
What's So Special A b o u t Trapezoids? 
Head First: Hey, Trapezoid, nice to have you on 
the show tonight. 
Trapezoid: It's a real pleasure. I don't seem to get 
out as much as some of the other shapes. 
Head First: What do you mean? 
Trapezoid: Well, everyone knows about Square and 
Rectangle, although they're kind of boring if you 
ask me. Kite gets good press because it looks like... 
well.. .a kite. But me? Everyone forgets about me. 
Head First: I notice that you didn't mention 
Parallelogram. Don't you guys have something in 
common? 
Trapezoid: Some would say we're family, and I 
guess you could say we're kinda like cousins. I have 
only one pair of parallel sides, and Parallelogram 
has two. But don't you think that's just being greedy? 
Parallelogram's just a lopsided, funny-looking 
Rectangle if you ask me, and I don't limit myself like 
that. 
Head First: But aren't you just like Triangle but 
with one of the points chopped off? 
Trapezoid: That's one way you could talk about 
me, yes, but the key thing is that I have one pair of 
parallel sides, and Triangle doesn't. Um, I wouldn't 
talk to Triangle about that, he's still a bit sensitive. 
BULLET POINTS 
Head First: But don't you have one nice thing in 
common with Triangle? 
Trapezoid: You did your research, didn't you? 
We've all heard of an Isosceles Triangle, right? Well, 
Trapezoids can be Isosceles, too. 
Head First: What's special about that? 
Trapezoid: It's still a Trapezoid, but with congruent 
legs. And by legs I mean the sides that aren't bases. 
Isosceles Trapezoid is a bit more regular than me, 
there's more symmetry about him. He's thinking 
about getting into modeling, from what I hear. At the 
very least, it must make shaving much easier. 
Head First: What about diagonals? 
Trapezoid: Wiat about them? Sure, I have them, 
but I can't say much about them. Now Isosceles 
Trapezoid, he has congruent diagonals, and he has 
some congruent angles, too. Some guys have all the 
luck. 
Head First: Well, that's all we have time for, 
Trapezoid, thanks for stopping by. 
A trapezoid is a four-sided shape 
with one pair of parallel sides called 
bases. 
Since the bases are parallel, this 
means that you have two pairs of 
supplementary angles. 
An isosceles trapezoid is a trapezoid 
with congruent "legs." The lower 
base angles are congruent, the upper 
base angles are congruent, and the 
diagonals are congruent, too.

quad 
relationships 
The quadrilateral family tree 
There's one key thing that the shapes in this chapter all have in 
common—they all have four sides. 
Any shape that has four straight sides is a quadrilateral. 
Parallelograms, kites, and trapezoids are all part of the 
quadrilateral family, along with shapes such as squares and 
rectangles. Here's the quadrilateral family tree so you 
can see how they're all related. 
The arrows show you the 
hierarchy 
The thick arrows on the family 
tree show you the relationships 
between the shapes. Any shape 
at the end of an arrow is a more 
specialized form of the shape that 
the arrow is coming from. So a 
kite is a type of quadrilateral since 
it shares the same properties as 
a quadrilateral—it has four sides, 
with two pairs of separate adjacent 
sides. Similarly, a square is type of 
rhombus, which means it is also a 
type of kite. 
The family tree also shows you 
which shapes are not, directly related. 
That means a kite is not a type of 
parallelogram and a rectangle is 
not a type of trapezoid.

Dumb Questions 
Q/ So how does knowing which 
different quadrilaterals relate to each 
other help me? 
Some shapes can be classified as 
more than one type of quadrilateral, and 
if you know which groups each shape 
belongs to, you can use the properties of 
each group to help you calculate things like 
area and perimeter. 
Q/ But surely a shape can only be in 
one group at a time? 
No, it's really a hierarchy. As an 
example, a square isn't just a square, it's 
also a kite as it has two pairs of adjacent 
sides. 
Q.: 
length. 
Yes, but because it has two pairs of 
adjacent sides that are equal, that makes 
it a kite, too. Another way of looking at it 
is that a kite with four right angle corners 
where the sides are all the same length is 
called a square. 
But all four sides are the same 
Q; But how does this really help me? 
If a shape belongs to a group then 
you can find the area and perimeter using 
the formulas for that group. As an example, 
suppose you have a square and all you 
know about it is the length of the diagonals. 
How would you go about finding the area? 
One approach would be to calculate the 
sides of the square using the length of 
the diagonal. The area would then be 
the square of the side length. A simpler 
approach, however, would be to remember 
that a square is also a kite, and use the 
kite formula to find the area. In other words, 
multiply the diagonals together and divide 
by 2. 
So what's a rhombus? 
Oh, I get it. If I can remember 
how all the quadrilaterals relate to one 
another, I can save time calculating 
things like area. 
Absolutely! 
Q: 
A rhombus is quadrilateral where all 
four sides are the same length. It's a bit like 
a skewed square. 
Oh, I see. So does that mean that 
a square is a rhombus, too? 
Well done! Yes, that's totally right. 
But remember, the reverse isnt necessarily 
true. Just because a square is a rhombus, 
it doesn't mean that every rhombus is also 
a square. 
Q , ' So is a trapezoid a type of 
parallelogram? 
A parallelogram has to have two 
pairs of parallel sides, and a trapezoid 
has to have exactly one pair of parallel 
sides. This means that a trapezoid is not a 
parallelogram, as trapezoids don't have two 
pairs of parallel sides. 
Q/ The family tree shows that a 
parallelogram is not a type of trapezoid. 
In another book, I saw a diagram where 
the two are shown as related. Why's 
that? 
A I That's an interesting question. 
We've defined a trapezoid as having 
exactly one pair of parallel sides. Since 
a parallelogram has two pairs of parallel 
sides, it doesn't meet the requirements for 
being in the trapezoid club. It has too many 
pairs of parallel sides. 
Sometimes other people define a trapezoid 
as having at least one pair of parallel sides. 
If you define a trapezoid in this way, then 
a parallelogram is a type of trapezoid, as it 
has more than one pair of parallel sides. 
Q/ I've heard of a trapezium, too. 
What's one of those? 
A I It all depends where in the world you 
are. 
In the U.S., a trapezium is a quadrilateral 
with no parallel sides. 
Outside the U.S., a trapezium is the name 
given to a shape with one pair of parallel 
sides—what people in the U.S. call a 
trapezoid.

Life's full of compromises, but you don't have to be restricted to triangles, squares, and 
circles. Regular polygons give you the flexibility to demand exactly the shape you need. 
But don't think that means learning a list of new formulas: you can treat 6-, 16-, and 
60-sided shapes the same. So, whether it's for your own creative project, some required

All the hot tubs are regular polygons 
The local hot tub suppliers have said they'll rush through an order 
for any hot tub in their range—all of which they describe as regular 
polygons. The word regular is another way of saying equilateral— 
all the sides are the same length—but it means the polygons have 
some other useful properties as well.

how much 
water? 
Is $ cubic meters of water a lot or a little? 
Typical engineer. Instead of giving you the amount of water in 
terms of a measure that might actually make some sense, like 
cups or spoonfuls or gallons, he's talking about cubic meters. So, 
how much is 3 cubic meters of water? A bathful? A pondful? A 
swimming poolful? 
Let's start by think about what just 1 cubic meter actually is: 
Volume of a cube = length x width x depth 
Cubic meter = 1m x 1m x 1m 
= 1m3 
A cube-shaped container with length, width, and 
depth all of one meter holds exactly one cubic 
meter of water. 
So 3 cubic meters of water is the volume of water 
you could store in three of those one meter cubes: 
3 cubic meters = 
l m

Chapter 7

T h a t ' s t r u e . 
In fact, thinking about cube shapes can only take us 
so far, because, aside from the square-shaped one, 
the hot tub range isn't made out of cubes. 
How do the hot tubs compare to a cube? 
Like a cube, all the hot tubs have a uniform depth. They 
also have straight sides at a right angle to the base. But for 
most of the shapes of hot tub, calculating the volume using 
length X width X depth would give you the volume of a 
box that you could fit the hot tub inside, not the water that 
the hot tub would contain. It might be handy, but it's not 
what we're looking for!

Dumb Questions 
Q/ This book is called Head First 2D 
Geometry, right? So how come we're 
talking about 3D in this chapter? 
Volume is definitely a 3D topic, and 
we cover it in much more detail in Head 
First 3D Geometry, but it's not too bad to 
dip your toes in the water is it? Also, we're 
about to turn this problem back into a 2D 
one on the next page. 
Q/ You're going to turn a 3D problem 
into a 2D problem? How does that 
work? 
The third dimension in the hot tubs 
problem is depth. Once we don't have to 
work with the depth anymore it's just a 2D 
problem we're left with. Hold that thought 
to the bottom of the next page. 
What if the tub was deeper at 
one end than the other? Or had curved 
sides? 
The area * depth formula only 
applies to 3D shapes with straight sides, all 
of the same depth, which are perpendicular 
to the base. If the hot tub was deeper 
at one end we'd need a different way of 
working out its volume.

Dumb Questions 
regular 
polygons 
Q/ Half a meter per butt? Really? 
OK, so we all know that butt-size is one of life's interesting 
variables. Obviously not all butts are the same size, but in this 
problem that's not too important. Even if you had a bunch of people 
with more generously proportioned butts, you'd still fit more into the 
biggest perimeter, so it's still a useful comparison. 
Q / 1 9 butts or 19.6 butts? I've never met anyone with 0.6 of 
a butt. 
That's true, you'd really round down to 19. Only whole butts 
can get in the tub (unless you count a really skinny one as a 0.6). 
That 0.6 gives a little extra room to the 19 folk in there though, so it's 
worth keeping those decimals in case we end up choosing between 
two tubs which both have butt counts between 19 and 20. 
Is 19.6 butts a lot or a little? 
One number on its own isn't enough to choose a hot tub— 
you want the MOST possible butt-space for your 6 square 
meters of area. You need to tackle the other hot tubs shapes 
to find out if they're better or worse than the square tub.

Dumb Questions 
Q/ Why bother learning another 
formula? Won't I be covered if I just 
know Hero's formula and the "1/2 base 
x height" version? 
Any time you use Hero's formula 
to work on a equilateral triangle you're 
gonna wind up doing all the math we just 
did anyway. If you can learn the equilateral 
triangle area formula then you won't need to 
do all that algebra again! 
Q/ But what if I wanted to use "1/2 
base x height." I thought in geometry it 
didn't matter how you work stuff out, the 
answer should be the same? 
That's true, and starting from 1/2 
base x height, you'd have ended up with 
the exact same formula. You just have to do 
more work to get there. First you'd need to 
use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the 
sides in terms of the height, and then you'd 
need to do some simultaneous equations to 
put it all together. It would definitely work but 
there's a lot more to go wrong. 
Q / O K , so this formula only works 
for equilateral triangles? What about 
triangles that are nearly equilateral? 
^ \ You could use it to approximate area 
for a triangle with sides of similar length, but 
it wouldn't be accurate. It's a good way to 
check your answer in an exam though. Pick 
the middle side length, work the equilateral 
triangle area formula and it should come out 
in the same ball park. If your two answers 
are 9 and 10, you're all good; if they're 9 
and 50, you know you need to check your 
work.

A nice idea. Except we don't know 
anything about those triangles. We 
don't know base and height or side lengths! 
Without those we can't find the area. Even 
Hero's formula can't rescue this one....

we're going to need to know more about these triangles

What do we need to know about 
the polygon triangles? 
We know that there are the same number of triangles as sides of 
the polygon, and we know that all the triangles are congruent so 
we just need to find the area of one. But what else do we need to 
know to find the triangle's area, so that we can combine them to 
find the total polygon area? 
Where do we get 
these? 
Where do we get 
these? 
Well, we used the fact that a circle is 
like a polygon to find the circle area formula. 
So, doesn't that mean that a polygon is like a 
circle, too? Or at least there's a connection 
between circles and polygons and these 
triangle segments? Could that help? 
That's an interesting connection. 
If a circle is like a polygon, the reverse must also be true 
on some level: a polygon is (kinda) like a circle. Maybe 
this idea can help us find what we need to calculate the 
polygon area and choose the perfect hot tub?

Dumb Questions 
A circle is just a polygon with 
infinite sides? Have you gone a bit 
philosophical or what? 
Some math geeks get a bit upset 
about this definition of a circle, but if you 
could draw enough sides then you'd be 
approaching a circle. The whole point of 
infinity is that you never get there, but you 
get close enough for this to be the basis of 
computer graphics. 
Q / 
Computer graphics? Polygons? 
How does that work? 
A-
J r \ • To show 3D curvy worlds, all video 
games rely on triangles, which build into 
polygons, which fool our eyes into believing 
we're seeing circles and curves. 
Q j ! Ah! Yeah, when I've zoomed 
in real close to something in a game 
sometimes I've seen that it's made out 
of flat shapes. 
That's it—exactly. 
Q/ Circumradius sounds a lot like 
radius, but in the comparison of the area 
formulas you compared apothem to 
radius. That's kind of confusing! 
^ \ Actually a regular polygon's 
circumradius is sometimes just referred 
to as its radius. But if you think about it, a 
circle's apothem and its circumradius can 
both be equal to its radius (if the apothem 
is going right to the edge). So when we 
compared the apothem and the circle's 
radius, we were comparing an apothem to 
an apothem! 
Q / Does the polygon area formula 
work for all regular polygons? Even 
squares and triangles? 
^ \ The polygon area formula works for 
any regular polygon—whether it's got 3 
sides or an infinite number! But you've got 
some much sharper tools in your tool box for 
finding square and triangle areas, and they'll 
always be quicker and easier to use, so it's 
best to keep this one for regular polygons 
with five sides or more. 
Q; 
Regular polygons only? This 
area formula won't work with irregular 
polygon? 
Sadly not. Irregular shapes are harder 
to deal with anyway. When you split them 
into triangles the triangles aren't congruent. 
Very high maintenance. Luckily they don't 
come up in exams much! 
Q; 
Apothem. Let me guess, that 
means in an algebra version of the 
formula that would be an "a"? But we're 
already using "a" for area—why couldn't 
they have named it something with a 
different first letter? 
Good question. We don't have an 
answer—except that if you remember your 
formulas as words rather than just letters 
then it doesn't matter so much. If you're 
sitting a test and you want to demonstrate 
that you know the formula, write it out in 
words and then make it clear which letters 
you're picking as stand-ins. Whether you 
use a, A, s, or t for something is less 
important than what it means. It's also easier 
to work out whether a formula applies to a 
problem when you remember your formulas 
as words and not just letters.

A c t u a l l y , i t m i g h t . 
It's not a bad suggestion at all. We have plenty of triangle-
related tools in our toolbox, so when we're faced with a 
problem we can't already solve, looking for ways to make it 
about triangles is a great starting point. Let's give it a go. 
We know we can divide the hexagon tub into six congruent 
triangles. From this, can you find: 
1) The total of all the angles of those "sector" triangles. 
2) The angle that the carpenters need to build the wood 
frame for the hot tub: the internal angle of the polygon.

We know we can divide the hexagon tub into six congruent 
triangles. From this, can you find: 
1) The total of all the angles of those "sector" triangles. 
2) The angle that the carpenters need: the internal angle of 
the polygon. 
I) Angles in a triangle add up to ISO0 
There are six triangles so the total angles are: 
6 % ¡90° — ¡090° 
2.) The six angles in the middle add up to Zi>0° 
So the total of all the internal angles is the 
total angles minus the six angles in the middle - 
¡000° - U>0° - 110c 
It's a regular polygon, so the angles are equal — 12-0° — 12.0° 
h 
Internal angles of a polygon follow a pattern 
A polygon can always be divided into the same number of triangular 
sectors as it has sides. And every triangle has angles totaling 180°. 
That's the key to finding the internal angles of a polygon: 
Total angles in the 
triangles = 
180° x number of sides 
Angles which aren't 
part of the internal 
angles = 360°

The total area of the hot tub is 6 square meters. Use what 
you know about the hexagon hot tub angles to find the length 
of each side of the hot tub. (Hint: it helps if you split it into 
those sector triangles!) 
Hint—look back at page

The total area of the hot tub is 6 square meters. Use what 
you know about the hexagon hot tub angles to find the length 
of each side of the hot tub. 
These & triangles are the same (congruent). Each one must have 
an area o-f I square meter. 
The angles in the middle add up to Zt>0°, so this angle here must 
be ¿0°. 
An isosceles triangle 
has two equal sides, 
Each internal angle is \10°—and we know the triangle is 
and two equal angles. 
ISOSCELES because the side lengths are both equal to the 
CirCumradius o-f the polygon, so the other angles must both be 
l2-0 0/2- - t>0°. 
Each I sq meter triangle is EQUILATERAL 
So we tan use the equilateral triangle area -formula.' 
t is side length.

It's time to relax in the hot tub! 
You've earned it. Not only have you picked the perfect hot tub to 
please both the environmental engineers and the bands, you've 
even managed to sort out the exact angles and dimensions for the 
carpenters to get ready to install it immediately! 
Along the way you've created a bunch of new tools for your 
Geometiy Toolbox, and discovered how lots of your tools can 
work together to solve really complex problems. 
Now—has anybody seen those rubber ducks?
