All known colour contrasts become greater on the luminescent medium of a screen. 
Every colour and design concept should therefore be tested at real size and in different
lighting conditions. See also Chapter 9: Developing Designs for Small Screens.
To ensure that colours can be easily
distinguished, they must be displayed
on a surface that is large enough: 
the more subtle the colour, the larger
the space needed to display it.
Colour codes such as the traffic light
analogy are clearly visible and easy to
understand even on small screens. 
The saturation of a colour on the luminescent medium of a screen must
be used very sparingly. The rule of thumb is that the larger the surface
area, and the longer the time spent looking at the screen, then the less
saturated the colour should be. This is mainly due to the tiring of the
user’s eyes that can lead to unpleasant afterimages. If colour saturation 
is used sparingly, an increase in saturation can then be used to mark
different priorities in the content. 
It is very useful to use colour for coding purposes. Colour can represent a
code for different action routines, for example, green for approval, red for
rejection and yellow for warnings. Colour can also be used to distinguish
different types of content or applications. However, human beings do not
have an absolute colour memory, so only a limited number of clearly
distinguishable colours should be used in any one design; the colours
should then be supplemented by an alternative form of identification such
as an icon. Problems can arise if colour coding is used simultaneously for
routine actions and content categories within an application.
The colour selection and scales used must be clearly distinguishable in
order to avoid confusion, for example, by using less saturated colour
shades on larger background areas to mark the categories, and using a
fewer highly-saturated colours to denote routine actions.
A unique problem on small-screen devices is that the available space in
which to display colours greatly limits the perception of the colour shade.
The smaller the area that is to be highlighted, the clearer the colours must
be in the colour code, which means that the number of available colours 
is lower.
Another colour principle that must be taken into account when designing
screen interfaces is simultaneous contrast. This describes a shift in the
perceived colour value, and plays an important role in the legibility of 
a colour code. Depending on the colour environment, a shade can shift in
such a way that it may no longer be clearly assigned. Dark blue on a white
background, for example, may be difficult to differentiate from black on 
a white background. Equally, what at first appears to be a neutral grey
colour may unintentionally appear as a violet colour if it is displayed next
to green.

An increase in saturation can be used

The absolute brightness contrast
should always be more than 50%; if
necessary this value should be
checked by converting the colours to
a greyscale. 
Colour on small screens
Some of the first colour screens used very strong colours; the possibility
of using colour led to much exaggeration and a number of almost
overpowering initial designs. The fact that small-screen devices are used
for shorter periods and with less user concentration than their full-sized
counterparts means that the designer must primarily use colour as a
means to make the operation of the device as simple as possible.
Therefore, colour should be used to direct the user’s focus so that they
can quickly distinguish what is important and what is unimportant and so
be swifter to make their interaction decisions. 
The effect of colour contrast and brightness also plays an important role
on small-screen interfaces. To understand the interaction concept, the
screen must be easy to read, even under adverse conditions. An important
consideration for legibility on both large and small screens is the contrast
in brightness.
Colour is displayed on the screen by mixing the three primary colours of
red, green and blue in an additive mixture. Colours generated by additive
colour mixing are characterised by the fact that their resulting secondary
colours will be significantly brighter than the primary colours because extra
light will have been transmitted. This will serve to exaggerate or distort
the intrinsic brightness of colour families, and affects the contrasts
between different colours and combinations of colour on the screen. Any
important content should be displayed with an absolute brightness
contrast value that is in excess of 50%.
Brightness and contrast can be used systematically to enhance the the
depth of the screen. This means that content that is in the background or
is currently inactive should appear darker in colour and with lower contrast
and colour saturation. Content that is currently in use, such as dialogue
windows or pop-up menus, should appear brighter and have higher
contrast and colour saturation. These principles support figure/ground
perception and also helps the user to grasp the structure and interaction
of the system quickly.
Spatial impact can be further enhanced by a systematic selection of the
colour family. Cold colours can be used to visually form the background,
whereas warmer colours tend to appear in the foreground and closer 
to the user. 
Nowadays smaller screens can display an increasing number of colours. Originally only
black and white was available; this progressed to greyscale, and then colour screens.
The first colour displays only had a limited range of 16 colours, but nowadays 18 bit
screens with more than 200,000 colour shades are available. It is likely that true colour,
with its colour depth capacity of 24 bit or 32 bit, will soon be available for use on small-
screen devices, thus providing designers the same colour capabilities that they have on
larger screens. 
To check the contrast and brightness that a design offers, it is helpful to convert it to greyscale. This enables the designer
to check the values irrespective of the colours selected. See also Chapter 9: Developing Designs for Small Screens.
Basic design exercise
Develop a colour scheme that allows three different hierarchical levels to be displayed 
simultaneously. Then find a suitable colour with which text can be displayed so that it is 
clearly legible. 
When selecting colours for the digital
medium, the intrinsic brightness of
colours in the RGB colour scale must
be taken into account – these are
different from the brightness effect of
CMYK colours. 
(This difference cannot be shown
adequately in print, so the shift in
contrast is demonstrated here with a
brightness scale.)

How to get the most out of this book
Not all design concepts that are valid on larger screens can be
successfully implemented on smaller ones. A multitude of devices, with
very dissimilar technical specifications, fall under the category of those
with ‘small-screen interfaces’, and all these devices differ in size and in
their type of display, mode of user interaction and level of performance. 
To simplify the complex issues surrounding small-screen interface design,
so that they can be visualised and utilised easily, we have structured the
book into nine chapters. Each one serves as a complete entity, which
allows you to ‘dip’ in and out of the book’s content if you wish to do so.
Each of these chapters is then broken down into three sections.

absolute brightness contrast of 50% should be exceeded for all important
content on the screen.
Brightness and contrast can be used systematically to enhance the the

There are also physiological reasons that affect the choice of colour.

W21S (Sony Ericsson, au by KDDI):
in order to shorten navigation paths
through different menu levels, the first
two levels are tied together as a 
crossing. Moving vertically is switching
within the second navigational level
while moving horizontally is switching
within the main menu.
The lack of space on smaller screens means that the quest for the
dynamic organisation of the space is one of the most challenging aspects
associated with the design process. 
040|041 The Screen
The collapse-to-zoom concept 
first offers a thumbnail preview 
in which the user can select a
specific item of interest and 
display it. 
It is difficult or impossible to view
normal websites on a small screen.
Fishnet concept: in this concept, parts
of the page are compressed to enable
the whole page to be displayed. Search
strings are shown as pop-up menus,
even in the compressed section, and
one can select from them directly.

Lee, and Hanna, 2004)
Navigation System XYZ (Sony): 
a motion blur in cross-fading enables
different zoom levels to be combined. 
Collapse-to-zoom enables columns
within a layout to be temporarily
compressed so that other parts of 
the content have more space.

Nokia 6310: with 96x65 pixels
displayed on a surface of 30x22mm
we will see a different resolution for 
the horizontal and the vertical direction.
The size of the individual pixel is
0.3125x0.3846 mm. Different
dimensions for the height and width 
of a pixel are quite common for low-
resolution displays.
Palm Zire 71: at a resolution of 144 dpi
we find 320x320 pixels on a surface 
of 56.4x56.4mm. The actual size of a
pixel here is 0.16x0.16 mm.
The abbreviations for screen sizes are a

Screens are defined both by their physical size and
the number of pixels they can display. The ratio of
pixels per inch (ppi) is referred to as the resolution
of the display. So if we want to define what small
screens are, a combination of these two parameters
must be taken into account.
Today a screen is considered ‘small’ if it supports
fewer than 307,20 pixels. This is equal to a
resolution of 640x480 pixels (VGA) or a diagonal
screen size of approximately 11 inches at 72 dpi.
The actual resolution value is growing steadily.
While 72 dpi used to be considered the standard,
resolutions of 144 dpi are quite common today,
especially amongst smaller screens. We can expect
to see even higher resolutions in the future, and the
individual pixel will soon be beyond the capacity of
the human eye.

The first section of each chapter is dedicated to a theoretical reflection of
the issue in question, and provides an overview of the various design
options that relate to this issue.
The second section of each chapter offers examples of good practice and
shows how the theory of the first section can be practically applied.
The third section of each chapter offers supplementary information, such
as the technological basics that will help you to make informed design
decisions. This information is accompanied by statistics on user behaviour
and glossaries that decodes technical jargon, terminology and acronyms.
For better understanding and where applicable individual glossary entries
can be found in order of logical succession, otherwise the entries appear
in alphabetical order
To aid navigation through this book, each of the three sections is 
colour-coded. Wherever useful tips, hints, complementary or further
information can be found, we have listed cross-references to other chapters
or sections of the book. A navigation bar positioned at the bottom of the
page eases access to the chapters and sections, and helps you to locate
linked information.
The individual chapters also contain questions and assignments that
challenge you to be creative and develop conceptual or formal designs for
small screens.

LCD: liquid crystal displays do not
generate any light. Instead the display
can be illuminated either by reflecting
light from the environment, or by a light
source positioned behind the display. 
It is also possible to combine these two
principles; the rear lighting of LCD
displays is not yet bright enough to be
clearly legible in bright sunshine, but it
can be blinding when it is used in the
dark. This can be compensated by a
brightness sensor and separate darker
graphics for use by night. 
OLED: organic light-emitting diodes
have the advantage that they generate
light themselves. This makes them much
flatter, brighter and less expensive 
than LCDs.
SOLED: stacked organic light-emitting
diodes lay the three colours of the
additive colour mixtures one over the
other, which makes the colour rendering
more precise and the resolution 
much finer.

The Screen
NTT DoCoMo Interactive Streetmap:
by using Flash, it is possible to create
dynamic interfaces that are graphically
more attractive. Information can be
processed visually and other forms of
interaction are possible. The technique
of zooming combined with a strong
abstraction of the presentation make it
possible to present this complex
information, even on a small screen.
The small-screen device has evolved into an independent and well-
established output medium. The processor performance, screen resolution
and colour depth that are now available, offer considerable freedom of
design. Whilst the devices remain compact, the technology supporting 
small-screens has indeed grown-up. As a result, an increasing number of
full-size applications are now transferring to the small screen.
Navigation System H9000 (Mitsubishi):
for viewing complex information such 
as maps, the viewing distance, and
therefore the zoom level, must be 
changed frequently on smaller screens.

012|013 Introduction
Introduction
Since the invention of the transistor, miniaturisation has been the main
phenomenon that has distinguished electronics from all other areas of 
technology. We have grown used to the fact that computers and 
computerised devices have become ever smaller and increasingly
powerful. Portable laptop computers could soon replace desktop PCs
as the computers that are used for most applications. 
Nowadays, there is an increasing number of devices that are even
smaller than laptops. In fact, they are as small as current technology
allows, and as big as the respective application requires. For example, if
we are to be accessible by telephone at all times, then clearly the
telephone must be small enough for us to take it with us wherever we go.
The same applies to electronic address books, jotting pads, digital
cameras or combined devices that include all of these functions. All of
these devices are specialised computers to a greater or lesser extent.
When we speak of ‘personal’ computers we immediately think of a
monitor, a keyboard and a mouse, but we will soon have to change our
way of thinking. It is so much more ‘personal’ to have a device that never
leaves our side because it is so small, light and portable. Even though
computers in mobile-phone format still raise a smile in comparison with
the muscle power (expressed in gigabytes and gigahertz), of their static
competition, the advantages of a ‘really’ personal computer are
nevertheless obvious. 
Just as the concept of the personal computer was dismissed in the late
1970s as a fancy gadget, contemporary devices are still underestimated
today – simply because they are small. 

 
Whether this new revolution of small devices will be successful depends
largely on whether the interface can shrink to keep pace with the 
hardware. At present, the miniaturisation of computer hardware stands in
stark contrast to the development of the computer software. Bigger and
bigger monitors, with an ever higher resolution, have tempted developers
to be increasingly wasteful of screen space in applications on standard
personal computers.
The strategies of software design can only be transferred from the ‘big’
devices to their ‘small’ counterparts to a very limited extent. This means
that the development of the user interface is the crucial factor in the
design process, just as it was in the development of the first generation of
personal computers. That is why we believe that this book is necessary –
to equip young designers with concepts to help them face this challenge.

In this section we explain the relationship between time
and technological advancement, in accordance with
Moore’s Law. This is coupled with a short glossary of
terms and a detailed explanation of battery types.
In these two combined sections we have created a visual
timeline that charts the development of technological
devices, both portable and desktop. As technology has
evolved so too has the implementation of miniaturisation
and the sophistication of functionality.

1936: the Zuse Z1 is the first program-
controlled binary computer. It is mainly relay
based and can perform eight different
commands: read numbers from memory, write
numbers to memory, decimal-binary conversion,
binary-decimal conversion, addition,
subtraction, multiplication and division.
1927: the first transatlantic phone call
1876: sees the birth of the telephone.
The first historical words spoken by
Alexander Graham Bell on the night of
the 10th March are: “Mr. Watson, come
here; I want you!” 
1921: the combination of the telephone
and radio enables officers at the Detroit
Michigan Police Department to 
communicate with each other from patrol
car to patrol car. 
1894: Italian Guglielmo
Marconi invents the radio.
1946: AT&T Corporation
launches the first commercial
mobile telephone service for
private customers.
1947: William Shockley invents
the ‘transfer resistance
device’, later known as the
transistor. It revolutionises the
incorporated electronics and
gives the transistor a reliability
that could not be achieved with
vacuum tubes.
1946: John von Neumann
creates a Computing Machine
that uses a single-storage
structure to hold both the set 
of instructions on how to
perform the computation and
the data required or generated
by the computation. Most
modern computers still use 
this architecture.
1938: Canadian Al Gross, invents the
walkie-talkie. Eleven years later he also
patents the telephone pager, which 
did not become a great success until
the 1970s. 
1928: in London, John Logie Baird performs
the world’s first colour image transmission.
1935: the first phone call around the world
The small, portable devices of today would not be possible without some of the
inventions and advances of the last 130 years. The roots of this development lie in
communication media and devices such as the telephone and radio, and in the inventions
of information technology, for example, transistors and personal computers. The
miniaturisation of hardware, in combination with digital and wireless transmission 
technology allows mobile and personal devices, which can accompany us at all times.

1973: Sharp releases the EL-805
LCD calculator, starting a
revolution in electronics. Until now,
calculators used fluorescent
character display tubes or light-
emitting diodes. Using LCD for the
number display means that the
power consumption is cut
dramatically to a mere 1% of the
consumption of previous calculators.
This astonishing leap in energy
efficiency provides 100 hours of
use from a single AA battery.
1968: Douglas Engelbart invents an
‘X-Y Position Indicator’ to assist user
navigation on a computer screen.
Twenty years later, as the computer
mouse, it becomes the standard
input device for personal computers. 
1968: Alan Kay’s Dynabook is
heralded as a vision of a portable
computer that everybody can use. 
It is to be so simple that even a child
could operate the device. 
The technology to implement such a
product does not yet exist, but the
Dynabook is the forerunner of the
laptop and PDA. Other contributions by
Alan Kay and his team at Xerox PARC
include the graphical user interface,
the laser printer, the client server
network model, Ethernet and object-
oriented programming.
1971: American scientist James
Fergason discovers the ‘twisted-
nematic’ LCD. He produces the first
practical displays in 1969 and 
submits an application for the patent
in 1971. One of the first customers is
the Gruen watchmaking company.
1972: Motorola presents the design for
its portable radio telephone ‘DynaTAC’
(Dynamic Adaptive Total Area Coverage).
This prototype of the world’s first
commercial portable telephone uses
cellular radio technology. Dr. Martin
Cooper, a former general manager of
the systems division at Motorola, is
considered to be the inventor of the first
portable handset and the first person to
make a call on a portable cell phone in
April 1973. The first call he makes is to
his rival, Joel Engel, who is the head of
research at Bell Labs.
1969: sees the birth of the 
internet. The ‘Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency’
(DARPA) begins the DARPA
internet programme.
1971: the computer engineer Ray
Tomlinson invents internet-based 
electronic mail, making it possible 
to send messages to another person 
over a network. The first e-mail 
message sent is ‘QWERTYUIOP’.
1963: Ivan Edward Sutherland invents
the Sketchpad, which makes it
possible to create graphic images
directly on to a display screen via the
use of a hand-held object such as a
light pen.
1963: Bell Labs 
introduce the touch-tone
telephone to replace 
rotary dial telephones.
This paves the way for 
telephone services such
as short text messaging.
1962: Telstar is the first
active communications satellite
in space.

1976: the Apple Computer
company is created in 
a Californian garage by
school friends Steven
Wozniak and Steve Jobs.
1977: the Commodore PET 2001
enters the market in the USA and
is an immediate success. It is a
computer developed for the
private sphere rather than for 
commercial use. ‘PET’ is an 
acronym for ‘Personal Electronic
Transactor’. Its 9-inch screen
has 320x200 pixels.
1980: Nintendo’s Game & Watch console, Ball, 
is the world’s first commercially successful
mobile LCD screen game.
1981: IBM brings the personal computer on to
the market. Its hardware architecture becomes
the industry standard and the abbreviation ‘PC’
is a recognised term for desktop computers. Its
operating system MS-DOS is the foundation
stone on which Bill Gates will build his Microsoft
empire. This PC has a four-colour screen and a
resolution of 320x200 pixels.
1981: Adam Osborne develops the first
portable computer. The Osborne I weighs 
24 pounds, costs $1,795 and features 
64 kilobytes of memory. Its 5-inch screen 
has 52x24 pixels.
1973: researchers at the the Xerox Palo Alto
Research Center develop the Xerox Alto, the first PC
prototype with a graphical user interface. But this
user-friendly system with icons, menus, 
cascading windows and dialogue boxes will only be 
commercially marketed in 1981 with the Xerox Star.
Its 17-inch screen has 1024x800 pixels.
1984: the Psion 1 is 
recognised as the first PDA
(Personal Digital Assistant). It
features a clock, a calendar,
an address book and a
calculator.
1984: the Apple Macintosh begins its 
victorious march around the world and 
launches the concept of desktop publishing.
Its 9-inch screen has 512x342 pixels.
1979: sees the introduction of the TPS-L2 
Sony Walkman. The first portable audio- 
cassette player.
1978: the first 1G telephone system 
is launched in America
1982: the first digital phone
exchange in Europe
1980: sees the introduction of the world’s 
smallest and cheapest computer – the
Sinclair ZX80.It measures 9x7 inches and
costs £99.95. In order to keep the price so
low the designers had to introduce some
radical ideas to reduce the number of 
components. The biggest saving is the use 
of a domestic television set as a monitor 
and a cassette player as a program and 
data-storage device.
1982: Nintendo brings out the
first portable Game & Watch
console with two screens of
5.3x3.5 mm each.

1985: sees the first portable phone.
This device incorporated a handset, an
antenna and a power pack and is designed
to be carried on a shoulder. The Japanese
‘Shoulder Phone 100 type’ weighs
approximately three kilograms.
1987: the first SMS service
is launched in Japan.
1989: the Game Boy is introduced
as an 8-bit hand-held console with a
green monochrome screen that has 
four brightness levels. Today the
Game Boy is in its third generation
and Nintendo claims that the Game
Boy is the most successful video
game system of all time. Its 2.5-inch
screen has 160x144 pixels.
1989: the first of 24 satellites that form the
current GPS constellation (Block II), is put
into orbit on 14 February. The initial tests
with Block I satellites began in 1978. 
1989: the Macintosh Portable
is Apple’s first attempt at launching a
‘laptop’. It is received with critical
acclaim, but has very poor sales in the
marketplace. It features a black and
white active-matrix LCD screen that is
incorporated into a hinged lid, and this
lid covers the keyboard when the
machine is not in use. Instead of a
mouse it has an integrated trackball,
which is positioned to the right of the
keyboard. Expensive SRAM memory is
used to maximise battery life. Its 
9.8-inch screen has 640x400 pixels.
1993: Apple presents its
Newton MessagePad 100
It is the first PDA with true
handwriting recognition. 
Its 5.5-inch screen has
240x320 pixels.
1993: the first 2G telephone service is 
launched by Nokia. 2G phones use GSM for
voice services and allow relatively low-speed
data services to be used for text messaging
and WAP internet access.
1994: the first satellite call
is made using the Nokia 2140.
1992: the first mobile phone for 
digital networks comes to Europe. 
The Motorola International 3200 
has a distinctive ‘bone’ shape, 
measures 334x43x67mm and 
weighs half a kilogram.
1994: Magic Cap (Communicating Applications
Platform), is designed for ease of use and
intuitive communication. Disarmingly simple
and sublimely powerful, it is designed and built
by a team of engineers led by the co-founders
of General Magic: Bill Atkinson and Andy
Hertzfeld, and it forms the interface for a new
breed of personal communicators such as the
Sony Magic Link. Its 5.4-inch screen has
480x320 pixels.

1996: Jeff Hawkins, who then headed
Palm Computing, carves a block of wood
into an object that he could comfortably
fit into his hand, and he carries it in his
shirt pocket for several weeks.
Eventually, he shapes and refines the
design and the Palm Pilot is born. 
The Palm Pilot’s 4-inch screen has a
resolution of 160x160 pixels.
1997: the Nokia 6110 is the first mobile
phone to come with built-in electronic games.
Nokia first introduces the snake game; since
then the number and variety of games
available has grown dramatically.
1997: the Siemens S10 is the first mobile
phone with a ‘colour’ display. It is just
about possible to recognise four colours on
its 97x 54 pixel screen.
1998: the Game Boy Color is introduced
by Nintendo as the first game console with
a colour display. In principle the device
can display 32,000 colours, but it can
display only 56 colours simultaneously.
The 2.3-inch screen has 160x140 pixels.
1999: NTT DoCoMo launches 
i-mode in Japan.
1996: sees the launch of the first
‘Smart Phone’. The Nokia 9000
Communicator is not just a mobile
phone, it also offers Internet access
and the ability to send and receive 
e-mails, faxes and SMS messages. 
Its screen has 640x200 pixels.
1996: Tamagotchi, the digital pet, makes
its mark in popular-cultural history when
Bandai launches the product in 1996. It
sells more than 40 million units worldwide.
1997: MP3.com is created by Michael
Robertson as an internet platform for the
distribution of digital music.

Japanese market. The Mitsubishi
D502iHYPER can display 256 colours
and its screen has 96x120 pixels.
2000: Ericsson unveils its T36; 
the first Bluetooth mobile phone. 
The built-in Bluetooth chip makes 
wireless connectivity possible 
between the phone and other 
mobile devices.
2000: LG Information and
Communications introduces the world’s
first mobile phone with an integrated 
MP3 internet music player that uses a
flash memory card. The device, the 
CyON MP3 LG-P810, has a stamp-sized
SanDisk 16MB or 32MB multimedia card.
2000: Samsung Electronics develops
the world’s first TV phone SCH-M220.
The user can watch TV on the 1.8-inch
TFT display for up to 200 minutes on a
single battery charge. 
2000: Sharp releases the first 
camera phone. The J-SH04 features
an integrated 110,000-pixel CMOS
image sensor for digital photography,
and its screen has 96x130 pixels.
2001: the debut of the iPod. The 
first generation iPod can store up to
10,000 songs, and has a liquid-
crystal display with LED backlighting,
which allows the artist’s name, 
song and album title to be displayed. 
The iPod’s 2-inch screen has
160x128 pixels.
2001: NTT DoCoMo becomes the first
mobile phone provider in the world to 
offer 3G mobile phone services under 
the acronym ‘FOMA’ (Freedom Of Mobile
Multimedia Access). 3G phones use UMTS
or CDMA 2000 technology and therefore
offer high-speed internet access.
The FOMA phones, such as the NEC
N2001, are the first devices with an OLED
display and their 2.2-inch screens have
120x160 pixels. Unlike TFT displays,
these displays are not backlit, so the
screen can be kept slim. However, there
are problems with the durability of the
devices, so OLED displays disappear from
the market until 2004.

2004: anti-virus software developers claim
they have discovered the first computer
virus that is capable of infecting mobile
phones. The ‘Cabir Worm’ infects mobile
phones running the Symbian operating
system and spreads via Bluetooth, which
has a range of about 30 meters. It scans
for other mobile phones, then sends a
copy of itself to the first vulnerable one it
finds. The constant scanning leads to a
vastly shortened battery life. If the virus
succeeds in penetrating the mobile phone,
it writes the word 'cabir' on the screen and
the virus is then activated every time the
phone is turned on.
2002: the first ring tone service, CHAKU-UTA,
enters the market. It enables users to download
songs in their original format and use these
songs as the dial tones on mobile phones.
2003: sees the launch of the Nokia N-Gage. It is
the first mobile phone with enough gaming power
to compete with Nintendo’s Game Boy Advance
SP, in terms of program complexity and image
quality. The N-Gage’s 2.8-inch screen has
176x208 pixels and is capable of displaying
4,096 colours.
2004: the SONY Clie VZ-90 is launched. 
It is the first PDA to offer an OLED screen,
producing brilliant, neon-sharp colours that
could not be rivalled by LCDs. Its 3.8-inch
screen has 480x320 pixels.
2004: Sony launches the LIBRIé; the first 
consumer device to use e-paper
technology. Its 6-inch screen has a
resolution of 170 dpi and 800x600 pixels.
2004: Samsung announces the world’s
first camera phone with 5-megapixel
resolution. The SCH-S250 also includes
the first QVGA display in a mobile phone
that supports 16.7 million colours. 
Its 2-inch screen has 240x320 pixels.
2002: Sharp introduces the Zaurus SL-C700.
The world’s first PDA to come equipped with
a LCD screen that is capable of outputting
VGA resolution. Its 3.7-inch screen has
640x480 pixels.
In 2002, the number of mobile phone
subscribers in the world exceeds the number
of landline subscribers for the first time.
2003: the Motorola MPx200 is the first
mobile phone with a Windows interface. 
It offers full MS Office compatibility with the
PC and a slot for SD memory cards, which
offer up to 1 GB of storage space. Its screen
has 176x220 pixels.
2002: the Sharp SH251iS is the world’s first
mobile phone to incorporate a 3D colour LCD
and 3D editing function, which enables users
to convert 2D images into 3D images. 
Its 2.2-inch screen has 176x220 pixels, and
can display 65,536 colours.
2003: the mobile phone manufacturer NEC
brings out the FOMA N2051: the first mobile

2006: 4G WWAN networks are expected to be 
available in Japan in 2006. They will have far higher
data speeds, which are suitable for high-resolution
video and television. 
2006: the DMFC (Direct Methanol Fuel Cell) will be
launched. The fuel cell can supply mobile devices
with energy for much longer than conventional
lithium-ion batteries. For example, ten hours of
battery life is planned for notebooks.
2006: the first DDR (Double Data Rate) chip will
come on the market. It will have four times the
storage capacity of conventional chips. With the
development of the prototype DDR3 DRAM 
(Dynamic Random Access Memory), the Korean
technological company Samsung is setting a new
standard for the coming generation of ultra-fast,
low-power memory chips.
2004: in Japan, Vodafone releases the first
mobile phone that is capable of receiving
analogue terrestrial television broadcasts. The
NEC V601N has headphones containing a built-in
television antenna, and the user can watch TV for
about one hour before recharging the battery.
2004: SAMSUNG Electronics unveils the
first mobile phone with a hard drive – the

Intel Montecito
Moore’s Law observes that the number of 
transistors per area doubles every 18 months.
Gordon E. Moore, one of the founders of Intel,
observed in 1965 that the number of transistors
on a chip almost doubled every year. At the time
he assumed that this trend would continue for at
least another ten years. However, Moore later
increased the period in which the number of
transistors doubled to 18 months. This law is still
valid today and its logic helps us to understand the
reason why technical devices are constantly
becoming smaller, cheaper and more efficient.
The evolution of small-screen devices would be
inconceivable without the miniaturisation of
technology. The concept that less might mean
more for the user was successfully executed by
Sony with the launch and subsequent development
of their Walkman. The constant reduction of the
size and price of technical components creates
mobility and the opportunity to achieve ever
greater personalisation.
In 2000 the number of mobile phone
connections in Japan overtook the
number of landline connections.
Worldwide, it took another two years
before there were more mobile phone
subscribers than landline subscribers.

Glossary
PDA: a Personal Digital Assistant is a small mobile
device that has address and calendar management
functions as standard. The range of functions
available has constantly increased, and most PDAs
today also offer internet access and the ability to
compose, send and receive e-mails. Entries are
made via a mini-keyboard or by stylus and
touchscreen, often combined with automatic
handwriting recognition.
Pocket PC: this device is similar to a PDA in size
and functionality. Its operating system, Windows
Mobile from Microsoft, is closely based on the
Windows operating system for PCs, thus simplifying
the handling and the transfer of data.
Communicator: this is a term that is used to
describe a combination of a mobile phone and
PDA. It originates from the launch of the Nokia
9000 Communicator, which was the first device of
this kind. Nowadays the term ‘smart phone’ is a
more commonly used name for the device.
Japan quickly adopts new advances in
technology. The spread of mobile
communication technology in Japan in
the last few years demonstrates how
small mobile devices have developed to
quickly become natural companions in
everyday life.

Nickel Cadmium (NiCd) batteries: the first
notebook computers benefited from the advantages
of this rechargeable battery technology, which was
already in commercial use from 1948 onwards.
NiCd batteries quickly provide large amounts of
energy for power-hungry components such as the
central processing unit (CPU) display or hard drive.
The batteries have a long-service life and are
moderately priced.
However, cadmium is a toxic heavy metal, and 
as such requires careful disposal. Another
disadvantage is their low specific energy of 
40–60Wh/kg, as well as the ‘memory effect’. 
This is a permanent reduction of the charging
performance if the battery is not always completely
emptied. Due to the high charging capacity of NiCd
batteries, they are mainly used in devices with a
high-power requirement, such as rechargeable
power tools, although they are also often used in
cordless phones and camcorders because of their
low production costs.
Nickel Metal Hydride (NiMH) batteries were
developed at the beginning of the 1990s to meet
the growing demand for mobile devices. These
batteries provide high and constant levels of power
for a long time. NiMH batteries are similar in
structure to nickel-cadmium batteries, but their
specific energy is higher at 60–80Wh/kg. The
disposal of these batteries is less of a problem
because they do not contain toxic heavy metals. 
A significant disadvantage of NiMH batteries is the
‘lazy-battery effect’ this temporary reduction of
capacity can be inconvenient, but it can be
remedied by completely discharging the battery
several times.
Due to their good environmental compatibility and
high capacity levels, NiMH batteries are mainly
used in mobile phones, camcorders, notebooks
and audio devices.
This graph charts the development 
of the weight and operating time of
mobile phones. The use of large,
coloured displays and sophisticated
moving images has led to a rapid
growth in the amount of energy needed
by small mobile devices. The progress
of rechargeable battery technology was
not able to keep up with the
development of the devices, so the
stand-by times have recently
decreased.

(development phase) Zinc-air
Lithium-Ion (Li-ion) batteries were developed at
the beginning of the 1990s. They have the highest
specific energy of rechargeable systems, at 
90–110Wh/kg, as well as a low self-discharge rate
and a long storage time. However, lithium, is used
as an electrolyte, which is a highly reactive light
metal, and as such it is an easily flammable
material that can explode if heated. To ensure
safety, lithium-ion batteries have a pressure-relief
valve and a pressure-resistant housing, but these
necessary safety features are reflected in the
price. A rechargeable Li-ion battery is
approximately 30 percent more expensive than a
NiMH battery. Lithium-ion technology has a higher
energy storage than conventional batteries such as
NiCd and NiMH, but the batteries do not reach the
same capacity. Lithium-ion batteries are mainly
used in mobile phones and notebooks.
Lithium-polymer (Li-polymer) batteries adopt the
same working principle as lithium-ion batteries, but
with the exception that the electrolytes are in gel
rather than liquid form; so these batteries will not
leak. Li-polymer batteries are not forced to adopt
the classical cylindrical or rectangular shapes 
of other batteries because they are composed of
aluminium or metalised plastic foil, which can be
moulded into almost any shape. As such, any
hollow spaces in battery-operated devices can
easily be filled with a bespoke li-polymer battery.
Comparison of the different 
rechargeable battery systems and 
their specific energy values.
Zinc-air batteries: the development of zinc-air 
batteries is still in its infancy, but the technology
behind them is not new. All of the components
used in zinc-air batteries are free from any harmful
toxic substances and are easy to recycle. Zinc-air
technology is therefore environmentally-friendly and
inexpensive. Further advantages of these batteries
are their high capacity and their low self-discharge
rate when sealed (air-tight). Due to its high specific
energy capacity of up to 350Wh/kg, zinc-air
technology is used mainly in hearing aids and
personal alarm devices. The first prototypes for
use in portable devices are still in the
development phase.
Direct Methanol Fuel Cell (DMFC) has the greatest
potential for the future as fuel-cell technology has
greater efficiency and energy density than any
present battery systems. In recent years,
companies such as Motorola, NEC, Samsung,
Fujitsu, Hitachi, Casio and Toshiba have presented
prototypes of direct methanol fuel cells. The
manufacturers plan to market the first commercially
usable cells during 2006.

In this chapter we look at the specification particularities of small
screens and what distinguishes them from their larger relatives.
Techniques that help to virtually increase the screen size, and thus 
compensate for the limited surface area, are also explained. From
dialogue boxes and menus, to panning and disproportional zoom,
all contemporary design concepts of screen-space management
are introduced.

The Screen
In this section we show examples of methods that have
been employed to overcome the limitations of small
screens. We demonstrate how websites can be scaled
down so they fit mobile devices, and that it is also
possible to scale down a complete operating system.
Furthermore, we show new techniques for dynamic and
creative use of display space.
This last section contains a glossary of terms and an
explanation of the display techniques and technologies
that are associated with small screens.

 
030|031
Particularities of small screens
The small-screen display on portable devices presents the problem of a
drastically reduced display area in comparison to the screens of larger
devices. In addition, the different uses that have emerged for portable
devices must be taken into account; the product and its ‘babyface’ are not
always the sole focus of the user’s attention. Increasingly, the use of a
small device is only one of several tasks being performed concurrently.
Another important difference is that portable devices are often used in a
variety of environments and many of these will not always offer an ideal or
constant ambient lighting.
Techniques to increase the screen surface area
Since the available screen space of any portable device is almost always
smaller than the amount of data to be represented, a number of
techniques have emerged to increase the display size by virtual means.
These techniques include zooming and panning, as well as the
incorporation of windows and dialogue boxes. However, some of these
techniques are more suited to small-screen devices than others.
Dialogue boxes are best described as windows that have a fixed size and
position, which ‘pop-up’ in various linear user-guidance situations.
Dialogue boxes will take priority over anything in the background, and the
message in this window must be accepted by the user before the original
application can be resumed. Dialogue boxes are easily transferred to
small screens and are often used as interface elements to offer the user
clear, step-by-step guidance.
The screen is the primary interface of any digitised medium, it interacts with the most
powerful of the human senses: sight. As such it constitutes the most powerful form of
interaction between man and machine. The screen’s high performance is derived from
the fact that it allows synchronous optical perception – the user can receive numerous
and varied items of information at the same time. It is quite easy to view multiple
signals at once, but it is harder or can even be impossible to hear just two signals
simultaneously. Thus the rationale behind the development of ever larger screens for
desktop computers is quite simply that the larger the display surface, the more
information can be rendered simultaneously in a single context.
The Screen

Windows, dialogue boxes, scroll bars, buttons and form fields are generally defined within the operating
system itself, so it is not always possible to design them for individual applications. If individually
designed interface elements are incorporated into applications, then they should be sufficiently
different in appearance to the interface elements supplied by the operating system, but at the same
time offer coherent uses. See also Section C in Chapter 4: Large Structures on Small Screens.
Windows incorporate the following 
functions:
1. A title bar containing the name 
of the window. This bar also acts as 
the handle to move the window. 
This function is not suitable for small-
screen devices.
2. An area to close the window. 
This function is also needed on 
small screens.
3. An optional area to maximise the
window in order for it to fill the screen.
4. An optional function to dock the
window at the bottom of the screen.
This function can also be transferred to
the small screen.
5. A scale function, usually in the 
lower right-hand corner, which is used
to enlarge or reduce the window. This
function is not suitable for use on
smaller screens.
Windows that can be freely moved, enlarged, reduced and closed are not
yet used on small screens, as the available space is too small to allow
flexible movement. Interaction with windows on a portable device is further
complicated because it requires the use of both hands.

 
032|033
Tabs at the top edge of the screen
should be avoided if content is to be
entered with a stylus, because the
content will be covered by the hand
holding the stylus.
Tabs at the bottom edge of the screen 
are very suitable for small-screen
displays. Used here, there are different
ways of organising the navigation area
and separating it from the content.
Multi-row tabs should always be
avoided because the position of
individual categories keeps changing,
which can lead to confusion. On 
small screens they take up too much
space in relation to the content that 
is presented.
Tabs can be regarded as windows that are placed on top of one another,
in a similar fashion to an index-card system. This organisational principle
is an efficient concept that enables users to call on many options quickly,
and the technique can also be used on small-screen displays. The
categories shown on the tabs, which always remain visible, help to make
the navigation of complex structures manageable. As such, tabs are a
good alternative to pull-down and pop-up menus, but there should not be
more than five to seven tabs displayed at the same time, otherwise 
the structure becomes confusing. Double rows of horizontal tabs should 
be avoided on small screens because they make the relationship between
navigation and available space for the content too unfavourable. 
The horizontal layout imposes a limit on the amount of text that can be
displayed, but this can be overcome by using icons. Tabs offer robust
navigation especially for devices operated with one hand via a mini joystick.

Basic design exercise
Try to organise all the items that a pizza delivery service might offer in the
available space of a hand-held screen. What does it look like if you use a pull-down
menu to display the options? Compare it with the potential of a tab solution.
Hint: if you are wondering how to visualise your concept, take a look at the
different prototyping techniques discussed in Chapter 9.
Pop-up menus are a better alternative
to pull-down menus on stylus-based
devices and are often used as 
context menus.
Nested pop-up menus employ similar
principles to those of nested pull-down
menus. If it is necessary to create extra
sub-menus, care must be taken to
ensure that the element does not
expand beyond the limits of the screen.
If the sub-menu relates to a function, a
combination of tabs and pop-up menus
is advisable.
Pull-down menus are useful on small
screens if they are used in ways that
comply with the expectations of the
user. For example, this pull-down menu
could apply to the small-screen
versions of desktop applications.
Nested pull-down menus should be
avoided on small screens if there is a
risk that they could be wider, or longer,
than the available screen space when
expanded. 
Pull-down and pop-up menus offer a selection of options that are
presented in list form. A pull-down menu drops down from the top edge of
the screen, whereas a pop-up menu opens up from the bottom edge of
the screen. Pull-down menus will be familiar as they are frequently used
for the quick selection of fields in forms. Pull-down and pop-up menus
have become established in many applications on small screens, as they
can be used instead of entering text in order to confirm a selection. Both
types of menu are often used on pocket PCs, this is because, ideally,
applications on small screens will be instantly recognisable to the user by
offering an environment on the small screen that resembles that of its
large-screen counterparts.
However, there are still design considerations to be taken into account:
pop-up menus are a better choice for devices where a stylus is used for
the interaction because, unlike pull-down menus, the items are not
covered by your hand. Pop-up menus on mobile phones cover most of the
screen, so their interaction priority resembles that of a dialogue box.

 
034|035
Scroll bars are used for ‘panning’ large areas within a window, and they
split the navigation into a vertical and a horizontal component. The slide
on a scroll bar works as both an interactive control and a dial. Whenever 
possible, a proportional slide should be used because it not only indicates
the user’s current position in relation to the total content of the page, but
it also shows the proportion of the visible content in relation to the total
content of the page. Both of these elements of functionality are achieved
by changing the length of the slide in relation to the full page.
Scroll bars on small-screen devices are typically used to navigate the
whole screen, and usually in just one direction – vertically (as their main
purpose is to navigate through longer text documents, which do not fit 
on a single screen page). Horizontal scroll bars are rarely used on small
screens, simply because there are very few applications that use
landscape formats. Vertical navigation also lends itself more easily to the
single-handed, thumb-based operations, which many small-screen 
devices incorporate.
The combination of vertical and horizontal scroll bars should be avoided 
on small screens. The division of the panning motion into a vertical and 
a horizontal component makes navigation of large documents clumsy 
and awkward. A better option is to use a navigation border that runs all
around the screen, as this will enable the content to be moved freely 
in any direction.
Vertical scroll bars are placed on the
right. In addition to the slide, two arrow
buttons are positioned at the top and
bottom end of the scroll bar, which can
be used for continuous scrolling in
either direction.
The simultaneous use of vertical and
horizontal scroll bars is awkward 
and difficult on small screens and
should be avoided.
The panning of a screen segment by
means of arrow buttons placed within a
navigation border works well, and it is
even better if more buttons can be
incorporated to allow the selection of
more directions. The navigation border
thus offers a continuous array of
options for ease of navigation.
Proportional scroll bars indicate how
much of the total content is displayed
on the screen or in the window. This
information is very useful on small-
screen devices, but this feature also
has its limitations.
If the total amount of information to
be displayed is very large, then
proportional scroll bars are not ideal 
as it is likely that the slide will be too
small or its size indication function will
be too inaccurate.

To support ‘leafing’, the content of a window or a screen must be split
into portions and the user’s view will show an indication of the current
portion and total number of portions at all times. This information
structure, which is borrowed from conventional book printing, is often used
on digital applications and it allows the design principles of printed
documents to be used on the screen. On larger screens, scrolling is often
the appropriate technique to adopt because it would be artificial to
interrupt the text flow by portioning the content. However, on small
screens, leafing is often a more robust form of text representation.
The mobile use of most small-screen devices makes it more difficult to
read the content line by line. Moreover the type of input interaction will
determine which method is preferable. If the screen navigation is achieved
with a stylus, then scrolling is more complicated than leafing. On a mobile
phone, however, scrolling is a one-handed operation and therefore better
than leafing. Similarly if the content to be displayed is continuous text,
then leafing is a better method, but scrolling is more appropriate for lists.
Leafing offers a traditional way to work
in a limited space. The layout of the
content can be optimised for the format
or size in question. Unlike scrolling,
leafing does not produce random views
of the content; only controlled portions
are accessible. For ease of use, a ‘start’
and ‘end’ button should be added as
well as the forward and backward
functions, and there should be a digital
indication of the total number of pages
and the current page.
Advanced design exercise
Try to come up with additional functions that a scroll bar can provide the user with. 
For example, is there a design solution that will allow a scroll bar to highlight important parts
within the text?
Or is there a way to visualise what part of a scrollable page is the most popular?
If an application incorporates a number pull-down menus, which have long
option or item lists, then the menus themselves may require their own
scroll bar. This is sometimes essential, but as a rule it should be avoided
because it needs a great deal of manual skill from the user, especially if
entry is with a stylus, and this is not always possible in all mobile
situations. Instead it is better to split the menus, lists and options into
several steps so that the user’s response or selection can be restricted to
limited choices and shorter lists.
On the screens of mobile devices that have a jog dial or joystick, a type of
miniature scroll bar has become commonplace. Its physical movement
visually supports the navigation of the menu, marking both the length of
the list and the current position in the list, but it is only used for display,
rather than interaction.

 
036|037
Zoom functionality is a technique that allows a large amount of content to
be accessible in a small space, but interaction with ‘zoomable’ content is
highly demanding – even on large screens. The parameters that the
designer must take into account include the focus of the zoom, the zoom
stages, the plus and minus direction of the zoom and the maximum zoom-
in and zoom-out values. The zoom can act as an automatic partial 
magnification of the display, for example with a virtual magnifying glass, or
the user can define all the parameters themselves. Optimum navigation in
free zooming is best when the application allows continuous zooming and
free selection of the focus point, but this requires very extensive
programming and powerful hardware. The quality of zoomable applications
on small screens is still far from ideal, mainly because of the processor
speed of the devices, but even so, zoom offers excellent functionality,
especially in the efficient use of the limited space on small screens.
Zooming can be used to bring together different hierarchical levels in a
plausible way and thus create a logical link between the overview and
detailed content information, so it is a design concept with great potential.
In non-proportional zoom, only parts of
the screen are magnified (instead of an
even magnification of the whole screen).
In those applications where a magnified
part is displayed as an extract that is
laid over the content, this is called a
‘magnifying glass’ function. 
If the content is distorted to enlarge
specific areas, this is called a
disproportional zoom.
In flip zoom, the content is broken 
into distorted sections and each of
these can be enlarged within the
original context.
In proportional zoom, the content is
enlarged and therefore an increasing
amount of the content is off the screen.
In some applications, such as in map
navigation, the zoom is combined with 
a pan function to make navigation 
more flexible.

How to divide the screen
Depending on the proportions of the screen, the designer must decide
how the available space can be most efficiently subdivided. For vertical
formats, a static navigation area should be situated on the short side of
the screen: either at the top or bottom. This especially applies to text-
based applications, because this structure provides the maximum line
length for reading.
Horizontal formats automatically offer more space to arrange the content
within a pleasant and legible column width. However, the problem here is
that only a few lines of text can be displayed at any one time, and the
user will be required to scroll even for short texts. Therefore, a static
navigation area on the short side of the screen is again recommended,
i.e. either the right or left edge. For devices that require the use of a
stylus, the navigation zone should be on the right so that the user's hand
does not cover the screen (as most users are more likely to operate their
device with the right hand). This restriction does not apply to interaction
with a jog dial or joystick.
All concepts that can be used to increase the efficient use of screen space are linked directly to the
type of interaction with the screen. So all design decisions must be coordinated with the interaction
system of the device. See also Chapter 3: Physical Interaction.
For text applications there is also an additional option available called ‘semantic zoom’. See also
Chapter 7: Digital Hieroglyphs: Text and Icons on Small Screens.

038|039 The Screen
The small-screen device has evolved into an independent and well-
established output medium. The processor performance, screen resolution
and colour depth that are now available, offer considerable freedom of
design. Whilst the devices remain compact, the technology supporting 
small-screens has indeed grown-up. As a result, an increasing number of
full-size applications are now transferring to the small screen.
Canon PowerShot Pro 1 Camera
Display: more and more devices are
controlled via their display. The focus is
carried out in a zoom window.
Microsoft Windows Mobile: the smaller
versions of large operating systems
reflect the familiar patterns of use,
which are well-known to their desktop
counterparts.
Vertical scrolling is the simplest and
most commonly used method to 
present large volumes of content on
smaller screens. For this purpose,
however, the layout and line breaks of
the content should be adapted for the
smaller format.

NTT DoCoMo Interactive Streetmap:
by using Flash, it is possible to create
dynamic interfaces that are graphically
more attractive. Information can be
processed visually and other forms of
interaction are possible. The technique
of zooming combined with a strong
abstraction of the presentation make it
possible to present this complex
information, even on a small screen.

The lack of space on smaller screens means that the quest for the
dynamic organisation of space is one of the most challenging aspects
associated with the design process.

Bigger can be smaller if we take the resolution into
account. When we refer to a small display, we
usually mean its physical size, but the resolution is
an additional parameter defining the size of a
display. The resolution determines how much
information is simultaneously visible on a display.
For displays of the same physical size, it can be
said that the higher the resolution is, the smaller
the rendering of the graphical elements.
Display sizes are often measured in inches. The
screen size value is the diagonal length of the
display. Pythagoras’s theorem is needed to relate
the physical dimensions of the screen to the
resolution values and the pixel sizes, which are
available for display on the screen. Since small
screens can be found in so many different
formats, the length of the diagonal is no longer a
helpful indicator of display size.

When locating a point on a display, the origin of
the coordinate axes is the left hand, top-most
corner of the screen. Every distance on the screen
is measured from this point.
DPI (Dots Per Inch): a measure of the scanning
resolution of an image or the quality of an output
device. DPI expresses the number of dots that 
a printer can print, or that a monitor can display,
per inch.
PPI (Pixels Per Inch): interchangeable with DPI.
LPI (Lines Per Inch): refers to the quality of a
halftone screen in printing. It is important to
distinguish LPI from DPI. The LPI is commonly
considered to be half the value of the DPI value of
the device or image, for example, 300 dpi would
equal 150 lpi.
PX (pixel): contraction of picture element. A pixel
is the smallest element that display software can
use to create text or graphics. A display resolution
described as being 640x480 can display 640 pixels
across the screen and 480 down the screen, thus
providing a total of 307,200 pixels. The higher the
number of pixels, the higher the screen resolution. 
TFT (Thin Film Transistor): the highest quality and
brightest LCD colour display type. A method for
packaging one to four transistors per pixel within a
flexible material that is the same size and shape
as the LCD display, so that the transistors for each
pixel lie directly behind the liquid crystal cells that
they control.
Active-matrix Display: a type of flat-panel display
found on most laptop computers. Active-matrix
technology differs from ‘passive matrix’ only in as
much as the screen is refreshed more frequently,
creating much better picture quality and better
viewing angles. The most common type of active-
matrix screen is called TFT (or Thin Film Transistor).
The two terms are often used synonymously.
OLED (Organic Light-Emitting Diode): the diodes in
displays made with OLEDs emit light when a
voltage is applied to them. The pixel diodes are
selectively turned on or off to form images on the
screen. This kind of display is brighter, thinner and
faster than the normal liquid crystal display (LCD)
in use today. It also needs less power to run,
offers higher contrast, looks just as bright from all
viewing angles and is a lot cheaper to produce
than LCD screens.

Screens are defined both by their physical size and
the number of pixels they can display. The ratio of
dots per inch (dpi) is referred to as the resolution
of the display. So if we want to define what small
screens are, a combination of these two parameters
must be taken into account.
Today a screen is considered ‘small’ if it supports
fewer than 307,200 pixels. This is equal to a
resolution of 640x480 pixels (VGA; see facing
page), or a diagonal screen size of approximately
11 inches at 72 dpi.

LCD: liquid crystal displays do not
generate any light. Instead the display
can be illuminated either by reflecting
light from the environment, or by a light
source positioned behind the display. 
It is also possible to combine these two
principles; the rear lighting of LCD
displays is not yet bright enough to be
clearly legible in bright sunshine, but it
can be blinding when it is used in the
dark. This can be compensated by a
brightness sensor and separate darker
graphics for use by night. 
OLED: organic light-emitting diodes
have the advantage that they generate
light themselves. This makes them much
flatter, brighter and less expensive 
than LCDs.
SOLED: stacked organic light-emitting
diodes lay the three colours of the
additive colour mixtures one over the
other, which makes the colour rendering
more precise and the resolution 
much finer.

Chapter 3
The physical interaction with small screens is limited by the size of
our hands. In this chapter we look at one-handed and two-handed
interaction, and outline the basic interaction methods for small
screens. This is followed by an introduction to the more commonly
used input devices; from the scroll wheel to the virtual keyboard.
The importance of instant feedback, as a crucial element for
interaction, is also discussed, as are the concepts of natural
mapping and motor memory and their implications on positioning
control elements in relation to the screen.

Physical Interaction
The second part of this chapter shows how natural
mapping and instant feedback are actually used in
interaction applications. This is followed by a review of
both the predominant interaction methods and some
lesser known, but creative, ways of physical interaction.
In the last section of this chapter we look at the
technical side of physical interaction. We explain and
visualise the different ways in which a screen can detect
where and when it has been touched by the user. Finally,
we look at the human side of sensory technology. 

 
050|051 Physical Interaction
Physical interaction
Interaction with small-screen devices reveals the conflict of interests
between creating the smallest physical size that will give the user
unrestricted mobility and flexibility, whilst maintaining dimensions that are
defined by the size and the motor functions of the human hand. The
balance is not always achieved and some devices are already smaller than
the minimum size that can be comfortably operated by an adult hand.
There are two fundamental types of physical interaction that can be
distinguished: one-handed and two-handed interaction. Some devices can
only be operated with two hands, for example, the Game Boy, whilst other
devices offer different modes that can be selected alternately. Smart
phones, for example allow the user to dial numbers with one hand, but
interaction for more complex applications such as using the calendar or
accessing the internet is done with two hands.
The nature of user interaction plays a far more important role in the design of
applications for small-screen devices than in the design of applications for desktop
computers. This is partly because there are fewer standardised forms of input or, more
simply, no clear equivalent to the keyboard and the mouse. In addition, the context for
small-screen device use is far less predictable than for a conventional desktop computer.
Even the comparatively mobile use of a laptop computer requires the user to be in a
static, seated position. For those portable devices that are often more peripheral in their
use, the design options for the menu structures and screen layout will depend far more
on the user’s likely interaction style.
Game consoles require two-handed
operation, with the use of the thumb
and index finger. The hands of the
Nintendo generation – used to
interacting with game consoles from an
early age – have advanced motor skills.
For example, it has been observed 
that young people’s thumbs have
developed greater sensitivity and motor
skills over recent years, and as such
the ability of their thumbs is now close
to the finely tuned motor skills of their
index finger.
(Game Boy Advance)

One-handed interaction enables a device to be used at the same time 
as carrying out other activities. One-handed interaction presents the
greatest challenge for the interaction designer because the same hand 
is used for the interaction and to hold the device. This means that all
fingers, except for the thumb, have restricted freedom of movement, and
thus less scope for interaction. Yet the thumb has considerably less fine
motor control than the index finger.
In one-handed interaction, a tabulator system is almost always adopted:
the user employs their thumb to control a mini joystick, which enables
them to move from one menu item to the next and then to confirm their
choice. The mini joystick is almost always placed centrally on the front of
the device. This is not an ergonomically ideal position, but a compromise
so that the device can be operated both with the left and the right hand.
However, putting the interactive element in this position does in fact
restrict the user’s freedom of movement and their ability to navigate 
the software.
Two-handed interaction often sees one of the hands playing a supporting
role so that fine movements, such as data input through use of a stylus or
keyboard, are carried out by the other hand.
Full two-handed operation, in which keys and control elements are
operated simultaneously with both hands, is mainly found in portable
game consoles. Most games focus heavily on the player’s fast reactions,
so the motor skills of the two hands are used simultaneously. 
Complex two-handed movement patterns are stored in ‘motor memory’ so
can be called upon as a reflex action when needed. When interaction 
with a device requires the use of both hands, completing any other activity
at the same time is almost impossible, even walking.
Motor memory plays a decisive role in all forms of interaction. Movements stored in this memory
can be recalled as reflexes when they are needed. See also ‘motor memory’ in this chapter.
Mobile phones often incorporate
one-handed menu interaction, 
which is controlled through the use 
of a clickable scroll wheel.
(Nokia 7110)

 
052|053 Physical Interaction
Interaction techniques and elements
Unlike the standard input methods that evolved for interaction with
desktop computers, a multitude of different input and interaction elements
have developed for the operation of small, mobile devices.
Sony’s ‘jogdial’ is a clickable scroll wheel that can be operated with the
thumb. It was one of the first multifunctional elements developed for
portable devices. Turning the wheel enables the user to scroll through
menu options and pressing the wheel confirms the user’s selection. 
It is usually sufficient to control just the vertical navigation alone because
the size, proportions and resolution of the small screen mean that it can 
only display a simple list. To allow the same element of control with 
the ability to jump between different hierarchical levels, a knurled wheel
was developed that could also be tilted in two directions. The scroll wheel 
and the knurled wheel have high tactile and motor qualities because 
they really move, and use of the wheel means that physical stop points
can be linked with menu items.
A scroll wheel placed on the side 
of a device offers ergonomically ideal
interaction for the left hand.
(Sony CMD X2000)
A jogdial positioned on the side of a
device, which can be tilted to apply
extra functions, is almost too difficult
for the fine motor skills of the thumb.
(Sony CMD Z5)
A mini joystick situated in the centre
of a device can be reached equally 
well (or equally badly), by both hands.
The position of the interactive elements
restricts the thumb’s freedom of
movement. (Sony Ericsson T610)

A mini joystick is operated with the thumb and can be used to control
movements in two directions, and to select items. Pushing the mini
joystick in one direction simply defines the direction of the movement; the
speed of the movement can be altered by varying the movement of the
mini joystick. The mini joystick is cheaper and more robust than a scroll
wheel, and therefore became an established interaction component even
before the screen sizes and software concepts were really able to
incorporate the second direction that it offers.
On small screens there is not yet any representation of the user – in the
form of a cursor – so the movement of the mini joystick is not translated
into a directional vector; interaction is simply interpreted as a movement
that is either horizontal or vertical. Here too, the display jumps from one
tabulator to another. The exceptions to this are isolated applications such
as navigation systems, in which an extract from a map can be moved
obliquely by using the joystick.
Both the scroll wheel and the mini joystick permit one-handed navigation,
and sometimes even blind navigation, because the thumb interacts
continuously with the same component and does not have to move from
one interaction element to another. This means that they are ideal forms
of interaction for portable devices because they can be used peripherally.
To give the joystick similar tactile and motor qualities to the scroll wheel,
techniques such as tactile feedback, e.g. vibration, can be used.
Apple’s rotating click wheel, seen on the first generation iPod, displayed
direct feedback of the user’s movement on the screen, and as such 
had a high physical quality that contributed significantly to the success of
the device. This direct feedback has created a mental model of a virtual
transmission, in spite of the fact that the directions of movement are 
not congruent.
The virtual click wheel is technically little more than a circular touchpad
that largely imitates the physical movements of an ‘actual’ wheel. The
virtual click wheel enables the quality of continuous physical interaction to
be maintained, but is far cheaper and less prone to error than its actual
counterpart. The common element of both wheels is that the user can
develop a special skill in their interaction, which is a positive user
experience because it helps to foster self-confidence in working with 
new technology.
With the mini joystick, the movement of
the thumb is interpreted as either a
vertical or a horizontal movement. The
exception is mobile navigation systems.
The (virtual) click wheel permits highly
differentiated interaction. For example,
the thumb can turn full circle for fast
scrolling, or a more precise selection
can be made exactly by making small
movements. At the same time, the four
quadrants of the pads act as four
different selection buttons.

 
054|055
068|069 
Physical Interaction
The continuous movement of the cursor
is the result of a three-step motion 
of the user’s finger on the touchpad.
The touchscreen is a very direct and intuitive form of interaction, but on
small-screen devices it must be remembered that the finger is a relatively
large input instrument. Therefore a stylus is often used for input on 
small-screen appliances so that the size of interaction elements or icons,
and the area of the screen that is obscured during interaction can be
reduced. The standard touchscreen does not have any tactile feedback, so
the user’s eyes must remain on the screen in order to maintain interaction. 
In the design of interactive applications for use on a touchscreen, the
general rule is that the elements for navigation and interaction should be
placed close to the bottom of the screen, so that the screen is
unobscured during interaction.
The touchpad, as an indirect and relative control mechanism, has yet 
to become established for small screens. The touchpad could be a useful
addition to some devices, such as the Pocket PC, but its disadvantage,
especially compared to a joystick is that the finger must be moved back
and forth several times in order to direct the cursor, which makes 
one-handed operation difficult. 
A further technical development of the touchscreen is
one that offers tactile feedback. It allows an extra
interaction quality and enables the device to be used
peripherally. For more information see the example of
the Alpine PulseTouch technology in Section 3B.

During the interaction process, conventional touchscreens are unable to
distinguish whether the user clicks on the screen or just touches it
instead. This means that no balloon help or other rollover effects can 
be used on touchscreen interfaces. However, the latest generation of
touchscreens are able to interpret the pressure of the user’s touch, and
so can distinguish between rollover and clicking. This progression offers
greater scope for the design to include sensitive feedback mechanisms
between the actions of the user and the reactions of the device.
In addition to clicking and drag-and-drop interactions, the interpretation of
other motions on the touchscreen is becoming increasingly important. 
For example, a fast zigzag movement can be interpreted as deleting, and
circling an object can be interpreted as an expression of interest that
zooms in on the corresponding detail.

The interpretation of gestures means
that the whole of the screen can be
used for interaction. The gesture does
not need to relate to the image on the
screen. Acoustic feedback should be
used to reinforce the feedback between
the system and the user.
With an anoto pen the input problem is reversed; the user can enter data
by writing on specially printed paper. The written text or sketch is then
transmitted from the stylus to the device. This type of data entry requires
a writing surface and full concentration on the writing process, and it is
therefore very suitable for certain situations, such as making notes during
the course of a meeting.
An anoto pen can use an optical sensor
system to transmit the written data to a
device by Bluetooth. Specially printed
paper makes it possible to detect the
exact location of the stylus tip.

Physical Interaction
Voice input is very suitable for peripheral use. A technical requirement 
for voice control at present is a controlled acoustic environment, such as
inside a car, so that the system can interpret the input reliably. The
dialogue for interaction with a computer-assisted system is still not fluent,
so voice input is only effective for short commands or data entries, like
e.g. names or addresses. The structural advantage of voice input is that
this form of navigation cuts across the hierarchical levels of the overall
structure – each menu item can be called up immediately, irrespective of
its level within the navigation scheme.
Offering menu choices via voice output is an arduous form of interaction
and should always be avoided where possible because of the linear
character of language. A verbal list of several menu functions is far less
effective than a simultaneous visual representation. Yes or no decisions
are the only type of interaction dialogue that can be handled at a
reasonable speed. Voice output however, is an appropriate technique for
delivering content such as e-mails or text messages, because it allows 
the user to simultaneously carry out other activities, such as driving a car
or walking.
Entering keywords by voice input is 
a fast form of navigation that cuts
across the menu hierarchy.
The linear character of language makes
the selection of menu functions time-
consuming and arduous.

The assignment of physical keys and
their currently active functions should
be clearly shown.
Physical keys that are used as interactive elements are especially
important for older users because they represent a familiar and reliable
way to control a device. Matters can become more complex if these keys
have multiple assignments. Soft keys – those keys which are dynamically
assigned different functions – should be positioned close to the screen,
and the current and active function of the key should always be displayed
on the screen. For the successful incorporation of soft keys, the design
process of the end device and its interface must be so closely linked that
this relationship can be seen at a glance.
The telephone keypad with assigned alphabetical letters is a special case
of multiple assignment. Using a 12-key block to write long text messages
is an arduous task. The automatic word recognition (or predictive text)
feature T9 is only helpful in part because it only offers a standard and
limited vocabulary. The success of text-based communication between
mobile phones is probably due more to the discretion that this form of
communication allows, rather than the convenience of its use. In this form
of multiple assignment of keys, it is very helpful to have an on-screen
display of all of the characters that are represented by any given key when
that key is pressed.

Folding keyboards are only really
effective for keying longer texts,
otherwise the installation requires 
more time than the data entry.
(Palm Portable Keyboard)
The size of the numerical keypad or ‘QWERTY’ keyboard is the second
factor, alongside the size of the screen, which determines the overall size
of the device. That said, there is a limit to just how small a device can be;
shrinking beyond a certain point will sacrifice comfort and convenience of
use. The keys act as an additional display area, which considerably affects
the user’s interaction with the device.
Selecting numbers or letters from a list with a single control element, 
such as a rotate-and-press dial, would be far more complicated than using
a keypad, and would place severe restrictions on the speed and
convenience of the interaction process. The fact that this principle is used
in some devices, for example navigation systems in cars, results from the
specific and less than ideal ergonomical situation of the device.
For text input, the discrepancy between the size of the interface needed
for optimum user interaction, and the size of the display for visual
monitoring is especially great. Folding keyboards are available for PDAs
and even for smart phones; they serve to extend the interaction area to a
comfortable size, but they also mean that a formerly mobile device is
rendered temporarily static.
Using the rotate-and-press element 
to enter letters is a particularly arduous
input mechanism and only efficient
when used to select items from lists.

Additionally there are several variations of virtual keyboard. One such type
is an input device that is available in the form of gloves, which log and
interpret the movements of the fingers. In this concept the display – a
keyboard in which the letters are spread out for the user to see – is missing.
Use of this virtual keyboard requires that the position of each letter, and
its corresponding hand movement, be memorised; a particular typing
convention must be followed.
Alternatively, a virtual keyboard can be displayed on the screen or projected
on to an external surface. In either case though, interaction with virtual
keyboards demands a greater degree of user attention and as such is
unsuitable for peripheral use.
To achieve usability, virtual keyboards
must offer a display function in which
the available letters and functions are
shown.

Physical Interaction
Instant feedback
When designing the interaction scenario or defining which physical actions
should trigger which virtual reactions, it must be ensured that the action
and the reaction are linked as closely and logically as possible. The period
of time between the action and the reaction should also be considered; 
as far as possible, the system should react in real time to each of the
user’s actions. This ‘instant feedback’ provides the user with the feeling
that they are directly manipulating and controlling the system. Any delay
between the action and the reaction interrupts the user-device dialogue
and leads to uncertainty, which can cause the user to incorrectly enter their
input again. Communication problems like this will not only frustrate the
user, but also place an extra burden on the system – and may cause it 
to crash.
It is therefore important to design an instant interaction process: each
action by the user must be followed immediately by a response from the
device. This response could be audible feedback or a subtle visual
manipulation of the selected menu item or icon. If the process takes time
and requires the user to be patient, there should be some indication of
the delay. If there is likely to be a long delay, then the user must be given
as much information as possible about the expected waiting time.
All interaction techniques for small-screen devices are subject to the following design
principles:
firstly, the system must react to each input command immediately (this is referred to as
instant feedback); secondly, the interactive elements should be plausibly arranged in
relation to one another and their movement characteristics should be easy to remember
(this is referred to as natural mapping); and thirdly, the procedures for use should have
high physical and interactive qualities, which can be memorised in the form of finger
movements and action sequences (this is referred to as motor memory).
Subtle but continuous acoustic feedback
could be used to maintain an instant
interaction dialogue between the user
and the device.
Where there is a delay in response, for
example, due to loading times, the
device should give precise information
about what is happening and how long
the delay will last.

The reading direction from left to right
naturally indicates that the right key
should be assigned to ‘confirm’ or
‘yes’, the left key to ‘reject’ or ‘no’
(above). To exchange the placement of
these keys is illogical (right).
Vertical assignment is simpler: 
the top key is used to increase 
the value, the bottom key is used 
to reduce it. 
The scroll bar is an exception to the
concept of natural mapping: the lower
arrow key moves the text upwards, but
the extract in view is moved down.
Natural mapping: the position of control elements in relation to the screen
The functional assignment of interaction elements – both physical and
virtual – should be logically geared towards the expectations of the user.
Where elements are arranged horizontally, the reading direction from 
left to right should be taken into account. This means that functions such
as ‘confirm’ and ‘next’ should be on the right of the screen, and functions
such as ‘back’ and ‘change’ should be on the left. Additional functions or
options such as ‘further information’ should remain neutral in relation to
their direction and placement. The vertical axis is semantically linked with
the concept that ‘up’ equals more and ‘down’ equals less. This can be
applied, for example, to functions such as volume and zoom control. 
When designing soft keys, which have dynamically applied functions, care
must be taken to ensure that the assignment of the physical keys is
consistent, for example the ‘cancel’ functionality will always be assigned
to the same physical key. The link between the key and the screen should
also be as consistent, close and unambiguous as possible.

Natural mapping: the movement of the control elements and the
accompanying virtual presentation
A logical connection between the physical action and the virtual reaction
means that the forms, directions and speeds of the movement should
also be designed as congruently as possible. For example, a physical
rotation movement should trigger a virtual rotation, and a physical counter-
clockwise rotation should generate a virtual counter-clockwise direction.
Starting with familiar movement patterns that can be reflected 1:1 in
virtual reality and which will work immediately, it is also possible to create
other, more complex implementations. For example, a rotating movement
in reality can also be plausibly reflected by a linear movement on the
screen (a change in the angle of the real movement does not need to be
transferred on to the screen as a 1:1 reflection), larger or smaller
movements can also be communicated very plausibly and intuitively as
long as the system responds in real time so that the action can be
corrected at once.
The right direction key on the joystick
causes the selection on the screen to
jump to the right. Similarly the up
direction key causes the selection to
jump to the row above.
The physical rotating movement can be
linked with a virtual linear movement.
The movement can be interpreted both
as a vertical movement and as a
horizontal movement: a clockwise turn
moves the list upwards and the visible
extract downwards. A horizontal
movement to the right also corresponds
to a clockwise turn.
The link between the user’s physical
movement and the device’s virtual
reaction can be translated at various
speeds by the system.

Motor memory
When using devices with small screens, motor memory becomes a
particularly important factor. Things that we store in our motor memory
represent a fundamental learning experience because they are intrinsically
linked to a physical dimension. Many standard usage movements stored in
motor memory can be summoned as reflex or ‘blind’ actions. These sort
of actions are often employed in one-handed peripheral use of a device.
The nature of this interaction should be taken into account and we should
expect interaction concepts that interpret the user’s gestures, to become
increasingly important in the design process. This means that tactile and
auditory interaction should be used as additional feedback wherever
possible so that the device can be operated reliably even without looking.
The layout on the gear shift is
memorised by the user’s motor memory.
The lack of undivided user attention must be taken into account in the development of a
small-screen design concept, as subtle design features might be overlooked by the user in
peripheral usage situations. See also Chapter 7: Digital Hieroglyphs.

to shorten the user’s learning period and may make the operating 
manual redundant.

In practice, the interface designer must abide by the formal requirements
of the product design in order to create a bridge between the software and

framework with particular regard to the screen layout and the selection of

navigates the menu, the sub-options

This places the various navigation
levels in a spatial context.

The user’s interaction with the hardware and the subsequent reaction of

and development of the hardware and software is carried out at the same
time. This enables products to be developed that are a physical pleasure
to use. This quality is a decisive factor for success in the marketplace
as these devices are no longer just working tools, they are also
entertainment machines, and as such the ‘fun’ factor is an important and
additional criterion to the basic ergonomic design.

Alternative physical forms of interaction that make use of human dexterity
and finger agility are especially suitable for small, portable devices. Lower
production quantities are economically feasible, which paves the way for a
multitude of new product categories. Not all of these new devices are
multifunctional, which means that their interaction possibilities need not
be as universal as those of the desktop computer; so new and innovative
interaction patterns are emerging.

These sensory layers are not only able
to register pressure, but they can also
work in reverse and provide tactile
feedback by contraction and expansion.
Resistive Screen: a flexible layer,
coated with a transparent metal oxide,
is deformed by pressure and so 
brought into contact with a secondary
layer that is also covered with a
conductive coating. 
Infrared Screen: infrared light is
transmitted across the surface from left
to right and from top to bottom, thus
creating a matrix. The finger interrupts
the ray of light, and in this way, the
movement can be assigned to a
corresponding coordinate on the screen.
Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) Screen:
here, acoustic waves are transmitted
across the surface. The finger will
interrupt these waves and allow the
interaction to be localised. 
Capacitive Screen: a conductive,
transparent layer registers touch
because it changes the voltage. Sensors
at the edges of the display determine
the position.
Capacitive-projected Screen: here, a
second layer of glass is used. A matrix
of conductive, transparent metal oxide
enables the touch to be localised. 
Inductive Screen: in this principle, the
sensory layer is situated behind the
LCD display. This principle provides a
very brilliant image, but it only works
with a specially equipped stylus. 
Not all touchscreen technologies are suitable for
all applications. In the design of touchscreen
applications, the type of screen as well as the
interaction detection technology must be taken into
account in order to achieve the best results.
For some applications two of these technological
principles are combined to overcome the limitations
of a single technology.
With this further development,
interactive elements on the screen can
be felt. Up to eight different tactile
stimuli can be generated. 
This is a very widespread and relatively
inexpensive principle, but the soft, top
layer can be damaged by sharp objects.
The gap between the two layers causes
a slight loss of brilliance and brightness.
This principle also works if the user is
wearing a glove, but not if using a
stylus. The system is very sensitive, and
it may be activated if dirt or other alien
objects interrupt the infrared light. 
The parallax of the glass layer can limit
the accuracy. 
The principle offers a brilliant image
display and as such is a robust
structure, which is often found in
kiosks and information terminals. It can
also be operated if the user is wearing
a glove, but it is sensitive to dirt. 
This principle also offers a brilliant
image and is not sensitive to dirt, but 
it is not scratchproof. It cannot be
operated with a glove, instead a special
stylus is needed to operate it. 
This system can also be operated with
a glove. It has a thicker glass layer, and
is therefore a particularly robust system
that works under extreme conditions.

Human perception occurs in a highly complex
manner via an assessment of sight, sound, smell,
taste and touch. The latter sense, also known as
haptic perception, represents a combination of
many different sensual elements. These include
the tactile sensors that detect pain, pressure,
temperature and vibrations, and the kinesthetic
sensors that detect, contact pressure, muscle
tension and the angle of the body joints.
The human body is not evenly equipped with
receptors for each of these types of perception.
The fingertips have the highest concentration of
pressure receptors; over 20 per square millimetre,
but the back has the lowest concentration 
of these receptors; here, the gaps between the
receptors are several centimetres.
Sensory perception also specialises in detecting
changes. Receptors become accustomed to
permanent stimuli and then only react when these
parameters change, because a change may signify
danger or an opportunity. For this reason we can
become accustomed to a permanent noise level 
or an unpleasant smell as it will cease to be
consciously perceived. However, it must be assumed
that suppressing, or filtering out, this perception
happens actively and is therefore tiring.
Highly-tuned motor skills are needed to handle
electronic devices, and this presents a special
opportunity for communication with small interfaces;
the designer cannot rely on the power of visual
communication alone. Due to the small size of the
display and the distractions of the visual information
in the environment, it is advisable to first transmit
the information in a redundant way, such as the
vibration alarm on a mobile phone, and secondly to
establish handling rituals that draw on human
motor skills, so that the user does not need to
look at the screen constantly. 
The human hand is a multifunctional
tool, and the action of the
thumb and index finger is
very sophisticated. The
hand is both a very
efficient and complex
sensor system, as well 
as a sensitive and highly
mobile gripping implement.
This combination makes it a very
sensitive input/output system and 
a knowledge tool and this is even
reflected in our language – when we
speak of ‘grasping’ something, we
are really talking about the mental
process of understanding.
The sense of sight is a passive input
channel, which is like the senses of
sound, smell and taste. The difference,
compared with the other senses, is that
sight can process far more information
simultaneously. Using sight as an
output channel, for example in eye
control, is only useful in very specific
applications in which the hand cannot
be used. 
The human feet are also fairly well
equipped in their sensory and motor
abilities. However, this capacity is
greatly limited by wearing shoes.

In this chapter we look at ways to structure large amounts of data.
We introduce the concept of mental models and discuss the use of
metaphors. There are five basic methods used to organise
information: location, alphabet, time, context and hierarchy, and
these form the foundation of any information-based application. In
this section we explore the particular significance of each method.

Large Structures on Small Screens
In this section we examine examples of large structures
on small-screen devices. Applications such as navigation
systems and time planners are assessed to reveal the
challenges presented by the small screen. The examples
demonstrate creative ways to overcome the inherent
shortcomings of a small device.
Here we explore what goes on behind the scenes of large
information structures. Included is an introduction to the
terms and technologies of operating systems and
programming languages.

Large Structures on Small Screens
The mental model
It is important to convey a mental model that allows the user to visualise
the ‘invisible’ space inside the device, this means that the user can gain
an impression of the structure of the system. To create this sort of mental
model the rules within the system must be plausible, easy to learn and
the user must be able to rely on the rules once they have learned them.
Visualisations of the data in the form of maps and diagrams can serve as
a basis for a mental model. This type of presentation enables meaningful
links and logical interrelationships to be displayed – in a similar fashion to
the results of a mind-mapping exercise. Later these models help with more
detailed control because the user has already developed a basic concept
of the overall system structure. For example, if a device needs operating
instructions then some form of synchronous visualisation of these
instructions should be employed, and ideally the main navigation level
should offer the user any necessary explanations and instructions.
A mental model does not need to correspond with the actual structure of
the software. Often, the user interface is a more simplified model of, or
metaphor for, the processes that actually occur. Alan Kay, the inventor of
the graphical user interface, calls this the ‘user illusion’. The ability to
form an appropriate mental model of the way a device works depends, to
a large extent, on the user’s experience in working with electronic devices.
Large software structures can be very complex and extensive. The more generic the
hardware is, the greater the number of applications that can be installed and used on it.
However, this means that it is no longer possible to create an unambiguous link between
the physical form, the interaction concept and the software application. Instead the
interaction concepts must be made more general so that they can be used in a large
number of different applications. The visual interface of the screen is all the more
important because it must enable the user to understand the interaction concept for
each program and provide the relevant operating instructions.
Virtual keys on a screen will often create a tangible impression, thus reinforcing the link to the real world. This interface element
shows that it is an interactive area that can be ‘pressed’ by the user. To simplify the interaction with the system, where there are
several choices, it is sensible to predetermine the most plausible reaction for each situation, as this makes the confirmation
process faster. This concept is important for small screens because it supports mobile, one-handed navigation.
See also Section A in Chapter 3: Physical Interaction.

The metaphor is a practical form of the mental model. The metaphor,
which is reflective of the human learning, starts with the familiar and
transfers this to a new environment. The metaphor forms a narrative
framework in which to place the possibilities within the system into a
context that is logical for the user. Objects and actions are often borrowed
from the real world to illustrate similar functions of the system.
The metaphor of the desktop, for example, enabled computers with this
graphical user interface to be used for the first time by people with little or
no knowledge of computers. The transfer of everyday objects and processes
from the classical office environment and on to the interface allowed
users to draw conclusions about the functions and the type of interaction
that they offered. Equally, the interface of a pocket PC is closely based on
structures that are recognisable from larger PCs, and as such it connects
with the mental model that is already familiar to the user.
Metaphors can be a disadvantage. The metaphor as a closed narrative
framework has not become established, and nor has a separate, all-
embracing metaphor for small-screen devices. Instead, a number of single
metaphorical interface elements have become established, such as the
button, the folder, the magnifying glass or the dustbin. This is partly 
due to the fact that closed metaphors are difficult to scale, but a larger
problem is the naturalism of metaphors: many functions of a digital
system do not have any corresponding function in the real world, as such
no metaphorical counterpart can be found.
The human ability to learn is characterised by the creation of a link with
what is already known, and the transference of this knowledge to new
situations. This principle is important as it means that the designer must
know the intended target audience for a product when selecting its
structure, in order to ascertain what likely prior knowledge and experience
the potential user can call upon.
The concept of files that can be saved
in folders, which can then be used to
create new filing structures, has also
become established in many systems.
An enclosing metaphor, which defines
the idea of the working environment in
greater detail would actually be a
hindrance, because it would transfer
real space restrictions into virtual reality. 
The context-sensitive cursor is a good
way to give the user specific navigation
hints or instructions. However, this
feature is only possible if there is a
pointer element for navigation.
The dustbin is often used as a
metaphor for the ‘delete’ function. This
metaphor is so easy to understand that
it has been in use for 30 years. It is
sensible, especially in a drag-and-drop
environment, because it embodies the
instruction for interaction: if a file is
dragged on to this symbol, it is deleted.
It is also possible for the user to
change his mind, because files can
also be retrieved from the dustbin.

 
078|079 Large Structures on Small Screens
Context
An important factor when considering orientation within large data
structures is the preservation of context. The length of a book can be
determined by the thickness of the its spine, however the size of a digital
application is far more difficult to estimate. Equally if you look at any page
in an open book, you can easily determine where you are within the
progression of that book, but orientation within a digital application is far
more difficult. The designer should therefore always try to give the user
guidance and placement orientation. One way of doing this is to make
several hierarchical levels visible at the same time. This gives the user a
better idea of the structure and content as well as their position within 
the system.
Various display techniques have been established to show several
hierarchical levels simultaneously. For example, a nested list is one way to
show the tree structure of a hierarchy, or a preview of files in the form of
thumbnails might correspond to a simultaneous display of the navigation
and content levels. In the implementation of such concepts, small screens
present a special challenge because of the limited available space. 
A zoom function, especially a distorted zoom, can help to make economical
use of the space.
Thumbnails enable files to be viewed
without opening them. This is another
concept that links navigation and
content levels, and therefore makes
interaction easier and more convenient. 
Nested lists work on small screens if the
tabulator offset is kept to a minimum.
This structure allows one-handed
scrolling through all levels of navigation,
without any need for a ‘back button’.
On small-screen devices, techniques
that stretch or condense the content,
depending on the focus, can be 
used for long lists or large tables such
as calendars.

Analogue and digital
When numbers are presented on a small screen, an analogue display is
preferable to a digital display. Diagrammatic visualisation can provide the
contextual information that enables the displayed value to be interpreted.
This applies not only to information that is familiar to the user, such as
the time, but also to parameters with values and units which are less
familiar or unknown. The numeric display of the current loading speed in
megabytes per second is less helpful than a bar diagram that shows
approximately how long the process will take and how far it has already
progressed. The same applies to the signal strength, the charge status
and the volume control. In each case, visualisation can show minimum
and maximum values and thus display the current value in a meaningful
context, which makes the interpretation easier and faster. Other
applications that are suitable for analogue visualisation are file size,
available memory space and call charges.
Only if display space is available should non-essential information, which
allows a higher degree of precision, be added. For example, combining 
a visual display such as a loading bar and adding a time estimate 
can help the user to make a more qualified decision whether or not to
download a file. 
Preview options for the content can be displayed temporarily. This preserves the
context and means that the decisions made on the next steps of navigation can be
more informed. For other techniques to make maximum use of the screen space, 
see Section A in Chapter 2.

Basic design exercise
Develop an organisational structure for your music collection. Try to develop a system for
each of the five organisational principles (LATCH), and then evaluate which of these
concepts could be combined effectively for a more specific application.
Organising information
According to the information architect Richard Saul Wurman, there are five
different categories that can be used to organise information, these are:
location, alphabetical order, time (sequence), category (context of
meaning) and hierarchy.
In computer-aided systems, the designer does not need to decide which of
these classifiers is the right one for the content that needs to be
organised. The designer can instead use several organisational criteria,
because the system is able to reorganise all data at any time and in
accordance with any predetermined category. This means that the same
information can be presented again and again, but in different contexts,
and this functionality can help the user to find and retrieve specific data
with ease.
In the digital medium, redundancy is positive. The anticipated questions
and expectations of the user should define the principles by which data is
to be organised. When determining these, the designer can make use of
the fact that the medium is able to respond to different user types and
needs by supporting redundant navigation paths. In return, the designer

Location: geographical position
These 16 cities can be organised by
very different principles. Depending on
the user’s question, the data can be
arranged in different ways. Sorting in
alphabetical order is useful for large
volumes of data, but it does not help to
answer questions such as: 
Where is Rome? 
Which city is the oldest? 
What language is spoken in this city?
Which city is the largest? 
Which city has most inhabitants?

Location
Sorting by geographical location is a powerful form of organisation, as
maps offer a very efficient background on which other types of information
can also be displayed.
The real location as an organisational criterion is increasingly important,
especially for portable devices. The ability to find the location of the user
and the device, for example, by a global positioning system, reverses the
relationship between the hardware and the software – the user becomes a
cursor in the real world. Location-based services use the information
about the location to simplify the navigation within a software application.
Hierarchical levels can be skipped because the geographical context
information has already been evaluated. To ensure that this organisational
criterion really makes things easier, the integration of the location must
not be automatic, otherwise there is a danger that the choice of available
options may be restricted.
Location-based services: navigation
through the hierarchy is simplified by
the fact that the device knows its own
location, and includes this in the user
guidance. For example, in New York, it
will recommend products and services
that are located in New York first.
The geographical location can serve 
as a backdrop for all other information. 
It can form the mental model into 
which other information can be saved,
such as size, population density, age or
native language.

 
4C
4A
4B
Complex data transactions and relationships can be portrayed in a visual
form by mapping, and data maps can have similar guidance functions as
those of a real geographical map.
Data maps impose spatial situations on abstract content and as such they
create meaning. Many concepts in our language use spatial relationships
to explain abstract concepts, for example, we may refer to ‘background
information’. If the data mapping relates to a chronological process, then
the mental model can even become a ‘roadmap’.
The location on the screen plays a decisive role in a very practical sense,
as the display is a surface on which information is localised. The
localisation of functions on the screen makes it easier to find them, and
thus helps the user to develop a routine in their use of the system.
The designer can also make use of the user’s spatial memory in the
development of small-screen interface by subdividing the available space
on the screen into specific functional zones and areas, and placing tools
and navigation aids at the edges of the screen. Spatial memory can also
be applied to unseen objects, such as pull-out menus or function bars. 
To fully make use of spatial memory, the basic functions must always be
placed at, or pulled out from, the same point on the screen.
Human spatial memory should be
exploited on small devices by assigning
certain functions to a fixed place on the
screen. The principle works even if
these functions are temporarily pushed
off the screen.

The circular arrangement of selection
points is called a pie menu. It is much
easier for the user to remember angles,
rather than the position of an item on a
list, as this takes full advantage of their
spatial memory.

Time sequence
Organisation by time sequence is an important navigation aid in computer-
aided systems. It is essential for users to be able to trace their activities
in virtual reality by reconstructing or retracing their actions on the basis of
the data trail that they created.
Time sequence can easily be displayed in the form of a list; time context
requires a graphical presentation that indicates periods of time and the
duration of events. When ordering events by time, the reading direction on
the horizontal axis is from left to right: the past is found to the left, and
the future to the right. On the vertical axis, the past is viewed at the
bottom and the future at the top. In both cases, the present should be the
zero point on the scale, and it should be visible when the application 
is opened.
Alphabetical order
Sorting by alphabetical order is a robust form of organisation. It enables 
a large number of elements to be made available in a sorted list, and 
is used particularly for sorting names and lexicographical collections. It is
especially useful on small-screen devices to structure long lists via the
option to pre-select the first letter. To increase the ease of navigation, it
should also be possible to scroll the alphabetical list continuously. If the
form of interaction is limited, for example, in small mobile devices or
navigation systems in cars, the input can be simplified by reversing the
selection principle. For each letter entered, the scrollable list becomes
shorter and shorter until the selection is so small that the desired term or
name can be seen.
The principle of reverse selection
offers the fastest navigation in
alphabetical lists.
If the time sequence is arranged
vertically, the latest entry should always
be placed at the top. This ensures that
any new entry is visible immediately
and long scrolling is avoided.
The starting point for all
chronologically-organised 
data should be the present.

 
4C

4B
Hierarchy
The most common form of hierarchical order is by importance. This
organisational principle is however, very subjective, and therefore it can
cause the same problems as does arranging the content by meaning
context. However, in the case of hierarchical organisation it is possible to
derive the user’s importance for each item via the frequency of use, and
thus change the order dynamically. This principle is very suitable for small-
screen devices because it helps to make effective use of the limited
space and shortens the navigation paths.
If the relevance of a function is derived by other criteria than the frequency
of use, the underlying algorithms can only ever be very incomplete
approximations of the complex behaviour of the user. By making small
assumptions, however, ease of navigation can be improved, and this is
demonstrated by the results listings of websites such as Google and
Amazon. Google sorts the search results by the number of links that refer
to a site, and Amazon derives patterns from the buying activities of its
customers by comparing users with similar interests.
Category 
Organising the content by meaning context is the most subjective of the
organisational principles. Here you will find the greatest potential for
discrepancy in the perception and evaluation of the content, and there is
often a difference between the ideas of the developer and the ideas of 
the user.
Due to the restricted space on small screens, this discrepancy can force
the user to spend a frustrating amount of time looking for their desired
function because the structure is split into more hierarchical levels 
than on larger screens. Organisation by meaning context, which is often
the main level of navigation for a software interface, should always be
developed in conjunction with potential users or, at the very least, the
concepts should be tested with the target users. In familiar applications, it
will be important that the subdivision of the content matches the user’s
already established mental model. In unfamiliar applications, the basic
organisational context must be communicated clearly so that the user can
create an adequate mental model.
Organising the content by meaning context supports a user’s spatial
memory, as the concepts developed are often familar to those found in
the real world, for example folders and filing systems.
Redundancy is positive: in digital
media, the data assignment may be
simplified. If the cities are organised 
by continent, for example, a special
case such as Istanbul can be listed
under both categories without creating
confusion for the user.
The hierarchical order changes with
use. The more often a function is called
up, the more prominently it is displayed.

Large Structures on Small Screens
Shallow hierarchies 
A decisive factor in determining the intuitive use of an application is
whether it is possible for the user to gain a general overview of the system.
Shallow hierarchies are a good way to achieve an overview because they
permit a synchronous display of all options available to the user. This 
is especially relevant for subjects in which the user may find it difficult to
follow the logic of the organisational criteria. In such a case, the parallel
display of all options can help the user to identify what they are looking for
because there is no need to guess which category the term comes under.
However, this advantage of a shallow hierarchy can become a disadvantage
if the number of options is so great that they cannot be displayed
simultaneously or if the display becomes too confusing. The danger of
overloading the interface is one of the main problems in adapting shallow
hierarchies to small-screen devices.
In this example of a shallow hierarchy,
the user moves directly from the
navigation level to the content level.
Planning the hierarchy and deciding how steep or shallow the navigation structure should be is a
task that the designer should tackle in conjunction with all other disciplines involved in the
development process. The hierarchy determines the structure of the underlying data structures,
such as databases and searches. It also has a great influence on the design options of the
interface, for example, which navigation elements must be available at which point. 
Also refer to the planning and visualisation techniques for complex structures in Chapter 9.

 
4C
4A
4B
Steep hierarchies
Steep hierarchies break down a subject area into a branched structure
that is organised by categories. An advantage of this model is that it offers
a limited number of options on every level of the hierarchy. On each level,
the user must decide which branch of the tree they wish to progress to.
The selection is confirmed to move down through the hierarchy. To move
back upwards through the structure, a ‘back’ command is needed.
A steep decision-making pyramid with a branch-like structure is difficult
for the user to navigate in complex applications because it can be hard to
understand the organisation of the content, and this may lead the user to
guess whether the desired content will be found under a certain category.
This necessitates a great deal of clicking in order to look inside the
available categories, and a ‘back’ command is required after every wrong
guess. This is partly because the hierarchy that a software development
engineer considers appropriate may not be in accordance with the user’s
priorities and their subjective ideas of a hierarchy.
In this example of a steep hierarchy,
the main navigation level leads to
subcategories, and the content within
these is then broken down into several
further levels.

Is this family-tree hierarchy suitable for use as a structure for an interactive program? 
Are there alternative criteria for sorting the animals, that could make a search for

Time-based arrangements are most easily displayed on small-screen 
devices in the form of tables. The annotations and tables for days, months
or public holidays are familiar from printed diaries or calendars and
therefore easy to use. The meaning context of years, months, days and
hours is so straightforward that navigation between each of these ‘zoom
levels’ works even without further explanation. However, this presentation
breaks the time continuum down into discrete steps, which can make it
more difficult to present periods and processes.
Calendar Function on Mobile Phones:
the presentation of calendars in small
spaces is more or less standardised.
The linear progress of time is broken
down into separate views, such as
months and days, but some of the
contextual information is lost in the
process. Periods that last longer than
about two months are difficult to
visualise, and so they are difficult to
manage. Equally, showing appointments
at the monthly ‘zoom level’ is a
challenge for the designer.

The ability to link information about time and location is a distinct
advantage of the digital medium (compared with a conventional desk
diary), but synchronous visualisation of this information on small-screen
devices is a major challenge.
Magic Link PDA/Magic Cap Software
(Sony, 1993): this device extends the
classic desktop metaphor to include
additional functions, such as the
internet. 
The metaphor is further extended by
the addition of further locations, for
example, the archive. There is also the
possibility of going into town to shop.
This metaphor is immediately
understood by the user because it is
based closely on reality.
(482 x 322 pixels)
Embedding complex structures into closed metaphors is a useful way to
support intuitive use. However, this form of closed narrative framework is
difficult to scale. This framework is limited when there is a large volume of
data, and it is difficult to expand, so new data cannot usually be
integrated in a logical way. 
Activis Scheduler: this concept for 
an organisational tool enables
appointments to be planned and
administered in their spatial context. 
All appointments that are entered 
in the vertical time bar are also shown
in their spatial relationship to each
other on the map. This means that
the travel can be efficiently planned 
by ensuring that appointments that 
are spatially close together are also
timed closely together.

WAP Page (Ternopil): on a small,
monochrome mobile phone display it
can be very difficult to present large
structures in an understandable form.
The visualisation of spatial information is particularly difficult on small
screens because context and reference points are always necessary if the
user is to get their bearings. The scale of the display must be sufficent
enough not only to show enough detailed information, but also enough
contextual information. This means that the presentation form, perspective
and degree of abstraction must be selected very carefully. If it is not
possible to display the information at a single representation scale, a
combination of several representations must be considered.
Navigation System XYZ (Sony): this
device incorporates a larger screen 
(6.5 inches), a higher resolution
(1458x790 pixels) and the use of
colour, and these features allow a 
much clearer presentation of spatial
information. Extra guidance is provided
by highlighting prominent buildings. 
Navigation System XYZ (Sony): a variety
of presentation modes are available in
this system and the user can choose
among them depending on their situation
and preferences. In a perspective view,
a realistic presentation of buildings is
not appropriate because it would
obscure some of the streets. To
overcome this, nearby structures are
shown in a transparent representation.

Gestures can also be used as a form of interaction. See also Chapter 3: Physical interaction.
Navigation System XYZ (Sony):
peripheral use of a device in a car 
is made easier by gesture control. 
For example, a circular movement to
the left zooms the display to the
appropriate point, and a movement 
in the form of a roof takes the user
back to the ‘home’ page.
The ‘Halo’ Concept: usually the extract
of a map is so small that destinations
which are further away cannot be
viewed in the same screen. Use of the
halo technique means that destinations
outside of the display are represented
by a hint of a circle. The circle is the
most stable geometrical form, so even
a small section of the circumference is
enough to indicate the direction and
distance of the remote destination. As
the viewer moves closer to the
destination, the circle becomes smaller
and smaller until it is eventually replaced
by the destination point.
(Visualization and Interaction Research
Group at Microsoft Research: Baudisch
and Rosenholtz, 2003)
Navigation System XYZ (Sony):
another display option is the rendered
perspective model. The system shows
the user’s travel route by use of virtual
yellow road markings. The addition of a
bird’s-eye view offers a greater preview
area and helps the user to interpret the
perspective display correctly. The design
of the virtual traffic signs is closely
based on reality.

Large Structures on Small Screens
Circuits form a physical part of the computer.
Circuits translate the machine code into on or off
signals: 1 = on and 0 = off
Applications are software programs that can be
used on a computer, for example word processing.
A higher programming language works
independently of the machine. The instructions can
be formulated to address specific problems, and
special programs translate the instructions into
machine code. This translation can be done line-
by-line by use of an interpreter, or before the
program starts by a compiler.
Another distinguishing feature of programming 
languages is the underlying concept. The three
classification concepts are procedural, logical and
object-oriented programming languages.
Assembler is a simple programming language that
is directly related to the physical hardware, such
as the processor type on which the program will
later be run. 
Machine code is the binary code, or language,
which is understood and implemented by the
hardware. 
The operating system administers all of the
hardware components of a device, controls 
all processes and routines, and provides the 
user interface.
Communication between hardware and software

The distinction between operating systems and applications
enables a range of functions to be extended flexibly; but this
modular approach increases both the proportion of redundant
processes and the risk of system errors and crashes.
As a result of the development of processor performance, an
increasing number of systems are equipped with an operating
system. Even small mobile devices are given operating
systems that bring their range of functions close to those of 
a PC. This means that PC applications can now be adapted for
small-screen devices.
Powerful programming languages, such as C, are used to write
operating systems, applications or robot controls. As
processors are becoming more powerful, these languages are
increasingly used for microprocessors in embedded systems,
although the code that they generate is more general and
therefore less economical.
The direct adaptation of the hardware is especially economical,
and it makes the processes fast. The disadvantage is the
awkward programming, which can easily lead to errors. Today’s
processors largely compensate for the difference in speed
between higher programming languages and assembler-
generated code.

The further the interaction level moves away from
the hardware, the slower and more error-prone the
system becomes. 
The more an application relies on the hardware,
the slower and more inflexible the evolutionary
development of the software becomes.
In addition to these powerful programming languages, 
there are also languages that were developed for special
applications, such as SQL, which is used to program
databases.
Some programming languages, such as Smalltalk and Java,
use a ‘virtual machine’ for the execution of the program. This
means that the applications are independent of the operating
system and can be transported like normal files.
The hardware and software can interact in different
ways in small-screen devices, and this affects the
design possibilities. The development of portable
devices follows the underlying concept of desktop
computers, as such there is a trend towards
modular concepts, which contain operating systems
and applications.

To scale applications to different mediums of output, and varying

The Network on Small Screens
Here we look at the new services that are emerging 
for small-screen devices, among which location-based
services seem to be the most appropriate for the
medium. Coupled with this, traditional entertainment
media such as radio or television are developing
programmes that are suitable for small-screen display.
This section offers a glossary of terms to help decode
network lingo. Acronyms from XML to UMTS and the
major milestones of the telecommunication roadmap 
are explained.

The Network on Small Screens
A community where the user represents
themselves with virtual identities (or
avatars), works well if it consists of
3–20 persons. However, if it consists
of a larger number of users then, this
form of access can no longer be
presented successfully.
The presentation of all of the shopping
sites on the world wide web as a virtual
high street only works to a limited
extent because there are just too many
options, so the street would be
infinitely long. By limiting the search
criteria the range of options can 
be concentrated so that a pictorial
metaphor will work. 
Lists, extendable menus or forms that
only show a fragment of the content –
because the designer did not anticipate
that the content entered might be longer
than the space that was permitted –
are far from ideal. A possible solution
for this problem is the incorporation of
functionality that allows dynamic
changes to the text size.
Most of the content that is displayed on small screens is not composed of local data;
more and more information is instead called up via a network when it is needed. This
increases the challenge for the designer, who must increasingly consider usage
scenarios and functionality as well as create space for them in the navigation structure
and on the display. The designer is no longer dealing with the specific information
design, but instead has to develop the rules by which the content is presented on the
screen. This means that all concepts must be scalable; they must work equally well with
large and small quantities of data. 
Databases
Most electronic information is stored in databases, retrieved dynamically
and incorporated into the layout. In many cases the database structure is
either fixed, or the data are drawn from existing databases. To design the
optimum concept for use and an attractive and intuitive visual software
interface, the designer should find out as much as possible in the concept
development phase about the information that can be retrieved from the
database and the structure within which it is stored and linked.
Metaphors
Metaphors, which are often used in virtual communities, are especially
difficult to scale. The more specific the reference to reality, the more
difficult it is to maintain an overview of a growing volume of data. The
advantage of intuitive access is lost because of the lack of clarity.
The automatic rendering of scroll bars
to navigate the screen is not an elegant
design solution, simply because they
will not always be necessary.

The structure of the database
determines how convenient it is to use.
If it does not offer enough fields to save
all of the required information, (as in
example 1a), the user will have to
improvise and create a second record
for the same purpose. 
The existing database structure is the predominant factor that determines
how easily a user can access and organise the desired information. 
A convenient user interface in which the
user can add any number of entries to
a single record requires a careful
design of the underlying database
structure (as in example 2b). Here, the
designer is responsible for acting on
behalf of the user and advocating this
solution, even though it requires a
greater amount of programming work.

The Network on Small Screens
Different output media
The networking of different computer platforms presents another challenge
to the designer, as many applications are published at the same time on
different output media. The designer must ensure that the application 
is implemented in an appropriate way for the output medium, and is still
recognisable across different media. Differences in the screen format,
display quality and form of interaction have to be taken into account –
sometimes using the same colour scheme might be the only link between
two different output media.
Depending on the device and application in question, the designer may
need to develop different output masks that are geared to each medium.
In some cases, such as the special browsers for smart phones, the
browser implements the HTML code specifically for this screen size, but in
other cases, special HTML pages must be created in order to achieve the
best possible display. In each case, the designer must analyse the usage
concept and then define the volume of the content and the available
options for each output device.
Creative alternative categories, such
as searches for an alternative travel
destination with the same temperature
or journey time as a previously
searched destination, requires
additional tables in the database, which
are linked via these alternative
categories of information.
Keeping with the travel theme, when
making bookings, the user often has to
input exact journey details and is then
given a negative response because the
system fails to find an exact data
match. It is a better solution if the
system allowed the user to define a
frame within which they wish to travel,
because this would increase the 
number of results.

If the project is on a larger scale, and a new database structure is
developed specifically for an application, the designer must be actively
involved from the outset. In their role as the user’s advocate, the designer
should anticipate and develop all the possible scenarios for use, and
create a list of requirements for the underlying organisational structure of
the data. If this is not done there is a risk that the designer will merely 
be able to compound inconsistent or complicated user dialogues by means
of the form and design.

Where the same content is displayed
and manipulated on a PC and on a
small portable device, recognition is an
important factor. Although the
configuration, range of functions and
the form of interaction are different, 
the design should create a formal
similarity in order to reduce the amount
of time the user requires to adapt to
the new interface.
If the software comes from two different
manufacturers, in this case iCal from
Apple (left), and a calendar from 
Sony Ericsson (above), this is likely to
impair the consistency of the display.
This separation of form and content means that the designer must
develop an abstract design grid, generalise their design resources and
develop usage rules. In practice, this means that the interface tends to
become visually poor and monotonous because defining rules that can
always be applied is a far more complex affair than defining stand-alone
individual solutions. Yet at the same time, the challenge for the designer
is to be far more systematic and functional in the way that they work.
Generally, this helps to make the user guidance consistent, so that the
user is not faced with any surprises, but in individual cases it can 
also make the navigation logic more complicated because it is impossible
to provide customised solutions.
Advanced design exercise
Adapt a familiar website for a small-screen device. What would Amazon or
eBay look like on a smaller screen? How can the characteristics of a brand
and its website be preserved, but at the same time creatively adapted to suit
the changed conditions of the screen size and form of interaction?

Universal Remote Control irRemote
(Psiloc): the realistic rendering of 
a physical remote control enables the
user to operate the software easily.
Small mobile devices can offer a wide range of informative and
entertaining functions. Initially, classic formats were adapted 
from other media forms, such as radio or television. To make such 
applications easy to handle, it is now common for the interface 
to borrow control elements from the old medium.
Visual Radio (Nokia 3230, Nokia
7710): can now transmit information
about the music that is being played
(such as the name of the artist) or the
commercial advertising (such as where
to buy the recording) at the same time
as supplying the audio function.
Supplementing the main medium of the
radio by a visual, interactive platform
allows rapid access to background
information and direct participation
from the listener.

a map that is easy to understand.
The creation of new service ideas for mobile use is still very much in its
infancy. The fact that a personal mobile device will know where it is and
what the preferences, habits and needs of its owner are, will necessitate
the development of a whole range of new applications. Once realised, 
the small screen will act as a digital information level that is brought into
line with the analogue situation which the user is in. An important role of
the designer is to continually identify the needs of users and to develop
scenarios for appropriate service concepts.

Infrared is a band of the electromagnetic spectrum
usually used for short range (up to 20 feet), and
air-based data transmission. Data are transmitted
from point to point by infrared light, which requires
a line of sight between two devices. The IrDA
(Infrared Data Association) sets standards for
using infrared transmission to ensure that
communications between different computers,
PDAs, printers, digital cameras, remote controls,
etc. are all compatible with one another.
Java is a programming language that is specifically

Mbps, Mb/s or Mbit/s: abbreviations of Megabits
per second. A measure of data transfer speed on
networks (one megabit equals one million bits).
MBps or MB/s refers to MegaBytes per second,
which is the unit of measurement for data transfer
speed for interfaces like USB.
Roaming is the means by which a mobile phone
links up to different base stations as they come
within range. International roaming means that 
a customer can make use of other networks when
abroad. Some networks offer different charges 
and facilities for users travelling abroad.
WAP: Wireless Application Protocol is a secure
specification that allows users to access
information via hand-held wireless devices.
Wi-Fi is short for ‘wireless fidelity’. The Wi-Fi
Alliance seeks to promote wireless networking

specification. Products approved by the Alliance
receive the Wi-Fi certified seal of interoperability.
The maximum range is anything up to about
100 meters.
Bandwidth describes the amount of information that
a communication channel can carry. Analogue
bandwidth is measured in hertz (Hz), cycles per
second. Digital bandwidth (bps or b/s) is measured
in bits per second. High bandwidth data connections
permit internet users to download files rapidly and
to view high-quality, real-time video.
Bluetooth is an open specification for seamless
short-range wireless data and voice communications
between mobile and stationary devices. For
instance, it specifies how mobile phones, computers
and PDAs interconnect with each other, with
computers, and with office or home phones. The
first generation of Bluetooth permits the exchange
of data up to a rate of 1Mbps, even in areas with
a great deal of electromagnetic disturbance.
Bluetooth transmits and receives via a short-range

The generations of mobile communications
1G: the first generation of systems for mobile
telephones was analogue, circuit switched and only
carried voice traffic using frequencies around
900MHz. The analogue phones used in 1G were
less secure and more prone to interference when
the signal was weak. Analogue systems include
AMPS, NMT and ETACS.
2G: second-generation protocols use digital
encoding and include GSM, D-AMPS (TDMA) and
CDMA. These protocols support high-bit rate voice
communication and limited data communication.
They offer auxiliary services such as data transfer,
fax, SMS and WAP internet access. Most 2G
protocols offer different levels of encryption.
2.5G protocols extend 2G systems to provide 
additional features such as packet-switched 
connection (GPRS) and enhanced data rates
(HSCSD, EDGE). 2.5G is the most significant 
step towards 3G, as it requires similar business
models and service and network architecture.
WLAN: a Wireless Local Area Network that uses
high frequency radio signals to transmit and
receive data over distances of a few hundred feet.
XML: eXtensible Mark-up Language, is a pared-
down version of the Standard Generalised Mark-Up
Language (SGML), designed especially for 
Web documents. It allows designers to create their
own customised tags, enabling the definition,
transmission, validation, and interpretation of data
between applications and between organisations.
3G: third-generation protocols support much 
higher data rates, and are intended for advanced
applications. 3G is known as IMT-2000
(International Mobile Telecommunications-2000) by
the ITU and is commonly implemented as UMTS,
and as CDMA2000 in North America.
UMTS: the Universal Mobile Telecommunications
System is a mobile communications system that
offers direct connection between terminals and
satellites. UMTS will facilitate the delivery of new
services and capabilities in low-cost, high-capacity
mobile communications, with data rates of up to
2Mbps and worldwide roaming.
3.5G is an improvement of the third generation
systems that benefits from the HSDPA-enabled 
W-CDMA infrastructure.
HSDPA: High Speed Downlink Packet Access is a
packet-based data service feature of the WCDMA
standard, which provides a downlink with data
transmission up to 8–10Mbps.
WCDMA: Wideband Code Division Multiple Access
is one of two 3G standards that uses a wider
spectrum than CDMA, and can therefore transmit
and receive information faster and more efficiently.
4G: fourth generation WWAN communications
systems are characterised by high-speed data
rates of 20+Mbps, suitable for high-resolution
video and television. Initial deployments are 
anticipated in 2006–2010.
WWAN: the Wireless Wide Area Network uses
common carrier-provided lines.

The entertainment value of small-screen devices increases 
with the growing quality of their displays. As well as small game
devices, mobile phones and organisers offer rich game
environments through enhanced motion and sound capabilities.

Entertainment on Small Screens
Here we look at applications such as miniature 
photo-editing, and explore the possibility that their 
added entertainment value could soon provide just 
as much fun as the small-screen versions of established
computer games.
In this section we offer a classification model for games
of any kind. We also look at the market share of
entertaining applications in different regions around 
the world.

 
108|109 Entertainment on Small Screens
Entertainment value
Since the invention of graphical user interfaces there has been a
fundamental rule for design: no interface shall be without an entertainment
value of some description. This especially applies to the design of small-
screen devices because they are far more personal than a personal
computer. The resolution of the screens that are used will soon be a
negligible constraint, but the limitations of physical size will remain 
an important parameter. Nevertheless, small-screen devices can develop
a range of entertainment values.
Games
Games are the high-art form of interaction design, as well as an arena for
the experimental exploration of new forms of interaction, because the
user’s participation in a game is always optional. If the game is not fun, 
or if the way it works is too complex, it will not be used. Many interaction
components have developed from control features in games, such as 
the joystick.
The logic of games
Games on small, portable devices are often used to simply pass the time
en route. The user should understand the concept of the game immediately
so that play can commence without delay. This is why traditional or classic
games are often adapted for the small screen; they work at once 
because they are already familiar. The forms of interaction within the game
however, must be adapted to the possibilities of the device. The mini
joystick, which is present on most devices, is a relatively powerful input
element. The integration of position and acceleration sensors into small-
screen devices enables new physical games to be developed.
Nowadays, most people own a small, portable device of some sort and, equally, most
tend to carry their device with them at all times. Except for pure game consoles, these
devices contain confidential personal information and are individually configured by the
user. The supplementary entertainment value of the devices has increased with the
growing quality of the display, the wealth of new digital services available and increasing
transmission speeds. Animated icons, background graphics, polyphonic ring tones and
music clips also offer a wealth of bespoke options that are intensively and consistently
used, particularly by young target groups. Additionally, games that can be downloaded
on to the device or played online are becoming increasingly popular.

Many first generation digital games, such as Pacman or Tetris, have
survived in their original basic format, and they only need to be
adapted to accommodate the latest technical standards. See also
Section B in this chapter.
Long shots or close-ups work best on
small screens. With middle zoom levels,
the user is unable to see the detail or
the context. 
Most small-screen devices have 
a portrait screen format. This might
contradict our viewing habits for 
moving pictures, so the designer may
need to rethink the selection of the
extract shown. 
On small-screen devices using motion
to attract the user’s eye is a powerful
technique.
Advanced design exercise
Adapt the game of chess so that it is suitable for a small
screen of 240x320 pixels with 262,000 available colours.
Design clearly distinguishable chess pieces, and consider the
manner of interaction via use of soft keys and a mini joystick. 
Moving image
In animation clips or video extracts, the size and proportions of the
display will determine the choice of motif and the extract shown. Complex
scenarios and camera-panning techniques in which the focus of the action
is difficult to follow should be avoided. The contrast between dynamic and
static image elements is the main design feature that should be
incorporated on small-screen devices. Focal ranges such as close-ups or
long shots work best on the small screen, either to convey detail (such as
facial expressions), or to give an overview of the situation. The fact that
the context in which small screens are used is so varied means that
differences in colour and brightness may need to be exaggerated to
ensure that the whole sequence will work in daylight.
Sound
Sound is a significant entertainment factor that can make the handling of
a device easier and more enjoyable by providing positive support for the
user’s interactions. When sound is used in games, it can be annoying if it
is constantly repeated without any variation, but as the storage space 
of devices increases, more subtle and varied sound effects can be
created and incorporated. However, peripheral use of devices in public
places can restrict the use of sound, therefore good games should work
equally well without sound, otherwise the user may be dependent on 
using headphones. 
For audio devices, headphones make the sound a very personal and
intense experience for the user. They help the listener to focus as they
prevent any surrounding acoustic interruption. Unlike image, here the size
of the output device is of no relevance.

Deco Mail (NTT DoCoMo 900i Series):
with rich text massages a variety of
creative messaging designs are
possible for mobile phones that have

possible to integrate graphics and 
other files in the message.
ASCII Art: pictures can be generated by
using text symbols. ASCII art uses the
screen as a canvas and applies the text
input of the mobile phone in surprisingly
creative ways.
The desire for individual and enhanced forms of expression continues to
stimulate the development of entertainment applications. The small
screen has long been established as an independent medium and the art
of being creative with limited resources in a small space has led to a
variety of expression and forms a whole new type of aesthetics.

A consistent classification system for all games is
difficult because most games are a unique mixture
of different components and categories. The main
parameters to classify games are the factors of
chance, skill, strategy and time.
Inventing a new game that works is not easy.
Classical gaming patterns, such as jump and run,
are often reworked. They are given a different
narrative framework, and a new and original
interaction is created for the game. Role-playing
and simulation are game patterns that are based
on a carefully constructed narrative framework.
Playing games is part of the human nature; many
games that are played today are hundreds of years
old. Games of chance using dice, for example,
have existed for almost 3,000 years.
Our motivation is to challenge destiny, compete
with other players or improve our own
performance. Most classical games have been
adapted for digital media and are now also
available in a suitable format for small screens.
The success of Tetris is perhaps due 
to the fact that all four factors play 
a role – it is a time-critical game that
also combines the factors of chance,
skill and strategy. Equally Super Mario
is a time-critical jump-and-run game
that combines chance and skill.
Classic games are now very popular in
digital format, for example, dice games
are largely based on chance, and chess
is a classic game of strategy. Darts is a
pure game of skill, but car racing is a
time-critical game of skill. Poker
combines the factors of both chance
and strategy.
The categories below are very well
established, although they are
somewhat overlapping and inconsistent.
Many of the game developers reject
existing and established categories and
prefer to declare their newly developed
game to be in a class of its own.

In the first part of this chapter we explore the art of typography
and how it can be translated to the digital domain in general, and
to the small screen in particular. We examine ways to enhance
readability and focus on the dynamic representation of text 
and text input. Finally we discuss the design of icons, taking into
account parameters such as icon size, interaction style and
specific icon features.

Digital Hieroglyphs: 
Text and Icons on Small Screens
In the second section of the chapter we look at different
examples of typography on small-screen displays. We
review the additional items of screen content, such as
pictures and movies, which text and icons need to
complement. In addition, we present a collection of icons
that serve to demonstrate the variety and potential of
visual communication.
In this section we show a selection of typefaces and font
sizes that are suited for use on the small screen. We 
also explain the techniques of antialiasing and ClearType
and finally, deliver a short glossary of some of the
typographical terms that are relevant for small screens.

Text is the visual interface for language. In contrast to speech, which is linear and will
usually need to be heard in full before the listener can understand the meaning, written
text offers a variety of possibilities for access and use. Written text can be read
thoroughly, skimmed through or it can be ‘scanned’ for keywords or phrases. Although
small-screen devices are already multimedia machines, the incorporation of text on the
display will play a decisive role as an information medium. This is probably because 
the transmission of information by the written word, particularly in a public setting, can
be done far more discreetly than by the spoken word.
Text
The presentation of text on small-screen devices is a special challenge for
the designer, and the primary motive must be to ensure legibility. The
most significant factor that affects legibility is the environment that the
device will be used in most frequently, for example, will the lighting
conditions be ambient or will the user be in a position to concentrate fully
on the screen? Fundamentally, the designer must develop a concept that
works in the worst possible conditions, such as direct daylight and
peripheral use, to ensure that the device will be ‘useable’ all of the time.
The most important contrast level on screen-based media is the brightness
contrast. Small-screen devices today are not yet sufficiently light-intensive
to be clearly legible under direct sunlight, yet the maximum contrast level
that will achieve optimum legibility under direct sunlight, is blinding when
used under subdued lighting conditions. Some devices, such as navigation
systems, are already able to adapt their display to the changing light
conditions by offering a day mode and a night mode. This allows a more
finely differentiated design and a greater density of detail in the
information displayed. In the future we are likely to see devices that have
built-in brightness sensors, which have the ability to make similar
adjustments smoothly and automatically.
The brightness contrast must be greater for the display of text on small
screens than for desktop applications. Whereas a brightness contrast 
of 30% is clearly legible on larger screens, the contrast values on 
smaller screens should be at least 50% in order to ensure good legibility
in all situations.
The default text/background screen
contrast is to position light-coloured
type on a dark background. The opposite
contrast should only be used if paper is
being simulated, for example, in 
desktop-publishing programs.

Type with an upper case height of 
16 pixels can be displayed at very
different sizes depending on the
resolution of the screen.
If colours are incorporated in the text design, the differences between the intrinsic
brightness of each colour used must also be taken into account to ensure the best
possible legibility. See also Chapter 8: Layout and Colour on Small Screens.
An intricate background always makes
legibility difficult. It should especially be
avoided on small-screen devices.
The resolution of small screens is now considerably higher than the
resolution of most desktop monitors. Unfortunately, this relatively high
resolution is not yet supported by the operating systems of all devices.
This means that graphics and icons are presented very clearly, but type
still has clearly visible ragged edges when displayed. The varied resolution
values of small-screen devices means that the points size or pixel count
can only be used as a rough guide to the actual type size rendered on
screen. As such it is important to carry out careful research into the
technical specifications of the device and take these into account when
selecting the type and type size to be displayed. 
Complex or intricate screen backgrounds that do not offer a sufficient
constant contrast to the text displayed in the foreground should be
avoided in the design and development process. If this is unavoidable, in
the case of control functions on camera displays for example, either 
an extremely rare signal colour can be used, or the type should have a
contrasting outline to ensure permanent legibility.

Digital Hieroglyphs: Text and Icons on Small Screens
The more detailed a font is, the more
pixels it requires for adequate display. 
The strongly modulated characters of
Garamond cannot be displayed at a
height of six pixels; it requires at least
20 pixels for adequate rendering. In
comparison, transfer is optimised to a
character height of six pixels.
The selection of fonts and type sizes for small-screen devices is subject
to the same rules that are applied to all screen applications: the smaller
the text, the more the font should be adapted to the special features of
the screens. For large headlines or decorative textual elements, it may be
possible to incorporate fonts with strongly modulated line widths, such as
serif typefaces. However, for body text, a geometrically-regular font that
has an even line thickness, orthogonal lines and small radii should be
used instead. The relatively narrow column width for text on small screens
must also be taken into account, this means that a narrow font should be
chosen for body text so that as many words as possible can be fitted on a
line and reading can therefore flow comfortably.
For very small text, such as the text on navigation elements and menus, 
a font that is specifically developed for the screen should be used. 
The likelihood that hand-held mobile devices will be used peripherally
should also be taken into account when selecting the type; all interaction
instructions should be easy to understand and succinct. Both the
typographical design and the type size must support this, and the text
should be displayed as clear, large and visible as possible. 
The use of halftone pixels to visually smooth the edges of a character is
called antialiasing. This technique was developed to better display non-
orthogonal lines on the screen. However, as a rule of thumb this technique
should not be applied to type that is smaller than 12 pt (with current
screen resolutions), as the text will be blurred and difficult to read on
screen. The size below which antialiasing should be avoided will vary
slightly for each font or type style, and should be checked experimentally
on the output device. 
This example shows the difference 
in display of text with (shown on the
bottom row), and without (shown on the
top row), antialiasing.

The highlighted text examples 
on the right demonstrate the better
alternatives for the screen. 
Increasing the letter spacing improves
the legibility of text on the screen.
The legible presentation of text on the small screen necessitates careful
adjustment of the letter spacing, word spacing and line spacing. As a
rule, letter and word spacing should be increased if antialiasing is used in
order to prevent the letters from sticking together. However, it is important
to maintain a careful balance between the separation of individual words
and the number of words that can be fitted on to a line. The line-spacing
value on screen must be increased by at least 10% compared with the
value on paper in order to ensure easy legibility.
Some highlighting methods are very suited to use on the small screen to
indicate headings, links or instructions; others though are less suitable.
The use of an italic type style is generally unsuitable for screen display
because the slanting strokes of the characters collide with the orthogonal
pixel grid of the screen, which makes the type display very irregular.
The use of bold type is suitable for highlighting text as long as the letter
spacing is sufficient enough to ensure that the characters do not run into
each other.
The use of colour is also a suitable highlighter, but to a limited extent;
partly because the low number of colours makes colour detection more
difficult and partly because no other colour combination can achieve the
same brightness contrast as black and white. However, if the main body
text has a slightly reduced contrast, such as the use of grey text on a
white or black background, the opposite colour (black or white) can then
be used for highlighting with the maximum contrast value. Another suitable
technique is to position highlighted text on to a colour background. 
This technique allows the colour to be recognised because the surface is
large enough. However, the intrinsic brightness of the colour must be
taken into account, and the highlighted text must be inverted if necessary. 
Interaction with small screens is typically characterised by greater user impatience and shorter reading times or
attention spans than with large screens. The interaction scenario must take this into account by displaying legible text
in small and easily manageable portions only. See also Chapter 3: Physical Interaction.
Highlighting methods: bold, italic or
coloured lettering, and coloured
backgrounds, can help distinguish
different textual elements.

Digital Hieroglyphs: Text and Icons on Small Screens
Automatic vertical scrolling.
Automatic horizontal single-line 
text scrolling.
Alternating display, for different 
types of content.
The positioning of text on the screen should not be envisaged as a static
layout, because the process of reading can be regarded as dynamic. As
such dynamic text display is a viable design option; this means that text
can be displayed in a ‘flowing’ movement to resemble the reading
process. Essentially the device automatically scrolls the display at reading
speed; examples of this are horizontal, single-line moving text displays
such as a news ticker on the television, or vertical scrolling of whole text
passages.
If horizontal single-line scrolling is incorporated, care must be taken to
ensure that the screen proportions and type size enable a minimum
number of words to be visible at the same time, otherwise it is difficult for
the user to grasp the content. Ideally, the user should be able to control
the speed of the text flow too. Horizontal single-line scrolling technology is
most suitable for short sentences and slogans.
Automatic vertical scrolling of text passages can help to make longer 
texts easier to read, as long as the user can adjust the scrolling speed to
their preferred individual reading speed or easily stop the flow of text. 
Vertical text scrolling helps to preserve the mnemonic quality of written
text – passages can be located with ease because the characteristic line
breaks are not changed.
Another technique that can be effective is alternating the display style of
different types of content. This can be used to present more information,
especially content in lists, without reducing the type size.

To make it easier to read type on small screens, there are a variety of 
text zoom techniques available that allow single lines or a whole passage
of text to be enlarged. A disadvantage of zooming is that if the text runs
across the whole screen in a single column, the type size must be
changed to display the text in magnified form, and doing so will alter the
line breaks. Depending on the zoom factor and the screen size, this can
lead to a very disjointed text display.
A solution to this is the use of semantic zoom. This technique reconfigures
the text according to the zoom factor used. If there is not enough available
space, only a few keywords are shown, but the content is shown in more
detail if space permits.
Text input by the user can be regarded as the greatest challenge for 
small mobile devices. The problem has less to do with the screen itself
and more an issue of physical interaction, which may differ considerably
from familiar text input techniques (such as via a keyboard), depending on
the device.
Graffiti techniques require a special alphabet to be learned in order to
enable unambiguous character recognition on a touchscreen, but these
techniques are relatively complicated. Multiple characters assigned to
single keys (such as those on a mobile phone), is probably the most
widespread text-inputting technique for small-screen devices.
Slightly larger devices that incorporate a touchscreen and stylus often
have virtual keyboards that appear temporarily on the screen. If the virtual
keyboards retain the familiar QWERTY layout, they offer the user a
synchronous optical display of all functions; this is the fastest way to
enter text on small screens without connecting an external keyboard.
There are many different concepts for one- or two-handed text-input interaction. 
See also Chapter 3: Physical Interaction.
Graffiti handwriting recognition: used
on the Palm OS, this requires a special
alphabet, which is then interpreted.

Icons often incorporate elaborate design
detail, because of the need to make
the interface easily discernable from
others; but these details can make the
interface harder to understand.
Originality in the choice of design and
the analogy may backfire if the user
does not understand the symbols used.
Using the principle of redundant coding
means that the extra picture caption
helps the user to interpret the icon.
(Nokia 6310)
Icons
Using icons on small screens is useful, and justifiably popular. Even if they
are not logically connected by a narrative framework, icons still allow fast
non-verbal communication between the system and the user. However,
designers must develop icons carefully if they are to be commonly
understood. For functions that were conceived in the digital arena, such as
email, the icons that are used to indicate them will often draw on the
established associations of their pre-digital form.
For an icon to communicate successfully, the metaphorical image and its
meaning in a digital context must be learned first. To ensure this,
redundant coding is used: the icon is supported by a textual explanation,
which the user can refer to if they are in doubt of the icon’s meaning. 
With use of the device the icon itself will offer enough information for the
user to understand. An additional option is to incorporate animated icons;
this method can be used to communicate more complicated information
and actions.
All stages of abstraction can be used in the design of icons. If the space
and the graphical capabilities of the device permit, photographic images or
sophisticated illustrations can be used. Equally, the smaller the amount of
available space and the more limited a device’s colour scheme is, the
more archetypical the icons should be.
The success of computer-assisted systems would be unthinkable without the use of
icons. The ‘graphical user interface’ (GUI), made the use of computers possible for non-
specialists. The desktop metaphor and its associated icons established a recognised
standard, which was representative of quite complex information exchanges between the
system and the user. Symbolic actions of the user, such as putting something in the
dustbin, translates what are actually complex information transactions into
understandable concepts, as they are borrowed from real life.
Icon alphabets work across language barriers; they form the traffic signs
of a digital application that the user looks for when they wish to navigate a
program. To avoid confusing the user and to achieve visual consistency, all
icons within a system should have the same degree of abstraction.

Basic design exercise
Develop an icon that represents the function ‘find a restaurant’. This icon should have the
capacity to be used at various display sizes and resolutions. 
Consider whether an animated icon could help to communicate the content more clearly.
For further examples see Section B in this chapter.
The gap between common sense and originality defines the window of
opportunity for the design of icons. Depending on the recipient and 
the application, the metaphorical image used may vary. The designer must
take into account whether or not the target group consists of users who
are experienced with digital media. The type of user will be a crucial factor
in the decision of whether an imaginative metaphor can be used, or if 
the icon should be more conventional and easy to understand.
For most applications, only the top level of the hierarchy and its
corresponding tools are described by icons. If the user then chooses to
navigate lower levels of the hierarchy, the additional options are displayed
as text descriptions. Icons therefore, are limited in their descriptive
capability; once a certain degree of complexity is reached, icons become
ambiguous and lose their advantages over text descriptions.
First level
Second level
The structure of a device’s navigation
levels will often determine icon use. At
the highest level the categories can be
represented by icons, but at the
secondary level the selection choices
are too specific to be unambiguously
represented by an icon.

Digital Hieroglyphs: Text and Icons on Small Screens
Direct input with a stylus changes the design criteria for icons, as an icon
can be selected very accurately. This means that icons can even be
displayed at the very small size of 9x9 pixels. For icons of this size to be
legible, it is necessary to use: strong contrasts, very simplified forms and
no antialiasing. However, colour coding at this size can be used, but only
to a limited extent because the space available is just not large enough to
distinguish the colours. It would be just about possible to use the two
signal colours of red and green because they are distinctive enough even
on small spaces.
In the quest for the optimum use of available space on a small screen,
the size of icons is a distinct advantage. Icons can offer a great deal of
information that simply could not be displayed in text form in the same
space. The size of an icon is directly connected to the user’s form of
interaction with the device, for example, if a stylus is used for input, the
element for selection can be displayed at a very small size.
Also, the arrangement of the icons on the screen display supports a
user’s spatial memory capacity. This means that functions can be found
faster because the user remembers both the icon and its position. This
applies to the main navigation levels such as those used in many mobile
phones and in the navigation and function bars of Pocket PCs.
To ensure that different colours can be clearly distinguished, the coloured area must
be of a sufficient size. See also Chapter 8: Layout and Colour on Small Screens.
Stylus-controlled interfaces allow the
smallest icons to be displayed.
Used as a label on a row of tabs, an
icon is remembered both by its
appearance as well as its location.

Interactive elements on touchscreens
should have a physical size of at least
15x15 mm, and the distance between
the elements should be at least 5 mm.
Direct interaction with a touchscreen is the most space consuming
technique. Icons that represent the options on a touchscreen must be large
enough to be selected by a fingertip, and this is usually a larger area than
an icon would need for visualisation. Displays with touchscreens therefore
have a much lower density of addressable interaction elements.
Increasingly, to circumvent this limitation, touchscreens work with gesture
recognition: the user carries out a metaphorical movement, which the
system understands as icon input. 
For those devices with indirect interaction by scroll wheel or jogdial the
icon also serves as a pointer device to tell the user where they are 
within the system. In order for this to work effectively the icon variations
must be visibly changed in its colour, size or contrast to clearly show
which option is currently active, and the icon must be allowed sufficient
space for this change to be clearly visible. If the change is also to 
be highlighted by an alteration in size, then the necessary space for the
maximum display size must be reserved around the icon. Icons are
typically between 16–32 pixels in size.
Each icon must have different display
states developed: active, inactive and
selected, so that the user will know
where they are in the system

Digital Hieroglyphs: Text and Icons on Small Screens
The legibility of a font on the screen is the
designer’s most important criterion. The selection
of a suitable font should first of all be determined
by the display quality on the target screen. The
more complex the font, the more pixels it requires. 
Type is measured in both points (pt) and pixels (px),
the values of each are only identical when type is
displayed at a resolution of 72 dpi. The point size
expresses the real height (1pt = 0.353mm) of 
a printed upper case character, but the pixel
size will be determined by the pixel size of the
output device.
As the resolution of the output device is rarely the
same as that of the working medium, it is
advisable to use the point size value and to create
the document at the same resolution as the output
device. This enables the designer to see on the
screen how many pixels are available to display a
character, and the physical reading size on 
the output device can be simulated by printing 
the display.
The display quality and legibility of most
fonts suffer below a font size of 14
pixels, because many typefaces can
only be displayed to a limited extent on
the pixel grid of the screen. To achieve
precise display and good legibility, even
with small type sizes, a variety of pixel
fonts have been developed that are
optimised for a specific number of
pixels. 
All fonts at 72 dpi without antialiasing.

All fonts at 72 dpi with antialiasing.
On the rectangular matrix of the screen, only
perfectly horizontal and vertical lines can be drawn
precisely. Displaying all other angles and curves
will create jagged edges. The technique of
antialiasing has been developed to reduce this
jagged effect by softening the edges, which visually
smoothens the lines. In this technique, the
adjoining pixels use colour shades to mediate
between the contours and smooth the edges. 
Type is predestined for antialiasing because the
characters frequently change stroke direction,
which is usually not in harmony with the pixel
matrix. The effect is reversed at type sizes of less
than 14 pixels – the type becomes blurred and the
characters run into one another.

Digital Hieroglyphs: Text and Icons on Small Screens
ClearType technology 
This is a new method to improve the display of
type edges. Here, the adjoining sub-pixels on the
left and the right of an illuminated pixel are
addressed, thus achieving a smoothing effect that
is similar to antialiasing. However, as Cleartype
technology only uses 1/3 of the width of a full
pixel, the resolution by this method is far higher
than with conventional antialiasing. ClearType
technology does not work if the screen can also be
operated in a position swivelled by 90° though.
In the design of icons, every pixel counts. To
achieve perfect results, icons should be created
as bitmap rather than vector file formats. A
recognised advantage of vector formats is that
they can be scaled, but for an icon this may mean
that it is not displayed to its best advantage on the
screen matrix. Antialiasing may even make the
problem worse, for example, lines of uniform
thickness might be displayed with different widths
depending on their position on the screen. When
designing icons, the design should always be
optimised for a specific size in pixels, which will be
determined by the device.
The exact size at which the icons are to be
displayed should be checked very carefully.
Alterations may be necessary and it is sometimes
helpful to correct the size by adding or removing
one pixel in order to achieve precise corners – a
missing corner pixel can create the impression of a
rounded corner.

Glossary
Font standards
Postscript fonts are a uniform digital font
standard. A Postscript font consists of two files:
one file has the bitmap for the screen and the
other has the vector data which the printer can use
to implement the font.
TrueType fonts are a platform dependent digital
standard. Here, the outline component and the
screen display are contained in a single file.
TrueType ESQ (Enhanced Screen Quality) fonts 
are TrueType fonts which are especially optimised
for display on screens.
OpenType fonts are a cross-platform font solution
as they can be displayed both on PCs and Macs.
OpenType fonts are optimised for the internet and
online publications, and can be embedded in files.
Typographical terms
Tracking describes the proportional distance
between all characters. The tracking value can be
changed and, it is advisable to increase the
tracking slightly for small type with antialiasing to
prevent the letters from running together.
Kerning refers to the varying distance between any
two individual characters. This laborious, fine-
tuning technique is only worth employing for
features such as menu item labels and icons.
Leading refers to the distance between one 
line and the next. Here, again, the standard value
is optimised for printing on paper. For screen
purposes, the leading should be increased slightly
if possible.
Hinting refers to the careful modification of fonts
and is implemented in the font set. It ensures that
the font is optimally displayed on the screen, even
in small type sizes.
Data formats
ASCII (American Standard Code for Information
Interchange) is the de facto standard in which the
binary code for each letter is defined.
Bitmap is a file format that stores the information
about an object in a matrix. Each cell of the matrix
corresponds to a value that can be expressed in
bits. Bitmap files cannot be increased in size
without a loss of quality. GIF, JPG and TIFF are
bitmap file formats.
Vector is a file format that stores graphics in the
form of a geometrical description. Vector graphics
can be magnified without any loss of quality. 
When they are reduced in size, the automatic
implementation on the pixel matrix of the screen
may be imprecise. Vector formats include EPS 
and SWF.
TXT is a text file that does not contain any
formatting.
RTF (Rich Text Format) is a file that contains
information about font and layout.
JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) is a
common file format for image data. It is available
at various levels of compression.
TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) is a very common
file format for high quality image material. It does
not generate any artificial compression and is
mainly used in the print sector.
GIF (Graphic Interchange Format) is a file format
for image data. It generates small files, but it only
has a maximum of 256 available colours. One
colour can be used as a transparency channel.
PDF (Portable Document Format) is a file format
that offers a digital counterpart to the printed
version of a document.

Chapter 8
This chapter examines the visual perception of the small screen,
and explains the seven most important Gestalt laws by outlining
their relevance to the design process for small screens.
Colour also plays an important role in creating small-screen
layouts that work effectively. This section explains how to
determine which colours will work best on small screens,
considering aspects such as contrast, brightness and saturation.

Layout and Colour on Small Screens
This section shows examples of small-screen interfaces
that use sophisticated colour palettes, which guide the
user and support the content.
The example of a well-designed mobile phone
demonstrates that a holistic approach to the design
process can generate great small-screen designs.
In this section we outline the basics about the additive
colour system and colour depth, and provide information
about the available colour depth on small-screen displays.

 
140|141 Layout and Colour on Small Screens
Organisation of the content by proximity.
The design of small-screen interfaces is subject to the same basic design principles and
considerations as those that apply to larger screens. However, the available space is
much smaller, and this limits the visual effect of the screen, because it only occupies 
a small part of the user’s field of vision. Design principles and techniques must therefore
be used in a clear and logical manner so that the user can quickly grasp the underlying
functionality. This means that all design resources must serve to visualise information,
structure the content and the interaction possibilities before any decorative and
illustration aspects are considered. An exception must be made for entertainment
applications, which are used for leisure purposes and as such are given far greater
attention and concentration by the user. 
Visual perception and the small screen
The Gestalt laws are a series of rules that formulate the psychological
perception characteristics of human beings. A designer can and should
use these principles to organise information logically so that the user 
can understand content quickly and clearly. The Gestalt laws are also
helpful as a guideline for the presentation of information on small-screen
interfaces. The following seven laws summarise the most important
principles of perception, and how they affect the design considerations of
small-screen interfaces.
The law of proximity states that elements which are arranged closely
together are perceived as a group or unit. This principle can be used in
the design of screens to organise the content and create units with a
common meaning. However, this design resource can only be used to a
limited extent on small screens due to the lack of available space;
allowing large gaps between different units in order to separate them
visually would waste valuable screen space. Usually it is sensible to
combine this principle with the principle of similarity.
The law of similarity maintains that elements with similar properties are
perceived as belonging to a group or unit. This principle can be used to
set apart interactive elements such as icons or to create units of meaning,
for example, by displaying related items in the same colour. The principle
is unaffected by scale, and therefore it is the most important
organisational resource for small-screen designs.
Organisation of the content by similarity
can also be combined with the principle
of proximity.

The arrangement at the top left can be
perceived as being a combination of
two different components, depending
on the way in which it is viewed. 
According to the law of good form the
arrangement at the top right is the
most simplified interpretation and as
such will be regarded as the ‘correct’
version by the user.
If the configuration shown at bottom left
is actually the correct interpretation, 
a gap should then be left between the
two components to ensure it is viewed
as intended by the designer.
Semantic grouping by geometrical
supplementation.
The law of closure states that our perception skills will supplement
incomplete elements. This unconscious process can be used to create a
visual link between the soft keys positioned on the hardware and the
functions that are displayed on the screen.
An important factor for the designer to note is that of all geometrical
figures, the circle is the element that is visually most robust. Even if only
fractions of the circle are present, the shape will be automatically
completed by the human perception system. 
The law of good form maintains that human perception will look for the
greatest degree of simplicity, clarity and regularity and then interpret this
form as a coherent element.
This principle can be applied deliberately, but it can also occur accidentally
if random common structures are incorporated within different on-screen
elements, as this will confuse the user and give the impression of a
connection that is not there. In the design process, care should be taken
to ensure that no unintended meta-structures occur that would make
reading the information more difficult.

 
142|143 Layout and Colour on Small Screens
Basic design exercise
Find one example of each of the seven Gestalt laws on the screen interface of a mobile phone.
Evaluate the application of each of the laws and ascertain whether the interface could be
designed in a more striking or effective manner.
The law of symmetry or regularity asserts the tendency of human
perception to search for regular forms. These regular patterns can be
created by equal gaps or by mirrored axes. A design that complies with
this law is generally regarded as harmonious and balanced. In screen
design it is sensible to take this need for harmony into account –
alternatively it can be violated deliberately in order to focus the user’s
attention or provide some form of warning information. 
The law of figure/ground states that a striking element will be perceived
as the relevant form, and any surrounding space is considered to be the
background. If the relationship between the fore- and background is not
clear, the user may be left confused and the elements displayed will be
regarded as ambiguous.
This principle must be taken into account in screen design whenever there
is any overlap between elements. Pop-up menus, pull-down menus and
windows should all be designed so that they are clearly in the foreground
of the display. This effect can be achieved by using brightness and
contrast levels to set the foreground clearly apart from the background.
Where there is overlap between
elements, the foreground should be
brighter than the background to make
the interpretation clear. To enhance 
this, it is also possible to temporarily
darken the background or reduce 
its contrast. 
Activation of elements can be 
indicated visually by departing from 
the regular form.
Symmetry can be used to create a
relationship between the content of
virtual and physical elements.

The law of continuity maintains that the human perception system does
not analyse each new component afresh, but instead draws conclusions
based on what it has already seen or experienced. This principle can be
observed, for example, when we read a word that has been spelt
incorrectly; the meaning of the word is likely to be plain from the context,
and so the error will not impinge our understanding of the text. Our ability
to complete visual patterns means that a user can understand abbreviated
text and concepts, and this can be exploited and used to save space on
small-screen designs.
The law of continuity also applies to the dimension of time. Similar images
seen in quick succession, one after the other, are perceived as being in
motion (this is the principle on which animation is based). It is important
to remember that this inertia of human perception must always be taken
into account. Therefore, warning information should always contrast clearly
with the standard display information on the screen so that it is not
overlooked by the user.
The law of continuity can be developed even further in interactive
processes such as using a mobile phone: the user’s actions should be
interpreted into plausible reactions by the interface and these should
continue the direction, radius and intensity of the movement by an
appropriate animation on the screen.

Layout and Colour on Small Screens
The absolute brightness contrast
should always be more than 50%; 
if necessary this value should 
be checked by converting the colours
to a greyscale. 
Colour on small screens
Some of the first colour screens used very strong colours; the possibility
of using colour led to much exaggeration and a number of almost
overpowering initial designs. The fact that small-screen devices are used
for shorter periods and with less user concentration than their full-sized
counterparts means that the designer must primarily use colour as a
means to make the operation of the device as simple as possible.
Therefore, colour should be used to direct the user’s focus so that they
can quickly distinguish what is important and what is unimportant and so
be swifter to make their interaction decisions. 
The effect of colour contrast and brightness also plays an important role
on small-screen interfaces. To understand the interaction concept, the
screen must be easy to read, even under adverse conditions. An important
consideration for legibility on both large and small screens is the contrast
in brightness.
Colour is displayed on the screen by mixing the three primary colours of
red, green and blue in an additive mixture. Colours generated by additive
colour mixing are characterised by the fact that their resulting secondary
colours will be significantly brighter than the primary colours because extra
light will have been transmitted. This will serve to exaggerate or distort
the intrinsic brightness of colour families, and affects the contrasts
between different colours and combinations of colour on the screen. An
absolute brightness contrast of 50% should be exceeded for all important
content on the screen.
Nowadays smaller screens can display an increasing number of colours. Originally only
black and white was available; this progressed to greyscale, and then colour screens.
The first colour displays only had a limited range of 16 colours, but nowadays 18 bit
screens with more than 200,000 colour shades are available. It is likely that true colour,
with its colour depth capacity of 24 bit or 32 bit, will soon be available for use on small-
screen devices, thus providing designers the same colour capabilities that they have on
larger screens. 
When selecting colours for the digital
medium, the intrinsic brightness of
colours in the RGB colour scale must
be taken into account – these are
different from the brightness effect of
CMYK colours. 
This difference cannot be shown
adequately in print, so the shift in
contrast is demonstrated here with a
brightness scale.

Brightness and contrast can be used systematically to enhance the the
depth of the screen. This means that content that is in the background or
is currently inactive should appear darker in colour and with lower contrast
and colour saturation. Content that is currently in use, such as dialogue
windows or pop-up menus, should appear brighter and have higher
contrast and colour saturation. These principles support figure/ground
perception and also help the user to grasp the structure and the focus of
interaction quickly.
Spatial impact can be further enhanced by a systematic selection of the
colour family. Cold colours can be used to visually form the background,
whereas warmer colours tend to appear in the foreground and closer 
to the user. 
To check the contrast and brightness that a design offers, it is helpful to convert it to greyscale. This enables the designer to check the
values irrespective of the colours selected. See also Section A in Chapter 9 for other prototyping techniques.
There are also physiological reasons that affect the choice of colour.
See also Section C in Chapter 8.
Basic design exercise
Develop a colour scheme that allows three different hierarchical levels to be displayed
simultaneously. Then find a suitable colour with which text can be displayed so that it is
clearly legible.

146|147 Layout and Colour on Small Screens
The saturation of a colour on the luminescent medium of a screen must
be used very sparingly. The rule of thumb is that the larger the surface
area, and the longer the time spent looking at the screen, then the less
saturated the colour should be. If this is not adhered to, the user’s eyes
may become tired and this can lead to unpleasant afterimages. If colour
saturation is used sparingly, an increase in saturation can then be used to
mark different priorities in the content. 
Another colour principle that must be taken into account when designing
screen interfaces is simultaneous contrast. This describes a shift in the
perceived colour value, and plays an important role in the legibility of 
a colour code. Depending on the colour environment, a shade can shift in
such a way that it may no longer be clearly assigned. Dark blue on a white
background, for example, may be difficult to differentiate from black on 
a white background. Equally, what at first appears to be a neutral grey
colour may unintentionally appear as a violet colour if it is displayed next
to green.

All known colour contrasts become greater on the luminescent medium of a screen. 
Every colour and design concept should therefore be tested at real size and in different
lighting conditions. See also Chapter 9: Developing Designs for Small Screens.
To ensure that colours can be easily
distinguished, they must be displayed
on a surface that is large enough: 
the more subtle the colour, the larger
the space needed to display it.
Colour codes such as the traffic light
analogy are clearly visible and easy to
understand even on small screens. 
It is very useful to use colour for coding purposes. Colour can represent a
code for different action routines, for example, green for approval, red for
rejection and yellow for warnings. Colour can also be used to distinguish
different types of content or applications. However, human beings do not
have an absolute colour memory, so only a limited number of clearly
distinguishable colours should be used in any one design; the colours
should then be supplemented by an alternative form of identification such
as an icon. Problems can arise if colour coding is used simultaneously for
routine actions and content categories within an application.
The colour selection and scales used must be clearly distinguishable in
order to avoid confusion, for example, by using less saturated colour
shades on larger background areas to mark the categories, and using
fewer highly-saturated colours to denote routine actions.
A unique problem on small-screen devices is that the available space in
which to display colours greatly limits the perception of the colour shade.
The smaller the area that is to be highlighted, the clearer the colours 
must be in the colour code, which means that the number of available
colours is lower.

The evolution of colour displays has vastly increased the range of
possibilities open to the designer. In many cases, the opportunity to use
colour has led to brightly coloured screens that seem to follow the logic
that excess is preferable.
Colour is often used to decorate the screen interface, but at the lower
levels of navigation the design is still dominated by long monochrome lists.
With the greater colour capability, however, it is possible to incorporate
more subtle shades and gradations, and these are increasingly used for
functional purposes. 
Skin designs for the main menu 
level of a mobile phone (Panasonic
competition, 2004): the selected icon
is highlighted by an animation, which
creates a further contrast by size. The
activation is also highlighted by a
contrast between colour and grey.
The selected icons are highlighted 
by placing them on different coloured
areas.
The more conventional the navigation
is, the greater the scope to use formal
variations without confusing the user.

Navigation System AVIC N1 (Pioneer):
here, the staggered display of the

by a reduction in the colour saturation.
This corresponds to natural 
perspective vision.
NTT DoCoMo Flash Website: this is the

yellow is very suitable and popular as a

Here the activation is coded both by
colour and by a change of size.

W21K (Kyocera): here the full spectrum

close on the colour wheel they are only
distinguishable in direct visual
comparison. Therefore icons and text
are used as redundant coding.
K700i (Sony Ericsson): blue is the
predominant colour choice for display
backgrounds. This is because all
shades of blue will stay visually in the
background, and as such provide 
the perfect canvas for warmer tones
that will automatically move towards 
the viewer’s attention.

Initially relatively little effort was made in the design of small-screen
interfaces. However, it is now generally accepted that the attractiveness
and user-friendliness of the interface represent a major factor to the
commercial success of the device. This has lead to a new professionalism
and vigour in the design of the software.

The design of small mobile devices has now reached a certain degree of
maturity. This allows projects to be realised in which the physical product
form and the interface are designed together and with equal care. The
result of these projects is almost always a distinctly simple product with
an equally minimalist design.
It is possible to choose different
display options that are way beyond
common ‘skin’ concepts. For example,
the main menu can be displayed in the
3x3 menu matrix or as a list. Both 
arrangements have various differently
designed alternative interfaces. 
The system architecture follows a
classical breakdown into nine menus,
and a flat, monochrome design of the
icons with a high level of graphical
abstraction that is reminiscent of wood
carvings. Some icons are innovative in
their motif, such as the image of a
camera shutter to denote the
‘photograph’ menu.

created by the product designer Marc
Newson for the Japanese network
operator au by KDDI.

The individual categories are supported
by a colour code, but the range of
colours in the code is only slightly
saturated. However, if the respective
colour is used over a relatively large
area, the colour shades can be easily
distinguished. As a result, it is still
possible to use highly saturated colours
in small quantities to show functions
that apply across the category
boundaries. 
In all of the menus, the depth of the
colour in the display is used to 
implement subtle colour gradations.
This almost monochrome appearance
gives the device a high quality 
appearance, which represents 
a pleasant change from the brightly 
coloured standard encountered on 
most devices. 
Alternative menu screens, screensavers
and time presentations all have a high
design quality and make optimum 
use of the resolution and colour quality
of the hardware.

A colour depth of one bit means 
that only two states are available: 
‘on’ or ‘off’.
Small screens are backlit or ‘luminescent’ media
that work on the principle of additive colour mixing.
The most widespread types are LCD displays.
These have a slightly reduced colour range and
contrast than tube monitors. This is due to the
even backlighting, which brightens the dark parts
of the image.
In the presentation of motion, the adaptation
speed of LCDs has almost reached that of tube
monitors. The slight motion blur that results
from the inertia of LCD crystals is negligible in 
the reproduction of moving pictures on small-
screen displays.
Additive colour mixing: on LCD 
displays, all of the colours are created
by combinations of three adjacent 
sub-pixels in the primary colours of 
red, green and blue.
A 12 bit colour depth means that each
of the red, green and blue sub-pixels
can take on 16 different brightness
levels. This results in 4,096 colour
shades, which each individual pixel 
can assume. 
The colour depth available on small screens is
constantly increasing. The processor power and
battery capacity will determine exactly what depth
is possible, but most colour displays will soon
offer at least 18 bit colour depth, which results in
262,144 available colours.
In practical design work, greater colour depth
means that more individual colour shades are
available. For example, colour gradations can only
be displayed satisfactorily with a colour depth of
16 bits or higher. This is an important factor both
in the design of three-dimensional elements and in
the reproduction of images and moving pictures.

For some colour depths, the number of
bits is not evenly distributed between
the three primary colours. This is 
due to the unit convention of binary
calculation. However, this slight
distortion in the colours is beyond the
perception abilities of the lay person.
Cones
Rods
Human beings can see light across a spectrum of
380 to 780 nanometres. Brightness is registered
by the rods, whereas colour is perceived by three
different types of cones. The red cones are most
sensitive to long light wavelengths (565 nm), 
the green cones to average light wavelengths
(535nm) and the blue cones (440 nm) to short
light wavelengths. The cones are not evenly
distributed on the retina; there are significantly
fewer blue cones than green and red cones; and
blue cones are only situated at the periphery of
the field of vision. 
For sharp display of light with different colours,
and thus different wavelengths, various
adjustments must be made in the lens curvature.
The characteristics of the human vision system
mean that small blue objects, such as blue text,
are difficult to view sharply and tend to appear
blurred – this explains why blue is so popular as a
background colour. Blue is felt to be the colour
that is least forceful and disturbing because the
human eye does not perceive this colour so
intensively.

Developing Designs for Small Screens
The second section of this chapter presents two
examples that demonstrate the broad range of challenges
which arise when designing a small-screen interface. The
first example is a location-based service on a hand-held
device, and the second example is a multimedia interface
designed for an automotive application. 
In this section we summarise various tips, hints,
resources and software that help the designer to plan
and prototype small-screen interface designs.

 
158|159 Developing Designs for Small Screens
The scenario
In order to develop an application that takes the needs of potential users
into account in its range of functions and its navigation structure, it is
helpful to prepare potential usage scenarios. With the aid of a speculative
and detailed description of a probable usage concept, a list of the
requirements for an application can be formulated in a fairly precise
manner. This technique helps to define priorities in a navigation structure,
and develop realistic situational interaction concepts, because they are
projected on to an individual with a wide range of characteristics, rather
than a stereotype focus group.
The paper computer
Simulating an application on paper is a way to quickly gain insights and
implement various actions from the digital world in a simple and efficient
manner. A paper computer contains all of the planned interactive elements
that are to be incorporated in the application, but here they are made of
paper and to scale. Typical usage scenarios and user types of the
application are then simulated with this ‘software’. Alternative layouts can
be experimented with for the screen and missing interactive elements or
gaps in user interaction logic can easily be identified.
The fact that this takes place outside the digital arena encourages
practitioners from a variety of disciplines to ignore the potential technical
limitations and instead focus on a solution that best suits the content.
The technique of the paper computer can be used at the start of the
project development, but it can also be employed at any time during the
development process for critical review or correction.
When an interface is developed on a screen, one complicating factor is
that the resolution of the screen is rarely the same as the resolution of
the end device. This means that interactive elements are almost always
smaller in the final version than they appear to be on the screen in 
the design and editing phase. For this reason the full-scale simulation 
of elements in a paper computer is of decisive importance in the
development process of small-screen devices.
The planning and design of branched-feedback processes is very complex. As such the
accompanying design process must be iterative: every hypothesis must first be
discussed between all the disciplines involved and then continually revised. There are
working techniques that can be employed to facilitate the exchange of ideas so that
practitioners from varied disciplines, for example, psychologists, economists, information
architects, interface designers, graphic designers, computer programmers and
engineers, can all work effectively together.

The organisational diagram
The visualisation of navigation levels and links within an application will
play a crucial role in the development, design and communication of 
the interaction concept and the information architecture. Even though it is
not always easy to visualise branched-feedback processes on a two-
dimensional surface, an organisational diagram of the application as a
whole is a central planning tool that unites all the disciplines involved. 
The specification details of a screen surface can only be designed when
all the functions of an application have been integrated and recorded in
this structural plan.
There are no established or binding coding standards for the presentation
of organisational diagrams, and they are one of the interaction methods
that designers can use to convincingly present their concept of the ‘look
and feel’ of an application. This method is particularly suitable if a great
deal of work needs to be invested in the technical implementation in order
to achieve a particularly convenient and visually convincing interface.
Simulation
Various techniques can be used to simulate an application. In addition to
the animation of a sample sequence, interactive demonstrations can be
created with varying degrees of realism. These simulations can be
programmed with a number of authoring programs, such as Macromedia
Director. The type of simulation created will depend on the questions that
need to be answered by the demonstration. For example, if the mode of
interaction is to be tested, then the physical input element and the
system’s corresponding reaction should work as realistically as possible.
In this simulation, the design of the screen will play a subordinate role.
Equally, if the intuitive use of a navigation structure is to be tested, a
computer simulation of this can be a suitable demonstration method. 
If the legibility is to be tested, the presentation must be checked on an
original display.
Evaluation
Demonstrations and prototypes not only provide insight for the designer,
but they can also be used to enable others to critically evaluate the work
in progress. Depending on the scope of the project, this can be achieved
via extensive surveys of the target group or in small-scale tests with
members of the development team. Problems of interaction and
understanding can be identified, and eventually resolved, and this helps 
to optimise the design concept.

This is an example of a paper computer
city guide, which has location-based
service functions for a hand-held
computer. All of the interface elements,
such as tabulators for the search
categories and the available tools, are
made of paper. The different layers 
of information that can be displayed on
a city map are simulated with
transparent paper.

Activis Scheduler: using the daily
schedule of a notional person,
alternative designs were developed for
the layout and presentation of time and
location information on this device. 
The simulated designs are produced as
bitmap graphics to give a realistic
impression of the presentation at the
available resolution.

In the development of software applications for small-screen devices, the
interaction steps must be planned with the caveat that the user is liable
to be impatient and/or distracted when using the product. This means that
functions must be analysed carefully to determine how often they are used
and how easily a user can reach them within the navigation structure. The
more often a function is needed, the more accessible it must be. Usage
scenarios will help to indicate cross-references in the navigation structure,
and to design meaningful context menus.

Christian Langer, Lapavalley GmbH, 
The Creation of a Multimedia Guide to Marwell Zoo,
Winchester, UK
Multimedia guides for museums, exhibitions and similar
venues were already a subject of discussion in 2002. So
when we founded our company, we realised that we needed to
set ourselves apart from potential competitors and find our
own market niche. We developed the idea of producing mobile
multimedia guides for zoos, animal parks and aquariums. 
To be as convincing in our acquisition of clients, we designed
a realistic demonstration guide.
To make a name for ourselves, we sent a brochure describing
the exact functions of our guide to almost all the zoos in the
UK. We were fortunate to receive a positive response fairly
quickly: Marwell Zoological Park in Winchester was interested.
Shown right are the final designs of the
interface. A brightness gradation
creates depth and helps to emphasise
the option buttons.
Shown left are the preliminary designs
for the interface of the guide. The 
interactive buttons are highlighted by
their plasticity. 
In an initial meeting we presented our demonstration guide 
to the zoo’s Director, Deputy Director, Marketing and
Promotion Officer and Head of Education. The reactions were
very positive, but we were not able to remove all doubts
about this new technology. Marwell was very interested, but
the zoo was not keen to be the first zoo in the UK to bear the
full risk of funding such a project. However, we wanted to
preserve our chance to implement the pilot project as far as
possible.
After brief negotiations, the two parties came to the following
agreement: Marwell was willing to fund the hardware, and we
were willing to develop the software, free of charge, as our
share of the risk. The potential revenue from hiring the device
to visitors was then to be shared. 
Marwell was very cooperative in the organisation of the
content and the interface design. Of course the guide needed
to fit in with the existing corporate design, but otherwise we
largely had a free hand and were able to experiment with the
system in the location until we, along with the voluntary
testers and the responsible parties, were finally satisfied.
The picture material that Marwell sent to us in the form of a
VHS video and some photo CDs proved to be almost
redundant. There was obviously some confusion about the
entertaining and instructive potential of our multimedia guides
– after all, a visitor does not want to see a video clip of a
sleeping panther if he is standing in front of the enclosure in
which the same panther is sleeping.
So we decided to produce the picture content ourselves. We
went inside a number of animal enclosures, hid the feed of
big cats inside jute sacks, stroked rhinos, tapirs, bird-eating
spiders and more, and we recorded everything on video or by
taking photographs. We also interviewed some keepers, and
we accompanied the vet on his rounds. After a week we 
had collected enough material to fill the guide with exciting
and informative content.
Initially we had problems with the hardware. The PDAs had to
be enclosed in a waterproof covering so that they could
survive both wet weather and accidental submersion in 
the penguin pool! However, the plastic waterproof bags with
transparent windows, which were specially made for the
device, had a detrimental effect on the contrast of the displays,
and this effect was exacerbated in bright sunlight. After two
weeks of conducting usability tests carried out with volunteers
from all age groups, it was clear that the contrast of all
graphics had to be enhanced in order to ensure their legibility.
In August 2003 we launched our first multimedia guide,
almost ten months after our first contact with Marwell. Now
the devices have been in operation for more than two years,
and all parties are more than satisfied with the results. 
The number of units hired out per quarter shows very clearly
that our work was worthwhile and visitors to Marwell have
enthusiastically received the guide.

Gerhard Mauter, Head of Development MMI at Audi AG, 
The Development of a Multimedia Interface for the A8
How were the concepts simulated or communicated in the
initial phase of the project?
Simulation was initially carried out with a PC, and in the
second stage a sitting duck was used that already integrated
the real display and a prototype of the control unit. Then a
predecessor model to the A8 was equipped with a display and
control unit in the constellation that was planned for mass
production. The control unit and display were operated by
means of a PC, which was installed in the boot of the car and
this enabled specific functions to be simulated. The radio 
only had a fixed list of stations, the sound was generated with
.wav files and the CDs, TV and navigation system were
simulated. The telephone worked properly, including the
telephone lists and voice control.
During the development we used every opportunity to
demonstrate the progress of the work to all of the directors
and to important decision-makers so that they would have the
opportunity to contribute their ideas at an early stage.
Small screens are not only incorporated in individual mobile devices, but
they also form the user interface for an increasing number of products
that are used in everyday life. Integration of a small-screen device in the
car is a unique challenge because a driver will not primarily concentrate on
using the display – the focus will instead be fixed on the road ahead.
To link the rotation of the control unit
as closely as possible with the display
on the screen, vertical lists and
selection options are arranged on
segments of a circle, or around its
circumference.

The interaction is optionally either via
an operating panel in the central console
or with keys and scroll wheels that are
integrated into the steering wheel.
The main functions can be selected
directly with keys, and are distinguished
on the display by a colour code. The
central control unit is a rotating push
button, which can be used to manage
all of the settings.

 
166|167 Developing Designs for Small Screens
Global products need localised
interfaces. The concept must take into
account the space required by different
languages, and this must be tested in
sample layouts.
What were the greatest challenges?
Reaching a consensus in the development team. The inter-
disciplinary make-up of the MMI team included specialists
from areas such as design, technology and ergonomics.
Creating a mental model in a short time that would enable the
later users to quickly learn how to operate the system.
Finding a middle solution in the reduction of keys to keep 
the learning threshold as low as possible for the customer –
because customers are always intimidated by such a new system.
For many development engineers it was removing a whole
range of functions from direct access and integrating them
into the menu control.
The internal interlinking between the operating concept, the
design, the hardware and software development – and
organising the external interaction of development suppliers.
For example, this included the definition of the interfaces;
here we used completely new methods of software
specification by including illustrated organisational diagrams:
StateCharts.
For me personally, the development of the central rotating
control unit was one of the greatest challenges. It took three
years before this control unit achieved its physical quality and
its tactile attractiveness.
In what ways was the concept evaluated?
When our decision-makers were involved in the course of the
internal communication process, we also used them to check
the usability of the system because they perfectly match the
profile of our A8 customers. There were also several expert
reports from recognised authorities in the area of control
concepts, and we conducted smaller internal usability tests. 
A large-scale usability test with almost 100 external potential
customers (the oldest of whom was 72 years old), also
provided a number of suggestions, and most of them were
implemented in the final product.
Driving trials were held at a very early stage of the
development to help select the input elements. Criteria such
as the speed of entries and error frequency were logged.
Different input elements such as arrow keys, a touchscreen
and a revolving knob were compared.
By contrast with applications that are developed for a personal computer,
the designer of any interactive system which is to be implemented in an
object of everyday use cannot assume their potential users will be familiar
with how computers or computer applications work.

As such typical computer interactions and functional concepts cannot be
taken for granted in the development of interaction concepts. The designer
must ensure that these concepts provide independent and robust mental
models, which are easy to learn and these must be carefully tested with
potential user groups.
A common problem occurs with displays
that do not consist of square pixels.
Here, the design must first be
compressed by the appropriate factor
so that it is shown in the right
proportions on the target display. In 
the instance of circular forms and text
display, it is very noticeable if the
proportions are not right.

 
168|169 Developing Designs for Small Screens
In the creation of small-screen applications, the
designer must show great flexibility and be
constantly open to new concepts and techniques.
This is partly because elements such as screen
size, resolution and colour depth are constantly
changing and partly because the forms of
interaction and operating systems for small-screen
devices are not as standardised as they are for
personal computers.
For these reasons, careful research into the
technical specifications is always essential in the
concept development and the design of
applications.
Authoring Programs: such as Macromedia Director
enable interactive systems to be simulated and
they can also be used to produce software
prototypes for small screens. These programs are
easy for designers to use, and they offer three
important functions. Firstly, the simulation provides
the designer with insight; secondly, they allow the
designer to create impressive presentations, and
finally, authoring programs can create prototypes
that can be used to test the application on
potential users.
Development Environments: exist for systems such
as the Palm OS; they simulate both the end device
and the interface elements that are provided by
the operating system. Development environments
are usually complicated to handle, and therefore
are more suitable for programmers.
Development Software: such as Flash Lite allows
the creation of applications for small devices. This
software can be used directly to create content 
for small screens. The form of interaction and the
design options are predefined and based on
standard device types.
With all digital-simulation tools, it is important to
remember that the screen resolution of the
computer is usually lower than the resolution of the
end device. This means that screen elements and
text on the end device will appear significantly
smaller than on the computer in the design phase.

The tools and techniques used to 
create paper prototypes are very 
simple: scissors, paper and a pencil!
The effectiveness of this technique
should not be underestimated. Usage 
processes can be created simply and
easily, then tested and modified or
rejected. Experience shows that this
technique is especially suitable for
multi-disciplinary teams.

The design of interactive applications or presentations on small-
screen devices presents a constantly evolving challenge for the
designer. Not all design concepts that are valid on larger screens
can be successfully implemented on smaller screens. 
The category of small-screen devices covers a multitude of 
hardware; all with very dissimilar technical specifications, 
modes of user interaction, and various levels of performance 
and functionality. 
This invaluable book equips the student or practitioner with the
appropriate tools and principles that will enable the development
of functional concepts, and the creation of effective and intuitive
designs for a variety of small-screen devices.
To simplify and visualise a number of complex issues, each of the 
nine chapters in this book is split into three distinct sections.
These three sections are dedicated to the theorectical, practical
and supplementary principles and techniques of the issue in
question and, when combined, form a solid basis from which
informed design decisions can be made.
