Preface to the Third Edition
Planar transmission line technology has progressed considerably since the second 
edition of this book was published in 1996. The impetus for this advancement has 
been provided principally by the UWB communications, imaging at THz frequen-
cies, RFID, and so forth. It is imperative in such a scenario to revise this text to 
meet current needs. In this context, two new chapters—one on substrate integrated 
waveguide (SIW), and another on defected ground structures (DGSs)—have been 
added. The other chapters have been revised to include the recent developments in 
those areas. Due to the emphasis on compactness of device, use of UWB technology, 
and improved performance requirements, the use of computer-aided analysis and 
design is necessary. However, the efficient use of computer-aided techniques depends 
on the insight gained from the analytical techniques. This book elaborates on both 
types of techniques that have been successfully presented in its last two editions. 
The applications of computational techniques to planar lines are the highlight of 
the book. The details include the development of governing equations, basis func-
tions, Green’s function, and typical results. Realizing the increasing importance of 
simulation software in the design of complex devices, the chapters on SIW and DGS 
emphasize the connection between the data obtained from simulation software and 
the design.
Like its previous editions, this book is primarily intended for design engineers 
and research and development specialists who need to employ planar transmission 
lines in realizing distributed circuits and antenna systems. This book may also be 
helpful for advanced undergraduate and graduate courses in electronics and tele-
communication engineering.
The extensive revisions included in this edition are based on the authors’ own 
research and the extensive research material reported by others in journals and 
conferences throughout the world since 1996. It is sad to say that Professor K. C. 
Gupta is no longer leading the revision of the book. To augment the expertise, we 
have invited Professor M. Bozzi from the Department of Electronics, University of 
Pavia, Italy. Chapters on SIW and DGS are contributed by him.
Revisions to Chapter 1 include a section on fabrication. Sections on the lumped 
element model of the microstrip interconnect and buried microstrip line have been 
included in Chapter 2.
Chapters 3 and 4 elaborate on the characterization of microstrip discontinuities. 
RF short and via hole discontinuity characterization has been added in Chapter 3. 
Chapter 4 includes curved microstrip bend analysis based on planar waveguide model.
Chapter 5 discusses slotlines and has been largely revised with the addition 
of slotline variants, such as the sandwich slotline. The ultrawideband directional 
coupler realized using slotline-coupled microstrip lines is another useful addition 
in this chapter.

xii
Preface to the Third Edition
Chapter 6 is about defect ground structures and is a new addition to this book. A 
large number of research articles have been published since DGS was first introduced 
in 2001. This chapter includes topics such as the bandstop filter characteristics of 
DGS, equivalent circuit modeling, and applications of DGS to circuits and antennas. 
A typical application of DGS is the out-of-band performance improvement of devices.
Keeping in mind the importance of coplanar lines in compact planar circuits, 
antennas, and VLSI technology as an interconnect, Chapter 7 on coplanar lines has 
been revised extensively. The major changes in this chapter include new variants of 
CPW and CPS, the effect of thick metallization on line characteristics, broadband 
determination of conductor loss for application to digital signals, UWB transitions, 
and CAD models for discontinuities in CPW and CPS. The number of references 
has increased from 122 to 145.
Chapter 8 discusses coupled microstrip lines and has been revised by introduc-
ing a new section on the analysis of slot-coupled microstrip lines. In addition, the 
following changes have been introduced: new directivity improvement techniques 
for coupled microstrip line directional couplers, and ever-elusive accurate conformal 
mapping analysis of coupled microstrip lines.
The substrate integrated waveguide is a printed version of a rectangular wave-
guide, thus making these printed waveguide circuits light, compact, and cheaper. 
SIW technology was first proposed in 1994 although it was noticed in 2001. Sub-
strate integrated waveguide forms the last chapter (Chapter 9) of the book. The 
topics discussed in this chapter include analysis and design of SIW, equivalent circuit 
modeling of SIW interconnect, and discontinuities. A number of variants of SIW 
are discussed, including substrate integrated folded waveguide. Transitions of SIW 
to microstrip and CPW are included. Typical applications of SIW include passive 
components, active circuits, antennas, and feed networks for array antennas. SIW 
technology promises possible integration of waveguide and planar transmission line-
based components utilizing the positive features of each technology. This integrated 
system is called the system-on-substrate (SoS) concept and its realizations are the 
highlight of this chapter.
We believe that this thoroughly revised third edition contains the most up-to-date 
body of knowledge on this topic. We hope that the concepts included in Microstrip 
Lines and Slotlines will be helpful to the design and research engineers in continued 
development and applications of planar transmission line techniques.

Introduction
1.1.1  Planar Transmission Structures
One of the principal requirements for a transmission structure to be suitable as a 
circuit element in microwave integrated circuits (MICs) is that the structure should 
be “planar” in configuration. A planar configuration implies that the character-
istics of the element can be determined by the dimensions in a single plane. For 
example, the width of a microstrip line on a dielectric substrate can be adjusted to 
control its impedance. When the impedance can be controlled by dimensions in a 
single plane, the circuit fabrication can be conveniently carried out by techniques 
of photolithography and photoetching of thin films. Use of these techniques at 
microwave and millimeter wave frequencies has led to the development of hybrid 
and monolithic MICs. Microwave integrated circuits have been widely discussed in 
the literature [1-6].
	 There are several transmission structures that satisfy the requirement of being 
­planar. The most common of these are: (i) microstrip, (ii) coplanar waveguide,  
Figure 1.1  Planar transmission lines used in microwave integrated circuits.

2
Microstrip Lines I: Quasi-Static Analyses, Dispersion Models, and Measurements
(iii) slotline, and (iv) coplanar strips. Cross-sectional views of these lines are shown 
in Figure 1.1. A microstrip line is the most popular of these transmission structures, 
mainly due to the fact that the mode of propagation in a microstrip is almost trans-
verse electro magnetic (TEM). This allows an easy approximate analysis and yields 
wide band circuits. Also simple transitions to coaxial circuits are feasible. Chapters 
1 and 2 present various aspects of microstrip analysis and design. Slotline, coplanar 
strips, and coplanar waveguide are discussed in later chapters. A comparison of the 
characteristics of these lines is given in Section 7.6.
	 There are several variations of the microstrip configuration that have also 
been suggested for use in MICs. These include the inverted microstrip, suspended 
microstrip, microstrip with overlay, strip dielectric waveguide, and inverted strip 
dielectric waveguide. Cross-sectional views of these structures are given in Figure 1.2, 
and their analysis is available in references [7-10].

	 Another very commonly used transmission line that resembles a microstrip line 
is the stripline [11, 12], shown in Figure 1.3. This is also called a triplate line. Most 
of the basic circuit design ideas implemented in a stripline are also applicable to 
microstrip line circuits.
1.1.2  Microstrip Field Configuration
A microstrip is a two-conductor transmission line that can be considered to have 
evolved conceptually from a two-wire line as shown in Figure 1.4. Transformation 
from (a) to (b) is essentially a change in the shape of the conductors, whereas that 
from (b) to (c) involves placing a conducting sheet at the plane of symmetry. The 
final configuration (d) is obtained by inserting a thin dielectric slab between the 
two conductors. As a consequence of the last step, the dielectric medium of the 
transmission line becomes inhomogeneous.
Microstrip lines differ considerably from other transmission lines. For exam-
ple, comparing a microstrip line with a stripline, one observes that the microstrip 
structure is open at the top. This open configuration makes a microstrip very con-
venient for use in MICs where discrete lumped devices (active or passive) must be 
mounted in the circuit. Also, small adjustments or tuning can possibly be incorpo-
rated after the circuit has been fabricated. However, along with these advantages, 
the open structure of a microstrip causes some complications in microstrip analysis 
and design. This is due to the fact that the presence of the dielectric-air interface 
modifies the mode of propagation in a microstrip to a non-TEM hybrid mode (as 
compared to a pure TEM-mode in a stripline).
Simple arguments based on the known quasi-static field distribution of the 
microstrip and Maxwell’s equations can be presented to show that a microstrip 
stucture cannot support a pure TEM wave. Continuity of the tangential component 
of the electric field along a dielectric-air interface (see Figure 1.5) yields
	
Ex d = Ex a 	
(1.1)
where subscripts d and a refer to the dielectric and the air side of the interface, 
respectively. Using Maxwell’s equations, one may thus write
	
(∇¥ H)x d =εr(∇¥ H)x a 	
(1.2)
Expanding (1.2) and using the continuity of the normal component of the magnetic 
flux, we obtain (for the case when mr = 1)
	
εr ∂Hz ⁄ ∂y a - ∂Hz ⁄ ∂y d = εr -1
(
)∂Hy ⁄ ∂z 	
(1.3)
As er is not equal to unity and Hy ≠ 0, (1.3) implies that the expression on the left- 
hand side should be a nonzero quantity, which can only be true if Hz is nonzero. 
Thus we note that for Maxwell’s equations to hold good for the configuration of 
Figure 1.5, the longitudinal component of H must exist.
Similar arguments can be advanced to show that Ez, the longitudinal compo-
nent of the electric field, is also a nonzero quantity. It may be pointed out that it is 
only the fringing components Ex and Hx at the dielectric-air interface that lead to 

4
Microstrip Lines I: Quasi-Static Analyses, Dispersion Models, and Measurements
the non-TEM nature of the microstrip mode. Since these fringing field components 
are much smaller than the main field (within the substrate below the strip), the 
departure from the TEM behavior should be small. This conjecture is supported by 
the results based on a rigorous fullwave analysis of the microstrip, which will be 
discussed later in the book.
1.1.3  Methods of Microstrip Analysis
As with any other transmission line structure, the analysis methods for a microstrip 
line are aimed at determining the characteristic impedance and propagation con-
stant (phase velocity and attenuation constant). The various methods of microstrip 
analysis may be divided into two main groups as shown in Figure 1.6. In the first 
group, which comprises quasi-static methods, the nature of the mode of propaga-
tion is considered to be pure TEM and the microstrip characteristics are calculated 
from the electrostatic capacitance of the structure. It is found that this analysis

is adequate for designing circuits at lower frequencies (below X-band) where the 
strip width and the substrate thickness are much smaller than the wavelength in 
the dielectric material. The methods in the second group take into account the 
hybrid nature of the mode of propagation. The techniques followed for fullwave 
analysis are more rigorous and analytically complex. An important outcome of the 
fullwave analysis is information about the dispersive nature of the microstrip line. 
This includes variation of characteristic impedance, Z0, and phase velocity (or ef-
fective dielectric constant, ere) with frequency. As a fullwave analysis becomes fairly 
complicated, several quasi-empirical methods known as “dispersion models” have 
been developed for finding variations of Z0 and ere with frequency.
The methods of quasi-static analysis are discussed in this chapter. Microstrip 
dispersion models, transitions, and measurement techniques are also included. 
Techniques of fullwave analysis are described in the next chapter.
1.2	
Quasi-Static Analyses of a Microstrip
In quasi-static analyses, the mode of wave propagation in a microstrip is assumed 
to be pure TEM. Transmission characteristics are then calculated from the values 
of two capacitances, one (Ca) for a unit length of the microstrip configuration with 
the dielectric substrate replaced by air, and the other (C) for a unit length of the 
microstrip with the dielectric substrate present. Values of characteristic impedance 
Z0m and the phase constant b can be written in terms of these capacitances as
	
Z0m = Z0m
a (Ca ⁄C)1/2 	
(1.4)
and
	
β = β0 (C ⁄ Ca)1/2

where Za
0m = l/(cCa) and b0 = w/c, where c is the velocity of electromagnetic waves 
in free space. There are various methods available for calculating the electrostatic 
capacitances Ca and C. Five of these are listed in Figure 1.6 and will be discussed 
in the following subsections.
1.2.1  Modified Conformal Transformation Method
An exact conformal transformation for the impedance of a zero-thickness, homo-
geneous dielectric microstrip has been given by Schneider [9]. The transformation 
from the microstrip (z-plane) to a parallel plate capacitor (z′-plane) is expressed in 
terms of the logarithmic derivative of the theta function q4 and a parameter κ = 
K′/K as
	
z = - 2hK
π
∂
∂′z n[θ4( ′z ,κ )]	
(1.6)
where K = K( m) and K′ = K′ (m) are complete elliptic integrals of the first kind with 
modulus m. The characteristic impedance Z0m of the microstrip of width W and 
height h (and t = 0) is obtained by solving the equations

where m0 and e0 are the free-space permeability and permittivity constants, respec-
tively, and Za
0m is the characteristic impedance of the microstrip with the dielectric 
substrate replaced by air. The function E = E(m) is the complete elliptic integral of 
the second kind and dn is the Jacobian elliptic function. The logarithmic derivative 
of the theta function is given by the (rapidly converging) series expansion

Equations (1.7) to (1.9) can be used for the design of microstrip lines as follows. 
For a given characteristic impedance Za
0m, K′/K is calculated from (1.9). The modu-
lus m for the elliptic functions is found by looking up tables for K′/K. Also E and K 
are determined using this value of m. The solution of (1.8) now gives the value of 
z. For known z and κ (= K′/K), W/h for the microstrip is calculated from (1.7) and 
(1.10). A practical solution to this set of equations is obtained with the help of a 
computer or with numerical tables. The conformal transformation given by Schnei-
der yields Za
0m, the characteristic impedance for a homogeneously filled micro­strip 
line. It is perhaps because of this limitation that the above method is not used very 
frequently.
The most widely used technique for microstrip analysis was introduced by 
Wheeler [13, 14] in 1964-65. The method uses a conformal transformation for the

evaluation of Ca and introduces a concept of effective dielectric constant for the 
evaluation of C. The conformal transformation selected is such that the resulting 
expressions are explicit and can be written in terms of simple functions. The trans-
formation used for the wide strip (W/h > 2) is
	
z = jπ + d tanh( ′z ⁄ 2) - ′z 	
(1.11)
The variable z refers to the microstrip plane (see Figure 1.7) and z′ is the plane 
in which the microstrip configuration transforms into a parallel plate capacitor 
configuration. The parameter d is approximately equal to g′ of Figure 1.7(b). The 
dielectric-air boundary of the microstrip substrate is transformed into an elliptical- 
looking curve bd′ as shown in Figure 1.7(b). To evaluate the capacitance C, it is 
necessary to introduce approximations in order to modify the dielectric-air bound-
ary. The curved dielectric-air boundary of Figure 1.7(b) is approximated by a rec-
tangular boundary as shown in Figure 1.7(c). The area (ps′) over the curve is writ-
ten in terms of a “parallel area” ps″ and a “series area” p(s′ - s″). These series and 
parallel areas can be expressed in terms of an equivalent parallel area s given by 
(Figure 1.7(d))
	
s = ′′
s + ( ′s - ′′
s ) ⁄εr 	
(1.12)
The effective filling fraction can then be written as
	
q = ( ʹ′g - ʹ′a + s) § ʹ′g 	
(1.13)
The effective dielectric constant is related to the effective filling fraction as
	
εre = (1 - q) + qεr 	
(1.14)
Different expressions for ere are derived for a wide microstrip (W/h > 2) and for a 
narrow microstrip (W/h < 2) because of the different approximations used in the 
two cases. For wide strips [15]

Formulas for the impedance of microstrip lines can be derived from these results. 
It is an advantage of the transformation selected by Wheeler that the impedance 
formulas can be written explicitly both for analysis (Z0m in terms of W/h and er) 
and for synthesvis (W/h in terms of Z0m and er). These relations are listed below.

However, Wheeler’s analysis does not lead to closed form expressions for the 
effective dielectric constant when W/h ≥ 2. Such expressions have been derived 
empirically by curve fitting the numerical data and will be discussed in Section 2.4.
Values of the characteristic impedance and effective dielectric constant of a mi-
crostrip, based on the method discussed above, may be obtained from Figure 1.8. 
In this figure, the va­lue of εre is plotted as a function of W/h for various values of 
the substrate dielectric constant er. The variation of the characteristic impedance 
for air microstrip (Za
0m for er = 1) is also shown by a dotted curve. The impedance 
for any value of er can be obtained by dividing Za
0m by the corresponding value of 
εre. It may be seen from Figure 1.8 that the impedance value decreases when the 
strip width-to-height ratio (W/h) of the substrate is increased because an increase 
in W (or decrease in h) increases the line capacitance.

Microstrip Lines I: Quasi-Static Analyses, Dispersion Models, and Measurements
Since the wavelength in microstrip lm is related to ere by the expression
	
λm =
λ0
εre
	
(1.22)
we notice from Figure 1.8 that lm is a function of W/h and hence of Z0m. This 
implies that, for example, the length for a quarter wave section of 25-Ω imped-
ance would be different from that of a section of 100-Ω impedance (at the same 
frequency!). This factor must be kept in mind while designing microstrip circuits.
It may be pointed out that in the modified conformal transformation method 
discussed above, the thickness of the microstrip conductor is ignored and the analy-
sis is restricted to an open microstrip without any enclosure.
The conformal mapping approach for calculating the capacitance has also been 
extended to the analysis of multilayer microstrip lines [16]. Two types of three-
layered structures have been considered: a substrate consisting of two layers of dif-

ferent dielectric constants and a single-layered substrate microstrip structure with 
a dielectric cover layer. Expressions for filling factors and for effective permittivity 
for these two cases are available in [16].
1.2.2  Finite Difference Method
Another method for quasi-static analysis of microstrip lines is based on the numeri-
cal solution of Laplace’s equation in the finite difference form [17]. This method 
is more suitable for enclosed microstrip lines, and the finite thickness of the mi-
crostrip conductor can easily be incorporated into the analysis. Laplace’s equation 
may be written in finite difference form by considering the configuration shown in 
Figure 1.9. Potentials at the points A, B, C, D in the immediate vicinity of a point 
P may be written as
	
φA = φp - Δ∂φ
∂x + Δ2
2!
Δ2 ∂2φ
∂x2
−Δ3

∂3φ

φD = φP + Δ∂φ
∂y + Δ2
2!
∂2φ
∂y2 + Δ3
3!
∂3φ
∂y3 + ⋅⋅⋅	
(1.26)
When we ignore the fourth- and higher order terms and use (∂2f/∂x2 + ∂2f/∂y2) = 0, 
the above relations yield
	
φA + φB + φC + φD 4φP 	
(1.27a)
For nodes on the interface, (1.27a) should be modified as
	
ε + ε0

φA + ε + ε0

φB + φC + φD @ 4ε + ε0
2
φP 	
(1.27b)
where e is the permittivity of the substrate and e0 is the permittivity of air above 
the substrate.
The most common method of solving the finite difference equation (1.27) is the 
“relaxation method.” In this method one starts with assumed values of f at all the 
grid points. These values are modified successively as follows:
	
New φP = oldφP - α RP 	
(1.28)
where the “residuals” Rp are given by
	
RP = φP - (φA + φB + φC + φD) ⁄ 4 	
(1.29)
This successive “relaxation” is carried out until the differences between the old 
and new values become less than the allowed error. The speed of convergence of 

12
Microstrip Lines I: Quasi-Static Analyses, Dispersion Models, and Measurements
the “relaxation” process is determined by the constant a. Relation (1.29) needs 
to be modified for points near the dielectric-air boundary and corners. A detailed 
discussion of the method is given by Green [18]. The solution of Laplace’s equation 
by the method discussed above yields information about the potential distribution 
in the microstrip cross-section, from which the field distributions and the charge on 
the strip can be calculated. We have
	
Q =
ε∫
En ⋅ds  	
(1.30)
where the integral is taken over a surface that encloses the strip conductor and e 
represents the permittivity of the respective region about the strip. The capacitance 
is obtained as the ratio of charge to voltage. Again two capacitances C and Ca are 
evaluated and the microstrip parameters Z0m and b calculated using (1.4) and (1.5), 
respectively.
1.2.3  Integral Equation Method
The quasi-static analysis of a microstrip may also be formulated in the form of an 
integral equation rather than a differential equation. We consider the Poisson equa-
tion in terms of a line charge distribution and define a Green’s function G as
	
∇t
2G(x, y; x0, y0) = - 1
ε0εr
δ(y −y0)δ(x - x0) 	
(1.31)
where subscript t refers to transverse coordinates (x and y) and coordinates x0, y0 
refer to the source location and x, y to the field point. Thus G(x, y; x0, y0) is the 
potential at (x, y) produced by a line charge of unit magnitude located at (x0, y0). 
Figure 1.9  Enclosed microstrip configuration for analysis by the finite difference method.

Microstrip Lines and Slotlines
13
The function G satisfies the boundary and the interface conditions of the microstrip 
configuration but not the source condition. Using Green’s function, an integral 
equation of the following form can be formulated and solved to determine the 
charge distribution:
	
φ(x,y) =
G(x, y; x0, y0)ρ(x0,y0)dx0
∫
	
(1.32)
where f and r are the potential and the charge distributions, respectively, and the 
integration is carried out over the surface of the microstrip conductor at y0 = h. The 
analysis can be divided into two parts: first, the formulation of a suitable Green’s 
function G, and second, the solution of the integral equation (1.32) by writing it in 
the form of a matrix equation and carrying out the matrix inversion numerically. 
The matrix equation corresponding to (1.32) may be written as
	
v
[ ] = p
[ ] . q
[ ]	
(1.33)
where [v] and [q] are column matrices representing the potential f and the charge 
q, respectively, and the matrix [p] can be recognized as the matrix of Maxwell’s 
potential coefficients. Since the conductors may be presumed to be at known po-
tentials, the matrix [v] is known and (1.33) may be solved for [q] by inversion of 
the matrix [p]. Total charge Q and capacitance C for the microstrip can then be 
calculated as 
	
C = Q ⁄ v =
(p−1)jk
k∑
j∑
	
(1.34)
where (p–1)jk is the jkth term of the inverse of the [p] matrix. Green’s function G 
for the microstrip configuration is obtained from the theory of images for a charge 
placed in front of a dielectric-air interface and has been described by Silvester [19]. 
The method of images is illustrated in Figure 1.10. In this figure, the partial image 
coefficient K is given by
	
K = (1 - εr) ⁄ (1 + εr)

Microstrip Lines I: Quasi-Static Analyses, Dispersion Models, and Measurements
Since K is negative, (1.36) becomes an alternating series that is convergent and 
lends itself to the simple estimation of the truncation error. It has been found that 
for a value of er between 2 and 20, the number of terms of (1.36) sufficient to en-
sure convergence to seven significant figures lies between 15 to 150. Green’s func-
tion for thick conductor microstrip lines has also been reported [19].
1.2.4  Variational Method in the Fourier Transform Domain
The search for microstrip analysis techniques that are computationally more ef-
ficient has led to the variational method in the Fourier transform domain (FTD). 
There are two significant features of this method [20]. First, a variational method 
for calculating the capacitance C from the charge density r is used. This avoids the 
need for an accurate knowledge of the charge density distribution. Second, a major 
portion of analysis is carried out in FTD with the result that the integral equation 
for the potential gets replaced by an algebraic product of an approximate r˜ and a 
factor g˜ derived in FTD (see (1.41)).
The variational expression for the capacitance (upper bound) may be written 
as [20]

The potential function in the transform domain, f˜(a) is evaluated as follows. Ex-

the (a, y)-plane, namely;

In the region 0 ≤ y ≤ h, the general solution satisfying (1.44) is a linear combination

alone. Using the boundary conditions given in (1.44), the solution for f˜(a, y) at  
y = h is given by

(1.45)
f˜(a, h) given by (1.45) is used in (1.39) to evaluate the capacitance C.
We still must find r(a) before C can be computed. However, since (1.37) is 
variational, one may use an approximate trial function for r(x) and incur only a 
second-order error in the value of capacitance. A trial function that maximizes the 
value of C gives the closest value to the exact result for the capacitance. Variation 
of the charge proportional to |x| yields the following expression for r˜(a) [20]:

Results obtained by this method agree well with those of the modified conformal 
transformation method discussed earlier. This method can also be used to take into 
account the effect of finite strip thickness and enclosure. It can easily be extended 
for a microstrip on composite substrates or where a dielectric overlay exists over 
the microstrip [21]. In these situations one simply has to find an appropriate ex-
pression for g˜(a) and use the above procedure. For a microstrip with a composite 
substrate (the lower layer with dielectric constant er1 and height h and the upper 
layer with dielectric constant er2 and height s) and shielded by a top metallic wall at 
a distance d from the strip, the value of g˜(a) is given as

1.2.5  Segmentation and Boundary Element Method (SBEM)
Another microstrip developed analysis method [22] is based on a combination of 
the segmentation method [23, 24] and the boundary element method [24, 25]. This

method is well suited for multiconductor microstrip-like transmission structures 
with multilayered dielectric substrates. The cross-section of the microstrip configu-
ration is first separated into several homogeneous regions and analyzed separately 
by the boundary element method. The results are then combined to yield the final 
result by using the segmentation method. This strategy makes it possible to take 
into account local modifications of the transmission line configuration by conduct-
ing new analyses only at those regions nearby the modification.
The boundary element method is widely used in structural analysis and acous-
tics [25, 26]. Some applications in electromagnetics have also been reported [27, 
28]. For the quasi-TEM mode microstrip line analysis, we solve the Laplace equa-
tion in the cross-sectional plane of the transmission structure. Instead of dealing 
with the differential equation directly, we use the integral equation form of the 
Poisson equation (which is derived using Green’s third identity [29, 30]):

where Φ(r) is the potential at any point on the contour S, G(r, r′) is the Green’s 
function that satisfies Poisson’s equation for a point charge at r′ in the homogene-
ous domain D bounded by the contour S, n(r′) is the normal vector at r′ on the 
contour S pointing toward the domain, and r(r′) is the charge density function (see  
Figure 1.11).
The method described in [22] is based on the solution for the “basic capaci-
tance matrix” (the relation between the boundary voltages and boundary electric 
flux) for each homogeneous region first (see Figure 1.12). Then the segmentation 
method [31] is used to connect all of these basic capacitance matrices into one 
matrix, which is the relation between potential and charges on all the conductor 
surfaces. By using the segmentation method, those fields (Φ and ∂Φ/ ∂n) on the di-
electric interfaces are treated as dummy variables and need not be really evaluated. 
This saves time in comparison to the traditional boundary element method. As a 
last step, the condition of equal potential on each conductor surface is applied to 
this matrix, and this yields the final capacitance matrix C or, in the case of a single 
microstrip line, capacitance per unit length.
For each of these homogeneous regions, the equation

is solved by using the weighted residual method [25]. Here the pulse function is 
used as the basis function and the delta function is used as the testing function. The

where e is the permittivity for that homogeneous region. This results in a system of

The integrals in (1.55) and (1.57) are carried out numerically by the Gaussian
quadrature formula [24]. It also should be noted that the U matrix is not
symmetrical because of (1.55). The basic capacitance matrix CB for this region is 
then defined as
	
CB = [U]–1 H	
(1.58)
where CB has units of Farads/meter. However, because the definition of Q in (1.53),
CB is not a real capacitance matrix unless all this region’s boundary is conductor.
It also should be noted that each element of CB is proportional to e, the permit­
tivity for that homogeneous region. If the geometry of this region is kept un-
changed and the permittivity is changed to a new value, the basic capacitance ma-
trix does not need to be calculated using (1.58) again; instead, each element of
the original CB needs only to be scaled to the new permittivity value. (This makes
the calculation of inductance matrix L for this transmission-line system much easi-
er when the capacitance matrix C has been calculated using SBEM.) Once the basic 
capacitance matrices have been calculated for all the homogeneous regions, they 
are connected to each other using the boundary condition on dielectric interfaces. 
This is done by the segmentation method.
Suppose we have two basic capacitance matrices CB1 and CB2 (Figure 1.13), for 
homogeneous region 1 and region 2, respectively, given by

(1.63)
which gives the relation between the voltage and electric flux at unconnected ports 
only.
The segmentation method is applied to connect all the basic capacitance matri-
ces and to eliminate all the ports on the dielectric interfaces. This results in a matrix 
that relates the potential and charges on all conductor surfaces. The last condition 
that needs to be applied is that all the ports on the same conductor should have the 
same potential. This condition can easily be applied by simply summing the related 
elements in the matrix. All the elements that relate the charges on conductor i due 
to the voltage on conductor j should be added to become the element Cij of the final 
capacitance matrix C. It should be noted that, in the whole process of this capaci-
tance matrix calculation, we try to avoid calculating the fields we do not need so 
that the process can be as efficient as possible. The boundary element method helps 
us to concentrate only on the boundary fields, and the segmentation method helps 
us to eliminate the unknown fields at the dielectric interfaces. In cases where the 
fields on the dielectric interfaces or the fields in the domain are needed, (1.62) can 
be used to recover all the details.
In addition to the five methods for quasi-static analysis of microstrip lines dis-
cussed in this chapter, several other numerical electromagnetic analysis techniques 
are applicable to microstrip line. An overview of these methods is available in [32]. 
The finite element method [33] has been used for quasi-static analysis of microstrip 
lines, and a computer program based on this method is available in [33].

Microstrip Dispersion Models
The quasi-static methods of microstrip analysis do not take into account the 
non-TEM nature of the microstrip mode. The non-TEM behavior causes the effec-
tive dielectric constant (ere) and impedance Z0m of the microstrip to be functions 
of frequency. Of these two, the variation of the effective dielectric constant is more 
significant. An exact evaluation of these variations involves a fullwave analysis of 
the microstrip configuration, which will be discussed in Chapter 2. However, there 
are several semi-empirical techniques [34–50] available that lead to a closed-form 
solution for the dependence of ere and Z0m on frequency. These dispersion models 
may be listed as follows:
• Model based on coupling between TEM and TM0 surface wave modes [34];
• An empirical relation for frequency-dependent phase velocity [35];
• Model based on LSE mode using a dielectric loaded ridged waveguide and its 
modifications [36, 39, 43];
• Model based on coupling between a TEM mode and a TE mode transmission 
line [37];
• Model based on coupling between the LSE mode and surface-wave mode [47];
• Empirical formulae based on fullwave numerical data [41, 44, 49];
• Planar waveguide model [38].
Some of these dispersion models are discussed briefly in this section.
1.3.1  Coupled TEM Mode and TM Mode Model
In this model [34] the deviation from the TEM behavior or the dispersion is con-
sidered to be caused by the coupling between the fundamental TEM mode and 
the lowest order surface wave TM0 mode. Using the theory of coupled modes, the 
frequency-dependent effective dielectric constant may be written as
	 εre(f) =
0.5( εre (0) +
εeTM) + ε12
2+ 0.25( εre (0) −
εeTM)2
{

	 (1.64)
where ere(0) is the quasi-static value of the effective dielectric constant and eeTM is 
the effective dielectric constant for the TM0 mode. An expression for the coupling 
parameter e12, obtained by a series of qualitative arguments, may be written as
	
ε12
2 = k( εr - 1)2(W⁄h)n3(f⁄fe)n2 	
(1.65)

where fe is the frequency at which the phase velocity of the TEM mode equals the 
phase velocity of the TM0 mode and k, n2, n3 are three constants found empirically 
for the best fit between the behavior of the coupled line model and the experimen-
tal results. The values of n2, n3, and k are 4/3, 3/4, and 0.22, respectively; and the 
range of validity for the model is stated as 2 ≤ er ≤ 104, 0.025 in ≤ h ≤ 0.125 in, 0.9 
≤ W/h ≤ 6, and f < 0.5fe.
1.3.2  An Empirical Relation [35]
Based on the results of various theoretical and experimental studies of dispersion, 
it may be noted that:
1.	 The normalized phase velocity vp is a monotonically decreasing function of fre-
quency f.
2.	 vp and its first-order derivative at f = 0 are given by

Comparison with experimental results shows that the error in (1.69) is less than 
3 percent.
1.3.3  Dielectric-Loaded Ridged Waveguide Model [36]
This model for the microstrip dispersion is based on the study of another structure 
that resembles a microstrip as far as inhomogeneity of the dielectric medium is

concerned but has a shape that can be analyzed mathematically. This structure is 
shown in Figure 1.14. The configuration shown in Figure 1.14(b) corresponds to 
the microstrip cross section shown in Figure 1.14(a). The dimensions of the struc-
ture are chosen such that it has the same electrical characteristics at zero frequency 
as the microstrip. The structure is analyzed for dispersion, and the results are com-
pared with measured microstrip dispersion values to determine the unknown pa-
rameter H′/h. The comparison shows that H′/h and related parameters are nearly 
constant or vary linearly with characteristic impedance. This feature is used to 
derive a simple formula that can be used to predict the dispersion of a microstrip 
transmission line. The resulting dispersion formula may be written as
	
εre(f) = εr -
εr - εre(0)
1 + f 2⁄ fp

(

(1.71)
where
	
fp = Z0m ⁄ (2µ0h) 	
(1.72)
or
	
fP(GHz) = 0.398 Z0m ⁄h(mm)
and
	
G= 0.6 + 0.009 Z0m
(Z0m in ohms) 	
(1.73)
In (1.71), ere(f) is the frequency-dependent effective dielectric constant and ere (0) is 
the zero-frequency (quasi-static) value of ere.
Modification of Getsinger’s Formula
Edwards and Owens [39] have reported extensive measurement results of disper-
sion in microstrip lines of characteristic impedance ranging from 10 Ω to 100 Ω 
over the frequency range of 2 GHz to 18 GHz. They have pointed out that meas-
ured results show better agreement with Getsinger’s formula when G of (1.73) is 
modified as
	
G =
Z0m - 5
60
{

1/2
+ 0.004 Z0m 	
(1.74)
The experiments of Edwards and Owens [39] were carried out on sapphire sub-
strates (er = 10.73 to 11.50), and their results were found to be in good agree-
ment with the fullwave analysis using Galerkin’s method in the spectral domain 
(discussed later in Section 2.2.2). Modification of (1.71), which results in a more 
accurate formula, has also been suggested. This may be written as
	
εre(f) = εr −εr - εre (0)
1 + P
	
(1.75)

with h in millimeters and f in gigahertz.
1.3.4  Empirical Formulae for Broad Frequency Range
The aforementioned dispersion models have been tested by comparison with ex-
perimental results up to 18 GHz and, in general, found to be in good agreement. 
However, they have limited range in terms of frequency, dielectric constant values, 
and W/h ratios. Several dispersion formulae have been developed by fitting full-
wave numerical data in order to extend the validity range of the above-described 
dispersion model expressions.
Yamashita et al. [41] published a dispersion model that is valid up to 100 GHz.

and ere (0) is the quasi-static value obtained earlier. The model is applicable in the 
range 2 ≤ er ≤ 16, 0.06 ≤ W/h ≤ 16, and f ≤ 100 GHz.
In 1982, Kirschning and Jansen improved the accuracy of dispersion character-
istics and claimed accuracy better than 0.6 percent up to 60 GHz. The following

P4 = 1 + 2.751[1 - exp{εr ⁄15.916)8}]
The frequency f is in gigahertz and the thickness h is in centimeters.
Kobayashi [49] further improved the accuracy of the dispersion model in terms 
of dielectric constant and frequency range. Since his formula has no restriction on 
the h/l0 ratio, it will predict more accurately the distortion in pulse propagation 
along a microstrip line. The proposed model uses normalizing frequency f50 at 
which the dispersion is 50 percent and the expressions for f50 is derived using exten-
sive fullwave numerical data. The Kobayashi’s dispersion formula for the effective 
relative dielectric constant is given by

1.3.5  Planar Waveguide Model
It has been shown [38] that the dynamic properties of a microstrip (including 
higher order modes) can be approximated by a planar waveguide model. In this 
model, the microstrip is represented by a parallel plate waveguide of width Weff 
and height h as shown in Figure 1.15a. The top and bottom plates are of infinite 
conductivity, and there are magnetic walls at the sides. It is filled with a medium 
of dielectric constant ere. The value of ere at zero frequency is determined from a 
quasi-static analysis. The effective width Weff and the effective dielectric constant 
ere are frequency dependent. The frequency dependence of the effective dielectric 
constant describes the influence of the dispersion on the phase velocity, whereas 
the frequency dependence of the effective width describes the influence of the 
dispersion on the characteristic impedance. It is found, from the results of the 
fullwave analysis discussed later in Chapter 2, that the phase velocity of the waves 
in a microstrip decreases with increasing frequency. Thus the value of ere increases 
with frequency. Also, the characteristic impedance of a microstrip increases with 
frequency (Section 2.4). This increase in impedance can be explained only by a 
hypothetical decrease in the effective strip width caused by the concentration of 
electric field lines below the strip at higher frequency. The decrease of the effective 
strip width with frequency is described by the empirical relation [38]
	
Weff(f) = W + Weff (0) - W
1 + f ⁄fg
	
(1.84a)

A comparison of the experimental results with the values calculated using (1.84) 
is shown in Figure 1.15(b). Further, knowing Weff (f) one can calculate the cut-off 
frequencies for higher order modes from the relation [38]
	
fc(m,0) =
mc

(1.85)

Measured and calculated cut-off frequencies of the first two higher order modes 
are shown in Figure 1.16 [38]. The two modes indicated as m = 1 and m = 2 in this 
figure are the HE1 and HE2 modes, respectively. There is a fairly good agreement 
between the measured results and theoretical values.
1.3.6  Some Comments
The aforementioned models assume an open microstrip line on a nonmagnetic sub-
strate (mr = 1) and that the thickness effect is included in the quasi-static value ere 
(0). Atwater [48] and Edwards [6] reported dispersion data comparison for several 
microstrip lines using many dispersion models. York and Compton [51] provided 
a comparison between the measured data and the several above-described disper-
sion models up to 18 GHz for several substrate thicknesses. Microstrip lines used

Table 1.1, which shows that the models of Edwards and Owens [39], Kirschning 
and Jansen [44] and Kobayashi [49] gave the most consistent results when com-
pared with measured data. Figure 1.17 compares measured and simulated [52] 
εre(f) as a function of frequency for a microstrip on 0.97-mm alumina substrate 
(er = 9) with W/h = 0.867.
The frequency dependence of the effective dielectric constant describes the in-
fluence of dispersion on the phase velocity, whereas the frequency dependence of 
the effective width describes the influence of the dispersion on the characteristic 
impedance. Fortunately for high-impedance lines and thin substrates, the changes 
in ere and Z0m with frequency are very small. The frequency below which dispersion 
effects may be neglected is given by the relation
	
fd = 0.3
Z0m
h εr -1
	
(1.87)
where fd is in gigahertz and h is in centimeters. Equation (1.87) shows that fd is 
higher for high-impedance lines on thin substrates. For example, a 50-Ω line on a 
100-mm-thick GaAs substrate has negligible dispersion below 11 GHz.

Microstrip Transitions
A microwave transition is an interface used to launch microwave power from one 
transmission line to another with the minimum possible reflective and dissipative 
losses. This structure is also called a launcher. The desirable features of a microstrip 
transition are:
1.  Low transmission and reflection losses over the operating bandwidth;
2.  Easily connectable and disconnectable to a microstrip with reproducible results;
3.  In-line design and simple fabrication;
4.  Adaptability to different substrate thicknesses.
The design of these transitions consists of two parts: mechanical design to match 
physically both electrical and magnetic field distributions between the two media as 
close as possible in order to keep the discontinuity reactances small, and the elec-
trical design to match the impedances and any other interface discontinuity reac-
tances over the operating frequency range to minimize losses. Generally, fields are 
matched by shaping the structure, and the impedance matching and discontinuity 
reactance compensation are realized by using l/4 transformers or tapered sections. 
Various microstrip transitions used in practice are, for example, coaxial-to-micro-
strip, waveguide-to-microstrip, microstrip-to-coplanar waveguide, and microstrip-
to-slotline. Microstrip-to-slotline and microstrip-to-coplanar line transitions will 
be treated in Chapters 5 and 7, respectively. Coaxial-to-microstrip and waveguide-
to-microstrip transitions are briefly described in this section.

Microstrip Lines I: Quasi-Static Analyses, Dispersion Models, and Measurements
1.4.1  Coaxial-to-Microstrip Transition
A coaxial-to-microstrip transition is the simplest and in general is broadband be-
cause both media support TEM mode. This transition is generally realized by shap-
ing the coaxial connector’s structure and has been well treated in the literature [4, 
6, 53-56].
Figure 1.18 shows typical in-plane and right-angle coaxial-to-microstrip tran-
sitions. The center conductor pin in these connectors is generally soldered to the 
microstrip for high reliability. In an in-plane transition, there should be no gap 
between the microstrip ground plane and the fixture’s top surface and between 
the connector’s flange and the fixture front side. Any such gap, as shown in Figure 
1.19, will result in an additional discontinuity reactance due to long ground plane 
current flow.
In general, the coaxial-to-microstrip transition can be represented by a simple 
equivalent circuit as shown in Figure 1.20, where Ls and Cs are the series induct-
ance and shunt capacitance, respectively. The design of such a transition consists of 
either minimizing these reactances or compensating for them by making Ls ⁄Cs = 
50 Ω or any other characteristic impedance value used.
An accurate characterization of packaged microwave circuits such as broad-
band MMIC power amplifiers require coaxial-to-microstrip transitions with 
VSWR lower than 1.2. In such cases, minimizing the interface discontinuity reac-
tances is desired rather than compensating for the discontinuities, which limits the

frequency range. This is accomplished by matching both the electric and magnetic 
field patterns of the two media at the interface using an off-centered inner conduc-
tor as shown in Figure 1.21 [54]. In this case the center conductor of the coaxial 
connector is gradually shifted down so that its end touches the microstrip con-
ductor. Throughout the connector length, the characteristic impedance of 50 Ω is 
maintained.
Figure 1.22(a) shows the Eisenhart transition with APC 7 connector that uses 
7-mm of outer diameter coaxial line. The transition was tested by connecting back-
to-back using a 5.1-cm-long 50-Ω microstrip line on 25-mil alumina substrate. 
The measured VSWR shown in Figure 1.22(b) was less than 1.12 up to 18 GHz, 
implying that each transition’s VSWR is less than 1.06. A similar transition is also 
available with SMA connectors. These transitions are called Eisenhart connectors. 
The Eisenhart connectors were characterized using 50-Ω microstrip lines printed 
on 10-, 15-, 20-, and 25-mil-thick alumina substrates (er = 9.9). For Eisenhart 
connector evaluation and consequently coaxial-to-microstrip transition model de-
velopment, microstrip lines were 243-mil long. Figure 1.23 shows measured and 
modeled responses for a 15-mil-thick microstrip line. Two different line lengths 
were used (printed in 15-mil-thick substrate) to extract connector losses from total 
measured losses. Figure 1.24 shows the transition model values as a function of 
substrate thickness. In general, Eisenhart connectors work very well up to 18 GHz.
Several other coaxial-to-microstrip interface discontinuity minimization tech-
niques have also been used in practice. One of them uses a metal screw in order to 
reduce the transition capacitance [53]. This transition uses a hole in the fixture for 
the screw and a circular hole in the ground plane of the microstrip near the transi-
tion. The coaxial connector is of the SMA type, and the microstrip uses 0.5-mm-
thick sapphire substrate. Measured VSWR was less than 1.01 over the 1-GHz to 
18-GHz frequency range [6].
1.4.2  Waveguide-to-Microstrip Transition
The use of microstrip in millimeter-wave ICs up to 110 GHz has generated a re-
quirement for broadband waveguide-to-microstrip transitions, as nearly all labo-
ratory equipment is fitted with rectangular waveguide RF connectors. Since the 
maximum operating bandwidth of a millimeter-wave waveguide is about 50%, the 
waveguide-to-microstrip transition bandwidth is limited to the waveguide operat-
ing bandwidth. Several different techniques [57-66] have been used to design a 
waveguide-to-microstrip transition; however, the commonly used method employs 
a ridged waveguide as an intermediate step because of broad bandwidth, better 
field match, and wider range of available impedances. Electric field matching from 
a rectangular waveguide to a microstrip through a ridged waveguide is shown in 
Figure 1.25. The waveguide wave impedance is transformed to a microstrip char-
acteristic impedance by using a broadband stepped ridged waveguide transformer 
[57]. It is found that four- or five-step l/4 transformers occupy a very small space 
and provide satisfactory performance. A four-step ridged waveguide transformer 
operating over the 27.5-GHz to 31.3-GHz band was designed connected to the

microstrip by a tab as shown in Figure 1.26. The microstrip used was fabricated on 
a 0.76-mm-thick quartz substrate. The transition measured greater than a 30-dB 
return loss and less than a 0.1-dB insertion loss over the band. A similar transition 
was also analyzed using the mode matching method and the cascading procedure 
using generalized scattering matrices [66].
However, at higher frequencies, the accuracy limitations of achieving the small 
dimensions required dictates the performance possible, and the fabrication of such 
a transition poses serious problems. Tapered ridged waveguide transformers, as 
shown in Figure 1.27, were also investigated. It was found that a cosine-shaped 
taper over about three-guide wavelengths long at midband resulted in excellent 
performance and was considerably less critical in terms of mechanical problems. 
Several other waveguide-to-microstrip transitions have been described in the 
literature [58-60, 62-65]. The simple probe-type waveguide-to-microstrip transi-
tion [63] shown in Figure l.28 is very suitable for combining MIC/MMIC compo-
nents with waveguide components. As shown in Figure 1.28, the transition con-

sists of a microstrip integrated circuit that is partially extended into the waveguide 
through an aperture in the broad wall. The substrate fits the full height to facilitate 
precise alignment. The probe conductor couples the energy from the waveguide; 
and its input impedance, which is about 75 Ω, is matched to 50 Ω by using a l/4 
transformer.
The critical dimensions shown in Figure 1.28 fare optimized and summarized 
in Table 1.2 [63]. An RT5880/Duroid (er = 2.2) substrate was used for microstrip 
lines. The transition was characterized by connecting two transitions back-to-back 
by a 1.524-cm-long microstrip line. The measured performance for several transi-
tions is also given in Table 1.2.
Microstrip-to-substrate integrated waveguide and coplanar waveguide-to-sub-
strate integrated waveguide transitions are described in Chapter 9.

Microstrip Measurements
As in the case of other transmission structures the important characteristics that 
need be measured for a microstrip are: (i) characteristic impedance, (ii) phase veloc-
ity, and (iii) attenuation constant. Also, in several cases, the dielectric constant of 
the substrate material is not known accurately. Since this information is required 
for microstrip circuit design, methods have been devised for quick determination 
of the dielectric constant of metallized substrates [67–69].

In this section we will briefly outline the methods for measuring the substrate 
dielectric constant and microstrip line characteristics.
1.5.1  Substrate Dielectric Constant
An accurate knowledge of the relative dielectric constant value of substrates is very 
important for circuit design because this value is used to determine the character-
istic impedance and phase velocity. Dielectric constant values for monocrystalline 
materials such as quartz, sapphire, and GaAs, are fixed. However, for plastic sub-
strates, amorphous materials such as glass, and polycrystalline materials such as ce-
ramics, the dielectric constant value depends upon the manufacturing process and 
the composition of the final material. In order to control the process, an accurate 
and automatic er measurement technique is necessary.

Basic requirements of an accurate method of measuring er include rapid and 
nondestructive testing, no machining or metallization of the sample (accept sub-
strate as is), real-time measurement, error less than 1 percent, frequency range of 
1 GHz to 20 GHz, and handling capability for substrates 0.2-mm to 2-mm thick 
and 2.5-cm to 10.0-cm long. Several simple techniques for the dielectric constant 
measurement of microwave substrates have been reported in the literature and are 
in common use [67–72]. These techniques incorporate the dielectric specimen in a 
resonant structure, and the permittivity is calculated from a measurement of the 
resonant frequencies.
In the normal course of fabricating dielectric substrates for MICs, a dielectric-
filled resonator cavity is automatically constructed. The rectangular substrate with 
its top- and bottom-surface metallization (sides not metallized) becomes a paral-
lel plate dielectric-loaded waveguide resonator. This structure is shown in Figure 
l.29(a). For high dielectric constant substrates the fringing field is very small, and 
the sides of the resonator are good approximations to open circuits. The resonant 
frequency fmn for this type of resonator is given by

where m and n represent the mode of resonance and correspond to the number of 
half cycle variations along W and ℓ, respectively. Values of fmn are shown in Figure 
1.29(b) as dots superimposed on the dispersion curves.
To measure the substrate dielectric constant, the parallel plate resonator is cou-
pled to the measurement system by placing it between two APC-7 type coaxial 
connectors [67] as shown in Figure 1.30(a). Details of the coupling are shown in 
Figure 1.30(b). Transmission measurements may be carried out by using a network 
analyzer or any other suitable system. The modes are identified by referring to 
Figure 1.29(b).
The accuracy of the above method is limited because of the fringing field and 
radiation from the open sides of the resonator. A modification has been suggested 
[68] wherein the substrate is metallized on all sides so that a small microwave cav-
ity is formed. Equation (1.88) for the various resonant frequencies is still valid. 
Resonant frequencies are measured by clearing metallization from the corners of 
the cavity and positioning the center conductor in APC-7 connectors as shown in 
Figure 1.30.
Coupling errors in cavity resonance measurements on MIC dielectric substrates 
are discussed by Ladbrooke et al. [69]. An alternative coupling scheme wherein a 
coupling aperture is photolithographically cut in the top plane has been suggested. 
Details of this scheme are shown in Figure 1.31. The broadwall hole with an over-
laid strip provides the required coupling, and the energy transfer into and out of 
the cavity is adequate without having to make the aperture unacceptably large. 
This type of coupling scheme has been used with substrates that are metallized on 
the sides also.
Errors because of coupling are analyzed by considering the perturbation of 
fields. It has been pointed out [69] that the two methods of coupling, namely, cor-
ner coupling for resonators with open sides and aperture coupling for resonators 

40
Microstrip Lines I: Quasi-Static Analyses, Dispersion Models, and Measurements
with metallized sides, are complementary. As shown in Figures 1.30(b) and 1.31(b) 
respectively, corner coupling involves the perturbation of electric field lines whereas 
in the aperture coupling the magnetic field of the resonator is distributed. Errors 
in the two cases are of opposite natures, and an improved accuracy (; 0.5 percent) 
can be obtained by averaging the results obtained by the two methods.
Although cavity methods are straightforward, they do not lend themselves 
readily to automated measurements. On the other hand, transmission line methods 
[73,74] are particularly well suited to automated measurements. In these methods, 
the sample is placed in a waveguide and the dielectric constant value is extracted 
from the two-port scattering parameter measurement using an automatic vector 
network analyzer. The unmetallized sample is centered between the sidewalls of the 
waveguide as shown in Figure 1.32 and is easily inserted or extracted via a slot. The 
widespread availability of accurate computer-eontrolled network analyzers makes 
this technique attractive. This method of measurement has been described by York 
and Compton [74].
The dielectric constant can also be determined by measuring the reflection co-
efficient using an open-ended coaxial line [75] in contact with the unmetallized 
dielectric substrate. This method has been commercialized by Hewlett-Packard by 
developing an HP 85070B dielectric probe kit that includes a coaxial probe and 
the software. The probe is placed in contact with the dielectric substrate and the 
reflection coefficient is measured using a vector network analyzer. Since the co-
axial’s open-end fringing fields interact with the dielectric material, er and tan δ are 
derived from the reflected signal by solving the boundary value problem. The fre-
quency range of the measurement is from 0.2 GHz to 20 GHz and the accuracy of 
measurement is about 5 percent. This probe can only be used with thick substrates.
All the above-described transmission and reflection measurement methods re-
quire special tools and software to determine the dielectric constant value. The 
dielectric constant value can also easily be determined by making transmission 
measurements on a 50-Ω microstrip line using RF probes [76] or using microstrip 
transitions as described in the previous section. The effective dielectric constant 
may be written as
	
εre = εr + 1
2
+ εr −1
2
F
 
or
	
εr = [2εre + F - 1]/(F + 1) 	
(1.89)
where F is obtained from (1.17). For a given 50-Ω microstrip line length l, if the 
measured transmission phase (∠S21) in degrees is f, then

where f is in gigahertz and l is in centimeters. Thus, by calculating F as described 
in Chapter 2, the er value can easily be determined. In these measurements, either 
dispersion effects are kept at a minimum or taken into account in the calculations.
Precise characterization of MIC, MMIC, and plastic substrates for dielectric 
properties have been reported recently. Many methods are suggested to measure

the dielectric constant, loss tangent, and anisotropy of these substrates. Some of 
these methods are modified versions of aforementioned techniques, and others are 
based on the measurement of various resonant frequencies. Because it is not in 
the scope of this book to discuss these methods further, the readers are referred to 
numerous published papers [120–126] on this topic. Anistropy in the substrates is 
covered in Section 2.4.4.
1.5.2  Characteristic Impendance
Since fairly good coaxial-to-microstrip transitions are available, impedance meas-
urement methods are identical to those employed for other transmission lines.
The characteristic impedance can be measured by terminating the microstrip 
in a matched load and measuring the maximum and minimum VSWR values as 
functions of frequency. If the impedance to be measured is Z0m Ω using a 50-Ω 
reference line, then

reflectometry (TDR), and thus the ambiguity between the exponents +1 and –1 can 
be resolved very easily. It may be noted that this method assumes the frequency in-
sensivity of Z0m, which is a good approximation for the frequency range of interest.
The above method of measurement has been described by Caulton et al. [77] 
and by Seckelmann [78]. Several other methods of measuring the characteristic 
impedance of microstrip lines have been discussed by Getsinger [79].
1.5.3  Phase Velocity or Effective Dielectric Constant
The effective dielectric constant of a microstrip can be measured quite accurately 
by using resonance techniques. Both the ring and the linear type resonators have 
been used.

Use of Ring Resonators
A microstrip ring resonator is a microstrip line bent in a circular shape to close 
in upon itself (Figure 1.33(a)). The main advantage of using ring resonators for 
dispersion measurements [80] is that, in contrast to the linear resonators, no end 
effects need to be considered. The resonant frequencies of this type of resonator 
could be calculated assuming that the mean length of the strip forming the resona-
tor is a multiple of the guide wavelength on the microstrip.
For ring resonators, the curvature of the ring influences the resonance frequen-
cies, so only large resonators can be used. The influence of the curvature becomes 
large if substrate materials with small relative permittivities and lines with small 
impedances are used. Under these conditions, the width of the lines becomes large 
and a mean radius cannot be well defined. When short resonators are used, an ac-
curate analysis of ring resonators is needed. A magnetic wall model of microstrip 
ring resonators has been discussed by Wolff and Knoppik [81].
The eigenvalue equation resulting from the boundary conditions of a magnetic 
wall ring resonator model may be written as
	
′Jn (kra)
′Jn (kri) -
′
Nn (kra)
′
Nn (kri) = 0
	
(1.92)
where k is the wave number in unbounded dielectric and ra and ri represent outer 
and inner radii, respectively. J′n(x) and N′n(x) represent derivatives of Bessel func-
tions of the first and the second kind, respectively. Some results based on the so-
lution of (1.92) are described in [81]. It is shown that curvature effects are more 
pronounced for wider lines (impedances smaller than 50 Ω).
More accurate calculations for curvature effect in microstrip ring resonators 
are presented by Owens [82]. In this method a planar waveguide model is used 
Figure 1.32  A waveguide holder for measuring 2-port S-parameters of a microwave substrate for 
dielectric constant evaluation (from [74]).

for the microstrip. Equation (1.92) still holds provided the width of the strip is 
replaced by the effective width given by this model. Since the effective width is fre-
quency dependent, the frequency variation of the fringing field at the edges of the 
microstrip is also taken into account.
Extensive measurements were made using ring resonators realized with charac-
teristic impedances in the range of 20 Ω to 86 Ω on 200-mm-thick GaAs substrate 
(er = 12.9). In these measurements the microstrip configuration uses the compos-
ite dielectric structure shown in Figure 1.33 [83]. Here the thicknesses of silicon 
nitride and dielectric composite layers are very small compared to the substrate 
thickness. Simulated and measured effective dielectric constant versus frequency 
are shown in Figure 1.33(b). Note that dispersion effects are negligible up to 18 
GHz for microstrip lines of Z0m ≥ 50 Ω on 200-mm-thick substrate.
Linear Resonator Method
The main difficulty with the use of a linear resonator is caused by the end ef-
fects. When a linear resonator is coupled to the measurement system at one end, as 
shown in Figure 1.34(a), the reactances at the two ends are different. The open end 
can be represented either by a shunt capacitance or by an incremental line length 
∆l0c. On the other hand, the gap between the input line and the resonator is rep-
resented by a p-network of capacitances, and the incremental length ∆lg shown in 
the figure is different from ∆l0c. Measurement of the discontinuity reactances will 
be discussed in detail in Chapter 4. For the purposes of the present discussion, one 
requires incorporating the effect of these reactances for the accurate measurement 
of resonant frequencies. A method suitable for this purpose has been described 
by Richings [84] and by Easter [85]. This method suggests the use of a modified 
resonator set up as shown in Figure 1.34(b). A lm/4 section at the other end of the 
resonator ensures that the reactances at two ends of the resonator are identical. 
Thus, there are only two unknowns now, and these (ere and ∆lg) can be evaluated if 
measurements are carried out for two different lengths of the resonator.
Alternatively, the effective dielectric constant can be measured by the substitu-
tion method using two resonators [6, 51]. Here it is assumed that the two reso-
nant frequencies f1 and f2 are very close and that the two structures as shown in 
Figure 1.35 are identical except for the physical lengths L1 and L2 of the resonators. 
In this configuration, the resonators are loosely coupled, and from the nth-order 
l/2 resonance frequency

where subscripts 1 and 2 denote resonators 1 and 2, respectively, and c is the veloc-
ity of light. The term le represents the sum of the coupling-gap end effect ∆lg and 
the open-end effect ∆loc. When ere and le are constant over the f2 – f1 range, (1.93) 
becomes

This method provides ere as a function of frequency and can also be used to calcu-
late er from ere as described previously in Section 1.5.1.
1.5.4  Attenuation Constant
The most satisfactory method for measuring the attenuation constant for low-loss 
substrates is from the Q-factor of a resonant section of the line. The attenuation 
constant and the unloaded quality factor Q0 are related by the expression
	
α = 27.3n
Q0λm
dB⁄cm
(
) 	
(1.96)
where n is the number of half wavelengths and lm is the guide wavelength in cen-
timeters.
It has been pointed out that the ring resonator technique is less suitable for 
the accurate measurement of microstrip losses because of increased surface wave 
radiation loss [86]. On the other hand, the shielded open-ended linear resonator in 
a waveguide below cut-off gives a reliable value of the attenuation constant.
More accurate methods for measuring microstrip line losses have also been 
described in the literature [87, 88]. Extensive measured data for microstrip loss 
on GaAs substrates as shown in Figure 1.36 have been given by Goldfarb and 
Platzker [87]. The results given are for an impedance range of 20 Ω to 90 Ω and 
for frequencies up to 40 GHz. Figure 1.37 shows a 50-Ω microstrip line loss as a 
function of frequency. Measured data was also compared with Touchstone (TS1.7), 
Super Compact (SC2.0), and MDS (HP85150B). The microstrip parameters used 
for comparison were: unit line length = 1 mm, er = 12.9, h = 100 mm, t = 3 mm, 
conductor resistivity = 2.44 mΩ.cm, tan δ = 0, and roughness factor = 0. Figure 1.38 
shows measured loss versus line width at several frequencies [87].
An approximate but very simple method for measuring the attenuation con-
stant is based on the comparison technique. In this method two microstrip lines 
with identical electrical characteristics but different lengths are used. Their inser-
tion losses are measured. The difference between the two values of insertion loss 
is used to evaluate the attenuation constant. This procedure avoids the systematic 
errors caused by radiation, coaxial-to-microstrip transition, and so forth. With 
recent advancements in the de-embedding techniques and RF probes, the attenua-
tion constant of a microstrip line can also be measured accurately using two-port 
scattering parameter measurements.

Fabrication
Since the early 1950s, after the invention of planar transmission lines, such as strip-
lines and microstrip lines, work on microwave planar printed circuits, as well as the 
usage of lumped elements at microwave frequencies, began. The miniaturization 
and batch fabrication of several microwave functions for large volume production 
brought about a revolution in the microwave industry. Early work on planar print-

ed circuits served as the seed for the successful introduction of radio frequency (RF) 
and microwave integrated circuits (MICs), including microwave printed circuits, 
printed circuit boards [89, 90], thin and thick film MICs, low-temperature cofired 
ceramic (LTCC) [91–107], and monolithic integrated circuits [108–119]. Various 
integrated fabrication techniques based on the substrate used can be grouped into 
three categories: plastic substrates, glass and ceramic substrates, and semiconduc-
tor substrates. Salient features of fabrication steps are described in this section.
1.6.1  Printed Circuit Technologies
Microwave Printed Circuits
Microwave printed circuit (MPC) technology is widely used for microwave passive 
circuits and printed antennas. The first step is to generate the artwork from design. 
The enlarged artwork is then photo reduced using a high-precision camera to pro-
duce a high-resolution negative (also known as a mask), which is used for exposing 
the photoresist that is spun over the substrate. The mask is placed on the substrate 
and held using a vacuum frame or other technique in order to assure the fine-line 
resolution that is required. With exposure to the proper wavelength light, a polym-
erization of the exposed photoresist occurs, making it insoluble in the developer 
solution. The backside of the substrate is exposed completely without a mask, since 
the copper foil is retained to act as a ground plane. The substrate is developed in 
a developer that removes the soluble photoresist material. When these steps have 
been completed, the substrate is now ready for etching. This is a critical step and 
requires considerable care so that proper etch rates are achieved. After etching, 
the excess photoresist is removed using a stripping solution. The substrate is then 
rinsed in water and dried. Finally, the substrate is cut into the required small sizes. 
MPCs use a large range of plastic type substrates.
Printed Circuit Board
Printed circuit boards are fabricated like conventional MPCs using photo-etching 
process. In a basic multilayer printed circuit board fabrication process, first a 
copper foil is laminated to the dielectric sheets. The required interconnect and 
component patterns are then etched on all substrates by using a photolithography

technique. The substrates are stacked and laminated under heat and pressure 
to make a monolithic board. Next, via holes are drilled in the board to make 
interlayer metallic connections and are catalyzed; the whole board is plated with 
electroless copper. This increases the thickness of the surface conductor pattern and 
provides the copper layer in the via holes. The board is then tinned for soldering, or 
nickel or gold plated for gold wire bonding. These circuits are generally made from 
multilayer FR-4 substrate material. 
1.6.2  Hybrid Microwave Integrated Circuits
Thin-Film MIC Technology
The first step in the fabrication process of thin-film MIC is the deposition of a first 
layer (seed layer) of metal film on a commonly used alumina substrate. The selec-
tion of the film is made based on the criterion of good adhesion to the substrate and 
is one of the most important factors in selecting a conductor material for the first 
layer of metal film. At radio frequencies, the electromagnetic fields are confined 
to several skin depths of the conductors. In order to achieve low loss, the layer of 
high-resistivity material, such as chromium used for adhesion, must be extremely 
thin. Metal films are deposited on substrates by three methods: vacuum evapora-
tion, electron-beam evaporation, and sputtering. A typical metal combination for 
alumina substrate is Cr/Cu/Au or NiCr/Ni/Au. A very thin seed layer of suitable 
metal is deposited on the substrate by one of the preceding techniques, and then the 
bulk conductor metal is deposited by electroplating techniques. The seed layers of 
metal provide mechanical and electrical foundation layers on which to electroplate 
a good-quality bulk conductor metal. The circuit definition can be accomplished 
by a plate-through technique or by an etchback technique. The plate-through tech-
nique begins with a substrate coated with a thin layer of evaporated metal, fol-
lowed by an application of a thick photoresist. The thickness of this photoresist is 
similar to the thickness of the final metal film required. After defining a pattern in 
the photoresist, the second metal layer is plated up to the desired thickness with 
precise definition, only in the areas where metal is required. The photoresist layer 
is then washed away and the thick seed-metal is etched with very little undercut 
from the undesired areas. This technique is also suitable for fabricating lines that 
are 25–50 mm wide and/or when the separation between them is 25–50 mm.

quency of the two resonators, end effects can be canceled.

The second technique is the etchback technique that utilizes a thick metal layer 
defined either completely by evaporation or by a combination of a thin evaporated 
layer and a thicker plated layer. A thin photoresist layer is used as a mask to define 
the circuit pattern. The undesired areas of metal are then removed by etching. This 
technique results in undercutting the metal film by about twice the line conductor 
thickness. The plate-through technique not only permits better definition for thick 
conductors, but also saves on cost in that only the required material (gold in this 
case) is deposited.
Thick-Film MIC Technology
Thick-film MICs are fabricated using various inks pressed through patterned silk 
screens. Thick-film MICs are inexpensive and are generally limited to the lower end 
of the microwave spectrum. In a conventional thick-film technology, the multilayer 
interconnects are formed by successive screen printing of conductors, dielectric 
layers, and resistor patterns on a base substrate. The materials are in the form 
of inks or pastes. After screen printing, each layer is dried at about 150°C for 15 
minutes and fired at about 850°C for 30–60 minutes. The printing, drying, and 
firing steps are repeated to fabricate the multilayer circuitry in a fully automated 
way to produce high-volume, cost-effective components.

Low-Temperature Cofired Ceramic
The low-temperature cofired ceramic (LTCC) manufacturing process is similar to 
the thick-film process, except that it does not use a base substrate. Dielectric layers 
are in the form of unfired ceramic tapes (also called green tapes) instead of paste. 
This technology also enables the printing of reliable capacitors and resistors. The 
process consists of blanking, punching vias, conductor screen printing, collating, 
laminating, and firing. The vias are punched in the green tape and filled with 
conducting paste. At the same time, conductor patterns are screen printed. This 
process is carried over for each dielectric layer, and finally the composite structure 
is fired to obtain a monolithic substrate. The firing temperature for glass–ceramic 
substrates is 850–900°C; this technology is known as LTCC technology. Because of 
the low-temperature firing, LTCC allows one to use high-conductivity metals such 
as Ag, Cu, and Au. The dielectric tapes use a glass–ceramic composite optimized 
for a better CTE match with base metal and the semiconductor chips. As many 
as 50 layers can be combined in a single LTCC substrate measuring 6 × 6 inches. 
When ceramic tapes are used, they are fired at 1500–1600°C, and the technology is 
known as high-temperature cofired ceramic (HTCC) technology. Commonly used 
conductors in this case are tungsten (W) and molybdenum (Mo).
1.6.3  Monolithic Integrated Circuit Technologies 
In fabricating monolithic integrated circuit technologies, all active and passive cir-
cuit elements and interconnections are formed together on the surface of a semi-
conductor substrate. There are many ways to fabricate radio frequency (RF) and 
microwave monolithic integrated circuits. Various substrate materials used include 
GaAs, InP, GaN/silicon carbide, and bulk silicon. GaAs, InP, and GaN/silicon 
carbide-based technology is known as monolithic microwave integrated circuit 
(MMIC). while Si-based technology is referred to as RF integrated circuit (RFIC). 
Both technologies basically consist of fabrication of active devices, interconnects 
and passive circuits, and back side processes. Fabrication of interconnects and pas-
sive circuits and back side processes involve a relatively larger number of process 
steps of deposition/sputtering, evaporation, and etching, as compared to hybrid 
MICs. In MMICs, microstrip interconnections, crossovers, inductors, and capaci-
tors are formed by using two levels of metal layer system. Backside processing 
consists of thinning by grinding or lapping via hole etching and ground contact 
metallization and plating. In RFICs, inductors, passive circuits, and interconnects 
are realized by using many available thin deposited metal layers to reduce the cir-
cuit loss due to high dielectric loss in Si substrates because of poor semi-insulating 
property. Micromachining is commonly used to enhance the quality factor of in-
ductors and passive circuits.
Table 1.3 compares the advantages and disadvantages of various microstrip 
fabrication technologies. Monolithic technology is particularly suited for millime-
ter-wave applications through the elimination of the parasitic effects of bond wires, 
which connect discrete components in conventional hybrid microwave integrated 
circuits.

Microstrip Lines II:  
Fullwave Analyses, Design 
Considerations, and Applications
2.1	
Methods of Fullwave Analysis
As pointed out in Chapter 1, the microstrip configuration is not capable of support­
ing a pure TEM mode, and small longitudinal components of both the electric and 
magnetic fields need to be present to satisfy boundary conditions at the dielectric-
air interface. These hybrid modes supported by the microstrip cannot be fully de-
scribed in terms of static capacitances and inductances only. Therefore, one has 
to consider time-varying electric and magnetic fields and solve the wave equation 
subject to appropriate boundary conditions. Field analysis of the microstrip (or any 
other structure, for that matter) without invoking any quasi-static approximations 
is known as fullwave analysis. Fullwave analysis is carried out to determine the 
propagation constant instead of the capacitance evaluated in quasi-static analysis.
Methods of studying wave propagation along a microstrip line without making 
any quasi-static assumption will now be discussed. These methods may be divided 
into two groups. In one group, the microstrip is considered with a rectangular 
enclosure, and the other group deals with open microstrip lines. This grouping be-
comes convenient since different types of mathematical tools are needed to handle 
closed and open geometries. For example, a Fourier series representation can be 
used to express the fields in a closed rectangular structure whereas a Fourier inte-
gral representation is suited for an open structure.
From the arguments given in Section 1.1.2, it can be seen that the microstrip 
modes cannot be pure TM or TE waves either. Longitudinal components of both 
the electric and the magnetic fields are needed. These hybrid modes may be consid-
ered as superposition of TE and TM fields that may, in turn, be expressed in terms 
of two scalar potentials yh and ye, respectively. Referring to the microstrip configu-
ration of Figure 2.1, the longitudinal and transverse components of the electric and 
magnetic fields may be written as
	
Ez = j (k2 - β2) ⁄β

where b is the unknown propagation constant along the z-direction and k = w(e0 
er m0)1/2. Subscript t refers to transverse coordinates (x, y), and zˆ is a unit vector 
in the z-direction. These relations hold good for both regions 1 and 2, shown in 
Figure 2.1, when a suitable value of er is used in the wavenumber k. Appropriate 
expressions for ye and yh are chosen for regions 1 and 2. It has been assumed that 
the structure is lossless and the substrate is nonmagnetic. The field representation 
of (2.1) to (2.4) is also valid for an enclosed microstrip structure.
The modes of propagation can be divided into two orthogonal sets of modes 
because the structure is symmetrical about the y-z-plane. One of these sets has a 
symmetric Ez component and an antisymmetric Hz component (Ez even – Hz odd), 
while the other set is designated as Ez odd – Hz even. The dominant mode is the 
lowest order Ez even – Hz odd mode and approaches the quasi-TEM solution at 
low frequencies.
2.2	
Analysis of an Open Microstrip
Fullwave analysis of an open microstrip may be carried out by using a Fourier 
transformation along the x-direction (parallel to the substrate and perpendicular 
to the strip). The two methods for analysis described in this section employ such a 

Microstrip Lines and Slotlines
61
transformation and, to that extent, resemble the variational method in the Fourier 
transform domain used for quasi-static analysis of microstrip lines in Chapter 1.
As illustrated in the previous section, various components of the E and H fields 
are expressed in terms of two potentials yh and ye. Fourier transformation is taken 
along the x-direction. Solutions for the transforms of ye and yh are obtained by 
matching the boundary conditions in the transform domain. The interface condi-
tion in the y = h plane is written in terms of longitudinal and transverse electric 
currents on the strip conductor. The two methods described in this section differ 
mainly with regard to the manner in which the boundary conditions at the dielec-
tric-air interface (y = h) are applied.
In the Fourier transform domain, potentials ye and yh may be written as
	
ψ i
e(α,y) =
ψ i
e
−∞
∞∫
(x,y)ejαxdx 	
(2.5)
and a similar relation holds for yh
i . The subscript i = 1, 2 designates the regions 
1 (substrate) and 2 (air), respectively. y˜i’s satisfy the transformed wave equation, 
which may be written as
	
(d2 ⁄dy2 - γi
2) ψi(α,y) = 0 	
(2.6)
where

ki
2 = ω 2εrµrε0µ0         k2
2 = ω 2ε0µ0 	
	
	
	
The next step is to write expressions for y˜i in the two regions such that boundary 
conditions at y = 0 and at y → ∞ are satisfied. These may be written as
	
ψ1
e(α,y) = A(α) sinh(γ 1y) 	
(2.7)
	
ψ2
e(α,y) = B(α) exp[ - γ2(y −h)] 	
(2.8)
	
ψ1
h(α,y) = C(α) cosh(γ1y) 	
(2.9)
	
ψ2
h(α,y) = D(α) exp -γ2(y - h)
[
] 	
(2.10)
The coefficients A, B, C, and D are determined by applying continuity conditions 
across the interface y = h. These conditions are
	
Ez1(α,h) = Ez2(α,h) 	
(2.11)
	
Ex1(α,h) = Ex2(α,h) 	
(2.12)

Microstrip Lines II: Fullwave Analyses, Design Considerations, and Applications 
	
Hz1(α,h) - Hz2(α,h) = - Jx(α) 	
(2.13)
	
Hx1(α,h) - Hx2(α,h) = Jz(α) 	
(2.14)
where J˜x(a) and J˜z (a) are the Fourier transforms of the unknown current compo-
nents on the strip and the second subscript (l or 2) indicates the region 1 or 2. In ad-
dition, the boundary condition that must be satisfied on the strip may be written as
	
Ez2(x,h) = 0        x < W⁄ 2 	
(2.15a)
	
(d ⁄ dy)Hz2(x,h) = 0        x < W /2 	
(2.15b)
We now describe two methods of analyzing open microstrip lines by using the 
aforementioned formulation. These methods differ because of the manner in which 
the boundary conditions (2.15) are applied. In one of the methods, called the in-
tegral equation method by Denlinger [1], boundary conditions (2.15) are applied 
in the space domain ((x-y)-plane). In the other method, called Galerkin’s method 
in FTD [2, 3], the boundary conditions (2.15) are applied in the Fourier transform 
domain ((a-y)-plane).
2.2.1  Integral Equation Method in the Space Domain
Equation (2.7) to (2.15) lead to a set of coupled integral equations for the currents 
J˜x(a) and J˜z(a). These integral equations are derived to be [1]

In deriving (2.16), a one-term approximation has been used for the unknown cur-
rent distributions. J˜x(a) and J˜z(a). These approximations are given as
	
Jx(α) = Ix0Ix(α) 	
(2.26a)
	
Jz(α) = Iz0Iz(α)	
(2.26b)
It has been assumed that J˜x and J˜z have known forms, and the only unknowns in 
their representation are the amplitude coefficients Ix0 and Iz0.
The unknown propagation constant b can now be solved by equating the deter-
minant of the coefficient matrix for the unknowns Ix0 and Iz0 to zero.
The current distributions Ix and Iz, chosen by Denlinger [1], are

It may be pointed out that because of the one-term approximation used here, the 
results are critically dependent on the choice of the form of the current distribution. 
This is a disadvantage of this method.
A considerable simplification in the above analysis results from neglecting the 
transverse current component J˜x. This is a good approximation when the strip

width is small as compared to the wavelength (i.e., W/l0 < 0.1) and when the low-
est order mode is being considered. This approximation reduces the coupled pair 
of integral equations to a single integral equation containing b as a parameter. The 
computer time requirement is therefore considerably reduced.
The dispersion curves based on this method will be discussed along with the 
results of the second method described next.
2.2.2  Galerkin's Method in the Spectral Domain [2, 3]
In this method, the formulation of the problem is similar to that in the above 
method, but the boundary conditions on the strip, given by Equations (2.15), are 
now applied in the spectral domain (or Fourier Transform Domain, FTD) rather 
than in the space domain. In place of integral equations (2.16), one now obtains

Equations (2.28) are solved by the method of moments using Galerkin’s approach.

as follows:

forms are nonzero only on the strip –W/2 < x < W/2. After substituting (2.33) into 
(2.28) and taking the inner product with the basis functions J˜xn and J˜zn for different 
values of n, we obtain the matrix equation

and similar relations hold for other Km,n’s. The simultaneous equations (2.34a) and 
(2.34b) are solved for the propagation constant b by setting the determinant of this 
set of equations equal to zero. In this method also, the results depend on the choice 
of basis functions and the values of M and N selected, and the accuracy of the re-
sults can be increased by selecting higher values of M and N.
Galerkin’s method in FTD has several advantages as compared with the space 
domain integral equation method discussed in the previous subsection.
	
1.	 The method is simpler since the solution is extracted from algebraic equa-
tions and not from the coupled integral equations.
	
2.	 The physical nature of the mode for each solution can easily be recognized 
via the corresponding selection made for the basis functions.
Galerkin’s method in the spectral domain as discussed earlier for an open micro-
strip line is also applicable to a shielded microstrip line (with a metallic cover shield 
but no side walls), to a line with two layers of dielectric substrates, to a microstrip 
line with a dielectric layer on the strip and substrate, and to similar generalized 
printed transmission lines that contain several dielectric layers and conductors ap-
pearing at several dielectric interfaces. This generalized method is known as the 
spectral domain immittance approach [4, 5]. A solution of the equations for the 
transforms of currents in the spectral domain (such as (2.28a, b)) are solved by de-
riving the dyadic Green’s functions (for example, G11, G12, in (2.28))based on the 
transverse equivalent circuit concept applied in the spectral domain in conjunction 
with a simple coordinate transformation rule.
2.2.3  Discussion of Results
The results for the effective dielectric constant found from Galerkin’s method in 
the spectral domain by considering two different sets of M and N are shown in 
Figure 2.2. The basis functions chosen are also shown in this figure. The results 
(effective dielectric constant versus frequency) are compared with Denlinger’s re-
sults [1] based on the method described in Section 2.2.1. It may be noted that the 
first-order solution (N = M = 1) does not give satisfactory values since Jx1 shown in 
Figure 2.2(a) is not a good choice for Jx.
Fullwave analysis of an open microstrip has been extended for the calculation 
of characteristic impedance by Knorr and Tufekcioglu [3]. Galerkin’s approach in 
the spectral domain, as discussed in Section 2.2.2, is used for this computation.

When the transverse component of the current is ignored, we can define the 
characteristic impedance Z0i as
	
Z0i = 2Pavg ⁄ Iz

which is evaluated numerically in each of the two regions.
As in the case of waveguides, alternative definitions of characteristic impedance 
are possible. One can write
	
Z0v = V 2(0)
2Pavg 	
(2.40)
where V(0) is given by
	
V(0) = -
Ey(0,y)dy
0
h∫
	
(2.41)
and denotes the voltage between the center of the strip and the ground plane.
Results based on these two definitions are shown in Figure 2.3(a). The quasi-
static value of the impedance is also shown. We note that the impedance based on 
current (i.e., Z0i) converges to the quasi-static value whereas Z0v does not. This 
is perhaps due to the fact that V(0) is a sensitive function of the assumed current 
distribution whereas the total current used in (2.36) is not.
The results in Figure 2.3(b) show that the characteristic impedance increases 
with frequency. It may be added that for a 1-mm-thick substrate h/l0 = 0.4 cor-
responds to 120 GHz, and at this frequency the impedance increases by about 16 
percent above the quasi-static value. 
The increase in the characteristic impedance with frequency can be interpreted 
qualitatively as follows. When the frequency increases, the effective dielectric con-
stant for the microstrip increases. This has been observed from the results based on 

68
Microstrip Lines II: Fullwave Analyses, Design Considerations, and Applications 
fullwave analysis. An increase in the effective dielectric constant implies that the 
fields are getting concentrated below the strip, which also amounts to a decrease in 
the effective width of the microstrip. The characteristic impedance of a microstrip 
should decrease with the increase of ere. On the other hand, a decrease in the effec-
tive strip width should increase the characteristic impedance. The fullwave analysis 
described above shows that the latter effect is more pronounced. The results based 
on the planar waveguide model discussed in Chapter 1 agree with this interpreta-
tion.
The results for the characteristic impedance and effective dielectric constant for 
the dominant mode of propagation in open microstrip lines may also be obtained 
from the results for enclosed microstrips discussed in Section 2.3. The simplest ap-
proach for this purpose is to make the enclosure dimensions much larger (typically 
10 times) than strip width and substrate height so that the presence of walls do not 
affect the microstrip line characteristics.
2.3	
Analysis of an Enclosed Microstrip
Three different methods of fullwave analysis for an enclosed microstrip structure 
were illustrated in Figure 1.6. Of these, the finite difference method is conceptually 
the simplest. The other methods involved forming and solving integral equations. 
Since the integral equation methods are used most frequently, we discuss them 
first in Section 2.3.1. The configuration of the enclosed microstrip is shown in 
Figure 2.4.

2.3.1  Integral Equation Methods [6–10]
The most commonly used methods for the fullwave analysis of enclosed microstrip 
lines use integral equation formulation. The features of these methods are as fol-
lows: Expressions for potentials ye and yh, in regions 1 and 2, are written in the 
form of series expansions such that the boundary conditions on the metallic periph-
ery of the enclosure are satisfied. Also, since the main interest lies in the dominant 
mode, which is Ez even – Hz odd, the total magnetic field is made to vanish at the 
plane of symmetry x = 0. The appropriate expressions are

where k0 is the free-space wavenumber and the coefficients An and Bn are yet un-

Interface conditions in the plane y = h are applied to the field components de-
rived from (2.42) to (2.45). This results in relations that equate the series of infinite 
terms. These equations are converted to an infinite set of homogeneous simultane-
ous equations for coefficients An and Bn by taking scalar products with a complete 
set of functions appropriate to the various ranges of x. The resulting equations may 
be written either in terms of integral equations or in terms of a matrix equation 
and solved for b. The various methods differ in the manner in which the interface 
conditions are applied and in the method of solving the resulting equations. As for 
open microstrip lines, both space domain and spectral domain formulations have 
been developed, and the spectral domain approach is used more frequently.
Space Domain Approach [6]
This method by Zysman and Varon [6] is a straightforward implementation of the 
steps outlined above. Four mutually independent interface conditions at y = h are 
written as (Figure 2.4)
	
Ex1 = Ex2,
0 < x < L 	
(2.49)
	
Ez1 = Ez2,
0 < x < L 	
(2.50)
	
Ex1 = 0,
0 < x <W /2
Hx1 = Hx2
W /2 < x < L 	
(2.51)
	
Ez1 = 0,
0 < x < W⁄ 2
Hz1 = Hz2
W⁄ 2 < x < L 	
(2.52)
These conditions are now imposed on the field components derivable from (2.42) 
to (2.45). One obtains a pair of coupled homogeneous Fredholm integral equations 
of the first kind [6] as

roots of the determinantal equation of the resulting matrix can be obtained numeri-
cally and yield the phase constant values for propagating waves.
Other variations of the space domain integral equation formulations are dis-
cussed in [7–9].
Galerkin's Method in FTD [10]
This method is similar to Galerkin’s method in FTD used for open microstrip lines 
in Section 2.2.2. The bounded nature of the geometry (Figure 2.4) requires the use 
of the finite Fourier transform instead of the conventional Fourier transform over 
an infinite range. The latter type of transform was used for open microstrip analysis 
in Section 2.2.2. The transform used in the present analysis is defined as

(2.55)
where an = (n – 1/2) p/L for Ez even – Hz odd modes and an = (np/L) for Ez odd – 
Hz even modes (n = 1, 2, ...). The next step is to transform all the field components 
and to apply boundary and interface conditions in the transform domain. This 
leads to [10]

J˜x (an) and J˜z(an) represent transforms of strip currents Jx(x) and Jz(x), respective-

y = h. The electric field components are unknown for W/2 < |x| < L, though they 
are zero on the strip. These two unknowns are eliminated by applying Galerkin’s

tions J˜xm and J˜zm as

functions J˜zi and J˜xi for different values of i, one obtains

(2.60)
It is seen that the right-hand sides of (2.56) are eliminated through the use of 
Parseval’s theorem, because the currents Jzi(x), Jxi(x) and the field components  
Ez(x, h), Ex(x, h) are zero in the complementary regions of x.
The simultaneous equations (2.59) are solved for the propagation constant b at 
each frequency w by setting the determinant of the coefficient matrix equal to zero 
and by seeking the root of the resulting equation. The dispersion characteristics of 
microstrip are derived from the values of b.
The choice of the basis functions is important for the numerical efficiency of 
the method. The accuracy can be improved systematically by increasing the num-
ber of basis functions M or N. However, if the first few basis functions approximate 
the actual unknown current reasonably well, the necessary size of the matrix can 
be held small for a given accurancy of the solution. For the dominant mode, the 
following forms for Jz1 and Jx1 are suitable:

2.3.2  Finite Difference Method
In this method the microstrip cross section is divided into small rectangles by means 
of a rectangular net. Wave equations for ye and yh are solved for values of the po-
tentials at the net points, and for this purpose the wave equations for ye and yh 
may be written in finite difference form as [11]
	 λψ m,n

Integers m and n in subscripts refer to the coordinates of the grid point. The config-
uration and the coordinate system are shown in Figure 2.4. After applying bound-
ary and interface conditions, the finite difference equations (2.65) and (2.66) may 
be written in the form of the matrix equation

[ ] = λ φ
[ ] 	
(2.67)
where [A] is the coefficient matrix, which is sparse and has the size 2(MN – 1) by 
2(MN – 1) with MDx = L and NDy = H (as shown in Figure 2.4). Potentials ye
m,n 
and yh
m,n are elements of vector f. It may be pointed out that l has different values 
in regions 1 and 2.
There are several methods of solving (2.67), and a discussion of these tech-
niques is given in [11] and [12]. It may be pointed out that the relaxation method 
used for quasi-static analysis becomes prohibitively slow in the present case. A 
method suitable for the present case has been described by Martin and Wilkinson 
[13]. Also, the matrix resulting from (2.65) and (2.66) is asymmetric, whereas ef-
ficient methods are available for the solution of symmetric matrix eigenvalue prob-
lems. A symmetric matrix can be obtained by using the variational method [12]. 
Another advantage of the variational method is that a graded mesh (with closer 
spacings near the strip and wider spacings near the enclosure walls) can be used. 

74
Microstrip Lines II: Fullwave Analyses, Design Considerations, and Applications 
This permits the analysis of structures of realistic dimensions without prohibitively 
large computer storage requirements.
The derivation of a variational expression suitable for finite difference equa-
tions proceeds from a general variational formulation for an inhomogeneously 
filled structure. The general expression is obtained directly from Maxwell’s curl 
equations [14] and can be written in terms of the longitudinal field components as

where f0, f1 … represent values of potential ye or yh at points 0, 1, … . Using 
approximations described by (2.70) and (2.71), it is possible to arrive at an ap-
proximation for the contribution from the elementary triangular region of Figure 
2.5 to the integral of (2.69). The surface integral J of (2.69) is then computed as

band structure matrix. The solution of such a matrix may be found by the follow-
ing three steps: (i) [A] is reduced to a tridiagonal form [15]; (ii) the eigenvalues 
of the tridiagonal matrix are found by the method of bisection [16]; and (iii) the

eigenvector associated with a specific eigenvalue is found by the method of inverse 
iterations [17]. References [15–17] give details of these three steps.
A disadvantage of the finite difference method is the large size of the matrix to 
be handled and the resulting computer storage requirement.
Equation (2.69) can also be solved by the finite element method in place of 
the finite difference method discussed above. Corr and Davies [12] have tried this 
technique and found that there are no advantages to be gained by using the finite 
element method.
2.3.3  Discussion of Results
Methods for fullwave analysis of a microstrip provide information about two as-
pects of wave propagation along the microstrip, namely, dispersion and higher 
order modes. The principal features of these results are discussed in this section.
Dispersion
Information regarding the dispersive nature of propagation in a microstrip can be 
expressed in different ways. Figures 2.6 and 2.7 indicate two ways of represent-
ing dispersion. In Figure 2.6, the frequency is plotted against the phase constant b 
leading to the traditional w-b diagram. This figure also includes a w-b curve based 
on a quasi-static analysis (which is a straight line). Results of the fullwave analysis 
based on two different methods are shown. These two curves are not straight but 
lie between the two straight lines, one corresponding to a quasi-static analysis and 
the other for a homogeneously filled line. At lower frequencies (less than 5 GHz) 
results given by both methods coincide with the quasi-static results.
Figure 2.7 presents the same results in a different manner. Here the normal-
ized guide wavelength lm/l0 is plotted as a function of frequency. Two different 
methods (the integral equation method and the singular integral equation method 
[8]) are compared. Experimental results for an open microstrip are also included. 
Figure 2.5  A typical region within the finite difference mesh.

It is observed that lm/l0 decreases with an increase in frequency and tends to 1 εr. 
It implies that at higher frequencies more and more energy propagates inside the 
substrate and below the strip.

Higher Order Modes
Plotting the w-b diagram for higher order modes requires considerable computa-
tion time. Thus only limited results are available.
The singular integral equation method has been used to investigate higher or-
der modes [8]. The results for a substrate of dielectric constant 8.875 (alumina) 
are shown in Figure 2.8. Similar results are available [8] for three other dielectric 
constant values (2.62, 4.2, and 20.0). The existence of a number of higher order 
modes is evident in these plots. It should be noted that this mode spectrum is not 
complete since only the Ez even – Hz odd type of modes are shown. Comparison 
with similar curves for other values of er indicates that the frequency at which the 
first higher order mode begins to appear is lower for higher values of er.
Dispersion curves for higher order modes have also been calculated by Corr 
and Davies [12] using the finite difference method discussed earlier. Their results 
are presented in Figure 2.9(b) for the microstrip configuration shown in Figure 
2.9(a). This plot includes Ez odd – Hz even type of modes also. It is seen that the 
dispersion curves tend to group in pairs of Ez even and Ez odd modes of the same 
order. The difference between the static limiting value of ere for the lowest mode 
and the TEM value is attributed entirely to discretization errors in the finite differ-
ence method.
Higher order microstrip modes have been compared with LSM and LSE modes 
of the slab line structure formed by the removal of the microstrip conductor [12]. 
A very close similarity between the power density distributions of Ez odd and LSM 
modes is noted. Also higher order Ez even and Ez odd modes have very similar 
power density distributions. It is concluded that because the plane of symmetry 
makes so little difference to the higher order modes with the same subscript, these 
modes are strongly associated not with the strip but with the dielectric-air inter-
face. In view of their close similarity to the LSM modes, they can be considered as 
distorted LSM modes. The specific type of mode correspondences may be grouped 
together. Using the notation E for Ez even and M for Ez odd modes, it can be said 
that modes E1, M1 and LSM12 are similar; modes E2, M2, and LSM14 are similar; 
and so on. Thus, for an enclosed microstrip, the approximate cut-off frequency for 
higher order modes may be obtained from the cut-off frequency of LSM modes.
Considerable information about higher order modes can also be obtained from 
the planar waveguide model for a microstrip as discussed in Chapter 1. Cutoff fre-
quencies and guide wavelengths for various modes are given by (1.85) and (1.86), 
respectively.

Design Considerations
In this section various important design parameters of microstrip lines are dis-
cussed. These include attenuation constant, power handling capability, effect of 
tolerances, and dielectric anisotropy. Various expressions, useful for microstrip de-
sign, are summarized in the last subsection.

2.4.1  Microstrip Losses
Attenuation in a microstrip line is caused by two loss components: conductor loss 
and dielectric loss. If a magnetic substrate is used, a magnetic loss component will 
also be present. We will discuss losses for nonmagnetic substrates in this subsection.
Conductor Loss
A comprehensive treatment of conductor loss in a microstrip structure is given by 
Pucel et al. [18] and by Schneider [19]. Both of these analyses are based on the 
“incremental inductance rule” of Wheeler [20]. In this method the series surface 
resistance R per unit length is expressed in terms of that part of the total induct-
ance per unit length that is attributable to the skin effect, that is, the inductance Li 
produced by the magnetic field within the conductors.
It is well known that for a conductor the surface impedance, Zs(=R + jX), has 
a real part R (surface resistance per unit length) that is equal to the imaginary part 
X. That is,

R = X = ωLi 	
(2.72)
According to Wheeler, Li can be found from the external inductance L per unit 
length. Li is obtained as the incremental increase in L caused by an incremental re-
cession of all metallic walls due to the skin effect. This situation is shown in Figure 
2.10. The amount of recession is equal to half the skin depth d = (2/wmsc)l/2. An 
assumption underlying this rule is that the radius of curvature and the thickness

depth, preferably several skin depths. According to Wheeler [20], we have

Wheeler’s incremental inductance rule requires the thickness of the conductors 
to be greater than about four times the skin depth. The effect of using smaller thick-
nesses has also been reported [21–23]. It is observed that the conductor losses are 
reduced by about 9 percent when the conductor thickness is p/2 times the skin depth.

ductance rule."

An expression for the attenuation constant based on (2.76) is presented later in 
Section 2.4.5 where all other design information is also summarized.
Dielectric Loss

geometry of the line and may be written as

(2.78)
where g is the shunt conductance per unit length of the line, e′ is the real part, and 
e″ is the imaginary part of the permittivity of the dielectric. However, when the di-
electric is not uniform over the cross section of the line, the above expression does 
not apply. Calculation of the loss for the mixed dielectric case has been considered 
by Welch and Pratt [21] and by Schneider [24]. In both of these analyses, an effec-
tive loss tangent (tan d)e is derived. The results obtained in these two analyses can 
be shown to be identical when the difference in the definition of filling factor q in 
the two cases is taken into account.
When the upper dielectric (air) is assumed to be lossless, the following expres-
sion for ad (attenuation constant considering mixed dielectrics) is obtained [21]

For microstrip lines on alumina substrate the dielectric loss ad is negligible com-
pared to the total loss a. But for microstrip lines utilizing semiconductor substrates 
such as Si, the dielectric loss factor is dominant. For example, a 50-Ω line on a 
silicon substrate (er = 11.7) with a resistivity of 103-Ωcm has a dielectric loss on the 
order of 0.36 dB/cm while the conductor loss is about 0.19 dB/cm [21]. For these 
substrates the dielectric conductivity s is nonzero. In this case, (2.81) can be used 
with some modification; the final expression is given [21] as

Equations (2.81) and (2.82) give a value of ad, which is about 1 percent higher 
than that predicted by the numerical method of Simpson and Tseng [25]. Values of 
the conductor and the dielectric losses per unit length in 50-Ω microstrip lines on 
various substrates have been calculated using results given in [26] and are shown in 
Figure 2.11 as function of frequency. Attenuation for lines on quartz substrate has 
been discussed by Van Reuven [27].
2.4.2  Power Handling Capability [28]
There is a widespread impression that microstrip lines are suitable only for low-
power components. Although microstrip lines are not as well suited for high-power 
applications as are waveguides or coaxial lines of comparable cross section, they 
could certainly be used for several medium-power applications. A 50-Ω microstrip 
on a 25-mil-thick alumina substrate can handle a few kilowatts of power.
The power handling capacity of a microstrip, like that of any other dielectric 
filled transmission line, is limited by heating caused because of ohmic and dielectric 
losses and by dielectric breakdown. An increase in temperature due to conduc-
tor and dielectric losses limits the average power of the microstrip line, while the 
breakdown between the strip conductor and ground plane limits the peak power.
Average Power
The average power handling capability (APHC) of a microstrip is determined by 
the temperature rise of the strip conductor and the supporting substrate. The pa-
rameters that play major roles in the calculation of average power capability are: (i) 
transmission line losses; (ii) thermal conductivity of the substrate material; (iii) sur-
face area of the strip conductor; and (iv) ambient temperature; that is, temperature 
of the medium surrounding the microstrip. Therefore, dielectric substrates with 
low-loss tangent and large thermal conductivity will increase the average power 
handling capability of microstrip lines.

The temperature rise of the strip conductor can be calculated from the heat 
flow field in the cross section. An analogy between the heat flow field and the elec-
tric field is described in Table 2.1. The heat generated by the conductor loss and the 
dielectric loss is discussed separately in the following paragraphs.
Density of Heat Flow Due to Conductor Loss
A loss of electromagnetic power in the strip conductor generates heat in the strip. 
Because of the good heat conductivity of the strip metal, heat generation is uniform

along the width of the conductor. Since the ground plane is held at ambient tem-
perature (i.e., acts as a heat sink), this heat flows from the strip conductor to the 
ground plane through the substrate. The heat flow can be calculated by consider-
ing the analogous electric field distribution. The heat flow field in the microstrip 
structure corresponds to the electrostatic field (without any dispersion) of the mi-
crostrip. From Figure 1.4 we note that the electric field lines (the thermal field in 
the case of heat flow) spread near the ground plane.
To account for the increase in area normal to heat flow lines, the parallel plate 
model of a microstrip is used. For these calculations er (in electrical analog) is as-
sumed to be equal to the ratio of the thermal conductivity of the substrate (Table 
2.2) to that of the air. The equivalent width of the strip (We) in the parallel plate 
model is calculated from the electrical analog as

er replaced by Kd/Ka (the ratio of thermal conductivity of the dielectric to that of 
the air). When the impedance of a microstrip with air as the dielectric is written as

Density of Heat Flow Due to Dielectric Loss
In addition to the conductor loss, heat is generated by dielectric loss in the sub-
strate. The density of the heat generated is proportional to the square of the electric 
field. However, we can consider a parallel plate model wherein the electric field is 
uniform and the density of the heat generated can also be considered uniform. This 
assumption ignores the increased dielectric loss in regions of high electric field near 
the strip edges. However, since the dielectric loss is a small fraction of the total loss 
(except for semiconductor substrates like Si), the above assumption should hold. 
The effective width for this parallel plate model depends on the spread of electric 
field lines and is a function of frequency. The effective width, Weff(f), is given by 
[29, 30]
	
Weff(f) = W + Weff(0) - W
1 + (f /fp)2 	
(2.87)
where
	
fp = Z0m
2µ0h
and Weff(0) is equal to We of (2.84). m0 is the permeability of free space, ere is the 
static value of the effective dielectric constant [31], and Z0m is the characteristic 
impedance of the microstrip (in ohms).
The heat flow in the y-direction caused by a sheet of heat sources can be evalu-
ated by considering the configuration in Figure 2.12.
The heat conducted away by air is negligible, and the air-dielectric boundary 
can be considered as an insulating wall (corresponding to a magnetic wall in the 
electric analog). Therefore, the configuration is modified by removing the insulat-
ing wall and incorporating an image source of heat and an image of the ground 
plane as shown. The space between the two ground planes is filled homogeneously 
by the dielectric medium. Now the heat flow at a point A is obtained by applying 
the divergence theorem (for heat flow field) to the volume shown by the dotted 
lines, that is,

where s is the enclosed area. The total qd at y = y1 is contributed by the heat source 
lying between y = y1 and y = h (and their images). It may be noted that sources lo-
cated at y < y1 (and their images) do not contribute to the heat flow at y = y1. Thus,

This relation is used for calculating the average power handling capability of the

The properties of various substrates are given in Table 2.2. Strip conductors, 
except in the case of polystyrene substrates, are of gold (t = 0.01 mm) while in the 
case of polystyrene substrates copper (t = 0.035 mm) is used. Conductor loss in 
the ground plane does not contribute to APHC limitation. However, as the ground 
plane loss is very small compared to the strip loss [32], formulas for the total loss 
could be used to calculate APHC. Results shown in Figure 2.13 for variations of 
∆T with frequency are based on this assumption. The following interesting ob-
servations are noted from this figure. (i) The temperature rise ∆T increases with 
frequency. (ii) The beryllium oxide (BeO) substrate has a smaller temperature rise 
due to its higher value of thermal conductivity. Alumina and sapphire have near-
ly the same ∆T variation, although alumina has about 25 percent lower thermal 
conductivity compared to sapphire. This is due to the fact that sapphire line has 

Microstrip Lines and Slotlines
87
slightly more loss due to a higher dielectric constant. Also We and Weff in the case 
of sapphire are smaller. Therefore, the combined effect of these parameters on ∆T 
is almost equal in sapphire and alumina. (iii) We note that for frequencies less than 
2.6 GHz, ∆T for Si (1000 Ωcm) is larger than that for GaAs (107 Ωcm). At 2.6 GHz 
the two ∆T’s are equal, and for frequencies above 2.6 GHz ∆T is smaller for Si. (iv) 
Plastic substrates (polystyrene etc.) have higher values of ∆T due to poor thermal 
conductivity, although the losses are smaller (Figure 2.11).
It may be pointed out that the effects of any thermal resistance barriers that 
may exist between the bonding of the strip and the microstrip dielectric, between 
the microstrip dielectric and the ground plane, and between the ground plane and 
any heat sink have not been taken into account in this analysis. This effect can limit 
the average power handling capability of microstrip lines.

where ∆T denotes rise in temperature per watt and Tmax is the maximum operat-
ing temperature. For polystyrene, the maximum operating temperature is 100°C, 
whereas for the rest of the dielectrics (in Table 2.2) it is much more than 100°C. The 
maximum operating temperature of microstrip circuits is limited due to (i) change 
of substrate properties with temperature, (ii) change of physical dimensions with 
temperature, and (iii) connectors. One can assume the maximum operating tem-
perature of microstrip circuits to be the one where its electrical and physical char-
acteristics remain unchanged. Circuits on alumina and glass fiber-reinforced teflon 
substrates have been tested up to 150°C for about 2000 hours. It has been found 
[33] that the electrical and physical characteristics remain unchanged.
For Tmax = 100°C, Tamb = 25°C, and Z0m = 50 Ω, values of APHC for various 
substrates at 2 GHz, 10 GHz, and 20 GHz are calculated and given in Table 2.3. 
Among the dielectrics considered, APHC is the lowest for polystyrene and it is 
maximum for BeO. At lower frequencies, GaAs microstrip lines have better APHC 
than Si microstrip lines, but at higher frequencies (>2.6 GHz) APHC is better in the 
case of Si. For commonly used alumina (or sapphire) substrates, a 50-Ω microstrip 
can carry about 5.14 kW of CW power at 10 GHz.
The APHC analysis presented above has been extended to multilayer micro-
strip lines [34–36]. As a first-order approximation for a two-layered microstrip 
configuration, the heat flow from the microstrip conductor was considered to fol-
low the rule of 45° thermal spread angle. Table 2.4 shows the APHC values of sev-
eral multilayer 50-Ω microstrip lines on 75-mm thick GaAs at several frequencies. 
The APHC decreases with increasing frequency.
Peak Power Handling Capability
The calculation of peak power handling capability of microstrip lines is more com-
plicated. The peak voltage that can be applied without causing dielectric break-
down determines the peak power handling capability (PPHC) of the microstrip. If 
Z0m is the characteristic impedance of the microstrip and V0 is the maximum volt-
age the line can withstand, the maximum peak power is given by
	
Pp =
V0
2
2Z0m 	
(2.96)
Thick substrates can support higher voltages (for the same breakdown field). 
Therefore, low impedance lines and lines on thick substrates have higher peak 
power handling capability.

Microstrip Lines and Slotlines

The sharp edges of the strip conductor serve as field concentrators. The electric 
field tends to a large value at the sharp edges of the conductor if it is a flat strip and 
decreases as the edge of the conductor is rounded off more and more. Therefore, 
thick and rounded strip conductors will increase breakdown voltage.
The dielectric strengths of the substrate material as well as of the air play im-
portant roles. The breakdown strength of dry air is approximately 30 kV/ cm. Thus 
the maximum (tangential) electric field near the strip edge should be less than 30 
kV/ cm. To avoid air breakdown near the strip edge, the edge of the strip conductor 
can be painted with a dielectric paint that has the same dielectric constant as that 
of the substrate and is lossless. The dielectric strength of various dielectrics is also 
given in Table 2.2. This table shows that, among the dielectrics considered, fused 
quartz has the maximum dielectric strength while polystyrene has the minimum. 
In some cases connectors or launchers decide the PPHC of the microstrip line. 
The 3-mm subminiature connectors and their transitions will breakdown before 
the line [37] itself. N-type connectors and transitions have higher PPHC. An addi-
tional factor, which may reduce PPHC, is the effect of internal mismatches. Experi-
mental data for PPHC are not readily available. Howe [37] has reported successful 
operation of microstrip lines up to 10 kW at S-band and 4 kW at X-band.
2.4.3  Effect of Tolerances [38]
Characteristics of microstrip lines (namely, Z0m and ere) are primarily functions 
of strip width W and substrate parameters er and h. These are also influenced by 
factors such as strip thickness, frequency of operation (dispersion), and size of en-
closure. Any changes in the values of W, er or h give rise to corresponding changes 
in Z0m and ere.
Substrate properties, like surface finish, metallization thickness, and the fabri-
cation process, determine the accuracy of fabrication of the strip width. In addi-
tion to the error in fabrication of the strip width, the thickness and the dielectric 
constant of the substrate have some manufacturing tolerances. All these factors 
contribute to variations in Z0m and ere of the microstrip. Since it is very difficult to 
incorporate arrangements for post-fabrication adjustments in MICs, it is necessary 
to take into account the effect of tolerances at the design stage itself. However, un-
like the effects of deterministic parameters like dispersion and strip thickness, the 
effect of tolerances cannot be incorporated exactly because of the uncertainty in 
Z0m and ere arising from tolerances.
The effect of tolerances on the performance of a microstrip can be analyzed 
using the sensitivity approach. This approach is the easiest method of predicting

the worst case behavior corresponding to a given set of tolerances. It does not re-
quire the actual statistical distribution of tolerances. Only their maximum absolute 
values are needed. Sensitivity analysis is useful in situations where deviations in pa-
rameters can be considered incremental. This implies that the circuit characteristics 
should be slowly varying functions in the domain of parameter variation around 
the exact parameter values.
It has been observed that the maximum change in the characteristics of a mi-
crostrip due to tolerances can be evaluated using the equations

(2.99)
The influence of tolerances can be reduced by using improved fabrication tech-
niques and using substrates with better tolerances. The required fabrication accu-
racy for the strip width will be a function of the specified accuracy in transmission 
line characteristics and given tolerances in substrate parameters.
It can be determined from the equations

The required fabrication accuracy for the strip width is the minimum of the two 
values of ∆W obtained from the above equations. The fabrication accuracy of h or 
tolerance in er can be determined in a similar manner provided that the tolerances 
for the other two parameters are known.
Expressions for the sensitivity of microstrip characteristics (Z0m and ere) with 
respect to various parameters (for example, W, h, and er) can be calculated using 
the closed-form expressions for Z0m and ere given by Schneider [19] and the defini-
tion of sensitivity given in (2.99). Various sensitivities may thus be written as

The sensitivity curves for impedance and effective dielectric constants are shown in 
Figure 2.14 and Figure 2.15, respectively, for er = 9.7.
The sensitivity values thus obtained are used in (2.97) to determine the maxi-
mum change in Z0m. From (∆Z0m)max the maximum value of VSWR is obtained 
using the relation

It may be observed from (2.97) that there is a tradeoff between tolerances; that is, 
the tolerance value for one parameter can be increased or decreased at the cost of 
other parameters. This helps in the optimum use of fabrication technologies.
The effect of tolerances on the characteristics of a microstrip has been com-
pared with the effects of finite thickness of metal strip, dispersion, discontinuity, 
and an imperfect measurement system and is detailed later in Section 2.4.5.
2.4.4  Effect of Dielectric Anisotropy
Some of the dielectric substrates used for microstrip circuits exhibit anisotropy 
in permittivity. The most common examples are sapphire (especially when single 
crystal) and Epsilam-10 (trade name for a ceramic-loaded resin). In both these 
cases, the substrates are manufactured such that one of the principal axes of the 
permittivity tensor is perpendicular to the dielectric interface y = h. If there were 
no fringing electric fields (in microstrip configuration), all the field lines would co-
incide with this axis, and the capacitance is determined by the value of permittivity 
in this direction. In such a case there is no effect of anisotropy.
If the line parameters are to be independent of line orientation in the xz-plane, 
the permittivity tensor in the x- and z-directions must be equal. For sapphire we 
take ex = ez = 11.6 and ey = 9.4, whereas for Epsilam-10 ex = ez = 15.0 and ey = 10.0.
Quasi-static analysis of a microstrip on anisotropic substrates has been carried 
out by using the finite difference method [39] and also by using a transformation 

92
Microstrip Lines II: Fullwave Analyses, Design Considerations, and Applications 
[40] that enables the capacitance for anisotropic substrates to be derived from mi-
crostrip formulas for isotropic substrates.
Finite Difference Method [39]
This method is a straightforward solution of the Laplace equation by finite differ-
ence techniques. When the dielectric is anisotropic, the Laplace equation may be 
written
	
εx
∂2φ x,y
(
)
∂x2
+ εy
∂2φ x,y
(
)
∂y2
= 0 	
(2.108)
In finite difference form this may be written as follows for all net points in the di-
electric material (see Figure 1.9)
	
εx(φB + φA) +εy(φD + φC) - 2(εx + εy)φp = 0 	
(2.109)
and when the point P lies on the dielectric-air interface
	
1
2(1 + εx)(φB + φA) + φD + εyφC - (2 + εx + εy)φp = 0 	
(2.110)
The rest of the procedure for evaluating capacitances is the same as outlined in 
Section 1.2.2.

Transform Method [40]
A simple, but rigorous transformation that converts the anisotropic electrostatic 
field into an isotropic one with similar shape has been reported by Szentkuti [40]. 
This transformation may be described as follows.
For the substrate (y ≤ h) let
	
x = x, y = y ( εx ⁄εy ) that is, h = h ( εx ⁄εy ) 	
(2.111)
	
εr =εx = εy =
εxεy
(
) 	
(2.112)
Potentials and their derivatives at the original and transformed points (P and P) are 
related by
	
φp = φp

∂φp ⁄ ∂y =
εx ⁄ εy
∂φp ⁄ ∂y

Microstrip Lines II: Fullwave Analyses, Design Considerations, and Applications 
Expressing (2.108) in terms of x and y leads to an isotropic Laplace equation for 
f(x, y). Also
	
Ex = - ∂φ ⁄ ∂x = Ex
Dy = -εrε0 ∂φ / ∂y = Dy 	
(2.115)
Thus we note that: (i) values of the tangential component of E and the normal com-
ponent of flux at the interface y = h are not affected by the transformation, (ii) all 
potential and charges are not altered within the region y ≤ h, and (iii) the potential 
of the transformed ground plane is conserved. Therefore, capacitances of the origi-
nal anisotropic and the transformed isotropic structures are equal.
Effective dielectric constants for anisotropic substrates are compared with the 
corresponding values for isotropic substrates (er = ey) as a function of W/h in Figure 
2.16. We note that considerable difference exists for thin lines (small W/h), whereas 
the two results tend to identical values as W/h increases. This can be explained by 
noting that the fringing field values are larger for narrow strips, and it is only the 
Ex component of the fringing field that is affected by ex.
2.4.5  Design Equations
The numerical methods for the characterization of microstrip lines discussed so 
far involve extensive computations. Closed-form expressions are necessary for the 
optimization and computer-aided-design of microstrip circuits. A complete set of 
design equations for a microstrip is presented in this section. This includes closed

neider [19], and Hammerstad [42]. Wheeler and Hammerstad have also given syn-

The effect of strip thickness on Z0m and ere of microstrip lines has been reported by 
a number of investigators [19, 31, 41, 44–54]. Simple and accurate formulas for

It can be observed that the effect of thickness on Z0m and ere is insignificant for 
small values of t/h. This agrees with the experimental results reported in [45] for 
t/h ≤ 0.005, 2 ≤ er ≤ 10, and W/h ≥ 0.1. However, the effect of strip thickness is 
significant on conductor loss in the microstrip line.
Effect of Enclosure
Most microstrip circuit applications require a metallic enclosure for hermetic seal-
ing, mechanical strength, electromagnetic shielding, mounting connectors, and ease 
of handling. The effect of the top cover alone [55–57] as well as of the top cover 
and side walls [51, 58] has been reported in the literature. Both the top cover and 
side walls tend to lower impedance and effective dielectric constant. This is because 
the fringing flux lines are prematurely terminated on the enclosure walls. This in-
creases the electric flux in air. The closed-form equations for a microstrip with top 
cover (without side walls) are obtained as [56, 57]

and a(u) and b(er) are obtained from (2.122).
Using the preceding equations, the characteristic impedance of the shielded 
microstrip can be calculated from Z0m =  Za
0m/ εre.
For the range of parameters, 1 ≤ er ≤ 30, 0.05 ≤ W/h ≤ 20, t/h ≤ 0.1, and 1 < h′/h 
< ∞, the maximum error in Z0m and ere is found to be less than ±1 percent.
When h′/h ≥ 5, the effect of the top cover on the microstrip characteristics be-
comes negligible.
Effect of Dispersion
The effect of frequency (dispersion) on ere has been described, accurately by the disper-
sion models given by Getsinger [59], Edwards and Owens [60], Kirschning and Jansen 
[61], and Kobayashi [62], as discussed in Section 1.3. The effect of frequency on Z0m 
has been described by several investigators [3, 29, 30, 44, 63]. The accurate expressions

Effect of Surface-Roughness of Conductor on Loss
In general, the metallization on the substrate is not smooth and may result in in-
creased conductor loss. The undulations or roughness of metal surface depends on 
the roughness of the substrate and the technique used to metallize the substrate. 
The rough metal surface can be modeled as a surface with triangular grooves, with 
groove depth varying randomly, and can be characterized by rms depth. The cur-
rent flowing across the grooves will therefore travel a larger distance compared to 
the smooth surface, resulting in an increased conductor loss. When the rms depths 
are small compared with the skin depth, the surface finish of conductors has lit-

100
Microstrip Lines II: Fullwave Analyses, Design Considerations, and Applications 
tle effect on the conductor loss. If the rms depth has dimensions comparable with 
the skin depth, the additional loss becomes significant depending on the direction 
of roughness (grooves). The adverse effect on the loss of grooves parallel to the 
conductor current is much less than that produced by transverse grooves of similar 
size. The surface roughness of the conductor equivalently increases the surface re-
sistance beyond the intrinsic value obtained for optimally flat and pure conductor 
surfaces. The effect of surface roughness on the conductor loss may easily be calcu-
lated by replacing RS in (2.133) with Rs
s, which is given below [18]:

(2.135)
where d is the skin depth and ∆ is the rms surface roughness. Since, at millimeter 
wavelengths, the skin depth is only a few tenths of a micron, the surface roughness 
must be preserved at less than 0.1 mm in order to keep conductor loss low in the 
microstrip.
The dielectric loss is normally very small compared with the conductor loss for 
dielectric substrates. The dielectric loss in silicon substrates (used for RFICs), how-
ever, is usually of the same order or even larger than the conductor loss. This is be-
cause of the lower resistivity available in silicon wafers. However, higher resistivity 
can be obtained in GaAs, and therefore the dielectric loss is lower for this material. 
Values of conductor and dielectric losses per unit length for 50-Ω microstrip lines 
on various substrates (dielectric as well as semiconductor) are plotted in Figure 
2.11 (in Section 2.4.1) as functions of frequency. At a given frequency the total loss 
can be obtained by adding the two values.
Figure 2.17 compares the total loss for 50-Ω microstrip lines on RT/duroid, 
quartz, and alumina substrates. At the same h/l0 ratio, high dielectric constant 
substrates result in greater loss.
Microstrip loss data presented above require that the conductor thickness be 
greater than about four times the skin depth. The microstrip conductor loss calcu-
lation for any metalization thickness has been reported by Lee and Itoh [65] based 
on the phenomenological loss equivalence method and by Faraji-Dana and Chow 
[66, 67] based on ac resistance. Faraji-Dana and Chow’s calculated conductor loss 
data for thick conductors agree very well with the calculated results obtained using 
expressions reported by Pucel et al. [18]. Aksun and Morkoc [68] have reported 
dielectric loss results for microstrip substrates. consisting of different GaAs layer 
thicknesses on an Si substrate.
In order to reduce insertion loss in the microstrip matching networks, a ridged 
microstrip structure, as shown in Figure 2.18, has been used [69]. In this structure, 
the strip conductor is fabricated on a thin polyimide dielectric (erd = 3.2) layer, 
which is placed on top of the GaAs substrate. The electric flux lines in this case 
are more in the air, and the structure resembles a suspended microstrip line, which 
has much lower insertion loss than the conventional microstrip. The loss has been 
reported to be reduced by a factor of two [69] by placing 14-mm thick polyimide 
between the conductor and the 125-mm thick GaAs substrate.

[70]
	
QT =

(2.136)
where QT is the total Q of the resonator (quarter wavelength), aT is the total loss in 
the resonator, and b = 2p/lm. When losses in a resonant line are considered, another 
loss factor, ar due to radiation at the open-end discontinuities must also be taken 
into account [70, 71]. The corresponding radiation Q-factor is given by [70]

The variation with frequency of Q0, Qr, and QT for a quarter-wave resonator on 
GaAs, alumina, and quartz substrates is shown in Figure 2.19. A quarter-wave 
50-Ω resonator on a 25-mil-thick alumina substrate has a Q0 of about 240 at 
2.0 GHz and 550 at 10.0 GHz, whereas QT is 230 at 2.0 GHz and nearly 160 at 
10.0 GHz. This is due to the fact that the radiation losses are higher than conduc-
tor and dielectric losses at higher frequencies. On the other hand, a quarter-wave 
50-Ω resonator on a 10-mil GaAs substrate has Q0 of about 82 at 2.0 GHz and 
160 at 10.0 GHz, whereas QT is 82 at 2.0 GHz and nearly 145 at 10.0 GHz. This 
is explained by smaller radiation losses for thin substrates. Thus, the commonly ac-
cepted rule that thick substrates should be used for high Q circuits does not apply 
to microstrip lines because of high radiation losses incurred under this condition.
The variation, with substrate thickness, of the total Q for half-wave resona-
tors on RT/duroid, quartz, and alumina is shown in Figure 2.20 for f = 30 GHz, 
50 GHz, and 100 GHz. For a given frequency, there is an optimum substrate thick-
ness at which the Q is maximum. This optimum value of h decreases with increas-
ing frequency and decreasing dielectric constant value, mainly because of radiation.

Comparison of Various Factors Affecting Microstrip Characteristics
The effect of tolerances on the characteristics of a microstrip has been compared in 
[72] with the effects of finite thickness of a metal strip, dispersion, discontinuities, 
and an imperfect measurement system. These are included here as Tables 2.5 and 
2.6 for a 50-Ω microstrip on alumina and polystyrene substrates, respectively.
It may be observed from the tables that the change in Z0m is relatively higher 
due to the dimensional tolerances and the imperfect measurement system. For a mi-
crostrip on polystyrene substrate, the change in characteristics due to dimensional 
tolerances dominates the change due to other factors. However, at 10 GHz and for 
microstrip on alumina substrate, dispersion gives rise to the largest change in ere.
2.4.6  Frequency Range of Operation
The maximum frequency of operation of a microstrip is limited due to several fac-
tors such as excitation of spurious modes, higher losses, pronounced discontinuity 
effects, low Q due to radiation from discontinuities, effect of dispersion on pulse

distortion, tight fabrication tolerances, handling fragility, and, of course, techno-
logical processes. The frequency at which significant coupling occurs between the 
quasi-TEM mode and the lowest order surface wave spurious mode is given below 
[73].

where fT is in gigahertz and h is in millimeters. Thus the maximum thickness of the 
quartz substrate (er ≅ 3.8) for microstrip circuits designed at 100 GHz is less than 
0.5 mm. The inverse tangent is expressed in radians.

The excitation of higher order modes in a microstrip can be avoided by 
operating it below the cut-off frequency of the first higher order mode, which is 
given approximately by [73].
	
fc ≅

εr (2W + 0.8h)
	
(2.141)
where fc is in gigahertz and W and h are in millimeters. This limitation is mostly ap-
plicable to low impedance lines that have wide microstrip conductors and/or thick 
substrates commonly used for microstrip patch antenna elements.
An infinitely long microstrip does not radiate as there is no coupling between 
the dominant mode and the higher order radiating modes. However, whenever 
there is some discontinuity in the line, namely an open end, slit, step in width, 
bend, or a gap, higher order radiating modes are excited, which depend upon the 
substrate thickness and frequency of operation. The operating frequency at which 
the radiation becomes significant may be calculated from the radiation Q factor of 
a l/2 resonator, approximately given by

32ηh2
	
(2.142)
where η = 120p. Thus for thicker substrates, where Q ≅ Qr, the variation of Q is 
proportional to 1/(fh)2. For example, a 50-Ω resonator on a quartz substrate has a 
Qr ≅ 0.4252 × 104/(fh)2 where f is in gigahertz and h is in millimeters. At 100 GHz, 
the substrate thickness is less than 0.065 mm for Qr greater than 100. A substrate 
thickness of this order results in attenuation on the order of 1 dB/cm. Thus not only 
do thin substrates give rise to high losses, but they are also difficult to handle and 
result in narrow conducting strips. Fabrication tolerances and technological pro-
cesses such as photoetching limit the minimum strip width and the spacing between 
two adjacent strips in the case of coupled lines. High impedance lines of about 
120 Ω require strip widths on the order of 0.02 mm on a 0.065-mm thick quartz 
substrate, thereby also setting a limit on the frequency of operation of microstrip 
lines because of low radiation Qr.
On a microstrip, phase and group velocities are frequency dependent. There-
fore, a digital pulse signal is distorted due to different velocities of the signals’ 
frequency components. To minimize distortion, the dispersion effects must be mini-
mized by keeping the fh product as small as possible.
2.4.7  Lumped Element Model of Microstrip Interconnect
Microstrip lines are integral parts of packaging and interconnect for high-speed 
electronics. In order to increase the transmission bandwidth of sub-nanosecond 
digital signals and enhance the simulation efficiency, a lumped element model of 
microstrip is needed. The lumped element equivalent-circuit model (unit cell) of a 
microstrip interconnect is shown in Figure 2.21. The equivalent-circuit parameters 
consist of series resistance (R), series inductance (L), shunt capacitance (C), and 
shunt conductance (G), all defined per unit length of the line. For the lumped ele-
ment analysis of a distributed line, the line length l is divided into small sections of 
length Dl  l. The distributed parameters, characteristic impedance Z0m and the 
propagation constant of the microstrip line, are related to the lumped parameters 
as 
	
Z0m =
R + jωL
G + jωC
	
(2.143a)
	
γ =
R + jωL
(
) G + jωC
(
) = α + jβ 	
(2.143b)
where a and b are the attenuation and phase constants, respectively.
Various methods [74–81] have been used to determine the lumped element 
model parameters of microstrip lines. They are based on empirical methods, meas-
ured S-parameters, quasi-static techniques, and full-wave methods.
In the empirical approach, one can extract the LE model parameters, such as 
inductance and capacitance, using closed form expressions given in Section 2.4.5 
as follows:

Microstrip Lines II: Fullwave Analyses, Design Considerations, and Applications 
The equivalent-circuit model parameters were also obtained by using quasi-
static analysis of a microstrip line [78]. Closed form expressions for frequency-
dependent resistance and inductance of microstrip were derived. The variations 
of resistance and inductance per unit length of a microstrip are shown in Figure 
2.22. The line parameters are W = 0.2 mm, h = 0.1 mm, t = 10 mm, ground plane 
width = 2 mm, er = 4, and copper conductors (s = 56 MS/m). The dc resistance 
and inductance values of the line are 0.0982 Ω/cm and 4.392 nH/cm, respectively. 
These values become 0.1462 Ω/cm and 3.001 nH/cm at 100 MHz. Above 1 GHz, 
the resistance increases as f  and the inductance becomes constant with frequency.

2.5  Other Types of Microstrip Lines
There are several derivatives of microstrip lines being used in ICs. These include 
inverted and suspended microstrip lines, a multilayered microstrip, a thin film mi-
crostrip, and valley microstrip. These structures are briefly described in this section.
2.5.1  Suspended and inverted microstrip lines
Suspended and inverted microstrip lines (shown in Figure 2.24) provide a higher 
Q (500 to 1500) than the conventional microstrip lines. The wide range of achiev-

2.5.2  Multilayered Dielectric Microstrip
Multilayered dielectric microstrip lines are becoming an integral part of ICs. Sever-
al applications of such structures include circuit passivation or scratch protection, 
high-speed digital circuit crossover interconnects, MMIC crossover interconnects, 
metal-insulator-metal capacitors, high directivity couplers [82, 83], tightly coupled 
structures [84–86], improving pulse characteristic propagation [87], and many oth-
ers. Analysis of multilayered dielectric microstrip lines has been performed using 
quasi-static analyses such as the variational method [88, 89], the potential theory 
method, and full wave spectral domain methods [90, 91].

Figure 2.24  Suspended-substrate microstrip line configurations: (a) suspended and (b) inverted.
Multilayered structures are generally fabricated in MMICs using very thin di-
electric layers of insulating materials such as silicon nitride (er ≅ 6.7) and polyim-
ide (er ≅ 3.0). The dielectric constant of these materials might vary from foundry 
to foundry depending upon the composition used. The characteristic impedance 
and effective dielectric constant of a multilayered structure using polyimide are 
calculated utilizing the variational method, and the results are plotted in Figures 
2.25 and 2.26 for several values of dielectric thicknesses. It may be noted from 
these figures that the lower polyimide dielectric layer has a significant effect on 
these characteristics as compared to that of the upper layer. Figure 2.27 shows the 
calculated capacitance per unit length of a microstrip line for various values of the

lower dielectric layer thickness and fixed value of upper layer thickness. Even thin 
layers of low dielectric constant under the microstrip conductors reduce its capaci-
tance significantly. This feature can be used to reduce the parasitic capacitance of 
a lumped inductor realized in this configuration in order to extend its maximum 
operating frequency to higher values. The effects of uncertainties in the polyimide 
layer’s thickness and dielectric constant values on the effective dielectric constant 
and characterstic impedance are given in Table 2.7.

Figure 2.28 shows the calculated capacitance and inductance per unit length of 
a microstrip as a function of strip width for various values of air thickness under 
the conductor. The capacitance reduces significantly even for small thicknesses, 
while the inductance is almost constant.

2.5.3  Thin Film Microstrip (TFM)
In order to make MMICs compact and low cost, a thin film microstrip (TFM) 
structure has also been used [92–96]. Both active and passive miniature circuits 
have been successfully realized with TFM employing a narrow-width microstrip 
conductor on thin low-dielectric constant materials, fabricated on semi-insulating 
GaAs substrate. As shown in Figure 2.29, a ground plane is placed between a thin 
dielectric layer and the GaAs substrate. The GaAs substrate provides support as

well as a semiconductor medium for active devices. Due to the thin microstrip 
conductors, TFM has relatively high insertion loss as compared to a conventional 
microstrip.
The loss characteristics of a TFM and a conventional microstrip on GaAs are 
compared [92] in Figure 2.30. The metal thickness t of the TFM is assumed to be 
one-third of the thin film thickness (H/3). The thin film dielectric is SiON, having

a dielectric constant value of 5. Three micron-thick conductors were used in the 
calculation of conventional microstrip line characteristics. Loss calculations were 
performed for 50-Ω lines. Figure 2.31 shows measured data obtained at 10 GHz 
for the TFM lines. Here the thin film dielectric is polyimide (erd ≅ 3, H ≅ 3 mm). 
TFM lines can readily be realized to achieve very low characteristic impedances 
3 Ω to 4 Ω, by using microstrip conductor widths on the order of 100 mm, without 
exciting higher order modes. Thus TFM overcomes the low characteristic imped-
ance limit problem of a conventional microstrip and has an important application 
in the design of power amplifier matching networks where very low characteristic 
impedance is required to match very low device input impedance.
Closed form expressions for the characteristic impedance, effective dielectric 
constant, and dispersion of the TFM are reported by Schnieder and Heinrich [97]. 
The expressions have been validated by comparing with the full-wave simulated 
results. Typical errors for the characteristic impedance and phase constant were 
3 percent and 2 percent, respectively. A modification of Wheeler’s incremental in-
ductance rule to calculate conductor loss in a TFM is given by Stracca [98]. The 
conductor loss was calculated by using the proposed method agrees with the avail-
able numerical results.
The lumped element equivalent-circuit model for the TFM has been discussed 
in [97]. The closed form formulas for the equivalent-circuit elements R, L, C, and 
G were provided. First, existing closed form equations for microstrip characteris-
tics were chosen based on their accuracy; then they were modified based on the ex-
tensive data collected using electromagnetic simulations employing full-wave mode 
matching method. This lead to more accurate closed form expressions for the TFM.
2.5.4  Valley Microstrip Lines
Valley microstrip lines have been used to realize low loss and miniature MMIC 
components using multilayer techniques. Figure 2.32 shows cross sections of valley 
microstrip lines with and without slits. These lines have lower insertion loss than 
TFM [99–103]. These structures have been analyzed using quasi-TEM techniques 
[102, 103]. The calculated value of the characteristic impedance of a valley micro-
strip as a function of strip width for several values of slit widths is shown in Figure 
2.33 [101]. The thin film dielectric is polyimide (erd = 3.3), having a thickness of 10 
mm. The insertion loss is about 0.5 dB/mm at 10 GHz.

2.5.5  Buried Microstrip Line
The configuration of a buried microstrip line (BML) is shown in Figure 2.34. In this 
case, the microstrip conductor is placed on a dielectric slab that is surrounded by 
conductor walls. The BML geometry may be considered as a modification of TFM. 
The structure was analyzed using FDTD method. It was found that the cross-talk 
between buried microstrip lines is at much lower levels than the cross-talk between 
the conventional microstrip lines; this is due to the presence of the ground between 
them. In practical circuits, the isolation improvement could be as large as 50–60 
dB [104]. High isolation in BML structure is very desirable for constructing high-
density and millimeter-wave integrated circuits.
2.5.6  Superconducting Microstrip Circuits
Most planar transmission lines are lossy (due to high conductor loss) to varying de-
grees when compared with coaxial lines and waveguides, which precludes their use

for the realization of narrow-band filters and low-loss delay lines. The low surface 
resistance of superconducting materials at microwave frequencies is attractive to 
realize nearly lossless planar passive components. Materials exhibiting supercon-
ducting behavior at temperatures as high as 125K have generated a great deal of 
interest in microwave circuitry for the realization of low-loss passive components. 
The high-temperature superconducting materials are referred to as HTS, and the 
temperature at which the materials exhibit this property is referred to as the transi-
tion temperature, Tc, and is commonly measured in Kelvin (K). The growth of good 
quality HTS films compatible with hybrid and monolithic microwave integrate cir-
cuits has made HTS readily usable. Several HTS materials are listed in Table 2.8.

stable circuit operation, the material should be selected to have a Tc substantially 
higher than the operating temperature. The materials shown in Table 2.8 have a 
Tc higher than liquid nitrogen (77K) and also have larger energy gaps that make 
them usable at liquid nitrogen and at high power levels, respectively. HTS films can 
easily be deposited on low-loss tangent (tan d ≤ 0.0001 at microwave frequencies) 
substrates such as sapphire, silica, MgO, lithium nitrate, and lanthanum aluminate 
(LaAIO3) with good lattice match to realize low-loss HTS microstrip lines. Sap-
phire is one of the most commonly used materials for depositing HTS films. At 
room temperature the dielectric constant along its c-(optic) axis is er11 = 11.6 and 
perpendicular to this axis (z-axis) the dielectric constant is er⊥ = 9.4. The planar 
surface lies in the optic axis called the c-plane. At 77K the values are slighty lower, 
but for a first-order approximation one can still use these values.
Superconductor Technologies [105, 106] have characterized HTS microstrip 
using thin films of thallium barium calcium copper oxide (TlBaCaCuO) grown 
on lanthanum aluminate (LaAlO3) substrate. Typical specifications for such sub-
strates are given in Table 2.9. Figure 2.35 shows the surface resistance measured at 
10 GHz as a function of temperature. The sample used was l-cm2 and was much 
thicker than the penetration depth. Figure 2.36 shows the loaded Q of microstrip 
resonators measured at 5 GHz as a function of input power for 6-mil- and 40-mil-
wide microstrip conductors. The loaded Q for HTS microstrip resonators at small

Lee et al. [113] described fullwave analysis of HTS microstrip lines on anisotropic 
substrates using an equivalent surface impedance approach. A superconducting mi-
crostrip line with a perfectly conducting ground plane on an anisotropic substrate 
for which the optic axis is the (x-y)-plane is shown in Figure 2.37. In this case, 
high-quality YBa2Cu3O7 (YBCO) films have been deposited on m-plane sapphire 
(the angle between the c-plane and the m-plane is 90°). The characteristic imped-
ance, effective dielectric constant, and attenuation constant, calculated using the 
fullwave method for YBCO microstrip lines on a 430-mm-thick m-plane sapphire 
substrate, are shown in Figure 2.38 as a function of the rotation angle of the optic

tion depth of the fields into the superconductor l = 0.323 mm, the real part of 
conductivity s =3.5S/mm, conductor thickness t = 0.4 mm, transition temperature 
Tc = 90K, and operating temperature T = 77K. The characteristic impedance and 
effective dielectric constant values shown in Figure 2.38 for an HTS microstrip 
are very close to the conventional microstrip results on a sapphire substrate. Thus

approximate expressions for the microstrip on an anisotropic substrate in Section 
2.4.4 may be used to calculate HTS microstrip characteristics.
Microwave circuits, including filters, delay lines, resonators, dividers, combin-
ers, and Lange couplers, have been developed using an HTS microstrip [105, 114–
122]. Specific applications of HTS microstrip lines include narrow-band filters, 
low-loss delay lines, high Q resonators, and a low-loss receiver front end consisting 
of a microstrip antenna, a low-noise amplifier, and a mixer for improved sensitivity.
2.6  Microstrip Applications
Satellite, airborne communications, and EW systems have requirements for small 
size, lightweight, and low-cost microwave passive components. Microstrip line-
based filters, impedance transformers, hybrids, couplers, power dividers/combin-
ers, delay lines, baluns, circulators, and antennas are used extensively in microwave 
systems, including measurement instruments where the demand on low-loss and 
high-power characteristics is not severe. The suspended microstrip provides a high-
er Q than the microstrip, as most of the energy is propagating in air. This results in 
lower loss passive components.
Sections of microstrip lines constitute the basic building blocks of microwave 
integrated circuits. When the size of the microstrip section is reduced to dimensions 
much smaller than the wavelength, it can be used as a lumped element. Examples 
of lumped microstrip elements are spiral inductors, thin film resistors, interdigital 
capacitors, metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitors, via holes, and airbridges as 
shown in Figure 2.39. Microstrip sections in lumped and distributed forms are 
commonly used in passive and active hybrid and monolithic integrated circuits. 
Examples of passive circuits include filters, impedance transformers, hybrids, cou-
plers, power dividers/combiners, delay lines, and baluns. Amplifiers, oscillators, 
mixers, and control circuits employing solid state devices constitute the other class. 
Microwave packages and assembly techniques frequently use microstrip transmis-
sion medium in the feedthroughs and interconnects. Another important application 
of microstrip lines is in high-temperature superconducting microwave integrated 
circuits. This section provides a brief introduction to the design of microstrip ele-
ments for the above-mentioned applications.
2.6.1  Lumped Elements
Lumped-element circuits that have lower Q than distributed circuits have the ad-
vantage of smaller size, lower cost, and wide-band characteristics. These are espe-
cially suitable for monolithic MICs and for broadband hybrid MICs where realestate 
requirements are of prime importance. Impedance transformations on the order of 
20:1 can be easily accomplished using the lumped-element approach. Therefore, high-
power devices that have very low impedance values can easily be tuned with large 
impedance transformers using lumped elements. Consequently, lumped elements find 
applications in high-power oscillators, power amplifiers, and broadband circuits.
With the advent of new photolithographic techniques, the fabrication of 
lumped elements that was limited to X-band frequencies can now be extended

Microstrip Lines II: Fullwave Analyses, Design Considerations, and Applications 
to about 60 GHz. The three basic building blocks for circuit design—inductors, 
capacitors, and resistors—are available in lumped form. Computer-aided design of 
circuits using lumped elements requires a complete and accurate characterization 
of lumped elements at microwave frequencies. This necessitates the development of 
comprehensive mathematical models that take into account the presence, for exam-
ple, of ground planes, proximity effect, fringing fields, and parasitics. The design, 
fabrication, and applications of lumped elements have been thoroughly discussed 
in the literature [123–127]. Bahl [127] exclusively discusses the subject of lumped 
element realization, characterization, and lumped element circuits. 
2.6.2  Passive Components
Microstrip passive components are fabricated using both hybrid and monolithic 
microwave integrated circuit techniques. Most commonly used substrate materials 
are RT Duroid, alumina, and GaAs. Use of a high dielectric constant substrate er ≅ 
10 is highly desirable. However, the substrate thickness is limited by modal prob-
lems. High-impedance lines on thin substrates require very narrow conductors, 
which become lossy, and the fabrication of narrow conductors can be difficult. For 
low frequencies up to about 4 GHz to 6 GHz for circuits and up to and beyond 20 
GHz for microstrip antennas, plastic substrates (er ≅ 2 to 4) are often used. Alu-

mina (Al2O3) is one of the most suitable substrate materials for use up to 20 GHz. 
The grade of the Al2O3 used depends upon the fabrication technology employed: 
thin or thick film. The dielectric constant of alumina may be high for millimeter-
wave circuits because high impedance lines with required tolerances are difficult 
to fabricate and are lossy. Quartz with a dielectric constant of 4 is more suitable 
and widely used for high-frequency (>20 GHz) microwave and millimeter-wave 
integrated circuits. Beryllia is a good conductor of thermal energy and is suitable 
for power applications where heat dissipation is large and a low thermal resistance 
substrate is required. GaAs is one of the most suitable substrates for MMICs, since 

128
Microstrip Lines II: Fullwave Analyses, Design Considerations, and Applications 
most of the active devices, such as low-noise MESFETs, power MESFETs, and 
Schottky diodes, are fabricated on a semi-insulating GaAs substrate along with the 
passive components.
Figures 2.40, 2.41 and 2.42 show many popular microstrip passive compo-
nents. The design of such components has been thoroughly discussed in references 
[126, 128–132]. To predict the performance of microstrip passive components, the

effects of junction and layout discontinuities and interaction effects between circuit 
elements due to close proximity must be included in the circuit analysis.
2.6.3  Active Components
Over the past three decades microwave active circuits have evolved from individual 
solid-state transistors, diodes, and passive elements housed in conventional wave-
guides and/or coaxial lines to integrated fully planar assemblies, fabricated using 
the microstrip medium. A hybrid microwave integrated circuit (MIC) consists of 
a microstrip interconnect pattern and microstrip distributed circuit components 
printed on a suitable substrate with active and lumped circuit components (in pack-

130
Microstrip Lines II: Fullwave Analyses, Design Considerations, and Applications 
aged or chip form) attached individually to the printed interconnect circuit by using 
soldering and wire bonding techniques. Solid-state active elements are either silicon 
or gallium arsenide (or other III-V compound) devices. More recently, the solid 
state monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) approach is becoming com-
monplace. In MMICs all interconnections and components, both active and pas-
sive, are fabricated simultaneously on a semi-insulating semiconductor substrate 
(usually gallium arsenide (GaAs) using deposition and etching processes, thereby 
eliminating discrete components and wire bond interconnects. Microstrip is com-
monly used for passive components. The term MMIC is used for circuits operating 
in the microwave (1 GHz to 30 GHz) region of the frequency spectrum as well as 
the millimeter wave (30 GHz to 300 GHz) region. Major advantages of MMICs 
include low cost, small size, low weight, circuit design flexibility, broadband per-
formance, elimination of circuit tweaking, high-volume manufacturing capability, 
package simplification, improved reproducibility, improved reliability, and multi-
function performance on a single chip.
Microwave integrated circuits use two types of active devices: two-terminal 
devices referred to as diodes such as Schottky, Gunn, tunnel, impact avalanche and 
transit time (IMPATT), varactor, and PIN; and three-terminal devices referred to as 
transistors such as the bipolar junction transistor (BJT), metal semiconductor field 
effect transistor (MESFET), high electron mobility transistor (HEMT), and hetero-
junction bipolar transistor (HBT). Microwave circuits using these devices include 
amplifiers, oscillators, multipliers, mixers, switches, phase shifters, attenuators, 
modulators, and many others used for receiver or transmitter applications cover-
ing microwave and millimeter-wave frequency bands. The theory and performance 
of most of these circuits have been well documented [126, 132–140]. Examples of 
some active circuits using the microstrip medium are shown in Figure 2.43. Solid-
state circuits are extensively used in applications such as radar, communication, 
navigation, electronic warfare (EW), smart weapons, consumer electronics, and 
microwave instruments.
2.6.4  Packages and Assemblies
Microwave packaging and assembly techniques play a very important role in the 
performance, cost, and reliability of packaged monolithic microwave integrated 
circuits. MMIC packages provide the necessary support structure and a protective 
enclosure without affecting its electrical and thermal characteristics appreciably. 
The affordability requirements on packages mandate that their complexity be mini-
mized.
The microstrip is the commonly used transmission medium in MICs and 
MMICs. It also provides excellent layout flexibility. Therefore, in order to provide 
a good interface between the MMIC and other circuitry in the package or between 
the MMIC and subsystem, a microstrip line is desired as an interconnect medium 
in microwave packages. The design of microwave packages has been treated exten-
sively in the literature [141–147]. The most important electrical characteristics of 
microwave packages are low insertion loss, high return loss and isolation, and no 
cavity or feedthrough resonance over the operating frequency range. When a chip

set is placed in the cavity of a microwave package, there should be minimum deg-
radation in the chip’s performance. Generally this cannot be accomplished without 
accurate electrical and electromagnetic modeling of the critical package elements. 
Microwave design principles must be applied to three parts of the package: RF 
feedthrough, cavity, and dc bias lines. Of the three, the design of the RF feedthrough 
is the most critical in determining the performance of packaged MMIC chips. As 
an example, Figure 2.44 shows some of the typical packaging techniques used for 
microwave circuits. An overview of RF and microwave packages has been included 
in [140].

Microstrip Discontinuities I: Quasi-Static 
Analysis and Characterization
3.1	
Introduction
Microstrip circuits invariably incorporate transmission line discontinuities of one 
type or another. Some of the most common forms of microstrip discontinuities 
are open ends, gaps, steps in width, right-angled bends, T junctions, and cross 
junctions. These are shown in Figure 3.1. Examples of circuits or circuit elements, 
wherein these discontinuities occur frequently, are also listed in this figure. A com-
plete understanding and design of microstrip circuits require characterization of 
various discontinuities included in the circuit. Since discontinuity dimensions are 
usually much smaller than the wavelength in microstrip, they may be modelled by 
lumped element equivalent circuits. A more complete characterization involves de-
termination of frequency-dependent scattering matrix coefficients associated with 
the discontinuity. Various methods of characterization of microstrip discontinuities 
are discussed in this and the next chapter.
Discontinuities appear in conventional microwave circuits (using coaxial lines 
and waveguides) also. However, it may be pointed out that it is much more impor-
tant to characterize discontinuities in microstrip circuits accurately. This is because 
of the fact that the microstrip circuits do not lend themselves to easy adjustments 
or tuning after the fabrication of the circuit is completed. If a provision is made for 
adjustments, the main advantages of compactness and reliability gained by the use 
of microstrip circuits are lost (at least partially). In monolithic circuits the first-pass 
success of design is heavily dependent on accurate characterization of microstrip 
and other discontinuities. Recent developments in microwave CAD have empha-
sized the introduction of accurate models for microstrip discontinuities.
A discontinuity in a microstrip is caused by an abrupt change in the geom-
etry of the strip conductor. Therefore, electric and magnetic field distributions are 
modified near the discontinuity. The altered electric field distribution gives rise to a 
change in capacitance, and the changed magnetic field distribution can be expressed 
in terms of an equivalent inductance. The analysis of a microstrip discontinuity in-
volves the evaluation of these capacitances and inductances and can either be based 
on quasi-static considerations or carried out more rigorously by fullwave analysis.
Quasi-static analysis involves calculations of static capacitances and low-­
frequency inductances. Equivalent circuits for discontinuities may be derived from 
these results. Alternatively, a waveguide type dynamic analysis taking dispersion 
(and possibly higher order modes) into account may be carried out. This can be 
based on the planar waveguide model of the microstrip line or one of the more 

140
Microstrip Discontinuities I: Quasi-Static Analysis and Characterization
rigorous full-wave electromagnetic analyses. Such a dynamic analysis leads to a 
frequency-dependent scattering matrix. Again, equivalent circuits for discontinui-
ties can be based on these results. Methods for the calculation of quasi-static ca-
pacitances and inductances for a discontinuity will be discussed in this chapter. 
Methods of dynamic analysis of the discontinuities are included in Chapter 4.
3.2	
Discontinuity Capacitance Evaluation
The static values of capacitances associated with discontinuities can be evaluated 
by finding the excess charge distribution near the discontinuity. The quasi-static 
methods for the evaluation of discontinuity capacitance have been treated by Far-
rar and Adams [1–3], Maeda [4], Itoh et al. [5, 6], Silvester and Benedek [7, 8], 
Benedek and Silvester [9], and Horton [10,11]. The different methods used for 
these calculations are:

1. Matrix inversion method [1–3];
2. Variational method [4];
3. Galerkin’s method in the spectral domain [5, 6];
4. Use of line sources with charge reversal [7–9].
These methods are discussed briefly in the following subsections. In all these meth­
ods, the following assumptions are implied: (i) the size of the discontinuity is small 
compared to the wavelength so that the phase variation across the discontinuity 
can be neglected; (ii) the current on the strip has zero divergence; and (iii) the strip 
conductor is infinitely thin.
3.2.1  Matrix Inversion Method
The matrix inversion method [3] is a very general approach for determining the 
static capacitance of a conductor of any arbitrary shape on the top surface of the 
microstrip substrate. The total conductor area is divided into small subsections 
over which the charge density can be assumed to be uniform. This subdivision for a 
microstrip rectangular section of length L and width W is shown in Figure 3.2. The 
typical subsection ∆sj, of sides ∆xj and ∆zj, is assumed to bear a uniform surface 
charge density σj. The potential at subsection ∆si due to n number of subsections 
may be written as
	
Vi =
σ jDij
j=1
n
∑
	
(3.1)
where Dij is a function representing the potential at subsection ∆si, due to a uniform 
charge density of magnitude unity on ∆sj. One can write a Green’s function express­
­ing potential due to a unit charge at ∆sj. Since the potential varies in all three direc­
tions, the Green’s function becomes three-dimensional. Values of Dij correspond to 
values of this Green’s function at y = h. Equation (3.1 may be put in matrix form as

In order to implement this method, an expression for Dij is needed. Dij for a rec-
tangular subsection is derived by using the theory of images [3]. A rectangular sub-
section has been selected because of its frequent occurrence in discontinuity prob-
lems. For evaluation of Dij , the potential due to a uniformly charged plate in free 
space is obtained first. Dij for the microstrip section is then evaluated by using the 
principle of multiple images. The resulting expression is a series, each term of which 
is contributed by an image of the charge. This series expression may be written as

Slow convergence of the series in (3.5) is a drawback of this method. About 40 terms 
of the series have been used in the computation of discontinuity capacitances [3].

Microstrip Discontinuities I: Quasi-Static Analysis and Characterization
The method has been used for finding capacitances associated with microstrip 
open ends, steps, and gaps. The capacitance associated with an open end (shown in 
Figure 3.3) may be written as
	
Coc = 1
2 lim
L→∞
Ct L
( ) - CL
⎡⎣
⎤⎦	
(3.6)
Ct(L) is the total capacitance of a microstrip section of total length L and C is the 
capacitance per unit length of an infinite line of the same width. In order to find the 
limit in (3.6), the length L is increased iteratively and the total capacitance is com-
puted until the open-end capacitance given by (3.6) converges. A difficulty with this 
procedure is that (3.6) involves subtraction of two nearly equal large numbers, and 
therefore very accurate computations of Ct(L) and CL are necessary.
The configuration for calculating the capacitance associated with a step in the 
width of a microstrip is shown in Figure 3.4. Its equivalent circuit is also shown in 
this figure. The capacitance associated with the step is evaluated as

where Coc (W1) and Coc (W2) are open-end capacitances of lines of width W1 and

In the case of a microstrip gap, the equivalent circuit consists of three capaci-
tances in a p-configuration as shown in Figure 3.5.

It may be noted that the subtraction of two nearly equal large numbers is involved 
in (3.7) and (3.10a). But such a subtraction is not involved in the computation of 
Cg, and thus an accurate computation of Cg is much less time consuming.

Microstrip Discontinuities I: Quasi-Static Analysis and Characterization
One can conclude that the method described above is a general one and 
can be used to compute the excess capacitance of any microstrip discontinuity.  
The difficulties faced in this method are slow convergence of infinite series in the 
three-dimensional Green’s function and the subtraction of two nearly equal large 
numbers. The accuracy of capacitance results can be improved at the expense of 
increased computer time.
3.2.2  Variational Method
This method [4] uses the variational principle to formulate the capacitance prob-
lem. It is known that the capacitance can be expressed by a variational expression 
that is stationary with respect to arbitrary first-order variations in the charge distri-
bution on the strip conductor [12]. If the charge distribution is r(r), the capacitance 
C may be expressed as

where the integrals are over all the volume in which the charge is distributed. Source 
and observation point coordinates are shown in Figure 3.6. Since (3.11) is a lower 
bound type of expression, the capacitance can be obtained by maximizing with a 
suitable choice of charge distribution as a trial function.
Therefore, the charge distribution does not need to be known exactly when 
using this method. G is a three-dimensional Green’s function for potential and 
satisfies the relation

The variational method has been used to characterize two types of disconti-
nuities: an open end and a gap, for which suitable Green’s functions have been 
developed. As shown in Figure 3.7(a), a gap in the strip conductor of a microstrip 
line, which is represented by a p equivalent circuit, can be analyzed by placing an 
electric wall and a magnetic wall successively along the plane of symmetry A. This 
corresponds to a short circuit and an open circuit, respectively, in the equivalent 
circuit representation. The capacitances between the microstrip end and the plane 
A are denoted Ce for electric wall and Cm for magnetic wall. The parameters of 
the equivalent p circuit, Cp (shunt gap capacitance) and Cg (coupling capacitance 
between the adjacent strip conductors), may be written in terms of Ce and Cm as
	
Ce = Cp + 2Cg
and
Cm = Cp 	
(3.13)
The capacitances Ce and Cm can be evaluated using (3.11) with suitable G and r. 
The configuration considered for evaluation of G for the two cases is shown in Fig-
ure 3.7(b). The portion of the microstrip betwen the planes of symmetry located at 
z = 0 and z = –c is enclosed in a box as shown in this figure. Two Green’s functions 
Ge and Gm are evaluated for electric wall and magnetic wall cases by writing the 
solution of (3.12) as a linear combination of hyperbolic sinusoidal functions and 
applying boundary and continuity conditions. The expressions obtained for Ge and 
Gm may be written as [4]

ρ(x,z) = f (x)g(z)	
(3.16)
where f( x) corresponds to the charge distribution of a uniform microstrip and may 
be written as [13]

The coefficient K is determined so as to maximize the capacitance. A table of opti-
mum values of coefficient K for the electric and magnetic walls for various values of 
er and S/h is given by Maeda [4]. When S/h is large (or in the case of an open-circuit 
discontinuity), K becomes unity for the electric as well as the magnetic walls.
This method has been used to characterize gaps and open ends. The open end 
capacitance is evaluated as a limit of the gap capacitance Cg when the gap width be-
comes very large. A fairly good agreement with experimental results is reported in [4].
3.2.3  Galerkin's Method in the Fourier Transform Domain [5, 6]
This method is similar to Galerkin’s method in FTD used for fullwave analysis of 
microstrip lines discussed in Chapter 2 and the variational method in FTD used for 
quasi-static analysis in Chapter 1. The microstrip configuration and the coordinate 
system are shown in Figure 3.8.
In this case a two-dimensional Fourier transform in the (x-z)-plane is used. 
Transforms of potential and charge are defined by

and f˜1 and f˜0 are the transforms of the potential functions on the strip and outside

of the inverse transforms of the basis functions weighted by the coefficients dn.

The fringing capacitance at the end of the open-circuited microstrip may again be 
evaluated using (3.6).
Comparing with the variational method of the last subsection, one notes that 
Green’s function in the transform domain is a closed-form expression in contrast to 
a slowly converging series in the space domain.
Although this method could, in principle, be applied to other discontinuities 
also, the results are available for microstrip open ends only.
3.2.4  Use of Line Sources with Charge Reversal
All three methods for the evaluation of discontinuity capacitance discussed so 
far involve subtraction of two nearly equal large quantities. This factor limits the 
computational accuracy. A method using line sources with charge reversal [7–9] 
overcomes this difficulty. This method uses line sources (not subareas) to develop 
Green’s functions suitable for discontinuity problems. The basic element common 
to all the discontinuities considered using this method is a semi-infinite line charge. 
Formulation of Green’s function for a semi-infinite line charge is shown in Figure 
3.9. Here, the semi-infinite line charge (c) is considered as a superposition of two 
line charges (a) and (b). Figure 3.9(a) shows a uniform and infinitely long line 
charge such as present in the case of an infinite microstrip. This charge distribution 
can be obtained by solving

where Ge is the two-dimensional Green’s function of the microstrip problem dis-
cussed in Section 1.2.3 and s∞ is the charge density on an infinitely extended mi-
crostrip line. We also consider a charge distribution shown in Figure 3.9(b) that is 
exactly similar to s∞(z) on half the infinite strip and exactly –s∞(z) on the other 
half. While this situation is physically difficult to realize, there is no mathematical 
objection to it, and the potential distribution in this case may be written as

where G0(x, z) is the appropriate Green’s function. When the charge distributions 
given by (3.28) and (3.29) are combined, we obtain the configuration of a semi-
infinite line charge, Figure 3.9(c), and the potential distribution is now given by

(3.30)
where fsi is the potential associated with a charge distribution exactly like that of 
an infinite microstrip but terminating at the origin. The potential fsi cannot satisfy 
the requirement of constant potential everywhere on the semi-infinite strip. To ob-
tain a constant potential, a certain amount of extra charge, say se, must be placed 
on half the strip. This excess charge se may be obtained from the equation

capacitance C, which may now be written as

(3.32)
Using the concepts outlined above, computing the capacitance associated with a 
microstrip open end involves:
1.	 Constructing Ge and G0;
2.	 Evaluating fsi from (3.30);
3.	 Solving integral equation (3.31) for se;
4.	 Finding the capacitance from (3.32).
Although the integration (3.31) is over a semi-infinite length, it may be noted 
that both the potential residual and the excess charge approach zero asymptoti-
cally (and rather rapidly) for points at increasing distances from the strip end. Also, 
(3.31) and (3.32) permit the solution for excess charge density and excess capaci-
tance directly, and the subtraction of two equally large quantities is not involved.
Green’s functions Ge and G0 are obtained [7] by considering the multiple im-
ages of a line charge when placed parallel to a dielectric slab. Green’s function Ge 
for a microstrip is given by (1.36) of Chapter 1, and G0 may be written as

The line source configuration used is shown in Figure 3.10 and h is the height of 
the dielectric substrate.
This method is very general and is used for all types of microstrip discontinui-
ties [8, 9] shown in Figure 3.1. The formulation for a microstrip gap is sketched 
in Figure 3.11. Green’s functions Geven and Godd are used in equations similar to 
(3.31) to calculate the residual potentials which lead to excess charges and discon-
tinuity capacitances. Similar formulations may be carried out for other discontinui-
ties also.

Discontinuity Inductance Evaluation
The calculation of capacitances associated with microstrip discontinuities has been 
discussed in the above section. However, in several cases, for example, bends, steps, 
and T-junctions, inductive effects also become significant. Evaluation of inductive 
reactances in the equivalent circuit of microstrip discontinuities using the quasi-
static method [14, 15] will be discussed in this section. These inductive components 
are frequency dependent, and quasi-static calculations can only provide their low 
frequency values.
When inductances are being calculated, the presence of the dielectric substrate 
(provided it is nonmagnetic) may be disregarded, and only the discontinuity struc-
ture and its image in the ground plane are considered. For magnetic substrates it 
will be necessary to consider the multiple images formed.
The magnetic vector potential A due to the current density J on any section of 
the line or discontinuity can be written as

which implies that the impressed potential satisfies Laplace’s equation on the strip 
conductor. The current density distribution on the microstrip structure can be 
found by solving (3.40) for f (or ∇f) and then (3.39) for J. Knowledge of current 
density distribution J enables the inductance L of the microstrip structure to be 
obtained from the relation

A straightforward implementation of the procedure indicated above will yield a 
value of discontinuity inductance as the difference between two large numbers cor-
responding to the inductance of the total structure including the discontinuity and 
the inductance contributed by the uniform line portion of the discontinuity struc-
ture. In this procedure it becomes difficult to obtain accurate values of L. This can 
be overcome using an excess current technique [14] similar to the excess charge 
formulation [7] used in Section 3.2.4. We will discuss this technique for the case of 
a right-angled bend.
For the purpose of inductance calculation, the configuration of the right-angled 
bend is divided into five sections (S1 to S5) as shown in Figure 3.12. The planes PP′ 
and QQ′ are located such that the currents in S1 and S5 are practically the same 
as for infinitely long lines, that is, Jz∞ or Jx∞, respectively. In S2 and S4, the current 
distribution is considered to consist of two components Jz∞ or Jx∞ and Je2 or Je4, the 
latter being excess circulating current because of the discontinuity. In S3 the only 
current component present is the excess circulating current Je3. The magnitude and 
the distribution of excess circulating currents Je2, Je3 and Je4 are to be determined. 
Equation (3.39) becomes (for the configuration in Figure 3.12),

Characterization of Various Discontinuities
Quasi-static techniques for evaluating discontinuity capacitances and inductances 
were described in the previous section. The results of these types of analyses for 
various microstrip discontinuities will be presented now. Closed-form expressions 
for these discontinuities (wherever available) and the ranges of their validity are 
included here. Some of these closed-form expressions are based on the fullwave 
analysis data, methods for which are discussed in Chapter 4. Techniques of com-
pensation of the reactive effects of these discontinuities to obtain better circuit 
performance are also described in this section.

3.4.1  Open Ends
An open-end discontinuity occurs frequently in a number of circuits such as reso-
nators, matching stubs, parallel coupled filters, and in microstrip antennas. The 
equivalent circuit of an open end is represented by an excess capacitance Coc which 
can be transformed into an equivalent length of transmission line, Dloc as shown 
in Figure 3.13. The equivalent capacitance shown in Figure 3.13(b) is what is usu-
ally calculated, whereas the equivalent line length representation (Figure 3.13(c)) is 
more convenient for circuit design.
The most extensive data set on the microstrip open circuit has been obtained 
by Silvester and Benedek [7] using the method of line sources with charge rever-
sal. Their results are presented in Figure 3.14. Also they have given an empirical 
expression that is very useful for computational purposes and may be written as

where Ci’s are numerical constants tabulated in [7] for er = 1.0, 2.5, 4.2, 9.6, 16.0, 
and 51.0. For example, for er = 9.6, values of Ci are 1.738, –0.2538, 0.1308, 
–0.0087, –0.0113 for i = 1, . . . , 5 respectively.
The equivalent additional line length Dloc for an open-circuit discontinuity may 
be obtained from Coc by using the relation
	
Δoc

(3.48)
where c is the velocity of wave propagation in free space. An empirical expression 
for Dloc/h has been obtained by modifying the expression derived by Hamerstad 
and Bekkadal [16]. The expression is given [17] as

Maximum relative error in this expression, as compared to (3.47), is less than 
4 percent for W/h ≥ 0.2 and 2 ≤ er ≤ 50. However, the result above is not valid [18] 
for wide microstrip lines (say W/h > 3) used extensively for microstrip antennas.
A more accurate expression, with accuracy better than 0.2 percent for the 
range of normalized widths 0.01 ≤ W/h ≤ 100 and er ≤ 128, has been derived 
[19] by curve fitting the numerical results based on hybrid-mode fullwave analysis 
[20, 21]. According to this,

The effect of dispersion on Dloc has been analyzed by Itoh [23]. At millimeter 
wavelengths the value of Dloc is considerably smaller than that computed by using

the quasi-static approximation. However, for frequencies up to about 10 GHz, the 
quasi-static approach gives reasonably good results.
For thicker substrates and for wider microstrip lines, radiation from an open 
end discontinuity becomes significant [24, 25]. Rigorous fullwave analyses based 
on the method of moments [26, 27] and spectral domain [28] for characterization 
of a microstrip open end have also been reported. Figure 3.15 is a typical example 
of the very few results available from such analyses. In this case, the open-end 
capacitance is replaced with a parallel combination of open-end capacitance (Coc) 
and radiation conductance (Goc). We note that as frequency increases, the radia-
tion conductance associated with the open end increases while the capacitance de-
creases. A more elaborate equivalent circuit model, based on fullwave analysis of 
open-end discontinuity, is shown in Figure 3.16. Closed-form expressions for the 
circuit element values are given as [28]:

3.4.2  Gaps in a Microstrip
The characterization of a gap in a microstrip is useful in the design of, for example, 
dc blocks, end coupled filters, and coupling elements to resonators. A microstrip 
gap and its equivalent circuits are shown in Figure 3.17. There are three sets of 
published data for gap capacitance [1, 4, 9]. Perhaps the results of Benedek and 
Silvester are the most accurate as the other two involve the subtraction of nearly 
equal large numbers. The available results are shown in Figure 3.18. The two sets 
of points shown in Figure 3.18(b) correspond to results of Maeda [4] and Farrar 
and Adam [1]. The capacitances Codd and Ceven are related to Cp and Cg by
	
Ceven = 2 Cp
Codd = 2Cg + Cp 	
(3.52)
Equivalent line length Dlg of Figure 3.17 may be calculated as
	
Δg

(3.53)
A comparison of computed and experimental results given by Maeda [4] is shown 
in Figure 3.19. Experimental results for Cg are derived from [29]. The agreement 
between the experimental results and computed values is reasonably good.
It may be noted that the curves of Figure 3.18 are well suited for polynomial 
approximation as has been done for the open-end capacitance discussed in the pre-
vious section. The closed-form expressions for Ceven and Codd for er = 9.6 and 0.5 ≤

The values of Codd and Ceven for other values of er in the range 2.5 ≤ er ≤ 15 can be 
calculated by scaling according to the relations

(3.56)
	
Ceven(εr) = Ceven(9.6)(εr ⁄ 9.6)0.9
	
(3.57)
The accuracy of these expressions is within 7 percent for the above-mentioned set 
of parameters.
Closed-form expressions for a microstrip gap discontinuity based on the spec-
tral domain method have been reported by Alexopoulos and Wu [28]. The model 
parameters shown in Figure 3.20 are evaluated for er = 9.9 using the following 
equations:

3.4.3  Steps in Width
Steps in width exist at junctions of two microstrip lines that have different imped-
ances. This type of discontinuity is encountered when designing matching trans-
formers, couplers, filters, and transitions. The configurations of a step discontinuity 
and its equivalent circuit are shown in Figure 3.21. Results for excess capacitance 
Cs have been given by Farrar and Adams [1], Benedek and Silvester [9], and Gupta 
and Gopinath [30]. Data for Cs given by Gupta and Gopinath are most extensive 
and are presented in Figure 3.22 for er = 2.3 and 9.6. The small dotted curve in 
Figure 3.22(b) corresponds to [9] and has been inserted to compare the two sets of 
results. In terms of distributed elements, the discontinuity capacitance Cs has the 
effect of an increase in the wide line’s length and an equal decrease in the narrow 
line’s length. As these effects are small, the change in lengths may be approximated 
Figure 3.21  (a) A microstrip step discontinuity and (b) its equivalent circuit.

Microstrip Discontinuities I: Quasi-Static Analysis and Characterization
by Dloc (1 – W2/W1) [16] where Dloc is the open-circuit line extension calculated 
from (3.48) for line width W1. A more accurate expression for the change in lengths 
that is applicable for a wide range of er values is given by Rizzoli et al. [31] as Dloc 
f(er) [1 – W2/W1], where the function f(er) has the form
	
f (εr) = 1.25 + 0.19tan−1 6.16- εr
(
) 	
(3.60)
Measurement of the step capacitance has been reported by Easter et al. [32]. A 
comparison with the results in Figure 3.22 is difficult because of insufficient infor-
mation about the experimental data.
Some results for the inductance associated with a step discontinuity in a micro-
strip are also available [15]. These are based on the method of quasi-static compu-
tation of inductance discussed in Section 3.3. Inductance Ls plotted in Figure 3.23 
is the total of inductances L1 and L2 shown in Figure 3.21 and has been normalized

to 10 GHz. It may be pointed out that inductance values are in the range of 
1.4 × 10–11 H to 9.6 × 10–11 H.
To factor in the effect of discontinuity inductances in the circuit design, the to-
tal inductance Ls may be separated into L1 and L2 (as a first-order approximation) 
as follows:

3.4.4  Bends
A microstrip bend may be formed by two lines of equal or unequal impedances and 
is normally used for introducing flexibility in the layout of the circuit design. The 
equivalent circuit of a microstrip bend with lines of equal impedances is shown in 
Figure 3.25. The most common form of microstrip bend used in circuits and inves-
tigated analytically is a right-angled bend (fb = 90°).
Silvester and Benedek [8] have computed the electrostatic value of the excess 
capacitance of right-angled bends; their results are shown in Figure 3.26. Experi-
mental results given by Easter [33] are shown as three small circles in this figure. It 
is observed that the agreement between the theoretical and experimental results is 
reasonably good only for microstrips with 50-Ω impedance.
Inductance for right-angled bends has been computed by Thomson and Gopi-
nath [14], and their results are shown in Figure 3.27, wherein the normalized in-
ductance (Lb/Lwh) is plotted for different width: height ratios. A comparison to the 
experimental results of Easter [33] is also shown, but the agreement is not very good.

3.4.5  T-Junctions
The T-junction is perhaps the most important discontinuity in a microstrip as it is 
found in most circuits such as impedance networks, stub filters, and branch-line 
couplers. A microstrip T-junction and its equivalent circuit are shown in Fig­ure 
3.28. The discontinuity capacitance CT for this structure has been calculated by 
Silvester and Benedek [8]. Their results are shown in Figure 3.29. Capacitances

shown in this figure are for per-unit main-line width. The inductance calculation 
for T-junctions have been carried out by Thomson and Gopinath [14]. Their results 
are shown in Figure 3.30. A comparison with the experimental results of Easter 
[33] is also shown. The agreement between the experimental and theoretical results 
for L2 is not as good as for L1.
Closed-form expressions for the discontinuity reactances of the equivalent cir-
cuit shown in Figure 3.28(b) with a main-line impedance of 50 Ω and for er = 9.9 
have also been derived [17] as follows:

Equations (3.70) to (3.72) hold for the symmetric T-junction shown in Figure 
3.28(a). For a nonsymmetrical T-junction (Figure 3.31a), an equivalent circuit like 
that shown in Figure 3.31 (b) has been proposed [18]. It has been suggested that 
for moderate nonsymmetry, the results for the symmetrical case may be extended to 
the nonsymmetrical case as follows. For the main arm turns ratio, use the mainline 
impedance of the side being calculated. For the sidearm reference plane displace-
ment and the shunt susceptance, use the main line impedance equal to the geomet-
ric mean of the two actual ones. The expressions for the symmetric case are

3.4.6  Cross Junctions
One of the most common applications of a cross junction is for the realization of 
low impedance stubs. When a low impedance stub has a strip width large enough 
to sustain transverse resonance modes, one of the possible solutions is to employ 
two stubs in parallel, connected on either side of the main line. The impedance of 
each of the equivalent stubs is equal to twice the impedance of the simulated stub.
The geometery of a microstrip cross junction and its equivalent circuit are 
shown in Figure 3.32. Capacitance C+ has been calculated by Silvester and Benedek 
[8], and their results are shown in Figure 3.33. Inductances associated with a cross 
junction have been computed by Gopinath et al. [15] but are expressed in terms of

a somewhat different equivalent circuit (shown in Figure 3.34). Inductance results 
are shown in Figure 3.35(a, b). Figure 3.35(a) presents calculated values of L1 
normalized to Lw1h of the cross junction for different W1/h and W2/h. This same 
set of curves is to be used to estimate normalized L2 by interchanging W1 and W2. 
Calculated values of L3 normalized to Lw1h are shown in Figure 3.35(b). Only one 
experimental point due to Easter [33] is available for comparison and is shown in 
these figures. The agreement is good for L1 and L2 but not for L3.
Closed-form expressions for cross-junction discontinuities have been derived 
[17] by curve fitting the available numerical results for capacitances and induct-
ances for er = 9.9. The expressions are accurate to within 5 percent and are given as

[34] and compared with the T-junction. This comparison indicates that the T-junc-
tion data may be used as a first step to estimate the properties of the cross-junction. 
An approximate value of C+ may be calculated by using C+ = 0.75 Cm where Cm is 
the capacitance of the uniform microstrip line of widest width in the cross junction.
3.4.7  Notch

3.4.8  RF Short and Via Hole
In RF and microwave circuits, shorts and via holes are frequently used for dc and 
RF ground connections. Via holes are also used for interconnections of metal layers 
in a multilayer technology. Low-loss and low-inductance grounds are very impor-
tant to achieve good gain, noise figure, insertion loss, VSWR, output power, PAE, 
stability, and wide bandwidth performance in amplifiers. In MICs/MMICs, one 
needs the backside ground metalization to be connected with the minimum pos-
sible inductance path to the top side of the substrate having RF microstrip ground 
pads. In MICs, there are two basic techniques used to achieve such ground con-
nections. These are via hole and wrap-around grounds, and their typical configura-
tions are shown in Figure 3.37. 
Wrap-Around Ground
Wrap-around ribbons, or ground straps, are used for low-inductance ground con-
nections in hybrid MICs, and their equivalent circuit model may be represented by 
a simple inductor. The inductance of the ribbon/strap is given by

where W, t, and l are the width, thickness, and length of the strap expressed in 
microns, respectively. For W = 380 mm, t = 15 mm, and l = 380 mm, the calculated 
value of L is 0.053 nH.
Via Hole Connection 
In multilayer MMICs, RFICs, and digital ICs, the interconnection between differ-
ent level metals is realized using via holes in the separating dielectric layer or layers, 
which are generally of 1–3 mm thick polyimide. For a 3mm × 3mm contact via hole, 
the dc resistance is about 0.1 Ω. They have minimum parasitic inductance. Via hole 
connections are integral parts of transistors, inductors, transformers, and Lange 
couplers. In multilayer MICs, the thickness of separating dielectric layers is much 
larger than polyimide thickness. In this case, the lumped element model described 
next may be used.
Via Hole Ground Model 
Several different techniques have been applied to develop via hole models. These in-
clude analytical methods [36], quasistatic approach [37], fullwave analysis [38–47], 
time domain measurements [48, 49], and S-parameter measurement-based models 
[50]. Analytical models have limited accuracy; quasi-static models are valid for 
dimensions much smaller than the operating wavelengths; fullwave techniques pro-
vide accurate results but require long computational time; and measurement-based 
models are valid for only those geometries used in the characterization. Analytical 
models are discussed in this section.
An analytical model of a via hole is a series combination of an inductance Lvia 
and resistance Rvia of a cylindrical via hole shown in Figure 3.38. Expressions for 
Lvia and Rvia were obtained by Goldfarb and Pucel [36] and are given below.

meability, σ is the conductivity of the metal, and d is its skin depth. For h = 380 mm 
and r = 100 mm, the calculated value of Lvia is 0.067 nH, which is larger than the 
strap inductance value because of smaller via hole diameter.
A more accurate model for a via hole includes the reactance of the microstrip 
via pad section between the microstrip feed and via hole, and is shown as induct-
ance Lp in Figure 3.38. The value of Lp can be determined as described in Chapter 2.

Compensated Microstrip Discontinuities
In microwave integrated circuit designs, the reactances introduced by microstrip 
discontinuities should either be taken into account or microstrip structures with 
compensated discontinuities should be used. In general, compensated discontinui-
ties improve the circuit performance as well as the bandwidth. Usually chamfered 
bends or rounded corners are used in MICs and MMICs. The chamfered discon-
tinuity technique is also known as the discontinuity compensation in which the 
discontinuity reactances are minimized by removing appropriate portions of the 
microstrip conductor near the discontinuity location. In this section we describe 
briefly the step in width, right-angled bend, and T-junction compensated microstrip 
discontinuities.
3.5.1  Step in Width
The compensation of a step discontinuity using appropriate tapers has been, re-
ported [51–54]. In this case the effect of discontinuity reactances is reduced by 
chamfering the large width. The taper length depends upon the step ratio, dieletric 
constant value, and the substrate thickness (h). For h/λ ≤ 0.01 and a step ratio less 
than 3, the step discontinuity reactance is negligible and generally no compensation 
technique is needed. Figure 3.39 shows three types of tapers. The taper shown in 
Figure 3.39(a) has been studied using a planar waveguide model and is described in 
Section 4.1.2. For a gradual taper, as shown in Figure 3.39(b), closed form expres-
sions for the contour of taper compensating step discontinuities in microstrip lines 
are given by Raicu [54]. For a partial taper, as shown in Figure 3.39(c), discontinu-
ity compensation on the 75-mm- to 125-mm-thick GaAs substrate has been arrived 
at by using a commerical fullwave analysis CAD tool. For a step-width ratio rang-
ing from 3 to 13, the step discontinuity reactance is negligible when L = W1/8 and 
W1′ = 0.33 W1.

lent circuit model for a ground via hole.

3.5.2  Bends
In practical circuits, microstrip bends are chamfered (see Figure 3.40) to compen-
sate for the excess capacitance Measurements by Easter et al. [32] indicate that a 
chamfer of approximately 72 percent as defined in Figure 3.40 is needed for a bend 
in a 50-Ω line on alumina substrate. This figure includes variation of normalized 
discontinuity susceptance (B/Y0) as a function of percentage chamfer and shows 
that 72 percent chamfering will increase the length correction in the equivalent 
circuit to approximately 0.3 of the substrate thickness. The length of the cham-
fer (Wc) is approximately 1.8W. Groll and Weidmann [55] have also found the 
optimum length of the chamfer using TDR measurements for a 50-Ω line on alu-
mina substrate. They observed that Wc = I.83W gives a VSWR less than 1.11 up 
to 12 GHz. Hammerstad and Bekkadal [16] have found optimum lengths of the 
chamfer for 50-Ω microstrips on rexolite substrates having various bend angles 
(f = 30°, 60°, 90°, and 120°). The value of Wc comes out to be about 1.8W in all 
of these cases.

Microstrip Discontinuities I: Quasi-Static Analysis and Characterization
Data on the optimum amount of chamfering have been given in [56] as
	
M = 52 + 65exp(-1.35W⁄h) 	
(3.86)
for W/h ≥ 0.25 and er ≤ 25, where M is the percentage chamfer given by (X/d) × 
100% with X and d as shown in Figure 3.41. For a chamfered bend, the reflection 
coefficient S11 ~ 0, when the transmission line is terminated by an impedance equal 
to its characteristic impedance, but the discontinuity reactances cause a reduction 
∆b in length compared to that measured along the centerlines of the microstrip 
lines. A closed-form expression for this reduction in length may be written as [18]
	
Δb/D = 0.16{2 - (f⁄fp)2} 	
(3.87)
where D and fp are given by (3.77) and (3.78), respectively.
Several other types of chamfering, as shown in Figure 3.42, have been stud-
ied. Figure 3.43 compares calculated S11 for an uncompensated right-angled bend 
discontinuity with different compensated topologies. The configuration of Figure 
4.42(c) provides the best compensation for this example.
3.5.3  T-Junction
The T-junction discontinuity compensation is much more difficult than the step-in 
width and right-angled bend discontinuity compensation techniques described in 
the previous subsections. Figure 3.44(a) shows T-junction compensation configura-
tions using rectangular and triangular notches and their approximate dimensions 
for h/ l  1. However, accurate dimensions of the compensated configuration de-
pend upon the line widths, dielectric constant, and the substrate thickness. Figure 
3.44(b) illustrates T-junction discontinuity minimization configurations in which 
the line widths are tapered to minimize the junction effect. In this case the taper 
length is about twice the line width or substrate thickness, whichever is larger.
T-junction discontinuities can also be compensated for by adjusting the lengths 
of the three microstrip lines forming the junction. The effect of the shunt suscep-
tance can be compensated for by changing the microstrip widths near the junction

as shown in Figure 3.45. The lengths q1, q2 and the characteristic impedances (Zm1 
Zm2) of the modified portions near the junctions can be derived from the values 
of the, discontinuity reactances [57]. The microstrip discontinuity compensation 
using defected ground structures has been described recently [58]. The defected 
ground structures are discussed in Chapter 6.
The discussion on microstrip discontinuities is continued in Chapter 4, where 
fullwave analyses for discontinuities and the techniques for experimental measure-
ments of discontinuity parameters are discussed.

Microstrip Discontinuities II:  
Fullwave Analysis and Measurements
The quasi-static characterization of capacitances and inductances associated with 
microstrip discontinuities was discussed in Chapter 3. Results based on quasi-static 
analysis are valid, with sufficient accuracy, only up to frequencies of a few giga-
hertz. For a complete characterization of discontinuities, the frequency depend-
ence of various parameters must be determined. This information is obtained from 
dynamic analyses, which are discussed in this chapter. Two-dimensional analysis, 
based on a planar waveguide model of a microstrip line, is presented in Section 4.1. 
Methods for more rigorous fullwave analysis are described in Section 4.2. Tech-
niques for measuring microstrip discontinuities are also included in this chapter.
4.1	
Planar Waveguide Analysis
4.1.1  Discontinuity Characterization
The planar waveguide model [1–3] for the microstrip line discussed in Section 1.3 
is a very powerful technique for analyzing a number of microstrip discontinuities. 
Steps in width, T-junctions, bends, and cross junctions have been analyzed using 
this method and are discussed in this section. The equivalent circuits of these dis-
continuities can be obtained by using the derived scattering parameters and the 
theory of linear networks.
Step in Width [4]
The planar waveguide model of a step discontinuity is shown in Figure 4.1. Dimen-
sions a and b are widths of planar waveguides corresponding to the microstrip lines 
“a” and “b,” respectively. The cross-sectional areas of these guides are denoted by 
Aa (= a × h) and Ab (= b × h).
Since the height of the substrate, h, is much less than the wavelength in the 
microstrip, the fields are uniform along the y-direction in the equivalent planar 
waveguide model. Under this condition only TEM and TEm0 modes can be excited. 
(TMmn modes do not exist because a small value of the substrate height requires 
n = 0, whereas the lowest value of n for TM modes is unity.) For TEm0 modes, the 
transverse fields in the planar waveguide model can be expressed in terms of or-
thogonal series expansions as

where Um0 and Im0 are the expansion coefficients and ym0 are the scalar potentials 
for TE modes. The unit vector along the z-axis is denoted by zˆ, and m = 0 cor-
responds to the dominant mode (TEM). The symbol ∇t designates the transverse 
component of the gradient.
In the discontinuity plane (z = 0) the following boundary and interface condi-
tions must be satisfied:

in region Ab - Aa

Ht
a = Ht
b
in region Aa
	
(4.3b)
	
Et
a = Et
b
in region Aa
	
(4.3c)
It can be shown that the conditions given by (4.3) can only be satisfied if the 
transverse magnetic field of guide “a” is expanded in terms of the modes of 
guide “b.” While expanding the magnetic field Ha
t in terms of the modes of guide 
“b,” the expansion coefficients Ib are chosen in such a way that Hb
t = 0 in region  
Ab - Aa and will be equal to Ha
t in the discontinuity plane. On the other hand, 
no special boundary condition exists for the transverse electric field in the region  
Ab - Aa, so that the electric field Eb
t in the discontinuity cross section can be ex-
panded in terms of the modes of guide “a.”
Multiplying (4.3c) by (zˆ × ∇ty a
M0) for various values of M (= 0, 1, 2 ...) and 
integrating over the aperture Aa leads to the equation

Results and Equivalent Circuit
Numerical results of the scattering parameters of a symmetric step discontinuity 
have been reported by Kompa [4]. Typical results for frequency-dependent scatter-
ing matrix coefficients are shown in Figure 4.2. The incident mode considered here 
is the dominant TEM mode, while only even modes with m = 0, 2, 4 are assumed 
to be excited by the discontinuity. Figure 4.2 shows that, at frequencies well below 
the cut-off frequency of the first higher order mode (m = 2), the transmission and 
reflection coefficients are fairly constant. At the cut-off frequency of the TE20 mode 
(fc1) the incident TEM mode is rejected and no transmission is possible. Assuming 
the step to be lossless, the reflection coefficient becomes equal to unity. For frequen-
cies greater than the cut-off frequency, a part of the power is transmitted by the 
TE20 mode due to mode conversion, so that the transmission coefficient S21 for the 
dominant mode is always smaller than that for f = 0 (quasi-static case).
The equivalent circuit of a step discontinuity is determined from the known 
S-matrix by converting it into the Y-matrix. The Y-matrix elements yik which are 
normalized with respect to the characteristic admittance of guide “a,” can be ob-
tained from the relation

Ports 1-1′ and 2-2′ refer to the TEM mode, while the port 3-3′ corresponds to the 
first higher order mode. The characteristic impedance Z03 for this mode is defined 
by the axial power flow of the first higher order mode in guide “b,” that is,

where Pp0 is the axial power flowing in the (p0) mode.

Microstrip Discontinuities II: Fullwave Analysis and Measurements 
Figure 4.3(b) shows computed results for the equivalent circuit parameters. It 
can be seen that under single-mode propagation conditions, the discontinuity can 
be represented by a simple series inductance.
T-Junction [5]
The fullwave analysis of a T-junction using the planar waveguide model has been 
reported by Mehran [5]. The other two discontinuities (the right-angled bend and 
the cross junction) can be considered in terms of the T-junction by making use of
symmetry considerations. Therefore the T-junction will be considered in detail for 
formulating the boundary value problem.
The T-junction geometry (shown in Figure 4.4) is subdivided into regions “a” 
and “b” wherein the transverse fields are expressed in terms of an orthogonal series 
expansion. The fields are matched at the discontinuity interface z = 0, which results 
in an infinite system of linear equations. The wave amplitudes in region “a,” for 
arbitrary excitation, can be calculated by truncating the system of linear equations. 
To obtain the scattering parameters of the T-junction, the wave amplitudes of the 
transmitted waves in region “b” are evaluated.
The height of the substrate, h, is again much less than the wavelength in the 
microstrip, and the magnetic field does not have a component in the y-direction. 
Therefore, as was the case for step discontinuity, the description of the total field is 
complete in terms of an expansion using TEm0 modes only (m = 0 corresponds to 
the TEM-mode).
In region “a,” the transverse field components may be written in terms of the 
series of the scalar potentials used in (4.1) and (4.2) as

interface cannot be achieved because the functions yb

In (4.20) and (4.21), and also in the equations appearing later in this section, the 
upper functions are used if a T-junction with a magnetic side wall opposite to guide 
“a” is analyzed. For an electric wall, the lower functions are valid. The latter con-
figuration is useful for extending the results of a T-junction discontinuity to the case 
of a cross junction.
The boundary condition that must be fulfilled by the transverse field compo-
nents given by (4.14), (4.15) and (4.20), (4.21) is the continuity relation at the 
interface (z = 0)-plane. However, the unknown weighting function F(bb

derived first. This is done by choosing the magnetic field components at the inter-
face a - b in the following way

When (4.23) is multiplied by ∇tyb*(bx) and integrated with respect to y from 0 to h,

Finally, expressions for Ea
t and Eb
t , (4.14) and (4.20), at the interface a - b are 
equated. The resulting equation is solved by projecting the series in (4.14) and 
(4.20) into the function space spanned by the elements ∇tyb*(bx). The integration is 
performed with respect to the strip -∞ ≤ x ≤ ∞, 0 ≤ y ≤ h. This procedure results in 
an infinite system of linear equations. The wave amplitudes a1(m0) and b1(m0) of re-
gion “a” for arbitrary excitation can be calculated by truncating the infinite system 
of linear equations. Thus the field component Ha
t (z = 0) is known and (4.24) yields 
the weighting function F(bb
x).
To obtain the scattering parameters of the T-junction, the wave amplitude of 
the transmitted wave in region “b” is calculated. It is known that the integral rep-
resentation of Eb
t has to decompose into the discrete modes of waveguide “b” for 
|x| ≥ W1/2. This decomposition is achieved by inserting the known function F(bb
x) 
in (4.20) and evaluating the resulting integral. The field amplitudes can then be 
recognized as the coefficients of the constituent modal terms. 
For TEm0 modes the expansion coefficients for guide “a” are related by the 
equation

Results and Equivalent Circuit
Numerical results for the scattering parameters have been reported by Mehran [5]. 
If the incident wave is the dominant TEM mode, at least four modes should be 
considered in region “b” and at least two modes in region “a” when the transmis-
sion coefficient is to be calculated with an accuracy of 1 percent. The two modes in 
region “a” describe the total field and account for the reflected wave also.
Typical results for frequency-dependent scattering matrix coefficients of a T-
junction are shown in Figure 4.5. We note that |ST
11|, and therefore the power re-
flected by the T-junction discontinuity at z = 0 increases with frequency in the range 
0 ≤ f ≤ fc1, where fc1 is the cut-off frequency of the first higher order (TE10) mode 
in region “b.” Correspondingly, the power transmitted into region “b” decreases 
with frequency (Figure 4.5(b)). For frequencies greater than fc1 a part of the power 
is transmitted by the TE10 mode, so that the transmission coefficient |ST
11| for the 
TEM mode is always smaller than that for f = 0. Figure 4.5(c) indicates that if 
the TEM mode is incident at port 2, the power reflected into guide “b” decreases

with increasing frequency. Also the power transmitted into guide “a” decreases, 
whereas the power transmitted into port 3 behaves in the opposite manner. It may 
be pointed out that the information contained in Figure 4.5 provides S-parameters 
for the TEM-mode since the incident power has been assumed to propagate in the 
dominant TEM-mode. For frequencies greater than fc1 (cut-off for the TE10 mode) 
a part of the power is transmitted in the TE10 mode also. Therefore, S-parameters 
for the TEM-mode do not describe the circuit completely for frequencies greater 
than fc1.
A comparison between theoretical and experimental results is shown in Fig-
ure 4.6. Small circles show the experimental points. Discrepancies near the cut-off 
frequencies of higher order modes in microstrip of width W are attributed to the 
radiation effects.

from the scattering parameters. The equivalent circuits of a T-junction with a mag-

In the above equation, the subscript m denotes a magnetic wall. The impedances 
ZT
im are normalized with respect to Z02. For frequencies lower than the cut-off 
frequency of the first higher order mode, all elements of the equivalent circuit are 
reactances (capacitive or inductive). The reactance representation of the equivalent 
circuit is shown in Figure 4.8(a). For a typical set of T-junction parameters the vari-
ations of these reactances with frequency are shown in Figure 4.8(b). This figure 
shows that except for C4T, other capacitances and inductances of the equivalent 
circuit do not vary much with frequency up to about 10 GHz.
For a T-junction with electric wall, ZT
le is given by the expression for ZT

S-parameters corresponding to a T-junction with electric wall (Figure 4.4) are used.
Right-Angled Bend and Cross Junction [5]
The scattering parameters for right-angled bends and cross junctions can be de-
rived from those for the T-junction. This is achieved by an even- and odd-mode 
excitation at the opposite ports (ports 2 and 3 in Figure 4.4). Right-angled bends 
and cross junctions are discussed in the following paragraphs.
The scattering parameters of a right-angled bend can be arrived at from the 
analysis of a T-junction with a magnetic wall at z = W2. When the T-junction is 
excited symmetrically at ports 2 and 3 (a2 = a3 = v2 as shown in Figure 4.9), the 
symmetry plane x = 0 (which bisects the T-junction into two identical right-angled 
bends) can be replaced by a magnetic wall. Using the symmetry and reciprocity 
properties of the structure, the relationship between the scattering parameters of 
the T-junction and the bend may be written as

The S-parameters of a cross junction are calculated in the following manner. Any 
arbitrary excitation v at port 1 can be considered as a superposition of a symmetric
(a1 = v/2, a3 = v/2) excitation and an antisymmetric excitation (a1 = v/2, a3 = - v/2) 
at ports 1 and 3. This situation is shown in Figure 4.10. The cross junction with 
symmetric excitation is a combination of two T-junctions with magnetic walls 
placed back to back. Similarly, for antisymmetric excitation, a cross junction cor-
responds to two T-junctions with an electric wall as shown in Figure 4.10. These 
T-junctions have the effective width of the through arm equal to WC
e2/2. The above 
considerations allow us to write the S-parameters of a cross junction as

S-parameters for right-angled bends are calculated using (4.28) and (4.29). For

tinuities are derived from the equivalent circuit impedances ZT

with superscript C denoting the cross junction. The subscript e indicates electric 
wall at z = W2/2 opposite to guide “a” of the T-junction. The equivalent circuit 
in terms of capacitances and inductances, based on the results of (4.33), is shown 
in Figure 4.12(b). The variations of these components with frequency are shown 
in Figure 4.12(c). In this case also, the variation of inductances with frequency is 
small, up to 10 GHz.
The planar waveguide model of a microstrip can also be used to analyze more 
general unsymmetrical discontinuities [7]. An example of an unsymmetrical cross-
ing is shown in Figure 4.13(a). The microstrip lines are replaced by the equivalent 
planar waveguides, and the connnecting field region is treated as a rectangular disc 
resonator. The fields of the rectangular disc resonator can also be approximated by 
a magnetic wall model. The magnetic fields in various regions are matched at the 
subareas Ai (i = 1, 2, 3, 4), all other boundaries being magnetic walls. By superposi-
tion of the fields of the four subproblems and matching the electric fields in the area 
Ai, the scattering matrix of the discontinuity can be calculated, taking into account 
the influence of dispersion effects and higher order modes. Figure 4.13(b) shows 
some other types of discontinuities that can be analyzed using this method.
Curved Microstrip Bend
Curved microstrip bends are frequently used in MMICs and MICs. For high imped-
ance microstrip lines they offer better alternative to chamfered microstrip bends. 
The curved microstrip bends have been analyzed using magnetic wall planar wave-
guide model [15]. Figure 4.14 shows the curved microstrip bend and its equiva-
lent waveguide model. When the curvature is large (i.e., R/W is greater than 3), 
the parasitic effect (due to the curvature discontinuity) is negligible. However, the

tion and (b) other types of discontinuities that could be analyzed by the parallel plate waveguide

is given by [15]:

(4.34c)
where the angle a is measured in degrees. Thus, the curvature increases the curved 
section’s line length. Therefore, in the design of microstrip circuits one needs a 
correction (-Dl) in the line length corresponding to the difference in the electrical 
length of the physical curved line and the equivalent waveguide model line. For 
a right-angled bend with 3<R/W<7, the increased line length is about 0.3W [16]. 
For larger radius of curvatures and narrow line widths, the increased line length 
becomes negligible.
4.1.2  Compensation of Discontinuity Reactances
The planar waveguide analysis approach discussed in Section. 4.1.1 has been used 
not only for characterizing microstrip discontinuities but also for the compensation 
of microstrip discontinuity reactances. The compensation of discontinuity reac-
tances [8] involves a modification of the discontinuity’s geometrical configuration 
so as to minimize its adverse effects on the performance of microstrip circuits. This 
compensation has been reported [8] for three types of discontinuities: step junc-

tions, right-angled bends, and T-junctions. A combination of the segmentation and 
desegmentation methods [3] has been used in these cases. The computed results for 
these three types of compensated discontinuities are shown in Figures 4.15 to 4.17. 
For the sake of comparison, the characteristics of the uncompensated discontinui-
ties are also shown in these three cases.
4.1.3  Radiation and Parasitic Coupling
Because of the open nature of the microstrip configuration, hybrid and monolithic 
microwave circuits suffer from radiation originating at various geometrical discon-
tinuities. Two consequences of this radiation phenomenon are additional signal 
loss in the circuit and undesired interactions between different parts of the circuit 
due to external electromagnetic coupling. These phenomena can become signifi-
cant in three different situations. First, when attempts are made to increase circuit 
density in monolithic microwave circuits, more bends and other discontinuities are 
introduced and spurious electromagnetic coupling increases considerably. Second, 
Figure 4.15  Reflection coefficients for the uncompensated and compensated step discontinuities 
with 1:2 impedance ratio (from [8],  1982 IEEE. Reprinted with permission.).

210
Microstrip Discontinuities II: Fullwave Analysis and Measurements 
in microstrip antenna arrays, relatively thicker substrates are used and the feed 
networks printed on these substrates can result in substantial spurious radiation. 
Third, in multichip modules, microstrip interconnects that have bends and junction 
discontinuities introduce EM coupling between various parts of the module, which 
degrades RF performance.
Radiation from Microstrip Discontinuities
Three different approaches for addressing the issue of radiation from microstrip 
discontinuities have been reported in the literature. These are:
1.	 The Poynting vector method based on longitudinal electric currents and 
polarization currents associated with discontinuities [9, 10];
2.	 The equivalent magnetic current formulation based on two-dimensional 
planar analysis [11];
3.	 Fullwave analysis methods incorporating radiation phenomenon [12].

mally compensated right-angled bends (from [8],  1982 IEEE. Reprinted with permission.).

Microstrip Lines and Slotlines
211
Poynting Vector Method
In this approach, the source of radiation is described as a line current in the middle 
of the strip conductor, and, in the case of a microstrip open circuit, a polarization 
current flowing perpendicular to it. For other discontinuities, different polariza-
tion effects are associated with the longitudinal currents. The Poynting vector is 
calculated in the far field, and the total radiated power is calculated there from. 
The method is limited to narrow strip transmission lines with W  l0 and thin 
substrates with h  l0 having discontinuities of small extent. The air-substrate lay-
ers are represented by a homogeneous dielectric with a relative dielectric constant 
equal to ere of the microstrip line. Using this approach, the ratio of the radiated 
power to the incident power can be expressed as
	
Prad /Pinc = 2πη0 ⋅h/λ0
(
)
2 ⋅Fi /Z0m 	
(4.35)
where Fi is the dimensionless radiation factor that characterizes the specific radia-
tion properties of the discontinuity and is dependent only on er. The expressions

T-junctions (impedance ratio 1/ 2:1:1) (from [8],  1982 IEEE. Reprinted with permission.).

212
Microstrip Discontinuities II: Fullwave Analysis and Measurements 
for Fi for various discontinuities are summarized in [10]. The microstrip line is de-
scribed by its characteristic impedance Z0m. The power radiated by surface waves is 
ignored (as h/l0  1) as compared with the free-space power. It is important to note 
that the radiated power is proportional to (h/l0)2, a result that is consistent with the 
behavior of narrow-width rectangular microstrip patch antennas [13].
Equivalent Magnetic Current Formulation [11]
This approach is an extension of the planar waveguide model used for characteri-
zation of microstrip discontinuities discussed in Section 4.1.1. To evaluate the ra-
diation field produced by microstrip discontinuities, the multiport network model 
is used to find the voltage distribution around the edges of the discontinuity con-
figuration. This voltage distribution is expressed as an equivalent magnetic current 
distribution, which is used to compute the resultant radiation fields.
The procedure is similar to that developed earlier [14] for microstrip patch 
antennas. To implement this method, we add a number of open ports at the edges 
of the discontinuity structure from which the radiation (or spurious external cou-
pling) is being evaluated. This is shown in Figure 4.18(a, b) for a right-angled bend 
and a compensated right-angled bend, respectively.
Lengths of transmission lines on two sides of the junction are made large enough 
so that the higher order evanescent modes produced by the discontinuities decay 
out at the locations of external ports 1 and 2. The circuit behavior is simulated by 
terminating port 2 in a matched load and adding a matched source to port 1. Volt-
ages at the N ports at the edges are computed by using the following procedure.
1.	 The configuration is broken down in elementary regular segments, connected 
at the interfaces by a discrete number of interconnections.
2.	 Z-matrices for each of these elementary segments are evaluated by using the 
Green’s function approach for individual geometries.
3.	 Individual Z-matrices obtained in step 2 are combined by using the segmen-
tation formula.
4. 	The overall multiport Z-matrix is used to calculate voltages at the N edge 
ports for a unit current input at port 1.
As mentioned earlier, a similar procedure has been used for the design of micro-
strip patch antennas [14] also. The only distinction in the latter case is the use of 
edge admittance networks (containing equivalent radiation conductances) that are 
connected to the edge ports. Because of the nonresonant nature of the microstrip 
discontinuity structures, the radiated power is small and the edge voltages may be 
assumed to be unaffected by radiation conductances involved. However, for a more 
accurate assessment of the radiated power, radiation conductance networks may 
be added to edge ports and iterative computations may be carried out to evaluate 
radiation fields.
Voltages at the discontinuity edges are represented by equivalent magnetic 
current sources as shown in Figure 4.18(c, d). Each of the magnetic current line 
sources is divided into small sections over which the field may be assumed to be 
uniform. The amplitude M of each of the magnetic current elements is twice that 
of the edge voltage at that location, and the phase of M is equal to the phase of the

corresponding voltage. The total radiation is computed using the superposition of 
the far field radiated by each section. Referring to the coordinate system, shown in 
Figure 4.18(e), the far-field pattern may be written in terms of voltages at the vari-
ous elements. With the voltage at the ith element expressed as V(i) eja(i), we have

To identify the regions of the discontinuity configuration that contribute domi-
nantly to the radiated power, several computations were performed by taking dif-
ferent regions around the discontinuity. These computations show that in most of 
the cases the biggest contribution to the radiated power is due to ports in the region 
of the discontinuity itself. The results for a 50-Ω, right-angled bend, as shown in 
Table 4.1, illustrate this point.
Radiation from a Right-Angled Microstrip Bend: Results for the power radiated by 
a 90° bend normalized with respect to the input power are shown in Figure 4.19 
for frequency ranges from 10 GHz to 40 GHz. These results are in good agreement, 
with results based on the complex Poynting vector method, which are also plotted 
in Figure 4.19. The radiation loss at 40 GHz is a 0.0062 dB for a 50-Ω line bend 
on a GaAs (er = 12.9) substrate. The values for radiation loss from a 90° bend in 
a 50-Ω line on a substrate with er = 2.2 at 30 GHz and 40 GHz are 0.1 dB and  
0.17 dB, respectively.
Radiation from a Microstrip Step Junction: The power radiated from a step junc-
tion discontinuity, with a change in impedance from 50 Ω to 10 Ω, on a er = 2.2 
substrate with a thickness of 0.79 mm is plotted in Figure 4.20. A similar computa-
tion for a 50-Ω to 70.7-Ω junction (at 30 GHz, er = 2.2, thickness 0.02 in) yields

0.18 dB. It is found that for such a T-junction most of the contribution to the radia-
tion loss originates from the region of the junction.
Radiation Evaluated from Fullwave Analysis
Fullwave analysis methods for the characterization of microstrip discontinuities 
are discussed in Section 4.2. When these analyses are conducted without using any 
enclosure or shield above the microstrip structure [12], the radiation effect gets 
incorporated in the discontinuity characterization. However, the computation of 
power radiated by discontinuities based on fullwave analysis has not been reported

extensively. A general consensus is that for thin substrates used for microwave 
hybrid and monolithic circuit applications, radiation loss from microstrip discon-
tinuities can be neglected.
Spurious Coupling Among Discontinuities
Parasitic coupling among different parts of a microstrip circuit caused by external 
fields produced by discontinuities is considered a more significant phenomenon 
than the radiation loss discussed above. Generally, in MMICs, matching networks 
are packed very closely together and have layout and junction discontinuity reac-
tances. Coupling occurs between the matching elements due to close proximity and 
can be accounted for by using EM simulators [17–22]. For long coupled lines on 
the order of a quarter wavelength, spacing between the lines must be 3W (width of 
line) or 3h (height of substrate)—whichever is greater—in order to reduce coupling 
effects. For short lines on the order of 1/10 wavelength, 1W or 1h spacing between 
the lines is adequate for most applications.
As shown in Figure 4.22, interaction effects take place between the closely-
spaced discontinuities due to coupling of fields from one discontinuity to another. 
The interaction between two discontinuities affects the isolated discontinuity re-
actance and must be accurately determined using EM simulators. The minimum 
distance between two discontinuities with the potential for coupling is 2W or 2h, 
whichever is greater. For T-junction and cross-junction discontinuities on thick sub-
strates (≥ 100 mm for GaAs and ≥ 250 mm for alumina), EM simulators are com-
monly used to accurately include their effects in the circuit design.
The spurious coupling between two discontinuities (due to the external fields) 
may be incorporated in the planar waveguide model-based analysis by connect-
ing an additional multiport network between the two discontinuities as shown in 
Figure 4.23. The multiport coupling network (MCN) is characterized in terms of 
an admittance matrix Ym. Elements of this matrix represent mutual admittances 
between various sections of the edges of the two discontinuities. The elements of 
the matrix Ym are obtained by representing the edge fields by small sections of 
length, dl, of equivalent magnetic current and by computing the magnetic field 
components Hq and Hr produced at the jth subsection of the nearby discontinuity.

the current induced in the jth subsection as a result of voltage, Vi, at the ith subsec-
tion.
	
Yji = Jjdj /Vi 	
(4.48)
The Z matrix of the mutual coupling network is the inverse of Ym. The segmenta-
tion method is used to combine the Z matrix representations of the discontinuities 
and the coupling network to yield the overall Z matrix. The Z matrix is con-
verted to S parameters. The effect of the coupling on the circuit performance is 
obtained from these S parameters. Cascaded step discontinuities have been treated 
by ­Kompa [16].
In addition to the above-mentioned approach, the spurious coupling among 
microstrip discontinuities can be derived from the fullwave electromagnetic analy-
sis discussed in the next section.
4.2  Fullwave Analysis of Discontinuities
As the operating frequency of microwave and millimeter-wave integrated circuits 
increases, the surface wave and radiation effects become more significant. To ac-
count for these phenomena and to accurately characterize various discontinuities, 
fullwave solutions (without making any assumptions) become essential. A num-

ber of electromagnetic analysis software packages based on fullwave analysis are 
now available commercially [17–22] for analyzing microstrip discontinuities and 
­circuits.
The development of fullwave simulation techniques has enabled microwave de-
signers and software vendors to characterize microstrip discontinuities accurately 
by using rigorous numerical methods with minimum analytical and numerical ap-
proximations.
One of the earliest fullwave analyses reported for microstrip discontinuities is 
Galerkin’s Method in Spectral Domain [23], which is an extension of the spectral 
domain analysis procedure discussed for a uniform microstrip line in Chapter 2. 
The integral equation approach based on the moment method solution in space 
domain [24, 25] has been more popular. Other fullwave numerical electromagnetic 
methods (such as the finite difference time domain technique [26]) have also been 
used to characterize microstrip discontinuities. These fullwave analysis methods 
are reviewed in this section.
4.2.1  Galerkin’s Method in the Spectral Domain [23]
Galerkin’s method in the spectral domain has been used for the fullwave analysis 
of microstrip open ends and gaps. The characterization of these two discontinuities 
can be carried out by analyzing suitably designed linear resonators. For an open 
end, one can consider a section of microstrip with open ends on each side, as shown 
in Figure 4.24. By carrying out a fullwave analysis for the resonance frequency of 
this structure, one can obtain the equivalent line length contributed by the open 
end. The extent of the substrate can be finite in either one or both of the dimensions 
x and z. In the analysis reported in [23] the substrate is considered to be infinite 
along z and finite along the x-direction. In the x-direction two conducting planes 
(2L apart) are placed symmetrically with respect to the microstrip. A cover plate is 
located at y = H. The analysis of such a structure in the spectral domain requires 
a Fourier transform along the z-direction and a finite Fourier transform along x.
Details of Galerkin’s method in the spectral domain were discussed in Chap-
ter 2. The choice of the basis functions for currents on the strip is important for 
the numerical efficiency of the method. For the dominant mode of resonance, the 
following forms for Jz and Jx are suitable:

After performing various steps of Galerkin’s method in the spectral domain dis-
cussed in Section 2.3.1, a dispersion relation for the microstrip resonator is devel-
oped. This dispersion relation is solved for the resonant frequency. The microstrip 
open-end and gap discontinuities can be characterized by calculating the effective 
increase in length, Dl, of suitably designed microstrip resonators. For resonance 
one can write
	
2 + Δ

) = λm ⁄ 2

Open End
The effective increase in length, 2Dloc, for a microstrip resonator is determined 
from the method described above. From Dloc one can find the open-end discontinu-
ity capacitance, Coc by using (3.48). The frequency-dependent behavior of Coc can  
be found by calculating the resonant frequencies of microstrip resonators of differ-
ent lengths.
It may be pointed out that for frequencies up to about 10 GHz the quasi-static 
approach gives reasonably reliable results. At 8 GHz, for h = 0.66 mm, W/h =1.0, 
and er = 9.8, the measured value of Dloc is 0.021 ±0.001 mm [27], whereas the cor-
responding quasi-static value of Dloc calculated using (3.49) is 0.0206 mm.
Gap
Fullwave analysis of a gap discontinuity can also be carried out by using Galerkin’s 
method in the spectral domain. In this case, one considers two types of resonators. 
First, an analysis is carried out with conducting planes (electric walls) at z = 0 and z 
= 2L′. The latter dimension is chosen such that (2L′ - 2l) is equal to the gap spac-
ing. A second computation is carried out for magnetic walls at z = 0 and z = 2L′. 
For both of these computations, finite Fourier transforms are used along the x- and 
z-directions. Equivalent lengths, Dle and Dlm, for electric and magnetic walls, re-
spectively, are determined from the respective resonance frequencies of resonators. 
From Dle and Dlm two equivalent capacitances, Ce and Cm, are calculated. These 
capacitances are related to the discontinuity capacitances of p equivalent circuits of 
a gap (Figure 3.7a) by the following equations:
	
Cg = Ce - Cm
(
) /2 	
(4.53a)
	
Cp = Cm 	
(4.53b)
The spectral domain approach has also been used for discontinuities in open micro-
strips (without any shield or enclosing box). Again, open-end and gap discontinui-
ties have recieved more detailed attention [28–33].
The spectral domain approach is best suited for treating microstrip disconti-
nuities of simple shape, where the current distribution can be expanded using a 
set of basis functions having closed-form Fourier transform counterparts. Analysis 
involving semi-infinite long lines are ideal for this method since the current on these 
lines can be represented by a pair of forward and backward travelling waves, which 
in the Fourier transform plane are simple delta functions. Therefore, semi-infinite 
lines have been used as standard feeds in analyzing discontinuities in [30, 33]. 
However, since the current in and near the discontinuity region is not uniform, a 
different set of subsectional basis functions is needed to capture the junction effect. 

222
Microstrip Discontinuities II: Fullwave Analysis and Measurements 
This hybrid use of basis functions implies that each set of basis functions must be 
carefully defined over the structure, and different algorithms are needed to evaluate 
the moment integrals associated with each type of basis function. Also, to obtain 
accurate results, the spectral domain approach requires the precomputation of the 
propagation constant and/or transverse distribution of the current on each distinct 
feed strip [30, 33, 34].
4.2.2  Integral Equation Solution in the Space Domain
As mentioned earlier, the space domain solution of the integral equation for discon-
tinuity structures is a very versatile alternative to the spectral domain method. Spa-
tial domain evaluation provides more physical insight since the problem remains in 
the physical domain. For this approach, Green’s functions are numerically evalu-
ated first and treated as known functions in the integral equation. This implies that 
the selection of the expansion functions for the current is arbitrary, which renders 
the approach very versatile. Moreover, subsectional basis functions of simple form 
can be implemented with straightforward numerical algorithms using the spatial 
domain approach. Therefore, this approach provides an ideal base for a general 
solver and has been used in several electromagnetic simulators for microwave cir-
cuits. The groundwork for a mixed potential integral equation MPIE-based, spatial 
domain microstrip solver can be attributed to Mosig and Gardiol [24, 35].
The use of potentials is generally preferred in the spatial domain approach be-
cause the associated Green’s functions are better suited for numerical evaluations.

 denote the scattered and incident fields, respectively. The scalar 
Green’s functions, Gm and Ge, are associated with the potentials produced by a unit 
source on top of the grounded substrate. They are identified as Green’s functions 
of the magnetic and electric types, respectively. By evoking the continuity equation
	
∇⋅J

it can be shown that Gm is related to the surface current density while Ge is related 
to the surface charge density q. Thus, (4.54) can also be expressed in terms of the 
surface current and charge densities. For a single-layer grounded dielectric slab in 
open space, these Green’s functions can be expressed in terms of Sommerfeld inte-
grals as [36, 37]

R is the distance between the source and observation points, t is the slab thickness, 
and k0 is the free-space propagation constant. Since these kernels are a function 
of R, they can be precomputed for a given range of R. Once they are known, the 
integral equation (4.54) can be solved readily in the spatial domain.
Several results for discontinuities’ characterizations based on this method are 
available in [24, 25]. Electromagnetic simulators based on this approach have been 
used by several microwave circuit CAD software developers to derive models for 
microstrip discontinuities.
4.2.3  Time Domain Methods for Microstrip Discontinuity Characterization
In addition to the frequency domain methods discussed so far, time domain tech-
niques for electromagnetic analysis can be used for the characterization of mi-
crostrip discontinuities and, in general, for the characterization of microstrip cir-
cuits. The finite-difference time domain (FDTD) approach [26, 38] is most popular 
among the various time domain methods available. The transmission line matrix 
(TLM) approach could be used as well for this purpose [39].
The key feature of the time domain analysis results from the fact that an im-
pulse response contains all the information of a system for the whole frequency 
range. Thus, a wide frequency range characterization of discontinuities can be ob-
tained by using a pulse excitation in the time domain and evaluating the Fourier 
transform of the time domain pulse response.
Among various time domain methods, FDTD is the most direct from a math-
ematical point of view and is based on time and space discretizations of Maxwell’s 
equations:

where the subscript i emphasizes different values of er to be used in substrate and 
air regions. To simulate the wave propagation in three dimensions, the spatial node 
points where different values of E and H are to be calculated are arranged in a 
mesh configuration. A unit cell of this mesh is shown in Figure 4.25. A repetitive 
arrangement of such cells fills the computational domain. Every component of the 

224
Microstrip Discontinuities II: Fullwave Analysis and Measurements 
magnetic field H can be obtained by the loop integral of the electric field E using 
the four surrounding nodal E values according to Maxwell’s curl equation for E. 
A similar approach is used for the calculation of H. As a result of this procedure, 
not only the placements of the E and H nodes are off in space by half a space step, 
but the time instants when the E or H field are calculated are also off by half a time 
step. This gives rise to a “leap frog” algorithm with components of E being calcu-
lated at nDt and components of H being calculated at (n + 1/2) Dt, where Dt is the 
discretization unit in time. The resulting finite difference equations are of central 
difference form and of second-order accuracy. They are given by

The indice­s i, j, and k define the positions of the field nodes. Distances between the 
nodes are Dx = Dy = Dz = Dh. For any finite-difference scheme, a stability condition 
must be found that guarantees that the numerical error generated in one step of 
the calculation does not accumulate and grow. The stability condition for the “leap 
frog” algorithm is given by
	
vmax ⋅Δt ≤
1
1/Δx2 + 1/Δy2 + 1/Δz2
	
(4.62)
For the special case of Dx = Dy = Dz = Dh, the above condition becomes

(4.63)
where vmax is the maximum signal phase velocity in the configuration being con-

The excitation pulse most commonly used for FDTD computations is Gauss-
ian in shape. It has a smooth waveform in time, and its Fourier transform is also a 
Gaussian pulse centered at zero frequency. This property makes a Gaussian pulse 
a perfect choice for investigating the frequency-dependent characteristics of micro-
strip discontinuities.
Another important consideration in implementing a FDTD algorithm is the 
use of an “absorbing boundary condition” to confine the computational space and 
thus keep the computer memory requirements to a reasonable size. Until recently, 
approximations in the absorbing boundary were the principal bottleneck, respon-
sible for the limited accuracy of FDTD results. However, the introduction of the 
perfectly matched layer (PML) by Berenger [40, 41] is a major breakthrough in 
reducing the FDTD errors due to the absorbing boundary condition. The basic 
concept of this PML can be considered as an extension of the well-known fact that 
the condition
	
σ ⁄ε0 = σ ∗⁄µ0 	
(4.64)
provides for the reflectionless transmission of a plane wave propagating normally 
across the interface between free space (e0, m0, s = 0) and the outer boundary layer 
(with s and s* as electric conductivity and magnetic conductivity, respectively.)

Microstrip Discontinuities II: Fullwave Analysis and Measurements 
Let us consider the extension of (4.64) to PMLfor a two-dimensional trans-
verse electric (TE to z-direction) case with field components Ex, Ey, and Hz and 
with the computation grid in the (x-y)-plane. The PML technique splits the Hz 
field into two components, Hzx and Hzy, and introduces (sx, s*x) and (sy, s*y) pairs 
both of which satisfy the relation (4.64). Under these conditions, it can be shown 
that the wave in the PML medium propagates with exactly the speed of light but 
decays exponentially along x and y. Also, the wave impedance of the PML medium 
exactly equals that of vacuum, regardless of the angle of propagation or frequency. 
The TM case can be treated by duality by splitting Ez into Ezx and Ezy. In the three 
dimensional case, all six components of the field vectors are split and the result-
ing PML modification of Maxwell’s equations yields 12 equations. PML matching 
conditions are analogous.
Figure 4.26 shows the finite-difference computational domain used for the mi-
crostrip open-end discontinuity characterization problem [26]. Due to symmetry, 
only half of the structure is placed in the mesh domain with a magnetic wall at 
the plane of symmetry. These computations yield the total E-field at the open end.

For S11 calculations, the incident field is obtained from that of an infinitely long 
microstrip, and the reflected field from the open end is obtained from the difference 
between the total open-end field and the incident field. When an equivalent circuit 
(a parallel combination of G(f) and C(f)) is used to model the microstrip open end, 
the resulting values are plotted in Figure 4.27 [26]. Spectral domain analysis results 
of [31] are also shown in the figure. The amount of discrepancy seen, especially for 
higher frequencies, raises question about both sets of results. G(f) values given in 
[31] do not exhibit a trend to go down smoothly to zero as the frequency goes to 
dc. The major difference in C(f) behavior is in the increase in C(f) value with fre-
quency (before ultimately going down) seen in time domain analysis results. Such 
a behavior has also been seen in some other frequency domain analysis [42, 43]. 
Perhaps, refinements in implementation of both of these approaches are needed 
before any comparative conclusions can be drawn.
4.3  Discontinuity Measurements
Often experimental validation of microstrip discontinuities becomes necessary to 
test the accuracy of numerical results. Methods for accurately measuring micro-
strip discontinuities are based on the technique of incorporating discontinuities in 
microstrip resonators and measuring the change in the resonance frequency. Since 
these resonators are coupled very loosely to the test equipment, the measurements 
are not affected by the uncertain characteristics of coaxial-to-microstrip transitions. 
Both linear and ring resonators have been used for discontinuity measurements.
Two (or more) resonators need to be fabricated and tested for complete discon-
tinuity characterization. The use of these resonators to measure the phase velocity 
in a microstrip was discussed in Section 1.5.3. The effect of microstrip disconti-

Microstrip Discontinuities II: Fullwave Analysis and Measurements 
nuities can also be determined accurately by measuring the scattering parameters. 
Measurements of discontinuities using resonators and scattering parameters meth-
ods are discussed in this section.
4.3.1  Linear Resonator Method
This method [27, 44, 45] uses a linear microstrip resonator that incorporates the 
discontinuity to be tested and is lightly coupled to the measuring instrumentation 
through a microstrip gap. The linear resonator is obtained by a nlm/2 length of 
a microstrip section open at the two ends. Thus the microstrip open end and the 
microstrip gap constitute essential parts of this measuring arrangement and must 
be calibrated before measurements on any other discontinuity may be carried out.
To minimize significant effects due to the change in substrate properties and 
fabrication, it is necessary to measure the effective dielectric constant ere for each 
circuit either by adding a linear resonator alongside each test configuration or by 
etching the test configuration to a suitable form and making a second measurement 
of the resonant frequency. The careful use of the latter strategy realizes the advan-
tages of a substitutional method and will be illustrated in the method for charac-
terization of microstrip gaps discussed in the following paragraph.
Open Ends and Gaps
An arrangement for characterization of the open end and the gap is shown in 
Figure 4.28(a). The length l is chosen so that the effective length of this section at 
the frequency of measurement is nlm/2 where n is an integer and lm the microstrip 
wavelength. The length l′ should have an effective length of lm/4. The free-space 
wavelength for the resonance of the structure, as shown in Figure 4.28(a), is then 
given by
	
+ 2Δg
(
) = n
2
λ0
εre 	
(4.65)
where Dlg is the extra length contributed by the microstrip gap. The equivalent cir-
cuit used for the gap is shown in Figure 3.17. The next step involves selective etch-
ing of length l′. The resonance wavelength is measured again after l′ is removed 
(Figure 4.28(b)). Equation (4.65) can now be modified as

where Dloc is the equivalent line length associated with an open end. There are 
three unknowns appearing in (4.65) and (4.66), namely, Dlg, Dloc and ere. So an ad-
ditional measurement is required. If two values of l are chosen to given resonance 
frequencies for different n close to the normal frequency of measurement, then one 
measurement with l′ present, together with two measurements (for different values 
of l) with the extra section l′ removed, are sufficient to give ere, Dloc, and Dlg. Suit-
able choices of resonant mode, n, and lengths l have to be made such that various 
resonant frequencies are close together and ere can be taken as constant over this 
frequency range.
It has been mentioned [27] that this method has an experimental uncertainty 
of ±10 mm, which is largely attributable to substrate variations. This uncertainty 
corresponds to about ±0.005Y0 at 10 GHz.
Right-Angled Bends and Steps in Width
Variations of the procedure described above may also be used for other discon-
tinuities. The arrangement for characterization of a right-angled bend [27, 44] 
and its equivalent circuit are shown in Figure 4.29. Two resonators of different 
lengths are needed to determine the two unknowns (B and Dlb) in the equiva-
lent circuit. These resonators will either have a voltage minimum or a volt-
age maximum at the corner, according to whether the effective overall length  
(2l1 + 2Dlb + Dloc + Dlg) or (2l2 + 2Dlb + Dloc + Dlg) at resonance is an odd or an 
even number of half wavelengths. For example, in the case of a half-wave resona-

equivalent circuit of the right-angled bend.

230
Microstrip Discontinuities II: Fullwave Analysis and Measurements 
tor, there will be a voltage minimum at the corner of the bend and the effective 
increase in length will be 2Dlb. On the other hand, for a fullwave resonator the 
presence of a voltage maximum at the corner will cause the shunt susceptance B to 
increase the effective length of the fullwave resonator by an amount (lm/p)  tan–1 
(B/2Y0). The relation for resonance frequency may now be written as
	
2 + Δb + Δoc + Δg

(4.67)
Thus the series and the shunt components of the equivalent circuit can be separat-
ed. Since ere, Dloc and Dlg are known from previous measurements, the parameters 
of the equivalent circuit shown in Figure 4.29(b) may be determined from the two 
frequencies of resonance.
A similar arrangement can be used to determine equivalent circuit parameters 
of a step continuity. The circuit arrangement is shown in Figure 4.30. Two resona-
tors are used. Their lengths are adjusted so that in one case (i) we have a voltage
maximum at the step, while in the other case (ii) we have a voltage minimum at the 
step. Note that microstrip wavelengths lm and l′m correspond to microstrip lines 
of widths W and W′, respectively, and are not equal. Also in this case, we need the 
previous characterization of ere, Dloc, and Dlg for two widths W and W′.
T-Junctions
A T-junction, its equivalent circuit, and circuit arrangement for its characterization 
[27] are shown in Figure 4.31. Only a symmetrical T-junction, with its through arm 
having the same impedance on either side of the branch, is considered.
The circuit of Figure 4.31(b) enables an accurate determination of the line 
length la by determining the resonance of the half wavelength along the through 
arm before and after removing the stub. It may be pointed out that the susceptance 
B is ineffective because of the presence of a voltage minimum at the location of B. 
The length lb may be obtained from the frequency of peak attenuation when the 
stub arm of Figure 4.31(c) is an odd number of quarter wavelengths long. Due to 
the shunt resonance of the stub, peak attenuation is a strong function of stub length. 
The end effect of the open end of the stub is assumed to be known from previous 
measurements. The configuration of Figure 4.31(d) enables B to be determined. 
The impedance ratio n2 is measured by using the configuration shown in Figure 
Figure 4.30  Circuit layouts for measuring the equivalent circuit of a step discontinuity: (a) with 
voltage maximum at the step and (b) with voltage minimum at the step.

Microstrip Lines and Slotlines
231
4.31(e). Values of B and n2 depend on previous measurements, but some cancel-
lation in the uncertainty can be obtained if the stub in Figure 4.31(d) is etched off 
and measurements carried out to obtain ere from resonance of the “through arm.” 
The accuracy of determining n2 has been estimated [27] as ±2 percent. It may be 
noted that the transformation ratio n does not affect the resonance frequency for 
the configurations (b) to (d) because of the presence of an open or short circuit at 
plane XX (Figure 4.31(a)).
Measurements for a symmetrical cross junction may also be made by using 
circuits of Figures 4.31(b, c, d, and e) and taking advantage of the symmetry of the 
junction. Similar measurement techniques may also be designed for other discon-
tinuity structures.
The main advantage of the linear resonator method is that it involves shorter 
lengths that result in better accuracy. Since this method uses the open ends of the 
resonator, it is necessary to characterize the open ends accurately. This is one of the 
disadvantages associated with this method. The other disadvantage of this method 
is the need for fabricating a set of resonators for each frequency of interest. These 
problems are overcome in the ring resonator method, which is discussed in the next 
section.

4.3.2  Ring Resonator Method
Ring resonators were described in Section 1.5 during the discussion of measure-
ment of microstrip phase velocities. When a ring resonator is used in place of a 
linear resonator as discussed above, the open-end and gap reactances need not be 
calibrated and taken into account. This method is convenient particularly for sym-
metrical two-port discontinuities (with S11 = S22).
A microstrip ring structure resonates if its electrical length is an integral mul-
tiple of the guide wavelength. When a discontinuity is introduced into the ring, 
each resonance degenerates into two distinct modes. This splitting is conveniently 
interpreted in terms of even and odd excitations of the discontinuity [46]. The even 
mode corresponds to the incidence of two waves of equal magnitude and phase 
upon the discontinuity; while in the odd mode, waves of equal magnitude but op-
posite phase are incident from two sides. Anyone of these resonances can be excited 
by an appropriate choice of the point of excitation along the ring. In an experimen-
tal setup [46], this is achieved by shifting the position of the launcher along the ring 
as shown in Figure 4.32.
A symmetrical discontinuity, may be represented in terms of a T-network as 
shown in Figure 4.33(a). Parameters of the T-network can be evaluated from the 
two impedances Zie and Zio shown in Figure 4.33(b) and obtained by introducing 
an open circuit and a short circuit, respectively, at the z = 0 plane. These imped-
ances can be expressed in terms of two fictitious electrical lenghts le and lo (shown 
in Figure 4.33(c)) as
(even case) 	 Zie = Z11 + Z12 = -j cotke
(even case) 	
(4.68a)
(odd case) 	
Zio = Z11 - Z12 = j tanko
(odd case) 	
(4.68b)
where k = 2p/lm is the propagation constant along the ring resonator and all the 
impedances have been normalized to the characteristic impedance of the microstrip 
ring. These equivalent lengths le and lo add to the total length of the ring for even

and odd excitations, respectively, as shown in Figure 4.34(a, b). Resonance condi-
tions for the two cases may be written as

where lme and lmo are guide wavelengths corresponding to the even and odd mode 
resonance frequencies, respectively. lring is the physical length of the ring resonator 
along the mean circumference. Equations (4.68) to (4.70) may be used to evaluate 
Z11 and Z12 and hence the equivalent circuit.
This method can also be extended for unsymmetrical discontinuities. An exam-
ple of characterization of impedance steps in a ring resonator is given in reference 
[47]. The circuit arrangement used is shown in Figure 4.35. Two steps are located 
such that lengths l1 and l2 are electrically equal. A voltage maximum or minimum 
can be arranged to appear at the discontinuity locations successively by changing 
the point of excitation. Shunt and series parts of equivalent circuits are thus sepa-
rated.

4.3.3  Scattering Parameters Measurement Method
With recent advancements in de-embedding techniques and RF probes, the discon-
tinuity equivalent circuit model parameters can also be determined accurately from 
1-port or 2-port scattering parameter measurements. The model parameters are 
extracted by computer optimization, which correlates the calculated and measured 
S-parameters. The model parameter values can be obtained to the same accuracy as 
Figure 4.37  Scattering parameters of the two-step configuration shown. Numerical (experimental) 
dimensions: W1 = 9.2 (9.2) mil, W2 = 23 (23.1) mil, L = 50.6 (50.0) mil, er = 9.9, h = 10 mil. (a)

the measurement accuracy by using recently developed on-wafer sapphire substrate 
calibration standards and the thru-reflect-line (TRL) calibration method. The TRL 
calibration method is based on the transmission line calibration standards, which 
include nonzero thru, a reflect (open or short), and delay line standards (one or 
more dictated by the frequency range over which the calibration is performed). The 
advantage of the TRL calibration lies in simple standards that can be placed on the 
same substrate as the components ensuring a common transmission medium.
Figure 4.36 shows examples of structures that can be tested for 2-port S-­
parameters to characterize right-angle bend, step-in-width, and T-junction micro-
strip discontinuities. The minimum distance between the two discontinuities (right 
angle bend and step-in width) must be kept to 2 to 3 line widths or substrate 
thicknesses, whichever is greater, so that the interaction effects between the dis-
continuities due to evanescent modes are negligible. Figures 4.37 and 4.38 show 
a comparison between the numerical and measured S-parameters for the step-in 
width and T-junction discontinuities, respectively [48]. The measured results were 
obtained using RF probes and agrees very well with the fullwave analysis values.

Slotlines
5.1	
Introduction
A slotline is a planar transmission structure proposed for use in MICs by Cohn in 
1968 [1]. The basic slotline configuration is shown in Figure 5.1. It consists of a 
dielectric substrate with a narrow slot etched in the metallization on one side of the 
substrate. The other side of the substrate is without any metallization. The geom-
etry is planar and, as mentioned earlier in Chapter 1, is well suited for its usage in 
microwave integrated circuits.
Slotlines can be included in microstrip circuits by etching the slotline circuit in 
the ground plane of the substrate for microstrip circuits. This type of hybrid com-
bination allows flexibility in the design of microwave circuits and has led to some 
new types of circuits such as hybrid branchline directional couplers. Also, some of 
the circuit elements, which cannot easily be achieved in microstrip configuration, 
can be incorporated in the slotline part of the circuit. These, for example, could be 
short circuits, high impedance lines, series stubs, and baluns. Slotlines can also be 
employed as a resonant or nonresonant antenna.
In a slotline, the wave propagates along the slot with the major electric field 
component oriented across the slot in the plane of metallization on the dielectric 
substrate. The mode of propagation is non-TEM and almost transverse electric 
in nature. However, unlike conventional waveguides, there is no low-frequency 
cutoff, because the slotline is a two-conductor structure. The approximate field 
distribution in a slotline is shown in Figure 5.2. This near-field distribution has 
been discussed by Cohn [2].
The various methods used for the analysis of a slotline are described in the 
following section. Design considerations for the slotline, short-end and open-end 
discontinuities, transitions from slotline to microstrip and coaxial line, and some 
circuit applications of slotlines are discussed in this chapter.

Slotline Analysis
The slotline was first analyzed by Cohn [1]. He employed the transverse resonance 
approach after converting the slotline into a waveguide configuration. Since then, 
a number of other techniques have been employed. Some of these analytical tech-
niques are:

5.2.1  Approximate Analysis
Before attempting a rigorous analysis, it is worthwhile to look at an approximate 
solution for slotline characteristics. This has the advantage of mathematical sim-
plicity and provides a better qualitative picture. An approximate analysis for the 
field distribution, polarization of magnetic field, and expression for slot wavelength 
are presented below.
Field Distribution
For a waveguiding structure to be useful as a transmission line or a circuit element, 
it is necessary to confine the fields near the structure. An analysis of the field distri-
bution of the transmission line structure is helpful in determining the parameters 
necessary to prevent the spreading of the fields.
The slotline field contains six components: three electric field components and 
three magnetic field components. The longitudinal component of the electric field 
is very weak since the energy propagates between the two conductors. If the slot 
width W is much smaller than the free-space wavelength l0, the electric field across 
the slot may be represented by an equivalent line source of magnetic current, and 
then the far-field contains only three components: Hx, Hr, and Ef. At a distance 
r ( W) in the air region above the slot (Figure 5.3), these may be written as [1]
	
Hx = AH0

Slotlines
Therefore, if kcr is imaginary, the field will decay with distance r. Equation (5.4) 
shows that kcr is imaginary for ls/l0 < 1. Hence a relative wavelength ratio less 
than unity is a sufficient condition to ensure transverse decay of the field. To a zero- 
order approximation, ls/l0 is equal to 2 ⁄ (εr + 1). As ls/l0 is decreased, that is, er 
increased, the rate of decay becomes faster and fields become more tightly bound 
to the slot. For example, the ratio of voltage V(r) at a distance r equal to one inch 
(2.54 cm) to the voltage V directly across the slot on a substrate with er = 16 is 
calculated (at 3 GHz) to be

(5.6)
Information regarding the rate of decay of fields is also helpful in determining the 
size of the enclosure needed for the slotline. 
Polarization of the Magnetic Field
The polarization of the magnetic field in a slotline can be obtained from the ratio 
|Hx/Hr|. Equations (5.1) and (5.2) give

From the mathematical tables it is evident that H 1
(1)
 (j|r|) is always greater than  
H 0
(1)
 (j|r|) and also ls < l0. Therefore, |Hx| is always less than |Hr|, and the magnetic 
field cannot have circular polarization. Nevertheless elliptical polarization exists 
for all values of r.
The field configuration shown in Figure 5.2 indicates that the magnetic field 
has regions of elliptical polarization both in the air region above the slot and on the 
conducting surface constituting the slot. These regions of elliptical polarization can 
be utilized for the construction of nonreciprocal ferrite components. Robinson and 
Allen [9] have used slotline in the construction of ferrite devices.

Slot Wavelength
As shown in Figure 5.2, slotline field components are not confined to the substrate 
alone. They extend into the air regions above the slot and below the substrate 
also. Therefore, the energy is distributed between the substrate and the air regions. 
Consequently, the effective dielectric constant for a slotline (ere) is less than the 
substrate permittivity ere Galejs [10] has shown that the zeroth-order value of er for 
a slot on an infinitely thick substrate is the average dielectric constant of the two 
media, that is,
	
εre = εr + 1

(5.8)
and therefore,

(5.9)
It has been observed by Garg and Gupta [11] that for slotline on a finite thickness 
substrate, the above value of ls/l0 is approached for the cutoff thickness for the TE0 
surface wave mode. The cutoff thickness (h/l0)c is given by
	
(h⁄λ0)c = 0.25 ⁄
εr - 1 	
(5.10)
The approximate analysis discussed above gives a good physical picture of the field 
configuration of the slotline. But it does not lead to an evaluation of the character-
istic impedance of the slotline. Moreover, the variation of slot wavelength ls with 
different geometrical parameters of the slotline, that is, h, W and b, is not pro-
vided by this analysis. To overcome these shortcomings, several rigorous analyses 
of slotline have been carried out [1–8, 12–15]. These analyses take into account the 
effects of various parameters on the slotline impedance Z0s and the wavelength ls. 
Some of these analyses are described next.
5.2.2  Transverse Resonance Method
In this method, a slotline is analyzed as a rectangular waveguide configuration. The 
key feature of this analysis is the introduction of boundary walls such that a rectan-
gular waveguide configuration with a capacitive iris is obtained. It is then analyzed 
in terms of waveguide modes propagating perpendicular to the slotline plane.
Development of Waveguide Model
A waveguide model for a slotline is obtained by introducing (i) conducting planes 
normal to the slot and the substrate at x = 0 and x = a such that a = ls/2 as shown 
in Figure 5.4(a). Since the spacing between the two planes is ls/2, the introduction 
of these planes does not disturb the field variations. A standing wave field configu-
ration with Ey and Ez equal to zero at x = 0 and x = a is obtained. (ii) Next, electric 
walls or magnetic walls are inserted in planes parallel to the slot and perpendicular 

244
Slotlines
to the substrate at y = ± b/2 as shown in Figure 5.4(b, c). Since the fields are tightly 
bound to the slot, the walls at y = ± b/2 will have a negligible effect when the dis-
tance b is sufficiently large. Introduction of electric walls creates a configuration 
of a capacitive iris in a rectangular waveguide as shown in Figure 5.4(d). The two 
cases of electric walls and magnetic walls are analyzed separately.
Slot Wavelength
Having developed the capacitive iris waveguide model the method of transverse 
resonance is applied to determine the slot wavelength. In this method the sum of 
susceptances at the iris plane is equated to zero.
This sum includes the susceptances of the TE 10 mode looking in the +z and 
-z directions and the capacitive iris susceptance due to higher order modes on 
Figure 5.4  Development of the rectangular waveguide model for slotline analysis using the trans-
verse resonance method: (a) The configuration, (b) model with electric walls, (c) model with mag-
netic walls, and (d) resulting configuration of an iris in a waveguide.

both sides of the iris (the TE10 mode cannot exist for the magnetic wall case).  
The introduction of magnetic walls or electric walls at y = ± b/2 gives rise to differ-
ent sets of modes. These sets are TE1, 2n and TM1,2m where n is an integer ≥ 0 and  
m ≥ 1 for electric walls, and n or m = 1/2, 3/2, 5/2 for magnetic walls.
Two separate expressions for the total susceptance hBt for the electric wall and 
magnetic wall cases are obtained. These are given in Appendix 5.A.
Evaluation of Slot Wavelength
Roots of the equation hBt = 0, with hBt given by (A.1) or (A.2) for the electric wall 
case or magnetic wall case, respectively, give the slot wavelength ls. It is a function 
of l0 also, unlike in a microstrip because the mode of propagation in the slotline is 
hybrid in nature.
Numerical computations by Cohn [1] show that, for large values of b, identi-
cal results are obtained for both the electric wall and magnetic wall models. In 
the specific case when er = 20, h = 3.48 mm, W = 0.625 mm, l0 = 10.67 cm, and 
ls =3.45 cm, the solutions for electric and magnetic walls approach each other for 
b > 38.1 mm and are only slightly different for b = 25.4 mm.
Slotline Impedance
Because of the non-TEM nature of the mode in a slotline, the characteristic imped-
ance Z0s cannot be defined uniquely. The definition based on the power-voltage 
relationship is used more frequently and may be written as [6]
	
Z0s = V
2 /2P 	
(5.11)
where V is the peak voltage across the slot. The average power P can be expressed 
in terms of energy storage Wt, which may be related to the rate of change of total 
susceptance Bt with frequency. For resonant cavities [16]
	
Wt =

and also since

we can write
	
Z0s = (v⁄vg)π ⁄(ω ∂Bt ⁄ ∂ω)

Evaluation of Slotline Impedance
For the given set of slotline parameters er, W, h, and b choose a small frequency 
interval ∆f centered around f, the frequency of operation. The value of ∆(ls/l0) is 
computed from two separate solutions of hBt = 0 for the two values of h/l0 corre-
sponding to the ends of the frequency interval. Using the value of ∆(ls/l0) in (5.15) 
gives the value of v/vg. The change in susceptance ∆(hBt) (needed for evaluating 
Z0s) is computed from (A.l) or (A.2) with ls held constant (ls is obtained from the 
value of ls/l0 at the frequency f) and p incremented slightly plus and minus from 
the value p = l0/ls at hBt = 0. (The two values of p are obtained from the two end 
values of l0 for the frequency interval ∆f selected.)
Computations of slot wavelength and impedance, based on the above method, 
have been carried out. They are shown in Figure 5.5 for er = 9.7. Mariani et al. [17] 
have also reported slotline characteristics for er = 9.6, 11.0, 13.0, 16.0, and 20.0.
The method of transverse resonance is valid for the following range of param-
eters
	
W < 0.25λ0 ⁄
εr 	
(5.16a)
	
W⁄h ≤1	
(5.16b)
	
b ≥7W 	
(5.16c)
Condition (5.16a) is necessary to avoid resonance across the slot. Although this 
method can also be used to determine the effect of the finite size of metal sheets 
enclosing the slot, it cannot be employed for wide slots (W/h > 1). The method 
described next does not suffer from this limitation.
5.2.3  Galerkin’s Method in the Spectral Domain
An accurate analysis of the slotline is based on the use of Galerkin’s method in 
the Fourier transform domain. This method is very popular and is similar to those 
used for fullwave analysis of microstrip lines (in Section 2.3.1) and for analysis of 
microstrip discontinuities (in Section 3.2.3).
Field components in a slotline are expressed in terms of two scalar potentials 
ye (x, y) and yh (x, y). The longitudinal components are proportional to these po-
tentials and are written as
	
Ez = kc
2ψ e(x,y)exp(±jβz)

(5.19)
Values of i specify the three regions of the slotline cross section as shown in Figure 
5.6. The next step is the Fourier transformation of the scalar wave equation along 
x. This transformation converts the second-order partial differential equation into 
an ordinary differential equation that can be solved easily. The solutions for trans-
forms of scalar potentials in the three regions may be written as

The eight unknown coefficients Ae through Dh are related to the tangential electric 
and magnetic field components at the interfaces y = 0 and y = h by the continuity 
conditions and can also be related to the surface current density on the metal and 
the electric fields in the slot at y = h. If the Fourier transforms of the x- and z-direct-
ed current densities are denoted by J˜x(a) and J˜z(a) and electric field components by 
E˜ x(a) and E˜ z(a), one obtains a set of coupled equations of the form

The matrix elements N1, . . . , N4 are known functions of a and b. Now E˜ x(a) 
and E˜ z(a) are expanded in terms of the Fourier transforms of basis functions, and 
Galerkin’s method is applied to yield a homogeneous system of linear equations. 
The determinant of the coefficient matrix, corresponding to this set of linear equa-
tions, equated to zero gives the dispersion relation. An iteration scheme for b can 
be used to find a nontrivial solution of this dispersion relation.
The rate of convergence of this series representation depends upon the choice 
of basis functions. A frequently used choice [6] is

The computations involved can be simplified by assuming Ez = 0. A comparison 
of the magnitudes of the x and z components of the electric field shows that Ez is 
about one-tenth of Ex and can therefore be neglected [4].
This method has also been used to evaluate the characteristic impedance of 
slotlines [6]. In the definition of characteristic impedance (5.11) the voltage across 
the slot is obtained by integrating the transverse electric field component Ex as
	
V =

α=0 = Ex(0) 	
(5.30)
The time-averaged power flow P along the slotline can be obtained as in (2.37). 
Again the computations involved can be simplified by neglecting Ez(x).
A comparison of results obtained by Galerkin's method in the spectral domain 
with Cohn’s method [1] indicates that the transverse resonance method used by 
Cohn yields accurate results for a slotline within the limits prescribed in (5.16). 
However, for wider slots one should use Galerkin’s method in the spectral domain.

Higher order modes in a slotline can also be determined using the above meth-
od. Citerne et al. [13] and Kitazawa et al. [14] have determined the propagation 
constant for the first higher order mode in a slotline using different techniques. 
Figure 5.7 shows the dispersion characteristics of the normalized propagation con-
stant b/k0 for the dominant and first higher order mode [14]. Computations show 
that one basis function is sufficient for the dominant mode, while two basis func-
tions are necessary for the first higher order mode. The numerical data are com-
pared with the results of Cohn [1], and the agreement is quite good.

Design Considerations
5.3.1  Closed-Form Expressions
The various methods of analysis discussed above do not lead to any closed-form 
expressions for slotline wavelength and impedance. This becomes a serious handi-
cap for circuit analysis and design especially when computer-aided design tech-
niques are used. Some attempts to overcome this difficulty have been reported 
[11]. Closed-form expressions given below have been obtained by curve fitting 
the result based on Cohn’s analysis. These expressions have an accuracy of about  
2 percent for the following range of parameters
	
9.7 ≤εr ≤20
0.02 ≤W⁄h ≤1.0
0.01 ≤h⁄λ0 ≤(h⁄λ0)c

substrate and is given by (5.10).

The logarithms in expressions (5.32) through (5.39) are to the base 10.
High er substrates are used for circuit applications to confine the field near the 
slot. Slotlines on low er substrates have interesting applications in antennas. Janas-
wamy and Schaubert [6] have obtained closed-form expressions for low er sub-
strates by curve fitting the numerical results obtained from Galerkin’s method in 
FTD. These expressions are as follows and are valid for the range of parameters [6]

wave and millimeter-wave frequency range.
5.3.2  Effect of Metal Thickness
It has been assumed in the analysis presented in Section 5.2 that the metal conductors 
constituting the slot have zero thickness, which does not reflect reality. Kitazawa et 
al. [14, 15] have evaluated the effect of finite metal thickness on the phase constant 
and characteristic impedance. It is observed that ls increases and the characteristic 
impedance decreases with the increase in metal thickness t. For er = 20, the increase 
in ls is about 1 percent, and the decrease in characteristic impedance is about  
2 percent for a t/W ratio of 0.02.

5.3.3  Effect of Tolerances
The effect of tolerances in various parameters on the performance of a slotline can 
be carried out using sensitivity analysis, as we did for the microstrip in Section 
2.4.3. The worst case behavior for a given set of tolerances is represented by the 
maximum change in characteristic impedance and slot wavelength. Expressions for 
these quantities are (for a fixed l0)

The sensitivity expressions can be obtained by using closed-form equations for 
Z0s and ls/l0. These expressions are given in Appendix 5.B for high er values and 
plotted as sensitivity curves in Figure 5.8 and 5.9 [18]. Sensitivity expressions for 
low er values can be similarly derived by using (5.40) to (5.47).
For a given set of slotline parameters the sensitivity values are calculated and 
substituted in (5.48) to determine (∆Z0s)max. This value of (∆Z0s)max may be used to 
calculate slotline VSWR. The inverse problem of determining the fabrication toler-
ance for a given set of other tolerances can be solved in the same manner as has 
been done for a microstrip in Section 2.4.3.

5.3.4  Losses in Slotline
The losses in a slotline, like those in a microstrip, are the result of the lossy di-
electric and the conductors with finite conductivity s. Dielectric loss ad can be 
computed by using a complex value for the relative permittivity, er, of the substrate 
in the evaluation of the propagation constant of the slotline. Due to the lossy sub-
strate the propagation constant becomes complex, g = b + ja, with a representing 
the dielectric loss ad in nepers/meter of the line. The dielectric loss in a slotline has 
been found to be of the same order as the loss tangent of the substrate [12].
Conductor loss ac cannot be obtained from Wheeler’s incremental inductance 
rule because the mode of propagation in a slotline is non-TEM in nature. In such a 
case one can follow the classical perturbation approach. In this approach conduc-
tor loss is evaluated by means of the energy dissipated by the lossless fields while 
propagating through the conductors with surface resistance Rs = ωπ0 ⁄ 2σ . The 
conductor attenuation constant ac, expressed in nepers/meter, is defined as

(5.54)
The actual evaluation of the integrals in (5.52) does not pose any problem as 
far as |Hz|2 is concerned, because this field component is regular along the edges  
|x| = W/2. However, |Hx|2 = |Jz|2 is singular along the edges and diverges as  
(x2 – [W/2]2)–1. This is a nonintegrable singularity. Rozzi et al. [12] overcame this 
difficulty by arguing that due to the effect of the small but finite thickness of the 
conductors, the actual edge behavior of the longitudinal current falls between the 
r–1/2 type and r–1/3 type. They assumed a current distribution of the following type 
(for |x| ≥ W/2)
	
Jz ∝2 x

⎝
⎜
⎞
⎠
⎟
−1/3

(5.55)
The above current distribution has the required edge behavior and qualitatively cor­
rect far field dependence. Now, the singularity of |Jz|2 is of the type (x2 – [W/2]2)–2/3, 
which poses no convergence problem.
Das and Pozar [19] have circumvented the problem of singularity of a current 
at the slot edges by using the finite conductivity of metal conductors and enforc-
ing the proper impedance boundary conditions and by solving for the complex 
propagation constant. Results for the conductor loss of a slotline [19, Figure 10] 
have been compared with the traditional perturbation analysis. The comparison is 
found to be fairly good except for narrow slots where the conductor loss is found 
to be relatively smaller.
The conductor and dielectric losses obtained by Rozzi et al. [12] are plotted 
in Figure 5.10 for a slotline on alumina substrate with h = 0.635 mm, er = 9.8,  
s = 4.1 × 107 S/m, and tan d = 2 × 10–4. It is seen that the conductor loss is high-
er than the dielectric loss for all values of slot width and frequency. It increases 
with frequency but decreases with slot width. Consequently, in the millimetric 
wave region narrow slots will be very lossy. An increase in the substrate thickness  
and/or dielectric constant will allow larger slot widths for the same impedance. A

limit to the substrate thickness and permittivity is set by the excitation of TM sur-
face waves in the substrate [12].
Experimental results by Kurpis [20] show that the relative value for unloaded 
Q-factors of microstrip and slotline resonators are 280 and 120, respectively.
5.4	
Slotline Discontinuities
As in the case of microstrip circuits, the characterization of slotline discontinuities 
is needed for the design of slotline circuits. However, only two types of discontinui-
ties in the slotline have been studied. These are short-end and open-end disconti-
nuities. The experimental data is available for both types of discontinuities, but 
only short-end discontinuity has been analyzed.
5.4.1  Short End Discontinuty
A short end (shown in Figure 5.11) is created by merely ending the slot or equiva-
lently filling the slot with a conducting surface lying in the plane of the slot. The 
current flows in the metal surface around the end of the slot, and there is appreci-
able energy stored beyond the termination. This is illustrated in Figure 5.11. The 
net result is a predominance of stored magnetic energy, which gives rise to an in-
ductive reactance as seen at a reference plane normal to the slot axis and coincident 
with the end of the slot.
Fullwave analysis of the short end has been carried out in [21, 22]. Experimen-
tal characteristics of this discontinuity have been reported by Knorr and Saenz [23] 
and Chramiec [24]. Yang and Alexopoulos [22] have compared their theoretical 
results with those of Jansen [21] and measurements of Knorr [23]. This comparison 
is plotted in Figure 5.12 for the normalized end reactance of the slot. As expected, 
the end reactance of a shorted slot is inductive and significant. It increases with the 
increase in slot width and h/l0 ratio. The equivalent length of the short end may be

up to 0.1 ls. Figure 5.12 also shows good agreement between the theoretical results 
of two different authors. However, the agreement with the measured values of the 
end reactance is not so good. Measurement results are subject to various kinds of 
errors such as tolerances in fabrication, measurement accuracy, substrate toler-
ances, and coaxial-to-slotline transition.
Like an open end in a microstrip line, the short end in a slotline is not purely 
reactive. There are losses associated with the short end that are due to the propaga-
tion of power in surface waves and radiation in the form of space waves and can 
be described in terms of an equivalent resistance R presented by the discontinuity 
to the rest of the circut. Yang and Alexopoulos [22] have calculated the normalized 
end resistance for a shorted slot on the er = 12 substrate. These results are plotted 
in Figure 5.13. A comparison of Figure 5.12 for X/Z0s and Figure 5.13 for R/Z0s 
shows that for the chosen substrate thickness of h = 3.07 mm, the resistance and 
reactance are of the same order, which means that in this case radiated space waves 
and surface waves are strongly excited. The equivalent circuit of a short end is, 
therefore, a series combination of an inductor and a resistor. It may be mentioned 
that a slotline short end is frequently used in slotline circuits and has the same sig-
nificance as an open end in microstrip circuits.
5.4.2  Open End Discontinuity
For some circuit applications an open end in slotline circuits is required. An open 
circuit can be achieved by slowly tapering the metallizations constituting the slot. 
Figure 5.11  Field and current distributions in the vicinity of a slotline short end.

Slotlines
This is shown in Figure 5.14(a). This type of open circuit is impractical because it 
requires a lot of substrate area and cannot be implemented at any position in the 
circuit. Moreover, this type of open circuit produces a lot of radiation. In prac-
tice, an open circuit in a slotline is simulated by means of a circular disc opening 
(no metallization) at the end of the slotline. This is shown in Figure 5.14(b). The 
larger the radius of the disc, the better will be the open-circuit behavior. Theoreti-
cally, the circular disc will behave like a resonator especially if the width of the 
connecting slotline is narrow compared to the radius of the disc. Experimental 
studies carried out by Chramiec [24] on alumina substrate confirm this behavior. 
It is observed that if the operating frequency is higher than the resonant frequency, 
the circular disc behaves like an open circuit, that is, it is capacitive in nature. 
­Chramiec has also studied a slotline discontinuity that is a combination of a flared 
slot and a half disc. This is shown in Figure 5.14(c). This discontinuity has a reso-
nant behavior very similar to the circular slot/disc. But this discontinuity has the 
advantage that it requires lesser surface area and therefore can be used to minimize 
the overlap between microstrip and slotline portions of the circuit resulting in re-
duced proximity effects. Chramiec has used this slotline discontinuity to develop a  
1.5-GHz to 6-GHz low VSWR microsttip-to-slotline transition [24].

Variants of Slotline
5.5.1  Coupled Microstrip-Slotline
The cross section of a coupled microstrip-slotline is shown in Figure 5.15. It con-
sists of a slot in the ground plane of a microstrip line. This configuration has been 
used in the hybrid branchline coupler discussed in Section 5.7.1.
A coupled microstrip-slotline has been analyzed by a number of investigators 
[25–30]. The method of analysis used most frequently is Galerkin’s method in the 
spectral domain. It was observed that two types of modes propagate in this trans-
mission line: quasi-microstrip mode and the quasi-slotline mode. The electric field 
distribution for these modes is shown in Figure 5.15. The mode in Figure 5.15(a) 
has the field disttibution similar to that of a microstrip line. Since it has even sym-
metry, it is also called the even mode. Similarly, the mode in Figure 5.15(b) is called 
the odd mode, and the field distribution is similar to that in a slotline. Figures 5.16 
and 5.17 show the effective dielectric constants and the characteristic impedances 
of these modes [30]. It is observed from these figures that for the even mode, the ef-
fective dielectric constant decreases and the characteristic impedance increases with 
increasing slot width. This is because the effect of free space below the slot becomes 
more pronounced [25]. This mode can be used to realize very high impedances, in 
the order of 200 Ω to 300 Ω. Quite the opposite is true of the behavior of the odd 
mode or the slot mode with respect to the increase in strip width. This mode is 
less sensitive to the presence of the strip. It may be due to the fact that most of the 
energy in this mode is confined near the slot.

even mode and (b) odd mode (from [28],  1982 IEEE. Reprinted with permission.)

A variation of coupled microstrip-slotline is used in the design of double sub-
strate directional couplers [31]. In this configuration, the slotline is sandwiched 
between two microstrips by placing another microstrip on the slotline side of the 
coupled microstrip-slotline. This configuration is discussed later in Section 5.7.3.
5.5.2  Conductor-Backed Slotline
It is very tempting to introduce a conductor backing to the slotline. Among the 
many advantages that are envisaged are improved mechanical strength, easier im-
plementation of microstrip-slotline circuits, help in grounding floating regions, 
convenience in dc biasing, and heat sink.

Shigesawa, et al., [32] and Das and Pozar [19] have carried out fullwave analy-
sis of a conductor-backed slotline with a cover plate (see Figure 5.18). The analysis 
shows that for a conductor-backed slotline of infinite lateral dimension, power 
leaks into the dielectric-filled parallel plate region away from the slot. The loss of

power can be explained by a leaky mode characterized by the complex propagation 
constant g = b + ja, the imaginary part a accounting for the power loss. The leakage 
phenomenon is explained as follows.
Far away from the slot, the conductor-backed slotline resembles a conventional 
dielectric filled parallel plate waveguide formed by the electric conductors on both 
sides of the substrate. This waveguide supports a TEM mode for which there is no 
cut-off frequency. Therefore, there are two modes in the conductor-backed slotline: 
the slotline mode and the TEM mode. Leakage occurs for that range of parameters 
for which the propagation constant b of the slot mode is less than that of the paral-
lel plate mode [19]. In the structure under study, the propagation constant b/k0 for 
the slot mode lies between εr and 1. The TEM mode for the parallel plate wave-
guide has the propagation constant bTEM/k0 = εr. Since bTEM > b, leakage occurs 
independent of frequency or parallel plate separation.
Shigesawa et al. [32] have carried out the analysis of a conductor-backed slot-
line using two different approaches: a mode-matching technique and the trans-
verse equivalent network approach. Das and Pozar [19] used the fullwave spectral 
Figure 5.20  Phase constant (b/k0) and attenuation constant (a/k0) of a conductor-backed slotline 
as a function of slot width for er = 2.55. h/l0 = 0.267, f = 10 GHz (from [19],  1991 IEEE. Reprinted

­domain moment method. Measurements were also carried out to determine the 
leaky wave aspect of the leakage phenomenon [32]. For this purpose, the electric 
field distribution was probed across the width of slotline at a distance far away 
from the point of excitation. A sketch of the measurement set-up and a plot of the 
leaky wave field across the width of the slotline are shown in Figure 5.19. It was 
observed that the maximum of the electric field occurred at an angle q from the 
slot axis given by cos–1(b/(k0 εr). Das and Pozar [19] have compared the theoreti-
cal values of b/k0 and a/k0 with the computed and measured values in [32]. This is 
plotted in Figure 5.20. It is observed that the agreement is very good for wider slots 
between the measured values of [32] and theoretical calculations in [19]. Also, the 
attenuation constant is fairly high for the narrow slots. The effect of finite plate 
widths of the slotline and the conductor backing is also discussed by the authors 
[32]. In this case the propagation constant is found to be purely real.
The leaky slotline mode is one of the unwanted features of a conductor backed 
slotline. Another aspect of this transmission line becomes important when either 
the top plates or bottom plate of the structure is finite in the lateral direction but 
the substrate is thick enough electrically to support a surface wave also. At higher 
frequencies the value of b for the slotline mode can become lower than the value 
of b for the surface wave. When this happens the power from the slotline mode 
will couple to the surface wave, and b for the slotline mode will become complex. 
Surface wave propagation could produce unexpected cross talk with neighboring 
circuits. Shigesawa et al. [32] have calculated the crossover frequency between the 
slotline mode and the TM0 surface wave mode.
In addition to the discrete modes, a slotline also supports a continuum of radia-
tion modes due to its open nature. These modes can get excited at a discontinuity 
and are utilized to develop slot antennas. Rozzi et al. [33] have studied these modes 
for a conductor-backed slotline.
5.5.3  Conductor-Backed Slotline with Superstrate
This modification of the conductor-backed slotline has been suggested by Das [34] 
to eliminate leakage. The cross section of the conductor-backed slotline with a su-
perstrate is shown in the inset of Figure 5.21. Here, the superstrate parameters are 
described by the thickness d and the relative dielectric constant er2. The substrate 
parameters are the thickness h and the relative dielectric constant er1. As described 
in Section 5.5.2, leakage occurs because the propagation constant of the slotline 
mode is lower than the propagation constant of the parallel plate TEM mode. 
The propagation constant b of the slotline mode can be increased by loading the 
conductor-backed slotline by means of a superstrate. The loading is increased to an 
extent such that b > bTEM(= k0 εr). Loading by the superstrate increases with the 
increases in its dielectric thickness d and relative dielectric constant er2, thickness 
h of the substrate, and frequency. This is shown in Figure 5.21 for the effective 
dielectric constant ere. The increase in ere is almost linear with d when d is greater 
than a certain minimum value.
The effect of superstrate on the characteristic impedance Z0s has also been de-
termined by Das [34]. It is plotted in Figure 5.22. This figure shows that for a given 

Microstrip Lines and Slotlines
267
set of parameters there is a minimum value of superstrate thickness d below which 
Z0s decreases sharply to small values. This low value of Z0s is interpreted as indica-
tive of onset of leakage, that is, transition from the bound mode to unbound (leaky) 
mode. The evaluation of the field distribution as a function of d confirms the cor-
responding field spreading about the slot. Using such studies on field spreading 
and/or impedance variation, a suitable set of parameters for a conductor-backed 
slotline can be chosen so that leakage effects are avoided. For example, for the pa-
rameters of curve 1 of Figure 5.22, the value of d should be greater than 0.5 mm.
5.5.4  Slotlines with Double-Layered Dielectric
Slotlines on two layers of dielectric and sandwich slot configuration have been 
studied to introduce flexibility in design [52, 56–58]. The cross-section of these 
slotlines is shown in Figure 5.23. The sandwich slotline, Figure 5.23(a), confines 
the fields better in the dielectric layers compared to the single-layer slotline. There-
fore, it has a shorter guide wavelength. The double-layered slotline, Figure 5.23(b), 
may be employed to realize higher values of characteristic impedance compared to 
single-layer slotlines [58]. The double-layered slotlines have been analyzed using 
Cohn’s transverse resonance method [56, 58] and analysis in spectral domain [57]. 
The transverse resonance method (discussed in Section 5.2.2) is formulated for the 
slotline in an enclosure, and the results for open configuration are retrieved when 
the enclosure dimensions approach infinity. This technique can be extended to any 
number of dielectric layers around the slot. Numerical results for the guide wave-
length and characteristic impedance of these slotlines are available as a function of 
frequency [58]. Empirical expressions for these characteristics are derived in [59].

Slotline Transitions
To test and design slotline circuits it is necessary to have a transition between a 
slotline and the measuring equipment. A coaxial-to-slotline transition is commonly 
used for this purpose. Transitions between slotline and other transmission lines are 
also useful and increase the applications of slotlines. One such transition is slotline-
to-microstrip. These two types of transitions are discussed in this section. Slotline-
to-CPW transition is discussed in Chapter 7.
5.6.1  Coaxial-to-Slotline Transition
A commonly used coaxial line-to-slotline transition is shown in Figure 5.24(a). It 
consists of a miniature coaxial line placed perpendicular to and at the end of an

open-circuited slotline. The outer conductor of the cable is electrically connected 
(with solder or epoxy) to the metallization in the left half of the slot plane. The 
inner conductor is extended over the slot and connected to the metallization on 
the opposite side of the slot. This transition has been analyzed in [35] by assuming 
that the inner conductor of the coaxial line has a semicircular shape over the slot 
as shown in Figure 5.24(b).
An equivalent circuit suggested in [35] for the coax-slot transition of Figure 
5.24 is shown in Figure 5.25. The impedances Z0s and Zd are the characteristic 
impedances of the slotline and coaxial line, respectively. The fringe capacitance at 
the open end of the slot is represented by the lumped capacitor C. The inductance 
presents the self-inductance of the semicircular loop. The transformation ratio can 
be evaluated approximately by using (5.6), which gives the ratio of the voltage 
distance r to the voltage across the slot. We have

where kc is defined by (5.4).
From (5.56), it may be noted that the value of the transformer ratio n decreases 
with increases in frequency. Thus we can expect the performance of the transition 
to worsen at higher frequencies.
A comparison between experimental VSWR for a coaxial-to-slotline transition 
and the values based on the above model is shown in Figure 5.26. This transition 
has been constructed with a 50-Ω 3.58-mm semirigid coaxial cable that is coupled 
to a slotline etched from a 3.175-mm-thick substrate with er = 20. The slot imped-
ance is about 75 Ω (W/h = 0.55). The measured value of L is found to be 0.61 nH, 
and the capacitance C has a typical value of 0.2 pF. It is seen that the experimental 
curve is in reasonable agreement with the theoretical curve for C = 0 pF. Also, to 
achieve this agreement, the value of r used is 2.54 mm, which is about 50 percent 
greater than the actual height of the inner conductor of the coaxial line above the 
slot. There are two possible reasons for the lack of any better agreement between 
the model and the actual performance. First, the inner conductor of the coaxial line 
does not form a loop of exactly semicircular shape. Second, the Hankel function 
approximation does not describe accurately the variations of the electric field near 
the slot [2].
The transition described above has been successfully used in the S-band as it 
presents a good VSWR (less than 1.15) in the frequency range of 1.65 GHz to 4.0 
GHz. A lower VSWR value over a narrow frequency range can be obtained by 
using a movable short as shown in Figure 5.27. This transition is very useful for 
feeding and testing slotline circuits.

5.6.2  Microstrip-to-Slotline Cross-Junction Transition
Most of the circuits, wherein a slotline is used, also incorporate microstrip lines. 
Thus a microstrip-to-slotline transition is desired. Also the fabrication of the mi-
crostrip-to-slotline transition can easily be included in the MIC fabrication routine 
when an arrangement is made for etching the substrate on both sides. This transi-
tion has been comprehensively analyzed by many investigators [35–42]. A layout 
of this transition is shown in Figure 5.28.
The slotline, which is etched on one side of the substrate, is crossed at a right 
angle by a microstrip conductor on the opposite side. The microstrip extends about 
one quarter of a wavelength beyond the slot. The transition can be fabricated using 
the usual photoetching process and is thus easily reproducible. Also, as the micro-
strip part of the circuit can be placed on one side of the substrate and the slotline 
part on the other side, this transition makes two-level circuit design possible. Cou-
pling between the slotline and microstrip line occurs by means of the magnetic field 
(see Figures 1.4(d) and 5.2).
A transmission line equivalent circuit of the transition (Figure 5.28(a)) pro-
posed by Chambers et al. [36] is shown in Figure 5.28(b). The reactance X0s rep-
resents the inductance of a shorted slotline (see Section 5.4.1), and C0c is the ca-
pacitance of an open microstrip (see Section 3.4.1). Z0s and Z0m are slotline and 
microstrip characteristic impedances respectively. qs and qm represent the electrical 
lengths (quarter-wave at the center frequency) of the extended portions of the slot-
line and the microstrip, respectively, measured from the reference planes as shown 
in Figure 5.28(a). The transformer turns ratio n describes the magnitude of the 
coupling between the microstrip and slotline.
For further analysis the equivalent circuit in Figure 5.28(b) may be redrawn as 
in Figure 5.28(c). Here,

From the above analysis one can determine the characteristic impedance of the 
slotline Z0s needed to match the microstrip line impedance Z0m.
In the approximate analysis reported by Knorr [35] the transformer turns ratio 
n is determined from a knowledge of the slotline field components as

Yang and Alexopoulos [22], Das [37], and Antar et al. [38] have analyzed the mi-
crostrip-to-slotline cross-junction transition comprehensively. The analysis in [22] 
includes the effects of (i) radiation and surface waves excited by the cross-junction, 
(ii) the line discontinuities, and (iii) all the mutual couplings due to the dominant 
and higher order modes of each line. Das [37] has derived a simple closed-form ex-
pression for turns ratio n after making a number of approximations in the analysis.

Here, erem and eres are the effective dielectric constants and Wm and Ws are the

pends on the microstrip parameters (Wm, erem) as well as the slotline parameters 
(Ws, eres),  whereas the expression (5.62) depends on the slotline parameters only. 
Das [37] has given an expression for n for a multilayered configuration also in 
terms of Green’s function. The value of n obtained from (5.67) is compared to that 
obtained from (5.62) in Figure 5.29 for two sets of parameters [37]. It is observed 
from this figure that the results are comparable at lower frequencies, with n = 1 at 
dc (f ≈ 0). However, there is a significant deviation at higher frequencies that sug-
gests the inaccuracy of Knorr’s analysis for higher frequencies where higher order 
modes, surface waves, and radiation effects become important.
A comparison of VSWR between the measurements of [35], the transmission 
line circuit model of Figure 5.28(b), and theoretical values of [22] is shown in Fig-
ure 5.30. Again, the agreement is good between the comprehensive analysis and 
circuit model for lower frequencies and poor for higher frequencies. The reason 
appears to be the same as discussed earlier for turns ratio n. The measured value 
of VSWR in Figure 5.30 shows a wider bandwidth than that of either the circuit 
model or the analytical results in [22]. It is suggested in [22] that the measured 
value of VSWR is very much influenced by nonideal match load, the coaxial-to-
microstrip line transition, and substrate losses. Antar et al. [38] have used a slightly 
different equivalent circuit for the transition. Their theoretical results are found to 
have better agreement with the measurements of Knorr [35].

Bandwidth Improvement
Bandwidth limitation of the cross-junction transition results mainly from the fre-
quency dependence of X and Xm (Figure 5.28(d)). These reactances in turn depend 
on the stub length and turns ratio. A short-circuited microstrip will minimize Xm, 
and an open-circuited slotline will minimize X. Alternatively, stub reactances can 
be so designed that there is a mutual cancellation of X and Xm and R = Z0m. To 
achieve this condition various investigators have tried different approaches. Some 
of these are described next.
In the transition developed by Robinson and Allen [9] the microstrip is termi-
nated in a quarter-wave radial stub as shown in Figure 5.31(a). For this transition, 
a VSWR value less than 1.10 is obtained from 8.0 GHz to 10.0 GHz (20 percent 
bandwidth). Chramiec [24] has terminated the slotline in a radial stub, and the mi-
crostrip stub is a combination of a radial section and a rectangular section as shown 
in Figure 5.31(b). Reactances X and Xm are designed to cancel each other (Figure 
5.32) when the transition is developed on a 1.5-mm-thick alumina substrate, with 
a = 60° for the radial slotline stub, W/h = 0.2, Wr = 7.5 mm, and lr = 6.5 mm. The 
measured VSWR = 1.5 bandwidth of two cascaded transitions separated by a slot-
line section of 12 mm is found to be two octaves from 1.5 GHz to 6 GHz. This is 
plotted in Figure 5.33. When this transition was scaled to a 0.7-mm-thick alumina 
substrate, the VSWR was found to be below 1.45 in the frequency range 2 GHz to 
12.7 GHz [24]. The cross-junction transition on an anisotropic substrate has been 
studied by Podcameni and Coimbra [39].
Schuppert [40] has carried out an extensive study on the transmission line 
equivalent circuit of the cross-junction. First of all, he simplified the equivalent

circuit of Figure 5.28 by assuming n = 1 and by neglecting the open-circuit and 
short-circuit discontinuity reactances. Using this simplified equivalent circuit, he 
obtained a simple expression for the insertion loss of the transition as a function 
of characteristic impedance of the microstrip and slotline stubs assuming that the 
characteristic impedance of the slotline is the same as that of the microstrip, that 
is, 50 Ω. The simple analysis of the equivalent circuit shows that the bandwidth 
of the transition increases with increasing characteristic impedance of the slotline 
stub and decreasing characteristic impedance of the microstrip stub. Moreover, the 
bandwidth is at a maximum when the characteristic impedance of the microstrip 
stub is 2.618 times the characteristic impedance of the slotline stub. Experiments 
were carried out by Schuppert on uniform and nonuniform impedance stubs. The 
nonuniform stubs were realized in the form of circular geometry of various diam-
eters. Theoretical and measured transmission coefficient for such a transition on 
alumina substrate of 0.635 mm thickness is compared in Figure 5.34. The agree-

ment is seen to be fairly good. The cascade connection of two transitions has a 
bandwidth of approximately one decade. The bandwidth of a single transition will 
be larger than this. To reduce interaction between the two circular stubs, especially 
when the diameter increases, it has been suggested that triangular or radial stubs 
may be used instead [40].
The analysis by Schuppert makes a number of simplifying assumptions that 
do not appear to be reasonable particularly for a decade bandwidth transition. It 
appears that mutual cancellation of discontinuity reactances occurs over a broad 
bandwidth in this case. For example, a circular slot behaves like a resonant circuit 
[24]. Similarly, a circular microstrip patch will also behave like a resonant cir-
cuit, with the resonant frequency adjustable by a proper selection of its diameter. 
­Microstrip-to-slotline cross-junction transition with circular stubs was also studied 
by de Ronde [43]. The configuration of this transition is different from that in 
Figure 5.34. In this case, the slotline runs below the microstrip in the form of a 
spiral. The transition employs a short circuit at the center of a microstrip circular 
stub. The reported VSWR of this transition is less than 1.1 in the 1.0-GHz to 10-
GHz frequency range. A transition with a microstrip short-circuited at the junc-
tion has also been studied [40]. It was found to have a larger bandwidth than the

open ­circuited microstrip stub, but its implementation needs a via-hole grounding 
that may sometimes be difficult. A microstrip-to-slotline transition using a six-port 
junction has been described by Schiek and Kohler [44]. Although this transition has 
good performance between 2 GHz to 9 GHz, it needs more substrate space.
5.7	
Slotline Applications
It was mentioned in Section 5.1 that slotlines can be incorporated in microstrip 
circuits by etching the slotline circuit in the ground plane of the microstrip circuit. 
This type of hybrid combination has a number of advantages. Most of these ad-
vantages are due to the balanced (slotline) and unbalanced (microstrip line) natures 
of the transmission lines used. Many circuit functions that were not possible or 
easily realizable in microstrip form can now be implemented. These include short-
circuit, series T-junction, balanced circuits, and tight coupling. In addition to these, 
flexibility in circuit design is introduced, for example, series and parallel device 
mounting, wider range of line impedance, elimination of line crossings, and sub-
strate space saving, leading to better integration. These features have given rise to 
some novel circuits like hybrid branchline couplers, magic-T, and balanced circuits 
in printed form. The hybrid circuits based on microstrip-slotline, microstrip-CPW, 
and microstrip-slotline-CPW combinations are also called double-sided MICs [30].
5.7.1  Circuits Using T-Junctions
T-junctions and their variations occur very frequently in slotline-microstrip circuits 
or double-sided MICs. A slotline-microstrip T-junction can be obtained by allow-
ing the microstrip line to run indefinitely in the microstrip-to-slotline transition 
of Figure 5.28. The resulting T-junction will be as shown in Figure 5.35(a). The 
equivalent circuit of this T-junction can be obtained from the equivalent circuit of 
Figure 5.28(b) and will be as shown in Figure 5.35(b). Assuming n = 1 simplifies 
this circuit to that given in Figure 5.35(c).This is the equivalent circuit of a power 
divider with the slotline appearing in series with the two arms of a microstrip line. 
Therefore, this T-junction behaves like a series-T. Further, if the slotline is termi-
nated in its matched load, the equivalent circuit will reduce to that shown in Figure 
5.35(d), where Rs = n2Z0s.
Another T-junction can be obtained when the slotline of Figure 5.28 is not 
terminated in an open circuit but is allowed to run indefinitely. In this case the 
T-junction will behave like a parallel T-junction, that is, the slotline arms and the 
microstrip arm of the T-junction are connected in parallel to each other. A con-
figuration of this T-junction, the electric field distribution in the slotline, and the 
equivalent circuit are shown in Figure 5.36 [30, 45].
Series and parallel T-junctions can be combined to realize magic-T or 180° 
hybrids, as is discussed next.
Magic-T/180° Hybrid. Magic-T in a microstrip-slotline configuration has been 
studied by de Ronde [43], Aikawa and Ogawa [30, 45], and Chua [46]. Aikawa 
and Ogawa have described three different types of magic-T. Two of these magic-T

use microstrip lines, slotlines, and coupled slotlines. Another one uses a microstrip 
line and a slotline only. The three configurations are shown in Figure 5.37. In this 
figure solid lines represent slotlines and dotted lines represent the microstrip lines 
on the reverse side of the substrate. Ports E  and H correspond to the E- and H-
arms of a conventional waveguide magic-T, respectively, and ports 1 , and 2  are 
the remaining ports. Let us call these magic-T as microstrip type, slotline type, and 
T-junction type based on the kinds of transmission lines connected to the coupled 
slotlines for (a) and (b) and the use of T-junction only for (c). The slotline type 
magic-T can be used up to millimeter-wave frequencies because it does not need 
via-holes for grounding. The coupling behavior of microstrip and slotline-types 
magic-T is the same in principle. Therefore, we shall only explain the behavior of 
magic-T in Figure 5.37(a, c).
Figure 5.38 describes the in-phase coupling and out-of-phase coupling behav-
iors of a microstrip-type magic-T. Here, we have drawn the electric field distribu-
tion in the slotlines to explain the coupling. Let us first consider Figure 5.38(a). 
A signal fed to the microstrip port H is converted to the slotline mode and gets 
divided equally into two quarter-wavelength slotlines, and the direction of the

­electric field is such that the two slotlines are in parallel (very similar to H-plane 
T-junction in the waveguide). These signals cancel each other while coupling to the 
microstrip port E . Therefore, port E  is the uncoupled port. Then, these signals 
propagate through the coupled slotlines portion as an odd mode. They get further 
divided at the microstrip junction and appear as in-phase signals out of the micro-
strip ports  1  and  2  because of the even symmetry of the structure and the electric 
fields.
In Figure 5.38(b), a signal fed to port  E  is converted to the even mode of the 
coupled, slotlines and thereafter emerges as 180° out-of-phase signals through the 
ports 1  and  2 . A signal from the E  port does not couple to the H port because

the two quarter-wave slotlines are connected in parallel to the microstrip and the 
electric fields are out-of-phase in these slotline sections.
An equivalent circuit of the microstrip type magic-T is given in Figure 5.39. It 
is seen that the equivalent circuit is symmetrical with respect to ports E  and H. 
Consequently, two-port calculations can be used to analyze the four-port circuit. 
The two-port equivalent circuits for the in-phase and out-of-phase excitations of 
magic-T are given in Figure 5.40. The analysis of a cascade of two-port circuits can 
be carried out using the ABCD matrix. Theoretical and experimental performances 
of this magic-T have been calculated. Measured results for a magic-T designed at a 
center frequency of 6 GHz are plotted in Figure 5.41. The substrate used is alumina 
with a thickness of 0.635 mm and er = 9.6. All the port impedances are 50 Ω. The 
coupled slotline is designed such that Zeven = 35.4 Ω (= Z0 / 2) and Zodd = 63.6 Ω 
(= ZH/ 2) because the slotline is designed to be 90 Ω. The open microstrip stub 
impedance ZE is designed to be 40 Ω. It may be observed from the figure that the 
out-of-phase coupling  E  -  1 , 2  bandwidth is very wide. The in-phase coupling 
H -  1 ,  2  is almost flat and can transmit even dc signals. The isolation between 
the ports  E  and H is greater than 30 dB and between ports  1  and  2  is 25 dB at 
the center frequency. The insertion loss of the in-phase coupling is 0.7 dB and is 0.9

dB for out-of-phase coupling at the center frequency. The insertion loss is caused 
mostly by the conductor loss of the transmission lines. The coupling imbalance 
between ports  1  and  2  is a maximum 0.3 dB in amplitude and 2.1° in phase over 
an octave band.
The magic-T described above has a number of practical applications because 
of the convenient location of the ports. The E- and H-ports are located on the same 
side and opposite to the other two ports. This port configuration is quite different 
from that of a conventional 180° hybrid, such as a rat race. As a result of this, 
balanced type circuits, such as balanced mixers and balanced modulators, can be 
implemented with no crossing of transmission lines, which causes signal leakage 
between the lines and deterioration of the performance.
The magic-T of Figure 5.37(c) can be analyzed in the same manner as the other 
two. The electric field distributions for out-of-phase excitation and in-phase excita-
tion are shown in Figure 5.42. The theoretical performance can be calculated using 
the two-port circuit approach described earlier. Theoretical and measured perfor-
mances of this type of magic-T are compared in [30]. However, the bandwidth of 
this magic-T is narrower than that of the microstrip type described earlier.

The configuration of de Ronde’s magic-T is shown in Figure 5.43. It consists of 
a series T-junction and a parallel T-junction. The parallel T-junction is realized in 
the form of a microstrip T. A linear taper in the microstrip line is introduced in this 
T to act as an impedance transformer. In an experimental model tested at 2 GHz 
to 4 GHz on 2.54-cm by 2.54-cm alumina substrate the following performance has 
been reported [43]:
Isolation between shunt and series arm	 ≥	 40 dB
Isolation between collinear arms	
≥	 20 dB
Imbalance between opposite arms	
≤	 0.3 dB
Insertion loss between any two ports	
≅	 3.2 dB
A different type of magic-T, studied by Chua [46], is described in Section 5.7.2.
Balanced Microstrip-Slotline Ciruits [30]. Microstrip-slotline T-junctions have also 
been used to implement a number of balanced circuits. These include the balanced 
PSK modulator, phase detector, mixer, ASK modulator, and balanced frequency dou-
bler. The heart of these balanced circuits is the balance-to-unbalance transition or 
balun between slotline (balanced line) and microstrip line (unbalanced line). A con-
figuration of this balun is shown in Figure 5.44. There are a number of useful features 
of this balun. These are: (i) very good isolation between the balanced line and the

unbalanced line over a wide range of frequency due to the symmetric configuration, 
(ii) beam-lead devices can easily be mounted in the slotline portion of the balun, and 
(iii) a dc return path is not required because of the use of the slotline.
The balun, Figure 5.44, consists of a slotline T-junction, two quarter-wave 
slotlines, and a slotline-to-microstrip T-junction. In the slotline-to-microstrip T-
junction the microstrip end is connected to the slotline by means of a through hole 
conductor, as shown in the Figure 5.44(a). Alternatively, the microstrip stub can be 
a quarter-wave long and terminated in an open circuit as shown in Figure 5.44(b). 
This configuration of a balun is more useful. In this circuit a wire is bonded on the 
inside conductor of the slotline to supply the modulating signal or to obtain the 
IF signal. The wire port (or IF port) is isolated from the rf circuit because of the 
concentration of rf electromagnetic fields in the slotlines and the high series induct-
ance of the wire. The low frequency signals such as the IF and modulating signals 
do not couple to the microstrip line because (i) a microstrip line does not touch the 
inside conductor where the wire is bonded and (ii) the quarter-wave open-circuited 
microstrip line acts as a bandpass filter. Isolation between the rf ports, that is, mi-
crostrip line and input slotline, can be understood from the electric field distribu-
tion described earlier for the magic-T (Figure 5.42). Consequently, the three ports 
shown in Figure 5.44 for the balun are isolated from each other without the need 
for filters.

The equivalent circuit of the balun in Figure 5.44(b) is shown in Figure 5.45. 
Here, the T-junctions are represented by ideal transformers. It may be observed that 
the slotline T-junction is represented by a series-T circuit and the slotline-microstrip 
T-junction by a parallel-T circuit. It should be remembered that the microstrip-
slotline T-junction with microstrip through ports, described earlier, behaved like a 
series-T circuit. Applications of the balun are described next.
Figure 5.46 shows some examples of balanced microwave circuits [30]. The 
circuit of Figure 5.46(a) can be used as a PSK modulator, phase detector, or a mixer. 
When it is used as a PSK modulator the carrier propagates along each slotline ac-
cording to the polarity of the modulating pulse. If it is used as a mixer, an IF signal 
is obtained at the wire port. The isolation between the RF and LO ports is limited 
by the mismatch between the chartcteristics of two diodes. In the fequency doubler 
circuit of Figure 5.46(b) the diodes are mounted in such a manner that they are for-
ward biased when dc is applied through the wire. The length of the open-circuited 
microstrip stub is l/8 at the input frequency f0. When the input signal is applied to 
the port  B  it gets split equally into two parts and is supplied out of phase to the 
two diodes. The input signal and its odd-harmonics propagate out of phase along 
the l/4 slotlines and nullify each other at the microstrip-slotline junction. Thus, 
all odd harmonics are decoupled from the output port U . However, the second

harmonic 2f0 as well as higher order even harmonics are generated in phase by the 
diodes. The second harmonic signal is then obtained from the output port U , the 
l/8 microstrip stub playing the role of a bandpass filter at 2f0 . The circuit of Figure 
5.46(c) can be used as an ASK modulator. In this circuit the inside metallization of 
the slotlines is divided into two parts so that dc bias to the diodes can be applied 
independently of each other in order to generate the ASK signal. In principle, other 
devices such as MESFETs can be used in these circuits in place of diodes.
5.7.2  Circuits Using Wideband 180° Phase Shift
When two microstrip-to-slotline transitions are connected back-to-back as shown 
in Figure 5.47(a), an additional 180° phase shift is introduced in the signal path. 
This can be explained qualitatively by considering the E-field distribution asso-
ciated with the microstrip-to-slotline transition. Referring to Figure 5.47(b), we 
note that the E-field in the input microstrip line (near the transition) is in the –y-
direction. This produces a slotline wave with the E-field in the x-direction. At the 
second transition an x-directed component of E will cause the E-field in the output 
microstrip to lie in the y-direction. Thus, in addition to the phase change intro-
duced by the line length, the E-field direction changes from –y, to y, which amounts 
to an equivalent 180° phase change. This phase change is independent of frequency 
(at least in a first-order analysis) and can thus be used in wide-band circuits. Its ap-
plication in a rat-race circuit is now discussed.
Rat-Race Hybrid. The usual microstrip rat-race circuit shown in Figure 5.48(a) 
consists of a 3l/2 microstrip ring with the four ports located radially as shown. 
The three adjacent sections are each l/4 long while the fourth section is 3l/4. 
Typically this circuit will have a bandwidth of 20 percent. A modified version of 
this circuit [46]  involves the replacement of the 3l/4 microstrip section with a l/4 
slotline etched on the other side of the substrate as shown in Figure 5.48(b). The 
­remaining 180° electrical length of the microstrip section is compensated for by 
Figure 5.45  Equivalent circuit of the balun in Figure 5.44(b) (from [30],  1989 IEEE. Reprinted

the two ­microstrip slotline junctions required to introduce a slotline in the circuit. 
Since this phase change is frequency independent, the resulting rat-race circuit has 
a wider bandwidth. Experimental measurements [46] presented in Figure 5.48(c) 
show that a bandwidth of greater than an octave can be realized.
Pulse Inverter. The use of slotline provides a method of obtaining a broadband 
180° phase change. This technique can be used successfully in other circuits where 
a broadband 180° phase shift may be needed. A broadband pulse inverter has also 
been designed on this principle [47]. The input pulse is fed to one of the microstrip 
lines (see Figure 5.49(a)), and the inverted pulse output appears at the other micro-
strip. This pulse inverter was designed using a 0.625-mm thick alumina substrate. 
The oscilloscope traces of the input and the output pulse trains at 250 MHz are 
shown in Figure 5.49(b). As seen in this figure, the output pulses are almost identi-
cal to the input pulses except for the change in polarity. The bandwidth measure-
ment of the pulse inverter indicates that the circuit works up to 1 GHz.

Riblet has developed a microstrip-slotline symmetrical ring eight-port compar-
ator circuit [48]. The size of the ring is 3l at the center frequency. It can be reduced 
to a wavelength or less by using shunting capacitors across the slotline stubs.
5.7.3  Hybrid/de Ronde’s Branchline Couplers
Let us consider the branchline coupler configuration shown in Figure 5.50. A con-
ventional microstrip branchline coupler is shown in Figure 5.50(a) along with its 
transmission line equivalent circuit (neglecting junction effects). All the branchlines 
in this circuit are connected in shunt. Series connections of the branchline are not 
possible by the use of microstrips. However, the use of slotlines also allows the de-
signer the flexibility of incorporating series-connected branches if desired.
As shown in Figure 5.50(b) a shunt-connected element can be transformed in 
to an equivalent series-connected element provided two additional quarter-wave

­sections are included on each side of the series-connected element. If the middle 
branch of the 3-branch coupler, shown in Figure 5.50(a), is replaced by a series con-
nected branch in this manner, we obtain the configuration shown in Figure 5.50(c). 
In this arrangement, there are two half-wave sections between the shunt- and se-
ries-connected branches. These half-wave sections can be eliminated and the three 
branches put together at one place as shown in Figure 5.50(d). This coupler has been 
analyzed, like any other branchline coupler, using the method of even- and odd-mode 
excitations.
The modified branchline coupler has two advantages over the conventional 
microstrip branchline coupler: smaller size and wider bandwidth. Both of these 
advantages result from the elimination of the two quarter-wave lengths shown in 
Figure 5.50(a).
The final version of the hybrid branchline coupler, shown in Figure 5.50(d) is 
very similar to the coupler configuration shown in Figure 5.51, which was suggest-
ed earlier empirically by de Ronde [43] and is named after him. One can consider

following manner. Two shunt-connected branches are combined and realized by 
the microstrip on the top surface of the dielectric substrate. The series-connected 
brach is realized by the slotline in the ground plane. Performance of a de Ronde 
coupler has been measured [49] and the results are shown in Figure 5.52. The cir-
cuit designs are as follows:

A thorough analysis of de Ronde’s coupler has been carried out by Hoffmann and 
Siegl [28, 50]. The coupler has been analyzed using the method of even- and odd-
mode excitations applied to the coupled microstrip-slotline configuration. Char-
acteristics of this transmission line were described in Section 5.5.1. Let Z0e and ere 
be the characteristic impedance and effective dielectric constant for the even-mode 
(quasi-microstrip mode), respectively, and Z0o and ero be the corresponding quanti-
ties for the odd-mode (quasi-slot mode), respectively. Synthesis equations for this 
coupler are obtained as [28]

where Z0 is the characteristic impedance of the feed lines to the coupler and k is the 
coupling coefficient. From the odd- and even-mode impedances one can determine 
the strip width and slot width of the coupler. If the length of the coupled section is 
chosen to be a quarter-wave at the center frequency, the directivity of the coupler 
is found to be poor because the phase velocities for the even- and odd-modes are 
different (ero < ere). The lower phase for the odd mode can be compensated for, at 
a particular frequency, by increasing the length of the slotline so that it extends 
outside the overlapping microstrip [51], as shown in Figure 5.53. The additional 
slotline leaves the phase associated with the even-mode unchanged, and the total 
phase of the odd mode can be adjusted such that qe = qo. However, this end loading 
decreases the impedance. To compensate for this the characteristic impedance of 
the slot mode, Z0o, has to be increased.
Now, let us assume that the phase compensation is to be achieved at the center 
frequency referenced to the even mode, that is,
fc =
c
4εre 
 where l is the length of the coupling section.
Further, assuming that a slight increase in Z0o to Z*0o required for compensation 
will not alter ero, that is e*ro = ero, the increased characteristic impedance Z*0o and the 
additional slot length ls on either end of the coupled section are obtained as [28]

Another approach for equalizing the even- and odd-mode velocities for the cou-
pled microstrip-slotline is to cover the slotline with a dielectric sheet as shown in 
Figure 5.54.
Aikawa and Ogawa [30] have designed a de Ronde’s coupler in the millimeter 
wave region at a center frequency of 26 GHz. It was fabricated on 0.3-mm-thick 
alumina substrate. The insertion loss variation of the coupler was found to be less 
than 0.5 dB over the frequency range 25 GHz to 28.5 GHz. The isolation was 
greater than 18 dB over a bandwidth of 6 GHz.
A two-layer, slotline-coupled microstrip directional coupler—useful for real-
izing tight and loose couplings—has been discussed by Tanaka et al. [31]. The 
cross-section of the transmission line used in the coupler is shown in Figure 5.55. 
It consists of two microstrip lines that couple through a slot line in the common 
ground plane as shown. The conformal mapping based design of this coupled line 
configuration is discussed in Chapter 8, Section 8.3. A number of directional cou-
plers were designed for tight coupling (~ 3 dB), as well as loose coupling (such as 10 
dB), for a center frequency of 1.5 GHz. The design of this coupler is exactly similar 
to any coupled-line directional coupler. The substrate thickness was 0.8 mm and 
the relative permittivity was 2.5. Measurements on these couplers showed >25 dB 
return loss, >28 dB isolation, and a coupling variation of 0.2 dB over the 1.2–1.8 
GHz frequency range [31]. These couplers were then combined to obtain multiport 
directional couplers, avoiding any microstrip line crossover.
Abbosh and Bialkowski have discussed compact UWB directional couplers that 
utilize slot-coupled microstrip lines [60]. The couplers employ elliptical-shaped mi-
crostrip lines and slotlines to achieve UWB operation. The schematic of the coupler 
is shown in Figure 5.56 [61]. The elliptical microstrips in the top and bottom layers

are defined by D1 and D2, while the elliptical slot in the middle layer is defined by 
D2 and D3. The measured results for the couplers show 3±0.8 dB, 6±1.4 dB, and 
10±1.5 dB coupling across the 3.1–10.5 GHz band. The isolation is better than 23, 
20, and 19 dB, whereas the return loss is better than 23, 18, and 19 dB for the 3-, 
6- and 10-dB couplers, respectively. A new Marchand balun utilizing slot-coupled 
microstrip lines is reported [61]. Diamond-shaped microstrip lines and slotlines are 
employed to achieve broadband operation of the balun. The balun achieves 0.69 
dB amplitude balance and 1.4 degree phase balance over 1.11–2.93 GHz.
5.7.4  Other Types of Slotline Circuits
The circuits mentioned in this section are based on the properties of slotlines only. 
They do not have the hybrid composition as described in earlier circuits using 
slotlines. These circuits can be classified into two categories: circuits using slotline 
resonators (for example, filters) and ferrite devices using slotline.
Circuits Using Slotline Resonators
Slotline resonators have been used for the design of filters, both band-pass and 
band-reject types [52]. The design procedure for slotline filters is the same as that 
for any other transmission line; that is, it is based on the coupling coefficient be-

tween either two end-coupled or two parallel-coupled sections of transmission line. 
The experimental results in [52] indicate that the performance of slotline filters is 
not superior to those using other transmission lines.
Ferrite Devices Using Slotline
When the slotline was introduced as an alternative transmission structure for 
MICs, it was expected that the slotline would be more suitable than the microstrip 
line for nonreciprocal ferrite devices. This expectation was based on the existence 
of an elliptically polarized magnetic field distribution in the slot as discussed in 
Section 5.2.1. However, the experimental and analytical studies reported so far on 
circulators and isolators [53–55] have not pointed out any significant advantage of 
ferrite devices using slotline. A differential phase shifter in a coupled microstrip-
slotline configuration (Figure 5.15) holds promise. El-Sharawy and Jackson have 
reported the analysis and experimental results on this type of phase shifter [29]. A 
multilayered configuration provides a larger amount of phase shift. A differential 
phase shift of the order of 45°/cm was measured by them over a 6-GHz to 8.5 GHz 
frequency range.

Defected Ground Structure (DGS)
6.1	
Introduction 
In the design of microstrip components and circuits, the frequency response is usu-
ally optimized by properly selecting the shape and size of the conductor lines: the 
backside ground plane is typically a solid metal sheet, and it does not represent a 
degree of freedom in the design phase. 
Defected ground structures (DGS) offer an alternative solution for improving 
the performance of several printed microwave circuits, based on microstrip lines 
and coplanar waveguides [1–4]. In DGS, the ground plane is intentionally modi-
fied to improve the frequency response of the component. The modifications of the 
ground plane are usually called “defects,” and these defects in the ground plane 
give the name to this class of components. A defect typically consists of a slot or an 
aperture in the ground plane, located directly under the microstrip line or besides 
the coplanar waveguide. The geometry of the aperture/slot is carefully selected, 
in order to create a proper perturbation of the current distribution in the ground 
plane and to achieve the desired electromagnetic effect. 
There are two major classes of DGS: the first group comprises structures based 
on a single defect, whereas the second group encompasses structures based on a 
small number of defects, in a periodic or non-periodic arrangement. DGS based on 
a single defect [5–8] exploit the additional inductance and capacitance effect of an 
aperture in the ground plane to modify the frequency response of a printed circuit, 
for instance by introducing a transmission zero in the frequency response of a mi-
crostrip filter. Conversely, DGS based on a small number of defects [9–11] (either 
periodic or non-periodic) allow enhancing the characteristics of single defects. In 
the case of small periodic arrays of defects, they exploit the propagation band–gap 
to modify the characteristics of a printed circuit or a patch antenna. In the majority 
of cases, components based on a single defect (or few defects) are preferred, due to 
the easier modeling, more compact size, and smaller radiation issues. 
The use of DGS was first proposed around year 2001 [5], as an evolution of 
the research activities on photonic band-gap structures (PBG) and electromagnetic 
band–gap structures (EBG) [12–14]. There is a substantial difference between DGS 
and PBG structures (or the term EBG, usually preferred in the microwave com-
munity): PGB/EBG structures are large periodic arrays of defects and exploit their 
periodicity to prevent the propagation of electromagnetic waves in a certain fre-
quency band (band-gap effect). In DGS, the periodicity is usually not implemented 
and the structures are based on a single defect (or a few defects). 

306
Defected Ground Structure (DGS)
DGS open a variety of new perspectives for the development of printed planar 
circuits and antennas, as they break the traditional design approach of microstrip 
and coplanar waveguide components and add an extra degree of freedom in the 
design phase. The applications of DGS range from microstrip filters with addi-
tional transmission zeros to transmission lines supporting slow–wave propagation 
or with high characteristic impedance, to hybrid couplers, oscillators, power ampli-
fiers and antennas with improved performance. 
The main advantage of DGS is related to their easy technological implementa-
tion: in fact, the processing of DGS–loaded circuits is based on standard printed 
circuit board (PCB) technology, the same manufacturing technique adopted for 
printed microwave components. In the case of DGS components, the only addi-
tional requirement can be the processing of the ground metal layer. Conversely, the 
main disadvantage of DGS is the increase in radiation leakage: for instance, when 
a defect produces reflection of the incident wave, part of the energy is radiated 
into the free space. The radiation effect can be a critical issue, as it determines the 
coupling between adjacent circuits and may lower the Q of the component. In ad-
dition, there is the need of some free space underneath the defected ground plane, 
not to perturb the electromagnetic behavior of the apertures. For this reason, and 
in order to keep the radiation levels negligible, special housing for such circuits are 
required in most cases. 
6.1.1  Basic Structure of DGS
The basic configuration of DGS is represented by a microstrip line combined with a 
slot etched in the metallic ground plane (Figure 6.1). The shape and size of the ap-
erture in the ground plane play a critical role in the determination of the frequency 
response, which is similar to the way in which the geometry of conductors affects 
the frequency response of conventional microstrip circuits. 
A simple yet significant example of DGS was first presented in [5, 9], where a 
band–stop filter is designed by adopting a conventional straight microstrip trans-
mission line with a dumbbell aperture etched in the backside metallic ground 
plane (Figure 6.1). The dumbbell defect consists of two rectangular apertures of 
dimensions a × b connected by a thin slot of width g and length w. The dimen-
sions of the aperture in the ground plane are quite small: in [5], a defect with  
a = b = 2.5 mm, g = 0.2 mm, and w = 1.62 mm was adopted to obtain a stop–band 
effect at 7.5 GHz, in conjunction with a 50 Ω microstrip line of width w on a sub-
strate of thickness h = 1.5748 mm and relative dielectric permittivity er = 10 (Figure 
6.1).
A variety of shapes have been adopted for the design of DGS (Figure 6.2). The 
most common aperture geometries are rectangular dumbbell [5], circular dumbbell 
[15], arrowhead [16], cross [17], H-shape [18], square open-loop with a slot in the 
middle section [19], V-shape [20], U-shape [20], spiral [21], concentric ring [22], 
split-ring resonator [23], and fractals [24]. In all cases, the geometry is optimized 
to achieve the required electromagnetic performance with the minimization of the 
circuit footprint. 
The first geometry adopted for a DGS circuit was the rectangular dumbbell 
shape (Figure 6.1) [5]. This shape presents a sufficient number of degrees of free-

Microstrip Lines and Slotlines
307
dom, and this permits achieving the desired electromagnetic effect and optimizing 
the frequency response of the component. The circular dumbbell shape, proposed 
in [15], exhibits a very similar geometry, with two circular apertures connected by 
a thin slot, etched in the ground plane of a microstrip line. In both cases, the use of 
a single defect allows introducing a distinct stop-band property in the transmission 
frequency response of the microstrip line. 
The use of a spiral-shaped defect, proposed in [21], appears particularly inter-
esting, as it leads to very compact structures. More specifically, when a spiral defect 
and a dumbbell defect with the same size are implemented on identical substrates, 
the stop-band frequency of the spiral-loaded microstrip line is much lower than 
that of the dumbbell loaded line. 
The H-shaped DGS offers very attractive features, as its size is very compact 
and the quality factor of the stop-band resonance is higher than rectangular and 
circular dumbbell, thus providing a sharper transition from pass-band to stop-band 
[18]. V-shaped and U-shaped DGS also present stop-band resonances with high 
quality factors [20]. The quality factor can be increased by decreasing the distance 
between the two arms of U-shaped defects or by reducing the angle between the 
two arms of V-shaped DGS. 
Concentric ring-shaped defects, proposed in [22], permit achieving a particu-
larly broad stop-band. The band-stop properties can be controlled by varying their 
radius and thickness of the concentric rings. 
Due to the presence of defects, the electromagnetic field is not completely con-
fined and may have significant values below the ground plane. For this reason, 
Figure  6.1  Defected ground structure, consisting of a straight microstrip line with a dumbbell-
shaped aperture (defect) in the backside ground plane (from [5],  2001 IEEE. Reprinted with 
permission.).

Defected Ground Structure (DGS)
proper housing structures are needed to avoid perturbing the field. The minimum 
dimensions of these structures and the needed clearance below the ground plane 
depend on the shape and size of the defect and on the characteristics of the dielec-
tric substrate, and they need to be evaluated for each specific case. 
The microstrip–based DGS shown in Figure 6.1 has also its counterpart in 
coplanar waveguide technology. A dumbbell–shaped aperture can be integrated 
on the ground plane of a coplanar waveguide (Figure 6.3), with the aim to design 
a band–stop filter [25]. The dumbbell–shaped defect consists of two square ap-
ertures of side a, connected by short gaps of length l and width d to the slots of 
the coplanar waveguide (Figure 6.3a). In this case, the circuit can be realized in 
uni-planar technology, as the defect is located on the same plane of the slots of the 
coplanar waveguide. In addition, different topologies can be adopted: instead of 
removing completely the metal in the square apertures, only a peripheral strip can 
be removed, thus leaving an internal square metal patch (Figure 6.3b). This latter 
topology is suitable for integration with control elements (e.g., varactor diodes), 
which allow the tuning of the stop-band frequency (Figure 6.3c). 
Other examples of DGS based on a coplanar waveguide were proposed in [21], 
where a spiral-shaped defect is integrated on the ground plane of the coplanar 
waveguide, and in [26], where a meander line connected to the coplanar waveguide 
was adopted to design band-stop filters with broad rejection bandwidth.

In several cases, a single defect represents the unit cell of a periodic pattern of ap-
ertures, etched in the ground plane of a microstrip line or a coplanar waveguide 
[9–10]. Periodic DGS allow achieving a more selective frequency response, enhanc-
ing the band-stop properties and getting more pronounced slow-wave effect, com-
pared to structures based on a single defect. 
Two major topologies have been investigated for periodic DGS-based compo-
nents: one with longitudinal periodicity and the other with transversal (or vertical) 
periodicity. The first solution is represented by an array of identical defects, longi-
tudinally aligned along the propagation direction of the transmission line (Figure 
6.4a). This structure allows, for instance, designing band-stop filters with broad 
rejection bandwidth: the central frequency mainly depends on the geometry of the 
unit cell and (partially) on the longitudinal spacing of the defects, while the depth 
and the bandwidth of the stop band are mainly related to the number of periods 
[9]. 
In the second topology of periodic DGS, a number of identical defects are 
periodically aligned transversally with respect to the propagation direction of the 
transmission line (Figure 6.4b). Compared to longitudinally periodic DGS, the 
transversal topology provides a much higher slow-wave effect and leads to a sig-
nificant reduction in length, at the cost of an increased width. A combination of 
longitudinal and transversal configurations can also be adopted (Figure 6.4c): in 
particular, in [10] it was demonstrated that this structure permits to reduce the 
length of the matching network of an amplifier by almost 50%. 
In some cases, it has been shown that improved performance can be achieved 
by adopting a non-periodic pattern of defects: by properly optimizing the size of 
each single defect, the frequency response of a band-stop filter can be improved by 
reducing the ripple and broadening the rejection bandwidth [11].

A class of components based on periodic defects, similar to periodic DGS and 
their precursors, is represented by the electromagnetic band-gap (EBG) structures. 
In EBG structures, the defects are arranged according to a two-dimensional peri-
odic pattern in the ground plane of microstrip line or coplanar waveguide circuits. 
EBG structures exploit the periodicity to prevent the electromagnetic wave propa-
gation in certain frequency bands and certain directions, and to synthesize artificial 
magnetic conductors and negative index materials. However, these structures are 
beyond the scope of this chapter: a thorough description of their properties and 
applications can be found in papers [12–14] and books [27–29].

6.1.3  Advantages and Disadvantages of DGS 
DGS represent a significant advance in the field of microstrip line and coplanar 
waveguide components, as they allow improving the performance of a large variety 
of passive components, active circuits, and antennas, with a minimum increase in 
the manufacturing complexity. They permit to enhance the frequency response of 
filters, to improve the efficiency of power amplifiers, to control harmonic frequen-
cies in active circuits and antennas, and to reduce the size of hybrid couplers and 
power dividers. All these applications will be described in Sec. 6.4. 
Nonetheless, some disadvantages are associated with the use of DGS–based cir-
cuits. The major drawback of this class of structures, which often is not fully con-
sidered in the literature, is the effect of spurious radiation leakage and consequent 
decrease in Q, due to the presence of apertures in the ground plane. Radiation 
causes two major problems; one is the power loss, which reduces the overall effi-
ciency of the component, and the other is the undesired parasitic coupling between 
adjacent circuits, which can jeopardize the proper operation of large or complex 
circuits. Furthermore, an additional step is needed to design and etch ground plane, 
and the circuit needs special housing or enclosure. 
In addition, the numerical modeling of DGS circuits is more complex compared 
to classical microstrip line and coplanar waveguide structures: due to the radiation 
and parasitic coupling effects, the approximation of boxed printed circuits (often 
adopted in the modeling of classical microstrip components) cannot be applied, 
and radiation boundary conditions need to be employed in the electromagnetic 
simulation. In addition, there is a lack of equivalent circuit models of classical DGS 
in commercial software, and this makes the design phase of DGS–based circuits 
more time consuming. The modeling issues are even more significant in the case of 
circuits based on periodic DGS. 
6.2	
Dgs Characteristics 
DGS exhibit unique important features, which are particularly useful to improve 
the performance of printed components and systems. Among them, one of the 
most interesting characteristics is the possibility to introduce transmission zeros 
in the frequency response of microstrip-line and coplanar-waveguide components. 
This stop-band property can be exploited to increase the selectivity of filters and 
to improve the out-of-band frequency response of several active and passive com-
ponents. 
The second useful characteristic of DGS is related to the possibility to support 
slow-wave propagation; this means that DGS-loaded transmission lines support 
guided waves with phase velocity slower than the corresponding transmission lines 
without defects. The slow-wave characteristic of DGS allows reducing the dimen-
sion of printed microwave circuits. 
The third important feature of DGS is the possibility to implement high-im-
pedance transmission lines. This is typically a critical task, especially in the case of 
microstrip lines, as transmission lines with high characteristic impedance require 
very thin conductor lines. This problem can be overcome by the use of DGS, thus 
relaxing the requirements in accuracy of the fabrication process.

Defected Ground Structure (DGS)
In this Section, various DGS characteristics are carefully investigated, through 
the use of a simple equivalent circuit model, and a physical interpretation of the 
different phenomena is provided. 
6.2.1  Stop-Band Properties 
The stop-band properties of DGS were first exploited in [5, 9] to design a band-
stop filter. The filter is based on a conventional straight microstrip transmission line 
with a dumbbell aperture etched in the backside metallic ground plane (Figure 6.1). 
The dumbbell defect consists of two rectangular apertures of dimensions a × b con-
nected by a thin slot of width g and length w. The presence of the defect determines 
the stop-band effect, introducing a transmission zero in the frequency response 
with no need of any modification of the conductor line. The frequency of this 
transmission zero depends on the shape and size of the defect, and can be modified 
accordingly: in particular, the stop-band frequency decreases when increasing the 
size of the defect, namely the dimensions a and b.
A straightforward physical explanation of this phenomenon can be provided. 
In fact, the presence of the aperture in the ground plane determines two major 
effects, which can be combined and optimized to achieve the desired frequency 
response of the circuit. 
The first relevant effect is due to the perturbation of the shield current distribu-
tion in the ground plane: because of the aperture etched in the ground plane, the 
electric current flowing on the metallic ground has to face a longer path. If the size 
of the aperture is small compared to wavelength and the quasi-static approxima-
tion can be applied, this perturbation of the path determines an additional series 
inductance L. Increasing the size of the aperture (more specifically, increasing the 
sides a and b of the two squares of the dumbbell, see Figure 6.5a) determines a 
longer path of the current and consequently a larger series inductance. 
The second significant effect of the aperture in the ground plane is due to the 
thin gap located below the strip conductor: the thin gap determines an accumula-
tion of charge and consequently (if the aperture is small compared to wavelength 
and the quasi-static approximation is applicable) a series capacitance C. In par-
ticular, a smaller gap corresponds to a larger value of the series capacitance, while 
keeping the same size of the two squares of the dumbbell aperture (dimensions a 
and b, Figure 6.5a). 
The combined effect of these two phenomena can be modeled by an equivalent 
LC-parallel lumped element circuit (Figure 6.5b), where the inductance L is due to 
the perturbation of the current path and the capacitance C depends on the accu-
mulation of charge near the gap. In this equivalent circuit, Z0 represents the char-
acteristic impedance of the transmission line. This LC-parallel circuit exhibits a 
resonance at frequency f0, which can explain the transmission zero in the frequency 
response of the microstrip line with the defect located below the conductor line. 
Obviously, the stop-band frequency f0 depends on L and C and can be computed as 
	
f0 =
1
2π

This effect is particularly useful for the design of band-stop filters, as well as 
for improving the selectivity of band-pass filters, where out-of-band transmission 
zeros help improving the response selectivity and eliminating undesired spurious 
bands. The values of inductance L and capacitance C can be almost independently 
controlled, thus providing two important degrees of freedom in the circuit design. 
An example to clarify these concepts is described next. The microstrip line 
coupled with the dumbbell defect shown in Figure 6.1 was analyzed by a full-
wave simulator, and the parameters L and C of the equivalent circuit model were 
derived by fitting procedure [5]. The frequency response obtained from the equiv-
alent circuit model of Figure 6.5b shows very good agreement with the result 
of the full-wave simulation [5]. In all cases, the dielectric substrate has a thick-
ness h = 1.5748 mm and relative dielectric permittivity er = 10. The width of the 
50 Ω microstrip line is w = 1.62 mm. The values of the other geometrical dimen-
sions (namely, a = b, and g) are variables, and their effect on the values of L and C 
and consequently on the stop-band frequency f0 are investigated.

bution in the ground plane, due to the presence of the dumbbell-shaped aperture; (b) equivalent

Defected Ground Structure (DGS)
As a first step, the gap distance is kept constant at the value g = 0.2 mm and 
dimensions a and b are modified. Three analyses, with a = b = 1.3 mm, 2.5 mm, and 
4.6 mm, respectively, have been performed (Figure 6.6a), and the corresponding 
equivalent circuit models have been derived. The values of L and C, as well as of 
the stop-band frequency f0, are reported in Table 6.1 for the three cases. These re-
sults show that the value of the inductance L is strongly affected by the dimensions 
a and b of the dumbbell, which contribute to increase the path length of the shield 
current; more specifically, L increases when a and b increase. Conversely, the value 
of C is practically unaffected when varying a and b. Consequently, the stop-band 
frequency f0 decreases when the size of defect is increased. 
In the second set of analyses, the dimensions a and b are kept constant 
(a = b = 2.5 mm for all cases) and the gap distance g is modified. Also in this case, 
three analyses have been performed, with g = 0.2 mm, 0.4 mm, and 0.6 mm, re-
spectively (Figure 6.6b), and the corresponding equivalent circuit models have been 
derived. The values of L, C, and f0, are reported in Table 6.2 for the three values of 
g. These results show that the value of the capacitance C decreases when the gap 
distance g becomes larger, as expected from physical considerations. Conversely, 
dimension g has a minor (although not negligible) effect on the value of the induct-
ance L. The overall effect is a small reduction of the stop-band frequency f0 when 
the gap becomes smaller.
All these analyses demonstrate that the stop-band frequency f0 of the micro-
strip line loaded with the dumbbell defect can be adjusted by properly modifying 
the geometrical dimensions of the defect. Moreover, the values of L and C can be 
controlled quite independently, and this allows to modify the width of the stop 
band, which is related to L⁄C. In all cases, the footprint of the complete circuit 
remains small compared with the wavelength at the operation frequency.
6.2.2  Slow-Wave Propagation 
Another important property of DGS-based circuits, strictly related with the stop-
band property discussed in Section 6.2.1, is the possibility to support slow-wave 
propagation [30]. In slow-wave propagation regime, the phase velocity of the waves

propagating in the DGS-loaded microstrip line is smaller than the phase velocity 
in the corresponding conventional microstrip line (realized on the same dielectric 
substrate, but with no defects). Likewise, the propagation constant b of the DGS 
line is larger than the propagation constant k of the conventional microstrip line. 
Due to this slow-wave effect, the DGS line has longer electrical length than the con-

ventional microstrip line with the same physical length. Therefore, the slow-wave 
effect can be exploited to reduce the size of printed microwave components and 
circuits. The slow-wave factor, which can be defined as the ratio b/k, represents a 
measure of the possible reduction in linear dimension of the circuits. 
The LC equivalent circuit shown in Figure 6.5b permits to easily explain the 
slow-wave propagation phenomenon. In the frequency range below the resonance 
frequency of the parallel LC resonator (f < f0), the inductance L represents the dom-
inant element, and the effect of the capacitance C can be neglected. Consequently, 
the equivalent circuit of the DGS (i.e., the parallel LC circuit shown in Figure 6.5b) 
reduces to the series inductance L. When considering a short section of microstrip 
line with a defect, this additional series inductance contributes to increase in the 
inductance per unit length of the transmission line: as a consequence, the propaga-
tion constant b (proportional to the square root of the inductance per unit length) 
becomes larger than the corresponding propagation constant k of the conventional 
microstrip line (b > k). 
More specifically, the propagation constant k of the conventional microstrip 
line can be expressed as 
	
k = ω L0C0 	
(6.2)
where w is the angular frequency and L0 and C0 represent the inductance and ca-
pacitance per unit length of the conventional microstrip line, respectively. 
In a section of DGS-loaded microstrip line of length d (small compared to 
wavelength, d  l), the inductance per unit length is increased by L/d, and conse-
quently the propagation constant b is given by 
	
β = ω
L0 + L
d
⎛
⎝⎜
⎞
⎠⎟ C0
	
(6.3)
The value of b is larger than the value of k for the corresponding conventional 
microstrip line, thus demonstrating that, for f < f0, the DGS-loaded microstrip line 
behaves as a slow-wave structure (note that, on the contrary, for f > f0 the capacitor 
has the dominant effect and the structure supports fast-wave propagation). Ex-
pression (6.3) is a good representation of the propagation constant b of the DGS 
structure, also in the case of periodic DGS, provided that the dimension of the 
defect (or the short section of microstrip line with a defect) is small compared to 
wavelength (d  l). Therefore, this expression is valid only in the low frequency 
approximation. 
The slow-wave factor, defined as the ratio b/k, can be obtained by comparing 
expressions (6.2) and (6.3). From these equations, however, it appears that the 
slow-wave factor is independent of frequency: this assumption is not correct, as 
expression (6.3) is valid only in the low frequency range. 
A more accurate study of the slow-wave factor is based on the calculation of 
the scattering parameters of the DGS-loaded microstrip line, obtained either by 
a full-wave simulation or by the analysis of the LC equivalent circuit model. By 
considering the equivalent circuit model of Figure 6.5b, the scattering parameter 
S21 is obtained as

where Z0 represents the reference impedance and is the characteristic impedance of 
the transmission line in this case. The amplitude and phase of S21 are:

Figs. 6.7a and 6.7b report the amplitude and phase, respectively, of the scattering 
parameter S21 of a DGS-based microstrip line, calculated by using formulas (6.5) 
and based on the LC equivalent circuit model. The values L = 1.33 nH, C = 0.67 
pF, and Z0 = 50 Ω are adopted in the calculation [30]. The plot of the amplitude 
|S21| (Figs. 6.7a) shows a minimum of the transmission near the resonance frequen-
cy f0 = 5.32 GHz (center of the band–gap region). Regarding the phase of the scat-
tering parameter S21 (Figs. 6.7b), these results show that ∠S21 < 0 in the frequency 
range below the resonance frequency f0, where there is the dominant effect of L 
(slow–wave propagation region), whereas ∠S21 > 0 in the frequency range above f0, 
where there is the dominant effect of C (fast–wave propagation region).
By using these results, the propagation constant b can be calculated as

Figure 6.8 shows the value of the slow–wave factor versus frequency. The maxi-
mum value of the slow-wave factor is obtained for frequencies smaller than f0 
and very close to it. Therefore, the slow–wave effect is more pronounced near the 
stop–band frequency, but only at the price of a reduced |S21|: a compromise occurs 
between transmission performance and slow–wave factor.
6.2.3  Realization of Transmission Lines with High Characteristic Impedance 
The realization of transmission lines with high characteristic impedance is typi-
cally a serious problem in printed technology: in the case of microstrip lines, for 
instance, technological constraints limit the highest possible characteristic imped-
ance to 120–130 Ω. For higher values of the characteristic impedance, the conduc-
tor width becomes too narrow, and fabrications inaccuracies are an issue. Some 
applications require the implementation of high impedance transmission lines (e.g., 
unbalanced power dividers [6]).
The use of DGS allows the realization of high impedance microstrip lines, with 
conductor width much wider than in the conventional microstrip lines. Using DGS 
permits to increase the equivalent inductance per unit length, and to decrease the 
equivalent capacitance, thus finally raising the value of the characteristic imped-
ance up to more than 200 Ω.
An example of high-impedance DGS-based microstrip line is reported in [6], 
where a transmission line with characteristic impedance Z0 = 158 Ω is required for 
the design of a 4:1 unequal Wilkinson power divider. For a substrate with h = 0.787 
mm and er = 2.2, the strip width is w = 0.17 mm for a conventional microstrip 
line, which is extremely challenging for many fabrication technologies. Thanks to 
the use of DGS, a transmission line with characteristic impedance of 158 Ω was 
obtained with a strip width w = 0.4 mm, almost 2.5 times wider than the conven-
tional microstrip line. The high impedance microstrip line is based on the use of 
two defects as shown in Figure 6.9.
As a side-effect, the use of defects in the ground planes permits reducing the 
component dimensions: more specifically, the length of a quarter-wavelength line

section reduces from 38.83 mm in the case of the conventional microstrip line to 
32.3 mm in the case of the DGS-loaded line, due to the slow-wave effect discussed 
in Section 6.2.2.
6.3	
Modeling of Dgs
The analysis and design of DGS-based circuits is more challenging than the mod-
eling of circuits based on conventional microstrip and coplanar lines. The first 
reason is that, other than common microstrip line or coplanar waveguide discon-
tinuities, no equivalent circuit models of DGS or DGS-loaded transmission lines 
are currently available in commercial circuit simulators. The second reason is the 
intrinsic complexity of the electromagnetic problem: in DGS-based circuits, a num-
ber of relevant electromagnetic effects need to be accounted for, like for instance 
the radiation leakage and the spurious coupling between the DGS and adjacent 
portions of the circuit. 
6.3.1  Full-Wave Modeling 
The rigorous electromagnetic modeling of DGS-based circuits requires the use of 
full-wave simulation tools. A variety of numerical techniques (either 2.5D or 3D) 
can be adopted for the full-wave modeling of DGS circuits, including the integral 
equation technique in conjunction with the method of moments, the finite element 
method, and the finite-difference time domain method. 
The complete analysis and (especially) the optimization procedure of DGS-
based circuits by a full-wave simulator, however, is a heavy and lengthy process. 
For this reason, it is avoided whenever possible, and it is replaced by the use of 
equivalent circuit models. 
Nevertheless, the use of full-wave simulators is important, because it permits 
to precisely understand and evaluate the physical aspects of DGS circuits (like the 
electric current path and the charge distribution): this analysis process has a para-
mount importance in the study of DGS circuits, as it allows deriving physical-based 
equivalent circuit models. 
6.3.2  Equivalent Circuit Models 
The development of accurate and physical-based equivalent circuit models allows 
for the fast modeling and design of DGS-loaded circuits, both in the case of iso-
lated and of periodic defects. Currently, equivalent circuit models of DGS are not 
included in the most used commercial simulators, and for this reason a significant 
amount of research has been devoted to the development of simple and accurate 
DGS equivalent models [5, 8, 10, 31–36]. 
Equivalent circuit models of DGS are usually derived from the frequency re-
sponse of a DGS-based circuit, computed by a full-wave simulator. In all cases, 
parametric equivalent models are needed, where the element values of the equiva-
lent models depend on the physical dimensions of the DGS. Physical-based models, 
which recall the physical geometry and current distribution of the DGS circuit, 

Microstrip Lines and Slotlines

allow for a better understanding of the behavior of the components and permit to 
exploit these physical insights in the optimization process. 
Simple LC Equivalent Circuit Model of DGS 
The simplest equivalent circuit model of DGS consists of a parallel LC circuit, al-
ready discussed in Sec. 6.2 to introduce the fundamental properties of DGS-based 
circuits (Figure 6.5b). This LC equivalent model is inspired by the resonance prop-
erties of DGS, which exhibit a stop-band at frequency f0 [5]. The element values 
L and C of the equivalent circuit model are directly obtained from the full-wave 
simulation of the structure as:
	
C =
ωc
2Z0 (ω0
2 - ωc
2) 	
(6.8a)
	
L =

ω0
2 C 	
(6.8b)
where w0 is the stop-band angular frequency and wc is the 3-dB cutoff angular fre-
quency, and Z0 represents the characteristic impedance of the input/output trans-
mission line [31]. This equivalent circuit model does not take into account any type 
of loss (possibly due to metal finite conductivity, dielectric loss angle, or radiation 
effects). 
As an example of this equivalent circuit model of DGS, the circuit based on the 
dumbbell-shaped DGS coupled with a microstrip line (introduced in Figure 6.1) is 
considered. The dimensions of the dumbbell defect are a = b = 5 mm, w = 2.4 mm, 
g = 0.5 mm, and the substrate has a thickness h = 31 mil and a dielectric permittiv-
ity er = 2.2. This circuit exhibits a stop-band frequency f0 = w0/(2p) = 8 GHz and

Defected Ground Structure (DGS)
a 3-dB cutoff frequency fc = wc/(2p) = 3.5 GHz. The characteristic impedance of 
the microstrip line is Z0 = 50 Ω. After calculating the values of C and L by using 
equations (6.8), the frequency response of the circuits can be computed through 
the equivalent circuit model shown in Figure 6.5b: the circuit simulation compares 
very well with the full-wave analysis results, as shown in Figure 6.10 [5]. 
In the design phase, the effect of the shape and size of the defect on L and C 
is taken into account, as discussed in Sec. 6.2. In the case of the dumbbell-shaped 
DGS, increasing the size of the DGS usually shifts down the resonance frequency f0, 
mainly due to the increased path length of the electric current density in the ground 
plane (that increases the value of inductance). 
Losses can be easily accounted for by adding a resistor in parallel to the LC 
resonator (Figure 6.11). Similarly to the case of L and C, the value of the resistance 
R can be obtained by the full-wave analysis:
	
R =
2Z0

where |S11(w0)| represents the magnitude of the input reflection coefficient, calcu-
lated at the stop-band angular frequency w0 [31]. In this case, the resistance R 
permits to take into account all types of losses, including dielectric, conductor, and 
radiation losses.
In the case of asymmetric DGS configuration, the frequency response can 
exhibit two different resonance frequencies: consequently, the equivalent circuit 
should be modified to deal with this structure, by considering two parallel RLC 
resonators connected in series [8].
Broadband Equivalent Circuit Models of DGS 
The parallel LC circuits (or the parallel RLC if losses need to be accounted for) 
represent easy and effective solutions for the equivalent circuit modeling of DGS. 
Nevertheless, as they are based on lumped elements, these equivalent circuits are 
able to exhibit only one pole. In some applications, conversely, it is important to 
carefully represent the broadband frequency behavior of the circuit, including peri-

odic replicas and spurious bands. For this reason, a different equivalent circuit has 
been developed, based on an inductor in parallel with a shorted stub (Figure 6.12). 
This type of equivalent circuit has been widely adopted in the literature, especially 
for the modeling of spiral defects in coplanar waveguide technology [10, 32–35]. 
In this model, the inductance L represents the quasi-static behavior, and the stub 
accounts for the effects of the resonances at high frequency. The values of the in-
ductance L and of the length and characteristic impedance of the stub are usually 
obtained by curve fitting of full-wave simulation data. 
More complex circuit topologies have also been proposed, with the aim to 
increase the number of degrees of freedom and, consequently, to guarantee the ac-
curacy of the model over a broader band. The broadband validity of the equivalent 
circuit models is particularly important for certain applications, like the design of 
power amplifiers, where the active devices need to be terminated with the proper 
impedance values at the harmonic frequencies. 
A p-type equivalent circuit model was proposed in [37]: in this equivalent mod-
el, the series element is a classical parallel RLC resonator, and the shunt elements 
are parallel RC circuits, which permit to take into account the fringing fields (and 
associated losses) at the discontinuity between the unperturbed transmission line 
and the DGS (Figure 6.13).
In this equivalent circuit model, the value of the lumped elements can be de-
rived either from the full-wave analysis of the structure [37], or from measured 
data of a prototype. The method is briefly described below.
Once the S-parameters of the structure have been determined, by either simula-
tions or measurements, the ABCD-parameters can be derived as:

In most cases, however, the values obtained by equations (6.13) represent a start-
ing point, and they are subsequently optimized by fitting the frequency response 
calculated with a full-wave simulation or measured data, with the aim to improve 
the accuracy of the model and its validity over a broad frequency band. 
Quasi-Static Equivalent Circuit Model of DGS 
A quasi-static equivalent circuit model of DGS was proposed in [38], based on a 
derivation approach that is quite different from the previous models. This equiva-
lent circuit was developed specifically for the case of the dumbbell-shaped defect 
shown in Figure 6.1, and it is based on the observation of the current path in the 
defected ground plane. As it appears from Figure 6.5a, the electric current density 
on the ground plane flows in a narrow strip along the periphery of the defect, be-
ing practically negligible elsewhere. For this reason, the structure can be simplified 
as shown in Figure 6.14a, where the defected ground plane is replaced by a set of 
narrow metal strips, located in the region where the current is more concentrated. 
The width of the metal strips, which is related to the inductance in the equivalent 
model, is selected on the basis of the current path observation. The filament model 
of the simplified ground plane is shown in Figure 6.14b: it includes a cross, located 
at the junction of the microstrip line and the DGS, two arms with straight sections 
and 90° bends, and another cross at the opposite side of the DGS. In the middle 
there is a gap, responsible for the capacitance in the equivalent model. 
The use of this filament model of the simplified geometry allows for developing 
the equivalent circuit model (Figure 6.15): the values of inductance and capaci-
tance elements are derived from the physical dimensions, by adopting quasi-static 
expressions for microstrip crosses, straight lines, bends, and gaps available in the 
literature. This approach guarantees a direct relation between the geometry of the 

326
Defected Ground Structure (DGS)
circuit and the equivalent model, with a clear physical understanding of the role of 
each geometrical dimension. 
This quasi-static approach permits to derive an equivalent circuit model with 
no need of full-wave simulations of the structure (except for a qualitative observa-
tion of the current path). However, also in this case, a better result can be achieved 
by adopting correction of the parameter values, based on the curve fitting of full-
wave simulations.

Applications of DGS 
A variety of components have been developed to exploit the useful features of DGS: 
in some cases, the frequency response of the components takes advantage of the 
band-stop properties of the DGS, in other structures the slow-wave characteristics 
of the DGS are exploited to reduce the size of the circuits, and in some components 
high-impedance transmission lines based on DGS allow overcoming possible fab-
rication issues.

6.4.1  DGS-Based Filters 
The first and most common application of DGS has been the implementation of 
planar filters, either in microstrip or in coplanar waveguide technology [5, 7, 20, 
26, 39–40]. In the framework of filter design, DGS have been adopted to exploit 
their band-stop effect with the aim to realize band-stop filters, as well as to improve 
the out-of-band performance of band-pass filters. 
Microstrip Low-Pass Filter 
A three-pole low-pass filter based on DGS and microstrip technology was proposed 
in [5]: it consists of a 50 Ω microstrip line with a pair of symmetric open stubs and 
two dumbbell defects etched in the ground plane (Figure 6.16a). The equivalent cir-

cuit model of this filter is shown in Figure 6.16b: each dumbbell defect is modeled 
as a parallel LC circuit (with inductance Ld and capacitance Cd), and the open stub 
is represented by a shunt capacitor (with capacitance Cs). At low frequency, the 
parallel LC circuits can be simplified and only the inductance Ld can be considered.

Therefore, with concern to the in-band frequency response, this filter topology 
allows to implement an equivalent circuit consisting of two series inductors and 
a shunt capacitor: the classical microstrip implementation of such a filter would 
require the use of a very thin (high impedance) microstrip line for realizing series 
inductors, which is not suited to high-power applications. Conversely, in this case, 
the same effect can be realized by using the DGS and 50 Ω microstrip line.
On the basis of the simplified equivalent circuit model, the value Ld (in con-
junction with the stub capacitance Cs) can be selected to optimize the in-band filter 
performance. More specifically, this filter was designed for a cutoff frequency of 
1.3 GHz and 0.01 dB ripple level. The resulting values for circuit elements are Ld = 
3.678 nH and Cs = 2.33 pF.
The presence of the capacitance Cd in parallel with Ld plays an important role 
in the out-of-band frequency response, because it allows to locate a transmission 
zero at the resonance frequency of the parallel LC circuit. The value Cd = 0.107 pF 
was selected to provide a band-stop frequency of 8 GHz. Thanks to the DGS, the 
out-of-band attenuation of this filter is better than a conventional microstrip filter. 
In [5], a measured out-of-band attenuation of 20 dB was achieved up to 8 GHz 
(Figure 6.16c). Moreover, in-band measured insertion and return losses are better 
than 0.15 and 20 dB, respectively, demonstrating a very low level of loss.
Band-Stop Filter in Coplanar Waveguide Technology
Periodic DGS can be adopted to design wideband band-stop filters. Specifically, the 
implementation of wideband band-stop filters based on DGS in coplanar wave-
guide technology was proposed in [26]. The DGS in this case consists of cascaded 
meander lines integrated in the ground plane of the coplanar waveguide. 
The use of a coplanar waveguide section with one single defect allows design-
ing a narrow band-stop filter [26]. In this case, the size of the defect practically de-
termines the stop-band frequency: a larger defect corresponds to a lower band-stop 
frequency, as well as to a more significant radiation loss. The cell with one single 
defect can be cascaded to obtain periodic DGS circuits, which exhibit more flexible 
characteristics. In particular, circuits based on four cells were designed in [26] to 
obtain wideband filters. The longitudinal separation of the DGS was optimized to 
achieve the deepest rejection, the widest bandwidth and the sharpest edges.
Two filters with different geometries of the DGS were designed and fabricated 
in [26], with different stop-band frequencies (Figure 6.17a). The first filter with 
smaller defects exhibits the stop band at 6 GHz, a bandwidth of 2.8 GHz, and a 
rejection better than 30 dB (Figure 6.17b). The second filter has larger defects: in 
this case, the stop band frequency is 3.7 GHz, the bandwidth is approximately 2.0 
GHz, and the rejection is larger than 25 dB (Figure 6.17c). In both cases, radiation 
loss appears to be very limited.
Tunable Filters
Tunable filters based on DGS and varactor diodes have been proposed in [25, 41].

ogy was proposed in [25]. The slot ring geometry allows to mount a varactor diode 
that provides frequency tuning capabilities: the varactor diode is mounted across 
the slot (Figure 6.3c), and the presence of the internal rectangular patch permits 
to connect a DC wire for biasing the varactor. In this modified configuration, the 
band-stop effect is due to the presence of the slot-ring DGS, and its stop-band fre-
quency depends not only on the geometry of the DGS, but also on the capacitance 
of the varactor diode: in the equivalent circuit model, the equivalent circuit of the 
varactor is located in parallel with the LC circuit that represents the DGS (shown 
in Figure 6.5b). The filter proposed in [25] exhibits two rejection bands, located at 
3.7 GHz and at 7.4 GHz, respectively. When changing the bias voltage, the varac-
tor diode allows achieving a relative tuning range of 19% of the rejection frequency 
in both bands, thus resulting in a tuning range of 700 MHz for the first band and 
1.4 GHz for the second.
A tunable band-pass filter with very broadband harmonic suppression, based 
on DGS loaded microstrip lines, was proposed in [41]. This filter exhibits two tun-
able bands, whose center frequencies can be modified by means of varactor diodes, 
connected to the microstrip lines. DGS are adopted to determine band-stop effects 
in the input and output feeding lines, in order to suppress the harmonics over a 
broad bandwidth. More specifically, the filter exhibits a tunable range of the first 
pass-band center frequency of 34% (from 0.85 to 1.2 GHz) with a practically 
constant 3-dB fractional bandwidth of 13%, and a tunable range of the second 
pass-band center frequency of 41% (from 1.40 to 2.14 GHz) with a 3-dB fractional 
bandwidth of 11%. In addition, the DGS determine a measured out-of-band rejec-
tion level better than 20 dB up to more than 20 GHz (ten times of second band-pass 
frequency), thus ensuring the complete suppression of harmonic frequencies over a 
very broad frequency range.
Coupled–Line Filters
DGS have been adopted to improve the performance and reduce the size of cou-
pled-line microstrip filters [42–43]. The use of DGS in the coupled-line filter design 
allows adding poles in the frequency response and to improve the out-of-band 
performance by incorporating additional transmission zeros. 
A three-pole coupled-line band-pass filter in microstrip configuration was pre-
sented in [42]. The filter is shown in Figs. 6.18a and b: it comprises a microstrip 
resonator, side-coupled with the input and output microstrip lines, and three de-
fects in the ground plane (two external bigger apertures and a central smaller aper-
ture, located below the microstrip resonator).
This band-pass filter was designed with a center frequency of 3 GHz, a 
2.9–3.1 GHz pass-band with a 0.01-dB ripple level and rejection of 40 dB up to 6 
GHz. The prototype was fabricated on a dielectric substrate with dielectric permit-
tivity er = 10.2 and thickness 1.27 mm.
The frequency response of the filter is shown in Figs. 6.18c: the microstrip reso-
nator and the two external defects in the ground plane are responsible for the three 
poles in the frequency response. The third defect, located below the microstrip 
resonator, determines a transmission zero at 5.9 GHz, which improves the out-of-
band rejection of the filter.

Miniaturized Ultra-Wideband (UWB) Filters
The use of DGS has been also investigated with the aim to improve the perfor-
mance of ultra-wideband (UWB) filters [44–47].
Compact UWB band-pass filters were proposed in [46], to cover the frequency 
band from 3.1 GHz to 10.6 GHz. The filter topology is based on a quarter-wave-
length low-impedance microstrip line, connected to a short-circuited stub, and cou-
pled to the input and output 50–Ω microstrip lines by inter-digital capacitors. The 
coupling of the inter-digital capacitors is tightened by the presence of H-shaped 
apertures, located in the ground plane below the capacitors. In addition, three pairs 
of tapered DGS located below quarter-wavelength microstrip line determine out-
of-band transmission zeros, thus suppressing spurious pass bands. The adopted 
substrate has a relative dielectric constant of 2.65 and the thickness of 1 mm. A 
prototype of the filter proposed in [46] exhibits a measured 3-dB pass band from 
2.8 GHz to 10.8 GHz, and the measured 20 dB rejection bandwidth extends up 
to more than 20 GHz. A modified version of this filter was also reported in [46], 
where a meandered slot is introduced in the input microstrip line to reject the un-
desired wireless local-area network (WLAN) radio (Figure 6.19): this meander line 
determines a notched band with center frequency of 5.47 GHz and width of about 
0.7 GHz, without affecting the remaining part of the frequency response.
6.4.2  Other DGS-Based Passive Components
Apart from filters, several classes of passive components have been proposed, where 
the application of DGS plays a fundamental role in performance improvement and 
size reduction [6, 8, 48–49]. They include, for instance, hybrid couplers, rat-race 
couplers, and Wilkinson power dividers.
DGS-based 10-dB Hybrid Coupler 
A 10-dB branch line coupler operating at 1.8 GHz was proposed in [48], and im-
plemented in microstrip technology combined with DGS. This type of component 
is not very common in microstrip technology: in fact, differently from classical 
3-dB and 6–dB hybrid couplers, 10-dB couplers require very thin microstrip lines 
with a large characteristic impedance. For instance, the branch line coupler with 
l0-dB coupling presented in [48] requires two pairs of quarter-wavelength trans-
mission lines with characteristic impedances of 150 Ω and of 47.4 Ω, respectively. 
While the implementation of a microstrip line with characteristic impedance of 
47.4 Ω is not an issue, realizing a microstrip line with characteristic impedance of 
150 Ω is quite unpractical: on a substrate with a dielectric permittivity of 2.2 and a 
thickness of 31 mils, the width of the strip would be only 0.2 mm.
The solution found in [48] is based on the use of DGS, which allows imple-
menting high impedance transmission lines. In the branch coupler shown in Figure 
6.20, the horizontal lines exhibit 150 Ω characteristic impedance and are imple-
mented by adopting microstrip lines with defects in the ground plane: thanks to 
the use of the defects, the strips exhibit a width of 1 mm, five times wider than the 
width of a conventional microstrip line with the same characteristic impedance.

Conversely, the vertical lines present 50 Ω characteristic impedance and are based 
on conventional microstrip lines.
A further advantage of the defected microstrip line is the higher power han-
dling capability, which is related to larger width of the conductor line. In addition, 
the quarter wavelength of the defected microstrip line is 26 mm on the adopted 
substrate, compared to 31 mm when using the conventional microstrip line.

Defected Ground Structure (DGS)
Rat-Race Hybrid Coupler 
DGS were applied in [49] to the design of a compact microstrip rat-race hybrid 
coupler. In these components, the DGS play a two-fold role: they allow achieving a 
significant reduction in size of the rat-race coupler, and they lead to an improved re-
jection of the harmonics in the frequency response. It consists of a classical rat-race 
microstrip coupler, with six dumbbell DGS located in the ground plane below the 
microstrip ring. The presence of the DGS allows to reduce the size of the compo-
nent, due to the slow-wave effect, and to suppress the undesired harmonic replicas 
in the frequency response, thanks to the band-stop effect.
A prototype operating at 1.48 GHz was fabricated on a dielectric substrate 
with a relative permittivity er = 2.5 and a thickness of 25 mil [49]. The reduction 
in length of the microstrip ring with respect to a conventional rat-race coupler was 
approximately 41%. Measurements performed on the prototype showed an inser-
tion loss comparable to that of a conventional rat-race coupler and a suppression 
of the third harmonic below –30 dB.
Wilkinson Power Divider based on DGS High Impedance Transmission Lines
A 4:1 unequal power divider, based on the Wilkinson topology and operating at 
1.5 GHz, was proposed in [6]. This component adopts DGS defects in the ground 
plane to implement high-impedance microstrip lines. 
The circuit topology of a conventional N:1 unequal Wilkinson power divider 
is shown in Figure 6.21a: the divider is based on two quarter-wavelength transmis-
sion lines with characteristic impedances Z2 and Z3, and a resistor Rint. In particu-
lar, when considering an input line with characteristic impedance Z0 = 50 Ω, the 
design of a 4:1 divider requires to adopt the characteristic impedance of the first 
branch Z2 = 39.5 Ω and the characteristic impedance of the second branch Z3 = 
158.1 Ω.
In [6], two defects in the ground plane were adopted to implement the high-
impedance microstrip line (Figs. 6.21b and 6.21c). In this way, the width of the 
conductor of the DGS-based microstrip line was 0.4 mm (er =2.2 and h = 0.787 
mm): a conventional microstrip line with characteristic impedance of 158 Ω, on the 
same substrate, would require a conductor width of 0.17 mm.
The prototype reported in [6] shows excellent matching and isolation perfor-
mance, and with very accurate dividing ratios of 1 dB and 7 dB at port 2 and port 
3 over the frequency range from 1.2 to 1.8 GHz.
DGS Wilkinson Power Divider with Harmonic Suppression 
A 3-dB Wilkinson power divider, proposed in [8], adopts asymmetric spiral defects 
to effectively suppress the second and third harmonics in the frequency response. 
The prototype of the power divider is shown in Figure 6.22. The strip side of the 
circuit resembles a conventional Wilkinson divider, while two spiral defects are 
etched in the back side ground plane. The spiral DGS are inserted into the quarter-
wave transmission lines of the Wilkinson power divider. In particular, asymmetric 
spiral DGS are adopted in this circuit: the equivalent circuit of each asymmetric spi-
ral defect corresponds to the series of two parallel LC circuits: consequently, these 
defects are able to provide two different resonant frequencies and, consequently,

two rejection bands. This property guarantees the suppression of the second and 
third harmonics in the frequency response of the circuit. In particular, experimental 
results from [8] demonstrate an 18-dB suppression of the second harmonic and 15-
dB suppression of the third harmonic, respectively. In addition, the use of asymmet-
ric DGS leads to a length reduction of the quarter-wavelength transmission lines by

6.4.3  DGS-Based Active Circuits
The use of DGS may be particularly effective in the design of active circuits such as 
amplifiers and mixers [10, 50–55]. DGS allow improving the performance of active 
components, as their band-stop properties permits to reduce the detrimental effect 
of high-order harmonics. In addition, the slow-wave effect of DGS can be exploited 
to reduce the component dimensions. 
DGS-Based Amplifier with Improved Efficiency 
The band-stop features of DGS have been adopted to improve the efficiency of 
power amplifiers [50]. The performance improvement is obtained by adding a 
DGS-based transmission line with a wide stop band at the output of a class-A 
power amplifier, based on a GaAs FET and operating in the frequency band from 
4.3 GHz to 4.7 GHz. A 50–Ω microstrip line with dumbbell defects in the ground

plane was adopted. The band-stop effect of the DGS transmission line allows to 
significantly reduce the amplitude of the undesired harmonic frequencies. In par-
ticular, in the case of the amplifier proposed in [50], the amplitude of the output 
signal at the second harmonic is reduced from around –20 dBm to less than –45 
dBm. The power amplifier exhibits an improved output power and power added 
efficiency up to 5% compared to an identical power amplifier without DGS.

The size of power amplifiers can be reduced by adopting DGS, by exploiting their 
properties of slow-wave propagation. An interesting solution was proposed for an 
amplifier based on a HEMT device, operating in the frequency band from 2 GHz 
to 2.3 GHz, presented in [51]. In order to reduce the size of the component, dumb-
bell DGS are introduced in the microstrip lines of the matching networks of the 
amplifier. Due to the effect of slow-wave propagation, the DGS-loaded microstrip 
line exhibits a longer electrical length than that of the conventional microstrip line 
for the same physical length. For this reason, by adopting DGS-loaded microstrip 
lines in the input and output matching networks of the amplifier, the overall length 
size of the amplifier in [51] reduces by more than 50%, while keeping practically 
unchanged electrical performance.

Defected Ground Structure (DGS)
Doherty Power Amplifier Based on DGS
Both stop-band effect and slow-wave propagation have been exploited in the Do-
herty power amplifier proposed in [52] (Figure 6.23). Adding dumbbell-shaped 
DGS in the output quarter-wavelength impedance inverters of the carrier amplifier 
allows providing a suitable termination impedance at the harmonic frequencies 
and, at the same time, to shorten the length of the transmission lines, thus reducing 
the overall circuit dimension. 
6.4.4  DGS-Based Antennas 
A variety of applications have been proposed for DGS in the field of antennas, in 
particular patch antennas [56–59]: DGS permit to improve the port isolation in 
dual-polarized antennas, to suppress undesired cross-polarized radiation, and to 
reduce higher-order harmonics in active antennas. 
High Isolation Dual-Polarized Patch Antenna 
DGS can be used in the design of dual-polarized patch antennas, with the aim to 
significantly improve the port isolation. An example of this application was re-
ported in [57], where a dual-frequency orthogonally polarized rectangular patch 
antenna is fed by two microstrip lines, connected to two adjacent sides of the patch 
(Figure 6.24). The patch is designed to resonate at 2 GHz for one polarization and 
at 2.5 GHz for the other polarization, respectively. The feeding line of the patch are 
75-Ω microstrip lines, implemented on a dielectric substrate with relative dielectric 
permittivity er = 2.33 and thickness of 0.787 mm. To improve the port isolation, 
two spiral DGS were inserted under the feed line of the 2 GHz port (Figure 6.24): in 
this way, the defected feed line exhibits a stop band in the frequency range 2.4–2.8 
GHz. The position of the defects was optimized, to avoid a variation of the an-

tenna input matching. Experimental results in [57] demonstrated an improvement 
of 20 dB in the port isolation, compared to the case without DGS.
Microstrip Patch Antenna with DGS for Cross Polarization Suppression
Another useful application of DGS in the design of antennas is related to the reduc-
tion of cross-polarization in linearly-polarized patch antennas. An example of a 
patch antenna integrated with DGS was presented in [59]: it consists of a circular 
metal patch, fed from underneath via a coaxial probe. The DGS consist of two 
small circular apertures in the ground plane, symmetrically located below the edges 
of the circular patch (Figure 6.25). The position of circular apertures are selected in 
such a way that they do now affect the electromagnetic field of the dominant mode, 
corresponding to the co-polarization contribution of radiation, and they suppress 
the occurrence of the orthogonal mode, responsible for the cross-polarization ra-

diation. A prototype presented in [59] was implemented on a dielectric substrate 
with relative dielectric permittivity er = 2.32 and thickness of 1.575 mm, and it is 
intended for operation at the frequency of 3.6 GHz. The use of DGS permits a sup-
pression of the cross-polarization contribution by 5 to 8 dB around the broadside 
direction, with no significant modification of the co-polarized radiation. 
Harmonics Reduction with DGS for a Microstrip Patch Antenna 
In active patch antennas, the antenna represents the load of the active circuit, and 
therefore it should provide the proper impedance termination both for the funda-
mental frequency and for the higher-order harmonics. The use of DGS in active 
patch antennas results an efficient way to achieve the proper impedance termi-
nation and to suppress the radiation at higher-order harmonic frequencies. This 
effect was demonstrated in [56] by adding an H-shaped slot in the ground plane 
of a rectangular patch antenna, just below the feed point where the microstrip is 
connected to the patch (Figure 6.26). The patch antenna is designed to operate at 
the fundamental frequency of 1.82 GHz, while the H-shaped slot is optimized to 
attenuate more than 20 dB the input signal of the antenna at the second and third 
harmonics. A prototype implemented on a dielectric substrate with permittivity 
er = 2.2 and thickness 0.508 mm was presented in [56]: this solution yields a signifi-
cant harmonic suppression (>20 dB), and a good performance at the fundamental 
frequency, with 4.8 dB gain and return loss >10 dB.

Coplanar Lines: Coplanar Waveguide  
and Coplanar Strips
7.1	
Introduction
The term coplanar is used for those transmission lines/waveguides where all the 
conductors reside in the same plane; namely, on the top surface of the substrate. 
These include slotline, coplanar waveguide (CPW), coplanar strips (CPS), and their 
variants. The slotline has been discussed in Chapter 5. coplanar waveguide, copla-
nar strips, and their variants are discussed in this chapter. Some of the advantages 
of these two lines arise from the fact that the mounting of lumped (active or pas-
sive) components in shunt or series configuration is much easier, drilling of holes 
through the substrate is not needed to reach the ground plane, and transition to 
slotline is less cumbersome, thereby allowing greater flexibility in the use of mixed 
transmission media. The performance of coplanar lines is comparable to and some-
times even better than microstrip line in terms of guide wavelength, dispersion, 
and losses. Active elements such as MESFETs can easily be connected to coplanar 
lines because they are also coplanar in nature. Consequently, coplanar lines are 
used commonly in monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMICs). Coplanar 
lines have some disadvantages also, such as parasitic modes, lower power-handling 
capability, and field nonconfinement.
The coplanar waveguide was proposed by Wen [1] in 1969. As shown in Figure 
7.1(a) it consists of two slots each of width W printed on a dielectric substrate. The 
spacing between the slots is denoted by S. The electric and magnetic field configu-
rations for quasi-static approximation are shown in Figure 7.1(b). The coplanar 
waveguide is not a waveguide, but a transmission line, because it is a two-conduc-
tor geometry and its dominant mode is TEM. At higher frequencies, the mode of 
propagation in the CPW becomes non-TEM because a longitudinal component 
of the magnetic field exists. In such a case the CPW has an elliptically polarized 
magnetic field in the slots at the air-dielectric interface and becomes suitable for 
nonreciprocal ferrite devices.
A configuration of coplanar strips, which is complementary to the CPW, is 
shown in Figure 7.2(a). It consists of two strips, generally of equal width W on a 
dielectric substrate. The spacing between the strips is denoted by S. The electric 
and magnetic field configurations are shown in Figure 7.2(b). In the lower range of 
microwave frequencies, the CPS is also useful for carrying signals for high-speed 
computer circuits.

348
Coplanar Lines: Coplanar Waveguide and Coplanar Strips 
The conventional coplanar waveguide, introduced by Wen [1], cannot be used 
as such because of the requirement of infinitely thick substrate. For practical ap-
plications substrate thickness has to be finite as in Figure 7.3(a). Also, the ground 
planes of actual CPW have finite widths as in Figure 7.3(b). The split ground 
planes are forced at the same potential all along the line by means of conductive 
air bridges at regular intervals. The spacing between the air bridges should be less 
than 0.1λ. The width of the ground planes should be kept as small as possible since 
it has a direct bearing on the maximum line density and the circuit size achievable 
in coplanar circuits. The fields of a CPW are less confined than those of microstrip 
lines, thereby making them more sensitive to covers or shields placed above the 
guide (see Figure 7.3(c)). It is very tempting to introduce a conductor backing 
(see Figures 7.3(d, e)), to improve both the mechanical strength and the power-

tions in CPW.

handling capability. Moreover, it allows easy implementation of mixed CPW-mi-
crostrip circuits. In MMIC applications, the semiconductor substrates are usually 
thin and fragile. They are mounted on low permittivity materials such as quartz. 
Some applications may require a dielectric overlay or a multilayered configuration 
as shown in Figure 7.3(f). Sometimes, it is desirable to adjust the characteristic 
impedance of a CPW by changing the width of one of the slots, keeping the rest of 
the parameters unchanged. This configuration is called the asymmetric CPW (see 
Figures 7.3(g, h)). The effect of all these modifications (in conventional CPW) on 
propagation will be studied next, in order to exploit the flexibility provided by the 
additional parameters such as the cover height, lateral ground plane width, asym-
metry, and multilayer configuration.

Methods of analysis for CPW and CPS are discussed in the following section. De-
sign considerations for these lines are presented in Sections 7.3 through 7.5. Copla-
nar lines are compared with microstrip and slotline in Section 7.6. Various kinds of 
CPW transitions are described in Section 7.7, and CPW discontinuities are
treated in Section 7.8. Circuits using CPW are included in Section 7.9.

Analysis
Coplanar lines have been studied using the quasi-static approximation and the 
fullwave analyses [1–17]. Wen [1] has conducted a quasi-static analysis of these 
transmission lines using conformal mapping, with the assumption that the dielec-
tric substrate is thick enough to be considered infinite. Conformal transformation 
has also been applied to take into account the effects of the finite thickness of the 
dielectric substrate, finite size of the ground planes, upper shield, ground plane 
below the substrate as in microstrip line, structural asymmetry, and multilayer con-
figuration. A fullwave analysis of coplanar lines, which provides information re-
garding frequency dependence of phase velocity and characteristic impedance, has 
been carried out by a number of investigators. The techniques employed include 
Galerkin’s method in the spectral domain [2–12], variational methods [13–15], in-
tegral equation [16], relaxation method [17], method of lines [18], mode-matching 
technique [19], and finite-difference time-domain technique [20–21].
7.2.1  Quasi-Static Conformal Mapping Analysis of CPW
The basic approach used in the conformal transformation method, as applied to 
coplanar lines, is to assume that all the dielectric interfaces in the structure, includ-
ing slots, can be replaced by magnetic walls [22]. This assumption is strictly valid 
for those structure for which the electric field lies along the dielectric interfaces. 
Under this assumption, half-planes above and below the metallization plane of the 
structure can be analyzed separately for line capacitance. The total line capacitance 
is then the algebraic sum of the two capacitances. If the electric field is not symmet-
ric across the slots, the magnetic wall assumption is not justified. However, we can 
reduce the error associated with this assumption if we employ partial capacitance 
approximation (PCA) [22].
Partial Capacitance Approximation (PCA)
In PCA, the line capacitance is determined as C = Ca + Cs where Ca is the line ca-
pacitance of transmission line geometry obtained by replacing the substrate by air 
medium, and Cs is the line capacitance contributed by the dielectric layer assumed 
to have the relative permittivity (er – 1), and the term –1 compensates for inclusion 
of similar capacitance in Ca. In PCA, all the interfaces are embedded with magnetic 
walls. The PCA approximation yields exact results for infinitely thick substrates 
and for substrate thickness h → 0 [23]; it has been found to provide accuracy bet-
ter than 3% for multilayered CPW [141]. The magnetic wall assumption at the 
dielectric interfaces of CPS, however, appears to be suspect in the region outside 
the slot [142]. The effect of metallization thickness on the validity of magnetic wall 
assumption is not known.
The conformal mapping of coplanar lines gives rise to analytical expressions 
for the effective dielectric constant and characteristic impedance in terms of the ra-
tio of complete elliptic integral of the first kind and its complement. These expres-
sions can easily be computed using scientific calculators and the effect of various 
parameters understood clearly. The accuracy of analytical expressions are compa-
rable with fabrication tolerances and measurement accuracy achievable.

Coplanar Lines: Coplanar Waveguide and Coplanar Strips 
For the various types of coplanar lines discussed in this section one attempts to 
determine suitable mapping functions so that the given configuration of coplanar 
lines is transformed into capacitors connected in parallel.
Since we are dealing with the quasi-static approximation of the mode of propa-
gation, the values of phase velocity vph and the characteristic impedance Z0 can be 
written as

where c is the velocity of electromagnetic waves in free space, C is the total capaci-
tance per unit length of the coplanar line, and Ca is the capacitance of the corre-
sponding line with all the dielectrics replaced by air.
Specific coplanar line configurations and the corresponding transformations 
are discussed next. The strip and the ground plane metallization thickness is con-
sidered negligible in deriving the various expressions. The capacitance for the half-
plane with air as dielectric is denoted by C1 and that due to the dielectric layer
is denoted by C2.
CPW with Infinitely Thick Substrate [1]
Making use of the symmetry of the CPW structure, consider only one-half of it 
for conformal transformation, as shown in Figure 7.4(a). The Schwarz-Christoffel 
transformation, which maps the dielectric portion of the z-plane of Figure 7.4(a)
into the interior of a rectangle in the w-plane of Figure 7.4(b) with the conductor
surfaces on the top and the bottom, is given by

The value of the characteristic impedance computed using (7.11) and (7.12) is 
plotted in Figure 7.5(a) for GaAs substrate, er = 13 [26] (see the curve for h/b = ∞). 
The line impedance is found to decrease almost logarithmically as the aspect ratio 
a/b increases.
For practical applications the substrate thickness of a CPW has to be finite. 
This configuration is discussed next.
CPW with Finite Dielectric Thickness h
For the analysis of this structure (Figure 7.3a) we invoke the assumption that the 
capacitance due to the lower half-plane is the sum of the free-space capacitance 
and the capacitance of the dielectric layer with permittivity (er – 1). The free-space 
capacitance for the lower half-plane is exactly the same as that for the upper half-
plane. It was calculated earlier and is denoted by C1. The capacitance of the dielec-
tric layer is calculated next.
A pair of transformations is used to transform the CPW into a parallel plate 
structure. The first transformation converts this CPW into a conventional CPW, 
that is, CPW with infinitely thick substrate. This transformation is
	
t = sinh πz

⎛

(7.14b)
The configuration of Figure 7.6(b) is identical to that of the conventional CPW in 
Figure 7.4(a) that was discussed earlier. Therefore, capacitance C2 is given by

total capacitance C is therefore given by
	
C = 2C1 + C2 	
and
	
Ca = 2C1

It may be observed from (7.19a) that the filling factor does not depend on the rela­
tive dielectric constant of the substrate layer. Through ki, it depends on the dielec­tric 
thickness, strip width, and slot width. It may be defined in terms of the capaci-
tances as [24]

(7.20)
It may be noted from a comparison of (7.11) and (7.20) that the effect of finite di-
electric thickness is to decrease the effective dielectric constant of the CPW. Figure 
7.5 shows that the relative effective dielectric constant decreases with a decrease in 
h and therefore the characteristic impedance increases. Since the impedance curves 
for h = 3b and h = 10b coincide with each other, h > 3b for Z0cp to be independent 
of h for er = 4. For a given set of substrate parameters h and er, a given value of 
characteristic impedance can be realized using different combinations of a and b; 
the final choice is determined by factors such as conductor loss of line.
Conformal mapping analysis of entire cross-section of CPW with finite thick-
ness substrate has been reported [21,133]. This analysis does not employ partial 
capacitance decomposition. The lower boundary of the substrate appears as an 
elliptic void in the lower-half of the parallel plate capacitor in W-plane. The line

capacitance is therefore calculated numerically from the inhomogeneously filled 
capacitor. The results for er = 10,120 are reported in [21].
Practical coplanar waveguides have finite width ground planes. This geometry 
is analyzed next.
CPW with Finite Dielectric Thickness and Finite Width Ground PIanes [23]
The lateral extent of the ground planes of a CPW (Figure 7.3(b)) is denoted by c0. 
In this case, the capacitance C1 for the upper half-plane is determined by trans-
forming the first-quadrant of the CPW (see Figure 7.7(a)) into the upper half of the 
t-plane (see Figure 7.7(b)) by using the mapping function
	
t = z2

Veyres and Fouad Hanna [22] have used different sets of conformal transforma-
tions, but the expressions for C1 and C2 obtained by them are identical with those 
obtained above. Evaluating (7.28) and (7.29) shows that the line impedance in-
creases (see Figure 7.9) and relative effective dielectric constant decreases due to 
the truncation of ground planes. This configuration can also support a quasi-TEM 
slotline mode, whose characteristic impedance could be comparable to the desired 
mode. To suppress this mode, lateral ground planes are kept at the same potential 
by means of properly spaced conductive air bridges [23].
CPW with Finite Dielectric Thickness and a Cover Shield [23]
For this configuration (Figure 7.3(c)) the capacitance Ca can be divided into two 
portions: that due to the air region in the half-plane below the CPW metalization 
and that due to the air region between the cover shield and the CPW metalization,
or C′1 and C″1. The expression for C′1 is the same as that of C1 of (7.8b).

The effect of cover height h1 on Z0cp appears through the factor K(k5)/K′(k5). For a 
large value of cover height h1, (7.37) reduces to (7.20). Due to the additional term 
in (7.37) compared to (7.20), the line impedance decreases for a shielded CPW. As 
a conservative estimate the cover height should be at least four times the substrate 
thickness for the effect of the cover to be negligible.
Conductor-Backed CPW with a Cover Shield [23]
In this configuration (Figure 7.3(d)) the lower surface of the substrate is metalized. 
Therefore, the lower half and upper half portions of the CPW are similar except 
for different dielectric constants and thicknesses. Consequently, the capacitance C2 
contributed by the dielectric layer can be obtained from the same transformation 
that is used for the upper half portion. The resulting capacitance is

h1 = h; that is, conductor backing and the cover shield are equidistant from CPW 
metallization. This results in ere = (er + 1)/2.

Conductor backing of the substrate improves the mechanical strength of the line 
so that thin substrates may be used. However, conductor backing concentrates 
the fields in the substrate giving rise to increase in effective dielectric constant of 
the line and the consequent decrease in characteristic impedance; compare Figures 
7.11 and 7.5. This is possible if the lower ground conductor is nearer to the central 
strip than the lateral ground conductors. The mode may become quasi-TEM as 
in microstrip line. Alternatively, the microstrip-like behavior becomes dominant 
when the substrate is thin and the slots are wide such that W/h > 2. If the aim is 
to obtain coplanar behavior, the substrate should be thick and the slots should be 
narrow so that W/h  1. For a moderate aspect ratio, for example, S/2h = 1/3 and  
W/h = 2/3, the conductor-backed CPW becomes less dispersive than the corre-
sponding microstrip line with the same aspect ratio, W/h = 2/3 [8]. Conductor-
backed CPW also supports leaky modes, which will be discussed later.

Multilayered CPW Configuration [24]
For a multilayered structure (Figure 7.3(f)) the effective dielectric constant can be 
expressed as
	
εre = q1εr1 + q2εr2 + q3εr3 ... + qnεrn 	
(7.44)
where q1, q2, . . . , q4 describe the filling factors for the various dielectric regions. 
To illustrate how to obtain the filling factors for a multilayered CPW we shall first 
consider the double-layered CPW configurations discussed earlier.
For the double-layered geometries we obtained expressions for ere in the form
	
εre = 1 + q εr - 1

The effective dielectric constant of the CPW in Figure 7.3(f) follows from the use of 
q1, q2, q3, and q4 in (7.44). The characteristic impedance can be determined from
ere and ca. The parallel plate capacitor in the w-plane, corresponding to Figure 
7.3(f), is shown in Figure 7.12.
The above analysis can be extended to any number of dielectric layers in a 
CPW.
Variants of CPW 
(i) Conductor-Backed Asymmetric CPW 
This geometry is similar to asymmetric CPW with finite dielectric thickness (Fig-
ure 7.3(h)) with the difference that the lower surface of the substrate is metallized 
as shown in Figure 7.13(a). Unlike a symmetric coplanar waveguide, the slots on 
either side of the strip are of unequal width in an asymmetric coplanar waveguide 
(ACPW). Unequal slot widths may occur due to fabrication tolerances. Sometimes 
unequal slot widths are desirable to introduce flexibility in design. If S1 and S2 are 
the slot widths defined as S1 = b1 – a and S2 = b2 – a, respectively, the asymmetry 
parameter of the line is defined as S2/S1. The conductor backing provides mechani-
cal strength, reduces radiation, and is useful in heat dissipation. Due to the confine-
ment of fields by the conductor backing, the effective dielectric constant increases 
and characteristic impedance of the line decreases.

For conformal mapping analysis of the line, we make the usual assumption of in-
serting magnetic wall across the slots [134]. As a result, the line capacitance may be 
decomposed as C = C1 + C2 where C1 is the capacitance contributed by the electric 
field in the air region, and C2 is the capacitance contributed by the field in the sub-
strate portion. Two conformal mappings are employed to determine C2, the first 
mapping transforms the conductor-backed dielectric into an infinitely thick dielec-
tric without conductor backing, and the second mapping transforms this geometry 
into parallel plate geometry. The mapping from the z-plane to t-plane in this region 
is defined as [134]

(

(

(
) 	 (7.58)
The geometry in the t-plane (Figure 7.13(b)), is an asymmetric CPW with homo-
geneous dielectric below the strips. The transformation which maps the dielectric 
region in the t-plane into the interior of a rectangle in the w-plane of Figure 7.13(c) 
is given by

The electric field distribution in the line could be useful in understanding the phys-
ics of the problem such as conductor loss in the line. The field distribution can be 
determined by mapping the points from the w-plane to z-plane. It is found that 
the field is concentrated about the slot edges and the electric field at the conductor 
backing is very small [134].
(ii) Asymmetric CPW with Infinitely Thick Substrate or No Substrate
The cross-section of this ACPW is shown in Figure 7.3(g). Because of half-space on 
either side of metallization plane, the electric field is symmetric and we can insert 
magnetic walls across the slots. The line capacitance C1 for the fields in upper-half 
portion is given by (7.62). Similarly, the line capacitance for the fields in lower-half 
portion is erC1. The total line capacitance therefore adds to

Figure 7.14 shows the effect of slot asymmetry on the relative effective dielec-
tric constant and characteristic impedance of CPW. The asymmetry factor S2/S1 is 
varied from 1 to 10. It is observed that the line asymmetry (S2 > S1) causes ere to 
decrease and Z0 to increase compared to the symmetric line case, S2 = S1. However, 
the increase in strip width 2a for the same asymmetry factor reduces this differ-
ence perhaps because increased strip width reduces coupling between the slots. The 
line characteristics remain unchanged if the slots are interchanged. Therefore, the 
curves of Figure 7.14 are also applicable for the corresponding values of S1/S2.
7.2.2  Quasi-Static Conformal Mapping Analysis of CPS
Coplanar strips (CPS), like coplanar waveguide, offer flexibility in the design of 
planar microwave and millimeter-wave circuits in that lumped devices can be 
mounted in series as well as in shunt. It is easier to realize high line impedances 
with CPS than with CPW. Further, CPS is a balanced transmission line such as a 
slotline and is useful in balanced circuit design such as mixers and modulators and 
as interconnects in high-speed digital circuits. Coplanar strips are widely used in 
integrated optic traveling wave modulators [32,33] and optical control microwave 
attenuators and modulators [34]. Like CPW, practical CPS lines use a finite thick-
ness substrate. The geometry of this line and its field distributions are shown in 
Figure 7.2. Due to fabrication tolerances we may end up with a CPS in which the 
two strips do not have the same width. This line is called an asymmetric CPS or 
ACPS. Sometimes, it is desirable to use an asymmetric CPS to adjust the character-
istic impedance by changing the width of one of the strips while keeping the width 
of the other strip and the slot width fixed. The asymmetric CPS geometry is shown 
in Figure 7.15(a,b,c).

Coplanar Lines: Coplanar Waveguide and Coplanar Strips 
Conformal mapping analysis of CPS suffers from inaccuracies because the as-
sumption of magnetic walls at the dielectric interfaces is not justified. This as-
sumption works well for CPS with a homogeneous dielectric on either side of strip 
plane such as an infinitely thick substrate. For finite substrate thickness, it has been 
observed that the complementary nature of a metallization pattern between CPS 
and CPW may be utilized along with duality to determine ere (i.e., the value of ere 
obtained for CPW may be used for CPS also for the same value of S/W [24, 40]). 
According to Zhu et al. [135], duality between CPS and CPW for ere may be em-
ployed provided h/b > 5. The assumption of duality for multi-layered coplanar lines 
has been tested in [132]. For a case study with five layers, the difference between 
theory and measurements of time delay was 3% for CPW geometry and 6% for 
the corresponding CPS geometry. The analysis in [133] shows that in general the 
difference |ere
cpw – ere
cps| decreases with increase in dielectric thickness and decrease 
in |eri – erj| where eri and erj represent the relative permittivity of contiguous ith and 
jth layers, respectively.

in Figure 7.16 for the same aspect ratio S/(S + 2W). It is observed that CPW and

Conformal mapping analysis of entire cross-section of CPS with finite thickness 
substrate has been reported [133]. This analysis does not employ partial capaci-
tance decomposition. The parallel plate capacitor in the W-plane is inhomogene-
ously filled. The line capacitance is therefore calculated numerically. The results for

(iv) CPS with Lateral Ground Planes on Finitely Thick Substrate [43]
The presence of lateral ground planes in this configuration (Figure 7.15(d)) reduc-
es line to line coupling and eliminates the parasitic TE0 dielectric slab waveguide 
mode of a conventional CPS. The configuration of this CPS line is complementary 
to the CPW with finite width ground planes (see Figure 7.3(b)). It may be assumed 
that the propagation constant is the same for complementary lines in the quasi-
static limit [44]. Therefore, the effective dielectric constant of this CPS line is given 
by (7.28). The characteristic impedance is, however, given by the expression
	
Z0cs = 120π

where k3 is defined by (7.23). It is found that this line is less dispersive compared 
to a conventional CPS. Further, lower values of characteristic impedance can be 
obtained by adjusting the width of the outer slots [40].
We have made two assumptions in this quasi-static analysis: (1) modeling of 
the slots and dielectric interfaces by magnetic walls, and (2) the filling factor is not
a function of the type of dielectric interface but depends only on the physical di-
mensions of the dielectric layers. The first assumption leads to exact results in the 
limiting cases when the substrate thickness approaches zero or infinity or when the 
substrate is replaced by air. For other cases this assumption has been verified in 
[24]. However, comprehensive comparisons with results from a rigorous fullwave 
analysis should be carried out to determine the accuracy of the above assumptions.
Hybrid-mode analysis is described next, and the propagation characteristics of co-
planar lines based on the conformal mapping method and the hybrid-mode ap-
proach are compared. Higher order modes are also described.

line (Section 5.2) only in selection of the basis functions, which now correspond to 
the physical configuration (Figure 7.1(a)) and the field distribution of a CPW. The

The details of the method are similar to those used for analyzing microstrip

for the guide wavelength of a CPW with finite dielectric thickness [14]. The basis 
functions used are the Chebyshev polynomials of (7.95). A good agreement is ob-
served. Fullwave analysis for other configurations of CPW have been reported in 
[8, 45, 46]. Higher order modes in a CPW have also been investigated by using 
the above method of analysis [3, 14]. In [14] the substrate used is sapphire, which 
is anisotropic in nature with e⊥ = 9.4 and e11 = 11.6. The results are presented in 
Figure 7.19 for h = 1 mm, a = 0.25 mm, and b = 1.25 mm. The normalized propa-
gation constant for the dominant even and odd modes, first higher order mode, 
and TM0 mode for a grounded sapphire substrate are plotted as functions of fre-
quency. It is seen from the figure that the undesired odd mode can propagate down 
to dc. However, this mode can be suppressed by connecting both the ground plane 
conductors together by wires or air bridges. Dispersion characteristics of the first 
higher order mode of the CPW and the TM0 mode for a grounded slab are found to 
be similar. The characteristic impedance calculated using the voltage-current defini-
tion of (7.100) compares favourably at low frequencies with those calculated using 
the quasi-static approximation [14].
Coplanar Strips (CPS)
Fullwave analysis using Galerkin’s method in the spectral domain has also been 
conducted for coplanar strips. In this case, the problem is formulated in terms of 
surface currents Jx and Jz on the strips. These currents are expressed in terms of sets 
of basis functions as

A first-order solution, which is accurate enough for narrow strips, is obtained as-
suming that the transverse surface current Jx is negligible. However, for wide strips 
and for better accuracy both the components of current density should be consid-
ered. The basis functions Jxm(x) are of the same form as Exn(x) for CPW. Similarly, 
Jxn(x) are identical with Ezm(x). These are given [7] as

The ± sign for the two different strips, for even values of n and m, accounts for 
proper symmetry of the current distribution. In (7.104), x′ = x + x0 for the left 
strip and x′ = x – x0 for the right strip. The normalized propagation constant for 
symmetric CPS is plotted as a function of frequency in Figure 7.20 [47] as the 
substrate chosen has er = 10.5. It is observed that b/k0 for the CPS mode increases 
very slowly with frequency. Therefore, over the bandwidth of components, ere = 
(b/k0)2 can be considered to be almost constant. Dispersion curves for the surface 
wave modes TM0 and TM1 are also shown in this figure. Break points in the disper-
sion curve for the CPS mode occur whenever b/k0 for the mode becomes lower than 
that for the surface wave mode. These breaks are indications of strong coupling 
between the modes. Excitation of surface waves gives rise to an additional loss, as 
discussed later in Section 7.4.3.

The basis functions for these slots/strips can be used for the various CPW/CPS 
geometries discussed in Section 7.2.1. For the asymmetric geometries x0 should be 
modified to the corresponding midpoints of the slots/strips.
Study of the numerical data for ere and Z0 as a function of frequency and aspect 
ratio a/b for various types of coplanar lines brings out a number of interesting facts 
about dispersion. These are summarized in Section 7.3.2.
7.3	
Design Considerations
Analytical techniques for calculating the effective dielectric constant and charac-
teristic impedance of coplanar lines were described in the last section. The effect 
of substrate thickness, finite width of the ground planes, conductor backing, cover 
height, and asymmetry were taken into account. Although the quasi-static values 
are good enough for some of the structures in the near millimeter region, fullwave 
analysis should be carried out for frequencies above 40 GHz. Similarly, the losses 
can be determined using the fullwave approach. But the computations are very time 
consuming and costly. An alternative to this approach is to use design equations 
that include the effect of dispersion in quasi-static values. The effect of metalliza-
tion thickness on the characteristics of coplanar lines becomes important when the 
substrate er is large and the aspect ratio a/b is small. Some of the coplanar line con-
figurations become leaky due to the presence of parasitic modes. Coupling of pow-
er from the transmission line mode to the surface wave modes of the substrate may 
give rise to an increase in losses and unwanted coupling. The effect of dimensional 
tolerances becomes important when the fabrication limit for very narrow strips and 
slots is approached. All these aspects that influence the design of coplanar lines are 
discussed next. Finally, coplanar lines are compared with microstrip lines.

7.3.1  Design Equations
Closed-form expressions for the characteristic impedance and effective dielectric 
constant for various types of coplanar lines were obtained in the last section. They 
are simple enough to be calculated using scientific calculators. However, a design 
engineer requires the value of aspect ratio a/b for a desired value of Z0 and sub-
strate parameters er and h. This type of expression is called the synthesis equation 
and is not available at present. For synthesis, search algorithms along with the 
analysis equations may be used. For the initial guess in the search algorithm one 
can use the value of a/b (for a given Z0) applicable for the infinitely thick substrate. 
The synthesis expression for this geometry can be obtained very easily by inverting 
(7.11) as follows.
For 0 ≤ k1 ≤ 0.707, that is, K′(k1)/K(k1) ≥ 1 or Z0cp (εr + 1) ⁄2 ≥ 30p

The synthesized value of a/b for the CPS can be obtained from (7.105) and the 
following relationship between Z0cp and Z0cs for an infinitely thick substrate (see 
(7.11) and (7.81)).

(7.106)
To understand the use of (7.106) let us design a coplanar strip line for a given value 
of Z0. The corresponding Z0cp for the CPW obtained from (7.106) is
	
Z0cp =
2
εr + 1
(60π)2
Z0
	
Now determine the value of a/b from (7.105) corresponding to the value of Z0cp 
calculated above. The calculated value of a/b will yield the desired Z0cs. Alterna-
tively, one can invert (7.81) and obtain expressions similar to (7.105).
7.3.2  Dispersion
The synthesis procedure described above is based on quasi-static values for ere and
Z0. The resulting design is strictly applicable at the lower end of microwave band 

382
Coplanar Lines: Coplanar Waveguide and Coplanar Strips 
but can be used up to the lower end of the millimeter-wave band, that is, when  
h/λ0  1. However, at millimeter-wave frequencies or for frequency-selective com-
ponents, even at lower frequencies the effect of dispersion on Z0 and especially on 
ere should be included in the design. For this purpose, a simple expression, similar 
to (2.131) for the microstrip line, is available. This expression, obtained by curve 
fitting the results of numerical simulation, is [48]
	
εre(f) =
εre(0) +
εr -
εre(0)
1 + G(f⁄fTE)−1.8
	
(7.107)
where
	
G = ewn(2a/(b−a))+v
u = 0.54 −0.64p + 0.015p2
v = 0.43 −0.86p + 0.54p2
p = n(2a/h)
In (7.107), ere(0) is the quasi-static value of ere and ƒTE is the cutoff frequency for 
the TE0 surface wave mode for the substrate. Its value can be obtained from (5.10) 
and is given by
	
fTE =
c
4h εr- 1 	
(7.108)
The accuracy of (7.107) is claimed to be 5 percent for the following range of pa-
rameters
0.1 < W⁄h < 5
0.1 < S⁄W < 5
1.5 < εr < 50
0 < f⁄fTE < 10
It has been observed that ere(0) in (7.107) should be replaced by (er + 1)/2 so as to 
obtain a better match with experimental data for frequencies above 200 GHz [49]. 
 As with microstrip lines, dispersion in coplanar lines modeled by (7.107)
amounts to an increase in ere from the low-frequency value of ere(0) to the asymp-
tote of er. Coplanar lines on thinner substrates are less dispersive due to the larger 
value of ƒTE. Moreover, conductor-backed CPW and those with finite width ground 
planes are found to be less dispersive than others. An analytical expression for the 
effect of dispersion on Z0 is not available. But, it is understood that the amount of 
dispersion in Z0 is of the same order as for the microstrip line [45]. To a first-order 
approximation one can include the effect of dispersion on Z0 through the disper-
sion in ere, that is,

7.3.3  Effect of Metallization Thickness
The values of Z0 and ere obtained earlier are valid for infinitesimally thin metal-
lic strip conductor and ground planes. But in practice, the metallization has a fi-
nite thickness t that affects the characteristics. The effect of t on the characteristic 
impedance and the effective dielectric constant of a CPW has been analyzed in 
[15, 50–52] based on the quasi-static approximation [50] as well as frequency-
dependent solution [15, 51, 52]. It has been observed that an increase in metal-
lization thickness is accompanied by a corresponding decrease in ere and Z0. 
The decrease in ere is larger for the case of a substrate with higher dielectric con-
stant and lower aspect ratio. On the contrary, the decrease in Z0 with increase 
in t is smaller for the higher dielectric constant substrate [15]. For example, for  
ere = 20 and t/W= 0.1, the decrease in ere is about 11 percent and the decrease in Z0 
is about 7 percent. For er = 2.6 and for the same value of t/W, the decrease in ere is 
about 5 percent and the decrease in Z0 is about 10 percent. The decrease in ere and 
Z0 with increase in t can be explained from the observation that a higher metalliza-
tion thickness gives rise to additional concentration of the electric field between the 
metalized portions of the slots, thus increasing the value of Ca. The increase in Ca 
is expected to be higher for narrow slots.
The effect of metallization thickness on the characteristics of coplanar lines can 
be included empirically by defining effective values of strip width and slot width. 
This is similar to the concept of effective strip width for microstrip line and is dis-
cussed in Section 2.4.5.
Metallization Thickness Effect in CPW Design
For a CPW with non-zero conductor thickness (Figure 7.1(a)), we may write
	
Se
CPW = S + ΔCPW
	
(7.110a)
and therefore
	
We
CPW = W - ΔCPW
	
(7.110b)
where DCPW accounts for the effect of metallization thickness. The expression for 
DCPW may be arrived at by curve-fitting the results of conformal mapping analysis 
of CPW of Figure 7.1(a). For conductors with t ≠ 0 [133]

of S and W:
0.1 ≤ S ≤ 0.9, 0.05 ≤ W ≤ 0.45 and 0.3 < S < 0.8, 0.05 < W < 0.35.
CPS Line Capacitance with Nonzero Conductor Thickness
For the design of coplanar lines, we may divide the coplanar line geometry into the 
upper-half and lower-half regions about the air-dielectric interface. Here, the effect 
of metal thickness on line capacitance has been assigned to the upper-half region 
capacitance to simplify the analysis and design. Let C1 be the line capacitance per 
unit length for the upper-half region, and C2 the line capacitance per unit length for 
the lower-half region.
Capacitance of the upper-half region of coplanar lines: The expression for C1, which 
now includes the capacitance associated with strip conductor also is obtained by 
replacing S and W by the corresponding Se and We, respectively. Specifically, (7.8b) 
for symmetric CPW now becomes

where e0t/S is the parallel plate capacitance per unit length between the side walls of

The accuracy of (7.117) using the above approximations is of the order of 5% for 
0.02 < t/b < 1.5 and t/S < 3.75.
Capacitance of the lower-half region of coplanar lines: The effect of conductor 
thickness on the line capacitance has been accounted for through the change in C1 
alone, and the value of capacitance C2 for the lower-half region therefore remains 
unaffected by conductor thickness. The expression (7.8a) for symmetric CPW and 
(7.79) for symmetric CPS may therefore be used to determine C2.
Effective dielectric constant and Z0 of coplanar lines with nonzero conductor thick-
ness: By definition, the effective dielectric constant of a line in TEM mode is given 
by
	
εre =
C1(t) + C2(εr)
C1(t) + C2(εr = 1) 	
(7.120)
where C1(t) is the line capacitance for the upper-half region with nonzero conduc-
tor thickness, and C2(er) is the capacitance for the lower-half region of coplanar 
line with the given dielectric configuration. The dielectric cover on the line is not 
considered.
The characteristic impedance for the TEM mode line is simply related to the 
effective dielectric constant ere and characteristic impedance in air Z0a as

of ere for CPS with metal thickness t as parameter is plotted in Figure 7.21 for er 
= 2.2. It is observed that ere decreases with increase in thickness t and a/b. This  
can be explained from (7.120) and the fact that C1(t) increases with t, and C2(er = 
1) < C2(er). The corresponding percentage change in Z0
CPS with substrate thickness, 
a/b, and t/b as parameters is plotted in Figure 7.22 for er = 2.2. The impedance of 
the line decreases with increase in conductor thickness t. The low impedance lines 
(lower a/b values) are affected more by conductor thickness. Also, the decrease in 
impedance is almost linearly proportional to t/b.

Losses in Coplanar Lines
7.4.1  Dielectric Loss
Coplanar lines have three types of losses: dielectric, ohmic, and radiation/surface 
wave losses. The expression for the attenuation constant due to dielectric loss in 
CPW is the same as that for a microstrip line. This was discussed in Chapter 2, and 
is reproduced here

7.4.2  Conductor Loss
A number of different techniques have been reported to determine conductor loss in 
coplanar lines. These range from techniques such as Wheeler’s incremental induct-
ance rule, to calculation of power dissipation in line through conformal mapping 
of current density in the conductor thickness [54]. These techniques are limited to 
skin effect frequencies range. For applications to digital signals on coplanar lines, 
the frequency range of conductor loss has been extended to low frequencies by 
proper modeling of current density distribution in the strip conductors [55, 137].
Conductor loss calculation based on incremental inductance rule: Following the 
procedure discussed in Section 2.4.1, one obtains the following expression for the 
attenuation constant due to ohmic losses for a coplanar line:

(7.123)
where Z0
a is the characteristic impedance of coplanar line with air as dielectric and 
Rs is the surface resistivity of the conductors.
In the above approach, the value of the attenuation constant is very much de-
pendent on the accuracy of the derivatives of characteristic impedance. The curve 
fitted expressions for Z0
a such as (7.121) may be accurate enough for the computa-
tion of line impedance but their analytical derivatives may be very approximate for 
the calculation of conductor loss. Yamashita et al. have proposed numerical evalu-
ation of derivatives to obviate this problem [53]. In this approach, the change in

the inductance per unit length of the line due to recession of all the metal surfaces 
by half a skin depth d is evaluated in terms of the change of the line capacitance Ca 
with air as dielectric. If Ca

One advantage of the above approach is that one does not need to obtain analytical 
expressions for the derivatives of Z0

can be employed to determine Ca
d and also to obtain the numerical derivative of Ca 
implied in (7.124). Moreover, the factor Ca - Ca
d in (7.125) cancels the inaccuracies 
Ca in and Ca
d that are inherent in the formulation and numerical computations.
Owyang and Wu [54] have used a direct approach to determine the effect of 
metal thickness on conductor loss. They have evaluated the power dissipated in the 
line through conformal mapping of the current density in the finite metal thickness 
structure. Their expression for conductor loss of a CPW has been corrected by 
Ghione [36] and is given as

It is assumed in deriving the above expression that the strip thickness t > 3d and  
t  a and (b - a). Equation (7.126) is valid for symmetric CPW configurations with 
finite and infinite dielectric thickness and for multilayered structures. These effects 
are manifested in (7.126) through ere. Due to the complementary nature of a CPW 
and CPS, (7.126) is applicable for the conductor loss of symmetric CPS also with 
the appropriate meanings for a, b, and ere.
Series expansions for K(k), needed for the evaluation of (7.126), are available. 
These are given as follows [31].

In many applications such as in processors, printed lines are used as intercon-
nects to carry pulsed signals between two devices. The pulse spectrum includes a 
broad range of frequencies, from very low to very high frequencies. However, the 
attenuation constant expression (7.126) is limited to skin effect frequencies (t > 
3d). Holloway and Kuester have obtained a semi-closed form expression for at-
tenuation that extends to low frequencies as well [137]. The attenuation constant 
is derived from the change in propagation constant of the transmission line with 
and without lossy conductors as 
	
α = Re(γ - γ0)	
(7.129)
where g is the propagation constant with lossy conductors. It is assumed in (7.129) 
that losses are small and do not affect the phase constant significantly. In this analy-
sis, the finite thickness strip conductor is modeled by longitudinal current flow on 
infinitely thin top and bottom surfaces of conductors and the attenuation constant 
is derived as

where I is the central strip current and Z0 is the characteristic impedance of CPW. 
The edge condition for longitudinal current on infinitely thin surfaces introduces 
singularity in the integrals, while the actual current density on real conductors 
is not singular. This argument is used to avoid singularity and the integration is 
stopped a distance ∆ before the edge. To prevent the associated error in integration, 
the distance ∆ (called the stopping distance) is defined such that the thin surface 
model provides correct value of a . The current distribution on the CPW is assumed

This expression reduces to (7.126) in the skin effect limit at which ∆ = t/(4p exp(p)). 
The computed values of a are compared with measurements over a broad fre-
quency range in Figure 7.23 for t = 1.61 mm, a = 35.6 mm, b = 84.6 mm, er = 12.9, 
s = 3.602e7. It is found that the comparison is good for frequencies between 3 and 
20 GHz. However, the computed values are found to be higher for f ≤ 3 GHz. At 
3GHz, the skin depth is approximately equal to the conductor thickness and the 
skin effect approximation for line impedance Z0 ≈ L/C fails. At these and lower 
frequencies, the characteristic impedance of the line should be calculated from Z0 = 
(R + jωL)/ jωC. The increase in the value of Z0 at these frequencies brings down 
the value of a. The impedance corrected expression for a is given by [137]

and Z0 = L/C is the skin effect characteristic impedance of CPW. The above ex-
pression for attenuation constant is found to be valid so long as the assumptions 
for stopping distance ∆ for an isolated strip are satisfied. The isolated strip assump-
tion fails if either the strip is very narrow or the ground plane is very close to the 
strip [137]. 
Figure 7.24 shows the comparison of attenuation constant (7.137) as a func-
tion of strip width for t = 3 µm, b = 150 µm, f = 60 GHz, er = 12.8, s = 5.882e7. 
The numerical results are based on a MoM solution by Kitazawa and Itoh [58]. 
The agreement is seen to be fairly good. So, the conductor loss calculations based 
on conformal mapping method may be used in the millimeter-wave frequency range 
so long as the assumptions stated there are satisfied; that is, t > 3d and t  2a,t  
b2, b2. It is observed from Figure 7.24 that conductor loss is minimum near 2a = 
0.1 mm (Z2 = 50 Ω) and is higher for low-impedance and high-impedance lines. 
This behavior can be explained from the higher conductor loss in narrow strips and 
slots. Since the same line impedance can be achieved using different values of b, loss 
considerations dictate choosing a larger value of b.
Conductor loss calculations for coplanar lines based on conformal mapping 
and surface impedance model for conductors has been reported by Tuncer et al. 
[55]. The model used by them correctly predicts the skin effect and proximity ef-
fect in conductors of transmission lines, and therefore conductor attenuation over 
a broad frequency range. However, their results are not available in closed form.
Conductor Loss in Asymmetric Coplanar Lines

Like the symmetric case, (7.139) is also valid for strip thickness much greater

may be pointed out that due to the complementary nature of an ACPW and ACPS, 
(7.139) holds for the conductor loss of ACPS also with the appropriate meanings 
for a, b1, b2 and ere.

tor loss in symmetric CPW has been checked against the more accurate full-wave 
computations [4, 57, 58]. Surface impedance model of conductors is employed in 
[57]. The perturbation method in spectral-domain is employed in [4,58].

7.4.3  Radiation and Surface Wave Losses
In addition to the dielectric and ohmic losses, coupling of power to surface waves and 
radiation from unwanted (parasitic) modes contribute to the total loss of the coplanar 
lines. The parasitic mode in a coplanar waveguide is the odd mode with antiphase 
voltages in the two slots. This mode can be excited at the discontinuities, and radia-
tion may occur. Radiation from this mode can be minimized by maintaining symme-
try of the circuits and thus avoiding its excitation or by using air bridges at regular 
intervals to short it out [4]. In a conductor-backed coplanar waveguide the paral-
lel plate waveguide mode is another parasitic mode. Surface waves or the substrate 
modes can give rise to radiation [7]. Some of these losses are important at microwave 
frequencies, while others become significant in the mm-wave frequency region only.
To understand the physical process involved in radiation through the parasitic 
modes, let us consider a conductor-backed CPW that has been analyzed exhaus-
tively using different techniques [45, 57, 59–63]. It is found that the leakage in this 
transmission line occurs when the dominant transmission line mode of the CPW 
travels faster than the parasitic parallel plate mode, which is TEM in nature [59]. 
In a conductor-backed CPW, this condition is always satisfied independent of fre-
quency and the dimensions of the structure. Therefore, this type of CPW is said to 
be unconditionally leaky [57]. This phenomenon is identical to that in a conductor-
backed slotline, as discussed in Section 5.5.2. Again, as in a slotline, leakage in a 
CPW can be controlled by introducing an additional layer of dielectric either as a 
superstrate, that is, on top of the CPW metallization or between the metallization 
plane and the substrate. The dielectric constant and the dielectric thickness of this 
layer are chosen in such a manner that the dominant CPW mode becomes slower 
than the parasitic LSM0 mode. Liu and Itoh [62] have analyzed this structure using 
the fullwave approach. The normalized phase and the attenuation constant for the 
structure are shown in Figure 7.25 as a function of the thickness of the additional 
layer. As shown in this figure, b/k0 for the CPW mode is smaller than that of the 
parasitic mode, and the structure is leaky for small thickness h2. The value of b/k0 
increases as layer thickness h2 is increased and reaches the value for the LSM0 mode 
at h2 = 0.027 mm. This thickness is called the critical thickness. As h2 is increased 
beyond this value, the CPW mode becomes slower than the parasitic mode. There 
are corresponding changes in the leakage constant denoted by a/k0. At the start, 
h2 = 0 and the structure is leaky with a/k0 = 0.003. As h2 increases, a/k0 decreases 
quickly and goes down abruptly to zero at the critical thickness. Similar behavior 
for a/k0 and b/k0 is observed when the additional layer is used as a superstrate [59].
There are two modes of propagation in a CPW with infinitely thick substrate: 
(1) CPW guided mode with b/k0 = (εr + 1) ⁄2 and (2) the TEM wave of the sub-
strate with bs/k0 = εr. In this case b < bs, therefore the guided mode becomes un-
conditionally leaky and radiates into the substrate with vph = c/ εr. For constructive 
interference, the phase velocities of the guided wave and the radiated wave should 
be the same along the direction of propagation. This is called phase synchronism or 
phase match condition [63] and leads to the following condition on the direction q 
of maximum radiation:

(7.143)

394
Coplanar Lines: Coplanar Waveguide and Coplanar Strips 
Energy transfer from the guided wave into the substrate causes attenuation of the 
guided wave.
Effect of Finite Thickness Substrate
Coplanar lines with finite thickness substrate can also be leaky. Although the mech-
anism of radiation is similar to the infinite thickness case, the substrate modes are 
different. It is the surface wave modes of the substrate/slab that are responsible 
for leakage. Surface waves of the structure are the guided modes of a conductor-
backed slab of thickness h. These modes are the same as the odd TE modes and 
even TM modes of a dielectric slab with thickness 2h and no metallization. Disper-
sion curves for TM modes are plotted in Figures 7.19 and 7.20 along with other 
modes of CPW and CPS, respectively. These modes are encountered in a microstrip 
line also. Excitation of substrate modes depends on the polarizations and sym-
metries of the transmission line mode and the substrate mode. For example, it has 
been proved analytically that a CPS with narrow strips can lose energy to TM-type 
substrate modes only because the transverse current on the strips is very weak to 
excite the TE-type modes [7]. When wider strips are used in the analysis, both TE-
and TM-type modes can be excited. Coupling to the substrate modes is expected 
to be stronger when the substrate thickness is comparable to the wavelength in 
dielectric λd.
The amount of loss due to leakage from coplanar lines on infinitely thick sub-
strates has been calculated using reciprocity [64, 65] as well as the fullwave ap-
proach [7, 63, 66, 67]. The reciprocity approach leads to simple expressions for

and without backside metallization, has been studied [63, 66]. Sharp peaks in at-
tenuation are found to occur at the onset of leakage.
Leakage of power not only gives rise to increased attenuation but can also 
result in cross talk with neighboring portions of the circuit. Power leakage can be 
avoided if a thin substrate is used so that the cutoff frequency of the surface modes 
is pushed above the operating frequency. For this, the substrate thickness h should 
be chosen such that h εr < 0.12 λ0 [63].

Effect of Tolerances
The sensitivity analysis described earlier for microstrip line and slotline can also be 
applied to coplanar lines to evaluate the effect of tolerances. The maximum change

The effect of strip thickness (t/W ≤ 0.005) on CPW characteristics is very small 
and therefore has not been included here. Sensitivity expressions for the symmetric 
coplanar lines with finite dielectric thickness h are given next. Sensitivities for other 
geometries may be derived in a similar manner.

The sensitivities of characteristic impedance and effective dielectric constant of a 
coplanar waveguide with respect to various parameters are plotted in Figures 7.27 
and 7.28. It may be noted from Figure 7.27 that sensitivities of Z0cp, with respect to 
W and h increase when h/b is decreased. A similar observation can be made for sen-
sitivities of ere with respect to h, S, and W. Thus the effect of fabrication tolerances 
is small when thick substrates are used. When h/b = 0.5, ere is very much sensitive to 
variations in h. For h/b ≥ 3, the sensitivities of ere and therefore of Z0cp, with respect 
to er are independent of the h/b ratio and also the aspect ratio. The values of these 
two sensitivities are 0.927 and –0.463, respectively, for er = 13.

Comparison with Microstrip Line and Slotline
Four types of planar transmission lines suitable for microwave integrated circuits 
have been discussed so far: (1) microstrip line, (2) slotline, (3) coplanar wave-
guide, and (4) coplanar strips. In this section we compare the characteristics of 
these lines. Various features considered include the range of impedance achievable, 
losses, and effect of tolerances. The microstrip line has been compared with a co-
planar waveguide in [4, 26].
Range of Impedance
The range of characteristic impedance that can be practically realized with any 
particular transmission line is limited by two factors. Technological processes such

Coplanar Lines: Coplanar Waveguide and Coplanar Strips 
as photo etching limit the minimum strip width and the spacing between two ad-
jacent scrips. For comparison, this minimum dimension has been taken as 5 µm 
(although smaller dimensions are possible with careful processing). The other limi-
tation comes from the possibility of excitation of higher order modes. To avoid the 
excitation of higher order modes, the substrate thickness and the lateral dimensions 
should be kept below a quarter wavelength. The impedance limits calculated in this 
manner are shown in Table 7.1 for three types of lines. In this table the letter “m’’ 
in parentheses indicates that the limit is caused by higher order modes and the letter 
“d’’ indicates that the limit is due to small dimensions. This comparison indicates 
that microstrip lines are capable of providing low impedance whereas slotlines and 
coplanar waveguides may be used for very high impedances.
Losses
Losses or attenuation constant is another important characteristic for the compari-
son of these lines. Conductor loss in planar lines has been computed and compared 
by Heinrich in [69, 70]. The value of conductor loss for the microstrip, slotline, 
and CPW is compared in Figures 7.29 and 7.30 as a function of characteristic 
impedance. A comparison of the conductor loss in a microstrip line and a CPW 
(see Figure 9.29) shows that for lower impedance lines the microstrip has lower 
loss whereas for high impedances a CPW can be designed to have lower loss. For 
medium impedance lines, the conductor loss in a microstrip and a CPW are sub-
stantially similar. The conductor loss for a slotline and a CPW is plotted in Figure 
7.30 This comparison shows that high-impedance lines are less lossy if realized in 
slotline configuration and that a CPW configuration with wider strips should be 
chosen for low impedance levels. Fabrication constraints are also less stringent if, 
wider slots and strips are used.
Effect of Tolerances
As discussed earlier, impedance variations caused by tolerances are expressed in 
terms of the maximum value of VSWR presented to an ideal line connected at the 
input. The effects of tolerances on the impedance and effective dielectric constant 
for the three types of lines are compared in Table 7.2. For this comparison, the 
fabrication accuracy of strip width and gap width has been assumed to be 1 µm.
The assumed tolerances in h and er are 5 µm and 0.1, respectively. The table shows 
that slotline impedance is less sensitive to variations in parameters as compared to 
other lines.

Other parameters
Several other parameters of the four types of lines are compared qualitatively in 
Table 7.3. It can generally be seen that CPW and CPS combine some advantageous 
features of microstrip lines and slotlines. Perhaps the best feature of the copla-
nar lines is the ease of mounting components in series and shunt configurations, 
whereas microstrip lines are convenient only for series mounting and slotlines can 
accommodate only shunt-mounted components. A coplanar waveguide has the ad-
vantage of easier fabrication, no via holes, and good grounding for active devices. 
It suffers from the disadvantages of larger size, parasitic odd mode, and poor heat 
transfer for active devices [4]. 
7.7	
Transitions
Integration of coplanar lines with other transmission lines requires a suitable tran-
sition. Further, transitions between coplanar lines and slotline transform an un-
balanced (CPW) mode into a balanced (slotline) mode and is especially useful in 
balanced circuits such as balanced mixers and modulators. Transitions from CPW 
to coax, microstrip line, slotline, and CPS, as well as from CPS to slotline, are dis-
cussed in this section.
7.7.1  Coax-to-CPW Transitions [71]
This transition is one of the simplest and most frequently used CPW transitions. 
It is used for testing CPW circuits. Depending upon the sealing requirement, one

of the two transitions shown in Figure 7.31 is used. The transition (a) is useful for 
the nonhermetic case, while transition (b) is made with a hermetic seal connector. 
In both the transitions, the pin of the coax connector rests on the strip part of 
the CPW and the ground planes of the CPW and coax connector make electrical 
contact with each other. The strip width of the CPW is changed slightly at the be-
ginning to optimize the reflection coefficient of the transition. Houdart and Aury 
obtained a VSWR less than 1.35 for frequencies below 18 GHz for two transitions 
connected back-to-back [71].

7.7.2  Microstrip-to-CPS Transitions
The transition from microstrip line to coplanar strips (CPS) transforms unbalanced 
mode of microstrip line to balanced mode of CPS. A standard microstrip-to-CPS 
transition consists of a 50 ohm microstrip line and a 50 ohm CPS line. However, 
the impedances of microstrip line and CPS may vary for a specific application. 
Therefore, the transition design should be applicable to different impedance com-
binations, and substrate parameters. The polarization of field between the strip and 
ground plane of microstrip line is vertical whereas it is horizontal across the strips

Coplanar Lines: Coplanar Waveguide and Coplanar Strips 
in CPS. Therefore, the design of microstrip-to-CPS transition involves rotation of 
fields. A large number of approaches are reported for this transition. We describe 
next a very broadband transition which includes impedance transformation.
The metallization pattern of the transition is shown in Figure 7.32(a)[138]. As 
shown there, the metallization can be divided into three distinct portions; micro-
strip line, transition, and CPS line. The metallization pattern in the transition re-
gion is very important for rotating the polarization and impedance transformation 
from 50-ohm microstrip line to Z0 of CPS line. This is shown separately as Figure 
7.32(b). In the transition region, the microstrip line is converted into coupled mi-
crostrip line by adding another strip parallel to it. Vias are added to this strip at 
periodic intervals. One of the ports of coupled microstrip line is open-circuited. 
The width of the ground plane underneath the coupled microstrip line is reduced 
gradually so that the ground plane width equals the strip width at the last via. The 
CPS line starts after the last via. The coupled microstrip line can support two differ-
ent modes, even mode and odd mode. The odd-mode field configuration is similar 
to that in CPS line. The uneven feeding of coupled line and via in one of the strips 
destroys even symmetry of the geometry and therefore suppresses the even mode. 
The absence of ground plane after the plane CC’ does not permit any vertical com-
ponent of electric field. The electric field at various sections along the transition 
region is shown in Figure 7.33.
Transition Design
The line impedance at any position in the transition can be controlled either by the 
spacings between the strips or by the ground plane width. In this design, the ground 
plane is optimally tapered to enhance broadband impedance matching; a Klopfen-
stein taper provides optimum solution between bandwidth and taper length. The 
characteristic impedance of the line at various positions of the transition may be 
determined by modeling the geometry as conductor backed asymmetric CPS or by 
using EM simulation [138]. This helps in the design of transition for any substrate 
and impedance transformation ratio. A 50 ohm microstrip to 129 ohm CPS transi-
tion was designed as per the above guidelines [138]. The insertion loss of the transi-
tion was found to be less than 1 dB per transition and return loss was more than 10 
dB over 5.39 to 40 GHz. The low frequency end of the transition can be extended 
by increasing the length of the taper [138]. The simulation studies for this transi-
tion show about a 100-GHz bandwidth for 3-dB insertion loss. A microstrip-to-
CPS transition without the via but similar to that in Figure 7.32 has been reported 
[139]. Its insertion loss in X-band is about 1.1 dB.
An ultra wideband (3.1–10.6 GHz) microstrip-to-CPS transition is reported 
[140]. This transition is completely planar and does not involve via. The transition 
region is quarter-wave long coupled microstrip line section with partially removed 
ground plane. Another microstrip-to-CPS transition without via consists of an im-
pedance transformer from microstrip line impedance to CPS line impedance, and a 
quarter-wave coupled microstrip section with open end for field rotation. The 1-dB 
insertion loss band covers 1.4–6.6GHz [141].

7.7.3  Microstrip-to-Cpw Transition [142]
The design concepts of microstrip-to-CPS transition of [138] have been extended to 
microstrip-to-CPW transition. The metallization pattern of this transition is shown 
in Figure 7.34. Since the CPW line has three strips and the geometry is symmetric 
about the central strip, the transition region is now symmetric about the central 
strip. For the design purpose, the characteristic impedance of the line at each of the 
sections BB, CC, and so forth may be determined using simulation software. For 
a 50 ohm microstrip to 100 ohm CPW transition, the 10-dB return loss frequency 
range is found to be 8 to 40 GHz. The lower frequency end can be extended by 
increasing the length of taper [142]. For a 50-ohm to 50-ohm transition, the return 
loss and insertion loss bandwidth is found to be 20 GHz (0–20 GHz).

7.7.4  Cpw-to-CPS Transitions
Although CPW-to-CPS transition can be realized by cascading the CPW-to-micro-
strip and microstrip-to-CPS transitions described earlier, the transition will be long 
and therefore its insertion loss will be more. A simple layout for CPW-to-CPS tran-
sition involves suppressing the unbalanced mode of CPW by connecting the ground 
strips by an air-bridge and terminating one of the slots of CPW in an open circuit 
near the air-bridge [143]. This transition is shown in Figure 7.35(a). The transition 
works well between 1–60 GHz. An improved version of this transition from DC 
to 110 GHz has also been reported [144]. The modification lies in reworking the 
ground strip of CPS. The transition consists in joining the ground strips of CPW 
by an underpass metal line and the center of this line is joined to the ground strip 
of CPS by another line as shown in Figure 7.35(b). This portion utilizes the first 
metal layer. The signal conductor of CPW passes over this line and is connected to 
the signal conductor of CPS. The in-phase addition of ground currents in CPW is 
supposed to improve the performance of this transition to 100 GHz [144].
The microstrip-to-CPW, CPW-to-CPS, and CPS-to-microstrip transitions have 
been combined to realize a broadband balanced frequency doubler. The doubler 
had conversion loss less than 10 dB for output frequencies between 9 to 26 GHz, 
and less than 12 dB for output frequencies between 7 to 38 GHz [142]. The fre-
quency doubler uses 2 GaAs flip-chip Schottky diodes. These transitions have been 
utilized in designing a three-port wideband planar balun. The input and output 
ports are microstrip lines. The balun shows return loss > 13 dB, isolation > 10.8 dB, 
amplitude imbalance <1.1 dB, and phase imbalance < 8 degree between 16.5–40 
GHz [145].
7.7.5  CPS-to-Slotline Transitions
The CPS line in microstrip-to-CPS transition can be tapered to realize the slotline, 
thus achieving a CPS-to-slotline transition [141]. CPS-to-slotline part of this transi-

tion is shown in Figure 7.36. If the slot widths for CPS and slotline are different, 
the same may also be tapered. A bi-planar transition between CPS and slotline has 
been reported by Simons [80]. In this transition, the CPS line is first transformed 
into coupled microstrip lines by using the conductor of slotline as the ground plane 
for coupled microstrip lines. The spacing between the coupled lines is then slowly 
flared so that they get uncoupled and cross the slot underneath at right angle, in 
a way exactly similar to the microstrip-to-slotline transition of Figure 5.29. The 
layout of the transition is shown in Figure 7.37. The maximum insertion loss per 
transition was found to be about 1.5 dB over the 8–11.2 GHz band.
7.7.6  Slotline-to-CPW Transitions
This transition has been studied most comprehensively. Various types of transi-
tions that have been proposed are shown in Figure 7.38. The transition in Figure 
7.38(a) is based on the CPW-slotline T-junction of Figure 7.48 (b) [72,73]. This 
junction works like a power divider. If one of the output ports of the power divider 
is terminated in an open circuit, we obtain the CPW-to-slotline transition of Figure 
7.38(a). In this transition there is complete transfer of current from the CPW to the 
slotline. While current on the strip of the CPW flows into one of the conductors of 
the slotline, the backward current on the ground planes of the CPW flows from the 
other conductor of the slotline through a bonding wire. The open circuit on one 
of the slots of the CPW and the use of a bonding wire (not shown in Figure 7.38), 
help transform the CPW mode to the slotline mode. A variation of this transition

uses a slotline open circuit in the form of a circular slot (see Figure 7.38(b)) [74, 
75]. In Figure 7.38(c) the open circuits of Figure 7.38(a,b,c) have been replaced by 
a quarter-wave shorted stub [76], which provides a tuning capability. To improve 
the bandwidth, the slot in Figure 7.38(d) is terminated in a 90˚ radial slotline stub. 
The transitions in Figure 7.38(c–i) borrow the concept of a quarter-wave cross-
junction of the microstrip slotline transition of Figure 5.28 [68, 73, 76, 77]. To 
increase the bandwidth, uniform impedance stubs have been replaced by nonuni-
form impedance radial stubs. A comparative study of these transitions shows that 
the transition in Figure 7.38(d) is the best in terms of bandwidth and insertion loss 
[76]. The 1-dB insertion loss bandwidth for this transition is found to be more than 
5.2:1. Further, this transition can be designed such that the CPW and slot lines are 
colinear, that is, the right-hand slot of the CPW can run straight instead of bend-
ing at right angles as shown in the figure. This introduces flexibility in the layout. 
The idealized equivalent circuit of the transitions in Figures 7.38(e–i) is shown in 
Figure 7.39; the junction discontinuity effect is neglected here. The equivalent cir-
cuit consists of an open-circuited quarter-wave CPW section in series and a shorted 
quarter-wave slotline section in shunt across the CPW-slotline junction.
For a 50-Ω CPW line the optimum value of Z01 is obtained as [73]

Z02 tan2 πfx /2f0

where fx represents either the lower (fx1) or the upper (fx2) band edge of the transi-
tion with center frequency f0 = (fx1+fx2)/2. A fullwave analysis of the transition in 
Figure 7.38(e) has been reported in [78].
The transition shown in Figure 7.40(a) employs a six-port junction between 
the CPW and the slotline [73, 79]. The equivalent circuit of this transition can be 
expressed in the form of an impedance bridge of Figure 7.40(b). A simple analysis

and all the impedances in (7.166) have been normalized to the characteristic im-
pedance Z4 of the slotline; and it is assumed that Z2 = Z5 and Z3 = Z6. For a perfect 
match, Zin = 1. Equation (7.166) then reduces to the condition

Equation (7.168) implies that if all the stubs are of the same electrical length, then 
a perfect match is maintained at all the frequencies. In reality, the bandwidth is lim-
ited by unequal dispersion between the slotline and the CPW, junction reactances, 
and mode conversion. Stub lengths are kept short (≅ λg/8) to minimize dispersion 
and attenuation effects. Test results of this transition on a 0.33-mm-thick silicon 
substrate with er = 11.9 are available in [73]. The return loss was found to be greater 
than 15 dB from 20 GHz to 35 GHz.
All the slotline-CPW transitions discussed above can be modified to introduce 
biasing of active devices across the slotline as discussed in [65].

Discontinuities in Coplanar Lines
7.8.1  CAD Models for Discontinuities in Coplanar Waveguide Circuits
Some of the common discontinuities that occur in CPW circuits and antennas are 
shown in Figure 7.41. The theoretical modeling of these discontinuities has been 
carried out extensively [81–127]. Both quasi-static as well as full-wave approaches 
have been reported. However, design information suitable for CAD tools is still 
lacking for most of the discontinuities; the main reason appears to be that there are 
a large number of parameters and it is, therefore, difficult to develop expressions 
covering the useful range of parameters. A complete library for CAD-oriented sim-
ulation of CPW lines with discontinuities is available in [113–115]. A comprehen-
sive comparison of CAD models of some of the discontinuities is reported by Dib 
[123]. Some of these CAD models suitable under quasi-static limit are given next.

Open and Short Circuit Discontinuities
The open and short circuits in CPW line are shown in Figure 7.41(a) and (b), re-
spectively. The open circuit is capacitive and the short circuit is inductive as shown. 
A good amount of literature has appeared on the analysis of these continuities 
[81–97, 104–109, 118, 119, 123–125]. The data for the open end discontinuity 
has been compared by Dib [123], and it is suggested that the following expression 
due to Beilenhoff [97] may be employed for wide end-gaps described by g > 0.2b,
	
Δoc = b ⁄ 2 	
(7.169)
where Dloc is the equivalent length extension of the line terminated by an ideal open 
circuit, and is related to the capacitance Coc by the approximate expression  Coc = 
Dloc εre/(cZ0). For narrow gaps g ≤ 0.2b, the following simplified expression for 
capacitance due to Mao et al. [124] may be used:
	
Coc = εreCoc(εr = 1)

The accuracy of the above models is about 10% to 20% [123]. The effect of metal-
lization thickness and frequency on open-end effect is found to be very small. At 
high frequencies, the capacitance is shunted by a resistor representing the power 
radiated.
The short-circuit discontinuity may be modeled as a lumped inductance Lsc or 
an equivalent line length extension Dlsc followed by an ideal short. The two are 
related as ωLsc = Z0 tan (bDlsc). The following expression by Getsinger [125] may 
be used for determining LSC:

where S is the central strip width and W is the slot width of CPW.
The accuracy of the above model is restricted to low impedance lines below 90 
ohm. The comparison of values obtained from (7.172) with that due to numerical 
results of Jansen [81] shows that (7.172) has an accuracy of about 15% [123].
Shunt Inductive Coupling Element
The short circuit of Figure 7.41(b) terminates the line and converts it into one-port. 
A narrow strip across the CPW conductors, however, may be employed as a cou-
pling element with the following CPW section. The geometry and the equivalent 
circuit of this inductive discontinuity are shown in Figure 7.41(c). The shunt in-

where t = d/∆lsc – 0.45. In the above expression, Lsc and ∆lsc correspond to the 
short-circuit quantities described earlier. The formula (7.174) may be used for val-
ues of d such that LS/Lsc. It is found that for a 50-ohm CPW 0.14 ≤ LS ≤ Lsc ≤ 0.66 
for 0.5 ≤ d/∆lsc ≤ 8 [123].
Air-Bridge Discontinuity
The CPW line is coupled slotline geometry that can support two modes, even and 
odd modes. The even mode of propagation, in which the ground planes surround-
ing the strip conductor is at the same potential, is the preferred mode for circuit 
realization. However, the odd mode or slot line mode in which all the conductors 
are at different potentials, may also get excited due to either asymmetry of the line 
geometry or at discontinuities. This mode can be suppressed if the ground planes 
are forced at the same potential by connecting a metal ribbon, called an air-bridge, 
across the center strip. CPW line with air-bridge is shown in Figure 7.41(d). The 
ribbon creates a capacitive discontinuity due to the electric field between the central 
strip and ribbon crossover, and can be roughly modeled as a parallel capacitor C// 
to ground. However, the actual air-bridge capacitance Cab is more than C// because 
of the fringing field between the strip and ribbon. The detailed study by Weller et 
al. [126] shows that for air-bridge height of 3 µm, 80 µm ≤ 2b ≤ 260 µm, 0.15 ≤ k 
≤ 0.7, and 20 µm ≤ Wab ≤ 40 µm the ratio 1.5 ≤ Cab/C// ≤ 4.2. Also, Cab/C// is lower 
for a wide ribbon over a wide strip and vice versa.
Some more discontinuities and their lumped equivalent circuits are discussed 
in Section 7.9.
Discontinuity Compensation in CPW Circuits
The discontinuity reactance, although small compared to the line reactance, should 
be included in the design of circuits or antennas; otherwise it may lead to com-
promise in the performance. An alternative is to compensate for the discontinuity 
reactance. We illustrate some techniques to compensate for discontinuity reactance.
Air-Bridge Capacitance Compensation
The air-bridge discontinuity is one of the very common discontinuities in CPW 
circuit realization. As discussed earlier, it can be modeled as shunt capacitance to 
ground at the mid-point of the cross-over. A simple approach to reduce the air-
bridge capacitance is to increase the bridge height or reduce the strip width (result-
ing in high impedance CPW section) underneath the air-bridge. This compensation 
is found to be inadequate [126]. However, use of high impedance section beyond 

Microstrip Lines and Slotlines
415
the immediate vicinity of air-bridge may provide sufficient compensation. The com-
pensated air-bridge is shown in Figure 7.42(a). A simple analysis shows that the 
length Lhigh of the high impedance section is given by [126]
	
Lhigh = ZhZ0
2Cab
Zh
2 - Z0
2
c
εre 	
(7.175)
where Z0 is the impedance of CPW line outside air-bridge, and ere is the effective 
dielectric constant of Zh section. It is assumed in deriving the above expression that 
tan(q/2) ≈ q/2 and ZhwCabq/2  1, where q is the electrical length of high imped-
ance section. Iterative approach to fine-tune the values of Zh and Lhigh is required 
because reducing the strip width below the air-bridge reduces Cab itself. As a rule 
of thumb, one may use [126]
	
L = Lhigh - 0.7Wab 	
(7.176)
where line length L is defined in Figure 7.42(a) and Wab is the width of air-bridge.
Right-Angled Bend Discontinuity Compensation
The right-angled bend in CPW introduces discontinuity reactance similar to that 
in microstrip line. The compensation technique for CPW right-angled bend is also 
similar (i.e., the outer corner of the central strip of CPW may be chamfered to re-
duce the excess capacitance [127]). An alternative compensation approach in the 
form of reduced strip width in the bend region has been suggested and evaluated 
[126]. Air-bridges on either side of the bend are included to suppress the possible 
excitation of coupled slot line mode. The metallization pattern of the compensated 
right-angled bend with air-bridges is shown in Figure 7.42(b). The high impedance 
line length L that minimizes the reflection coefficient is given by (7.176). The line 
step compensation described above for right-angled bends has been extended to the 
compensation of T-junction discontinuity in CPW circuits [126].
7.8.2 CAD Models for Discontinuities in Coplanar Strips Circuits
Some of the most common discontinuities in CPS circuits have been investigated by 
Simons et al. [128], and Zhu and Wu [129] to obtain the equivalent circuit models. 
The layout of these discontinuities and the corresponding circuit models are shown 
in Figure 7.43. The CAD models in [129] are extracted from the method of mo-
ment (MoM) analysis and short-open calibration (SOC) to improve the accuracy 
of modeling process. The equivalent circuit models therefore include the effects of 
dispersion, higher-order modes, and radiation loss. Equivalent circuit parameters 
as a function of frequency are available for er = 10.2 substrate [129]. CAD models 
for some of these discontinuities in the quasi-static limit are given next. The radia-
tion effect is therefore not included.

residual potential [130]. The open-end capacitance is plotted as a function of S/2b 
in Figure 7.44. The capacitance decreases with increase in S provided 2b remains 
constant [130]. Here h is the substrate thickness.
Short-Circuit Inductance
The short-circuit inductance of CPS has been determined by Chiu [130] employing 
the complementary nature of CPW and CPS lines. The short-circuit discontinuity 
inductance in CPS is determined from the open-end discontinuity capacitance of 
CPW and using the relationship 4e0Lsc
CPS = m0Coc
CPW (er = 1). The equivalent induct-
ance terminating the line is computed as a function of g, the width of shunt strip. 
The short-circuit inductance Lsc is plotted in Figure 7.45; it saturates for large val-
ues of g as expected. The inductance is more for narrow strips because of increased 
current density.

ries and shunt inductances is plotted as a function of g/2b in Figure 7.46. The series 
inductance increases and shunt inductance decreases with increase in the value of 
g/2b, and is consistent with short-circuit inductance results in asymptotic limit.
The paper by Chiu [130] analyzes some more discontinuities in CPS lines.

much popularity. Circuit applications of CPW can be grouped as follows:

7.9.1  Circuits with Series and Shunt Reactances in CPW
The first group of CPW circuits uses the flexibility of the coplanar waveguide con-
figuration to accommodate both the series- and the shunt-connected components. 
Various circuit elements that may be realized in a CPW configuration [116] are 
shown in Figures 7.47, 7.48, and 7.49. While calculating line lengths it should be 
remembered that the propagation velocities are not equal for the different imped-
ance sections.

Figure 7.47 represents the realization of series-connected inductances and ca-
pacitances. Circuit representations in Figure 7.47(b) use another coplanar wave-
guide configuration inside the central strip of the main CPW. The basic idea is bor-
rowed from similar coaxial line circuits [117]. The series inductance is obtained by 
a CPW section (smaller than λcp/4) shorted at the far end, whereas the series capaci-
tance is realized by a CPW section (again smaller than λcp/4) open at the far end.
Use of slotline sections, as shown in Figure 7.47(c), is another way of obtaining 
series-connected elements. Short-circuited slotlines are used for inductances and 
open-circuited slotlines for capacitances.
Figure 7.48 represents a realization of shunt-connected reactances obtained by 
adding coplanar waveguide stubs to the main CPW. Open-circuited stubs are used 
for capacitance and short-circuited stubs for inductance. The conducting straps are 
bonded at the junction of the main line and the stubs to ensure that the two ground 
planes of the CPW stubs are at the same potential. A shunt-mounted series-resonant 
circuit can be realized by using stubs comprising two CPWs of different impedanc-
es. An open-circuit high-impedance section provides the capacitance, whereas the 
low-impedance section provides inductance. The shunt-mounted series-resonant 
circuit is useful for designing stop-band filters.
It is also possible to realize pi or tee shaped reactance networks by using CPW 
stubs. Figure 7.49(b) shows a short CPW stub without any strap to equalize the 
potentials of the two ground planes of the stub. Thus the stub can support two 
types of modes: normal CPW mode and the odd mode of coupled slotlines. The 
latter mode presents an inductance L that appears in series with the main line. 
When the straps are added, the odd mode of coupled slotlines cannot exist (that 
is, the inductance L gets shorted) and the equivalent circuit reduces to that shown 
in Figure 7.48(a). An external capacitance C can be connected in parallel to the 
series inductance L by bonding chip capacitors across the stubs as shown in Figure

tions of CPS lines. 2b = 1.59 mm. (from  [130], © 2002 IEE. Reprinted with permission.)

ing shunt capacitances can be realized by using an open circuited stub without the 
shorting strap. One can use chip capacitors to provide a capacitance in parallel to 
L in this case also.
Schematic diagrams of the Schottky diode detector and the CPW equivalent are 
shown in Figure 7.50. The circuit uses series and shunt reactances realized by using 
CPW sections as discussed above. This detector circuit has a VSWR less than 2.0 
and a tangential sensitivity less than –52 dBm in the 2-GHz to 4.5-GHz band [116].
7.9.2  Circuits Using Slotline-CPW Junctions
CPW-slotline T-junctions are used frequently in MMICs. There are various types 
of T-junctions [72], and four of these are illustrated in Figure 7.51. Bonding wires 
are used to allow the current flow and to equalize the potential of conductors. 
Idealized equivalent circuits of these T-junctions are shown in Figure 7.52. A bet-
ter equivalent circuit for the T-junction of Figure 7.51(b) is available in [131]. The 
circuit includes a series reactance X, representing the junction reactance, in the 
input line. A closed-form expression for X is obtained by modeling the signal strip 
(at the junction of slots) as a delta-function current source. Applications of these 
T-junctions in realizing a magic-T is described next.

CPWs; and (c) realization using CPW and slotline.

Magic-T [76]
The magic-T can be realized in a CPW-slotline configuration. It makes use of the 
properties of a slotline (parallel) T-junction and a CPW-slotline (series) T-junction 
along with the concept of a rat-race hybrid ring. A configuration of the magic-T 
is illustrated in Figure 7.53. It consists of a slot ring of radius r such that the cir-
cumference of the ring is equal to one guide wavelength of slotline. This circum-
ference is divided equally into four quarter-wave sections. Each of these sections 
constitutes the output arms of the T-junction associated with them as shown in the 
figure. Ports 1, 2, and H are the CPW feed ports, and port E is the slotline feed port. 
The slotline T-junction has the property that outputs have 180° phase difference 
between them (see Figure 7.51(d)). As a consequence of this the separation between 
port E and port 2 can be reduced to ls/4 from the value of 3ls/4 in a conventional 
hybrid ring. Other design aspects of magic-T remain the same, namely, Zalot = 2

Circuits Using Both Balanced and Unbalanced Signals
A CPW can propagate a signal in two modes: (1) an unbalanced signal in the even 
mode of coupled slotlines and (2) a balanced signal in the odd mode of coupled 
slotlines. The impedances for these modes (balanced and unbalanced) are different.
The slotline-to-CPW junction shown in Figure 7.54(a) excites a balanced sig-
nal in CPW. On the other hand, when a CPW is fed from a coaxial line as in Fig-
ure 7.54(b) or through a microstrip as in Figure 7.54(c), an unbalanced signal is 
launched on the CPW. Therefore, a microstrip-CPW-slotline (or a coax-CPW-slot-

Coupled Microstrip Lines
8.1	
Introduction
A “coupled line” configuration consists of two transmission lines placed parallel to 
each other and in close proximity as shown in Figure 8.1. In such a configuration 
there is a continuous coupling between the electromagnetic fields of the two lines. 
Coupled lines are utilized extensively as basic elements for directional couplers, 
filters, and a variety of other useful circuits.
Because of the coupling of electromagnetic fields, a pair of coupled lines can 
support two different modes of propagation. These modes have different charac-
teristic impedances. The velocity of propagation of these two modes is equal when 
the lines are imbedded in a homogeneous dielectric medium (as, for example, in a 
triplate stripline structure). This is a desirable property for the design of circuits 
such as directional couplers and filters. However, for transmission lines such as 
coupled microstrip lines, the dielectric medium is not homogeneous. A part of the 
field extends into the air above the substrate. This fraction is different for the two 
modes of coupled lines. Consequently, the effective dielectric constants (and the 
phase velocities) are not equal for the two modes. This nonsynchronous feature 
deteriorates the performance of circuits using these types of coupled lines.
When the two conductors of a coupled line pair are identical we have a sym-
metrical configuration. This symmetry is very useful for simplifying the analysis 
and design of such coupled lines. If the two lines do not have the same impedance, 
the configuration is called asymmetric.
For the lines operating in the TEM mode or when the analysis can be based 
on quasi-static approximation, the properties of coupled lines can be determined 
from the self- and mutual inductances and capacitances for the lines. In the case of 
lines operating in the non-TEM mode (for example, coupled slotlines), a fullwave 
analysis is needed for the two modes of propagation.
In this chapter, coupled microstrip lines are discussed. The configuration for 
these lines is shown in Figure 8.1. Some of the important techniques for analyzing 
coupled lines are outlined. Coupled mode formulation and the even- and odd-
mode method are described. Both quasi-static and fullwave analyses are used to 
evaluate the characteristics of symmetric and asymmetric coupled microstrip lines. 
The effects of nonzero strip thickness, dispersion, enclosure, fabrication toleranc-
es, dielectric overlay, and dielectric anisotropy on the characteristics are presented 
Methods of measuring the characteristics of coupled microstrip lines are included.

General Analysis of Coupled Lines
8.2.1  Methods of Analysis
Several analytical techniques are available for determining the propagation char-
acteristics of the coupled lines shown in Figure 8.1(a). The four different methods 

Microstrip Lines and Slotlines
435
that are generally employed are the even- and odd-mode method [1], the coupled 
mode formulation [2, 3], the graph transformation technique [4], and the congru-
ent transformation technique [5, 6].
The even- and odd-mode method is the most convenient way of describing the 
behavior of symmetrical coupled lines. In this method wave propagation along a 
coupled pair of lines is expressed in terms of two modes corresponding to an even 
or an odd symmetry about a plane that can, therefore, be replaced by a magnetic 
or electric wall for the purpose of analysis.
In the coupled mode approach, the wave propagation is expressed in terms of 
the modes of propagation on individual uncoupled lines modified by the coupling 
because of mutual capacitances and inductances. This approach, therefore, pro-
vides an insight into the mechanism of coupling. The method is quite general and 
is applicable to asymmetric coupled lines also. This approach finds applications in 
all types of coupled systems used in various disciplines.
The other two approaches employ the representation of coupled line systems 
in terms of equivalent networks. The “graph transformation technique” involves 
the use of a graph equivalent to the general coupled transmission line network for 
analysis [4]. The use of Richards’s transformation [7] allows the coupled line struc-
tures to be treated in exactly the same manner as lumped networks.
The equivalent circuit for the coupled lines can also be established using the 
congruent transformation technique [8]. This is believed to be a powerful method 
for establishing coupled line properties when there is a large number of lines cou-
pled together. Using this technique, n-conductor coupled transmission lines can 
be reduced to a set of n decoupled transmission lines connected to two congruent 
transformers.
Graph transformation and congruent transformation methods are very useful 
when one deals with a number of lines (more than two) coupled together. Of the 
remaining two approaches, the coupled mode technique is more powerful as it can 
be applied to asymmetric coupled structures also. This approach is discussed in 
Section 8.2.2 and the even- and odd-mode method is discussed in Section 8.2.3.
8.2.2  Coupled Mode Approach [9–11]
In this approach coupled lines are characterized by the characteristic impedances 
(or admittances) and phase velocities for the two modes. These two modes are 
obtained by considering the effect of the self- and the mutual inductances and ca-
pacitances on the modes in the individual uncoupled lines.
For coupled mode analysis, the voltage on one line is written in terms of the 
currents on both lines and the self- and mutual impedances. Similarly the current 
is written in terms of voltages and admittances. Eliminating currents or voltages 
yields the coupled equations. The solution of these coupled equations determines 
the propagation constants for the two modes.
The coupled mode analysis for coupled lines with unequal impedances, shown
in Figure 8.2, is described next.

Coupled Microstrip Lines
Analysis
The behavior of two lossless coupled transmission lines is described in general by 
the following set of differential equations:
	
- dv1
dz = Z1i1 + Zmi2 	
(8.1)
	
- dv2
dz = Zmi1 + Z2i2
	
(8.2)
	
- di1
dz = Y1v1 + Ymv2
	
(8.3)
	
- di2
dz = Ymv1 + Y2v2
	
(8.4)
where Zj, Yj (j = 1, 2) are self-impedances and self-admittances per unit length of 
lines 1 and 2 and Zm and Ym are mutual impedance and mutual admittance per 
unit length, respectively. Voltages and currents, which are functions of z, are repre-
sented by vk and ik (k = 1, 2), respectively. A time variation ejωt is assumed.
Eliminating i1 and i2 from (8.1) to (8.4) gives the following set of coupled
equations for the voltages v1 and v2:
	
d2v1
dz2 - a1v1 - b1v2 = 0 	
(8.5)
	
d2v2
dz2 - a2v2 - b2v1 = 0	
(8.6)

a1 = Y1Z1 + YmZm
b1 = Z1Ym + Y2Zm
a2 = Y2Z2 + YmZm
b2 = Z2Ym + Y1Zm 	
(8.7)
The coefficients a1, a2, b1, and b2 are constants.
Assuming a variation of the type v(z) = v0 e–yz for the voltages v1 and v2, the 
coupled equations (8.5) and (8.6) reduce to the eigenvalue equation

The subscripts “c” and “p” refer to the c and p modes for asymmetric coupled 
lines. The propagation constants for these modes, γc and γp, correspond to in-phase 
and anti-phase waves, which reduce to even- and odd-mode waves, respectively, 
for symmetrical lines. The roots with plus and minus signs in (8.9) represent waves 
travelling in the +z- and –z-directions, respectively.
The ratio of voltages v2 and v1 on the two lines for the c and p modes is ob-
tained from (8.5), (8.6), and (8.10) and is given as

It may be observed from (8.12) and (8.13) that Rc is positive real and Rp is negative 
real, thus representing in-phase and anti-phase waves.
In terms of the four waves, with propagation constants ±γc and ±γp, the general 
solution for the voltages on the two lines may be written as
	
v1 = A1e−γcz + A2eγcz + A3e−γπz + A4eγπz

(8.15)
The currents i1 and i2 are obtained by substituting the corresponding voltages v1 
and v2 from (8.14) and (8.15) in (8.1) and (8.2) and may be written as
	
i1 = Yc1 A1e−γc

the two modes. These are given by

(8.19) gives

Yπ2 	
(8.20)
The above analysis has been carried out in terms of the two independent modes 
of propagation termed “c” and “p” modes with propagation constants γc and γp. 
The voltages v1 and v2 on the two lines are related through v2/v1 = Rc and Rp. The 
corresponding ratios for the currents are given by i2/i1 = –1/Rp and –1/Rc, respec-
tively. For symmetric lines, “c” and “p” modes reduce to even and odd modes, 
respectively.
Symmetric Lines
For the case of symmetric lines, a2 = a1 and b2 = b1. Therefore, (8.12) and (8.13) 
give for v2/v1
	
v2 /v1 = Rc = +1 
for c mode even mode
(

v2 /v1 = Rπ = -1 
for π  mode odd mode

Also, (8.16) and (8.17) yield

i2/i1 = -1

Evaluation of Characteristics for c and p Modes
As discussed above, asymmetric coupled lines can be represented in terms of two

Self-capacitances C1 and C2, self-inductances L1 and L2 as well as mutual capaci-
tance Cm and mutual inductance Lm can be determined from quasi-static analysis.
8.2.3  Even- and Odd-Mode Approach
Thus far the analysis of coupled lines has been very general. Now we will restrict 
our attention to the case of symmetric coupled lines, that is, identical lines of equal 
characteristic impedances.
It was pointed out earlier that the c and p modes reduce to the even and odd 
modes, respectively, for symmetric coupled lines. The propagation constants for 
these modes are given by

In terms of line constants, the characteristics of even and odd modes can be ob-
tained from (8.23) to (8.25) by substituting L1 = L2 = Lo and C1 = C2 = Co. The 
expressions are given as
	
βe,o = ω LoCo - LmCm ± LmCo - LoCm

where be,o are the phase constants of lossless coupled lines given by ge,o = jbe,o. The 
lines are characterized by inductance per unit length Lo and capacitance per unit 
length Co. The mutual inductance is Lm and the mutual capacitance is Cm.
Alternatively, the propagation constants may be written in terms of the phase 
constants of the lines and the coefficients of inductive and capacitive couplings kL 
and kC. If we define [12]
	
kL = Lm /Lo 	
(8.31)
	
kC = Cm /Co 	
(8.32)
and
	
βo = ω LoCo 	
(8.33)
we can write (8.28) as

spectively.
For coupled lines propagating TEM modes, coupled mode parameters are nor-
mally expressed in terms of even- and odd-mode capacitances Ca
e, Ca
o for the air 
dielectric (er = 1) structure and those with dielectric substrate Ce(er), Co(er). These 
are related to self- and mutual inductances and capacitances through the equations

Characteristics of Coupled Microstrip Lines
The methods of analysis discussed in the previous section are quite general. They 
may be applied to coupled lines in a homogeneous medium such as coupled strip-
lines or coupled lines in an inhomogeneous medium such as coupled microstrip 
lines. Whereas coupled striplines are nondispersive in nature, coupled microstrip 
lines exhibit dispersive characteristics at higher frequencies. Quite often, coupled 
microstrip lines are used at frequencies where quasi-static analysis holds good and 
dispersion effects are negligible. Nevertheless, fullwave analysis helps in determin-
ing the frequency range of validity of quasi-static analysis. Both the quasi-static 
analysis as well as fullwave analysis for coupled microstrip lines with equal im-
pedances are described in this section. The geometry of coupled microstrip lines 
is shown in Figure 8.3(a), and the field distributions for even and odd modes are 
given in Figure 8.3(b).
8.3.1  Quasi-Static Analysis
Almost all the methods described in Chapter 1 for the quasi-static analysis of a 
microstrip have also been employed to calculate even- and odd-mode capacitances 
of coupled microstrip lines. The conformal transformation method does not yield 
a simple closed-form solution in this case [13]. Green’s function technique has 
been described by Bryant and Weiss [14,15]. The variational method in the space 
domain has been used by Krage and Haddad [12] and Bergandt and Pregla [16] 
to determine the upper bound on capacitances for the coupled line configuration 
enclosed in a box. The variational method in FTD has been described in [17].
Variational Method in Space Domain [12, 16]
In this method scalar potential functions, which are solutions of Laplace’s equa-
tion, are expanded in a Fourier series. The Fourier coefficients are determined from 
the continuity conditions of potential functions and the stationary property of the 
stored electric energy with respect to Fourier coefficients. Once the potential func-
tions for even and odd modes are known, these can be used to determine the ca-
pacitances for these modes.
For the purpose of analysis, the coupled microstrip configuration can be di-
vided into four separate regions as shown in Figure 8.3(a).
Potentials are assumed to be f = V1 and f = V2 on the left and right strips, re-
spectively. The outer conducting walls are at f = 0 potential. The field configuration 
in each of the four regions is obtained from a solution of Laplace’s equation

The Fourier coefficients Am, Bm, . . . , Fm are determined from the continuity

where V(= |V1| = |V2|) is the potential of a strip. The value of C is twice the even- or 
odd-mode capacitance of a single strip to ground.
Evaluation of Fourier Coefficients
The stored energy Wi can be evaluated in terms of the coefficients Am, Bm, Cm, Dm, 
Em, and Fm. The continuity of potential at y = h and y = h + t helps in eliminating 
Am and Bm. Therefore, Wi can be written in terms of Cm, Dm, Em, and Fm.

Cm, Dm, Em, and Fm gives

Equation (8.55) generates four sets of equations. Each set contains an infinite 
number of simultaneous, linear, inhomogeneous equations. These equations can be 
solved with a computer to determine the Fourier coefficients.
For an exact computation the series in (8.49) to (8.52) should be infinite. How-
ever, in practice only a finite number of terms M are used. Detailed convergence 
considerations indicate that [16] convergence using a finite number of terms is 
faster for larger values of er, large W/H and small S/H. Moreover, convergence is 
faster for even-mode capacitance compared to odd-mode capacitance. It has also 
been observed that M = 23 gives a reasonable compromise between accuracy and 
computation time [16].
Variational Method in the Spectral Domain [17]
This method is similar to the variational method in the spectral domain described 
for a single microstrip in Chapter 1.
In this method the capacitance is calculated from a variational expression in 
terms of charge distribution. Evaluation is carried out in the Fourier transform 
domain, and the capacitance may be written as

Discussion of Results
Figure 8.4 shows the variation of even- and odd-mode impedances with strip width 
W/h and gap spacing S/h for er = 9.6 [18]. It has been assumed that the strip thick-

ness t is zero and the enclosure recedes to infinity. The effect of gap spacing and 
strip width on effective dielectric constants ee
re and eo
re is shown in Figure 8.5. It 
maybe observed from these figures that impedances decrease and effective dielectric 
constants increase with an increase in strip width. For a given value of S/h and W/h, 
the even-mode impedance and effective dielectric constant are higher than odd-
mode values. Even- and odd-mode characteristics show opposite variations with 
an increase in S/h such that, for S/h tending to infinity, the even- and the odd-mode 
characteristics approach each other and are equal to single microstrip values.

For the special case of H = 2h and L = ∞ the characteristics of coupled micro-
strip lines can be obtained in a simple closed-form expression by using the method 
of conformal transformation. In this case coupled microstrip lines behave like cou-
pled striplines with the effective dielectric constant given by (er + 1)/2. The even- 
and odd-mode impedances are obtained [19] as

8.3.2  Fullwave Analysis
It was pointed out in Chapter 2 that quasi-static analysis for microstrip holds for 
wavelengths greater than the transverse dimensions of the line. At higher frequen-
cies, the line shows a dispersive nature and a fullwave analysis is needed. The ana-
lytical technique used for fullwave analysis of single microstrip, slotline, and copla-
nar lines can also be applied to the coupled line configuration. Krage and Haddad 
[20] have used the same field-matching technique for both single microstrip and 
coupled microstrip configurations. The spectral domain technique has been used in 
references [21–36] for the fullwave analysis of coupled microstrip lines. Its applica-
tion by various authors to the same configuration differs only in the choice of basis 
functions for expressing current density (for microstrip lines) and electric field (for 
slotline). The rate of convergence of the resultant series depends upon the choice 
of basis functions.
In this section Galerkin’s method in the spectral domain is employed to analyze 
both symmetric and asymmetric coupled microstrip lines.
Symmetric Coupled Microstrip Lines
The current basis functions for the symmetric coupled microstrips may be obtained 
from a translation of the corresponding basis functions for the single microstrip 
line (see (2.27)). These functions may be either of sinusoidal type [23, 27] or of 
Chebyshev type [28, 29] with proper edge singularity. Sinusoidal type basis func-
tions and their Fourier transforms were described earlier in connection with the 
fullwave analysis of coplanar strips in Section 7.2.3. The Chebyshev polynomials

are found to be efficient especially for tightly coupled lines [30]. The current distri-
bution on the strips in terms of these basis functions is described (see Figure 8.9 for

> bo; where be, biso, and b0 are the phase constants corresponding to even-mode, 
isolated microstrip and odd-mode, respectively. When S → 0 the strips contact on 
inside edges, and phase constant for the even mode approaches the phase constant 
of an isolated strip with twice the width. For large separation between the strips 
(S/W > 4) the phase constants of the even and odd modes converge to the phase 
constant of an isolated strip. This feature of coupling can be used as a guideline in 
the layout of strips to avoid coupling between the neighboring strips. Dispersion 
behavior of b/ko for the coupled modes is plotted in Figure 8.7. As in the case of 
isolated microstrip, the value of b/ko increases with frequency for the modes of a 
coupled microstrip line, ultimately reaching εr for very high frequencies. The dis-
persion behavior of the characteristic impedance is shown in Figure 8.8.
Asymmetric Coupled Microstrip Lines
Galerkin’s method in the spectral domain has also been applied to evaluate the 
characteristics of asymmetric coupled microstrip lines (see Figure 8.9). The total 
strip current is the sum of the current on each strip. Also, the current on the strips 
are not equal to each other because of the absence of symmetry. Therefore, we can 
write [35]

The analysis of asymmetric coupled lines is described in terms of c and p modes

Coupled Microstrip Lines
Figure 8.10 shows the characteristic impedances for the case of asymmetric 
coupled microstrip lines [25]. Note that the two lines have different impedances 
for the c and p modes. The narrow line has a higher impedance than the wider 
line. Moreover, for larger spacing the c- and p-mode impedances for the two lines 
approach their respective single line impedances. The effect of dispersion on the 
effective dielectric constant for the two modes is shown in Figure 8.11. It may be 
observed from this figure that the effective dielectric constants of the c and p modes 
increase with the increase in strip width of line 2. Also, the measured values show 
good agreement with calculated results.
The characteristic impedance of asymmetric coupled microstrip lines may also 
be defined in terms of power and current. This definition in its most general form 
is [28]

In (8.72), Plm is calculated by integrating the z-component of the Poynting vector 
over the cross section of the coupled microstrip line configuration when the current 
distribution on line l corresponds to the solution for currents when b = bm and all 
the other line currents are zero.
Fullwave analysis of coupled microstrip lines has been extended to configura-
tions with more than two strips, symmetric as well as asymmetric [27, 32–35]. The 
basis functions for the analysis can be based on symmetry considerations for the 
symmetric cases [27] and in a general form for the asymmetric cases [28]. The num-
ber of basis functions required increases with the increase in the number of strips, 
asymmetry, and the tightness of coupling.
Fullwave analysis is useful for calculating very accurately the effect of disper-
sion on the even- and odd-mode phase velocities and characteristic impedances.

However, sufficient accuracy compatible with fabrication tolerances and measure-
ment errors can also be achieved in the limited range of parameters by using suit-
able dispersion models. These models have the advantage of saving computational 
time. Dispersion models for coupled microstrip lines are described in the following 
subsection.
8.3.3  Dispersion Models
It has been observed [37] that the LSE-mode model for the dispersion in a single 
microstrip line can be used for coupled microstrip lines also. For its application to 
coupled microstrip lines, Z0m in (1.72) and (1.73) should represent even- and odd-
mode impedances of the total parallel-coupled configuration rather than that of a 
single line of the coupled pair. Relations (1.71) and (1.73) modified for a coupled 
microstrip line are rewritten below
	
εre
e,o(f) =εr - εr- εre
e,o(0)
1 + G(f ⁄fp)2
	
(8.73)
where
	
fp = Z0m
2µ0h 	
(8.74)
	
G ≈0.6 + 0.009Z0m 	
(8.75)
For the even mode, the total mode impedance is half that of a single line of the cou-
pled pair since the two strips are at the same potential and the total current is twice 
that of a single strip. Therefore, the effect of dispersion on ere for the even mode 
can be computed by substituting Z0e/2 for Z0m in (8.74) and (8.75). In the case of 
the odd mode, the two strips are at opposite potentials, and the voltage between 
the strips is twice that of a single strip to ground. Thus Z0m should be replaced by  
2 Z0o for the odd mode. Consequently, (8.74) and (8.75) for constants fp and G 
may be written for the two modes as follows:
	
fp =

(8.77)
The odd mode is less dispersive compared to the even mode. For example, the in-
crease in the effective dielectric constant is about 12 percent for the odd mode and 
about 19 percent for the even mode at a frequency of 30 GHz for 50-Ω coupled 
microstrip lines on 0.64-mm alumina substrate. Dispersion at other frequencies can 
be obtained from Figure 8.12.

Getsinger’s dispersion model [37] gives relatively accurate results for alumina 
substrate for which it has been adjusted. However, it has been found to give inac-
curate values for extreme values of gap width [38]. Kirschning and Jansen have 
reported closed-form expressions that model the dispersion in coupled microstrip 
lines with better accuracy and larger range of parameters [39]. These expressions 
have been obtained by curve-fitting the numerical results of the spectral-domain 
hybrid-mode approach. The range of validity is specified to be [39]
	
0.1 ≤u ≤10
0.1 ≤g ≤10
1 ≤εr ≤18
fn ≤25

for an error of not more than 1.4 percent. In (8.78), u (= W/h) denotes the nor-
malized strip width and g (= S/h) is the normalized gap width. The normalized 
frequency fn is defined in (8.80).
To account for a more complicated form of frequency dependence Kirschning 
and Jansen have modified (8.73). The modified expression is given as

The upper frequency limit for (8.81) and (8.82) is fn = 25, that is, 25 GHz for a 
substrate thickness of 1 mm and higher for thinner substrates.
Dispersion in the characteristic impedance has also been modeled with a maxi-
mum error of less than 2.5 percent over the range of parameters specified in (8.78) 
and fn ≤ 20 [39]. It is observed that the impedances increase with frequency, and 
the rate of increase for the odd mode is very small for frequencies up to 30 GHz for 
microstrip lines on alumina substrate.

Measurements on Coupled Microstrip Lines
Symmetrical coupled microstrip lines are characterized by even- and odd-mode im-
pedances and propagation constants. Knowledge of these characteristics is essential 
for designing directional couplers and edge-coupled resonators. Under ordinary 
conditions, both of the modes are excited and it is difficult to determine the odd- 
and even-mode parameters from the measured data. One way to measure these 
characteristics is to selectively excite one mode and measure its characteristics. The 
selective excitation of modes and measurements becomes easier with the use of a 
microwave network analyzer. Measurement techniques for impedances and phase 
constants are described in the following sections.
8.4.1  Impedance Measurements
The setup for measuring even- and odd-mode impedances is illustrated in Figure 
8.13 [40]. As shown, the signal from the source is divided equally into the two 
transmission lines. The path length of one of these lines is adjustable so that the 
relative phase of the waves propagating in them can be controlled for selectively 
exciting the even or odd mode. The amplitude ratio of the waves is unity. The rela-
tive phase and amplitude can be measured using a harmonic frequency converter 
and a phase-gain indicator (two subunits of the network analyzer system).
The coupled microstrip section is now introduced between the transmission 
test unit and harmonic frequency converter. The mode of excitation can be selected 
by controlling the phase. The phase indicator should read 0° for even-mode excita-
tion and 180° for odd-mode excitation.
The characteristic impedance can be determined from the VSWR measurement.
Figure 8.13  Test setup for measuring even- and odd-mode impedances of coupled lines.

460
Coupled Microstrip Lines
To measure VSWR, a slotted line should be inserted to one arm between the trans-
mission test unit and the coupled lines. A compensating air line length should be 
inserted in the other arm. The measurements should preferably be carried out at a 
frequency where the coupling length is approximately lm/4, because at this wave-
length the effect of the even- or odd-mode impedance on VSWR is at a maximum. 
At the same time, the effect of any discontinuity capacitance is minimum.
Even- and odd-mode impedances can be obtained from the relations
	
Z0e = Z0 VSWRe
Z0o = Z0 / VSWR0 	
(8.83)
since Z0e is greater than Z0 and Z0o is less than Z0. VSWRe and VSWRo are the 
VSWR values for even- and odd-mode excitations, respectively.
8.4.2  Phase Constant Measurements
The phase constants for the two modes can be determined by measuring the reso-
nance frequencies corresponding to these modes. Loading effects on the resonator 
due to the transmission test unit and the harmonic frequency converter can be 
minimized by introducing coupling gaps between them and the coupled lines, as 
shown in Figure 8.14. The coupled pair will act as a lightly loaded single resonator 
and will exhibit two resonant frequencies. The odd-mode resonance frequency will 
be higher than the even-mode resonance frequency. While calculating guide wave-
length from resonance frequency, the effect of gap capacitance should be taken into 
account. The guide wavelength for a half-wave coupled section is given by
	
λ = 2 + 2Δg
(
) 	
(8.84)
where l is the length of resonant line and Dlg is the equivalent line length associated
with the gap capacitance Cg, which is given approximately by
	
Δg = fλmCgZo 	
(8.85)
and f is the resonance frequency for the half-wave resonator.
Even- and odd-mode resonances may also be obtained by proper termina-
tions at the two ends of a coupled line section [41]. If a coupled line section is  
(2n + 1)l/4 long and the two ends are connected in parallel, an even-mode resona-

Microstrip Lines and Slotlines

tor is obtained when one end is open and the other is grounded. This situation is 
shown in Figure 8.15(a).
Voltage distribution on the two lines (for the case n = 0) is shown in Figure 
8.15(b). Since the two lines are connected in parallel at both ends, the voltages on 
these two lines are in phase everywhere. This structure behaves as an even-mode 
resonator for any excitation, and the network analyzer setup is not needed for ex-
citing the even mode. A similar arrangement for an odd-mode resonator is shown 
in Figure 8.15(c). At one end of the coupled section, the two lines are connected 
in parallel and shorted to ground. This end becomes a voltage node. At the other 
end the two lines are loaded by two susceptances of opposite sign, and thus the 
antiphase nature of the voltage waveform on two lines is ensured.
Even- and odd-mode parameters can now be evaluated by measuring resonance
frequency, Q-factor, and input VSWR for two types of resonators [41].
Excitation of these structures is carried out by a gap-coupled microstrip feed-
line placed close to the coupled line configuration.

Design Considerations for Coupled Microstrip Lines
Coupled microstrip structures are characterized by the characteristic impedances 
(or admittances) and phase velocities for the two modes. The analysis of coupled

Coupled Microstrip Lines
microstrip lines for these characteristics can be carried out by using one of the 
methods outlined in Sections 8.2 and 8.3. Although the analysis can be carried out 
to determine the characteristics for a given set of coupled line parameters, it does 
not provide simple design equations for the direct synthesis of coupled line circuits. 
For purposes of synthesis, one prepares either a table or a graph for a number of 
sets of coupled line parameters and uses these tables, for example, to obtain the 
desired information. This procedure is time consuming and may also involve some 
sacrifice in accuracy. However, to avoid these disadvantages, one can write synthe-
sis design equations instead. These equations may be derived from the results of 
analysis. In order to save computation time the analysis results may also be written 
in the form of closed-form equations.
Closed-form approximate expressions can be used to initiate the analysis or 
synthesis procedure. These can also be used as final results whenever the demand 
on specifications of the circuit is not very tight. Closed-form approximate expres-
sions for the capacitances of symmetric coupled microstrip lines are derived in the 
following section.
8.5.1  Design Equations
Design equations for coupled lines should relate mode impedances and effective 
dielectric constants to the coupled line geometry; that is, strip width W, spacing S 
between the strips, dielectric thickness h, and dielectric constant er. One may write 
design equations for these characteristics directly in terms of the parameters of 
coupled lines. Alternatively, static capacitances for the coupled line geometry may 
be used as an intermediate step. It is seen that the latter approach yields simpler de-
sign equations. Therefore, mode characteristics will be described in terms of static 
capacitances. Even- and odd-mode capacitances for the symmetric coupled lines 
are obtained first.
Even-Mode Capacitance [42]
As shown in Figure 8.16(a) the even-mode capacitance Ce can be divided into three 
capacitances; that is,
	
Ce = Cp + Cf +
ʹ′
Cf 	
(8.86)
Cp denotes the parallel plate capacitance between the strip and the ground plane. 
Cf is the fringe capacitance at the outer edge of the strip; it is the fringe capacitance 
of a single microstrip line and can be evaluated from the capacitance of the micro-
strip line and the value of Cp. The term C′f accounts for the modification of fringe 
capacitance Cf of a single line due to the presence of another line. Expressions for 
Cp, Cf, and C′f are given below
	
Cp = ε0εrW⁄h

Odd-Mode Capacitance [43]
The odd-mode capacitance Co can be decomposed into five constituents Cf, Cp, 
C′f, Cgd and Cga as shown in Figure 8.16(b); that is,
	
Co = Cp + Cf +
ʹ′
Cf + Cgd + Cga 	
(8.89)
Expressions for Cp, Cf, and C′f are the same as those given earlier in the case of 
even mode. The capacitance Cgd may be calculated from the corresponding coupled 
stripline geometry with the spacing between the ground planes given by 2h. The 
value of Cgd is obtained from the relation
	
Cga = 0.5 Cos – Ces
(
) 	
(8.90)
where Cos and Ces are the odd- and even-mode capacitances of the corresponding 
coupled striplines.
The capacitance Cga describes the gap capacitance in air. Its value can be ob-
tained from the capacitance of the corresponding coplanar strips with air as dielec-
tric and the fringe capacitances. Bedair has suggested the following expression for 
Cga [43]:
	
Cga = Ccps - (Cf - Cfs) - (Cf - Cfs) 	
(8.91a)
with
	
ʹ′
Cfs +
ʹ′
Cfs = 0.5Cos - Cp - Cgd

where Ccps is the capacitance of CPS in the half space. From (7.64) one obtains
	
Ccps = εo⁄2 K( ʹ′k)
K(k)
k =
S
S + 2W 	
(8.92)
A direct substitution of (8.90) and (8.91) in (8.89) yields the following simple ex-
pression for Co:
	
Co = 0.5Cos + Ccps 	
(8.93)
Equation (8.93) has a very simple interpretation. According to this the lower-half 
portion of the coupled microstrip line is modeled as a coupled stripline and the 
upper-half portion as a CPS. The capacitance Cos is calculated from

parameters

reported in [45, 46]. A scaling procedure is also available [47, 48] for determining 
even- and odd-mode impedances, which requires for its usage the accurate design 
values for any other dielectric. Empirical formulas for the capacitance of multiple-
coupled lines have been reported by Dalby [49].

Coupled Microstrip Lines
The even- and odd-mode characteristic impedances may be calculated from these 
capacitances according to (8.99). The characteristic impedances obtained from 
(8.103) and (8.100) were compared with the values obtained from full-wave elec-
tromagnetic simulators [82]. In spite of its simplicity, the accuracy of (8.103) is 
claimed to be better than that of (8.100). The maximum error in impedance is 
found to be about 5 percent for a narrow spacing of S/h = 0.0001. Relatively, the 
accuracy is better for odd-mode impedance for narrow gap width and higher sub-
strate dielectric constant. The even-mode impedance values are more accurate for 
wider strips.
Asymmetric coupled microstrip lines
Asymmetric coupled microstrip lines have been studied extensively [9, 10, 25, 28, 
36, 50–56] because they provide design flexibility in addition to their impedance 
transformation property. Analysis of asymmetric coupled lines was described in 
Section 8.2.2. Mode characteristics were obtained in terms of primary parameters 
of the lines: self-capacitances C1 and C2, self-inductances L1 and L2, as well as 
mutual capacitance Cm and mutual inductance Lm. Expressions for self- and mu-
tual capacitances have been derived in [52]. The inductances L1, L2, and Lm can 
be obtained from the self- and mutual capacitances, Ca
1, Ca
2, and Ca
m, of the corre-
sponding geometry with air as dielectric. The relationship between the capacitance 
matrix [Ca] and the inductance matrix [L] of the coupled lines is

Capacitances for the asymmetric coupled shielded microstrip lines have been ob-
tained in [53]. Characteristic impedance values for the shielded and open configu-
rations are found to be in agreement with available published data.
The capacitance expressions discussed above are valid for coupled microstrip 
lines with zero strip thickness. In actual practice, the metal strips have finite thick-
ness, and the coupled lines are enclosed in a metallic box for purposes of handling, 
for example. In addition, the effect of fabrication tolerances and the finite amount 
of losses should also be considered while designing a coupled line circuit. These 
effects are considered next.

Effect of Strip Thickness
When the strip conductors are of finite thickness t, Ce can be evaluated using (8.87)
for Cp and modifying Cf, (8.88a) to include the effect of strip thickness. In this case
Cf becomes [42]
	
Cf(t) = 0.5

(8.108)
where ere(t) and Z0m(t) are the characteristics of microstrip with finite thickness t 
and are given by (2.124) to (2.127). The increase in the value of co due to finite 
thickness t is given by Cf(t), (8.108), and another term representing gap capacitance 
evaluated from
	
Cgt = 2εot ⁄S 	
(8.109)
Due to the increase in even- and odd-mode capacitances with finite strip thickness, 
the even- and odd-mode impedances are expected to decrease. The amount of the 
decrease in impedance can be evaluated. It is seen that the percentage of increase in 
Ca
o or Ca
e with thickness is more than that in Co or Ce. Therefore, effective dielectric 
constants ee
re(t) and eo
re(t) should decrease with thickness. The percentage decrease 
in eo
re(t) is found to be more than that in ee
re (t) because of an additional gap capaci-
tance Cg, with air as dielectric. These observations are verified by exact numerical 
results available in [16, 57]. The percentage increase in Co is found to be twice that 
of Ce. The effect of strip thickness on the modal characteristics could be consider-
able for coupled lines with t/S = 0.1 and t/W = 0.1 [58].
Effect of Enclosure
When coupled microstrip lines are enclosed in a metallic box the electric field lines 
in air terminate prematurely at the walls of the box. This will give rise to an in-
crease in the mode capacitances resulting in a decrease in the mode impedances and 
effective dielectric constants. The percentage decrease in odd-mode values (with the 
size of the enclosure) should be less than that for the even mode because a few lines 
for the odd mode terminate on the walls of the enclosure. Figure 8.17(a, b), ob-
tained from exact numerical evaluation, shows this trend [15]. Coupled microstrip 
lines with a top cover have been modeled by Bedair [53, 59].
8.5.2  Losses [60]
The coupled microstrip lines also has two types of losses: ohmic and dielectric. The 
even- and odd-mode attenuation constants due to ohmic losses in coupled micro-
strip lines can be determined using Wheeler’s incremental inductance formula. Its 
application to the coupled line configuration (Figure 8.18) gives for the odd-mode 
attenuation constant (due to strips only)

In the above relations Rs is the sheet resistivity of metallization. It is observed that
the odd-mode attenuation constant is always higher than the even-mode value.
Also, it is more sensitive to changes in the spacing S between the lines than is ace. 
This is borne out by the plot of even- and odd-mode losses in Figure 8.19.

The relations for impedances are useful for studying the effect of line losses on cir-
cuit performance, for example, directivity of a directional coupler.
Like in a microstrip line, slotline, and coplanar lines, leaky modes have also 
been found to exist in coupled microstrip lines. Excitation of these modes gives rise 
to an additional loss. Effects of metal thickness and finite substrate width on leaky 
waves in coupled microstrip lines is discussed in [61].
8.5.3  Effect of Fabrication Tolerances [62]
The sensitivity analysis described earlier for other lines can also be applied to cou-
pled transmission lines to account for the effect of tolerances. Since coupled lines 
are characterized by even- and odd-mode impedances and phase velocities, the ef-
fect of tolerances on coupled lines can be represented in terms of the effect on these 
characteristics.
The maximum change in the value of impedances may be written as

The above relations can be utilized to determine the change in coupled line char-
acteristics like VSWR performance and change in coupling constant. Alternatively, 
for a given set of values of ∆Z0x and ∆ex
re the trade-off between tolerances can be 
determined; that is, tolerance on one parameter may be increased or decreased at 
the cost of tolerances in other parameters.
The effects of tolerances on VSWR performance and coupling constant are 
described below.

Using equations (8.125) and (8.128) the effect of tolerances on the coupled mi-
crostrip characterstics can be estimated. It is shown in Figure 8.20 for the VSWR 
performance and the change in the coupling constant for er = 9.7 [42]. It may be 
observed from this figure that the effect of tolerances increases with the increase in 
the coupling constant. Further analysis shows that the dielectric thickness h and the 
gap width S are the most critical parameters affecting the coupling constant [62]. 
Also, VSWR is mainly controlled by variations in h and er.
8.5.4  Coupled Microstrip Lines with Dielectric Overlays
The analysis of coupled microstrip lines reported in Section 8.3 shows that the ef-
fective dielectric constants for even and odd modes of coupled microstrip lines are 
not equal. The even-mode effective dielectric constant is higher than its odd-mode 
counterpart value. This is because of the relatively higher density of the electric 
field lines in air for the odd mode. On alumina substrate, this difference is nor-
mally less than 12 percent. Although different even- and odd-mode phase velocities 
produce only a small perturbation on the coupler impedance Z = Z0e Z0o and the 

Microstrip Lines and Slotlines
475
midband voltage coupling coefficient C (Equation 8.127) in most practical cases, 
the change in directivity of the coupler is significant. From infinite directivity for 
an ideal coupler, the directivity of a mircostrip 10-dB coupler on alumina substrate 
with vodd/veven = 1.125 decreases to about 12.5 dB. The deterioration in directivity 
is higher for loose coupling [63].
If a dielectric slab having dielectric constant equal to that of the substrate is 
placed over the coupled lines (see Figure 8.21), the odd-mode effective dielectric 
constant will increase more than that of the even mode. The increase in eo
re will 
be higher for thick overlay slabs. With the right amount of overlay thickness the 
effective dielectric constants for the two modes can be made equal. The use of a 
dielectric overlay not only improves the velocity ratio, but it also tightens the mid-
band coupling compared to coupled microstrip lines without dielectric overlays. 
One would also expect a decrease in coupler impedance Z0 because of the increased 
effective dielectric constants for the two modes.

strip lines (er = 9.7 5 0.25, h = 0.63 5 0.025 mm, DW = 50.0025 mm, ∆S 5 0.0025 mm) (from

The change in the amount of coupling and impedance due to the overlay can 
be determined analytically if the equalized value of phase velocity is known. For 
coupled lines without overlay we know that the coupler impedance Z0 is given by

both modes be ec

pedances are given by

ʹ′
C = (1 + C) - (1 - C)g

(8.137)
It shows that the new coupling C′ depends on the ratio of ee
re and eo
re and the cou-
pling of the uncompensated coupler. It does not depend on the final value of ec
re nor 
on Z′0.
Coupled microstrip lines with a dielectric overlay have been analyzed compre-
hensively [64–69]. Characteristic impedance and wavelength ratio λ0/λg have been 
determined as a function of the overlay thickness H, gap S, and frequency. Results 
for S/h = 0.4, W/h = 1, and er =10 as a function of H/h are plotted in Figure 8.22.

It is observed that a crossing of even- and odd-mode wavelength ratios occurs at a 
relatively small overlay thickness. Klein and Chang have reported an improvement 
in isolation from 25 dB to 60 dB in a 10-dB coupler with an overlay [69].
Directivity Improvement Techniques
If the coupled microstrip line with dielectric overlay is backed by a ground plane 
such that H/h = 1, the geometry will look like a coupled strip line geometry and the 
even- and odd-mode phase velocities will be equal.
Improvement in the directivity of a microstrip line directional coupler may 
also be obtained by loading the coupler with a lumped reactance. The loading of 
the coupler in the middle with a suitable lumped capacitance C across the coupled 
lines [see Figure 8.23(a)] has been reported by Dydyk [83]. In-phase and out-of-
phase excitation of the symmetrical coupler shows that the capacitor does not af-
fect the even-mode characteristics. Odd-mode characteristics, however, are affected 
because of the presence of capacitor 2C across the coupled lines (using symmetry). 
The design equations for the compensated coupler are given by [83]

lines with an overlay (er = 10, W/h = 1, S/h = 0.4, 2ph/λ0 = 0.1) (from [68]).

where qo is the actual odd-mode electrical length of the coupler, Z0oi is the ideal 
odd-mode impedance, and Z0oa is the actual odd-mode impedance. Another com-
pensation technique in the form of shunt inductance loading at the middle of the 
coupler (Figure 8.23(b)) has been suggested, especially for loose directional cou-
plers [84]. A maximum directivity of 56 dB has been reported [84].
8.5.5  Effect of Dielectric Anisotropy
It has been assumed in the analysis presented in Section 8.3 and in the design equa-
tions given in this section that the dielectric substrate is isotropic. However, sub-
strates such as sapphire and Epsilam-101 are anisotropic. This anisotropy can be 
used to advantage in the design of coupled microstrip lines as shown by Szentkuti 
[70]. The transformation from anisotropic to the isotropic case can be carried out
in the same manner as has been done for the single microstrip (discussed in Section
2.4.4). The relative difference between the odd- and even-mode phase velocities is 
plotted in Figure 8.24 for four types of substrates. It may be observed from here 
that the difference in phase velocities decreases with the increase in ratio ex
r §ey
r, 
where ex
r and ey
r are the x and y components, respectively, of the anisotropic dielec-
tric constant.

one may employ these lines in Lange coupler or tandem coupler configurations. 
The wire crossovers required for this purpose are not convenient from a manufac-
turing point of view. Broadside coupled microstrip lines, on the other hand, are 
more suitable for tight, as well as loose, couplers. Tanaka et al. introduced broad-
side coupled microstrip line geometry [85]. The cross-section of this geometry is 
shown in Figure 8.25. It consists of two microstrip lines that couple through a slot 
in the common ground plane. This geometry can support two modes, even- and 
odd-modes. The electric field configuration for these modes is shown in Figure 
8.26. The even-mode field distribution is such that the electric field is confined 
between the strip and slot edges, as shown in (Figure 8.26(a)), with no field in the 
parallel slot region. Therefore, the slot may be covered by a magnetic wall (MW) 
for the purpose of approximate analysis [86]. It may be noted that the presence of a 
coupling slot does not affect the odd-mode field distribution (Figure 8.26(b)) and is 
similar to that of the mode in a microstrip line. Therefore, the slot may be closed by 
an electric wall (EW) for analysis purposes, and one may use microstrip line design 
formulas for the odd-mode.
Conformal mapping analysis is most suitable for arrival at the closed-form de-
sign equations. However, the analysis is accurate under a quasi-static limit. We pre-

sent this analysis next. The assumptions for conformal mapping analysis include: 
(1) the common ground plane is infinitely wide; (2) the strips are infinitely thin; and 
(3) a magnetic wall may be placed at the air-dielectric interface of microstrip lines. 
The last assumption is found to be valid for narrow slots and also leads to a fairly 
accurate design for wide slots [86].
Conformal mapping analysis
For simplicity in conformal mapping analysis, we shield the coupled line geometry 
from top and bottom, as shown in Figure 8.27. The design for the unshielded line 
is retrieved for a value of H/h, which increases as substrate dielectric constant 
decreases. The even-mode characteristics are sensitive to this ratio. The line capaci-
tance for even- and odd-modes is determined by applying a number of mappings 
in sequence, so that the given transmission line is transformed into a parallel plate 
line with homogeneous dielectric. Also, only one-half of the geometry needs to be 
considered, due to the symmetry of the line midway through the slot.
The line capacitance for the even-mode may be expressed as
	
Ce = C1e + C2e 	
(8.139)
where the geometries for determining C1e and C2e are shown in Figure 8.28(a). The 
final expressions for these capacitances are obtained as [86]

istics as the slot width S approaches zero.

Full-wave analysis of the slot-coupled microstrip line geometry has been re-
ported based on spectral domain approach [86]. The unknown electric field across 
the slot and the longitudinal current along the strips are expanded in basis func-
tions. The characteristic impedance of the modes is determined according to pow-
er-current definition, unlike the voltage-current definition employed in quasi-static 
analysis. The characteristic impedance values for 1 GHz are compared with values 
obtained from conformal mapping method (CMM) [86]. The maximum difference 
is found to be about 5 percent for the even-mode and about 1 percent for the odd-
mode [86]. Therefore, the design of slot-coupled microstrip lines under quasi-static 
limit may be carried out using CMM.
Applications of this coupled microstrip line configuration in the design of cou-
pled line directional couplers and ultrawide band balun is described in Chapter 
5. Circuit applications of coupled microstrip lines, such as broadband directional 
couplers, coupled line filters, dc blocks, and baluns, are discussed in [87].

Coupled Multiconductor Microstrip Lines
Two strip coupled microstrip lines are used in many circuits. The performance of 
these circuits can be improved by using multistrip/multiconductor microstrip lines.
These lines also find applications in VLSI interconnections and antennas [27, 31–
34, 71–76]. Analysis of these lines is briefly summarized next.
Very large scale integrated (VLSI) chips require millions of closely spaced in-
terconnection lines that integrate the components on a chip. Multilayer intercon-
nections in two or more planes play the most significant role in determining the 
size, power consumption, and clock frequency. In particular, capacitances, induct-
ances, cross talk, and propagation delays associated with the interconnections in 
high-density environments on a chip or wafer have become the major factors in 
the evolution of very high speed integrated circuit technology. Capacitances and 
inductances associated with interconnections on the same plane are discussed next.
For other characteristics such as propagation delays, cross talk, and failure analysis
the reader may refer to [75].
The schematic diagram of a few interconnection lines on the same plane is 
shown in Figure 8.30. For the switching speeds commonly encountered in VLSI cir-
cuits the system or lines shown in Figure 8.30 can be characterized by a capacitance 
matrix [C] and an inductance matrix [L]. The inductance matrix can be obtained 
from the capacitance matrix as in (8.105). The diagonal elements of the capaci-
tance matrix Cii are called self-capacitances and represent the capacitance between 
the strip conductors and the ground. The off-diagonal elements are called coupling 
(interconnection) capacitances or mutual capacitances.
The capacitance for a single microstrip line was determined in Chapter 1 using 
various techniques. Some of these techniques were extended to coupled microstrip 
lines in Section 8.2. The same techniques can also be used to determine the capaci-
tance matrix of multiconductor microstrip lines. The most commonly used meth-
ods are the integral equation method of Section 1.2.3, the variational method in

FTD of Section 1.2.4, the congruent transformation technique [8], and the network 
analog method [77].
Multiconductor transmission lines, including coupled microstrip lines, are dis-
cussed comprehensively in [88].
The various capacitances for three coupled microstrip lines are shown in Figure 
8.31. For the symmetric layout the even- and odd-mode approach can be used to 
reduce the computational effort. The even mode corresponds to the situation when 
all the strips are at the same potential, say +Vo. In the odd-mode case, one of the 
strips is at the potential –Vo, and the rest are at +Vo. The capacitances (per unit 
length) shown in Figure 8.31 are related to the even- and odd-mode capacitances 
(per unit length) defined above by the set of equations [75]

The dependence of the self- and mutual capacitances on the strip width W is shown
in Figure 8.32 for single-level three-strip interconnections on GaAs substrate [75].
T is the strip thickness in this figure. It is observed from Figure 8.32(a) that the 
self-capacitances increase almost linearly with strip width W. The capacitance C22 
for the middle strip is lower than C11 or C33 because of the shielding effect of outer 
strips. The mutual capacitances C12 and C23 between the nearest neighbors is higher 
than between the next-to-nearest neighbor C13 (see Figure 8.32(b)). The inductance 
values can be obtained from the capacitance values and (8.105). Mutual induct-
ances are plotted in Figure 8.33 as a function of strip width W.
Design equations for the even- and odd-mode capacitances and inductances 
(per unit length) for the multiconductor microstrip lines are available in [49]. The

open-end capacitance may be added to these capacitance values to obtain the over-
all capacitance for a given line length L.
For digital circuits the quasi-static analysis is valid only when switching speeds 
are on the order of one nanosecond. When the rise time of the switching pulse re-
duces to tens of picoseconds, a fullwave analysis of the multiconductor microstrip 
lines becomes necessary [27].

Discontinuities in Coupled Microstrip Lines
Sections of coupled microstrip lines are used extensively for the design of direction-
al couplers, filters, and other components. Although characteristics of uniformly 
coupled microstrip lines have been studied extensively, characterization of discon-
tinuities and junctions in coupled lines is not readily available. An open end is 
perhaps the only coupled microstrip line discontinuity described in detail [78]. A 
closed form expression is also available for open-end discontinuity. In this section 
we describe an approach that can be used to analyze discontinuities in coupled 
microstrip lines with a considerable savings in computation time. It is called the 
network model of coupled microstrip lines. This model makes use of the planar 
waveguide model of microstrip line discussed in Chapter 1.
8.8.1  Network Model [79]
A network model for coupled microstrip lines has been developed. The model con-
sists of two parallel plate waveguide sections that are coupled to each other through 
a lumped-element network. The coupled line section and its planar lumped model 
are shown in Figure 8.34. The parallel plate sections, also called planar segments, 
model the electric fields underneath the strips and the fringing fields at the outer 
edges e1. The lumped-element network represents the electromagnetic coupling be-
tween the strips. The coupling due to the electric field across the gap is modeled by

a capacitive network, and the magnetic field coupling is represented by an inductive 
network. Some details of the parallel plate section and the lumped
network are given next.
The parallel plate waveguide model for the microstrip line has been described 
in Chapter 1. In the present context, the parallel plate waveguide accounts for the 
fringing fields only at the outer edges. So their effective widths We(f) are chosen to 
account for outward extension at outer edges only. Keeping this in mind we write

where W is the physical width of the strip and Wem is the width of an equivalent 
parallel plate waveguide for a single microstrip line. The value of Wem can be ob-
tained from (1.84b) and is repeated here:

Lengths of these sections are equal to the physical length of the coupled line sec-
tion. The parallel plate waveguide sections in Figure 8.34 are connected through 
a multiport network. To implement this connection a number of ports are intro-
duced on the inner edge of each of the parallel plate sections. Multiport impedance 
matrices for the waveguide sections are derived from the two-dimensional Green’s 
function for the rectangular geometry [80].
Capacitive Network
The capacitive network represents the electric field coupling between the parallel 
plate waveguide sections. Electric field coupling is very similar to the gap coupling 
between microstrip lines described in Section 3.4.2. A p-network model of the 
resultant capacitive network was discussed there. The capacitive network for a 
coupled line section of length Dl is shown in Figure 8.35(a). Here capacitance Cf 
accounts for the fringe electric field between the inner edge of the strip and the 
ground plane. The value of Cf is obtained by subtracting the parallel plate capaci-
tance from the even-mode capacitance of the coupled microstrip lines. One obtains

When the lumped network of Figure 8.28 has n ports on each side, the complete 
Yc-matrix will be 2n × 2n with four n × n submatrices. Each of these submatrices 
is diagonal in nature.
Inductive Network
The magnetic field between the strips is modeled by the self- and mutual induct-
ances. Let us consider Figure 8.34 in which two adjacent ports of the planar wave-
guide network A (say 1 and 2) face the corresponding ports (n + 1) and (n + 2) of 
the planar waveguide network B. The inductive coupling network between these 
ports may be drawn as shown in Figure 8.35(b). Values of Lp and M are obtained 
from an analysis of the coupled line section with air as dielectric, as described by 
(8.106). The inductance per unit length of the parallel plate section is denoted by 
Lpl and is given by

Multiport admittance matrices of the planar waveguide sections are now combined 
with the admittance matrix of the gap network to obtain the characteristics of the 
coupled line section. The network model described above has been found to cor-
rectly predict the coupling coefficient S21 and the higher order mode cutoff frequen-
cies. It has been used to analyze a coupled microstrip section with chamfered right-
angled bends discontinuity to single microstrip lines (see Figure 8.36). Calculated 
S21 parameter for this circuit is found to agree with measured values. The network 
model can be applied to various types of discontinuities in coupled microstrip lines.
8.8.2  Open-End Discontinuity
Similar to the open end in a microstrip line, the open end in coupled microstrip 
lines is capacitive in nature and can be characterized in the form of an additional 
line length ∆lo,e for each mode. Closed-form expressions for ∆lo,e have been re-
ported [39, 81]. These are given as
Δe = Δoc(u,εr) + Δoc(2u,εr) - Δoc(u,εr) + 0.0198h ⋅gR1

The quantities ∆loc(u, er) and ∆loc(2u, er) represent open-end extension values for 
a single line with widths W and 2W, respectively. The range of applicability of 
(8.155) is again defined by (8.97), and the associated accuracy is about 5 percent. 
It is found that line length extension ∆le decreases asymptotically to ∆loc(u, er) as 
the spacing S/h is increased.

Substrate Integrated  
Waveguide (SIW)
9.1	
Introduction
The development of complex microwave and mm-wave circuits and systems re-
quires integration of passive components, active devices, transmission lines, and 
antennas. In most cases, various components of a system are designed and manu-
factured separately, and different fabrication technologies are required to imple-
ment each component at the best. 
A number of different fabrication technologies are available for the implemen-
tation of microwave and millimeter-wave components. 
Printed planar technologies, such as those based on microstrip line and copla-
nar waveguide, represent the ideal choice for manufacturing a variety of passive 
components, interconnects, and antennas, operating in the microwave frequency 
range. These technologies lead to compact, low-profile, and light-weight compo-
nents, which can be manufactured by adopting inexpensive fabrication processes. 
Nevertheless, printed components often exhibit significant losses, especially at mm-
wave frequency; moreover, they are subject to radiation leakage and undesired cou-
pling between adjacent elements, and exhibit limited power-handling capability. 
Conversely, when losses are an issue and complete shielding is required, metal-
lic waveguide technology appears to be the most suitable solution. Metallic wave-
guides guarantee very low losses and good quality factor, which are mandatory for 
highly-selective filters, and they permit to deal with high power levels. However, 
in contrast to planar technologies, metallic waveguides are heavy and bulky struc-
tures, and their fabrication is expensive and time consuming. 
Furthermore, when multiple fabrication technologies are adopted for manu-
facturing different portions of a system, a final integration phase is required. The 
combination of components manufactured by using different technologies is a 
complicated task that requires the use of properly designed transitions. Transitions 
introduce additional losses and usually lead to narrower operation bandwidth and 
extra packaging costs. 
To overcome these issues and bridge the technological gap between lossy planar 
technologies and bulky metallic waveguides, the substrate integrated waveguide 
(SIW) has been proposed. SIW technology allows for the implementation of classi-
cal rectangular waveguides in planar form: they are based on a dielectric substrate, 
where two ground planes replace the top and bottom sides of the waveguide, and 

498
Substrate Integrated Waveguide (SIW) 
two rows of metalized cylindrical holes or slots electrically connect the two ground 
planes and emulate the metallic side walls of classical waveguides (Figure 9.1). 
The first appearance of the SIW structure can be found in a Japanese patent in 
1994 [1]. Subsequently, a structure similar to the SIW was proposed in [2] under 
the name of parallel-plate waveguide and in [3] as laminated waveguide. However, 
the fundamental development of SIW technology and components can be attrib-
uted to the seminal works of Ke Wu and his group at the École Polytechnique de 
Montréal, Canada, starting from 2001 [4–7]. 
SIW technology combines the advantages of planar technologies and classical 
metallic waveguides: SIW components are light and compact, they can be manu-
factured in planar form by adopting well established and cost-effective processing 
techniques (like printed circuit board or low temperature co-fired ceramic), and 
at the same time they exhibit high quality factor, high power-handling capability, 
and practically complete electromagnetic shielding. The most significant advan-
tage of SIW technology is the possibility to integrate a complete system in a single 
substrate, including passive components, active elements, possibly chip-sets, and 
antennas. Since the complete system is fabricated in the same substrate by using 
the same technology, there is no need for transitions between different components 
and sub-circuits, thus reducing losses and parasitics. Moreover, SIW circuits can be 
easily connected to microstrip lines and coplanar waveguides, realized in the same 
substrate. 
9.1.1  Geometry
The SIW structure is realized in a dielectric substrate, metalized at top and bottom. 
The top and bottom metal layers are electrically connected by two rows of closely-
spaced metalized cylindrical holes (usually named metal vias or posts), which de-
fine the side walls of the waveguide (Figure 9.1). In some cases, the cylindrical holes 
can be replaced by metalized slots. 
Figure 9.1  Substrate integrated waveguide configuration.

Dielectric substrates, usually adopted for the microstrip and coplanar wave-
guide circuits, can be used for SIW structures. The thickness of the dielectric layer 
is typically small compared to the width of the waveguide, and may range from 
0.2 to 1 mm. The relative dielectric constant er is usually in the range from 2 to 10. 
The geometry of the SIW is fully defined by three parameters: the diameter d 
of the holes, the width w of the waveguide, and the longitudinal spacing s between 
the holes (Figure 9.2). As the SIW structure resembles the rectangular waveguide, 
its width w is mainly related to the cutoff frequency of the fundamental SIW mode 
and therefore to the operation frequency band, as discussed below. The diameter 
d of the holes is typically a small fraction of w: a value d < w/8 is recommended to 
avoid possible band-gap effects, due to the periodic modulation of the waveguide 
width [6]. The longitudinal spacing s affects the confinement of the electromagnetic 
field, as it determines the gap-width (s - d) between pairs of metal vias. The mini-
mum value is s = d, which means no gap appears and the shielding is perfect. If the 
value of s increases, the gaps become larger and the field confinement degrades. A 
golden rule is s < 2.5 d [6], and s = 2 d is the typical choice. 
The SIW transmission line is a periodic structure, and for modeling purposes it 
may be useful to identify its unit cell, which comprises a portion of double-ground-
ed dielectric substrate with two metalized holes (Figure 9.2). 
9.1.2  Operation Principle
The wave propagation in SIW structures is similar to the propagation in classi-
cal rectangular waveguides: the fundamental mode of the SIW resembles the TE10 
mode of a rectangular waveguide (Figure 9.3). With this mode configuration, the 
surface current flows along the top and bottom metal planes of the SIW exactly like 
in a rectangular waveguide, and on the sides it can flow vertically along the metal-
ized surface of the cylinders, being minimally perturbed by the gaps (provided that 
the gaps are small). For this reason, the electromagnetic field is confined inside the 
SIW and there is no radiation leakage. 
This operation mechanism only applies to the TEn0 modes of the rectangular 
waveguide, where the surface current on the side walls flows in vertical direction. 
Figure 9.2  Geometry of a substrate integrated waveguide (top view). 

500
Substrate Integrated Waveguide (SIW) 
For the other modes of the rectangular waveguide, namely TM modes and TEnp 
modes with p π 0, the surface current on the side walls has a longitudinal compo-
nent, and consequently it would be strongly perturbed by the gaps. For this reason, 
these modes are not supported by the SIW structure. In conclusion, the only modes 
supported by SIW structures are those similar to the TEn0 modes of the rectangular 
waveguide. 
Due to their geometry and their mode pattern, SIW components can be classi-
fied as H-plane waveguide structures [8]. The electric field is normal to the broad 
wall and its amplitude does not vary in the vertical direction. Moreover, the thick-
ness h of the substrate plays no role in the characteristics of wave propagation, 
except for conductor losses. 
9.2	
Analysis Techniques of Siw
A variety of modeling techniques have been applied or specifically developed for 
the analysis of SIW structures, both in the case of straight interconnects and in the 
case of complex components. In the former case, the aim of the analysis is the cal-
culation of the propagation and attenuation constants of the SIW modes versus fre-
quency, as well as the determination of the modal field pattern of the fundamental 
mode and possibly of the next higher modes. In the latter case, the analysis should 
provide the frequency response of the SIW component, for instance in terms of the 
scattering matrix referred to the ports of the component, and also the radiation 
characteristics in the case of SIW antennas. 
9.2.1  Equivalent Rectangular Waveguide
The easiest (but yet very effective and widely adopted) technique for modeling SIW 
structures exploits the similarity between SIW and rectangular waveguide. As the 
SIW modes exhibit the same dispersion characteristics as the modes of conven-
tional rectangular waveguides [9], the SIW structure can be approximated by an 
equivalent rectangular waveguide with proper width. An analytical relation can 
be determined between the width of the equivalent rectangular waveguide and the 
geometrical dimensions of the SIW. 
The first and most commonly used relation was proposed in [9]. The effective 
width weff of the equivalent rectangular waveguide can be obtained from the em-
pirical equation 
Figure 9.3  Electric field pattern of the fundamental SIW mode (front view).

(9.1)
where dimensions w, d, and s are shown in Figure 9.2. Once the width of the 
equivalent waveguide is available, classical formulas for calculating the dispersion 
characteristics of rectangular waveguides can be used [8].

second SIW modes (solid line: full-wave simulation, dashed line: equivalent waveguide model, 
dots: measurements from [9]); (b) characteristic impedance of the fundamental SIW mode, 
calculated by adopting the formulas of the wave impedance of the equivalent rectangular 
waveguide [8].

Substrate Integrated Waveguide (SIW) 
Moreover, the effective width concept is very useful to define the characteristic 
impedance of SIW. In fact, SIW structures are not uniform along the propagation 
direction, and the electric and magnetic modal fields slightly change at different 
cross-sections. For this reason, a practical way to define the characteristic imped-
ance of the SIW is the wave impedance of the equivalent rectangular waveguide, 
calculated as the ratio of the transverse components of the electric and magnetic 
fields [8]. 
Figure 9.4a shows the propagation constant of the first two modes of an SIW 
structure with dimensions w = 5.25 mm, d = 0.8 mm, s = 1.5 mm, and the dielec-
tric constant of the substrate er = 2.2. From equation (9.1), the effective width is  
weff = 4.80 mm. The results achieved by applying the equivalent waveguide concept

compare well with the full-wave analysis of the SIW and with measurements from 
[9]. In addition, Figure 9.4b shows the characteristic impedance of the fundamental 
mode of the same SIW structure, calculated by using analytical formulas for the 
equivalent rectangular waveguide [8]. 
Equation (9.1) is valid for s < 4d and it has an accuracy within ±5% [9]. This 
precision is acceptable for many applications: it allows for a preliminary dimen-
sioning of SIW interconnects and it simplifies the geometry of SIW components, as 
the rows of metal vias can be replaced by solid walls (Figure 9.5). The use of the 
equivalent waveguide is helpful in full-wave analysis, and it also allows to apply 
to SIW circuits the design concepts of classical waveguide components. In some 
cases the use of (9.1) may be critical, for instance in the case of selective filters and 
narrow-band components, where small inaccuracies in the cutoff frequency may 
lead to a significant shift of the frequency response. 
Other formulas have been proposed to determine the equivalence between SIW 
and rectangular waveguide. A refinement of equation (9.1) was proposed in [6] 
to include the effect of d/w. The following equation was determined by empirical 
criteria: 
	
weff = w - 1.08 d2
s + 0.1d2
w ⋅
	
(9.2)
Equation (9.2) provides a more accurate determination of effective width of the 
equivalent rectangular waveguide, and its range of validity is defined by the condi-
tions s < 3d and d < w/5. 
Another relation was derived in [10] by using a semi-analytical approach. The 
relation between w and the effective width weff is given by 
	
w = 2 weff
π
cot−1
π  s
4 weff
ln s
2 d
⎛
⎝⎜
⎞
⎠⎟ 
	
(9.3)
This equation is different from (9.1) and (9.2) in the derivation technique, because 
it is not obtained in an empirical way, but it is comparable in terms of accuracy. 
Anyway, equation (9.3) presents a substantial difference from the other relations 
concerning the range of values of weff it can provide. In fact, according to equa-
tion (9.1), the effective width weff is always smaller than w. Similarly, according 
to equation (9.2), weff < w in all practical cases, being the condition s < 10.8w al-
ways satisfied. According to equation (9.3), the width of the equivalent rectangular 
waveguide is larger than the width of the SIW when s > 2d, w and weff coincide 
when s = 2d, and weff < w when s < 2d. This result should not surprise, because 
when the longitudinal spacing s is large, the electromagnetic field tends to be less 
confined inside the rows of metalized cylindrical holes, with a consequent increase 
in the effective width weff as well as in radiation losses. 
9.2.2  Full-wave Modeling of SIW Interconnects
A more accurate characterization of SIW interconnects is based on the full-wave 
electromagnetic modeling. The full-wave analysis of straight SIW interconnects 

504
Substrate Integrated Waveguide (SIW) 
aims to determine the curves of propagation and attenuation constants versus fre-
quency, and the field pattern of the SIW modes. 
The modeling of SIW interconnects usually exploits the periodicity of the struc-
ture, which allows considering the unit cell of the periodic structure instead of a 
section of the waveguide (Figure 9.2). The analysis techniques based on the mod-
eling of the unit cell take advantage of the Floquet-Bloch theorem and lead to a 
substantial reduction in the computational cost. 
The analysis techniques adopted for the modeling of SIW interconnects can be di-
vided in three major groups: 
1.	 full-wave methods that lead to the formulation of a classical eigenvalue 
problem [9], [11-14]; 
2.	 integral equation techniques, that formulate the problem in terms of a tran-
scendental equation [2]; 
3.	 analysis approaches based on the surface impedance concept [7], [15]. 
Analysis Methods Leading to an Eigenvalue Problem
An efficient technique for the determination of the dispersion diagram of SIW 
structures is based on the use of an electromagnetic solver, either commercial or 
in-house developed, able to characterize the unit cell as a two-port circuit [9]. Any 
full-wave simulation method can be adopted for this analysis. The ports of the cir-
cuit are defined at the long sides of the unit cell and are represented by rectangular 
Figure  9.6  Topology of the SIW structure adopted in the formulation of the eigenvalue problem:  
(a) geometry of the unit cell; (b) definition of the ABCD matrix.

waveguide ports, which are broader than the SIW width (Figure 9.6a). A number 
N of rectangular waveguide modes are defined at each port: since the SIW is an 
H-plane structure, only TEn0 modes of the rectangular waveguide are considered 
at the ports. 
The electromagnetic solver usually provides the generalized scattering or ad-
mittance matrix of the two-port circuit, which subsequently needs to be converted 
into the ABCD matrix [8]. The ABCD matrix relates the modal voltages and the 
inward modal currents of the rectangular waveguide modes at the ports of the cir-
cuit (Figure 9.6b) in the form

where V1 and V2 are the column vectors of the modal voltages at port 1 and  
port 2, respectively, and similarly I1 and I2 are the column vectors of the inward 
modal currents at port 1 and port 2, respectively. The column vectors V1, V2, I1, 
and I2 have dimension N and the ABCD matrix has dimensions 2N × 2N. 
Once the ABCD matrix of the two-port circuit is available, the Floquet-Bloch 
theorem is applied, and the periodicity of the electromagnetic field at the ports of 
the SIW structure is enforced by the matrix equation

The calculation of the eigensolutions of (9.6) must be repeated frequency-by-fre-
quency, and the eigenvalues of (9.6) yield the dispersion curves of the SIW modes. 
In particular, the i-th eigenvalue provides the complex propagation constant gi of 
the i-th SIW mode, and consequently: 
	
αi = Re{γi} 	
(9.7a)
	
βi = Im{γi} 	
(9.7b)
where ai and bi represent the attenuation constant and the propagation constant of 
the i-th SIW mode, respectively, calculated at the given frequency f. 
The cutoff frequency fc of the dominant SIW mode, defined as the frequency 
where a = b = 0 in the lossless case or simply a = b otherwise, can be used to 
determine the effective width weff of the equivalent rectangular waveguide. This 
approach for calculating the width of the equivalent waveguide is usually more ac-
curate compared to the one based on equations (9.1–9.3). 

506
Substrate Integrated Waveguide (SIW) 
The eigenvectors obtained from (9.6) are the weight coefficients, which permit 
to express the SIW modal fields on the ports as a linear combination of the TEn0 
modes of the rectangular waveguide. More specifically, the i-th eigenvector Λi al-
lows to reconstruct the modal fields of the i-th SIW mode on the port section: 
	
ei
SIW =
Λi,n en
RW

(9.8)
where ei
sIW is the i-th electric modal vector of the SIW, En
RW is the n-th electric modal 
vector of rectangular waveguide, and Li,n is the n-th element of the i-th eigenvector. 
It is important to observe that the SIW structure is not homogeneous along 
the propagation direction, and therefore the modal field pattern is not preserved 
at any cross-section, as it happens, for instance, in a rectangular waveguide. The 
electric modal field calculated by equation (9.8) represents the SIW modal field on 
the port section. A different choice of the unit cell (Figure 9.2) would lead to dif-
ferent modal fields. 
Another simple method for the determination of the mode spectrum of SIW 
structures, belonging to the class of methods leading to an eigenvalue problem, is 
the numerical multimode calibration technique [11], which is inspired by the pro-
cedure adopted for the experimental characterization of multimodal transmission 
lines. This approach can be applied in conjunction with general purpose electro-
magnetic solvers, and it allows to simultaneously determine the complex propaga-
tion constants of several SIW modes. 
In the numerical multimode calibration technique, two SIW structures with 
different lengths are numerically simulated under multimode excitation. The gen-
eralized scattering or admittance matrices provided by the electromagnetic analysis 
of the two structures are subsequently converted into generalized transfer matrices, 
namely T1 and T2, which relate the amplitudes of the incident and reflected waves 
at port 1 to the amplitudes of the incident and reflected waves at port 2. 
Each of the two structures comprises three blocks, namely one SIW section 
and two port transitions. The port transition may connect, for instance, the SIW 
to a rectangular waveguide (Figure 9.7(a)). The three blocks are characterized by 
their respective generalized transfer matrix, and N modes are considered both at 
the rectangular waveguide ports and in the SIW section. Matrices Tx and Ty refer 
to the first and second port transitions, respectively, whereas matrix TSIW refers to 
the SIW section (Figure 9.7(b)). Matrices T1 and T2 can be expressed as follows 
	
T1 = Tx TSIW

 Ty 	
(9.9a)
	
T2 = Tx TSIW
2
 Ty 	
(9.9b)
where the superscripts 1 and 2 denote the first and second structure, respectively. 
The port transitions denoted by matrices Tx and Ty are identical for both struc-
tures. Matrices T1
SIW and T2
SIW are diagonal, as they represent the generalized trans-
fer matrices of straight waveguides, and they can be expressed as

(with i = 1, ..., N), and l1 and l2 are the lengths of the SIW section in the first and

matrix equation is derived

SIW is a diagonal matrix, the eigenvalues of T12 coincide with the elements of

where li represents the i-th eigenvalue of T12 and ∆l = l1 - l2. Equation (9.13) al-
lows to determine the complex propagation constants of N pairs of modes, each 
pair related to two modes propagating in opposite directions. 
By repeating this procedure frequency-by-frequency, the dispersion character-
istics of the SIW structure are obtained. In particular, the attenuation and propa-
gation constants are calculated by applying (9.7) to the values of gi resulting from 
(9.13). 
Other numerical techniques, specifically developed for the modeling of SIW 
structures, allow to obtain the eigenvalue matrix equation directly from the for-
mulation of the electromagnetic problem, and not from the post-processing of a 
matrix describing the response of the circuit. 
The application of finite-difference techniques allows for great flexibility both 
in the geometry of the structure and in the substrate material, which can be lossy 
and anisotropic. The finite-difference frequency-domain (FDFD) method was ap-
plied in [12] to the modeling of the unit cell of an SIW structure to calculate the 
propagation constants and the modal field vectors. In this formulation, the value of 
frequency is set and the propagation constants are determined through the solution 
of the eigenvalue problem. Absorbing Boundary Conditions (ABC) or Perfectly 
Matched Layers (PML) are adopted at the sides of the waveguide, to impose the 
radiation boundary condition that permits to account for radiation leakage. The 
formulation of the FDFD problem results into the generalized eigenvalue problem 
	
Ax = γBx 	
(9.14)
where g is the complex propagation constant and x is the vector of the electric and 
magnetic field components. This method yields directly the propagation constants 
of the SIW modes at a given frequency. 
A different FDFD approach for the calculation of the dispersion curve is pos-
sible, where the propagation constant b is set and the aim of the calculation is the 
determination of the corresponding complex frequency. This approach was pro-
posed in [13], and leads to the following standard eigenvalue problem 
	
Ax = j ʹ′
ω x 	
(9.15)
where w′ is the complex angular frequency and x is the vector of the electric and 
magnetic field components. The eigenvalues of matrix A allow to determine the 
eigenfrequencies fi and the corresponding attenuation constant ai for the given 
value of b 
	
fi = Re{jωiʹ′}

(9.18)
The method of lines (MoL) was also applied to the determination of the propa-
gation characteristics of SIW interconnects through the direct formulation of an 
eigenvalue problem [14]. In the application of MoL, the structure is handled ana-
lytically in one direction and there is a segmentation in the other direction. ABC 
are considered on the lateral sides of the SIW, thus accounting for radiation effects. 
The formulation of the MoL yields a matrix eigenvalue equation in the form (9.14), 
where g is related to the complex propagation constant and x is related to the elec-
tric field components, as detailed in [14]. 
Integral equation techniques
The modeling of SIW interconnects based on the formulation of an integral equa-
tion and its solution by the Method of Moments (MoM) was originally proposed 
in [2]. The MoM modeling is particularly efficient in the case of SIW interconnects, 
due to the simple geometry of the structure, the homogeneous dielectric medium, 
and the vertically independent field configuration. Compared to finite-element and 
finite-difference methods, the integral equation technique leads to a significant im-
provement in computational efficiency. 
As both the structure geometry and the field amplitude are uniform along the 
y-direction (Figure 9.8), the solution of the problem can be formulated in terms of 
a two-dimensional analysis. Moreover, due to the periodicity of the structure, the 
single unit cell of the SIW is considered, with proper periodic boundary conditions 
(Figure 9.8). Symmetries can be exploited if the calculation of only a particular 
class of modes is required: namely, a perfect magnetic wall on the symmetry plane

Substrate Integrated Waveguide (SIW) 
is considered to calculate the fundamental and the odd modes, whereas a perfect 
electric wall on the symmetry plane is considered to calculate the even modes. 
Consequently, the generic structure considered in the analysis consists of one 
cylindrical post located in a rectangular domain, with periodic boundaries on two 
sides, the symmetry boundary condition on another side, and the radiation bound-
ary on the fourth side, as shown in Figure 9.8. The unknown quantity of the inte-
gral equation is the electric current density Jp flowing in the y direction along the 
surface of the metal post. The electric field generated by the electric current density 
Jp is expressed as a Green’s integral, through the dyadic Green’s function G. By 
imposing the electric wall condition on the surface of the metal post, the resulting 
integral equation is expressed in the form 
	
G(r,rʹ′) ⋅Jp(rʹ′) dSʹ′
Sp∫
= 0
	
(9.19)
where Sp represents the boundary of the metal post. In (9.19) the Green’s function 
is expanded in terms of TEz modes, propagating in the ±x direction, with the wave-
number kzn defined according to the Floquet theorem 
	
kzn = kz + 2π n
s
	
(9.20)
where kz is the complex wavenumber in the z-direction and n is an integer number. 
In the solution of the integral equation by the MoM, the unknown electric current 
Jp is approximated as the linear combination of basis functions Jpj, e.g. piece-wise 
linear functions defined on Sp. The application of the MoM in the Galerkin form 
leads to 
	
det[Z] = 0	
(9.21)
where the entries of matrix Z are given by 
	
Zij =
Jpi(r) ⋅G(r,rʹ′) ⋅Jpj(rʹ′)dSʹ′dS
Spi∫
Spj∫
	
(9.22)
The eigensolutions of (9.21) can be calculated numerically, frequency by frequency. 
The eigenvalues provide the complex values of wavenumbers kzi, which allow for 
calculating the attenuation and propagation constants of the i-th SIW modes 
	
αi = Im{kzi} 	
(9.23a)
	
βi = Re{kzi} 	
(9.23b)
The i-th eigenvector is the coefficient vector of the electric current density Jpi of the 
i-th SIW mode on the surface Sp of the metal post. Subsequently, the electric modal 
vector of the i-th SIW mode can be computed through the Green’s integral (9.19).

Analysis based on the surface impedance concept 
An efficient but approximate analysis method for calculating the propagation char-
acteristics of SIW structures is based on the surface impedance concept. In this 
approach, the rows of metalized cylindrical holes are represented as complex im-
pedance walls, and the propagation and attenuation constants are obtained by the 
transverse resonance technique [7,15]. 
In classical rectangular waveguides, the fundamental TE10 mode can be repre-
sented as the superposition of two plane waves, propagating in symmetrical direc-
tions [8]. The same model can be applied to SIW structures, where the fundamental 
mode is expressed as the combination of two symmetrical plane waves propagating 
at an angle ±q with respect to the longitudinal direction (Figure 9.9). If k is the 
wavenumber at the operation frequency, its longitudinal component b = k cos(q) 
represents the propagation constant. 
For lossless waveguides, the propagation constant at the cutoff frequency fc is  
b = 0, and therefore at the cutoff the two waves propagate in opposite directions 
and the angle results q = ±90°. Conversely, in the case of lossy waveguides, the cut-
off frequency is conventionally defined by the condition a = b. 
In the lossless case, at the cutoff frequency the two plane waves are incident 
perpendicularly on the periodic rows of metal cylinders. These waves are subject 
to a complex reflection coefficient S11, which can be computed in different ways. 
A full-wave MoM analysis was proposed in [7] for the rigorous calculation of the 
reflection coefficient. A simplified model was used in [15], under the approxima-
tion of modeling the posts as thin wires, and in [16], where squared metal posts 
are considered. 
The analysis algorithm starts by setting a tentative value fc of the cutoff fre-
quency. The value of the reflection coefficient calculated at fc allows for computing 
the normalized impedance ZL seen by the plane wave on the plane T1, where the 
centers of the metal posts are located (Figure 9.9): 
	
ZL = 1 + S11
1 - S11 	
(9.24)
The periodic row of metal cylinders can be approximated by a solid metal wall with 
surface impedance ZS, located in the shifted plane T2 (Figure 9.9). Consequently, 
the impedance ZL can be transformed into a surface impedance ZS = RS (1+j), re-
ferred to the shifted plane T2. Both RS and the separation Dw between planes T1

and T2 can be calculated by exploiting the relation between the two impedances ZL 
and ZS, which are linked by the equation 
	
ZL = r + jx = ZS + j tan(kcΔw)
1 + j ZS tan(kcΔw) = ZS + jA
1 + j ZSA 	
(9.25)
where r and x represent the real and imaginary part of ZL, respectively, kc = 2p/lc 
is the complex wavenumber of the plane wave, lc is the cutoff wavelength, and A 
is given by 
	
A = tan(kcΔw)	
(9.26)
The real and imaginary part of equation (9.25) yield a system of two equations 
	
r = RS[1 + A(r + x)]
RS(rA - xA - 1) = A - x
⎧
⎨⎪
⎩⎪
.
	
(9.27)
By obtaining RS from the first equation of (9.27) and replacing it in the second 
equation, the following quadratic equation results 
	
A2(r + x) + A(1 - r2 - x2) + (r - x) = 0 	
(9.28)
whose solution yields the value of A, which in turn permits to calculate the plane 
separation Dw by using (9.26). Subsequently, Rs can be computed by using the first 
equation of (9.27). 
Since the distance between the two planes T1 is given by w, the distance be-
tween the two planes T2 corresponds to the effective width weff = w + 2Dw. 
In the case of lossless structures, the resonance condition is 
	
weff = λc
2 	
(9.29)
whereas in the case of lossy structures the transverse resonance condition must be 
imposed: the summation of the impedances seen looking into both sides of the SIW 
structure must be zero. It finally results [7] 
	
weff = 2
kc
Re{cot−1[RS(1 - j)]}2 - Im{cot−1[RS(1 - j)]}2
	
(9.30)
This procedure is iterated, starting from the tentative value of the cutoff frequency 
fc, until the condition on the effective width weff of the equivalent waveguide de-
fined by (9.29) or by (9.30) is met. 
The calculation of the complete dispersion diagram of the SIW structure is 
based on the same approach, simply varying the direction of propagation q of the 
pair of plane waves [7].

9.2.3  Full-wave Modeling of SIW Components
The full-wave modeling of SIW components is a key point in the design and de-
velopment of SIW technology. In fact, the availability of flexible and accurate elec-
tromagnetic simulators is particularly important to fully exploit the potential and 
the flexibility of the SIW technology. For this reason, besides the use of commercial 
full-wave electromagnetic solvers, ad-hoc numerical simulation tools have been 
developed for the characterization and design of SIW components, with the aim to 
calculate their scattering or admittance matrices.
Finite-difference time-domain method
A popular and flexible numerical technique applied to the full-wave modeling of 
SIW components is the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method [17]. The 
FDTD method allows the modeling of SIW components with arbitrary geometry 
and any kind of dielectric substrate (including anisotropic and inhomogeneous ma-
terials). Moreover, this modeling technique provides the broadband solution in a 
single-pass simulation, with any kind of source excitation, and input/output transi-
tions can be easily included in the full-wave simulation. 
In general, the FDTD technique exhibits a rather limited computational ef-
ficiency, due to long computing time and large memory requirements. These issues 
become even more critical in the modeling of waveguide components, when the 
aim of the calculation is the determination of the parameters of the circuit, for 
instance in terms of the scattering matrix. In this case, there is the problem to sepa-
rate the incident wave from the reflected wave in the time domain. This problem is 
circumvented by adopting long input and output feeding sections, as discussed in 
[17], but this solution further increases the size of the analysis domain and, conse-
quently, the time and memory requirements. 
An innovative and efficient solution to overcome this limitation is based on the 
calibration technique, commonly adopted in practical circuit measurements [17]. 
Among the variety of numerical calibration methods proposed in the literature 
(including the short-open calibration and the thru-reflection-line calibration), the 
thru-line calibration technique is a very powerful and computationally efficient 
method, which was applied to the numerical modeling of SIW components and 
circuits in [17]. In the application of the thru-line calibration technique, the analy-
sis domain is subdivided into different sections (e.g., input line, device under test, 
output line; (Figure 9.10(a)). The application of this technique requires the analysis 
of three different structures: the first analysis involves the characterization of the 
complete structure, consisting of the device under test connected to the input and 
output transitions (Figure 9.10(a)), with the aim to determine the transfer matrix 
TD, which is expressed in the form 
	
TD = TXTDUTTY 	
(9.31)
where TDUT represents the transfer matrix of the device under test, and TX and 
TY are the transfer matrices of the input and output transitions, respectively. The 
second analysis requires the modeling of the thru connect, consisting of the direct 
connection of the input and output transitions (Figure 9.10(b)), to determine the 
transfer matrix TT defined as 

514
Substrate Integrated Waveguide (SIW) 
	
TT = TXTY 	
(9.32)
Finally, the third analysis considers the line connect, consisting of a straight SIW 
section with the same length of the device under test, and connected to the input 
and output transitions (Figure 9.10(c)). This analysis leads to the calculation of the 
transfer matrix TL 
	
TL = TXTSIWTY

where TSIW represents the transfer matrix of the straight SIW section. The thru-line 
calibration technique requires the algebraic manipulation of the three matrices and 
the solution of eigenvalue problems, as detailed in [17]. It finally leads to the deter-
mination of the transmission matrix TDUT. 
In these analyses, absorbing boundary conditions or a perfectly matched layer 
(PML) are defined around the SIW structure, to take into account possible radia-
tion effects. Particular care should be exercised in the choice of the length of the in-
put and output transitions: the transitions should be long enough, so that the field 
generated by the source exhibits the proper SIW mode structure at the interface 
between the transition and the device under test. 
Method of Moments and Cylindrical Eigenfunction Expansion
The integral equation method is a particularly efficient technique for the modeling 
of SIW components, due to their intrinsic characteristics. In fact, the geometry of 
SIW components is usually quite simple (being only composed of metalized cylin-
ders), the dielectric substrate is generally homogeneous, and the electromagnetic 
shielding, yet not perfect, is practically complete if the gaps between metal cylin-
ders are sufficiently small. These features can be exploited in the application of the 
integral equation method, which can take advantage of the similarity with classical 
H-plane waveguide components. The integral equation method is more efficient 
than finite-difference or finite-element techniques, because it requires the definition 
of the problem unknowns only on the boundaries of the investigation domain, 
namely the contour of the metal cylinders. 
An efficient implementation of the integral equation method for the modeling 
of SIW components was proposed in [18,19], where the classical integral equation 
solved by the method of moments is combined with the use of a cylindrical eigen-
function expansion. In this implementation, the electromagnetic field inside the 
structure is determined by the electric current densities Js and the magnetic current 
densities Ms defined on the port segments (Figure 9.11). The current densities on 
the remaining portion of the external contour can be ignored, because the field is 
completely confined inside the SIW structure provided that the metal cylinders are 
closely spaced. The field scattered by the metal cylinders (both the posts defining 
the side walls of the SIW structure and possible internal posts) is expressed in terms 
of a summation of cylindrical functions. The total electric field inside the SIW com-
ponent has only the z component and it can be expressed as

are the local polar coordinates of the n-th metal cylinder (with the origin located at 
the center of the cylinder), βs is the phase constant in the dielectric substrate, and 
am,n represents an unknown coefficient (related to the amplitude of the m-th order 
Hankel function of the n-th metal cylinder).

rent density Js and magnetic current density Ms defined on the port segments. In 
order to determine EZ

The electric fields generated by Js and Ms on each sub-port are given by

of the dielectric substrate. Consequently, Ez
PORT can be computed by summing the 
contributions of all sub-ports. 
The integral equation is obtained by enforcing the proper boundary conditions, 
which are of two types. The first type of condition is imposed on the contour of 
the metal posts, where the electric wall condition (or, alternatively, the Leontovic 
condition in the case of finite metal conductivity) is set. The second condition is 
imposed on the port segments, where the condition is Ez = IM, i.e., the z-component 
of the electric field is equal to the transverse component of the magnetic current 
density at the center of each sub-port. 
Finally, the solution of the integral equation by the method of moments (MoM) 
leads to the determination of the impedance matrix Z of the SIW component [19]. 
Boundary Integral-Resonant Mode Expansion (BI-RME) method
The BI-RME method is a hybrid integral equation/modal technique, originally de-
veloped for classical waveguide components [20] and subsequently applied for the 
modeling of SIW structures [21].

The BI-RME method permits the direct determination of the wideband fre-
quency response of SIW components: this feature depends on the particular form 
of the generalized admittance matrix Y calculated by the BI-RME method, which 
is expressed in the form of a pole expansion in the frequency domain. 
In the lossless case, the SIW component is composed of ideal dielectric mate-
rial and perfect conductor, and the radiation loss is negligible: consequently, in 
the application of the BI-RME method, the structure is supposed to be completely 
shielded by an external fictitious metal wall defined around the actual SIW com-
ponent (Figure 9.12(a)). In addition, the input and output ports of the circuit are 
defined as rectangular waveguide modes: as an example, two physical ports, with 
N rectangular waveguide modes defined on each port, are considered in this case 
(Figure 9.12(a)). Under these hypotheses, the Y matrix relating 2N modal currents 
and voltages of the rectangular waveguide ports can be expressed as

where w=2pf is the angular frequency, A and B are 2N × 2N matrices, related to 
the low-frequency behavior of the admittance matrix, W is a M-element diagonal 
matrix, whose entries are the resonance angular frequencies of the first M modes 
of the cavity obtained by short-circuiting the ports of the SIW circuit, and C is a  
2N× M matrix related to the coupling between the ports modes and the aforemen-
tioned resonant cavity modes. The calculation of matrices A, B, C and W by the BI-
RME method is detailed in [20]. Matrices A, B, C and W are frequency independ-
ent matrices and, therefore, the expression of the Y matrix in (9.36) exhibits an 
explicit dependency on the angular frequency w. Consequently, once these matrices 
are known, this representation of the Y matrix allows to calculate the frequency 
response of the circuit at any frequency of interest in a negligible time, with no need 
of frequency-by-frequency full-wave analyses. For this reason, the BI-RME method 
is a very efficient technique for modeling and design of complex SIW structures. 
The expression of the Y matrix determined in (9.36), however, relates modal 
currents and voltages of the rectangular waveguide ports, whereas the relation be-
tween modal voltages and currents of the SIW modes is actually required. 
The generalized admittance matrix Y′ relating 2P modal voltages and currents 
of the SIW modes can be obtained from Y matrix by a port mode transforma-
tion (Figure 9.12(b)). This transformation is based on the technique described in 
Sec. 9.2.2, where the P modal vectors of each SIW port are expressed as a linear 
combination of the N modal vectors of the embedding rectangular waveguide, as 
in formula (9.8). To perform this change, the transformation matrix T needs to 
be defined [22]: in the case of a two-port circuit, the block diagonal matrix T is 
defined as

where Lp,n represents the p-th element of the n-th eigenvector of the ABCD matrix

obtained as

whereas matrix Ω, which is not related to the port modes, remains unchanged. 
If the conductor and dielectric losses in the SIW component are low but not 
negligible, formulation (9.36) of the admittance matrix can be modified to account 
for conductor and dielectric losses, by using a perturbation approach [21]. In this 
case, the dielectric substrate is characterized by a complex dielectric permittivity e 
= e0er - jsd / w, where e0 is the dielectric permittivity of vacuum, er is the relative 
dielectric constant of the medium, sd is the conductivity of the dielectric material, 
and the conductor has a finite conductivity sc. The expression of the generalized 
admittance matrix Y results

(9.40)
where Q is an M-element diagonal matrix, whose entries are the quality factors of 
the cavity modes. The quality factor of cavity modes depends on both the conduc-
tivity sd of the dielectric substrate and the conductivity sc of the conductor [21]. 
Expression (9.40) of the generalized admittance matrix preserves all the advantages 
of (9.36): same as the lossless expression, it represents a mathematical model of the 
frequency response of the SIW component, and it permits its broadband modeling 
representation in one single full-wave calculation. Moreover, also in the lossy case, 
the transformation from the Y matrix relating modal currents and voltages of the 
rectangular waveguide ports to the Y′ matrix relating modal voltages and currents 
of the SIW modes can be performed with the technique discussed above, by adopt-
ing the transformation matrix T defined in (9.37). 
Radiation loss can be accounted for by including in the full-wave analysis ad-
ditional ports, located at the sides of the SIW circuits, which are subsequently 
connected to matched loads [21]. This solution permits to include radiation loss 
in a numerical method which is intrinsically developed for shielded components, 
without spoiling the representation of the admittance matrix based on the resonant 
cavity modes. A sufficient number of propagating modes need to be considered at 
each side port, to guarantee an accurate approximation of the radiation condition. 
As a consequence, this requirement prevents the use of the solution based on lateral 
matched ports in the modeling of the SIW unit cell: in fact, in this case, the width 
of the lateral ports is too small, and usually all modes are below cutoff in the fre-
quency band of interest. 
As an example, the BI-RME method is applied to the electromagnetic simula-
tion of a band-pass SIW filter operating at 28 GHz, with two centered and two 
offset metal posts, first proposed in [5]. The geometry of the filter is shown in Fig-
ure 9.13(a), and its dimensions are: w = 5.563 mm, d = 0.775 mm, s = 1.525 mm, 
o = 1.01 mm, s1 = 4.71 mm, s2 = 5.11 mm; the dielectric substrate has a thickness

h = 0.787 mm, a relative dielectric constant er = 2.2 and dielectric conductivity sd 
= 0.0011 S/m (corresponding to a loss tangent tan d = 0.002 at 28 GHz), and the 
metal conductivity is sc = 4×107 S/m. The effect of surface roughness was not taken 
into account. In the BI-RME analysis of this filter, N = 20 rectangular waveguide 
modes are considered at each port, and M = 200 cavity modes are used in the Y 
matrix expression of (9.40). Since radiation losses are negligible in this structure, 
no side ports need to be defined. The BI-RME simulation results are shown in Fig-
ure 9.13(b) and compared with measured data from [5]. The inset of Figure 9.13(c) 
shows that the simulated insertion loss of this filter at 28 GHz is around 0.55 dB 
(0.15 dB due to dielectric loss and 0.4 dB to conductor loss), while the measured

one is 1 dB: the difference is attributed to the effect of the transitions from the mi-
crostrip to the SIW structure, which are not included in the simulation. The inser-
tion loss of this SIW filter is remarkably low, and comparable with the performance 
of microstrip circuits. 
9.2.4  Equivalent Circuits Models of SIW Discontinuities
Besides the full-wave modeling of SIW components, the use of equivalent circuit 
models represents an efficient and powerful design tool [22]. The use of equivalent 
circuit models is especially important in the design of large SIW circuits, where 
the increased complexity leads to unduly long computing time even when using 
efficient electromagnetic simulation techniques. This approach is a traditional tech-
nique for the analysis and optimization of waveguide components, which dates 
back to the fundamental work of Nathan Marcuvitz [23] in the 1940’s. 
The basic idea is very simple: the modeling of complete and complex wave-
guide circuits is usually time consuming, due to the large size of the structure. The 
computational burden can be reduced by adopting a segmentation technique: the 
circuit is subdivided into elementary building blocks, which are analyzed separately 
and characterized by scattering or admittance matrices. Finally, the matrices cal-
culated for all building blocks are combined, to determine the frequency response 
of the entire circuit. In large circuits some elementary building blocks may appear 
several times throughout the structure: in this case, each building block topology 
needs to be analyzed only once, thus providing an additional advantage. The seg-
mentation technique becomes significantly more efficient if the matrices character-

izing the elementary building blocks are determined through equivalent circuits 
instead of full-wave analyses. 
In the case of passive SIW components, the elementary building blocks can be 
a variety of simple SIW discontinuities, like iris windows, waveguide sections with 
inductive posts, or waveguide bends (Figure 9.14). The equivalent circuit models 
characterizing these elementary building blocks consist of the combination of in-
ductors, capacitors, resistors, and ideal waveguide sections [22]. 
If accurate results are required, particular requirements are imposed on the 
features of the equivalent circuit models. First of all, equivalent circuit models are 
usually required to be multimodal: as closely spaced discontinuities interact also 
through the evanescent higher-order modes, the fundamental mode on the ports 
is not sufficient to describe this physical phenomenon. Therefore, these building 
blocks are characterized by generalized matrices, where a few modes (usually 3 to 
10) are defined at each physical port, and consequently the equivalent circuit model 
is multimodal. In addition, the technique adopted for deriving the equivalent cir-
cuit model plays an essential role in the accuracy of the results: simple equivalent 
circuits like the ones proposed in [23] do not guarantee sufficient accuracy over a 
wide band, and are not recommended. Accurate models may be obtained from sets 
of full-wave analyses and subsequent fitting or processing of the results. As a final 
requirement, equivalent models need to be parametric: an analytical expression 
provides the value of each lumped element as a function of the geometrical dimen-
sions of the building block. Parametric equivalent circuit models are particularly 
helpful, because they can be adopted for the design and optimization of SIW com-
ponents, and not only for their analysis. 
A particularly effective technique for deriving equivalent circuit models is based 
on the use of BI-RME method [22]. The BI-RME method provides the generalized 
admittance matrix Y of the building block in the form of a pole expansion in the 
frequency domain, as discussed in the previous section. In the lossless case [21], the 
ij-th entry of the Y matrix (9.36) is given by

jω + jωBij + jω3
CimCjm

(9.41)
where i and j refer to the port modes, and M is the number of resonances of the 
cavity obtained by short-circuiting the ports of the building block. The quantities 
Aij, Bij, Cim, and ωm are frequency independent and are calculated very efficiently 
by the BI-RME method [20]. 
By extracting the term for w→∝ from the summation in (9.41), the expression 
of Yij is recast in the form

This expression can be easily identified as the parallel combination of an inductor, a

ements appearing in Figure 9.15(a) are directly obtained from expression (9.42) as

As this equivalent circuit is directly derived from the full-wave modeling, the physi-
cal meaning of each lumped element can be identified. In particular, L0 and C0 are 
related to the low-frequency behavior of the frequency response, whereas the LC-
series resonators are associated to the resonant modes of the cavity obtained by 
short-circuiting the ports of the building block [20, 22]. Consequently, the accuracy

of the model is strictly related to the number of LC-series resonators: including 
additional resonators in the equivalent circuit model increases its accuracy and 
extends its frequency range of validity. 
The identification of the equivalent lumped-element circuit for the ij-th entry of 
the Y matrix allows, in turn, to directly derive the equivalent model of the building 
block. When adopting a p-type model, the resulting equivalent circuit is shown in 
Figure 9.15(b) in the case of a 2-port circuit, where YA = YC = Y11+Y12 and YB = 
-Y12. In this schematic, the equivalent circuit is simplified by considering only one 
LC-series resonator. By using this procedure, the topology of the equivalent circuit 
and the values of the lumped elements can be directly obtained from the result of a 
full-wave analysis, thus avoiding any initial guess or fitting procedure. Of course, 
the procedure illustrated here in the case of two-port building blocks can be ex-
tended to an arbitrary number of ports. 
This approach also allows to determine parametric equivalent circuit models, 
where the values of the lumped elements depend on the geometrical dimensions of 
the structure. Parametric models can be achieved by performing repeated full-wave 
analyses for different geometrical dimensions and by fitting through polynomials 
the value of the lumped elements [22]. 
The same approach can be applied in the derivation of equivalent circuit mod-
els of lossy building blocks, where both dielectric and conductor losses are con-
sidered [24]. The conductor has a finite metal conductivity sc and the dielectric 
medium is characterized by a complex dielectric permittivity e = e0er - jsd / w. The 
expression of the ij-th entry of the Y matrix, after extracting the term for w → ∞ 
from the summation, results in

The derivation of the complete model resembles the procedure followed in the loss-
less case, with the only addition of the resistors that account for losses [24]. 
The use of parametric equivalent circuit models allows for a very fast analysis 
and design of SIW circuits. Moreover, once the circuit models are available, the 
design of SIW circuits can be performed with no need of full-wave simulators, but 
only using a Spice-like circuit simulator. To better explain the use and features of 
equivalent circuit models, the analysis of the band-pass SIW filter shown in Figure 
9.13(a) is reported as an example. 
By adopting the segmentation technique, the circuit is subdivided into nine sub-
circuits: two centered-post discontinuities, two offset-post discontinuities, and five 
SIW sections (Figure 9.16(a)). Each discontinuity is modeled by a lumped-element 
equivalent circuit, with five modes per port and one LC series resonator. The value 
of each lumped element (inductance or capacitance) depends on the value o of the 
offset of the post, and it is expressed by a third-order polynomial function. The 
SIW sections are modeled by using the analytical frequency response of the cor-
responding equivalent rectangular waveguide, and also in this case five modes per 
port are considered. The frequency response of the filter, calculated by using the 
equivalent circuit models, is shown in Figure 9.16(b), and it compared well with 
the en-bloc analysis performed by the BI-RME method and with measurements 
results from [5]. 
9.3	
Design Considerations
The design of SIW interconnects and components can be performed by using the 
analysis techniques described in Section 9.2, and following the same design rules 
adopted for the design of classical waveguide components. 
In addition, the specific characteristics of SIW structures need to be accounted 
for: in fact, the different mechanisms of loss, the radiation leakage, and the possible 
band-gap effect due to the periodicity of the metal posts determine the efficiency 
of SIW circuits. 
The preliminary step for the design of SIW components is the determination of 
the basic geometry of the SIW structure, namely the width w of the waveguide, the 
diameter d of the holes, and the longitudinal spacing s between the holes (Figure 
9.2). The selection of w is related to the operation frequency band, as w basically 
determines the cutoff frequency of the fundamental mode of the SIW. The choice 
of d and s is related both to technological constraints (depending on the fabrica-
tion process) and to performance optimization (for instance, to loss minimization). 
The dielectric substrate has usually a relative dielectric constant er is usually in the 
range from 2 to 10 and a thickness h = 0.2-1 mm. The choice of the dielectric sub-
strate depends on a variety of factors: for instance, substrates with high dielectric 
constant are adopted with the aim to shrink the size of the component, while thick 
substrates are preferred to reduce conductor loss (as discussed in this Section). 
9.3.1	
Mechanisms of Loss
There are three major mechanisms of loss in SIW structures: conductor loss, di-
electric loss, and radiation leakage [21]. Conductor and dielectric losses in SIW

structures exhibit similar characteristics as in (dielectric-filled) metallic rectangular 
waveguides. Conversely, radiation leakage does not exist in classical waveguides, 
because they are completely shielded, and it appears in SIW structures because of 
the gaps between the metalized holes. 
If all kinds of losses are reasonably small, the attenuation constant aTOT for the 
fundamental mode of an SIW interconnect is the summation of the three contribu-
tions of loss: 
	
αTOT = αC + αD+ αR	
(9.46)
where aC represents the attenuation constant due to conductor loss, aD is the at-
tenuation constant due to dielectric loss, and aR denotes the attenuation constant 
due to radiation leakage. 
Conductor loss is due to the finite conductivity sc of the metal walls, including 
the top and bottom metal planes as well as the vertical vias. Due to the similarity of 
the field propagation in SIW and rectangular waveguide, the attenuation constant 
aC for the fundamental mode of an SIW can be calculated quite accurately by us-
ing the analytical formula [8] valid for the equivalent rectangular waveguide with 
width weff

π fε0εr

(9.47)
where sc is the metal conductivity, e0 is the free space permittivity, er is the relative 
dielectric constant of the dielectric substrate, and fc is the cutoff frequency of the 
SIW structure. 
Conductor loss is affected by the substrate thickness h: for a given transmit-
ted power, increasing the dielectric thickness reduces the amplitude of the electric 
current density flowing in the top and bottom metal layers, thus reducing the pow-
er dissipated by Joule effect. It results that attenuation constant aC is practically 
proportional to the inverse of the substrate thickness h. Therefore, increasing the 
thickness is an effective way to reduce the conductor loss in SIW structures. The 
maximum thickness is determined either by weff/2 (in order to preserve the maxi-
mum bandwidth of the single-mode regime) or by practical technological reasons. 
Conversely, the variation in the diameter of the metal vias and in their longitudinal 
spacing produces minor effects [25]. 
Dielectric loss is attributed to the loss tangent tan d of the dielectric substrate. 
Also in the case of aD, the similarity of the field propagation in SIW and rectangular 
waveguide allows for using the analytical formula of classical rectangular wave-
guides [25] to calculate the attenuation constant aD for the fundamental mode of 
an SIW structure

lation of aD. The attenuation constant aD is practically unaffected by the geometri-
cal dimensions of the SIW structure [25]. 
For most dielectric substrates, dielectric loss is the major contribution of loss 
when operating at mm-waves. This depends on two main factors: the intrinsic 
properties of the materials and the dependence on frequency of aC and aD. Typical 
substrates adopted for SIW structures have tan d between 10-3 and 10-4, and they 
are laminated with copper having a conductivity sc around 5  107 S/m. Concerning 
the frequency dependence, the attenuation constant aD due to dielectric loss is prac-
tically proportional to the frequency f, whereas the attenuation constant aC due to 
conductor loss is proportional to the f 1/2, and therefore its contribution becomes 
less significant when operating at higher frequency. 
Radiation leakage is caused by the gaps between the metal vias, which spoil 
the shielding of SIW structures. The effect of radiation leakage can be minimized 
by closely spacing the metal vias: the leakage is negligible if the ratio between the 
longitudinal spacing and the via diameter is s/d < 2.5, and a practical design rule 
is s/d = 2. 
An SIW interconnect with the following geometrical dimensions is considered 
as an example: w = 3.97 mm, d = 0.635 mm, s = 1.016 mm; the substrate thickness 
h = 0.254 mm, relative dielectric constant er = 9.9 and tan d = 0.0002, and metal 
conductivity sc = 5 ⋅ 107 S/m. The corresponding cutoff frequency of the SIW inter-
connect is fc = 13.58 GHz. 
Figure 9.17(a) shows the frequency behavior of the attenuation constant  
aC + aD, due to conductor and dielectric losses. In addition, the values of aC and 
aD versus frequency are reported separately. In all three cases, the attenuation is 
very large near the cutoff frequency of the SIW, and tends to become constant in 
the central portion of the single-mode frequency band. These plots are obtained by 
a full-wave simulation [24]. In this SIW structure, the attenuation constant aR due 
to radiation leakage is negligible if compared to the contribution of conductor and 
dielectric loss. 
The same SIW structure is adopted to investigate the effect of the substrate 
thickness h on losses, which is shown in Figure 9.17(b). The effect is significant 
on aC, which can be drastically reduced by increasing h. Conversely, aD does not 
practically change when modifying h: therefore, the geometrical dimensions do not 
permit to decrease dielectric losses, being the only solution the use of a dielectric 
material with smaller loss angle. 
The radiation leakage is finally considered, where the longitudinal spacing s is 
modified, being all other dimensions kept at their nominal values. Figure 9.17(c) 
shows that the attenuation constant aR due to radiation is practically negligible for 
small values of the ratio s/d, and tends to increase when s/d is larger than 2. 
In general, losses in SIW structures are higher than in hollow rectangular wave-
guides operating at the same frequency. Dielectric losses play an important role, as 
they are present in SIW structures and not in classical hollow metallic waveguides. 
Moreover, conductor losses in SIW are larger than in classical waveguides, because 
aC is proportional to the inverse of the thickness of the structure, and SIW are typi-
cally much thinner than metallic rectangular waveguides. 
A comparison with planar transmission lines (e.g., microstrip line and copla-
nar waveguide) is not straightforward, for a number of reasons. The attenuation 

530
Substrate Integrated Waveguide (SIW) 
constant in SIW structures changes with frequency as in classical waveguides: it 
assumes a very large value near the cutoff frequency and it tends to become flat 
in the center of the single-mode frequency band (Figure 9.18). Conversely, the at-
tenuation constant of microstrip lines and coplanar waveguides is monotonically 
increasing with frequency. Moreover, in SIW structures the substrate thickness can 
be increased with the aim to reduce the conductor loss. The same increase of the 
substrate thickness could have undesired and detrimental effects in the case of mi-
crostrip lines: also in this case, in fact, the conductor loss would be reduced, but 
the structure becomes more subject to radiation leakage, especially in the presence 
of bends or discontinuities.

A comparison of losses in different planar waveguides and transmission lines 
has been performed. In this comparison, an SIW structure, a microstrip and a co-
planar waveguide are designed on the same dielectric substrate (substrate thick-
ness h = 0.254 mm, relative dielectric constant er = 9.9, tan d = 0.0002, sc = 5·107 
S/m). The dimensions of the SIW structure are w = 3.97 mm, d = 0.635 mm, s = 
1.016 mm, and microstrip line and coplanar waveguide are dimensioned to exhibit 
a characteristic impedance of 50 W: the width of the microstrip is 0.24 mm, the 
conductor width of the coplanar waveguide is 0.24 mm and its gaps are 0.1 mm. 
The results are shown in Figure 9.18, which reports the attenuation constant 
of the three planar interconnects, in the single-mode operation band of the SIW. 
They show that, with this dielectric substrate, the SIW structure exhibits better 
performance in terms of losses in the upper part of the operation frequency band. 
9.3.2  Guided–wave and Leaky-wave Regions of Operation
As already stated, the electromagnetic performance of SIW structures strongly de-
pends on the diameter d of the metalized holes, their longitudinal spacing s, and 
the width w of the waveguide (Figure 9.2). In particular, if the longitudinal spac-
ing s becomes large, the electromagnetic field is not confined anymore inside the 
waveguide and the SIW tends to radiate. This radiation effect can be considered 
either as a power leakage (if the structure is intended as a transmission line), or as a 
contribution to radiation (if the structure is designed to be a leaky-wave antenna). 
When the SIW structure is used as a transmission line, the geometry of the SIW 
is optimized for radiation loss minimization. Since the SIW structure is subject to 
intrinsic sources of loss (namely dielectric and conductor losses), radiation leakage 
aR can be considered acceptable if it does not exceed the other types of loss [7]. 
With the typical values of dielectric and conductor loss in SIW structures, the at-
tenuation due to radiation leakage can be considered acceptable up to a maximum 
value of 10-4 neper/rad. This condition on the radiation leakage defines a set of 
constraints for the geometrical parameters of SIW structures: in particular, dimen-
sions d and s must be properly selected in order to meet these constraints, thus 
defining the guided-wave region in the d-s plane (Figure 9.19). 
Conversely, when the SIW structure is intended to be a leaky-wave antenna, 
the radiation leakage should largely exceed the contribution due to conductor and 
dielectric losses: if the radiation leakage per unit length (or per wavelength) is too 
small, the size of the antenna becomes excessively large. For standard character-
istics of dielectric substrates, a minimum value of attenuation due to radiation 
leakage can be set as 10-3 neper/rad [7]. In this case, the geometrical constraints 
determine the leaky-wave region in the d-s plane (Figure 9.19). 
There is an additional region (denoted as the forbidden region in Figure 9.19), 
where radiation losses are too high for using the SIW as a transmission line and 
too low for designing a leaky-wave antenna. This region and the corresponding 
combinations of d and s should be avoided.

Substrate Integrated Waveguide (SIW) 
9.3.3  Band-gap Effects in SIW Structures
SIW is a periodic structure and consequently it is subject to band-gap effects. The 
presence of a band-gap spoils the performance of the SIW structure, both in the 
case of guided waves and in the case of leaky-wave operation. 
As discussed in [7], the first band-gap appears at 
	
βs = π	
(9.49)
where b is the propagation constant of the SIW. This equation can be used to deter-
mine the longitudinal spacing s required to locate the band-gap at the upper limit 
of the single-mode bandwidth. As the single-mode bandwidth ranges from fc to 
2 fc, the propagation constant at 2 fc is 
	
β =

where kc and lc represent the cutoff wave-number and the cutoff wavelength of the 
fundamental SIW mode, respectively. Combining (9.49) and (9.50) results in

(9.51)
Under this condition, the first band-gap is centered at the cutoff frequency 2fc of the 
second mode of the SIW. In this way, since the band-gap has a finite bandwidth, the 
single-mode bandwidth of the SIW is partially reduced [7]. This effect can be com-
pletely avoided by adopting a condition more restrictive than (9.51), for example  
s/lc < 0.25. As lc @ 2w, this condition can be reformulated as s < w/2.

9.3.4  SIW Design Rules
The results achieved in the previous sections allow to derive a set of design rules 
for choosing the geometrical dimensions of SIW structures [7]. These rules permit 
to identify a region in the d-s plane, where the SIW operates as a transmission line 
with minimum radiation leakage and no band-gap. 
The first condition depends on a physical reason: the diameter d of the metal-
ized cylindrical holes cannot exceed their longitudinal spacing s (otherwise the met-
al cylinders would intersect), and therefore s > d. The second condition is needed to 
avoid any band-gap in the single-mode frequency band of the waveguide, and can 
be expressed as s/lc < 0.25. Furthermore, to minimize radiation leakage the gap size 
should be small, and therefore the ratio between the spacing s and the post diam-
eter d is limited by the condition s/d < 2. Finally, a last condition is defined to avoid 
over-perforated substrates: by setting s > lc/20, the number of metalized cylindrical 
holes should not exceed 20 per wavelength. 
To summarize, the four conditions 
	
s > d

s/d < 2

define a region in the d-s plane (marked in gray in Figure 9.20), which should be 
selected for the design of SIW structures. 
9.4	
Other SIW Configurations
SIW structures exhibit two major limitations when compared to traditional planar 
transmission lines: their bandwidth is narrower and their size is larger. 
Figure 9.21  Substrate integrated folded waveguide configuration and field pattern (front view).

534
Substrate Integrated Waveguide (SIW) 
The operation bandwidth of the SIW is limited to about one octave and cor-
responds to the single-mode bandwidth of the waveguide, i.e. an SIW structure 
can be used from the cutoff frequency fc of the fundamental mode to the cutoff 
frequency 2 fc of the first upper mode. This represents a limitation in comparison to 
microstrip lines or coplanar waveguides, where the fundamental mode has no cut-
off and the transmission lines can typically be used from DC to some tens of GHz. 
In turn, the cutoff frequency fc determines the width of the SIW, as in any rec-
tangular waveguide [8]. Therefore, the size of the SIW is determined by the opera-
tion frequency. The width of an SIW is usually larger than the width of a microstrip 
line. To make a fair comparison, anyway, the width of an SIW should be compared 
with the minimum distance between two adjacent microstrip lines to avoid cross 
coupling: in this case, the difference in size appears much less significant. Con-
versely, compared to hollow rectangular waveguides, SIW structures benefit from 
the size reduction due to the dielectric loading, which makes them more compact 
by the factor εr. 
Several SIW configurations have been developed to overcome these limitations 
in bandwidth and compactness, as discussed in this Section. 
9.4.1  Substrate Integrated Folded Waveguide (SIFW)
The substrate integrated folded waveguide (SIFW) is based on the concept of the 
folded waveguide, originally proposed in [26], and it allows for reducing the wave-
guide width by using a dual-layer substrate. 
The SIFW is basically an SIW folded around a metal septum (Figure 9.21). The 
propagation characteristics of the SIFW mainly depend on the waveguide width w,

the substrate thickness h, and gap width g. As the SIFW is not an H-plane compo-
nent, its mode pattern and propagation characteristics also depend on the substrate 
thickness. This structure exhibits the same propagation characteristics as the SIW, 
provided the geometrical dimensions are carefully selected [27]. 
Compared to an SIW implemented in the same substrate, the SIFW leads to a 
reduction in width of a factor ranging from 2 to 3. The reduction factor depends on 
the geometrical dimensions. As shown in [27], for 2 g/w = h/w the width reduces to 
a half of that of a conventional SIW, and for h/w = 0.4 and g/w = 0.05 (very small 
gap) the width reduces to one third. In the former case, where the gap width is com-
parable with the substrate thickness, the width reduction is only due to the folding 
of the waveguide. In the latter case, where the gap width is extremely small, the 
electric field near the gap becomes very large and this effect determines a capacitive 
loading, which leads to a further reduction of the waveguide width. 
The SIFW exhibits larger non-radiative losses than the corresponding SIW, due 
to the large amplitude of the electric field in the gap region. Consequently, the loss 
increase is small for broad gaps and becomes more significant if the gap width is 
very small. The radiation loss from SIFW should be less from the left sidewall be-
cause the magnetic field in the upper and lower halves is expected to be equal and 
opposite (Figure 9.21). However, the magnetic field near the right sidewall becomes 
vertical and the corresponding longitudinal current on the sidewall is likely to ex-
cite vertical slots between the cylinders. This concept has been verified in relation 
to a slotline suspended in rectangular waveguide [28]. 
A prototype of SIFW operating in X band was proposed and demonstrated in 
[27]. A dielectric substrate with er=2.2 and thickness h=1.515 mm was adopted; the 
geometrical dimensions w = 7.75 mm and g = 0.9 mm provide a reduction of a fac-
tor two with respect to a conventional SIW with the same cutoff frequency (whose 
width should be w = 15.5 mm). 
Besides the compactness, SIFW structures present some favorable features: in 
particular, they are easy to fabricate as they do not require internal vias and they 
preserve the complete electrical shielding as the unfolded SIW. Approximate formu-
las for the design of SIFW were proposed in [29]. 
9.4.2  Half-Mode Substrate Integrated Waveguide (HMSIW)
The half-mode substrate integrated waveguide (HMSIW) is obtained by removing 
a half of the SIW, cutting along the symmetry plane in the propagation direction 
(Figure 9.22(a)) [30]. 
The HMSIW is based on the approximation that the symmetry plane of the 
SIW is a virtual magnetic wall for the fundamental mode: if a half of the waveguide 
is removed, the open side of the waveguide is nearly equivalent to a magnetic wall, 
due to the high ratio of width to height. For this reason, when cutting away half of 
the waveguide, the field distribution of the fundamental mode remains practically 
unchanged, while the width of the waveguide is reduce to a half. 
The width of the HMSIW can be simply calculated as half of the width of the 
standard SIW structure. Nevertheless, a more accurate design should take into ac-
count the effect of fringing fields, which slightly modify the effective width of the 

536
Substrate Integrated Waveguide (SIW) 
waveguide and consequently change its cutoff frequency. This effect can be taken 
into accounted by reducing the width by a correcting terms Dw, which is expressed 
by empirical formulas. A rigorous discussion of the propagation properties of HM-
SIW structures is provided in [31]. 
The HMSIW was proposed for the first time in [30], where the design and 
the experimental characterization of a prototype operating in Ku band is reported 
(Figure 9.22(b)). 
The major advantage of the HMSIW is its limited complexity: it permits to 
reduce to approximately a half the size of the SIW and the fabrication complexity 
is maintained at the same level as for the conventional SIW. Losses in HMSIW are 
comparable to those in conventional SIW, except in a small frequency band just 
above the cutoff, where the open side of the HMSIW behaves like a slot with uni-
form field distribution and radiation loss is very significant [31]. 
A combination of the SIFW and HMSIW techniques was also proposed [32], 
resulting in the folded half-mode substrate integrated waveguide (FHMSIW), which 
leads to a further size reduction. 
9.4.3  Substrate Integrated Slab Waveguide (SISW)
The substrate integrated slab waveguide (SISW) represents the implementation in 
SIW technology of the dielectric slab loaded rectangular waveguide, originally pro-
posed in [33]. This modified SIW configuration permits a significant enhancement 
in the single-mode bandwidth. 
In the SISW, the dielectric substrate is periodically perforated with air holes, 
located in the lateral portions of the waveguide (Figure 9.23). This process allows 
to reduce the effective dielectric constant eeff in the side portions of the waveguide, 
which results as a weighted average of the dielectric permittivity of the substrate 
and of the air. In the central portion of the waveguide, where there are no air holes, 
the value of the dielectric constant remains unchanged at er. The fundamental mode 
of the SISW (that resembles the TE10 mode of the rectangular waveguide) has the 
electric field more concentrated in the central portion of the waveguide, and con-
sequently it practically experiences the original dielectric constant er and its cutoff 
frequency is scarcely affected by the presence of the air holes. Conversely, in the 
second (TE20-like) mode of the SISW, the electric field is more concentrated in the 
Figure 9.23  Substrate integrated slab waveguide configuration (top view).

537
side portions of the waveguide, and therefore it is subject to the effective dielectric 
constant eeff, which is lower than er. As a consequence, the cutoff frequency of the 
second mode increases. 
The SISW was firstly proposed in [34], where a prototype covering the X and 
Ku bands was implemented. With a proper location and dimensioning of the air 
holes and the use of a dielectric substrate with er=10.2, a waveguide with single-
mode band from 7.5 GHz to 18 GHz was realized. 
The amount of bandwidth enhancement in the SISW mainly depends on the di-
electric material of the substrate: the use of materials with high dielectric constant 
er leads to a larger contrast between the dielectric constant er experienced by the 
fundamental mode and the effective constant eeff undergone by the second mode. 
The higher the contrast, the more significant the bandwidth increase. Moreover, the 
bandwidth enhancement can be improved by tightly packing the air holes, because 
this permits to lower the effective dielectric constant in the lateral portions of the

different length (from [38]).

waveguide, thus further increasing the cutoff frequency of the second mode. The 
minimum distance between air holes is limited by technological constraints. 
The major advantages of the SISW are the simple geometry and the single layer 
configuration, which allow an easy and cost effective implementation. 
9.4.4  Substrate Integrated Ridge Waveguide (SIRW)
The substrate integrated ridge waveguide represents the SIW counterpart of the 
ridge rectangular waveguide described in [35]. In the ridge waveguide, by adding 
a ridge in the middle of the broad wall of a rectangular waveguide, the cutoff fre-
quency of the fundamental mode is shifted to lower frequency, whereas the ­second 
mode is practically unperturbed. This effect determines a broader single-mode 
bandwidth. In addition, since the cutoff frequency of the fundamental mode in the 
ridge waveguide is lower than in the standard waveguide with the same width, the 
compactness of the waveguide is improved. 
The first version of the ridge waveguide in SIW technology was reported in 
[36-37]: in this case, the ridge is realized by a row of metal posts with partial 
height, located in the middle of the broad wall of the SIW (Figure 9.24(a)). A pro-
totype covering the frequency band from 4.9 GHz to 13.39 GHz was fabricated 
and measured, based on a double layer substrate. Subsequently, it was shown that 
the structure proposed in [36-37] suffers from band-gap issues, that arise when us-
ing ridge posts with large diameter [38]. This is a serious limitation, since the best 
performance in terms of broad operation bandwidth can be achieved with large 
diameter of the ridge posts. 
The second version of the ridge SIW was then proposed in [38]. In this struc-
ture, the issue of the band-gap is overcome by adding a metal strip, that connects 
the bottom of the ridge posts (Figure 9.24(b)). This ridge SIW configuration does 
not exhibit any band-gap, even for a large diameter of the ridge posts. 
The single-mode bandwidth of ridge SIW can be maximized by properly select-
ing the dimensions of the ridge posts. The use of long ridge posts permit to obtain 
large bandwidth, as they minimize the gap between the post and the ground plane 
and therefore they create a large capacitance. In SIW implementation, using long 
ridge posts (and consequently small gaps) implies adopting a very thin dielectric 
layer: therefore, the limit is usually imposed by technological constraints. The di-
ameter of the ridge posts also plays an important role: increasing the diameter 
of the ridge posts allows increasing the single-mode bandwidth, even though an 
optimum value exists and using larger diameters does not provide any further im-
provement [38]. 
A ridge SIW based on this configuration was designed and fabricated in [38] 
(Figure 9.24(c)), covering the frequency band 6.8-25.0 GHz (which is almost three 
times broader than the single-mode bandwidth of a standard SIW). Furthermore, 
the width of this ridge SIW structure is 40% smaller than a conventional SIW with 
the same cutoff frequency. 
Losses in ridge SIW are slightly larger than in standard SIW, due to increased 
conductor losses. This is mainly attributed to the mode pattern, where the electric 
field is strongly concentrated under the metal strip. For the same reason, the fre-
quency behavior of the attenuation constant is rather odd: it is similar to a classical 

Microstrip Lines and Slotlines
539
waveguide at low frequency, with high loss near the cutoff, and it resembles the 
typical behavior of a microstrip line at higher frequencies, where the attenuation 
constant monotonically increases with frequency [38]. 
The configuration of the ridge SIW is slightly more complicated than classical 
SIW, due to the presence of partial height metal posts. Its fabrication requires the 
use of two dielectric layers and may become difficult when using PCB technology, 
whereas the use of LTCC technology appears more suitable. 
The major advantage of the ridge SIW is represented by its extremely broad op-
eration bandwidth, which provides unique peculiarities and application potential 
in the scenario of SIW technology. In addition, the ridge SIW combines the wide 
bandwidth with a very compact size. 
A further improvement can be achieved by combining the concepts of the ridge 
SIW and of the SISW: by adding air holes in the lateral portions of the ridge SIW, 
the cutoff frequency of the second mode can be increased, thus obtaining an even 
larger single-mode bandwidth. A ridge SISW covering the single-mode frequency 
band 7.1-30.7 GHz was designed and fabricated in [38].

Transitions Between SIW and Planar Transmission Lines
As widely discussed in previous sections, SIW technology permits to integrate clas-
sical rectangular waveguides in planar form in a dielectric substrate, by adopting 
the manufacturing techniques traditionally used for microstrip-lines and coplanar-
waveguide circuits. Consequently, since these three transmission lines share the 
same physical medium and the same fabrication process, they can be realized si-
multaneously on the same dielectric substrate. This feature opens interesting per-
spectives for hybrid circuits and systems, but at the same time it poses the problem 
of implementing proper transitions between SIW structures and microstrip/CPW 
transmission lines. 
The use of such transitions is also required for the experimental characterization 
of SIW prototypes by means of a vector network analyzer, which typically needs to 
be connected to a 50-W planar transmission line: for this reason, prototypes of SIW 
components usually require transitions to input/output microstrip lines or CPW 
lines. 
Therefore, the design of transitions between SIW structures and planar trans-
mission lines represents a key element in the development of SIW components. A 
significant effort has been devoted to the design of a variety of different transition 
topologies, which need to be broadband, possibly planar, and easy to fabricate. 
9.5.1  Microstrip-to-SIW Transitions
The geometry of the transitions between microstrip lines and SIW structures is 
usually quite simple, because of the similarity between the modal fields in the two 
structures. 
A compact, single layer transition between microstrip line and SIW is obtained 
by connecting the conductor of the microstrip to the top wall of the SIW through a 
tapered microstrip section (Figure 9.25(a)), and the ground plane of the microstrip 
to the bottom wall of the SIW [4]. The taper of the microstrip line allows to reduce 
the discontinuity effects and to guarantee a good matching. Long linear tapers, 
usually up to half wavelength, are required to achieve broadband input matching. 
The tapered microstrip transition is the most commonly adopted microstrip-to-
SIW transition for several reasons: its geometry is very simple and easy to fabricate, 
its dimensions are compact and the insertion loss is quite low. The design of this 
transition usually requires full-wave simulations, to determine the length of the 
taper and its width. Analytical equations, derived from curve fitting, have been 
proposed in [39] to evaluate the optimum dimensions of the taper, with no need of 
full-wave simulations. By adopting these tapered transitions, it is generally possible 
to obtain an input reflection coefficient lower than -20 dB over the full standard 
single-mode bandwidth of the SIW (conventionally defined as the frequency range 
from 1.25 f0 to 1.9 f0). 
If the substrate thickness of the microstrip line differs from the thickness of the 
SIW structure, the connection of the microstrip to the top wall of the SIW can be 
performed through a via hole [40]. This solution is mainly applicable in the case of 
LTCC technology.

9.5.2  CPW-to-SIW Transitions
In several cases, coplanar waveguides are preferred to microstrip lines, especially 
when they need to be integrated on the same substrate with SIW structures. In fact, 
thick substrates are used to reduce conductor loss in SIW structures, and this pre-
vents the use of microstrip lines on the same substrate, because they may be subject 
to large radiation leakage. Conversely, CPW is compatible with thick substrates, as 
its electrical parameters can be optimized practically with any substrate thickness. 
Different transition topologies have been proposed to connect coplanar wave-
guides to SIW structures. The most common solution is based on a coplanar wave-
guide with a 90° bend of each slot inside the SIW structure (Figure 9.25(b)) [41]. 
A stub can be added in the CPW line with the aim to better match the transition. 
In some cases, the angle of the bent slots can be optimized to improve the match-
ing as well as the bandwidth performance [42]. The major issue of this transition 
topology is related to spurious radiation: this transition is similar to a center-fed 
slot antenna, which radiates both in the substrate (thus exciting the SIW mode) and 
outside the SIW structure (thus determining undesired radiation loss). 
A modified version of this transition was proposed in [43] for an electrically 
thick high-permittivity substrate. The main feature of this transition is the pres-
ence of an SIW cavity around the 90° bent slots. This transition permits to achieve 
wideband performance: measurements demonstrated 40% bandwidth with 15 dB 
return loss or better and 0.5 dB insertion loss for a single transition in the 50 GHz 
frequency range. 
An alternative topology of CPW-to-SIW transition, specifically developed for 
grounded CPW, makes use of a current probe [44]: the current vertically flowing 
through the probe generates a magnetic field, which matches with the magnetic 
field of the fundamental mode of the SIW structure. 
In general, the performance of CPW-to-SIW transitions in terms of bandwidth 
is significantly inferior to microstrip-to-SIW transitions. Typical values of achiev-
able relative bandwidth are in the order of 20% to 30%. The performance is better 
in the case of conductor-backed CPW, where transitions with an input reflection 
coefficient lower than -20 dB are able to cover the full standard single-mode band-
width of the SIW [42].

Siw Components and Antennas
SIW technology allows implementation of a variety of components and antennas, 
with characteristics very similar to the corresponding planar components and an-
tennas in classical metallic waveguide technology. This similarity has fostered the 
rapid growth of several passive and active components in SIW technology, as the 
same configurations and design rules developed for classical waveguide compo-
nents have been applied to the implementation of SIW components. 
Besides the compact size, low weight and low cost, SIW implementation exhib-
its a number of special features. The most important feature of SIW components is 
the design flexibility, which mainly depends on the possibility to arbitrarily define 
the shape of the components: in fact, the post walls as well as the internal metal cyl-
inders can be freely located, thus offering large flexibility to the designer. Moreover, 

542
Substrate Integrated Waveguide (SIW) 
the possibility to stack several dielectric substrates and obtain multilayer circuits 
permits to realize compact components and to integrate multiple functions in mini-
mum space. Finally, the easy integration of SIW structures with planar transmission 
lines allows to combine various technologies in the same substrate: for the same 
reason, the integration of active devices is less problematic in SIW components 
than in classical metallic waveguides.

filter; (c) filter with iris windows.

9.6.1  Passive Components
The first and most common passive components implemented in SIW technology 
have been the filters, with several topologies proposed and demonstrated along the 
years. SIW filters represent a good compromise between classical metallic wave-
guide filters and printed microstrip filters: SIW filters are definitely better than mi-
crostrip filters in terms of performance, especially in the mm-wave frequency range, 
where the microstrip is too lossy to design high Q components. Compared to wave-
guide filters, SIW filters are much lighter, more compact and by far less expensive, 
even though they cannot achieve extremely high selectivity. 
SIW Filters 
Simple SIW filters are based on inline configurations: they consist of a straight SIW 
section (defined by two rows of metal cylinders) and some additional isolated metal 
cylinders located inside the SIW, which are used to defined the filter cavities. In the 
simple configuration, called the inductive post SIW filter, the cavities are defined by 
single metal posts, either centered or offset with respect to the vertical symmetry 
plane of the SIW structure (Figures 9.26(a) and 9.26(b)) [5]. The longitudinal spac-
ing of such metal cylinders is in the order of half guided wavelength. In centered 
post SIW filters, all internal cylinders have different diameters, and the first and 
last metal cylinders usually have a very small diameter (Figure 9.26(a)): the small 
diameter is required to achieve good input matching, but it poses serious techno-
logical issues (especially in the mm-wave frequency range) and it tends to increase

with rectangular cavities, featuring positive and negative cross–coupling.

544
Substrate Integrated Waveguide (SIW) 
conductor loss (as large electric current density flows along the surface of the thin 
metal cylinder). For this reason a different topology is typically preferred, where 
the internal metal posts defining the filter cavities are properly offset from the sym-
metry plane of the SIW structure (Figure 9.26(b)). In this filter configuration, the 
diameter of the internal metal cylinders is usually kept constant, and in most cases 
it is identical to the diameter of the metal cylinders used to define the side walls of 
the SIW. 
Another class of inline SIW filters is represented by the SIW filters with iris 
windows, where the filter cavities are defined by pairs of symmetrically located 
metal cylinders (Figure 9.26(c)) [45]. As in classical iris filters in metallic waveguide 
technology, the filter design requires the determination of the cavity lengths and of 
the width of the iris windows. Typically the inner cavities have higher quality factor 
(and therefore the corresponding iris windows are more closed) and the external 
cavities have lower quality factor (and consequently the external iris windows are 
more open). 
A more flexible SIW filter configuration is based on properly shaped resonant 
cavities: SIW cavities with various sizes and shapes are connected by an opening or 
a short evanescent waveguide section (Figure 9.27(a)). Both rectangular [46] and 
circular cavities [47] have been adopted to implement SIW filters. Besides the in-
creased design flexibility, cavity filters often allow to locate transmission zeros out 
of the pass-band, thus improving the filter selectivity. 
A significant enhancement in filter performance can be achieved by exploit-
ing the cross-coupling between adjacent cavities (Figure 9.27(b)), with the use of 
positive and negative coupling structures [48], [49]. Both positive and negative 
coupling structures are needed to generate transmission zeros at finite frequencies 
in the frequency response of the filter, thus achieving higher selectivity and design-
ing elliptic and quasi-elliptic filters. Positive coupling can be simply obtained by an 
iris window connecting two SIW cavities [48]. Negative coupling is more difficult 
to obtained in SIW technology, and it can be realized by an iris window and two 
balanced slots with a pair a metal cylinders [49] (Figure 9.27(b)). 
The filter dimensions can be reduced by the use of dual-mode cavities, where 
each nearly-square or nearly-circular cavity supports two almost degenerate reso-
nant modes [50]. Dual mode SIW filters permit to achieve higher filter selectivity 
in a very compact size. In dual-mode cavity filters, the frequency response exhibits 
a number of poles which is twice as large as the number of resonant cavities. The 
use of oversized SIW cavities has also been proposed [51], with the advantage to 
improve the stop-band performance by inserting transmission zeros (related to the 
interaction of higher order cavity modes). 
Another possible technique aiming at reducing the overall filter dimensions is 
based on multi-layer configurations, where the SIW cavities are stacked in different 
dielectric layers and are connected by openings in the common metal plane [52]. 
This filter configuration is particularly suitable for LTCC implementation [53–54]. 
One of the major limitations of SIW filters is related to losses: in fact, losses de-
termine the maximum value of the quality factor of the filter cavities, and this value 
poses a limit to the filter selectivity. In most cases, particularly at high frequency, 
the main contribution to losses is due to the dielectric substrate, and therefore it 
depends on the tan d of the dielectric material. In this case, the maximum achiev-

Microstrip Lines and Slotlines
545
able quality factor of the filter cavities is Q = 1/ tan d [55]: in practical cases, the 
achievable quality factor of SIW cavities is in the order of Q = 500. 
A design technique particularly suitable to overcome this limitation in SIW fil-
ters is based on the predistortion concept [56]: by properly dimensioning the filter 
cavities and couplings, the use of predistortion permits to realize a filter response 
with in-band flatness equivalent to a filter with higher quality factor. As an example 
[56], although the adopted dielectric material allows for obtaining SIW resonators 
Figure 9.28  Directional couplers in SIW technology: (a) coupler consisting of two adjacent 
SIW structures with an opening in the common wall; (b) cruciform shape SIW coupler. 

546
Substrate Integrated Waveguide (SIW) 
with a quality factor Q = 500, the use of predistortion permits to realize a filter 
response with in-band flatness equivalent to a filter with Q = 2000, not achiev-
able otherwise with the adopted material in SIW technology. Nevertheless, this 
improvement in the filter selectivity is obtained at the cost of degrading the input 
matching of the filter. 
SIW filters have been implemented from the low microwave range (starting 
from few GHz), up to the mm-wave frequency band, at 60 GHz [45] and 180 GHz 
[57], by using various fabrication technologies. At very low frequencies, the use of 
SIW filters becomes unpractical due to the large size. Conversely, the implementa-
tion of SIW filters at high frequencies requires a special care in the substrate selec-
tion, as the issue of dielectric loss tends to spoil the filter performance. 
Tunable filters represent a special class of SIW filtering structures, where the 
frequency response and the pass-band can be modified electronically. Different tun-
ing solutions have been proposed and experimentally verified in SIW technology: 
PIN diodes mounted on top of SIW cavities were used in [58] for tuning the pass-
band of a two-pole filter from 1.55 GHz to 2.00 GHz, and RF MEMS switches 
were adopted in [59] to achieve a tuning range from 1.2 GHz to 1.6 GHz in the 
pass-band of a two-pole filter. 
SIW Directional Couplers
Another important class of passive components widely developed in SIW technol-
ogy are directional couplers. 
The traditional waveguide coupler, consisting of two adjacent waveguides with 
an opening in the common wall, can be implemented in single-layer SIW technol-
ogy, simply by removing some metal cylinders in the common wall between two 
parallel SIW structures (Figure 9.28(a)) [60]. By properly selecting the width of the 
opening, the coupling strength can be optimized at the desired value (e.g., -3 dB, 
-6 dB, or -10 dB). Weak coupling is obtained by placing a thin metal cylinder in 
the center of the aperture [60]. This coupler topology is compact and easy to fab-
ricate, thanks to the single-layer geometry. It allows for achieving relatively broad-
band performance (with relative bandwidth in the order of 25%). 
A very compact 3-dB directional coupler was proposed in [61], based on a 
cruciform shape in single-layer SIW technology: it consists of the cross-over of two 
SIW structures, with two additional metal cylinders located inside the square junc-
tion (Figure 9.28(b)). This hybrid coupler topology is simple and compact, and it 
was able to reach 18% bandwidth. 
An alternative configuration of SIW coupler is based on a dual-layer structure 
[62]: this coupler consists of two parallel waveguides, located one on top of the 
other, with two oblique parallel resonant slots in their common broad wall. The 
coupling strength can be varied from -3 dB to -6 dB, depending on the position, 
length, and angle of the coupling slots. A bandwidth of 16% was experimentally 
verified [62].

SIW Diplexers and Multiplexers
Planar SIW diplexers and multiplexers represent a class of SIW components similar 
to filters: they consist of a power divider cascaded with two (or more) planar filters 
and find application as channel separators in microwave communication systems. 
Planar SIW diplexers operating at 5 GHz [63] and at 25 GHz [50] have been fabri-
cated and tested. In these structures, the filter selectivity and the isolation between 
the channels represent figures of merit of the component. 
Among the passive components, several more structures have been implement-
ed in SIW technology, including power dividers [64], phase shifters [65], circulators 
[66], baluns [67], magic-T [68], and six-port circuits [69]. 
9.6.2  Active Circuits 
The design flexibility of SIW technology offers several possibilities for the imple-
mentation of active circuits, such as oscillators, mixers, and amplifiers. In particu-
lar, the development of SIW active components takes advantage of the possibility 
to mount active devices directly on top of the SIW structures, with no need of 
complex and lossy interconnections, as it usually happens in the case of classical 
metallic waveguides: in fact, the interconnection of active devices with SIW struc-
tures is typically based on simple and compact microstrip-to-SIW or CPW-to-SIW 
transitions. In few cases, the active devices are mounted directly inside the dielectric 
substrate: even thought this solution appears more suitable to the full system inte-
gration and better preserves the complete shielding of the SIW structures, it is often 
avoided, mainly because of technological and repeatability issues. 
SIW Oscillators 
The development of oscillators is particularly suited to SIW technology, thanks to 
the possibility to realize resonant cavities with relatively high quality factor. Two 
major SIW oscillator topologies have been implemented: the former is the feedback 
oscillator, composed of an amplifier circuit and an SIW cavity located in the feed-
back loop of the amplifier, which acts as a frequency selector (Figure 9.29(a)); the

latter topology is the reflection oscillator, consisting of a cavity resonator connected 
to the gate of a transistor and presenting a negative resistance (Figure 9.29(b)). 
A feedback oscillator operating at 12 GHz was firstly demonstrated in [70], 
with output power of 0 dBm and phase noise of -105 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset from 
the carrier. A reflection type oscillator operating in the X band was proposed in 
[71]: in this circuit, a transistor is connected to an SIW cavity. Moreover, a varactor 
diode mounted on top of the cavity allows for frequency tunability of the resonant 
cavity and, consequently, of the oscillation frequency: the resulting frequency tun-
ing range is 460 MHz, with output power from 6.5 to 10 dBm and phase noise of 
88 dBc/Hz at 100-kHz offset. Another reflection type oscillator at 35 GHz based 
on a Gunn diode was presented in [72]: it is based on an SIW cavity, with the active 
device is integrated at the edge of the cavity by removing a via hole and placing the 
diode in the substrate. The measured output power was 15.7 dBm, the phase noise 
was -91.2 dBc/Hz at a frequency offset of 100 KHz from the carrier, and the DC 
to RF efficiency of the oscillator resulted 0.74%. Similar reflection type oscillators 
were proposed in [73], where a Gunn diode is located near the center of the SIW 
cavity, and in [74], where frequency tuning capability was added by integrating a 
varactor diode together with a Gunn diode inside the SIW cavity. 
A different oscillator topology, based on the push-push oscillator concept (Fig-
ure 9.29(c)), was proposed in [75]. This push-push oscillator, operating at 29.5 
GHz, is based on the combination of two reflection type oscillators, which share 
the same SIW cavity with fundamental resonance at 14.75 GHz. The output of the 
two reflection type oscillators are connected using a Wilkinson power combiner, 
in such a way that the two oscillators are synchronized in frequency and oscillate 
out-of phase: consequently, the signals at the fundamental frequency are canceled 
at the output and the components at the second harmonic at 29.5 GHz are summed 
together. 
SIW Mixers 
Different mixer topologies are available in SIW technology. An SIW mixer can be 
implemented by combining an SIW 3-dB hybrid coupler and the active device. This 
SIW mixer topology was firstly proposed in [77]: it is single-balanced mixer, based 
on two diodes connected back-to-back and an SIW hybrid coupler, which is able to 
cover the entire X band with a measured conversion loss of 6.8 dB. An alternative 
millimeter-wave mixer operating in the frequency range 34–40 GHz was reported 
in [78], which integrates a single balanced mixer MMIC and a folded SIW filter. 
The dimension of this circuit is quite compact, only 3 × 3 cm2 including an IF out-
put amplifier. Measurements exhibited a conversion gain of 4 dB. A mixed tech-
nology mixer, based on the hybrid integration of SIW structures and conventional 
microstrip lines, was developed in [79] as a part of a 24 GHz automotive radar. 
The combination in a single compact component of oscillator and mixer func-
tionalities is obtained by the self-oscillating mixer [80], [81], where one single tran-
sistor is used both to generate the oscillation and to perform the mixing. These 
circuits are designed by properly biasing and loading the oscillator circuit, in order 
to achieve maximum conversion gain. The first SIW self-oscillating mixer was pre-

sented in [80]: it was based on a feedback oscillator, with a FET amplifier circuit 
connected to a rectangular SIW cavity. The fundamental oscillation frequency was 
14.3 GHz, but the structure was designed as a sub-harmonic mixer: in this way, 
the second harmonic of the oscillator was mixed with an RF signal at 30.4 GHz, 
to produce an intermediate frequency at 1.7 GHz with a measured conversion loss 
of 8.6 dB. 
SIW Amplifiers 
Another active SIW component is the amplifier, which has anyway received quite 
limited attention. The first example of an SIW amplifier, proposed in [82], was op-
erating in the X band and was based on two SIW-to-microstrip transitions, with a 
single transistor amplifier mounted on the microstrip line. In the SIW-to-microstrip 
transitions, printed interdigital capacitors were adopted both as DC blocks and to

Substrate Integrated Waveguide (SIW) 
improve the impedance matching. Measurements demonstrated a gain of 10 dB 
with less than 2 dB of ripple. 
A different configuration was proposed in [83] for a power amplifier operating 
in the frequency range 3.7–4.2 GHz: the combination of a low-impedance micro-
strip line and a short-circuited SIW structure were adopted to suppress the second 
and third harmonics in the power amplifier, thus improving its efficiency. 
The combination of half-mode SIW power dividers and amplifiers was exploit-
ed in [84] to demonstrate a Ka-band amplifier based on spatial power combining. 
The structure is based on a two way SIW to HMSIW power divider: in each of the 
HMSIW branches there are four SIW-to-microstrip transitions, thus permitting to 
connect eight amplifiers and effectively resulting in an 8-way power divider. This 
amplifier features a small-signal gain of 19.5 dB and a saturated output power of 
30.6 dBm. The measured power combining efficiency of the amplifier was 72%. 
9.6.3  Antennas
Radiation from SIW structures can be obtained essentially in two main ways: the 
first technique, named the SIW slot array antenna, consists in etching slots in the 
top metal surface of the SIW structure (Figure 9.30(a)); in the second technique, 
named the SIW leaky-wave antenna, radiation is obtained by increasing the longi-
tudinal spacing s of the side-wall metal cylinders (Figure 9.30(b)). 
Slotted SIW Antennas 
SIW slot array antennas look very similar to classical slotted-waveguide antennas, 
where a number of longitudinal resonant slots are etched in the broad wall of the 
waveguide (Figure 9.30(a)). The longitudinal spacing of the slots is usually half 
guided-wavelength and the slots are alternatively positioned, slightly offset from 
the vertical symmetry plane: this topology permits to feed the radiating slots with 
the proper amplitude and phase for broadside radiation at the desired operation 
frequency [85]. SIW slot arrays can be designed by adopting the method developed 
by Elliot [86], taking care to include the effects of internal high-order mode cou-
pling: in fact, this coupling mechanism cannot be ignored in SIW structures, since 
the substrate thickness is usually much smaller than the SIW width. Circular polari-
zation is obtained by alternate rotation of slots by +45°/-45° [87]. 
While most of SIW slot antennas have been designed and fabricated in the mi-
crowave frequency range (e.g., at 10 GHz in [85] and at 24 GHz in [79]), a single 
slot SIW antenna operating at 94 GHz was demonstrated in [88] and a double slot 
antenna operating at 60 GHz was reported in [89]. Compared to the correspond-
ing antennas in classical waveguide technology, SIW slot arrays exhibit significant 
advantages in terms of reduced weight and cost. Conversely, gain and antenna 
efficiency in SIW slot arrays are worse than in classical slotted waveguide arrays, 
especially due to dielectric loss. 

Microstrip Lines and Slotlines

SIW based array feed networks 
In most cases, an array antenna consists of several rows of slots (i.e., slotted SIW 
structures), located next to each other, and fed by a power divider, realized either 
in microstrip line [85] or in SIW technology [79]. This solution permits to obtain 
similar directivity in the two principal planes of the radiation pattern. 
Several feeding networks have been proposed and implemented to achieve 
scanned-beam or multiple-beam SIW slot array antennas: by properly selecting 
the input port, these feeding networks allow to modify the amplitude and phase of 
each row of slots, thus scanning the direction of maximum radiation. An attractive 
solution used to generate multi-beam antennas is the Rotman lens, which features 
a simple design and compact size [90]: a Rotman lens with seven input ports and 
nine outputs was implemented at 28.5 GHz to scan the beam to seven different 
directions. A Blass matrix based on SIW technology, operating at 16 GHz, was 
proposed in [91]: this feeding network consists of a double-layer structure, with a 
matrix of 4 × 16 cross couplers. Compared with the conventional waveguide imple-
mentation, the Blass matrix in SIW technology features several advantages, includ-
ing lower cost, easier fabrication and low profile. The SIW implementation of the 
Butler matrix was proposed in [92–93]: this matrix comprises 90° hybrid couplers, 
cross couplers, phase shifters and power splitters, and is based on a standard single-
layer printed circuit board process, which is particularly cost effective and suitable 
for mass production. The Nolen matrix was also proposed in SIW technology: it 
is a special case of the Blass matrix, where the termination loads are suppressed. 
A 4×4 Nolen matrix beam-forming network operating at 12.5 GHz was proposed 
in [94]. 
Leaky-Wave SIW Antennas 
Leaky-wave SIW antennas are straight SIW structures, with increased longitudi-
nal spacing in one row of side-wall metal cylinders and located near the edge of 
the dielectric substrate (Figure 9.30(b)) [95]. These antennas exploit the radiation 
leakage due to the sufficiently large gaps between the side-wall metal cylinders. 
The radiation leakage increases if the gaps are large, and this permits to reduce the 
overall length of the leaky-wave antenna at the cost of large beamwidth. Nonethe-
less, large gaps may lead to band-gap effects, which prevent the propagation of the 
electromagnetic field inside the SIW and reduce the operation bandwidth of the an-
tenna. In leaky-wave SIW antennas, the direction of maximum radiation depends 
on the propagation constant of the waveguide mode, and the radiation pattern can 
be computed from the value of the electromagnetic field at the edge of the SIW 
structure. One of the major issues in the design of leaky-wave SIW antennas is re-
lated to the field reflection at the interface between dielectric and air: a maximum 
value of allowed dielectric permittivity can be calculated, which prevents total in-
ternal reflection at the dielectric/air interface [95]. 
A leaky-wave SIW antenna based on the second (quasi TE20) mode of the SIW 
structure was proposed in [96]: this antenna topology features a particular feed 
system to excite the second SIW mode and provides better performance compared 

552
Substrate Integrated Waveguide (SIW) 
to the classical leaky-wave antenna based on the fundamental mode of the SIW 
structure. 
Other SIW Antenna Topologies 
Besides the two major SIW antenna categories (namely, the slotted waveguide array 
and the leaky-wave antenna), other antenna configurations have been proposed for 
implementation in SIW technology. 
The dual V-type linearly tapered slot antenna [97] represents a modified ver-
sion of the Vivaldi antenna. Due to its multimode SIW feeding network, this struc-
ture is able to generate both the sum and difference beams, and for this reason it is 
particularly suitable for monopulse antenna applications. 
Several topologies of cavity-backed SIW antennas have been also developed 
[98-100]. The structure proposed in [98] is very simple: it consists of an SIW cavity, 
fed by a coplanar waveguide etched on one side of the substrate, with a rectangular 
slot located on the opposite side. A more compact solution was proposed in [99], 
where the rectangular slot is replaced by a meander line. A Ku-band SIW cavity-
backed antenna array was developed in [100]: this antenna consists of a 2 × 2 ar-
ray of metal patches, backed by SIW cavities. The structure was implemented by 
adopting a double layer PCB fabrication process, with the metal patches fed by a 
microstrip feeding line in the top layer, and SIW cavities in the bottom layer. This 
solution guarantees a relatively high aperture efficiency of 70% over a reasonably 
wide bandwidth (9%), and a front-to-back ratio of 20 dB. 
Active SIW cavity backed antennas were also developed, by integrating a tran-
sistor oscillator in a cavity-backed antenna. The first implementation [101] was 
based on the simple structure proposed in [98], where the gate of the transistor is 
connected to the input coplanar waveguide of the antenna. In this configurations, 
the role of the SIW cavity is twofold: it is used as a feedback by the transistor, with 
a beneficial effect on the phase noise of the oscillator, and simultaneously it permits 
to improve the slot antenna performance, by suppressing the excitation of surface 
waves. A more compact version of active SIW cavity backed antenna was proposed 
in [102], where the entire circuitry is located on top of the SIW cavity, thus permit-
ting the implementation of two dimensional arrays. 
An H-plane sectoral horn antenna in SIW technology was proposed in [103]. 
The flares of the horn are realized by using metal vias, and a dielectric loading, 
integrated in the same substrate, allows high gain and narrow beam-widths in both 
the E- and H-plane. 
The concept of the Yagi-Uda antenna has been exploited to develop SIW anten-
nas. The first version [104] consists of a truncated SIW structure, with an additional 
row of metal cylinders axially aligned in front of the aperture to act as the directors 
of a Yagi-Uda antenna. A prototype operating at 60 GHz was demonstrated, with 
a gain of 12 dB. Another version was proposed in [105] and consists of a stacked 
multilayer array, resulting in a very small footprint of the entire geometry. 
Finally, frequency selective surfaces (FSS) and polarizers have been developed 
[106–108], based on the characteristics of SIW technology: they are components 
strictly related to antennas, both for the operation principle and for their applica-
tions. These structures consist of a planar periodic array of SIW cavities, connected 

Microstrip Lines and Slotlines

to the exterior through properly designed coupling slots. The FSS selectivity de-
pends both on the coupling slots and on the resonant mode of the SIW cavity. 
9.6.4  System-on-Substrate (SoS)
The previous sections highlighted the possibility to apply SIW technology to the 
development of a variety of passive and active components, as well as of antennas 
and arrays. They also discussed the option to easily interconnect SIW components 
to microstrip and CPW circuits, realized on the same dielectric substrate. These 
possibilities open interesting perspectives for the implementation of complete sys-
tems on a single substrate: in this way, the concept of the System-in-Package (SiP),

554
Substrate Integrated Waveguide (SIW) 
widely adopted in the design of RF and microwave circuits, can be extended and 
gradually replaced by the paradigm of the System-on-Substrate (SoS) [109]. 
There are two major methodologies for the deployment and integration of SoS. 
A flexible and compact approach consists in the development of all components 
and antennas on one single substrate, by combining SIW and microstrip or CPW 
technologies (Figure 9.31(a)). This approach permits to exploit the advantages of 
SIW as well as of other planar technologies that can be efficiently integrated in 
the same substrate. The complete front-end of a 24 GHz frequency-modulation 
continuous-wave (FMCW) radar based on SoS approach was presented in [79]. 
The circuit (shown in Figure 9.31(a)) integrates on the same substrate several build-
ing blocks, including up-converters, down-converters, power dividers, as well as 
one receiving and one transmitting 16-element slotted-wave antenna array. The 
complete radar was fabricated on a RT/Duroid 6002 dielectric substrate with a 
dielectric constant of 2.94 and a thickness of 0.508 mm. The fabrication process 
was similar to standard hybrid MICs fabrication process, commonly used in the 
case of microstrip circuits. First, the sidewalls of the SIW were realized by laser 
cutting, and subsequently the metallization of cut-through sidewalls was made by 
sputtering a thin copper layer on them followed by electroplating. Finally, standard 
photolithography process was used to define the microstrip pattern. 
The other methodology for the deployment of SoS is based on the use of multi-
chip modules, which are mounted on SIW circuits. In this case, the active portion 
of the circuit or even the complete front-end are integrated in the chipset, whereas 
some specific components, like selective filters, low-loss interconnects, and direc-
tive antennas, are implemented off-chip in SIW technology (Figure 9.31(b)). This 
methodology allows a simplification of the design, while exploiting the features of 
SIW technology for those components which cannot be efficiently integrated in a 
chipset. A 60 GHz receiver based on multi-chip modules in GaAs technology was 
proposed in [110]. The receiver chain (shown in Figure 9.31(b)) integrates a slotted 
waveguide antenna connected to a cavity filter, followed by an SIW-to-microstrip 
transition and two MMICs (a three-stage low-noise amplifier and a 90° balanced 
diode mixer with IF amplifier), fabricated in pHEMT technology.

The SoS concept represents the ideal platform for developing cost-effective, 
easy-to-fabricate and high-performance mm-wave systems. In fact, in the imple-
mentation of SoS there is no need of complex transitions between components 
fabricated by different technologies (e.g., metallic rectangular waveguide and mi-
crostrip technology), thus generally achieving lower losses and broader bandwidth. 
This improvement is particularly significant when operating at mm-wave frequen-
cies. Moreover, SIW circuits and systems are completely shielded: this feature pre-
vents radiation leakage and spurious undesired coupling between adjacent systems. 
In addition, this approach avoids the need of packaging, thus reducing the overall 
system cost and development effort. 
9.7	
Fabrication Technologies and Materials
The large majority of SIW components and circuits have been developed in the 
frequency range from 3 GHz to 30 GHz, with some examples up to 60 or 90 GHz 
and very limited implementations above 100 GHz. At low frequencies (below 3 
GHz), the size of the SIW structures becomes large, as it is related to the operation 
wavelength. Moreover, in this frequency range where typical losses are relatively 
low, the advantage of SIW over microstrip line and CPW circuits is less significant. 
At high frequencies, fabrication tolerances become prohibitively strict and losses 
spoil the performance of the circuits; therefore, special care in the selection of the 
materials and sophisticate fabrication technologies are required. 
9.7.1  Fabrication by PCB and LTCC Technologies
The most common fabrication technology used for implementing SIW structures 
has been the printed circuit board (PCB) technique, which is also widely adopted

for manufacturing microstrip line and CPW circuits. Plastic and ceramic dielectric 
substrates typically used for microstrip circuits can be adopted also for the develop-
ment of SIW components. In the early versions of SIW components, the holes were 
perforated by a drilling machine and the metal vias were implemented by using metal 
rivets (Figure 9.32). More recently, the metalized holes have been usually obtained 
either by micro-drilling or laser cutting, and their metallization is subsequently per-
formed by metal plating or by filling the holes by a conductive paste. 
PCB fabrication is a conventional and widely proven manufacturing process, 
often available in small companies and research laboratories. It exhibits several 
advantages, including low costs and good design flexibility. In addition, it allows 
to implement both SIW and standard printed circuits on the same substrate, thus 
permitting the integration of the complete systems according to the SoS approach 
[109]. 
Besides PCB fabrication, low-temperature co-fired ceramic (LTCC) technology 
is particularly suitable for the implementation of SIW components and antennas. 
The possibility of using several layers represents an interesting opportunity to re-
duce the footprint of SIW components, for instance by stacking or folding the cavi-
ties of SIW filters [53–54]. 
9.7.2  Integration of SIW on Silicon 
Micro-machined, silicon-based SIW structures were developed for application in 
the mm-wave frequency range [111]. In these structures, benzocyclobutene (BCB) 
polymer filled into a deep etched silicon cavity is used as a dielectric substrate, and 
the via structures are realized with metal-coated silicon columns. This fabrication 
technique is particularly interesting for the potential integration of the SIW struc-
tures with silicon-based circuits or RF MEMS devices. Straight SIW interconnects 
with CPW-to-SIW transitions were demonstrated (Figure 9.33), with insertion loss 
of 1.4 dB in the frequency range from 25 to 40 GHz. 
9.7.3  Use of Novel Substrate Materials
The use of novel materials and technologies has been investigated for the imple-
mentation of low-cost and flexible SIW structures. In particular, the use of a flexible 
plastic substrate was proposed [112] for the implementation of an SIW-based slot 
array antenna operating at 79 GHz (Figure 9.34(a)). The prototypes were fabri-
cated in a polyimide flex foil using a PCB fabrication process. The manufacturing 
steps needed to form the metal vias are based on ion track technology: as the first 
step, Kapton foils are treated by irradiation with heavy ions and subsequent by wet 
etching. The ions determine tracks in the material, and these tracks are selectively 
etched to create pores. In the final step, the surface of the foil is irradiated and 
etched, and the pores perforate the whole thickness of the foil. As shown in Figure 
9.34(b), the flexibility of this substrate opens interesting perspectives for its ap-
plications in the development of conformal circuits and antennas such as wearable 
antennas. 
Recent studies have demonstrated the possibility of using the photographic 
paper for microwave circuit applications, where conductive strips are realized by 

558
Substrate Integrated Waveguide (SIW) 
ink-jet printing [113], through the use of silver micro-particles in suspension in 
the ink. The use of paper allows low fabrication costs of microwave circuits, and 
the proposed manufacturing technology is fully eco-friendly in the entire life cycle 
of the circuit, both during the manufacturing of the components (as it avoids the 
use of acids typically adopted in chemical etching) and at the time of disposal, at 
the end of the life time of the device (since paper is rapidly bio-degradable). SIW 
interconnects and components based on inkjet-printed paper substrates was dem-
onstrated in [113], in the frequency range around 5 GHz: the example of an SIW 
filter on paper is shown in Figure 9.34(a). In the fabrication of SIW structures, the 
via holes were perforated by a laser and were filled by thin wires and sealed by con-
ductive epoxy, to prevent possible radiation leakage. While losses are still an issue 
for SIW components on papers, significant improvements of the electromagnetic 
properties of paper substrates are expected in the next few years and the use of 
paper for microwave applications may become popular. 
Another unconventional material, which is receiving attention for microwave 
applications and specifically for SIW implementation, is represented by textile fab-
rics. The implementation of SIW antennas entirely fabricated from textile materials 
was firstly proposed in [114], for application in wearable systems. The structure, 
shown in Figure 9.34(c), consists of a cavity-backed slot antenna operating in the 
2.45 GHz industrial, scientific and medical band, for short range communication 
between rescue workers. The SIW textile antenna was assembled by gluing two 
conductive fabrics onto the textile substrate by means of adhesive sheets. The struc-
ture was perforated to implement the via holes and, finally, eyelets were fixed in 
the holes. This solution permits to preserve the flexibility of the substrate. A pro-
totype of the antenna was demonstrate in [114]: good performance was obtained 
in terms of input matching and radiation pattern. Moreover, measurements per-
formed on the antenna after bending and integration into clothing indicate high 
robustness against deformation and low influence of the human body on antenna 
performance, making the design well-suited for on-body use.

9.7.4  Solutions for High Frequency Operation of SIW
The use of SIW structures at high frequency has to face several issues, related to 
the increased impact of losses, to manufacturing inaccuracies, and technological 
constraints. 
To partially overcome these limitations, a modified topology of SIW metal 
vias can be adopted. As widely discussed in this Chapter, SIW structures are usu-
ally based on two rows of cylindrical metal vias, which define the side walls of 
the waveguide (Figure 9.1). When operating at high frequency, however, the high-
quality realization of metalized via holes and their small longitudinal spacing are 
difficult to accomplish using existing precision machining processes. To improve 
the quality of SIW structures at frequency higher than 60 GHz, the rows of cylin-
drical metal vias can be replaced by metalized slots that are easier to implement. 
An example is reported in [115], where a W-band hybrid coupler and a multiport 
circuit have been implemented in SIW technology, based on metal slots instead of 
cylinders 
Sophisticate technologies have also been applied to overcome the technological is-
sues. At frequencies higher than 100 GHz, SIW components have been fabricated 
by using photo image-able thick-film technology [57], which guarantees excellent 
dimension tolerance and low dielectric loss. The fabrication is based on the follow-
ing steps: at the beginning, a uniform metal layer is printed on an alumina substrate 
to define the bottom wall of the SIW structure. Subsequently, a dielectric layer with 
10-mm thickness is printed on the metallic bottom, and a photo-imaging process is 
adopted to define the SIW sidewalls. This step is repeated until the required sub-
strate thickness is achieved. As a last step, a metal layer is deposited to form the 
upper wall of the SIW structure. SIW filters operating at 180 GHz were fabricated 
by using this technology and experimentally verified in [57].

Engineers (IEEE), a member of the Education Committee of IEEE MTT-S, and a 
founding member of the Topical Group MAGEO (Microwaves in Agriculture, Envi-
ronment, and Earth Observation) of the European Microwave Association (EuMA). 
He was the general chair of the IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Workshop 
Series on Millimeter Wave Integration Technologies in 2011. He was the leader of 
the focus area on “Substrate Integrated Waveguide (SIW) Technology” in the frame-
work of the COST Action IC0803 “RF/Microwave Communication Subsystems for 
Emerging Wireless Technologies.”
Professor Bozzi was the recipient of the Best Young Scientist Paper Award at 
the XXVII General Assembly of the International Union of Radio Science (URSI) 
in 2002, of an URSI Young Scientist Award, and of the MECSA Prize for the best 
paper presented by a young researcher at the Italian Conference on Electromagnet-
ics (XIII RINEM) in 2000. He was also the co-recipient of the EUCAP 2010 Best 
Student Paper Award and the ACES 2010 2nd Best Student Paper Award.
