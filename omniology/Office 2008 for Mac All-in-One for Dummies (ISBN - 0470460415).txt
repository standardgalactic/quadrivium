Authors’ Acknowledgments
We thank the divine, and other mere mortals with divine abilities.
Special thanks to everyone at Wiley for helping us put this book together. 
Acquisitions editor Kyle Looper and project editor Mark Enochs kept every-
thing on track. Thanks go to the editorial team, including copy editors Jen 
Riggs and John Edwards, and technical editor James Russell.
Thanks go to our families and friends for allowing us to focus on our writing 
without deserting us. We express our appreciation to them all.
Geetesh wishes to thank his offi ce staff who helped him take the time off to 
write this book as well as the amazing bunch of other Microsoft MVPs who 
are too numerous to be listed here.
Jim wishes to extend special thanks to the University at Buffalo for allowing 
leave to work on the book. The University at Buffalo is truly one of the best 
places to work or attend.
We thank the Macintosh Business Unit of Microsoft, who created the subject 
matter of the book, and Microsoft Corporation for the awesome MVP program,

friendly, helpful way.
About This Book
We start with all the basic information that you’d expect, such as a look at 
the interface and options. We then go beyond the basics, providing you with 
new, quicker ways to do what you do all the time and helping you discover 
valuable tools that you may have been unaware of.
This book is organized as a series of self-contained minibooks, with each 
one focusing on a particular application or component in Office 2008. 
You’ll discover that the tricks you use in one application can be used in 
other Office applications as well. In addition, the valuable Cheat Sheet can 
be downloaded from the Web site (www.dummies.com/cheatsheet/
office2008formacaio) and printed out to be used as a portable refer-
ence for shortcuts and common tasks.

About This Book
We realize that some might have worked in one of the various versions of 
Microsoft Office for Windows. Throughout this book, we endeavor to high-
light Office features that are available only on the Mac. We don’t do that to 
make Windows users go green with envy; our reasons are infinitely nobler. In 
fact, we highlight these differences for several reasons:
 
✦ Mac owners might not be aware that Office 2008 for Mac isn’t iden-
tical to the Windows version. Since the earliest versions of Office, 
Microsoft introduced many new features on the Mac long before the fea-
tures were brought to the Windows version. As hardware and operating 
systems have improved, Microsoft has updated the Mac version of Office 
to incorporate new functionality, speed, file sharing, document delivery, 
and file formats. Microsoft’s Macintosh Business Unit (or MacBU) is proud 
of this fact and strives to continue to bring new features to its Macintosh 
customers.
 
✦ Mac users need to be aware that if they use Office for Windows, some 
features used every day simply aren’t on the Windows platform. The 
topics in this book with Mac Only indicators have no equivalents in 
Windows Office.
 
✦ We provide help for the many people who have recently switched 
from Windows to Mac OS X. Such users may find comfort in the fact 
that most of the options in Microsoft Office applications, such as Word, 
Excel, and PowerPoint, work in the same way on both the Windows and 
Macintosh platforms. However, the Mac operating system has features 
not found in Windows. MacBU often incorporates Mac OS X–specific 
features wherever they make sense in Office for Mac. Many times such 
features have no equivalent on the Windows version of Microsoft Office.
 
✦ All the content in this book is very important for users who work on 
both Windows and Macintosh versions of Office. Nowadays, a lot of 
businesses use both Macintosh and Windows computers. Maybe you 
use a Windows computer at work and a Macintosh at home. Or maybe 
you have a Macintosh that dual boots to Windows. Indeed, we’ve often 
worked in situations stranger than this! The world is changing so fast — 
who knows what will happen next? But for now and the near future, this 
book has you covered!
The success of Office for Mac is due to Microsoft’s continuous process of 
innovation. As hardware and operating systems improve, Microsoft updates 
the Mac version of Office to incorporate new functionality, speed, file shar-
ing, document delivery, and file formats. Competition keeps MacBU on its 
toes. Apple has iWork, Google has Google Apps, and Sun has OpenOffice. 
With such strong competition from several other products in word proces-
sors, Microsoft has continued to innovate and provide a product that Mac 
users want to use over competing products. That in itself is no average 
achievement.

How This Book Is Organized
How to Use This Book
This book has basic and in-depth information organized by major applica-
tions in Microsoft Office. Turn to the Table of Contents or the index to get 
right to the information on a specific topic. However, that doesn’t mean that 
we discourage you from reading cover to cover; you just don’t have to!
Throughout this book, you see step-by-step instructions, which are based 
on Mac OS X version 10.5 Leopard. If you’re using 10.4 Tiger (or 10.6 Snow 
Leopard), some of our steps that involve using Mac OS X Finder may not 
match your screen. But don’t worry; these changes are small, and you 
shouldn’t have any problems following any of these steps.
How This Book Is Organized
Each of the six minibooks in Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac All-in-One For 
Dummies stands alone. We start with a general introduction to Office 2008 
and then move on to the big applications you’ll use the most. The following 
sections provide an overview of each minibook.
Book I: Introducing Office 2008
Many tools and features are common to all or more than one of the Office 
applications. For example, pictures, charts, and diagrams work in exactly 
the same way across the applications. Rather than repeat these common 
features for each application, we save you time, pages, and book weight by 
covering these in depth in the first part of the book.
Book II: Word 2008
In this minibook, we show you how you can use Word’s amazing capabili-
ties to do everything from writing letters to printing envelopes. On the way, 
you’ll discover how to mail merge hundreds of documents and format your 
fonts. We also show you how you create newsletters in Word and make notes 
of your meetings, including audio notes! Have fun.
Book III: Excel 2008
The Excel minibook is chock-a-block full of interesting stuff you can do with 
this program. We cover all the basics and then show you how to do some 
advanced stuff with easy step-by-step instructions. We also show you how to 
go on a journey of cell hopping, and look at data validation, lists, forms, and 
charts. Truly mesmerizing, numeric stuff!

Conventions Used in This Book
Book IV: PowerPoint 2008
Okay, this is the minibook that lets you enjoy yourself and work at the same 
time, and then get paid for it, too! Figure out how you can use PowerPoint 
basics to create structured presentations and then add the pizzazz with the 
umpteen new options that Microsoft bestowed upon this latest version of 
PowerPoint.
Book V: Entourage 2008
So do you e-mail? And do you need a place to store your contacts and orga-
nize your calendar? Then you need Entourage, and this minibook covers 
more ground on this program than you’ll find anywhere else. Determine how 
you can set up your e-mail accounts; invite others to events you organize; 
and use the cool, new My Day feature.
Book VI: Entourage’s Project Center
Wouldn’t it be nice to have someone manage your projects and all the 
paraphernalia associated with those projects? Entourage’s Project Center 
is even better than that, and this minibook shows you how you can create, 
implement, and share projects. You also read about how you can integrate 
these projects with other programs on your Mac including Word, Excel, and 
PowerPoint.
Bonus Chapters
Don’t forget to check out the book’s Web site at www.dummies.com/go/
office2008formacaiofd for two bonus chapters. Bonus Chapter 1 
looks ahead to the next version of Office for Mac while Bonus Chapter 2 
covers new features in Service Pack 2, such as Document Connection and 
PowerPoint path animations.
Conventions Used in This Book
For Dummies books are accessible and easy to read, but sometimes you have 
to type commands and click menu items. To keep these actions as simple as 
possible, we have some conventions to indicate what needs to be done or 
what you might see onscreen.
Stuff you type
We use bold to tell you what to type. For example, if we say, “Type 22 and 
then press the Return key on your keyboard,” type the number 22 and then 
immediately press the Return key. (Remember, you must always press the 
Return key to process the command or enter text.)

5
Icons Used in This Book
Menu commands
When we give you a specific set of menu commands to use, it appears like 
this: Choose File➪Send To➪Microsoft Word. In this example, click the File 
menu, choose the Send To item, and then choose the Microsoft Word option 
in the submenu.
Key combinations
With keyboard commands, press two or more keys in sequence, hold down 
each key until all the keys in the sequence have been pressed, and then you 
release all the keys. We use the hyphen sign (–) to chain together these com-
binations. Press Shift-Ô-3 means to hold down the Shift key, then the Ô key, 
and then the number 3 key. (Incidentally, if you do that, a picture of your cur-
rent screen will be saved to your computer’s Desktop.)
Note: On a Mac, the Ô key and the Ú key are the exact same key on your 
keyboard. Your keyboard may have either of these symbols or both on this 
key, which is usually located next to the spacebar. We use the newer Ô 
symbol throughout this book.
Right-click versus Control-click
Applications for the Mac use context-sensitive pop-up menus extensively. 
To see a context-sensitive menu, hold down the Control key and click some-
thing. And yes, for those wondering, right-clicking and Control-clicking do 
exactly the same thing.
Display messages
Whenever we mention a message or any text that you see onscreen, it appears 
like this: This message is displayed by an Office application.
Icons Used in This Book
The icons in this book are important visual cues for information you might 
not want to miss.
 
This icon indicates special timesaving advice and other items of note.
 
This icon alerts you to pay close attention because every once in a while we 
might discuss a topic that could cause problems.

Where to Go from Here
 
Of course, we expect you to remember everything you read in this book. 
You’ll have to take part in a written exam that’s held twice a year in 265 
cities across the world, and we read every single paper you write. Just kid-
ding! We use this icon to point out important info for you to keep in mind.
 
We know. Sometimes things can get pretty complicated. We use this icon 
when we’ve taken extra care to simplify something we think most users 
might find daunting. Just keep in mind that this information is optional and 
isn’t critical to your understanding of the topic. We still provide all the nec-
essary how-to coverage for the application features you need to know about.
 
Microsoft doesn’t keep the Windows and Macintosh versions of Office in lock 
step with each other. Several excellent features of Office are available only in 
the Macintosh version. If you’re new to the Mac and are already familiar with 
the Windows version of Office, look for this icon to help you identify features 
that may be new to you.
 
Like every new release of Office, Office 2008 has introduced several amazing 
features that make working with the Office programs easier and more intui-
tive. This icon highlights these new features in Office 2008.
Where to Go from Here
Start reading this book in any minibook, chapter, or even section. You can 
dive in anywhere to get the info you need. When appropriate, we add cross-
references to other parts of the book for more information.
The first place to find information (aside from this wonderful book) is to 
look in Office Help, which is completely new. Throughout the book, we also 
mention additional resources for help. Many of the resources are Web pages 
created and maintained by Microsoft MVPs, Most Valuable Professionals. 
The MVP program was established by Microsoft to highlight “a worldwide 
network of exceptional technical community leaders,” according to the 
Microsoft MVP Web site at http://mvp.support.microsoft.com.
We’ve received MVP awards for many years, including 2009. We encourage 
you to participate in online communities and user groups. People who regu-
larly contribute high-quality information to the technical community may 
eventually become candidates to receive MVP distinction.
When you come across MVP-supplied content on the Web, be assured that 
it’s reliable. MVPs are volunteers. MVPs don’t receive compensation from 
Microsoft and are independent from Microsoft Corporation.

Chapter 1: Oscillating in 
the Office 2008 World
In This Chapter
✓ Meeting the suite
✓ Exploring individual applications
✓ Discovering new features in Office 2008
✓ Comparing Office for Mac with Windows Office
✓ Dealing with Office automation
✓ Running Office 2004 and Office 2008 together
L
ike most people, you might already be exposed to Microsoft Office in 
some way, or perhaps you just got started with this suite of business 
programs from Microsoft. Either way, be prepared to go on a journey of 
discovery through this book as we show you how you can work better with 
Office 2008 for Mac.
You might already know that Microsoft Office can do umpteen things, but 
maybe you don’t know where to find those umpteen things! That’s where 
the good news starts for Microsoft Office 2008 users. The new Project 
Gallery, which we explain in Chapter 2 of this minibook, makes Office far 
less intimidating by showing you at a glance all the things you can do.
You might have heard about the changes to Office file formats; we show you 
how easy it is to work with old and new formats. Getting along with users 
of other Office versions on Mac and Windows is very easy with Office 2008. 
Although we still can’t say that Office for Mac has every feature available in 
Office for Windows, you won’t want to live without some of the compelling 
Mac-only Office features.
Fascinatingly, the latest Mac version of Microsoft Office retains Office 2004’s 
familiar menus and interface. For example, although the Windows version 
exposes not-so-conspicuous Office 2007 features to Windows users via the 
new Ribbon interface, Office for Mac solved the same problem years ago by 
introducing floating context-sensitive palettes.

10
Getting Familiar with Office 2008
Office 2008 has many galleries and introduces the new Elements Gallery, bor-
rowing some of the better aspects of the Windows Office 2007 Ribbon. We 
cover Elements Gallery in Chapter 3 of this minibook.
Whether you’ve used Office 2004 for Mac or you’re brand new to Office 2008 
for Mac, we address all information in an easy-to-grasp manner so that you 
can understand it. To make sure that we’re all on the same level as far as ter-
minology and concepts go, we start this chapter with an overview of each of 
the Office applications. Office 2008 has exciting new interface improvements, 
new file formats, and some completely new features to discover and get 
acquainted with. You’ll find that Office 2008 brings most of the suite into the 
future with its emphasis on helping you get organized, manage your docu-
ments, create and manage projects, and collaborate by using the very latest 
Web technologies. This is going to be so much fun!
Getting Familiar with Office 2008
Wouldn’t it be great if there were a central place where you could find all 
your favorite wizards, templates, and recently used files as well as oversee 
the projects you’re working on? Wouldn’t you like to see more than just a 
handful of recently used files? How about if the same place had an incredible 
search capability that took advantage of Mac OS X’s Spotlight search?
You can stop dreaming because Office 2008 indeed has just such a place — 
Project Gallery, which is a fantastic way to get started whenever you open an 
Office application, oversee your projects, or find documents.
Getting started in Project Gallery
 
Lots of things are important to everyone. Here’s a quick list of some of 
common goals:
 
✦ Saving time by creating just the right document the first time you do it.
 
✦ Making your work have a consistent look and feel so that you feel good.
 
✦ Having confidence in managing your affairs.
 
✦ Feeling that you can confidently find the documents you need quickly.
 
✦ Finding a way to stop working and start making billions.
Office 2008 makes it easy to achieve everything in that list — except maybe 
the last part about making billions! Project Gallery is a one-stop shop that

allows you to open new or existing documents, projects, and documents 
within a project as well as effectively search for a document even if you can’t 
remember much about it.
Choose File➪Project Gallery to open the Project Gallery window. Figure 1-1 
shows what Project Gallery looks like.

The Project Gallery interface has four tabs: New, Recent, Project Center, and 
Settings. We first look at the New tab.
The New tab
Many moons ago you’d choose File➪New in an Office application to start a 
new document or a spreadsheet. A simple folder structure would display a 
plain blank document option that you could click to start working on a new 
Word document, Excel spreadsheet, or PowerPoint presentation. In addition, 
you’d see folder tabs containing templates and wizards. This same simple 
folder concept is on steroids with Project Gallery. Office 2008 enhances this 
concept by enabling you to see all the Office wizards, templates, recently 
used files, and projects in a single, integrated, well-designed interface.
Figure 1-1:

Gallery in 
Microsoft 
Office 2008.

12
Getting Familiar with Office 2008
Want to start a fresh document from scratch? Click the New tab to display 
a list of all the templates and wizards available to you (refer to Figure 1-1). 
You can access your own templates or your organization’s templates right 
here, too!
 
As you work through this book, you might wonder why some of the figures 
in this book don’t look exactly the same as what you see in your copy of 
Office for Mac. That’s okay. Some interfaces can look different, especially if 
you have a custom installation of Office that didn’t use the default installa-
tion options. Don’t worry. This book still covers all the features you’ll need 
to know about.
 
New in Office 2008, Project Gallery allows you to start a blank document 
based on a style or a theme. As you’d expect, you can use the new styles 
and themes provided with Office 2008, or you can use your own saved 
themes and styles. And if you don’t know much about themes and styles, no 
problem — we cover how to apply themes and styles in Word, Excel, and 
PowerPoint and even explain how to create your own custom themes and 
styles throughout this book.
The Recent tab
Looking for a recently used file? Click the Recent tab, as shown in Figure 1-2. 
A list of recently opened documents appears. You can set the number of 
recently used files to be displayed to 100 if you want, though that’s prob-
ably not the most efficient use of the feature. You can also filter documents 
by application. Office 2008 includes an amazing new search feature based 
on Spotlight, the Mac built-in search technology. Many of the Recent tab 
options, such as the number of recently opened documents, have to be 
selected in the Settings tab of Project Gallery. More on that shortly.
The Project Center tab
Click the Project Center tab of Project Gallery to instantly access documents 
associated with projects created with Project Center (see Figure 1-3). Project 
Center documents can be any kind of document, not just Office documents. 
Pictures, e-mail, PDFs, movies, MP3s, PowerPoint presentations, you name it! 
They’re all fair game for Project Center.
In Figure 1-3, you see an empty Project Center tab. Don’t panic if your 
Project Center looks like this. An empty Project Center tab merely means 
that you haven’t created any new projects in it!

The final tab of Project Gallery is the Settings tab, and true to its name, this 
tab is the place to control various settings for the other three tabs in Project 
Gallery. Heck, this tab also lets you decide whether you want Project Gallery 
to open when you launch any Microsoft Office application. Figure 1-4 shows

Helping Word veterans make the transition
Great software is like a fine wine. Software comes in vintages (or versions), 
some of which are appreciated by computer users the way wine is appreci-
ated by connoisseurs. When an experienced user uncorks Word 2008, the 
bouquet has new elements and familiar scents. Here are some of the new 
improvements:
 
✦ Themes: Word’s old themes were getting stale. But new themes and 
the ability to use those themes in Excel and PowerPoint are definite 
improvements in Word 2008.
 
✦ Styles: You can use Word styles throughout the Microsoft Office suite.

✦ Elements Gallery: The new Elements Gallery enhances your ability to 
apply designs, add elements, and apply formatting styles.
 
✦ Draw: A new drawing engine that encompasses new graphs, organiza-
tion charts, WordArt, and drawing tools for enhanced appearance. Also 
adds the new SmartArt graphics to show logical relationships.
 
✦ AppleScript: The sweetest AppleScript automation ever. AppleScript 
dictionary updates are included as well as completely new support for 
Automator Actions so that you can automate common workflows.
 
✦ Mail Merge Manager: We think the 2008 version of Mail Merge Manager 
is the best ever, Mac or PC, because you can control everything from a 
single palette and merging to e-mail works so well.
 
✦ XML file format: This is a new default file format that’s based on XML 
(eXtensible Markup Language), which is based on the file format that 
was introduced with Office 2007 for Windows. The default file format 
for Office 2007 (Windows) and Office 2008 (Mac) is identical. The XML 
format is new compared to Office 2003 (Windows) and Mac (2004).
Did Microsoft achieve its goal of creating a better version of Word in 
Word 2008? Depending on how you use Word, the answer veers between 
perhaps and certainly. Word 2008 is certainly an excellent version despite 
not having VBA.
Exploring all that Microsoft Word has to offer can be satisfying. We help you 
discover the nice, new nuances of tables, styles, graphs, charts, and sharing 
on the Web.
Looking for Visual Basic for Applications (VBA)
Alas, an ingredient is missing from Microsoft Office 2008 that some can’t do 
without: Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). VBA is a programming language 
that’s been built into Microsoft Office for both Mac and Windows since the last 
few versions, and it lets geeks program and integrate Microsoft Office applica-
tions in amazing ways, such as in automating everyday tasks. Unfortunately, 
VBA was left out when Microsoft Office 2008 was being created. As we write 
this book, Microsoft is busy adding it in so that the next version of Office for 
Mac will have this complex enhancement restored. For those who must have 
VBA, Office 2004 will have to do until the next version of Office.
De-mystifying Excel
If Word is like a fine wine, Microsoft Excel is like having a super bright, 
quiet, know-it all kid around. Excel sits waiting quietly for someone to ask it 
to do something, but far too often people are afraid to give it a task. That’s 
because lots of users just find Excel too scary with all its neatly arranged 
cells and numbers!

16
Getting Familiar with Office 2008
Excel 2008 banishes the scary stuff by making huge improvements in the 
interface.
You don’t have to be an accountant or an engineer to use Excel 2008. Excel 
2008 doesn’t act like a brat, either. Book III is all about Excel; there you’ll 
figure out how to make good use of easy-to-use features, such as the List 
Wizard, budget and finance tools, and even travel tools.
Even experienced Excel users tend to get comfortable with one or two 
Excel features and then hesitate to explore additional uses. That’s a shame 
because Excel can do a lot with just a small amount of effort.
Among the top reasons for people to use Excel is to manage lists. Excel 2008 
makes it easy to arrange data into rows and columns. Using mailing lists as 
data sources for Word mail merge is easy. Excel is great because it’s simple 
to sort data alphabetically and numerically. You can instantly sort a list of 
thousands alphabetically or by postal code. Excel doesn’t care if your list 
is just a few rows, a thousand, or even a million rows; Excel’s just happy to 
crunch those numbers and to arrange the alphabet for you.
Having an easy tool to use is always a good thing, and Excel 2008 offers a lot 
of new and improved features, as well as old favorites:
 
✦ List Manager: In Excel, List Manager helps you create, organize, main-
tain, and update your lists. With a few mouse clicks, you can use List 
Manager to help you locate records, count the number of entries, and 
even do fancy mathematics on data within your lists. If you want to use 
List Manager straightaway, navigate to Book III.
 
✦ Themes and styles: Whatever your area of work, organizing data in lists 
is important, as is how polished your data looks when it’s presented. 
Both onscreen and when printed, Excel is a champ at presenting data 
in useful ways. Excel 2008 has support for new office-wide themes and 
styles (except for font styles) much like Word 2008 and PowerPoint 2008 
so that you can easily create great looking reports.
 
✦ Ledger sheets: Keeping track of business activities is easier now with 
brand-new Mac-only ledger sheet Excel worksheets. We explore this 
new feature along with all the other features we discuss here in Book III, 
Chapter 1.
 
✦ Graphical reports: Now for some more Excel-lent stuff related to all the 
data present in your Excel spreadsheets. You don’t have to wonder how 
to make a good impression with your data. Data analysis is something 
Excel is famous for. Macs are noted for ease of use and the best graphics 
around. Put that together in Excel 2008, and you’re making the best year-
end reports ever. Even if the economy tanks, at least your data will look 
great and uplifting. Hopefully, you’ll use Excel to make better forecasts 
than your competition and smoothly sail your company out of a recession.

✦ Graphs and charts: Beautiful expository graphs can be created in Excel 
2008. These can be used in other applications and shared in many 
ways. Researchers and students find that Excel 2008 can help them 
prepare lab reports and display tables and graphs in ways that make 
complex concepts easy to visualize and understand. You can draw fig-
ures and flow charts with new Excel 2008 drawing tools. Enhance your 
reports with pictures and illustrations. You can even include a movie 
to illustrate a point. Excel 2008 has the ability to import data from 
many sources, including other computers, the Internet, networks, and 
co-workers.
 
✦ Forms: The Excel forms go beyond anything that can be created in 
Microsoft Word or Adobe Acrobat. Sure, you can make nice looking 
forms in the other applications, but only Excel can perform logical oper-
ations and calculations, enforce business rules, and carry out complex 
calculations within a form.
 
✦ Database features: Excel has always had extraordinary, though often 
ignored, database features, and sometimes their very existences are 
underplayed for reasons not known to us. If you need fewer than a few 
hundred thousand or so records in a table, Excel may be all you need. 
We go into depth in all things Excel in Book III to show you how to take 
advantage of Excel 2008’s surprisingly complete database capabilities.
 
✦ Document sharing: The documents you create in Excel often need to 
be shared. Excel 2008 has a couple tricks up its sleeve in the sharing 
department, too, such as the ability to do live sharing of a workbook on 
a network. You can save an Excel workbook as a Web page that even 
has working sheet tabs. Sometimes you need to share only part of a 
workbook. We show you simple ways to save a graph or any other part 
of a workbook as a picture. You can send an Excel workbook directly 
from Office via e-mail, Microsoft Messenger, or one of the brand new 
Microsoft file-sharing services.
Whether you need a simple database or a state-of-the-art spreadsheet pro-
gram, Excel is competent for the task. This book is the one place you’re 
likely to find everything you need to take advantage of these tools that Excel 
provides.
Slide shows with PowerPoint
Of all the Office 2008 applications, PowerPoint is probably the most fun to 
use. PowerPoint 2008 comes with lots of interesting templates, and thou-
sands more are available. And you can also create some of your own. All 
you have to do is open a template; mix in your words, pictures, movies, and 
graphs; and you’re well on your way. Because PowerPoint takes care of the 
look and feel, you can productively use the time saved to create a compel-
ling message and story for your presentation. If you have a multimedia mes-
sage to present, PowerPoint 2008 helps you deliver that, too.

18
Getting Familiar with Office 2008
 
When you need to put something together in a hurry, built-in content and 
design templates are at your fingertips. You can build new presentations 
based on old ones very quickly. But don’t forget that no PowerPoint tem-
plate will ever take care of the hard part for you: You still have to refine your 
presentation message all by yourself.
What’s great about PowerPoint is that most people can make truly profes-
sional presentations with very little effort thanks to many new and improved 
features:
 
✦ Presenter tools: Improvements in this area give presenters current time 
information to help them stay on track.
 
✦ Toolbox: The new Toolbox combines the Formatting Palette, Scrapbook, 
Reference Tools, ClipArt, and more into a single palette that saves 
screen real estate. Having everything in one place also lets presenters 
and presentation creators be more efficient while creating better looking 
presentations.
 
✦ Elements Gallery: Formatting your presentations has never been easier. 
With the new Elements Gallery, you can apply slide themes, slide lay-
outs, transitions, new table styles, charts, new SmartArt graphics, and 
WordArt. You can even add your own elements to this Gallery.
 
✦ Multiple masters and layouts: New in PowerPoint 2008, you now have 
the power of design control. You can use and create multiple slide mas-
ters as well as control over multiple slide layouts.
 
✦ iPhoto integration: PowerPoint has new ways to interact with your 
iPhoto albums. You can send slide shows directly to iPhoto, and with 
our help, you can bring iPhoto albums into PowerPoint.
 
✦ Working with Web 2.0: We guide you through the process of getting 
YouTube videos into PowerPoint and offer pointers on how to get your 
PowerPoint presentations into YouTube.
 
✦ Special effects: The special effects you can apply to pictures are all new 
in PowerPoint 2008.
 
✦ Drawings, shapes, SmartArt, WordArt, charts, and graphs: The inner 
workings of PowerPoint that make all these things were completely re-
done for 2008. You’ll notice niceties, such as the new reflection feature, 
because of this improvement.
 
✦ Document themes and styles: There’s a whole new way to work with 
document themes and styles, and special places to save them.
 
✦ New gradient fill formatting: Now you can add multiple colors to gradi-
ent fills to add interest to filled shapes.
Flip to Chapter 3 of this minibook to read about the common core of Office 
features before moving on to Book IV, which is devoted to features exclusive 
to PowerPoint.

Book I
Chapter 1
Oscillating in the 
Office 2008 World
19
Getting Familiar with Office 2008
Also, PowerPoint offers a speaker confidence by being a tool to organize your 
thoughts and to express them electronically in a beautiful and/or business-
like way. You can easily rehearse your presentation with PowerPoint using 
the Rehearse Timings feature.
Beyond business presentations, PowerPoint slide shows are also a great 
way to share photographs with family and friends. You can add your own 
personal touch by narrating the slide show. You can e-mail smaller presenta-
tions right from within PowerPoint. Larger slide shows can be saved on inex-
pensive CDs and sent via regular mail, or uploaded to file-sharing sites.
If you’re a teacher or a student, you probably have found PowerPoint to be 
an indispensable tool. No longer do students have to put up with ancient 
chalk technology that’s hard to see. Projectors have become inexpensive 
enough that most schools can afford to install them and display PowerPoint 
presentations on them.
Today, PowerPoint can help even more. You can easily share your 
PowerPoint presentations with individuals, specific groups, or the entire 
world. With Web 2.0 technologies, such as iChat, Microsoft Messenger, 
YouTube, Yahoo!, Microsoft Office Live, Facebook, and MySpace, presenta-
tions can be distributed to audiences inexpensively.
You may not have thought of some of the ways to use PowerPoint. If 
you’re looking for a tool that creates flash cards for your computer, use 
PowerPoint. Not only that; PowerPoint can make flash cards for cellphones 
and iPods. We explain the basics of how you can do this in the PowerPoint 
chapters that you find in Book IV.
Making your day with Entourage
The first time you encountered the PIM acronym, you might have said, 
“What’s a PIM?” PIM is one of the few acronyms that sounds good when 
pronounced. PIM stands for Personal Information Manager, which is a great 
description of Microsoft Entourage.
Entourage is probably the best application to manage, store, archive, and 
search e-mail on the Mac. Organizing mail into categories is an efficient way 
to save time because using categories helps you set priorities.
 
For those switching to Office 2008 from a Windows Office version, think of 
Microsoft Entourage as Microsoft Outlook. Integration with Microsoft 
Exchange is included in all bundled packages of Microsoft Office 2008 except 
the Home and Student edition, just like the Windows product lineup.
If you’ve been using Apple applications, think of Entourage as a super-
charged combination of Apple Mail, Address Book, and iCal. And throw in a 
project management system and clipping organizer. And of course, better 
integration with Microsoft Office applications.

20
Getting Familiar with Office 2008
Even users of open source find Entourage hard to resist. Imagine having 
Thunderbird, Sunbird, a contact manager, a project manager, an LDAP 
(Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) client, a security certificate manager, 
and more all rolled into one. That’s the power of Entourage 2008. Among the 
new and improved features are the following:
 
✦ Rules: PowerPoint isn’t the only application that lets you have fun. 
Believe it or not, you can easily do amazing things with the Rules fea-
ture of Entourage. By creating and bending your own mail rules within 
Entourage, you automate your inbox entirely. Rules are both powerful 
and playful, and can move and/or copy messages to folders on your 
hard drive.
 
✦ Project tagging: It’s fun (well, sometimes) and easy to manage e-mail, 
tasks, Calendar events, your to-do list, and even your documents. In 
Entourage, you can tag all these things with categories and/or assign 
them to projects. When you create projects in Entourage, they’re acces-
sible throughout the Microsoft Office 2008 suite. In Word, Excel, and 
PowerPoint a Projects tab in the new Toolbox lets you have instant 
access to your projects. Your project documents are available on 
the Project Center tab of Project Gallery. We devote Book VI to the 
Entourage Project Center application and dive into the niceties of this 
powerful set of tools.
 
✦ Junk mail filter: Entourage can help control junk mail from becoming a 
crisis through a built-in junk mail filter that’s kept up-to-date automati-
cally when Office updates are installed.
 
✦ Address Book: Keeping track of your contacts has become an essential 
activity for everyone. Everything you’d expect in a Contact Manager or 
an Address Book is in Entourage. Just wait ’til you see the many ways 
you can print your Address Book.
 
✦ LDAP compatibility: Large organizations, businesses, and universities 
often have institution-wide address books that use an LDAP standard. 
If your institution uses LDAP, you can use Entourage to look up people 
in the institution’s LDAP directory and to add contacts from LDAP into 
your Entourage contacts. Entourage can auto-complete e-mail addresses 
from the institution’s directory without you having to add people to 
your contact list.
 
✦ Calendar: A great Calendar is built right into Entourage. You can create 
and manage your Calendar by making Calendar events. Planning meet-
ings or other activities is a cinch; reminders can be set. Your entire 
daily schedule can appear in the new Entourage My Day feature, which 
gives you access to your Calendar even when Entourage 2008 is closed. 
Entourage users who also use Microsoft Exchange can see each other’s 
free/busy information — even with Outlook users on the same server. 
Because Entourage uses industry standard Calendar events, you can 

Book I
Chapter 1
Oscillating in the 
Office 2008 World
21
Getting Familiar with Office 2008
share them with other Entourage users and with other standards-
compliant Calendar programs. For example, open-source Sunbird 
Calendar users can share Entourage Calendar events.
 
✦ Task Manager: You probably have many tasks to do. Whether you have 
to write a report or complete an assignment, you can add your task to 
the Entourage Task Manager. The new My Day feature reminds you of 
your tasks as the day progresses and lets you manage your tasks on the 
fly during the work day.
 
✦ Notes: Maybe you just need to make a quick note about something lest 
you forget. Use the Entourage Notes feature. Notes is better than regular 
Stickies or tying a thread on your finger because Entourage Notes can be 
linked to just about anything and can be tagged in categories and proj-
ects. Get more familiar with linking in Entourage in Book V.
 
✦ Project management: Organizing your activities into discrete projects 
is a great way to keep track of your busy office or home lifestyle. Project 
Center is a major application within Microsoft Entourage that integrates 
with all the Office 2008 applications. Project Center supports organizing 
and linking and sharing of document files from all applications on your 
Mac. We cover the Entourage Project Center in complete detail in all of 
Book VI.
 
✦ Customizable toolbars: At last! Entourage 2008 allows you to customize 
the toolbars of every single window in Entourage.
Mingling instantly with Messenger
Communicating and collaborating with peers, co-workers, classmates, your 
boss, your parents, and your kids is all the rage. Whether you use a com-
puter, an iPhone, or another mobile device, instant messaging is a priority. 
Microsoft Messenger allows for live communication and collaboration. For 
those who abhor instant messengers because they let others interrupt your 
work, Microsoft Messenger has plenty of features to keep unwanted ele-
ments away!
In addition to its instant messaging functions, Messenger also provides 
text and document sharing. The latest update of Messenger on the Mac 
integrates with Microsoft Office Communications Server 2007, a unified com-
munications server package, to provide new live video and audio chat in 
addition to text messages. Quite possibly by the time you read this, live 
video and audio will be available without having to use Microsoft Office 
Communication Server.
Lighting the future with Silverlight
The Internet may be getting older, but new technologies for it are emerging. 
Silverlight is one such technology that gives Web browsers new capabilities.

22
Getting Familiar with Office 2008
Many people are familiar with Adobe Flash and its associated player. If 
you’ve ever watched a cartoon on your Mac, played a game online, or 
watched a Google or YouTube video, you’ve most likely used the Flash 
Player. And if you’re like most people, you might wish that the presentation 
quality was better. In comes Silverlight, which provides a much richer visual 
and interactive experience than Flash, and is competing head-to-head with 
Adobe’s new Adobe AIR product.
Even though it’s a small Web browser plug-in, Silverlight allows you to play 
an enormous amount of rich PC content on a Mac.
When it comes to Web 2.0, Silverlight ensures that Macs aren’t second-class 
citizens when it comes to taking advantage of new Web content, such as 
watching movies online at Netflix, zooming almost infinitely in and out of a 
map. In the near future, you most likely will be able to run some Microsoft 
Office applications online in Silverlight on your Mac.
Imagine a large, happy family in an ideal world 
where each person’s personality and skills 
meshed together so that the whole family 
benefits. Now imagine that each member of 
this family communicates and interacts with 
other families in friendly ways. Office 2008 is 
very much like an ideal family. Each application 
within Office 2008 is designed to work together 
with the other Office applications, the Internet, 
and the Mac OS X applications as well as to 
interface with Office 2007 for Windows.
Word can be coupled with Excel to gener-
ate professional quality, personalized custom 
brochures, letters, and e-mail sent to a small 
group of friends or to hundreds of thousands 
of people.
The Excel graphs can be displayed in Word, 
Excel, and PowerPoint. The results of Excel for-
mulas can be displayed in Word or PowerPoint 
or even on the Web. Mac and PC users can 
work on the same Excel document at the same 
time.
You often hear seamless used to describe 
applications that work together as well as 
Office 2008 applications. The same powerful 
drawing tools are available in Word, Excel, and 
PowerPoint. The documents you create from 
any application can be organized and shared 
with Project Center in Entourage.
Some interesting specialty features are 
built into Office 2008. Maybe even some you 
wouldn’t expect, such as a special, large 
capacity Clipboard — the Scrapbook. Within 
Office, you’re not limited to just one thing on the 
Clipboard at a time. In Office 2008, Word, Excel, 
PowerPoint, and Entourage all share the same 
Scrapbook, which is a common multiple-item 
clipboard that can be used to share content 
between one application and another.

What’s New Office-Wide for 2008?
What’s New Office-Wide for 2008?
If you’re upgrading from an older version of Office for Mac, you immediately 
see new elements in the user interface, such as the new Elements Gallery, 
when you open any Office application. Yet often, you don’t see the things 
that get changed the most because these changes affect what goes on 
behind the scenes, as with the revamped graphics engine that draws boxes 
that still look like boxes, but now they have some new formatting options.
Elation from Elements Gallery
Perhaps the most visible change from earlier versions of Microsoft Office is 
the new Elements Gallery in Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.
To display this handy new feature, click any of the buttons on the new 
Elements bar, which is located just under the Standard toolbar. Figure 1-5 
shows how Elements Gallery looks in Microsoft Word 2008.

Click for more options.
To display Elements Gallery, which in Figure 1-5 shows the SmartArt 
Graphics elements, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Word icon in the Dock.
 
 A new blank document opens, or you’re taken to Project Gallery, where 
you open a new blank Word document.
 
2. In Word’s View menu, choose any of the following views:
 
• Print Layout View
 
• Web Layout View
 
• Publishing Layout View
 
 Elements Gallery is not available in other views in Word.
Figure 1-5:

24
What’s New Office-Wide for 2008?
 
3. Click any of the buttons, such as the SmartArt Graphics button on the 
Elements bar, or click the Gallery button on Word’s Standard toolbar.
 
 Elements Gallery reveals itself in the document window.
 
4. Click the Relationship button in Elements Gallery.
If your screen is wider than the one shown in Figure 1-5, you may see more 
SmartArt graphics elements from which to choose.
To hide Elements Gallery, click the SmartArt Graphics button on the 
Elements bar a second time, or click the Gallery button on Word’s Standard 
toolbar.
 
All buttons on the Elements bar are toggle buttons that alternate between 
showing and hiding Elements Gallery.
Another way to show and hide Elements Gallery is to click the Gallery button 
on the Standard toolbar.
Getting smart with SmartArt Graphics
You could always easily make attractive graphics in Microsoft Office. But 
with the new SmartArt Graphics, professional pizzazz is only a few clicks 
away.
One of the behind-the-scenes aspects of Office 2008 is that the way shapes 
and graphics are drawn has been completely overhauled. One of the Mac 
Microsoft MVPs has dubbed them with a cute nickname, squeezy graphics.
Whatever you call them, they give Office added capabilities, including true 
3D perspectives and a realistic reflection effect for pictures and shapes.
Discovering new Office-wide themes
Word used to have its own themes, and PowerPoint had different themes. 
There was no coordination.
The new Office document themes (color combinations and other formatting 
aspects) are now Office-wide. Themes made in PowerPoint can be shared 
with Word and Excel. Themes are portable between Mac and Windows plat-
forms and are saved in files with .thmx extensions.
You can save and manage themes in entirely new ways with Formatting 
Palette, Elements Gallery, and Project Gallery. We get you up to speed on 
themes in Chapter 6 of this minibook.

Comparing Office 2008 for Mac with Office for Windows
Comparing Office 2008 for Mac 
with Office for Windows
The team who developed the Macintosh Business Unit (MacBU) wanted to 
be able to incorporate features of Mac OS X in its version of Microsoft Office. 
They succeeded in creating a very Mac-like product. Consequently, Office 
for Mac has many features not found in Windows Office and vice versa. This 
is also the reason why version numbers often alternate between Mac and 
Windows Office — each version has unique features.
Picking the products
Microsoft sells Office in various bundles at various prices. Home and student 
users can save a lot of money by purchasing special packages. Businesses 
and educational institutions can save money by purchasing under a volume 
license agreement. Details about these packages can be found on Microsoft’s 
Web site, Mactopia, for Mac products:
www.microsoft.com/mac
Both Mac and PC platforms
All bundles for both Apple Macintosh and Microsoft Windows include these 
applications:
 
✦ Microsoft Word
 
✦ Microsoft Excel
 
✦ Microsoft PowerPoint
We break it down a little further though. Here we list which applications are 
unique to Mac or PC versions of Office. If similar functionality is offered by 
Office for Mac, we tell you which Office for Mac feature to explore as a pos-
sible substitute for the missing Windows application.
Just on Windows
Office Home and Student 2007 for Microsoft Windows comes with an addi-
tional program called OneNote 2007, which is not available for Mac.
Word 2008 on the Mac has Notebook View, which offers similar functionality 
to OneNote without having to install an additional application. OneNote files 
aren’t compatible.
Office Professional 2007 for Microsoft Windows comes with four additional 
applications that aren’t included Microsoft Office 2008 for the Mac:

26
Comparing Office 2008 for Mac with Office for Windows
 
✦ Microsoft Access 2007: In Office for Mac, use Microsoft Query with Excel 
2008 for relational database capabilities. Data from Access databases 
can be queried by Mac’s Microsoft Query application.
 
✦ Accounting Express 2009: Yes, that 2009 suffix was not a typo. Current 
shipments of Office 2007 now include Accounting Express 2009 because 
Microsoft changes the software to keep the bundle up to date. No equiv-
alent is found in Office for Mac.
 
✦ Outlook 2007 with Business Contact Manager (BCM): Microsoft 
Entourage 2008 is the most similar application in Office for Mac. 
Entourage includes most features of Outlook including Microsoft 
Exchange Server support. The following explains two differences:
 
• Project Center: Outlook doesn’t include Project Center, which is Mac 
only, and is included in Entourage.
 
• Outlook BCM: The Outlook BCM feature is Windows only. Entourage 
doesn’t support BCM.
 
✦ Publisher 2007: In Office for Mac, use the Microsoft Word Publishing 
Layout View for similar functionality without installing a separate 
application.
Just on Macintosh
The following list describes features found only in Office for Mac:
 
✦ Project Gallery: This application lets you prioritize, organize, share, and 
search for and launch documents.
 
✦ Project Center: Project Center in Office 2008 for Mac is project manage-
ment software targeted toward businesses and home and student users. 
Project Center is what most people are looking for when they seek soft-
ware that helps them manage their everyday projects.
 
 Project Center in Office 2008 for Mac isn’t the same as a similar sounding 
but entirely different Microsoft product for Windows called Microsoft 
Project, which is marketed to professional project managers.
 
✦ My Day: The new My Day Entourage feature keeps you on top of things 
while it stays on top of all the application windows on your screen. 
Calendar events and tasks pop on and off as your day progresses.
Microsoft Office 2008 Home and Student edition for Mac comes with Word, 
Excel, PowerPoint, and Entourage. Like the Home and Student edition of 
Office 2007 for Windows, Entourage (the Mac e-mail program) doesn’t have 
support for Microsoft Exchange Server.

Understanding file format compatibility
Newer file formats for Windows and Macintosh versions of Word, Excel, 
and PowerPoint are identical. You can freely pass these files between Macs 
and PCs.
Microsoft Access MDB files (.mdb) can be queried with Microsoft Query 
in Office 2008 for Mac, but Query is read-only. Tables and records can’t be 
modified by Office for Mac. Reading Access files requires a third party driver 
called an ODBC (Open DataBase Connectivity) driver, which isn’t supplied 
with Office 2008.
Microsoft SQL Server databases can be queried with Microsoft Query in 
Office 2008. The same limitations regarding Microsoft Access apply.
The following applications aren’t supported, and their files can’t be opened 
in Office 2008:
 
✦ Microsoft OneNote
 
✦ Microsoft Project
 
✦ Microsoft Publisher
 
✦ Microsoft Visio

Comparing Office 2008 for Mac with Office for Windows
Navigating the interface
Although Microsoft Office applications for Macintosh and Windows started 
from similar code bases many years ago, the two platforms have diverged in 
their approach to the Desktop and in how application windows behave.
Launching applications
You can launch Office 2008 applications in any one of several ways. The first 
two are the ones you’re likely to use most often:
 
✦ Double-click the document icon of any document previously made by 
any Office 2008 application.
 
✦ Click an application icon on the Mac OS X Dock.
 
✦ If the application has been launched recently, click the Apple Menu, 
choose Recent Items, and then select a recently used file or application 
from the Recent Items submenu.
 
✦ Open the Applications Folder and then open the Microsoft Office 2008 
folder. You can double-click an application’s icon to open the 
application.
 
✦ Right-click or Control-click any document and choose Open With from 
the pop-up menu to specify which application to use to open a file.
 
✦ Drag a document’s icon to the appropriate Dock icon.
 
For those used to Microsoft Windows, there’s no taskbar in Mac OS X. 
Instead, Mac OS X provides a Dock that you can easily customize. If you hold 
down the Option key while you open an application, other applications that 
are running will be hidden. This is more like the way Windows works, so you 
might be more comfortable opening applications and documents this way.
Figure 1-6 shows the Office 2008 Dock icons. Of course, Dock icons can be 
arranged in any order by dragging them, so yours may not be in the same 
order that ours are. You won’t see Microsoft Messenger or Expression Media 
unless you install them separately. Expression Media is included only with 
certain product bundles, as we mention earlier in this chapter.

Opening Spaces
Apple has a new Mac OS X feature for people who like to keep things in neat 
compartments on their screens. In Mac OS X Leopard and Snow Leopard, 
this feature is Spaces. You can put one document in each space if you like.
 
 To turn on Spaces, follow these steps, as shown in Figure 1-7:
 
1. Click the Apple Menu in the menu bar.
 
2. Click System Preferences and then double-click Exposé and Spaces.
 
3. Click the Spaces tab and then select the Enable Spaces check box.
You see that you have a number of customization possibilities.

Switching from one document to another
Several different methods can be used to switch from one document to 
another while using Microsoft 2008 for Mac. Here are some common ways to 
switch from one open document to another: 
 
✦ Click the Window menu. Select an open document from the bottom of 
the menu. Tried and true.
 
✦ Click any visible window. You may see other windows behind the 
active window. If you can see even a little piece of window, click it to 
make it the active window.

30
Comparing Office 2008 for Mac with Office for Windows
 
✦ Press F8 (or FN-F8 on some laptops) to switch to Spaces (if you turned 
on Spaces in the preceding section).
 
✦ Click and hold an application icon in the Dock, and then select a 
document from the top portion of the pop-up menu. Each application’s 
icon in the Dock is also a document switcher. Figure 1-8 shows what 
you’d see if you had five Word documents open. In this figure, we want 
to switch to the document Book 1 Chapter 1, which we selected in the 
pop-up menu.

Switching from one application to another
Here are the two easy ways to switch between applications:
 
✦ Press Ô-Tab on the keyboard.
 
✦ Click any application icon in the Dock.
Coping with Office automation incompatibility
Office 2008 for Mac doesn’t have support for a very popular programming 
language — Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). Previous versions 
of Office for Mac did have VBA support. This means that
 
✦ VBA scripts, macros, and add-ins no longer run at all in Word, Excel, or 
PowerPoint 2008.
 
✦ Office 2008 doesn’t ship with the popular Solver add-in for Excel. You 
can download a new, free AppleScript version of Solver from Solver’s 
creators at the Frontline Systems Web site:
www.solver.com/mac
 
✦ RealBasic, another popular programming language, is no longer 
supported.

Oscillating in the 
Office 2008 World

Comparing Office 2008 for Mac with Office for Windows
Office 2008 does include extensive support for Apple’s system-wide scripting 
language, AppleScript. Although you can use AppleScript as a substitute for 
VBA, unlike VBA, AppleScript isn’t cross-platform. Unfortunately, Windows 
versions of Office don’t support AppleScript.
The incompatibility will go away when VBA returns to Office for Mac in the 
next major release of it, but no plans are in the works to include VBA as an 
update to Office 2008. Office 2004, the previous version before Office 2008, 
does support VBA on the Mac.
 
If you need to be able to run VBA on the Mac, you’re limited to Office 2004 
(or earlier). Other options include
 
✦ Running a Windows version of Office in the Apple Boot Camp or in a 
Windows virtual machine with Parallels or VMWare Fusion.
 
✦ Running Office 2007 for Windows directly in Mac OS X with the NTFS 
product for Mac OS X from Paragon software.
Co-existing with Office 2004 and earlier
Office 2008 by default creates new Word, Excel, and PowerPoint documents 
in the new XML-based file format. The new XML formats have the same 
file extensions as the old ones plus the letter x appended to the file exten-
sion, such as .docx, .xlsx, and .pptx. When you’re using Office 2008, 
you can save files in the new XML format documents or in the old format. 
Choose File➪Save As in any of the Office 2008 applications to find an option 
to save in the old format in the Format list box. Then your documents can 
be opened in any version of Office from Office 97 to Office 2004, both Mac 
and Windows. You definitely should do this when sharing documents with 
people using versions of Microsoft Office prior to Office 2004 on the Mac and 
Office 2003 on Windows.
Alternatively, you don’t have to save in the old file format for users of Office 
2004 (Mac) or Office 2003 (Windows) in one scenario. Microsoft has pro-
vided updates and converters (which we describe later in this chapter) so 
that these older program versions can open and save files in the new XML 
file format. Although the older programs can’t work with any of the new 
Office 2008 feature content in XML format documents, updated Office 2003 
and 2004 programs retain the new feature content and the new XML file 
format. Notice how the following section differs in this regard.
Saving from 2008 to the old format
Before you save in the old format (without an x at the end of the file exten-
sion), realize that saving in the old format permanently removes or changes 
many things including SmartArt Graphics, organization charts, drawings, 
and graphs. If you open your document in Office 2008 after saving it in the 

32
Comparing Office 2008 for Mac with Office for Windows
old format, your document opens in Compatibility Mode, which we discuss 
earlier in this chapter. Be sure to save a copy in the new XML format before 
you follow these steps to save in the old format. Note that we’re using Word 
in this example:
 
1. Choose File➪Save As within any Office 2008 program.
 
 A Save As dialog opens.
 
2. Click the Format drop-down list and choose the Word 97–2004 
Document (.doc) format.
 
3. Change the filename if you desire, and then click the Save button.
Choosing a default save format
Office 2008 lets you change the default so that you can always save in the old 
Office 97 through Office 2004 format if you choose to do so. Each application 
has a slightly different way to set this, so the following are the instructions 
for each application.
To change Microsoft Word 2008 to always save in the pre-Office 2007/2008 
format:
 
1. Click the Word menu and choose Preferences.
 
 The Word Preferences dialog opens.
 
2. Click the Save button.
 
 The Save dialog appears.
 
3. Below Save Options, click the Save Word Files As drop-down list, 
choose Word 97–2004 Document (.doc) without an x at the end and 
click OK.
To change Excel 2008 to always save in the old Excel 97 through 2004 XLS 
format:
 
1. Click the Excel menu and choose Preferences.
 
 The Excel Preferences dialog opens.
 
2. Click the Compatibility button.
 
3. Below Transition, click the Save Files in This Format drop-down list, 
choose Excel 97–2004 Workbook (.xls) without an x at the end, and 
click OK.
To change Microsoft PowerPoint 2008 to always save in the old PowerPoint 
97 through 2004 PPT format:

Book I
Chapter 1
Oscillating in the

33
Comparing Office 2008 for Mac with Office for Windows
 
1. Click the PowerPoint menu and choose Preferences.
 
 The PowerPoint Preferences dialog opens.
 
2. Click the Save button.
 
3. Below Save options, click the Save PowerPoint Files As drop-down list, 
choose PowerPoint 97–2004 Presentation (.ppt) without an x at the 
end, and click OK.
Saving from 2004 to the new XML format
To further enhance compatibility with the new file formats, Microsoft did the 
following:
 
✦ Save feature: Updated Microsoft Office 2004 so that it can save in the 
new XML file format.
 
✦ Open feature: Updated Microsoft Office 2004 so that it can automatically 
open documents that were saved in the new XML file format (requires 
Open XML Converter).
 
✦ Open XML Converter: Released Open XML Converter, a free application 
that converts files made in the new file format into 97–2004 formats. This 
application can covert multiple documents at once. See the following 
section, “Using Open XML Converter.”
Copies of Office 2004 need to be updated to at least the 11.5.1 update. 
To update Office 2004, choose Help➪Check for Updates in Word, Excel, 
Entourage, or PowerPoint versions of Office 2004 for Mac.
In Office 2004 (with updates installed), to save a currently active document 
to the new XML Mac and Windows format in Word, Excel, or PowerPoint, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪Save As.
 
 A Save As dialog opens.
 
2. Click the Format pop-up menu and choose one of the following 2008 
formats:
 
• Word 2008 Document
 
• Word 2008 Macro Enabled Document
 
• Excel 2008 Workbook (.xlsx)
 
• Excel 2008 Binary Workbook (.xlsb)
 
• Excel 2008 Macro-Enabled Workbook (.xlsm)

34
Comparing Office 2008 for Mac with Office for Windows
 
• Excel 2008 Macro-Enabled Template (.xltm)
 
• Excel 2008 Add-In (.xlam)
 
• PowerPoint 2008 Presentation
 
• PowerPoint 2008 Template
 
• PowerPoint 2008 Show
 
3. Change the filename if desired and then click the Save button.
 
When sharing documents with users of both 2004 and 2008 versions of 
Office, it’s usually best to keep the documents in the older non-XML file 
format. Your documents will work fine in Office 2004, and in 2008, they will 
open and can be worked on in Compatibility Mode. When users of Office 
2004 open documents created in the new XML file format, they should keep 
them in the new format unless they have to save the files for someone with 
an even older Office version.
 
Simply adding an x to a file extension doesn’t turn an old format document 
into a new XML format document. Likewise, deleting the x from a new XML 
format document doesn’t turn the new XML format into the old format. 
Doing either of these things causes problems with your document. Use the 
procedures we discuss in this chapter or use the Open XML Converter to 
change the file formats.
Using Open XML Converter
Installing the Open XML file provides the following capabilities:
 
✦ Gives updated Office 2004 applications the ability to open and work 
with files in the new XML file format.
 
✦ Acts as a standalone application that converts Office for Mac 2008 
and Office for Windows 2007 files from the new XML format to the old 
format.
To obtain the Open XML Converter application (see Figure 1-9), follow these 
steps:
 
1. Go to the Mactopia Web site:
www.microsoft.com/mac
 
2. Click Downloads and below the Browse for Downloads and Products 
headings, click Additional tools.
 
 A list appears below the Downloads heading.

you’ve installed the converter, you can open the new XML format files 
just like the old ones.
 
✦ Right-click or Control-click a new XML format Word, Excel, or 
PowerPoint document and then choose Open XML Converter from the 
pop-up menu.
 
✦ Open the Open XML Converter application in your Applications folder. 
Choose Convert One File from the Open XML Converter menu and drag a 
file into the converter window, as shown in Figure 1-9.

f you’ve ever been to a museum with lots of galleries filled with art or 
fossils, you know that a gallery can be both overwhelming and awe-
inspiring. The good news is that Office 2008 galleries, such as Project 
Gallery, make the software less intimidating by showing the types of things 
you can do at a single glance, which is still pretty awe-inspiring but not so 
overwhelming. In this chapter, we show you how Project Gallery helps you 
get started with all kinds of new documents and then we help you even 
more by assisting you in finding your saved work.
Most are more akin to the other people around us than we like to believe. 
For starters, we all want to be more organized, but most don’t have enough 
time in the day to take care of all the details. Project Gallery saves you time 
by searching for those documents you lost track of. Better yet, Project 
Gallery automatically organizes and displays all the documents that you’ve 
associated with projects you create in Project Center, a fantastic project 
organizing feature we detail fully in Book VI. In this chapter, we focus 
entirely on Project Gallery, which is a gallery consisting of
 
✦ Blank documents
 
✦ Templates
 
✦ Wizards
 
✦ Office themes
 
✦ Recently used documents
 
✦ Documents associated with Project Center projects

38
Launching Project Gallery
 
Project Center is a completely different animal from Project Gallery. We 
cover the former in Book VI, and this chapter discusses the latter.
 
Starting off on the right foot can make your life easier, which is precisely what 
Project Gallery does. Project Gallery is one of the many exciting features of 
Office that may be new to you, especially if you’re new to the Mac, because 
Project Gallery has never been available in a Windows version of Office.
Launching Project Gallery
Project Gallery is available within every Office application and can be set 
to always appear whenever an Office application begins. In fact, that’s the 
default behavior unless you want to change it. If you open Project Gallery by 
launching an Office application, Project Gallery will default to a new, blank 
document for the application that was used to launch Project Gallery.
In addition, you can launch Project Gallery on demand, even if you’ve turned 
off automatic launching of Project Gallery when an Office application opens. 
Here are more ways to launch Project Gallery:
 
✦ From the File menu of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, or Entourage, choose 
the first item, Project Gallery.
 
✦ Press Shift-Ô-P when an Office application is running.
 
You can also put the Project Gallery icon in your Dock so that it’s always 
accessible with one click, even when no other Office 2008 application is run-
ning. First, check if you already have an icon for the Microsoft Project 
Gallery in the Dock. If you don’t, follow these steps to put the Project 
Gallery’s icon in the Dock:
 
1. Launch the Mac OS X Finder and locate the Microsoft Project Gallery 
application.
 
 Look in the Mac OS X Applications folder; then look inside the Microsoft 
Office 2008 folder, and you should find an icon for the Microsoft Project 
Gallery there.
 
2. Drag the icon for Microsoft Project Gallery, drop it into your Dock, 
and then let go.
 
 From now on, you can click the Dock icon for Project Gallery to launch it.
Time to start exploring Project Gallery’s interface. The Project Gallery con-
tains four tabs — New, Recent, Project Center, and Settings. In Figure 2-1, we 
illustrate the New tab of Project Gallery.

Opening Blank Documents from Project Gallery 
As you can see from Figure 2-1, many categories are available for you 
to choose the type of new document you want to create. When Project 
Gallery opens, the default category is Blank Documents. From here, you 
can choose from several types of blank documents , which we cover in the 
following sections.
Opening blank new documents
When Blank Documents is selected in the Categories list, you can choose to 
start a new blank document from any one of the several kinds of documents 
shown in the gallery. Office suggests a blank document type by selecting it 
for you.
 
The type of new document that Project Gallery selects by default depends 
on how you open Project Gallery. If you automatically open Project Gallery 
from Word, Excel, or PowerPoint, a blank document for the corresponding 
application is selected by default.
Figure 2-1: 
Project 
Gallery’s 
New tab.

40
Opening Blank Documents from Project Gallery
As shown in Figure 2-1, a Word document is what you would see if you 
launch Project Gallery from Word. To create the selected blank document, 
you can do any of the following:
 
✦ Press Return or Enter on the keyboard.
 
✦ Double-click the blank document’s icon in the gallery.
 
✦ Click the Open button at the bottom of the gallery.
 
When Project Gallery is open, you aren’t limited to the helpful options that 
are pre-selected for you. Indeed, you’re free to select any kind of document, 
template, Office theme, or wizard from any category on the New tab, or you 
can switch to another tab of Project Gallery. We explain the other tabs later 
in this chapter.
Opening other blank documents
Project Gallery is chock full of many different kinds of documents that we 
hope you’ll explore. In the Blank Documents category, you find other kinds 
of documents besides the traditional plain Word document, Excel workbook, 
or PowerPoint presentation. We explore the additional document types in 
this section.
Starting an Excel list
Other than a conventional Excel spreadsheet, the Blank Documents category 
shown in Figure 2-1 allows you to choose the List Wizard option. The List 
Wizard lets you create an Excel List sheet, a special kind of Excel object that 
lets you organize data in rows and columns as well as sort, filter, and/or cal-
culate them with several dynamic options. For more on the List Wizard, see 
Book III, Chapter 7.
Start taking notes in Word Notebook Layout View
Word Notebook Layout View is for typing (and recording audio notes) in 
meetings and classes. This offers much of the functionality of the Microsoft 
OneNote product for Windows without installing (or buying) another appli-
cation. When you choose this option, a new blank Word document opens 
in Notebook Layout View. We explain how to use Notebook Layout View in 
Book II, Chapter 1.
Creating a new Word Publishing Layout View document
Word Publishing Layout View is for creating newsletters, magazines, and 
other documents in which text flows through stories in page layout. Book II, 
Chapter 7 explains how to work with Word’s Publishing Layout View.

Writing a new e-mail message
Mail Message in Project Gallery’s Blank Documents category lets you open a 
new, blank e-mail message in Entourage. Book V, Chapter 3 has the informa-
tion you need to know about using e-mail in Office.
Creating a new Calendar event
In Project Gallery, use Calendar event to open a new blank Calendar event 
in Entourage. Book V, Chapter 6 covers how to use Calendars and Calendar 
events.
Exploring More Project Gallery Categories
We worked with the Blank Documents category in the preceding section. 
However, as you look through the list of categories in Project Gallery (refer 
again to Figure 2-1), you can see that you have many more category selec-
tions from which to choose. In this section, we highlight particular catego-
ries. Keep in mind that whenever you’re on the New tab of Project Gallery, 
you create a new document based upon the kind of document you select.
Using My Templates to open new documents
Sometimes the best things in life are your own creations or your favorite 
templates. The My Templates category in Project Gallery starts out empty. 
As you use Office, you’ll probably create your own templates or use estab-
lished company templates. When you save those templates in the My 
Templates folder, which we explain in the following section, your templates 
appear automatically in Project Gallery below the My Templates category so 
that you can launch new documents from them.
Saving a document as a template for My Templates
You can easily save a Word, Excel, or PowerPoint file as a template in the 
My Templates folder so that it shows up thereafter in the My Templates cat-
egory within Project Gallery. Follow these steps:
 
1. Create a document that has all the basic formatting you want to reuse.
 
 For example, a letterhead document in Microsoft Word.
 
2. Choose File➪Save As.
 
 The Save As dialog appears, as shown in Figure 2-2.
 
3. Type a filename for your template in the Save As text box.

42
Exploring More Project Gallery Categories
 
4. In the Format drop-down list, choose the appropriate template option 
from the pop-up list and then click Save.
 
 The appropriate format is one of the following, depending upon which 
application you use to create the template:
 
• Word Template (.dotx)
 
• Excel Template (.xltx)
 
• PowerPoint Template (.potx)
 
To make it easy for you, Office saves your template in My Templates folder 
by default, which is convenient for most users. If your Save As dialog looks 
different from Figure 2-2, click the Show/Hide Full Dialog toggle button, 
which is the triangle to the right of the Save As field. That changes your 
screen’s appearance to match Figure 2-2. For those who want to use alterna-
tive locations for templates, we explain how to do this in detail when we dis-
cuss Project Gallery’s settings at the end of this chapter.

Digging deeper into templates
You can save templates anywhere in your file system, but if you decide to 
put them someplace other than the default My Templates folder, they might 
not be available within the My Templates category within Project Gallery.
If you have a template in a location other than the default, you can make an 
alias of the template and put the alias into the My Templates folder.

To open the default My Templates folder, follow these steps:
 
1. Double-click the hard drive icon on your Mac Desktop.
 
 The Finder appears and shows you a list of files.
 
2. In the left panel, below Places, click the User icon.
 
 The User icon looks like a little house and is typically named after you or 
your computer.
 
3. Below the User icon, click Library, Application Support, Microsoft, 
Office, User Templates, and My Templates successively.
 
 This takes you to a folder where you can save your own templates.
 
To use templates stored on network drives, make aliases for template files 
and drag the aliases into the My Templates folder. Alternatively, you can 
choose a different location for templates on the Settings tab in Project 
Gallery. (See Chapter 1 of this minibook for more on the Settings tab in 
Project Gallery.)
 
To make an alias in Finder, select a template file or folder icon and press Ô-L.
Opening new documents based on My Themes
Themes have been part of Word for many years, but the new themes in Office 
2008 aren’t limited to Word alone. In Office 2008, themes received a major 
overhaul with the introduction of Office-wide themes. Now Word, Excel, and 
PowerPoint can work with the same themes. This means that if you save your 
PowerPoint formatting choices, such as fonts, colors, and backgrounds, as a 
theme, you can re-create that to some extent in your Word and Excel docu-
ments as well. This is a great feature because now all your documents can 
have a consistent look no matter which application was used to create them. 
We cover themes in more detail in Chapter 6 of this minibook.
Themes control the font family, colors for lines, and fills for objects and 
shapes. In addition, themes can hold PowerPoint slide backgrounds and 
layouts. You can use the several pre-built themes that are included within 
Office 2008, or you can create and save your own.
 
The Office theme files are compatible across Office 2008 for Mac and its 
Office 2007 cousin on Windows. That’s great news if you want to share the 
theme files you create or customize. We cover customizing and creating 
themes in Chapter 6 of this minibook.
We also discuss creating your own customized themes in Books II, III, and IV 
in relation to Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, respectively.

Starting with the right template, theme, or wizard
The Project Gallery’s New tab is filled with a variety of professionally pre-
pared templates, themes, and wizards. (Yes, your license for Office allows 
you to make and distribute documents based on what you find and use from 
Project Gallery.)
When you open Project Gallery (see the section, “Launching Project Gallery,” 
earlier in this chapter), be sure to click the small, black disclosure triangles 
in the Category list on the left to display additional content, as shown in

Finding the Fab Four (Wizards, That Is)
Sick of manually aligning your lists? Do you dread preparing mailing labels 
and envelopes every time you send out a business letter? Dread no more. 
Amid all the templates in Project Gallery’s New tab, you’ll discover four 
Office wizards that help you take care of these common tasks.
Making lists with the List Wizard
 
 In Project Gallery, select Blank Documents in the Category list (refer to 
Figure 2-1) and then select the List Wizard option to get started on any kind 
of list in Excel 2008. Book III, Chapter 7 has deep-dive information on using 
this wizard. Some examples of content that would benefit from using the List 
Wizard are
 
✦ Class lists
 
✦ Employee lists
 
✦ Item inventories
Making labels and name badges
In Project Gallery in the Category list, select Labels and then select Mailing 
Label Wizard. You can use this wizard to create a variety of labels, such as:
 
✦ Mailing labels
 
✦ Name badges
 
✦ Shipping labels
 
✦ Tent cards
You can also start a mail merge with the Mailing Label Wizard. The Mailing 
Label Wizard uses Word along with a data or address sources to do its 
magic. Book II, Chapter 6 is where you’ll find what you need to know to get 
started making labels and doing mail merges.

46
Viewing What’s in the Galleries
Designing with the Envelope Wizard
In Project Gallery, in the Category list, select Stationary and then select 
Envelope Wizard to print envelopes. This wizard is great for holiday cards, 
invitations, and business envelopes. Like the Mailing Label Wizard, this also 
uses Word.
Making perfect business letters
In Project Gallery under the Category list, select Stationary and then select 
Letter Wizard. You’ll make perfect business letters every time with this 
wizard, which also uses Word.
Viewing What’s in the Galleries
The View buttons on the New tab are in a new place in the Office 2008 ver-
sion of Project Gallery — above the Category list (see Figure 2-5). The follow-
ing are the traditional views, including one new view, List with Kind, in Office 
2008. We explain each of the views as they appear in the New tab of Project 
Gallery from left to right:
 
✦ Icon: This is the default view that shows large icons for all the templates 
and wizards.
 
✦ List with Preview: This view typically has a preview that’s almost the 
same size as the icon, but to its credit, you can figure out which appli-
cation any selected template or wizard belongs to thanks to the use of 
miniature application icons next to the filenames and the descriptive 
information provided in the Details section. You can sort the list alpha-
betically by name by clicking Name at the top of the list of names. Click 
a second time to reverse the order. To group the list by Kind, click Kind 
at the top of the list. Click Kind again to reverse the order. Again, refer 
to Figure 2-5 to see where to click.
 
✦ List with Kind: This view, new to Office 2008, is the same as the List with 
Preview option but without the preview. List with Kind shows you what 
kind of document is in the list, such as Word Wizard or Word Template, 
as shown in Figure 2-5. You can sort the list alphabetically by clicking 
Name at the top of the list of names. Click a second time to reverse the 
order. To group the list by Kind, click Kind at the top of the list. A 
second click to Kind reverses the order. Again, refer to Figure 2-5 to see 
where to click.
 
In most cases, you can order any sort of list alphabetically or numerically in 
the Office interface by clicking on the headings of the list. A second click 
reverses the sort.

Finding Your Things in Project Gallery
You don’t want to spend a lot of time trying to locate your documents and 
spreadsheets on your computer. Project Gallery offers a few ways to search 
for your misplaced files.
Searching fast within Project Gallery
 
New in Project Gallery is a special search field. While you type in the 
Search field located in the top right of the Project Gallery window (refer to 
Figure 2-5), Project Gallery instantly narrows the items displayed for the 
currently selected tab while you type each character. This is a small but 
extremely powerful thing. Try it and you’ll be hooked right away.
Finding things with Open Other
Project Gallery can present a regular Mac OS X Finder Open File browsing 
dialog, as shown in Figure 2-6. Simply click the Open Other button in the 
lower-left corner of Project Gallery, as shown in Figure 2-3, to open the famil-
iar Open window in the Finder.
In the Open window, you can browse all of Mac OS X or search by filename 
to locate the content you seek.
 
Spotlight is the search technology built inside Mac OS X. If you use the 
Search feature in Office 2008, the Mac OS X Spotlight feature conducts the 
search.
Finding recently used files
What’s that you say? Four recently used files at the bottom of the File menu 
aren’t enough? No need to worry in this new Mac version of Microsoft Office. 
In Project Gallery, you can have hundreds of recently opened files!

To display recently used files, click the Recent tab in Project Gallery (see the 
section, “Launching Project Gallery,” earlier in this chapter, for more on 
opening Project Gallery). Figure 2-7 shows the Recent tab displayed in List 
with Kind view.
You can finally find recently used files easily. If you know even part of the 
filename you’re searching for, just start typing it in the Search box. While 
you type each character, Mac OS X Spotlight narrows the list.
What’s really amazing about this search is that you don’t have to know the 
exact filename. Just type a few consecutive letters from anywhere within the 
filename, and the list magically narrows. Instantly! While you type!
We think this is one of the best Office features of all time: It exemplifies the 
benefits of Office working with Macintosh technologies.
Remembering misplaced filenames
Okay, so you completely forgot the filename. You might be thinking, “I’ll 
know it when I see it!” The Recent tab can help you in the following ways:
 
✦ If you have a rough idea of the timeframe regarding the last time the 
document you’re seeking was opened, click one of the date ranges in the 
Dates menu.

The Recent tab in Project Gallery is aware of 
your network. The Recent tab displays files that 
are accessible only on your hard drive and cur-
rently connected network drives.
The Recent tab doesn’t display recently used 
filenames located on networks unless the net-
work drive is currently connected and available 
to the Mac OS X Finder. If the recently used file 
you were expecting isn’t on the recent list, you 
may need to check if the network volume (or 
other device such as flash drive or additional 
hard drive) is still available in Finder. It’s also 
possible that the file you’re looking for is no 
longer within the number of recent files you 
have set the limit to on the Project Gallery 
Settings tab.

Prospecting the Project Center Tab
Getting another chance to find a file
You can open a copy of any file without opening the original version. To open 
a copy of a document without disturbing the original, click the Open a Copy 
button at the bottom of the Project Gallery Recent tab (refer to Figure 2-7).
Prospecting the Project Center Tab
Project Center is a major feature of Office for Mac. Book VI is devoted to 
Project Center as an integral part of Entourage. Project Gallery plays host 
to just the documents portion of the entire Project Center feature through 
its Project Center tab, as shown in Figure 2-8.
 
If that sounds confusing, here are some facts to help you understand Project 
Center better:
 
✦ The Project Center tab of Project Gallery (see Figure 2-8) provides a 
quick way to find and launch documents that are associated with Project 
Center projects.

✦ The Project Center tab is empty until you create some projects (or even 
just one project) with Entourage. You might wonder why you create proj-
ects in Entourage. That’s because Project Center is a part of Entourage, 
and whenever you create a new project in Project Center, you’re essen-
tially using Entourage. As soon as you create projects in Entourage, 
they’re added automatically to the Projects listing in the Project Center

tab. Whenever you associate a document with an existing project, the 
document will be available on the Project Center tab of Project Gallery. 
Of course, you can also open Project Center documents from within the 
Project Center application.
 
✦ The Project Center tab of Project Gallery has all the same features as the 
Recent tab (which we describe earlier in this chapter). The difference 
between the Recent and Project Center tabs is that the Project Center 
tab limits the content to files associated with projects, which means any 
kind of file can be displayed and searched for. The Recent tab limits you 
to documents created by Office applications.
 
✦ The documents shown in Project Center aren’t limited to Office docu-
ments. You can locate and launch any kind of file.
 
✦ Documents that you associate with your projects in Entourage are dis-
played in the Project Center tab.
Customizing Project Gallery
Do you wish the tabs in Project Gallery and what you see within those tabs 
worked a little differently? What if you could make them behave just the way 
you want? To do that, click the Project Gallery Settings tab to open the pref-
erences headquarters (as shown in Figure 2-9).

General settings
The topmost section of the settings tab has General Project Gallery settings. 
If you want Project Gallery to open whenever you start Word, Excel, and 
PowerPoint, select the Show Project Gallery at Startup check box.
If you select the Confirm before Opening Other Programs check box, you get 
an alert every time you click a document from an application other than the 
one used to activate Project Gallery. We recommend that you don’t select 
this check box.
From the Open On drop-down list, choose which tab Project Gallery acti-
vates when it’s launched. You may choose from:
 
✦ One of the four Project Gallery tabs: New, Recent, Project Center, and 
Settings.
 
✦ Last Selection: This activates the tab that was used last.
The Show This Number of Recently Opened Files drop-down list lets you 
crank the number of files that are displayed on the Recent tab. We used 900 
and didn’t notice any performance problems on an iMac. Be brave. Go large!
Documents and wizards settings
The default is that each and every preference setting is turned on (checked). 
We recommend that you leave them all selected because this allows Project 
Center to take advantage of all the documents and wizards in the Gallery. 
If there is a particular reason you don’t want Project Gallery to use a docu-
ment type, deselect the check box next to it.
File location default settings
Earlier in this chapter, we pointed out that when you save a template from 
Word, Excel, or PowerPoint, the default file location is the My Templates 
folder. The default location of the My Templates folder for Office 2008 has 
changed from previous versions of Office. In previous versions, the My Tem-
plates folder was in the Applications folder. In Office 2008, the folder is the 
Mac OS X’s Application Support folder. The new default location offers several 
advantages over the old location. Among the most important advantages are
 
✦ Your templates won’t be affected if you upgrade or uninstall Microsoft 
Office.
 
✦ Each user of the computer has his own My Templates folder. One user 
can’t see or use another user’s templates, thereby greatly improving pri-
vacy for sensitive templates.
 
✦ Office 2008 conforms to Apple’s excellent privacy and security recom-
mendations. Office now uses the recommended Mac OS X Application 
Support Folder for user templates.

Customizing Project Gallery
Most readers don’t need to change the default file location settings or add 
additional locations for keeping templates. Unless you want to know more 
about this subject, please feel free to move on to another chapter or enjoy 
doing something else.
If you need to use templates that are shared, the rest of this section is writ-
ten with you in mind and is a bit on the technical side.
Changing file location settings for templates
The very first time you start your Mac or if you have to reinstall Mac OS X, 
you’re presented with a nice Welcome dialog and asked to configure a user 
account and give it a name. You’ll find that same name in the Mac OS X System 
Preferences menu under the Accounts list in the left menu. In Figure 2-10, we 
have several user accounts. A Mac OS X file path begins with the user account 
of the currently selected user in the Mac OS X Accounts pane. To figure out 
how to add new users, start from your computer’s Desktop and use the Help 
menu. Choose Mac Help and then search for the topic Creating a New User 
Account. Another relevant Help topic is How Your Computer Is Organized.

Local templates
Take a look at the File Locations settings near the bottom of the Project 
Gallery Settings tab, as shown in Figure 2-9. The first setting is Local 
Templates. This setting displays the current file path to your My Documents 
folder. Your path is different from Figure 2-10, but the structure of your file 
path is the same as ours.
To change the location for your local templates:

54
Customizing Project Gallery
 
1. Open Project Gallery to the Settings tab.
 
2. In the File Locations section, click the Local Templates filename.
 
 A Mac OS X file-locating dialog opens.
 
3. Navigate to the desired folder or use the dialog to create a new folder.
 
4. Click the Choose button.
Workgroup templates
This setting lets you choose a shared location, usually on a shared network 
drive, for additional templates to appear in Project Gallery. To set or change 
the location for your local templates, do the following:
 
1. Open Project Gallery to the Settings tab.
 
2. In the File Locations section, click Set a File Location for Workgroup 
Templates or click the filename if you’ve already set one that you wish 
to change.
 
 A Mac OS X file–locating dialog opens.
 
3. Navigate to the desired folder or use the dialog to create a new folder.
 
4. Click the Choose button.
If you already know what a file pathname is, you 
can skip ahead. The terms file path, file path-
name, directory, file directory, and Finder path 
all mean essentially the same thing. A file path 
is a statement listing the folders to a particular 
file on your computer. The pathname is read 
from left to right. A colon (:) separates each 
folder name from the next one in the hierarchy. 
The hierarchy begins with the User folder.
Here we dissect the example file pathname 
displayed in the Local Templates portion of 
the Settings tab of Project Gallery, as shown 
in Figure 2-9:
 ✓ /Users/. Every file path starts with the 
Users folder.
 ✓ /JBG/. The name of the current user. In 
Figure 2-10, JBG appears in the User Name 
field.
 ✓ /Library/. Every user has a Library 
folder where important system and user 
information resides. Don’t mess around 
with any of these settings unless you know 
what you’re doing.
 ✓ /Application Support/. This is 
the folder that applications are supposed 
to use for user-generated files, such as 
templates and themes, and other applica-
tion support files and folders.
 ✓ /Microsoft/. This is the folder that Micro-
soft uses for supporting its applications.
 ✓ /Office/. This folder is for Microsoft 
Office support files.
 ✓ /User Templates/. This is the folder 
that contains both your My Themes and My 
Templates folders in addition to other sup-
port folders.

W
hen you face the challenge of trying something new in Office 2008, 
you probably think about what you already know to see whether 
you can use that knowledge to complete the new task. After all, most Office 
applications such as Word, Excel, and PowerPoint do work with similar com-
mands, features, and options. So it’s not out of the ordinary to expect that 
your Word skills may help you use PowerPoint or Excel, or the other way 
around. When you realize that most of your knowledge is applicable, you feel 
good and gain self-confidence. That’s precisely the whole point of this chap-
ter and Chapters 4–6: We show you tools and skills that help you while using 
all the Office applications. In fact, if you figure out how to use these skills in 
one application, you’ll know how to use them in the others too.
Understanding how to use the tools and features in this chapter and 
Chapters 4–6 of this minibook is particularly rewarding. You might even 
have the confidence to venture out of your comfort zone and try other new 
things in the Office 2008 for Mac suite. For instance, after you know how to 
draw in Word, you’ll be pleased to discover that Excel and PowerPoint use 
the same drawing tools the very same way. You save so much time figuring 
out things only once.
Cruising Elements Gallery
 
You know that excited feeling you get when you buy some new high-tech 
accessory for your car or a new peripheral for your computer? At first, your 
new gadget is very shiny and showy, perhaps too fancy looking to be of any 
use, but soon it becomes part of your every day life, and you can’t live with-
out it. The brand new Office 2008 Elements Gallery (as shown in Figure 3-1) 
is like that. Elements Gallery is a new way to quickly insert a wide variety of 
often-used elements, such as tables, charts, diagrams, and so on into your 
documents. Elements Gallery is a great new feature that works the same way 
in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.

Elements Gallery
We know you want to get started right away with Elements Gallery, but 
first you need to turn it on. You can do any one of the following to toggle 
Elements Gallery on or off in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint:
 
✦ From the menu, choose View➪Elements Gallery.
 
 If the Elements Gallery option is grayed out in the View menu, then try a 
different view. In Word 2008, you must be in Web Layout View, Print 
Layout View, or Publishing Layout View to use Elements Gallery. All 
these views can be turned on from Word’s View menu. The Elements 
Gallery is always available in Excel and PowerPoint, except while run-
ning a PowerPoint slide show.
 
✦ Click the Gallery button on the Standard toolbar.
 
✦ Click once on any item in the Elements bar to turn it on and click a 
second time to turn it off.
 
 The Elements bar is the thin strip with options, such as Document 
Elements, Quick Tables, and so on.
As soon as you turn on Elements Gallery, you’ll have an impulse to click the 
different kinds of elements. Don’t resist the temptation! Go ahead and try 
some of the elements. They’re very easy to use — just click an element to 
activate it. Experienced users might recognize some elements, but everyone 
will find lots of new elements to experiment with. In fact, so many wonder-
ful elements are in Elements Gallery that we have room to discuss only the 
most commonly used elements.
If you look at Elements Gallery (refer to Figure 3-1), you’ll notice that some-
times so many elements are in a single group that they don’t all fit in one 
row. In that case, click the scroll arrow at the right side of the row (see 
Figure 3-2). After you click that arrow, the next group of elements slides into 
Elements Gallery. In the leftmost part of Elements Gallery, the descriptions 
change as the mouse hovers over the elements.

The description area
 
As the Office 2008 timesaving accessory, the new Elements Gallery is trés 
cool. You use it just about every time you work. You might even find it fun to 
explore the many different kinds of elements. Not only can you add elements 
to your documents, but you can also easily apply themes and styles from 
Elements Gallery. Your documents are sure to look more professional.
Summoning Pop-Up Menus
When you use Office applications, menu choices change depending upon 
what you’re doing. If you’ve selected an object, say a graph, a new menu 
option may appear in the menu bar at the top of the screen. Choices in black 
are available, and choices grayed out aren’t available.
In Office 2008, you can sometimes right-click or Control-click something to 
bring up a pop-up menu. For example, in Word, Excel, or PowerPoint, when 
you see a red squiggly line under a word, that word might be misspelled. 
Sure, you could highlight the misspelled word and manually type the cor-
rection, but it’s so much easier to right-click or Control-click the word and 
summon a pop-up menu, as shown in Figure 3-3. Click any of the suggested 
word replacements (if you find the one you’re looking for), and the applica-
tion saves you the trouble of typing anything at all!
Office 2008 has tons of such helpful features, and if you love to explore and 
discover new things, you’re in for so much fun. Office 2008 has plenty of 
right-clicking or Control-clicking secrets to reveal. Almost everything in the 
interface has a pop-up menu associated with it — even toolbars and white 
space. A word of caution, though: Don’t right-click or Control-click all over 
the interface when you’re squeezed for time — it’s so addictive that you may 
lose track of your original work purpose!
 
One of the greatest things about owning a Mac is that Apple publishes User 
Interface Guidelines for any software vendor that creates applications for the 
Mac. Of course, this includes Microsoft and its Office 2008 applications. With 
these guidelines, you get a consistent look and feel for all your applications. 
Standard Mac menus have been popular consistently for over 20 years. You 
might think it’s crazy, but in Office 2007 for Windows, Microsoft got rid of 
the menus and replaced them with tabs. Thankfully, Office 2008 for Mac still 
has good, old-fashioned, dependable menus.

Traversing the Menus and Toolbars
Office 2008 looks good right out of the box, but that’s only a starting point — 
what you see in the interface isn’t all there is. Just like you can rearrange the 
furniture in a room to suit your taste, feel free to rearrange the toolbars (and 
menus) to suit the way you work in Office 2008. One of the Office 2008 best 
features is the incredibly easy-to-work-with range of customization options. 
The following sections tell you how.
First, we discuss toolbars because they’re so much fun to work with. Existing 
users of Office for Mac recollect that toolbars used to be right under the 
menu bar; but new in Office 2008, the Standard toolbar and the Formatting 
toolbar are now incorporated in the document window (see Figure 3-4). New 
Office 2008 toolbars are now replicated in each document window and can’t 
be moved, dragged to other places, or docked to the screen borders. This 
lets you save and close a document, and then open it again with all your 
customizations intact and saved as part of the document. In many ways, this 
is in keeping with the popular, simple Web browser design, which Apple 
adopted in its applications. As wonderful as simplicity may be, Office 2008 
certainly isn’t as basic in its capabilities as a mere Web browser! The sim-
plicity we refer to here has more to do with the way the interface looks and 
works rather than the actual aptitude of the applications in Office 2008.

Traversing the Menus and Toolbars
To be fair, Microsoft must perform a balancing act when deciding which 
controls to place on the toolbars. If Microsoft provides toolbar icons for 
too many options, the interface gets busy and confusing. Whatever your 
preference, we show you how to get all the tool icons you want on your own 
toolbars, without making your interface cluttered. And you can use the same 
process to remove the tool icons you don’t want!
When you first start an Office application, the Standard toolbar is displayed 
directly below the document name at the top of the document window. 
Entourage has only one toolbar; but Word, Excel, and PowerPoint each have 
several additional built-in toolbars.
To toggle these toolbars on and off:
 
1. Choose View➪Toolbars.
 
2. Choose a toolbar from the submenu.
 
 A check mark appears next to the toolbars that you’ve toggled on, or 
made visible. Simply remove the check mark to toggle off the toolbar.
Customizing Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 
toolbars and menus
The Customize Toolbars and Menus dialog is a super-powerful dialog in 
Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. Whenever that dialog is open, you have total 
control over all the toolbars and menus. You also have easy access to all 
kinds of wonderful hidden features — brilliant jewels in the form of off-the-
beaten-path commands kept secret from mere mortals, but not from you!
Adding a jewel of a command
The Fit to Window command is a Word feature that’s so handy you might 
wonder why it’s not always on by default. The Fit to Window command 
automatically keeps the document proportionally sized to the size of the 
document window. After you try this command, you’ll probably use Fit to 
Window a lot; it’s a great example for discovering how easy it is to add com-
mands to any toolbar.
To add the Fit to Window command to a Word toolbar:
 
1. In Word, choose View➪Customize Toolbars and Menus.
 
 The Customize Toolbars and Menus dialog appears, as shown in Figure 3-5.
 
2. Click the Commands tab.
 
3. In the Categories list (on the left), choose the View category.

60
Traversing the Menus and Toolbars
  
Click where you want to save your changes to.
 
4. In the Commands list (on the right), scroll down to the Fit to Window 
command and choose it.
 
 Notice that when you choose a command, its description appears in the 
Description area. This is very handy for finding out more about com-
mands you may have never seen before.
 
5. Drag the Fit to Window command from the dialog to any toolbar and 
then release the mouse button.
 
 When the Customize Toolbars and Menus dialog is open, you can move 
any toolbar command or menu item by dragging it to any toolbar or menu.
 
 You can rearrange the commands within a toolbar or menu by dragging 
the commands into the order you want.
 
6. Click OK to close the Customize Toolbars and Menus dialog.
 
 You can use this same general steps to add other commands in Word, 
Excel, and PowerPoint.
Of course, after you get into the magical Customize Toolbars and Menus 
dialog, you’ll want to try hundreds of commands that you never knew about.

Don’t delete the Customize Toolbars and Menus command. If you do, you 
can’t go to the Customize Toolbars and Menus dialog unless you right-click 
or Control-click an empty area within any visible toolbar and select the 
Customize Toolbars option in the context menu that appears.
Ditching a dud command
Believe it or not, you can add too many commands to your toolbars. Soon, it 
might look like your toolbars are infested with more icons than mosquitoes 
in a jungle! Sometimes a command that sounds perfect turns out not to be at 
all what you’d hoped it’d be. You can easily get rid of an unwanted or little 
used command. For Mac diehards, it’s akin to removing a Dock icon without 
the poof!
Follow these steps to clean your toolbars:
 
1. From the menu bar, choose View➪Customize Toolbars and Menus.
 
 This brings up the Customize Toolbars and Menus dialog (refer to 
Figure 3-5).
 
2. Click and drag any unwanted commands off the toolbars and let go 
anywhere.
 
 You could drag it back to the open dialog or just into empty space!
 
3. Click OK to close the Customize Toolbars and Menus dialog.
 
 Now you can get back to your non-infested jungle . . . er, program interface.
Rolling your own
You might think that you could design much better toolbars than the ones 
the Microsoft folks provided. Maybe you noticed that having the same tool-
bar repeat over and over again in each window is less of a convenience and 
more like a waste of valuable screen real estate. Not everyone has a gor-
geous Apple 30-inch cinema display or two placed in a dual screen setup. 
And even if you do, you paid good money for that and have every right to 
design your own toolbar!
You’ll be pleased to know that you can make your own toolbars, fresh from 
scratch. They’re healthier for your computing environment because they’re 
homemade with only the finest commands that you select. While you’re at 
it, you can make your own menu choices, too! If only growing organic veg-
etables was this easy.
Also keep in mind that your new customized toolbars aren’t prisoners of the 
document window. Instead, they float — they can be moved by your mouse 
to any screen position. You can change their shape by clicking and dragging 

62
Traversing the Menus and Toolbars
the lower-right corner of the toolbar. They’re also dockable — they gently 
stick to the top, bottom, left, or right edge of the screen and out of your way 
like well-behaved children drinking hot soup on a winter night.
To make a new toolbar in Word, Excel, or PowerPoint:
 
1. From the menu bar, choose View➪Customize Toolbars and Menus.
 
 The Customize Toolbars and Menus dialog appears (refer to Figure 3-5).
 
2. On the Toolbars and Menus tab, click the New button.
 
 The Add a Toolbar pane, as shown in Figure 3-6, opens.
 
3. In the Add a Toolbar pane, type a name for your new toolbar and 
click OK.
 
 A very small box with an empty space on it appears onscreen. This small 
box is your new toolbar.
 
4. Click the Commands tab, choose any of the categories from the list on 
the left, drag commands to the new toolbar, and click OK to close the 
Customize Toolbars and Menus dialog.
 
Figure 3-6: 
Naming a 
new toolbar.
 
Your new toolbar appears in the toolbars list. You can view the new toolbar 
by choosing View➪Toolbars, or choosing View➪Customize Toolbars and 
Menus and then clicking the Toolbars and Menus tab.
Okay, your new toolbar looks nice, but not all the new commands on the 
toolbar have nice icons. You can control whether to display a command’s 
icon, text description, or both. To see the command controls, right-click or 
Control-click over a newly added command button and choose Properties. 
The Command Properties dialog, as shown in Figure 3-7, opens. In this 
dialog, you can do quite a bit from changing the icon/button of the command 
to assigning keyboard shortcuts, as we show you next.
Changing the command button icon
After you’re in the Command Properties dialog, which we explain in the pre-
ceding section, follow these steps to change the icon:
 
1. Click the Customize Icon downward-pointing arrow, as shown in 
Figure 3-7 to open a fly-out menu with plenty of options.
 
2. Choose from any of the available icons in this fly-out menu.

Remember that the Paste Button Image option works only with pictures

Assigning keyboard shortcuts to new command buttons
As if that weren’t enough customization, you can set or change the keyboard 
shortcut for any command. Remember that it’s possible to do this customi-
zation in Word and Excel only, not PowerPoint. To proceed with assigning 
keyboard shortcuts, follow these steps:
 
1. Make sure you followed steps in the preceding section to access the 
Command Properties dialog, as shown in Figure 3-7.
 
2. Press the Keyboard button.

Resetting, renaming, or trashing toolbars and menus
Maybe you got a little carried away with all this moving and customizing of 
toolbars and menus, and now you’re not so keen on some of the changes you 
made. Maybe you moved a command from the Standard toolbar and now 
you want the Standard toolbar restored the way it was originally. No need to 
worry; resetting is easy. Follow these steps:

Sharing toolbars and menus
Customizing your toolbars and interface is really cool, but what’s even cooler 
is that you can share these customizations with other folks. However, make 
sure that you advise people that you’ve done this before you share your docu-
ments with them; otherwise, they might be surprised when they open your 
document and see a different toolbar layout than what they’re used to.
Instead of saving your customizations just for your own computer, save 
them in the current document. Then, when your customized document is 
opened on another computer, your customized menus and toolbars will 
appear while that particular document is open.
To do this, follow these steps:
 
1. From the menu bar, choose View➪Customize Toolbars and Menus.
 
 The Customize Toolbars and Menus dialog (refer to Figure 3-5) appears.
 
2. In the lower-left corner of the dialog in the Save In list, save your 
changes to either the currently opened document or the template.
 
• If you see the name of your file in this list, you can choose that 
option to save the customizations as part of the file.
 
• If you see an option similar to Normal.dotm, that refers to the default 
settings template.
 
• If you see something like Document2, Presentation1, or similar, you 
haven’t saved the file you are working on yet.
 
If you want to have a variety of settings, each with its own customized toolbar 
and menus, make several documents and customize each one differently. 
Before you start your customizations, change the setting to keep the customi-
zations within the current document, which we describe in the preceding step 
list. When you’re done customizing, choose File➪Save As➪Template. Save 

66
Customizing Entourage and Project Center Toolbars
your customized documents into the My Templates folder, and your customi-
zations are available in Project Gallery. Remember that any documents you 
make from this sort of template carry your customized toolbars and menus 
with them wherever they go.
Customizing Entourage and Project Center Toolbars
 
Before Office 2008, Entourage and Project Center were less powerful pro-
grams without the ability to customize toolbars and menus. This is partly 
because Entourage and Project Center are much younger applications than 
Word, Excel, and PowerPoint and also because these programs have differ-
ent windows, which you discover in this section. When it came to imple-
menting toolbar customizations in Entourage, MacBU (Macintosh Business 
Unit) at Microsoft who are responsible for the development of Microsoft 
Office for Mac platform decided to introduce a new way to customize the 
interface. Thus, the toolbar customization procedures in these programs 
aren’t exactly the same as in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.
In Entourage and Project Center, the toolbars are based on types of win-
dows instead of on the entire application. Each different kind of window 
has its own toolbar customization possibilities. For example, a New Mail 
message window is different from a Calendar event window. Each kind of 
window has one toolbar that’s locked in that window. Within Entourage and 
Project Center, the windows on each tab can have their own customizations. 
Toolbar customizations aren’t global to the entire application in Entourage 
or Project Center like they are in other applications.
Getting started with toolbar customizing in Entourage and Project Center is 
easy as pie. To get at the customization box (see Figure 3-10), follow these 
two steps in any window:
 
1. Right-click or Control-click anywhere on the toolbar.
 
2. Choose Customize Toolbar from the pop-up menu.
 
 This brings up the dialog that you see in Figure 3-10.
 
3. When the customization box is open, you can drag commands to and 
from the toolbar.
 
 Figure 3-10 shows you the options available when you customize the 
New Event toolbar in Entourage. Because each different kind of window 
has its own customization options, you can expect to see different 
options depending upon which kind of window you’re customizing.

n this chapter, we explore the things you can do with Office 2008’s 
Toolbox. In addition to the Toolbox, Office 2008 is blessed with many 
Mac-only floating context-sensitive palettes. Many new palettes have been 
added to the Toolbox, and the Toolbox organization has changed from 
previous Office editions. With Office 2008’s new ability to customize the 
Toolbox, you’ll love palettes now more than ever.
Taking a Look Inside the Toolbox
 
Seven is a lucky number, so it’s fitting that Toolbox in Office usually has 
seven distinct tabs chock-full of options, ready at a moment’s notice for you 
to use. And if you’re wondering what the Toolbox is, it’s the floating tools pal-
ette that provides you with umpteen options. The exact tools you see at any 
given time are context-sensitive and vary depending upon what’s currently 
selected, what view you’re using, and which application you’re currently 
using. Figure 4-1 shows Excel’s default Toolbox when turned on in a new, 
blank workbook (access the Toolbox by clicking the Toolbox button on 
Excel’s toolbar). The title of the Toolbox displays the name of the currently 
selected tool. Each tab represents a different tool in the Toolbox palette.
Turning the Toolbox on and off is a simple matter. Click the red Close 
button in the upper left just as you would with any other Mac window or 
click the Toolbox button on the application’s Standard toolbar to toggle the 
Toolbox on and off.

If you can’t see the Toolbox, choose View➪Toolbox➪Formatting Palette or 
any of the other Toolbox tabs, as shown in Figure 4-2. You can also click the 
Toolbox button on the Standard toolbar of Word, Excel, or PowerPoint. You 
can then see the Toolbox icons across the top of the window just under the 
title bar. The leftmost icon shows the Formatting Palette, which appears by 
default.

 Much like your mechanic’s toolbox at the local auto shop, Office’s Toolbox 
is like having seven different toolboxes together, each with a custom toolset 
to take care of a specific job.
Introducing the Toolbox palettes
This chapter explores the Toolbox tabs (except for one used in Excel; see 
a little later in this section). By the time you’re done, you’ll be an expert 
mechanic, but we’re not going to give you a certificate. Not yet!
The seven tabs of Excel’s Toolbox, as shown in Figure 4-1 are
 
✦ Formatting Palette: This tab lets you apply formatting options to 
selected objects.
 
✦ Object Palette: This tab lets you add shapes, clip art, symbols, and 
photos.

✦ Formula Builder: A helpful formula tool unique to Excel that we discuss 
in Book III, Chapter 2.
 
✦ Scrapbook: This tab is the regular clipboard on steroids.
 
✦ Reference Tools: A collection of reference materials, such as a diction-
ary, a thesaurus, and more.
 
✦ Compatibility Report: Find out how compatible your presentations are 
with older PowerPoint versions on both Mac and Windows.
 
✦ Project Palette: A mini–Project Center within the Toolbox.
We explore them all except Formula Builder in this chapter. The Toolbox is 
great because it floats, so you can drag it out of the way whenever you want. 
Later, we show you how to make the Toolbox slowly fade away from your 
field of view or you can even roll up the Toolbox like a window shade. You’ll 
find this fantastic feature in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.
 
We can’t resist pointing out that Mac-only palettes make task panes in Office 
for Windows versions obsolete.
Using palettes in the Toolbox
The palettes all have different features, but essentially they work the 
same way. For this section, we’re using the Excel Formatting Palette in our 
examples, as shown in Figure 4-3. The Formatting Palettes in Word and 
PowerPoint look similar but not identical.

To use the Formatting Palette, click the disclosure triangles to expose 
and hide various palette panels (see Figure 4-3). Within each panel, you’re 
offered relevant options and actions to take, depending upon what’s 
currently selected in your document (Word), sheet (Excel), or slide 
(PowerPoint).

72
No Objections to the Object Palette
But even more is new in Office 2008. The Formatting Palette has a couple of 
really neat tricks up its sleeve, or rather on its upper-left corner. First, if you 
look closely at the top left of the Formatting Palette, you see a new button. In 
addition to the red Close button is a new green Hide button (the button with 
a small plus sign). Go ahead; give it a click, and the Formatting Palette now 
slides discreetly away so that it takes hardly any screen space.
Take a look at the top-right corner of the Formatting Palette and you see a 
tiny arrow button. Click that arrow button, and the Formatting Palette turns 
around so you can see its backside. That’s where you’ll find the Toolbox 
Settings dialog, as shown in Figure 4-4.

No Objections to the Object Palette
Russian nesting dolls are noted for their beauty and the thrill of discovering 
something smaller inside something larger. Like a nesting doll, the Object 
Palette has many sub-objects inside, categorized in various ways. As you tra-
verse the subsets of the Object Palette, you continually discover new things.
Choose View➪Toolbox➪Object Palette to toggle the Object Palette on and 
off in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. In Entourage, choose Tools➪Toolbox➪
Object Palette to toggle the palette on and off. Notice right away that you 
see four sub-tabs, each containing distinct kinds of objects, with the pop-up 
menu extended so that you can see each of the distinct sub-object choices:
 
✦ Shapes: This tab allows you to add shapes to the active document, 
sheet, or slide.
 
✦ Clip Art: From this tab, you can add cut-out images.
 
✦ Symbols: Add symbols such as keyboard controls, registered and copy-
right symbols, and so on.

✦ Photos: This displays the content of your Apple iPhoto albums. iPhoto is 
a photo-viewing and -editing program that’s part of Apple’s iLife suite of 
programs. Most new Macs include iPhoto by default.
 
You won’t see the Shapes tab in Entourage, and that’s perfectly okay as long 
as you see the Clip Art, Symbols, and Photos tabs within the application. All 
other Office programs show the Shapes tab in addition to the other three 
tabs.
Squeezing shapes
 
An audience appreciates shoring up a document with an interesting or 
instructive shape. With the Shapes tab, you can find and insert just the right 
shape and then customize its appearance. Click the Object Palette Shapes 
tab to display the built-in shapes available to you, as shown in Figure 4-5.

Drag on handle to resize window.
If you look closely at the shapes, you might notice some new ones. A brand-
new, high-tech drawing engine in Office 2008 called OfficeArt draws practi-
cally everything you see on the screen except for text.
Before you actually insert a shape, look at the shiny new Shapes tab in 
the Object Palette itself. Just below the selector tab is a pop-up menu that 
comes preset to All Shapes. Click the pop-up menu (see Figure 4-5) to see 
your options for filtering the shapes by categories, such as Basic Shapes, 
Lines and Connectors, Block Arrows, and so on (again, see Figure 4-5).
Figure 4-5: 
The Shapes 
tab of the 
Object

No Objections to the Object Palette
At the bottom edge of the Shapes tab are three little dots, which you can drag 
up and down to adjust the size of the Shapes palette. Under the three dots is a 
slider control, which you can drag left and right to zoom in on and out of the 
shapes in the palette. Lastly, you see a search field where you can type the 
shape name you’re looking for, and the search filters the shapes accordingly.
You’re probably itching to get your hands on one of these shapely shapes, 
but here’s the procedure for inserting shapes first:
 
1. Click inside your document in the approximate place you want to 
insert the shape.
 
2. In the Toolbox, select the Object Palette tab, and then select the 
Shapes palette. Click a shape in the Shapes palette.
 
3. Hold down the left mouse button and drag across the document to 
draw a shape at the size you want.
 
 Alternatively, click once on the shape in the Shapes palette and then 
once again in the document to place the selected shape.
 
4. Let go of the mouse when you’re done.
Before you start customizing your new shapes, we take a moment to point 
out some of the new features your shapes have thanks to the new OfficeArt 
drawing engine. Compared with shapes from previous Office versions, 2008 
shapes now have nice soft shadows by default and more of a 3D appearance.
Here’s some more info on manipulating shapes:
 
✦ Rotating a shape: In Excel and PowerPoint rotating a shape is accom-
plished by dragging the green dot at the top of the shape.
 
✦ Shape controls: Most shapes have one or more yellow diamonds that 
act as shape controls (see Figure 4-6), which can be dragged to alter the 
shape’s appearance.
 
✦ Resizing handles: Each shape has eight resizing handles, as shown in 
Figure 4-6. The corner handles resize the shape proportionately in the 
direction you drag whereas the other handles resize the shape by either 
altering only the width or the height.
 
✦ Adding text to shapes: Solid shapes such as circles, rectangles, and tri-
angles are secretly text boxes. If you want to add text to a solid shape, 
or edit existing text, do the following:
 
1. Right-click or Control-click the shape.
 
2. Choose Add Text or Edit Text from the pop-up menu.
 
3. Start typing.

Clamoring for clip art
No question about it: People love to decorate their documents. Art and 
graphics can add visual appeal, and there’s truth to the old expression that a 
picture’s worth a thousand words. For most documents that picture is some 
kind of clip art.
Clip art is most often small drawings or pictures added to documents for 
interest or pizzazz. The Object Palette’s new Clip Art tab specializes in this 
kind of artwork.
 
The Clip Art tab in the Object Palette is different from the Clip Art option in 
the Insert➪Picture➪Clip Art menu.
You can easily use the clip art found in the tab of the same name within the 
Object Palette. Simply drag the piece of clip art you want from the Object 
Palette into your document.
Like the Shapes tab, which we discuss earlier in this chapter, you can filter 
the type of clip art you see within the palette using a similar pop-up menu. 
Choices include All Images, Animals, Business, and so on (see Figure 4-7).
 
Clip art is great, but lots of people go through clips as if they’re free. 
Actually, most of them are! We know people who want new clips for every 
document and every possible purpose.

Figure 4-7:

Clip Art tab.
 
The Object Palette’s Clip Art tab shows only a very limited collection of pic-
tures and drawings that belong to the larger Office Online Clip Art collection, 
which includes millions of pictures, drawings, sounds, and animations. Office 
Online is a part of the Microsoft Web site, and before you launch your browser 
and start looking for the clip art, we suggest you read the rest of this section.
As the proud owner of Microsoft Office, you’re entitled to use the content 
available from Office Online:
http://office.microsoft.com
If you visit that site, you might find it entirely Windows-centric. But don’t 
worry, because all the clips that download from this site will work within 
Office applications. Also, you really don’t have to visit that site to get the 
clips, as we show you next.
You can download as many clips as you want to your computer and use them 
however you want. As long as you have a Web browser, grabbing clip art from 
Office Online is a breeze. What’s more, you can also do this from right within 
your Office application without using a web browser. Follow these steps:
 
1. From the menu of any Office application, choose Insert➪Picture➪
Clip Art.
 
 This summons the Clip Gallery (see Figure 4-8).
 
2. At the bottom of the Clip Gallery, click the Online . . . button.
 
 Your default Web browser opens and connects to the Office Online Clip 
Art tab. If your Office application asks you for permission to launch your 
default browser, click the Yes option.
 
3. Search or browse the collection by entering keywords in the Search 
text box.
 
 We don’t show you the actual interface because Microsoft updates this 
site fairly often, and the location of the Search text box may change.

4. After the search is finished, select the check boxes next to the clips 
you want to download.
 
 Unless you searched for an exotic keyword that yields no results, you’ll 
end up with some or many results. Each result is actually a thumbnail 
with a check box.
 
 As you select the check boxes in your browser, you’ll see a Selection 
Basket that shows the number of clips you have opted to download.
 
5. When you are ready to download your clips, click the Download # 
Items link.
 
6. Agree to the service agreement.
 
 You have to agree to the service agreement to download any clips. If you 
have lots of time or if you love legal gobbledygook, go ahead and read 
each word, and then accept the agreement.
 
7. Click the Download Now button.
 
 Your browser downloads the clips as a single file.
 
8. Select the Save option when you’re prompted by a dialog.
 
 The same dialog that provided the Save option also lets you choose an 
Open With option. Make sure you don’t choose Open With.

9. Make sure the saved file name has the .cil file extension.
 
 Apple Safari does it right, but you have to manually type .cil in Mozilla 
Firefox and some other browsers that save the file without the .cil 
extension.
 
10. Click the Save button and wait for the download to complete.
 
11. In the Web browser’s Download window, double-click the CIL file.
 
 This automatically loads your clips into Clip Gallery.
 
If your Web browser’s Download window is hidden or not turned on, use your 
Web browser’s menus to open the Download window. Firefox users can choose 
Tools➪Downloads, and Safari users should choose Window➪Downloads.
Now that you have your clips in Clip Gallery, you can tag your clips so that 
they can be searched, and you can categorize them so they can be filtered.
The clips you download from Office Online enter into Clip Gallery with 
default keyword tags already, and are also categorized by default into the 
Favorites category. However, you can change the categories and keyword 
tags to suit your own needs. To change the category of a clip:
 
1. Select the clip in the Clip Gallery (refer to Figure 4-8).
 
2. Click the Properties button to open the Properties window, as shown 
in Figure 4-9.
 
3. Click the Categories tab, as shown in Figure 4-9.
 
4. Select and deselect categories as desired.
 
 You can also create a new category by clicking the New Category . . . 
button. In the New Category window, type a name for your new category 
and click OK to return to the Categories tab of the Properties window.
 
5. Click OK to exit the Properties window and go back to the Clip Gallery.

Follow almost the same steps if you want to set or change the keyword tags 
for a selected clip:
 
1. Select a clip in the Clip Gallery (refer to Figure 4-8).
 
2. Click the Properties button to open the Properties window.
 
3. Click the Keywords tab to view the window that you see in Figure 4-10.

4. Add and remove keywords as desired.
 
 Any new keywords that you add with the New Keyword . . . button are 
available in the keyword list that you see in this window.
 
5. Click OK to exit the Properties window and go back to the Clip 
Gallery.
By now you’re probably wondering how to get clips from Clip Gallery into a 
document. That’s easy. Select the clip you want, and do one of the following:
 
✦ Double-click a piece of clip art. You might think that nothing hap-
pened. Actually every time you double-click a piece of clip art, it’s 
placed behind the scenes (and behind the Clip Gallery window) in your 
document. Double-click more than one piece of clip art to place them 
all the same way.
 
✦ Click the Insert button. This option exits the Clip Gallery window and 
places the piece of clip art in your document.
 
✦ Drag the piece of clip art from the Clip Gallery to your document. If 
the Clip Gallery is covering your document, you need to drag the Clip 
Gallery window a wee bit so that you can see both this window and your 
document at the same time, but the drag and drop works, especially if 
you have a large monitor!

80
No Objections to the Object Palette
 
As nice as Clip Gallery is, it’s no substitute for a full-featured media browser, 
such as Expression Media, which comes with the Media Edition of Microsoft 
Office 2008. If you have a reasonable number or photos or other digital 
assets, you might want to give Expression Media Edition a try if you have a 
reasonable number of photos or other digital assets.
Showing the way with symbols
In the old days, Mac users often growled under their breaths — and some-
times out loud — when they had to insert symbols into documents because 
the dialog required a magnifying glass. But that was then, and this is now. 
The new Symbols tab in the Object Palette of the Toolbox has come to the 
rescue. You can see it in all its glory in Figure 4-11. One particularly won-
derful improvement is that now you can control how big the symbols look 
before you commit to inserting them.
  
Size symbols with this slider.
Symbols are elegant and oh, so simple! And they’re useful, too, because you 
really need to insert things like symbols for keyboard characters, foreign lan-
guages, registered and copyright symbols, currency, and so on. Just position 
your cursor where you want the symbol inserted in your document and click 
the symbol to insert it in.
Picking the perfect photo
Having a bunch of high-quality images handy is a great thing. Maybe you have 
some CDs of stock photos that you bought years ago lying around and gath-
ering dust. Or you may have just returned from a vacation with tons of new 
high-res digital pictures. The Object Palette’s Photos tab (see Figure 4-12) can 
bring these digital photo assets to life because you can select any folder to 
populate the palette. By default, the Photos tab on the Object Palette shows 
Figure 4-11:

the content within your iPhoto folder. This is one of the ways in which Office 
coexists and adds synergies to your Mac’s built-in applications. As long as the 
iPhoto folder contains pictures in popular formats, such as JPEG, the Photos 
tab makes it easy for you to put the photos into Office documents.
 
Figure 4-12:

Photos on the Object Palette work just the way you’d expect. Drag a picture 
from the palette into a document, and there it is. After a photo is in your 
document, it’s a great time to click over to the Formatting Palette and experi-
ence the fun stuff on the Picture section. We explain more about this in the 
“Perfecting your pictures” section, later in this chapter.
One of the best resources for finding photos is the Flickr photo-sharing Web 
site. We show you a specific part of the Web site in Figure 4-13.
You have a lot of exciting ways to get high-
quality pictures, but you do always have to be 
respectful of the picture owner’s rights. We 
thank our local librarian friend for providing 
this handy link:
www.librarycopyright.net/
digitalslider
This site lets you ascertain the copyright status 
of most work available in the U.S., including 
photographs.
Libraries are great sources of images. The vast 
majority of books haven’t been digitized, and 
libraries certainly have plenty of books with 
pictures that are no longer under copyright, so 
you can scan and use them. Packages of stock 
photos are sold in computer stores and online, 
but make sure that you understand copyright 
restrictions when using these. They don’t all 
offer completely unrestricted photo use.

www.flickr.com
At Flickr, you can search through millions of photos. Almost all photos are of 
excellent quality. Flickr is a photo-sharing site — anyone who wants to can 
upload pictures into Flickr and share them with their friends or the entire 
world. When you visit Flickr for the first time, you can either use keywords 
to search for photos or you can browse through a user’s collection. Click 
any of these thumbnails to access the page for a particular picture, where a 
larger preview of the selected thumbnail appears. The secret to using Flickr 
is to click the small All Sizes button above most of the larger picture pre-
views because this allows you to find and download the picture you want in 
all available resolutions. Flickr then displays the picture, and if the owner 
of the picture allows you to, you can download the picture. To ascertain 
whether the owner allows download and use of uploaded pictures, Flickr 
uses the Creative Commons guidelines. You can read more about these 
guidelines at:
www.flickr.com/creativecommons
Follow these steps to download a picture:
 
1. Type www.flickr.com in the Web browser and then search for pictures 
by typing in the keywords for the picture subjects you want to find.
 
 You end up with pages filled with thumbnails of search results.
 
2. Click any thumbnail to get to that particular picture’s page.
 
3. Click the All Sizes button above the picture.

 If the All Sizes button isn’t available, the picture’s owner doesn’t want 
other users to download and use her pictures. In that case, look for 
another picture that does have the All Sizes button available.
 
4. When you’re ready, click Download the Large Size link (see Figure 
4-13) to save the best quality picture to your computer.

Perfecting your pictures
Getting the photos into your document is just the beginning. After you find 
the perfect picture and put it in your document, you may decide that the 
picture could look better. Here’s where the Formatting Palette comes into 
play again. The Formatting Palette is smart and provides formatting options 
based on what you have selected in your document, spreadsheet, or slide. 
Select a picture in your document, switch to the Formatting Palette (see 
Figure 4-14) in your Toolbox, and then choose from many traditional photo-
editing controls, plus some brand-new ones in Office 2008, such as
 
✦ Recolor: Changing the color of a picture affects the mood. Click the 
Recolor button, and you’ll see a menu with choices that let you add a 
duotone-like effect, or make a picture warmer or colder by changing its 
color. In addition to some beautiful preset color choices, a More Options 
submenu gives you access to your document theme colors, and still 
another nested More Color option lets you use the standard Mac OS X 
color picker so that you can choose any color you like.
 
✦ Crop: When you click the Crop tool, the picture’s border changes and 
displays several handles that you can drag inside the picture area to cut 
off the parts of the picture you don’t want to see. Click the Crop tool a 
second time to turn off the crop handles.
 
✦ Shape: If you want to make your picture stand out, you can experiment 
with the new Shape tool. You can end up using the selected picture as a 
fill for a cookie cutter shape. Imagine a picture that’s enclosed within a 
heart shape, and of course, you can play with hundreds of other shapes!
 
✦ Transparent Color: Sometimes you may want to create a see-through 
picture. If you want to create a mask or perhaps a special effect, use the 
Transparent Color tool to turn a color in the picture transparent. Here’s 
how:
 
1. With your picture selected, click the Transparent Color button on the 
Formatting Palette.
 
 The cursor changes into a pointer.
 
2. Click an area of the picture that contains the color you want to turn 
transparent.

 The color disappears from your picture. Where color was before, you 
now see through the picture. This effect may not work sometimes, 
especially with illustrated clip art, such as line drawings. However, it 
works very well with photographs.
 
✦ Brightness, Contrast, and Transparency: Fine-tuning the looks of a pic-
ture is easy with Brightness, Contrast, and Transparency controls. You 
have your choice of sliders or value controls. These controls are live, so 
you can see the changes take effect while you adjust the controls.
 
✦ Replace: The Replace button is the Oops button. Imagine you added just 
the shape you wanted and recolored the picture to the exact shade you 
like. You then realize that you needed to use another picture. Rather 
than do all the edits all over again, you can click the Replace button to 
replace the current picture with another one while preserving styles and 
certain effects.
 
✦ Effects: Don’t be afraid to click the Effects button. This Mac-only feature 
offers a totally new set of effects. See Figure 4-15. If you have a good 
graphics card, you don’t have to wait forever for the effects to draw any-
more. Many draw instantaneously now. You see these same effects in 
other Mac applications because they are generated by Mac OS X and 
therefore available to all applications. Each effect has different controls. 
Some have yellow diamonds that you can drag to control the effect’s 
centering point. (See Figure 4-15.) Yes, there are even blurs, including 
Gaussian blur!

✦ Format: Detailed formatting is available with a click of the Format 
button, as we mention earlier in this chapter. In the Format dialog, you 
can fine-tune various controls.
 
✦ Reset: Sometimes you realize you messed up the picture while format-
ting it. If you want to restore it to the way it looked when you first down-
loaded it, click the Reset button.
 
✦ Quick Styles and Effects: And just one more feature . . . You can do dra-
matic things with the Quick Styles and Effects panel in the Formatting 
Pane. You’ll find new reflection effects, 3D effects, and true rotation 
effects within this section of the palette. Enjoy!
To show you how easy it is to make changes in a picture, look at Figure 4-14. 
The original picture (top) was copied and pasted, and then we clicked one of 
the options in the Quick Styles and Effects panel (bottom). After you select 
an inserted picture, the dramatic formatting is accomplished with these 
short steps:
 
1. Select the picture you want to format.
 
2. In the Formatting Palette, access the Quick Styles and Effects panel 
and choose the Soft Edge Rectangle preset.

3. Click the Shapes button on the Formatting Palette.
 
4. In the submenu that appears, choose Basic Shapes➪Oval.
Scrapbook: The Clipboard Evolves
Every once in a while you might wonder why the Mac OS X Clipboard 
can’t remember what was on it after you restart your computer. Someone 
in Microsoft obviously wondered the same thing and came up with 
Scrapbook, a multiple-item Clipboard with a memory, as shown in Figure 
4-16. And did we mention that Scrapbook is handily accessed with a 
Toolbox tab? If you can’t see the Scrapbook tab on the Toolbox, choose 
View➪Toolbox➪Scrapbook.
To put Scrapbook to work, you have to do a little setup. A setting makes 
Scrapbook as automatic as the Mac OS X Clipboard. Here’s how to toggle 
Scrapbook’s automatic setting:
 
1. Make sure the Scrapbook tab is selected in your Toolbox.
 
 If you can’t see the Toolbox, choose the View➪Toolbox/Scrapbook.
 
2. Click the down arrow next to the big, green Add button (see Figure 
4-16) to summon a pop-up menu.
 
3. From the pop-up menu that appears, choose the Always Add Copy 
option.
 
 That’s all you need to do, and the Scrapbook setting is now set to 
automatic.

Getting Serious with Reference Tools
That’s all there is to it. Well, almost. The automatic Scrapbook setting must 
be configured individually in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Entourage, so 
you have to perform this little ritual in each application’s Scrapbook if you 
want uniform behavior throughout Office. Even though the setting isn’t 
global, the clips you put into Scrapbook are available in all the Office appli-
cations. Pop a picture into Scrapbook in Word, for example, and it’s avail-
able to you in all the other applications.
Now all you have to do is get some stuff into Scrapbook. If you follow the pre-
ceding steps, adding items to Scrapbook happens automatically every time 
you copy something in Office with the Copy command. After you have a bunch 
of clips in Scrapbook, the pop-up menu buttons at the top of the Scrapbook 
palette become useful. The Find Clips button on the top left allows you to filter 
the contents of Scrapbook by date, category, keywords, and so on. The View 
pop-up button toward the top right changes the way clips are displayed in the 
Scrapbook palette in three views: List, Detail, and Large Preview views.
You can get clips out of Scrapbook almost as easily as you can get them in. 
Here’s a quick rundown of the ways to get your selected clip out of Scrapbook:
 
✦ Press Shift-Ô-V to paste the currently selected clip in the Scrapbook 
palette into the active, open document.
 
✦ Right-click or Control-click, and choose Paste in the resultant pop-up 
menu.
 
✦ Click the Paste button on the Scrapbook palette.
 
✦ Click the triangle to the right of the Paste button for special paste 
options.
 
✦ Drag a clip from Scrapbook to a document.
If you have a special fondness for a particular clip and want to change its 
name, double-click the name of the clip and then type a name in the result-
ing input field, just like you rename anything in Mac OS X Finder. Quite a few 
people like the Organize panel of the Scrapbook palette, which lets you tag 
clips with categories and assign them to specific projects. When you assign a 
clip to a specific project, the clip gets added to the Project Center Clippings 
feature, which we discuss in Book VI, Chapter 4.
Getting Serious with Reference Tools
Going to the library is a great experience. Who doesn’t like all the books and 
journals, the people, and even that book smell? Little pleasures are there to 
be discovered, and a librarian is there to help you. Even if you don’t visit a 
library often, you’ll want to take a look at the improved Reference Tools (see 
Figure 4-17) in Office 2008. You may not need to look up the same kinds of 
things anymore, but plenty of new things are there waiting for you to find.

88
Getting Serious with Reference Tools
  
Disclosure triangle
Access Reference Tools by clicking the Reference Tools tab in the 
Toolbox. If you can’t see the Reference Tools tab in the Toolbox, choose 
View➪Toolbox/Reference Tools.
Within Reference Tools, you can access a dictionary, a thesaurus, an ency-
clopedia, and a bilingual dictionary. Here’s how: 
 
1. Type a word or phrase into the search field at the top of the Reference 
Tools tab of the Toolbox.
 
2. Click the disclosure triangles in the panels that represent the kind 
of results you want; choose from Dictionary, Thesaurus, and Encarta 
Encyclopedia.
 
3. Press Return or Enter on the keyboard to see the results.
If you’re connected to the Internet, you get your results almost instantly. 
You can select small parts of the results and drag the text into your docu-
ment. The whole thing is pretty nifty, but we couldn’t help notice and 
react to the hard sell in the Translation section, where you might often be 
invited to get a quote for a professional translation! We hope a real librarian 
would never do that. Overall, Reference Tools is a great feature, so don’t let 
that stop you. Reference Tools works only while you’re connected to the 
Internet.
 
You don’t have to type anything into the search field to use Reference Tools. 
In any document, all you have to do is right-click or Control-click a word or 
phrase, and choose Lookup or Translate from the pop-up menu. Reference 
Tools does the rest. In fact, if the desired result appears as a pop-up sugges-
tion, all you have to do is choose it to accept the suggestion.

Making Compatability Checking a Snap
Making Compatibility Checking a Snap
Hard to believe, but a lot of people are still working in organizations that 
require them to use Windows versions of Office instead of Office 2008 for 
Mac. What’s not at all hard to believe is that some of your best friends may 
still be running very capable 10-year-old Macs. Yet here you are with your 
fancy new Office 2008, making documents that might not play well with 
older, but still serviceable hardware and software.
Aside from the file compatibility issues we discuss in Chapter 1 of this mini-
book, it’s really hard to predict what you may have done in a document that 
might not look right in an older Office version. Perhaps you’re a sucker for 
soft shadows, especially in PowerPoint. Soft shadows look great on a Mac, 
and they’ve been around for years, but play the same presentation on a 
Windows PC running Office 2003, and it’s a recipe for one ugly slide show.
This is where Compatibility Report (see Figure 4-18) comes to the rescue. 
Compatibility Report knows almost every aspect of each Office version since 
Office 97 (that’s the last nine versions of Office collectively on Windows and 
Mac platforms!), and it can tell you whether things in your document might 
not play nice with an older version. Not only can Compatibility Report give 
you a report; it might be able to fix some aspects of your document so that 
what you see in Office 2008 is what your co-workers or friends see when they 
open your file in their older software.
 
Figure 4-18: 
The 
Compatibility 
Report.
 
 
Before you start using Compatibility Report, it’s a good idea to save your 
document: Choose File➪Save As and give the compatible document a new 
name. This way if you use the Fix feature, you won’t have changed your 
original document.

Peeking at Your Projects in the Project Palette
Peeking at Your Projects in the Project Palette
Artists sometimes paint from a palette that has just about every square inch 
covered with different colors and blends of colors. A palette small enough 
to fit in an artist’s hand can produce a painting as large as a wall mural. Like 
a colorful artist’s palette, the Project Palette (see Figure 4-19) gives you a 
different result just about anywhere you touch it. This feature has more 
choices per square inch of screen space than any other we can think of.
Project Palette is a succinct interface for Project Center. We recommend that 
you create a project by following the examples in Book VI, Chapter 1 where 
we thoroughly describe each of the Project Center features that are repre-
sented by the Project Palette. If you don’t already have an existing project 
and some understanding of the Project Center features, Project Palette may 
not make much sense to you. Book VI, Chapter 1 is the place to get started 
with Project Center.
The number of controls and features packed into Project Palette is 
astonishing — not even one pixel is wasted. Every tiny thing in the palette 
does something when you click it. This creates a challenge for your authors 
because it’s difficult to outline each click’s response in Figure 4-19. Almost 
every feature and action that can be taken in Project Center has been con-
densed into the Project Palette. After you have explored Book VI, we encour-
age you to click every single part of the Project Palette to explore what 
everything does. Each tiny square or dot is a button. Even the bands that 
divide its sections offer things to do when you click them. You’ll be dazzled.

Chapter 5: Graphing, Drawing, 
and Making Art
In This Chapter
✓ Introducing new graph and chart applications
✓ Graphing and charting with flair
✓ Inserting new SmartArt graphics
✓ Organizing your organization chart
✓ Learning how to create shapes and drawings
✓ Getting font-fancy with WordArt
✓ Working with layers
A
mong the many things people use Office for are creating graphs, 
charts, and other types of art. With Office 2008, you find a new engine 
under the hood that controls how Office draws things onscreen, and this 
OfficeArt is running whenever you use graphs, charts, organization charts, 
SmartArt, and WordArt. This chapter covers all the bases so that you can 
discover ways to make Office 2008’s improved features work for you.
Getting the Nitty-Gritty on Graphs and Charts
Your Mac can make pretty much any graph and can do so superbly. You’re 
especially lucky when you have a Mac coupled with Office 2008, which 
offers three superb graphing programs from which to choose. Call it an 
embarrassment of riches, call it smart planning, but whatever you call it, 
you can make amazingly beautiful and rich graphs with your Mac.
Each of the three graph applications that you have access to provides 
particular strengths that make it attractive, and we want you be able to 
choose the one that’s right for the particular graphing need you have at any 
moment. The three applications are
 
✦ Apple Grapher: This application draws graphs of mathematical 
equations.
 
✦ Elements Gallery: Create bar charts, pie charts, and other graphs from 
tabular data. This feature launches Excel chart tools from Elements 
Gallery.

92
Getting the Nitty-Gritty on Graphs and Charts
 
✦ Microsoft Graph: Similar to Elements Gallery charts, this application is 
included with Office primarily to provide backward compatibility while 
you transition to the new Excel charts.
Whenever we talk about graphs and charts, we remind you that Microsoft 
uses graph and chart interchangeably. Both refer to the same thing. We 
explore each of the applications mentioned in the following sections.
Graphing an equation with Grapher
Often people have math equations that they want to graph. In grade school, 
teachers used to foist the task of drawing graphs onto students. Today some 
teachers even require students to buy expensive graphing calculators. But 
rarely do they point their students to Grapher (see Figure 5-1), the built-in 
graphing program that comes with Mac OS X, and that’s a shame.
 
Figure 5-1: 
Examples 
of graphs in 
Grapher.
 
Use Grapher if you have an equation of some sort and want to convert it into 
a graph. Find Grapher in the Utilities folder inside the Mac OS X Applications 
folder. Although Grapher isn’t part of Microsoft Office, you can copy the 
graphs you make in Grapher and paste them into Office applications. As you 
can see in Figure 5-1, Grapher can handle a wide range of graphing tasks 
from simple line graphs all the way to calculus, and it can even animate 
graphs for you.
Graphing data using Elements Gallery
Researchers, business people, students, and others often start with a data 
set that’d be much more understandable in graphical form rather than pre-
sented as a table-like collection of data arranged in columns and rows. The 
new Charts feature in Elements Gallery specializes in turning dull data into 
eye-poppingly great graphs.

Getting the Nitty-Gritty on Graphs and Charts
Office 2008 handles graphs and charts in a completely new way. Even the 
way Office draws what you see onscreen is brand new. Also new is how you 
create a graph or chart. To make life easier for you, the tools and format-
ting options are consistent across Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. To give you 
all the power of Excel, the new default graphing application uses Excel to 
graph for other Office applications. Even if you’re creating graphs in Word 
or PowerPoint, Excel is doing it all behind the scenes. With regard to making 
spectacular looking graphs the easy way, the new graphs take full advantage 
of the new Elements Gallery and the new Office-wide themes and templates.
Graphing in Word or PowerPoint
 
In the olden days, if you wanted to help someone escape from prison, you’d 
bake a cake, embed a file in it, and give it to your imprisoned friend. Okay, 
we carried this metaphor a little too far, but the concept of embedding 
applies to graphs in Word and PowerPoint. Graphs are embedded into Word 
and PowerPoint much like a file baked in a cake. Each graph is actually an 
Excel worksheet embedded in Word or PowerPoint. You format the graph to 
make it look the way you want in Word or PowerPoint, but the data lives and 
breathes in an Excel spreadsheet.
This is important to realize because when you create a graph by clicking a 
graph type from Elements Gallery in Word or PowerPoint, the first thing you 
see is an Excel workbook with some sample data in it. Perhaps you expected 
a graph but instead you got an Excel worksheet. Don’t worry! Just drag the 
Excel window a little to the side, and underneath the Excel window, you see 
your graph is already in Word or PowerPoint. Your graph is just patiently 
waiting for you to put data into the Excel worksheet. After you paste or enter 
the data you want to replace the sample data, you can close Excel. When you 
go back to your Word or PowerPoint document, you see your new chart.
To make a chart in Word or PowerPoint, follow these steps:
 
1. On the Elements bar, click the Charts tab.
 
 If Elements Gallery isn’t visible, choose View➪Elements Gallery. The 
Elements Gallery isn’t available in all views. You may have to choose a 
different view from the View menu to be able to use Elements Gallery.
 
2. Choose your chart type by clicking any of the types in the gallery.
 
 If you can’t find an exact chart type, select one that’s closest in appear-
ance to what you want.
 
 This opens a Microsoft Excel 2008 worksheet with some sample data 
already filled in.
 
3. Enter or paste data to replace the sample data.
 
4. Close Excel to get back to Word or PowerPoint.
 
 You don’t have to save any data at this point in Excel if you’re adding a 
chart in Word or PowerPoint.

94
Getting the Nitty-Gritty on Graphs and Charts
You can make formatting changes to charts while you’re working in Word, 
Excel, or PowerPoint. We explain how to make these formatting changes a 
little later in this chapter. If you want to view or change the data upon which 
your chart is based, take one of the following actions to access your data:
 
✦ Right-click or Control-click a graph series: Move the mouse pointer 
over the chart area to see the name of the chart element that is under 
the pointer. A series is the data in a column or row represented by a bar, 
area, line, or other graphical element of a chart
 
✦ Choose Edit Data from the pop-up menu (as shown in Figure 5-2): This 
brings up the Microsoft Excel data worksheet for this chart, and you can 
change or edit data as required. You can also increase or decrease the 
number of series and categories.
 
Figure 5-2: 
Choose Edit 
Data from 
the pop-up 
menu in

Graphing in Excel
In this section, we discuss how to create a graph or chart from scratch when 
you are starting from Excel (not Word or PowerPoint). Excel is so smart at 
times, it’s almost scary. For example, Excel can take your data and convert 
it into a beautiful chart that you can customize in your worksheet. Follow 
these steps:
 
1. Select any cell within a continuous row and column data set in Excel.
 
 See Book III, Chapter 1 for tips for working in worksheets.
 
2. On the Elements bar, click the Charts tab.
 
 If Elements Gallery isn’t visible, choose View➪Elements Gallery. If 
Elements Gallery isn’t available, choose a different view from the View 
menu.
 
3. Click the chart type you want.
 
 If you can’t find the exact chart type you want, select the one closest in 
appearance. After you select your chart type, Excel places your chart in 
the current worksheet.

Getting the Nitty-Gritty on Graphs and Charts
Excel has a special kind of worksheet — a chart sheet, which is just a sheet 
completely dedicated just to the presentation of your chart but is linked to 
the data on your worksheet. For more information about chart locations, see 
Book III, Chapter 5. To move a chart to or from a chart sheet, do the following:
 
1. Click anywhere in the chart within your worksheet. 
 
 As soon as a chart is selected, the menu bar shows a new menu option: 
Chart.
 
2. From the Chart menu, choose the Move Chart option.
 
 The Move Chart dialog opens, as shown in Figure 5-3.
 
Figure 5-3: 
Moving 
charts in 
Excel.
 
 
3. Choose where you want to put the chart.
 
 As you can see in Figure 5-3, you have two choices:
 
a. Save as a chart in a new chart sheet.
 
b. Save as a chart object in one of the existing sheets.
 
4. Click OK.
Formatting charts in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint
If you’ve started a chart, you’re probably a bit proud of yourself for doing 
it so quickly and easily. However, your chart might be very plain-looking 
at this stage, but you’re using a Mac, and Mac users are noted for making 
graphics look outstanding. A Mac user can’t be satisfied with just a default 
graph. People will think you’re using Windows, which would just be embar-
rassing. (Okay, one of this book’s authors uses Windows a lot, but he’s going 
to leave that statement alone and let Mac users feel superior anyway!)
Get excited about the new chart-formatting options available in Office 2008. 
The new options are almost like taking your chart to a department store and 
letting it try on new clothes. The following headings show you ways you can 
customize how your chart looks.

96
Getting the Nitty-Gritty on Graphs and Charts
Changing chart types with Elements Gallery
You can easily change the chart type just by clicking a new chart type in 
Elements Gallery. If you don’t like the type, try on another. Try various chart 
types and pick the one that you think best represents your data.
Formatting chart elements with the Formatting Palette
The Formatting Palette is your friend when formatting charts and graphs. Be 
sure it’s turned on by clicking its tab in the Toolbox. If the Toolbox isn’t vis-
ible, click the Toolbox button on the Standard toolbar.
One thing you’ll notice right away is that if you’re following along on your 
computer, you have to click the Formatting Palette’s disclosure triangles to 
expose and hide various sections of the Formatting Palette. The palette and 
its various panes are simply too long to fit onto the screen all at once. The 
number of panes you can display at one time is determined by the size of 
your screen and its resolution. It took three figures (see Figures 5-4, 5-5, and 
5-6) just to show you all the panes!
 
The Formatting Palette changes depending upon what chart element is 
selected at any given moment and the formatting options you have applied, 
so your palette will probably never exactly match the figures in this section.
Starting at the top and working our way down the palette, here we go!
Select different elements of your chart and then explore the available 
options on the Formatting Palette. We encourage you to create a chart and 
experiment with the various options in the Formatting Palette to see what 
the controls do. We start at the top of the Formatting Palette and work our 
way down, describing each section as we move down the palette.
 
✦ Font: This section appears only when text is selected.
 
✦ Alignment and Spacing: As with Font, this section appears only when 
text is selected.
 
✦ Number: This pop-up menu lets you select the format of numbers. It 
appears only when text and/or numbers are selected.
 
✦ Chart Options: This is further divided into these sections:
 
• Titles: From the pop-up menu, you can choose the entire graph, 
the horizontal (X) axis, or the vertical (Y) axis. Use the input field 
located beneath the pop-up to enter a title for the item chosen in the 
pop-up menu.

• Sort By: This button on the Formatting Palette does the same thing as 
the Switch Row/Column button does in the Chart Data Source dialog.
 
• Data Table: This feature lets you display the data range in the chart 
area. The pop-up is None by default, but you can choose to display 
the source data right on the chart either with or without a legend. 
This can be useful if your chart’s on a chart sheet. If your chart’s on 
a worksheet, you may have to drag the chart box to make it larger if 
it appears to be jumbled.
 
 After you select an element on a graph, repeatedly press the left arrow 
(←) or right arrow (→) key on your keyboard to cycle through the graph 
so that you can select format individual elements for formatting.
 
✦ Chart Style: Getting dramatic effects for your graph data is amazingly 
simple to do in the Chart Style section of the Formatting Palette. Some 
really nifty styles have black backgrounds for the latest look. Click a 
style to apply it to a chart.
 
✦ Quick Styles and Effects: But that’s not all! In the Formatting Palette, 
find the Quick Styles and Effects section (as shown in Figure 5-8). Before 
you start clicking the options, remember that the style you click is 
applied to whatever you’ve currently selected. For example, if you click 
the background that surrounds the chart, your style will be applied to 
the outer background of the chart. If you click a bar or pie section, that’s 
what the formatting will be applied to. In certain chart types, notice that 
different parts of the chart are selected when you click a second time on 
a chart element, such as a bar or a pie slice.

these as desired.

✦ Document Theme: Apply themes and save them from this portion of the 
Formatting Palette. We have a full discussion of themes in Chapter 6 of 
this minibook.
 
Users of previous versions of Office may notice commands have been 
rearranged on the Formatting Palette. Some options have moved to new or 
different sections and subdivisions.
Applying multiple formatting options
Alright, now have some fun and discover even more ways to format charts. 
First, some chart types let you drag slices of your chart. For example, in a 
3D pie chart, you can grab individual slices and pull them out. Next, you can 
apply various formatting options in succession to achieve highly customized 
results. For example, when you turn on the shadow control and add a nice 
blur, you really bring out the pie slices. See Figure 5-9 where we applied the 
following formats to a 3D pie chart to make quite a striking difference!
 
1. First we selected the piece of the chart labeled B and then dragged that 
slice of the pie away from the center.
 
2. We selected an attractive document theme from the Document Themes 
on the Formatting Palette.
 
 We cover themes in more detail in Chapter 6 of this minibook.
 
3. We selected the entire pie and then used the Shadow control on the 
Formatting Palette to give the pie a nice soft shadow.
 
 You may be able to make out the shadow settings we used in Figure 5-9, 
but even if you can’t, be sure to experiment with the Shadow controls on 
your own.
 
4. We used the Chart Options section of the Formatting Palette to toggle off 
the grid lines.

Discovering even more chart-formatting options
Amazing, isn’t it? There’s so much stuff you can do to make your charts look 
their best! The Formatting Palette allows you to do most of the formatting 
you need, but if you’re really hard-core and want absolute control over your 
graph’s fine-tuning, you can still do more. Follow these steps:
 
1. Right-click or Control-click the chart area.
 
2. From the pop-up menu that appears, choose Format Chart Area or 3-D 
Rotation.
 
 Either way, the Format Chart Area dialog opens (see Figure 5-10).

Each section of the Format Chart Area dialog allows minute fine-tuning of 
every aspect of every element of your graph.
Graphing the old-fashioned way in Microsoft Graph
Right about now, a few of you might be thinking, “Bah! Humbug to all 
this change!” Maybe you tried using some of Office 2008’s new features, 
but the inability to twirl 3D bar graphs like a baton has you discouraged 
about all things “new.” Or maybe you miss true old-fashioned vector-based 
patterns (like earlier Excel versions had); for many, they’re essential for 
publishing graphs.

Getting the Nitty-Gritty on Graphs and Charts
Aside from your personal preference in how you edit graphs or charts, 
another reason you might want the old charts back may be because you 
need to share files with users who are using older versions of Office, and 
they can’t edit the graphs you send them!
Well, we have good news: The old interface is alive and well in Office 2008. 
Microsoft Graph (as shown in Figure 5-11) is still available just like it was in 
previous versions, and it sports the same old interface.
 
Figure 5-11: 
Old school 
with 
Microsoft 
Graph.
 
 
Although Graph is still around for backward-compatibility reasons (so that 
charts made in older Office Graph versions continue to work in Office 2008), 
its future isn’t promising. During the Office 2008 development, Microsoft 
made a huge investment in Excel graphing but didn’t make any improve-
ments to Microsoft Graph. The writing appears to be on the wall.
For the time being, Mr. and Mrs. Procrastinator and those frustrated by the 
new 3D charts can still use Graph. Here’s how you get to Graph from Word, 
Excel, and PowerPoint:
 
1. From the main menu, choose Insert➪Object➪Microsoft Graph Chart.
 
2. Click OK.
 
 Microsoft Graph opens, and you can get busy creating your chart here. 
You’ll miss all the cool effects that the new charting improvements in 
Office 2008 provide, but the upside is that your charts will be backward 
compatible with older versions of Office, both on Mac and Windows.

Making an Organization Chart with SmartArt Graphics
Making an Organization Chart 
with SmartArt Graphics
If you like the new look of charts in Office 2008, wait until you come face 
to face with new OfficeArt and see how it improves the appearance of dia-
grams. And that brings us to a quick question: How are charts and diagrams 
different? The easy answer is that whereas graphs crunch numbers and 
percentages and represent data values as points on a graph, diagrams show 
logical relationships, such as President, Vice-President, and Secretary of 
State. Another example of a diagram would show the relationships among 
parent, child, and sibling.
Like a new engine in your car makes it run a lot better, this new engine 
makes Office 2008 run better. One aspect of the new Office-wide engine is 
SmartArt Graphics. With the new SmartArt Graphics feature, you have lots 
of choices and many new customization features for everything that appears 
as a graphic onscreen. And yes, these graphics are smart, as you see in this 
section!
Organizing the organization chart
Usually you show who’s in charge within an organization with an organi-
zation chart (as shown in Figure 5-12). With SmartArt Graphics, you can 
produce visually interesting organization charts, so everybody knows 
exactly who employees report to. The place to find the completely new 
and improved Organization Chart feature is the leftmost position of the 
Hierarchy graphics on the SmartArt tab of Elements Gallery.

Making an Organization Chart with SmartArt Graphics
You don’t have to be nervous anymore about trying to get the little boxes 
all lined up and having problems with connecting the lines in a clean and 
sensible way. If you’ve ever made an org chart in older versions of Office, 
you’ll appreciate how SmartArt Graphics allows you to drag, drop, resize, 
and format the way you’d expect to. Getting an organization chart is now 
easier — follow these steps:
 
1. Click the SmartArt Graphics tab of the Elements bar.
 
 The Elements Gallery opens. If the Elements bar isn’t visible, choose 
View➪Elements Gallery.
 
2. Click the Hierarchy category and then click the first item, 
Organization Chart.
 
 A new organization chart is placed in your document (Word), sheet 
(Excel), or slide (PowerPoint).
 
3. Replace the text in organization chart rectangles with your own text 
by clicking inside the rectangles and typing, or by entering text in the 
Text pane.
You can work freely both in the Text pane and in the chart. You can turn the 
Text pane on and off by clicking the Text Pane button (see Figure 5-12). We 
take a look at how to work with the Text pane and then cover how to work 
within the chart. Notice that in this version of Organization Chart, Assistant 
has replaced Subordinate.
Working in the Text pane
Here are some tips for working in the Text pane:
 
✦ Replace the default text placeholders with your own text.
 
✦ The text in the lines of the Text pane is synchronized automatically with 
the shapes in the organization chart.
 
✦ Each time you press Return or Enter at the end of a line in the Text pane, 
an Assistant rectangle is created.
 
✦ Select a line of text; then click the Promote and Demote buttons to 
change the relationships.
 
✦ To add a new rectangle, click the Add Rectangle button (the one with 
the green plus symbol next to the Demote button).
 
✦ To remove a rectangle, select it in the chart and then click the red Delete 
Rectangle button, which is the minus sign – next to the right of the Add 
Rectangle button.

106
Creating Your Own Shapes
Working with Organization Chart
An organization chart is the graphical representation of relationships 
between positions, roles, and/or people. Now you can easily drag the shapes 
around, which is a vast improvement over previous versions of Organization 
Chart where this was nearly impossible. Here are some of the things you can 
do inside the chart:
 
✦ Click a rectangle to select it. You can add, edit, and delete text while a 
rectangle is selected. These shapes behave like ordinary text boxes, so 
you can also apply formatting to a shape while it’s selected.
 
✦ Drag shapes and the relationship lines are maintained.
 
✦ Add Assistants. You can add Assistants (subordinates) using the Org 
Chart pop-up on the SmartArt Graphics Styles section of the Formatting 
Palette.
 
✦ To delete a shape, select it and then press the Delete key.
 
✦ Change relationships. To change the relationships, click the relation-
ship lines to select them and then use the Org Chart pop-up on the 
SmartArt Graphics Styles section of the Formatting Palette to set the 
desired relationship. Experiment with this after you add Assistants 
to see how it works. The trick is to be sure that relationship lines are 
selected instead of the boxes.
Formatting your organization chart
Click the border of your OfficeArt-based chart to select the entire chart. 
Notice that the Formatting Palette offers a new section — SmartArt Graphic 
Styles — in addition to the other sections. Have fun experimenting with the 
Styles and Colors tabs.
Creating Your Own Shapes
You’ll feel like a kid in a candy store as you explore the explosion of new 
SmartArt shapes in Elements Gallery. Each of them can be customized and 
formatted in endless ways so that you can get just the right look. Be sure 
to experiment with them all. Right-click or Control-click individual shapes 
and then choose Format Shape from the pop-up menu to fine-tune the shape 
precisely. Make sure you pay attention to the Formatting Palette at all times 
because options in this corner of the Toolbox change dynamically to reflect 
whatever’s selected in your document, sheet, or slide.
Even with the plethora of new shapes to choose from in Elements Gallery, 
you may have a hankering for some good old-fashioned simple shapes, or 
maybe you want to try your hand at creating your own shapes.

Creating Your Own Shapes
Early in Chapter 4 of this minibook, we discuss the Shapes panel of the 
Object Palette in Toolbox. There you find the traditional shapes. Mixed in 
with the shapes are three special tools that you can use to create your own 
lines and shapes. The three most interesting of all of the tools in this section 
are Curve, Freeform, and Scribble.
Making a curvy line
Try using the Curve tool first, and after you get the hang of that one, try 
Freeform and Scribble. For our examples here, we focus on the Curve tool:
 
1. From the main menu, choose View➪Toolbox➪Object Palette.
 
2. Click the Shapes panel and then choose Lines and Connectors from 
the drop-down list (see Figure 5-13).
  
Object Palette
Shapes
Lines and Connectors
Curve Tool
 
3. Click the Curve tool.
 
 The Curve tool is the one that looks like a handwritten S (see Figure 
5-13). When you select the Curve tool, the cursor changes into a plus 
sign (+) to signify it’s ready to start drawing a line as soon as you drag in 
the document.
 
4. Drag a line into your document and click the mouse button as you 
drag; then drag the line in another direction and click again.
 
 Your line continuously gets longer as you move the cursor around, until 
you double-click the mouse, which signifies the end of the line you’re 
drawing. Each time you click while you drag, you create a point, which 
behaves as an axis for your line’s curves.

Curve tool in

Creating Your Own Shapes
This sort of drawing creates Bézier curves, as shown in Figure 5-14. Don’t 
worry too much about where the name Bézier comes from, but do remember 
that this is the same technology that forms the foundations of mighty draw-
ing programs, such as Adobe Illustrator and the like!
 
Figure 5-14: 
A wavy line 
and a solid 
shape.
 
Drawing a solid shape
By doing a variation on the steps in the preceding section to create a curvy 
line, you can end at the same point you started and then double-click at 
the end the line, which results in a closed path. When you create a loop, or 
closed path, you get a solid shape, as shown in the right side of Figure 5-14.
Formatting your lines and shapes
Now the fun begins. After you draw a line or a solid shape, right-click or 
Control-click your line or shape and choose Format Shape in the pop-up 
menu.
If you right-click or Control-click a solid shape, it can be formatted with the 
Format Shape dialog. You can apply the new gradient fills that we discuss in 
Book IV, Chapter 3. If you simply select a line or solid shape, you have many 
formatting options offered to you on the Formatting Palette.
 
Lines and curves can be formatted with arrow and dot beginnings and end-
ings, making the Curve tool ideal for drawing arrows and pointers to meet 
any need. Look for the Arrows section on the Formatting Palette whenever 
you select a line, and then Choose Style Begin and Style End options to 
format the beginning and ending points of your line.
 
If you know the name of a shape or line, you can use the Search box to find 
shape and line types easily.

Editing points on a line or shape
For the ultimate in precision control of your lines and shapes:
 
1. Right-click or Control-click your line or shape.
 
2. Choose Edit Points from the pop-up menu to display the Edit Points 
menu, as shown in Figure 5-15.
 
 You get the same menu if you’re working with a line.
 
Figure 5-15: 
Editing a

When Edit Points is active, you can drag, add, and delete points as well as 
control exactly how the line behaves while it passes through each point. 
There’s still more! Right-click or Control-click right on top of a point. Notice 
the little handles that appear at the point, as shown in Figure 5-16. Drag the 
handles to control how the line passes through the point.

Making an Impression with WordArt
It’s easier than ever to turn plain text into a work of art. The WordArt feature 
allows you to draw attention to the look of text as well as to the text itself, so 
be judicious in its use. If your purpose is to shout, WordArt can help you do 
that, but in most cases, WordArt can turn your text into something beautiful.

Creating WordArt
To use WordArt in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint:
 
1. Click the WordArt button on the Elements bar of Elements Gallery.
 
 The WordArt button is immediately to the right of the SmartArt Graphics 
button (refer to Figure 5-12).
 
2. Click one of the styles in the Gallery.
 
 A text box opens.
 
3. Type some text in the text box, as shown in Figure 5-17.
Formatting WordArt
If you have the time, you can get some really spectacular results by explor-
ing the secrets of WordArt. In Figure 5-17, you see a little diamond beneath 
the letter e in get. In WordArt, you can drag the diamond to change the 
WordArt shape.

Here are some other ways to format WordArt while the WordArt text box is 
selected:
 
✦ Click a different WordArt style button on the WordArt tab in Elements 
Gallery.
 
✦ Apply any available formatting from the hundreds of options available to 
you on the Formatting Palette.
 
✦ Double-click the border of the WordArt text box and choose from the 
options in the Format Shape dialog.
 
✦ Right-click or Control-click the WordArt text box, and then choose 
Convert to SmartArt to radically change the nature of the text box. You’ll 
have to select a SmartArt graphic from Elements Gallery, which changes 
automatically to SmartArt when you choose this option.

Working in Layers
When it comes to formatting WordArt, Word offers formatting options and 
tools that are different from Excel and PowerPoint. You’d think there was a 
contest to see which set of formatting tools is better, and the decision was 
to go with both. In all three applications (Word, Excel, and PowerPoint), you 
can use the Formatting Palette to apply changes immediately to selected 
WordArt, and you can also right-click or Control-click, and then choose 
Format WordArt from the pop-up menu. So don’t be worried when you see 
that Word’s formatting tools appear to be completely different from Excel’s 
and PowerPoint’s. The formatting options are very different in Word.
Working in Layers
When you sit in a theater to watch a show production, the experience is very 
three-dimensional. As you sit facing the stage, your depth perception tells 
you that the objects placed closer to you appear larger, and objects that 
appear far away are generally smaller. Behind all these objects is the back-
ground. Sometimes it’s a set, and sometimes it’s just a curtain. Now while 
you sit in front of your computer, Office documents offer the same sort of 3D 
experience.
Starting at the back
Everything you see in Office is on a layer. Some things are closer to you than 
others. The layer that’s furthest to the back is the background layer.
Whether it’s Word, Excel, PowerPoint, or even an HTML e-mail in Entourage, 
there’s a background layer that’s like the back wall of a stage. This back-
ground layer is a thing unto itself that can be formatted independently, and 
everything else is in front of it. The background is accessed by the following 
four methods:
 
✦ Word: Choose Format➪Background.
 
✦ Excel: Choose Format➪Sheet➪Background.
 
✦ PowerPoint: Choose Format➪Slide Background.
 
✦ Entourage: Choose Format➪Background Color.
Moving on to the layers on top
The next layer closest to you from the background is the text layer; and any 
additional objects, such as pictures, WordArt, shapes, or text boxes that are 
added are placed in layers closer to you with each additional object. Except 
for HTML mail, you can control the order of the layers of selected objects, 
and you can group objects together in the Formatting Palette in the Size, 
Rotation, and Ordering section.

112
Working in Layers
You’ll find that layers on top of other layers can make it hard to see every-
thing sometimes. A shape can be on top of a picture, for example, and the 
shape can hide all or part of the picture. In Book II, Chapter 7, we explain 
how to control text flow in Microsoft Word so that shapes can be in front, in-
line, or behind text. Realizing that objects are on layers helps when you read 
Book IV, Chapter 7 when you set up custom animations in PowerPoint.
In Figure 5-18, we finally answer the age old question: “Why did the chicken 
cross the road?” The answer, of course, is to be the top layer in our 
PowerPoint slide! In this figure, the road is the background to a PowerPoint 
slide. On top of the road are two text boxes. On top of the two text boxes is a 
SmartArt object. The chicken is at the front of everything.

Chapter 6: Common Tools That 
Make Your Life Easier
In This Chapter
✓ Checking your spelling and grammar
✓ Working on your themes and templates
✓ Creating your own document themes
✓ Saving your work in various formats
✓ Equating figures and formulas with Equation Editor
✓ Programming and automating options
T
his chapter covers an eclectic collection of tools shared by Office 2008 
applications, ranging from everyday features, such as spell check-
ing, themes, and styles to specialized tools, such as Equation Editor, 
AppleScript, and Automator.
Proofing Your Spelling and Grammar
Fat fingers get a lot of the blame for spelling errors, and good grammar is as 
much a good habit as it is a skill. Clear communication with the right words, 
correct spelling, and richer command over language is essential at home, 
office, or school.
Running spelling and grammar checks
As we mention in Chapter 3 of this minibook, spelling errors are indicated 
by a red squiggly line under the misspelled word. You can rectify such 
errors by Control-clicking or right-clicking the word, and then choosing the 
correct spelling from the resulting pop-up menu. With the same procedure, 
you can also get help with grammar by Control-clicking or right-clicking 
words with green squiggly lines in Microsoft Word. Office 2008 also has 
AutoCorrect, which fixes spelling errors for you while you type; it’s excellent, 
but you still need to know your homonyms because spelling and grammar 
can’t tell the difference between words such as to, two, and too.

114
Proofing Your Spelling and Grammar
Even with all the squiggles, you might accidently overlook an error. A good 
idea is to always run the spell and grammar checkers before you share a 
document with someone. The most common way to fire up the spell and 
grammar checker is
 
✦ In Word, choose Tools➪Spelling and Grammar.
 
 Notice Word has both spell and grammar checking, but other Office 
applications have only spell checking.
 
✦ In Excel, PowerPoint, and Entourage, choose Tools➪Spelling (see 
Figure 6-1).
 
In this chapter, we focus on aspects of spell checking that all the Office 
applications have in common. Be sure to visit Book II, Chapter 4 for details 
about spell and grammar checking; AutoText details are in Book II, Chapter 
6; AutoCorrect settings are explained in detail in Book IV, Chapter 5; and dic-
tionaries are covered in Book II, Chapter 4.
 
Figure 6-1: 
Spell 
checking in 
PowerPoint.
 
Controlling the AutoCorrect feature
Every word you type is compared with at least two lists of words. One list 
is Word’s built-in Dictionary, and the other is Word’s built-in AutoCorrect 
list. You have control over both lists. For example, you can customize your 
dictionary however you want, and you can add additional dictionaries. You 
can even make your own dictionary in Word. If you want to create your own 
dictionary, check out the Create Dictionaries topic in Word’s Help feature. In 
addition to regular dictionaries, you can create a dictionary to exclude from 
spell check so that it doesn’t flag misspelled words when more than one 
spelling is acceptable, such as color and colour.
The mysterious blue flash that briefly underlines a word after you mistype 
for a second or two is AutoCorrect at work. This flash is Office’s way of alert-
ing you that what you typed was changed automatically based on a rule in 
the AutoCorrect preferences. Most people like the way AutoCorrect works

by default, but it drives some people crazy to have their typing “corrected” 
for them in ways they don’t want. If that sounds like something that irritates 
you as well, go to the menu bar, and choose Tools➪AutoCorrect to get at 
these preferences, as shown in Figure 6-2.

the following:
 
1. Click the Exceptions button in the Preferences dialog, as shown in 
Figure 6-2.
 
 The AutoCorrect Exceptions dialog opens, as shown in Figure 6-3.
 
2. Type your abbreviation in the Don’t Correct box, click Add, and then 
click OK (see Figure 6-3).

Configuring spelling and grammar preferences
Whenever you see green squiggly lines (in Word only), the grammar checker 
suggests you revise your words. Like AutoCorrect, the grammar checker has 
plenty of interesting settings. To get at these settings, do the following:
 
1. In Word, choose Preferences and under the heading Authoring and 
Proofing Tools, click the Spelling and Grammar button.
 
 The Spelling and Grammar Preferences dialog appears, as shown in 
Figure 6-4.
 
2. Be sure that the Check Grammar as You Type check box is selected in 
the Grammar section of the dialog (see Figure 6-4).
 
3. Choose other grammar settings as desired.
 
 For most people, we suggest checking all the boxes.
 
4. Choose a writing style.
 
 Click the pop-up menu and choose one of the following styles:
 
• Casual
 
• Standard
 
• Formal
 
• Technical
 
• Custom
 
5. Click the Settings button to fine-tune the selected writing style or 
create a custom writing style.

Understanding Themes and Templates
Office has various ways that you can save formatting and document infor-
mation so that it can be reused easily. Among the available file formats you 
can use to open new documents are templates and themes. We discuss tem-
plates and themes throughout this book, but here we wish to introduce you 
to these two concepts.
 
Themes can store a lot of information. The general idea of a theme is that 
you can maintain a consistent look for your documents by applying a font 
family and color formatting from a particular theme. Themes can be applied 
to Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, and PowerPoint presentations. 
Office comes with built-in themes, and you can edit and save your own 
themes.
Figure 6-4: 
The spelling 
and 
grammar 
settings in 
Word.

118
Understanding Themes and Templates
If you use Project Gallery to open a new document based on a theme, a new 
PowerPoint presentation opens with the theme that you select, even if the 
theme you chose was created by Word or Excel. PowerPoint is a special case 
in this regard because it has the most complete implementation of the entire 
theme concept. We expect that future versions of Word and Excel will have 
more theme-aware possibilities.
Themes can be saved from Word, Excel, or PowerPoint. When a theme has 
been saved from PowerPoint, it can have much more than just a font family 
and a color scheme. PowerPoint themes can include the formatting and con-
tent on slide masters and layout masters. We discuss slide and layout mas-
ters in detail in Book IV, Chapter 4, so for now just be aware that PowerPoint 
lets you put a lot more stuff in your themes than Word or Excel.
Themes can be applied and saved with the Formatting Palette in Word, 
Excel, and PowerPoint. In PowerPoint, slide themes are applied with 
Elements Gallery. We refer you to Book IV for more details about themes in 
PowerPoint.
You might think of themes as a sort of super style. For example, if you 
applied a text style in Word and then applied a document theme, the 
theme’s font will override the text style. If you were to apply a QuickStyle to 
a shape in PowerPoint, when you apply a document theme, the QuickStyle 
is overridden. Even if you don’t know what QuickStyles and shapes are, 
just remember that document themes can override other formatting that’s 
applied already.
We want to point out some noteworthy quirks about the behavior of 
themes. Themes don’t work the same way in each application. Themes can 
be applied to different elements depending upon which application you’re 
using. Here are some of the differences:
 
✦ Word: After you apply a style to text, themes can be used to change the 
styled text’s appearance. Themes don’t affect AutoShapes or WordArt. 
Themes do affect QuickTables.
 
✦ Excel: This is almost the opposite of Word. Styled text isn’t affected by 
themes, but AutoShapes, Graphs, and Charts do take on theme format-
ting. Tables and lists aren’t affected by themes.
 
✦ PowerPoint: You can apply themes to almost everything in PowerPoint.
 
✦ Office 2008: Themes can be applied only to newer file formats such as 
DOCX, XLSX, and PPTX. If you open an older DOC, XLS, or PPT file, you 
won’t find the Document Theme section in the Formatting Palette!

To apply a theme to the current document, all you need to do is to click one 
of the document themes. This is slightly different in PowerPoint, where you 
use Elements Gallery as we discuss in Book IV, Chapter 3.
To use a different color scheme, click the Colors control on the Formatting 
Palette. A pop-up menu will be displayed, and you can select a different 
theme color scheme from the pop-up. See Figure 6-6.

As you work in Office applications, you’ll most likely decide to format the 
colors of various things, such as text boxes, WordArt, Shapes, chart ele-
ments, and more. In various dialogs and on the Formatting Palette, you’re 
presented with a color palette that looks like Figure 6-7.

The colors in the top row are the actual Theme Colors currently applied to the 
active document. The rows and columns of colors beneath the Theme Colors 
are lighter (tints) and darker (shades) values of those colors so that you can 
apply variations but still stay within your basic Theme Colors palette.
Saving your own theme
It’s quite easy to make your own document themes. When you have colors 
and fonts formatted the way you like them, use the Document Theme section 
of the Formatting Palette (refer to Figure 6-5). Here are the steps to take:

 Themes use the .thmx file extension.
 
4. Click the Save button to finish saving your theme.
Themes that are saved in the My Themes folder can be used by Project 
Gallery to open new PowerPoint presentations based upon theme colors 
and font families. Themes saved in this location also become available in 
the Formatting Palette, but you have to quit the application and then reopen 
it before you see freshly saved themes in the Formatting Palette. If you 
save themes in the My Themes subfolders, they become available to use in 
PowerPoint’s Elements Gallery on the Slide Theme tab.

Saving Everything as a Template
Getting to know more about themes
In Book IV, Chapter 3, we explain how you can set precise colors for each of 
the color blocks of a document theme. For even more information complete 
with a practice document, you can take a free, online course about themes. 
To take the course:
 
 1. Open PowerPoint and click the Help button (the question mark) on 
the Standard toolbar.
 
2. Search for themes.
 
3. Select the Design Great Looking Documents with Themes topic.
 
4. Click the big Start Course button.
Saving Everything as a Template
A template is a special file that remains unchanged when you open it. When 
you open a template, a copy of the template is opened with a new filename 
so that the template file itself remains unchanged. That way you can reuse 
the template repeatedly. When you save a document as a template from 
Word, Excel, or PowerPoint, your document is saved with the entire con-
tents intact as a Word, Excel, or PowerPoint template. A template includes 
everything, such as the document’s words, formatting, objects, pictures, 
graphs, charts, and content. Typically, people save a document that has 
room for additional content, such as a business letterhead, as a template.
Project Gallery has many built-in templates. You can also make your own 
templates for Project Gallery’s My Templates category. The following section 
explains how to create your own templates.
 
The letter t in the file extensions .dotx, .xltx, and .potx alerts you that 
you’re creating a template.
You can easily save Word, Excel, or PowerPoint files as templates in the My 
Templates folder. Here’s a step-by-step procedure to follow:
 
1. Create a document that has all the basic formatting you want to reuse
 
 For example, a letterhead document in Microsoft Word.
 
2. From the File menu, choose File➪Save As.
 
 The Save As dialog appears, as shown in Figure 6-9.
 
3. Type a filename for your template in the Save As text box.
 
4. In the Format drop-down list, choose the appropriate template and 
then click the Save button.

Sharing Files in Other Formats
 
 Depending upon which application you’re using to create the template, 
the appropriate Format is one of the following:
 
• Word Template (.dotx)
 
• Excel Template (.xltx)
 
• PowerPoint Template (.potx)
 
To make it easy for you, Office automatically saves your template in the My 
Templates folder by default, which is convenient for most users. If your Save 
As dialog looks a lot different from Figure 6-9, click the Show/Hide Full Dialog 
toggle button, which is the triangle to the right of the Save As field. That 
changes your screen’s appearance to match ours. For those who want to use 
alternative locations for templates, we explain how to do this in detail when 
we discuss Project Gallery’s settings at the end of Chapter 2 in this minibook.

Sharing Files in Other Formats
Although Office uses the latest XML file formats, not everyone has the 
latest version of Microsoft Office. Office programs offer various file formats; 
choose File➪Save As➪[Format] to accommodate various compatibility 
needs. We feature examples specific to each application in other minibooks.
Saving as an Adobe PDF
 
Adobe’s Portable Document Format (PDF) has long been a popular way to 
distribute documents, especially to people who don’t have Microsoft Office. 
Figure 6-9: 
Saving a file 
as a Word 
template.

124
Sharing Files in Other Formats
PDF documents keep the look and feel of the original document even if the 
recipient doesn’t have the needed fonts. You can also use PDFs to make it 
less convenient for others to edit a document.
 
One great new development in Office 2008 is that you no longer have to 
go through the Print dialog to make a PDF. Now you can choose File➪
Save As➪PDF.
Saving as a Web page
A few years ago this was a really hot feature. You can turn your documents 
into Web pages that can be uploaded to a Web server to be delivered via a net-
work or on the Internet. Although you can still do this, Google Docs and other 
online office products made Web-saving capabilities in Office almost obsolete.
Saving as a 97 to 2004 document
This is the format to use if you know your recipient has an older version 
of Microsoft Office or other older software products that know .doc, 
.xls, and .ppt file extensions. Before saving in this format, be sure to run 
Compatibility Report. You find this tool in the Toolbox:
 
1. If the Toolbox isn’t visible, click the Toolbox button on the Standard 
toolbar.
 
2. Click the Compatibility Report button (see Figure 6-10).

Getting Mathematical with Equation Editor
Teachers, students, scientists, and other academicians need occasionally 
to represent numeric equations that ordinarily aren’t possible to type from 
the keyboard. The solution to this dilemma is Equation Editor, which comes 
with Office 2008. Equation Editor (see Figure 6-11) works in Word, Excel, and 
PowerPoint. Equation Editor included with Microsoft Office lets you type 
mathematical symbols and equations; it’s made by Design Science. Equation 
Editor is a light version of MathType, which has more symbols and fonts. For 
information about the complete MathType package, please visit the Design 
Science Web site:

Equation Editor to make additional edits to your object, just double-click 
the Equation Editor object in the document.
Programming and Automation Options
Not having Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) as standard with Office 
2008 is no doubt a problem for many Office users. Microsoft did enhance 
AppleScript support tremendously for Office 2008, and it ships with 
Automator Actions (cool automation scripts) in all but the Home and 
Student edition.
Coping without VBA
We wish we could tell you some magical way to still have Office 2008 and 
VBA together. The best we can do is describe various strategies, none 
of them ideal, to help you cope without VBA. Here’s a rundown of some 
common scenarios:
 
✦ Stick with Office 2004 and tough it out until the next version of Office 
comes out.
 
 If you’ve kept Office 2004 updated and also installed Open XML Converter, 
a free download from Mactopia, you can open and work with new Office 
XML file format documents right in Office 2004. You can also save in the 
new file formats from Office 2004. Documents that go back and forth 
between 2004 and 2008 will most likely lose formatting and some objects 
might be converted into pictures, so this isn’t always a smooth ride. You 
don’t get any of the new 2008 features this way except for the ability to 
use the new XML (eXtensible Markup Language) file format.

Book I
Chapter 6
Common Tools

127
Programming and Automation Options
 
✦ Install Office 2004 and 2008 side-by-side.
 
 Before you do this, consider using just one version of Entourage. Be 
advised: If you switch back and forth between Entourage 2004 and 2008, 
your mail could get split up between the two versions, and each version 
will have its own calendars, tasks, reminders, and so on.
 
✦ Run Windows Office on your Mac.
 
 This is admitting defeat, but it’s a viable option. We know of four differ-
ent products, two of which are virtual machines that let you install and 
run Microsoft Windows on your Mac, and then subsequently install and 
run a Windows version of Microsoft Office.
 
• Parallels Desktop for Mac Windows virtual machine: Parallels lets you 
run Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X simultaneously. You need to 
purchase Microsoft Windows and a Windows version of Microsoft 
Office to use this product.
 
• VMware Fusion Windows virtual machine: Parallels lets you run 
Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X simultaneously. You need to pur-
chase Microsoft Windows and a Windows version of Microsoft Office 
to use this product.
 
• Paragon NTFS for Mac OS X: NTFS for Mac OS X allows you to install 
and run Windows versions of Microsoft Office directly in Mac OS X 
without installing Microsoft Windows.
 
• Mac OS X Boot Camp: Boot Camp lets you boot directly into 
Microsoft Windows, completely bypassing Mac OS X. You need to 
purchase Microsoft Windows and a Windows version of Microsoft 
Office to use this product.
 
✦ Run a Windows PC remotely.
 
 With Microsoft’s free Remote Desktop Connection Client, you can run a 
networked PC right from your Mac. Doing so requires that you use a PC 
that’s been configured to let you log in remotely. That PC has to have 
Windows and Microsoft Office installed on it as well before you could 
use it in place of Office for Mac. Remote Desktop Connection Client is a 
free download from Mactopia at
www.microsoft.com/mac
 
✦ Substitute AppleScript for VBA.
 
 Because AppleScript is Mac only, this isn’t a cross-platform solution. 
Paul Berkowitz authored VBA to AppleScript 2004 Migration Guide, which 
helps VBA developers convert existing VBA code into AppleScript:
www.mactech.com/vba-transition-guide

128
Programming and Automation Options
Being savvy with AppleScript
Deep down inside your computer is a scripting language — AppleScript — 
that’s extremely powerful. Some applications on your computer support 
AppleScript just a little bit, but Office 2008 was designed to offer excellent 
AppleScript support. Great AppleScripts are waiting on the Internet for you 
to find them, particularly for Entourage, so you don’t have to become a 
scripter to take advantage of Office’s AppleScript capabilities. Apple has a 
Web site devoted to helping people figure out AppleScript. The URL is
developer.apple.com/applescript
Automating with Automator
An even easier way to automate your Mac than with AppleScript is with the 
Automator application. Automator allows you to create workflows from 
actions available for various applications. Office 2008 supports Automator, 
and with the exception of the Home and Student edition, Office 2008 comes 
with some Automator workflows (see Figure 6-12).
The secret to using Automator workflows is to look in the menu bar of any 
Office application, and just to the right of the Help menu is a script symbol. 
Click the Script Symbol menu to reveal a submenu that contains an About 
This menu, followed by Automator workflows.
In Book IV, Chapter 6, you find a great example of how to create an 
Automator workflow that imports a batch of pictures into PowerPoint. You 
can use that chapter as a boilerplate example for creating workflows in other 
applications.

H
elp has changed! Really. In the past when you searched Microsoft 
Office Help, you’d enter some keywords and get results from a data-
base on your hard drive. Today, searching for help happens online unless 
you don’t have an Internet connection.
Now everyone has Web 2.0, which allows the entire world to communicate 
interactively with everyone else. Office 2008 is the first version of Office 
for Mac to take advantage of interactive Web technologies. Interactive 
Web technologies are often called Web 2.0 technologies. Office 2008 Help 
allows you to interact with the people who provide Help at Microsoft as well 
as to interact with other users who have the same products that you do. 
Suddenly, a community can help you, and you may not be aware but you’re 
already connected to it. Just open the door!
Helping You with New Help
People at Microsoft have been listening to Office customers for more than 
25 years. In that long time, they’ve heard their fair share of complaints and 
praise for their help and product support. The people of the Macintosh 
Business Unit (MacBU) at Microsoft in particular have gone out of their 
way to find, listen to, and change the way they provide help. As a result, 
the Help feature in Office 2008 has been completely restructured. No longer 
does Help simply search a fixed database file saved on your computer. Help 
now defaults to search a robust database that’s continuously updated and 
located on Microsoft’s online servers. Instead of taking months or years for 
customer feedback to be incorporated into Help, the Help database is con-
tinually updated with new content, maybe even while you read this chapter!

130
Helping You with New Help
When you use Help from any Office application, you’re actually starting a 
specialized Web Help browser. This opens many new possibilities, includ-
ing the ability to provide sound, animation, and user feedback. The Help 
browser allows you to choose help from a variety of sources, including tradi-
tional Help searches, community forums, and specialized training. You’re no 
longer limited to simply searching for keywords.
Of course, you may not always be connected to the Internet, so Help con-
tinues to have a database of Help topics right on your computer so that you 
can use Help no matter where you are, albeit in a more limited way.
Browse Help to discover more about Office. Figure 7-1 shows the new 
Microsoft Word Help interface. Be sure to explore Help in all the Office appli-
cations. When browsing Help topics, click the triangles that are sprinkled 
throughout Help to expose additional content. In Figure 7-1, we clicked the 
triangle next to Word Training in the Contents list so that we can get at the 
free Training Courses and free training videos.

If you’ve ever wished you could talk to the people who write the Help topics, 
you’ll be pleased to discover that your wish has been granted. We’ve already 
noticed a remarkable improvement in the content of Help topics, but ample

room is there for further progress. That’s why it’s so important for you to 
lend a hand by offering your thoughts about Help topics.
And you can easily lend that hand. At the bottom of most Help topics, you 
see this question: “Was this information helpful?” Click one of the three but-
tons: Yes, No, or Somewhat and then fill in the small form, an example of 
which is shown in Figure 7-2. Doing so takes only a moment, and you can 
be sure that one of the people who authors these Help topics will read your 
comments.
 
MacBU is a small, but passionate group within the large expanse of 
Microsoft, and the people in it pay attention to your feedback.
If Microsoft nailed a topic just right, good for them! Please, let them know. 
If Office Help missed the boat partially or completely, don’t lambast. 
Instead, explain exactly what you’re seeking and how the Help topic could 
be improved. The person who reads your comments has devoted her pro-
fessional career to helping people. Be polite and instructive in your com-
mentary, and the Help topics will evolve and get better and better as time 
passes.
 
Figure 7-2:

Asking someone for help
The Help database covers almost every common topic that comes up, but at 
times, you might be doing something complex or new that’s not addressed 
in Help yet, or you just can’t wait around for the Help topic to be updated. 
In these situations, search the user community to see whether your ques-
tion has been asked and answered already in a public question and answer 
forum. After all, Office has been around 25 years, so a huge body of knowl-
edge is in these communities. First, search with keywords to see whether 
somebody’s already answered it. Then, if you don’t find what you’re looking 
for, go ahead and post your question to a forum.
Before posting a question, be sure to look up the product version and 
include this information in the question that you post. You can find the 
version number in the first menu item under the application name in the 

132
Helping You with New Help
upper-left corner of your screen. Figure 7-3 shows you where to find this 
information for Word, by choosing the About Word option from the applica-
tion menu. Figure 7-3 also shows the resulting information window where 
you will find the version number and the number of the latest update 
that has been installed. The user community consists of other computer 
users ranging from novice to expert. We can’t guarantee that someone will 
respond to your inquiry, but usually within a few days (or even a few min-
utes if you’re lucky), you see a response to your message.

Click on the application menu.
Occasionally Microsoft employees respond to postings, but that’s rare. If 
you see an unanswered question while searching or browsing the user com-
munity, feel free to jump right in and offer your thoughts if you know the 
answer. The community is a two-way street that relies on people like you to 
help with answers and to ask questions.
If you’d prefer to contact Microsoft for help, click the Contact Microsoft link 
in the Help window’s home page (see Figure 7-1) to be taken to a Web page 
with many options, such as Learn More About, How-To, Training, and more. 
This is also a good choice for IT experts to click if they wish to find deploy-
ment information.
Getting online training for free
In the past, Help has been pretty bland. Not anymore! Now you can get free 
online training courses and free training videos about popular topics right 
from Help. Refer to Figure 7-1 and follow these instructions to find these new 
resources in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Entourage.

• From the menu bar, choose Help➪[Application] Help.
 
• Press the Help button (if available) on your keyboard.
 
• Click the question mark icon (if available) on any toolbar.
 
• Right-click or Control-click and then choose Help (if available) from 
the pop-up menu.
 
2. Click the Topics button on the Help toolbar to display the Help 
drawer.
 
3. Click the Contents tab on the drawer.
 
4. Click the second triangle down on the left next to [Application]

Utilizing Newsgroups and Community Resources
Using Post a Question or search for an answer in the user community in the 
Ask Someone section of Help (refer to Figure 7-1) is an uncomplicated, new 
way to view and participate in a traditional online community resource, 
newsgroups. Thousands of queries are posted on these newsgroups, and 
most have detailed responses with resolutions and workarounds.
Go to any archive in these newsgroup postings and you’ll find a treasure 
trove. One great advertising-supported resource for searching archived 
newsgroup posts is Google Groups. In particular, give the Advanced Groups 

134
Checking for Updates
Search link a try. You can easily keep the results Mac-focused by including 
Macintosh in your search. Find Google Groups at this URL
groups.google.com
We highly encourage you to join the global community and give back some-
thing rather than simply take from it. Believe it or not, you know things that 
are of value to others, so why not share your knowledge with them? Look for 
recent postings you can answer or look for posted answers that you could 
improve upon. People who are willing to take this extra step typically install 
specialized newsgroup-reading software on their computer. Head to our 
Entourage minibook, Book V, Chapter 4, where we explain how to configure 
and use Entourage with newsgroups.
Checking for Updates
Checking for updates and installing them can be a pain; believe us, we know. 
But you need to do it anyway. Please. And with the improvements made in 
the update process, updating is less of a pain these days than it used to be.
Your Mac is more than just a mere computer. Apple has invested heavily in 
making it a complete user experience. This experience relies upon a complex 
interaction of your hardware, the operating system, and the application soft-
ware. Both the operating system and the application software are updated 
routinely to keep them running like well-oiled machines.
And people at Apple and Microsoft really do talk to each other, which is a 
good thing because it means that both companies can rely on each other 
to resolve problems, whether hardware- or software-related. Nobody likes 
when a problem affects Microsoft Office, and both companies have worked 
very hard to provide corrections for any problems via automatic application 
and operating system updates.
Your job in all this is to make sure that you keep both your operating system 
and Microsoft Office updated. Fixes made by Apple may not have an effect 
unless you update Office, and fixes by Microsoft may not take effect until 
you update Mac OS X.
Here are the two key ways to keep up to date:
 
✦ Apple Software Update: Use the Apple Software Update program, which 
is the best way to keep your operating system and all your Apple appli-
cations up to date. To run it, choose Apple Menu➪Software Update.
 
✦ Microsoft Office update: The other half of the equation is to keep 
Microsoft Office up to date. From any Office application, choose 
Help➪Check for Updates (see Figure 7-5). Just click the Check for 
Updates button. We recommend that you leave the automatic setting at 
Check for Updates Weekly.

 Even if you don’t run the updates for your Mac OS X and Microsoft 
Office from the menus we list on your own, don’t be surprised if the 
update engine appears on its own as a dialog or a window and then asks 
you to download and install new updates. Pay heed to these suggestions 
and do what’s needed.
Getting Help from Office Web Sites
Although many groups at Microsoft seem to have gotten the message to 
build standard Web pages that look as good on non-Windows machines 
(read: Mac) as they do on Windows machines, not every group has gotten 
the message. We help steer you to some excellent resources outside 
Redmond. MacBU has created an entire Web site — Mactopia — just for Mac 
users. This is one place on Microsoft’s site that really does get it right. Visit 
the site at www.microsoft.com/mac.
Mactopia is the place to get the latest downloads of templates and addi-
tional software products, such as Microsoft Messenger and Remote Desktop 
Connection Client, as well as Office updates that can be saved as files so you 
can install them from CDs or flash drives.
Getting freebies from Mactopia
More Office is to be had than what comes with the install discs. You can also 
get hundreds of great templates for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint from the 
Mactopia site.
Figure 7-6 shows the Mactopia templates site. One good thing is that 
most of the older templates still work in Office 2008. For example, 
templates for Office 2003 for Windows and Office 2004 for Mac are available 
on the Microsoft Web site. You can download Office 2004 templates from 
www.microsoft.com/mac/templates.mspx.

Getting freebies from the Microsoft Office Web site
Use Microsoft’s main Office Online Web site (http://office.microsoft.
com). What’s really great is that all the clip art works with Office 2008. We 
explain how to use clip art from the Microsoft Office site with Clip Gallery in 
Chapter 4 of this minibook.
Also pretty good is that most of the templates on the Microsoft Office Web 
site work just fine with Office 2008. You are likely to run across two obsta-
cles when using this site to obtain templates.
 
✦ Because Office 2008 doesn’t support Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), 
any template with macros doesn’t work.
 
✦ Due to the incompatible design of the Microsoft Office Web site, you 
can’t download most templates using standard Web browsers. The 
only remedy is to download Office 2007 templates using Microsoft’s 
Internet Explorer Web browser in Microsoft Windows on a PC that also 
has Microsoft Office 2007 installed. Then move the template files from 
the Windows PC to your Mac using email, a flash drive, CD, file sharing, 
Mesh.com, OfficeLive, or other means. This whole rigmarole is sup-
posed to ensure that templates are downloaded only by licensed users 
of Microsoft Office. For Mac users, the Microsoft Office site’s draconian 
digital rights management (DRM) policies prevent licensed Microsoft 
Office users from getting the content. Granted, it’s a freebie, but the 
Microsoft Office Web site deserves a raspberry for a policy of intentional 
incompatibility.
 
As we explain in Chapter 2 of this minibook, templates work best in the My 
Templates folder.

Making the Most of MVP Sites
An exceptional group of independent experts, not Microsoft employees, take 
commitment to the community very seriously. Every year Microsoft recog-
nizes exceptional contributors to technical communities by presenting to 
them the Most Valuable Professional (MVP) award. We’re proud to say that 
we’ve been recipients of the MVP award for several years.
In addition to their personal Web sites and blogs, MVPs have gone to the 
trouble of assembling Web sites that deal with each Office application. At 
each site, you find a treasure trove waiting for you to explore. We’ve listed 
the best of the best!
Welcome to Word:mac
An astounding amount of information about Microsoft Word is on this site 
(http://word.mvps.org/Mac/WordMacHome.html). The site is arranged 
so that you can browse or search. We give you the URL to the main site, but 
if you’re writing professionally, find the “Bend Word to Your Will” document 
by Mac MVP Clive Huggan. We highly recommend that you search for his 
article and download it.
Excelling with Excel MVPs
We did mention that MVPs are independent experts, right? As it turns out, 
the Excel MVPs haven’t put together a combined MVP site. Rather, each of 
them has contributed to the community in various ways. And to be honest, 
the Excel MVPs are partial to the Windows version of Excel. Nonetheless, 
you’ll find some valuable insights and free templates that can be garnered 
from their Web sites. A link that lists the Web sites of the Windows Excel 
MVPs can be found at http://mvps.org/links.html#Excel.
One Excel MVP makes a daily video podcast on iTunes. Excel MVP Bill Jelen, 
or Mr. Excel, provides amazing content for free in highly enjoyable segments. 
This is one podcast you’re sure to want to subscribe to. You can get to his 
podcasts easily in iTunes; follow these steps:
 
1. Open a Web browser.
 
2. Go to this URL:
 
 http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/
viewPodcast?id=82989468
 
3. When prompted, allow the Web browser to open iTunes.
 
 Wait while iTunes opens and then locates the Mr Excel podcasts. After a 
short wait, you see the list of available podcasts.
 
4. When you see the list of podcasts, double-click any that seem 
interesting.

Making the Most of MVP Sites
Another Excel MVP, Jon Peltier, has made a specialty of working with charts 
and graphs. His Web site has everything you could possibly imagine about 
charts and graphs and explains how to make charts and graphs from the 
simplest to the most complex. His site is Windows-centric, so remember that 
add-ins, EXE files, and VBA don’t work with Excel 2008. To get a complete 
list of Jon’s chart links, visit http://peltiertech.com/Excel/Charts/
ChartIndex.html.
PowerPointing MVPs
PowerPoint MVPs are much more fun than the other MVPs. We think the 
very social and showy nature of PowerPoint attracts people who are outgo-
ing and friendly, so their Web sites tend to be livelier than the rest. Like 
other MVP sites, you don’t have a shortage of generosity from PowerPoint 
MVPs. You’ll find boatloads of templates, how-to articles, and more at these 
sites.
Steve Rindsberg, a brilliant and friendly man hosts a famed Web site known 
as the PowerPoint Frequently Asked Questions site, or PowerPoint FAQ 
(www.pptfaq.com/index.html). You’re fortunate because Steve goes 
out of his way to make sure his site is Mac-friendly. If a question about 
PowerPoint hasn’t already been answered authoritatively on his site, we’d 
be quite surprised.
Geetesh Bajaj (who modestly didn’t write this part of the book because it’s 
about his own Web site) is an MVP with the site Indezine (as shown in Figure 
7-7) found at www.indezine.com. This Web site is a lively, ever-changing 
mix of magazine-style articles; free design templates; free background tem-
plates; links to an amazing array of resources, how-to articles, reader com-
ments, training, photos to download, clip media, sound stuff, RSS feeds, and 
interviews — everything you could possibly expect to find in an online maga-
zine. Whew!!
You’ll also find product reviews and articles about hardware, such as projec-
tors and remotes, for presenters. Be sure to click the Info link to subscribe 
to the mailing list so that you’ll receive via e-mail free templates and interest-
ing articles on a regular basis.
Connecting with Entourage MVPs
Collaboration is key with Entourage, and the MVPs have put together a 
superb, collaborative site for this Office application. The Entourage Help 
Page, as shown in Figure 7-8, (www.entourage.mvps.org) offers more than 
just help; it’s a dynamic site updated regularly. Whether you have a special 
configuration problem, need synching instructions, or want to explore in 
more depth how Entourage works with Microsoft Exchange, you’ll find useful 
information here. The range of topics discussed is very large. Click the 
Search A–Z Index link or the Site Navigation Map link, and you have access 
to everything you could possibly know about Entourage.

Entourage has supported AppleScript for a long time. Consequently, many 
scripts are available to help you. Be sure to check out the many popular 
scripts available for download. For example, use the search term duplicates 
in the search box in the upper-left part of the site’s window to list the site’s 
content relating to this popular topic.
It only makes sense that one of the principal methods of keeping up to date 
with Entourage goings-on is by e-mail. Before there was a Web site and an 
online community, there was a mailing list. Now there’s a special, free list — 
YouTalk. Subscribe and help comes to you, rather than you going to a Web 
site to get assistance. You can participate or simply sit back and learn. Look 
for the Subscribe to the Entourage YouTalk List link near the top right of The 
Entourage Help Page.

Join the Club!
If you’re not impressed with all the electronic collaboration and communica-
tion, you might just be a people person rather than a virtual-people person. 
Sharing stories about your latest software find or hardware configuration, 
or just sharing a cup of coffee with friends might be the best way for you to 
interact with real, live people!
Joining a user group
User groups have regular in-person meetings with presentations and parties. 
Novices and geniuses are all in the room together, sharing their experiences.
 
Some user groups get big discounts and free stuff from manufacturers. You 
can almost always get free books from user groups if you’re willing to write 
short reviews.
Apple and MacBU are strong user group supporters. Get involved. Visit the 
Apple User Groups Web site (www.apple.com/usergroups) to search for 
a group and to get answers to these questions:
 
✦ Why join a user group?
 
✦ Who joins user groups?
 
✦ What groups are near me?
Joining the Customer Experience 
Improvement Program
Well, the Customer Experience Improvement Program (CEIP) isn’t actually 
a program to improve Microsoft’s customers. The customers are fine. What 
Microsoft really means is that customers can help improve Office by send-
ing feedback directly while using the programs. This is a non-intrusive way 
to help Microsoft track down and fix serious software problems. Usually, 
this comes into play when an Office application crashes and you see a dialog 
asking whether it’s okay to send an error report to Microsoft.
Joining the program is completely voluntary. Find a setting in the 
[Application] menu➪Preferences➪Feedback dialog for Word, Excel, 
PowerPoint, and Entourage that allows you to join the program of each 
application individually. You may also be asked whether you want to join 
during the install process (see Figure 7-9).
When the CEIP kicks in on your computer, Office gathers information about 
itself and what was happening at the time of the problem. Microsoft Error 
Reporting Program (MERP 2.0) creates a log file and presents a small form 

Book I
Chapter 7
Getting Help!
141
Getting Help for Legal and Medical Professionals
where you describe step-by-step the actions you took just prior to the 
problem event. You can take a look at the log file and decide for each event 
whether you wish to submit a report.
MacBU gathers the log files and analyzes the reports sent by program mem-
bers. The goal is to fix serious bugs as soon as possible. Often, a substan-
tial number of reports are needed to discern a trend or detect something 
in common. Some bugs are very esoteric, pertaining to a specific brand 
or model, and affect only a few users working on particular hardware. We 
encourage you to join and participate in the CEIP.

Getting Help for Legal and Medical Professionals 
A good attorney is worth her weight in gold, and many lawyers prefer Macs. 
Likewise physicians who know how to use a Mac and an iPhone together can 
save lives. Each professional should consider running a professional prac-
tice on Apple hardware and software. Macs might be the better choice to 
track billable hours, keep records, and maintain privacy and security, which 
are high priorities. In Book II, Chapter 6, we include instructions on how to 
create a Table of Authorities, which is of interest to legal professionals.

Getting Help for Legal and Medical Professionals
We worry that sometimes people are misled into thinking that Microsoft’s 
Mac version of Office is unsuitable for professionals. No matter what your 
profession is, you’ll find tips and suggestions on the Internet. Here we 
provide three links for professions that we think are prime candidates for 
using Macs:

In This Chapter
✓ Opening new Word documents
✓ Understanding the Word views
✓ Viewing your document in Print Layout View
✓ Taking notes in Notebook Layout View
✓ Engaging an audience in Publishing Layout View
✓ Taking a toolbar moment
✓ Customizing Word the way you want it
T
o think that less than 30 years ago, the mere idea of having a computer 
with a word processor in most homes, much less most businesses, was 
just a prediction by idealists. Back then you were really high-tech if you 
had an IBM electric typewriter. Here you are today with Microsoft Word, an 
utterly amazing tool, just about everywhere.
Welcome to the Word minibook. We start by going over the various layouts 
you’ll find in Microsoft Word. From there, we encourage you to explore and 
customize as you go. For information on any Office 2008 features that work 
the same in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Entourage, check out Book I.
So much is new in Word 2008. Along the way, we point out some exception-
ally useful features that you may have missed, or perhaps heard about but 
haven’t investigated yet.
Opening Blank Word Documents
Before we describe Word’s interface, launch Word. The most sensible way is 
to click Word’s icon from the Dock. When you click Word’s Dock icon, one of 
two different things happens, depending upon the settings you’ve chosen in 
Project Gallery. (We describe Project Gallery’s settings in Book I, Chapter 2.)
 
✦ If Project Gallery does not launch when applications are opened, 
Word opens a new, blank document in the view that was last used. (We 
describe views in the following section.)

146
Opening Blank Word Documents
 
✦ If Project Gallery launches when applications open, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the New tab, if it isn’t selected already.
 
2. In the Category list on the left, choose Blank Documents.
 
3. Set the Show filter to Word documents, as shown in Figure 1-1.
 
 After you follow these steps, you can choose from the following (see 
Figure 1-1):
 
• Word Document: Opens a new, blank Word document in the last used 
view.
 
• Word Notebook Layout: Opens a new, blank Word document in Word 
Notebook Layout View.
 
• Word Publishing Layout: Opens a new, blank Word document in Word 
Publishing Layout View.
 
Figure 1-1:

Set Show filter to Word Documents.
Choose from these three layouts.
Opens selection.
You can double-click one of the layouts in Project Gallery, or you can select 
a layout and then click the Open button to open it. If you click the Cancel 
button, a new, blank Word document opens in the most recently used view.
 
 If Word is already running, you can open a new, blank document in the most 
recently used view. Choose from the following:
 
 
✦ Click the New button on Word’s Standard toolbar. When you click the 
small triangle next to the New button, a submenu appears from which 
you can choose a layout.

✦ Choose File➪New Blank Document.
 
✦ Press Ô-N.
Looking at Word’s Views
Word’s View menu is a good place to start examining Word’s interface. When 
you choose View, the topmost section lists all the available Word views (as 
shown in Figure 1-2). You can choose from the following:
 
✦ Draft: Shows a simplified view of your document along with the names 
of text styles that have been applied. Content isn’t displayed the way it 
will look when you print.
 
✦ Web Layout: Word approximates what your document will look like if 
you save it as a Web page and then open it in a Web browser.
 
✦ Outline: With heading levels, (which we explain in Chapter 3 of this 
minibook), you can organize your document into an outline. Text can be 
promoted and demoted in levels that you specify with the Outline tool-
bar, which turns on automatically when you choose Outline view.
 
✦ Print Layout: Print Layout View shows you how your document will look 
when you print. See the section, “Working in Print Layout View,” later in 
this chapter for more.

options.
 

148
Looking at Word’s Views
 
✦ Notebook Layout: Notebook Layout View enables you to take notes and 
record audio that’s synchronized with your text while you type. We dis-
cuss this in the section, “Taking notes in Notebook Layout View,” later in 
this chapter.
 
✦ Publishing Layout: Newsletters, brochures, flyers, and even small maga-
zines can be created in Publishing Layout View. Publishing Layout View 
is a new Word 2008 feature, which we discuss in the section, “Designing 
in Publishing Layout View,” later in this chapter.
Figure 1-2 shows Word’s complete View menu. In addition to using the View 
menu, you can switch from one view to another by clicking the view buttons, 
as shown in Figure 1-3, in the lower-left corner of the document window.

Looking at Word’s Views
You get a chance to explore all Word’s views and make up your mind about 
how you want to use them. The goal of this book is to help you create docu-
ments not only quickly, but also to create documents that look fantastic and 
communicate your message to your audience. And in case you’re wondering, 
we wrote this book in Word 2008!
 
Although the figures in this chapter have a plain-Jane look, that doesn’t 
mean that you have to accept Word’s default appearance. We recommend 
that you customize Word’s interface to fit your needs. Everyone’s Word 
should look and work differently, at least a bit.
You have a lot of choices in how you can view your Word documents. In 
Figure 1-2, we toggled on options, such as the Formatting Palette, Elements 
Gallery, and Ruler. In the View menu, simply click an option to toggle it on 
and click it again to toggle it off. When an option is toggled on, a check mark 
appears.
 
Menus and toolbars are context-sensitive: Office knows what layout you’re 
using and what’s currently selected in your document. The options you see 
while using menus and toolbars in Office are updated automatically to offer 
what’s appropriate at any given moment. Right-clicking or Control-clicking in 
the interface produces a context-sensitive pop-up menu that relates to wher-
ever you click.
Working in Print Layout View
Print Layout View is a good starting point for beginners because it’s closest 
to what you see onscreen compared with what you get when you print. We 
use this view as an example to explain the general layout of Word’s interface. 
Figure 1-3 shows a document in Print Layout View after enabling most of the 
options in the View menu. (See the previous section for more.)
The following views in Word have the same basic interface characteristics as 
Print Layout View. Although each has minor variations, information regard-
ing Print Layout View also applies to the following views:
 
✦ Draft
 
✦ Web Layout
 
✦ Outline
The Notebook Layout View and Publishing Layout View interfaces are signifi-
cantly different, so we discuss them separately later in this chapter.
We draw special attention to specific interface elements (see Figure 1-3):
 
✦ Blinking insertion cursor: When you type, insert something, or paste, 
this is the place in your document where it happens. After you have text 

150
Looking at Word’s Views
in your document, you can click anywhere in the text to set the cursor’s 
location.
 
✦ Document title: This is the filename of your document. A new document 
has a generic name, such as Document #, until you save it.
 
✦ Ruler: You have horizontal and vertical rulers. Adjust margins and 
indents by dragging ruler elements. Click in the horizontal ruler to add 
tab stops. Double-click rulers for additional options. Toggle the ruler on 
and off in the View menu.
 
✦ Script menu: Here you find the Word Automator Actions that come with 
all Office package bundles except the Home and Student edition. (For 
more on Automator, see Book I, Chapter 6.)
 
✦ View menu: In Figure 1-2, the View menu is highlighted to help you find 
the menu.
 
✦ Show/Hide Toolbars: This button is near the upper-right corner of the 
window and toggles toolbars on and off.
 
✦ Standard toolbar: Figure 1-3 shows the default toolbar buttons for Page 
Layout View. Different buttons appear when you switch views.
 
✦ Elements bar: This bar is always visible. Click the tabs to activate 
Elements Gallery.
 
✦ Elements Gallery: Allows you to do all kinds of things, from inserting a 
cover page to adding charts, SmartArt graphics, WordArt, and more!
 
 
✦ Navigation Pane: Can be toggled on and off in the View menu or you can 
click the Navigation button on the Standard toolbar. This pane helps you 
move around in multiple page documents. A scroll bar appears when 
there are more pages than what fits on the screen. A pop-up menu at the 
top of the Navigation Pane allows you to choose one of these two 
Navigation Pane operating modes:
 
• Thumbnail: A small thumbnail of each page is visible with the page 
number for that thumbnail. Click a thumbnail to instantly view that 
page.
 
• Document Map: This option shows a map of your document based 
upon the heading levels you’ve used within your document. Right-
click or Control-click in the Document Map to limit the map to 
specific headings. This view doesn’t show a map until you apply 
heading styles to text in your document. You can apply text heading 
styles with the Styles section of the Formatting Palette or choose 
Format➪Styles. We discuss styles in Chapter 3 of this minibook.
 
✦ Scroll bar: Scroll bars automatically appear whenever needed. Drag 
scroll bars with your mouse. You can customize your scroll bars by 
modifying the Appearance settings in Mac OS X preferences.

information that updates automatically, glance at this. This same spot is 
also a button that you can click to make the Find/Replace/Go To window 
open.
 
✦ Word Count button: The number of words in your document is updated 
on this button while you type. Click this spot to display the Word Count 
dialog, as shown in Figure 1-5. (Note: This figure isn’t for a blank docu-
ment, so you can get an idea of what you’ll see.)
 
✦ Spell Check button: Click this button to initiate a spell check from the 
current cursor location or check the spelling of text you selected.

Track Changes feature on and off. The small dot changes colors to 
indicate when track changes are activated. This button activates the 
Reviewing toolbar if it isn’t visible already when you use this button to 
turn on track changes.
Taking notes in Notebook Layout View
Word’s Notebook Layout View (see Figure 1-6) has so many uses; where 
should we begin? Notebook Layout View is great for students who jot notes, 
office workers who attend meetings, assistants who track tasks, or profes-
sionals who need to record meetings with clients. What’s more, if you get an 
adapter, you can annotate telephone conversations that you have with busi-
ness people or clients. Word Notebook Layout View allows you to record 
sound while you type. What you type is linked to the audio so that Word 
annotates the audio. You can play back the audio that was recorded when 
you typed the text by clicking anywhere in the text of the document and 
then clicking the speaker icon that appears.
For those who work on both Macs and PCs, 
you have some platform limitations. Notebook 
Layout View in Word for Mac offers the 
core functionality of the Microsoft OneNote 
Windows program, but without the require-
ment of a different file format. On Word for 
Mac, audio and typed annotations are stored 
in standard Word documents. Word for Mac 
can’t open Windows OneNote files. Word for 
Windows can open files made in Word for Mac 
Notebook Layout View, but can’t use any of 
the Notebook Layout View features. Word for 
Windows will display only the typed text. Word 
Notebook Layout View is Mac-only.

Time to see how Word Notebook Layout View looks and works. To start, 
make a new, blank document in Notebook Layout View from Project Gallery. 
To open new, blank Word document in Notebook Layout View:
 
1. Choose File➪Project Gallery.
 
 Project Gallery opens with the New Documents category selected.
 
2. Double-click Word Notebook Layout.
 
 You may have to scroll to see this option.
Right away you can see that Notebook Layout View is very interesting; it 
looks just like a notebook, complete with (optional) spiral bindings and 

154
Looking at Word’s Views
(optional) lined notebook paper (refer to Figure 1-6). The Formatting Palette 
looks different, too; it has all sorts of new controls on it, just for Notebook 
Layout View. Take a quick peek at the Word menus and you’ll see that many 
of the menu items have changed. You can use most, but not all, of Word’s 
Print Layout features in Notebook Layout View.
You may find it easier to figure out how to use Notebook Layout View when 
you really have to use it, such as while taking notes in an actual meeting or 
class. (Of course, if necessary, be polite and let everyone know that you’re 
recording the session. Make sure you’re following the policies of your orga-
nization.) All Mac laptops and iMacs are equipped with built-in microphones 
that offer surprisingly good sensitivity in meetings. Other Macs require a 
microphone to record audio notes. To get started with a little recording 
session:
 
1. Click the Audio button.
 
 This displays the Audio Notes toolbar (as shown in Figure 1-7).

2. Adjust the Input Volume slider.
 
 Try starting with the Input Volume slider adjusted so that the sound

3. Click the red Start Recording button and then type notes while you 
record the session.
 
 Audio is synchronized automatically with your typed notes as you type. 
Press Return or Enter as you type while recording to make it visually 
apparent in your document when a new topic or something noteworthy 
you want to differentiate appears. Keep an eye on the sound input level 
indicator and try to keep it at about 3/4 volume with the Input Volume 
slider. You can adjust indenting levels later with the Formatting Palette.
 
4. Click the highlighted blue and black Stop button to stop recording the 
audio.
 
 The Start Recording button becomes a Continue Recording button.
After you record some audio, you can have some fun playing it back. If you 
move your mouse over the margin to the left of anything you typed, an audio 
icon appears. Click that icon to hear the audio that was recorded while the 
text on that line was being typed. You can use the Timeline Slider control to 
play back audio for any given moment; click into the Timeline and drag and 
then click the light blue Play button to the left of the Timeline.
 
If you want to listen to Notebook Layout View audio from a Word document 
in iTunes, you can export the audio as an MP4 file; choose Tools➪Audio 
Notes➪Export Audio. Drag the file into iTunes and you’re in business!
Some things in Notebook Layout View are there mostly to make it enjoyable 
to use. In the Notebook Layout View Standard toolbar, you can click the 
Appearance button to reveal a fly-out menu, as shown in Figure 1-8, that can 
adjust how the notebook looks. You can choose from a range of looks with 
or without notebook rings, all the way from Simple Contemporary to Beige 
Plastique!

In addition to the Appearance button, you can customize the blank space 
that surrounds your document. At the bottom of the document window, on 
the status bar, click the Customize Workspace button (refer to Figure 1-6) to 
choose an attractive workspace background (see Figure 1-9). And if you get 
bored at your meeting or class, you can always use the Scribble and Erase 
buttons (see Figure 1-6) on the Notebook Layout View Standard toolbar to 
entertain you. Now, get back to work!

Perhaps you prefer to use generic section names, such as Section 1, in your 
notebook. But if you want to use something more descriptive, double-click a 
section tab to the right of the document and then type to change the section 
name.
 
If you want to see something really nice for a document that’s long and in 
sections, when you press Ô-F to find text, section tabs that contain your 
search criteria light up if a match to the search criteria is in that section.
Designing in Publishing Layout View
Welcome to Word Publishing Layout View! We could scream and shout: Extra! 
Extra! Read all about it! The headline reads, “Ordinary computer user discov-
ers complete publishing program in Office for Mac.” But we’d rather be as 
understated about Word’s publishing capabilities as Microsoft has been!
Headlines aside, Office for Mac contains a publishing program that you can 
use to create and publish your own newspaper, newsletter, or any story-
based communication periodical. With Word Publishing Layout View, you 
can design and create professional-looking publications that can be dis-
tributed via e-mail or print. The best part is you don’t need special skills, a 
different program, or a special file format. Word 2008 does it all in standard 
Word documents with the traditional Word tools you’re used to.

Yes, Publishing Layout View doesn’t come close to Adobe InDesign or 
QuarkXPress, but you probably don’t need to print 5,000 brochures that 
have been created with four-color separations! If you don’t understand the 
language of color separations, you’ll love Word’s Publishing Layout and the 
ability to use a language most can understand.
Word includes professionally designed templates that help you with layout. 
The templates available on the Publishing Templates tab of Elements 
Gallery, such as Newsletters, Brochures, Flyers, and Invitations to name a 
few, hint at the wide variety of tasks that Word Publishing Layout View is 
designed for. Because Elements Gallery is highly interactive and so easy to 
use, if you want to create a document that falls into any of these categories, 
go to the Publishing Templates tab of Elements Gallery and click any that 
catch your fancy.
To create a new, blank document in Word Publishing Layout View, as shown 
in Figure 1-10, follow these steps:

 Your interface looks almost exactly the same as Figure 1-10.
Publishing Layout View in Word for Mac offers 
the core functionality of the Microsoft Publisher 
Windows program, but without the requirement 
of a different file format. On Word for Mac, 
Publishing Layout View documents are stored 
as standard Word documents. Word for Mac 
can’t open Windows Publisher files. Word for 
Windows can open and work with files made 
in Word for Mac Publishing Layout View, but 
Word for Windows doesn’t have the Publishing 
Layout View’s Standard toolbar or Publishing 
Layout View. Publishing Layout View is 
Mac-only.
When you distribute documents made in 
Publishing Layout View in Word for Mac, 
consider using the PDF format to preserve 
the formats and layouts that you create. To 
create a PDF from your document, choose 
File➪Save As. In the Format section, choose 
PDF. This way people using Word for Windows, 
other versions of Word for Mac, or those who 
may not have the same fonts that you do will 
still enjoy the full fidelity of your published 
documents.

That might be a lot of steps, but page 2 of this particular template shows off 
the story characteristics of Word Publishing Layout View. A newsletter will 
be distributed to an audience, so it has to look really good. An important 
part of looking good is a great layout, which this newsletter template has. 
We explain how to customize templates in Chapter 7 of this minibook. For 
now, we focus on the interface.
Notice that the Standard toolbar is different in Word Publishing Layout 
View. (See Chapter 7 of this minibook for more information about the 
Standard toolbar.) You can’t customize the Standard toolbar in Word 
No matter which layout you choose, Word 
menus are worth exploring. We think Word 
users in particular tend to be more keyboard-
centric in their thinking and behavior and will 
really appreciate that the Macintosh Business 
Unit (MacBU) at Microsoft decided to stick 
with the Apple User Interface Guidelines. 
Office for Mac has retained menus instead of 
going all the way to tabs splattered with icons 
of assorted sizes.
People who prefer to use the keyboard over 
the mouse will appreciate this: We’re about 
to show you a way to navigate menus for all 
applications in Mac OS X, dubbed full keyboard 
access. When you use full keyboard access, 
you can use menus without having to use a 
mouse or a trackpad, and you’ll find that you’ll 
speed through your work much faster.
To navigate menus using just the keyboard 
(Note: Before you get started, if you’re on a 
laptop, hold down the Fn key in combination 
with the following keyboard combinations):
First, there is one simple bit of setup that you 
need to perform so that you can use Mac OS X’s 
full keyboard access feature. Press Control-F7 
once to toggle on the full keyboard access set-
ting. Nothing happens onscreen when you do 
this. If you ever need to toggle this feature off, 
press Control-F7 again.
 ✓ Whenever you wish to use the Menu, press 
Control-F2.
 
 When you do so, in the upper-left corner of 
your screen, the Apple icon is highlighted.
 ✓ Press up-, down-, left-, and right-arrow 
keys to navigate through the menus.
 ✓ Press Return or Enter to select a menu 
item.
 ✓ Press Esc to cancel.
Of course, if you’re used to using the mouse, 
this keyboard stuff might seem a bit strange 
to you at first. But if you like to type fast and 
are comfortable with your fingers flying over 
the keyboard, or if you’re on an airplane where 
you’re squished in with a shoehorn, you’ll 
appreciate this feature a lot.

Making the Most of Toolbars
Publishing Layout View. You can, however, customize the workspace with 
the Customize Workspace button in the status bar at the bottom of the docu-
ment window.
Text boxes in Word Publishing Layout View are very interactive. Just hover 
the mouse over the story text boxes, as shown in Figure 1-10, and you’ll 
notice 1, 2, and 3 appear and disappear as the mouse passes over the text 
boxes. These numbers tell you that the text boxes are part of a story in 
which text flows from one text box to another. If you click inside box 1 and 
start typing, when box 1 fills up, the text continues into box 2, and then into 
box 3. If you drag a story text box, you see guides and measurements that 
appear to help you precisely lay out your publication. Also notice that dif-
ferent toolbar buttons become active depending upon which story box you 
click. The first text box and the last text box within a story have different 
options from text boxes that are between them. After you read more exam-
ples in Chapter 7 of this minibook, you’ll see how easy it is to make newslet-
ters and other publications in Word Publishing Layout View.
This is one of those times in which we can’t do a better job explaining things 
than Word’s built-in Help. Reading about using the grid lines and the Master 
Pages feature (the tabs in the lower-right corner of the document window, as 
shown in Figure 1-10) is as easy as searching Help for Lay out a newsletter in 
Publishing Layout View.
Making the Most of Toolbars
If you read Book I, Chapter 3 about customizing toolbars, you know that we 
encourage you to add and remove commands as well as to make your own 
toolbars. The more you use Word, the more you’ll want to experiment with 
the commands in the Customize Toolbars and Menus dialog that you access 
from Word’s View menu. Remember to visit this feature regularly.
 
Just about everyone can use the Fit to Window command in Word’s Print 
Layout View. Follow the instructions in Book I, Chapter 3 and choose 
View➪Customize Toolbars and Menus to put the Fit to Window command 
into a toolbar or a menu. See Figure 1-11. After you put the Fit to Window 
toolbar button onto a toolbar, click the Fit to Window button and then resize 
the document window by dragging the lower-right corner of the document 
window. Watch as the document adjusts itself to fit the current window size.

Making Word Behave the Way You Want It To
Wouldn’t it be great if you could force your unruly teenager to behave just 
the way you want by saying a few special words? Well, Word can’t make your 
teenager act any better, but you can do some simple things to make Word 
behave the way you want it to.
Finding Word’s new Preferences pane
Do you get irritated when Word corrects spellings and formats bulleted lists 
without being asked? That’s the AutoCorrect feature working more than you 
want it to. Word’s Preferences pane is where you head when you wonder 
why Word is doing what it’s doing, and it’s where you can change the set-
tings. To make it easier for you to access Word’s settings is a redesigned 
Preferences pane (see Figure 1-12) in Word 2008 that you access by choosing 
Word➪Preferences.
As you work in Word, changes to various preferences are made without 
visiting the Preferences pane. Options that you choose from pop-up menus, 
widgets, toolbars, and Toolbox controls sometimes affect preferences with-
out making a big deal about it. We visit various preference panes and offer 
suggestions for settings throughout chapters in this book.

Turning AutoCorrect on and off
A lot of people wish Word wasn’t so presumptuous about how things ought 
to be. In particular, when Word is autocorrecting things, maybe it’d be better 
if Word started by asking you what you want done. Unfortunately, Word isn’t 
a talking context-sensitive robot. You have to turn correction features on or 
off on your own.
Now there just happens to be a simple setting in AutoCorrect that allows you 
to turn off the entire AutoCorrect feature. Choose this magical sequence: 
Word➪Preferences and then click the AutoCorrect button and deselect the 
Automatically Correct Spelling and Formatting as You Type check box.
Setting compatibility preferences
In addition to the AutoCorrect preferences, take a peek at the compatibility 
preferences, as shown in Figure 1-13. A wide variety of specific behaviors 
can be turned on and off here, such as
 
✦ Font Substitution: If you open a document that used a font that isn’t 
available on your computer, Word substitutes a font that you do have 
for the font that you don’t have. If you’d rather choose the font, click the 
Font Substitution button and then choose the font you want.
 
✦ Option Sets: The Recommended Options For pop-up menu has pre-
configured combinations of settings from the behavior options. You 
can change Word 2008 to behave like older versions of Word or even 
WordPerfect.

Customizing Word’s keyboard shortcuts
Being able to speed up your work is always a good thing. Keyboard short-
cuts are one of the best ways to increase your productivity, and customizing 
those shortcuts makes your computer more personalized.
Mac OS X has its own keyboard shortcuts in addition to Word’s keyboard 
shortcuts. When you press a key or a key combination, Mac OS X searches 
to see whether a task is assigned to that shortcut in Mac OS X system pref-
erences. If Mac OS X has a shortcut defined for what you pressed, the key-
board shortcut is carried out by the operating system. However, if Mac OS 
X keyboard shortcuts aren’t defined for what you pressed, Mac OS X tells 
Word what you pressed on the keyboard. You have to check to make sure 
that if you want to use a particular keyboard shortcut in Word, your desired 
shortcut isn’t already assigned to do something else by Mac OS X. Apple has 
a lot of nice keyboard shorcuts already defined for Mac OS X, and you can 
easily get a complete list of them:
 
1. In Finder (the Desktop), choose Help➪Mac Help.
 
2. In the Ask a Question search box, type shortcuts and then press 
Return or Enter.
 
 Help responds with a list of relevant topics.
Likewise, Word also has a generous assortment of keyboard shortcuts right 
from the start. If you switched to the Finder application in the preceding 
steps, switch back to Word. The shortcuts in Word are available by search-
ing Word’s Help for Keyboard Shortcuts. You can set up Word so that it 
automatically displays keyboard shortcuts in menus and toolbar ScreenTips:
 
1. In Word, choose View➪Customize Menus and Toolbars.
 
2. In the resultant dialog, select the Show Shortcut Keys in Screen Tips 
check box.
 
3. Click OK to make the change.
Yes, you can assign keyboard shortcuts to Word commands and change 
the ones that Microsoft assigned. Word doesn’t force you to stick with the 
default shortcuts. You can assign and reassign shortcuts as you wish. You 
can change the settings for just a single document and even save that docu-
ment as a template so that when you open that template, the keyboard 
shortcuts you customized apply to the documents created from that tem-
plate. Figure 1-14 shows the Customize Keyboard dialog that allows you to 
reassign a keyboard shortcut so that Word will speak the selected text. To 
access the Customize Keyboard dialog and set a keyboard shortcut:

you pressed has already been assigned to a shortcut in Mac OS X. If a 
conflict exists, the Mac OS X shortcut is executed, not Word’s.

✦ Save Changes In pop-up menu: Determines whether the keyboard short-
cut you assign when you press the Assign button is saved in the current

• If you save to a document, the assignment works only for that particu-
lar document.
 
• If you save to Normal.dotx, the assignment works from now on when-
ever you use the Normal template in Word.
Note: You can transfer shortcuts from one document template to another 
and to the Normal.dotx template with the Organizer tool. We explain the 
Organizer tool in Chapter 3 of this minibook.

W
ord has some pretty slick ways of dealing with a wide variety of file 
formats, from the unknown to the mysterious. As you’d normally 
expect, Word can open and save its own files, but Word can work with other 
kinds of files as well. Every once in a while you might receive a document 
that you just can’t get to open. Word can often help with this problem. Some 
file formats are widely shared, such as RTF (Rich Text Format) files. Word 
can open and save files as RTFs and in other formats as well. You also have 
ways to protect the information inside your Word files. And of course, Word 
has a master Normal.dotx template that can make styling your text a breeze. 
And if you don’t know what that is, don’t worry because we explain it all in 
this chapter.
Opening the World in Word
You’d think that opening files would be an old hat to most everyone who 
has ever touched a computer by now, but a lot of people still don’t know 
about some ways to open files in Word. You might use some of these 
methods all the time, whereas you might use others once in a blue moon, 
but it’s good to know they’re available just in case!
Trying out templates
A plethora of Word templates come pre-built in Project Gallery. With these 
templates, you can create great-looking documents for specific purposes or 
audiences without going to a lot of trouble. And even if some of them aren’t 
exactly what you’re looking for, remember that they’re easy to customize to 
your own taste and can save you lots of time.

168
Opening the World in Word
To get to the templates quickly, follow these steps:
 
1. In Word, choose File➪Project Gallery.
 
 Project Gallery appears.
 
2. Click the New tab, if it isn’t selected already.
 
 See Figure 2-1.
 
3. Choose Word Documents from the Show pop-up menu.
 
 This filters Project Gallery to show only Word documents, templates, 
and wizards.
 
4. Click each different category in the Category list.
 
 Be sure to click the disclosure triangles to expose sub-categories.
 
5. Double-click a template to open it in Word.
 
 Project Gallery closes, and Word automatically attaches the template to 
your document. Your template is now ready for you to customize or use 
in Word.

Being normal with Normal.dotx
Perhaps you’ve suspected that Word must have a special template somewhere 
that you can use as a default when you create that seemingly plain, blank 
document. Well, you’re right; this special template is Normal.dotx, and it 
has all the settings that control what you see when you create a new, blank 
document. In Chapter 7, we explain how to save a customized Word document 
as the Normal.dotx template so that by default, Word opens your customized 
template instead of Word’s default Normal.dotx template.
Becoming a whiz with wizards
Three of the most common tasks you’re likely to do with Word can be 
accomplished quickly with Word’s Envelope, Letter, and Mailing Label 
Wizards. Wizards are a series of dialogs with choices to make at each step. 
They’ve been designed with the intention to help you create certain kinds 
of documents in a jiffy. To get at these three Word wizards, head to Project 
Gallery and type wiz in the Search box. The Word wizards appear, as shown 
in Figure 2-2. To launch one of the wizards, just double-click the one you want.
You come across other wizards in this book, but these three can open new 
documents, which is why they’re in Project Gallery (and why they’re in this 
chapter). Here’s a brief description of each wizard (see Chapter 6 in this 
minibook for more on mail merge):
 
✦ Envelope Wizard: Use Envelope Wizard to print envelopes. You can use 
it to print just one envelope or thousands. Because envelopes come in 
many sizes, you can configure the wizard to print any envelope size that 
fits into your printer.
 
✦ Letter Wizard: You have 124 different Word templates just waiting for 
your customization in the Letter Format tab’s Page Design pop-up menu. 
Even though it’s called Letter Wizard, not all the formats are letters. In 
fact, the Letter Wizard templates are the same 124 Word templates that 
you find in Project Gallery’s New tab and in Elements Gallery. The Letter 
Wizard gives you a step-by-step ways to customize these templates.
 
 If you’re looking for the Resume Wizard, it’s been rolled into the Letter 
Wizard. You’ll find Simple, Blocks, Initials, Grayscale, and Vitae résumé 
templates in the Page Design pop-up menu found in Step 1 of the Letter 
Wizard.
 
✦ Mailing Label Wizard: The Mailing Label Wizard can also open a new 
document. Although the name implies that it’s just for making sheets 
of mailing labels, you can actually use it to make all sizes and shapes 
of stick-on labels, and for other things, such as tent cards and name 
badges.

Opening Web pages
Surfing the Web is great, but at times, you may want to edit those Web 
pages in Word. Several approaches bring all or part of a Web page into 
Word. Remember, Word is all about words. Web browsers can have all sorts 
of content that Word can’t deal with, so don’t expect Word to faithfully 
reproduce a Web page. Be happy if you get the text you want.
Copying and pasting
This is a fast, easy way to get Web page content into Word. To do so:
 
1. Select what you want in your Web browser and then choose 
Edit➪Copy.
 
2. Switch to Word and choose Edit➪Paste.
 
 If the result isn’t good enough, try the following suggestion.
Saving and opening a Web page
Word can open Web pages that have been saved as .htm, .html, or .mht 
(Web archives). For example, say you’re using a Web browser and you find 
a Web page that you want to edit in Word. Use the Web browser to save the 
Web page as a file on your computer and then open the saved file in Word. 
Here’s how:
 
1. In the Web browser, choose File➪Save As.
 
 The Web browser’s Save dialog opens.
 
2. Choose a location.
 
 Remember the filename or give the file a name of your choosing.
 
3. Save the file.

Book II
Chapter 2
An Open and
Shut Case
171
Opening the World in Word
After you save your Web page in Word, you need to know how to open it. To 
open your saved Web page in Word, follow these steps:
 
1. In Word, choose File➪Open.
 
 The File Open dialog appears.
 
2. Choose All Files from the Enable pop-up menu.
 
3. Navigate to and select the file you saved in the preceding steps.
 
4. Click the Open button or double-click the filename.
 
 Word does its best to open the Web page you saved. Bear in mind, many 
Web page elements, such as Flash, Silverlight, style sheets, and various 
scripts are ignored by Word. Just the same, you may be able to get the 
content you want into Word so that you can take it from there and do 
your own editing magic in Word.
 
If your first attempt didn’t turn out well, you can try using a different Save 
As format in your Web browser. Web browsers and Web pages vary widely. 
In Word, a Web page saved by one browser, such as Safari, may look com-
pletely different from the same page saved by a different Web browser, such 
as Firefox. Each Web browser has different Save As formats from which to 
choose, so don’t give up after just one attempt. Try saving the page again 
with a different browser and/or format. Word can open any format that your 
Web browser can Save As. Sometimes the results just aren’t good no matter 
what format or browser you choose. This is a limitation of opening Web 
pages in Word.
Saving a document as a Web page
Fifteen years ago, the Internet was something exciting and new to most 
people. Everyone wondered how the Internet would shake out, and 
Microsoft wanted to be a leader in the field. At that time, the best way to 
distribute Word documents on the Web was to save them as HyperText 
Markup Language (HTML) files, the native file format understood by Web 
browsers. The idea was to save a Word document in HTML and upload it to 
a Web server; then anyone with access to the server could download the file, 
and his Word copy would reconstruct the document exactly as it was before.
Recently, new Internet technologies have made this scenario passé. Also, 
depending on a particular scenario, you have better ways to share documents 
online, which we discuss in Book VI, Chapter 2.
However, it’s good to know that Word can open and create Web pages just 
in case you ever need to make a Web page from a Word document. In Safari, 
choose File➪Save As and save the Web page. Then in Microsoft Word, 

172
Opening the World in Word
choose File➪Open and then choose Enable➪All Files. Select the Web page 
you saved from Safari and you can work with it in Microsoft Word. Keep in 
mind that Word is designed to handle text and pictures, and this feature was 
designed to give faithful reproduction of Word documents. Other design 
elements, such as Flash, video, and complex Web pages, either don’t render 
well or don’t render at all in Word. However, with simple Web pages, or if 
you just want to use the text in a Web page, this approach can be a lifesaver. 
Also, if someone sends you a file with the .mht file extension, it’s probably 
a Web Archive saved from Microsoft’s Internet Explorer browser. Word 2008 
can open this type of file.
Word is better at creating Web pages from scratch than it is at rendering 
Web pages made with other tools. To turn a Word document into a Web 
page, follow these steps:
 
1. In Word, choose Print Layout view by clicking the View button.
 
2. From the View menu, choose Web Layout to preview of how your 
document will look as a Web page.
 
3. When you’re satisfied with the way your document looks, choose 
File➪Save as Web to save your changes.
Extracting text from any file
Every so often you might come across a mystery file that you can’t figure out 
what it contains or maybe even which file format it uses. Maybe the file was 
corrupted before you got it, or maybe it’s in a Microsoft Windows format 
that has no equivalent on the Mac side. Don’t worry. Even if you don’t know 
what application created the file, Word might be able to help. If text is in a 
file, Word can extract the text no matter what application created the file. To 
do so, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪Open.
 
 The Open dialog appears.
 
2. Choose Recover Text from Any File in the Enable pop-up menu.
 
3. Select the file that you want to extract the text from and then click 
Open.
 
 Alternatively, you can double-click the file you want to extract the text 
from.
 
 A new Word document opens. The Word document contains the text, 
if any, that was in the file you selected. You might now know what the 
mystery document was, have a hint about what kind of file it was, or 
you may have rescued the text from a corrupt file and can now use the 
rescued text.

Finding files in Finder
Your file’s gone! You knew right where that file was a minute ago, but now 
it’s gone. Now is the time to use Spotlight. Whether you use the Word Open 
command or you’re browsing your files with Finder, find the Spotlight 
Search box with its little magnifying glass icon in the upper-right corner of 
the window. Type a search term into the Search box, and Spotlight instantly 
displays the files containing that term. 
 
If you’re browsing in Finder, turn Cover Flow view on (keyboard shortcut 
Ô-4). Select a document and press the spacebar to enlarge the Cover Flow 
preview and then scroll through your entire document with the Mac OS X 
QuickView without even having to open the file, as shown in Figure 2-3. Of 
course, you can use any of Mac OS X’s more than 20 different ways to open 
the file at this point, including double-clicking the QuickView window.

Comparing two Word documents
 
 Now you’ve done it. You have two documents, and both might be the same, 
but you’re not sure. One document is newer than the other, but still you 
have doubts. The Compare Documents tool allows you to compare the two 
documents and find out what the differences are.
 
 Before you can use the Compare Documents tool, you have to add the 
Compare Documents button to one of your toolbars:

174
Opening the World in Word
 
1. In Word, choose View➪Customize Toolbars and Menus.
 
 The Customize Toolbars and Menus dialog appears.
 
2. Near the top of the dialog, select the Commands tab.
 
3. In the Categories list, choose Tools, and in the Commands list, choose 
Compare Documents in the middle of the list.
 
4. Drag the Compare Documents icon onto the toolbar you want it to 
appear on.
 
 When you release the mouse, the icon turns into a command button on 
your toolbar. You can now use this tool anytime you need to.
 
5. Click OK to close the Customize Menus and Toolbars dialog.
 
See Book I, Chapter 3 for more on customizing your toolbars and menus.
After you place the Compare Documents button on your toolbar, to use the 
feature to compare two Word documents:
 
1. Open one of the Word documents that you want to compare.
 
2. Click the Compare Document button.
 
 The Open dialog appears.
 
3. Select the second Word document that you wish to compare with the 
document that you opened in Step 1 and click Open.
 
 Word highlights the differences between the two documents with the 
Reviewing and Track Changes feature, which we cover in Chapter 4 of 
this minibook.
Recovering AutoRecover files
Uh oh. Crash time! Microsoft Word quits unexpectedly, and you hold your 
breath (which isn’t too helpful as far as the poor document is concerned). 
If that ever happens to you, and we hope it never does, all you have to do is 
open Microsoft Word again. In normal circumstances, Word looks for and 
opens any AutoRecover files for the document(s) that you were working on 
when the crash occurred. Your document(s) open with Recovered appended 
to the filename. Choose File➪Save As to restore the original filename and 
location. Word can recover files that were open because by default, Word 
saves your document(s) every ten minutes while you’re working on it. You 
can change the save time interval within the AutoRecover setting in the 
Word Preferences. Here’s how to find and change the AutoRecover setting:
 
1. Choose Word➪Preferences.
 
 The Word Preferences dialog opens.

Book II

2. Choose Save.
 
 Word’s Save preferences are displayed, as shown in Figure 2-4.
 
3. Change the number of minutes in the Save AutoRecover Info Every: 
[X] Minutes setting.
 
 Deselect this setting if you don’t want Word to save an AutoRecover file. 
You might do this for extremely large documents that take a long time to 
save.
 
 You don’t need to select the Always Create Backup Copy check box. 
With AutoRecover and Time Machine, the bases are covered. The option 
is only there for backward compatibility.
 
4. Click OK when you’re finished.

Rarely, Word might not automatically display the AutoRecover file for the 
document(s) you were working on the next time you open Word. In that 
case, do the following in Word to open the AutoRecover file:
 
1. In Word, choose File➪Open.
 
 The Open dialog appears.

176
Saving Word Documents
 
2. Type AutoRecover in the Spotlight Search box on the top right of the 
Open dialog.
 
 Spotlight lists all AutoRecover files on the selected volume. Click 
Computer if you don’t see one or more AutoRecover files. Of course, 
if your Word document had been open before changing your settings 
in AutoRecover preferences or if you deselected AutoRecover in Word 
Preferences, you won’t have anything to recover.
 
3. Double-click the most recently saved AutoRecover file, or select the 
file and click Open.
 
 If the file you want is grayed-out, choose All Files in the Enable pop-up 
menu, which allows you to open any file type that was previously 
restricted.
 
You can also use Mac OS X Time Machine to recover any file that you’ve 
saved at least once. When you use Word for Mac, it’s nearly impossible to 
lose more than a few minutes worth of work thanks to AutoRecover and 
Time Machine.
Saving Word Documents
Most of the time saving a file in Word is a very simple task. But at times, you 
may want to limit access to a particular file. Or maybe you want to save a 
document so that it’s compatible with older versions of Word; or perhaps 
you want to save your document in a format that’s compatible with other 
programs. Or maybe you want to send a document via e-mail or Microsoft 
Messenger; or put it online as a Web page. The Word Save As options 
accommodate all these needs and more.
Just close me
This may seem somewhat obvious, but Word keeps track of whether a docu-
ment’s been changed since it was opened last. If you close a document after 
making any changes at all, Word displays a dialog asking whether you want 
to save changes.
 
✦ If you click Save, Word replaces the old version of your document with 
the current version.
 
✦ If you click Don’t Save, well, Word doesn’t save your changes (and yes, 
at times, you don’t want your changes made and would rather start 
over with the original document). Word closes your document, and any 
changes you made since the last save are discarded.
 
✦ If you click Cancel, Word thinks you really didn’t mean to close the 
window and keeps the document open just as it was before you tried to 
close the window.

Saving Word Documents
Giving a document a new name, a new location
When you open a new, blank document, it starts off with a generic name, 
such as Document 1. That’s not much help when you want to find your file 
again later, but it’s easy to fix:
 
1. Choose File➪Save As.
 
 The Save As dialog appears. By default Word uses whatever you typed in 
the first line of the document as the filename.
 
2. (Optional) In the Save As field, type in a new name.
 
3. Navigate to the desired location and click Save.
 
 A good place to store documents is in the Documents folder. Save As 
dialogs have a New Folder button in the lower-left corner in case you 
want to create a new folder in which to save your document.
 
If you want to save time typing a filename, we have a little trick you can use. 
While the Save As dialog is open, you can navigate to a file and then click it. 
Your current document takes the name of the document you click. Keep that 
name if you want to replace the document you clicked with the current doc-
ument, or modify the name a little to make a new version of the document. 
Of course, this trick isn’t Word-specific; it works with any other program!
Securing Word documents
Sometimes you absolutely don’t want everyone, including Aunt Millie and 
her 16th nephew opening or editing a document. You can control who can 
do what with a particular document by using the helpful Options button in 
the Save As dialog. This brings up the Save preferences dialog, as shown in 
Figure 2-4.
Now, we realize that what we’re going to tell you isn’t necessarily the fast-
est way to get at the settings, but we think it certainly is the coolest way to 
get there. If you normally choose File➪Save As and then click the Options 
button; you might prefer our method because it’s more fun. For the record, 
these settings are in Word’s Preferences on the Security panel. Sure, you can 
get there by using the menus, but follow along and watch what happens:
 
1. With your Word document open, choose File➪Save As.
 
 The Save As dialog opens.
 
2. Click the Options button.
 
 The Save preferences dialog is displayed (refer to Figure 2-4).
 
3. Click in the Search Word Preferences Search field.
 
 The Save preferences dialog magically turns into the Word Preferences 
dialog — so cool!

178
Saving Word Documents
 
4. Type pass in the Search Word preferences field.
 
 The Security option is highlighted — also cool! (See Figure 2-5.)

5. Press Return, Enter, or click Security.
 
 The Security preferences dialog opens. See Figure 2-6.
When you’re in Word’s Security preferences dialog, Security Options for 
“Document Name” section apply only to the currently active Word document. 
The Privacy Options section includes settings that are retained by Word 
for all documents. We look at the settings in Figure 2-6 more closely in the 
following sections.
Security Options for “Document Name”
 
✦ Password to Open: If you type a password here, a password must be 
used whenever that saved document is opened. Be sure to keep a 
record of the password somewhere. Five years from now, you might 
not remember what it is. Better yet, choose File➪Save As to save a 
protected version and keep a version without protection, just for you.
 
✦ Password to Modify: If you type a password here, you require someone 
to enter that password to modify a document that’s been opened 
already. Password to Modify is independent from Password to Open.

remarks into comments and then set Word so the comments don’t 
display. When they send the document to someone who should never 
see the comments, that person can turn on comments, and there they 
are! Word can’t stop you from saying things that might prove embarrassing 
later, but it can warn you that your document has comments or tracked 
changes.
 
✦ Save Preview Picture with New Documents check box: Wait! This 
setting is on the Save preferences dialog, as shown in Figure 2-4. If 
there’s a chance the File icon could reveal something personal or 
private, deselect this.
 
✦ Prompt for Document Properties check box: This setting is also in the 
Save preferences dialog, as shown in Figure 2-4. Every Word document 
has a Properties dialog that hardly anyone knows about or uses. Well, in 
Windows Vista, some of the information in the Properties dialog, such as 
Author, is displayed along with the File icon. Select this and take a peek 
at what’s on the Summary tab of the Properties dialog and make sure 
nothing’s there that could come back and bite you later.
Turning your document into a template
A lot of work is involved in creating a special document that has the layout, 
the fonts, and the design you want. You can reuse that special document 
as a starting point for new documents, which saves you the time of doing 
it all from scratch again. In Word, these special documents are templates. 
Whether the template is a form, a business letter, an invitation, a tent card, 
or simply a document formatted in a way that you plan to use again, you 
can save your work as a template so that identical copies can be made on 
demand without altering the original by mistake!
Say you do volunteer work at the local Humane Society and you regularly 
make a flyer about found animals. Project Gallery has a built-in Lost and 
Found template that you can customize for your local society. After you 
make customizations (see Chapter 7 of this minibook) to the template, you 
can save your customizations as a template. Do the following:
 
1. In Word, Choose File➪Save As.
 
 The Save As dialog appears.
 
2. In the Save As text box, enter a filename.

4. Click Save.
 
 Your template is saved and will show up in Project Gallery.
To use your customized templates, go to Project Gallery, click the New tab, 
and choose My Templates from the Category list, as shown in Figure 2-7.
 
Figure 2-7: 
Locating

We just showed you an Office-specific way of saving a document as a 
template. There’s another way using Mac OS X instead of Office. Mac OS X 
allows you to turn any document file from any application into a template. 
To turn a document into a template in Finder, choose File➪Get Info. In the 
General section, select the Stationery Pad check box. Templates made this 
way aren’t in Project Gallery. To turn a Stationery template back into a 
regular document, repeat the procedure and deselect the Stationery Pad 
check box.
Being compatible with others
Being aware and respectful of other people’s tastes is key to getting along 
with everyone in this world. Microsoft promotes this concept well in Word 
by giving you a lot of file format choices.
You have Office 2008, but remember, not everyone else does. At times, you 
may need to save your files in a format that people with other software can 
open. Knowing the software capabilities of the people you’re communicat-
ing with helps you choose the most appropriate format. Fortunately, almost 
every word processor can use certain file formats.
Word 2008 launches the newest file format for Microsoft Word documents 
on the Mac. The new files have an x at the end of the filename to signify that 
they’re eXtensible Markup Language (XML) documents. Table 2-1 gives a 
rundown on the various extensions you find in the Save As dialog:

182
Saving Word Documents
Table 2-1 
Save As Formats and Compatibility
File Type

Compatibility
Word Document
.docx
Fully compatible with Word 2008 (Mac) and 
Word 2007 (Windows). This format has good 
compatibility with Word 2004 (Mac) and Word 
2003 (Windows) when the latest 2003 and 2004 
updates and converters are installed (available 
for free from the Microsoft site). New 2007 and 
2008 features aren’t supported fully by 2003 and 
2004, but you can open the DOCX format with 
older versions and still view and print the DOCX 
documents — but you can’t edit them with the 
same capabilities.
OpenOffice version 3 and Apple Pages (part of 
iWork) can open these documents, but their 
conversion process changes how the documents 
look and work.
Word Template
.dotx
Same compatibility benefits and issues as 
explained for Word Document (DOCX).
Word Document 
Stationery
.doc
When you choose Word Document Stationery 
in Word’s Save As dialog, your document is 
saved as a Stationery file in Word 97–2004 file 
format. This is the same as using Finder’s Get 
Info command to turn a document into a Mac OS 
X Stationery template. To turn a (DOCX) format 
document into a Stationery template, flip back to 
the section, “Turning your document into a tem-
plate,” earlier in this chapter.
PDF (Portable 
Document Format)
.pdf
The PDF format is a great way to distribute a 
Word document when you want the recipient 
to be able to view and print your document just 
the way you saved it, regardless of what fonts 
the recipient has installed on her Mac. Your 
document retains its fonts and formatting on just 
about every computer. This is also a good file 
format when you don’t want anyone editing or 
changing your document in any way.
Word Macro–
Enabled Document
.docm
If you receive a Word document that has Visual 
Basic macros from Windows Word 2007, you 
can open, work on, and save the document body 
while keeping the macros intact, even though 
Word 2008 can’t edit or use the macros.

New format XML Word documents are zipped folders that contain XML files, 
which are simply text files containing HTML and XML. If you’re really into 
this sort of thing, you can unzip and open the actual XML files by using a 
utility, such as Smith Micro’s StuffIt or StuffIt Expander (free).
Sending copies everywhere — fast!
No need to wait for a special moment to send a Word document. You can do 
it right from Word: Choose File➪Send To, and you even have choices about 
how the document can get to where it’s going. Here are your options:
 
✦ Send to Mail Recipient as HTML: This method takes advantage of 
Word’s ability to create HTML documents, and most modern e-mail 
programs do a decent job of interpreting HTML mail. Use this method 
when exact reproduction isn’t critical, and the recipient doesn’t need 
to edit the document. However, do remember that e-mail sizes can be 
considerably larger if you use this option. To get a better idea of how 
your document will look when received, choose View➪Layout before 
sending.
 
✦ Send to Mail Recipient as Attachment: When you want the recipient 
to get an exact copy of the Word document, use this option to send the 
active document as an e-mail attachment.
 
✦ Send to Microsoft Messenger Contact: This option becomes available 
when Microsoft Messenger is open at the same time Word is open. The 
contact instantly receives a copy of the Word document in Word format.
 
✦ Send to Microsoft PowerPoint: PowerPoint as a possible recipient might 
seem odd, but that’s not exactly the case. The purpose of this option is 
to allow you to use Microsoft Word to create an outline. Then you send 
the outline to PowerPoint, which can turn it into a presentation.

A
fter you have your document underway, you discover how important 
formatting and fine-tuning your document are. Although the type of 
formatting and fine-tuning you do is related to your personality, some things 
are surprisingly universal. Foremost among these similarities is an observation: 
It’s one thing to get down words, but as a Mac user, you want them to look 
their best. Readers appreciate the time that writers spend to make their 
work readable. Some writers enjoy creating documents that pay attention 
to finer details, such as the spacing among lines and characters, as well as 
kerning and paragraph formatting. This chapter covers Word’s ability to 
help you create documents with style.
Triumphing Over Text
Before we begin the discussion about working with text, we want to mention 
the single most important feature in all of Office: the Undo button. The 
ability to easily back out of document changes makes it easy to be daring, 
but not reckless. Some things, such as file operations, can’t be undone. But 
most of the changes you make in your Word documents aren’t set in stone.
Most people know that each time you click the Undo button, the most 
recent change is undone. Some people even know that each successive click 
of the Undo button reverts the next most recent change, and you can keep 
clicking the Undo button until you’ve undone all the changes in the document’s 
Undo history. But only a select few know that you can click the down arrow 
next the Undo button (see Figure 3-1). This reveals the Undo history with 
the most recent action on top. And if you like, you can undo multiple actions 
all at once with one click.

Formatting deftly with the Formatting Palette
Plain old text can be monotonous, ineffective, and boring all at the same 
time. If this book had just one font and no illustrations, you might have left 
it on the shelf at the store — and we’re so very happy that you didn’t. We 
show you how you can make your documents more interesting and readable 
by judicious use of fonts and formatting. Word has an amazing context-aware 
Formatting Palette that pays attention to what you’ve selected so that you 
can quickly apply formatting. (To read more about the Formatting Palette, 
head to Book I, Chapter 4.)
To change text, you first have to select it. Table 3-1 lists the various ways 
you can select text in Word. After you select text, the Formatting Palette 
shows style and formatting settings for the selected text.
Table 3-1

While we’re on the subject of selecting things, Word has a default When 
Selecting, Automatically Select Entire Word option in preferences. 
Fortunately though, you can change this setting. By default, when you drag 
over text in Word, the cursor selects entire words at a time. This might 
bother you when you’re trying to select only a portion of a word, but you 
can tell Word to knock it off. Here’s how:

Nobody wants to be seen as lazy, apathetic, or boring just because his 
document is lifeless and unexciting. To avoid that, select some text and 
apply a new font. The Formatting Palette has some new features in the Font 
section. New in Word 2008, fonts are now organized by Font Collections, 
Document Theme, and then by a list of fonts. This arrangement makes it 
easier to pick fonts for special occasions, fonts that match a specific purpose, 
and fonts that are compatible with Windows versions of Microsoft Office. 
(See Figure 3-2.)

The next item on the Formatting Palette is font size control (see Figure 3-3). 
As in previous versions, you can click the Size pop-up menu and then choose 
a font size, or you can type the specific point size that you want into the Size 
box. But with the new slider feature, you can adjust the font size by dragging 
the slider. This new slider is a small thing, yet it makes using the Formatting 
Palette dynamic and interactive.
Other handy formatting options are also at your fingertips on the Formatting 
Palette. These include
 
✦ Bold: Applies bold to the selected text.
 
✦ Italics: Applies italic to the selected text.
 
✦ Font Color: Applies the color you choose to the selected text.
 
✦ Highlight Color: Applies a color background to the selected text.
 
✦ Superscript: Raises the selected text and shrinks it. Also dubbed a power 
or a superior.

✦ Subscript: Lowers the selected text and shrinks it.
 
✦ Small Caps: Makes selected text all capitals, but not all one size. Notice 
the first letter of the sentence is taller.
 
✦ All Caps: Makes selected text all capitals of the same size.
In addition to these options, you have other formatting categories on the 
Formatting Palette to consider. Click the disclosure triangles to expose the 
options available in each of these categories:
 
✦ Styles: Apply pre-configured combinations of formatting options, in 
particular heading styles. See the section, “Writing with Style,” later in 
this chapter.
 
✦ Borders and Shadings: Apply border lines and shading to selected text.
 
 Each option in the Borders and Shading section of the Formatting 
Palette is a pop-up menu. Borders appear at paragraph marks, and using 
this section is simple and straightforward. Select some text, click the 
pop-up menus, and choose from the available options. The text shown in 
Figure 3-4 has two different shadings applied.
 
✦ Bullets and Numbering: Toggle on or off automatic indenting with 
special character or ordered numbers for lists. See the section, 
“Shooting bullets and numbing numbers,” later in this chapter.
 
Simplicity is a good rule to follow. Use one or two fonts in your documents, 
and use them in a couple sizes only, such as a large font for headings and a 
small font for regular text.

Dropping a cap
The Drop Cap feature isn’t about losing your hat; it’s just about adding 
beauty to your text with an option that’s more familiar to print designers. In 
the days of yore, a typesetter would painstakingly use wooden blocks and 
then drop in a large, fancy capital letter at the beginning of the first sentence 
of a new chapter. In typesetting jargon, this embellishment is a drop cap. To 
make a drop cap, select the first character of the first paragraph in a document 
and then choose Format➪Drop Cap. Figure 3-5 shows a drop cap for T.
 
Figure 3-5: 
Making a 
drop cap the 
easy way.
 
As shown in Figure 3-5, the first character that comprises the actual drop 
cap doesn’t have to be the same font as the rest of the paragraph. You can 
find special, embellished fonts that work very well as drop caps.
When you create your drop cap, you can set the number of lines of text that 
the drop cap uses, and whether the cap will appear dropped, as shown in 
Figure 3-5, or in the left margin. The None option restores a drop cap to the 
character that it was before you turned it into a drop cap.

Spacing sweetly
Sometimes you want your text on a page to be aesthetically pleasing. 
Consider how important it is to have a poem look just right to create the 
right ambience on the page. In these situations, you might need to adjust 
the text spacing to make things look nice. Word 2008 enables you to make 
adjustments to the spacing between the letters, or kerning, as well as control 
line spacing and paragraph spacing. When working with the Alignment and 
Spacing section, the settings apply to entire paragraphs (see Figure 3-6). 
Click anywhere in a paragraph or select multiple paragraphs when you apply 
these formatting options.

Although using the Formatting Palette is quick and easy, Word offers an 
older version of the same controls over the spacing and indentation of your 
text. To get at the old-style line and paragraph spacing controls:
 
1. Select the text you want to fine-tune and then choose 
Format➪Paragraph.
 
 The Paragraph dialog appears, as shown in Figure 3-7.
 
2. Make adjustments as desired and click OK when you’re finished.
 
You can use negative numbers for negative indentation.

Kicking in kerning
We know; kerning sounds like jargon. However, kerning is a fancy word for 
the space between two letters. Usually kerning comes into play when dealing 
with text in large point sizes, such as in a headline, for example. A capital 
letter, such as W, can look too far away from a small a or the rest of the 
letters in a word, especially when a large point size is used. Adjusting the 
kerning can make it “look right.” Figure 3-8 shows the same text without 
kerning (top) and with kerning (bottom). Notice that the bottom one looks 
“right,” whereas the W and the a are too far apart in the top one.
 
Not all fonts support kerning, but the ones you get from professional 
typesetting companies, such as Monotype or Adobe, normally do. Because 
support for kerning isn’t a given, check your font’s specifications with the 
font’s vendor or manufacturer to ascertain whether any given font supports 
kerning.

Assuming that the font you choose in Word supports kerning, follow these 
steps to kern:
 
1. Select the word, sentence, or paragraph you want to kern and then 
choose Format➪Font.
 
 The Font dialog appears.
 
2. Select the Character Spacing tab, as shown in Figure 3-9.
 
3. Select the Kerning for Fonts option and type 20 in the Points and 
Above number box.
 
 Most of the time, Word doesn’t allow you to type any number lower than 
eight in the Points and Above number box.
 
4. Click OK to return to the selected text.

Spacing the characters
A companion concept to kerning is tracking, or character spacing. Kerning 
comes into play only with individual characters, whereas character spacing 
controls the amount of space among all the selected letters in your document.
 
Think of kerning as spacing based on the shapes of the letters, and character 
spacing as spacing just based on the distance between the letters, whatever 
their shapes might be.
Word allows you to increase or decrease character spacing to pack the letters 
tighter or stretch them out more. To increase or decrease the spacing 
between the letters of the selected text, follow these steps:

menu of options.
 
• Spacing: Click the Normal, Expanded, or Condensed pop-up menu. 
This controls the amount of space between words based on these 
parameters by increasing or decreasing the By [number] in points. 
Although you can go down to 1 point with the Decrease option

By [number] box, even something as low as 0.05 point.

• Kerning: See the preceding section.
Making friends with subscript and superscript
When you get thirsty for a glass of good old H2O, it better be crystal clear 
and the 2 better be a subscript between the H and the O. Otherwise, it won’t 
taste like water because it’s not water; it’s some other chemical composition. 
Of course you can do fancy stuff, such as use the Equation Editor, which we 
explain in Book I, Chapter 6, but most of the time all you have to do is select 
a character and then click the Subscript (or Superscript, depending on what 
you’re doing) button on the Formatting Palette, as appropriate.
Using special characters for special occasions
Deep inside each font are special characters that can be used as long as you 
know how to find them. For example, the new Symbols section of Formatting 
Palette offers several choices and replaces the Symbol option on the Format 
menu from previous Word versions.
Still, many more interesting characters are living within your fonts. Mac OS X 
has a nifty Characters Palette to put these characters to work. Before you 
can use the Characters Palette, you have to turn it on in Mac OS X System 
Preferences. Follow these steps to turn on the Characters Palette:
 
1. Choose Apple Menu➪System Preferences.
 
 The System Preferences pane appears.
 
2. In the Personal category, click the International button to change the 
sheet to a multi-tabbed interface.

3. Click the Input Menu tab.
 
4. Select the Character Palette option to turn it on.
 
 By default, the Character Palette option also selects the Show Input 
Menu in Menu Bar option at the bottom of the sheet.
 
 The Input menu is the flag for your computer’s default language and 
appears on the right in the menu bar. See Figure 3-10.
 
5. Click the red Close button to close System Preferences.
With the Characters Palette turned on, it’s time to put it to work. To use the 
Characters Palette, follow these steps:
 
1. In Word, position the cursor in your document at the point you want 
to enter a special character.
 
2. Click the Input Menu in your menu bar. (See Figure 3-10.)
 
Figure 3-10:

4. Select a character to insert into your document; then click Insert.
 
 The selected character is inserted into your Word document at the 
insertion cursor.
 
5. Click the red Close button to close the Characters Palette.
The Characters Palette depicts special characters, and when you choose 
one in the Category list, it shows you all the existing glyph variants in the 
Collections pop-up menu. (A glyph is the artistic drawing, or shape, that 
comprises an individual character within a character set.) Simply select 
a symbol and then click the Insert or Insert with Font button in the lower-
right corner. (The Characters Palette decides which option to offer based 
upon the fonts in your document.) Notice the options in the lower left and 
also the Search box to help you find symbols quickly. The example in Figure 
3-11 shows how to find a slashed zero that doesn’t look like a capital O. The 
Characters Palette is extraordinarily interactive, so your screen might not 
look exactly like this figure.

Creating a list with the Formatting Palette
Turning a list into a bulleted or numbered list is easy as pie with the 
Formatting Palette. Try this simple example (see Figure 3-12):
 
1. Type a simple list.
 
 For example, enter this text:

2. Select the list or a sequence of small paragraphs.
 
3. Click the appropriate bullet or number type on the Formatting Palette.
 
 Your list has either the bullet style or number style you chose. If you 
chose a numbered list, it looks much like Figure 3-12, with consecutive 
numbers in front of each item.

✦ Type: Choose bullets on the left or numbers on the right.
 
✦ Indent: Click the left button to decrease indentation or the right button 
to increase indentation.
 
✦ Style: Choose from available bullet and number styles. We show you 
how to customize these styles in the following sections.
 
✦ Start: In a numbered list, choose the starting number.
If your document already has a numbered list somewhere, Word may display 
a small widget, as shown in Figure 3-12. Click the widget and you can start 
the numbering over. Of course, you could always change the Start number 
on the Formatting Palette to restart at any number you choose.
Starting a numbered list automatically
Word’s default AutoCorrect setting detects automatically when you’re 
starting a numbered list. To make Word think you’re starting a numbered 
list, do the following:
 
1. Type some text and then press Return or Enter.
 
2. Type 1 followed by a period, a space, and some text.
 
3. Press Return or Enter.

Telling Word to stop adding bullets or numbers
The easiest way to turn off bullets and numbering is to select the text you 
don’t want formatted with bullets or numbers and click the appropriate 
Bullets or Numbers button on the Formatting Palette to turn it off.
If you are typing a bulleted list and you want to tell Word that you’ve typed 
the last entry for the list, simply press Return or Enter twice after the last 
entry in the list. Word returns to normal text.
Starting over in the middle of a list
You may need to start over your numbering in the middle of a list. Follow 
these steps to start over your numbering in the middle of list (see Figure 3-13):
 
1. Select the text where you want numbering to restart.
 
2. Right-click or Control-click, and then choose Restart Numbering from 
the pop-up menu.
 
 Word starts the numbers from the first number that you have in the 
Start field of the Bullets and Numbering section of the Formatting 
Palette.

Making special bullets and numbers
In the “Using special characters for special occasions” section, earlier in 
this chapter, we talk about using special characters. You may be wondering 
whether you can use these characters to make your bulleted and numbered 
lists more interesting. Well, yes you can. Word allows you to take advantage 
of special characters, and you can even use pictures (although it’s best to 
use very tiny ones) as bullets or numbers. After you create something you’re 
happy with, you can create new styles based on your customized bulleted 
and numbered lists so that you can apply them to other lists later.
Word supports seven indent layers of bullets and numbers (which are 
probably way more layers than you’ll ever need, but it’s good to know the 
depth is there if you ever do need it). The current formatting for each of 
the layers can be viewed and then customized. Choose Format➪Bullets and 
Numbering. This brings up the Bullets and Numbering dialog (see Figure 3-14). 
This dialog allows you to customize each level of bullet or number. Across 
the top of the dialog are four tabs:
 
✦ Bulleted: Customize a bullet for each of the layers.
 
✦ Numbered: Set style and formatting options for numbered lists.
 
✦ Outline Numbered: Customize options for working in Outline View.
 
✦ List Styles: Create and save list customizations as styles.
Each of the four tabs of the Bullets and Numbering dialog, as shown in 
Figure 3-14, has its own special customization options. The first two, 
Bulleted and Numbered, work similarly, so we start with them. In Figure 
3-14, you can see the bulleted list styles, and we’ve selected the first indent, 
which is a dot by default.
Loving legal beagles and authors of long documents
Some of our readers might spend a lot of time working in Outline view, in 
particular those in the legal profession and writing long documents, such 
as books and manuscripts. The Outline Numbered tab of the Bullets and 
Numbering dialog will be of particular interest to you. On this tab, you can 
choose from different styles that apply to the entire bullets and numbering 
scheme. Of the eight choices presented, legal professionals will be most 
interested in the bottom-left style, Article 1. Follow these steps to turn on 
legal formatting for long documents:
 
1. Select the sentence, text, phrase, or paragraph that you want to format 
the numbers for.
 
 Alternatively, place your insertion point in that block of text.
 
2. Choose Format➪Bullets and Numbering.
 
 The Bullets and Numbering dialog opens (refer to Figure 3-12).

Painless paragraph formatting
Whether prose or poetry, a business report or a science project, you can 
have a paragraph call attention to itself by changing the paragraph’s 
formatting. Conversely, you have a potential problem on your hands when 
a paragraph unintentionally calls attention to itself when it crosses a page 
boundary.

Dealing with widows and orphans
Earlier in this chapter, we discuss indents and spacing paragraph controls. 
Here we delve into different aspects of paragraph control. A paragraph that 
starts with a single line at the bottom of a page and then continues onto the 
next is a widow; its counterpart, the orphan, occurs when the last line of a 
paragraph ends at the top of a page.
Widows and orphans aside, it’s good to know that Word allows you to 
control paragraph formatting so that you can call attention to paragraphs 
when you want to, and to avoid unhappy problems like widows and orphans. 
To get at these paragraph formatting controls:
 
1. Choose Format➪Paragraph.
 
 The Paragraph dialog opens.
 
2. Click the Line and Page Breaks tab.
 
 Line and page break settings become available, as shown in Figure 3-15.

Although widow and orphan control is the main claim to fame of the Line

put a check into its check boxes:

Book II
Chapter 3
Working with 
Text, Words, and 
Paragraphs
201
Triumphing Over Text
Pagination
These check boxes affect paragraphs:
 
✦ Widow/Orphan Control: Prevents widows and orphans.
 
✦ Keep Lines Together: Sometimes Word’s paragraph spacing can cause 
text that ought to stay together to get separated. For example, you might 
have a heading near the end of a page and you want the heading to stay 
associated with the paragraph that follows. Word wants to put the 
heading at the bottom of a page and then the associated text winds up 
all by itself at the top of the next page. To prevent this problem, select 
both the heading and the following paragraph, and then select this 
check box. Word keeps the text and the heading together.
 
✦ Keep with Next: You may wish to make sure two paragraphs are always 
kept together. Select both paragraphs and then select this check box. 
Word won’t allow a page break to come between them.
 
✦ Page Break Before: If you have a paragraph that you want to always 
start at the top of its page, select a paragraph and then select this check 
box. Word makes sure a page break always occurs before the selected 
paragraph.
Other options
Here are some other options you can choose from the Paragraph dialog:
 
✦ Suppress Line Numbers check box: This works if you’ve turned on line 
numbering, which we discuss in the section, “Automatically Number 
Lines,” later in this chapter. The lines that are selected when you choose 
this option aren’t included in the page count.
 
✦ Don’t Hyphenate check box: This check box does what it says. Select 
paragraphs that you don’t want Word to use hyphenation with and then 
select this check box.
 
✦ Tabs button: Click this button to display the Tabs dialog (see the section, 
“Precision tab placement,” later in this chapter), which we discuss in the 
following section.
Tinkering with tabs
The old-fashioned idea of a basic tab stop is that when you press the Tab key, 
the cursor jumps to the next tab stop that’s set on the ruler and then you start 
typing. In Word, this kind of tab stop is the left tab stop. These days, tabs do a 
lot more than just act as a position to stop the cursor. Read on!
Working with the Tabs menu
Word has five types of tab stops. To see the list of tabs, you must use a view 
that supports rulers. Follow these steps:

202
Triumphing Over Text
 
1. Choose either View➪Draft or View➪Print Layout View.
 
 Both views support rulers.
 
2. Choose View➪Ruler if the ruler isn’t turned on already.
 
 You can see Word’s rulers.
 
3. Click the Tabs menu to the far left of the horizontal ruler.
 
 The Tabs menu, as shown in Figure 3-16, appears.
 
Figure 3-16: 
Displaying

Click for Tabs menu.

Tabs menu
Left tab stop
Notice the five kinds of tabs in Figure 3-16, each with its own icon. Left is the 
default tab. If you choose a different kind of tab, the Tabs menu displays the 
selected kind of tab.
 
 When you work with tabs, be sure to toggle paragraph marks on and off with 
the Show All Non-Printing Characters button on the Standard toolbar. This 
button is simply labeled Show on the toolbar. When paragraph marks are 
turned on, they look like the icon in the margin. Whenever you press the Tab 
key, an arrow pointing to the right appears.
Setting a tab stop
Tabs work at the paragraph level; when you set tab stops, they work with 
the currently selected paragraphs. You can select an entire document before 
you set tabs if you want your tab stops to work for the whole thing. The 
actual steps to set a tab stop are simple:
 
1. Select one or more paragraphs.
 
 If you want to select the entire document, choose Edit➪Select All or 
press Ô-A.

2. Click the Tabs menu (see Figure 3-16) and choose one of the five tab 
stops.
 
 See the following section for more detail about each tab stop option.
 
3. Click in the horizontal ruler wherever you want a tab stop.
 
 Each time you click, the symbol for the tab stop you chose is placed into 
the ruler.
The five kinds of tab stops
Your paragraph behaves differently for each of the five kinds of tab stops. 
Here’s a description of each kind of tab stop:
 
✦ Left: By default, each document has a left tab stop every 
1⁄2 inch, unless 
you click in the ruler to add your own stops. If you press the Tab key, 
the cursor advances to the next tab stop. If you start typing at a left tab 
stop, your text begins at that tab stop. See Figure 3-17.

✦ Right: After you set a right tab stop, press the Tab key to move to the 
right tab stop and start typing. Use a right tab to right-align text, perhaps 
when making a column. See Figure 3-18.

✦ Center: After you set a center tab stop, press the Tab key to move to the 
stop. When you start typing, your text is centered below the tab stop. 
See Figure 3-19.

✦ Decimal: As the name implies, use this tab stop when you’re typing 
decimal numbers. Word lines up the numbers at the decimal point. Even 
if you don’t type an actual decimal point, Word assumes the decimal 
point.
 
✦ Bar: Danger: Using a bar tab stop may cause inebriation. Okay, not 
really. A bar tab stop is much the same as a left tab stop, except Word 
puts a vertical bar at the tab stop. After you set a bar stop and start 
typing, your text is to the right of the bar. See Figure 3-20.

Precision tab placement
Although clicking in the ruler to place tabs is fast and easy, you may have a 
need for precise tab positioning. You can approach this in several ways, but 
we suggest you try to click into the ruler to place your tab stop(s) first. You 
can drag tabs in the ruler to reposition them. If that placement isn’t precise 
enough for you, choose Tabs . . . from the Tabs menu (see Figure 3-16) to 
open the Tabs dialog, as shown in Figure 3-21, where you can fine-tune to 
thousandths of an inch.
The Tabs dialog has lots of tab settings that you can control. When working 
with this dialog, your changes aren’t committed until you press OK. Here’s 
the run down:
 
✦ Default Tab Stops: When you open a new, blank document, a tab stop 
exists every 
1⁄2-inch — even though there’s no tab stop marker to show 
this in the ruler. You can press the Tab key in a blank document if you 
don’t believe us. You can adjust the default setting, but we can’t think of 
any particular reason to do so.

✦ Clear All button: Marks all tab stops for the current paragraph and 
notes this in the Tab Stops to be Cleared area. The stops clear when you 
click OK.
 
✦ Leader: For left, right, center, and decimal tab stops, selecting one of 
these adds the selected style as a fill between the tab stops.

Clearing tab stops
To remove a tab stop, you can simply drag a tab stop from the ruler and 
then release the mouse anywhere. This works only about half the time, 
though. Use the Tabs dialog (see Figure 3-21) if you come across a stubborn 
tab that won’t go away.
Formatting an Entire Document
When you think of a document as a whole, elements such as columns, 
margins, and page breaks come to mind. Knowing how to manage these 
elements helps you create a better, more consistent layout. In this section, 
we discuss controls that when applied, affect the entire document.
Ruling margins by the Ruler
Most people are accustomed to seeing a perimeter style margin surrounding 
the text in documents. You’d have a hard time reading a book if the type 
went from edge-to-edge on each page. In a book or magazine in which the 
sheets are bound, you need extra white space, or gutter, in addition to a 
margin. Even normal documents that need to be printed and filed need that 
gutter.
Paper can become tattered, which is one more reason to keep the text away 
from the edges. Even when reading on a computer screen or a handheld 
device, your eyes seem to prefer the definition a clean margin provides.
 
 You can adjust the margins by dragging the margin sliders in the rulers. Of 
course, the rulers must be turned on first by choosing View➪Ruler when in 
Draft View or Print Layout View. This turns on the rulers at the top and left 
edge of the document area in Word.
Even then, many users find it easier to adjust margins with a dialog. Follow 
these instructions to display the margin settings in the Document dialog:
 
1. Choose Format➪Document.
 
2. Click the Margins tag.
 
 The Document dialog (as shown in Figure 3-22) opens. You can type in 
exact values for the margins so that you can keep consistent margin 
values in all your documents.
The Margins tab of the Document dialog is straightforward. Enter decimal 
values for distances in inches or use the up/down buttons next to the input 
fields. You need to know about the following other aspects of the Margins tab:

✦ Mirror Margins: Select this check box to use mirror margins and a 
gutter when you set up a document to be printed with facing pages, such 
as a book or a magazine. If a regular physical book is open, the extra 
gutter on the page to your left is mirrored on the page to your right so 
that the text is kept away from the binding by an equal amount on both 
pages.
 
✦ Apply To: Choose from the following:
 
• Whole Document: The settings apply to the entire document.
 
• Selected Text: The settings apply to whatever text you selected 
before opening the Document dialog.
 
✦ Default: Default turns the current settings into Word’s default settings to 
be used from now on when creating new, blank documents. This setting 
is stored in Word’s Normal (.dotx) template.
 
✦ Page Setup: Displays the Page Setup dialog (see Chapter 8 of this 
minibook).
 
✦ Cancel: Closes the Document dialog without applying changes to the 
document. If you click the Default button, those changes are done.
 
✦ OK: Applies the changes.

208
Formatting an Entire Document
 
The Document Margins section of the Formatting Palette also enables you to 
manually set the margins for your document.
Breaking up things
 
 As documents grow, they need to be broken into manageable parts. The 
longer a document gets, the more parts it’s likely to have. We focus on three 
specific kinds of breaks — page breaks, section breaks, and column breaks — 
to achieve manageable parts.
 
Click the Show button on the Standard toolbar to toggle on and off your 
ability to see breaks in your document.
Page breaks
Page breaks are points in your document where one page ends and the next 
page starts. Most of the time Word can handle these breaks automatically, 
but at times, you want to force a page break — to begin a new chapter, for 
example. This is accomplished easily: Click in your document where you 
want to force a break and then choose Insert➪Break➪Page Break.
 
To remove a page break, make sure that you’ve enabled the Show All 
Non-Printing Characters option. Then double-click the page break so that 
it’s highlighted and press the Delete key on your keyboard.
Section breaks
Section breaks are points in your document where formatting changes, such 
as margin settings, header and footer formatting, styles, and page setup, 
occur. To create a section break:
 
1. Click where you want the desired break to occur and then choose 
Insert➪Break (see Figure 3-23).
 
2. Choose one of the following options:
 
• Section Break (Next Page): Creates a section break and a page break 
at the same spot.
 
• Section Break (Continuous): Creates a section break at the insertion 
cursor without forcing a new page.
 
• Section Break (Odd Page): Sets a section break that’s always at the 
top of the next odd-numbered page.
 
• Section Break (Even Page): Sets a section break that’s always at the 
top of the next even-numbered page.

Formatting an Entire Document
If you choose to display non-printing characters (see the section, “Working 
with the Tabs menu,” earlier in this chapter), you can see the break indicator 
at the beginning or end of a section. Break formatting information is contained 
within the indicator, so you can copy and paste breaks as a way to copy and 
paste formatting within a document, or even from one document to another.
 
Figure 3-23: 
Sectioning a 
document.
 
Making columns
You can put text into columns in Word. Follow these steps (see Figure 3-24):
 
1. Select the text you wish to put into columns and then click the 
Columns button on the Standard toolbar.
 
 A submenu appears.
 
2. Move the mouse cursor over the submenu.
 
 As your mouse cursor moves over the submenu, the number of columns 
lights up. When you move to the right, the submenu grows.
 
3. Click the number of columns you want.
 
 Word automatically turns your text into the number of columns you 
chose. Word inserts a continuous section break (see the preceding 
section) before and after the text that’s now in columns.
After you have text in columns, you can adjust the width between the columns 
by dragging column width indicators in the ruler. Section break indicators 
are visible when you click the Show All Non-Printing Characters button on 
the Standard toolbar. To restore multiple columns to a single column, select 
the column text and follow the steps you used to create the columns, but 
choose to make one column.
Tickling footers and watching your header
 
People seem to really enjoy customizing headers and footers because 
they’re versatile and can be used to contain page numbers, dates, and logos 
for formal stationery. Word 2008 has a completely new interface for working 
with headers and footers. You can work with headers and footers in Print 
Layout View or Web Layout View. To work with the new interface:

2. Click either the Header or Footer tab.
 
 This displays lots of fancy new header and footers that you can 
customize (see Figure 3-25).
 
3. From the Insert As pop-up menu, choose one of the following:
 
• Odd Pages: Inserts the element on odd pages only.
 
• Even Pages: Inserts the element on even pages only.
 
• All Pages: Inserts the element on every page.
 
4. Choose one of the header or footer elements.
 
 The selected header or footer element is inserted into your document.
The Formatting Palette’s Header and Footer options are available whenever 
you edit a header or footer. Eagle-eyed readers may notice that the Table 
section may also become available because the header and footer layout is 
done with tables in some elements. We discuss tables in Chapter 5 of this 
minibook. Here we focus on just the header and footer controls.
After you insert a header or a footer, you can click into the element to insert 
the following from the Formatting Palette (see Figure 3-26):

Getting around with bookmarks
You have a lot of ways to get from one place to another in a long document. 
One of the best ways is to create bookmarks, electronic markers that you 
can use to identify specific places, throughout your document. Follow these 
steps to create a bookmark:
 
1. Click at the point in the document where you want to create a 
bookmark and then choose Insert➪Bookmark.
 
 The Bookmark dialog opens.
 
2. In the Bookmark Name field, type a name that makes sense to you 
later (no spaces are allowed) and click the Add button.
 
 Your bookmark is added to the list of bookmarks for that document. You 
can view these at any time by summoning the Bookmark dialog.
Follow these steps to go to your bookmarks:
 
1. Press Ô-G.
 
 The Find and Replace dialog appears. (See Figure 3-29.)
 
2. Click the Go To tab if it isn’t selected already.
 
3. In the Go to What list, choose Bookmark.
 
4. To the right of the Enter Bookmark Name field, click the pop-up menu 
to choose a bookmark or type a name of a bookmark in the field if you 
already know it.
 
5. Click the Go To button or press Return.
 
 Word takes you to the place in your document where the bookmark 
resides. Click the red Close button to close the Find and Replace dialog.

Writing with Style
Writing with Style
Styles are like fine wines: You have an almost unlimited variety; different 
kinds are best for different occasions; they’re fun to use; and you don’t have 
to be a connoisseur to appreciate a good one. We think that homemade 
styles can be the best of all.
A style is the way in which content is formatted, and the format is made 
up of a collection of attributes. The Formatting Palette is where the most 
popular formatting attributes and characteristics of style are applied. In fact, 
the Formatting Palette could have just as accurately been called the Styling 
Palette.
Applying slick styles
It’s great that styles, one of the most powerful features in Word and Office, 
are so easy to work with. You’ll find that styling your document is as intuitive 
as 1–2–3. Follow these steps to apply a style:
 
1. Select some text to apply a style to.
 
2. In the Formatting Palette, click the Styles disclosure triangle to reveal 
all style options if they aren’t visible already.
 
3. In the Pick a Style list, choose a style that you want to apply to the 
selected text.
 
 The style is applied to your selection.
After you’ve applied some styles, click into the text of various portions of 
your document. Notice that the Formatting Palette tells you which particular 
style has been applied to that selection. The current style of selected text is 
kept constantly refreshed. You’ll see this displayed as the first thing in the 
Styles section of the Formatting Palette.
Applying document themes to styles
After you’ve applied some styles to your text, you can change the theme 
of your entire document by clicking a document theme within from the 
Document Theme section of the Formatting Palette. While you apply different 
document themes, watch the styles you applied in your document instantly 
adopt the new theme colors and fonts. Notice that the Formatting Palette 
Style’s section also updates to match the document theme you apply.
 
Can’t see the Document Theme section in the Formatting Palette? Some new 
features, such as document themes, work only with the new XML-based file 
formats, such as DOCX and DOTX. If you’re working with older DOC or DOT 
files, or even RTF files, the Document Theme option isn’t active and won’t 
show up in the Formatting Palette.

Making a homemade style
The real power of styles comes from creating your own. Word has a fast and 
easy way to save a new style.
Create a new style from formatted text
Say you spent some time formatting text just the way you want it and you 
want to save that format as a style so you can use it again in another 
document. Here’s what you do:
 
1. Select the formatted text.
 
2. In the Styles section of Formatting Palette, click the New Style . . . 
button.
 
 This button is oversized, green, and has a plus sign so you can’t miss it!
 
 The New Style dialog opens, as shown in Figure 3-30. The attributes of 
your selection display in this dialog.

216
Writing with Style
 
3. Below Properties, in the Name field, type a name for your style and 
then select the Add to Template check box.
 
 If you leave this deselected, your style is saved only with the current 
document. If you select the check box, the changes are saved to Word’s 
Normal (.dotx) template.
 
4. Click OK.
 
 Your style appears in Formatting Palette in the Styles section in Pick 
Style to Apply.
 
For the style connoisseur, Word enables you to see an overview of styles 
within an entire document. To do this, switch the view in the View menu to 
either Draft or Outline. If you drag the divider between the style information 
and your document’s body all the way to the left edge of the window, you 
can’t see the style information, and you’ll lose the divider. To get the divider 
back:
 
1. From the Word menu, choose Preferences.
 
2. Choose View.
 
3. Below the Window section, find the section for style area width. 
Enter a number or use the up/down control to enter a value greater 
than zero.
Working with the Style dialog
The Style dialog allows you to create new styles, modify existing styles, 
delete styles, and organize styles. To create new styles from scratch or from 
existing styles, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Format➪Style.
 
 The Style dialog opens. Here you see a list of the styles you already have.
 
2. Click the New button.
 
 The New Style dialog opens (see Figure 3-30).
When you open the New Style dialog, notice that you can create styles from 
one of four style types:
 
✦ Paragraph: Affecting entire paragraphs, these are the most commonly 
used styles.
 
✦ Character: Affects any character attribute, such as font, size, and italics.
 
✦ Table: Creates new styles for tables.
 
✦ List: Creates styles for bulleted or numbered lists.

Using Organizer
Notice as you change style types in the New Style dialog’s Style Type pop-up 
menu, the other options in the New Style dialog change as well. Click the 
Format pop-up menu in the lower-left corner of the New Style dialog, as 
shown in Figure 3-30, to find specialized formatting tools. Following is a list 
of formatting customizations that are saved with a style:
 
✦ Font Formatting: Displays the Font dialog.
 
✦ Paragraph Formatting: Displays the Paragraph dialog.
 
✦ Tabs: Displays the Tabs dialog.
 
✦ Border: Displays the Borders and Shadings dialog.
 
✦ Language: Displays the Language dialog.
 
✦ Frame: Displays the Frame dialog.
 
✦ Numbering: Displays the Bullets and Numbering dialog.
 
✦ Shortcut Key: Displays the Customize Keyboard dialog.
You can save your styles in Word’s Normal template (the default template 
used when Word opens), a custom template, or within your individual 
documents. If you save a style in Normal (.dotx), it’s available to all documents 
from then on.
Copying styles
If you have a custom style that was saved in the document you’re working 
on, you can copy the style to other documents (usually templates) or to the 
Normal (.dotx) template with the Organizer dialog, which we discuss in the 
following section.
Using Organizer
 
Organizer can copy styles, AutoText (which we cover in Chapter 6 in this 
minibook), and toolbars (which we cover in Chapter 1 of this minibook) from 
one Word template or document to another. Organizer can also be used to 
rename or delete styles, AutoText, or toolbars, but copying styles seems to 
be the most common use for Organizer.
Opening Organizer
Use the Styles dialog to fire up Organizer. Follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Format➪Style.
 
 The Style dialog opens.
 
2. Click the Organizer button.
 
 The Organizer dialog, as shown in Figure 3-31, opens.

Copying styles, AutoText, and toolbars
Organizer is quite simple. You can copy styles, AutoText, and toolbars from 
one open document or template and put them in another. In Figure 3-31, 
Document 2 has a custom style that we wish to copy to our Normal (.dotx) 
template so we can use it whenever we open a new, blank Word document. 
Here’s how to copy styles, AutoText, and toolbars:
 
1. On either the left or right side of Organizer, select an open document 
or template from the pop-up menu.
 
2. On the opposite side, select a different document or template from the 
pop-up menu.
 
3. On either side, select something (a style, AutoText, or a toolbar) to 
copy to the other document or template.
 
 The Copy button arrow will always point at the document that will be 
copied to.
 
4. Click the Copy button to copy your selection to the destination.
 
 The item list of the destination document or template will automatically 
update to show that the item was added.

219
AutoFormat as You Type
 
Word’s Normal (.dotx) template is the template that determines all formatting 
aspects when opening new, blank Word documents. Styles, AutoText, and 
toolbars saved in Normal (.dotx) are always available to you in Word. In 
Organizer, the Normal (.dotx) template is referred to as Normal (global 
template).
 
AutoText copy works only between two Word templates (.dotx). AutoText 
can’t be copied to or from regular Word documents. Of course, you can use 
Save As to turn an ordinary Word document into a template and then copy 
the AutoText.
Renaming or deleting items
In addition to copying, you can select an item from either side of Organizer 
and then click either:
 
✦ Delete: Deletes the selected style, AutoText, or toolbar from the 
document or template that is selected in that side’s pop-up menu.
 
✦ Rename: Causes a small window to open that lets you type a new name 
for the selected style, AutoText, or toolbar.
AutoFormat as You Type
By default, most of Word’s AutoFormat options are turned on. You can get at 
the list of AutoFormat options by taking these two steps:
 
1. From Word’s Tools menu, choose AutoCorrect.
 
 The AutoCorrect preferences dialog opens.
 
2. Click the AutoFormat as You Type tab.
 
 The AutoCorrect options appropriate for automatic formatting display.
It’s not a big topic, but it’s important because it 
is so popular. To copy formatting in Word:
 1. Select something — anything! Text, 
tables, anything that has formatting 
associated with it.
 2. Click the Format button on Word’s Standard 
toolbar.
 3. Click an object you want to apply the 
formatting to.
 
 This applies the formatting of the object 
from Step 1.
 
 
Be sure to copy formatting from similar 
objects. For example, you can copy the for-
matting of a table and apply that formatting 
to another table.

AutoFormat as You Type
The preferences shown in Figure 3-32 are just options with check boxes that 
you can turn on and off at will. Most people probably don’t need to adjust 
these, but if Word is automatically formatting something as you type and 
you don’t want it to, this is the place to look first to look to see whether you 
need to turn off a setting. Moving the mouse cursor over the items updates 
the description. Click OK to tell Word to use your new preference settings or 
click Cancel to leave without making changes.

Automatically Numbering Lines
Word can automatically number the lines in your documents. This can be 
handy when referring to specific places within a document without having to 
use bookmarks, which we discuss earlier in this chapter. To add or remove 
line numbers, your document must be in Print Layout View. You can turn 
line numbers on for an entire document or selected portions of a document. 
Here’s how:
 
1. Select a portion, section, or several sections of a document.
 
 If you want to number an entire document, skip this step.
 
2. From the Format menu, choose Document.
 
 The Document dialog opens.
 
3. Click the Layout tab.
 
4. Click the Line Numbers button.
 
 The Line Numbers options appear. See Figure 3-33.
 
5. Click the Add Line Numbering check box to activate the line-numbering 
options.
 
 Choose options as desired.

You can control the following settings as you like:
 
✦ Start At: Sets the number of the first line.
 
✦ From Text: Sets the distance of the line numbers from the text.
 
✦ Count By: Skips the display of line numbers by however many you 
choose. If you count by two, only the numbers next to every other line 
will appear.
 
✦ Numbering: As shown in Figure 3-33, Continuous means the numbering 
won’t restart at page or section breaks and will be continuous throughout 
the entire document or selection.

In This Chapter

✓ Casting spells and checks
✓ Working with dictionaries
✓ Choosing your language
✓ Taming the grammar checker
S
haring documents is an everyday activity in all kinds of companies 
and organizations, from businesses to universities and governments to 
churches. Sometimes you receive a document you’re expected to contribute 
to, and other times you create a document that others need to add to and 
comment on. At times, multiple users are working on the same document, or 
maybe just one additional person is helping to edit a document. Whatever 
the situation may be, Word has you covered.
Make sure the text in your documents is spelled properly and is grammatically 
correct. Word has some nifty automatic spelling, grammar, AutoCorrect, 
and AutoFormat (discussed in the previous chapter) features. Time to dig 
into all this and more.
Keeping Track of Changes
So you’re stuck on this committee at work and you have to prepare a report 
about something substantial. Everyone on the committee is supposed to 
contribute to this report, but nobody has time to meet. The solution could 
be a shared document. You decide to start with a Report template from 
Project Gallery, customize it for your committee, and then type your portion 
of the report.
Setting up tracking changes
This is where the Word Track Changes feature comes into play. Word keeps 
track of the changes made, who made them, and when the changes were 
made. But — and you knew there was a but — these changes aren’t tracked 

224
Keeping Track of Changes
automatically unless you do something to track them. Don’t worry. You 
don’t have to learn to ride a rocket or anything. All you have to do is turn on 
this feature; then you can send the document to your committee members, 
and their changes are tracked. After the members have made changes and 
added comments, they return the modified document to you. With this nifty 
feature, you can see who all made the changes in the document!
Before you turn on track changes and start sending your documents to 
everybody for their input, you need to tell them to check their Word 
preferences they open the tracked document to make sure that their names 
are known to Word. Check your own Word preferences to make sure your 
own information is accurate. Here’s how:
 
1. Choose Word➪Preferences.
 
 Word’s Preferences opens.
 
2. In the Personal Settings section, choose User Information.
 
 The User Information preferences will be displayed. See Figure 4-1.
 
3. At the top of the pane, verify that First, Last, and Initials show your 
actual name.
 
 Fill in this information and make corrections as needed. No other fields 
in User Information need to be adjusted in order to use track changes.
 
4. Click OK to save your changes and close Preferences.
 
Figure 4-1: 
Make sure 
the user 
name is 
correct.
 
Sometimes IT departments clone Office installations, and everyone winds up 
with the same name or no name at all. Word can’t detect different users if 
two or more people have the same name in the User Information preferences.
So how do you turn on the Track Changes feature for a document? There are 
several ways to activate track changes. Here’s the first:
 
1. From Word’s View menu, choose Toolbars➪Reviewing.
 
 Alternatively, click the TRK button visible at the bottom edge of the 
document window.
 
 Either action summons the Reviewing toolbar, as shown in Figure 4-2.

Here’s a second way to activate track changes:
 
1. Choose Tools➪Track Changes➪Highlight Changes.
 
 This brings up the Highlight Changes dialog. See Figure 4-3.
 
2. Make sure all three check boxes are selected.
 
3. Click OK.
 
 Word returns you to your document and starts tracking changes.

That’s all there is to it. When you’re ready to distribute your document, 
you can use the Reviewing toolbar to send your document as an e-mail 
attachment or via Microsoft Messenger. This is a good time to choose Flag 
for Follow Up on Word’s Tools menu to set a reminder to make sure the 
document actually does get worked on. For more about calendar, task, and 
reminder features of Office, visit Book V, Chapters 6 and 7.

226
Keeping Track of Changes
After you receive a document with other people’s changes in it, you 
can either accept or reject those changes — more on this in the section 
“Accepting and rejecting changes,” later in this chapter.
You can fine-tune the Track Changes preferences, although the default 
settings are fine for most purposes. To access Track Changes preferences: 
choose Show➪Preferences on the Reviewing toolbar. See Figure 4-4. In the 
Track Changes preference pane, you can change the color of each author’s 
changes, and you can set how changes are highlighted. In fact, you can make 
a lot of adjustments to the way track changes displays changes and comments 
in Word’s interface. We show you the preference pane here, but we think 
you should only bother with these settings if you find you’re using track 
changes every day and you have time to experiment with various setting 
combinations.

If you do want to experiment (refer to Figure 4-4), click the pop-up menus for 
nearly endless combinations of settings. When you move the mouse cursor 
over preference controls, you see a description for each option.
In addition to tracking changes, the Track Changes feature also keeps track 
of comments for all reviewers. Any reviewer can click the New Comment 
button on the Reviewing toolbar to add comments for reviewers.
Working with a changed document
Picture this: You’ve sent out your document to two committee members, 
and they’ve made changes and returned the document to you. Now you have 
three copies of the same document — the original one, plus two returned 
documents that contain changes. You want to consolidate all the changes 
into the original document. In a folder that you can find easily, save the 
returned documents with new filenames, perhaps named after the person 
who worked on the revisions, so you can tell the returned files apart from 
each other and the original.
Merging changed versions into the original
After you save your changed documents under new filenames, you’re ready 
to merge the changed documents into the original so that you can have a 
single document in which to work. Follow these steps:
 
1. Open the original document you created choose Tools➪Merge 
Documents.
 
 The Open dialog appears.
 
2. Navigate to one of the changed documents and click Open.
 
 The changed document merges with the original, and you can immediately 
see the changes.
Repeat the preceding steps for each changed document that needs to be 
merged with the original. Set the Revisions View on the Reviewing toolbar to 
Original Showing Markup (see Figure 4-2). This way you can see the changes 
made to the original document (see Figure 4-5).
When using Print Layout View or Web Layout View, you see balloons on 
the right that describe the changes made and comments, if any, that have 
been added. Balloons denoting changes have Accept and Reject buttons. 
Comment balloons simply display comments and don’t have these buttons.

Accepting and rejecting changes
When you’re ready, you can go through the changes that people made to the 
document and work toward creating a final document.
 
Keep in mind that although text changes and comments are tracked, not 
every change made to a document is tracked. For instance, changes made to 
SmartArt objects aren’t tracked.
As years have passed, Microsoft has attempted to make the ideal interface to 
accomplish accepting and rejecting changes. Each attempt, though, has plusses 
and minuses. One interface works better on a large screen; another works better 
when there are few comments; yet another when there are a lot of comments.
Our advice is to start with balloons because they’re so visible. If you find 
these balloons hard to read, too crowded, or clumsy to work with, try using 
one of the other methods, such as using the Reviewing toolbar or the Accept 
and Review Changes dialog that we discuss shortly. You can turn the balloons 
on or off by following one of these procedures:
 
✦ Turn balloons on or off in preferences by following these steps:
 
1. On the Reviewing toolbar, choose Show➪Preferences.
 
 Track Changes preferences opens, as shown in Figure 4-4.
 
2. Select the Balloons to Display Changes option.
 
✦ Switch to a view that doesn’t display toolbars, such as Draft View.
 
 Switch to Print Layout View or Web Layout View to see balloons again.
 
✦ From Word’s View menu, toggle Markup on or off.

229
Keeping Track of Changes
The Reviewing pane is an alternative to balloons for viewing changes. Toggle 
the Reviewing pane on and off by clicking the Reviewing Pane button on 
the Reviewing toolbar (see Figure 4-2). The Reviewing pane shows up as 
a docked window at the bottom of your Word interface so that it requires 
some more screen real estate than the balloons.
The Reviewing toolbar has every control needed to manage tracking 
changes. Hover the mouse cursor over each button to see the navigation 
controls to move from change to change within the document as well as 
buttons to accept or reject changes.
An alternative to both balloons and the Reviewing toolbar is the Accept 
or Reject Changes dialog, as shown in Figure 4-6. Choose Tools➪Track 
Changes➪Accept or Reject Changes to turn on this tool. Click its Close 
button to dismiss the dialog.

Finishing up
While you work on a document with track changes, Word internally keeps a 
history of these changes and allows you to see them via the Reviewing toolbar. 
Click Revisions View (see Figure 4-2) on the Reviewing toolbar to choose 
from the following views:
 
✦ Original: This view shows what the document looked like before any 
changes. Switching to this view shows the original document, but the 
tracked changes remain in the document, hidden from view. This view is 
what your document will look like if you choose to reject all changes.
 
✦ Original Showing Markup: This view shows the original text, formatting 
changes, and displays deleted text inline.

230
Keeping Track of Changes
 
✦ Final: This view shows how the document would look if you were to 
accept all changes. Deleted text isn’t displayed. Switching to this view 
hides original text that was changed or deleted by reviewers, but it’s still 
retained within the document.
 
✦ Final Showing Markup: Shows inserted text and formatting changes. 
Deleted text appears in balloons.
After you have your document with everybody’s changes, clean up the text 
by accepting or rejecting those changes. Start at the beginning of your 
document, and work your way to the end with balloons, the Reviewing 
toolbar, or the Accept or Reject Changes dialog. Decide whether to accept 
or reject each and every change in the document. When you accept or reject 
revision marks, the revision marks are removed. In the end, your final 
document has no revision marks at all.
After you finish going through the document accepting and rejecting 
changes, follow these steps to properly prepare a document for final delivery:
 
1. Start with your document closed. In Finder, right-click or Control-click 
the file’s icon; then choose Duplicate from the pop-up menu.
 
 A copy of your document containing revisions is made. You now have a 
copy of the document in case you want to refer to the revisions later.
 
2. Open the document containing tracked changes in Word.
 
3. On the Reviewing toolbar, set Revisions View to Final.
 
 This is how your document will look if you complete the next step. Look 
through the document and make sure everything looks right. If everything 
is okay, proceed to Step 4.
 
4. Accept all changes.
 
a. On the Reviewing toolbar, click the small triangle to the right of the 
Accept Changes button to display the submenu.
 
b. From the pop-up menu, choose Accept All Changes in Document 
(see Figure 4-7).
 
Figure 4-7:

Click the small triangle.

 When you accept all changes, your changed text replaces the original 
text, and deleted text is removed from the document.
 
 (Optional) You can reject all changes, which would restore the document 
to its original state before any changes were made. To reject all changes, 
use the Reject Changes triangle’s pop-up menu.
 
5. Delete all comments in your document.
 
a. On the Reviewing toolbar, click the small triangle to the right of the 
Reject Changes button to display the submenu.
 
b. Choose Delete All Comments in Document from the submenu 
(see Figure 4-8).

8. Select the Remove Personal Information from This File on Save check 
box.
 
9. Select the Warn before Printing, Saving, or Sending a File that 
Contains Tracked Changes check box.
 
 
10. Click the Save button on Word’s Standard toolbar.
 
 
 Your document is now safe for distribution. If you receive a warning that 
track changes are in the file, you didn’t accept or reject all the revisions. 
Cancel the save; then repeat the steps beginning with Step 4.
 
Occasionally people forget to remove comments and edits, which can cause 
much embarrassment and even legal liability. Always make sure you have all 
the edits resolved by searching for track changes one last time.

Casting a Spell Check
Casting a Spell Check
Eye strike a key and type a word
And weight four it two say
Weather eye am wrong oar write
It shows me strait a weigh.
 
 
— Sauce unknown
One of the miracles of Microsoft Word is spell check. By now most everyone 
who has ever used a word processor or typed an e-mail knows that a red, 
squiggly underline means you might have a spelling error; and a green, 
squiggly underline tells you that you might have a grammar problem. The 
concept is simple, yet extremely effective. When you finish typing a word, 
Word compares your spelling to a list of known words in a spelling dictionary. 
If what you typed isn’t in the list, Word puts a red squiggle under your word. 
When you finish typing a sentence, that sentence is compared to grammar 
rules. If you violate a rule, Word puts a green squiggle under your sentence.
Knowing how to spell is still important!
Yes, we text message. We know that language is evolving, and our technologies 
are shaping it. Phonetic spellings are fine for text messages, but that’s it. 
Sorry. It still pays off big-time to know words, their proper spellings and 
meanings, including nuances and context.
Consider this small example:
They are so deer.
Word shows no red or green squiggles, but you probably wanted to say
They are so dear.
As you can see, no computer substitute exists for knowing proper spelling 
and word usage.
Running a spelling and grammar check
Instead of going through the document one squiggle at a time, Word can check 
all spelling and grammar for you. If you haven’t already, get in the habit of 
running a spell check before you finish a document. You may have missed one.
Before you run your first spelling and grammar check, Word has a great 
feature that’s turned off by default, and you need to turn it on. The feature 
enables you to add new words to a custom dictionary. This dictionary allows 
Office to understand new words as you work on your documents. You have 
to set this up only once. Afterward, the Spelling feature remains available 
to you not just in Word, but in all Office applications. The Grammar feature 
works only in Word. Here’s how you set up Spelling and Grammar:

Book II
Chapter 4
Reviewing and 
Proofing with Word
233
Casting a Spell Check
 
1. Choose Word➪Preferences.
 
 Word Preferences displays. (See Chapter 1 of this minibook for more on 
Word Preferences.)
 
2. In the Authoring and Proofing Tools section, choose Spelling and 
Grammar.
 
 The Spelling and Grammar preferences pane opens.
 
3. In the Spelling section, click the Dictionaries button.
 
 The Custom Dictionaries window opens.
 
4. Select the Custom Dictionary check box.
 
5. Click OK to close the custom dictionary and then click OK to close the 
Spelling and Grammar preferences pane.
 
 This activates Word’s built-in custom dictionary. We’ll discuss how to 
create and add your own custom dictionaries in just a bit!
After you perform these steps, the Add button in the Spelling and Grammar 
dialog becomes available whenever you perform a spell check, and the Add 
option becomes available in the pop-up menu that appears when you right-
click or Control-click a word that’s been flagged with a red squiggle. Now 
you’re ready to run a spell check on the entire document. To activate spell 
checking, do either of the following:
 
✦ From the Tools menu, choose Spelling and Grammar.
 
✦ Use the keyboard shortcut Option-Ô-l (lowercase L).
Spell checker runs, and if it doesn’t find errors, it gives you a clean bill of 
health. Yea! But more often than not, spell check reminds you that you’re 
fallible. When that happens, the Spelling and Grammar dialog opens, 
highlights a word or portion of a sentence in the document, and offers 
several choices for correcting the perceived problem (see Figure 4-9). Most 
of the time the correct spelling is highlighted under Suggestions, and all you 
have to do is click the Change button to fix the spelling and continue to the 
next misspelled word.
But wait a minute! You’re pretty darn sure that allergenicity is spelled 
correctly, but the spell checker says it’s not. You look through the list of 
suggested spellings. You definitely don’t want to replace allergenicity with 
allergen city. If this was the only time you used allergenicity, you’d click the 
Ignore button and be on your way. If you used allergenicity a lot in this 
document but don’t think you’ll ever use the word again, you could click the 
Ignore All button so that allergenicity doesn’t get flagged again within this 
open document.

234
Casting a Spell Check
 
Figure 4-9: 
Fixing 
spelling and

 Suggested spelling
For this example, what you really want to do is add allergenicity to the 
dictionary so that Word knows from now on how to correctly spell it. To do 
that, all you have to do is click the Add button. If the Add button is grayed 
out, you haven’t turned on the custom dictionary option that we covered 
earlier in this section.
Adding a custom dictionary
Sometimes you might need to add a dictionary. Perhaps your discipline, 
science, or profession uses a lot of specialized terms not found in the Word 
default dictionary, or maybe you need to add a dictionary for a language not 
supplied with Office. You can even create a dictionary and add it to Word.
A dictionary is simply a list of words in which the words are saved as a file 
with a .dic extension. Dictionary files aren’t different for Mac or Windows. 
You can find custom dictionaries and foreign language dictionaries on the 
Internet by searching for them, and many are free. Word’s Help system has 
an excellent step-by-step explanation of how you can make your own custom 
dictionary under Create and Use a Custom Dictionary. To tell Word to use a 
new dictionary file that you’ve found:
 
1. Choose Word➪Preferences.
 
 Word Preferences displays.
 
2. In the Authoring and Proofing Tools section, choose Spelling and 
Grammar.
 
 Word’s Spelling and Grammar preferences pane opens.
 
3. In the Spelling section, click the Dictionaries button.
 
 The Custom Dictionaries dialog opens.

4. Click the Add Button.
 
 A special Add Dictionary dialog opens.
 
5. Navigate to the .dic dictionary file and select it.
 
 If the .dic file you want to use is grayed out, switch to Enable to All 
Files.
 
6. Click Open.
 
 Your custom dictionary appears with a check box that’s selected in the 
Custom Dictionaries dialog.
 
7. Click OK to close the Custom Dictionaries dialog and then click OK to 
close the Spelling and Grammar preferences pane.
 
 Your new dictionary is now available to all Office applications.
Editing a custom dictionary
Because dictionaries are simply text files, you can open them in Word, add 
and remove words, and save them again. If you ever accidentally add a 
misspelling to a dictionary or if you want to add or remove words:
 
 1. In Word, use File Open to open the (.dic) file.
 
 A list of words appears.
 
 
2. Click the Show button on Word’s Standard toolbar to toggle on the 
ability to see paragraph marks if they aren’t showing already.
 
3. Add or remove words from the list.
 
• Type a new word to add to the list. Press Return or Enter after each 
new entry to add a single paragraph mark after the new word.
 
• Delete misspelled or unwanted words (and their associated paragraph 
marks) from the list.
 
 Each word in the list must be followed by a single paragraph mark.
 
 4. Click the Save button on Word’s Standard toolbar to save your 
changes; then click the Close button to close the document.
 
If you use many medical or legal terms regularly, special Word- (and Office-) 
compatible dictionaries are available that include all the terms that Word 
might consider as spelling mistakes! Search for them online. Include a 
subject name, such as medical, the word download, and .dic as keywords in 
your search.
Setting a new default language for proofing
Word comes with many different language dictionaries. The default dictionary 
determines which language’s proofing tools Word uses for spelling and 
grammar. You can change Word’s default language dictionary easily:

236
Casting a Spell Check
 
1. Choose Tools➪Language.
 
 The Language dialog opens. You see a list of languages, as shown in 
Figure 4-10.
 
Figure 4-10:

Select Spelling and Grammar language.
Click to turn off Spelling and Grammar checking.
Click OK to apply language selection to selected text.
Click to set Word’s default Spelling and Grammar language.
 
2. Select the new language to use and click the Default button.
 
 A dialog appears asking whether you’re sure you want the change, and 
notifying you that your change will be saved in Word’s Normal (.dotx) 
template.
 
3. Click Yes to change Word’s default spelling and grammar checking 
language to the language you selected.
 
4. Click OK to close the Language dialog.
 
 The language dictionary you selected is now Word’s default language for 
spelling and grammar.
Using a different language for proofing a selection
Be sure to check Word’s Help Multilingual Features in Office 2008 topic to 
read more about using languages with Office. You can also use the Language 
feature (refer to Figure 4-10) to change the language of just the currently 
selected text: 
 
1. Select a word or passage in the text.
 
2. Choose Tools➪Language.
 
 The Language dialog opens.

Proofing with Word
237
Casting a Spell Check
 
3. Select a language to use.
 
4. Click OK to close the Language dialog.
 
5. Choose Tools➪Spelling and Grammar.
 
 The words that have a different spelling and grammar language applied 
to them will be checked against the proofing tools for the language 
selected using the Language dialog. See Figure 4-11. The rest of the 
document will be checked against Word’s default spelling and grammar 
language.
Just for fun, we selected a few words in an English sentence and set spelling 
and grammar to French for these words with the Language dialog. Then we 
ran a spell check with Spelling and Grammar from the Tools menu. The first 
word that the spell checker encountered that was set to French was edited. 
That set off the Spelling and Grammar dialog as expected, as shown in 
Figure 4-11. Note: French is shown in the title bar of the Spelling and Grammar 
dialog.

Making these modifications to the Language setting doesn’t change the 
language that’s used for the Office interface. If you want the entire Office 
interface to be in a particular language, you have to purchase and install an 
Office version that’s customized for the particular language you want to use.
Enabling Japanese for proofing
Japanese is a special case. Before you can use Japanese to check spelling 
and grammar, you must enable Japanese. To enable Japanese language 
features in the English version of Office, do the following:
 
1. In Finder, choose Applications➪Microsoft Office 2008➪Additional 
Tools➪Microsoft Language Register.
 
2. Double-click the Microsoft Language Register application.
 
 The Microsoft Register application opens (see Figure 4-12).

Cleaning up your grammar
Good thing Word doesn’t allow much bad grammar to sneak past you 
without flagging it. What’s nice is that Word enables you to choose just how 
aggressive you want the grammar checker to be. You can tune the settings 
coarsely by choosing any of these built-in writing style preferences:
 
✦ Casual: Word lets a lot of stuff slide.
 
✦ Standard: The grammar checker gets a bit pickier.
 
✦ Formal: Word will be extremely picky.
 
✦ Technical: Grammar checking isn’t as picky as Formal, but different 
things are looked for than with Standard.
 
✦ Custom: A set of choices that you make.
We show you how to see exactly what’s scrutinized in just a bit!
Choosing a writing style
You can quickly choose one of the writing styles discussed in the preceding 
section by heading to Word’s Spelling and Grammar preferences. Choose a 
writing style to be Word’s default by following these instructions:
 
1. Choose Word➪Preferences.
 
 Word Preferences displays.

3. In the Grammar section, click the Writing Style pop-up.
 
4. Select a writing style.
 
 We mention writing styles in the previous section.
 
5. Click OK to close the Spelling and Grammar preferences pane.
Creating a custom writing style
Choosing a writing style from the pop-up menu is okay, but you don’t get 
to see exactly what grammar rules are being checked in your document. 
If you want, you can fine-tune each of these writing styles to create your 
own totally customized writing style. All this is done in Word’s Spelling and 
Grammar preferences pane. To see and adjust grammar settings, take the 
following steps:
 
1. Choose Word➪Preferences.
 
 Word Preferences displays. 
 
2. In the Authoring and Proofing Tools section, choose Spelling and 
Grammar.
 
 Word’s Spelling and Grammar preferences pane opens.
 
3. To the right of the Writing Style pop-up menu, click the Settings 
button.
 
 The Grammar Settings dialog opens, as shown in Figure 4-13.
 
4. Choose a grammar style from the pop-up menu to view the default 
settings for that style.
 
 Feel free to modify the settings. Changing presets for a default writing 
style creates a custom writing style. Another way to create a custom 
style is to choose Custom from the pop-up menu at the top of the dialog 
and choose options as desired.
 
5. Click OK to close the Grammar Settings pane.
 
 You return to Word’s Spelling and Grammar preferences pane.
 
6. Select a writing style.
 
 If you customized a writing style and want to use it, choose Custom.
 
7. Click OK to close the Spelling and Grammar preferences pane.

Casting a Spell Check
Incidentally, if you follow these steps while you have text selected that has

T
ables and graphs have two virtues: They look great and they help 
portray your information in a more visual and aesthetic style. Of 
course, they also have the added virtue of making a good impression on 
your audience while conveying important information. So what if you have 
to tell them your company’s stock is worthless? At least you can do so 
with style and grace. Word 2008 makes it easier than ever before to make 
great-looking tables with the new Quick Tables and Charts features. Be sure 
to check our tips for working with tables for instructions on how to select 
cells and ranges of cells.
Deciding Which Table Tools to Use
Microsoft realizes that tables are one of Word’s most-used features. 
Consequently, Word lets you work with tables using a variety of different 
interface tools. In the next few sections, we show four entirely different 
ways to create a table:
 
✦ Using Quick Tables in the Elements bar
 
✦ Using the Tables button on the Standard toolbar
 
✦ Using your mouse with the Draw Table feature
 
✦ Using Word’s Insert Table dialog

242
Deciding Which Table Tools to Use
Each of these methods comes with an entire set of tools that you can use 
when working on your tables. This presents your authors with a particular 
problem. If we were to cover all the possibilities, we’d need more than 1,500 
bullet points just to cover the basics. Instead, we explain how most of the 
controls, buttons, formatting, and basic table functions appear within each 
interface tool grouping. You’re free to use any and all these as you work. 
Mix, match, and work with the tools from any of the groupings. If we point 
out something on the Tables and Borders toolbar, chances are good you’ll 
find the same tool on the Formatting Palette or in a dialog. No one single 
place has every table control.
Here’s the run down on the major interface tool groupings:
 
✦ Quick Tables: You’ll find these on the Elements bar. Use them to create 
nicely formatted basic and complex new tables.
 
✦ Tables button: Creates plain tables quickly.
 
✦ Tables and Borders toolbar: Lets you draw tables and has a full set of 
table formatting controls. There’s lots of dragging and dropping here.
 
✦ Dialogs: Word’s Table menu gives you access to table creation and 
formatting dialogs.
 
✦ Toolbox Formatting Palette: When you click in a table, special sections 
for table formatting become available.
 
✦ Menus: Word’s Table menu has many options and is great for people 
who prefer using menus. Additional menus are available by right-clicking 
or Control-clicking in a table.
 
✦ Keyboard shortcuts: If you work with tables a lot, you might wish to set 
your frequently used table commands as keyboard shortcuts, which we 
describe in Chapter 1 of this minibook.
 
✦ Custom toolbar: You can create your own custom toolbars, which we 
describe in Book I, Chapter 3.
Here’s an example of various options you can choose from to accomplish 
the same task: To adjust the sizes of rows, columns, or cells in a table, you 
can do any of the following:
 
✦ Drag the column and row dividers.
 
✦ Right-click and choose Table Properties to open the Table Properties 
dialog.
 
✦ Use the Tables section of the Formatting Palette and use the Height and 
Width controls.
 
✦ Drag the border indicators in the rulers.

Inserting Quick Tables in a Flash
 
Word allows you to make inserting a new table quick and easy. Here’s how:
 
1. Switch to Page Layout View or choose Insert➪Quick Tables.
 
 The Elements bar becomes available. See Figure 5-1.
 
2. Click Quick Tables on the Elements bar.
 
 The Quick Tables Elements Gallery appears. Quick Tables Elements 
Gallery has 12 basic styles and 11 complex styles from which to choose. 
Move the mouse cursor over Elements Gallery while looking at the left 
end of Elements Gallery to see the name and description for each table 
element.
 
3. Position the insertion cursor where you want the new Quick Table to 
appear in your document.
 
4. Click one of the Quick Tables in Elements Gallery.
 
 You have an instant, beautiful table.

Creating Your Own Tables
Even the basic tables on Elements Gallery may have too much formatting for 
your purposes. You might prefer to work in Draft or Outline View and don’t 
like switching to some other view just to insert a table. Word’s Tables feature 
can help you.

Creating Your Own Tables
Using the Tables button
 
 Here’s how to create a plain table with the Tables button on the Standard 
toolbar:
 
1. Click in your document to set the insertion cursor at the place where 
you want the new table to appear.
 
2. Click and hold down your mouse button (the left one if you have 
more than one mouse button) on the Tables button while you drag the 
mouse down and to the right.
 
 A grid appears while you drag, showing the number of rows and 
columns you’ll get when you release the mouse (see Figure 5-2).
 
3. Release the mouse to choose the number of rows and columns for 
your new table.
 
 A new table appears in your document.

command.
 
Click here and drag.
Table dimensions
Using the mouse
If you’re a “mouse” person and prefer to use the mouse whenever possible, 
you’ll love this method of creating and editing tables because it’s mostly 
click-and-drag. Here’s how to make a new table by drawing with your mouse:
 
1. In Word, choose Table➪Draw Table.
 
 The Tables and Borders toolbar appears (see Figure 5-3). Word might 
switch to Print Layout View. Word clicks the Draw Table button on the 
Tables and Borders toolbar for you, which makes the mouse cursor 
change into a pencil when it’s over your document so that you can start 
drawing.
 
2. Drag the mouse diagonally to create a dotted box shape.
 
 The shape is the outside border of your new table.

3. Release the mouse to create the table.
 
 The dotted lines assume the line style, color, and weight settings 
that you chose on the Tables and Borders toolbar. See the section, 
“Formatting Tables,” later in this chapter.
 
4. Continue drawing row and column dividers.
 
 Drag dividers to reposition them as desired. Click the Eraser button 
on the Tables and Borders toolbar to change the mouse cursor into an 
eraser. When the cursor is an eraser, it erases lines instead of drawing 
them.
 
5. Click the Draw Table button on the Tables and Borders toolbar to 
restore the normal mouse cursor.
 
 Whenever you want to use the mouse to draw more rows, columns, or 
even another table, just click the Draw Table button. It’s a toggle switch 
between Word’s regular cursor and the table drawing cursor.

Creating Your Own Tables
We explain those other buttons and terms in just a bit. We still have one 
more method of creating a table to discuss first.
Using the Insert Table dialog
This method is straightforward and works in all views in Word:
 
1. Click in your document to set the insertion cursor at the place where 
you want the new table to appear.
 
2. Choose Table➪Insert➪Table.
 
 Word’s Insert Table dialog displays. See Figure 5-4.
 
3. Adjust settings as desired.
 
4. Click OK to close the Insert Table dialog.
 
 Your table appears in your document at the insertion cursor.

AutoFit behavior
With the Insert Table dialog, you can choose the following options:
 
✦ Table Size: Choose the number of rows and columns for the new table.
 
✦ Autofit Behavior:
 
• Initial Column Width: This defaults to Auto. When Auto is chosen, 
the table takes up as much room as is available in the document. 
Alternatively, click the increase/decrease control to adjust the column 
width to a fixed amount. All columns will be equal width. You can resize 
the widths after the table is made if you decide they’re not just right.

• Autofit to Contents: When you click inside the table and start typing, 
the cells will automatically size themselves to fit the contents.
 
• Autofit to Window: The same as Initial Column Width set to Auto.
 
✦ AutoFormat button: Opens the Table AutoFormat dialog (see the 
section, “Styling with Table AutoFormat,” later in this chapter).
 
✦ OK: Makes a table with the options you chose.
Formatting Tables
Every aspect of a table’s appearance can be formatted. You can merge cells 
together to form bigger cells, unmerge them again, change line colors, create 
cell shading, and more. Join us as we explore the various ways to improve 
the way your tables look.
Using the Tables and Borders toolbar
The Tables and Borders toolbar is a good place to begin our table formatting 
discussion because many of its tools are also on the Formatting Palette, the 
Cell Format dialog, and the Borders and Shading dialog, all of which we discuss 
in this chapter. Refer to Figure 5-3 earlier in this chapter as we explain the 
formatting tools and how they work on the Tables and Borders toolbar:
 
✦ Line Style: This is a pop-up menu from which you can choose from a 
variety of dotted, dashed, single, double, and triple lines for the border 
and dividing lines in your table.
 
✦ Line Weight: This is a pop-up menu from which you can choose from 
nine different line weights.
 
✦ Border Color: This control has two options:
 
• Click the icon to display Word’s Borders and Shading dialog. See the 
section, “Using the Tables dialog,” later in this chapter for more on 
borders and shading.
 
• Click the small triangle to the right of the border color icon to display 
Office’s color picker from which to choose a color.
 
✦ Outside Border: This control turns border lines on or off, and it works 
in a specific order.
 
1. Select a cell, a range of cells, or an entire table.
 
2. Click the small triangle to the right of the icon to display the Borders 
palette (see Figure 5-5).
 
 Click a border style to apply it to the selected range. The selected 
range updates instantly. To tear this palette from the toolbar and 
make it its own floating palette, click the double-dotted part of the 
palette. The Horizontal Line button adds a horizontal line in the 
center of the range of cells.

3. Click the Outside Border button to apply the most recently applied 
outside border from the small triangle.
 
 This makes it easy to repeat the same outside border without clicking 
the small triangle.

✦ Shading color: This control works in a specific order:
 
1. Select a cell, a range of cells, or an entire table.
 
2. Click the small triangle to the right of the icon to display the 
Office Shading Color palette, from which you can choose a color 
(see Figure 5-6).
 
 The color you choose is immediately applied to the selected range. 
The most recently chosen color is displayed by the Shading Color 
icon so that you can quickly reapply that color to other selections. 
Just click the icon instead of the small triangle to apply the most 
recently used color.

✦ Split Cells: Select one or more cells that have been merged. Click this 
button to unmerge the cells.
 
✦ Align Top Left: Remember this tool when formatting labels and business 
cards! To use this tool:
 
1. Select a cell or a range of cells.
 
 You must have extra height and width within the cells so that con-
tents have room to move around. Otherwise, Align Top Left doesn’t 
have much of a visual effect.
 
2. Click the small triangle to the right of the button icon to reveal the Cell 
Alignment palette. (See Figure 5-8.)
 
3. Click an alignment option.
 
 The selected option is applied instantly to the selected range. Click 
the large icon to quickly reapply the most recently applied option.

✦ Distribute Columns Evenly: Select two or more columns, and then click 
this button to make the column width uniform for the selected range 
using the width of the rightmost column selected.
 
✦ Table AutoFormat: Displays the Table AutoFormat dialog. (See the 
section, “Styling with Table AutoFormat,” later in this chapter.)
 
✦ Change Text Direction: Each click of this button changes the direction 
text is displayed within selected cells or range of cells. After using this 
tool, use the Align Top Left tool to reposition the text.
 
✦ Sort Ascending: Select one or more columns to order the contents 
within each column either alphabetically or numerically; it’s like working 
in a spreadsheet.
 
✦ Sort Descending: Select one or more columns to order the contents 
within each column in reverse alphabetical or numerical order, as if 
you’re working in a spreadsheet.
 
✦ AutoSum: If you have a column containing numbers that you want to 
add up and put the total in a cell at the bottom:
 
1. Click into the empty cell at the bottom of your column containing numbers.
 
2. Click the AutoSum button.
 
 Word calculates the total for you automatically and inserts a Word 
field to perform the calculation. (We discuss Word fields and how to 
perform additional calculations in Chapter 7 of this minibook.)
Using the Formatting Palette
 
 If the Formatting Palette isn’t visible, click the Toolbox button on Word’s 
Standard toolbar and then click the Formatting Palette button at the top-left 
corner of the Toolbox.

Formatting Tables
Notice that when you put the insertion cursor in a table by clicking in any table 
cell, the Formatting Palette dynamically makes the Table section available, 
which has table-specific controls, as shown in Figure 5-9. Move the mouse 
cursor over each button on the Formatting Palette to figure out what it does. 
Most of these are identical to the buttons on the Tables and Borders toolbar. 
See the preceding section for descriptions.
In Figure 5-9, we highlight certain results after applying some formatting 
controls with the Formatting Palette and the mouse:
 
✦ Align: We selected the cells under the Amount Paid heading; then 
clicked the Align button. We chose Align Top Center from the pop-up 
palette to center the numbers in this column.
 
✦ Drag column dividers: We dragged the column dividers to make the 
column widths look right.
 
✦ Merge: We selected the two bottom leftmost cells and then clicked the 
Merge button to make a single larger cell for Total.
 
✦ AutoSum: We clicked inside the bottom right cell and then clicked the 
AutoSum button so that the total of the cells above would be calculated.

✦ Height: Type a value or use the increase/decrease control to adjust the 
height of selected cells, rows, or ranges.
 
✦ Width: Type a value or use the increase/decrease control to adjust the 
width of selected cells, columns, or ranges.
Applying a document theme
Because table formatting, such as shading, is actually a style and because 
styles can be formatted with document themes, you can apply document 
themes to format tables. All you have to do to apply a document theme to a 
table is
  
1. Click anywhere within the table you want to format.
 
 You don’t see changes unless your table has some formatting, such as 
shading, applied already. Tables made with Quick Tables respond nicely 
to document themes because they have a lot of styling.
 
2. Click the Document Theme triangle to expose the Document Theme 
previews in the Formatting Palette.
 
3. Choose a document theme.
 
 Your table instantly adopts the selected theme.
 
If you’re working with an older DOC file from before the Word 2008 era 
(you’ll be in Compatibility Mode), you have to save the file as a DOCX file 
before you can use the Document Theme option.
Using the Tables Properties dialog
If you prefer working with dialogs or if you’re interested in precision formatting 
of tables, columns, rows and cells, nothing beats the options found in the 
Table Properties dialog (see Figure 5-10). You can get to this dialog using 
one of these methods:
 
✦ Right-click or Control-click a table cell and then choose Table Properties 
from the pop-up menu.
 
✦ Choose Table➪Table Properties.
In this dialog, you can control the following:
 
✦ Size: Click the check box and click the increase/decrease control to 
adjust the overall width of the table as measured on the ruler. Choose 
from inches or percentage measure with the Measure In pop-up menu.
 
✦ Alignment: Choose Left, Center, or Right alignment for a table that 
doesn’t fill the entire width between margins. For precision, use the 
increase/decrease control to adjust exactly how far in from the left 
margin you wish the table to be placed with Indent from Left.

• Distance from Surrounding Text: Type numeric values or use the 
increase/decrease controls.
 
• Move with Text: When you select this check box, the table stays in 
the same relative position to text as you add and remove text while 
working in the document.
 
• Allow Overlap: Select this check box if you want the table to overlap 
other objects in your document.
 
✦ Borders and Shading button: Activates the Borders and Shading

• Borders tab: This tab offers the same border-formatting options you 
find on the Tables and Borders toolbar and in the Borders section of 
the Formatting Palette. You can apply borders to tables, cells, and 
paragraphs.
 
• Page Border tab: This tab offers the same border-formatting options 
you find on the Tables and Borders toolbar and in the Borders section 
of the Formatting Palette. With the Page Border tab, you can apply 
borders to the whole document, this section, this section (the first 
page of the section only). and this section (all except the section’s 
first page).
 
• Shading tab (see Figure 5-12): This lets you choose fill and pattern 
options that you can apply to the selected table, selected cell, and 
current paragraph.
 
 If the Tables and Borders toolbar isn’t turned on when you display 
the Borders and Tables dialog, the Show Toolbar button is active so 
that you can turn on the Tables and Borders toolbar.
 
 Back to the Table Properties dialog, as shown in Figure 5-10, to go over 
the remaining tabs of this dialog:
 
✦ Row tab: Allows you to adjust row settings, one row at a time.
 
• Size: Has the same size controls found on the Current Cells section of 
the Table portion of the Formatting Palette.
 
• Allow Row to Break Across Pages: Choose this check box, and Word 
allows a row to break at a page break. The default is that rows don’t 
break at a page break.
 
• Repeat as Header Row at the Top of Each Page: Choose this check 
box, and Word repeats the currently selected row as the column 
header when a table is large enough so that a page break passes 
through the table. Usually you use the first row of a table for this 
purpose.
 
• Previous Row and Next Row buttons: These buttons allow you to 
navigate through the current table so you can set row options row 
by row.
 
✦ Column tab: Column allows you to set column widths, one column at 
a time. Use the Previous Column and Next Column buttons to navigate 
through the current table.
 
✦ Cell tab: This tab lets you set these properties for the selected cell or 
range of cells:
 
• Width: Set width precisely by typing a number or using an increase/
decrease control. Width is measured in inches or percentage.
 
• Vertical Alignment: Choose Top, Center, or Bottom.
 
• Options button: Displays the Cell Options dialog (see Figure 5-13).

Margins in inches
Word defaults to using the same cell options for all the cells in a table, but 
you can deselect the Same as the Whole Table check box and format a select 
cell or a range of cells. By default, Word wraps text in cells, but you can 
deselect the Wrap Text check box to turn off wrapping.
Using styles
You have several different ways from which you can apply styles to tables. 
At the beginning of this chapter, we show Elements Gallery’s Quick Tables 
feature. The Gallery gives you a total of 23 different styles from which to 
choose. You can up the ante a bit if you’re willing to take a little extra time to 
work with styles.
Styling with Table AutoFormat
Table AutoFormat offers 44 (we counted them) different formats — actually 
they’re styles. To activate the Table AutoFormat dialog:
 
1. Click anywhere in a table.
 
2. In the Table section of the Formatting Palette, click the Table 
AutoFormat button.
 
 The Table AutoFormat dialog, as shown in Figure 5-14, appears.
The Table AutoFormat dialog is divided into the following sections:
 
✦ Formats: It would have been more accurate to label this section Styles. 
Scroll through the list of Formats and click any that sound enticing.
 
✦ Preview: As you work with AutoFormat, the preview updates instantly.
 
✦ Formats to Apply: Usually you want all the check boxes selected, but 
deselect boxes to see if you like the formatting better that way. Use the 
preview as your guide.

✦ Apply Special Formats To: Deselect and select check boxes to see 
whether you like the formatting better. Use the preview as your guide.
Click OK to apply your format (style) selections and close the AutoFormat

One of the nice things about AutoFormat is that it gives a visual definition of 
what it means to be a style. A style has a name (as shown in the Formats sec-
tion in Figure 5-14) and a bundle of formatting attributes that you can see in 
the preview. You can find all 44 of AutoFormat’s formats in the Style dialog, 
which we discuss in following section.

Styling with the Style dialog
Hang on to your hat because we’re going to up the ante once again! This time 
we choose from more than 140 different table styles using the Style dialog, 
which has the 44 AutoFormats from Table AutoFormat plus many more. We 
also show you how to modify these built-in styles and how to add your own 
styles.
Applying styles
To get at all the styles Word has to offer, click anywhere within the table you 
want to format and then follow these steps:

definitely need to type in a new name for your modified style. Time to take a 
look at this dialog:

your modifications. Don’t change this unless you want to pick a different 
style to modify.
 
✦ Apply Formatting To: Click this pop-up to choose which table elements 
you want this table style formatting to affect. For example, you could 
make a style for striped row formatting that when applied doesn’t affect 
the other table elements listed in the pop-up, such as headers.
 
✦ Formatting: A set of formatting tools for text, line, border, fill, and 
alignment is provided for your convenience.
 
✦ Preview: A live preview updates as you make formatting choices.
 
✦ Description: A description of the style updates as you make formatting 
choices.
 
✦ Add to Template: When selected, your modifications are saved as a new 
style in the Normal (.dotx) template. Your customized style is always 
available to you as a style in the Style dialog and in the Formatting 
Palette. If you don’t select this check box, your customization remains 
only with the current document.
 
✦ Cancel: This closes the Modify Style dialog without making any style 
modifications. If you clicked Add to Template, your style will still be in 
the Normal (.dotx) template.
 
✦ OK: Accepts your style modifications and closes the Modify Style 
dialog, which returns you to the Styles dialog where you can apply your 
modifications to the currently active table, or click Close to close Style.
 
 You have to click the Modify button before you click the Apply button; 
or you can select the table. Choose Format➪Style to get to the same

Working with Tables
After you have your tables created and formatted to your liking, it’s time to 
do some actual work. Filling in a table is a snap:
 
✦ Just click inside any cell and start typing.
 
✦ To move to the next cell, press the Tab key.
 
✦ If you press the Tab key while in the bottom rightmost cell, a new row is 
added to the bottom of the table.
Basic table tips
Here are some general tips and hints for adjusting and fine-tuning your 
tables:
 
✦ Adjusting row heights and column widths: Double-click row and column 
borders to automatically size rows and columns to fit their contents. You 
can easily adjust column width and row height by dragging borders, or 
dragging the table indicator marks in rulers.
 
✦ Selecting a range of cells: You can apply formatting to cell ranges — 
highlight more than one cell at a time and then drag inside the table with 
your mouse. See Figure 5-17.

Handling tables from the Web
Word can open Web pages that you saved from your Web browser:

264
Working with Tables
 
1. In Word, choose File➪Open.
 
 The Open dialog appears.
 
2. Navigate to the saved Web page file or use Spotlight to find the page.
 
 Word can open Web pages in these formats: .htm, .html, .mht, and 
.txt.
 
3. Click Open.
 
 Word opens the saved Web page.
If a Web page contains an HTML (HyperText Markup Language) table, you 
can use Word’s Table features. You might find it easier to copy just the table 
portion of the Web page from the Web document into a working document.
At some point, you might come across a PDF (Portable Document Format) file 
that has valuable table information in it that you want to extract. If the table 
information within the PDF is text-based and not a scanned image, you can 
use the Mac OS X Preview application to take a stab at getting at the table 
information. Follow these steps:
 
1. Open the PDF file in Mac OS X Preview application.
 
2. In Preview, choose Edit➪Select All.
 
3. In Preview, choose Edit➪Copy.
 
4. Switch to Microsoft Word by clicking Word’s Dock icon or use 
whichever way you usually use to switch or launch applications.
 
5. Make sure you have a new or existing document open.
 
6. In Word, choose Edit➪Paste.
 
 Delete extraneous information, leaving the table data untouched. If text 
wasn’t pasted, the PDF probably doesn’t contain any text, or is locked 
and you can’t use this method to grab the data. If that’s the case, you 
have to stop here. If not, continue on.
 
7. In Word, select the pasted text that needs to be converted to a table.
 
8. Convert text selection to a table by choosing Table➪Convert➪Convert 
Text to Table.
 
 Word makes a table out of the data.
PDFs can contain tables that have been saved as images, as can Web pages 
and other documents you might find online. If that’s the case, you need 
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software to convert the pictures of text 
into actual text. OCR software isn’t included with Office. Cheap scanners 
have been known to ship with high-quality OCR software that’s worth even 
more than the scanner. You might find OCR software worth looking into.

Working with Charts
Hold your horses! Charts are newly revamped in Office 2008. Whether 
you’re working in Word, Excel, or PowerPoint, Excel now handles all the 
charts. Because charts work the same way in all applications, we include a 
comprehensive section about charts in Book I, Chapter 5. In this chapter, we 
cover the intricacies that apply to charts specifically within Word. If necessary, 
read the information about charts in Book I, Chapter 5 before proceeding 
because we assume you already know how to create a chart in Word.
 
In Office, charts and graphs are the same thing. Even the dictionary agrees 
you can use chart and graph interchangeably. We point out this because in 
Office, these two words are both used to describe the same objects at times. 
We try to stick with chart unless something that we’re discussing in the 
Office interface uses graph.
Whoa! It’s way too big!
 
 The first thing you’re likely to notice when you start making a new chart in 
Word is that the chart might span the entire width of the page. Although that 
might be okay occasionally, at other times, you’ll want to resize the chart. 
To resize the chart, grab any corner handle and drag it diagonally with your 
mouse cursor. Be careful not to make it so small that the chart distorts or 
loses information.
Getting unstuck
After you resize the chart, you might wonder how you can move the chart 
around on the page. When your chart comes in from Excel, it’s locked to the 
left margin. If you try dragging the chart’s border, it doesn’t budge. Follow 
these steps to cure this problem:
 
1. Select the border or any part of the chart and then head to the 
Formatting Palette Wrapping section.
 
2. Click the Style option and change the style from In Line with Text to 
one of the other options, as shown in Figure 5-23.
 
 Now you can drag the chart and position it wherever you want on the 
page. Of course, this wrapping trick can work for other things, such as 
pictures, besides charts!
 
Sometimes, the Formatting Palette seems like it has too many sections, 
which can make finding the Wrapping section a challenge! Don’t worry. Click 
the disclosure triangles to close each of the expanded sections until you see 
the Wrapping section in the Formatting Palette.

This is a frame-up!
 
 If you read Book I, Chapter 3, you might already have the Frame button on 
the Standard toolbar. Even if you didn’t, don’t worry. A frame is a container 
that surrounds objects, such as pictures and charts. You use a frame when 
your text or graphics contain comments, comment marks, or note reference 
marks so that you can position them within a document precisely and control 
text flow around the frame. Follow these steps to add the Insert Frame 
command to a toolbar:
 
1. In Word, choose View➪Customize Menus and Toolbars.
 
 The Customize Menus and Toolbars dialog opens.
 
2. Select the Commands tab and in the Category list on the left, select 
Insert.
 
3. In the Commands list on the right, scroll down until you find the 
Horizontal command. Drag this button to the Standard toolbar and 
release the mouse button when you see the insertion cursor.
 
 The Insert Frame button appears on the Standard toolbar. Don’t worry 
that it’s Horizontal in the Commands list and Insert Frame on the 
toolbar — it works just fine.
 
4. Click OK to close the Customize Menus and Toolbars dialog.
 
 The Insert Frame command is now ready for you to use.
Frames are handy containers because you can put all sorts of stuff inside 
them. For example, you can put a chart into a frame, which you might want 
to try for several reasons:
 
✦ Frames can be positioned anywhere on a page by dragging.
 
✦ You can wrap text around a frame, although you only get two of the 
numerous wrapping options for frames: None and Around.

Book II
Chapter 5
Making Great 
Tables and Charts 
267
Working with Charts
 
✦ You can anchor a frame to a specific position on a page so that it doesn’t 
move with the text. This feature is useful for page layout, especially if you 
want something to stay put in Publishing Layout View.
In this example, we insert an empty frame and position it in the middle of 
some text. Working with a frame while it’s empty is easier. After you put 
something into a frame, it can be nearly impossible to select just the frame. 
Follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Insert Frame button (which you create in the preceding 
steps).
 
 Your cursor turns into a crosshair.
 
2. Hold down the mouse button and drag to make the frame.
 
3. Release the mouse button when you’re done.
 
 An empty box with a shaded border appears; this is the frame.
Before you put something inside the frame, take a moment to size and 
position the frame and to set its properties. Right-click or Control-click the 
frame and choose Format Frame. The Frame dialog appears, as shown in 
Figure 5-24. You can control the exact size and position of the frame with 
each section of the Frame dialog:
 
✦ Text Wrapping: Choose None or Around.
 
✦ Horizontal:
 
• Specify an exact position from the left edge of the margin, page, or 
column.
 
• Specify that the distance from the frame text will be in the horizontal 
direction.
 
✦ Vertical:
 
• Specify an exact position from the top edge of the margin, page, or 
column.
 
• Specify that the distance from the frame text will be in the vertical 
direction.
 
• Move with Text: Selecting this check box makes the frame’s position 
relative to the paragraph.
 
• Lock Anchor: Selecting this check box causes text to flow around 
the frame instead of the frame moving as text is added or removed 
before the frame.

268
Working with Charts
 
✦ Size:
 
• Width: Specify an exact width or let Word automatically size the 
frame.
 
• Height: Set a minimum height, an exact height, or let Word decide the 
frame’s height with the Auto option.
Frames can be used as placeholders. For example, you can insert a frame 
into a document where you plan to put a picture later. When you’re ready, 
you can drag a picture from the Toolbox’s object palette into the frame, and 
the picture size adjusts to fit the frame.
 
Figure 5-24: 
Formatting a 
frame.
 
Earlier in the chapter, we mention that by default, charts tend to fit the 
entire width of the document when you make them. You can avoid this 
problem by dragging out a frame first and then clicking in the frame before 
you make the chart. When your chart is made, it’s inside the frame, and you 
can drag the frame and the chart freely within your document. As an example, 
follow these steps:
 
1. In a Word document, click the Insert Frame button on the toolbar you 
put it on (see earlier in this section).
 
2. Drag a frame to a size that’s large enough for a chart.
 
 You don’t have to be exact. You can resize the frame later if it’s too 
small or too big. 
 
 Optional: If you want to set the frame’s properties, right-click or 
Control-click the frame’s border and choose Format Frame from the 
pop-up menu. The Frame dialog appears, as shown in Figure 5-24. For 
the purpose of this exercise, you can skip the formatting and just use 
the default settings.

3. Make sure the insertion cursor is blinking on and off inside the frame 
and click anywhere within the frame’s border.
 
 You can now position the insertion cursor within the frame if you don’t 
see the blinking cursor.
 
4. In Word, choose Insert➪Chart.
 
 The Charts tab of Elements Gallery displays.
 
5. Click one of the chart types.
 
 Excel opens with sample data. The sample data is fine for this exercise, 
but for your own chart, use real data.
 
6. In Excel, choose File➪Close.
 
 When Office returns to Word, your chart is inside the frame. You can 
drag the corners of both the frame and the chart to resize them as 
desired. It’s a good idea to keep the frame slightly larger than the chart.
 
Select a range of text or a picture and then click the Insert Frame button. 
The selection will then be contained within a frame that is easily positioned 
anywhere in your document.
Changing a chart into a picture
When you make a chart in Word, the chart object is a complete Excel 2008 
workbook embedded inside the Word document. You can then turn the 
chart object into other kinds of objects. For example, you can turn the chart 
into a picture, making it impossible for others to edit the chart or the chart’s 
data. However, this also makes it easier to scale the size of the chart.
To access the various options available to you, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the chart.
 
 Click anywhere in the chart.
 
2. In Word, choose Edit➪Cut or Copy.
 
• Cut removes the chart from the document.
 
• Copy retains the chart in its present location, as is, and copies the 
chart to the Clipboard.
 
3. Click where you want the picture of the chart to appear.
 
 You can use the current document or any other open document.
 
4. Choose Edit➪Paste.
 
 Your chart appears at the insertion cursor. Notice a small widget 
displays at the lower-right corner of the chart.

270
Working with Charts
 
5. Immediately click the widget (or Smart Tag) in the lower-right corner 
of the pasted chart.
 
 You find various options in the pop-up menu, as shown in Figure 5-25.
 
6. From the pop-up menu, choose the first option: Paste as Picture.
 
 You now have a picture of your chart, not an embedded Excel chart 
object, at the insertion point.

ital ingredients in the Word casserole can make your word processing 
faster and easier. You’ll have more time to keep fit, cook, eat, and 
generally live life better!
An intelligence of a sort exists in Word, and yes, we’re dead serious. Word 
can figure out how to finish typing words and phrases for you. You can 
give Word standard document tasks, such as captioning pictures and other 
objects in a long document, creating a table of contents, and generating 
an index. Word also has secret layers that you can use to format the 
background. Just don’t expect Word to pay your bills. Not yet, anyway.
Automating with AutoText
 
Word’s AutoText feature is so simple, yet so powerful; you might wonder 
how you got along without it. You teach Word to remember text that you 
use often and don’t feel like typing over and over. Word can then type that 
text for you. If we had to choose one feature in all of Word that we think 
everyone should know, AutoText is the one! We start with a simple example.
Teaching Word a lesson
 
 Before we get started, we want to remind you that you can click the Show 
button on Word’s Standard toolbar to show or hide paragraph marks and 
other non-printing characters while you work. Many people find it useful to 
see these marks while they work.
As we drive through this section, we use five Autos:
 
✦ AutoText: When certain text is typed, this feature instantly inserts an 
AutoText entry.

272
Automating with AutoText
 
✦ AutoText name: The name that you give to an AutoText entry. This is 
the specific text you type to create an AutoText entry.
 
✦ AutoText entry: The text or other object that’s been saved or was built 
into Word so that when its name is typed, the saved entry is inserted 
instantly.
 
✦ AutoComplete: The processes whereby a saved AutoText entry is added 
to a document when its name is typed.
 
✦ AutoCorrect: The technology that the AutoText feature uses. You could 
consider AutoCorrect to be the parent of the AutoText feature.
Maybe you have to type your organization’s name often. Maybe you have 
to type a word or an expression that’s cumbersome, such as Nuclear Factor-
Kappa B and Placental Apoptosis. To teach Word a word or expression, all 
you have to do is
 
1. Type the word or expression that you use often and select it.
 
 You can also select a word or expression you already have in an existing 
document.
 
 You can select as much text as you like. An entire paragraph isn’t out 
of the question. If you select the ending paragraph mark with the text, 
Word knows both the text and the current text’s formatting. If you want 
Word to know only the text, don’t include paragraph marks.
 
2. With the text selected, choose Insert➪AutoText➪New.
 
 This summons the Create AutoText dialog with a suggested name for 
your AutoText entry, as shown in Figure 6-1.
 
Figure 6-1: 
Teaching 
Word a new 
expression.
 
 
3. (Optional) If you don’t want to use Word’s suggestion, type a new 
name in the field.
 
4. Click OK to close the Create AutoText dialog and add the entry to 
Word.
 
 Word looks for the names of AutoText entries as you type, and when 
you begin to type the first few letters, AutoText fills in the rest of the 
text for you.

Book II
Chapter 6
Saving Time in 
Word 
273
Automating with AutoText
In this example, whenever you type Nuclear Factor, Word knows you 
want to use the long, awful Nuclear Factor-Kappa B and Placental Apoptosis 
expression in your document. Because you included the paragraph mark, 
Word knows you want the paragraph formatting applied, too. You don’t 
have to use any of the words of the saved AutoText in the name you give to 
AutoText. You can invent your own AutoText naming scheme.
 
Any AutoText entries you create in Word work in Excel, PowerPoint, and 
Entourage, too.
Using AutoText on a daily basis
Word always enables you to choose between accepting the AutoText displayed 
as a ToolTip and continuing to type. Because you taught Word the text 
you want and set up a name, whenever Word sees you typing that name, 
it displays a ToolTip (as shown in Figure 6-2) with the full or abbreviated 
AutoText. If you want to use the AutoText, all you have to do is press Return 
or Enter. Word instantly does the tough typing and inserts the full text. 
(This automated way of typing is AutoComplete.) If you don’t want to use the 
AutoText suggestion, you can keep right on typing, and Word doesn’t bother 
you about it.
 
Figure 6-2: 
Activating 
an AutoText 
prompt.
 
 
Some people find AutoText ToolTips distracting. You can reduce the 
distraction by using a prefix when you give your AutoText a name. For 
example, you could use a prefix, such as Atext, for all your AutoText entries 
so that the AutoText appears only when you intentionally type Atext along 
with the rest of the name.
You may have noticed that we marked AutoText as a Mac-only feature earlier 
in this section. You may have used Word for Windows and are saying, “Hey! 
Wait a minute! That’s available on Word for Windows, too!” Well, AutoText 
used to be; it was removed from Word 2007 and replaced by Building Blocks, 
which doesn’t have the AutoText ToolTip feature so you can no longer use 
AutoComplete to automate your typing. No more AutoText for Windows 
users; it’s gone. Kaput! Thankfully, AutoText is still alive on Mac.

274
Automating with AutoText
Teaching Word even more
Turns out Word is pretty smart. You can teach Word more than just text. 
Word for Mac can save just about anything you come across as AutoText. 
The neat thing about AutoText is that you don’t even have to open a template, 
apply a style, or even use Elements Gallery — you just keep typing, and 
AutoText will autocomplete for you on demand. Here’s a short list of things 
you might want to turn into AutoText entries (these are all things you 
commonly use or need to type):
 
✦ Plain text (excluding paragraph marks)
 
✦ Formatted text, paragraphs, or more (including paragraph marks)
 
✦ Your favorite formatted tables
 
✦ Equations you use frequently
 
✦ Graphs that you’ve customized
 
✦ Pictures or logos that you use often
 
✦ Word fields
 
✦ WordArt and SmartArt
 
✦ A form or form letter
 
✦ Just about anything you want to have at your fingertips and can select 
within a Word document
Taming AutoText
Creating your own AutoText entries is really great. A lot of AutoText entries 
come with Office that you might not have much use for. In fact, many people 
can ditch most, if not all, of the AutoText entries that come with Word. Some 
would rather have just their own things in the AutoText list, thank you.
You can use the AutoText toolbar to create your own AutoText entries. After 
you complete your AutoText entries, you can turn off the toolbar and forget 
about it because AutoText is, well, automatic. From Word’s View menu, 
choose Toolbars➪AutoText to turn on the AutoText toolbar, as shown in 
Figure 6-3.
 
You can find the same controls from the AutoText toolbar on Word’s Insert 
menu by choosing AutoText. The controls are on the submenus.
After you turn on the AutoText toolbar, get familiar with the following three 
buttons:
 
✦ AutoText: Click the AutoText button (the first button on the left with a 
large A, as shown in Figure 6-3) on the AutoText toolbar to open AutoText 
preferences within the AutoCorrect dialog, as shown in Figure 6-4.

Automating with AutoText
 
 If you’re wondering why AutoText is under AutoCorrect preferences 
even though AutoText has nothing to do with making corrections, it’s 
because Word uses its AutoCorrect technology to accomplish the ability 
to AutoComplete AutoText entries as you type. Here you can make 
additional selections:
 
• Automatically Correct Spelling and Formatting as You Type: This check 
box is an on/off switch for all the automatic Word behaviors shown 
on all the tabs of AutoCorrect preferences. Deselect the box to turn 
off all aspects of AutoCorrect.
 
• Show AutoComplete Tip for AutoText, Contacts, and Dates: This check 
box is probably the most important one for AutoText because it’s 
an on/off switch for the AutoText AutoComplete feature. Deselecting 
this check box pretty much defeats the purpose of AutoText unless 
you want to turn AutoText off for a particular demonstration. If 
you deselect this, you can still use the AutoText toolbar All Entries 
pop-up menu or Word’s Insert menu to manually put AutoText 
entries into your document. Also, you can turn AutoComplete back 
on by checking the box.
 
 Review the other check boxes and make changes to suit your own 
preferences. If you write many business letters with long text entries 
that are often repeated, you might want to leave most of these 
options selected.
 
• Look In: This is a pop-up menu that lets you filter what AutoText 
entries are displayed in the AutoText entries list. You can choose 
from any currently open document template. AutoText entries are 
stored in templates.
 
• Enter AutoText Entries Here: Take a look at the list of entries, as 
shown in Figure 6-4. If you see things in the list that you want to have 
AutoComplete finish, leave them. Otherwise, delete the entries you 
don’t need. Click OK when you’re done cleaning AutoText entries. 
Click a name to see a preview of the entry.
 
• Delete: Select an AutoText entry; then click Delete to permanently 
remove it. AutoText entries are saved to Normal (.dotx) template. 
Changes to Normal template are saved when you quit Word.
 
• Insert: Inserts the selected AutoText into your document at the 
position of the insertion cursor.
 
• Add: If you select something before opening these preferences, you 
can type a name and click Add to create a new AutoText entry.
 
 If you ever need to find your own AutoText entries, they’re stored in 
Word’s Normal template (Normal.dotx). You can use Organizer (which 
we discuss in Chapter 3 of this minibook) to copy AutoText entries from 
one template to another.

Making Magic with Mail Merge
If one major area exists in which Office 2008 for Mac beats all the others by 
a country mile, mail merge is it! Sending mail to a group of people in one fell 
swoop has never been so easy.
Your authors give two thumbs up — as well as a standing ovation — to 
Office 2008’s Mail Merge Manager. We find OpenOffice and Windows Office 
Mail Merge to be little more than frustrating tests of patience and no way to 
get actual work done. In Word 2008, you don’t have confusing field mapping, 
task panes, or other such gobbledygook. Mail merge is straightforward and 
intuitive thanks to the geniuses at Microsoft who put together the easy-to-use 
Mac-only Mail Merge Manager.
Mail Merge Manager is designed to be used starting at the top in Step 1, 
and you work your way down to Step 6. These steps are explained in the 
online Mail Merge course described in the following section. After you figure 
out how to use this handy tool, you can use it for all kinds of things, such 
as e-mailing forms, announcements, newsletters, and other publications; 
addressing envelopes; and preparing brochures. You can perform mail 
merges in minutes, rather than hours or days.
Getting started: Making a mail merge form letter
There is a superb, free course on making a mail merge to a form letter 
available to you right in Word 2008 Help. After you take the tutorial, you’ll 
find that this book supplements the mail merge basics covered. The course 
takes about 20 minutes to complete. If you’re new to mail merge or want to 
review the mail merge process, take this course before continuing further 
in this section. A live Internet connection is required to take this course. To 
take this excellent free course, do the following:
 
 1. Click Word’s Help button on the Standard toolbar.
 
 
 Word Help opens, as shown in Figure 6-5.

When you mail merge to send e-mail rather than conventional snail mail letters, 
the body of your main merge document needs to have a placeholder with 
e-mail addresses in it. Otherwise, Word doesn’t know which e-mail addresses 
to send to. At times, you may not want the recipient’s e-mail address to 
appear in the document’s body. Here’s a trick to keep the e-mail address 
from showing in an HTML format mail merge:
  
1. Highlight the e-mail placeholder.
 
2. In Word choose Format➪Font.
 
 The Font dialog appears.
 
3. On the Font tab of the Font dialog, in the Effects section, select the 
Hidden check box.
 
4. Click OK to close the Font dialog.
 
 The selected e-mail field is no longer visible. This way the e-mail address 
doesn’t show in the document, but it’s still there for Word to use.
Merging to envelopes
After you print your letters, make envelopes for them. You might want to 
make envelopes for other purposes, too, such as cards and invitations. The 
general procedure is the same for merging to envelopes as for merging to a 
form letter, which we describe in the preceding section.
We start a fresh example with a new, blank Word document. Make sure Mail 
Merge Manager is visible; if not, in Word, choose Tools➪Mail Merge Manager 
to turn it on. To merge to envelopes, only the first step of Mail Merge 
Manager needs special instructions. The rest of the steps are the same as 
for merging to a letter (which we describe in the preceding section). Follow 
these steps to choose your envelope’s size for the mail merge:
 
1. On Mail Merge Manager in Step 1, Select Document Type: Choose 
Create New➪Envelopes.
 
 The Envelope dialog appears (see Figure 6-7).
 
 Word creates a #10 standard business size envelope by default. If that’s 
the envelope size you need, click OK to close the Envelope dialog, and 
you’re done! You don’t have to do any more steps to select an envelope 
size. You can now pick up with Step 2 of Mail Merge Manager, which we 
describe in preceding section.

Making labels
Generally, when it comes to creating mailing labels, you want one of two 
things:
 
✦ A sheet in which all the labels are exactly the same (to send to one 
person or address)
 
✦ To make labels from a data source in which each label has a different 
address obtained from the database
Word can do both kinds of labels.
 
Before we talk about either kind of label, we talk a little bit about label 
etiquette. One huge offense is cramming too much stuff onto a small label. 
If you’re going to use labels that are 3 across and 10 down on 8
1⁄2-x-11–inch 
paper, please don’t try to put 5 or more lines of information or super long 
lines on these little pieces of paper. Shrinking the font to 4 or 8 points is not 
a good solution! They make bigger labels. Use them!
Making a sheet of identical labels
In this example, we start with a new, blank Word document that will contain 
a set of identical labels 3 across and 10 down on 8
1⁄2-x-11–inch paper in less 
than 3 minutes! Follow these steps, and substitute your own paper size and 
the number of labels you want to fit on a page:
 
1. In Word, choose Tools➪Labels.
 
 The Labels dialog appears, as shown in Figure 6-11.

It’s that easy. Pretty cool, huh? The rest of this section explains how you can 
customize your label in just about every way imaginable. Setting up labels is 
handled in a single, compact pane. Another way to display the Labels dialog 
(see Figure 6-11) in all its glory is to, in Word, choose Tools➪Labels.
In the Labels dialog, you can do the following:
 
✦ Address your labels: In the Address field in the upper left, type the 
name and address you want placed on each label. If you like, you can 
use an address from your Entourage contacts by following the instructions 
in Step 2 in the earlier steps about making identical labels.
 
✦ Customize text formatting: Use the Font button to open Word’s Font 
dialog to customize the text formatting.
 
✦ Choose your label size: Pick a label size from hundreds of different sizes 
and preset labels from more than 14 different manufacturers from the 
Label Products pop-up menu.
 
✦ Create a custom label: As if that weren’t enough, in the Label Options 
dialog, click the New Label button that opens the New Custom [laser or 
dot matrix] dialog (not illustrated because you will probably never need 
to do this) that allows you to create a completely customized label from 
scratch.
 
Really, 99 percent of the time all you have to do is just look on the box of 
labels you have and select the brand and product number from the Label 
Products pop-up menu in the Label Options dialog (refer to Figure 6-12).
 
When printing labels, try printing on a sheet of plain paper first. Hold your 
test sheet of labels up to the light with a sheet of blank labels to see how 
everything lines up. You can adjust the margins by dragging them in the 
ruler, or click the Customize button in the Labels dialog to fine-tune 
everything so your labels line up perfectly.

Making labels from a database
You can also use an Excel workbook as your mail merge data source. Start 
with a new, blank Word document. For this example, you make a set of labels 
3 across and 10 down on 8
1⁄2-x-11–inch paper. Make sure Mail Merge Manager 
is turned on by choosing Tools➪Mail Merge Manager in Word. You also need 
an Excel document that’s set up as a mailing list. To make labels from a 
database, take the following steps. In this sequence, the step numbers 
shown here match the step numbers of Mail Merge Manager.
 
1. Select Document Type:
 
a. Choose Create New.
 
b. From the pop-up menu, choose Labels.
 
 The Label Options dialog (see Figure 6-12) appears.
 
c. From the Label Products pop-up menu, choose Avery Standard.
 
d. From the Product Number list, select 5160 — Address.
 
e. Click OK to close the Label Options dialog.
 
 A table appears. Don’t make any adjustments to the table or click 
in the table. The insertion cursor should be blinking in the upper 
leftmost cell, which will be the only empty cell in the table. You 
may have to drag the bottom scroll bar to see the blinking cursor. 
Section 1 of Mail Merge Manager now displays the name of the Main 
Document and which type of merge you’re performing.
 
2. Select Recipients List:
 
a. Click Get List.
 
b. From the pop-up menu, choose Open Data Source.
 
 A File Open window appears.
 
c. Navigate to the Excel (.xlsx) workbook you’re using as the data source 
and click Open.
Here’s a set of timesaving steps that produce a 
single sheet of identical labels:
 1. In Word, choose Tools➪Labels.
 2. In the Labels dialog, type the name and 
address you want to use.
 3. Click the Options button to display the 
Label Options dialog.
 4. Choose your brand and model label in the 
Label Products pop-up menu.
 
 For standard 3-across-by-10-down labels, 
choose Avery 5160 — address.
 5. Click OK to close the Label Products 
pop-up and click OK again to close the 
Labels dialog.

a. When the Edit Labels dialog opens, you see an empty Sample Label 
with a blinking insertion cursor. Click the Insert Merge Field pop-up, 
and choose the field that will be on the left of the top row of the label.
 
 In Figure 6-13, the first field is <<FirstName>>. Word puts chevrons 
surrounding the field name to indicate that they’re merge fields.
 
b. In this example, press the spacebar once to put a space between First 
Name and Last Name.
 
c. Choose Last Name from the Insert Merge Field pop-up menu.
 
d. To move the insertion cursor to the next line, press Return or Enter.
 
 Continue the same way to add remaining fields. You can type 
characters as needed, such as a comma to separate City from State. 
Do not use Insert Postal Bar Code because the U.S. Post Office 
changed how it generates postal bar codes, and Word doesn’t 
conform to the new specification.

book as the data source, select the data 
source worksheet or named range when 
prompted.
 3. Edit Labels: Pick fields from the Insert 
Merge Field pop-up menu. Arrange those 
fields as you want them to appear on the 
labels.
 4. (Optional) Filter Recipients: Click Options 
to filter the data or order the records.
 5. Preview Results: Click the <<ABC>> button 
and the arrow buttons to see a preview of 
the merge.

Merging to a catalog
In Project Gallery, you find two stunning catalogs that you can customize 
and use with mail merge. To access these catalogs, follow these steps:
 
1. In Word, choose File➪Project Gallery.
 
 Project Gallery displays.
 
2. In the Category list on the left, click the disclosure triangle next to the 
Marketing option to reveal subcategories.
 
3. Choose the Catalogs subcategory.
 
 You see at least two catalogs: Booklet and Photo. You can customize 
either of these templates and use them as the basis for starting a mail 
merge.
 
In Mail Merge Manager Step 1: Select Document Type, you can choose 
Catalog from the Create New pop-up menu. Choose this option to build 
custom, personalized catalogs and price sheets. For example, you could pull 
pictures from a database to create individualized custom catalogs based on 
customer purchasing volume or some other criteria.
Using different data sources
Earlier in this chapter, we used Excel as the data source for a mail merge. 
Word can use many different data sources to perform a mail merge. In Mail 
Merge Manager Step 2: Select Recipients List, you can choose the Get List 
option to display options, as shown in Figure 6-14.
 
Figure 6-14: 
Choosing a 
data source.
 
New Data Source
The New Data Source option (see Figure 6-14) creates a new Word document 
to use as the source for the mail merge. This option is fine for small, home 
databases, or maybe even a club’s database.

Making Magic with Mail Merge
 
You might find Word’s Database toolbar to be very handy when working 
with the New Data Source feature. In Word, choose View➪Toolbars➪
Database. By default, the Database toolbar shows up as a set of buttons, but 
you can set the toolbar’s button properties to Image and Text to see what 
each button does. We cover changing toolbar button properties in Book I, 
Chapter 3.
Be aware that using a Word document as a data source doesn’t cut it for 
large data sources. If you find that Word becomes slow when working with 
the data source, move your table to Excel (you can copy from Word and 
paste into Excel).
Open Data Source
The Open Data Source option (see Figure 6-14) enables you to navigate in 
Finder to a Word document that was set up as a database using New Data 
Source, as described in the preceding section, or an Excel workbook contain-
ing a worksheet or named range that’s already set up as a mailing list or a 
data source list. Open Data Source requires that you already have a list.
Office Address Book
The Office Address Book option (see Figure 6-14) allows you to use your 
Entourage contacts as the mail merge data source.
FileMaker Pro
The FileMaker Pro option (see Figure 6-14) allows you to navigate in Finder 
to a FileMaker Pro file that’s already set up as a mailing list or a data source 
list.
Previewing merge results
Mail Merge Manager Step 5: Preview Results is a favorite step. In this step, 
you can see the merged data so you can decide whether your merge works 
as planned. In Mail Merge Manager Step 3, you put placeholders into your 
mail merge main document to indicate fields that would accept merge data. 
Those placeholders are the field names displayed with chevrons. When you 
see chevrons, you know you’re seeing the field names. A common set of field 
names is
<< First Name >> << Last Name >>
This is when the magic of previewing your results comes in (see Figure 6-15). 
You can display your merge fields in one of three ways:

290
Making Magic with Mail Merge
 
✦ If you don’t press any buttons, you see the field names with chevrons.
 
✦ If you click the View Merged Data <<ABC>> button, Word displays the 
actual data that will be merged from the database instead of the field 
codes.
 
Figure 6-15: 
Controlling 
the preview 
of our data.
 
View merged data ABC
View first record
Previous record
Go to current record
Next record
View final record
View field codes
 
 If you press the View Merged Data <<ABC>> button, you can see your 
document in live preview mode while you press the buttons in Mail 
Merge Manager (see Figure 6-15) to view the data records as they will 
appear when you complete the merge. You can type a specific record 
number into the Go to Record box and then press Return or Enter to see 
that particular record. The same box shows you which record is displayed 
currently.
 
✦ If you press the View Field Codes button, as shown in Figure 6-16, it 
overrides the View Merged Data <<ABC>> button; you see the third type 
of display Word has for mail merge fields. We discuss field codes in 
Chapter 7 of this minibook. For now, field codes look seemingly mystifying 
like this:
{ MERGEFIELD First Name } { MERGEFIELD Last Name }
When you are done looking at previews, just move on to the next step in 
Mail Merge Manager.
Completing the merge
By the time you get to Mail Merge Manager Step 6: Complete Merge, you 
have a very smart document on your hands; it knows what database you 
want to use, what fields to bring in, where to place the data within the 
document, and any special instructions you’ve given. Think of Complete 
Merge as having an electronic printing press, with the press ready to roll.
Performing a test run
Before you print a large merge, do a sample run. The Merge Data Range 
pop-up menu can help you. Doing a test run is probably a good idea, 
especially if you have lots of data to merge. Here are the options to control 
your sample run:

✦ All: Use this setting to complete the entire merge.
 
✦ Current Record: With the record indicated in Mail Merge Manager 
Step 5, this option merges only one record.
 
✦ Custom: Enter a range of records.
Doing the merge
Okay, if you’ve followed along so far, you’re ready to do an actual merge! 
The question is: Where do you want the output to happen? You have three 
choices, as shown in Figure 6-16.

Merge to E-Mail
Merge to Printer
When you click Merge to Printer, Word sends the final product to the 
printer. Be sure you have plenty of paper and ink handy if you’re printing a 
lot of pages!
 
Before you print your finished work to an actual paper and ink printer, first 
do a mail merge test run so that you don’t end up wasting resources. You 
can save paper and ink or toner by choosing PDF in the Print dialog, or 
merging to a New Document (which we cover in the following section) to 
see the complete, final merge before you use Merge to Printer.
Merge to a New Document
When you click Merge to a New Document, Word creates a fresh, new document 
that has all the merged information in it. If you printed this document, it’d be 
the same as if you had merged to the printer. This new document is a regular 
Word document. This merged document doesn’t have any merge fields in it — it 
displays the result of the merge as ordinary text. Consequently, this merged 
document isn’t connected to the data source, and it won’t change when the 
data source is updated. It’s a good a way to make a record of the output of 
your mail merge and provides a merged document that you can distribute to 
other people.

Merge to E-Mail
Click Merge to E-Mail to send the output to your Entourage Outbox and

the recipients’ e-mail addresses.
 
✦ Subject field: Type a subject in this field, and each message is given this 
subject.
 
✦ Send As pop-up menu: You have three choices:
 
• Plain Text: Only text and numeric characters from your document 
will be sent. All formatting is discarded. Text in text boxes, WordArt, 
figures, charts, objects (organization charts, equations, and so on) 
may be discarded.
 
• Attachment: A copy of the Word document is sent as an e-mail 
attachment. Use this to ensure the recipient gets a full fidelity 
document. This is the option you’ll probably use the most.
 
• HTML: Word sends the document as HTML (the language of Web 
browsers). Modern e-mail clients can render HTML, some better 
than others. To see what your document might look like when it’s 
received, switch to Web Layout View in Word before you send in 
HTML format. Due to the nature of HTML, Word, and e-mail clients, 
HTML can produce widely varying appearance in e-mail programs.
 
 Before you send the whole batch as HTML, take a moment to merge just 
one record to make sure it looks okay in Entourage. Some of the gorgeous 
templates in Project Gallery are too complex for Entourage and other 
e-mail programs. If you’re not happy with the HTML rendering, choose 
Send as Attachment.

button on the Entourage toolbar to send them immediately. Off they go!
Automating Long Document Chores
If you’re creating a particularly long document, such as a book manuscript, 
you can take advantage of some clever automation features in Word 2008.
Your document may have plenty of illustrations, charts, equations, or other 
things that need to be labeled and kept track of. That’s when Word’s Index 
and Tables feature comes in handy.
Making an instant Table of Contents
Word 2008 features a fast, new way to make a Table of Contents (TOC). If 
you’ve been using heading styles throughout your document, the process is 
entirely automatic. Otherwise, select the Manual Formatting option. Follow 
these steps to make a TOC (see Figure 6-18):
 
1. Click in the document where you want the TOC to appear.
 
2. If Elements Gallery isn’t visible, choose View➪Elements Gallery.
 
 If Elements Gallery is grayed out in the menu, use the View menu to 
switch to a view, such as Print Layout View, that supports Elements 
Gallery.
 
3. In the Elements bar, choose Document Elements and then click the 
Table of Contents button just beneath the Elements bar.
 
 A gallery with TOC heading samples, as shown in Figure 6-18, appears.
Merge to E-Mail is a very powerful capability. 
If you merge 10 or 20 e-mail messages, no one 
will bother you. Word can merge more than 
one million messages at a time from an Excel 
database. If your merge involves hundreds of 
records, make sure your Entourage rules are 
set up sensibly. A flood of e-mails into a Sent 
Items box can make your account exceed your 
quota. Even 100 messages might cause those 
IT people or Internet service providers (ISP), 
who usually take weeks to respond to you, 
to be at your doorstep in minutes with fire in 
their eyes or your account might be shut down. 
Make sure your ISP or IT folks know ahead of 
time that you plan to send a large merge so that 
you don’t get into trouble with them. They may 
have to make special arrangements to allow 
more than a certain number of your messages 
be sent and delivered.

either the Heading Styles or Manual Formatting option.
 
• Choose Heading Styles if your document contains heading styles.
 
• Choose Manual if your document does not contain heading styles.
 
5. In Elements Gallery, choose a heading style.
 
 Based on the heading styles you used in the document, Word creates 
a quick TOC for you! If you choose the Manual option, Word guesses at 
your document’s structure and presents you with a generic TOC based 
on your format choice from the Gallery so that you can customize 
manually.

✦ Modify (Index and Tables dialog): Available if you choose From 
Template in the Styles list.
Long Document Wizard
When you create a TOC in Word, you use the Index and Tables dialog, or 
as we call it, the Long Document Wizard. (Why Word doesn’t call it a wizard 
is a mystery to us.) The Index and Tables dialog has four tabs (as shown in 
Figure 6-19), each representing a wonderful timesaving operation that Word 
can perform for you. The four tabs are
 
✦ Index: Automatically creates an index using marked entries.
 
✦ Table of Contents: Automatically creates a table of contents using 
headings.
 
✦ Table of Figures: Automatically creates a table of figures using figure 
captions.
 
✦ Table of Authorities: Automatically creates a Table of Authorities based 
on styles.
Creating an index
At times, you work on a long document in which you might want an index 
with page numbers. Word can automate this task for you. This procedure 
entails two steps:
Each tab of the Index and Tables dialog repre-
sents a specific kind of index or table. Because 
all the Index and Tables formats use styles, 
you can use the same techniques to create, 
customize, and delete your own styles as you 
do for table styles in Chapter 5 of this minibook. 
To enable the ability to customize any index or 
table, select From Template in the Index and 
Tables Formats list of any tab to activate the 
Modify button. Click Modify to open the Style 
dialog. In the Style dialog, click Modify Style to 
open the Modify Style dialog.

1. Mark the words or phrases to be used in the index.
 
2. Generate the index.
To mark the words or phrases to be used in the index, you create a 
concordance file. Don’t let that word scare you; a concordance file is a fancy 
name for a Word document that consists of a single- or two-column table. 
For information on how to create other kinds of tables, see Chapter 5 in this 
minibook. Follow these steps to create a concordance table:
 
1. In Word, choose menu➪New Blank Document.
 
 A new, blank Word document appears.
 
2. Choose Table➪Insert➪Table.
 
 The Index and Tables dialog appears.
 
3. In the Index and Tables dialogs, set Number of Columns to 2.
 
 For now, the number of rows you have is irrelevant. The other default 
settings are fine and don’t need to be changed.
 
4. Click OK to close the Index and Tables dialog.
 
 A two-column table appears in your document.
 
5. Fill in the cells as described here (see Table 6-1):
 
• Left-hand column: Put all the words from your document that should 
be marked for indexing into the left column, one word or phrase 
per cell.
 
• Right-hand column: Enter the appropriate document index heading 
corresponding to each word in the left column.
 
• Don’t use column headings: Nothing else can be in the concordance 
file except your two-column table.
 
 In this example, any occurrence of Formatting, Web, PDF, or Table 
will appear under the Tables index heading. Any occurrence of 
AutoFormat or Formatting will appear in our index under the Styles 
index heading. You don’t have to group the words or the index 
headings. Word figures it all out for you. 
 
 6. Choose File➪Save to save the table as a Word document and then 
click the red Close button to close the concordance table document.
Table 6-1 shows a concordance table we made to use on a draft version of 
Chapter 5 of this minibook. The left column is a list of the words we want to 
mark for indexing. The right column is the index heading that is used for our 
marked words.

Whenever you work with the Index and Tables dialog, work only on copies of 
your files. You might go through several trials before you find the result you 
want.
After you save your concordance file, you can use it to create an index from 
a long document; in this case, the draft of Chapter 5 in this minibook. Follow 
these steps to use a concordance file:
 
1. In Word, choose File➪Open.
 
 The File Open dialog displays.
 
2. Select the Word document you want to index but don’t open it yet.
 
 For this example, we select Chapter 5.
 
3. In the File Open dialog, choose Copy from the Open pop-up menu and 
then click the Open button to open a copy of the document that you 
want to index.
 
 A copy of the document you chose opens.
 
4. In the copy of your document, choose Insert➪Index and Tables.
 
 The Index and Tables dialog opens (see Figure 6-21).
 
5. Click the Index tab and then click the AutoMark button.
 
 The Choose a File dialog opens.
 
6. Navigate to the concordance file you saved earlier and then click the 
Open button.
 
 
 Word marks the indexed words with { XE “Index” }. You have to 
turn on paragraph marks to see these index codes by clicking the Show 
button on Word’s standard toolbar. The Index and Tables dialog closes. 
All the words in your document that will be used in the index have now 
been marked. The following steps create the index.
 
7. Click in your document to set the insertion cursor to the place where 
you want to create the index.

Your basic index is all fine and well, but what if you want subheadings 
in your index? Word has that covered, too! With a colon (:), you can tell 
Word to create a subheading. Try this out with a new concordance table 
separating main headings from subheadings with a colon, as shown in the 
right-hand column of Table 6-2. Notice the overall main heading (Tables in 
this example) stands alone without colons so that the subheadings appear 
beneath the main heading. Also notice that Styles gets its own heading 
and is also listed as a subheading under Tables with our scheme. Look at 
Table 6-2 to see the headings and subheadings we used to produce the 
results, as shown in Figure 6-22. Figure 6-22 is in Draft View (in Word, choose 
View➪Draft) with Show Hidden Marks turned on (click the Show button on 
the Standard toolbar).

Creating a Table of Figures
Many long documents have plenty of figures in them, and whether the figures 
are tables, pictures, graphs, drawings, SmartArt, WordArt, or embedded 
objects, you can list them all in one place in your document by creating a 
Table of Figures with the Index and Tables dialog. Before you can create a 
Table of Figures, you have to put a caption style onto each of the figures you 
want included in the table. To put a caption on a figure, follow these steps:
 
1. Select a figure and then choose Insert➪Caption in Word.
 
 The Caption dialog appears, as shown in Figure 6-23.
 
2. Type a caption in the Caption text box and make any other changes.
 
3. Click OK when you’re done and repeat the process for other figures in 
the document.

After you finish marking the citations, follow these steps to create a Table of 
Authorities:
 
1. Click in the document to set the insertion cursor at the place where 
you want the Table of Authorities to appear.
 
2. In Word, choose Insert➪Index and Tables.

 The Mark Citation dialog opens. Citations are grouped by category.
You may notice in Figure 6-27 that Word allows you to index long citations. 
When you use the Table of Authorities feature, you might not like the way 
Word uses page numbers for citations in paragraphs that extend over a page 
break. Word uses the page number from the end of the paragraph rather 
than the beginning. To fix this, manually drag the { XE... } marker to the 
start of the paragraph.
Creating an executive summary or an abstract
When you’re in a hurry and need to create an executive summary right away, 
follow these steps:
 
1. In Word, choose Tools➪AutoSummarize.
 
 The AutoSummarize dialog, as shown in Figure 6-29, appears.
 
2. In the Length of Summary area, adjust Percent of Original to control 
the length of the summary.
 
3. In the Type of Summary area, make your summary choice by clicking 
the four big buttons:
 
• Highlight key points: Uses a highlight color to accent key points 
throughout your document.
 
• Insert an executive summary or abstract at the top of the document.
 
• Create a new document and put the summary there.
 
• Hide everything except the summary without leaving the original docu-
ment.
 
 The selected summary type appears either in the current document or 
in a new document if you choose that option.

Formatting the Background
A deep presence lurks behind the Word text. No, this presence isn’t a ghost 
or a snake; it’s just the background. Normally the background is white, but 
you can change that and even apply document theme colors to it. You have 
to use Print Layout View for this to work, so if you’re not already in Print 
Layout View, click the Print Layout View button at the lower-left corner of 
the document window to switch to it. When you modify the background 
in Print Layout View, Word can convert it into Notebook Layout View and 
Publishing Layout View. Word 2008 is the first Mac version of Word that can 
print the background layer.

A

difficult or complicated. Knowing the things in this chapter can make your 
experience with Word more productive and enjoyable. Who knows? Maybe 
you’ll wind up using one of these features every day after you discover how 
it can help.
Wrapping Text around Objects
From pictures and graphs to SmartArt, you can easily add all sorts of 
objects to a Word document. But after the object is inserted in your Word 
document, you’ll probably need to wrap your text around it.
 
Text wrapping denotes how text in a Word document flows around the 
periphery of other objects, such as pictures and graphs. Objects usually 
have text wrapping set to In Line with Text. In Line with Text is a text 
wrapping option that doesn’t allow text to wrap on the sides of the inserted 
object.
Most of the time, text wrapping breaks the text so that when you insert the 
object into your document, the text flow is split above and below the new 
object. This is often just fine, but at times, you’ll want to change the text 
wrapping style, which we show you later in this section.

312
Wrapping Text around Objects
The Formatting Palette has a Wrapping pane, as shown in Figure 7-1, which 
appears when you select any inserted objects. This pane has options that 
enable you to control how the text flows around, in front of, or behind the 
object. You can also set how close the text will be to the object and which 
side(s) of the object text will flow. Look at Figure 7-1; notice how the Square 
option allows the text to flow around the object (a picture of a gavel, in this 
case). To adjust Word’s wrapping, take the following steps:
 
1. Turn on the Formatting Palette if it isn’t visible already.
 
 Click the Toolbox button on Word’s Standard toolbar. You may have to 
use the View menu and switch to a different view to enable the Toolbox.
 
2. Select the object.
 
 The border surrounding the object becomes prominent, usually with 
dots that you can drag to resize the object.
 
3. In the Style pop-up menu of the Wrapping section, choose Square.
 
 Text wraps around your object based on your style choice.
Word allows you to have precise control over how the text flows around an 
object. If you don’t like the way text flows around an object, do the following:
 
1. Select the object.
 
 The selected indicator with resize handles displays, as shown in Figure 7-1.
 
2. In the Wrap To pop-up menu in the Wrapping section of the 
Formatting Palette, choose from one of these four options:
 
• Both Sides: Text flows around the object to the left and right sides 
and the margins.
 
• Left: Text flows between the left side of the object and the left 
margin.
 
• Right: Text flows between the right side of the object and the right 
margin.
 
• Largest Side: Text flows between the object and whichever side has 
more room between the object and the margin.
Now take a really close look and compare how text flows around the gavel 
in Figure 7-1 with Figure 7-2. Notice how in Figure 7-2, fox fills in the space 
between the gavel’s handle and its head. To be able to fine-tune wrapping 
to this degree, you have to turn on the special Edit Wrap Boundary handles. 
Here’s how to turn on the wrap boundary:

pop-up menu.
 
 Text will wrap closely to the object.
 
3. In the Formatting Palette, in the Style section, choose Edit Wrap 
Boundary from the pop-up menu.
 
 This turns on the wrap boundary handles, as shown in Figure 7-2. You 
can drag the boundary handles at drag points to control precisely how 
text flows around the object. Click a boundary line to add a drag point.

Drag points
Here’s another aspect about text flow that you need to know about: When 
you put an object into a Word document and then add text or other stuff 
earlier in the document, your object moves down along with the text in 
the document. A word-processing document works that way so that your 
objects stay where you place them in the document. You can change this 
behavior. See Book I, Chapter 4 to read about inserting objects with the 
Object Palette of the Toolbox.
If you need your object to always stay in the same spot in the document 
regardless of the text it appears with, you can lock an object to an exact 
position in a document. Think of this as dropping a boat anchor — water 
flows by, but the boat stays in the same relative position to the shore. In 
Word, if you lock an object to a margin, the object stays in the same relative 
position and text flows around the object. This anchoring capability is a 
basis of publishing programs and is very handy to use in Word’s Publishing 
Layout View and Print Layout View. Follow these steps to anchor an object 
in Word:
 
1. Right-click or Control-click an object.
 
2. From the pop-up menu that appears, choose Format . . .
 
 The Format dialog opens.
 
3. Choose Layout in the left panel and then click the Advanced button.
 
 The Advanced Layout dialog opens, as shown in Figure 7-3.
 
4. Click the Picture Position tab.
 
5. (Optional) Set the position of an object precisely using controls in this 
dialog.
 
6. Under Options, select the Lock Anchor check box.
 
7. Click OK to close the Advanced Layout dialog and then click OK to 
close the Format dialog.
 
 Text now flows according to the settings you made, and the object is 
anchored to the position you selected.

Flowing Text from One Text Box into Another
Text flows and behaves in certain ways around fancy objects, such as 
pictures and charts, placed in a Word document. We take a look at how text 
behaves within ordinary text boxes.
You can create plain, empty text boxes or text boxes that are formatted 
already with niceties and ornamentation. We start with a single, plain text 
box. You can make a text box by using any one of the following three methods:
 
✦ In Word, choose Insert➪Text Box.
 
✦ Click the Text Box button on the Drawing toolbar.
 
 If the Drawing toolbar isn’t visible, choose View➪Toolbars➪Drawing.
 
✦ In Publishing Layout View, click the Text Box button on the Standard 
toolbar.
Each method turns the mouse cursor into a special cursor. Position the 
mouse where you want to start drawing and then click and hold down the 
mouse button while dragging diagonally in your document. Release the 

316
Flowing Text from One Text Box into Another
mouse button when the box is the shape you want (see Figure 7-4). If you 
hold down the Shift key while dragging, you get a perfect square.

plain text 
box.
 
Previous link handle
Drag to resize.
Forward link handle
Paragraph mark
 
 As you start typing in the box; notice that the text inside the box wraps 
automatically. You may have to make the box larger or use a small font size 
to make the text fit the box just right. You can use hard and soft returns to 
control paragraph formatting in Word. Click the Show button on Word’s 
Standard toolbar to show paragraph marks to see the difference between 
these two:
 
✦ Hard return: When you press Return or Enter, Word inserts a paragraph 
mark and moves the insertion cursor to the next paragraph.
 
✦ Soft return: When you hold down Shift as you press Return or Enter, 
Word moves the cursor to the next line without adding a paragraph 
mark. This is indicated by a little arrow symbol.
More fun with text boxes
Word 2008 sports some changes to text boxes. Notice that the resizing 
handles are bigger and easier to see. In Word 2008, every text box comes 
with two nice, new buttons: Previous Link and Forward Link. You use these 
to link several text boxes together so that text flows automatically from one 
box to another in a story. Try thinking of a chain of linked text boxes as a 
story in a newspaper, newsletter, or magazine.
When you create linked text boxes, if there’s more text than will fit into the 
first box, the text overflows into the second linked text box in the story, 
and so on. Each chain of linked boxes has its own color and independent 
numbering scheme. Stories often flow to a second page or at least a second 
column. When you combine text boxes, text flow, and the ability to anchor 
text boxes, you have the foundation of page layout programs. For you, this 
means that you don’t need an additional page layout program, such as 
Microsoft Publisher, if you have Word 2008.

Text boxes in Publishing Layout View
 
Text boxes work a little differently in Publishing Layout View than in other 
views. In addition to a refreshing new look for Word 2008, text boxes have 
new tools to help you position them on a page. Have a look at these new 
tools. You see the guides as you drag text box objects:
 
1. Open a new, blank document in Publishing Layout View.
 
 You can click the small triangle next to the New button on Word’s 
Standard toolbar and choose New Blank Publishing Layout Document 
from the pop-up menu.
 
2. Click the arrow next to the Show button on Word’s Standard toolbar

Click Show button to get pop-up menu.
Adjusting the various settings shown in this menu can result in some fun. 
Follow these steps to experience this firsthand:
 
1. Make sure you’re in Word’s Publishing Layout View.
 
 If you aren’t in Publishing Layout View, choose View➪Publishing Layout.
 
2. Make a text box.
 
 See the section, “Flowing Text from One Text Box into Another,” earlier 
in this chapter.
 
 A Text Box button is on the Standard toolbar in Word’s Publishing 
Layout View, and this can be used to quickly insert a new text box.
 
3. Click the forward link handle (as shown in Figure 7-4) on your text box.
 
 The cursor changes to a crosshair when you click the forward link 
handle.
 
4. Drag a new text box with this crosshair cursor.
 
 This creates a new text box linked to the first text box.

5. Type enough text in the first text box so that it overflows into the 
second box, as shown in Figure 7-6.
 
Figure 7-6: 
Text flowing 
from the 
first text 
box to the 
second.
 
With this example, you can create text boxes that span from the second to 
the third, and the third to the fourth text box, and so on to create a story. 
Word helpfully shows you the sequence number of all text boxes in a story, 
as shown in Figure 7-6.
After you create a new story, the previous link and forward link handles take 
you instantly to the neighboring link within the story’s chain. If you drag 
entire text boxes, guides appear to help you line up the boxes with each 
other.
Publishing Newspapers, Newsletters, and Periodicals
Get ready because if you read the sections before this one, you have all 
the elements you need to create superb publications. (If you haven’t, we’ll 
happily wait right here for you.) You know how to make text flow around 
objects, how to anchor objects, and how to make text flow in a story. Here 
we explore Publishing Layout View in more detail to see how this new fea-
ture can help you in your quest. We start with the new Standard toolbar, as 
shown in Figure 7-7.
Discovering new tools
As you can see, the Standard toolbar in Publishing Layout View has some 
familiar buttons, but this toolbar focuses on document layout and composition.
 
In this section, you open a template, explore some of the new Publishing 
Layout features, and customize your template. Then you can save your 
custom template as a new template for use in Project Gallery and Elements 
Gallery.

Customizing a template
 
You can easily customize your own template! Start from Project Gallery, 
as in the preceding section, or from Elements Gallery, which is what we do 
here:
 
1. Open a new, blank Word document in Publishing Layout View.
 
 Click the triangle to the right of the New button on Word’s Standard 
toolbar and choose New Blank Publishing Layout Document from the 
pop-up menu.
 
2. On the Elements bar, choose Publication Templates.
 
 Publication elements display. All the publication templates are new for 
Word 2008.
 
3. Choose an element you find interesting.
 
 A new document opens based on the chosen template.
 
4. Click a text box and start typing.
 
 In the case of linked text boxes, type in the first text box, and the text 
flows to the next text box. When you click a text box, pay attention to 
the Formatting Palette — a new Text Box section with advanced formatting 
controls appears, as shown in Figure 7-8. See Chapter 2 in this minibook 
for details on saving your customizations as a Word Template (.dotx) file.
To replace a template’s picture with one of your own:
 
1. Right-click or Control-click the picture and choose Change Picture 
from the pop-up menu.
 
2. Navigate or use Spotlight to locate the desired replacement picture 
and then click Insert.
Working with templates is easy. Use the Toolbox, menus, Elements Gallery, 
and toolbars that we discuss throughout this book to customize the template 
to your liking. This is where you unleash your creative juices to work your 
magic with Word’s vast array of tools.

Font formatting controls
 
Word 2008 Publishing Layout View has new font-formatting controls on the 
Formatting Palette (see Figure 7-9). You can use these controls on text that 
you select. These new controls include support for ligatures and baselines. 
Only a few fonts, such as Apple Chancery and some OpenType fonts in Mac 
OS X Leopard, have ligature support. Unless your font supports ligatures, 
the Ligatures in Document check box doesn’t have any effect.
 
✦ Ligature: The blending of two characters, as shown in Figure 7-8. 
Ligatures are fancy and give your document special appeal. In some 
cases, letters that don’t look clear when put in close proximity are 
spread apart more.
 
✦ Baseline: This is the imaginary line that text is on. You can select text 
and increase or decrease the baseline setting to move it slightly up or 
down. This increases the amount of space the line of text will use on the 
page.

Mastering master pages
Word takes the concept of a master page to a new level in Publishing Layout 
View. A master page is a kind of template page within a Word document. 
Whatever you put on the master page is duplicated on any pages that are 
based on it. Master pages are a way to maintain a consistent feel throughout 
your document as you add new pages. If you use master pages, you can 
save time by not having to re-create page elements, such as page numbers, 
headers, and footers, with each new page as you build your publication.
The School Newsletter template we use in the section, “Discovering new 
tools,” earlier in this chapter, makes use of these master pages. To see the 
master pages, click the Master Pages tab, which displays the document’s 
master or masters, near the bottom-right corner of the window, as shown in 
Figure 7-10.

 Publishing Layout View’s Insert button assists you with adding pages while 
maintaining the layout. To insert a new page based on the Master:
 
1. With a document open in Publishing Layout View, choose the All 
Contents tab in the lower-right corner of the document window.
 
 The All Contents tab shows you the contents of the document you are 
building.
 
2. On Word’s Standard toolbar, click the small triangle to the right of the 
Insert button.
 
 You may then choose from one of the following options: 
 
• New Page: Inserts a new page based on a master template.

Book II

Advanced 
Word Stuff 
323
Publishing Newspapers, Newsletters, and Periodicals
 
• New Master: Allows you to create a new master page out of the cur-
rent page. You can have multiple masters.
 
• Duplicate Page: Creates a duplicate page.
Switch back and forth between all contents and master pages by clicking 
the tabs at the lower-right corner of the document window. When you select 
the Master Pages tab, the Master Pages section of the Formatting Palette 
becomes available and offers three options:
 
✦ Different First Page: Allows the first page to be formatted independently 
of the rest of the master.
 
✦ Different Odd and Even Pages: Use this when setting up documents 
that will have pages that face each other when printed and you want to 
use a gutter or opposing page numbers.
 
✦ Same as Previous: Keeps formatting the same as the previous master 
page when you add new master pages.
Working with static guides
You can add static guides (see Figure 7-10), which are guide lines to help you 
align objects in Word’s Publishing Layout View. Follow these steps to create 
and add static guides to your document:
 
1. Make sure your rulers are visible.
 
 If your rulers aren’t visible, choose View➪Ruler to toggle them on.
 
2. Position the mouse cursor over a ruler and then drag a guide line 
from the ruler into the document.
 
 It’s as if there are static guides secretly waiting for you to drag them 
out of the rulers! While you drag, Word tells you the location of the line 
on the ruler. Position the static guide as desired and then release the 
mouse button. You can drag static guides to reposition them.
 
To remove static guides, click the triangle next to the Show button on the 
Standard toolbar and choose Clear Static Guides from the pop-up menu.
 
Static guides placed on the Master Pages tab appear when viewing both 
the Master Pages tab and the All Contents tab. Static guides placed on the 
All Contents tab don’t appear on the Master Pages tab. When removing 
static guides, guides placed on the All Contents tab need to be removed 
independently from the Master Pages tab.

Having a Field Day
Having a Field Day
Whether you’re new to Word or an old hand, Word fields can help you 
accomplish a wide variety of tasks, including all sorts of automation. We 
briefly discuss fields in relation to mail merge in Chapter 6 of this minibook. 
Here we take a closer look at fields and see what’s going on under the Word 
hood.
In their broadest definition, Word fields are special codes between brackets 
that perform various tasks. We have a hard time describing them better than 
that because they do so many different things. Word fields are an essential 
part of mail merge, page numbering, and other tasks. Some fields are very 
simple; others are quite complex. We show you how fields work with the 
Time Word field as an example.
Getting to know Word fields is probably easiest if you start with a new, blank 
Word document in Print Layout View.
In the following steps, we collect three tools and then put them onto a toolbar 
so that we can use them later. You can drag them to Word’s standard toolbar 
or any other toolbar. (Follow the instructions in Book I, Chapter 3 to create 
your own toolbars.) Follow these steps to drag these commands onto any 
toolbar of your choice:
 
1. In Word, choose View➪Customize Toolbars and Menus.
 
 The Customize Toolbars and Menus dialog appears.
 
2. Select the Commands tab and make sure that the left pane shows All 
Commands.
 
 Click in the right panel and then press the first letter of the command to 
bring you to that letter of the alphabet and save time.
 
3. Drag the ViewFieldCodes, InsertFieldChars, and UpdateFields 
commands to any toolbar.
 
 See Figure 7-11 to see part of the toolbar with these commands added.
 
4. Click OK to close the Customize Toolbars and Menus dialog.
 
Figure 7-11: 
Adding field 
commands 
to a toolbar.
 
Time to find out where Word fields hide on your computer. They quietly 
reside in a small, but powerful dialog; choose Insert➪Field. The Field dialog, 

Book II
Chapter 7

Word Stuff 
325
Having a Field Day
as shown in Figure 7-12, appears. Here you can insert a special code, dubbed 
a field code, into your Word document. The field code categories are listed 
on the left side of the dialog in the Categories list. The Field Names list on 
the right side of the dialog allows you to select a field code to insert into a 
document.

We’re going to grab the Time Word field and put it into a blank document so 
we can pick it apart and see how it works. For this example, see Figure 7-12 
and follow these steps:
 
1. Click the New button on Word’s Standard toolbar to open a new, 
blank Word document.
 
2. Choose Insert➪Field.
 
 The Field dialog, as shown in Figure 7-12, appears.
 
3. In the Categories list, choose Date and Time.
 
4. In the Field Names list, choose Time.
 
 The description in the dialog changes to The Current Time.
 
5. Click OK to close the Field dialog.
 
 The current time appears in the document.

326
Having a Field Day
After you have the time in your document, you notice that the time doesn’t 
change. A lot of good that’s going to do you. Refresh the time by updating 
the field code in this two-step process:
 
1. Select the time in your document.
 
 This tells Word that you want to do something with the time. By selecting 
the time (the result of the field code’s action), you also select the field 
code. If you’re really observant, you might notice that the field part of 
the selection looks darker, to let you know it’s not just text.
 
2. Click the Update Field button that you placed on a toolbar earlier in 
this section.
 
 Alternatively, right-click or Control-click the time and choose Update 
Field.
 
 The time refreshes.
The first step in the preceding list is very important. If you don’t select the 
field code first, nothing happens when you click the Update Field button. 
Here you look at the actual code. This, too, requires that you first select the 
field code:
 
1. Select the Time field code by selecting the time in your document.
 
2. Click the View Field Codes toggle button that you placed on a toolbar 
earlier in this section.
 
 Alternatively right-click or Control-click, and choose Toggle Field Codes.
 
 The actual code instead of the field’s result toggles on.
You can now see the actual field code, as shown in Figure 7-13, which is 
always contained within two curly brackets. From left to right, this list 
describes a field code:
 
✦ Opening bracket: This begins the field code.
 
✦ Field name: In Figure 7-13, TIME is the field name.
 
✦ Switches: Additional items that control how the field works.
 
 The switches for Time allow you to control how time will be formatted 
in the document. Switches for other Word fields can specify file paths, 
hyperlinks, symbols, and all kinds of different things!
 
✦ Closing bracket: This completes the field code.
 
Figure 7-13: 
Viewing a 
field code.
 

Book II
Chapter 7

Word Stuff 
327
Having a Field Day
You can type inside the field code’s special brackets. The brackets are 
special because they can’t be typed in from your keyboard, even though 
they look like the regular, curly brackets. You can insert an empty pair of 
field code brackets into any document by clicking the Insert Field Characters 
button you put on a toolbar earlier in this section. In this book, we discuss 
these ways of inserting field codes:
 
✦ In Word, choose Insert➪Field to insert any field code.
 
✦ Use Mail Merge Manager to insert mail merge Word fields.
 
✦ In Word, choose Insert➪Tables and Indexes to insert codes related to 
captions and various tables.
 
✦ Click the Insert Field Codes button from the toolbar you placed it on 
earlier in this section. You can type field codes manually or paste from 
other codes.
 
✦ Double-click headers and footers, which are field codes, in a document 
to edit and format them.
 
✦ Use the Forms toolbar to insert field codes relating to forms.
In Figure 7-13, the Time field is followed by the \* MERGEFORMAT switch. 
This switch instructs Word to keep the previous formatting when updating 
the field.
Create another Word field that displays the time, but this time add some 
optional formatting. Start with a new, blank document:
 
1. Click the New button on Word’s standard toolbar to open a new, 
blank Word document.
 
2. Choose Insert➪Field.
 
 The Field dialog, as shown in Figure 7-12, appears.
 
3. In the Categories list, choose Date and Time.
 
4. In the Field Names list, choose Time.
 
 The description in the dialog changes to The Current Time.
 
5. Click the Options button.
 
 The Field Options dialog opens, as shown in Figure 7-14.
 
6. Choose MMMM d, yyyy in the Date-Time Formats list.
 
 If you live somewhere other than the United States, you have to choose 
d MMMM, yyyy. You’ll have to drag the scroll bar down slightly to see 
this format. This just swaps the placement of the month and date! In the 
following list, m stands for month, d stands for day, and y stands for year 
(just like in Excel):
 
• M displays the number of the month.

328
Having a Field Day
 
• MM displays a two-digit number for the month.
 
• MMM displays a three-letter abbreviation for the month.
 
• MMMM displays the month spelled out.
 
• d displays the number of the date.
 
• dd displays the date as a two-digit number.
 
• ddd displays the date as a three-letter abbreviation.
 
• dddd displays the day of the week.
 
• YY displays a two-digit year.
 
• YYYY displays a four-digit year.
 
7. Click the Add to Field button.
 
 \@ plus the chosen format is added to the field code. In this example, 
you see TIME \@ “M/d/yy”. 
 
8. Click OK to close the Field Options dialog and then click OK to close 
the Field dialog.
 
 The current time appears in your document with the switch formatting.

Creating an Electronic Form
Take a look at your new field code, and compare the differences before (top) 
and after adding the formatting switch (bottom), as shown in Figure 7-15. 
You could’ve typed in all that formatting stuff, but Word typed it for you. Go 
ahead and experiment with the format code. Try the different variations that 
are listed in the Field Options dialog, such as M.d.yy, and notice the placement 
of quotation marks, if any. Quotation marks within Word fields tell Word to 
do certain things. In this case, they specify the formatting to apply.

Time is a fairly typical Word field. If you’ve followed along so far, you know 
quite a bit about Word fields and can fully customize page numbers, dates, 
and times in headers and footers.
Creating an Electronic Form
Word can create not only paper forms, but electronic ones, too! After you 
figure out how to create an electronic form in Word, you can distribute the 
forms, and the recipients can fill them in on their computers and then return 
them to you. You create forms in Word’s Print Layout View. You’ll find that 
the Forms toolbar can be a great help. To access the Forms toolbar, as 
shown in Figure 7-16, choose View➪Toolbars➪Forms.

Creating an Electronic Form
form to enable the form controls. You can toggle between Lock and Unlock 
modes for your form by clicking the Lock/Unlock Form button on the Forms 
toolbar (refer to Figure 7-16).
Using tables and frames in forms
The Insert Table and Insert Frame tools are on the Forms toolbar, as shown in 
Figure 7-16, for your convenience to help with your form’s layout. They work just 
like any other table or frame in a Word document, and you don’t have to use either 
of these. However, these tools can make precise placement of form controls much 
easier and more pleasing to the eye. You can use the Borders and Shading section 
of the Formatting Palette, which we describe in Chapter 5 of this minibook.
Inserting a text form field
The text box is the most common form field. You might have already filled in 
thousands of them in your lifetime. Name, address, and phone number are 
appropriate for text fields. To add one of these to a document:
 
 1. In an open Word document, place the insertion point where you want 
to insert a text form field.
 
 
 This insertion point can be within a table, in a frame, or basically 
anywhere in the document.
 
2. Make sure that the Forms toolbar is visible.
 
 If it isn’t, choose View➪Toolbars➪Forms.
 
3. Click the Text Form Field button on the Forms toolbar.
 
 A gray box (the form field) appears in your document at the insertion 
cursor position, and the fun begins.
 
 4. Click the gray box to select it and then click the Form Field Options 
button on the Forms toolbar.
 
 
 The Text Form Field Options dialog opens, as shown in Figure 7-17.
 
 The Text Form Field Options dialog is devilishly simple, yet brilliant. 
When you click the Type pop-up menu and choose a selection, the 
rest of the Text Form Field Options dialog changes to offer appropri-
ate choices based on your selection. Here are the six types of text form 
fields from which to choose:
 
• Regular Text: Word displays whatever is typed.
 
• Number: Numbers can be formatted and used in calculations.
 
• Date: Dates can be formatted.
 
• Current Date: Displays the current date in your form.
 
• Current Time: Displays the current time in your form.

Book II
Chapter 7
Advanced 
Word Stuff 
331
Creating an Electronic Form
 
• Calculation: Lets you calculate values based on entries made in 
number fields.
 
Figure 7-17: 
Setting up 
a text box 
form field.
 
 
 As you go through each field, notice that if you click the Type pop-up 
menu, you’re offered a different set of formatting options depending 
upon the type of field you’ve chosen.
 
 You can enter default text to be displayed in some fields and you can 
give the field a name, such as GrossSales1, which can be referred to in 
a formula calculation field (which we explain in just a bit). Always add a 
number to the field name and don’t use special characters or spaces.
The Add Help Text . . . button of the Text Form Field Options dialog in 
Figure 7-17 opens the Form Field Help Text dialog that enables you to add 
a prompt or explanatory text about the form field. You can have this text 
appear in the status bar at the bottom of the document window or have it 
appear when the user presses the Help button on the keyboard (but not 
from the Help option you see when you right-click or Control-click the field). 
This feature is pretty obscure, and we don’t recommend that you use it.
 
Work with form fields and set their options while the form is unprotected 
(or unlocked). You have to protect (or lock) a form before you can fill in the 
form fields.
Inserting a check box on a form
Adding a check box to a form is a piece of cake! Follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Check Box Form Field button on the Forms toolbar.
 
 A little square appears.
 
 2. Click the Form Fields Options button.
 
 
 The Check Box Form Field Options dialog opens (see Figure 7-18).

332
Creating an Electronic Form
 
Figure 7-18: 
Checking 
out a check 
box.
 
The following options in this dialog are
 
✦ Check Box Size: You have two choices here:
 
• Auto: Let Word decide.
 
• Exactly: Type a value or use the increase/decrease control.
 
✦ Default Value: Select Checked or Not Checked.
 
✦ Run Macro On: Word 2008 doesn’t support macros, but will in the next 
major release of Office.
 
✦ Field Settings: Three things exist in this area:
 
• Bookmark field: Give the check box a name ending with a number. 
We suggest that numbers you assign be sequential.
 
• Calculate on Exit: If you use calculations, you can select this box to 
cause Word to perform the calculations after the control is used. We 
explain calculated form fields in just a bit!
 
• Check Box Enabled: Deselect to disable this check box.
Upgrading to a combo
Want to upgrade to a combo meal? Yum! (Okay, so we shouldn’t write a 
computer book while we’re hungry.) In a form, a combo field is a pretty neat 
thing. Use a combo when you want the user to choose an entry from a list of 
choices. The Drop-Down Form Field is commonly referred to as a combo field. 
Follow these steps to create a combo field:
 
 1. Click the Drop-Down Form Field button on the Forms toolbar.
 
 
 A small gray box appears.
 
2. Click the Properties button.
 
 The Drop-Down Form Field Options dialog opens (see Figure 7-19).

✦ Drop-Down Item: Type an item to appear in the drop-down list.
 
✦ Add: Adds your typed Drop-Down item to the Items in Drop-Down List.
 
✦ Remove: Removes a selected item from the Items in the Drop-Down List.
 
✦ Items in Drop-Down List: These items appear in the drop-down list of 
choices that appears when the Drop-Down button is clicked in your 
finished, protected form.
 
✦ Move: Select an item in Items in Drop-Down List. Click an arrow to move 
it up or down in the list (changes the order of items in the list).
 
✦ Field Settings: Here are two of the field settings:
 
• Bookmark: Give the check box a name ending with a number. The 
numbers you assign should be sequential.
 
• Calculate on Exit: If you use calculations, you can select this box to 
cause Word to perform the calculations after the control is used. We 
explain calculated form fields in the following section!
When you’re done setting up the combo box and you select it within the 
form, it looks something like Figure 7-20.

Doing the math in Word forms
 
One more thing! Form fields are also Word fields. Figure 7-21 shows an 
example of a simple calculation. The figure shows the Word document on 
the left side, and the Text Form Fields Options dialog on the right. Notice 
that 25 is highlighted, so you can tell that this is the Text Form Field Options 
dialog to control the calculation.
We made three text box fields named Number1, Number2, and Answer1. 
In Figure 7-20, you see these three fields with descriptive text to their left. 
Underneath the three fields, we show the Answer1 field as it looks when 
Display Field Codes button is clicked so that you can see the code that does 
the calculation is the same as the entry shown in the Field Text Form Fields 
Options dialog in the Expression field. You can see from the dialog that the 
Type is set to Calculation, and on the left side, you can see that the result of 
the calculation is 25.
You can modify the formula in a field code by typing it in, which we recommend 
if the formula is long. Table 7-1 shows the operators supported by Word 
fields.

Grabbing just the form field data
Word has a special feature that allows you to save just the data from forms 
in a document, instead of saving the entire document. This is handy when all 
you need to have is the data, instead of the entire form. To make this special 
text file, start off in Word with a filled-in form document open:
 
1. Choose File➪Save As.
 
 The Save As dialog opens.
 
2. Click the Options button.
 
 Word’s Save dialog opens.
 
3. Select the Save Data Only for Forms (for Current Document Only) 
check box and click OK.
 
 Word’s Save dialog reappears.
 
4. Give your data file a name and a location and click Save.
When you open the resulting file in Word, you see all the form answers 
separated by commas. You could import this file into a database as a record 
or even open it within Microsoft Excel.
Working Word with the Web
When the Internet was young, Microsoft thought people wanted to round-trip 
Word documents by saving them in HTML (HyperText Markup Language) 
format, uploading the HTML documents to a Web server, and then opening 
the Word pages from the Web server right in Microsoft Word. Because this 
scenario never really took hold, Word 2004 is the last version of Word that 
can open Word-based HTML Web pages directly from the Internet. Word 
2008 can’t directly open Web pages from the Internet. Word’s File Open 
dialog can still open Web pages that were saved to your computer by a Web 
browser.

Managing Multiple Open Documents
Opening Web pages in Word
Getting Web pages into Word is a two-operation process. First, you save the 
Web page from your Web browser to your computer. Second, you open the 
Web page in Word.
Saving a Web page
To save a Web page to your computer:
 
1. In your Web browser, choose File➪Save As.
 
2. Choose the Web Archive (or Web Page Complete) format if it’s 
offered. If not, choose the HTML format.
 
3. Give the page a different filename if you like; then click Save.
 
 The Web page is saved to your computer.
Opening a Web page in Word
To open a Web page in Word:
 
1. In Word, choose File➪Open.
 
2. Navigate or use Spotlight to select the saved Web page file.
 
 You may have to choose All Files in the Enable pop-up menu to make the 
Web page file usable in Word.
 
3. Click Open.
 
 Word opens the Web page you just saved. The results probably don’t 
look very good, but it’s a handy way to get Web page HTML tables into 
Word.
 
Beginning with Word 2008, you can no longer edit HTML source code in 
Microsoft Word.
Sending Word to the Web
You can still choose File➪Save as Web Page in Word. Although Web page 
designers cringe at Word’s HTML capabilities, Web browsers don’t seem 
to mind it at all, which is really all that matters here. If you have access to 
a Web server, you can move the files Word creates to the server, where 
they can be accessed by others. Note: Word 2008 no longer supports saving 
forms as Web pages.
Managing Multiple Open Documents
Sometimes you might work with several documents open at once; Word has 
some features that can help. The most common way of switching from one

Managing Multiple Open Documents
open document to another is simply to click from one document window 
to another. The document window you click comes to the front. This takes 
some getting used to for people switching to a Mac from a PC, in which you 
commonly use the Windows taskbar for this purpose. To keep Windows 
users from getting homesick on your Macs, you can hold down the mouse 
button on the Word Dock icon to get a pop-up menu that enables you to 
switch from one document to another, as shown in Figure 7-22.
 
Figure 7-22: 
Switching 
documents 
on the Dock.
 
Word’s Window menu (See Figure 7-23) has a similar switching capability as 
well as other features:
 
✦ Arrange All: Arranges open document windows horizontally on your 
screen.
 
✦ Split: Divides the currently open document window into a top and 
bottom half so you can see and work in two portions of the document 
at the same time. Split is a toggle. To remove the Split, choose the Split 
option a second time from the Window menu.
 
✦ List of open documents: At the bottom of the Window menu, you can 
choose from a list of open documents to switch from one document to 
another.
Word 2008 has a fantastic Speak Selection 
feature that allows you to hear documents, 
which is great for proofreading. This feature 
is also good for when you’re so tired that you 
can’t keep your eyes open anymore but you 
still have to read a document. We use this tool 
all the time. Select the text you want to hear 
and then click the Speak Selection button on 
the Speech toolbar (if this toolbar isn’t vis-
ible, choose View➪Toolbars and then choose 
Speech). To make Word stop speaking, click 
the Stop Speaking button on the Speech tool-
bar while Word talks (see Figure 7-24).

Embedding All Kinds of Things
A Word document is a very versatile thing; so versatile that you can actually 
embed other kinds of object types, such as tables and charts, right inside a 
Word document. You can even embed another Word document.
Figure 7-25 displays a list of things you can embed in a Word document, 
as shown in the Object dialog. To access this dialog and insert one of the 
objects, take these steps:
 
1. From an open Word document, choose Insert➪Object.
 
 The Object dialog displays.
 
2. Choose from the following options in the Display as Icon check box:
 
• Checked: If you choose this option, the embedded object appears 
in your document as an icon that can be double-clicked to open the 
embedded object.
 
• Not Checked: The embedded object itself or a preview of the object 
displays in the Word document.
 
3. Select an object type from the Object Type list or click the From File 
button:
 
• Object Type list: Choose one of the types listed to embed it into your 
Word document, which is described in the Result section. Click OK 
to embed the object and close the Object dialog.

Book II

Embedding All Kinds of Things
 
• From File button: Closes the Object dialog and Opens the Insert from 
File dialog where you can navigate or use Spotlight to locate a file 
object to embed into your Word document. Click Insert to embed the 
selected file. You can embed only the kinds of objects that you see 
listed in the Object dialog, as shown in Figure 7-25.
If you choose to open the Insert from File dialog, it has two option buttons:
 
✦ Link to File: Embeds the file path information, and a reference to the 
source document is created. If the source document is renamed, moved, 
or for some other reason, the path changes, the link breaks. If the original 
changes, the changes are reflected whenever the link is accessed.
 
 If you don’t choose this option, a copy of the file is embedded and the 
original is left untouched. If the original changes later, the embedded 
object isn’t updated. Link to File works the same in the Object dialog as 
in the From File dialog.
 
✦ Display as Icon: If you choose this option, the embedded object will 
appear in your document as an icon that can be double-clicked to open 
the embedded object.
 
Figure 7-25: 
Embedding 
objects in 
Word.
 
You might think that having an embedded object in a Word document, 
especially if it’s another Word document, is confusing. If so, click the Display 
as Icon check box (see Figures 7-25 and 7-26) before you click OK. What if 
no icon appears, or the one you thought you inserted is gone? Use a picture 
instead of the default icon; follow these steps:
 
1. Right-click or Control-click the icon (or the blank spot where the icon 
is supposed to be) and from the pop-up menu, choose Format➪Object.
 
 The Format Object dialog appears.

2. If not selected already, in the Format Object dialog, select the Colors 
and Lines tab.

3. In the Fill area, click the Color pop-up menu and choose Fill Effects.
 
 The Fill Effects dialog appears.
 
4. Select the Picture tab and then click the Select Picture button.
 
 The Choose a Picture dialog displays.
 
5. Navigate or use Spotlight to find and then select a nice, small picture 
(JPEG or another format) to use as the icon.
 
6. Click the Insert button.
 
 The chosen picture displays in the Fill Effects dialog.
 
7. Click OK to close the Insert Picture dialog and click OK to close the 
Format Object dialog.
 
 The picture is on the icon placeholder for your embedded object. 
Double-click the picture to activate the embedded object.

Chapter 8: Printing for Posterity
In This Chapter
✓ Setting up Page Setup
✓ Preparing to print
✓ Printing your document just right
P
rinters are just amazing today. Not only do they print all your beautifully 
crafted documents, but some of them scan and fax, too. Yet others can 
show you previews of photos before printing them, and even some even 
work wirelessly without being connected physically to your computer! The 
good news is that whether your printer is a desktop model or a big, fancy 
networked behemoth, your Word documents can come out just the way 
you like.
When it comes to printing, Word and Mac OS X interact with each other to a 
high degree. When Word opens, it checks to see what the default printer is 
and what its capabilities are. When you open or create a document in Word, 
some of the Page Setup options are determined by the default printer’s 
capabilities. The same document may have slightly different page breaks 
when opened on a computer with a different default printer. Some printers 
can print edge-to-edge, but others can’t. Word is smart; it reformats your 
document to the current default printer, which is why a document can look 
a little different from one computer to another.
The choices you’re offered when you print a document depend upon the 
printer’s brand, model, and printer driver version that’s installed. Certain 
options are available only if your printer supports them. These include 
duplex (printing on both sides of a sheet of paper), booklet layout, full bleed 
(edge to edge), collating, paper quality, print quality, and printer ink levels. 
And if all that printer terminology left you bewildered, don’t worry because 
we explain each feature as we encounter them in this chapter.
Also, the figures in this chapter probably don’t match exactly what you see 
when you use your printer. That’s because every printer works with driver 
software to communicate with Mac OS X, and each printer brand thus has 
drivers that show dialogs a little differently. The good news is that all these 
dialogs are populated with options that generally work the same across all 
printers.

Sizing Up Things with Page Setup
To start with, take a look at the screen that comes up when you choose 
File➪Page Setup. A very simple-looking Page Setup dialog (see Figure 8-1) 
appears, and most of the time you’ll use it to choose Portrait or Landscape 
orientation only and then go on your way. But take a closer look at all the 
options, starting from the top.

you have access to the following controls:
 
✦ Settings: A pop-up menu where you can choose from the following:
 
• Microsoft Word: This option takes you to Word’s Margins dialog.
 
• Save as Default: If you choose this option, when you’re done making 
adjustments to all Page Setup’s settings, your saved settings become 
the default for Page Setup.
 
• Page Attributes: Returns you to the default Page Setup dialog (similar 
to Figure 8-1).

✦ Paper Size: See the section, “Choosing a paper size,” later in this chapter.
 
✦ Orientation: Choose portrait or landscape.
 
✦ Scale: You can scale the document by typing a new percentage.
Formatting for a particular printer
Word looks at the Format For setting in the Page Setup dialog (see Figure 8-1) 
and adjusts document formatting according to the chosen printer’s capabilities. 
When you click Format For, a pop-up menu appears where you see a list of 
printers that are currently attached to your computer. If you want your 
documents to be formatted with a specific printer in mind, choose the 
printer from the list of printers in the pop-up menu.
You can set Format For to Any Printer if you want Word to use a standard 
set of formatting options. This is the best option to choose if you plan to 
share your documents with other people who may use other printer brands 
and models. This is also the only choice available if you don’t have a printer 
installed and connected to your computer.
In the same Format For pop-up menu, you can choose the Print & Fax 
preferences option. The Print & Fax dialog, as shown in Figure 8-2, is provided 
by the operating system and your particular printer driver, not Microsoft 
Word (see Figure 8-2), so your Print & Fax preferences may look substantially 
different from ours unless you happen to be using the same printer brand. 
As shown in Figure 8-2, you can open the print queue and check the supply 
levels of the printer.

Choosing a paper size
The Paper Size pop-up menu has a lot to offer to a curious printing aficionado. 
A click of this pop-up menu offers some common size formats. Our printer 
can do borderless printing, but the current selection in Figure 8-3 is for US 
Letter size paper with a border. The Paper Size pop-up menu is nice enough 
to show you the border that will be used by the printer — in this case, .13 inch.
 
Figure 8-3: 
Choosing a 
paper size in 
the pop-up

At the bottom of the Paper Size pop-up menu is the Manage Custom Sizes 
option. This option takes you to the Custom Page Sizes dialog, as shown in 
Figure 8-4, where you can create a custom paper size. Keep in mind that the 
custom paper sizes you create here are available to all applications, not just 
Microsoft Word.

If you have your printer settings adjusted, take an onscreen peek at how 
your document will look on paper.
Displaying a document preview
You might want to see how your document will look before you commit 
to using all that paper. Be green, you know. In an open document in Word, 
choose File➪Print Preview to bring up a preview window with your document 
name as the title (see Figure 8-5). The toolbar buttons in this window allow 
you to see one or more pages at a time, with several different options to 
control the preview size and the number of pages to be viewed at a time.

Previewing multiple pages
When you have a document that’s many pages long, you can click the 
Multiple Pages button on the (Preview) toolbar. While you move the mouse 
cursor, you can increase or decrease the number of rows and columns you 
want to display. As you move the mouse cursor, click the mouse to choose a 
layout. You can also use the Magnifier and One Page buttons to do the 
following:
 
✦ Magnifier: When you click Magnifier, the mouse cursor changes to a 
magnifying glass. Move the mouse cursor over the document body and 
click the mouse to zoom the document larger. Click a second time to 
restore the Multiple Pages arrangement. Magnifier is a toggle switch 
between displaying a single page and a Multiple Pages arrangement.
 
✦ One Page: Switches the onscreen display between Multiple Pages and 
One Page.
Other preview controls
Here are more controls that can help you preview and print your Word 
documents:
 
✦ Zoom: The Zoom control has the standard zoom features you’ve probably 
become accustomed to, but at the bottom of this Zoom control, you find 
three special options:
 
• Page Width: Maximizes the document to fit the window.
 
• Whole Page: Fits the page to the window.
 
• Two Pages: Shows two pages side-by-side.
 
✦ Show/Hide Rulers: Toggles Rulers on and off.
 
✦ Shrink to Fit: Word tries to fit your document to the document (Preview) 
window.
 
✦ Print Preview Full Screen: This toggles Full Screen view on and off.
 
✦ Close: This closes Print Preview and then returns you to the previous 
view.

Getting a few more options
When you want more than a printout with the default of everything, you can 
find more options by choosing File➪Print to bring up the Print dialog, as 
shown in Figure 8-7. You can even find an option here to expose every 
possible printer control. We talk more about that in just a little bit. For now, 
we focus on the default options.

Picking a set of preset printing options
The Presets pop-up menu enables you to choose from several different 
printing presets:
 
✦ Standard: Most of the time, this is the best one to use.
 
✦ Last Used Settings: Might be the one for you if you have some special 
customized presets.
 
✦ List of Customized Presets: If you’ve created customized presets in the 
advanced printing options (see the section, “Seeing all the possible print 
options,” later in this chapter), you can choose one of them.
Printing to PDF
One of the really neat things about having a Mac is that every application 
that can print prints to PDF (Portable Document Format). Word is no 
exception, except that in Word, you can choose File➪Save As and in the 
Format pop-up menu, choose PDF. Unless you need one of the other PDF 
options in the following list, you don’t have to go through Print to make a 
PDF. Here’s a run down on the PDF printing options (see Figure 8-7):
 
✦ Save as PDF: Opens the Save dialog to save your document as PDF.
 
✦ Save as PostScript: Opens the Save dialog to save your document as a 
.ps postscript file. A PostScript printer is needed to print the file.
 
✦ Fax PDF: Opens the Print dialog to a Mac OS X Fax cover sheet. If your 
Mac has a dialup modem, you can use this option to fax your file.
 
✦ Mail PDF: Opens an e-mail message in Apple Mail, not Microsoft 
Entourage, and adds the PDF as an attachment.
 
✦ Save as PDF-X: This option flattens transparency and reduces colors to 
CYMK.
 
✦ Save PDF to iPhoto: Creates a PDF and sends the PDF to iPhoto.
 
✦ Save PDF to Web Receipts Folder: Creates a PDF and puts it into your 
Web Receipts folder.
 
✦ Edit Menu: Allows you to add custom PDF workflows. Click the Help 
button in the Print dialog for more details.

Previewing in Mac OS X Preview
The Print dialog is standard for all applications that can print. Mac OS X 
offers a preview of your document when you click the Preview button. If you 
want to use Word’s fancy preview instead, which we describe earlier in this 
chapter, choose File➪Print Preview.
Activating advanced printing options
In the Print dialog, click the Advanced Options downward-pointing triangle 
to the right of the Printer pop-up menu to display the complete Print dialog, 
as shown in Figure 8-7. We talk about this dialog in the following section.
Seeing all the possible print options
When you click the Advanced Options button (refer to Figure 8-7), watch as 
the Print dialog grows and metamorphoses to offer a variety of new options 
from which to choose, as shown in Figure 8-8. Printer, Presets, Preview, and 
PDF options, which we describe in the previous sections, are the same in 
advanced options.

Using Copies & Pages
When you open the advanced options, Copies & Pages is the default dialog. 
Notice in Figure 8-8, you can choose how many pages to print and which 
pages (or range of pages) to print.
An optional Quick Preview with forward and backward arrows is on the left 
to help you find specific pages in your document. Quick Preview can slow 
the Print dialog a bit, so you can turn off Quick Preview (just deselect the 
Show Quick Preview check box). You don’t have to wait for Quick Preview to 
finish working before you click the Print button.
Using special Microsoft Word printing options
When you click the Copies & Pages pop-up menu in the advanced options 
dialog, you find a special Microsoft Word option. When you choose this 
option, which results in the dialog shown in Figure 8-9, you’re offered a 
variety of specific printing options that you might need. For example, if your 
printer can’t print on both sides of the paper at once (duplex printing), you 
can print all the odd pages, turn the paper over, and run it through a second 
time to print all the even pages.

When you click the Word Options button (refer to Figure 8-9), a Print 
preferences dialog (as shown in Figure 8-11) appears, where you can choose 
from a variety of specific printing options. The Reverse Print Order check 
box is a popular choice. Many printers print the first page so that it’s on the 
bottom of the pile when you’re done. This feature tells Word to print the last 
page first and so on so that when you’re done printing, page one is on top of 
the page pile.

Using special printer features
When you click the Copies & Pages pop-up menu, all the options below 
Microsoft Word in the menu are tailored to the brand and model printer 
that you choose (see Figure 8-12). The options available depend upon what 
capabilities your printer has and upon the skill of the folks who wrote the 
printer driver. We’re not going to cover each feature, but we’re going to 
point out some things most Word users want to know about:

✦ Layout: Here you might find the duplex printing option if your printer 
supports this. Our printer doesn’t, so the Two-Sided pop-up menu is 
grayed out (see Figure 8-13). Some printer drivers put duplex printing in 
its own Copies & Pages pop-up menu item instead of using Layout.

✦ Paper Handling: You probably don’t need to adjust this one. You can 
use this feature to choose reverse print order instead of using Word’s 
preferences.
 
✦ Cover Page: This adds a cover page to your document. You might 
choose this option if more than one person is sharing a printer (see 
Figure 8-14). The cover page from this Print option isn’t part of the 
document; it’s in addition to the document and doesn’t affect Word’s 
page count. This option isn’t the same as adding a cover page with 
Elements Gallery in Word, in which the cover page becomes part of the 
Word document.

✦ Scheduler: If you want to schedule your document to print at a certain 
time or put your print job on hold, choose this option.
 
✦ Print Settings: This dialog offers many choices. Choose a paper type, 
speed, and quality of the print job. For a quick draft, adjust the settings, 
as shown in Figure 8-15. Lately, some printers default to speed over 
quality. If you find that some things in your documents aren’t printing 
right, you probably need to raise the quality setting. Your printer may 
have other options here.

E
xcel 2008 has an entirely new kind of worksheet — a ledger sheet — 
which makes using spreadsheets fill-in-the-blank simple. Ledger sheets 
allow you to successfully accomplish every day tasks, such as budgeting, 
keeping track of your checkbook balance, tracking vehicle maintenance, 
recording stock portfolios, drafting expense reports, and more. In this 
chapter, we show you how you can use ledger sheets efficiently.
After you get your feet wet with ledger sheets, we talk about opening and saving 
Excel specialty file formats, and how to recover if Excel or Mac OS X crashes. 
Then, we reveal Excel’s new interface, and how to use the Formatting Palette to 
alter print setup and control Page Layout View. Along the way, we explain how 
to customize keyboard shortcuts in Excel. Finally, we explain how to work with 
different sheet types and reveal Excel’s special Project Gallery.
This minibook covers features unique to Excel. We talk about general 
Microsoft Office features — such as opening and saving files, using Project 
Gallery, and working with common interface components, including the new 
Elements Gallery, Toolbox, and palettes — in Book I.
Introducing Ledger Sheets
Ledger sheets are designed specifically to help you figure out Excel’s interface 
and features while you work in a simplified environment. Even if you’re an old 
hand at Excel, ledger sheets may be useful timesavers and organizers.
In our ledger sheet discussion, we use a Budget example, so you can open 
the same template we’re using and follow along. The following sections 
don’t really discuss budgets or budgeting — they’re all about ledger sheets. 
And all ledger sheets work in the same basic way.

358
Introducing Ledger Sheets
Opening a ledger sheet
You can use ledger sheets so simply; you just need to open one from the 
built-in collection of ledger sheets and start filling it in. You can find ledger 
sheets in Project Gallery and Elements Gallery. In our example, we open our 
ledger sheet from Project Gallery. Figure 1-1 shows the open ledger sheet.

ledger sheet

Scroll bar

To open an Excel ledger sheet, follow these steps:
 
1. If Excel is closed, click the Excel icon in your Dock to open it.
 
 If Excel opens Project Gallery, you’re where you’re supposed to be! If 
Excel opens directly to a spreadsheet, choose File➪Project Gallery.
 
 Either way, you get to the Project Gallery (see Figure 1-1).
 
2. In Project Gallery, click the New tab if it’s not selected already.
 
3. In the Category list, click Ledger Sheets.
 
 A pop-up menu of built-in ledger sheets appears. This is a good oppor-
tunity to select each category. When you select a category, the ledger 
sheet templates in that category appear to the right of the list. You may 
have to drag the scroll bar to see all the subcategories.
 
4. Double-click a ledger sheet template to open it in Excel.
 
 The ledger sheet opens, as shown in Figure 1-2; to follow our example, 
select the Budgets subcategory and then double-click Home Budget.

Ledger sheet
Ledger sheets were designed so that after you open one, you only have to 
fill in the blanks with your own data. And you don’t have a Formula Bar to 
worry about. (You can read more about the Formula Bar in Chapter 2 of this 
minibook.) Plus, you don’t have to deal with any row numbers or column 
labels, and the formulas are invisible!
 
List sheets are new to Excel in 2008. They’re Mac-first and Mac-only. Well, not 
so Mac-only that you can’t share ledger sheets with Windows users. Excel 
for Windows can work with your ledger sheets but can’t make them from 
scratch. When you work with other sheet types, the new Elements Gallery’s 
Sheets tab offers the same ledger sheets that you can find in Project Gallery 
(see Figure 1-1). The Formatting Palette has a new section just for ledger 
sheets.

Introducing Ledger Sheets
Entering text and data
 
The key to working with ledger sheets is to double-click. Double-click to edit 
a cell, a header, or a footer. Click outside a cell, or double-click outside a 
header or footer, when you’re done editing.
You can work with Excel’s interface in special ways when you’re using a 
ledger sheet. See Figure 1-3, which shows these interface elements:
 
Figure 1-3: 
Clicking 
disclosure 
triangles 
in ledger 
sheets.
 
 
✦ Column header: At the top of each column, a word or phrase describes 
the kind of entries you should put into the column. These descriptions 
are sometimes called field names. In the example in Figure 1-3, the 
column header is Category.
 
✦ AutoFilter: Click the AutoFilter disclosure triangle to display a pop-up 
menu of AutoFilter choices. Use this option to filter your column. We talk 
about the AutoFilter buttons in Chapter 7 of this minibook.
 
✦ Cell entries: Entries that you make to cells appear in rows and columns.
 
✦ Row drag handles: While you work in a row, drag handles appear on the 
left and right side of the row. You can see them up close in Figure 1-3.
 
✦ Pop-up menu disclosure triangle: When you type in some cells, a disclo-
sure triangle appears on the right side of the cell. Click that little triangle 
to see the cell entry pop-up menu. You can select from this menu, as 
shown in Figure 1-4, so that you don’t have to type.
 
✦ Selected cell: The cell you’re working in. It has a different border from all 
the rest to indicate that it’s currently active and selected. See Figure 1-4.

Working with Other File Formats
Of course, you’re not limited to the choices in the cell entry pop-up menu. If 
you want something different, type what you want in cells that display dis-
closure triangles. Excel notices when you type something that isn’t on the 
list and politely asks whether you want to add your new entry to the list so 
that you can use it again.
 
After you type in content in several rows into your ledger sheet, you might 
want to move a row up or down on the sheet. When you click into a row 
that’s already filled in, a row drag handle appears in the margin, as shown in 
Figure 1-3 and Figure 1-4. You can drag the handle up or down in the list, and 
the entire row that’s highlighted moves. Not only that, but when you release 
the handle, hidden formulas automatically adjust to the row’s new location 
and then recalculate.
Working with Other File Formats
You expect Excel to open Excel files, of course, but the program can do more 
than that. You can actually open, work on, and save a file in several formats. 
Choose File➪Save As and then click Format to open the pop-up menu. Excel 
can both open and save in the formats listed in the pop-up menu.
 
Excel keeps your file in the format it has when you open it. For example, if you 
open an Excel binary workbook (.xlsb), it opens normally, and you can work 
on it. When you save the workbook, the format remains Excel binary workbook 
(.xlsb) unless you intentionally change the format by choosing File➪Save As 
and then selecting a different format from the Format pop-up menu.
Default format
The Excel Workbook (.xlsx) format is the default XML format for Excel 
2008 spreadsheets. Although Excel can work with a plethora of file formats, 
this format preserves all aspects of your workbook. Use this file format if 
you need to comply with open source standards requirements.
Common formats
You have several options for file formats besides Excel’s default XLSX 
format:
 
✦ Excel 97–2004 Workbook (.xls): Save in a format usable by these ear-
lier versions of Excel. Saving in this format doesn’t preserve full fidelity 
(particularly charts).
 
✦ Excel Template (.xltx): Save the workbook as a template. See Book I, 
Chapter 2 for details about saving and opening templates.
 
✦ Excel 97—2004 Template (.xlt): Save a template in a format usable by 
these earlier versions of Excel. You can’t preserve full fidelity (particu-
larly charts) with this format.

362
Working with Other File Formats
 
✦ Comma Separated Values (.csv): See the section, “Delimited,” later in 
this chapter.
 
✦ Web Page (.htm): Save the workbook in a format that Web browsers 
understand and can display. Excel creates a file in HTML format, along 
with a supporting folder. Upload both the file and folder to a Web server 
if you want to share your workbook via the Internet.
 
 Excel can open and save Web pages in HTML (HyperText Markup 
Language) format and do great things with Web tables and data from the 
Web, but don’t throw away your HTML (Web page) code editor. Excel 
isn’t going to replace that.
Specialty formats
Apart from the Excel formats that are typically used the most, you have sev-
eral other file formats to consider.
XML
XML (eXtensible Markup Language) are plain text files that have been 
zipped. You can decompress, and then read and edit by hand, files in these 
formats if you know how to program in this computer markup language:
 
✦ Excel Macro-Enabled Workbook (.xlsm): Workbooks in this XML 
format contain Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) programming lan-
guage code, also called macros or macrocode. Excel 2008 can open 
and save files in this format. When opening this format file, Excel 2008 
displays a prompt asking whether you want to remove the macros con-
tained in the file.
 
 We advise against removing the code because it doesn’t hurt anything —
and removing it can potentially cause great harm. Because Excel 2008 
doesn’t support VBA, macros can’t run and you can’t edit them. But by 
working in the XLSM format, you can, however, use non-VBA aspects of 
an XLSM workbook.
 
✦ Excel Macro-Enabled Template (.xltm): The same as XLSM, except this 
is a template. See Book I, Chapter 2 for details about saving and opening 
templates.
 
✦ Excel 2004 XML Spreadsheet (.xml): Excel 2004 and Excel 2008 can 
use this XML format. Excel 2008 can’t preserve full fidelity (particularly 
charts) when you share files between Excel 2008 and Excel 2004.
 
✦ Excel Add-In (.xlam): Save a macro-enabled workbook as an Excel add-in. 
Excel 2008 can’t run add-ins, and the macros would have to be pre-existing.
 
Because these files are text, even though they’re compressed (zipped), they 
can be many times larger than when saved in binary format.

Book III
Chapter 1
Working Every 
Day in Excel
363
Working with Other File Formats
Binary
Instead of saving the computer code as words in text, Excel’s binary formats 
save it in zeros and ones, known as binary numbers. Using binary numbers, 
rather than text, results in smaller file sizes that open and save quickly (but 
most humans can’t read binary format):
 
✦ Excel Binary Workbook (.xlsb): This new binary format solves the 
bloat problem created by the new XML (.xlsx) text format by avoiding 
XML and text altogether. Files saved in XLSB format typically open and 
save faster, and are usually smaller, than XLSX files.
 
 This file format doesn’t comply with open source standards.
 
✦ Excel 97–2004 Add-In (.xla): Save a macro-enabled workbook as an 
Excel add-in for these earlier versions of Excel. Excel 2008 can’t run add-
ins, and the macros would have to be pre-existing.
Delimited
In this format type, data arranged in tables with rows and columns is saved 
in text files that use a specified character, called a delimiter, to indicate the 
beginning of a new column. People have mostly settled on using a comma as 
the delimiting character, and Comma Separated Value (CSV) is a popular file 
format. However, other delimited file formats can specify any character:
 
✦ Tab Delimited Text (.txt): Save row and column headers, and data, in 
a text file that uses the Tab character as its delimiter. This format saves 
only the text within cells.
 
✦ Windows Comma Separated (.csv): Save row and column headers, and 
data, in a text file that uses the comma character as its delimiter in a 
format that’s slightly different from standard CSV.
 
✦ MS-DOS Comma Separated (.csv): Save row and column headers, and 
data, in a text file that uses the comma character as its delimiter in a 
format that’s slightly different from standard CSV.
 
✦ Space Delimited Text (.prn): Save only the text within cells using a text 
file format for old dot-matrix and line printers.
 
Excel can deal with any delimiter, as long as you tell it which delimiter was 
used in the preparation of your delimited file.
Old formats
Excel still offers these formats, but it may not for long. If you have any of 
these files, save them in one of the current formats in case Excel stops sup-
porting these formats:

364
Saving Your Workbook
 
✦ Data Interchange Format (.dif): Save row and column headers, along 
with data, in a format designed specifically for data.
 
 This format often works better than delimited formats because it’s not 
fussy about which characters are in the data.
 
✦ Symbolic Link (.slk): Use this old Microsoft-specific format to 
exchange data. It requires special handling of semicolons.
 
✦ Excel 5.0/95 Workbook (.xls): An old Excel-specific workbook format.
All the other formats
Here are the additional file formats you have to choose from:
 
✦ Single File Web Page (.mht): Save the workbook as a single-file Web 
page that you can upload to a Web server for distribution via the 
Internet and view in a Web browser.
 
✦ UTF-16 Unicode Text (.txt): Save only the text within cells using the 
UTF-16 standard.
 
✦ Windows Formatted Text (.txt): Save only the text within cells using 
Windows text file format.
 
✦ MS-DOS Formatted Text (.txt): Save only the text within cells using 
MS-DOS text file format.
Saving Your Workbook
 
 The fastest way to save in the west is to click the Save button on the Excel 
Standard toolbar, especially if you’re working on a workbook that’s already 
been saved at least once. Although that method is quick and easy, and we 
encourage you to save often while you work, that’s not the only way to save 
a workbook.
Saving for compatibility (.xls)
Be thoughtful of those who aren’t using Office 2008 for Mac or Office 2007 for 
Windows. If you think someone may need to work in an older format, choose 
File➪Save As and then choose one of the older file formats, such as Excel 
97–2004 Workbook (.xls).
 
Be sure to click the Compatibility Report button to see what Excel might lose 
or modify when you save to an older file format.
Saving in Excel Workbook (.xlsx)
 
We know a lot of Excel types want to get deep into the blood and guts of 
these files, but this might not interest you unless you’re super geeky. Excel 
XML files aren’t really files; they’re zipped folders that contain XML files and 
even more folders.

Book III
Chapter 1
Working Every 
Day in Excel
365
Saving Your Workbook
To get into the actual XML files, do the following:
 
1. In Finder, right-click a saved XLSX file and choose Duplicate from the 
pop-up menu that appears.
 
 This makes a copy of the file so that you don’t alter the original.
 
2. Change the file extension in Finder from .xlsx to .zip.
 
3. Right-click or Control-click the Zip file.
 
4. From the pop-up menu that appears, choose Open With and then 
choose Archive Utility.
 
 A file folder appears, containing your document’s XML files and addi-
tional folders.
There you go! You can open and edit XML files in Microsoft Word or any text 
or XML editor. If you know how to program with XML, everything about your 
document is now at your fingertips.
Saving small using Excel binary workbook (.xlsb)
From an efficiency point of view, Excel’s new default XML file format isn’t a 
good way to save computer files. XML is text, and text files become huge and 
bloated very quickly. Zipping and unzipping XML text files adds overhead 
and takes time. Even though XLSX files are zipped and unzipped automati-
cally for you, they’re usually much larger than when you save them in Excel 
binary workbook (.xlsb) file format.
 
Always saving in Excel binary workbook (.xlsb) format will usually result in 
much smaller files. After you save in Excel binary workbook (.xlsb) format, 
you can always choose File➪Save As and then choose Excel workbook (.
xlsx) from the Format pop-up if you want to fiddle with the XML code.
You can even make saving in Excel binary workbook (.xlsb) the default for 
Excel so that you always save in the most efficient file format. Follow these 
steps:
 
1. In Excel, choose Excel➪Preferences.
 
 The Excel Preferences dialog appears.
 
 2. Click the Compatibility icon.
 
 
 Compatibility preferences appear.
 
3. Click Save Files in This Format in the Transition area and choose 
Excel Binary Workbook (.xlsb) from the pop-up menu that appears.
 
4. Click OK to close Compatibility and save your preference.

366
Saving Your Workbook
Saving with AutoRecover
Excel 2008 has been out long enough so that crashes are minimal. Just the 
same, a crash is possible.
Setting up AutoRecover
Take a moment to make sure your preferences automatically save an emer-
gency backup file of your work. To set up AutoRecover, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Excel➪Preferences.
 
 The Excel Preferences dialog appears.
 
 2. In the Sharing and Privacy section, select Save.
 
 
 The Save preferences appear.
 
3. Select the Save AutoRecover Information After This Number of 
Minutes check box.
 
4. Enter the number of minutes that you want between AutoRecover file 
saves, or use the increase/decrease control.
 
5. Click OK to close Save and save your preferences.
 
 After you turn on AutoRecover, Excel saves your work at the specified 
interval so that you can recover in the event that the system or Excel 
crashes.
Retrieving AutoRecover
If your computer or Excel crashes, you can recover your work up to the 
most recent AutoRecover save, but only if you turned on AutoRecover saves 
(see the preceding section). Take these steps to restore any workbooks that 
were open at the time of the crash:
 
1. Click the Excel Dock icon.
 
 Excel presents any documents that you’re working on that have been 
saved at least once. Recovered documents have (Recovered) in the 
title bar.
 
2. To keep the recovered version, choose File➪Save As.
 
 The Save As dialog appears. Take one of the following actions:
 
• To replace the existing file with the recovered version: Navigate to the 
file or use Spotlight to locate the existing file. Then, click the file-
name to change the recovered file’s name to the existing filename. 
Click Save to overwrite the existing file.
 
• To save the recovered file without overwriting the original: Select a 
location to save the recovered file and enter a name for the file in the 
text box. Then, click Save.

To permanently remove AutoRecover files from your computer, follow these 
steps:
 
1. Quit all open Office applications.
 
2. In Finder, press Ô-F.
 
 The Spotlight search dialog appears.
 
3. Enter AutoRecover in the text box.
 
 Spotlight displays a list of matching files, if any.
 
4. Select all AutoRecover files.
 
5. Drag the files to the Trash.
 
6. Empty the Trash.
Viewing Workbooks
A workbook is a container for a collection of sheets. A standard worksheet 
is a grid composed of cells arranged in columns and rows, but you can use 
other kinds of sheets, which we discuss in the section, “Working with Sheet 
Types,” later in this chapter.
When you’re working in Excel, you have your choice of one of two views: 
Page Layout View and Normal View. We discuss these views in the following 
sections.
If you’re an Excel veteran but new to Excel 2008, Page Layout View is now 
the default view. Because you can use the Formatting Palette to do almost 
everything in Page Layout View that you did before in Page Break Preview, 
Excel no longer has Page Break Preview.
 
You can find general interface discussion about menus, toolbars, the Dock, 
Elements Gallery, and the Formatting Palette in Book I, as well as how to 
open and save files.
Using Page Layout View
Page Layout View displays your workbook so that you can see how it will 
look when you print it. Page breaks are clearly visible in this view, and Page 
Setup controls on the Formatting Palette help you see changes live while you 
make them.

368
Viewing Workbooks
To see Excel’s interface in Page Layout View, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Excel icon in your Dock to open Excel.
 
 If Excel opens directly to a worksheet, you’re where you’re supposed 
to be.
 
2. If Excel opens Project Gallery, click Open.
 
 A new workbook opens in Page Layout View, displaying a blank standard 
worksheet, as shown in Figure 1-5.
 
 If you already have Excel open, click the New button on the Standard toolbar 
to open a new workbook, displaying a blank, standard worksheet, as shown 
in Figure 1-5.
In the interface in Figure 1-5, one sheet is brighter than the rest, and the page 
breaks look like physical breaks. Any sheet that has content appears bright, 
and sheets that contain no content are slightly grayed and display Click to 
Add Data. In this view, you can easily see whether text or other objects will 
be cut off or spill over breaks when you print the sheet.

Figure 1-5 also shows these features of the Page Layout View interface:
 
✦ Ruler: Choose View➪Ruler to toggle the rulers off and on. You can drag 
rulers to resize margins. Double-click a ruler to display the Page Setup 
dialog, which we discuss in Chapter 8 in this minibook.
 
✦ Header and footer: Double-click the white space above and below the 
sheets to display header and footer controls, which we also talk about in 
Chapter 8 of this minibook.
 
✦ View buttons: Click the two buttons at the lower-left corner of the 
window to switch between Normal View and Page Layout View. The Page 
Layout View button is selected in Figure 1-5.
 
✦ Page indicator: As soon as you enter any data into a cell or add an 
object to a sheet, the page indicator updates.
Using Normal View
Experienced number crunchers and bean counters will probably prefer the tradi-
tional Normal View, as shown in Figure 1-6. Normal View is similar to Page Layout 
View, except the entire sheet is continuous. Instead of seeing distinct visual dif-
ferentiation between pages, you see dotted lines after you select any Page Setup 
or Print function. Normal View maximizes the amount of worksheet that you 
see on the screen. You can switch to Normal View by clicking the Normal View 
button in the lower-left corner of the window or by choosing View➪Normal.
Using the common interface
Whether you prefer to work in Page Layout View or Normal View, most inter-
face components are the same in both views. We highlight these common 
features in Figure 1-6:
 
✦ Standard toolbar: The Standard toolbar is now part of the document 
window in Excel 2008, a new location.
 
✦ Elements Gallery: Elements Gallery is new to Excel 2008. The Sheets tab 
(which we discuss in the section, “Making specific sheet types,” later in 
this chapter) is unique to Excel.
 
✦ Worksheet: Figure 1-6 shows a standard Excel worksheet, where you can 
enter text and formulas, perform calculations, and store data.
 
✦ View buttons: Click these buttons to switch between Page Layout View 
and Normal View.
 
✦ Sheet tab: Each sheet in a workbook has a name that appears on its 
tab near the bottom of the window. Double-click a sheet tab to edit that 
sheet’s name.
 
✦ + (Add Sheet): Click the plus sign to add a new, blank standard work-
sheet to your workbook. You can add as many worksheets as you want 
until your computer runs out of memory. You could potentially add 
thousands of them!

to a cell or a selected range of cells so that you can refer to that range in 
cell formulas.
 
 Select the cell(s) you want to name, type a name for the range, and then 
press Return or Enter to register that name in the workbook. After you 
assign a name to a cell or cell range, you can type its name into the 
Range tool and then press Return or Enter to select the range.

are, search Excel’s Help for the Specifications and Limits for Excel 2008 topic. 
You can find such information as how many characters fit into one cell or how 
many nested levels you can have in a function.
Like other Office applications, you can find context-sensitive pop-up menus 
just about everywhere you right-click or Control-click in Excel.
Using the Formatting Palette
When working in Page Layout View or Normal View, you can access the Page 
Setup portion of the Toolbox’s Formatting Palette. Follow these steps to open 
the Page Setup portion of the Formatting Palette, as shown in Figure 1-7:
 
 1. If the Toolbox isn’t visible, click the Toolbox button on Excel’s 
Standard toolbar.
 
 The Toolbox appears.
 
2. In the Toolbox, select Formatting Palette.
 
 The Formatting Palette appears.
 
3. Click the disclosure triangle for Page Setup.
 
 Page Setup options appear, as shown in Figure 1-7.
Getting the perfect interface
Book I, Chapter 3 discusses how to customize 
Excel’s menus and toolbars. Excel has its own 
keyboard shortcuts and shortcut organizer. The 
complete list of built-in keyboard shortcuts is 
in Excel Help; search for the Excel Keyboard 
Shortcuts topic to find the list.
To get to the Keyboard Shortcut dialog, choose 
Tools➪Customize Keyboard. The shortcut orga-
nizer is another way to discover Excel’s built-
in shortcuts, as well as a way to change, add, 
or remove your own keyboard shortcuts. You 
aren’t allowed to delete Excel’s built-in short-
cuts. Remember that if Mac OS X is already 
using a particular keyboard shortcut, Excel 
can’t use it.
The ability to customize Excel keyboard short-
cuts is Mac-only — Excel for Windows doesn’t 
have this feature.

We describe using the Page Setup options, located on the Formatting Palette, 
in Chapter 8 of this minibook. When you have these options available instantly 
on the Formatting Palette, you can see your choices implemented live while 
you make them in Page Layout View.
Orientation
To change the orientation of your worksheet, you can select an Orientation 
button:
 
✦ Landscape: Display and print your sheet so that it’s wider than it is tall.
 
✦ Portrait: Display and print your sheet so that it’s taller than it is wide.
The page breaks change instantly in Page Layout View when you click either 
the Landscape or Portrait button in the Formatting Palette.
Print scaling
Below the Orientation options on the Formatting Palette, the Print Scaling 
options deserve some attention:
 
✦ Print Scaling: If your spreadsheet spills a little bit onto an adjacent 
page, select the Fit To check box in the Print Scaling section. Excel auto-
matically adjusts page breaks for you by scaling your worksheet.
 
✦ Adjust to [%] Normal Size: Type a percentage value in this field or click 
the increase/decrease controls to increase or decrease the amount of 
scaling that you want to apply to the worksheet.
 
 This option isn’t the zoom control, which you can find on Excel’s 
Standard toolbar.

Working with Sheet Types
Excel sheets can be general or dedicated to a specific purpose. You don’t 
have to be an expert to use the various sheet types, but you should know 
their names and each sheet type’s purpose.
 
You can mix different sheet types within a single workbook.
Sheet types
Here’s the rundown of the kinds of specialized sheets that are available in 
Excel:
 
✦ Ledger sheets: We discuss ledger sheets in the section, “Introducing 
Ledger Sheets,” earlier in this chapter.
 
✦ Blank sheet: This general-purpose worksheet has cells, rows, and col-
umns; the cells can hold text, formulas, and data. You can place objects 
such as charts, WordArt, SmartArt graphics, objects from the Object 
Palette, pictures, sounds, and even movies in layers on worksheets. 
Most people are familiar with this traditional worksheet.
 
✦ List sheets: These sheets are pure gold! List sheets are one of the most 
useful kinds of sheets for working with data tables and lists of all kinds. 
We talk a lot about list sheets in Chapter 7 of this minibook.

374
Working with Sheet Types
 
✦ Chart sheets: A chart sheet contains a single graph or chart. We discuss 
charts in Chapter 5 of this minibook.
 
✦ Excel 4.0 macro sheet: Before VBA (Visual Basic for Applications), 
there was the Excel 4.0 XLM macro language. If you work in this format, 
Excel 2008 supports the Excel 4.0 macro language. If this applies to 
you, search Excel Help for Excel 4 and then download the entire Excel 
4.0 Macro Language Reference; click the Download link in the Excel 4.0 
(XLM) Macro Commands topic.
 
✦ Excel 5.0 dialog sheet: VBA doesn’t work in Excel 2008, so Excel must 
have retained this sheet type just in case VBA returns to Office for Mac, 
which Microsoft says will happen in the next major release.
Making specific sheet types
You don’t follow the same procedure when you create each of the various 
sheet types.
 
You can easily create a worksheet by selecting which type of worksheet you 
want to open when you open a new workbook.
In addition to the regular Office Project Gallery described in Book I, Chapter 2, 
Excel has a special Project Gallery (see Figure 1-1) that you can use to create 
new, blank sheets of specific sheet types after you open a workbook. We 
describe how to use this gallery in the section, “Using Excel’s special Project 
Gallery,” later in this chapter.
Making a standard worksheet
You have several ways to create a new worksheet:
 
✦ Choose File➪Project Gallery. When Project Gallery appears, click Open 
or Cancel.
 
✦ Choose File➪New.
 
✦ Click the New button on Excel’s Standard toolbar.
 
✦ If Excel isn’t open, click the Excel Dock icon (or use one of the more than 
18 different ways to open an application in Mac OS X).
 
✦ Click Ô-N from within Excel.
 
✦ Right-click or Control-click any sheet tab. From the resulting pop-up 
menu, select Insert. In the Excel Project Gallery (see Figure 1-1) that 
appears, double-click Blank Sheet.
 
✦ Click the plus sign (+) to add a new, blank standard worksheet to your 
workbook (as shown in Figure 1-6).
 
✦ On the Sheets tab of the Elements Gallery, click the Blank Sheets button 
and then choose Blank Sheet.

Making a list sheet
Here’s a few ways to make a sheet list:
 
✦ Choose File➪Project Gallery. Project Gallery appears. Double-click List 
Wizard.
 
✦ On the Sheets tab of Elements Gallery, click the Blank Sheets button and 
then select List Sheet.
 
✦ Right-click or Control-click any sheet tab. From the resulting pop-up 
menu, select Insert. In the Excel special Project Gallery that appears, 
double-click List Sheet.
We talk about additional methods of creating list sheets and how to use 
them in Chapter 7 of this minibook.
Making a chart sheet
Here are the two ways to create a chart sheet:
 
✦ Make an Excel chart; then move the chart to a chart sheet, as we explain 
in Chapter 5 of this minibook.
 
✦ Select the data range for your chart. Then, right-click or Control-click the 
sheet’s tab. From the resulting pop-up menu, select Insert. In the Excel 
special Project Gallery that appears, double-click Chart Sheet.
Making an Excel 4.0 macro sheet
To make an Excel 4.0 macro sheet, right-click or Control-click any sheet tab. 
From the resulting pop-up menu, select Insert. In the Excel special Project 
Gallery that appears, double-click Excel 4.0 Macro Sheet.
 
Note that while you can create Excel 5.0 dialog sheets, these sheets are use-
less in Excel 2008. Don’t bother. Wait ’til the next version.
Using Excel’s special Project Gallery
Excel has Project Gallery inside each workbook. Project Gallery even has 
hidden features that work only in Excel. To expose the hidden Excel special 
Project Gallery, right-click or Control-click any sheet tab, and then select 
Insert from the resulting pop-up menu.
The Excel special Project Gallery dialog opens. In this special version of 
Project Gallery, everything is just for Excel. In the Category list on the left, 
only Excel content categories are displayed. Even in My Templates, only 
your Excel templates are available. The other tabs of Project Gallery are 
inactive.

376
Working with Sheet Types
When you access the Excel special Project Gallery, the Blank Documents cat-
egory is selected by default. When Blank Documents is selected, the docu-
ment templates that appear to the right of the Category list don’t open new 
workbooks. Instead, selecting one of the templates adds a new sheet of the 
chosen type to the active workbook. This aspect of the Excel special Project 
Gallery is different from the regular Office Project Gallery. The Excel special 
Project Gallery can add any one of the following sheet types to the active 
workbook (we describe sheet types in the earlier sections):
 
✦ Standard worksheet
 
✦ Chart sheet
 
✦ List sheet
 
✦ Excel 4.0 macro sheet
 
✦ Excel 5.0 dialog sheet
Meet MacBU’s Gavin Shearer
Gavin Shearer is a Program Manager with 
Macintosh Business Unit (MacBU). He was 
kind enough to allow the authors to put a few 
questions to him.
Do you get razzed by the Windows Office 
team?
Gavin: You know, we don’t. At all. If anything, they 
bend over backward to help us out. Back in the 
mists of time (before the creation of our present-
day Macintosh Business Unit), Mac software 
was developed inside the overall Office organiza-
tion, which also produced the Windows versions 
of our applications. A lot of the folks who work in 
MacBU have history with the Windows side of 
the house.
A huge part of my job is making sure that a Mac 
user can get a file created in Windows Office, 
double-click it, and have it “just work” on the 
Mac. That means we have to know what those 
teams are building, how it works, and make a plan 
to bring it to the Mac. I personally meet with the 
Windows Excel team on a weekly basis; if they 
weren’t supportive of our efforts, my job would be 
exponentially harder, if not flat-out impossible.
What’s Bill Gates really like?
Gavin: You know, I get asked this question a lot — 
way more than I ever would have thought 
possible before I joined the company. Bill’s the 
founder, the chairman, the (former) richest man 
in the world . . . and for some reason, when-
ever I’m on airplane, once the person next to 
me finds out I work for Microsoft, they assume 
that Bill and I must be close friends. Amazing.
As it happens, I do have a “Bill” story: I’ve been 
to his house. I interned at Microsoft during the 
summer of 2004, and as a reward (and a way of 
wooing interns), the company threw a big BBQ 
at Bill’s place on the shores of Lake Washington. 
In addition to being the absolute, no question, 
#1-with-a-bullet, best-catered barbecue I’ve 
ever attended, it was also a ton of fun. The com-
pany has a few hundred interns in any given 
summer, which meant there were quite a lot of 
us in Bill’s backyard, munching on chicken and 
carrot sticks. Eventually, Bill came out to meet 
us and wound up with a ring of people around 
him, three or four bodies deep. He took ques-
tions, was very friendly, and basically ignored 
that we were trashing his lawn. Nice guy.

What’s your favorite Mac thing?
Gavin: So I’ve been a Mac user for two solid 
decades now. I started using ’em in 1989, and 
bought my first machine — an SE/30 — when 
I went off to college in 1990. In the interven-
ing years, I’ve used a ton of different systems: 
Windows, of course, but also various flavors of 
Unix, OS/2, even a Be. What’s kept me on the 
Mac is that, generally speaking, the Mac (and 
Mac applications) works consistently, reliably, 
and the way I expect it to. In practical terms, it 
means I can get more done in less time, and my 
learning curve for new things is flatter. There’s 
a thrill, a little electric “aha!” that I get some-
times with good Mac software. It may be the 
way I’m wired (I have plenty of friends who feel 
the same way about their PCs that I do about 
my Mac), but it doesn’t really matter — the Mac 
just feels good. (I guess I’m addicted.)
What’s the hardest part of making Office?
Gavin: Making tradeoffs. People have this 
impression of Microsoft being this fabulously 
wealthy, resource-rich company, which means 
they also assume we have the ability to throw 
an infinite number of smart people at any given 
problem, product, or bug. It’s just not true — 
honestly, we don’t have Scrooge McDuck’s 
vault somewhere here on campus.
We have about 200 people working for MacBU. 
That’s everyone — our developers, testers, mar-
keting people, finance people, Web site people, 
writers, people-managers, you name it. The 
Windows Office team, on the other hand, employs 
a lot more folks (which makes sense given the rel-
ative market shares of Windows versus the Mac). 
As a practical matter, this means the Windows 
team can do a lot more in a given release than 
we can, and we can’t do everything they do. 
Thus, we have to be incredibly careful and smart 
about picking our bets, and also be sure that the 
things we’re doing are the right thing for our cus-
tomers. We’re forever having to stack-rank and 
trade off Thing A against Thing B, and keep our 
eye focused on shipping something our custom-
ers will want to buy. There’s a lot of good in this 
process, but it can be exhausting.

Chapter 2: Operating Inside 
the Workbook
In This Chapter
✓ Selecting, editing, naming, and clearing cells
✓ Dragging text, numbers, or dates
✓ Entering things in general
✓ Using cell formulas
✓ Copying relatively and absolutely
A
ll kinds of cells exist these days. For instance, fuel cells and stem cells 
have been in the news lately. As the name implies, a cell is a small part 
of a larger whole. We work with Excel cells, which are small rectangles that 
are arranged in rows and columns on a worksheet.
This chapter focuses on the things you can do in cells rows and columns. 
Excel conforms to standard behaviors that you’re probably already used to 
in other applications. Even if you’ve spent most of your computing life using 
e-mail and now have to do some calculating, it’s a fairly easy task to get 
Excel to carry out your wishes.
Interacting with Excel
Excel constantly gives you feedback as you work. You can follow the discus-
sion in this section by simply opening Excel. Click Excel’s Dock icon to see a 
workbook that’s open to our starting point: a blank standard worksheet.
Selecting, editing, and naming cells
Here are some basics on the most common things you’re apt to do with cells:
 
✦ Selecting cells: Click a cell to select it. Excel indicates the selected cell 
in three ways:
 
• Darkened row number and column heading: When you open a new, 
blank workbook, Excel selects the cell in the upper-left corner of the 
worksheet, which is the intersection of column A and row 1. For con-
venience, we refer to that intersection as cell A1. See Figure 2-1.

Interacting with Excel
380
 
• Heavy border: In Figure 2-1, cell B1 has a dark border to indicate it’s 
the selected cell. In your workbook, cell A1 has the dark border to 
indicate it was selected by default.
 
• Name box: See the Formula Bar discussion later in this chapter.
 
✦ Editing in-cell: When you start typing in a cell, the border gets a nice, 
soft shadow and seems to be closer to you than the rest of the sheet, as 
shown in Figure 2-1, where we typed something. The blinking insertion 
cursor displays inside the cell so you can see and control where text will 
appear as you type or paste.
  
✦ Returning to in-cell editing: After you select something other than the 
cell you’re editing, the cell you’re editing returns to its normal appear-
ance. To return to in-cell editing, double-click the cell you just edited. 
Excel displays the insertion cursor in the cell, and you can begin editing 
the cell’s contents.
 
✦ Cell range: You can select or refer to more than one cell at a time. When 
more than one cell is selected or referred to at a time, it’s called a cell range.
 
• To select a group of cells, drag the mouse cursor across the cells 
you wish to select. When you release the mouse button, the range of 
cells becomes highlighted, and you’ll notice that the row and column 
headers have darkened to indicate the selected range.
 
• Excel uses a colon (:) to indicate a cell range. Type A1:C5 to indicate 
a range of cells whose top left position is A1, and the bottom-right 
position is C5. Cell ranges can be named. See the Name Box entry a 
little later in this section.
 
• To select non-contiguous ranges of cells, hold down the Ô button as 
you drag the mouse cursor over cell ranges or select individual cells 
by clicking them.
 
✦ Select all: Near cell A1 is a diamond-shaped button that selects all the 
cells of a worksheet at once. This button is handy for applying format-
ting to all cells at once. (See Figure 2-1.) This is the same as pressing 
Ô-A. This way you can apply formatting options to the entire sheet.

✦ Editing in the Formula Bar: This is an alternative to in-cell editing. 
Before you can edit in the Formula Bar, you must turn it on. To toggle the 
display of the Formula Bar, in Excel, choose View➪Formula Bar and then 
look at the top of the screen. The wide, skinny bar that you can see in 
Figure 2-2 is the Formula Bar, where you can type instead of typing in the 
cell. Sometimes typing in the Formula Bar is better because it doesn’t 
cover up other cells while you type in it, and because it can show more 
of the cell contents at once.
 
✦ Name box: The Name box is part of the Formula Bar (see the preceding 
bullet). Name box can do the following:
 
• Automatically display: The Name box displays the name or address of 
the currently selected cell, range of cells, or object that is currently 
selected. See Figure 2-2, where the selected cell is A1.
 
• Select a cell or a range of cells: For example, type A1:C5 in the Name 
box and then press Return or Enter to select the range of cells from 
cell A1 through C5.
 
 Excel 2008 has a completely revamped 
Help system. Help now features free 
online training courses and movies.

Clearing a cell
 
Want to get rid of something inside a cell? All you have to do is click that cell 
and press the Delete key.
That’s handy for a single cell, but if you select a range of cells and press the 
Delete key, only the contents of the first cell in the range will be deleted. The 
following section explains how to clear a range of cells.
Clearing many cells at once
To clear a range of cells, select the range of cells and then hold down the Ô 
key down while you press the Delete key.
Using the Delete key method deletes cell formatting and comments along 
with cell contents. You can clear just formats, contents, or comments by 
using this method:
 
1. Select the cell range you wish to clear.
 
 Select by dragging the mouse or entering the name of the cell range into 
the Name box.
 
2. Choose Edit➪Clear. From the submenu, choose one of the following:
 
• All: Clears contents, formats, and contents.
 
• Formats: Clears formats without disturbing contents or comments.
 
• Contents: Clears contents without disturbing formats or comments.
 
• Comments: Clears comments without disturbing contents or formats.

Making sense of cursors
Excel is always trying to tell you what it can do. When you’re in a worksheet, 
the cursor changes as you move the mouse around. The way the cursor 
looks reveals what you can do:
 
✦ Selection cursor: This is the dark border that surrounds a cell or range 
of cells to indicate what’s selected, as illustrated by cell B1 in Figure 2-3, 
which shows the selection cursor around the cell containing January.
 
• Press Return, Enter, Tab, or an arrow key to move the selection 
cursor from one cell to another. 
 
• Click a cell using the mouse to set the selection cursor to individual 
cells.
 
• Drag over cells with the mouse to select a range of cells and set the 
selection cursor to that range.
 
✦ Mouse cursor: Usually this is an open cross, but it can be changed. Here 
are the various mouse cursors:
 
 
✦ Open cross: This is the mouse cursor you see most of the time in Excel. 
When you see the open cross, Excel is tired of staring at you and expects 
you to do something.
 
 
✦ Hand: When you see the hand, you can hold down the mouse button 
and drag a cell or cell range from its current location to any other loca-
tion on the worksheet.
 
Figure 2-3:

range of

Fill handle

Excel doesn’t know when you’re done typing 
in a cell unless you take specific action to let 
Excel know you’re no longer working with a cell. 
When you’re done editing in a cell or the 
Formula Bar, take any of the following actions 
to let Excel know you’ve finished:
 ✓ Press Return or Enter.
 ✓ Press an arrow key.
 ✓ Press the Tab key.
 ✓ Click a different cell.

Dragging a Series of Text, Numbers, or Dates

✦ Dark arrow: This arrow cursor appears only if the mouse pointer moves 
over a column or a row indicator. Although pointing in itself is bad man-
ners, Excel is only trying to be helpful in this case. The arrow points 
down when the mouse pointer is in a column indicator, or points to the 
right when the mouse pointer is over a row indicator (see Figure 2-4).
 
• Click when this arrow is visible to select the entire row(s) or 
column(s).
 
• Drag when this arrow is visible to select multiple rows or columns.
 
 
✦ Double arrow: The double arrow appears when the mouse pointer is over 
the divider between cells, between rows, and in various windows to let 
you know you can move pane dividers and other dividers. When you see 
this cursor, hold down the mouse button and drag the divider to resize, or 
double-click the mouse to automatically size the row or column.
 
 Undo! If you do something by mistake, press Ô-Z immediately!
 
Figure 2-4: 
Selecting 
two entire 
rows.
 
 
 
✦ Solid cross: To see this cursor, the mouse pointer has to be positioned 
over the lower-right corner of the cell selection indicator, or the fill 
handle. To drag the fill handle, hold down the mouse button when you 
see the solid cross and then drag to copy the selection across or down. 
See the following section for details about special fill handle capabilities.
Dragging a Series of Text, Numbers, or Dates
Excel is pretty smart. Excel can automatically fill in a series of either numbers 
or dates, and can even make intelligent guesses about a series of numbers.
Filling in a series
We use an example to show how Excel can fill in a range of cells for you. 
Follow along on your computer to watch what happens:
 
1. With Excel open, start with a blank, standard worksheet.
 
2. Fill in the worksheet.
 
 For this example, fill in your worksheet to match what you see in 
Figure 2-3 earlier in this chapter.

3. Click cell B2.
 
 The selection cursor appears.
 
 4. Position the mouse cursor over the lower-right corner of the selected 
cell (the fill handle) so that it becomes the solid cross cursor.
 
5. Drag the fill handle to the right and watch Excel do some magic.
 
 As you drag across the cells, you see the ToolTip note each month in the 
series (compare with Figure 2-5).
Release the mouse a few cells over, and Excel types all the months for you! 
Your screen looks like Figure 2-5. Additionally, when you let go, a little widget 
appears. Resist the urge to click the widget! If you’re curious about what’s 
in the widget, look at Figure 2-5 and read the sidebar, “Wondering about wid-
gets,” but don’t choose any options from the widget right now.

Select cell B1.
Having Excel figure out a pattern
Excel can do more than fill in a series of either numbers or dates. Excel can 
make intelligent guesses about a series of numbers. Follow these steps to 
see how Excel deduces what number values to fill in (see Figure 2-6):
 
1. Enter 1 in cell B2 and enter 3 in cell C2.
 
 Typing in a cell dismisses the widget. Notice that 1 and 3 are odd num-
bers in sequence in adjoining cells.
 
2. Select B2:C2.
 
 The trick here is to select both cells at once (drag over both cells) so 
that Excel notes the first two values of the series.
 
3. Without clicking anything else, grab the solid fill handle’s cross cursor 
and drag it to the right.
 
 Excel deduces from the selected cells that you want a series of odd 
numbers and then fills in the series.

2. Select cells B2:C2.
Excel can figure out most series of numbers from just two or three starting 
numbers. Series can be in rows, such as the example we use, or in columns.
Using the Custom Lists feature
The Custom Lists feature is about making lists that Excel can use when filling 
in series by dragging a selected cell’s fill handle (the solid crosshair cursor), 
which results in an automatic series fill. Custom Lists feature isn’t related to 
the similarly named List Manager feature or the list worksheet type, which 
we discuss elsewhere in this book.
Not only can Excel figure out number and date series on its own; you can 
teach Excel to figure out just about any series. For example, say you fre-
quently make reports that have a series of reoccurring days.
You have two easy ways to make a new series with Custom Lists:

Entering in General Format
In some respects, Excel is a bit like a word processor. You can type text into 
a cell and format the text in much the same way as a word processor, but 
Excel has no concept of a sentence or paragraph. The default format for cells 
is General format. For that reason, it’s important to know how Excel auto-
matically formats what you enter into a cell. In Chapter 3 of this minibook, 
we describe how to change the General format to other formats.
Occasionally Office displays little lightning-bolt 
widgets to offer you alternatives to the default 
behavior. They appear whenever Office thinks 
it got it right, but knows that there is an alter-
native behavior that you might prefer over the 
default behavior. You see a widget in Figure 
2-5. Although Excel got it right (we wanted the 
default, which is Fill Series). We could have 
chosen an option from the pop-up menu:
 ✓ Copy Cells: Copies contents and formatting. 
This doesn’t fill in the series.
 ✓ Fill Series: This is the default behavior and 
is happens in the example. Formatting is 
copied, and the series is filled.
 ✓ Fill Formatting Only: Copies just the format-
ting, not the contents. This doesn’t fill in the 
series with cell content.
 ✓ Fill Without Formatting: Copies the 
selected cell’s contents, not the formatting. 
This fills in the series without copying the 
formatting.
 ✓ Fill Months: Another way to perform Fill 
Series. Excel figured out we were copying 
months and offers it as a specific option in 
this case. You see this option only if you 
start copying the series with a month.
To dismiss a widget, click a cell away from the 
series and type a character.

Making Cell Formulas
Cell formulas are equations that perform calculations or logical operations. 
Every cell formula starts with the = sign. An argument appears after the 
equals sign; for example, =1+1. You can enter a formula on your own, or you 
can use Formula Builder, which helps you build formulas using a step-by-
step structured wizard-like method. We cover both ways to enter a formula 
in the following sections.
These words have special meaning in Excel:
 
✦ Function: A function is a specific calculation, such as SUM, MULTIPLY, 
or COSINE. A function can be a logical operator, such as IF. Functions are 
represented in uppercase in Excel documentation.
 
✦ Formula: These are the instructions that tell Excel what you want to cal-
culate. Formulas start with the equals = sign and include functions that 
have arguments. A formula entered in a cell is a cell formula.
 
✦ Argument: An argument is a variable in a calculation or logical opera-
tion. This is the kind of argument you may remember from math class; 
not the kind of argument you have when someone else is being stupid.
 
✦ Syntax: These are rules that explain what should be entered and the 
order in which to enter arguments in a cell formula.
Entering formulas
If you’re new to Excel, don’t feel bad if what you type doesn’t produce the 
expected result at first. Chances are a stray character or missing character 
got mixed in. Be sure to refer to the earlier section about entering formulas 
in General format, as chances are the clue you need about what went wrong 
is in Table 2-1.
 
For the examples in this chapter, be sure the Formula Bar is visible. Toggle 
the Formula Bar on from Excel’s View menu and choose Formula Bar. To 
open a standard, blank worksheet, click the + Sheet Tab button at the 
bottom of the window to display a fresh worksheet. If Excel isn’t open, click 
the Excel Dock icon to open Excel to a blank standard worksheet.
Typing a formula manually
We start with a very easy example to show you the structure of a formula 
and that Excel treats numbers as values within a formula:
 
1. Start with a blank worksheet.
 
2. Type =1+1 and then press Return, Enter, Tab, or an arrow key to exit 
the cell.
 
 Excel displays the value of the formula in cell A1 and displays the 
formula in the Formula Bar.

Book III
Chapter 2
Operating Inside 
the Workbook

391
The cell’s appearance changes while you type. Observe and see how the cell 
appears while you type and after you exit the cell. You can use the value rep-
resented in cells in formulas.
Here’s another example. This time we use values from cells in the worksheet 
instead of using numbers in the formula. This gives you experience figuring 
out various ways to refer to cells and cell ranges in formulasL
  
1. Start with a blank worksheet.
 
2. Type 1 into cells A1 and B1.
 
 The value of 1 displays in cells A1 and B1, as shown in Figure 2-8.
 
3. In cell C1, type =A1+B1.
 
 Your screen looks exactly like Figure 2-8. Excel color-codes the cell ref-
erences within your formula to match the referenced cells A1 and B1, 
which are now highlighted to match the color code in the formula. Your 
formula now displays in the Formula Bar.
 
4. Press Return, Enter, Tab, or an arrow key to exit the cell.
 
 Excel displays the value of the formula in cell A1 and displays the for-
mula in the Formula Bar.

Letting Excel type a formula for you
Here’s an example that shows you how to let Excel type for you so you’re 
less likely to make a typing mistake in a formula:
 
1. Start with a blank worksheet.
 
2. Type 1 into cells A1 and B1.
 
 The value of 1 displays in cells A1 and B1, as shown in Figure 2-8.
 
3. In cell C1, type the equals sign (=), click cell A1, type the plus sign (+), 
and then click cell B1.
 
 After you type the equals sign and move the mouse, you notice the 
cursor changes. A cell selection indicator moves with the mouse. When 
you put the selection indicator over cell A1, clicking the mouse tells 

Making Cell Formulas
392
Excel you want to use the value of cell A1 in the formula and types it for 
you. You can do the same with cell B1. Again your screen looks identical 
to Figure 2-8.
 
4. Press Return, Enter, Tab, or an arrow key to exit the cell.
 
 Excel displays the value of the formula in cell A1 and displays the 
formula in the Formula Bar.
You’re allowed to select ranges of cells, which is a great help when working 
with complicated formulas.
Entering a function manually
This example shows how to use a built-in cell function within your formula. 
You use the SUM worksheet function to add the values of two cells.
 
1. Start with a blank worksheet.
 
2. Type 1 into cells A1 and B1.
 
 The value of 1 displays in cells A1 and B1, as shown in Figure 2-8.
 
3. In cell C1, type = SUM(A1:B1).
 
 For the time being, ignore the pop-up menu (we discuss that in the 
following section). Excel displays the value of the calculation in cell C1 
and the formula in the Formula Bar.
 
4. Press Return, Enter, Tab, or an arrow key to exit the cell.
 
 Excel displays the value of the formula in cell A1 and displays the for-
mula containing the SUM function in the Formula Bar.
In this example, SUM is the function, and the cell range A1:B1 is the argument. 
The argument of a function is placed in parentheses. Entering a function and 
its arguments manually may be useful when you refer to cells that are widely 
dispersed on a worksheet.
Letting Excel type functions and arguments
Excel has hundreds of built-in functions that you can use in cell formulas. 
While you type a function in a cell formula, a pop-up list appears. In the fol-
lowing example, we use Excel’s built-in SUM function. See Figure 2-9 for this 
sequence.
 
1. Start with a blank worksheet.
 
2. Type 1 into cells A1 and B1.
 
 The value of 1 displays in cells A1 and B1, as shown in Figure 2-8.

3. In cell C1, type =S.
 
 Wow! While you type, a pop-up menu showing all worksheet functions 
beginning with the letter S displays. Look at all the functions that start 
with the letter S! Right now, you’re interested in the SUM function.
 
4. Choose SUM from within all those S options in the pop-up menu but 
don’t type anything.
 
 Excel displays =SUM(|) with the vertical bar indicating the insertion 
cursor is ready to fill in the argument.

5. Drag over the range A1:B1.
 
 Excel enters the cell range for you and you don’t have to worry about 
making a typing mistake (see Figure 2-9). Is that neat or what?
 
 (Optional) You can manually type the argument.
 
6. Press Return, Enter, Tab, or an arrow key to exit the cell.
 
 Excel displays the value of the formula in cell A1 and displays the for-
mula containing the SUM function in the Formula Bar.
 
When you enter a cell formula that includes a function, Excel shows you the 
function’s name and its syntax, as shown in Figure 2-9. The function’s name 
is blue and is underlined like a hyperlink. That’s because it’s a link to the 
Help topic for that particular function. Each function is thoroughly docu-
mented with complete sample data and examples so that you can easily see 
how to use it. (See Figure 2-10.)
Using Formula Builder
 
 Formula Builder is a tool in Toolbox designed to help you build cell formulas 
by walking you through your formula and its functions. Formula Builder 
enables you to browse all of Excel’s functions. To activate Formula Builder:
 
1. Click in an empty cell.
 
 Formula Builder puts your finished formula into the cell you choose.

 Formula Builder opens in Toolbox (see Figure 2-11).
 
3. In Formula Builder, enter a search term in the search field, as shown 
in Figure 2-11.
 
 You can enter the name of a function if you already know it. Otherwise, 
enter a term you think might be a function. Formula Builder displays the 
results of your search. Figure 2-11 shows the results of searching for count.
 
4. Click a function to select it in the search results.
 
 You can read about the function in the Description area. If you want to 
read more, click the More Help on This Function link. Read the descrip-
tions until you find the function you need. You can enter a different search 
term if the function you were looking for didn’t turn up in the search 
results. If you can’t find the proper function, try searching Excel Help. If 
that doesn’t work, see Book I, Chapter 7 for additional suggestions.
 
5. Double-click a function in the search results list to choose it 
for your formula.
 
 The function is added to your worksheet with the insertion cursor ready 
for your input from Formula Builder. Formula Builder displays empty 
fields for arguments specific to the function you selected.

6. Click into an argument field in Formula Builder.
 
 The insertion cursor blinks in the empty argument field.
 
7. Do one of the following to satisfy an argument:
 
• Type text or values to satisfy the argument.
 
• Click a cell to satisfy the argument.
 
• Drag a range of cells to satisfy the argument.
 
 Doing any of these methods results in the display of your argument’s 
value or formula in Formula Builder. More than one argument may 
be needed for your calculation. Click More Help on This Function 
if you need specific information about the function you’ve chosen, 
including details about required arguments or how your function cal-
culates its result. Some functions let you add and remove arguments 
by clicking plus or minus sign buttons to the right of argument fields. 
Formula Builder displays the current value of your function based 
upon the arguments you have provided. Don’t press Return or Enter 
until you’ve finished satisfying all arguments unless you want to quit 
Formula Builder.

 The finished formula appears in the Formula Bar. The cell that you 
selected in Step 1 displays the formula’s value or result. Double-click the 
cell to perform manual in-cell editing if needed, or refine your formula in 
the Formula Bar.
Knowing When to Be Absolute, Relatively Speaking
Usually, you simply press Ô-C or choose Edit➪Copy to copy things. 
Likewise, you press Ô-V or choose Edit➪Paste to paste. Copying and pasting 
cells and cell ranges works differently from text and other objects, so they 
can be a little bit puzzling if you don’t know the secret about relative versus 
absolute references.
Using a relative reference
Say you want to use the value of cell A1 in a formula, so you type =A1 in your 
formula to use the value of cell A1 and away you go. Your formula works, and 
all seems well.
What Excel is actually thinking when you type =A1 is that you want to use 
the value of the cell that’s a certain number of rows and columns away from 
the cell in which you’re typing your formula. Your formula works as expected 
in its original location, but if you copy the cell containing your formula and 
then paste that cell somewhere else, the formula in the pasted cell no longer 
refers to the value in cell A1. Instead, it refers to the cell in the relative loca-
tion (the same number of rows and columns away from the copied cell). This 
concept of relativity is why this reference style is a relative reference.
Here’s a fun little example with a relative reference. See Figure 2-12 while you 
follow these steps:
 
1. Click in a cell, any cell.
 
 For this example, we clicked in cell A1.
 
2. Type something in the cell.
 
 For this example, we typed Hi.
 
3. Click in any other cell.
 
 For this example, we clicked in cell B2.

Book III
Chapter 2
Operating Inside 
the Workbook
Knowing When to Be Absolute, Relatively Speaking
397
 
4. In the cell you chose in Step 3, type a formula to equal what’s in the 
cell from Step 1 and then press Return or Enter.
 
 For example, assume you typed Hi in cell A1 in Step 2. In this new cell, 
you’d type =A1. Figure 2-11 shows =A1.
 
Figure 2-12: 
Copying 
a relative 
reference.
 
 
5. Select the cell that you just typed in, and then press Ô-C.
 
 This copies the cell you just put the formula into.
 
6. Click in any unused cell and choose Edit➪Paste or press Ô-V.
 
 Notice that the pasted cell doesn’t show the value of cell A1. In this 
example, the pasted cell refers to A3 (double-click the cell to see the cell 
formula), which is one row up and one row over from the pasted cell. 
That’s because we copied cell B2, which refers to A1, which is one row 
up and one row over from B2.
Excel noticed that we were referring to an empty cell, and put a little widget 
next to where we pasted to make sure that’s what we wanted to do. We can 
click Ignore Error because we referred to an empty for demonstration pur-
poses. If you see this warning when working for real, take a close look at 
your pasted formula to make sure it works as expected.
Using an absolute reference
 
An absolute reference always uses the exact cell referred to in the formula. 
You do this by adding a dollar sign ($) to the row, the column, or both in a 
formula. If you want to always refer to the value in cell A1, type =$A$1. A good 
way to remember how to make an absolute reference is to think of the dollar 
sign ($) as always. When you read =$A$1, think “equals always column A, 
always row 1.”

Knowing When to Be Absolute, Relatively Speaking
398
In rare circumstances, you might need an absolute value reference to either 
a row or a column. If you want to refer to the value in column using an abso-
lute reference A but use a relative reference for rows, type =$A1.
Comparing relative and absolute references
Follow these steps to create an absolute reference and compare how copy-
ing an absolute reference works versus copying a relative reference. See 
Figure 2-13.
 
1. Start with a blank worksheet.
 
2. Enter the numbers exactly as shown in Figure 2-11.
 
• In row 1, type 1 7 8 9 10.
 
• In column A, type 1 2 3 4 5 6.
 
 Make sure your values match the values shown in row A1:E1 and column 
A1:A6 in Figure 2-13.
 
3. In cell C3, type the formula =A1.
 
 As you type, cell A1 lights up to let you know you typed correctly. Notice 
this is a relative reference because it doesn’t have any dollar signs in the 
formula.
 
4. Press Return, Enter, Tab, or an arrow key to exit the cell.
 
5. In cell E5 type the formula =$A$1.
 
 As you type, cell A1 lights up to let you know you typed correctly. Notice 
this is an absolute reference because it has dollar signs in the formula.
 
6. Press Return, Enter, Tab, or an arrow key to exit the cell.
 
7. Drag the fill handle of cell C3 to the right to cell G3 and then release 
the mouse.
 
 The filled-in values match Figure 2-13. Ignore the widget.

8. Drag the fill handle of cell C3 down to cell A6 and then release 
the mouse.
 
 The filled-in values match Figure 2-13. Ignore the widget.
 
9. Drag the fill-copy handle of cell E5 to the right to cell H5.
 
 The filled-in values match Figure 2-13. Ignore the widget.
 
10. Drag the fill-copy handle of cell E5 down to cell E10.
 
 The filled-in values match Figure 2-13. Ignore the widget.
The point of this exercise is so that you can see what happens when you 
copy a relative reference to the result when you copy an absolute reference:
 
✦ Relative reference: In this case, C3 uses a relative reference, so when 
you fill the range, the reference changes and you get a nice replication of 
the original data.
 
✦ Absolute reference: Cell E5 uses an absolute reference, so you always 
get the value of cell A1.

f you hold this book for five minutes in your hands each day, Excel auto-
matically starts behaving. Jokes aside, we start this chapter by pointing 
out some interesting formatting options, including how to control borders, 
shading, and patterns. We explain the mysteries behind Excel’s date and 
time calculations, and how Excel can apply formatting for you based on a 
cell’s contents. Lastly, we cover Excel’s unique file-sharing capabilities.
Preparing to Format
 
 The Formatting Palette is usually the quickest way to format things in Excel 
(see Figure 3-1). If the Formatting Palette isn’t visible, click the Toolbox 
button on Excel’s Standard toolbar and then click the Formatting Palette 
button on Toolbox’s small toolbar. We recommend that you leave the 
Formatting Palette open while you go through this chapter.
Alternatively, dialogs offer more formatting options. You can display dia-
logs by right-clicking or Control-clicking the interface or objects, choos-
ing Format from the resulting pop-up menu, and selecting an appropriate 
formatting option from the Format dialog. You can access some dialogs by 
clicking buttons on the Formatting Palette.
 
Before you can format anything, you must first select it. In general, to select 
something, click it. The interface responds by changing the display to indi-
cate your selection, usually by changing the selection’s border or outline.

402
Formatting Cells
Formatting Cells
One of the things you might find do frequently is changing the way cells look, 
and you do this with the Formatting Palette. Refer to Figure 3-1 while we dis-
cuss the organization of the Formatting Palette in the following sections.
Adjusting fonts
The Font section of the Formatting Palette applies formats to fonts. When 
an entire cell is selected, the formatting is applied to all text within the cell. 
You can select individual words or letters in a cell or in the Formula Bar, and 
then apply formatting to only your selection. You can select text in SmartArt, 
WordArt, and charts to which you want to apply formatting. You can specify 
font name, size, and color; as well as appearance characteristics, such as 
boldface, superscript, subscript, and italics.
Here are some of the features you can modify:
 
✦ Name: This is a WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) pop-up menu — 
simply select the font that you want from all the fonts offered. The first item 
in the list, Font Collections, is new in Excel 2008. Select this item to make a 
sublist appear, where you can select from categories including fonts com-
patible with Office for Windows and PDF.
 
✦ Size: Click Size to access the pop-up menu. In this menu, you can select 
a size from a list, type a point value, or (new for Excel 2008) drag the 
slider control, which is our personal favorite.
 
✦ Superscript and Subscript: Select an individual character and then click 
one of these two buttons to apply the format.
Applying number and text formats
General format is the default cell format. In Chapter 2 of this minibook, we 
provide a table that explains how General format treats characters when 
you enter them. Briefly, the General format applies formatting by using these 
simple rules:
 
✦ A cell that contains any text characters is formatted as text.
 
✦ A cell containing numbers only is formatted as a number or date.
 
✦ A cell that begins with an equals sign (=) is a formula.
 
You’re allowed to override General format and apply any format that you 
want to a cell. If you apply text format to a cell that was formatted as a 
number or date, you can no longer use the number value or date in formula 
calculations.

select a format to apply to your cell’s content. You can also scroll to the 
bottom of the menu and select Customize to display the Format Cells 
dialog’s Number tab, as shown in Figure 3-2.
 
 The Format Cells Number tab offers formatting options in a Category 
list, as shown in Figure 3-2. Select Custom to create your own formats 
by using formatting codes. You can use the existing codes shown in the 
dialog as a guide.
 
 You can find a complete list of formatting code options with examples in 
Excel Help under the Number Format Codes topic.
 
✦ Decimal: Click the Decimal buttons to move the decimal point in a cell 
formatted as a number either left or right.
We have a step-by-step example using Date custom formatting codes, in the 
section, “Working with Dates and Times,” later in this chapter.

Fitting and positioning content
Almost like in a word processor, you can align and position cell contents:
 
✦ Horizontal: Select from left, center, right, or full justification in a cell.
 
✦ Vertical: Select top, center, bottom, or distributed evenly.
 
✦ Orientation: Tip and turn cell contents.
 
✦ Wrap Text: Allow text to wrap within a cell.
 
✦ Shrink Text to Fit: Reduce the size of the text so that it fits in the cell.
 
✦ Indent: Use the pop-up menu or type a value to indent text from the left 
border of a cell.
 
✦ Merge Cells: Select two or more cells, and then click this check box 
to merge the selection into a single cell. You retain only the content of 
the upper-left cell. Select an already merged cell and then deselect this 
check box to unmerge the merged cell.
Coloring cells and borders
You can change the format of the type, style, color, and weight of cell 
borders. You can fill cells with shading, colors, and patterns. Use these 
Formatting Palette tools:
 
✦ Type: Select Type to display a toolbar that lets you select from an

well as which sides of the cell should have a border.

tinuous or dashed border style.
 
✦ Border Color: Choose Color to Display Excel’s color picker (which we

Two additional formatting options that we want to mention aren’t on the 
Formatting Palette:
 
✦ Conditional formatting: You can format cells so that the formatting 
changes when certain conditions are met. See the section, “Formatting 
Based on Conditions,” later in this chapter.
 
✦ Cell overlap: When you type in one cell and then into the cell immedi-
ately to the right, the text in the second cell may cover the text in the 
first cell. This is normal. Adjust the column width and row heights by 
using the double arrow cursor, as described in Chapter 2 of this mini-
book. Sometimes, you can use Wrap Text or Shrink Text to Fit (both dis-
cussed in the preceding section) if you want to solve overlap problems.
Tilting your text
Quite often, people have more columns than can fit on a single screen (or 
page, if you want to print). Of course, you could get one or two large moni-
tors, or invest in a printer that can output poster-size sheets.
Or you could make friends with the Formatting Palette, which thoughtfully 
allows you to click the Fit To button. But selecting that option causes every-
thing to scale, which sometimes makes the stuff inside the cell too small.
In Figure 3-3, we tilted the column headers, which were much larger than the 
data, by clicking Fit To. We got an entire year’s worth of quotas into a single 
sheet, without making the print too small to read. Of course, you can tilt the 
column headers even more by following these steps:
 
1. Select the cells you want to format.
 
2. Choose Format➪Cells.
 
 The Format Cells dialog opens, as shown in Figure 3-4.

These options are also on the Formatting Palette.
Enter a value or click the Increase/Decrease control.
 
3. Click the Alignment tab.
 
 This tab’s orientation controls enable you to tilt text to any angle. In 
Figure 3-4, we set the angle to 58 degrees.
 
4. Drag the line in the Orientation area until you get the best angle.
 
 If you don’t want to drag text to tilt it, you can type a degree angle into 
the field or click the Increase/Decrease control for degree angles.
Building borders
The Formatting Palette has very handy presets for borders, but you can 
find even more choices in the Format Cells dialog, which you can display by 
choosing Format➪Cells and then selecting the Border tab. See Figure 3-5. 
The Format Cells dialog offers these options:
 
✦ Color: Select a color for your border from Excel’s color picker.
 
✦ Style: Select a solid, dashed, thick, thin, or double-style border.
 
✦ Presets: Select one of three border options:
 
• None: Clears borders from the selected cell or cell range.
 
• Outline: Applies a border to the selected cell or around the outside 
border of a range of cells.
 
• Inside: Applies borders to cells within a selected range, but doesn’t 
put a border around the entire range.
 
✦ Border: Select toggle buttons to turn individual side or diagonal borders 
on and off.

Coloring and Shading
Just the other day, a rant in a newsgroup (in the “Excel Isn’t a Coloring Book” 
post) resulted from over-the-edge colorful spreadsheets. In light of that discus-
sion, we hope you use colors judiciously. Follow these steps to fill your cells 
with colors and shadings:
 
1. Select the cell or range of cells you want to format.
 
2. Choose Format➪Cells.
 
 The Format Cells dialog appears.
 
3. Select the Patterns tab, as shown in Figure 3-6.
 
4. Select an option from the Cell Shading area.
 
 You can find these options:
 
• Color: Click a color from the picker, and you’re done.
 
• Pattern: Click the Pattern pop-up menu and select a color from the 
bottom of the picker. Click the pop-up menu again and select a pat-
tern from the top of the picker.
 
 You can select a solid color, a pattern, or both. If you select a color from 
the color picker and then apply a pattern, the pattern seems like it’s on 
top of the color you selected.

Patterns can be difficult for some printers, so print a test page whenever you 
use a pattern to see whether it works. Of course, print a test page only when 
you need to print the final product, but it’s good advice to test everything: 
from playing with the patterns to printing specimen sheets. Of course, we’ll 
be blamed now for everything from wasting time to wasting paper, so do this 
when you have some extra time and recycled (or scrap) paper!
Changing the color picker
Eagle-eyed readers are probably wondering 
how they can change those 56 default colors in 
the color picker. Follow these steps:
 1. Choose Excel➪Preferences to open the 
Preferences pane.
 2. In the Authoring section, click the Color To 
button to open the Color dialog, as shown 
in the figure in this sidebar.
 3. Select a color swatch in the Standard

Working with Dates and Times
Working with Dates and Times
Excel has fantastic date- and time-calculation capabilities. You need to know 
just two secrets:
 
✦ Each day is represented by a whole number, called a serial number.
 
✦ Portions of days are represented by decimal fractions.
To follow along with our examples of how to work with date and time calcula-
tions and formats in the following sections, follow these steps to set up your 
Excel workbook:
 
1. Click the plus sign (+) sheet tab to open a new, blank worksheet.
 
2. Choose View➪Normal.
 
3. Fill in row 1, as shown in Figure 3-7.
 
 Type the following text into the designated cells:
 
• A1: Today
 
• B1: Experiment
 
• C1: Date
 
• D1: Time
 
• E1: Custom Format
 4. Click the Modify button to open the Mac 
OS X color picker.
 5. Select a new color and then click OK to 
close the Mac OS X color picker.
 6. Repeat these steps for each color you want 
to change.
Each workbook has its own 56-color picker. You 
can copy a set of colors from one open workbook 
to another, but each workbook is limited to 56 dif-
ferent colors. If you want to use the color picker 
from a different, open workbook, click the Copy 
Colors From pop-up menu in the Color dialog. 
Colors that you apply to charts and SmartArt 
objects are controlled Office themes, which we 
discuss in detail in Book IV, Chapter 3.

410
Working with Dates and Times
 
4. In the Formatting Palette’s Number category, click Number.
 
 Apply these formats to these three cells:
 
• C2: Date.
 
• D2: Time
 
• E2: Custom
 
 When you select Custom, the Format Cells dialog, as shown in Figure 3-2 
earlier in this chapter, appears.
 
5. Specify settings in the Format Cells dialog.
 
 Use the following settings:
 
• Category: Custom
 
• Type: Enter the formatting code mmmm d, yyyy h:mm:ss.0.
 
6. Click OK to close the Format Cells dialog.
Finding today
Some days, you get to work and don’t even know what day it is. Excel doesn’t 
have this problem. Using the worksheet you start in the preceding section, 
follow these steps:
 
1. In cell A2, type the cell formula =TODAY( ).
 
2. Press Return, Tab, or an arrow key to exit cell A2.
 
 Cell A2 displays today’s date.
 
Figure 3-7: 
Setting 
up a date 
and time 
example.
 
Getting today’s serial number
Each day has its own serial number in Excel parlance. If you follow the steps 
in the preceding section, you don’t see the serial number in cell A2 because 
the default format is General, and Excel knows your formula represents a 
date. You can change the format of cell A1 to Number by selecting it in the 
Format drop-down menu (as shown in Figure 3-7), but instead, you can do 
something a little bit fancy by following these steps:
 
1. Select cell A2.

2. Choose Edit➪Copy.
 
 Moving dotted lines surround cell A2 to indicate that cell Excel will copy 
that cell.
 
3. Select cell B2.
 
4. Choose Edit➪Paste Special.
 
 The Paste Special dialog appears.
 
5. Check the Values option in the Paste area and click OK.
 
 A number larger than 38,000 appears in cell B2, under the heading 
Experiment.
Add more cell formulas to the worksheet (see Chapter 2 in this minibook for 
more on adding formulas):
 
1. In cell C2, enter cell formula =B2.
 
 C2 displays the date.
 
2. In cell D2, enter the same cell formula =B2.
 
 D2 displays the date.
 
3. In cell E2, enter the cell formula =B2 yet again.
 
 C2 displays the date.
If the hash marks appear in cell E2 or an error message appears, widen the 
column or check that you typed everything correctly.
Your workbook looks similar to Figure 3-8. Of course, you may not be reading 
this in February!
 
Figure 3-8: 
Excel 
recognizes 
today.
 
Yesterday, tomorrow, and whenever
In the preceding section, we put the date serial number into cell B2. Now, 
change that serial number:
 
✦ Subtract one from the number shown in cell B2. Type that number into 
cell B2. The neighboring cells should display yesterday’s date, confirm-
ing that you entered the serial number of yesterday’s date.
 
✦ Add two to the number now showing in cell B2. Adding 2 to yesterday 
displays tomorrow’s date in the neighboring cells.

412
Working with Dates and Times
In Excel, to add and subtract any number of days, just add and subtract 
whole numbers. You’re probably wondering how Excel arrived at the serial 
number of today. To find out, enter 0 in cell B2. The date in the neighboring 
cells switches to January 1, 1904 — the first day that Excel knows about. 
Every day in Excel is the number of days after 1/1/1904.
Finding the time of day
Because Excel works with days as whole numbers, you might guess that por-
tions of days are fractions. Well, you’d be right! Continuing with the example 
from the preceding section, append .5 (one-half day) to the number in B2. The 
time changes to 12:00 in cell D2. Go ahead and try some different decimals.
Excel gives times that are past noon in military-time format by default. 18:00 
is 6:00 p.m. To apply civilian-time format to cell D2, follow these steps:
 
1. Type the number 38717.75 in cell B2.
 
 Cell D2 displays 18:00.
 
 If cell E2 displays hash marks, widen column E (see Chapter 2 of this 
minibook for instructions).
 
2. Click cell D2 to select it.
The first-day mystery
The beginning of time in Excel is the date with 
the serial number zero. In Excel for Mac, that 
date is January 1, 1904; in Excel for Windows, 
that date is January 1, 1900. The difference is 
because Excel for Mac came to the market 
years before Excel for Windows. At the time 
of its introduction, Excel for Windows needed 
to compete in the marketplace and had to be 
compatible with the runaway market leader on 
the PC, which was Lotus 1-2-3.
Microsoft knew about a leap-year bug in Lotus 
1-2-3 and had to make a choice: Be accurate but 
incompatible with Lotus and risk losing market 
share, or include the Lotus 1-2-3 error and 
be compatible. Microsoft chose compatibility 
over correctness, and the rest is history. Excel 
eventually eclipsed Lotus 1-2-3 to become the 
market leader. Excel for Windows still incorrectly 
computes weekdays from Jan 1, 1900 through 
March 1, 1900. Excel for Mac avoids the problem 
by starting with a later date. All subsequent leap 
years are computed correctly.
You can manually switch the date system in a 
workbook; choose Excel➪Preferences➪Calcu
lation➪Workbook Options➪Use the 1904 Date 
System. Ordinarily, Excel handles the date system 
for you automatically, regardless of whether a 
workbook was created in Excel for Mac or Excel 
for Windows, so don’t change this setting unless 
you need to fix a workbook in which all the dates 
displayed are off by four years.

Formatting Based on Conditions
Formatting Based on Conditions
You can set Excel to change the format of any cell based on the cell’s con-
tents. Use these settings when you want a cell’s appearance to change when 
its value changes as the result of a formula or when someone types in a 
form-style worksheet. The concept behind this feature is simple: Change the 
appearance of a cell based on the cell’s current value or the formula in a cell. 
Excel for Mac allows up to three different formats for a cell or range of cells 
(see Figure 3-9).
To apply a custom conditional format, such as the one in Figure 3-9, to a 
selected cell or range of cells, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the plus sign (+) sheet tab to open a new, blank worksheet.
 
2. Choose View➪Normal.
 
3. Fill in row 1 and column 1.
 
 Type this text into these cells:
 
• A1: Time of Day
 
• A2: 8am to 11am
 
• A3: 11am to 2pm
 
• A4: 2pm to 4pm
 
• A5: 4pm to Close
 
• B1: Number of Sales
 
• B2: 5
 
• B3: 17
 
• B4: 35
 
• B5: 11

Sharing Workbooks
Sharing Excel workbooks and keeping track of changes is something that 
Excel does better than any other application in the Office suite. Excel has 
three features that make collaborating easy:
 
✦ Insert Comment: This simple feature lets you put comments into com-
ment boxes that float above your worksheet.
 
✦ Track Changes: A much more robust commenting and tracking system. 
When you have track changes turned on, Excel automatically records 
changes, who made them, and when they were made.
 
✦ Share Workbook: Two or more users can use the same workbook 
together in real time. Even Excel for Mac and Excel for Windows users 
can share a single workbook simultaneously.

416
Sharing Workbooks
Inserting a comment
You can most easily add comments to a worksheet, without disturbing con-
tents or formatting, by using Excel’s Insert Comment feature. We show you 
how to add a comment, edit a comment, delete a comment, and change a 
comment’s appearance.
To insert a comment, follow these steps:
 
1. Select a cell and choose Insert➪Comment.
 
 A text box opens, displaying your name.
 
2. Type your comment in the text box.
 
 You don’t even have to click in the box. Just start typing. Your typed text 
appears in a little box with selection handles. See Figure 3-10.
 
3. Click outside the text box when you finish typing.
 
 A red triangle appears in the upper-right corner of the cell, as shown in 
Figure 3-10, to indicate the cell has a comment.
 
Hover your mouse over a cell that has a red triangle to read the comment.
 
Figure 3-10: 
Reading a 
comment.
 
To edit the comment, follow these steps:
 
1. Select a cell that contains the red-triangle comment indicator.
 
 The Insert menu changes from Comment to Edit Comment.
 
2. Choose Insert➪Edit Comment.
 
3. Make your edits and then click anywhere outside the comment box.
You can remove a comment from a cell even more easily than you can 
insert a comment. Select the cell that contains a comment and then choose 
Edit➪Clear➪Comments.
You might consider this feature a bit over the top, but you can format com-
ment boxes to an incredible degree. In Figure 3-10, when you insert or edit 
a comment box, the selection handles turn on. When these handles are vis-
ible, double-click the comment box’s border to expose the Format Comment 
dialog, as shown in Figure 3-11. Select from a surprisingly large number of 
options that you can apply to your comment box.

To change when comments appear, choose Excel➪Preferences and click the 
View button. Select one of three options (as shown in Figure 3-12):
 
✦ No Comments or Indicators: The interface displays no indication that 
comments exist. You can still add, edit, and delete comments.
 
✦ Indicators Only, and Comments on Hover: The default behavior for 
inserted comments.
 
✦ Comments and Indicators: Red-triangle comment indicators and com-
ment boxes are always visible. You don’t have to hover the cursor over 
comment indicators to see comment boxes.
Tracking changes
Say that you want multiple people to work on a workbook that you plan to 
distribute via e-mail or other means. To make this situation even more fun, 
you’re in charge of this project. You distribute a workbook to several people. 
Each person makes changes and then they return their changed workbooks 
to you. After that, you decide which changes to accept or reject for the final 
version. Although we use a multi-person example, the process works just as 
well if you’re working with only one or two people.
 
Before you use the Share Workbook, consider turning on the Protect Shared 
Workbook feature so that only you have the authority to delete the change his-
tory. See the section, “Protecting a shared workbook,” later in this chapter.

Turning on track changes
To turn on track changes, follow these steps:
 
1. Open a workbook.
 
2. Choose Tools➪Track Changes➪Highlight Changes.
 
 The Highlight Changes dialog opens; see Figure 3-13.
 
3. Select the Track Changes While Editing check box.
 
 Your workbook is now in Workbook Sharing mode. Some features are 
disabled in Sharing mode. See the sidebar, “Workbook Sharing mode,” 
later in this chapter, for the scoop.
 
4. In the Highlight Which Changes section, click When to display a 
pop-up menu (as shown in Figure 3-13) and choose an option.
 
 Tell Excel when to begin tracking changes. Generally, you choose All, 
meaning Excel tracks changes all the time.
 
5. Click the Who pop-up and choose whose changes you want Excel to track.
 
6. To limit tracking to a particular range, click the Where button and 
select a cell range from the pop-up menu that appears, or type the 
name of an existing cell range into the Where field.
 
7. Click OK to close the Highlight Changes dialog.
 
 Excel prompts you to save your workbook.
 
8. Close your workbook by choosing File➪Close.
Now, you’re ready to distribute your workbook. After you turn on track 
changes, send copies of the workbook via e-mail (or Messenger, CD, Flash 
drives, or what have you).
Working with track changes turned on
When the Track Changes feature is turned on and a user changes a cell, a 
balloon appears, telling you

Merging tracked changes
After people finish doing what they need to do with your workbook, they 
return their edited copies to you. Now, you need to merge copies of the 
edited workbooks into a copy of the original. Follow these steps to merge 
the changes from everyone else’s edited workbooks into a copy of the origi-
nal workbook:
 
1. Create a new folder in Finder.
 
2. Put a copy of the original workbook into the new folder.
 
3. Put copies of the edited workbooks into the same folder.
 
4. In the new folder, open the copy of the original workbook.
 
 Your original workbook opens.
 
5. Choose Tools➪Merge Workbooks.
 
 The Select File to Merge into Current Workbook dialog appears.

420
Sharing Workbooks
 
6. Navigate or use Spotlight to locate a copy of an edited workbook 
located in the new folder that you made in Step 1, and then select that 
edited workbook.
 
7. Click OK.
 
 Repeat Steps 5–7 until you merge all the workbooks into your copy of 
the original workbook.
Deciding whose changes to review
You need to decide whose changes to review, what date to use as a start-
ing point for the review, and how much of the workbook you want to review. 
Because Excel allows you to merge an unlimited number of workbooks, you may 
have changes from many individuals to deal with. Excel gives you an opportu-
nity to filter changes before you accept or reject changes (see Figure 3-15).
 
Figure 3-15:

Entire sheet or specify a range.
You can set criteria that Excel uses when it displays changed cells before 
you accept or reject those changes. Follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Tools➪Track Changes➪Accept or Reject Changes.
 
 The Select Changes to Accept or Reject dialog opens.
 
2. Make any appropriate changes to the When option.
 
 You can accept the default, enter a date, enter All, or select various 
options from the pop-up menu to the right of the entry field. Excel 
doesn’t display changes made prior to the date entered when you review 
the workbook.
 
3. Click Who and select whose changes you want to review from the 
pop-up menu that appears.
 
 Choose Everyone to review everyone’s merged changes at the same time.

4. To limit your review to a range, click the selection button to the right 
of the Where field and enter a cell range or named range.
 
5. (Optional) Select the Highlight Changes on Screen option if you want 
Excel to highlight changed cells.
 
 If you select this option, Excel gives changed cells special borders and 
blue-triangle comment indicators that you can hover over to reveal the 
changes.
 
6. Select List Changes on a New Sheet to create a new sheet that displays 
a report of the changes made.
 
 We talk about history reports in the section, “Generating a history 
report,” later in this chapter.
 
7. Click OK to close the Accept or Reject Changes dialog.
 
 Excel goes through your workbook and finds all the cells that your col-
laborators changed.
 
The settings you select in the Accept or Reject Changes dialog apply to all 
the merged workbooks at the same time.
Accepting and rejecting changes
If you followed our example from the preceding section, each changed 
cell is highlighted, and the Accept or Reject Changes dialog appears (see 
Figure 3-16). If Excel detects more than one change in a cell, you see a list of 
the cell’s original content, plus all the suggested changes. When you click 
the Accept or Reject buttons, the dialog moves on to the next cell. The 
Accept or Reject Changes dialog remains onscreen until you deal with all 
changes. The changes you accept are retained in your final version, and the 
changes you reject are removed.
Accepting and rejecting track changes works like this:
 
1. Choose Tools➪Track Changes➪Accept or Reject Changes.
 
 The Accept or Reject Changes dialog opens.
 
2. Click the button that suits your needs.
 
 You can select
 
• Accept: Accept that change only.
 
• Reject: Disregard that change only.
 
• Accept All: Accept all changes.
 
• Reject All: Disregard all changes.
 
3. Click Close when you’re done.
 
 Excel displays the final version of your workbook.

as well as turn on the features that were disabled when you began sharing 
the workbook. To turn the shared workbook back into a regular workbook, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Tools➪Track Changes➪Highlight Changes.
 
 The Highlight Changes dialog appears.
 
2. Deselect the Track Changes While Editing check box.
 
 Excel automatically saves the workbook as a fully enabled regular work-
book. Excel no longer tracks changes and discards the change history.
Generating a history report
After people have made entries in the shared workbook, the question arises, 
“How do you see the entire change history all at the same time?” We have the 
answer, of course. Our favorite way is to view the changes in a separate work-
sheet, as shown in Figure 3-17. You can generate a history report in two ways.
 
Figure 3-17: 
Viewing 
the change 
history 
report.
 
If you want to see a combined history, you must select the List Changes on a 
New Sheet option in the Select Changes to Accept or Reject dialog (which we talk 
about in the section, “Deciding whose changes to review,” earlier in this chapter).

Sharing Workbooks
 
You can’t retrieve the change history from a workbook after you accept and 
reject changes.
You can make a history report for any individual workbook by opening it and 
then following these steps:
 
1. Choose Tools➪Track Changes➪Highlight Changes.
 
 The Highlight Changes dialog appears.
 
2. Select the List Changes on a New Sheet check box.
 
 This option isn’t grayed out if changes have been made in the workbook.
 
3. Click OK.
 
 You get an amazing report detailing exactly what changes were made, by 
whom, when, and a lot more, as shown in Figure 3-17.
Using Share Workbook
Excel is the first Office application to allow more than one person at a time 
to make changes in a shared file live, in real time. The Share Workbook 
feature is useful if more than one person needs to update data in a real-
time environment. Excel has built-in rules you can select that decide which 
changes “win” in case of conflicts.
Up to 256 people can share a single workbook at one time, and they can use 
any mix of Macs or PCs. Not only can Excel deal automatically with conflicting 
Workbook Sharing mode
The Track Changes and Share Workbook fea-
tures put your workbook into Workbook Sharing 
mode. While a workbook is in Workbook Sharing 
mode, you can’t change certain aspects of the 
workbook. You can use these features before 
you turn on sharing, and they work again after 
you turn off workbook sharing. But shared 
workbooks don’t allow you to add or change 
any of the following: merged cells, conditional 
formatting, data validation, tables, charts, pic-
tures, SmartArt Graphics, WordArt, subtotals, 
hyperlinks, scenarios, data tables, PivotTables, 
embedded objects, text boxes, error checking, 
or Excel calculator.
Before sharing your workbook, tell everyone 
to choose Excel➪Preferences➪General. In 
General preferences, each person should 
make sure that his name appears in the User 
name field. Sometimes, IT departments clone 
images, and everyone winds up with the same 
name (or no name at all). If that happens, Excel 
may not be able to record useful tracking and 
history information, or worse, you may end up 
with useless info.

424
Sharing Workbooks
information, you can tell Excel to keep a history of the changes for as many 
as 32,767 days (the default is 30 days). Truly amazing stuff!
 
Before using Share Workbook, consider turning on the Protect Shared 
Workbook feature so that the change history can’t be deleted. See the sec-
tion, “Protecting a shared workbook,” later in this chapter.
Activating Share Workbook
To start sharing a workbook, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Tools➪Share Workbook➪Editing.
 
 The Share Workbook dialog opens on the Editing tab. See Figure 3-18.
 
Figure 3-18: 
Enabling 
multiple-
user 
workbook 
sharing.
 
 
2. Select the Allow Changes by More Than One User at the Same Time 
check box.
 
 Selecting this box activates Share Workbook.
 
3. Click the Advanced tab.
 
 The Share Workbook Advanced tab appears, as shown in Figure 3-19.
 
 We usually accept the default Advanced settings, except for increasing 
the tracking history to 90 days.

4. Select a Track Changes option.
 
 You can select either of these options:
 
• Keep History for [Number] Days
 
 Enter a number in the text box or use the Increase/Decrease control 
to adjust the number.
 
• Don’t Keep Change History
 
5. Select an Update Changes option.
 
 Here are your choices:
 
• When File Is Saved
 
• Automatically Every [Number] Minutes.
 
 Fill in the number of minutes or use the Increase/Decrease control to 
adjust the number. If you save automatically at regular intervals, you 
can select either Save My Changes and See Others; Changes or just 
See Other Users’ Changes.
 
6. For the Conflicting Changes Between Users section, select an option.
 
 Choose either
 
• Ask Me Which Changes Win
 
• The Changes Being Saved Win
 
7. In Personal View, select the Print Settings and Filter Setting check 
boxes to include print and filter settings.
 
8. Click OK.
 
 The Save As dialog opens.
 
9. Navigate to a shared network directory that’s read/write accessible to 
all who need to share and then click Save.
 
 Everyone who has permission to read and write to the directory can 
now open the workbook at the same time.
 
Everyone who needs to share a workbook simultaneously must have read/
write permissions to a shared directory in Mac OS X Finder and/or Windows 
Explorer on a high-speed network.
Administering a shared workbook
You return to the Editing tab of the Share Workbook dialog often when 
you’re administrating a shared workbook. To access this tab, simply choose 
Tools➪Share Workbook. The Share Workbook dialog automatically opens 

426
Sharing Workbooks
with the Editing tab displayed (as shown in Figure 3-18). You can see who’s 
sharing the workbook at any given time in the Who Has This Workbook Open 
Now list.
The Who Has This Workbook Open Now list may indicate someone’s still 
sharing, even if you know that she isn’t (maybe her connection failed while 
sharing). When this happens, remove the name of the user from the list man-
ually. Just select the user in the list and then select Remove User.
Protecting a shared workbook
 
Turning on protection before putting a workbook into Workbook Sharing 
mode prevents others from deleting the change history. Follow these steps:
 
1. Open the workbook that you plan to share and choose 
Tools➪Protection➪Protect and Share Workbook.
 
 The Protect Shared Workbook dialog appears.
 
2. Select the Sharing with Tracked Changes check box, as shown in 
Figure 3-20.
 
3. Type a password into the Password text box and click OK to close the 
Protect Shared Workbook dialog.
 
 If you attempt to turn off track changes, which would delete the history 
change log, Excel opens a dialog demanding the password. If you lose 
the password, you can’t turn off workbook sharing.

E
xcel has some unique behaviors that enable you to do special tasks. 
This chapter shows you how to take advantage of Excel’s ability to take 
ordinary features and extend them so that you have more flexibility. You 
also end up getting so used to these features that you might wonder how 
you managed without them all this time! In fact, you can twist Excel into 
many positions, like a rubber band. This chapter is loaded with tips on how 
to get Excel to work (and stretch) in special ways.
Copying and Pasting
The first thing to consider when copying and pasting in Excel is to think 
about the nature of what you attempt to copy. Cells, cell ranges, and formu-
las are treated differently from other kinds of things, such as SmartArt and 
graphs. We start by copying cells, formulas, and ranges. After that, we see 
what happens when you copy other kinds of things.
 
If you’re not familiar with SmartArt and graphs, flip to Book I to read more 
about these shared Office features.
Simply copying and pasting
If you’re used to copying and pasting, you know that if you select some text 
and then copy and paste, the default settings paste the text, along with the 
text format — such as blue, bold, or italic.
Follow this simple example to copy and paste in Excel:
 
 1. Select a cell you want to copy and choose Edit➪Copy.
 
 
 Alternatively, you can press Ô-C or select Copy on the Standard toolbar.
 
 2. Click in the cell where you want to paste and choose Edit➪Paste.
 
 
 Alternatively, you can press Ô-V or select Paste on the Standard toolbar.

430
Copying and Pasting
 
 When you paste the cell, Excel shows a small widget (as shown in 
Figure 4-1). The Paste widget handles most of your pasting requirements, 
but it allows you to choose only a single option.
 
3. Click the widget.
 
 When copying and pasting, you have to click the widget before you start 
working in another cell; otherwise, the widget goes away. When you 
click, you can see all your pasting options. See Chapter 2 of this mini-
book for more about widgets.
 
Figure 4-1: 
Pasting the 
special way.
 
Pasting special
The Paste widget handles most of your ordinary pasting requirements, but 
it’s a one-shot deal — you can choose only a single option. On the other 
hand, Excel’s Paste Special feature lets you pick and choose exactly what 
individual or combination of attributes you want to paste. You can apply and 
then reapply Paste Special options to a cell to get the exact combinations of 
options you want. Follow these steps to use Paste Special:
 
1. Select the cell or object you want to copy and choose Edit➪Copy.
 
 Alternatively, you can press Ô-C or select Copy on the Standard toolbar.
 
2. Click in the cell where you want to paste and then choose Edit➪
Paste Special.
 
 If you select a cell or cell range in Step 1, the Paste Special dialog 
appears, as shown in Figure 4-2. If you select a different kind of object in 
Step 1, a different Paste Special dialog appears.
 
3. In the Paste section, select the option that you need.
 
 Figure 4-2 shows these options.
 
4. Click OK.
 
The Paste Link button becomes active, depending on what you copy and 
which option you chose in the Paste Special dialog. The Paste Link button 
creates a cell formula that refers to the cell you’re copying.

Turning rows into columns
Many times, you may wish you could easily change the layout of data 
from horizontal to vertical or vice versa. Fortunately, Excel’s Paste Special 
Transpose option does exactly that.
To change columns into rows quickly (see Figure 4-3):
 
1. Select a cell range and choose Edit➪Copy.
 
 Alternatively, you can press Ô-C or select Copy on the Standard toolbar.
 
2. Select a destination cell.
 
 This cell becomes the upper-left cell of the pasted range.
 
3. Choose Edit➪Paste Special.
 
 The Paste Special dialog opens.
 
4. Select the Transpose check box and then click OK.
 
 See Figure 4-3.

Copying and Pasting
Using Paste Special with objects
If you copy an object, rather than a cell or cell range, the dialog shown in 
Figure 4-2 appears when you choose Edit➪Paste Special.
In this Paste Special dialog, you can select from three different pasting for-
mats. The Paste Link and Display as Icon buttons are grayed out, meaning 
you can’t use them. We talk about these buttons in Chapter 5 of this mini-
book. Here’s a bit more about the three options from which you can choose:
 
✦ PDF (Portable Document Format): Adobe’s popular vector format. 
Depending on what you’re pasting, selecting this option might produce a 
vector, a low-resolution picture, or a blend of vector and picture to rep-
resent what you want to paste.
 
✦ Picture: A low-resolution picture of whatever you copied.
 
✦ Microsoft Drawing Object: Usually the same kind of object that you 
copied. Microsoft Drawing Object is the highest-quality Paste Special 
option.
Paste Special options differ, depending on what you copied. Charts, tables, 
and pictures all have their unique paste options.
 
You can Paste Special in Excel by using content that you copied from another 
open application, such as Word, PowerPoint, or even a Web browser.
Copying as a picture in the first place
You can easily copy a picture of an object, a cell, or a cell range, but you 
have to know about the secret Edit menu. Follow these steps to use the 
modified Edit menu:
 
1. Select a cell, a range of cells, or an object on a worksheet.
 
 A range of cells can include a mixture of cells and objects, or just cells.
 
2. Hold down the Shift key and click the Edit menu.
 
 Here’s the secret! When you hold down the Shift key, the Edit menu 
offers new choices, as shown in Figure 4-4.
 
3. Choose Edit➪Copy Picture.
 
 A small Copy Picture pane opens.
 
4. Click one of the choices:
 
• As Shown On Screen: What you see is what you get.
 
• As Shown When Printed: The picture is formatted based on your cur-
rent selections in Page Setup.
 
 Now, you have a picture on the Clipboard that you can use in Excel or 
any other application that can paste pictures.

Now you know one of Office’s best-kept secrets: Hold down the Shift key to 
modify some of the menus so that they offer more choices!
Moving and Copying Entire Sheets
 
Excel makes it easy to move and duplicate entire worksheets at a time, but 
you have to be careful with this Move or Copy tool. Don’t use this tool if 
you’re tired or distracted — you could wind up moving a whole lot of infor-
mation that you don’t want to move.
Before you even open the Move or Copy tool, decide which worksheet you 
want to move or copy. The active sheet is default, and you activate it by 
clicking the sheet tab. The selected sheet tabs are white. To move or copy a 
worksheet, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Edit➪Move or Copy Sheet.
 
 The Move or Copy dialog, as shown in Figure 4-5, opens.
 
2. In the To Book pop-up menu, choose the destination for the 
worksheet(s) you plan to move or copy.
 
 You can choose
 
• Within the Currently Active Workbook
 
• To Any Other Open Workbook
 
 The open workbooks are listed in the menu.
 
• To a Brand New Workbook

434
Creating Camera Magic
 
 The Before Sheet section lists all the sheets currently in the workbook. The 
sheets you move or copy are inserted in front of the sheet that you select.
 
3. (Optional) To make a copy (instead of moving the entire sheet), click 
the Create a Copy check box.
 
 If you don’t click this check box, Excel uses the default move behavior 
instead.
 
Figure 4-5: 
Moving and 
copying 
entire 
worksheets.
 
Click for new book or workbook.
Click to make copy.
 
If you’re not copying, but instead moving, consider the cell references and 
hyperlinks on the sheets you’re moving or copying. If you have references to 
other sheets, you may be creating links. When you’re done with the Move or 
Copy tool, choose Edit➪Links in the destination workbook. The Edit Links 
dialog appears. You can break unwanted links in the Edit Links dialog.
Creating Camera Magic
The Camera command creates a “picture” of a range of cells. “Picture” is in 
quotation marks because these pictures aren’t static; they’re dynamic — 
they change. Pictures are linked to the range you select, and they update 
when the range changes.
You can use the Camera command in a variety of ways:
 
✦ Display the calculation results of numbers or charts when the calcula-
tions and charts are on hidden worksheets (but not hidden rows or 
columns), other worksheets, or cell ranges that are offscreen. You can 
keep your formulas out of sight so unwanted visitors are less likely to 
tamper with them. Because the result is a linked picture, updated results 
are displayed automatically.

Book III
Chapter 4
Controlling Excel
435
Creating Camera Magic
 
✦ Precisely size and position the picture of the cell range. The Camera 
command creates an object that you can size and format like a picture. 
You can position the Camera picture anywhere on a worksheet.
 
✦ Position live snapshots of various ranges from distant places in a 
workbook. You can make them fit close together on a worksheet.
 
To hide a worksheet, choose Format➪Sheet➪Hide. To unhide a sheet, 
choose Format➪Sheet➪Unhide. The Format menu lets you hide and unhide 
rows and columns, too! After you hide a row or column, you must first select 
the surrounding rows or columns by using the dark arrow cursor in the row 
or column heading before you can unhide.
Customizing the Camera tool
Before you can use this magical tool, you have to turn it on. In Book I, we 
explain how to customize menus and toolbars. Here’s a quick refresher:
 
 1. Choose View➪Customize Menus and Toolbars.
 
 The Customize Menus and Toolbars dialog appears.
 
2. Click the Commands tab.
 
3. Drag the Camera command to any toolbar (or menu) and click OK.
Using the Camera tool
To use the Camera tool:
 
1. Drag over a range of cells with your mouse and then release it.
 
 Everything within the selection range becomes part of a Camera picture. 
Objects (such as graphs or PivotTables) completely within the selection 
area are included in the resulting Camera picture.
 
 2. Click the Camera button on the toolbar (or select Camera from the menu 
if you put the command on a menu, as discussed in the preceding sec-
tion).
 
 The cursor changes to a plus sign (+).
 
3. Move the mouse cursor to a new location and then drag the mouse to 
create a Camera picture.
 
 The new location can be
 
• On the same worksheet
 
• Another worksheet in the same workbook
 
• A worksheet in another open workbook (which creates a link)
When using the Camera option, the new location shouldn’t overlap the 
original selection range.

436
Nesting and Nest Building
Nesting and Nest Building
A beautiful Andorinha-dáurica bird builds nests with multiple chambers. Not 
unlike this bird, you can make a nest with multiple chambers right in Excel. 
To make your nests, use parentheses within your cell formulas.
 
If you want Excel to control calculation order, put what you want calculated 
first within parentheses (called nesting) inside your cell formula.
First things first
You might want to nest a formula so that you can control the order in which 
calculations are completed, which is precedence.
 
Here’s the order in which each part of the formula is calculated:
 
✦ Innermost parentheses to outermost parentheses
 
✦ Multiplication and division
 
✦ Addition and subtraction
 
✦ Left to right
Precedence can be illustrated by the simple examples in Figure 4-6:
 
✦ In row 2, parentheses (2 × 3) cause multiplication to happen first.
 
✦ In row 3, parentheses (5 + 2) force the addition to happen first.
As shown in Figure 4-6, the same numbers and operations in each formula result 
in entirely different values when those operations have different precedence.
 
Figure 4-6: 
Operations 
in paren-
theses take 
precedence.
 
Applying some logic
The Excel IF formula enables you to perform logical operations:
IF (a condition is met) THEN (do this) ELSE (do something else).

Book III
Chapter 4
Controlling Excel
437
Nesting and Nest Building
Figure 4-7 shows a simple example of an IF formula — =IF(A1=1,TRUE,
FALSE) — which means, “If the value of cell A1 is equal to 1, the logical 
value of the cell is TRUE; if cell A1 isn’t equal to 1, the logical value of cell A1 is 
FALSE.” In this formula, the parentheses simply provide clarity.
 
Figure 4-7: 
Making 
simple logic.
 
The nested IF statement in Figure 4-8 — =IF(A2>=90,”A”,IF(A2>=80,
”B”,”C”)) — wants to display a letter grade based on a student’s numeric 
score. The formula means, “First, if the student attains a score of 80 or 
higher, the student gets a B; next, if the score is 90 or higher the student gets 
an A; finally, any score that’s lower than 80 gets a C.”
 
You can display text as the result of an IF formula, as long as you put quota-
tion marks around the text.
 
Figure 4-8: 
Nesting for 
logic, clarity, 
and brevity.
 
When nesting in a formula, you need the same number of open parentheses 
as closed parentheses — use parentheses in pairs. Excel helps you by color-
coding pairs of parentheses in your formula while you type.
You don’t have a specific limit as to how many sets of parentheses you can 
nest within a formula, but it’s usually less than 13 pairs. However, because 
the final ELSE can refer to another cell’s value, which can have even more 
nesting, you really don’t have a limit to the number of nests you can have in 
a chain.
If we take our earlier example to another nested option, it might look like 
this: =IF(A9>=90,”A”,IF(A9>=80,”B”,IF(A9>=50,”C”,”D”))).
Now, the formula means, “First, if the student attains a score of 50 or higher, 
the student gets a C; next, if the score is between 50 and 80, the student gets 
a B; next, if the student score is between 80 and 90, the student gets an A; 
finally, any score that’s lower than 50 gets a D.”

Correcting Errors
Correcting Errors
The idea of errors is a misnomer. In actuality, these so-called errors are just 
messages from Excel, saying it had trouble doing what you asked. We tackle 
the most common error messages.
Getting rid of hash marks
The error message you’re most likely to see is a set of hash marks in a cell 
(see Figure 4-9). These marks simply mean the cell isn’t wide enough to dis-
play a value that’s the result of a formula. You can cure hash marks in three 
ways:
 
Figure 4-9: 
Making a 
cell larger 
gets rid of 
hash marks.
 
Drag the divider to the right.
 
✦ Widen the column by dragging or double-clicking the column divider. 
You use the double-arrow cursor, described in Chapter 2 of this minibook.
 
✦ Merge the cell with another to make enough room. Chapter 3 in this 
minibook explains merging cells.
 
✦ Change the number format to show fewer decimal places by using 
the Formatting Palette. Chapter 3 in this minibook tells how to change 
formatting.
Circular references
After working for a while within Excel, you have many formulas on sheets 
that take values from other formulas, which is a good thing. While you make 
worksheets more and more complex, you’re likely to accidentally link cells 
so that you have an endless loop. Excel dubs this predicament a circular 
reference.
Fixing circular references
If you do accidentally make a circular reference, a warning appears, threat-
ening you with dire consequences. Okay, we made that up, but Excel does 
come darn close to that!

Book III
Chapter 4
Controlling Excel
439
Correcting Errors
If you do get such a warning, you may not remember where in the chain you 
went wrong. If you want to wait ’til later to investigate, you can continue. If 
you do, Excel makes a big deal about it. Excel simultaneously highlights all 
the cells in the chain, opens the Excel Help topic on how to get rid of circular 
references, and turns on the Circular References toolbar, hoping that you 
can analyze your formulas and get rid of the circular reference.
In Figure 4-10, we set three cells equal to each other, creating a circular refer-
ence, for your viewing pleasure! And, of course, it’s so much fun to see Excel 
panic.
 
Figure 4-10: 
Tracing a 
circular 
reference.
 
Keeping your circular reference
If you insist, we show you how you can force Excel to allow you to keep your 
circular reference. But you have to pay a ransom: You have to tell Excel how 
many times you want Excel to perform the calculation (the number of itera-
tions) before it exits the endless loop.
To specify your iterations, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Excel➪Preferences (see Figure 4-11).
 
 The Preferences pane opens.
 
 2. Click the Calculation option.
 
 
 Calculation preferences appear.
 
3. In the Iteration area, select the Limit Iteration check box.
 
4. Set the number of iterations you want Excel to perform before exiting 
the loop.
Clearing #DIV/0
You get the #DIV/0 message if a formula is asked to divide a number by 0. 
Remember your math class? You can’t divide by 0. You can intercept this 
error message and display something a bit more informative.

440
Correcting Errors
 
Say you want to test cell B7 for the #DIV/0 error. You might put a cell for-
mula that uses both IF and ISERROR functions into a nearby cell: 
=IF(ISERROR(B7),”Please change your entry.”,B7).
 
Figure 4-11: 
Forcing 
Excel to 
calculate 
a circular 
reference.
 
Other error messages
 
 You encounter other cell messages less frequently. You can get details about 
them by searching Excel Help for error messages.
 
Excel puts little green triangles that have error messages associated with 
them into cells, and sometimes those triangles can be annoying, rather than 
helpful. You can turn them off entirely or select the kinds of things you want 
to be notified about: Choose Excel➪Preferences➪Error Checking.
Finding the Analysis ToolPak
In previous versions of Excel, to activate cer-
tain functions, you had to turn on the Analysis 
ToolPak Excel add-ins. In Excel 2008, you don’t 
have that bother because the functions are now 
built-in. A consequence of losing VBA (Visual 
Basic for Applications) in Excel 2008 is the 
loss of wizards based on the Analysis ToolPak. 
Mac MVPs recommend the following Web 
site as a replacement for some of these tools:

C
harts are an Excel strongpoint. Students, businesses, scientists, news 
organizations, economists, and many other groups use charts. When 
you make charts in Office 2008, you find a brand-new charting engine that 
gleams with the latest Microsoft charting technology.
 
The terms chart and graph are interchangeable. We stick with chart, while 
acknowledging when graph is the preferred term.
Because the chart feature of Excel is now common to Word, Excel, and 
PowerPoint, we cover most aspects of charts in Book I, Chapter 5. If certain 
terms here seem foreign to you, we recommend that you flip to that chapter 
before you dive into this one. However, if you’ve worked with charts before, 
you might be familiar with chart basics. This chapter focuses primarily on 
aspects of charts that are unique to working with them in Microsoft Excel.
Making a Chart
In Excel, making a chart is a one-click operation after you perform a mini-
mal amount of setup. It’s hard to imagine an easier way to create charts, as 
shown in Figure 5-1. Follow these steps:
 
1. Select a data range.
 
2. Click the Charts tab of Elements Gallery.
 
 
 If Elements Gallery isn’t visible, choose View➪Elements Gallery or click 
Gallery on the Standard toolbar.

3. In Gallery, click the chart type you want to create.
 
4. Click the specific chart variant.
 
 Each chart type has several variants available. For example, some of the 
variants in the bar type chart are Clustered Bar, Stacked Bar, and so on.
 
 The chart appears on the worksheet, and the Chart menu is now acti-
vated in the menu bar at the top of the screen.
 
 Congratulations! You made a great-looking chart in a jiffy!
 
If you’ve worked with charts in Word and PowerPoint and watched Excel 
appear to do the charts for those programs, you may discover you can more 
easily make charts in Excel, rather than Word or PowerPoint, because you 
don’t have to keep track of which program is running. You can see your data 
and the chart together in Excel.
Choosing the Chart’s Location
Charts can live happily on the worksheet that has the data, which is where 
they’re born. Like other objects, you can cut, copy, and paste them to other 
locations; and you can add them to the Scrapbook, which we discuss in 
Book I, Chapter 4.

Choosing the Chart’s Location
Excel also has a special kind of worksheet called a chart sheet that you can 
use to showcase a chart. A chart sheet can have only one thing: a single 
chart. On a chart sheet, you can format the chart by using the same tools as 
when you have the chart on a conventional worksheet. If you want to move 
the chart back onto a worksheet, you can use the Move Chart tool again.
Moving to a chart sheet
To move a chart to a chart sheet, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the chart.
 
 Selecting the chart activates the Chart menu.
 
2. Choose Chart➪Move Chart.
 
 The Move Chart dialog opens, as shown in Figure 5-2.
 
3. Click the New Sheet radio button.
 
4. In the New Sheet text box, type a name for the Chart Sheet tab.
 
5. Click OK.
 
Figure 5-2: 
Moving 
a chart 
to a new 
residence.
 
Instantly, your chart appears as a full sheet on a new tab that has the name 
you typed in the Move Chart dialog. The source data remains on the work-
sheet, and the data is still linked to the chart. If the data changes, the chart 
is updated instantly, even if the data is the result of a formula or a query.
Copying to Microsoft Word and PowerPoint
Because working with charts in Excel is less confusing than in Word or 
PowerPoint, you’ll be glad to know that it’s easy to move your charts to 
either program. Easy is good!
Using the Scrapbook
We think using the Scrapbook is the easiest way to copy charts from Excel to 
Word or PowerPoint. You don’t have to open the destination document when 
you add the chart to the Scrapbook, and the chart remains in the Scrapbook, 

444
Choosing the Chart’s Location
in case you want to paste it again. When you paste from the Scrapbook, the 
default result is a drawing object, which you can format as desired.
This is a two-stage expedition. In the first stage, you start in Excel and copy 
the chart to the Scrapbook. Figure 5-3 shows the copied chart in Scrapbook. 
In the second stage, you switch to Word or PowerPoint, and then paste your 
chart from Scrapbook into your Word document or PowerPoint slide. Follow 
these steps to perform the entire procedure:
 
 1. Click the Scrapbook button in the Toolbox.
 
 
 If the Toolbox palette isn’t visible, click the Toolbox button on the 
Standard toolbar to display it.
 
 2. On your worksheet, select the chart you want to copy.
 
 3. Click the Add button on the Scrapbook palette of the Toolbox.
 
 
 A copy of your chart appears in the Scrapbook.
 
4. Open the Word document or PowerPoint slide in which you want to 
place the chart.
 
5. In the Scrapbook, select the chart you want to paste.
 
 You may have to turn on Scrapbook in Word as well. Just follow the 
same procedure we describe in Step 1.
 
 6. Click the Paste button.
 
 
 The chart is now in your destination document.
 
Figure 5-3: 
Putting 
Scrapbook 
to work.
 
 
If the Scrapbook method works well for you, skip to the section “Applying 
Error Bars,” later in this chapter. But if you need more options, or if you’re 
just curious, go ahead and read the following sections.
Going from Excel to Word
Fortunately, the process of copying Excel charts into Word is straightfor-
ward. Follow these steps:

Book III
Chapter 5
Heavenly Charting
445
Choosing the Chart’s Location
 
1. Make sure that Word and Excel are open.
 
 In Excel, the currently open workbook needs to contain the chart you 
want to copy to Word.
 
2. Select the chart in Excel.
 
 Click the chart’s border to select it.
 
 3. Choose Edit➪Copy.
 
 
 Alternatively, you can press Ô-C or choose Copy on the Standard toolbar.
 
 4. Switch to the Microsoft Word document.
 
 Use the Dock or press Ô-Tab.
 
5. Choose Edit➪Paste.
 
 Or you can press Ô-V.
 
 If you prefer, you can choose Edit➪Paste Special to open the Paste 
Special dialog (see Figure 5-4), which offers you more paste formats and 
link options. Each time you select a different combination of format and 
paste options, the description in the Result section interactively updates 
so that you know what will happen when you click OK. Click OK to con-
firm your selection.
 
6. Click the small widget in the lower-right corner of the chart.
 
 A drop-down menu appears, as shown in Figure 5-5.

7. Select how you want the chart to behave while it’s living in your Word 
document.
 
 You can format the chart in several ways:
 
• Paste as Picture: Pastes a picture representation of the chart.
 
• Excel Chart (Entire Workbook): Pastes a copy of the entire workbook 
as an embedded OLE object into the Word document, displaying the 
chart. Chart colors and fonts adopt document theme colors if you’ve 
already applied a theme to the document. See Book II, Chapter 5 for 
information on working with embedded charts.
 
• Chart (Linked to Data): Pastes a chart object linked to the Excel 
source workbook, which remains an independent Excel file.
 
• Keep Source Formatting: Same as the Excel Chart (Entire Workbook) 
option, except Word ignores existing document theme colors and 
retains the source colors and fonts.
 
• Use Destination Theme: Same as Excel Chart (Entire Workbook), the 
chart adopts the Word document’s theme.
 
8. Click outside the drop-down list to close the widget.
 
By default, the chart object is linked to the Excel data source, using the cur-
rently applied Office theme in Word.
Going from Excel to PowerPoint
You can copy and paste from an Excel worksheet to a PowerPoint presenta-
tion. Follow these steps:
 
1. Open PowerPoint and Excel.
 
 In Excel, the currently open workbook should contain the chart you 
want to copy to Word.
 
2. Select the chart in Excel.
 
 Click the chart’s border to select it.
 
 3. Choose Edit➪Copy.
 
 
 Alternatively, you can press Ô-C or select Copy on the Standard toolbar.

4. Switch to the PowerPoint presentation and navigate to the slide on 
which you want to place the chart.
 
 Use the Dock or press Ô-Tab.
 
5. Choose Edit➪Paste.
 
 Alternatively, you can press Ô-V.
 
 Alternatively (again!), you can choose Edit➪Paste Special. In the Paste 
Special dialog, you can select from every possible paste operation, as 
shown in Figure 5-6. The Result section of Paste Special describes what 
you get if you click OK. Click OK to confirm your selection.
 
 PowerPoint displays your chart. By default, the chart is linked to the 
Excel workbook as the data source.
 
In PowerPoint, you can open the source Excel file by selecting the chart 
object and choosing Edit➪Edit in Excel. The source workbook must be 
closed (not already open in Excel) for this option to work.

Applying Error Bars
 
The first shipments of Office 2008 didn’t include error bars. If you don’t have 
the Error Bar feature, choose Help➪Check for Updates to bring your copy of 
Office up to date.
 
Many 2D chart types support error bars, which are little visual indicators 
of the statistically calculated error rate for a data set, although we wonder 
whether they’d make good candy bars!
Candy bars aside, look at Figure 5-7, where we double-clicked a bar in the 
chart to display the Format Data Series dialog. Yes, Excel can now compute 
the standard error for you and display it on your charts!

Making a Gantt Chart
 
A Gantt chart is a special bar chart that shows the timeline of a project. We 
bring up Gantt charts because some people think that you need some other 
program besides Excel to make Gantt charts, such as Microsoft Project. Well, 
you don’t need to have Microsoft Project to make Gantt charts — Excel can 
also make them, although not automatically.
Instructions that describe how to make a simple Gantt chart are in Excel 
Help. Just search Help for Gantt chart.
 
If you want instructions on how to make advanced Gantt charts, Excel MVP 
Jon Peltier has a site with all the details: http://peltiertech.com/

Making a Histogram
Histograms visually show the number of occurrences (or frequency of repeti-
tion) of values proportionally in a column or a row. Because Excel no longer 
includes a Histogram tool, a lot of people are seeking a workaround for 
making histograms in Excel.
 
If you don’t know exactly what a histogram is, you can look it up! Choose 
Tools➪Dictionary. The Reference Tools dialog appears. In the search field, 
type histogram and then press Return to display results for both Encarta 
Encyclopedia and Dictionary. Click disclosure triangles to display additional 

Book III

results. Click hyperlinks for even more information. You need an active 
Internet connection to use the Dictionary.
 
 You’ll need to have access to the Object Palette in the Toolbox. If it’s not 
already visible, click the Toolbox button on the Standard toolbar. Then in the 
Toolbox, select Object Palette.
You can make a histogram in Excel either by using cell formulas or charts. 
Regardless of which method you use, follow these steps to begin making 
your histogram:
 
1. Click the plus sign (+) worksheet tab to open a new, blank worksheet 
in Excel.
 
2. Choose View➪Normal.
 
 The worksheet appears in Normal View.
 
3. Type Values into cell A2 and Frequency into cell A3, as shown in 
Figure 5-8.
 
4. Fill in row 2 with the values from Figure 5-8, beginning with cell B2.
 
 In this step, you can use your own data, rather than the example values.
 
5. In cell B3, enter the formula =COUNTIF($B$2:$K$2,B2).
 
 Be sure to type it exactly!
 
 This formula counts how many times the number in the cell directly 
above it appears in the absolute range $B$2:$K$2. In this example, that 
range includes the values we typed into row 2 in Step 4.
 
 When using your own data, substitute the rightmost column letter of 
your own data in row 2 for column letter K in the preceding formula. 
Be sure to retain the dollar signs ($). Ignore the error widget, if one 
appears.
 
6. Select cell B3.
 
7. Drag the fill handle of cell B3 to the right until you reach the cell at 
the end of the range of data.
 
 This cell is K3 in the example.
 
 The number of times each value appears in the row now appears 
beneath each number in the Values row.
To make your histogram by using cell formulas, check out the following sec-
tion. If you want to use a chart for your histogram, skip ahead to the section, 
“Making a histogram by using a chart,” later in this chapter.

Making a histogram by using cell formulas
After you complete the steps in the preceding section, follow these steps to 
produce a histogram by using cell formulas:
 
1. Select cell B1.
 
2. Type the formula =REPT(“+”,B3).
 
 To type the ➪ symbol, follow these steps:
 
a. Type the rest of the formula first.
 
b. Click to put the cursor between the quotation marks.
 
c. On the Object Palette, click All Shapes and choose Shapes from the 
pop-up menu that appears (see Figure 5-9).
 
d. On the Symbols tab, select the arrow shape.
 
 Note: Not every shape option can be added to a formula.

3. Stop when you get to the cell at the end of the range of data, which is 
K1 in the example in Figure 5-8.
 
 The shape doesn’t look right because the symbols are horizontal, rather 
than vertical.
 
4. With the range you filled still selected, switch the Toolbox to the 
Formatting Palette by clicking the Formatting Palette button, as 
shown in Figure 5-9.

Making a histogram by using a chart
 
This section is strictly for the serious chart maker.
Complete the steps in the section, “Making a histogram by using cell formulas,” 
earlier in this chapter and then follow these steps:
 
1. Select the entire range of cells that contains the tested data and the 
cell formula results.
 
 Include the row labels in your selection.
 
 To follow our example, select cell range A2:K3.
 
2. In Elements Gallery, choose Charts➪Column➪Clustered Column.
 
 
 If Elements Gallery isn’t visible, choose View➪Elements Gallery.
 
 3. Click any one of the bars representing values.
 
 The Values bars are the taller bars. All the Values bars become selected, 
as shown in Figure 5-11, and selection handles appear. The Values row 
becomes highlighted.
 
4. Press the Delete key.
 
 The Values bars disappear, leaving the Frequency bars visible.
 
 Now, look across the bottom of your chart. The X axis isn’t right.

5. On the menu bar, choose Chart➪Source Data.
 
 The Select Data Source dialog opens.
 
 The Category (X) Axis Labels field in the lower-right corner of this dialog 
is blank. You need to fill in that field, but Excel won’t let you type in it. 
You have to click the selection button next to the field.
 
6. Click the button next to the Category (X) Axis Labels field.
 
7. Drag over the cell range in row 2 that contains the values, but doesn’t 
include the cell that contains the label.
 
 If you’re following our example, select the range B2:K2.
 
 While you drag, Excel types the cell range for you. When you’re done, 
the entry should be similar to what you see in Figure 5-12. The ToolTip 
tells you what row and column you’ve selected. (In this case, 1R x 10C 
means you’ve selected 1 row by 10 columns.)

 Congratulations! For all practical purposes, the histogram chart is done at 
this stage. Some fussbudgets may insist that we’re not done yet because 
we have too much space between the bars on the chart. So, we finish the 
job to make them happy, too. See Figure 5-15.

Versatile with Excel
In This Chapter
✓ Flagging tasks for follow-up
✓ Creating forms
✓ Making and using form templates
✓ Getting Excel and the Web working together
W
hen it comes to versatility, Excel shines very brightly. This chapter 
compiles a variety of very different things that Excel can do for 
you. Think of this as a secrets drawer that’s filled with ideas and tips. We 
hope that you find useful and interesting things that you didn’t know about. 
Explore this chapter just for the fun of it.
We start this chapter by showing you how to set reminders. Making input 
forms gets our attention next, followed by a discussion of how Excel inte-
grates with Web technologies.
Helping You Remember
Excel is part of a powerful Office suite in which the applications are inte-
grated with each other. The Office suite includes My Day and Entourage 
Calendar features in Entourage, which we talk about in Book V. Excel takes 
advantage of both these features with Excel’s Flag for Follow Up feature.
 
 Choose Tools➪Flag for Follow Up to add a task to your Entourage Tasks list; 
see Figure 6-1. Flag for Follow Up’s default prompts you to select a date and 
time when you want to be reminded about your workbook.
You can leave it at that, or you can switch to Entourage’s Task feature and 
do all kinds of fancy things with your Excel reminders. Figure 6-2 shows 
where your Excel flags are saved in Entourage, and we hope it entices you to 
consider investigating our Entourage and Project Center minibooks (Books 
V and VI, respectively).

Preparing Your Forms
When you create a form, versatility and control are top priorities. You need 
versatility to precisely place words and empty fields, and you need control 
to make sure that entries are validated against rules that you make.
We want to point out the most important reason that Excel is a great tool for 
making forms: You can use the full range of Excel’s powerful worksheet func-
tions when you design your forms. The Formula Builder (which we discuss 
in Chapter 2 of this minibook) can help you build forms that use worksheet 
functions.
Customizing the Forms toolbar
When you create forms in Excel, you use the Forms toolbar extensively. You 
can enhance Excel’s Forms toolbar. Follow these steps to add buttons to the 
Forms toolbar:
 
1. Turn on the Forms toolbar by choosing View➪Toolbars➪Forms.
 
 The Forms toolbar appears.
 
2. Choose View➪Customize Menus and Toolbars.
 
 The Customize Menus and Toolbars dialog appears. See Book I, Chapter 3.

9. Click OK.
 
 The Customize Menus and Toolbars dialog closes.
Tabbing in a form
 
Pressing the Tab key takes the cursor from one form field to the next. This is 
a very convenient feature for filling in forms.
To make this feature work, you need to have different conditions in place at 
the same time:
 
✦ The worksheet must be protected.
 
✦ The form fields must be unlocked and all other cells must be locked.
Protecting and unprotecting a worksheet
When you work with forms, you’ll be turning worksheet protection on and 
off frequently.

460
Making Your Own Form Templates
 
You must turn off protection when you want to build a form. Turning off pro-
tection also activates the Forms toolbar and Toolbox features, and allows 
you to edit worksheet content. When you’re done building the form, you 
must turn on protection so that people can tab through the fields (cells that 
you set as unlocked) and you can activate form controls (discussed in the 
section, “Restricting entry with form controls,” later in this chapter).
Turn on protection by following these steps:
 
1. Click the Protect Sheet button on the customized Forms toolbar.
 
 Clicking the Protect Sheet icon, as shown in Figure 6-3, toggles protec-
tion on and off. The Protect Sheet dialog opens when you toggle on pro-
tection, as shown in Figure 6-4.
 
2. Select the Contents check box.
 
 You must select the Contents check box if you want to protect the work-
sheet so that the Tab key works. Usually you just leave all the check 
boxes selected.
 
Figure 6-4: 
Protecting a 
worksheet.
 
While you’re working on a form, you don’t need to use a password, but if you 
like, you can password-protect your worksheet’s forms.
Making Your Own Form Templates
Often, you can easily create a form from a tightly spaced grid. In a grid, you 
can easily place form elements, such as text and form controls, right where 
you want them.
By following these steps, you can create two grids, one landscape and one 
portrait, and save them as templates (which you can reuse whenever you 
want — look for them in Project Gallery under the My Templates category):
 
1. Open a new, blank workbook.
 
 2. If you don’t see the Formatting Palette, click the Toolbox button on 
the Standard toolbar to turn it on.

Return to select the cell range.
 
 Choose View➪Formula Bar to open the Formula Bar, if it’s not visible 
already.
 
5. Press Return to select the cell range.
 
6. While the cell range is still selected, choose Format➪Column➪
Column Width.
 
 The Column Width dialog appears.
 
7. Enter 0.18 in the text field and click OK.
 
 The value in inches is 0.18. If your system is set to use centimeters 
instead, use 0.46 as the value.
 
8. Choose File➪Save As.
 
 The Save As dialog appears.
 
9. Change the Format pop-up to Excel Template (.xltx).
 
 The Save location automatically changes to My Templates, which is the 
correct location to use.
 
10. Type Form Template Landscape in the Save As text box.
 
11. Click the Save button.
 
 You can save a portrait version, too. Follow these steps:
 
a. With the file open, click the Portrait button on the Formatting Palette.
 
b. Choose File➪Save As.
 
 The Save As dialog appears
 
c. Type Form Template Portrait in the Save As text box.
 
d. Click the Save button.
 
 The Save As dialog closes.
 
12. Choose File➪Close.
Using Your Form Templates
If you need to, you can adjust the row height and column width in your 
forms. By default, all the cells are locked. You need to unlock cells that you 
want to use as input fields.

462
Using Your Form Templates
 
Merge and unmerge cells by clicking the Merge Cells button on the Formatting 
Palette. Lock and unlock cells by first selecting them and then clicking the 
Lock toggle button that you can add to the customized Forms toolbar.
Making ordinary form fields
Try making a simple input form field by using one of the templates you can 
create in the section, “Making Your Own Form Templates,” earlier in this 
chapter. In this example, you can make the Last Name form input field, as 
shown in Figure 6-5. Follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪Project Gallery.
 
 Project Gallery appears. Select the New tab if it isn’t already selected.
 
2. In the My Templates category, select either form template that you 
save in the section, “Making Your Own Form Templates,” earlier in 
this chapter.
 
3. Type a form field input label in the grid.
 
 We typed Last Name in cell A2.
 
4. Select a range of cells nicely sized for the input field.
 
 We selected the cell range F2:N2.
 
5. On the Formatting Palette, select the Merge Cells check box.
 
 The Merge Cells option appears in the Indentation and Merge section 
under Alignments and Spacing.

6. On the Formatting Palette, click the Bottom Border button.
 
 The button is below Borders and Shading, in the Borders section.
 
 If you click the double row of dots at the top of the Borders section, the 
Borders toolbar becomes a floating toolbar. It’s handy to use when creat-
ing forms because it’s so simple to move the toolbar around.
 
7. Click the Lock button on the Forms toolbar.
 
 The cell unlocks, which makes it a form field that a user can tab to, even 
when you have protection turned on. The Lock button is a toggle button. 
When it’s depressed, it’s locked; when it’s not depressed, it’s unlocked.
Restricting entry with data validation
It’s always a good thing when you can help people fill out your form. One 
way to lend a helping hand is to make it harder for them to make mistakes 
when filling out the form. For example, by using data validation, you can 
make sure that someone enters a date into a Date field. Follow these steps to 
use validation:
 
1. Select a field (an unlocked or merged cell).
 
2. Choose Data➪Validation.
 
 The Data Validation dialog opens (see Figure 6-6).
 
3. On the Settings tab, choose a setting from the Allow pop-up menu.
 
 Data Validation is an interactive dialog — its options change, depending 
on what you decide to allow. You can allow
 
• Any Value: Allow any character, word, number, or combination.
 
• Whole Number: Apply logical operators and restrict entry to whole 
numbers.
 
• Decimal Number: Apply logical operators and restrict entry to deci-
mal numbers.
 
• List: Allow entries from a cell range that you specify on the same work-
sheet. Click the button to the right of the Source field and then drag 
over the criteria list. Select the In-Cell Dropdown check box to display 
the list that the selected cell range contains in a drop-down list.
 
• Date: Apply logical operators and restrict entry to dates. See Figure 6-7.
 
• Time: Apply logical operators and restrict entry to time values.
 
• Text length: Apply logical operators and restrict entry by the length 
of the input string.
 
• Custom: Restrict entry based on a cell formula.
 
 If you select the Ignore Blank check box, an input field needs to be filled

Restricting entry with form controls
You can find Excel’s form controls on the Forms toolbar (see Figure 6-10). The 
controls on this toolbar are objects that float above the worksheet in layers. 
Follow these general steps to use a toolbar form control on a worksheet:
 
1. Select a control from the Forms toolbar.
 
 The mouse cursor becomes a plus sign (+).
 
2. Drag the mouse on your worksheet where you want to place the control.
 
 The Form control that you selected appears on the worksheet.
 
3. Adjust settings for the Format control in the form’s dialog.
 
 You can now use the form control when worksheet protection is on.

466
Using Your Form Templates
 
Like with locked and unlocked cells, you must turn protection on to activate 
form controls and turn protection off to create and edit those controls.
You can choose from the following Forms toolbar controls:
 
✦ Group Box: Drag a group box around form controls that you want to 
behave as a group relative to each other.
 
✦ Button: When a user clicks this button, a macro runs. Macros created 
with Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) won’t run in Excel 2008.
 
✦ Check Box: You can link the condition of the check box (checked or 
unchecked) to a cell on the worksheet. Use a check box control for 
multiple-choice answers to tests and surveys where the user can select 
more than one option within a group of suggested answers.
 
✦ Option Button: This control is better known as a radio button. You can 
link the condition (selected or not) to a cell on the worksheet. Use this 
control for multiple-choice answers to tests and surveys where the user 
can select only one option from a group of options. Use this control with 
the Group Box control.
 
✦ List Box: Drag a list box onto a worksheet, and then select a cell range 
from a column to populate the list box. When you click the box, a pop-up 
menu displays the list of inputs from the cell range. Users are restricted 
to choosing from the list. 
 
✦ Scroll Bar: This control creates a scroll bar that you can use to select a 
numeric value. The value chosen is in a linked cell.
 
✦ Spin Button: Users can select a number by clicking Increase and 
Decrease buttons. The value chosen is in a linked cell.
 
✦ Control Properties: Select a form control and then click this button 
to open the control’s dialog, where you can change its behavior and 
appearance.
 
✦ Toggle Grid: Toggles worksheet grid lines off and on.
 
✦ Grayed-out controls: You can use these controls only on Excel 5.0 
dialog sheets. You can create an Excel 5.0 dialog sheet in Excel 2008, but 
because Excel 2008 has no VBA programming language to go along with 
it, you can’t do anything with an Excel 5.0 dialog sheet.
The following example shows how to place radio buttons onto a worksheet 
and then use a group box so that Excel knows this particular group of radio 
buttons provide a single answer to a question. Create option buttons by fol-
lowing these steps:

Using Your Form Templates
 
1. Choose View➪Toolbars➪Forms.
 
 The Forms toolbar opens.
 
2. On the Forms toolbar, select the Option Button control.
 
 The mouse cursor becomes a plus sign (+).
 
3. On the worksheet, drag to position the option button.
 
 An Option Button control includes the button itself, plus a text box into 
which you can type. You could fill in the text box portion with one of the 
choices for a multiple-choice question, for example.
 
4. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 for each option button.
 
 You need to have at least two option buttons to be able to use them. 
If you have only one set of option buttons on a worksheet, you don’t 
have to group them. If you have two or more sets of option buttons on 
a sheet, use group boxes to surround each group of buttons so that the 
groups of buttons function independently as units answering individual 
questions.
 
 If you want to group buttons, go to Step 5. If you don’t, you’re done!
 
5. Click the Group Box button in the Forms toolbar.
 
 The mouse cursor becomes a plus sign (+).
 
6. Drag a box around each set of buttons that you want to make into 
separate groups.
 
 See Figure 6-10 for a sample arrangement. You can rename the Group 
Box by clicking its name. You can delete the name if you want to have 
just a border.

Getting the Web into Excel
To assign a cell to a form control that’s linked to a cell, use the Control tab of 
the Format Control dialog, which you display by right-clicking a control and 
selecting Format Control from the pop-up menu (as shown in Figure 6-11). In 
the Cell Link field, enter the cell that you want to display the control’s state, 
or click the selector button to the right of the input field to select the cell by 
using the mouse.

Getting the Web into Excel
You have several ways to get information — primarily tables — into Excel. 
If you’re a convert from Windows, you’ll find that the ability to browse Web 
pages isn’t in the Mac version of Excel. Nevertheless, you have other ways to 
get tables from Web pages into Excel for Mac.
Copying and pasting
The good old copy-and-paste method is the instinctive way to take Web page 
information from a browser and get it into Excel. See Chapter 5 of this mini-
book for more information about copying and pasting (or pasting special).
 
Be sure to check the Web page you’re working with. Many pages that have 
financial, census, and other tabular information offer links to download in 
Excel format. If the option is offered, take it!

Book III
Chapter 6
Becoming Versatile

Getting the Web into Excel
Using a Web query
Excel can try to load tables from a Web page directly from the Internet via 
a Web query process. A Web query is simple: It’s just a Web-page address 
saved as a text file, using the .iqy, rather than .txt, file extension.
You can easily make Web queries for Microsoft Excel in Microsoft Word. 
Follow these steps:
 
1. Go to a Web page that has the Web tables that you want to put in 
Excel.
 
2. Highlight the Web address in the address field.
 
3. Choose Edit➪Copy.
 
4. Switch to Microsoft Word and open a new document.
 
 Launch Word if it’s not open already.
 
5. Choose Edit➪Paste.
 
 The URL is pasted into the Word document.
 
6. In Word, choose File➪Save As.
 
 The Save As dialog appears.
 
7. Click Format and choose Plain Text (.txt) from the pop-up menu that 
appears.
 
8. Type a filename, replacing .txt with .iqy as the file extension.
 
 Don’t use the .txt extension. The .iqy file extension signifies that the 
file is a Web query for Microsoft Excel.
 
 If you encounter the File Conversion dialog, as shown in Figure 6-12, 
click OK to accept the default settings.
 
9. Select the Documents folder.
 
10. Click the Save button.
After you save your Web query, follow these steps to run the Web query:
 
1. Open Excel.
 
2. Choose Data➪Get External Data➪Run Saved Query.
 
3. Open the .iqy file you saved in Word.
Excel attempts to open the Web page for you, which creates a query range 
and turns on the Database toolbar.

470
Getting the Web into Excel
 
Figure 6-12: 
Saving a 
Web query.
 
We explain how to use query ranges and the Database toolbar in Chapter 7 of 
this minibook. Excel can use only HTML tables, not pictures of tables, Adobe 
Flash, PDF, or other formats.
Opening a saved Web page
Web browsers let you save Web pages from their File menus. Follow these 
steps:
 
1. Save a Web page to some place on your hard drive that you’ll remember.
 
2. In Excel, choose File➪Open in Excel.
 
 The Open dialog appears.
 
3. Navigate or use Spotlight to select the saved Web page.
 
4. Click Open to open the saved Web page in Excel.
 
Opening a saved Web page in Excel has the advantage over a Web query 
because you save the content to your computer, so it won’t disappear, like 
Web pages are prone to do.

Getting Excel onto the Web
Getting Excel onto the Web
You have several ways to distribute Excel workbooks on the Web:
 
✦ Share workbooks with the entire world by putting them into freely acces-
sible Web sites.
 
✦ Put workbooks into more restrictive environments by using the following:
 
• Limited-access Web services, such as OfficeLive, Google Docs, and 
Mesh.com
 
• Course-management systems, such as Blackboard or Angel
Any way you do it, you need two things:
 
✦ An Internet-accessible file location
 
✦ The know-how to get your workbook to that location
Preparing a workbook for the Web
You can easily make links. However, consider whether these links will con-
tinue to work after you distribute your workbook.
 
In most cases, you don’t want to have links in a document that you distrib-
ute in case some don’t work. Resolve your links before putting them on the 
Web by following these steps:
 
1. Open your workbook in Excel.
 
2. Choose Edit➪Links.
 
 The Links dialog opens (see Figure 6-13), displaying a list of existing 
links. You can select a link and then click the Break Link button to 
remove the link. Before you distribute your workbook, be sure that any-
thing you’d originally linked works acceptably without being linked.
Pasting HTML code into a cell
If you’re good enough with HTML to know how 
to view the source code in a Web browser, you 
can copy and paste table information into any 
cell on a worksheet. In the Web browser, copy 
so that you include the beginning <table> 
tag and the final </table> tag. Switch to 
Excel and then paste the whole shebang into a 
cell. Excel generates the table for you.

472
Getting Excel onto the Web
 
Figure 6-13: 
Removing 
and 
resolving 
links.
 
Distributing a workbook “as is”
Probably the easiest way to distribute a workbook is to upload it to a Web 
server. You can use any number of Web services, including the following:
 
✦ OfficeLive
 
✦ Google Docs
 
✦ Blackboard
 
✦ Angel
Traditional Web hosting companies give you instructions about how to upload 
files to their Web server. Whatever service you choose, people wind up click-
ing a link on a Web page, and they receive your entire workbook as a file. Some 
Web services, including OfficeLive and Blackboard, can display the workbook 
in a Web browser without requiring you to save it as a Web page.
Making a Web page
 
Before the advent of Web services, choosing File➪Save as Web Page was the 
only way to get a workbook to display in a Web browser on the Internet. With 
the advent of Web services, making Web pages from Excel seems old-fashioned.
The Save as Web Page feature in Excel creates a workbook that, when viewed 
in a Web browser, looks and acts almost like a real workbook, complete with 
working sheet tabs. When you use this feature, Excel creates two things:
 
✦ A Web document with an .htm file extension
 
✦ A folder that contains pictures of the objects in your workbook, such as 
graphs, SmartArt, pictures, and media files

Book III
Chapter 6
Becoming Versatile 
with Excel
473
Getting Excel onto the Web
The usual method is to use an FTP program to copy the .htm file and the 
folder onto a Web server.
See Figure 6-14 for the options in the Save as Web Page dialog:
 
✦ Format menu: Select the Web Page (.htm) option to make an .htm Web 
page and a folder that contains supporting documents, or single-file Web 
page (.mht).
 
✦ Workbook/Sheet/Selection option buttons: Select the Entire Workbook 
button or the Currently Selected Sheet button.
 
✦ Web Options button: We talk about these buttons in the following 
section.
 
✦ Compatibility Report button: Select this button to see a Compatibility 
Report for this format.
 
✦ Automate button: See the section, “Adding automation,” later in this 
chapter, for a description of this button.
 
✦ New Folder button: Creates a new folder in Finder.
 
Figure 6-14: 
Choosing 
Save as 
Web Page 
options.
 
Web options
In the Save as Web Page dialog (choose File➪Save as Web Page to open this 
dialog), click the Web Options button. In the Web Options dialog, select the 
General tab if it’s not visible already, as shown in Figure 6-15. You have two 
text boxes you can fill in:
 
✦ Web Page Title: Type the title for your Web page.
 
✦ Web Page Keywords: Fill in content keyword tags so that Web search 
engines can index your workbook’s Web page.

474
Getting Excel onto the Web
In addition to the General tab, the Web Options dialog has these tabs:
 
✦ Files: You probably shouldn’t change the settings here. The defaults 
work great for most people.
 
✦ Pictures: You probably shouldn’t change settings here, either. The 
defaults work great for most people.
 
✦ Encoding: Use this tab only if you want advanced control over the font 
encoding.
Adding automation
You might be using your Mac as a Web server. After all, Apache Web server 
comes with Mac OS X. Or perhaps you have a shared directory directly on a 
Web server.
If Excel has write access via Finder to the file location on the Web server, 
you can let Excel update the Web page on a predetermined schedule. For 
example, say you want to refresh a Web page every Monday, Wednesday, and 
Friday.
 
Click the Automate button in the Save as Web Page dialog to set a recurring 
schedule, as shown in Figure 6-16. You can find a wide range of possible 
scheduling options in the Recurring Schedule dialog.

Chapter 7: Being Intelligent

In This Chapter
✓ Cutting out the jargon
✓ Making lists and tables
✓ Working with the List Manager
✓ Taking the PivotTable course
✓ Turning Office 2008 into a fully relational database
D
ealing with data is fraught with mystery and jargon, not to mention 
thought and anticipation. Our goal is to take the mystery away and 
help you use the amazingly powerful tools in Excel to analyze your data. You 
find data analysis and presentation features unique to Excel for Mac, and 
we’re pleased to be able to focus on them in this chapter.
Simplifying Database Jargon
Sometimes, a word’s meaning changes, depending on context. In this chap-
ter, we use the following words with these meanings:
 
✦ List: A list is a collection of data arranged in rows and columns, like in a 
table, that you can use to display and analyze sets of data.
 
✦ Database: A database is a collection of lists or tables.
 
A list in Excel 2008 for Mac and a table in Excel 2007 for Windows are the 
same thing.

478
Listing the List Rules
Listing the List Rules
 
Excel can figure out whether you have a table or list if your data follows 
these simple rules:
 
✦ The first row — and only the first row — includes column names. Those 
names are unique.
 
✦ The end of the table or list is the first completely empty row and/or the 
first completely empty column.
 
✦ Merged cells don’t exist.
Lists can live in one of two places:
 
✦ List sheet: A sheet devoted entirely to a list.
 
✦ Worksheet: A list can be a range on a worksheet. More than one list can 
exist on a single worksheet.
The list shown in Figure 7-1 obeys our rules. You can use this data to follow 
along in our examples in the following sections by typing the table anywhere 
on a worksheet, or use your own data if it follows Excel’s data table rules.
Think about these two questions before getting started making your own lists:
 
✦ Where’s your data now?
 
✦ Where do you want the list to be when you’re done?

List Wizard Step 1 — Data locations
To open the List Wizard, choose View➪Toolbars➪List. On the toolbar that 
appears, click List Wizard. The List Wizard appears. The top section of the 
wizard asks Where Is the Data for Your List? The question presumes you 
have data somewhere. Your data could be on a sheet of paper, in an external 
database, on an Excel worksheet, or elsewhere. We show you a common 
case: You have a range of data on an Excel worksheet.
 
If you don’t have a range of data to work with, type the data shown in Figure 7-1 
into a blank worksheet.

3. On the List Manager toolbar, select List Wizard.
 
 Step 1 of the List Wizard appears, as shown in Figure 7-3. The List Wizard
 
• Figures out that a cell range contains data
 
• Displays the data range in the In an Open Workbook field
 
• Figures out that the list has headers
 
• Selects the My List Has Headers check box
 
4. In the Where Is the Data for Your List? section, select an option.
 
 The question offers these choices:
 
• None: If you’re new to lists and want a comprehensive step-by-step 
process, you can build a list from scratch by using the None option. 
This assumes that you’re working on a worksheet that has no data, 
and that you plan to type the data into the wizard.
 
• In an Open Workbook: Uses data already in the workbook. Most of 
the time, you probably start with data already on a worksheet, so 
this chapter focuses on this method.
 
• External Data Source: Uses data outside the workbook. We talk about 
working with external data sources using ODBC (Open Database 
Connectivity) in the section, “Using Excel with Relational Databases,” 
later in this chapter. You can read about Web queries in Chapter 6 of 
this minibook.

Indicate where your data is.
Then indicate where you want the list to go.
 
5. In the Where Do You Want to Put Your List? section, select an option.
 
 Two options appear below this question:
 
• New Sheet: Devoted entirely to a list (a list sheet). We chose this 
option for our example.
 
• On Existing Sheet: If you select this option, type a cell into the form 
field or select a cell by clicking the selection button to the right of 
the input field. Either way, the chosen cell becomes the upper-left 
cell of the new list. You can select any existing worksheet in any open 
workbook. If you leave the input field blank and select a data range 
before opening the wizard, Excel converts the current range to a list 
in its current place on the worksheet.
 
6. Select Next to advance to Step 2 of the List Wizard.
 
 We discuss this step in the following section.

Listing the List Rules
List Wizard Step 2 — Data types
In Step 2 of the List Wizard, you tell Excel what kind of data is in each 
column by selecting a data type for each column name (derived from the 
column headings). The wizard’s default data type for all column names is 
Any Value.
You can set a data type for each column name, one-by-one. Follow these 
steps with each column name whose data type you need to change:
 
1. Select a column name in the Columns list (see Figure 7-4).
 
 You can start with the top name in the list and work your way down. 
Figure 7-4 shows the last column name in the list, Result 4, selected.

Select a column name.
Click to modify.
Select a data type.
 
2. Select the appropriate data type from the Data Type pop-up menu.
 
 A column’s entries must match the data type without exception. Choose 
from these data types:
 
• Any Value: Any kind of data.
 
• Whole Number: Exclusively whole numbers.
 
• Decimal: Exclusively numbers, allowing decimal values.
 
• Currency: Exclusively numbers formatted as currency.
 
• Counter: A column that assigns a number to the data row.
 
• Text: Treats all characters entered as characters and numeric values.

482
Listing the List Rules
 
• List: Requires that all data in the column match an entry in a prede-
termined list of values or text for data validation.
 
• Date: All column entries are dates.
 
• Time: All column entries are times.
 
• Calculated column: You can add a column of values based on a for-
mula by using the Add button with this option.
 
3. Click the Modify button.
 
4. Repeat Steps 1–3 for each column name until you specify the data type 
for each of the column names.
 
 Setting the data type this way helps Excel do the following:
 
• Remember what kind of data is in each column. This is important 
when you’re using queries to read the data.
 
• Enforce data validation based on the data types you choose.
 
• Format the list by using the data types you choose.
In Step 2 of the wizard, you can also fine-tune data types, if you want. Each 
column name has its own settings. To refine the data types, follow these steps:
 
1. Select a column name in the Columns list (see Figure 7-4).
 
2. Click the Settings button.
 
 The Column Settings dialog appears, as shown in Figure 7-5.
 
 Alternatively, double-click a column name in the Columns list to display 
the Column Settings dialog.

3. Select a Data Type option.
 
4. Choose from these options:
 
• Unique Values Only: Doesn’t allow duplicate values in the column. 
This setting applies to many kinds of lists, such as invoices and 
record numbers. Many people don’t realize that Excel has this capa-
bility built-in and that it doesn’t require macros.
 
• Default Value: Prefills new records with the default value entered in 
the field. Don’t use this option with the Unique Values Only setting 
selected.
 
 The Column Settings dialog has three additional buttons: Formatting, 
Conditional Formatting, and Validation, each of which is discussed else-
where in this book.
 
 The settings you select in the Column Settings dialog apply to the 
column name you selected in Step 1 in this section, formatting and 
validating your database columns. The Formula field is used with the 
Calculated Column data type.
 
5. Click OK to dismiss the Column Settings dialog and return to the List 
Wizard Step 2.
 
6. When you finish making changes in Step 2 of the List Wizard, select 
Next.
 
 Step 3 appears, which we talk about in the following section.

In the third step of the List Wizard (see Figure 7-6), you name your list and 
set formatting options.
 
Figure 7-6:

484
Listing the List Rules
Choose from the following options:
 
✦ List Name: If your new list will be on a list sheet, the name you type here 
appears on the sheet tab. If your new list will be on an existing work-
sheet, the name you type appears as the name of the list object on the 
worksheet. You can use this name to access the list object programmati-
cally via programs like VBA. Don’t use spaces or special characters.
 
✦ Autoformat List after Editing: After you select this option, click the 
Autoformat button to choose a list style. We like the default style best.
 
✦ Repeat Column Headers on Each Printed Page: It’s usually a good idea 
when making a new list sheet to use repeating column heads, but it’s not 
an option if you plan to place your list on an existing worksheet.
 
✦ Show Totals Row: If you don’t need calculations, you can deselect this 
feature. Our example has this option turned on.
 
✦ Show List Visuals: We prefer to leave them turned on, but if you want an 
experience closer to Excel for Windows, turn them off or use the Auto 
setting.
When you’re done selecting options in Step 3 of the wizard, click Finish to 
see your new list, as shown in Figure 7-7.

✦ Delete Row/Column: Available only on the List menu within the List 
Manager toolbar.
 
✦ Chart: Activates the Chart tab on Elements Gallery, if it’s not active 
already.
 
✦ PivotTable Report: Turns on the PivotTable Wizard and uses your list as 
the data source.
 
✦ Remove List Manager: Converts the selected list into an ordinary cell 
range. The List toolbar remains visible, but Excel no longer considers 
the cell range a list.

Taking the PivotTable Course
Become familiar with the PivotTables data analysis tool. Most folks now con-
sider PivotTables business intelligence (BI) tools, but they work for anyone 
with medium to large data sets.
 
PivotTables are a great way to present organized summaries of data.
 
 When it comes to understanding the PivotTable feature, we’re going to get 
you started with the excellent, 30-minute Pivot Report course that’s included 
free with Excel 2008 for Mac. It comes complete with sample data and a 
review quiz at the end of the course. (You need an Internet connection to 
take the course.)
Access the free Pivot Report course by following these steps:
 
 1. Click the Help button on Excel’s Standard toolbar.
 
 
 The Excel Help dialog appears.
 
2. Type pivot report into the search terms.
 
 Search results appear in a tray below the search box.
 
3. Select Analyze Your Data with PivotTable Reports.
 
 A course summary appears, including a Start Course button.
 
4. Click the yellow Start Course button.
 
 The course starts in your Web browser.
Using Excel with Relational Databases
 
Experts have often said that Excel isn’t a true relational database. That’s 
flatly not true because Excel ships with a helper application — Microsoft 
Query — in Excel for Mac and Excel for Windows. You can use Excel work-
books as data sources in relational databases.
 
You might find a screen shot of the Microsoft Query interface (see Figure 
7-10) helpful if you have experience using relational databases. Be reassured 
that indeed, you can do this sort of thing in Excel. Yes, you can use SQL 
(Structure Query Language), create joins, and even use calculated fields and 
parameter queries.

Explaining relational databases
We need to cut through some database jargon. Database gurus talk about 
data this way:
 
✦ Flat files: Standalone lists and tables, such as those discussed in the ear-
lier in this chapter.
 
✦ Relational databases: Have two or more tables in a database, and those 
tables are set up to reduce the total number of columns needed by relat-
ing them to each other in SQL queries.
Say that you have a list that includes the names and addresses of all employ-
ees in a company. You might also have a list that contains the attendance 
details of those employees.
What’s common in both these lists? The employee number.
Wouldn’t it be nice if the common field in these lists were linked so that you 
could query one list from the other? Such an arrangement would require that 
both lists have a relation, thus the term relational database! Of course, we’re 
explaining the whole concept in a very simple way, and you can find tons of 
descriptions floating around in books, research papers, and online sources 
about these relational databases.
Installing an ODBC driver
 
Office for Mac doesn’t ship with a special program called an ODBC (Open 
Database Connectivity) driver. If you want relational database capabilities in 
Office for Mac, you have to install an ODBC driver.

Book III
Chapter 7
Being Intelligent 
with Data
489
Using Excel with Relational Databases
 
We don’t go too deeply into this topic, but ODBC acts as a go-between and 
communicates with both Excel and the data source; see the relationship in 
Figure 7-11. In the figure, the database source is external to Excel. Excel’s 
phrase for this is external data.
 
Figure 7-11:

cating

Buying an ODBC driver
We know two independent software vendors that sell ODBC drivers. Both are 
well-respected, Mac-friendly companies. Detailed download, installation, and 
operation explanations are on their respective Web sites:
 
✦ ActualTechnologies: ActualTechnologies’ Microsoft Access driver can 
use Excel workbooks as data sources, in addition to Microsoft Access 
.mdb databases. This driver can work with database files located in Mac 
OS X Finder. Be sure to read and follow the excellent installation instruc-
tions provided.
www.actualtechnologies.com
 
✦ OpenLink: The drivers from this company work by connecting over a 
network to the IP address of databases that the database administrator 
has preconfigured to accept your network connection.
www.openlinksw.com
 
Check ODBC vendor sites for free trial offers.
Compatibility with Excel for Windows
On the Mac, Microsoft Query is read-only. It can’t add or drop tables, nor can it 
add or remove records. This offers better security, but it reduces functionality.
If your database administrator is concerned about database integrity, Excel for 
Mac makes a perfect client because it can’t do table or record manipulations.

Reading more about relational databases
As you might have guessed by now, the topic of 
relational databases is a little too advanced for 
this book. You can find several articles about 
working with external data on the Web. You 
can download these free articles from this Web 
site:
www.agentjim.com/MVP/Excel/
ExcelHome.htm
On this site, you can find articles that explain 
details about how to connect to outside data 
sources and how to use Microsoft Office on 
the Mac as a relational database. The follow-

✓ Adding headers and footers
✓ Creating a digital watermark
✓ Deciding what print quality you want to use
✓ Choosing a paper size
P
rinting from Excel is a bit different than the other Office applications in 
some respects. Excel’s printing feature takes full advantage of the Mac 
OS X print capabilities, and Excel supplements these with some clever tricks 
of its own.
Using the Page Setup Dialog
Excel’s Page Setup dialog lets you format your worksheet’s printing output. 
To display this dialog, choose File➪Page Setup➪Sheet (see Figure 8-1). 
Alternatively, you can select Print Titles from the Formatting Palette’s Page 
Setup section, which takes you directly to the Sheet tab.
 
Figure 8-1: 
Setting print 
titles and 
more.
 

Using the Page Setup Dialog
492
Browsing the Sheet tab
You have several ways to adjust the way you print Excel files on the Sheet 
tab, as discussed in the following sections.
Print Titles section
This section has an Options button that we explain in the section, “Setting 
the Paper Size,” later in this chapter. Print Titles lets you make the following 
decisions:
 
✦ Rows to Repeat at Top: If you want the first row (probably composed of 
headings) to repeat on each printed page, use this setting, as shown in 
Figure 8-1. You can either
 
• Type in a row or range of rows.
 
• Click the Select Range button (to the right of the Rows to Repeat at 
Top field); then, click the row number in your workbook, as shown 
in Figure 8-2. Clicking the Select Range button a second time returns 
you to the Page Setup dialog.
 
✦ Columns to Repeat at Left: This option is like setting a row to print, 
except you click a column instead. You can either
 
• Type in a column or range of columns.
 
• Click the Select Range button (to the right of the Columns to Repeat 
at Left field); then, click the column letters in your workbook, as 
shown in Figure 8-3. Clicking the Select Range button again returns 
you to the Page Setup dialog.
 
Figure 8-2:

row that you 
want to print 
at the top of 
every page.
 Click here to select a row.
Type the field here.
Activate button
Print section
 
 Excel lets you limit printing to a predetermined range of cells. When you set 
a print area, Excel remembers this information when you save the workbook. 
And Excel prints this range when you click the Print button on the Standard 
toolbar or if you accept the defaults when choosing File➪Print.

You have several different ways to set the print area:
 
✦ Choose Page Setup➪Sheet; type the cell range in the Print Area field.
 
✦ Choose Page Setup➪Sheet; in the Print section, click the Select Range 
button. Drag over the range of cells you want to print and then click the 
Select Range button again.
 
✦ Select a range directly on your worksheet; choose File➪Print Area➪

We explain comments in Chapter 3 of this minibook. The Comments menu 
lets you choose from these options:
 
✦ None: Don’t include comments.
 
✦ At End of Sheet: Show all comments at the end of the printed sheet.
 
✦ As Displayed on Sheet: Show comments as they appear on the worksheet.
Using the Margins tab
 
When you click the Margins button on the Formatting Palette, the Page 
Setup’s Margins tab appears, as shown in Figure 8-4.
You may find the Center on Page check boxes of special interest:
 
✦ Horizontally: Provides equal amounts of blank space on the left and 
right sides of your printed page
 
✦ Vertically: Provides equal amounts of blank space on the top and 
bottom of your printed page
Select both options to center printing.

Working with Headers and Footers

Working with Headers and Footers
 
 You can work with headers and footers in Page Layout View by choosing 
View➪Page Layout or clicking the Page Layout button.
Entering a header/footer
 
Formatting headers and footers adds a distinctive appearance to your 
printed worksheets. You can also easily include important date and time 
information. Follow these steps to add a header or footer:
 
1. Move the cursor over the white space near the top of each page to 
format a header or over the white space near the bottom of each page 
to format a footer.
 
 A prompt appears, telling you to double-click if you want to add a 
header (or footer), as shown in Figure 8-5.

2. Double-click in the white space.
 
 The Header/Footer text area opens (see Figure 8-6), and the Header/
Footer toolbar becomes available (see Figure 8-7). You may have to look 
for the toolbar on your screen. It won’t necessarily appear where you 
see it in the figure.
 
 You can also use the formatting options on the Header/Footer toolbar 
rather than the Formatting Palette.

3. Type your header or footer in the text provided.
 
4. Click the Close button to exit the Header/Footer dialog.

Finessing your footers (and headers)
When you’re entering or editing a header or footer, you can use these but-
tons (left to right on the Header/Footer toolbar, as shown in Figure 8-8) to 
make things fancy:
 
✦ Format Text: Select text; then click Format Text to display the Font 
dialog. See Chapter 3 of this minibook for font formatting options.
 
✦ Insert Page Numbers: Inserts &[Page] code. When printing, the current 
page number appears on your printed page where you put this code.
 
✦ Insert Number of Pages: Inserts &[Pages] code. When printing, the 
number of pages in the entire document is printed with the current 
page number on your printed page where you put this code.
 
 You can combine codes with text. For example, use Insert Page Numbers 
and Insert Page Numbers with Additional Text like this: Page &[Page] 
of &[Pages] to print Page # of #.

Working with Headers and Footers
496
 
✦ Insert Date: Inserts &[Date] code. When printing, the current date 
appears on your printed page where you put this code.
 
✦ Insert Time: Inserts &[Time] code. When printing, the system time 
appears on your printed page where you put this code.
 
✦ Insert File Path: Inserts &[Path]&[File] codes. When printing, the file 
pathname and filename of the spreadsheet appear on your printed page 
where you put this code.
 
✦ Insert File Name: Inserts &[File] code. When printing, the filename of 
the spreadsheet appears on your printed page where you put this code.
 
✦ Insert Sheet Name: Inserts &[Tab] code. When printing, the name of 
the worksheet appears on your printed page where you put this code.
 
✦ Insert Picture: Displays the Choose a Picture dialog, where you can 
navigate or use Spotlight to select a background picture. Inserts 
&[Picture] code.
 
✦ Format Picture: Displays the Format Picture dialog, where you can 
control the size and other formatting aspects of your picture.
 
 Use Format Picture dialog’s Picture tab. In the Image Control pop-up 
menu, select Watermark to format your inserted picture as a watermark.
 
✦ Close: Dismisses the Header/Footer toolbar and displays the worksheet.

Headers and footers are divided into three distinct regions. You’re in the left, 
right, or center region, depending on where you double-click.
 
If you prefer the retro look of the old Header/Footer pane from previous 
versions of Excel, you can still access it by choosing File➪Page Setup and 
then clicking the Header/Footer tab; you can also choose View➪Header and 
Footer. We think the new way — using Page Layout View — is more intuitive.

Making a Watermark
497
Making a Watermark
 
You can use the Picture feature of the Header/Footer toolbar to insert a pic-
ture as a watermark. A watermark gets its name from a paper-manufacturing 
process in which words or symbols are embedded in paper pages by wetting 
the paper. In an electronic environment, you create a watermark by format-
ting text and pictures to appear only faintly and then putting them into the 
background.
Follow this step-by-step process to insert WordArt as a watermark:
 
 1. Choose Gallery on the Standard toolbar to open Elements Gallery.
 
 2. On the WordArt tab, click a style of your choice.
 
3. Type what you want to use as your watermark.
 
 It might be something like Confidential.
 
4. Right-click the border of the WordArt and choose Save as Picture 
from the pop-up menu that appears.
 
 The Save dialog appears.
 
5. Navigate to a handy location and click Save.
 
 You’re now done with the WordArt you created, and you can delete it, if 
you want.
 
 6. In the workbook where you want the watermark, choose View➪
Page Layout or click the Page Layout button.
 
 The workbook switches to Page Layout View.
 
7. Double-click the center of the header area, where it says Double-Click 
to Add Header.
 
8. Click the Insert Picture button on the Header/Footer toolbar.
 
9. Go to where you saved your WordArt and select the image.
 
10. Click the Insert button in the File dialog.
 
11. Click the Format Picture button on the Header/Footer toolbar.
 
 Set rotation, brightness, and other settings as desired on both tabs of 
the Format Picture dialog.
 
12. Click OK to close the Format Picture dialog and then click Close to 
close the Header/Footer toolbar.

Adjusting Print Quality
498
Adjusting Print Quality
Adjusting the quality of the print jobs you get from Excel can be a two-stage 
(but several-step) process:
 
✦ In the first stage, you adjust what Excel sends to your printer.
 
✦ In the second stage, you tell your printer the quality level that you want.
Telling your computer what to send to the printer
The following steps determine your Excel print settings:
 
1. Click the Print Titles button on the Formatting Palette.
 
 The Sheet tab opens in the Page Setup dialog (as shown in Figure 8-1 ear-
lier in this chapter).
 
2. Select the appropriate settings.
 
 You can select
 
• Black and White: Produces black-and-white printed output.
 
• Draft Quality: Prints quickly at low quality. Fine lines and details, such 
as gridlines, may not print, even if selected in settings.
 
3. Click the Page tab.
 
4. In the Print Quality pop-up menu, choose from options offered by 
your printer driver.
 
 Options vary by brand and model of printer. See Figure 8-9. These set-
tings affect the quality of the output that Excel sends to the printer.

tab of the 
Page Setup 
dialog.

5. Click OK to close the Page Setup dialog.
 
Do you want it fast? Or, do you want it sharp? You have the following 
choices:
 
✦ For the fastest printing:
 
• Select the Draft Quality check box on the Sheet tab.
 
• Pick the lowest-quality option that your printer offers in the Print 
Quality field on the Page tab.
 
✦ For the highest-quality printing:
 
• Deselect Draft Quality on the Sheet tab.
 
• On the Page tab, select the highest-quality setting that your printer 
offers in the Print Quality field.
You can experiment with settings in between until you get the right balance 
of quality and speed with your printer.
Telling your printer how to do its job
The preceding section tells you how to set the quality of the output that 
Excel sends to the printer. This section tells you how to tell your printer 
what to do. Options vary by brand and model printer, so you may not see 
everything we illustrate available for your own printer. To tell your printer 
the quality level you want, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪Print.
 
 The first time you choose Print, a condensed Print dialog opens, much 
like the one pictured in Figure 8-10.
 
2. Click the downward-pointing triangle.
 
 The full Print dialog opens (see Figure 8-11).

3. Choose Copies & Pages➪Print Settings.
 
 You can see this option in Figure 8-12. The Print Settings dialog provided 
by your printer appears.
 
 Even if you set Excel to print top-quality output (see the preceding section), 
you may need to adjust the printer’s settings to get the highest-quality 
print. Some printer brands default to the lowest-quality setting to 
provide the highest speed.
 
4. Choose File➪Print.
 
 The Print dialog opens, as shown in Figure 8-13.
 
 Some of the Print settings also show up on the Formatting Palette and in 
the Page Setup dialog.

5. Make any changes you want to the print options in the Printer dialog.
 
 You have these options:
 
• Printer: Select a printer from your available printers in this pop-up 
menu.
 
• Presets: This pop-up menu lists the names of combinations of print 
settings that you’ve previously saved. Select one or select Standard 
for the default set of printing options.
 
• Copies & pages: Choose settings provided by your printer driver.
 
• Copies: Type or use the Increase/Decrease control to set the number 
of pages to print.
 
• Collated: Select this check box to print all the pages in order for 
each copy.
 
• Pages: Select All or type beginning and ending page numbers that 
you want to print.
 
• Print What: You can select Selection (which prints what’s currently 
selected in the workbook), Active Sheets (prints the currently selected 
sheet tabs), or Entire Workbook (prints all sheets of the workbook).

Setting the Paper Size
502
 
• Scaling: Scaling options change how the active document is printed 
and displayed in Page Layout View. For example, you can choose set-
tings such as Fit to [Number] Pages Wide by [Number] Pages Tall.
 
• Show Quick Preview: Select this check box to display a small preview 
in the Print dialog.
 
• Page Setup: Select this button to display the Page Setup dialog 
(see Figure 8-9).
 
• PDF: Select this button to display PDF printing options, which we 
describe thoroughly in Book IV, Chapter 9.
 
• Preview: Select this button to display a print preview of your docu-
ment in the Mac OS X Preview application.
 
6. After you set your print options, click the Print button.
 
 Your spreadsheet prints with the settings you just chose.
Setting the Paper Size
 
Most of the time, you’ll probably be happy with the default paper size set-
tings. In case you want to change them, click the Options button on any tab 
of the Page Setup dialog, as shown in Figure 8-14.
The Options button displays the pane that lets you adjust paper sizes. We 
describe this pane in detail in Book II, Chapter 8. Changing the paper size 
affects the Page Layout View.

Chapter 1: Revealing PowerPoint
In This Chapter
✓ Getting comfortable with PowerPoint
✓ Showing in Presenter Tools View
✓ Building in Normal View
✓ Sorting in Slide Sorter View
A
ptly named, PowerPoint is the tool that presenters of all kinds rely 
on to help them communicate with their audience. Initially, 
PowerPoint was used to create the framework that aided presenters. 
Then, PowerPoint widened its scope to encompass the creation of self-running 
kiosk presentations. In the present scenario, PowerPoint’s role has further 
expanded into the Web 2.0 horizons, with educators, businesspersons, 
students, and others incorporating Web content into PowerPoint and 
making PowerPoint presentations available online.
Our goal is not only to help you feel comfortable with PowerPoint, but also 
with yourself as a presenter. Throughout this minibook, we include advice, 
hopefully sage. Other times, we chirp about some of the exciting PowerPoint 
features.
We put you at ease and make presenting to an audience fun. At the very 
least, we hope to make presenting less stressful for you, even if it’s your first 
time in front of an audience.
Getting Up and Running
Although PowerPoint can present your media content in slides, it has real 
value as a thought-organizing tool. We invite you to follow along in this 
chapter by working with the same presentation that we are. Begin by 
following these steps:
 
1. Open PowerPoint.
 
2. Choose File➪Project Gallery if Project Gallery doesn’t open 
automatically when you start PowerPoint.
 
 Project Gallery appears.
 
3. Select the New tab if it’s not already selected.

506
Facing Your Audience
 
4. In the Category list on the left, select Presentations.
 
 Project Gallery displays its built-in presentation templates.
 
5. Double-click Introducing PowerPoint 2008.
 
 A new presentation based on the template opens in PowerPoint.
Facing Your Audience
When you work with PowerPoint, you can choose from two main operating 
modes. PowerPoint usually opens in Editing mode, in which you can 
create your presentations and work on their content. The other mode is 
Presentation mode, in which you actually run a presentation, playing all its 
content, fancy effects, timings, audio, and movies.
If you have a presentation open in PowerPoint, to get to PowerPoint’s 
different interfaces, focus on the View menu. To start running a presentation, 
choose View➪Presenter Tools. Even if you don’t have a projector connected, 
you should be able to see Presenter Tools on your monitor.
Presenter Tools View shows you the screen in Figure 1-1. Only the selected 
slide (not visible in Figure 1-1) is projected to your audience. You can see 
much more, including the elapsed time, or you can toggle to the current 
time. You’re in complete control with an easy-to-use scroll bar in case you 
want to skip to any slide at any time. You can type in the slide notes pane 
while your presentation is running, or you can refer to slide notes you typed 
in previously to assist you with presenting. To leave Presenter Tools, click 
the End button or press the Escape key.
Mac users might cringe at this suggestion and 
can skip this sidebar. Some Windows users don’t 
feel comfortable on a Mac because all the appli-
cation windows are open at the same time — 
you don’t have a single Application Window. 
You can remedy this situation if it bothers you.
Holding the Option-Ô keys down when 
you click PowerPoint’s Dock icon hides the 
other open applications so that all you see is 
PowerPoint. To switch to other open applica-
tions, press Ô-Tab or click their Dock icons, 
similar to the old taskbar in Windows. If you 
hold down the mouse button on Dock icons, 
you can switch from one open presentation to 
another by using a pop-up menu, just like you 
can in Windows.

Building and Editing in Normal View
Although the Presenter Tools View we explore in the preceding section is the 
professional presenter view, the workhorse editing view in PowerPoint is the 
Normal View, which you can access by choosing View➪Normal. Normal View 
is what PowerPoint uses by default and can be seen in Figure 1-2.
In Normal View, you build presentations by adding slides with titles, 
text, and rich content, and then animating them judiciously, if required. 
PowerPoint has other important views that you can find out more about 
later in this minibook. Figure 1-2 shows Normal View on a small screen, 
as you might see it on a 13-inch iBook. When working with a small screen, 
hide and display Elements Gallery and the Toolbox quickly by clicking the 
Elements Gallery and Toolbox buttons on the Standard toolbar. Otherwise, 
feel free to move things around on your screen.

We want to let you in on a couple of minor secrets about using PowerPoint’s 
Normal View that can make working in this view smoother for you. Refer to 
Figure 1-2 for the following discussion. The View buttons at the lower-left 
corner are only three of the possible views available in PowerPoint:
 
 
✦ To run the presentation starting with the slide you’re working on, 
click the miniature screen button, the rightmost View button.
 
✦ To end a running presentation, press the Escape key.
 
✦ To change to Slide View, click the Slide View button. The pane that 
shows the Slide/Outline selector closes.
 
✦ To restore the Slide/Outline selector pane, choose View➪Normal.

Organizing Slides in Slide Sorter View
Organizing Slides in Slide Sorter View
Shown in Figure 1-3, the Slide Sorter View (choose View➪Slide Sorter) is 
used for several purposes. You can use it to do the following:
 
✦ Organize your slides by putting them into the proper order.
 
✦ Duplicate and delete slides.
 
✦ Multiselect sequential or nonsequential slides.
 
✦ Hide and unhide selected slides.
 
✦ Control transition effects. Transition effects play when your presenta-
tion advances from one slide to the next.
 
✦ Set and adjust slide timings.

Organizing Slides in Slide Sorter View
 
Using slide timings is optional. You can set the amount of time a slide will be 
shown, and then PowerPoint advances to the next slide automatically during 
your presentation. Setting timings can be a consideration when setting up a 
self-running kiosk presentation.
Selecting slides
What you can do in Slide Sorter View depends on knowing what’s currently 
selected. In Slide Sorter View, PowerPoint lets you know which slide or 
slides are currently selected by putting a small, faint, bluish border around 
selected slides. See Figure 1-4 (even though you can’t see the blue selection 
around each slide in this black-and-white book) and compare the border of 
the slide that’s selected to the slide that’s not selected. The border difference 
is subtle, yet distinct. Selected slides may appear to be slightly larger than 
non-selected slides.
 
Figure 1-4: 
Spotting the 
selection 
indicator.
 
Slide selected 
Not selected
Here are some guidelines that can help you select slides in Slide Sorter View:
 
✦ To select one slide, click the slide.
 
✦ To select a range of slides, hold the (left) mouse button down while you 
drag across slides. Dragging in a diagonal direction can be helpful.
 
✦ To select multiple, noncontiguous slides, hold the Command (Ô) key 
down and then click the slides you want to select.
 
✦ To select all the slides in the presentation, press Ô-A or choose 
Edit➪Select All.
Changing slide order
Changing the order is one way in which you can create a better, logical flow 
from slide to slide. Therefore, it’s an integral part of a process that makes 
your presentation better each time you fine-tune and deliver it. The improve-
ment process is a result of understanding your audience’s expectations and 
responses better each time you give your presentation.

Organizing Slides in Slide Sorter View
When you revisit a presentation that’s been on the shelf for a few months, 
you suddenly realize that things need to be changed. You probably need to 
reorder some slides. Changing the slide order is drag-and-drop easy. Just 
drag one or more slides from where they are and position the cursor in front 
of the slide where you want them to be. In Figure 1-5, we’re moving slides 5 
and 6 to position them between slides 11 and 12.
 
Figure 1-5: 
Changing 
the slide 
order.
 
Figure 1-5 shows the selection indicators around slides 5 and 6, and it shows 
that we’re in the process of dragging these slides. You can see that the 
mouse pointer is between slides 11 and 12. The barely visible line just to the 
left of slide 12 indicates the insertion point.
Copying and pasting
This process is so intuitive that we almost didn’t mention it. Select one 
or more slides, and use any common copy method, such as choosing 
Edit➪Copy. Click at the desired insertion point, as shown in Figure 1-5, 
and then paste it by using any common paste method, such as choosing 
Edit➪Paste.
Deleting the chaff from the wheat
Sometimes you just have to delete a slide. Even if you spent some time on a 
slide, it can go out of date or be otherwise unwanted. To delete one or more 
slides, select them and then press Delete.
Transitioning from one slide to the next
Applying transitions is easy. Transitions are effects that add animation 
or sound to the movement of the change between one slide and another, 
depending on which transition style you choose. We discuss transitions 
in the following sections, but first it’s important to remember that when 
you’re using transitions, you must keep both your audience and the content 
in mind. Think about the reason that you’re adding a transition in the first 
place. Transitions can be overdone or underdone.

512
Organizing Slides in Slide Sorter View
 
A presentation that moves from slide to slide every time with a jump cut, 
meaning without transitions, can be dull and look like it’s not done yet. 
Appropriate transitions make presentations easier to watch. At times, you 
use transitions that are more visually active to help draw attention naturally 
to transitions in the content that you’re delivering. If you use too many high-
motion transitions, your audience will be reeling from motion sickness.
Like we said, it’s fast and easy to apply transitions. To do so, follow these 
steps:
 
 1. While in Slide Sorter View, select one, several, or all the slides.
 
2. Click the Transitions tab of Elements Gallery.
 
 
 If Elements Gallery isn’t visible, click the Gallery button on PowerPoint’s 
standard toolbar.
 
 
 The Elements Gallery displays transitions from which you can choose.
 
3. Click a transition.
 
 
A preview of the chosen transition plays in the selected slide in Slide 
Sorter View (it might be just a blink). A small icon appears to the 
lower-left to indicate a transition is applied.
In Slide Sorter View, you can fine-tune transition effects and add sounds to 
transitions. Click the Options button to display the Transition Options pane. 
(Refer to Figure 1-3.)
Setting transition options — Effect
The Effect part of the Transition Options pane has two capabilities. You find 
a pop-up menu that lets you select a different transition, and you have a 
choice of speeds: slow, medium, or fast.
Setting transition options — Sound
Sounds can act as punctuation points, exclamation points, or incidental 
music in your presentation. A handful of sounds are located on the Sound 
pop-up menu, but if you go to the very bottom of the menu, you can select 
Other Sound. This option causes a File browser to open, so you can choose 
any sound available on your system, or even sounds from your iTunes music 
library. Transition sounds are of short duration, only a few seconds long.
Setting transition options — Advance Slide
Here, Slide Sorter View lets you control the slide timings. You have the 
following options:

Book IV
Chapter 1

PowerPoint
513
Organizing Slides in Slide Sorter View
 
✦ On Mouse Click: When this check box is selected, you can click the 
mouse in a running presentation to advance to the next slide. Selecting 
the On Mouse Click check box doesn’t affect Presenter Tools View, but it 
does affect presentations that run by using the other methods.
 
✦ Automatically after [Number of] Seconds: Controls slide timing. Be 
careful with this setting. If you have items on your slide that take a 
certain amount of time to run, such as animations or a movie, you 
should choose a time value that’s longer than it takes for everything to 
play. Then add a few seconds because not every computer is as fast as 
yours, and you want your slide to finish without being cut off.
 
 You can also add timings by choosing Slide Show➪Record Narration 
and Slide Show➪Rehearse Timings, features which we cover in Book IV, 
Chapter 8.

In This Chapter
✓ Opening presentations
✓ Discovering special ways to save your presentations
✓ Protecting your presentations
P
owerPoint has some special file-handling features up its ornamented 
sleeve. In this chapter, we cover how to open and save files in PowerPoint. 
You can easily recover if your computer or PowerPoint crashes — which, of 
course, would never happen . . . but just in case, you can refer to this chap-
ter. This chapter also shows you how to create a secure PowerPoint presen-
tation that you can open on both Macs and PCs.
Opening Special File Formats
You can open PowerPoint presentations and special file formats by choosing 
File➪Open. The Open dialog appears. Click Enable to open a pop-up menu, 
as shown in Figure 2-1, and select from the list of file types shown. If you see 
any file types that seem unfamiliar, don’t worry. We explain the different file-
type options:
 
Figure 2-1: 
Enabling 
additional 
file formats 
to open.
 

516
Opening Special File Formats
 
✦ All Readable Documents: Open any kind of file that PowerPoint 
understands.
 
✦ All Office Documents: Open only Office documents.
 
✦ PowerPoint Presentations: Open only PowerPoint presentations 
(.pptx) and PowerPoint shows (.ppsx). This file-type option also 
enables you to choose old-format PowerPoint presentations (.ppt) and 
PowerPoint shows (.pps).
 
✦ Office Themes and PowerPoint Templates: Open only Office Themes 
(.thmx) and PowerPoint Templates (.potx and .pot).
 
✦ All Outlines: Open documents saved in outline format from PowerPoint 
(.rtf).
 
✦ All Files: Attempt to open any file in PowerPoint.
Regardless of which Enable option you use, PowerPoint can only open files it 
understands, and it lets you know if it can’t open the chosen file.
When you enable the Office Themes and PowerPoint Templates option in the 
Open dialog (see Figure 2-1), you can browse to a template and open it as a 
new presentation. You use this option in the same way that you use Project 
Gallery or Elements Gallery to open the template.
Outlines are rich-text format (.rtf) documents that PowerPoint can create. 
As the name implies, they’re text documents in outline form. They don’t have 
the slide, animation, or other aspects of presentations — just the title and text 
placeholder content as it appears in the Outline pane of Normal View. An out-
line is the foundation of any well-thought-out PowerPoint presentation.
Finding out about AutoRecover
Although File Open takes care of everyday file opening, if PowerPoint or 
your computer crashes, you can open the AutoRecover file. Before you take 
advantage of AutoRecover, you first must turn this feature on by following 
these steps:
 
1. From the PowerPoint menu, choose Preferences.
 
 PowerPoint’s Preferences dialog appears (see Figure 2-2).
 
2. Click the Save button.
 
 PowerPoint’s Save preferences appear.
 
3. Select the Save AutoRecover Info Every [Number of] Minutes check 
box; then click the red Close button.
 
 You’ve enabled AutoRecover and closed Preferences.
PowerPoint automatically opens the most recently autosaved version the 
next time you open PowerPoint after a crash or force-quit.

Although this feature is great, don’t depend on it all the time. Make it a habit 
to save your presentations regularly. Pressing Ô-S is all it takes to save 
changes in the presentation you’re working on! Or you can choose File➪Save 
As to save a new copy of your presentation.
Opening password-protected presentations
The Windows version of PowerPoint provides the ability to password-
protect PowerPoint files. This feature gives PowerPoint-for-Windows users 
a sense of security, although some critics complain that it does little to 
prevent some people from opening and editing those files in PowerPoint 
for Windows. Unfortunately, Mac users can’t open these files. If you receive 
a password-protected file, you can’t open it in PowerPoint for Mac. Your 
alternative is to ask the sender to resave the presentation without password 
protection.
Hopefully, this annoying security feature will be removed from the next ver-
sion of Office for Windows. PowerPoint for Mac has a more secure way of 
protecting your presentations, and the Mac method creates files that are 
compatible on both Mac and Windows platforms. See the “Saving with a 
password” section, later in this chapter.
Saving in Special Formats
Even more interesting than PowerPoint’s plethora of formats that you can 
open is the array of Save As options. Check out Figure 2-3 and get ready to 
explore these options in detail.
Packaging a PowerPoint presentation
PowerPoint Package is an option that you can choose when you want to dis-
tribute a complete, editable presentation via CD, flash drive, or other media. 
It creates a folder that you can burn, copy, or move to whatever media you 
want. It’s important to use this option when your presentation contains 
movies or any other linked content so that the presentation can actually 
play that linked content.

518
Saving in Special Formats
 
Figure 2-3:

Saving as a movie
Choosing the Movie (.mov) option creates a QuickTime movie of your pre-
sentation. You can get the same result by choosing File➪Save as Movie. 
When you use the Movie option, timings are included, slide transitions may 
change, sound isn’t included, and animations don’t play.
You can add an audio track by using the Movie Options dialog. Just follow 
these steps:
 
1. Click Options or the Movie Options button in the Save As dialog.
 
 The Movie Options dialog appears as shown in Figure 2-4.
 
2. In the Media Settings area, click Background Soundtrack and choose 
Select Soundtrack from the pop-up menu that appears.
 
 The Choose a Soundtrack dialog appears.
 
3. Navigate or use Spotlight to select the sound file that you want to 
include.
 
 If you choose your Mac OS X Media folder, you can choose non-DRM 
music or other audio files from iTunes.
 
4. Click Choose
 
 The Movie Options dialog reappears and displays the name of the audio 
file in the Background Soundtrack pop-up button.
 
5. Click OK to close the Movie Options dialog.

Figure 2-4: 
Adding 
sound to a

movie.
 
The sound that you include by using this dialog plays across your entire 
movie, not just the part that comprises one or more slides.
 
Instead of using the File menu’s Save As command and choosing Movie or 
using the File menu’s Save as Movie command, we suggest using screen-
capture software, such as Ambrosia Software’s SnapZProX, to capture the 
presentation as a movie and get all the animations, transitions, and sound. 
To capture your presentation, you need to have your capturing program 
installed, and you’ll need to play your presentation in a window. To do so, 
follow these steps:
 
1. On the Slide Show menu, choose Set Up Show.
 
2. Under Show Type, choose Browsed by an Individual (Window).
 
 Set up further, as shown in Figure 2-5.
 
3. Turn on the screen-capture software.
 
 4. Click the Slide Show button on PowerPoint’s Standard toolbar to start 
the slide show from slide 1.
 
 The presentation plays normally, but it appears in a window so that you 
can shoot screens with your screen-capture software.

Making a Web page
With so many new Web services, such as Office Live, Google Docs, 
Blackboard, and Angel, this option seems dated and nearly obsolete. It cre-
ates an HTM file and a folder for related content that you can copy to a Web 
server. We don’t think this feature is of much use anymore, although you can 
try it out. It’s easy enough to use and may work well for slides that contain 
just text.
Saving with a password
This Save As option is the fast, easy way to get your presentation into 
PDF format. A PDF file contains only pictures of your slides, not the notes, 
movies, animations, or transitions.
You can password-protect your presentation, using the PDF options from the 
Print dialog. Follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪Print.
 
 The Print dialog appears.
 
2. Click the PDF button in the lower-left corner of the Print pane and 
select the first menu item, Save as PDF, as shown in Figure 2-6.
 
3. Click in the Save As text box and enter a filename that includes the 
file extension .pdf.
 
 The Save dialog opens, as shown in Figure 2-7.

• Require Password to Copy Text, Images and Other Content. Select this 
check box to disable these commands in the interface.

This method can create un-editable documents that are readable on both 
Macs and PCs. (Still, you can capture the screenshots of PDFs, so they’re not 
entirely secure.)
Saving as a pile of pictures
The last five Save As options save the slides of your presentation as a folder 
full of pictures in the format that you select. JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, and TIFF 
are the supported file formats.
 
Pop a blank CD into your Mac and click the OK button in the Open Finder 
panel that appears. Use the JPEG option to save your presentation to the CD, 
and then eject the CD and let Finder burn the disc. Most new DVD players for 
television sets can play this disc as a slide show. You might have to explore 
your DVD player’s menus a bit to discover how to turn this feature on.

n the preceding chapters in Book IV, we go over the file formats you use 
in PowerPoint, as well as some fundamentals. Now, it’s time to let your 
creative juices start flowing. In this chapter, you can find out about the pro-
cess of building content-rich slides that your audience will enjoy and that 
you can present confidently. We cover how to start from a template or start 
from scratch, and then introduce you to using PowerPoint’s rich interface. 
You can discover ways to present a slide show and how to organize slides 
within a show.
Creating a Presentation
To create presentation slides, you need more than just good PowerPoint 
skills. Great slides require time and thought, and we can help you with the 
former by showing you how to use PowerPoint more effectively so that you 
can use all that saved time to create compelling stories and flows for your 
presentation slides.
A slide presentation is composed of two phases — the creation phase and the 
presentation phase. You might be responsible for either creating or present-
ing the slides, or maybe you play both roles. Either way, you have to know the 
topic of your presentation well. You may also have supplementary content 
from which to work, such as a Word document or an existing presentation. 
You may have pictures, graphs, sounds, and movies in your computer or 
somewhere at the back of your mind. Or you may be starting from scratch. 
Either way, PowerPoint has ways to help you. But remember, PowerPoint can 
only help you present your content well; it can’t create the content.

524
Creating a Presentation
Starting from a Microsoft Word document
Having content in a Microsoft Word document can save a lot of time. Open 
your document in Microsoft Word. Choose View➪Outline to use Word’s 
Outline View. If you think your outline is good enough to work from, 
you can send it right into PowerPoint from Word by choosing File➪Send 
To➪Microsoft PowerPoint. If you like working with outlines in PowerPoint, 
you can click the Outline button above the slide preview to use an outline 
to build your slide show. If you prefer working in Word, PowerPoint can 
send your presentation’s outline directly to Word; just choose File➪Send 
To➪Microsoft Word. Another way to share an outline is to use PowerPoint’s 
capability to save in outline format by choosing File➪Save As; then selecting 
Outline/Rich Text Format (.rtf) from the Format pop-up menu.
Starting from Project Gallery
PowerPoint offers many options to help you begin a presentation; you can 
choose from whichever you think suits you best. If you’ve been following 
along through other chapters, by now you know we’re partial to Project 
Gallery as a great place from which to start. If you don’t know what Project 
Gallery is, you can get the scoop in Book I, Chapter 2.
To open Project Gallery, click PowerPoint’s Dock icon. If Project Gallery 
doesn’t open immediately, choose File➪Project Gallery (see Figure 3-1) to open 
Project Gallery. Click the New tab to see the many starting points available.
 
Figure 3-1:

In Project Gallery’s Category list, you can explore almost 50 Office themes, 
presentation templates, or blank documents. If you want to follow along with 
our screen shots, select Presentations in the Category list; then double-click 
the Introducing PowerPoint 2008 presentation template.

Choosing a View
Choosing a View
You can choose from several different view options to build slides in 
PowerPoint, and they are essentially equivalent. Our advice is to try 
building slides in all of them and then use the view you prefer. In the 
following sections, we explore the various views.
Using Normal View
When you open a built-in template or theme, you’re in Normal View. (Refer 
to Book IV, Chapter 1, where we show you Normal View.) The Outline tab 
appears at the top of the slide thumbnails. Click the Outline tab to edit text 
in an outline, as shown in Figure 3-2. While you type in the outline, text in 
the slide updates automatically in the placeholders on the slide. Conversely, 
if you type in the text placeholders of the slide, the outline automatically 
updates. The outline and the slide pane are always synchronized.

Text placeholders are part of a slide layout and are different from the 
common text boxes that you add by choosing Insert➪Text Box. Any text that 
you add within text boxes (as opposed to text placeholders) isn’t synced 
with the outline.
Switching to Slide View
You work the same way in Slide View as you do in Normal View, except that 
in Slide View, you don’t see the left pane, so you have more room in which to 
work directly on your slide. To get to Slide View from Normal View, click the 
Slide View button, as shown in Figure 3-2.

526
Choosing a View
Adding notations in Notes Page View
Choose View➪Notes Page to see another PowerPoint View. Shown in Figure 3-3, 
Notes Page View lets you add a lot of additional material to support the slide 
the audience sees. You can use features similar to that of Microsoft Word 
in the Notes section. Notes Page View’s Notes section supports bullets and 
numbering, as well as tables and graphs, and can include additional informa-
tion you might want to have at your fingertips, such as supplemental infor-
mation that can help you answer anticipated audience questions when the 
presentation is running. You can also print Notes Page View for your slides 
and use them as handouts. Instructors and students can use Notes Page 
View to annotate their slide shows. Notes Page View is an excellent place to 
properly attribute the sources of slide content.

details with

View.
 
 
When you’re using Presenter Tools View (see Book IV, Chapter 1) to present 
a slide show, you not only get to see your slide notes, but you can also edit 
them while the slide show is running.
Switching from one view to another
You switch from one view to another a lot when you use PowerPoint. We 
recommend that you create a custom toolbar and put all the view options 
on it. Refer to Book I, Chapter 3 for detailed information on customizing tool-
bars and menus. Figure 3-4 shows a toolbar that can be used to switch views.

 We’re almost done with the Introduction to PowerPoint 2008 slide show

While the show is running, click the mouse, press the spacebar, or use the 
arrow keys to advance the presentation. Enjoy just watching this nicely 
made presentation. When you’re done, you can close this presentation.
Starting from Scratch
Even though Project Gallery has many options, you may prefer to create a 
project that is 100-percent your own. You have nearly infinite customization 
capabilities at your disposal in PowerPoint, so go ahead and use them cre-
atively. So that you can more easily investigate PowerPoint’s editing capa-
bilities, and not always depend on PowerPoint’s template offerings, in this 
section, we show you how you can start from scratch with a new, blank 
presentation. Press Ô-N or choose File➪New Presentation to get started 
with a blank canvas, as shown in Figure 3-5.

Adding a New Slide
Every slide show needs a beginning, so PowerPoint starts you off with a title 
slide. Title slides have two boxes that are text placeholders, each of which 
contains a prompt that urges you to click into the placeholder and start 
typing. When you type in a placeholder, the text you type is synchronized 
with the Outline pane, as we mention in the section “Using Normal View,” 
earlier in this chapter.
 
Text that you put into other kinds of objects, such as Charts, SmartArt, and 
WordArt, doesn’t appear in the Outline pane.
Adding a New Slide
 
 Usually, only the first slide of a presentation is a title slide. You create the 
rest of the slides from the variety of choices waiting for you on the Slide 
Layouts tab of Elements Gallery. See Figure 3-6, which shows that we added 
a title and content slide layout. The Slide Layouts tab in Elements Gallery 
has several other slide layouts: 11 preset layouts of placeholders for titles, 
text, charts, pictures, media, and so on. If you don’t see Elements Gallery, 
click the Gallery button on PowerPoint’s standard toolbar, and then click the 
Slide Layouts tab to display layouts.
Using keyboard shortcuts in PowerPoint
Although you can customize keyboard short-
cuts in Word and Excel, the keyboard shortcuts 
available in PowerPoint are built in and can’t be 
customized within PowerPoint. But that doesn’t 
mean you can’t create your own shortcuts by 
using Mac OS X.
Click PowerPoint’s Help button on the Standard 
toolbar and search for the term keyboard short-
cuts. Be sure to check out each of these very 
nicely produced topics:
 ✓ Customize Your Applications by Using 
Accessibility Features. A complete, free, 
20-minute course that describes how to 
customize Mac OS X.
 ✓ PowerPoint Keyboard Shortcuts: Lists 
all the keyboard shortcuts available in 
PowerPoint.
 ✓ Common Office Keyboard Shortcuts: Lists 
many keyboard shortcuts used throughout 
Office.
You’ll be glad that PowerPoint’s Help section 
has been completely redone for 2008. You 
can even have Help open while you work in 
PowerPoint!

When you first start working with PowerPoint, both the All Layouts and 
Office Theme buttons show the same standard 11 slide layouts. We explain 
how to create your own, custom layouts and add them to Elements Gallery 
when we talk about slide masters in Book IV, Chapter 4. When you select the 
Insert New Slide button and click a slide layout, insertion indicators light up. 
They light up when Elements Gallery will add a new slide instead of changing 
the current slide’s layout.
We discuss the title and content layout so that you can see how the new 
slide layout placeholders work. Inside the Bullets placeholder is an arrange-
ment of six content buttons. You can type your own content in the place-
holder and/or click a content button. Move your cursor over each button to 
see the kind of content you can insert. If you insert a picture by using a con-
tent button, the picture is sized to fit the placeholder. Experiment with these 
options to see that you can have either text or content in the placeholder.

Formatting the Background
Formatting the Background
 
 If the Formatting Palette isn’t turned on, click the Toolbox button on the 
Standard toolbar and then click the Formatting Palette button. Pay attention 
to the Formatting Palette while you work. The available options change 
every time you select or click some element of the interface.
For example, to format the background, just click anywhere on the back-
ground outside the border of any placeholders. The Formatting Palette 
instantly changes to offer a variety of background choices, as shown in 
Figure 3-7.
 
Figure 3-7:

by using the

The default slide backgrounds available are based on the active Office theme 
applied to the presentation. We cover how you can apply an Office theme 
in the section “Applying a New Theme,” later in this chapter. For now, be 
aware that these are coordinated backgrounds that always work well and 
look good with all sorts of foreground content. However, you’re not limited 
to those choices. Take another look at the bottom of the Formatting Palette. 
Beneath the Slide Background options in Figure 3-7, you can spot a Format 
Background button that you can click to open the full-featured Format 
Background dialog, shown in Figure 3-8.

Although you’ve probably seen this sort of dialog in other applications in 
Microsoft Office, this one is different. We want to focus on the new, fun gra-
dient fills. The new fancy fill effects are available in other shapes — even in 
graphs and charts!
Gradient backgrounds
To experiment with applying a gradient fill to a background, follow these steps:
 
1. Make sure that you have the Slide Background pane of the Formatting 
Palette visible and click the Format Background button.
 
 Clicking this button opens a Format Background dialog.
 
2. In the left pane, click Fill. Then, click the Gradient tab.
 
 The interface that you see in Figure 3-8 appears.
 
3. Set the Style to Linear.
 
 Other options include Radial, Rectangular, Path, and From Tile. For now, 
stay with Linear.

4. Spin the Angle dial by holding the mouse button down on the dial and 
dragging around a bit.
 
 You can spin the dial only when you use the Linear style. And you don’t 
even have to spin if you’re comfortable typing at the angle value shown 
in the box.
 
5. Click the Add Color button to add an extra color stop to the Gradient 
bar.
 
 You can choose a color for this stop from the Color Palette pop-up 
menu. You can also change the transparency value for this stop by drag-
ging the Transparency slider in the Color and Transparency portion of 
the dialog.
 
6. Add more color stops or select the existing ones and edit as required.
 
 You can drag the gradient sliders to achieve various effects. You 
can drag sliders over each other. Watch while your slide reflects the 
changes.
 
7. Click the Apply button to apply your format to the current slide, or 
click the Apply to All button to apply your new format to all slides in 
the presentation.
 
 You can also click the Cancel button to make no changes.
As you can see, working with gradient fills is so much fun that it can get 
really addictive! To see samples of gradients and more options, go to the fol-
lowing URL, which contains tutorials by Geetesh:
www.indezine.com/products/powerpoint/learn/fillslinesand
effects/gradientstops2007.html
Although these tutorials show PowerPoint 2007 screen shots, they explain 
the same things you can do in PowerPoint 2008.
Clicking for additional options
To access additional options, you can right-click or Control-click the edges 
of placeholders, objects, and the PowerPoint interface itself. Each time you 
click, a pop-up menu of context-sensitive choices appears. When you right-
click or Control-click the background, for example, you can easily set guide 
and gridline controls, as shown in Figure 3-9.

Formatting Bullets and Numbers
After just a short time, the stock bullet points in PowerPoint can get tire-
some. No one wants to see the same bullets over and over, and sometimes 
it’s a great idea to just have no bullets (which we cover in the section “Living 
in no-bullet land,” later in this chapter). One way to get around the problem 
of seeing the same bullets is to use custom bullets. Try to choose subdued 
bullets that complement your subject. We’re not trying to focus attention on 
the bullet, but on the point!
Customizing bullet and number characters
 
In PowerPoint, while you’re typing a bulleted list, you can use the Formatting 
Palette to select new characters for your bullets. Office 2008 lets you access 
the Mac OS X Characters Palette. Follow these steps to use this new feature:
 
1. In the Bullets and Numbering section of the Formatting Palette, click 
the triangle to activate the pop-up Style menu.
 
 If the option is grayed out, it means that you don’t have any text with 
bullet levels selected.
 
2. At the bottom of the Style pop-up menu, choose Bullets and 
Numbering.
 
 This step opens the Format Text dialog, as shown in Figure 3-10.
 
3. In the left pane, choose Bullets and Numbering if it’s not already selected.
 
 If you started off formatting bullets, you can proceed to Step 4. If your 
list was set to numbers, you need to be on the Numbering tab of the 
dialog, where you can select from custom number options.

4. Select which bullet level you want to customize.
 
 Level numbering starts at zero (None) in the top left. The highest-level 
number is seven, represented by the bullet-level button at the bottom-
right of the series of Bullet Levels, as shown in Figure 3-10.
 
5. Click the Custom Bullet pop-up menu in the lower-right corner of the 
Bullets and Numbering pane.
 
6. Choose Character from the Custom Bullet pop-up menu.
 
 The Mac OS X Characters Palette opens, and you can select from spe-
cial characters from many fonts. (See Figure 3-11.) Despite the complex 
appearance of the Characters Palette, you can simply choose a category 
from the category list, and then select a bullet you find appealing.
 
7. Click Insert to choose your selection and close the Characters Palette.
 
 The Format Text dialog now displays the character that you chose in Step 6.
 
8. (Optional) Select a color from the Color pop-up menu and change the 
bullet size by using the Increase/Decrease control.
 
9. Click OK to apply the custom bullet to the selected level and close the 
Format Text dialog.
 
 If you have any bullets in your presentation that are at the customized 
level, they now display the customized bullet.

Living in no-bullet land
We don’t expect you to stop using bullets, but we want to encourage you 
to experiment with slides that contain no bullets. Try a new approach: Use 
phrases and add a visual on a slide with a compelling title. Try this method 
for a few slides in each presentation to start with, and then evolve your own 
style while you get more comfortable with a no-bullets approach.
Customizing bullets by using SmartArt graphics
Another option to foregoing bullets uses SmartArt graphics, which are new 
to Office 2008, and they allow you to format your bullet points in new, attrac-
tive ways. See our vertical bullet list before-and-after example in Figure 3-12.
You start by making your points in the regular fashion. Then, follow these 
steps:
 
 1. Select the bullet points you want to format.
 
 
 Click once anywhere in the text to place the insertion cursor within 
that text. Then, drag the mouse to highlight all the text within the bullet 
points, as shown in Figure 3-12.

3. Click one of the bullet list graphics.
 
 That’s all you need to do! Your bullet points are instantly deleted, and 
SmartArt formatting takes their place.
Applying a New Theme
 
If you’ve been following along, we’ve built a small presentation of disparate 
slides that’s rather plain. We can add pizzazz instantly by formatting it with 
one of PowerPoint’s new slide themes. Elements Gallery comes with a vari-
ety of great themes, so all you have to do is click the Slide Themes tab and 
select one you like (see Figure 3-13).

Creating Smaller Versions with Custom Shows
In Book I, Chapter 3, we explain how you can create your own themes. In 
that chapter, we suggest places to save themes so that you can find them 
in Elements Gallery and Project Gallery. In case you decided on an alter-
nate location for your themes, you can click the Browse button in Elements 
Gallery to open the Choose Themed Document or Slide Template dialog 
and navigate in Mac OS X Finder to find them. Don’t forget that you can use 
Spotlight in this dialog to speed your search.
Creating Smaller Versions with Custom Shows
We have a prediction to make. If you follow our tips, you’ll make great slide 
shows. You’ll wind up with one that takes three hours to present fully. 
People will attend and love it. You’re then asked to give your presentation 
again, but you’re offered only one hour in which to present. That’s where 
PowerPoint’s Custom Shows feature fits in. This feature lets you create 
smaller versions and different-order versions of your slide shows. To set up 
a smaller version of a slide show, sometimes called a child version, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Go to the Slide Show menu and choose Custom Shows (see Figure 3-14).
 
 The Custom Shows dialog opens.
 
2. Click the New button to create your first custom show in the Define 
Custom Show dialog, as shown in Figure 3-15.
 
 The Define Custom Show dialog appears. The left pane has all the slides 
in your existing presentation:
 
• Add: Click Add to assign selected slides from the Slides in 
Presentation list (on the left side) to the Slides in Custom Show list 
(on the right side).
 
• Remove: Click Remove to remove selected slides from the Slides in 
Custom Show list on the right side.
Getting more themes, backgrounds, and templates
Office for Mac can use all the themes, back-
grounds, and templates that work in Office for 
Windows. The only exception is that because 
Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) isn’t in 
PowerPoint 2008, templates that use VBA don’t 
work. You can download hundreds (okay, that’s 
thousands) of free templates and themes from 
Indezine at this URL: 
www.indezine.com/powerpoint/
templates/freetemplates.html
Again, refer to Book I, Chapter 3 to find out 
where to put themes so that they appear in 
Elements Gallery and Project Gallery.

3. Click OK to close the Define Custom Show dialog, and then click OK 
again to close the Custom Shows dialog.
 
Figure 3-14: 
Creating a

To present a custom show, again choose SlideShow➪Custom Shows. (See 
Figure 3-14.) The default setting is to use the Presenter Tools View to pres-
ent the show when you click the Show button. If you deselect the Open 
Custom Show in Presenter View check box, the slide show opens without 
using Presenter Tools when you click the Show button.
Another way to make subsets of slide shows is to choose SlideShow➪Set Up 
Show. In the Slides portion of Set Up Show, you can choose a range of slides 
or default to a custom show.
You can set overrides to other slide show settings in Set Up Show. If you 
decide to use this dialog to override your other settings, make a note to 
yourself in a slide note or comment so that you don’t wonder why all your 
slides aren’t playing.

In This Chapter

✓ Fine-tuning slide layouts

✓ Customizing Notes Page View
✓ Exploring the handout master
K
nowing what a master is can make you seem like a PowerPoint guru, 
even though the subject isn’t complex, as long as you follow the basics. 
With just a few hints from us, you can be in control of PowerPoint, using mas-
ters in ways that make your friends want to have your PowerPoint skills.
Allow us to explain what we’re talking about when we use the word master. 
A master is in charge. In PowerPoint, you find several masters, each over-
looking their respective domains. Using Slide Masters can save you a lot of 
time while you build presentations. The idea behind a master is that you put 
text, adjust formatting, or add objects to the master, and the changes are 
instantly reflected throughout the entire presentation. PowerPoint handles 
these masters efficiently, so your presentation’s file size doesn’t grow pro-
portionately, which is important when distributing your presentations.
The neat part is that you’re in charge of all PowerPoint’s masters. They’re 
here to do your bidding. And new for PowerPoint 2008, you have the abil-
ity to edit your own slide layouts. PowerPoint has several different kinds of 
masters (all of which we explain in this chapter):
 
✦ Slide Master: Whatever text, formatting, or objects you apply to the 
Slide Master are instantly applied to the entire presentation and to any 
layouts.
 
✦ Layout (also called Layout Master or sub-master): Masters for slide 
layouts.
 
✦ Notes Master: Controls the format of Notes Page View.
 
✦ Handout Master: Formats printed handouts.

540
Putting a Master Slide in Charge
Putting a Master Slide in Charge
In every presentation, one slide trumps the rest. It’s called the Slide Master. 
It’s the slide that you see when you choose View➪Master➪Slide Master. You 
can tell which one is the Slide Master because, as you can see in Figure 4-1, 
it’s placed in a position of power in the upper-left corner, and it’s bigger 
than the slide layouts, which fittingly appear below the Slide Master in the 
thumbnails pane.
The Slide Master has sub-masters called Layouts that control various slide 
layouts (what else?). To illustrate some of the things you can do, we’ll use the 
Introducing PowerPoint 2008 presentation from Project Gallery (see Book IV, 
Chapter 3).
Getting your bearings in Slide Master View
Slide Master View is seemingly similar to Normal View in that all the regular 
formatting options are available. However, you can find differences if you 
look carefully. The thumbnail pane doesn’t show the slides in your presenta-
tion (see Figure 4-1). Instead, it shows the Slide Master at the top as a larger 
thumbnail, followed by smaller thumbnails that represent a master for each 
of the layouts that appears on the Layout tab of Elements Gallery. Not sur-
prisingly, each of these sub-masters is called a slide layout.
The Notes pane is absent from the Slide Master View because these aren’t 
the actual slides you present — they’re masters that influence those slides. 
Notes Page View has its own master, discussed in the section “Taking Note of 
Notes Masters,” later in this chapter.
 
When working with masters and sub-masters, keep in mind the relationships 
between the slides and the layouts that you see in Normal View with the mas-
ters you see in Slide Master View. In particular, be aware of the following:
 
✦ Any changes in the Slide Master affect each slide layout under it unless 
you format a specific slide layout differently. Changes are also applied to 
the slides in your presentation.
 
✦ Any changes you make to the individual slide layouts don’t affect the 
Slide Master. Changes made to slide layouts influence only slides in the 
presentation that are based on those particular layouts.
Go ahead and make changes to the Slide Master. To watch how the layouts 
are affected when you modify the Slide Master, first open a slide presenta-
tion. Make sure that you’re in Slide Master View and click anywhere on the 
background of the Slide Master (in the larger pane of the window where 
it says Click to Edit Master Title Style). Then, choose an option from the 
Formatting Palette’s Slide Background section to change the background.

Slide layouts
Your change is instantly incorporated into all the slide layouts, as well as the 
Slide Master slides. Choose View➪Normal to switch to Normal View, and you 
can see that your slide show now has the new background, as does the Slide 
Layouts tab of Elements Gallery. If you need to put a logo on your slide so 
that it appears on every slide in the presentation, you insert that logo in the 
Slide Master.
Looking at a new toolbar
When you visit Slide Master View, a new toolbar appears, ready to get to 
work. You must be in Slide Master View to see and use the Master toolbar. 
When in Slide Master View, choose View➪Toolbars➪Master to toggle on the 
Master toolbar, and you should see the toolbar that’s shown in Figure 4-2.
When working with a Slide Master, only the first two buttons are available to 
use on the Master toolbar. The rest of the buttons come alive when you’re work-
ing with slide layouts. Move the cursor over each button to see what it does or 
what kind of placeholder will be inserted into a slide layout when it’s clicked.

Formatting Slide Layouts
 
Although the Slide Master is the big chief, you can format each of the built-in 
slide layouts independently. You should wait until you’re finished formatting 
the Slide Master before you format any of the slide layouts for two reasons:
 
✦ The logical hierarchy is to first create a common look for all your slides 
and then make subtle differences in the slide layouts.
 
✦ When you format a slide layout so that it’s different from its Slide Master, 
that particular layout, as well as slides in the presentation based on that 
particular layout, display the slide layout’s different formatting. After 
you format a layout, you can get different results when you go back and 
reformat the Slide Master, depending on what steps you take.
Follow these steps to format a Master Slide and a layout:
 
 1. Click Toolbox on PowerPoint’s Standard toolbar to activate Toolbox.
 
 2. Select the Formatting Palette, if it isn’t already visible.
 
 3. Open a new, blank PowerPoint presentation by clicking the New 
button on the Standard toolbar.
 
 A new, blank presentation appears.
 
4. Choose File➪Master➪Slide Master.
 
 The Slide Master appears.
 
5. Apply a background format to the Slide Master.
 
 Use any of these methods:
 
• In the Slide Background section of the Formatting Palette, select a 
slide background.
 
• In the Slide Background section of the Formatting Palette, click the 
Format Background button to display the Format Background dialog. 
In the dialog, select a format, and then click Apply to apply the 
format and return to the Slide Master.

Formatting Slide Layouts
 
• Right-click or Control-click either the background of the Slide Master 
or the Slide Master’s thumbnail. From the pop-up menu that appears, 
select Format Background to open the Format Background dialog. In 
the dialog, select a format, and then click Apply to apply the format 
and return to the Slide Master.
 
• Choose Format➪Slide Background to display the Format Background 
dialog. In the dialog, select a format, and then click Apply to apply 
the format and return to the Slide Master.
 
• From the Slide Themes tab in Elements Gallery, select a Slide theme 
(which also affects fonts).
 
 The backgrounds of all the slide layouts under the Slide Master take on 
the format applied to the Slide Master.
 
6. Select one or more of the layout thumbnails under the Slide Master.
 
 Use ordinary selection techniques.
 
7. Choose a different background format for just the selected layouts.
 
 Use any of the methods shown in the first four bullets of Step 5. You 
can’t use the last option (the Slide Theme tab) in the list because Slide 
Theme formats affect more than just one layout.
 
 The backgrounds of the selected slide layouts now display the formatting 
you chose. The Master Slide and all other layouts remain unchanged.
Your creative desires may not be fully satisfied with the background of the 
Slide Master. But don’t worry; you can reformat that Slide Master background.
To reformat the Slide Master without affecting background changes that you 
made to individual layouts, select the Slide Master in the list of thumbnails, 
and then do any of the following:
 
✦ In the Slide Background section of the Formatting Palette, click the 
Format Background button. The Format Background dialog appears. In 
the dialog, select a format, and then click Apply to apply the format and 
return to the Slide Master.
 
✦ Right-click or Control-click either the background of the Slide Master 
or the Slide Master’s thumbnail view. From the pop-up menu choose 
Format Background. The Format Background dialog displays. In the 
dialog, select a format, and then click Apply to apply the format and 
return to the Slide Master.
 
✦ Choose Format➪Slide Background to display the Format Background 
dialog. Make formatting choices, and then click Apply to close the dialog 
and apply your choices.
 
✦ In the Document Theme section of the Formatting Palette, click Colors 
and select a document theme from the pop-up menu that appears.

544
Adding Another Set of Masters
To reformat the Slide Master, override background changes that you made to 
individual layouts, and reset all the master’s layouts, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the Slide Master in the list of thumbnails.
 
2. From the Background section of the Formatting Palette, select a slide 
background.
 
 Any other non-background changes made to a Slide Master, such as 
fonts, inserting a logo, and so on, still influence its slide layouts.
When you move the cursor over a slide layout, a ToolTip tells you the name 
of the layout and the slide numbers that are using the layout, if any (see 
Figure 4-3).
 
Figure 4-3: 
The slide 
layout’s 
name and 
number.
 
 
You can also right-click or Control-click any slide layout in Slide Master View 
to present an amazing array of options, including options that let you add 
new layouts and rename existing ones. 
Just like the Slide Master, you can format all the elements on a slide layout. 
Any slides that use that particular layout get the changes that you make to 
the slide layout. But remember that when you change formatting on a layout, 
you’re breaking the link for the changed element between that slide layout 
and the Slide Master.
Adding Another Set of Masters
A presentation can have more than one Slide Master, and it can have multiple 
slide layouts, too. In fact, you can add Slide Masters with complete sets of 
slide layouts that behave as independent groups. The ability to use multiple 
masters is very powerful stuff compared to the limited amount of customizing 
possible in PowerPoint 2004 and earlier versions of PowerPoint for Mac.
Adding an additional Slide Master with its hierarchical slide layouts to a presen-
tation gives you formatting flexibility. Here’s the way to do it: While working in 
Slide Master View, click the Insert New Master button on the Master toolbar.

Adding More Slide Layouts
That’s all there is to it! See Figure 4-4. Scroll down the thumbnails pane to 
see a set of unformatted masters. You find a new Slide Master and a com-
plete set of unformatted slide layouts. If you format the new Slide Master, the 
formatting affects the new slide layouts, but not your original Slide Master or 
any of its slide layouts.

Adding More Slide Layouts
You can create as many slide layouts as you want. Try creating a new slide 
layout with a subtitle placeholder and one for quotation slides. Then, you 
can rotate and arrange your pictures in another slide layout. To make a new, 
unformatted layout, follow these steps:
 
1. Select any existing Slide Master in Slide Master View.
 
 The selection indicator appears around the thumbnail.
 
2. Click the Insert New Layout button on the Master toolbar (refer to 
Figure 4-2).
 
 A new slide layout appears under the same Slide Master that you select 
in Step 1. Figure 4-5 shows the new slide layout.
 
3. Use the Master toolbar to insert placeholders of various sorts into 
slide layouts.
 
 Arrange them any way you want!

Taking Note of Notes Masters
 
Figure 4-5:

If you like a particular slide layout and want to use it as a basis to create a new 
slide layout by editing and adding placeholders, you can duplicate that slide 
layout easily by selecting the layout within the Slide Master and then pressing 
Ô-D. PowerPoint duplicates the layout, and you can easily rename it by right-
clicking or Control-clicking the layout thumbnail and selecting Rename Layout.
Taking Note of Notes Masters
If you read this chapter from the beginning, after seeing how powerful the 
Slide Masters and slide layouts are, the Notes Master may seem mundane by 
comparison. When you choose View➪Master➪Notes Master, a view similar 
to what’s shown in Figure 4-6 appears. Here, you can select and format the 
layout of the Notes Page View.

✦ Format header and footer: Choose View➪Header and Footer to open 
the Header and Footer dialog (see Chapter 9 in this minibook).
 
✦ Adjust the sizes of the slide preview and the slide notes boxes: Click to 
select the item that you want to resize, and then drag the resize handles 
(see Figure 4-6).
 
✦ Reposition the slide preview and slide notes boxes: Click to select the 
box that you want to reposition, and then click the selection indicator that 
surrounds the box. The mouse turns into a special cursor (see Figure 4-6) 
that lets you drag the box.
 
✦ Rotate the slide preview and slide notes boxes: When a box is selected, 
drag the green Rotate handle, as shown in Figure 4-6.
 
✦ Apply formatting: Use the Formatting Palette.
 
✦ Format the background of the Notes Page View: Click the background 
and select Background Formatting Options from the Formatting Palette.
 
✦ Add SmartArt and other objects: Click the SmartArt tab of Elements 
Gallery and select SmartArt, or click the Object Palette of the Toolbox 
and select objects.
Although you can make dramatic-looking Notes pages with Notes Master, 
remember that if you decide to print the notes, these formatting changes 
will apply. A dark background uses a lot of toner and ink quickly, and compli-
cated formatting can slow your printer. On the other hand, full-bleed fancy 
handouts are impressive for special audiences.
Handling Handout Masters
When you choose View➪Master➪Handout Master, the resulting Master affects 
only the background, header, and footer of slide shows when the slide shows 
are printed. Although you can click the positioning indicators on the Master 
toolbar, as shown in Figure 4-7, the positions can’t be changed or resized.

B
eing confident in the content of your presentation goes a long way to 
easing the worries you might have about being in front of a group. If you 
know that you rehearsed and proofread everything ahead of time, you feel 
and look authoritative and poised, and your audience is friendly and recep-
tive. After all, they came to hear about your subject matter, and you’ll have no 
trouble delivering content to meet their expectations. The information in this 
chapter can help you avoid making obvious mistakes, such as spelling errors, 
and helps you collaborate with others involved in the presentation.
Banishing Spelling Mistakes
PowerPoint uses the same spelling tools as Microsoft Word, which means 
that you get the most powerful word-processing tools right in PowerPoint. 
It’s also important to know that when you’re working in PowerPoint, at 
times, you work outside the reach of the spell checker. We try to steer you 
the right way, and we remind you that there’s a dictionary, thesaurus, and 
language translation tools right in the Toolbox in the Reference Tools pane.
 
Nothing advertises ineptitude more than a spelling mistake in 44-point 
Helvetica projected on a large screen. Oops!
Setting spelling preferences
By default, spelling and grammar settings are turned on. You can adjust 
the settings by choosing PowerPoint➪Preferences, and then selecting the 
Spelling tab, as shown in Figure 5-1. For most people, the default settings 
are fine, and you can leave them alone. In Book II, Chapter 4, we give much 
more detail about how spell checker works, but we repeat a few of the most 
common aspects in this chapter.

550

Getting rid of red squiggles
If PowerPoint thinks you should check the spelling of a word, it puts a little 
red squiggle under it. You can right-click or Control-click the underlined word 
to make PowerPoint suggest one or more replacement words in a pop-up 
window. You can select a replacement from the list and go on your way, or 
you can choose one of the other options on the list, as shown in Figure 5-2.
 
Figure 5-2: 
Putting an 
end to a 
squiggle.
 
Checking the whole presentation
We’ve been known to overlook an occasional red squiggle, so we always 
give the presentation one last thorough check before going before an audi-
ence. Choosing Tools➪Spelling sets PowerPoint on a mission to find spelling 
errors and opens the Spelling pane, as shown in Figure 5-3. This tool goes 
through the entire presentation looking for possible mistakes.
We want to caution you that some objects are off limits to the spell checker. 
If you have a spelling error in a chart, for example, PowerPoint’s spell checker 
won’t find it. Spell checker is only reliable when working with text in Outline 
View.

Correcting automatically while you type
 
 PowerPoint uses Word’s AutoCorrect feature to fix misspellings on the fly 
while you type. PowerPoint has changed a word when you see a little blue 
flash under a word after you type it. You can adjust the AutoCorrect settings 
and make new AutoCorrect replacement text in PowerPoint by choosing 
PowerPoint➪Preferences. Then, select the AutoCorrect tab in the 
Preferences dialog, as shown in Figure 5-4.

Collaborating with Comments
Collaborating with Comments
Although PowerPoint doesn’t have the big, fancy Track Changes feature of 
Word and Excel, it does have a nice Comment feature. You can turn com-
menting tools on by choosing Insert➪Comment or Tools➪Review Comments. 
Taking either action activates the Reviewing toolbar, as shown in Figure 5-5.

Mail Presentation as Attachment
When a new comment is inserted, a text box is created and a marker is put 
into the slide. You can jump through the comments in a presentation by 
using the Previous Comment and Next Comment buttons on the Reviewing 
toolbar. You may choose to edit or delete an existing comment, or make a 
new comment. Comments retain the name of the commentor, plus the date 
of the comment, as shown in Figure 5-6.

In the bonus chapter, we discuss some new ways of collaborating. If you’re 
into the Web 2.0 philosophy that sharing is a great way to create, be sure to 
check out our discussion of OfficeLive and Mesh.
Remembering to Remember
 
 You might want to remind yourself to look at any given presentation for 
many possible reasons. You can set a reminder by using the Task feature of 
Entourage. But you can also set a reminder right from within PowerPoint. 
Choose Tools➪Flag for Follow Up to open a pane that lets you set a date and 
time that you want to be reminded to come back to the current presentation, 
as shown in Figure 5-7.

Remembering to Remember
Flag for Follow Up works even when PowerPoint isn’t running. If you want 
to remind yourself to look at your presentation prior to your scheduled live 
presentation delivery time, use Follow Up. You can also use Follow Up to 
remind yourself of a deadline associated with some aspect of your presenta-
tion’s production. Your computer does have to be running for Follow Up to 
work, of course.

Chapter 6: Adding Text, Pictures, 
Tables, and Charts
In This Chapter
✓ Formatting text
✓ Bringing your pictures home
✓ Inserting a chart
✓ Creating fancy tables
I
n this chapter, we discuss how PowerPoint works with text, pictures, 
charts and tables. Each is quite different in the way it presents infor-
mation on slides, but PowerPoint works with them all similarly. Most of 
the time, you follow a selection-and-action routine to format any of these. 
After you make a selection, extra options appear right on the Toolbox’s 
Formatting Palette. We’re going to unleash your creative juices and do it in a 
way that results in great-looking presentations. When you give your presen-
tation, your audience will focus on the screen. That sure takes a lot of pres-
sure off your job as a presenter, and it makes you appear more confident, 
consistent, and coordinated with your slides!
Before we go too far, we want to remind you that in Book I, Chapters 3 
through 7, we cover the basics about many topics that we expand on in this 
chapter. We don’t want to take your money and just repeat things, so be 
sure to review the earlier chapters before venturing into this one; several 
topics build on the basics covered in Book I.
Getting the Right Text Format
It’s fast and easy to use the text that comes in PowerPoint’s lavish themes 
and templates. You often need to customize fonts and reposition text to 
make the text fit and look right. Choosing a different font or making a font 
larger can make your presentation more readable for someone sitting at the 
rear of a large room. Some organizations specify that you must use a specific 
font to maintain consistency with their themes and templates. Sometimes, 
you want to customize text just for fun, which can keep your presentation 
interesting. This section can help you with your font-formatting needs.

556
Getting the Right Text Format
 
Watch the Formatting Palette while you work on text. You can use its endless 
options to customize your text to make it interesting. Figure 6-1 illustrates 
many of PowerPoint’s new text-formatting features.
 
Figure 6-1: 
Discovering 
new text-
formatting 
possibilities.
 
You can get text into your slides quickly. To insert a new slide and add text, 
follow these steps:
 
 1. Click the New Slide button on the Standard toolbar.
 
 
 A new slide appears.
 
2. If the new slide doesn’t have placeholders, choose a slide layout that 
has placeholders from the Slide Layouts tab of Elements Gallery.
 
3. Click any placeholder and start typing to replace the dummy text.
 
 To add a text box to an existing slide, click the Text Box button on the Standard 
toolbar. Click the slide to place a text box, and then start typing some text.
In both the instances, you type text into a container — either a text place-
holder or a text box. Note the following:
 
✦ When the insertion cursor (the blinking vertical bar) is inside a text box 
or placeholder, or if you highlight text characters by dragging the mouse 
over them, any formatting that you apply affects text that’s inside the 
container text box or placeholder.
 
✦ If you click the border of a text box or placeholder, you have selected the 
box shape (the container, rather than the enclosed text), so any format-
ting you apply affects the text box or placeholder shape, not the text 
inside the box.

and Charts
557
Getting the Right Text Format
Compare the left text box and the right text box in Figure 6-2. On the left, we 
added reflection while the cursor was inside the text box. On the right, we 
clicked the border of the text box and then added reflection.
 
Figure 6-2: 
Reflecting 
on what’s 
selected.
 
Having the ability to pick and choose what you want formatted gives you 
the flexibility to format the contents of a box, or the text box or placeholder 
itself. We call this thinking inside and about the box at the same time! This 
flexibility means that you should pay attention while you’re working so that 
you apply the formatting to either the box contents, or to the placeholder 
or text box, as you intend. This attention ultimately goes back to what you 
select in the first place.
Also, pay close attention to what’s selected when you click the More Options 
buttons that are in some sections of the Formatting Palette. If the cursor is 
within the text when you click the More Options button under Quick Styles 
and Effects, you get the Format Text dialog, as shown in Figure 6-3. Format 
Text options apply formatting to the text that’s inside the text box, but it 
doesn’t affect the surrounding box or placeholder.
 
Figure 6-3: 
Thinking 
inside a 
text box — 
Format Text.
 

558
Getting the Right Text Format
On the other hand, if you click the border of that same text box and then 
click the More Options button under Quick Styles and Effects, you get the 
Format Shape dialog shown in Figure 6-4. Format Shape options apply for-
matting to the shape (either the text box or placeholder) that surrounds the 
text, not the text inside the text box or placeholder. Format Text and Format 
Shape have one item in common — the Text Box settings.
To make it even easier to see the differences between Format Text and 
Format Shape, we put the left panes of each of these two wizards next to 
each other in Figure 6-5.

Importing a Batch of Pictures
Importing a Batch of Pictures
In PowerPoint 2008, PowerPoint automatically scales pictures when you 
import them from other sources. To insert a picture on a slide:
 
 1. Click the Picture button on the Standard toolbar and then select 
Insert Picture from the pop-up menu.
 
 
 The Choose a Picture dialog appears.
 
2. Navigate to any picture or use Spotlight to locate a picture.
 
3. Select a picture file, and then click Insert.
 
 The picture appears on your slide.
If your picture is smaller than the size of your PowerPoint slide, the picture 
is centered on the slide. If the picture is larger than the slide, PowerPoint 
automatically scales the picture to fit the slide, and it offers a widget to 
bypass the automatic scaling, as shown in Figure 6-6.
 
Figure 6-6: 
Skipping the 
automatic 
scaling of 
a picture.
 
We have to admit that we’ve been frustrated by this topic. While we 
write this, no one has figured out a way to import a batch of pictures into 
PowerPoint 2008 for Mac. We know there’s a built-in feature in PowerPoint 
for Windows that does it, but that feature isn’t in PowerPoint for Mac. One of 
the authors of this book has a popular add-in that works in earlier versions 
of PowerPoint, but without VBA, it just doesn’t work in PowerPoint 2008.
While we contemplated what to tell you about this dilemma, we decided to 
take one last look at AppleScript. Well, we figured it out! Moreover, thanks 
to Apple’s new Automator Actions and Microsoft Office’s integration with 
Automator, we think we can explain how to create your own Automator 
Action to import a batch of pictures into PowerPoint. It takes just two 
Automator Actions. The resulting Automator script imports pictures from 
iPhoto into PowerPoint.
Making an Automator Action
Even if you’re new to Automator, we’re a bit proud that we figured this out 
and can share it with you in an easy-to-get-started way. You should be able 
to do this, even if you’ve never used Automator. It’s a testament to how well 

560
Importing a Batch of Pictures
things work together on the Mac. Follow these steps to create an Automator 
action that can import a batch of pictures into PowerPoint:
 
1. Open the Automator application.
 
 You can find Automator in the Applications folder. The Select a Starting 
Point to Open a New Workflow dialog appears, as shown in Figure 6-7.
 
2. Select the Custom option and then click the Choose button to start a 
new workflow (see Figure 6-7).
 
 The Select a Starting Point to Open a New Workflow dialog closes. 
Automator launches with the interface that you can see in Figure 6-8. 
The right side is empty except for a prompt that you can ignore for the 
moment.
 
3. In the left pane, click the disclosure triangle next to Library to display 
the subheadings shown in Figure 6-8.

4. In the list of subheadings, click Photos to select that category.
 
 Again, see Figure 6-8.
 
5. From the list of actions, drag Get Specified iPhoto Items to the right 
pane, as shown in Figure 6-9.
 
 The Automator Action should appear in the pane on the right side.
 
6. In your new Get Specified iPhoto Items box, move the mouse cursor 
over the word Options near the bottom of the action.
 
 Options reveals itself as a button.
 
7. Click Options.
 
 See Figure 6-9.
 
8. Select the check box for Show This Action When the Workflow Runs.
 
9. Go back to the left pane and click the Presentations category.
 
10. From the list of actions, drag Create PowerPoint Picture Slide Shows 
to the right pane.
 
 Automator joins the two actions, as shown in Figure 6-9.
 
11. From Automator’s menu, choose File➪Save as Plug-In. Change the 
lower pop-up to Plug-In for Script Menu, as shown in Figure 6-10. Give 
the plug-in an appropriate name, as shown, and then click the Save 
button.
 
12. Choose Automator➪Quit Automator to exit the Automator application.
 
 Congratulations! You’ve now made the workflow, and you can use it 
in PowerPoint whenever you want. If Automator asks you to save this 
workflow again while quitting Automator, do the resave.

Running the Automator Action
After you make an Automator Action (as described in the preceding section), 
you can use it to import a batch of pictures from iPhoto. When you’re ready, 
run the action by following these steps:
 
1. Open PowerPoint to a new, blank presentation.
 
2. Click the rightmost script menu on the menu bar.
 
 You may see two identical script icons on your menu bar. The rightmost 
one produces the menu shown in Figure 6-11.
 
Figure 6-11: 
Running the 
Automator 
script.
 
 
3. At the bottom of the menu, select your Automator script to run it.
 
 The script is running properly if you see the Get Specified iPhoto Items 
pane (see Figure 6-12) and a status notification in the menu bar at the 
top of your screen.
 
 Get Specified iPhoto Items starts off empty. This small pane might be 
behind the PowerPoint window, so move the window to the side if you 
don’t see the pane shown in Figure 6-12.

 This pane has many likable features. Try the following:
 
• If you select only an album in the top section and then click the Add 
button, the entire album is imported.
 
• If you select iPhoto at the top and then click the Add button, your 
entire iPhoto collection may be imported, so be careful!
 
• If you click an album and resize the window to be a little larger, you 
can see previews of your photos. You can select individual photos 

564

one at a time and then click the Add button, or hold the Command 
(Ô) key down and click to select multiple pictures.
 
• After you click the Add button in the picture chooser, the pane 
shown in Figure 6-12 reappears. In this pane, you can click the Add 
button and return to the picture chooser shown in Figure 6-13 to get 
more pictures. You can go back and forth until you have all the pic-
tures you want imported from your albums.
 
6. If you need to remove a picture from the list, click the Remove button, 
as shown in Figure 6-14.
 
7. When you’re done selecting pictures to import into PowerPoint, click 
the Continue button.
 
Figure 6-14: 
Importing 
pictures — 
continue 
after making 
selections.
 
Clicking the Continue button may cause iPhoto to come to the front, but you can 
switch to PowerPoint and watch while the pictures you selected are imported, 
one picture per slide. Large pictures are automatically sized to fit the slides, and 
smaller pictures are centered on the slides. Is this great or what?!
It took only two Automator Actions to create the workflow plug-in. You don’t 
need to know any programming. In just a few minutes, you can make a fully 
functional, useful program that would have taken a professional programmer 
days to make by using VBA or another programming language. It’s worth 
your while to go back into Automator when you have a chance and explore 
more actions. You can find out a lot about Automator at this Apple Web site: 
www.apple.com/macosx/features/300.html#automator.
Charting the (New) Way
Microsoft provides an entirely new way to make graphs and charts in Office 
2008. In PowerPoint, it takes two clicks to get started with a chart. Because 
charting is now done the same way in all the Office applications, we cover 
this topic in Book I, Chapter 5, so head there now for the details. Very little is 
specific to PowerPoint with regard to charts, except for these steps that you 
take to insert a chart:

Tipping the Tables
 
1. Navigate to the slide where you want to insert a new chart and click 
the Charts tab of Elements Gallery.
 
 
 If Elements Gallery isn’t visible, click the Gallery button on the standard 
toolbar.
 
2. Click a chart type, as shown in Figure 6-15.
 
Figure 6-15:

Tipping the Tables
The Tables feature in PowerPoint 2008 has been updated with table styles. 
Tables now respond to document themes, and you can choose from a variety 
of new table styles.
Making a table the new way
Starting with a slide, you can follow these steps to make a table from 
scratch:
 
1. Click the Table Styles tab of Elements Gallery.
 
 See Figure 6-16.
 
 If Elements Gallery isn’t visible, click the Gallery button on the standard

Reformatting a table
After you create a table, you can experiment with variations on how it looks. 
With the insertion cursor located anywhere in the table, you can click vari-
ous table styles in Elements Gallery to try them on for size. Click Options to 
display a pop-up menu from which you can choose formatting options (as 
described in the preceding section).
The Formatting Palette is also your friend when working with tables. Notice 
that the new Table section appears when a table is selected, and that the 
Borders and Shading section becomes available in addition to font format-
ting. See Figure 6-18. You can also apply a new document theme to a presen-
tation by choosing a theme from the Formatting Palette, resulting in table 
styles getting changed and updated to styles based on the new theme.

Chapter 7: Applying Animation
In This Chapter
✓ Categorizing animations
✓ Adding animations to text
✓ Animating a chart
H
ave you ever been “PowerPointed to death?” Chances are good that 
you have. If you’ve ever sat through a presentation where every slide 
had 20 bullets of text, no subtle animations, and no smooth transitions, you 
can claim to be a victim. Likewise, if you’ve seen a presentation that had 
every mesmerizing transition and swooshing animation possible, making 
you dizzy, you, too, can claim to be a victim.
Both extremes are deadly to presenters. There’s no reason to use presenta-
tion software to simply display text, especially if there are oodles of text 
for each slide. If text is all you have, do your audience a favor and consider 
distributing it as a Word document or PDF file. Your audience will conclude 
that you’re reading to them if your slides are mostly just text. We’ve heard 
some people mention a 7-x-7 rule. Use no more than seven words in a bullet 
point, and use no more than seven bullet points on a slide. And then there’s 
the 10-20-30 rule, which calls for 10 slides to be presented in 20 minutes with 
text that’s at least 30 points in size. Both rules seem reasonable to us — and 
hopefully to you, as well.
PowerPoint’s role is to help you present rich media content that complements 
the points you make while you give your presentation. Animations and transi-
tions help your presentation flow, just like they do in movies and television 
programs. In this chapter, we explore how animation — which isn’t possible on 
the printed page or in PDF — plays an expository role. (See Book IV, Chapter 1 
for more information on transition effects.)
Classifying Custom Animations
Custom animation effects have four main categories:
 
✦ Entrance effects: Use entrance effects to bring objects into the slide 
while the show is running.
 
✦ Emphasis effects: You can apply emphasis effects to objects that are 
already visible on the slide. The object remains on the slide when the 
effect has completed.

570
Animating Text
 
✦ Exit effects: Exit effects make objects disappear from the slide while the 
show is playing.
 
✦ Media actions: These settings affect when and how sound and movies 
play. We discuss media actions in Chapter 8 of this minibook.
A motion path is another type of PowerPoint animation that’s available to 
users of PowerPoint for Windows. Unfortunately, this option still isn’t avail-
able on PowerPoint for Mac. However, if you have a presentation that con-
tains a motion path animation created in PowerPoint for Windows, the Mac 
version of PowerPoint can play that animation.
 
As this book was going to the press, Microsoft released Service Pack 2 for 
Microsoft Office 2008, a free update that added motion path animations to 
PowerPoint 2008. Download Bonus Chapter 2 from this book’s Web site at 
www.dummies.com/go/office2008formacaiofd to learn more!
Animating Text
As you’ve probably seen with other features in Office, Microsoft provides both 
simple and elaborate ways to control features. Custom Animation has both a 
quick method and a detailed method of application. In Project Gallery, you can 
find a presentation template called Widescreen Presentation. This particular 
presentation has no custom animation in it, so in the following sections, we 
use it as an example. To open this presentation so that you can follow along 
with the examples, follow these steps:
 
1. In PowerPoint, choose File➪Project Gallery.
 
 Project Gallery appears.
 
2. In the Category list, select Presentations.
 
3. Double-click Widescreen Presentation.
 
 PowerPoint opens a new presentation in Normal View based on 
Widescreen Presentation.
Telling a story with PowerPoint
While you build a presentation, imagine your-
self as the editor of a film rather than a presen-
tation. Your job in making your presentation is to 
present your content in an order that tells your 
story. You expose the audience to the content 
you want at just the right moment, in just the 
right order.
When you’re building your slide show, keep in 
mind how it will look to someone who has never 
seen it before. Your job as editor can be fun!

Adding an entrance effect quickly
You enable Custom Animation by using the Custom Animation tab in the 
Toolbox. Refer to Figure 7-1 for this example. Follow these steps to put a text 
animation in a text box in slide 3 of Widescreen Presentation:
 
  
1. If the Toolbox isn’t currently visible, click the Toolbox button on the 
Standard toolbar.
 
 2. Select the text box for Widescreen Advantages.
 
3. Click the green Add Entrance Effect button to activate the pop-up list.
 
4. Select an effect from the list.
 
 In our example, we chose the Fade effect.
When you select an effect, PowerPoint plays it for you on the slide. If you 
missed it, or if you want to see the effect play again, click the Preview Effect 
button. That’s all you have to do to quickly add an entrance effect. If you run 
the show, PowerPoint waits until you click the mouse button before expos-
ing the text on the slide.
 
As much as possible, keep animation simple and subtle. Remember, the 
purpose of animation is to enhance rather than distract, and two animations 
that work best with this approach are the fades and the wipes.

Animating Text
Getting a little fancier
You can get a little bit fancier with the next effect. This time, we animate the 
text box that starts with the words Side-by-Side. We want the text to appear 
one bullet point at a time, rather than all at the same time, and we want it to 
appear automatically right after the first animation plays. Refer to Figure 7-2 
for this example and follow these steps:
 
1. Select the text box that starts with the text Side-by-Side.
 
2. Click the Add Entrance Effect button.
 
3. Select an effect.
 
 We chose Fade because it doesn’t draw too much attention to itself.
 
 The Custom Animation palette gets bigger.
 
4. Because we want this effect to play immediately following the previ-
ous effect, change the Start property to After Previous.
 
 After Previous means that the effect is activated as soon as the previous 
effect finishes.
 
5. To make your text to appear one bullet at a time, in the Text Animations 
section of Custom Animation, change the Group Text box to 2nd Level.
 
 Only some effects let you choose group levels. Be sure to experiment 
with combinations of Animate Text and Group Text options.
 
6. After looking at the preview, decide which speed setting looks best to you.
 
 We chose the Medium speed setting in our example.
 
 The number of seconds you should allow appears next to the speed. 
Your animation’s actual time may vary, depending on your computer’s 
hardware and what other applications are running.
 
7. Run the slide to see how it looks so far.
 
 To run your show by starting with the current slide, click the Slide Show 
button at the lower-left corner of the window. It’s the third button from 
the left, which looks like a small screen, as shown in the margin.
Start options
You can choose from three start options (we like to call them animation events):
 
✦ On Click: This option works just like it sounds. PowerPoint waits for you 
to click the mouse button before running the animation when the slide 
show is running. On Click is the default setting when you add a new ani-
mation to a slide.
 
✦ With Previous: When With Previous is selected, the animation plays 
simultaneously with the previous animation in the list in the Animation 

Book IV
Chapter 7
Applying 
Animation

Animating Text
Order palette. You can chain many animations together so that they 
play all at the same time. If you want all the animations to play without 
having to click the mouse, the first animation in the list should be With 
Previous or After Previous.
 
✦ After Previous: After Previous tells PowerPoint to wait until the previous 
animation has completed before automatically starting this animation.
Making a moth fly
In this section we’re going to add three animation effects to the image of a 
moth, and then set each one to play after the previous animation so that 
they play in sequence. See Figure 7-3 for this example, and get ready to dig 
through the big list of animations by following these steps:
 
1. Select the image.
 
 We select our moth image.
 
2. Click the green Add Entrance Effect button in the Custom Animation 
toolbox.
 
 Select More Effects from the pop-up menu every time you add a new 
effect so that you can choose from the big list of all the effects that are 
in the Animation Effects palette.
 
3. In the Exciting category, select the Boomerang effect and then click 
the OK button.
 
 The buttons at the bottom of the palette are now Cancel and OK.
 
4. Change the Start setting to After Previous.
 
5. Click the yellow Add Emphasis Effect button.
 
6. In the Moderate category, select Teeter, and then click the OK button.
 
7. Change the Start setting to After Previous.
 
8. Click the red Add Exit Effect button.
 
9. In the Exciting category, select Swivel.
 
10. Change the Start setting to After Previous.
 
11. Click the Animation Preview button to preview the slide and watch 
while the moth flies in and then flies away from you!
 
 Entrance effects have a green star, emphasis effects have a yellow star, 
and exit effects have a red star. If you look closely, you can see that the 
stars are different. You can delay an effect by using the Timing section of 
the Animation Effects palette.

Animating a Chart
Changing your mind
You can easily change an effect. To see which effect you’ve already applied 
or to change an effect that’s already been applied, double-click the item in 
the Animation Order palette. PowerPoint shows you which animation has 
been applied. You can change it right there (see Figure 7-3).
You can easily change the order in which objects enter and play by selecting 
them in the Animation Order palette and then clicking the Change Order but-
tons, as shown in Figure 7-2. Animations play in order, starting at the top of 
the palette.
Animating a Chart
Animating charts adds interest and helps tell the story of your data. The 
Widescreen Presentation we work with throughout this chapter has a chart. 
See Figure 7-4. You won’t believe how easily you can animate a chart in 
PowerPoint for Mac. The chart at hand is a bar chart, and we think the Rise 
Up animation would be a good one for this type of chart. Follow these steps to 
add animation:
 
1. Go to slide 4 and select the chart by clicking its border.
 
2. Click the Add Entrance Effect button in the Custom Animation palette 
of Toolbox.
 
3. Select the Rise Up animation.
 
 A new Chart Animations section appears in the Custom Animation tool-
box (see Figure 7-4).
 
4. In the Group Graphic pop-up menu, select By Category.
 
5. Click the Preview Effect button (see Figure 7-1) and watch the magic 
happen!
 
 By all means, experiment with other grouping options and animation 
effects. Some effects have directional options. In Figure 7-4, we captured 
the last category while it was rising into place.
 
PowerPoint for Windows includes an animation feature called Triggers, which 
allows you to click on objects while a presentation is running to make a specific 
animation occur on the slide. PowerPoint for Mac doesn’t have this feature. The 
Mac version ignores triggers if they’re in a presentation created in Windows, so 
triggers don’t fire in PowerPoint for Mac.

Chapter 8: Presenting Sounds 
and Movies
In This Chapter
✓ Rehearsing your presentation
✓ Adding music and sound
✓ Making a smooth transition
✓ Incorporating video
✓ Using custom animation
✓ Dealing with eccentricities
R
ich media, also known broadly as multimedia, enhances your presenta-
tions. You can add music, sounds, movies, and YouTube videos to your 
PowerPoint presentations. You can also add your own voice narrations to 
individual slides. PowerPoint may be 25 years old, but it’s been keeping up 
with the times and knows about Web 2.0. This chapter helps you incorpo-
rate the rich media that can make your presentations interesting.
For the most part, working with audio in PowerPoint is straightforward. We 
cover the basics first. At the end of this chapter, we talk about some of the 
“gotchas” in details about using sounds and music.
Speaking to Your Audience
You may want to create a narrated version of your presentation that you can 
distribute. You can’t be everywhere, and even though your audience won’t 
get the benefit of your physical presence, they’ll at least be able to hear 
you while they enjoy your slide show. We cover a method of adding sounds 
during our Slide Sorter View discussion in Book IV, Chapter 1, but we don’t 
talk about narrating slides in that chapter.
PowerPoint has two features that are almost the same. Both of them 
play the slide show while you rehearse it. While you rehearse, both fea-
tures record how much time you spend on each slide. When you’re done, 
PowerPoint offers to let you use those timings for the slide show. The differ-
ence between the two features is as follows:
 
✦ Rehearse Timings captures only the timings.
 
✦ Record Narration captures the timings plus your audio narration.

578
Speaking to Your Audience
Rehearsing timings
Use Rehearse Timings whenever you want your presentation to advance 
slides automatically one after the other, after a preset period of time. You 
turn on this feature by choosing Slide Show➪Rehearse Timings. The slide 
show runs from the first slide, and PowerPoint keeps track of how much 
time you take while you rehearse. At the end of the show, or when you press 
the Escape key, you decide whether to keep the timings. If you opt to save 
these timings, they’re saved as automatic transition timings.
 
Many users work with the Rehearse Timings option to practice their 
PowerPoint slides out loud. They can get an idea about how long it’ll take to 
do an actual presentation using these slides. Thereafter, they opt not to save 
the timings.
Even if you opt to save the timings, you can always fine-tune them later in 
Slide Sorter View, where you can also remove those timings altogether. (See 
Book IV, Chapter 1.)
If you need to adhere to strict time limits, timings keep you on track. Timings 
are also used for self-running presentations in kiosk mode.
Recording narrations
Use the Record Narration feature when you want to make a version of your 
presentation that has narration included for distribution. Of course, to use 
this feature, your computer requires a microphone and speakers, or a good-
quality audio headset. Record Narration works the same way as Rehearse 
Timings, but PowerPoint records what you say while you rehearse. At the 
end of each slide, PowerPoint creates a sound file and adds it to the slide. 
You can always go back, delete the sound icon from the slide, and rerecord 
the slide’s narration if you’re not happy with the audio.
To start the slide show and begin recording, choose Slide Show➪Record 
Narration. PowerPoint asks your Mac what audio hardware it has, and then 
asks you which hardware you want to use to record. In the following sec-
tions, we discuss the settings shown in Figure 8-1.
Recording options
PowerPoint tells you approximately how much time you can use to record 
your narration based on the settings you choose. If you have more than one 
sound input device, click the Sound Input Device pop-up menu and select 
the option you want to use from the available sound input devices.

and Movies

Speaking to Your Audience

Link narrations
If you select the Link Narrations check box, PowerPoint prompts you to 
choose a place to store the narrations in your file system. Linking keeps the 
size of your presentation file small. If you choose to link, you should make a 
note of this fact in the slide notes of your title slide. To make versions for dis-
tribution, use the PowerPoint Package feature so that narrations accompany 
the distributed presentation. Choose File➪Save As, click Format in the Save As 
dialog that appears, and select PowerPoint Package from the pop-up menu.
 
If you need to share narrated presentations with folks who run PowerPoint 
for Windows, don’t link narrations because PowerPoint for Mac seems 
to save narrations files without a file extension, and that’s something 
PowerPoint for Windows can’t understand!
If you want professional-sounding narrations, get a high-quality headset and 
record in a silent room. Consider using sound-editing and -recording soft-
ware so that you can easily delete unwanted parts of your sound track. Using 
sound-editing software eliminates the worry about making mistakes, and you 
can kill extraneous noises. Audacity is a free sound-editing and -recording 
program that you can download from this open-source Web site:
http://audacity.sourceforge.net
 
You can much more easily work from a script than try to “wing it.” Even with 
a script, expect to spend 40 minutes or more working on the audio for each 
15 minutes’ worth of audio that’ll finally make it into your presentation. If 
you’re not happy with the sound of your own voice, you may have to pay a 
professional to record the narrations.

580
Adding Music and Sounds
Adding Music and Sounds
Soothing or not so soothing. It depends! Regardless of the kind of music or 
sound you plan to add to your presentation, you might want to make some 
noise in three distinct points in a presentation. Each point has some special 
considerations:
 
✦ While a slide is playing
 
✦ During a slide transition
 
✦ As background throughout a presentation
Our hunch is that most of your audio and video content is in iTunes, so we’re 
going to feature iTunes as a content source. We think that you’ll be pleased with 
the high level of integration among PowerPoint, Mac OS X, and Apple applica-
tions. Of course, you can use music, sounds, and movies from almost any sound 
file anywhere in Finder. We love GarageBand, and we encourage you to use it to 
create your own music and audio content for PowerPoint, but we’re not going 
to describe GarageBand in this book. For that, we refer you to GarageBand For 
Dummies, by Bob LeVitus (Wiley). Likewise, iMovie, iDVD, and Final Cut are 
superb for creating video content to use in PowerPoint presentations.
Making audio and video play while a slide plays
You can easily add music, sounds, and video to a slide. Before you add the 
content, think about when it should start to play. PowerPoint offers several 
different ways to get your rich content started on a slide:
 
✦ The easiest way is to have your audio or video content start playing 
automatically when the slide starts. When you select this option, the 
music or video plays until it finishes or until you move to the next slide, 
whichever comes first.
 
✦ The next easiest way is to have your content play when you click some-
thing that’s on your slide, such as a sound icon or a video placeholder, 
while the slide show is running.
 
✦ A fancier way to use audio or video is as if it’s one of the bullet points on 
your slide. You can actually add sounds and video to the schedule in the 
Custom Animation dialog of the Toolbox so that animation effects deter-
mine when the rich content plays.
 
✦ The final way is to have your audio play when you move the cursor over 
something on your slide while the slide show is running.

Adding Music and Sounds
Adding audio that plays when the slide starts
We recommend that you place your saved presentation in a new folder. 
Then, copy the media files you want to insert within the presentation in this 
new folder and launch the presentation file.
You can easily add sounds and music to a slide. Choose either of two ways 
to activate the Insert Sound dialog:
 
 
✦ The Media button: Click the Media button on the Standard toolbar and 
select Insert Sound and Music from the pop-up menu.
 
 
 When you select this option, the Insert Sound dialog appears. Navigate 
to a sound file or use Spotlight to search for a file name. Select Music 
from the Mac OS X Places list in Finder to navigate to your iTunes 
library.
 
✦ Insert: Choose Insert➪Sound and Music, and then select one of the 
three Insert options:
 
• From File: When you select this option, the Insert Sound dialog 
appears. Navigate to a sound file or use Spotlight to search for a file. 
Choose Music from the OS X Places list in Finder to navigate to your 
iTunes library.
 
• Play CD Audio Track: We talk about how to use this option in the 
section “Adding a CD audio track,” later in this chapter.
 
• Record Sound: We cover this option in “Recording a sound directly 
onto a slide,” later in this chapter.
Whether you click the Media button or choose Insert➪Sound and Music➪
From File, the Insert Sound dialog opens. Insert Sound not only lets you navi-
gate to any file in Finder, but it also lets you select from your iTunes music 
library and playlists. In Figure 8-2, we select a song from an iTunes playlist 
we made for PowerPoint.
When you use the Insert Sound dialog, you get to choose from all the media 
content anywhere on your computer. You can use sounds, music, and audio 
podcasts directly from your iTunes collection. The Search feature of Insert 
Sound is integrated with Mac OS X Spotlight and is amazingly fast. You can 
enter any part of a title or artist, and Search finds it instantly.
After you select the audio content in the Insert Sound dialog, click the 
Insert button to bring your audio content onto your slide. PowerPoint then 
prompts you to start the audio content when the slide starts, as shown in 
Figure 8-3. If you click the Automatically button, your audio content begins 
to play when the slide starts during a running slide show. A sound icon is 
placed on your slide.

Adding Music and Sounds
Automatically button, you’ll click the When Clicked button (see Figure 8-3). 
When you click the Insert button, the sound icon appears on your slide.
You’re not limited to playing sounds by using the standard icon. You can 
have a sound play when you click any type of object, such as a picture, clip 
art, SmartArt, or WordArt (see Figure 8-4). To make an object clickable for 
sound, follow these steps:
 
1. Right-click or Control-click the object.
 
2. Select Action Settings from the pop-up menu that appears to open the 
Action Settings dialog shown in Figure 8-4.
 
3. In the Play Sound section of the Action Settings dialog, click the 
pop-up button.
 
4. Select one of the sounds from the list, or scroll all the way down to the 
bottom and select Other Sound.
 
 If you select Other Sound, you’re presented with a Choose a Sound dialog 
that lets you navigate Finder to select a sound file. Choose a Sound is 
almost the same as Insert Sound, so you can use Figure 8-2 as a guide.
 
Figure 8-4:

Adding audio that plays when moused over
The Action Settings dialog in Figure 8-4 includes two tabs: Mouse Click and 
Mouse Over. The default setting is Mouse Click. If you want to change it so 
that the audio plays on your slide when you move the mouse over a picture or 
other object (so that you don’t even have to click the picture), click the Mouse 
Over tab before selecting which sound to play. Otherwise, the steps to add an 
action setting are the same as those described in the preceding section.

584
Adding Music and Sounds
Adding a CD audio track
PowerPoint can play audio from an ordinary CD while your presentation 
runs. To use this feature, slide a regular music CD into your Mac and let 
the CD’s icon appear on the desktop. Then, choose Insert➪Sound and 
Music➪Play CD Audio Track. A simple dialog appears (as shown in Figure 
8-5), which lets you select which track or tracks you want to add to the 
presentation. Although this feature is neat, remember to bring the audio CD 
with you whenever you give the presentation. If the CD isn’t in your Mac 
before you start the presentation, the audio won’t play.

Recording a sound directly onto a slide
If you choose Insert➪Sound and Music➪Record Sound, the Record Sound 
dialog, as shown in Figure 8-6, opens. This is a bare-bones tool, and it might 
do in a pinch. We suggest you download, install, and understand how to use 
Audacity, instead. If you use Record Sound, the sound is embedded into the 
current slide; it’s not exported as is implied when saving your sound.

Filling the Transition Gap
Filling the Transition Gap
On rare occasions, you might want to have a sound play during the transi-
tion period when one slide ends and the next one starts. Transition sounds 
add punctuation, bridge the gap from one slide to another (perhaps with 
humor), and can help with the continuity of a show.
The built-in PowerPoint transition sounds are definitely of the punctuation 
kind. If you’re going to use a slide transition sound, we suggest that you 
use one of your own making. GarageBand is the perfect tool to use to make 
music and sounds for this purpose. Our screen shot in Figure 8-7 illustrates 
the import of a GarageBand loop that we made, after we converted it to AIFF 
format by using Audacity. Follow these steps to add your own sound to a 
slide transition:
 
1. On the Transitions tab of Elements Gallery, click Options.
 
 We suggest that you use Slide Sorter View, but you don’t have to.
 
2. In the Transitions Options dialog, click the Sound pop-up menu.
 
 A pop-up menu appears.
 
3. Scroll down to the bottom of the long list and select Other Sound.
 
 The Choose a Sound dialog appears.
 
4. In the Choose a Sound dialog, navigate or use Spotlight to locate and 
select the audio file you want to use for the transition sound, and then 
click the Insert button.
 
5. Click the Apply button in the Transition Options dialog.
 
 When your presentation runs, the chosen sound plays during the transi-
tion from one slide to the next.

Adding Narration and Video to a Slide
Adding Narration and Video to a Slide
So, you bought this fancy Macintosh, and it has all this built-in video capabil-
ity. Can you use it to make video narrations for your PowerPoint slides? Well, 
of course you can! We trust that you won’t use this capability to just capture 
your face while you speak to your audience. Instead, be creative.
Creating a video narration
Most Macs come with built-in video capture and an iSight camera. You need 
some type of video camera to create a video narration. Follow these steps to 
make a video narration that you can use in PowerPoint:
 
1. Open Photo Booth.
 
 Photo Booth is an application that you can find in your Mac OS X 
Finder’s Applications folder.
 
2. (Optional) Select an effect before recording your video by clicking the 
Effects button on Photo Booth’s toolbar (See Figure 8-8) and selecting 
one of special effects.
 
3. Click the Take a Movie Clip button.
 
4. Click the Start Recording button.
 
 The Take a Movie Clip button turns into a time-elapsed indicator while 
you’re recording.
 
5. Click the Stop Recording button to end the recording.
 
 Your video appears at the bottom of Photo Booth.

That’s all there is to it! PowerPoint knows where to find your Photo Booth 
narrations, as you can find out in the following section.
Adding video to a slide
You can easily add video to a slide, and you have more than one way to go 
about it. You can choose any one of the following three ways to activate the 
Insert Movie dialog:

Follow these steps to insert a movie:
 
1. Select a video in the Insert Movie dialog.
 
2. Click the Choose button to bring your video content onto your slide.
 
 PowerPoint then prompts you whether you want to start the video when 
the slide starts (see Figure 8-12).
 
3. Select an option for How Do You Want the Movie to Start in the Slide 
Show?:
 
• Automatically: If you select the Automatically option, your video 
begins to play automatically when the slide runs.
 
• When Clicked: If you select this option, you click the placeholder on 
your slide while the presentation is running to play the content.
 
 A frame of your movie is placed on your slide as a placeholder.

Using Custom Animation to Control Movies and Audio
Using Custom Animation to Control Movies and Audio
 
In the section “Making audio and video play while a slide plays,” earlier in 
this chapter, we mention that you can treat audio and video just like text bul-
lets and other objects in the Custom Animation dialog of the Toolbox. (Refer 
to Book IV, Chapter 7 for Custom Animation details.) You can use entrance, 
emphasis, and exit effects on sound icons and video placeholders, but the 
key thing to remember when doing this is that you have to use the Play 
effect at some point to make the audio or movie start playing (see Figure 
8-13). You can also use Pause and Stop effects, but the most important one 
to remember is Play, which gets things rolling.
 
Figure 8-13: 
Getting 
audio and 
video to 
play in an 
animation 
sequence.
 
A very practical use of applying animation effects to a sound is to play back-
ground music while your slide show plays. The following steps add music so 
that it plays while your show is running, and we set the number of slides to 
the max so that the music continues to play, even if you move from slide to 
slide while your presentation is running. Follow these steps:
 
 1. Click the Media button on the Standard toolbar.
 
 2. Choose Insert Sound and Music from the pop-up menu that appears.
 
 The Insert Sound dialog appears.
 
3. Navigate or use Spotlight to locate your media; then select the music 
you want to play (see Figure 8-4) and click the Insert button to add the 
sound to your slide.
 
 The dialog shown in Figure 8-5 appears.
 
4. When prompted, choose to play the sound automatically.
 
 A sound icon appears on your slide.
 
5. Select the Sound icon, and then Control-click or right-click this icon. 
Choose Custom Animation from the pop-up menu to display the 
Custom Animation dialog of the Toolbox (see Figure 8-14).

Dealing with Audio and Video Odds and Ends
When you use rich media, give some thought to file sizes if you’re planning 
to distribute your presentation. Audio and video files range from small to 
large. The larger the audio files, the larger the whole package becomes. For 
the record, it’s difficult to send anything larger than 5 megabytes (5MB) via 
e-mail. Distribution by other media, such as CD, DVD, and online storage, 
is now very inexpensive, so most of the time, you don’t have to be too con-
cerned with file size. Plus, with new Web-sharing options such as Mesh.com 
and Office Live, you no longer have to keep file sizes small.
Hiding sound icons
 
You can position sound icons off the visible portion of the slide layout if you 
choose to play the sound automatically or if you use animation effects to 
trigger the sound. Sound icons don’t have to be visible onscreen unless you 
choose to play the sound when clicked. In Figure 8-16, we moved the sound 
icons off the slide’s visible area.

Linking and embedding
PowerPoint lets you create links to rich media so that you can keep 
PowerPoint presentation sizes under control. The alternative method 
is to embed, which means that PowerPoint makes a copy of the media 
and includes it as an integral part of the presentation. Table 8-1 shows 
PowerPoint’s default behaviors.

If your content is linked, choose Save As➪PowerPoint Package to create ver-
sions of your presentation for distribution or archive. Within a PowerPoint 
package folder, don’t rename or move the audio source files, or change any 
part of the directory path to those files — otherwise, the links will break.
Discerning a sound difference
In this section, we describe two very similar dialogs. One is called Insert 
Sound, and the other is called Choose a Sound. You may not even have 
noticed this difference in the discussion. As you may know, your content may 
be managed by something known as Digital Rights Management, or DRM. The 
difference between these two dialogs helps you deal with DRM problems.

592
Dealing with Audio and Video Odds and Ends
Insert Sound
Insert Sound is the dialog shown in Figure 8-2. You can see the Insert 
Sound dialog when you insert sound by clicking the Media button on the 
Standard toolbar or by choosing Insert➪Sound and Music➪From File. Insert 
Sound allows you to use all your audio content, even if it has Digital Rights 
Management (DRM) control to manage how you use your content.
You have no indication about whether the content you’re selecting has DRM 
associated with it. If you use DRM-controlled content, it plays only on your 
computer. For DRM-protected content to play when you present your slide 
show, it must be in the same location as it was when you inserted it into 
PowerPoint. You can restrict your selection to non-DRM content by using 
action settings.
When you choose File➪Save As and change the format to PowerPoint 
Package in the Format pop-up menu, DRM-managed content is not added to 
the package and doesn’t play in the package’s slide show when distributed 
to other computers.
Choose a Sound
The Choose a Sound dialog looks and works just like the Insert Sound dialog, 
except that it lets you choose only from content that’s not controlled by 
DRM. You can see DRM-managed content in the browser, but it’s grayed out. 
The Choose a Sound dialog appears when you insert a sound following our 
instructions in the section “Adding Music and Sounds,” earlier in this chap-
ter, and when adding sounds to slide transitions, as discussed in “Filling the 
Transition Gap,” earlier in this chapter.
When you choose File➪Save As and select PowerPoint Package in the 
Format pop-up menu, audio content is added to the package and plays in 
the package’s slide show when distributed to other computers. Use Choose 
a Sound when you’re creating presentations that you plan to distribute as 
PowerPoint packages.
Making sounds compatible
When it comes to sound files, PowerPoint doesn’t support every common 
sound type. Luckily, you can easily convert sounds to formats that PowerPoint 
does understand. Sometimes, DRM can cause problems, even with your own 
content. You can’t convert every protected or oddball-format file by using 
these methods, but these methods might help with many of them.
If you already have Apple’s QuickTime Pro, you can use it to do the convert-
ing. In this example, we convert one of our own GarageBand loops that we 
dragged to the desktop from iTunes. We convert iTunes AIF format to AIFF 
by choosing File➪Export in QuickTime (see Figure 8-17). Making the conver-
sion allows the loop to work in a PowerPoint package.

Book IV

and Movies
593
Dealing with Audio and Video Odds and Ends
If you don’t already have the Pro version of QuickTime, use freeware, such as 
Audacity (discussed in the section “Link narrations,” earlier in this chapter). 
Either way, you create a file that PowerPoint can use. Figure 8-18 shows the 
settings that you can use by choosing File➪Export in Audacity.
 
Figure 8-17:

Making video compatible
PowerPoint on Mac doesn’t actually play video. It uses Apple’s QuickTime 
as the helper application. Whatever plays in QuickTime plays in PowerPoint 
on the Mac. As it turns out, QuickTime is a lot more versatile than the player 
used by PowerPoint for Windows. PowerPoint for Windows chokes when 
it encounters QuickTime movies, even if the current QuickTime version is 
installed on the PC. PowerPoint for Windows just doesn’t do QuickTime.
Using WMV
If you plan to use video content and distribute it to Windows users, you 
must convert it to WMV (Windows Media Video) or AVI before you insert 
it into PowerPoint. We think WMV is the best cross-platform format to use. 
Standing on our soapbox
DRM expands ownership rights to content cre-
ators over and above that granted by copyright. 
We’ve never come across a DRM scheme that 
properly returns content to the public domain 
after the copyright time period has expired, 
nor have we come across a DRM scheme that 
properly manages Fair Use rights. If DRM is 
what’s keeping you from getting your content, 
we don’t have a solution. One way to try to get 
your rights back is to join the Electronic Frontier 
Foundation. The foundation offers a Users 
Guide to DRM in Online Music. Find out more at 
www.eff.org.

594
Dealing with Audio and Video Odds and Ends
It provides high-quality video, and WMV file sizes are very reasonable. 
Fortunately for Mac users, QuickTime can understand WMV when you install a 
free program called Flip4Mac. Flip4Mac has other interesting capabilities that 
you might want if you plan to make a lot of cross-platform video content, but 
at the very least, we suggest that you install the free player from this Web site: 
www.telestream.net/flip4mac-wmv/overview.htm
 
Figure 8-18: 
Converting 
audio format 
by using 
Audacity.
 
You can use several products to convert QuickTime files to WMV. Flip4Mac’s 
Studio products can perform the conversion. If you don’t mind spending a little 
extra time, you can have the conversion done free by one of the many Web sites 
that offer this service. MediaConverter is one such Web site; it also has a free 
Firefox add-on that readily converts YouTube videos to QuickTime (.mov) or 
WMV format, and then saves them on your computer. Visit the following site:
www.mediaconverter.org
Video DRM
When you choose File➪Save As, and then select PowerPoint Package from 
the Format pop-up menu, DRM-managed video content isn’t added to the 
package and doesn’t play in the package’s slide show when distributed to 
other computers.

Chapter 9: Printing and Sharing 
Presentations
In This Chapter
✓ Printing handouts and more
✓ Sharing presentations with others
✓ Presenting to real, live people
S
haring presentations with others is an integral part of PowerPoint. 
Audiences often expect printed handouts and online versions of your 
presentations as reference materials. This chapter can help you prepare to 
meet those expectations by showing you a wide variety of printing options 
and introducing you to new ways to share presentations with others.
Printing Your Presentations
You can print many different sizes with PowerPoint. Although it’s most 
common to print handouts on regular-size paper, you can use PowerPoint 
to print large-scale versions of slides to use for poster sessions at booths 
in conferences or for wall mounting. You can also use PowerPoint to print 
small-scale objects, such as postcards. Your printing output can take a vari-
ety of forms, such as PDF, slides, handouts, or even Notes Pages.
Printing to PDF files
We want to encourage you to be earth-friendly. Maybe you don’t have to 
print to paper; instead, you can print to PDF files. Put the PDF file into an 
Internet sharing service for those who want to download it, and view or 
print it themselves. All the printing options that we show you offer the PDF 
file printing option. Just click the PDF button in the lower-left of the Print 
dialog of PowerPoint (and every other application, for that matter) and 
choose Save as PDF from the pop-up menu, as shown in Figure 9-1.

Printing Your Presentations
Printing handouts for everyone
If you need to print handouts to give to your attendees, PowerPoint offers 
many printing options. You can access all these nice options by choosing 
File➪Print rather than clicking the Print button on the Standard toolbar. If 
you click the Print button on the Standard toolbar, PowerPoint prints full-
page printouts of the slides, and that might not be what you want.
Printing handouts with note-taking lines
This very popular arrangement prints pictures of three slides on the left, 
along with lines on the right, on each page so that people can take notes. 
This handout option is the only one that prints note-taking lines. You can 
find this option in the Print What field of the Print pane. Click on the field 
and choose Handouts (3 Slides per Page) from the pop-up menu, as shown in 
Figure 9-2. The other handout options print pictures of the slides in various 
arrangements that you can see in the preview when you select them.
 
Figure 9-2:

Printing handouts with slide notes
Another popular style of printing is to print the Notes View. These printouts 
include one picture of the slide, plus the slide notes for that slide, as shown in 
Figure 9-3. You follow the same procedure that we describe in the preceding 
section, except that in the Print What selection of the Print pane, select Notes.

Printing the slide outline
The option at the bottom of the Print What selection in the Print pane is 
Outline. This option prints the text that appears in the Outline pane of the 
Normal View.
Setting headers and footers
When it’s time to print those handouts, you might want to have page num-
bers and other information for your audience. Choosing View➪Header and 
Footer opens the Header and Footer pane shown in Figure 9-4.
 
You might expect them to, but slides don’t have headers. Slides just have 
footers. Notes and handouts have both headers and footers. That’s just a 
little trivia.

Exploring Sharing Options
The Header and Foot pane has the following tabs:
 
✦ Slide: When you select this tab, the setting choices you make apply to 
the slides in your presentation.
 
✦ Notes and Handouts: Setting choices made on this tab apply to printed 
handouts, printed notes, and Notes Page View.
When facing the task of printing large and small, choose File➪Page Setup. In 
Book II, Chapter 8, we explain how to use Page Setup to create custom paper 
sizes in Microsoft Word. You use the same procedure in PowerPoint.
 
If you know you’re going to print to a paper size other than PowerPoint’s 
default, choose File➪Page Setup before you create any slides, Slide Masters, 
or slide layouts in your presentation. If you wait until after you build your 
presentation, when you change the paper size, it can cause graphic objects 
and even text to look squished, stretched, or otherwise distorted.
Exploring Sharing Options
You can share PowerPoint presentations in so many different ways that we 
hardly know where to begin. Each one is best for specific circumstances. 
Know your audience and choose an appropriate distribution method.
Distributing in PowerPoint format
Microsoft Office is extremely popular with Mac users. It’s one of the most 
widely installed software suites among Mac and Windows users. That means 
your audience probably already has PowerPoint installed. Distributing in 
PowerPoint format is the highest-quality option to play your slide show on 
another computer.
 
Use the Save as PowerPoint Package feature to create a Package folder, 
which you then distribute intact so that your media files can play.
Other software that can open and play PowerPoint presentations includes 
Apple’s Keynote, Sun Microsystems’s OpenOffice, Planamesa Inc.’s 
NeoOffice, and Google Docs. Applications other than PowerPoint may sub-
stitute fonts and change or fail to play transitions or animations. Graphic 
objects may be altered. Effects such as soft shadows and 3D effects may look 
different. Charts may not look the same.
Distributing as a movie
As we mention in Book IV, Chapters 1 and 2, you can easily save a slide 
show as a QuickTime movie by choosing File➪Save as Movie, or you can use 
SnapZPro to record a perfect playback. Remember to set timings by using

the Options button on the Slide Transitions tab of Elements Gallery so that 
your slides advance during the movie (see Figure 9-5). Here are some fun 
things you can do with these movies:
 
✦ Upload your movie to YouTube or another video-sharing site. The 
movies created by PowerPoint are in QuickTime format, so you can 
upload them as-is. Just head to the upload section of your favorite shar-
ing site and follow the directions.
 
✦ Import your PowerPoint movie into iMovie. In iMovie09, choose 
File➪Import➪Movies, as shown in Figure 9-6.
 
✦ Turn your PowerPoint movie presentation into a DVD. One feature of 
iDVD lets you turn your PowerPoint movie directly into a DVD. Open 
iDVD and choose File➪OneStep DVD from Movie, as shown in Figure 9-7. 
Pop a blank DVD into your Mac and burn!

Sending directly to iPhoto
This option is especially fun. PowerPoint talks directly with iPhoto. Even if you 
don’t have a particular reason to do this option, try it just for fun. Following 
these steps turns your presentation into a new photo album in iPhoto:
 
1. With your presentation open in PowerPoint, choose File➪Send 
To➪iPhoto (see Figure 9-8).
 
 The Send to iPhoto dialog opens.
 
2. Name your new album, decide which picture format you want to use, 
and then click the Send to iPhoto button (see Figure 9-9).
 
 PowerPoint prepares your slides and gives them to iPhoto, which cre-
ates a new album and presents the slides to you (see Figure 9-10).

Sending by e-mail or MSN Messenger
Take a peek at the Mail Recipient (as Attachment) option in the Send To list 
in Figure 9-8. Using this option is okay only if your presentation has no linked 
media. But if your presentation has sounds or movies, choose File➪Save 
As, click Format in the Save As dialog that appears, and select PowerPoint 
Package from the pop-up menu so that you don’t lose the media content.
Before you attach a PowerPoint package to an e-mail message, compress the 
package folder, as shown in Figure 9-11. Be sure to compress first if you want 
to send your presentation by using any of the popular chat services, such 
as MSN Messenger, Yahoo!, or AIM. To compress the Package folder, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Right-click or Control-click the Package folder in Finder.
 
2. Choose Compress or Archive (depending on the version of Mac OS X 
you’re using) from the pop-up menu.
 
 The compressed file has a ZIP extension, and you can easily unarchive 
(or unzip) these files on both Mac and Windows computers, usually by 
simply double-clicking the files in Finder on the Mac, or in Windows 
Explorer or My Computer in Windows.
Sharing with iChat
You can do amazing things with PowerPoint and iChat, such as share a 
presentation with your sister, business associate, or friend. Of course, the 
person you want to share with needs to be online at the same time as you are. 
We realize that you have several ways to use iChat to share a presentation, 

602
Exploring Sharing Options
but our testing indicates that sharing your screen is a clear winner in terms 
of quality. We cover screen sharing in detail in the following section and give 
a brief explanation of using iChat Theater in “Sharing with iChat Theater,” 
later in this chapter.
 
Figure 9-11: 
Compressing 
before 
sending.
 
Sharing your screen
Assume that you already have a text chat going with someone. Either party 
can initiate the process, but our example assumes that you’re going to start 
the sharing process. Sharing your presentation involves allowing the other 
party to see your computer’s desktop and even have access to your mouse, 
so if you’re not willing to let this happen, use the iChat Theater method (dis-
cussed in the following section), instead. To present, follow these steps:
 
1. Open iChat and make sure that you’re signed on.
 
2. In iChat, click your buddy in the Buddy list, and then choose Buddies➪
Share My Screen with [name of buddy], as shown in Figure 9-12.
 
 Your buddy receives an invitation, and he or she must accept it before 
the next step can happen.

 3. Start your PowerPoint presentation by using any method except 
Presenter Tools (unless you want to share the presenter’s side of the 
presentation, rather than the slide show in its own window).
 
 You can narrate your presentation while you present because the other 
person can hear what you say, and you can hear the other person, 
assuming that you both have microphones and speakers turned on.
 
4. To stop screen sharing, press Control-Escape.
Sharing with iChat Theater
When we tried using iChat Theater, we found that the presentation looked 
good but that it didn’t fit the iChat Theater window, so we hesitate to sug-
gest this option. And this size problem seems to be common enough with 
many users.
Before you use iChat Theater, you must save your presentation as a file on 
your computer. Then, in iChat, choose File➪Share a File with iChat Theater. 
We couldn’t find a way to tell iChat Theater to fit the presentation in the 
window, but you can use this method if you don’t want to share your desk-
top. iChat also lets you share with two other people at the same time, so if 
you don’t experience the window-size glitch, this option is the way to go.
Sharing by using Google Docs
While we’re writing this book, Google Docs is beta software, so if you’re shy 
about using beta software, Google Docs might not be for you. However, if 
you’re like us, it’s full steam ahead! Google Docs and other online Web-hosting 
services let you upload your PowerPoint presentations to share with others.
To use this option, you must have a Google (or Gmail) account. In general, 
you can go to a Web site that supports PowerPoint and follow the directions 
for uploading your presentation, which you do right from within your Web 
browser. Most of these services allow you to restrict viewers to ones you 
prescribe or to share with the entire world. To upload your PowerPoint pre-
sentation file to Google Docs, follow these steps:
 
1. Save your presentation in the PowerPoint 97 through 2004 (.ppt).
 
 It needs to be in this format before you can upload it to Google Docs.
 
 By the time you read this, PowerPoint (.pptx) format likely will be sup-
ported, in which case, you can skip Step 1.
 
2. Upload to Google by going to this Web address: 
 
 http://docs.google.com
 
 After you sign in, Google’s file space and toolbar open, as shown in 
Figure 9-13, unless this setup has changed since we took this screen shot.

3. Click the Upload button and navigate to your presentation file in 
Finder, as shown in Figure 9-14. Click the Upload File button to begin 
the upload process, which may take some time.
 
 After the presentation finishes uploading, the slide-editing screen 
appears. You can edit your presentation online (see Figure 9-15). This 
screen is analogous to PowerPoint’s Normal View.

4. To run your presentation, click the Start Presentation button.
 
 Now, your presentation is running in a browser window.
 
 We were able to resize the window and easily go through the presenta-
tion. The quality of the product was very good. In Figure 9-16, you can 
see the available options on the Actions menu.
Exploring slide-sharing sites
Sometimes, you want others to see your presentation slides, and you may 
or may not want them to download the actual PowerPoint file. Whatever you 
prefer, a new breed of slide-sharing sites puts all these options and more at 
your disposal. We call this a way to get your slides in the clouds!

Here’s a listing of such slide-sharing sites with their URLs:
 
✦ SlideShare: www.slideshare.net
 
✦ authorSTREAM: www.authorstream.com
 
✦ SlideBoom: www.slideboom.com
Presenting Live
This sharing option brings you full circle to the beginning of Book IV. We 
have more tips to share with you regarding giving an in-person live presen-
tation. We hope by now that you have the confidence to build a slide show 
that people will enjoy watching and that you know will do your content 
justice. If you still have some butterflies, remember that your audience is 
almost always friendly. Only a few people are unlucky enough to have shoes 
thrown at them.
Using the letter B (or W)
While a slide show is running, the audience is usually paying some atten-
tion to the screen. Some may be texting on a cell phone or e-mailing, but 
that’s the way it goes these days. When you press the letter B, the screen 
goes black. That means the audience will usually focus its attention on you, 
which you may want every once in a while. Press just about any other key to 
resume the presentation.
Similarly, press W to get a white screen. And before you try, R doesn’t do 
red, and G doesn’t make it green!
Using Pen tools
If you start a slide show by using a method other than Presenter view, you 
can draw on a slide by using the Pen tool while the slide show is running. 
Follow these steps:
 
1. While your presentation is running, right-click or Control-click a slide.
 
 A pop-up menu appears (see Figure 9-17).
 
2. Select Pointer Options➪Pen.
 
 The mouse cursor changes to a pen to indicate that when you drag, lines 
will appear.
 
3. Right-click or Control-click a second time and, from the pop-up menu, 
select Pen Color to select a color for drawing on the slide.
 
4. Hold the (left) mouse button down and drag to draw on the slide.

the lower-left portion of each slide while the show is running (see Figure 9-18). 
From the pop-up menu that appears, choose Go to Slide. You can also get to 
this menu if you right-click or Control-click the slide while the show is running.

E
ntourage is the application in the Microsoft Office suite that you’re 
most likely to use. You may not give a hoot about spreadsheets, but 
you probably do care a lot about your e-mail. E-mail is where many people 
start their days, and we begin our tour of Entourage in this chapter with e-mail. 
If that’s all you want to know about, that’s okay with us. However, e-mail is 
just one of the Entourage application’s many capabilities. And we cover all 
the things that Entourage does. After you understand how Entourage’s 
features work together, you can use this application to its full extent.
Everything in Entourage revolves around people, communication, time, and 
organization. Entourage integrates tightly with the other Office applications, 
as well as with Mac OS X and the Internet.
In this chapter, we provide an overview of Entourage. We organize the 
chapters in this minibook by using the same order that you find in the 
Entourage application interface.
Introducing Entourage
For those who are new to Office for Mac but are familiar with the Windows 
version of Office, Entourage for Mac is the rough equivalent application to 
Microsoft Outlook in Office for Windows. Microsoft’s Macintosh Business Unit 
(MacBU) has been adding Outlook functionality to Entourage with the goal of 
having Entourage match Outlook’s functionality, especially with regard to pro-
viding Microsoft Exchange support on Mac OS X. If you’re coming to the Mac 
from Windows Outlook, we try to help you feel right at home.
You find many new features in Entourage 2008, and the icons shown in 
Figure 1-1 are just the beginning.

Project Center
Entourage is an application that flows. You read your e-mail and receive 
contact information from a colleague, friend, or relative, so you add to or 
modify your contacts. You can receive and send invitations for events. While 
you’re reading an e-mail, you decide to make a note of something. Your boss 
sends you a text message that requires you to do a task, so you add a task 
to your calendar. Any one or all the preceding tasks may be related to a project 
that you’re working on, so Project Center is in the mix. All day long, you 
need to be aware of what’s coming up, where you should be, and what you 
should be doing. My Day brings it all together in an onscreen organizer. If all 
this talk about Entourage’s capabilities dazzles you, don’t worry — we touch 
on each of these features in later sections of this chapter and then cover 
these items in depth throughout Book V. See Figure 1-2 for a visualization of 
this concept.

Connecting to the Internet with Entourage’s Mail
 
We cover Project Center extensively in Book VI.
Connecting to the Internet with Entourage’s Mail
Looking at e-mail from a distance, we realize it’s been around for longer than 
some of our readers have been alive. To many of you, it’s simply a utility. Yet 
to others, it contains their life. You save your e-mail in archives, and it’s your 
memory. You may store business and personal records in e-mails. Although 
it’s not the newest Internet technology, we can help you understand how to 
use it most effectively.
Discerning the Exchange difference
Exchange is a messaging and collaborative product from Microsoft that helps 
create an e-mail infrastructure backend. And the version of Entourage you 
use affects your ability to connect to an Exchange e-mail server. If you’re 
interested, we explain more about the new Exchange-specific features in the 
sidebar, “Big news for Exchange,” near the end of this chapter.
Three different bundles of Microsoft Office are available. The version of 
Entourage that ships with the Home and Student edition has different 
capabilities compared to the version that ships in the regular Office 2008 
for Mac and Special Media editions.
The difference involves whether Entourage can connect directly to the 
Microsoft Exchange e-mail server. If you know that you want to connect to 
a Microsoft Exchange Server, be aware that the Home and Student package 
doesn’t include Exchange support in Entourage. Regular Office 2008 for 
Mac and Special Media editions do include Exchange support in Entourage. 
This capability difference parallels the Office for Windows versions, where 
Outlook in the Home and Student edition doesn’t include Exchange support.
Making connections to the world
Entourage can connect to most e-mail services, and supports all the popular 
messaging formats, and has easy wizards to help you set up your accounts. 
In some cases, Entourage can figure out your settings just from your e-mail 
address! Figure 1-3 shows that Entourage can connect to many different 
e-mail accounts at the same time.
 
You can read your Gmail in the same window that you read the mail from 
your Internet service provider (ISP).

Keeping Yourself Organized
Entourage offers multiple ways of keeping your contacts and events straight 
by using the program’s Address Book and Calendar options.
Keeping track of people with your contacts list
Sometimes, keeping track of personal information about your contacts is 
called PIM (Personal Information Management). Also, a program such as 
Entourage that helps you keep track of all your contacts’ info is called a 
Personal Information Manager (PIM, again!). Managing your contacts involves 
acquiring and organizing the details you need to know about the people you 
interact with every day. You may want to include home addresses, business 
phone numbers, private phone numbers, and birthdays in your contacts list. 
And you can also add your contacts’ Facebook and MySpace details, if you 
want.
You can send contact information to other people by using e-mail in a special 
message format called a v-card. If you receive a v-card as an e-mail attach-
ment, you can add that person to your Entourage contacts. Many 
organizations support Entourage-friendly directories by using a standard 
known as Lightweight Directory Access Protocol, or LDAP. You can add multiple 
LDAP directories to Entourage, which has automatic integration to AutoFill 
e-mail addresses while you type in address text boxes. Figure 1-4 shows this 
relationship.

Entourage
Your contacts list doesn’t just sit there. Entourage is always checking to see 
who’s online. Well, that’s not exactly true — Entourage can’t find out this 
information, but a companion program called Microsoft Messenger can. 
Messenger often runs along with Entourage, and it can look at your contact 
names and provide you with information about who’s available to communicate 
in real-time with you within the Microsoft Messenger instant messaging 
service.
You can use Microsoft Messenger as a further extension of your online 
presence on the Microsoft’s Live site (http://download.live.com). The 
Live site integrates all Microsoft online services, such as instant messaging, 
e-mail, photo sharing, and so on.
Keeping track of your events with Calendar
Whether it’s a conference agenda, your daily work, or a holiday trip to an 
exotic island, your life depends on time, and Entourage Calendar is the tool 
that you can use to wisely allocate your limited time resources. The number 
of ways you can tag your Calendar events, share them, display them, organize 
them, and print them in the Calendar is truly amazing.
One of the key features of Microsoft Exchange, a collaborative server 
platform, is the Free-Busy schedule, where you can find out the availability 
of other people in your circle. The Free-Busy schedule is supported by the 
Entourage Calendar. Figure 1-5 shows just one of many possible views that 
you can have of an Entourage Calendar.
Making notes for yourself
Everyone needs a place to keep notes. Entourage’s Notes offers a place to 
keep those notes where you can associate them with your contacts, events, 
and projects. Not every feature in Entourage is dramatic. This one is simple, 
good, and convenient.

Assigning tasks
Closely aligned with the Entourage Calendar is Entourage Tasks. Tasks are 
time-sensitive, like Calendar events, but are kept separate so that you can 
check them off when you complete them. Tasks are also tied into the new 
My Day feature so that you can keep an eye on them during your day. Tasks 
can trigger notifications so that you get reminders about your tasks. When 
you use Flag for Follow Up in Word, Excel, or PowerPoint, Entourage Tasks 
handles the follow-up job.
Making My Day your day
 
A brand-new feature in Entourage 2008 is the My Day floating reminder and 
organizer. My Day (see Figure 1-6) is on top and visible all day long to let you 
see your appointments, events, and tasks when they’re coming due so that 
you can stay on top of things.

Automating Entourage
Organizing a project in the Project Center
 
The Project Center is a large application within Entourage. Project Center 
is so large that we devote an entire minibook to it (see Book VI). In many 
situations, it’s sensible to organize things for a project. You may have ongo-
ing projects, such as being a member of a standing committee. You may work 
on projects that have a specific timeframe, such as organizing or attending a 
conference, wedding, business project, or remodeling job. Project Center can 
help you plan, coordinate, execute, and document 
standalone and multiple projects.
Entourage’s Project Center can associate documents and e-mail with 
particular contacts. Entourage supports advanced linking of anything and 
everything that has to do with your contacts, tasks, mail, Calendar events, 
and projects. You can share projects that you create in the Project Center 
with coworkers, which is especially useful when everyone has Microsoft 
Entourage. Windows users can share some aspects of Project Center, 
including documents and Calendar events. We explain how to take 
advantage of all this in the Project Center minibook.
Customizing Entourage toolbars
 
A great new feature of Entourage is that now you can customize its toolbars. 
Entourage has always had a Web-browser feel to it, and now even more so 
with the ability to drag and drop toolbar icons. Each application within 
Entourage has its own set of toolbar icons, and you’ll see those icons as we 
discuss some of the individual applications throughout this minibook.
Automating Entourage
AppleScript and Entourage have a great working relationship. AppleScript is 
a scripting language built by Apple into Mac OS X. Entourage’s AppleScript 
dictionary was updated for the 2008 version. Many useful AppleScripts 
are available, and you can also make your own. The following Web site 
contains almost everything you need to know about scripting Entourage: 
www.entourage.mvps.org/script/index.html.
 
Completely new for Office 2008 are Entourage Automator workflows. Some 
prebuilt workflows come with the Office 2008 for Mac and Special Media 
editions, but regardless of which edition of Office 2008 you have, you can 
build your own Automator workflows. Building workflows is easy. You just 
drag and drop within the Automator application, which you can find in 
your Applications folder. You can build workflows from one application to 
another, as shown in Figure 1-7. And you’re not limited to building workflows 
within Microsoft Office. Workflows can interact with any application that 
provides Automator support.

618
Taking Care of the Entourage Database
 
Figure 1-7: 
Building an 
Automator 
workflow 
from 
Entourage 
to Word.
 
In Book IV, Chapter 6, we have a detailed, step-by-step example that explains 
how to create your own Automator Actions. If you’ve never built Automator 
Actions before, that’s a good one to start with. After you get the general idea, 
we think you’ll find experimenting with Automator Actions in Entourage 
fairly easy. You’ll be building useful workflows in no time!
Taking Care of the Entourage Database
Entourage can handle enormous amounts of information — terabytes, if 
needed. Most Entourage databases are much smaller than that. Everything 
that Entourage saves is kept in a single database file. You can compress the 
database if you want to reduce the amount of drive space that Entourage 
uses.
You can also use a database rebuild utility in the rare case that Entourage 
requests that you use it. Before using the rebuild utility, be sure that 
your hard drive is functioning properly by checking it with DiskWarrior, 
TechTools, Drive Genius, or a similar disk-checking utility. We don’t cover 
these utilities in this book, but a quick online search gets you more details 
on these products.

Book V
Chapter 1
Introducing 
Entourage: Seven

619
Taking Care of the Entourage Database
 
Make an archive of your database before rebuilding it. It’s always a good idea 
to have a backup!
Before you attempt to compact or rebuild your Entourage database, be 
sure to exit not just Entourage, but also all Office applications, as well 
as Microsoft Messenger. Don’t open any Office applications or Microsoft 
Messenger while you’re using this utility. To activate the Database Utility, 
press and hold the Option key when you start Entourage. Database Utility, 
as shown in Figure 1-8, opens. Be aware that if your database is large and 
complex or if your hard drive is nearly filled to capacity, this utility can take 
a very long time to complete the process.
 
Figure 1-8: 
Maintaining 
Entourage 
databases.
 
Verifying database integrity
You can run the Database Utility to determine whether your Entourage 
database is functioning correctly. If your database is working correctly, you 
can safely compress your database. If your database isn’t working correctly, 
you can rebuild your database.
Compacting your database
Running Database Utility can result in disk-space savings. Entourage creates 
a copy of your existing database and then makes a new, compacted version. 
So, temporarily, your database needs twice as much room (the original, plus 
a copy). You can trash the old database after you’re convinced that the new 
one’s working properly.

620
Taking Care of the Entourage Database
Rebuilding your database
Rebuilding your database is a radical step to take, so use Database Utility 
only if Entourage’s Verify Integrity check advises you to do so, or if you 
receive a database warning message while using Entourage. Follow the 
instructions carefully in Entourage’s help topic, Verify and Rebuild the 
Entourage Database, particularly if you use Microsoft Exchange.
Big news for Exchange
Major improvements have been made to the 
way Microsoft Exchange Server works with 
applications, such as Outlook, Entourage, and 
Apple Mail. The result is that programs that 
connect to exchange servers can offer faster 
connections and support Exchange features 
better. Apple and Microsoft’s MacBU are 
revamping their respective e-mail programs to 
take advantage of the new Exchange features.
Exchange users will soon have three major 
applications from which to choose: Microsoft 
Entourage, Apple Mail, and for Windows users, 
Microsoft Outlook. While we write this chapter, 
Microsoft is beta-testing a new version of 
Entourage, and Apple is beta-testing Snow 
Leopard.
According to Apple’s Web site: “Snow Leopard 
includes out-of-the-box support for Microsoft 
Exchange 2007 built into Mail, Address Book, 
and iCal. Mac OS X uses the Exchange Web 
Services protocol to provide access to 
Exchange Server 2007. Because Exchange is 
supported on your Mac and iPhone, you’ll be 
able to use them anywhere with full access to 
your e-mail, contacts, and Calendar.”
Microsoft has been steadily making Entourage 
a better Exchange application. In the past, 
Microsoft hasn’t waited for major releases of 
Office to include new and improved function-
ality for Microsoft Exchange support. Based 
on Microsoft’s history, major updates could 
come to Entourage before the next full release 
of Office. IT professionals should keep track 
of this site: www.microsoft.com/mac/
itpros/default.mspx.
Any way you look at it, if your organization uses 
the current version of Microsoft Exchange, 
you’ll soon (maybe even by the time you read 
this) be able to choose from several newly 
available e-mail applications and platforms.

Chapter 2: Welcome to the

In This Chapter

B
efore you can actually use your e-mail account, Entourage needs to 
know certain things about how to connect to the mail server. You can 
get most of this information from your Internet service provider (ISP) or 
your company’s system administrator.
In this chapter, we cover basic e-mail configuration information, followed by 
a tour of Entourage’s preferences. We organized this chapter so that if you 
already know what kind of connection you’re dealing with, or if you have a 
relatively high skill level, you can go right to the appropriate section. Even if 
you don’t know anything about how to set up Entourage, we go step by step 
through the basic setup with you. We know the built-in wizard in Entourage 
is good, so if you already have your e-mail account up and running, feel free 
to skip the setup information.
Setting Up with the Setup Assistant
The first time you open Entourage, you’re greeted by the default e-mail view 
in the background with the Entourage Setup Assistant on top, as shown 
in Figure 2-1. Additionally, you may be asked whether you want to choose 
Entourage to be your Mac’s default e-mail application. We recommend that 
you answer in the affirmative.
 
If you dismiss Entourage’s Setup Assistant when it appears for the first time and 
it doesn’t show itself when you launch Entourage again, you can’t do much to 
get the same initial Setup Assistant screen. But you can get to the screen that 
follows the initial one (as shown in Figure 2-2). To launch the Setup Assistant 
manually (so that you can access the second screen), follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Tools➪Accounts to open the tabbed Accounts dialog.
 
2. Click the arrow next to New in the toolbar and choose Mail from the 
pop-up menu that appears.
 
 The Setup Assistant appears.

Message body
First, we focus on the Entourage Setup Assistant and help you get through 
some of the most common scenarios, but take a moment to look over the 
other elements of the starting mail interface (see Figure 2-1).
The Entourage Setup Assistant offers three options:
 
✦ Start using Entourage without importing anything
 
✦ Import from a previous version of Entourage
 
✦ Import from another application
Click the small forward-arrow button in the lower-right corner of the Setup 
Assistant when you want to advance to the next step.
Starting without importing anything
You can use the Start Using Entourage without Importing Anything option 
if you want to set up a new e-mail account and have no files to import from 
another e-mail program. Follow these steps:

Book V

623
Setting Up with the Setup Assistant
 
1. In the Set Up a Mail Account step of the Setup Assistant, no matter 
what kind of mail host you have, enter your full e-mail address 
(see Figure 2-2) and then advance to the next step by clicking the 
right-pointing arrow in the bottom right of the window.
 
Figure 2-2: 
Telling 
Entourage 
your e-mail 
address.
 
 
 What you see in the next window depends on what you enter in this 
one. Entourage attempts to figure out your e-mail settings based on your 
e-mail address:
 
• If you entered an e-mail address at Hotmail, Gmail (Google mail), or 
another well-known e-mail provider, it’s clear sailing. You receive 
a message stating that the configuration settings were successfully 
determined.
 
• If you see a different message, Entourage couldn’t determine the 
settings for your e-mail account. Entourage explains the situation 
and then prompts you to enter the settings supplied to you by 
your e-mail service provider. If you don’t have the settings, you can 
almost always find them at the Web site of your ISP. Skip ahead to 
the section “Configuring an e-mail account manually,” later in this 
chapter, if you need to supply this info.
 
2. After Entourage successfully finds your e-mail settings, advance to the 
next window and enter your password.
 
3. Click the arrow to advance to the Verify and Complete Settings 
window.
 
 Figure 2-3 shows the proper settings for a Gmail account.
 
You can change the Incoming Mail server type to IMAP or POP, depending 
on how it’s set up in the dialog shown in Figure 2-3. Figure 2-4 shows the 
actual pop-up menu that lets you alternate between IMAP and POP.

shown in Figure 2-1.
Figure 2-1 shows the message body displayed on the right side, with a list 
of the e-mail subjects in the middle. You can change the view setting by 
using the Entourage View menu. Choose View➪Preview Pane➪Below List

Attachments
Internet service providers usually offer two 
different kinds of service. One kind is POP; the 
other kind is IMAP. At one time, POP was the 
dominant method, but IMAP is what we recom-
mend now if you have a choice. Here’s a brief 
explanation of the difference:
 ✓ IMAP: Configured to keep your mail inbox 
on the provider’s server. You can create 
subfolders on the server to store mail in 
folders, such as read mail, deleted mes-
sages, junk mail, or any folder you want. 
The advantage of IMAP is that you can 
connect to the server from various devices. 
Your message list appears the same from 
any device, such as your iPod or cellphone, 
your computer at home, or your laptop while 
you’re at a hotel. Your e-mail account has 
the same messages available, regardless 
of what device you use, no matter where 
you connect.
 ✓ POP: Usually configured to download 
e-mail messages to your local computer 
and delete them from the server right 
away. This option is fine if you have only 
one computer and one location. Although 
you can set POP to leave the messages on 
the server, in general, you run the risk of 
accidentally deleting a wanted message.
POP or IMAP: Deciding which service to use

626
Setting Up with the Setup Assistant
Setting up an account for Microsoft Exchange
To set up an account for Microsoft Exchange, go to Step 2 of the Setup 
Assistant (see Figure 2-2). You find a check box for My Account Is on an 
Exchange Server, unless you’re using the Home and Student edition of 
Microsoft Office. If you’re using an Exchange account, select the check box. 
You’re then prompted to enter the following information:
 
✦ Domain
 
✦ Account ID
 
✦ Password
You can add your password to your Mac OS X keychain, if you want.
Then, you’re ready to advance to the next step. If Entourage is successful at 
connecting to your Exchange account, you proceed to the preview pane (see 
Figures 2-1 and 2-5). If Entourage isn’t successful connecting, a pane appears 
in which you can manually enter your account information (see Figure 2-6).
 
Figure 2-6: 
Entering 
Exchange 
account 
information.
 
Figuring out an IMAP account
When you set up an IMAP account, you might be a little confused because 
you see two items called Inbox in your list of mailboxes in the left pane of 
the mail view. The Inbox at the top of the list is actually located on your 
Internet mail provider’s server. The other Inbox is located under the On 
My Computer category. The purpose of this second Inbox is to allow you 
to store messages locally, on your own computer’s hard drive. You can’t 
access any messages that you copy or move to folders of the Inbox located 
On My Computer from any other computer.
The default behavior for deleting messages from the first Inbox, the one at 
the top of the mailboxes list, is a two-step operation (see Figure 2-7). After 
you delete a message from an IMAP server, you usually can’t retrieve it. To 
delete a mail message from an IMAP Home account, follow these steps:

Importing from a previous version of Entourage
Importing from a previous version of Entourage is safe and easy. Your old 
identity will be imported but left intact in its current location so that you can 
always go back to it again later. Follow these steps:
 
1. In the Setup Assistant, select the Import from a Previous Version of 
Entourage option (see Figure 2-1).
 
 A window appears, asking which version of Entourage created your 
database, as shown in Figure 2-8.
 
2. Specify your version of Entourage.
 
 Entourage attempts to locate that database. If Entourage can find the 
database, the identity or identities that you can import appear in a list 
for you to choose from.

Adding additional e-mail accounts
You can add additional e-mail accounts to the pane that has your Inbox and 
mailboxes. Follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Tools➪Accounts.
 
 The Accounts dialog appears.
 
2. Click the New button and select Mail.
 
 The Entourage Setup Assistant, as shown in Figure 2-2, starts.
 
3. Enter the settings for the new account by following the steps in the 
wizard.
 
 You can add any kind of e-mail account, and the new e-mail account 
doesn’t have to be the same kind as a previous account. Accounts that 
you add share your Calendar and contacts.
 
We discuss both the Calendar and contacts in Book V.
If your Mac has multiple users, each user should have her own Mac OS X 
login so that each e-mail account identity is discreet, secure, and separate. 
When you set up Entourage e-mail accounts for different Mac OS X users, 
each one is independent. One Mac OS X user can’t see another user’s 
messages or any other aspect of Entourage. Even if you use Mac OS X Fast 
User Switching, Entourage keeps each user’s account properly as its own 
secure, independent account.
 
If you manage major events or physical entities (perhaps a meeting room), 
consider using Mac OS X user accounts, and treat each event or thing as 
an identity. You can create a new user in Mac OS X by choosing System 
Preferences➪Accounts. You can use additional accounts for large discreet 
functions or for those you want to keep separate from your regular activities. 
Use Mac OS X Fast User Switching to quickly move from one account to 
another.
Chapter 4 of this minibook discusses newsgroups, for which you can use this 
feature. Another example is hosting a conference. If you use this strategy, 
you can give your event its own e-mail address, contacts, and Calendar. You 
can keep those special things separate from your every day mail.
Configuring an e-mail account manually
You can also configure your Entourage account yourself:
 
1. Start Entourage.
 
2. When the Setup Assistant (see Figure 2-2) appears, click the red Close 
button.
 
 The Setup Assistant closes.

1. Choose Tools➪Accounts.
 
 The Accounts pane appears.
 
 If you have more than one account, you can click the Make Default 
button to choose a default account that Entourage uses when it opens.
 
2. Double-click the account name in the Accounts pane for the account 
you want to view or edit (see Figure 2-12).
 
 The Edit Account Wizard opens.

Configuring settings
The first tab of the Edit Account pane is Account Settings, as shown in 
Figure 2-13. The name that appears in the Name text box of the Personal 
Information section is the name that appears when people receive e-mail 
from you.
In most cases, you don’t need to change any of the settings on the Account 
Settings tab, but you should review the other tabs.
If your ISP changes its e-mail server or other account settings, you can make 
changes in this pane. You have to configure some e-mail accounts manually 
with special security settings.

Settings for IMAP users
The Advanced tab (see Figure 2-16) doesn’t appear for POP e-mail accounts. 
Don’t let the Advanced label scare you away. This pane lets you decide what 
happens when you delete messages. Instead of deleting, you might want to 
save them to a different folder, either on the server or on your own computer. 
This pane also lets you decide how to automatically deal with draft messages 
and junk mail.

Accommodating digital signatures and encryption
Chapter 3 of this minibook covers working with digital signatures and docu-
ment encryption. In the Mail Security tab of the Edit Account pane, you 
can deal with digital signatures (see Figure 2-17). If you plan to use digital 
signatures when sending mail or if you need to add a digital signature you 
received from someone who sent a digital signature to you, this is the pane 
you need.

Touring the Entourage Preferences
Although it might seem that account settings are preferences, they’re not 
general preferences that affect the overall behavior of Entourage. Account 
settings affect only the specific account they’re applied to. In the following 
sections, we explore settings that apply to the entire Entourage program. 
We’re not going to talk about every single setting. You’d die of boredom 
if we did that. We highlight particular settings we think you might want to 
know about.
 
All the preferences we discuss are from the upper-left corner of your screen, 
where you choose Entourage➪Preferences, as shown in Figure 2-18.

Going with general admission
The first category of the Preferences pane is General. When you select 
General Preferences, you see the choices offered in Figure 2-19. We want to 
draw your attention to two settings, in particular:
 
✦ Double-Clicking in the Folders List Opens a New Window: This setting 
is selected by default. We’ve seen people accidentally open window on 
top of identical window without realizing it. To prevent something of 
this sort, we suggest that you deselect this check box.
 
✦ Set Entourage to Be My Default E-Mail Client: Click this button to 
change the default e-mail client to Entourage. When you click a Mail To 
link in a document, PowerPoint presentation, or Web browser, your Mac 
uses the default e-mail client to send the message.

Customizing the Address Book
In the Address Book preferences, near the upper-right corner, is a Customize 
button. Click it to select an Address Book format or add your own custom 
address format (see Figure 2-20).
Changing the To Do List
The To Do List preferences are only two. We changed the settings, as shown 
in Figure 2-21, but that’s just our preferences. Do your own thing. Here’s 
some more info on what these options do:
 
✦ Default Due Date for To Do Items: Normally set to Today, but you can 
set it for anything from Tomorrow to Next Week, or even No Date.
 
✦ Default Snooze Time for Reminders: Reminds you to do something 
in a given amount of time. You can change that time to anything from 
5 minutes to 2 weeks.

Clarifying the Calendar preferences
Take a peek at the Calendar preference settings, as shown in Figure 2-22. 
Even if you don’t need to change them, you may want to know where these 
settings are, for future reference:
 
✦ First Day of the Week: Everyone knows it’s Sunday, right? We’ve heard 
rumors that entire countries get this one wrong and think it’s Monday. 
No matter. Whatever day you want, go ahead and pick it from the pop-up 
menu.
 
✦ Calendar Work Week: Entourage’s default is Monday through Friday, 
but of course, not everyone works the same days. Select the check 
boxes to match your own work week.
 
✦ Work Hours: 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. is a fine schedule, but if this doesn’t 
match your work hours, you can change this setting.
Fiddling with your fonts
You’re not stuck with Entourage’s default fonts and font sizes. In the Fonts 
category, you can change them (see Figure 2-23). You can assign various 
fonts for viewing plain text, HTML, or printed text.

Controlling the spell checker
Like the other Office applications, Entourage uses Microsoft Word’s spell 
checker, dictionary, and custom dictionaries. We have a great deal of detail 
about these tools in Book II, Chapter 4. Generally, Entourage’s default settings 
are just fine (see Figure 2-24), unless you want more control over your spell 
checks. Among other settings, you can opt to not spell check words that 
contain numbers, Web URLs, or anything that’s typed in ALL CAPS (such as 
an acronym). You can also select a check box to tell Entourage to run the 
spell checker before it sends each e-mail message.

Turning off that little mail notification
If you don’t like the little window that appears and then disappears now 
and then to tell you about new mail while you’re working, the Notification 
section has a check box that lets you turn it off.
Staying slightly more secure
You might want to check out the Security preferences (see Figure 2-25). 
We have no objections to the default settings. Display Complex HTML in 
Messages is the default, so don’t change that setting unless you have a 
reason to do so.
 
Figure 2-25: 
Allowing 
complex 
HTML

We strongly advise against changing the Download Pictures setting (see 
Figure 2-25). Leave it at Never. Spammers and other ne’er-do-wells can use 
pictures to spy on you. Someone might include a picture in an e-mail so that 
he can determine whether you look at his message. Downloading pictures 
tells the message sender your IP (Internet Protocol) address, as well as the 
date and time that you download the picture.
The Never setting causes Entourage to warn you when you receive a 
message that wants you to download one or more pictures — pictures that 
can tip off a server somewhere, that is. Figure 2-26 shows the warning that 
appears at the top of an e-mail message that contains a dangerous picture. It 
probably wants to tattle on you. Only click the blue Download Pictures link if 
you don’t mind telling the sender who you are, where you are, and when you 
download the picture. Download Pictures is especially risky when you don’t 
know the sender and when you receive a forwarded e-mail message.
Of course, if you know and trust a sender, you can download the pictures he 
attaches to an e-mail. Don’t get paranoid about displaying vacation pictures 
your friends send you!

Syncing the services
Entourage databases can be synced with your Apple Address Book, Apple 
iCal, and even your .Mac account. The settings in the Sync Services pane let 
you turn these sync options on and off (see Figure 2-27).

Enjoying the Spotlight
Spotlight is the search technology that Apple included in Mac OS X. Allowing 
Spotlight to index your Entourage database might slow your computer and/
or cause Spotlight to use considerably more disk space, so the indexing 
Entourage attachments option is deselected by default. Each Entourage user 
is unique. Consider the following things before using the Spotlight option to 
index Entourage attachments:
 
✦ It might slow Spotlight.
 
✦ It might use up a lot of hard drive space.
 
✦ You may find it handy if you use Spotlight a lot and have tons of 
Entourage attachments.
Feeding MacBU
If you don’t object to sending your system profile and other information 
related to software crashes to Microsoft’s Macintosh Business Unit (MacBU), 
say yes to the Feedback option. Details are in the pane.

Nothing to read
We think the settings in the Read section are benign. You don’t have much 
to worry about here. Of course, if you want your messages to appear unread 
after being displayed for 20 seconds or your message windows to close 
automatically after you delete a message, you can spend some time with 
these options.
Gaining your composure
The Compose settings, as shown in Figure 2-28, do deserve a once-over. You 
may find a few of interest:
 
✦ Mail Format: HTML: In Entourage 2008, the default setting has changed 
from Text to HTML. HTML allows formatting more like a word processor 
but uses a little more bandwidth. If you have friends in remote areas that 
have slow dialup connections, change this setting to Text. Otherwise, 
HTML is fine.
 
✦ Append File Name Extensions: Always keep this setting selected — it’s 
actually deselected by default (how bizarre!). If you don’t select this 
option, Windows users may have trouble opening your attachments.
 
✦ Display a List of Recently Used Addresses When Addressing Messages: 
When this option is selected, Entourage keeps track of the 300 or so 
most recently sent or received e-mail addresses and uses them to 
auto-complete e-mail addresses while you type them in address fields.
 
✦ Click List button: If you click this button, Entourage erases those 300 or 
so addresses from its memory. Removing those addresses might cause a 
problem if you haven’t added someone to your contacts and are used to 
having his or her address automatically fill in, so don’t click this button 
unless you’re sure about it.

E
-mail is more than just a way of communicating; it’s a vital lifeline for 
businesses and organizations. Socially, text messaging on cellphones 
may have supplanted e-mail as the dominant form of casual communica-
tion for some people. Devices like the Apple iPhone blend text messaging, 
phone, and e-mail into a single device, extending the utility of all the fea-
tures of e-mail with the benefit of portability.
E-mail is a staple of everyone’s life because it’s convenient; and it’s easy to 
save, search, archive, and organize. If you need to have solid evidence that 
mail was sent or received, you can use digitally signed mail as proof that a 
particular document was transmitted from one person or entity to another.
We begin this chapter with simple mail basics and then cover mail organiza-
tion tools. Along the way, we take a detour to mention some nice features of 
Entourage that you may not be aware of.
Picking a Preview Pane View
By now, you may have your e-mail account set up. After you select your 
Inbox in the folder list (on the left side of the pane), choose the View menu, 
and then select one of the following preview pane arrangements:
 
✦ On Right: This is Entourage’s initial arrangement, as shown in Figures 
3-1 and 3-2. When the preview pane is on the right, message subjects 
appear in a column in the middle. If you click to highlight a message 
subject, a preview of your message appears to the right of the list of 
subjects, as shown with the built-in sample message in Figure 3-2.

✦ Below List: This layout option moves the preview pane to a position 
below the list of message subjects, as shown Figures 3-3 and 3-4. When 
you click a message subject, a preview of the message appears below 
the list of message subjects.
 
 If you compare Figures 3-2 and 3-4, the main difference between them is 
that the message body now appears below the message list. In the folder 
list on the left side of each of the screens, we clicked the disclosure 
triangles to show Microsoft Newsgroups (we show you how to set up 
newsgroups up in Chapter 4 of this minibook), and we closed the Mail 
Views triangle. We also widened the left pane to show two months of the 
Calendar at the same time.
 
✦ None: If you select this option, you don’t see a preview pane. The list of 
message subjects fills a larger area. To read a message, double-click a 
message subject, and the message opens in its own window.

Creating a Message
Reading Mail
Entourage makes reading your mail simple, not to mention organizing your 
e-mail and activities in useful ways.
Regardless of which preview pane view you select, you can double-click a 
message subject in the message list to open the message in its own window, 
as shown in Figure 3-4. The Reply, Reply All, Forward, Print, and Delete 
buttons on the toolbar do just what they say. The following list provides a 
quick run down of the buttons that do additional things you may not have 
started to include in your daily routine:
 
✦ To Do: Sometimes, you wind up having to do something as the result of 
an e-mail message. That’s when you should click the tiny triangle just to 
the right of the big red To Do flag. Of course, make sure that the relevant 
e-mail is the open e-mail! Select an option from the pop-up menu that 
appears, and you’ve just created a To Do task!
 
✦ Categories: Click the Categories button and then tag the message with 
one or more categories from the list.
 
✦ Projects: Click the Projects button to mark a message as being associated 
with an existing project, or even start a new project at the same 
moment. We talk about projects in Book VI.
 
✦ Links: Entourage can automatically link messages to other items so that 
you can find them more easily and document your activities.
You can find even more options available to you when you right-click or 
Control-click icons and attachments in the message header, also shown 
in Figure 3-4. We right-clicked an e-mail address from a sender who wasn’t 
already in our contacts, so Entourage offered to use this e-mail address to 
start a new contact. Try right-clicking or Control-clicking in the message 
body, and even try selecting some text first and then right-clicking to see 
even more options!
 
When you see the warning that pictures weren’t downloaded, only download 
the pictures if you want a server somewhere to know who you are, where 
you are, and when you downloaded the picture.
Creating a Message
You can compose e-mail messages in Microsoft Office 2008 in several 
different ways. Most people use the Entourage message creation window. 
In the following sections, we discuss how to use this application as well as 
describe the other ways you can create e-mail.

648
Creating a Message
Creating e-mail in Entourage
Perhaps the most common way to start a new mail message is to click the 
New button in the Entourage Mail application. The window shown in Figure 
3-5 opens. Entourage shows an empty message-body area where you can 
type your message, just like if you were using a word processor. In fact, 
you’re using Microsoft Word’s spell checker in Entourage Mail, and the Tools 
menu includes the same familiar dictionary, thesaurus, and other editing 
tools that you can find in Microsoft Word. We right-clicked our misspelled 
word to select a correction from the pop-up menu that Entourage offered.

Although you can easily include media, such as pictures and movies, in your 
Entourage e-mails, be careful about file sizes. E-mail servers often have a 
5MB limit per message, although some mail servers aren’t as picky these 
days. Even then, some recipients might not be happy with e-mails half that 
size. You can insert media into an e-mail message by using the Insert button 
on the toolbar or by dragging the media into the message body. You’ve 
inserted media where the cursor is blinking.

Exploring the Entourage Menu Options
Creating e-mail in Microsoft Word
Some people are comfortable with Microsoft Word when they write, and 
that’s just fine. You might prefer to use Word to create your e-mail messages 
so that you can use the tools and interface you’re familiar with, or perhaps 
you have templates that you want to use. We can think of three ways to send 
mail from Microsoft Word. In all cases, Entourage actually sends the mail.
Sending in HTML format
If you choose HTML format, your composed message appears in the body 
of the recipient’s e-mail message. We recommend that you compose your 
e-mail messages by using Web Layout, which you can find on Word’s View 
menu. When you’re ready to send your message, choose File➪Send To➪Mail 
Recipient (as HTML). You can’t use all of Word’s features when you use 
this method because e-mail programs aren’t as robust as Microsoft Word. 
However, you can still use niceties, such as pictures and tables.
Sending as an attached Word document
If you choose this format, your message appears as an attachment to 
an e-mail message. You can use all of Word’s features when you use this 
method. When you’re ready to send your message, choose File➪Send 
To➪Mail Recipient (as Attachment).
Using Mail Merge
You use Mail Merge while in Microsoft Word. By using Mail Merge, you can 
send hundreds of similar e-mails to different people. All these e-mails may 
have the same body content, but all your recipients see a greeting that’s 
addressed specifically to them so that they think you wrote that e-mail only 
to them! See Book II, Chapter 6 for more details.
Exploring the Entourage Menu Options
Entourage’s interface is very context-sensitive. The menu options and 
toolbars are so varied that we can only urge you to explore them often while 
you’re working in Entourage. We start at the top of the interface and work 
our way down. Because many of the interface features are based on what 
you’re doing or what you’ve selected, we can’t show you them all.
While you’re working in Entourage, you can open a pop-up menu that 
offers context-sensitive options for whatever you’ve selected. Right-click or 
Control-click just about everything in Entourage, and you’re rewarded with a 
pop-up menu that’s been tailored specifically for whatever you clicked.

650
Exploring the Entourage Menu Options
 
We’re so glad that Microsoft retained the menus in Office for Mac just the 
way we like them. Menus are a sensible, time-tested, and easy way to 
organize features in an interface. Also, you can access many features only 
through the menus.
 
The Entourage menu alone has an explosion of new features because the 
Mac OS X Services submenu has been added in Entourage 2008 (see Figure 
3-6). If you first select something in Entourage’s interface and then explore 
the Services submenu, you can find a lot of amazing new things to try. Just 
look at them all! You may see different options than the ones in Figure 3-6 
because Services integrates Entourage with all the other applications on 
your computer, and you probably have different applications than we do. 
One of our favorite services is to have Entourage speak selected text, 
especially when we’re tired. Everyone gets this service because it’s part 
of Mac OS X.
 
Figure 3-6: 
Mining the 
Entourage 
menu.
 
The following list explores some other Entourage options we use frequently:
 
✦ Work Offline: This toggle switch (see the Entourage menu in Figure 3-6) 
changes the way Entourage handles e-mail messages. When you’re not 
connected to the Internet, select this item. You can work normally in 
Entourage. Entourage brilliantly keeps track of everything you do while 
you’re not connected. Then, when you’re connected to the Internet 
again, select the Work Offline setting again to toggle it off. Entourage 
then sends all the messages that it queued and brings itself up to date 
with your mail server. A check mark next to Work Offline in the menu 
means that Entourage isn’t communicating with the network.

Book V
Chapter 3
Mastering Mail
651
Exploring the Entourage Menu Options
 
 Use this feature when you’re on an airplane that’s not WiFi-equipped or 
any time you can’t get a network connection.
 
✦ Switch Identity: A long time ago, before Mac OS X fast user switching, 
Entourage had its own way of handling multiple identities. In Chapter 
2 of this minibook, we explain that you should create Mac OS X user 
accounts to handle multiple identities. Although Entourage 2008 still 
supports the old-style identities, we don’t recommend them because 
they’re not as secure as using Mac OS X user accounts. If you’re using 
the old Entourage identities, we recommend that you migrate your 
Entourage identities into new Mac OS X identities.
 
✦ Search with Google: Select some text, and then choose Entourage ➪
Search with Google. Google searches for whatever you selected.
 
✦ Summarize: If you have this option in your version of Entourage, 
you can select text to copy from a Web site and then choose 
Entourage➪Services➪Summarize. A new window opens displaying a 
cleaned-up copy of the Web site text with all the extraneous formatting, 
spacing, and links removed. Then you can copy the text in this new 
window and put it wherever you like.
Using File menu options
Entourage doesn’t have its own document type, so it doesn’t have a File➪
Open feature. You can save things from Entourage in various formats, and you 
can import different sorts of things, such as pictures, into Entourage. Here’s 
some must-have information about the Entourage File menu options:
 
✦ Project Gallery: Opens Project Gallery, which we discuss extensively in 
Book I.
 
✦ New: Choosing File➪New enables you to make new things in Entourage, 
such as a new mail message, a new Calendar event, and so on. You can 
find New buttons in each of the Entourage applications, but choosing 
File➪New gets at all the new stuff at the same time, as shown in Figure 3-7.
 
✦ Import: This menu option starts a wizard that can bring many different 
kinds of things into Entourage. You may find it particularly useful when 
you want to import an Entourage archive file (for example, if you switch 
computers and need to import all your old e-mails), a list of contacts, or 
a list of holidays. See Figure 3-8 to see the Import Wizard pane.
 
✦ Export: Export offers two options, export contacts and create an 
archive, which we talk about in the following sections. Figure 3-9 shows 
the complete set of exporting options.
You can simply drag almost any item from Entourage and then let it go in 
Finder. A file of the appropriate type is created instantly.

Exploring the Entourage Menu Options
Export contacts
The first export option, export contacts, lets you save your contacts in a 
tab-delimited text file. Tab-delimited text files are essentially text files in 
which each record is separated from another by a tab. You can open them in 
Excel or use them to migrate to another e-mail program (heaven forbid!).
Create an archive
Create an archive, the second Export option, creates an archive file that 
contains various Entourage contents. An archive files has an .rge file 
extension. We recommend creating archives as a good way to back up 
your files.
 
Time Machine is Apple’s backup solution that’s built into new versions of 
Mac OS X. Entourage databases can be very large and fill up a Time Machine 
backup drive quickly. If your Entourage database is causing problems with 
Time Machine, exclude it from the Time Machine backup. Instead, you can 
use AppleScript to create an Entourage archive on a scheduled basis, or you 
can use some other method, such as a file-synchronizing program, to make 
sure that the Microsoft User Data folder in your Documents folder is regularly 
backed up.
Using Edit menu options
Entourage’s Edit menu has the expected cut, copy, and paste actions, but 
it also has some special actions that are unique to Entourage, as shown in 
Figure 3-10. We don’t think you can find yourself in a situation in which every 
one of the Edit menu items is active at the same time. The Edit menu knows 
when it should let you do something and when it shouldn’t.
The Edit menu contains these options (some of these options may not be 
available, depending on what you select in your Entourage window):
 
✦ Purge Deleted Items: If this option appears, it lets you permanently 
delete mail messages that you’ve previously marked for deletion. Some 
mail programs use expunge for their comparable feature. Purge Deleted 
Items appears only if you’re using an IMAP mail account.
 
✦ Auto Text Cleanup: Nope, this isn’t Word’s AutoText feature. Use this 
feature to clean up quotation marks and other clutter before forwarding 
an e-mail.
 
✦ Increase (or Decrease) Font Size: This handy keyboard shortcut works 
in many Entourage windows. Press Ô+ to enlarge a font and Ô– to make 
a font smaller.

Scoping the View menu
The View menu has plenty of interesting options from which to choose, as 
shown in Figure 3-11. We already discussed the preview pane options in the 
section, “Picking a Preview Pane View,” earlier in this chapter. The following 
list gives you a closer look at some of the other View menu options:
 
Figure 3-11: 
An overview 
of the View 
menu.

655
Exploring the Entourage Menu Options
 
✦ Unread Only: When you turn on this option, only messages that you 
haven’t read appear in the message list. Select this option a second time 
to view all messages.
 
✦ Refresh Message List: If it seems like Entourage isn’t synchronized 
with the mail server, select your Inbox and then choose this option. 
Entourage abandons the current message list and replaces it with 
whatever’s on the server.
 
✦ Customize Toolbar: New for Entourage 2008 is the ability to customize 
Entourage toolbars. See Figure 3-12 for the main Entourage mail toolbar 
customizations. The Customize Toolbar feature is new, and it works 
differently from the customizing toolbars in Word, Excel, and 
PowerPoint. Entourage works like a Web browser, so you use a sheet to 
drag and drop controls to and from Entourage toolbars. A sheet is the 
pane that appears beneath the toolbar when you select the Customize 
Toolbar option. The sheet contains the customization buttons. As we 
mention in Book I, each application within Entourage has its own toolbar 
customizations. Not only that, but each different kind of Entourage 
window has its own toolbar customizations. Try the Customize Toolbar 
feature in different windows while you’re working in Entourage.
 
Figure 3-12:

Minding the toolbar buttons and palettes
You can find most of the subheadings on the menus, as shown in Figure 
3-13, also on the toolbars of message windows and in the Toolbox. As you’d 
expect, they do the same things.

656
Tooling Down the Toolbar Highway
 
If you see the Message menu, you know you’re in the Mail component of 
Entourage.
 
Figure 3-13:

Sailing through the Script menu
That little strange-looking figure that appears on the right side of the Help 
menu is actually a menu (see Figure 3-14) — the Script menu, to be precise. It 
has some very useful stuff, so click it and have a look, or just peek at Figure 
3-14. The options are all self-explanatory. If you have the Home and Student 
edition of Office, you probably don’t see the Sample Automator Workflows 
option, but you can make your own workflows in Automator.
 
You can find out more about Automator in Book IV, Chapter 6.
 
Figure 3-14: 
Sizing up 
the built-in 
scripts.
 
Tooling Down the Toolbar Highway
Like the menus, Entourage toolbars change while you work. Each window 
has its own set of default toolbar buttons that you can customize, as shown 
in Figure 3-12. The commands that are available at any given moment 
depend on whether you’ve selected a mailbox, a subject, or even the text 
within a message.
If you want to figure out how you can customize the toolbar in Entourage, 
head to Book I, Chapter 3.

Picking Apart the Panes
Picking Apart the Panes
In the following sections, we dig into the panes of the Mail interface. We 
begin our tour on the left side of the interface and then we talk about the 
message list and the preview pane.
Living with the folder list
Take a look at Figure 3-15, where we’ve dissected the left Mail application 
pane. Microsoft calls this the folder list. In the folder list, mailboxes are on 
top. Below the mailboxes, you find newsgroups (read more about them in 
Chapter 4 of this minibook), followed by the very handy Mail views. At the 
bottom, you see a Calendar thumbnail, which you can turn on and off by 
clicking a little button. If you click a date in the calendar, you’re taken to that 
date in Entourage’s Calendar application. We’ve set the triangles to hide our 
mailboxes and to show the Mail views, where we chose to show only high-
priority messages. Notice that you can see our high-priority messages to 
the right in the preview pane. Why do we have high-priority messages in the 
Trash? Uh oh!
Creating a custom Mail view
The Mail Views section comes with a variety of preset views. The default 
Mail views are handy, but you can create your own custom Mail views, as 
shown in Figure 3-16.
Before you begin making your custom Mail views, make sure that Entourage 
is set to show native Entourage search windows, rather than those integrated 
with the Spotlight search contained within Mac OS X. Follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Entourage➪Preferences.
 
2. In the Preferences dialog that appears, select the Spotlight item in the 
left pane.
 
3. Click OK to get back to the Entourage Mail window.
We explain the options in the Preferences dialog in Chapter 2 of this minibook.
Now, you’re ready to create custom Mail views in Entourage — just follow 
these steps:
 
 
1. In the Mail application of Entourage, click the small triangle to the 
right of the New button on the Standard toolbar.

2. From the pop-up menu that appears, choose Saved Search.
 
 If you opened a new e-mail message instead of getting a pop-up menu, 
you missed the little triangle when you clicked. Try again.
 
3. Type a name for your custom view.
 
4. Don’t change any of the Item Types options.
 
 It should default to Messages if you’re in the Entourage Mail application.
 
5. Adjust the search criteria.
 
 The possibilities are nearly endless. Be sure to check out all the avail-
able pop-up menus to see the large number of options available.

6. Click OK.
 
 Your new Mail view appears alphabetically under the Mail Views heading 
in the left pane of the Entourage Mail application. Click your new view to 
watch it in action, as shown in Figure 3-17.
 
 Now, you might want to enable Spotlight searches again within 
Entourage. Reverse the options in the step list earlier in this section.

Now that you know how to make a custom Mail view, you can follow the 
same steps to add new custom views to other Entourage applications. When 
you’re working in the other applications, just follow the same steps (the Item 
Types option automatically changes to the application-specific one). You can 
create new views for any of the following Entourage applications:

✦ Mail
 
✦ Contacts
 
✦ Calendar
 
✦ Tasks
 
✦ Notes
Manipulating the message list
In the section, “Picking a Preview Pane View,” earlier in this chapter, we 
mention that you can control the placement of the message list by using the 
Entourage main menu — simply choose View➪Preview Pane. As it turns out, 
when you choose to view the preview pane On Right (with the message list 
in the middle), you can work with some special options.
Pop-up in the middle
When the message list appears in the middle, you can right-click or Control-
click the Arrange By header. The pop-up menu, as shown in Figure 3-18, 
appears. You can choose to show the messages in groups by toggling the 
Show in Groups setting in the menu.
 
Figure 3-18: 
Determining 
how you 
want to 
arrange the 
message 
list.
 
In addition, you can place the messages in the list in order by using any of 
the criteria, or you can create a custom order. Follow these steps to make 
custom arrangements:
 
1. Right-click or Control-click the Arrange By header.
 
 A pop-up menu appears.

Book V
Chapter 3
Mastering Mail
661
Picking Apart the Panes
 
2. Choose Edit Custom Arrangements from the pop-up menu, as shown 
in Figure 3-18.
 
 An empty Custom Arrangements box appears, as shown in Figure 3-19.
 
Figure 3-19: 
Using

3. Click the big green New button.
 
 The Edit Custom Arrangements pane opens, as shown in Figure 3-20.
 
Figure 3-20:

4. Make any selections you want in the Edit Custom Arrangements pane.
 
 Click plenty of the pop-up menus, just to amaze yourself at the many 
options.
 
5. When you finish setting the custom arrangements options, click OK to 
close the pane.
 
 The next time you right-click or Control-click the Arrangements header 
of the message list, your new custom arrangement is ready to use. While 
you’re in the vicinity, immediately to the right of the Arrange By header, 
you can find a second header labeled Newest on Top. Click that header, 
which is also a button, to reverse the order to Oldest on Top. Click it 
again to reverse the order back to Newest on Top.

662
Picking Apart the Panes
Other preview options
The two preview pane view options Below List and None put the message 
list above the preview pane or give the message list the entire space without 
the preview pane, respectively. (See Figures 3-1 and 3-2.) The following sections 
discuss the options available to you when you use these two arrangements.
Sorting your messages
Headers appear at the top of each column in the message list. If you click 
any of the headers, the messages in the list are reordered based on the 
heading. Click the same header a second time to reverse the sort order. In 
Figure 3-21, the messages are ordered by the date when they were received.
 
Figure 3-21: 
Getting just 
the headers 
you want.
 
Picking the column headers
If you right-click or Control-click any of the headers, a pop-up menu appears, 
as shown in Figure 3-21. You can turn any column header on or off by 
choosing column names from the pop-up menu.
Assigning a category to a message
Select a message from the message list, and then use the keyboard shortcut 
Ô-; (Command and a semicolon). Or you can click the Categories button on 
Entourage’s Standard toolbar. Either method opens the Assign Categories 
pane, as shown in Figure 3-22. You can select more than one category for a 
message. Your categories are probably different than ours. You can assign 
categories to Mail messages, Tasks, Calendar events, and more. We tell you 
how to create your own categories in the following section.
Creating, changing, and deleting categories
Just about everywhere in Entourage, you can use the keyboard shortcut 
Shift-Ô-; (Shift plus Command plus semicolon). You can also click the small 
triangle immediately to the right of the Categories button on the Standard 
toolbar and choose Edit Categories from the pop-up menu. Either method opens 
the Categories box, as shown in Figure 3-23. Here’s how to set up categories:

✦ To add a category, click the New button. A field appears in the list so 
that you can type a category name. To the left of the name, click the 
Color rectangle to display the available colors and then select a color. 
Darker colors work better, although we can’t show you how much better 
they work within the black-and-white Figure 3-23!
 
✦ To delete an existing category, select a category and then click the big 
red Delete button. Be careful with this option, especially if you’re not 
too sure that you want to delete the category.
 
✦ To change the name of an existing category, click the name, wait a 
second or so, and then click the name again. Changing a category 
name works similarly to renaming a file in Mac OS X Finder.
 
Figure 3-23:

You can also assign categories automatically by choosing Tools➪Rules. 
Rules are robust, and we explain how to create rules in Book Chapter 4 of 
this minibook.
Displaying a list of items in a category
You have to wait until after you assign categories to some messages before 
you can use the feature. When you’re ready, use the keyboard shortcut

Shift-Ô-; to open the Categories box, as shown in Figure 3-23. Select a category 
and then click the Related button to produce a listing of all the messages 
that are tagged with the category that you selected. The search result 
window is called Search Results, as shown in Figure 3-24.
 
Figure 3-24:

Right-click or Control-click a header to change the column header. The 
pop-up menu shown in Figure 3-24 appears. Of course, you can click the 
headers to order the columns in the list.
In the Search Results window in Figure 3-24, the Save Search button appears 
on the toolbar. When you click the Save Search button, the Edit Custom View 
dialog appears, prompting you to enter a name for your search so that you 
can make it a custom view. All the Item Types options are selected. If you 
want a new Mail view, deselect all the check boxes except for Messages, 
as indicated in Figure 3-25. Now you know another way to create your own 
custom Mail views!

Understanding Digital Certificates
Understanding Digital Certificates
Uh-oh. We’re getting on our soapbox! Please forgive us. We just want to keep 
you out of trouble. We’ve seen people scan signatures and then insert the 
scanned signatures into documents, especially Microsoft Word documents 
and Entourage Mail messages. Without sounding too alarmist, if you’ve done 
that, we want to scare the wits out of you for having done it. You have our 
immediate forgiveness, and if no one has stolen the signature or created a 
forged document with it, you can consider yourself lucky.
 
If you’re accustomed to putting scanned signatures into documents as an 
indication of authenticity or for any other reason, we have bad news for 
you. It’s incredibly easy for anyone to reuse that signature in a forged 
document. Remember, all it takes to get that signature is to right-click 
and choose Save as Picture! Or use a screen shot. Or take a picture of the sig-
nature with a camera. You’d have a very hard time refuting the authenticity of 
a forged document with your signature on it if you relied on this method for 
authentication. Please don’t use pictures of signatures. Period.
Can you find a free or inexpensive easy way to digitally sign documents? The 
answer is, “No!” You can use a cumbersome, somewhat expensive way — by 
purchasing real digital signing certificates from certificate-issuing authori-
ties, such as Thawte and VeriSign. Plan to spend about $20 each year for 
each computer that a person uses. It works best when both the sender and 
receiver each have his or her own certificate. A digital signing certificate is 
the only way to be assured of a sender’s authenticity and generate a solid 
accountability record that he or she actually sent documents.
Using digital certificates takes training and setup time. They usually cost 
too much for casual communication, but you may find them worth the 
inconvenience for legal, FBI, CIA, NSA, military, security, and law enforcement 
communications, as well as communications in which you need privacy, 
such as with HIPAA–compliant medical communications.
You can find digital certificates difficult to work with when you upgrade 
operating systems or move a user from one computer to another. You can 
get USB devices that allow you temporary use of certificates on a computer, 
but if you lose or break the device, you can’t get to your documents! You 
can’t forward digitally signed e-mail with the signature intact. Don’t expect 
mobile devices to work well with digitally signed e-mail.
After saying all that, we’re happy to tell you that Entourage fully supports 
real digital certificates, but the mechanics of using them aren’t within the 
scope of this book. We recommend that you get a copy of Cryptography For 
Dummies by Chey Cobb (Wiley), which has a section about digital certificates.

Chapter 4: Your Mail Rules 
and Newsgroups
In This Chapter
✓ Filtering junk and keeping the good stuff
✓ Discovering the rules about rules
✓ Keeping things on schedule
✓ Joining the newsgroup community
A
utomating Entourage can save you countless hours and make your 
e-mail workflows manageable. The best part is that you don’t have to 
know any scripting language to take advantage of Entourage’s tremendous 
automation capabilities. Of course, if you do know AppleScript, you can 
extend these capabilities even further. Regardless, you’re sure to be 
pleasantly surprised by how much you can do easily by using Entourage’s 
automation options.
In this chapter, we also show you how you can become part of, read, and 
post to the newsgroup communities from within Entourage.
Sandbagging the Flood of Junk Mail
Everyone hates mail that they didn’t ask for! Unless you’ve lived under a 
rock for the last decade, you know that the electronic version of unsolicited 
mail is spam. Except for the jerks who send it, no one likes spam. Spam 
makes a lot of money for spammers — at least, until they’re caught and sent 
to jail. The folks at Microsoft hate junk mail, too, so they created a Junk Mail 
Filter, affectionately called the JMF by people who deal with it regularly. The 
Entourage JMF on the Mac is the same JMF that’s used in Microsoft Outlook 
in Windows. The JMF is updated regularly at no additional cost through the 
Office Automatic Software Update feature.
You can control certain settings in the JMF. To get at the Entourage JMF, 
in Entourage choose Tools➪Junk E-Mail Protection. The Junk E-Mail 
Protection Wizard, as shown in Figure 4-1, opens. You can find three tabs 
in the JMF Wizard — we explain the options that these tabs offer:

668
Sandbagging the Flood of Junk Mail
 
✦ Levels: We generally use the High setting and find that we don’t lose 
any valid messages. Of course, review your Junk Mail folder often to see 
whether some genuine mail has slipped through the filter. As shown in 
Figure 4-1, we allow ourselves 30 days to review our junk mail before it’s 
permanently deleted.
 
Figure 4-1: 
Adjusting 
the junk mail 
protection 
level.
 
 
 If you need to receive messages from strangers, perhaps the High setting 
is too aggressive. In that case, you just have to deal with more junk 
mail. On the other hand, maybe you can be even more selective about 
what messages you allow to get through. Entourage offers the Exclusive 
option. Use this setting to be tough on spam. Only messages that you’ve 
given clearance can reach you.
 
✦ Safe Domains: Click the Safe Domains tab to enter Internet domains that 
you consider to be okay so that messages from these domains don’t get 
flagged as junk mail. A domain is the part of the e-mail address after the 
@ sign, such as microsoft.com or verizon.net. Enter your trusted 
domains in the Safe Domains pane and separate them with commas, as 
shown in Figure 4-2.
 
Figure 4-2: 
Giving the 
green light 
to safe 
domains.
 

Book V
Chapter 4
Your Mail Rules 
and Newsgroups
669
Building Mailing List Rules
 
✦ Blocked Senders: The Blocked Senders pane lets you banish messages 
from the scum and flotsam of the Internet. You enter domains the same 
way that you do with Safe Domains (see Figure 4-2). The effect, however, is 
the opposite. The mail from domains that you put into Blocked Senders 
is automatically flagged as junk.
Building Mailing List Rules
The Exclusive setting of the Junk Mail Filter mentions mailing list rules. 
Entourage allows you to create specific rules concerning how e-mail will be 
handled when it arrives from mailing lists. In the preceding section, we 
mention that we use the High setting for the Junk Mail Filter. But at the High 
setting, the JMF marks messages as junk that come from a ListServ we 
subscribe to. To solve this problem, we can create a mailing list rule.
To create a mailing list rule, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Tools➪Mailing List Manager.
 
 An empty Mailing List Manager pane opens the first time you make this 
choice.
 
2. Click the New button to open the Edit Mailing List Rule pane.
 
 The Mailing List Manager and the Mailing List tab of the Edit Mailing List 
Rule pane are shown in Figure 4-3.
 
Figure 4-3: 
Creating a 
new mailing 
list rule.
 
 
3. Click either the Mailing List tab or the Advanced tab depending on 
what you want to do.

670
Ruling the Roost
 
 The following two tabs appear on the Edit Mailing List Rule pane:
 
• Mailing List: As shown in Figure 4-3, we want to get the messages 
from the ListServ to our Inbox before the Junk Mail Filter has a 
chance to send them to their doom.
 
• Advanced: If you click the Advanced tab, you can get specific about 
various aspects of messages sent from mailing lists (see Figure 4-4).
 
Before we forget to mention it, to edit an existing rule, double-click the rule 
name in the Mailing List Manager. To delete a rule, select its name and then 
click the big, red Delete button.
 
Figure 4-4: 
Dealing with 
advanced 
mailing list 
rules.
 
Ruling the Roost
Among the most powerful features of Entourage is the ability to automatically 
apply rules to incoming and outbound e-mail messages. These Mail rules are 
different from the Mailing List rules we explain in the preceding section — 
these rules apply to regular e-mails that you receive, rather than the ones 
you receive from mailing list subscriptions.
You can apply rules simply, but you have plenty of power to create complex 
sets of rules if you want them. We want to help you by explaining the rules about 
using rules. To get started, we choose Tools➪Rules. The Rules pane opens, 
which is where Entourage stores the rules that you make (see Figure 4-5).

Book V
Chapter 4
Your Mail Rules 
and Newsgroups
671
Ruling the Roost
 
Figure 4-5: 
Creating, 
storing, 
and editing 
rules.
 
Rules about rules
When you first open the Rules pane, it’s empty. Figure 4-5 shows two rules, 
and we show you how to create your rules in just a bit. Before we get to that, 
you need to look at the six tabs in the Rules pane. Entourage offers different 
sets of rules to you, depending on which tab you pick. To select the proper 
tab(s), you need to know what kind e-mail server your e-mail account(s) use.
In the example in Figure 4-5, we show rules that we want to apply to our 
IMAP e-mail account. Rules that we make on the IMAP tab don’t apply to 
any other e-mail account types — such as POP, Windows Live, Hotmail, or 
Exchange — that we may have set up. The News tab is for rules that apply to 
newsgroup messages, a topic we cover in the section, “Connecting to World 
Communities by Using Newsgroups,” later in this chapter. The Outgoing tab 
lets you apply rules to outbound messages. The rest of the tabs that we 
mention earlier in this paragraph deal with incoming messages.
Rules are applied first at the top of each list and then in sequence while you 
go down the list. You can create a lot of rules, but you should think about 
them thoroughly and carefully. You can change the order in which the rules 
are applied by selecting a rule and then clicking the up- or down-arrow 
buttons located toward the right end of the Rules toolbar.
Making rules
You might have heard the old adage about rules being made to be broken. 
However, Entourage is quite serious about any rules you create — no rules 
are broken! You can use rules to categorize your mail messages in an orderly 
fashion. The following steps show a rule that we made, which says anything 
that comes from a coauthor of this book becomes tagged with a category we 
call Book.
 
You can save yourself some typing by knowing this secret. If you’re going to 
make a rule that involves a particular subject or person, start by selecting a 
message in one of your message lists that contains the subject of interest — 
or is to or from the person of interest. Entourage prefills some of the fields 
for you. Keep this tip in mind and use the following steps to make a rule:

672
Ruling the Roost
 
1. In any message list, select a message from the person whom you want 
to make the rule about.
 
 In this case, we click a message from one of the coauthors of this book.
 
2. Choose Tools➪Rules.
 
 The Rules pane opens in all its glory (we show you part of that interface 
in Figure 4-5).
 
3. On the Rules toolbar, click the New button.
 
 The Edit Rule pane, as shown in Figure 4-6, opens. This pane is divided 
into two main sections: The top half is the If section that contains 
criteria; the bottom half is the Then section that contains actions to 
perform when the criteria are met (again, see Figure 4-6).
 
Figure 4-6: 
Making our 
first rule.
 
 
4. At the top of the pane, in the Rule Name field, type a name for the 
new rule.
 
 We’re calling our example rule Categorize as Book.
 
 Because you selected a message from the list in Step 1, Entourage 
prefills the From criterion, so you don’t have to change it.
 
 You can type or paste information into the criteria fields. In Figure 4-6, 
we’ve blanked out the coauthor’s e-mail address, but you should be able 
to see the From address of the e-mail you selected if you’re following 
these steps with us.

6. Deselect the Do Not Apply Other Rules to Messages That Meet These 
Criteria check box.
 
 We might want to apply additional rules to messages from this coauthor. 
If we leave the check box selected, Entourage doesn’t apply any additional 
rules to messages from the coauthor.
 
7. Make sure that the Enabled check box is selected.
 
 If you deselect this box, the rule remains in the list of rules but won’t be 
executed. You may find temporarily disabling a rule handy when you 
test a sequence of rules. You can run tests to see how your rules are 
interacting with each other.
You can add and remove criteria from the If section easily with the Add 
Criterion and Remove Criterion buttons. If you have more than one criterion, 
be sure to think about the setting you have in the Execute pop-up field. As 
shown in Figure 4-7, the choices for Execute are
 
✦ If Any Criteria Are Met: The rule executes when one or more criteria 
are met.
 
✦ If All Criteria Are Met: The rule executes only when all criteria are met.
 
✦ Unless Any Criteria Are Met: The rule executes only when no criteria 
are met.
 
✦ Unless All Criteria Are Met: The rule executes until all criteria are met.
 
Figure 4-7: 
Triggers for 
executing a 
rule.
 
When you make rules, click the pop-up buttons to see what kinds of com-
binations are possible. Start at the top of the Edit Rule pane and work your 
way down, moving from left to right in each subsection of the pane. Start 
with If criteria; then, examine the possible actions. The last action in the 
pop-up list is to run AppleScript. With that possibility, you can automate 
anything that’s AppleScript-able based on an action from a rule.
While you look at the Edit Rule pane, you can almost read your rule settings 
as sentences. The rule in Figure 4-6 says, “For the rule named Categorize as 
Book, if any message is from mycoauthor@isp.com, change the message’s 
status so that it’s not junk and change the category to Book.” Thinking 
through your rules this way may help you more easily create and manage 
them.

674
Keeping on Schedule
Keeping on Schedule
Entourage does things all by itself, such as performing send- and receive-mail 
operations, every so often. If you look in the lower-right corner of the Mail 
application window, you can even see a message that tells you when the 
next send-and-receive operation will occur. Although this is the default 
setting, you can easily change it. Not only that, but you can also create 
schedules for other Entourage functions.
Choose Tools➪Schedules to summon a pane similar to what you can see in 
Figure 4-8. We’ve scheduled Send & Receive All Mail to run every nine 
minutes. Naturally, we don’t expect you to do the same; we just want to 
make you aware of how you can adjust these settings.
 
Figure 4-8: 
Viewing 
existing 
schedules.
 
To edit an existing rule, double-click its name, which opens the Edit 
Schedule pane. You can see our Send & Receive All schedule setting in 
full detail in Figure 4-9.
 
Figure 4-9: 
Adjusting 
the default 
send-and-
receive 
interval.
 
Microsoft made the Edit Schedule pane similar in logic and design to the Rules 
pane: It’s divided into When and Action sections. You can have multiple entries 
in both sections of the pane. Figure 4-10 shows the options for a timed schedule 
and the actions that are possible. With a timed schedule, you can specify any 
number of specific times on the quarter-hour. Actions that are available include 
running AppleScripts and automating publication of Excel Web pages.

Connecting to World Communities 
by Using Newsgroups
Newsgroups are like electronic bulletin boards. Instead of posting paper 
notes, people can place e-mail messages into public forums that are hosted 
on newsgroup servers. Microsoft offers free public newsgroups on its 
newsgroup servers as a service to its customers so that they can communicate 
with each other regarding topics relating to Microsoft products. You don’t 
have to pay a charge to gain access to these newsgroups, and the support 
you get is often quick and first-rate.
 
To protect your e-mail account from getting spam, we recommend that 
before you post any messages to a newsgroup, you first create a new 
identity in Mac OS X for the express purpose of connecting to newsgroups. 
We explain how to create new identities in Chapter 2 of this minibook. If 
you use a different identity, you can use a From e-mail address that doesn’t 
include your real e-mail address. Unfortunately, spammers scan newsgroups 
for e-mail addresses, so we highly recommend that you create a fake address 
to be used with your new identity, as shown in Figure 4-11.
If you want to fetch newsgroups, look for the Microsoft News Server 
(as shown in Figure 4-12) in the folder list of Entourage’s Mail interface. 
Entourage is preconfigured to connect to the proper server, so you don’t 
have to do any setup.

you’re using a dialup connection.
After you receive the entire list of newsgroups, you can quickly find the 
newsgroups directly related to Microsoft Office for Mac (see Figure 4-15). To 
find them, follow these steps:
 
1. Type mac in the Display Newsgroups Containing filter box.

5. Click the folder for each group, one by one in succession, as shown in 
Figure 4-16.
 
 While you click, Entourage checks with the news server and downloads 
the subjects within each news feed. How fast this happens depends on 
your Internet connection speed. Each group name becomes bold, and 
the number of unread messages appears. You can see the subjects fill in.
By default, Entourage displays the messages within each group by order 
of the date and time they were posted to the newsgroup. You may need to 
change that setting to make sense of the news feed. Follow these steps:
 
1. At the top of the column that contains all the subjects, click the header

questions. You can also create your own, new subject threads. Use the 
Entourage Message menu to mark all messages as read. When you come 
back to Entourage newsgroups, click the triangle next to Microsoft News 
Server twice to refresh the contents of the newsgroups. The new messages 
are highlighted automatically for you. The View menu lets you limit the 
display to unread messages.
Before you start a new subject, we suggest that you search Google Groups 
to make sure that your question hasn’t already been answered. You can find 
Google Groups at http://groups.google.com.
When you search Google Groups, you can use keywords such as Word, 
Excel, PowerPoint, and Entourage, coupled with Mac and any search terms 
you think may help you find information about the topic you’re interested in.

Chapter 5: Personalizing Your PIM
In This Chapter
✓ Looking over the Address Book

✓ Using directory services
I
n Entourage, PIM stands for Personal Information Manager. PIM is the 
feature that lets you keep track of the people and organizations that 
are most important in your life. Entourage calls its PIM application the 
Entourage Address Book. Other programs call it Contacts or Contact 
Manager. In the Address Book, you keep personal information about people 
and businesses, and store the kind of private information about contacts 
that doesn’t appear on their Facebook, LinkedIn, or MySpace pages, such as 
phone numbers and what you gave them on their birthday.
Perusing the Address Book Interface
To get to the Entourage Address Book, just click the Address Book button 
on the Standard toolbar while you’re using any Entourage application. The 
Address Book layout is similar to the layout of the Entourage Mail application 
(which we talk about in Chapter 3 of this minibook), as shown in Figure 5-1. 
Menus appear across the top, and each window has its own toolbar. The 
main view has a pane on the left that lets you choose from your Address 
Book, LDAP (we talk about LDAP in the section, “Using LDAP Directory 
Services,” later in this chapter), customized mail views, and the handy little 
calendar. You can resize the panes by dragging the dividers that separate 
them.

Meeting Yourself
The first time you open Address Book, only one contact appears in your 
contacts list. As it turns out, that particular contact is very special. Only one 
contact can be what Entourage calls the Me contact. You can think of the Me 
contact as the owner of all the other contacts and groups of contacts in the 
Address Book.
Filling in the information for the Me contact is a great way to get started 
building your contact list. The Me contact has a special purple icon. Double-
click the Me contact in the list to open the contact (see Figure 5-2). Your Me 
contact opens on an almost empty Summary tab. You need to go through 
each of the tabs and fill in the blanks with your own information. (You can 
skip the Certificates tab until someone sends you a digitally signed message.)

Adding Friends and Associates
After you fill in your own contact information for the Me contact (as we 
describe in the preceding section), start adding contacts. Here are the two 
most common ways:
 
✦ Add a contact from a mail message. Select a mail message in Entourage 
Mail and choose Message➪Add to Address Book. Alternatively, you can 
right-click or Control-click a message and select Add to Address Book 
from the pop-up menu that appears. The keyboard shortcut to add a 
contact is Alt-Ô-C. Using any of these three methods adds a new contact 
so that you can begin filling in the contact’s information.
 
✦ Add a contact while using the Address Book. If you click the New 
button on the Standard toolbar, Entourage gets you started with a new 
contact by using an abridged Create Contact form for inputting contact 
information, as shown in Figure 5-3. You can display the full input screen 
(as shown in Figure 5-2) by clicking the More button at the bottom of the 
abridged version.
 
When you get to the Personal tab of the full version of the Create Contact 
form, you don’t necessarily have to add a picture of your contact to the 
Address Book. You can drag clip art or another picture into the pane. 
Whatever picture you use appears in the message window whenever you 
receive a message from that contact.

686

Managing Your Contacts
While you add contacts, your contacts list grows (see Figure 5-4). The 
more contacts you add, the more interesting this feature becomes. You can 
decide what information to display by right-clicking or Control-clicking any 
of the column headings. An enormous pop-up menu appears. Selected items 
appear as headers in the message list. Select a header name in the menu 
to turn that header on in the message list. Select the same header name a 
second time in the menu to turn it off in the message list. To place entries in 
your list in order, click the column header you want to use for ordering the 
entries. A second click reverses the order. In the Name Contains field, you 
can enter keywords to filter the list of your contacts. The Name Contains 
pop-up menu has additional filtering choices.

Managing Your Contacts
Finding contacts
You can search your contacts list in a variety of ways. We think the most 
efficient is to simply press Ô-F to open the Find pane, as shown in Figure 
5-7. Clicking the More Options button enables you to be a bit more specific 
about what you want in your search.
 
If you can’t see the dialog that we show in Figure 5-7, Entourage is using 
Spotlight (the search technology built inside Mac OS X), rather than its 
own search options. To make Entourage use its own search, choose 
Entourage➪Preferences and select the Spotlight option in the left pane of 
the Entourage Preferences dialog that appears. Then, deselect both the 
check boxes and click OK. Want to restore Spotlight as the search engine in 
Entourage? Just reverse the process!
 
Figure 5-7: 
Digging 
through 
your

list.
 
Creating a custom view for a contact
When you conduct a contacts search (as we describe in the preceding 
section), the result of your search is presented in a Search Results pane 
(see Figure 5-8). Among the buttons on the Search Results toolbar is Save 
Search. Click this button to open the Edit Custom View pane, also shown in 
Figure 5-8. Enter a name for the view in the Name field, and then click the 
OK button. The new view is added to the Custom Views section of the main 
Address Book window of Entourage.
Grouping contacts
You can easily create groups of contacts. If you create a group, you can 
send a message to the entire group by entering the name of the group when 
addressing an e-mail or invitation, instead of having to add people to an 
address block individually. Follow these steps to create a group of contacts:
 
1. Open the Entourage Address Book and click the small triangle to the 
right of the New button on the Standard toolbar in the main window.
 
 The pop-up menu, as shown in Figure 5-9, opens.
 
2. Choose Group.
 
 The Group Manager opens.

 It’s good etiquette to select the Don’t Show Addresses When Sending

contacts to a group:
 
• Click the Add button on the Group Manager’s toolbar. Then, type the 
name of each contact you want to add to the group.
 
• Drag contacts from the contacts list into the Group Manager.

Managing Your Contacts
Exporting contacts
In the Export Wizard (which you can access by choosing File➪Export 
Wizard), you can click the Save button to save your contacts as a Comma 
Separated Values (.csv) file, which creates a file that Excel can open (see 
Figure 5-11). Additionally, you can export individual contacts as vCard files 
by dragging them from the Address Book into Finder.
 
Figure 5-11: 
Exporting 
contacts as

Mapping contacts
When you have a contact open, look for little buttons to click. For example, 
you can get directions to a contact, or even instantly get a map of a contact’s 
work or home address, depending on which tab you select. In Figure 5-12, we 
clicked the button to the right of the address block to open the pop-up menu 
that lets us accomplish these feats.

Addressing Mail and Invitations
Creating custom fields
Scattered throughout each contact, you can find some fields that have 
custom labels on them. You can rename these fields and use them for any 
kind of data about your contacts that you want. On the Other tab, you can 
even customize two fields specifically related to dates for a contact.
To name (or rename) a custom field, just click the existing name. A small 
Edit Custom Label dialog appears (see Figure 5-13). This dialog allows you to 
type a new name for the field.
 
Figure 5-13:

Deleting contacts
Sadly, at times, you must delete a contact. To delete an existing contact, 
simply select the contact in the contacts list, and then click the Delete 
button on the toolbar or press the Delete key.
Addressing Mail and Invitations
Time to discuss the various ways of entering addresses into address blocks. 
Keep in mind that Chapters 1 through 4 of this minibook offer additional 
information on addressing messages.
Sending from the Address Book
All the windows in Address Book that show contacts allow you to select one 
or more contacts. You can use Mac OS X standard selection methods. Hold 
down the Ô key while you click individual names to send to multiple 
recipients. After you make your selection(s), click either the E-Mail button 
or the Invitation button on the toolbar to open a preaddressed message.

692
Addressing Mail and Invitations
Sending a new message or invitation
You can very easily send a message or invitation. Whenever you’re in 
Entourage, you can start a new message or invitation from the File menu and 
various New buttons in the interface. When you do that, you’re presented 
with a message header that has no addresses in it.
Addressing automatically
Your instinct to start typing either the intended recipient’s name or e-mail 
address into the heading fields is correct. While you type, Entourage 
searches through all the following options, and it instantly offers to auto-
complete the address for you:
 
✦ Names and addresses stored in your Address Book
 
✦ The most recent 300 or so sent or received names and addresses
 
✦ Group names that you’ve created in your Address Book
 
✦ Directory services (if you’ve configured one or more directory services)
 
✦ Exchange directory (if you’re on a Microsoft Exchange server)
Entourage has a lot of e-mail names and addresses to check on the fly, yet 
it does this check so fast you don’t even notice. It’s truly amazing. The 
auto-complete results appear in a special drop-down list that has matching 
results grouped by their source (see Figure 5-14). The top group shows 
addresses from your contacts, groups, and recently received and sent e-mail 
addresses. The lower group shows matches from directory services. Watch 
while the group results become more focused with each letter that you type.

Book V
Chapter 5
Personalizing 
Your PIM
693
Addressing Mail and Invitations
But what if you can’t remember the name or e-mail address of a contact, 
even enough for auto-complete? Entourage comes to the rescue! To the 
right of the input field, you can use the Address Book lookup to search your 
Address Book right in the same box that you use to address messages. You 
can even search directory services from the same pane. Not only that; after 
you find the contact you’re looking for, you can simply drag the contact 
into the address field or double-click names to add them to an address field! 
Figure 5-15 shows the Address Book lookup in action.
 
Figure 5-15:

Not only can you drag contacts into the address block, but you can also 
drag them into the general e-mail message area. If you do, Entourage turns 
the contact information into a vCard and attaches it to the mail message. 
A vCard is like an electronic calling card. You can send and receive vCards 
as a method to share contacts. If you receive a message that has a vCard 
attached, you can add the contact to your Address Book by double-clicking 
the vCard attachment.
Using address blocks
In every address area, you can choose from three blocks. Find out how each 
one works so that you don’t accidentally violate someone’s privacy:
 
✦ To: Every contact added to the To block receives your message, and 
each recipient can see the name and address of all the To and CC 
recipients.
 
✦ CC (carbon copy): Every contact added to the CC block receives your 
message, and each recipient can see the name and address of all the To 
and CC recipients.
 
✦ BCC (blind carbon copy): Every contact added to the BCC block 
receives your message. Recipients added to BCC aren’t visible to other 
recipients.

694
Using LDAP Directory Services
Using LDAP Directory Services
Entourage is very smart when it comes to using an Internet standard called 
LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol, in case you’re curious). Many 
organizations put their members into LDAP address books, which Entourage 
can search. Think of LDAP as an online, accessible equivalent of a telephone 
directory — except that an LDAP can store more information than names 
and telephone numbers. Of course, large businesses typically use LDAP, not 
home users.
Before you can use an LDAP service, you need to know what settings to use 
— your LDAP server administrator supplies those settings. If you don’t know 
whether your organization has LDAP support, contact your help desk or IT 
department. Setting up LDAP in Entourage is worth the small bother if your 
organization offers LDAP.
Setting up an LDAP account
To enable a directory service, choose Tools➪Accounts. In the Accounts 
pane, click the Directory Service tab, and then click the New button to open 
the Account Setup Assistant (see Figure 5-16). Usually, you have to click the 
Configure Account Manually button because LDAP servers often have special 
settings that need to be entered. See Figure 5-17 for a look at the manual 
settings.
 
Figure 5-16: 
Using the 
Setup 
Assistant 
to create 
an LDAP 
account.
 
Using directory services
After you set up an LDAP directory service, Entourage starts using it 
automatically to offer address suggestions when you address e-mail 
messages. You can also search the LDAP directory directly from within 
Entourage by following these steps (see Figure 5-18):

3. Enter a directory search term.
 
 If you pause even for a moment, you might find that Entourage may have 
retrieved too many records, so you may have to type quickly in this 
field.

Use an asterisk (*) as a wild card when doing directory searches. If you 
don’t know exactly how someone’s name was entered into a directory, you 
can use an asterisk to make your search a little easier. For example, use only 
parts of a name, such as FirstName*LastName. This way, you won’t have 
to worry about not finding names that have middle initials or hyphenated 
names. You can use the asterisk in the beginning, middle, or end of a search 
string.

C
locks, dates, and calendars are items we almost always take for 
granted, yet they’re amazingly intricate timekeepers that have a 
significant place in our daily lives. Fortunately, Entourage makes it easy 
for you to stay organized. Even if you travel, Entourage can keep your 
appointments straight while you go from one time zone to another. Do you 
live in a Daylight Saving Time area? No problem; let Entourage take care of 
those small details!
We start this chapter with a completely blank Calendar, just like you see the 
first time you open the Entourage Calendar application. Then, you can see 
how easily you can fill in events and manage your time. Using Entourage 
Calendar is quick, easy, and logical. In fact, it wouldn’t surprise us that after 
you incorporate using your Entourage Calendar into your everyday activities, 
you’ll be wondering how you got along without it.
Taking a Look at the Interface
When you click the Calendar button on Entourage’s Standard toolbar for the 
first time, your Calendar is a blank slate, ready for you to start filling it. You 
find plenty of different views to the Calendar. We decided to click the Month 
button of the Calendar Standard toolbar for Figure 6-1. You can click the 
Browse buttons to switch from one month to another, and you can click the 
View Date button to go to any specific date in another month. The views get 
more interesting after you add some events.
You can modify the way the interface looks considerably by choosing 
Calendar➪List. The List view shows only your existing Calendar events, so it 
could be empty if you haven’t already made some. Also, you can display the 
To Do List in the same window as the Calendar by choosing Calendar➪To 
Do List.

Going on Holiday
Our Calendar definitely needs to have some events added to it. It’s so bare! 
We put holidays into the Calendar as a way to get started. Entourage has an 
Import Wizard that comes to our aid. To use it, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪Import.
 
 Step 1 of the Import Wizard, as shown in Figure 6-2, opens.

2. Select the Holidays option.
 
3. Click the right arrow to advance to the next step.
 
4. In Step 2 of the wizard, also shown in Figure 6-2, select one or more 
countries or religions to add their holidays to the Calendar.
 
 In our example, we chose the following groups of holidays:
 
• India (for Geetesh)
 
• United States (for Jim)
 
• Canada (for Jim because he lives 15 minutes from Canada)
 
• Christian Religious Holidays (for you, so that we can let you know 
that it’s one of the choices)
 
5. Click the right arrow to continue.
 
6. Click OK on the confirmation message and click the Finish button to 
exit the wizard.
One of the benefits of having friends in different countries is that you get to 
celebrate more holidays!
Adding Calendar Events
You can add events to your Calendar by using several options. We start with 
the ways you can initiate Calendar events. In the section, “Enhancing an 
Event,” later in this chapter, we discuss ways that you can share events with 
other people.
Say that you have an event that you need to add to your Calendar. For 
example, if you plan to attend a committee meeting on Friday, November 6 
at 9:00 a.m., you can add it to your Calendar. To add events to your Calendar, 
follow these steps:
 
1. For the purpose of this exercise, choose an event date several months 
in the future.
 
 To quickly advance to a future (or past) date, click the View Date button 
on the Calendar’s Standard toolbar.
 
 If your event is going to occur in the timeframe that already appears in 
the Calendar window, you can skip directly to Step 3 and start there.
 
2. Click the little button next to the input field to choose a date from the 
pop-up calendar, as shown in Figure 6-3, or type a date into the field. 
Then, click OK to show that date in the Calendar.

3. Open the New Event pane (as shown in Figure 6-4).
 
 To open this pane, do either of the following:
 
• If you’re in Month, Week, or Work Week view, double-click the date of 
the event.
 
• If you’re in Day view, double-click in the day’s view at the time of the 
event.

Notes
While you add event details, when you type the subject into the New Event 
pane, the subject becomes the title of the pane. Also, when you enter event 
dates and times, you can either type your information into the fields or use 
the buttons to the right of the fields to select from pop-up menus.

701
Enhancing an Event
 
If you want a little reminder to appear on your screen before the event, 
select the Reminder check box and then set the amount of time you want to 
be reminded prior the event. You can add travel time, if need be. We go into 
detail about reminders in Chapter 7 of this minibook.
Entering notes about the event is always a good thing. As you can see from 
Figure 6-4, you can right-click or Control-click words that have red underlines 
to get the spell checker to offer suggestions in a pop-up menu — just like it 
does in Word 2008!
When you finish adjusting the event settings and making entries, click the 
red Close button or use the Ô-W keyboard shortcut. Closing the window 
signifies that you’re done editing and ready to have Entourage add the event 
to the Calendar. When you close the New Event window, you receive one of 
those pesky “Are you sure?” type of prompts, as shown in Figure 6-5. Select 
the Always Save Changes without Asking check box if you find this sort of 
prompt annoying. Congratulations! You have now successfully saved the 
event to your Calendar.
 
Figure 6-5: 
Ending 
a pesky 
prompt.
 
 
You can add events by simply typing in the Entourage Calendar view. Just 
click a time and start typing. You can adjust the time of your new event (or 
any other event) by dragging the event’s border in the Calendar. Dragging 
to move an event seems to work best in Day, Week, and Work Week views. If 
you have a large monitor, it might work fine in Month view, as well.
Enhancing an Event
As luck would have it, your boss decided that you’re now in charge of the 
budget meeting, and you need to invite the committee members to attend. 
Not only that; rather than just one meeting, you need to hold a meeting each 
Friday for three consecutive weeks. Entourage makes this task easy! Simply 
open the existing event in your Calendar, modify the event, invite the com-
mittee, and then save the changes. The following sections detail what you 
need to do.
Opening an existing event
To edit your event, reopen the event’s window — just double-click the event 
in the Calendar.

702
Enhancing an Event
Creating a recurring event
When you saved the meeting the first time, you set the event to occur just 
once, which is Entourage’s default setting for Calendar events. Refer to 
Figure 6-4 — the Occurs setting is Once Only. You need to change that setting. 
To let Entourage know that this event occurs more than once, click the 
pop-up button next to the Occurs field. The choices offered by the pop-up 
menu are shown in Figure 6-6.
 
Figure 6-6: 
Choosing 
a recurring 
schedule.
 
The options offered are intuitive, and you can remember them for the future. 
If they work for you, that’s great. In a situation where none of these options 
may be exactly what you’re looking for, you need more options, so choose 
Custom on the pop-up menu. The Recurring Event window, as shown in 
Figure 6-7, opens so that you can establish a customized event schedule.
 
Figure 6-7: 
Setting a 
recurring 
event.
 
You can find millions of possible combinations in the Recurring Event pane, 
but the settings that work for our particular event are illustrated in Figure 
6-7. The arrangement is logical from left to right and top to bottom within 
the Recurring Event pane. When you choose the Daily, Weekly, Monthly, or 
Yearly options in the Recurrence Pattern section, the entire pane’s options 
are updated to offer appropriate choices for each pattern.
Inviting others to an event
You might not expect this, but Entourage can assist you with your manners. 
You should follow a certain protocol to be polite when sending invitations. 
You, as the event organizer, create an event and then invite potential attendees. 

Book V
Chapter 6
Crafting Your 
Calendar
703
Enhancing an Event
Each attendee receives an invitation. If the invitee so desires, she can accept 
your invitation. What’s nice is that all this happens electronically, without a 
lot of fuss.
It’s time to send invitations to the committee members for your budget 
meetings. To get the invitations rolling, in the New Event pane (refer to 
Figure 6-4), click the Invite button on the event’s toolbar. Entourage opens 
the Address block field so that you can invite the committee members. In 
Figure 6-8, we created a Budget Committee group, so we don’t have to enter 
each person individually. If you want to create your own group, instead of 
adding individual contacts, you can click the Cancel Invite button to cancel 
the invitation (see Figure 6-8). We explain how to create groups in Chapter 5 
of this minibook.
 
Figure 6-8: 
Sending (or 
canceling) 
invitations.
 
After you add invitees to an event, you can then add attachments to the 
invitation. These can be the same kinds of attachments that you’d send with 
an e-mail message. In this example, you might want to attach documents 
that you plan to discuss at the meeting. Before you can add attachments, 
you need to click the small disclosure triangle next to Attachments in the 
Calendar event, as shown in Figure 6-9.
 
Figure 6-9: 
Adding 
attachments 
to an 
invitation.
 Click triangle.

704
Enhancing an Event
Thereafter, click the Add button at the bottom of this pane to include an 
attachment. Clicking the Send Now button on the toolbar sends your 
invitations via e-mail to the committee members. We explain what happens 
after you send the invitations in the section, “Receiving Acceptances and 
Rejections,” later in this chapter. You might want to do some additional 
things while still in the meeting window.
Changing your status
You can change your status by clicking the Status button on the toolbar. For 
the time being, if you’re not sure whether everyone who was invited can 
attend, set your status to Tentative. When the plans are finalized, you can 
change your status to Busy or Out of Office (see Figure 6-10).
 
Figure 6-10: 
Changing 
your status.
 
Assigning categories
When you click the Categories button, you can assign categories to your 
event. In Chapter 3 of this minibook, we explain how to work with categories. 
By using the Categories button, when you assign categories to a Calendar 
event, the category assignments aren’t transmitted with invitations.
Linking to other things
Although you usually have a variety of activities going on in Entourage, you 
don’t have much to look at in the Links pane. After you reach a certain level 
of activity, you’ll find some interesting functions when you click the Links 
button. In this case, you might have a report that you’re planning to present 
at the meeting. You can link the event to that report or to any other existing 
file, as shown in Figure 6-11. Just click the To Existing button on the Links 
toolbar.

event to a

Receiving Invitations
Receiving Invitations
In the section, “Inviting others to an event,” earlier in this chapter, you sent 
event invitations to committee members. Now, you can see what your 
invitees see in Entourage when they receive invitations. When you receive 
an invitation in Entourage Mail, you open it the same way that you open any 
other Mail message. Double-click an invitation to open it in its own window, 
as shown in Figure 6-12. As you can see from the figure, Entourage is very 
smart when it comes to handling invitations. Because Entourage knows this 
message is an invitation, the toolbar offers various options that specifically 
deal with invitations. Immediately below the toolbar, you can see a 
notification advising you that you haven’t yet acted on this invitation.
 
Figure 6-12: 
Opening an 
invitation.
 
Accepting an invitation
If a recipient elects to accept the meeting, he clicks the Accept button on 
the invitation’s toolbar. Entourage then offers to alert the sender of the 
invitation that the invitee plans to attend (see Figure 6-13).
 
Figure 6-13: 
Deciding 
on an 
acceptance 
response 
to the 
organizer.
 

706
Receiving Invitations
Accepting with comments
In this example, we chose to accept the invitation and to send comments 
along with our acceptance. Because we chose this option, Entourage opens 
a new window that lets us send additional information in a special Accepted 
mail message, as shown in Figure 6-14.
 
Figure 6-14: 
Accepting 
with 
comments.
 
Click the Send button to send your reply with comments. When the event’s 
organizer receives this reply, the organizer’s copy of Entourage automatically 
tabulates the replies and builds a list of attendees. Entourage also adds the 
event to the invitee’s Entourage Calendar, and the invitee’s status is set to 
Busy for the period used by the event.
Accepting without comments
This option is basically the same as Accepting with Comments, except you 
don’t send comments along with the reply. If you select this option, a special 
acceptance e-mail message is sent to the event’s organizer indicating you 
can attend.
Accepting with no response
If an invitee chooses this option, Entourage adds the event to the invitee’s 
Calendar, and the invitee’s status for the period is changed to Busy. However, 
the event organizer receives no response.
Tentatively accepting an invitation
An invitee can accept an invitation tentatively by clicking the Tentative 
button on the toolbar (refer back to Figure 6-12). The mechanics work the 
same as with a full acceptance (see the section, “Accepting an invitation,” 
earlier in this chapter), except the invitee’s status flag is set to Tentative, 
rather than Busy, for the event.

Book V
Chapter 6
Crafting Your 
Calendar
707
Receiving Acceptances and Rejections
Declining an invitation
When an invitee declines an invitation by clicking the Decline button on the 
toolbar (refer to Figure 6-12), the event isn’t added to the invitee’s Calendar. 
Entourage offers the same three response options to those who decline as 
it does to those who accept (see Figure 6-15), which we talk about in the sec-
tion, “Accepting an invitation,” earlier in this chapter.
 
Figure 6-15: 
Options for 
declining an 
invitation.
 
 
Entourage can work with invites you receive from others who use a program 
other than Entourage. Outlook for Windows users have the same options 
available for sending and receiving invites as Entourage users, and generally, 
you can work similarly with invites from other non-Microsoft programs, such 
as Apple Mail, and even open source programs, such as Thunderbird and 
Sunbird.
Receiving Acceptances and Rejections
When the event organizer receives an acceptance or rejection notice, 
Entourage places a notification below the toolbar of the invitee’s response. 
In this example, we accepted the invitation. As shown in Figure 6-16, the 
organizer can click the Show Attendee Status link to display a list of the 
attendees and their responses. The same link also appears in the event’s 
window if the organizer opens it in a Calendar view.
 
Figure 6-16: 
Opening an 
invitation 
response.
 
 
Although the Attendee Status window is on the plain side, it has a little 
secret. The event organizer has some extra control, so if you’re the event 
organizer, you can use this control in case someone changes her mind — and 
tells you without using an Accept or Reject Calendar message. People often 
accept an invitation over the phone, or even in the office corridor! You need 
to input that acceptance into Entourage. Just click the response from an 

708
Changing Your Mind
attendee (even if she hasn’t given a response yet), and manually change the 
response. Even though the responses don’t look like buttons, they turn into 
buttons after you click them (see Figure 6-17).
 
Figure 6-17: 
Changing 
a response 
manually.
 
Changing Your Mind
Things change. Event invitees and organizers can change their minds 
about events, and Entourage is very accommodating about these changes. 
Whether you’re the organizer or an invitee, when you double-click an 
existing event in the Calendar, the event window opens. You can make 
changes to the event or even delete it.
If the organizer of an event that already has invitees makes changes to 
that event, when he saves the changes, Entourage asks whether to send an 
update to the invitees.
When an invitee makes changes to an event in his own Calendar and saves 
those changes, Entourage cautions the invitee that his changes aren’t going 
to affect the organizer’s event. The only thing an invitee can change is his 
attendance response.
If you change your mind about the date you want to hold an event but all 
other aspects of the event remain the same, look at your Calendar in Month 
view, where you can drag events from one day to another. You can drag 
events in other views to change event times without having to open the 
event window. You can copy events by holding down the Option key while 
you drag an event in the interface.
Finding and Searching
After you have several years’ worth of Calendar events under your belt, 
finding specific events might be a challenge. Your events likely accumulate, 
and at times, you might want to quickly search through all your Calendar 
events to find some particular piece of information.
Conducting a search
No matter which of the many Calendar views you’re using, you can search 
for Calendar events by taking the following actions:

Finding and Searching
 
1. Enter a broad search term in the Entourage Search field (in the 
upper-right corner of the Entourage window, as shown in Figure 6-18).
 
 In this example, search the Holiday category. In a flash, Entourage 
changes the interface so that you can refine your search.

Save button in the band above your custom search, as shown in Figure 6-21.
 
Figure 6-21:

Entourage prompts you to give your search a name in the Name field. After 
you enter a name for your search, it appears in the list of Calendar views in 
the folder list of the Calendar window, as shown in Figure 6-22.
 
Figure 6-22:

Using Special Exchange Features
Entourage has a very special Calendar-sharing capability that Microsoft 
Exchange users can utilize. Exchange allows users to look at each other’s 
Calendars, which makes scheduling events a whole lot easier. It also enables 
rumormongers to make guesses about office trysts. Don’t assume that just 
because Tom and Mary have the same time blocked off every day that some 
hanky-panky is going on! Look for lipstick and other telltale signs. Of course, 
we’re just kidding, but we do want to raise your awareness that privacy 
issues are involved in sharing Calendars. Entourage Help has a lot of detail 
about how to take advantage of these special Exchange features — in a 
responsible way!
Sharing Calendars and other items
You can find step-by-step instructions for sharing your Calendar, address 
book, and e-mail folder by searching Entourage Help for the share calendar, 
as shown in Figure 6-23.

Microsoft Entourage provides free, comprehensive, online courses to help 
those who want to use delegation, the global Address Book, and other 
advanced topics related to using Entourage with Microsoft Exchange. To

you can find at least two free courses of interest. We urge you to take these

Importing an Outlook PST File
 
You can get an Exchange account pretty easily. In fact, you or your 
organization can obtain hosted online Exchange services. At the time this 
book was written, the retail price for a basic, single-user Exchange account 
started at $15 per month. A wide variety of options are available at: 
www.microsoft.com/online/exchange-hosted-services.mspx.
Importing an Outlook PST File
Outlook, Microsoft’s e-mail program that runs on Windows, saves all its 
e-mail, contact, and Calendar data in a single PST file. Oddly, Entourage 
doesn’t provide direct support to import an Outlook PST file from Windows.
But Microsoft invested heavily in making Entourage AppleScript-able. So, 
third-party developers can make a living by selling scripts that extend the 
capabilities of Entourage.
Entourage MVPs have assembled a collection of methods that you can use 
to bring Microsoft Outlook PST files into Entourage. You can find them here: 
www.entourage.mvps.org/import_export/pst.html.
Printing Your Calendar
Some pleasant surprises are waiting for you in Entourage’s Print pane when 
you’re in the Calendar application. You can find an amazing number of 
customizations available for printing, as shown in Figure 6-25. Here are some 
of the printing options you have:

Chapter 7: Keeping Track 
of Your Day
In This Chapter
✓ Setting reminders
✓ Making a note
✓ Remembering your tasks
✓ Moving through your day with My Day
K
eeping your daily life in order involves the kind of organization that 
was designed into Office 2008. All the Office applications can key into 
the features we discuss in this chapter. Instead of wondering whether things 
are going as planned, you can find out exactly how your day is going. You 
can get things done your way because you prioritize them. In the end, you 
probably find your days more satisfying because you know you did your 
best to fulfill your own desires.
In this chapter, we deal with the tools that help you get through your day. 
We start with using the Reminders feature; then, we discuss making tasks, 
to-do lists, and notes; and finally, we describe how all this great Office 
organization comes together in the My Day feature.
Bringing Up Reminders
You can set reminders in various ways throughout Office 2008. In Word, 
Excel, Entourage, and PowerPoint, you can use the Flag for Follow Up and 
To Do flags to set reminders about all kinds of different things. When you 
create an event in Entourage, you can set a reminder.
A reminder is a little window that appears on your screen when the event 
trigger you set for it is met, as shown in Figure 7-1. For example, if you have 
an 11 o’clock meeting and you want to be reminded 30 minutes ahead of 
time, you can set up 10:30 as the event trigger for sending you a reminder. 
Reminders have two buttons: Snooze and Dismiss. The message in the 
reminder changes while time passes. Figure 7-1 shows various messages 
each time the reminder popped up while we snoozed.

Click and hold for pop-up.
Snoozing
If you want to hide the reminder for about ten minutes, click the Snooze 
button. When the reminder reappears, you can snooze again. In fact, you get 
unlimited snooze! You’re not obligated to use the default Snooze option. If 
you hold your mouse button down on the Snooze button for a couple seconds, 
a pop-up menu of Snooze options appears, as shown in Figure 7-2.

To open the item that triggered the reminder, click the small Calendar icon in 
the reminder — it’s a button!
Fixing an accidental snooze
If you make a mistake and select the wrong option from the pop-up menu, 
look on your Dock for the application Microsoft Office Reminders, as shown 
in Figure 7-3. Just give the Dock icon (it’s a clock) a click, and the reminder 
window reappears. The number on the badge tells you how many pending 
reminders you have.

Dismissing forever
When you click the Dismiss button, the reminder goes away permanently. 
If you have a lot of pending reminders and want to dismiss them all at the 
same time, click and hold the Dismiss button and choose Dismiss All from 
the pop-up menu that appears.
Making Notes for Future Reference
When the thought pops into your head, “I should make a note of that,” 
click the Notes button on the Entourage toolbar to display the Notes list, as 
shown in Figure 7-4. The Notes feature fills the need to make a quick note, 
and you can use it quickly and simply. Think of Notes as a sticky-notes equiv-
alent within Entourage.

Making Notes for Future Reference
Looking at the Notes list
The Notes application has a consistent look and feel with the other Entourage 
applications we discuss throughout this minibook. Filtering, searching, 
sorting the Notes list, and creating new custom views work the same way 
in Notes as they do for Calendars, which we discuss in Chapter 6 of this 
minibook.
Making a note on the spot
When you click the New button in the Notes application, or if you choose 
File➪New➪Note, a New Note window appears. As you might expect, you 
can type a note. You can also add non-text content to your note by clicking 
the Insert button on the toolbar. Figure 7-5 shows a new note that has a 
QuickTime movie inserted.

When you print from the Notes application, the full Print panel offers you 
specialized options, as shown in Figure 7-6.

Remembering to Do Things
Entourage’s Tasks application is similar to Notes (which we discuss in the 
section, “Making Notes for Future Reference,” earlier in this chapter), but 
Tasks ties in with Reminders (which we talk about in the section, “Bringing 
Up Reminders,” earlier in this chapter). To get to your To Do items, use the 
Entourage Tasks feature on the Entourage toolbar. (Entourage uses Task and 
To Do interchangeably, so we follow suit.)
Checking out the Tasks interface
The Tasks application interface, as shown in Figure 7-7, includes list-filtering 
buttons on the toolbar, in addition to the collection of standard buttons. 
Filtering, searching, sorting the Notes list, and creating new custom views 
work the same way in Tasks as they do for Calendars, which we discuss in 
Chapter 6 of this minibook.
The Tasks interface has a dual personality. In the folder list’s On My 
Computer category, two options result in different sets of items appearing:
 
✦ Tasks: When you select Tasks, tasks that you created in Entourage by 
using the Tasks application appear.
 
✦ To Do List: This option displays items that you created by clicking the 
red To Do flags on various Entourage toolbars. A task can appear in both 
this list and the Tasks list if you use the red flag to mark the task as a To 
Do item. This list also displays the Flag for Follow Up items created in 
Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.
 
When you’re using the Tasks application, be sure to click both Tasks and To 
Do List in the left pane so that you don’t accidentally overlook something.

Creating a new task
When you click the New button on the toolbar within the Tasks application, 
you open a new, untitled Task window, as shown in Figure 7-8. A new task 
opens, even if you’re in the To Do list. You can also create new tasks from My 
Day, which we cover in the section, “Making Your Day with My Day,” later in 
this chapter.

Marking a task as completed
When you complete a task, reopen the task by double-clicking it in the Tasks 
list (refer to Figure 7-7) and then select the Complete check box. The feeling 
of satisfaction you get each time you select that check box can make your 
work seem worthwhile.
Creating a new To Do item
In many windows in Entourage, you find red To Do flags on the toolbars, 
including the new task item, as shown in Figure 7-8. Click the red To Do flag 
to add a To Do item for the task and/or set a reminder. In Word, Excel, and 
PowerPoint, use the Flag for Follow Up feature.
Printing tasks and To Do lists
The Print dialog, like this dialog in other Entourage applications, offers 
special choices for printing tasks and To Do lists, as shown in Figure 7-9.

Making Your Day with My Day
 
My Day is a completely new, Mac-first, Mac-only feature of Office 2008. 
The idea behind My Day is to give you a forward-looking window into the 
immediate future. The My Day window can float on top of your other 
application windows. You can also use My Day to create new tasks.
Looking at My Day
The My Day interface, as shown in Figure 7-10, is unique — and very purple. 
The top half of the interface shows upcoming events from your Entourage 
Calendar. While time passes during the day, the day’s events automatically 
drop off from the top, and upcoming events appear at the bottom. The lower 

722
Making Your Day with My Day
half of the My Day window shows tasks from your Entourage Tasks list. You 
can reorder your tasks by dragging them up and down in the Tasks list while 
you go through your day.

At the top of My Day, you can see controls that let you quickly view days or 
time ranges that are different from the default. The Go to Date button opens 
a small window that lets you enter a specific date to look at in My Day. To 
use the other controls, click their buttons.
Creating a new task
If you want to create a new task, you can do it right from within My Day. Just 
click the Create Task button to expand the hidden sheet, where you can 
type the name of your task. When you press the Return key, your new task 
appears in the Tasks portion of My Day, and a new task is added to your 
Entourage tasks.
 
To change the details of your new task, double-click the Open Task button to 
open Entourage (if it’s not open already). Double-click the Open Task button 
a second time to open the task’s detail pane in Entourage.

E
verybody wants to keep their projects organized and on track. The first 
step is planning, but no matter how well you plan, you’re sure to experi-
ence twists and turns along the way. Fortunately, Project Center is flexible — 
and it’s there every step of the way to help you manage your project for optimal 
results. Don’t worry, Project Center doesn’t do too much hand-holding, unless 
you ask it to.
Project Center may be just one of the Entourage applications, in addition to 
Contacts, Calendar, and so on. But Project Center is extraordinarily powerful 
software, so we give Project Center an entire minibook of its own! We want to 
highlight just how important this application can be to Office users and empha-
size that Project Center is a distinct application in its own right that isn’t limited 
to working with Entourage alone. Whether in Word, Excel, or PowerPoint, you 
can use Project Center to help you manage almost any sort of project.
 
Incidentally, Project Center is available only on the Mac. Windows versions 
of Office don’t have a comparable program.
This chapter starts with a discussion of the kinds of project scenarios in 
which Project Center is the right application to use. Then, we give you an 
overview of what you can expect to get out of Project Center, as well as how 
to make your very first project.
Deciding When to Use Project Center
You may want to consider Project Center when the project you’re working 
on involves more than just one or two tasks. Setting up and managing a proj-
ect takes a little time, so you probably don’t want to use Project Center for 
every little thing. However, here are some occasions when you could benefit 
from using Project Center:
 
✦ Participating in a committee at work or tackling an assignment.
 
✦ Working on an office or home remodeling project.

728
Deciding When to Use Project Center
 
✦ Writing a thesis or another major written work.
 
✦ Preparing a colloquium.
 
✦ Fulfilling and tracking your job responsibilities.
 
✦ Running a department.
 
✦ Managing facilities.
 
✦ Writing a book like this one!
Of course, after you begin to use Project Center, you’ll surely find many 
other times when it can come in handy. Because Project Center is targeted 
to fulfill the organizational needs of both office and personal projects, almost 
everyone who’s employed or has a significant home project to work on can 
appreciate Project Center.
When deciding which project organizing tool to use, you can refer to a hier-
archy based on the size and complexity of the project. Here are the three 
different levels to consider:
 
✦ Entourage Tasks: When you just need an unstructured, casual approach, 
you can use Entourage Tasks and other regular Entourage features to 
handle a small project. For example, if you’re picking up artwork at 
the graphics shop as a favor for a coworker, record that activity as an 
Entourage task. But if you make picking up artwork at the graphics shop 
for a project, you’re working on a Project Center task.
 
✦ Entourage Project Center: A structured, organized approach that 
enables you to manage a series of tasks, assignments, communications, 
and shared documents. Your project can be open-ended, or it can have a 
specific timeframe.
 
✦ Microsoft Project: Used by people who manage projects for a living, 
Microsoft Project is a Windows-only product designed for large-scale, 
complex projects. If more than 50 percent of your workday involves 
managing projects, consider using this or another specialized project 
management software, such as OmniPlan (www.omnigroup.com/
applications/omniplan).
Use Entourage Project Center when working without some sort of formal 
organization isn’t enough but when using something like Microsoft Project is 
massive overkill.
Understanding How Project Center WorksWhen your project involves other 
people, you can share documents, contacts, messages, tasks, and files of all 
kinds. The documents and files aren’t limited to Entourage, or even Office. Project
Center takes advantage of Mac OS X and Windows file-sharing capabilities, so 
you can share projects and their contents with others in your organization.
Book V shows how you can tag mail, contacts, tasks, notes, and Calendar 
events within Entourage by using the Categories feature. Similarly, you can 

Book VI
Chapter 1
Creating New 
Projects
729
Determining the Scope
tag these same items, and even files, in Entourage to associate them with 
projects. Then, you can use the superb project management tools contained 
in Entourage’s Project Center.
Different projects require different levels of involvement from all stakehold-
ers. Depending on the scope of your project and your role in it, here are the 
three main project scenarios and how Project Center can make your life sim-
pler in each one:
 
✦ Doing an independent project: Project Center can help you manage a 
one-person project.
 
✦ Working as part of a team: Project Center has sophisticated sharing 
tools that you can use for any given group project.
 
✦ Organizing a group project: By using Project Center’s Share feature, you 
can share your projects with others, and others can share their projects 
with you. As far as Project Center is concerned, the person who controls 
the project is the project organizer.
Determining the Scope
 
 You use Project Center in two general situations: as a single user or in a 
shared environment (see Figure 1-1). Everyone can make and use single-user 
projects (designated by the Number 1 icon). We encourage you to use Project 
Center with a single-user project to get started because single-user projects
 
 are simpler than shared projects. Shared projects (designated by the pedes-
trian-crossing sign) are the way to go when working with others, especially 
within organizations. Shared projects in Project Center are among the most 
powerful organizational tools you’ll find anywhere.
Single-user projects
 
 Single-user projects limit the scope to just one person — you. Everyone has 
projects that fall into this category. Office 2008 uses the symbol, as shown in 
the margin.
Starting out with a single-user project as your first project is a great way to 
get familiar with Project Center. Here are some examples of single-user proj-
ects that you might have:
 
✦ Getting hired: Use Project Center to organize your résumé, applications, 
appointments, related e-mail, and documents.
 
✦ Staying hired: Manage your resume, curriculum vitae, awards, certifica-
tions, and so on.
 
✦ Managing finances: Organize mail and documents related to your 
IRA (Individual Retirement Account), investments, savings, checking 
account, and other financial information.

Sharing projects
 
 Project Center can save individuals and organizations a lot of money. The 
time savings, efficiency, and convenience of Project Center are almost irre-
sistible. After you use a project or two, you might feel the urge to get every-
one in your organization in on this great technology. The symbol that Office 
2008 uses to designate aspects of Project Center that relate to sharing proj-
ects is shown in the margin.
 
You shouldn’t deploy sharing projects in Project Center on an individual 
basis, except for testing purposes or for your own personal projects. When 
you work in an organization, treat Project Center as a mission-critical appli-
cation. Shared projects can be as important to your organization as your 
organization’s e-mail server and file servers. Project Center isn’t like a simple 
Web service; it’s a full-fledged file-server-dependent application. Project 
Center can scale from individual projects to departmental projects or even 
organization-wide shared projects.
When you share a project, you allow others to share project-related docu-
ments, e-mail, tasks, and Calendar events. Entourage uses a shared file loca-
tion. People who need to share a particular project have access to a special 
Watch Folder in the shared directory. (See the section, “Project Watch 
Folders,” later in this chapter, for more on Watch Folders.) However, before 
you begin, think about two essential considerations before sharing projects: 
security and consistency.
Thinking about security
Shared projects in Project Center are serious business. The shared folder’s 
security is critical. Choosing a location for sharing projects requires some 

Book VI
Chapter 1
Creating New 
Projects
731
Determining the Scope
thought. For starters, you have to acknowledge that your group will almost 
certainly place sensitive documents in the shared folder. So, you have to make 
decisions about who has access to that folder — limit access to trusted people 
only. The physical location of the shared folder is very important. A shared 
directory shouldn’t reside on a person’s individual computer; even if that 
computer is backed up regularly. Use a secure (both from a physical and net-
work perspective) file server that has integrated backup. You may need to use 
encryption to ensure your shared documents’ privacy.
 
Your shared projects may need a lot of disk space if your organization deals 
with multimedia files. If you ever wondered whether you have a need for a 
Mac OS X server, well, now you do! Mac OS X Disk Utility can create encrypted 
disk images, so you might want to take that approach. However, you can use 
any file server that supports SMB connections, which means you can use 
Windows, Unix, and Linux servers to host shared projects. Consult Mac OS X 
Help for assistance with configuring Finder to mount an SMB directory.
Controlling consistency
Network administrators have power over your shared volumes. They need 
to be involved in any setup and maintenance of shared project directories. 
You absolutely need to think about the file directory structure ahead of 
time. Windows and Linux administrators seem to have a penchant for using 
symbolic links and then not telling anyone about them. When links change, 
projects can potentially stop working suddenly. When any part of a file path 
to a shared Watch Folder changes, projects become inaccessible.
 
We urge you to involve your network IT people before you start deploying 
shared projects to any significant degree. Come to an agreement so that the 
network folks understand that the entire company can face serious costs 
and consequences if they alter the directory structure. A signed Service 
Level Agreement (SLA), which specifies what the IT department agrees to 
provide and outlines the rules that govern how the service operates, is 
certainly in order so that IT understands the importance of not changing 
the directory structure and knows who has to pay for the costs involved 
if they do. You need a file directory scheme that remains consistent — or 
unchanged — essentially forever, or until someone’s willing to pay the costs 
for making a change migration. If you’ve ever experienced a broken link in a 
PowerPoint presentation, imagine that frustration and cost times thousands 
or millions if something goes wrong with your file server.
Your IT network crew can also help you understand the security aspects of 
their particular network. Work together as a team to deploy Project Center 
shared projects.

Starting a New Project
Starting a New Project
You can start a new project from many places in the Office 2008 suite. You 
may have seen an option to start a project in a menu, a pop-up menu, or in 
the Toolbox. Regardless of where you begin, you’re taken to a wizard that 
helps you establish a new Project Center project. In this example, we start 
in Entourage. First, we set up a personal, single-user project. In Chapter 2 of 
this minibook, we explain how to share a project.
Follow these steps to start a new project:
 
1. Open Entourage and, on the Standard toolbar, click the Project Center 
button, as shown in Figure 1-2.
 
 Project Center appears — and looks almost empty if this is your first 
project. The Project Center window now displays the title Projects.
 
Figure 1-2:

toolbar.

2. Click the New button on the Standard toolbar to open the New Project 
Wizard screen, as shown in Figure 1-3.
 
 At each step in the wizard, be sure to read the Description area, as 
shown in Figure 1-3. This area has valuable information.
Wizard Step 1 — Setting the framework
Refer to Figure 1-3 or, of course, your own computer’s screen while you add 
the information that the wizard requests, as follows:
 
✦ Name: Initially, this field says Untitled Project. Give your project a suit-
able name that’s descriptive but not too long.
 
 
✦ Due Date: A due date is optional, depending on the nature of your proj-
ect. You can always change this setting later, but if your project has lim-
ited duration, you may want to set a due date now. A little pop-up 
calendar button appears to the right of the date input field. Click the 
button to use a pop-up calendar to select a due date.

Book VI
Chapter 1

733
Starting a New Project
 
✦ Notes to Self: You can make a note about the purpose or nature of the 
project. If you decide to share the project, other members don’t see 
these notes.
 
✦ Drag and Drop Image Here: Drag and drop a picture or clip art from 
your computer on this area so you have a visual cue that distinguishes 
this project from others that you create.
 
✦ Click to Pick Color: Click Click to Pick Color to display a pop-up menu. 
Select a color that you want to use in the header and in Entourage lists 
to help you distinguish this project from other projects.
When you’re finished with this page of the wizard, click the small arrow at 
the bottom-right corner.
Wizard Step 2 — Deciding where and what
In Step 2, you decide the file location of your project and what existing 
items, if any, you want to associate with your project. Start at the top of Step 
2 of the New Project Wizard, as shown in Figure 1-4.

Project Watch Folders
Of course, the most obvious question that you need to answer is, “What’s a 
project Watch Folder?” One nifty feature of Project Center is that your proj-
ects can contain any sort of file. You store the files that are associated with 
your project in a Watch Folder. You have two choices:
 
✦ Automatically Create Watch Folders: For this example, we accept the 
default, which is Automatically Create Project Watch Folders. We sug-
gest this option for a single-user project.
 
✦ Manually Set Project Watch Folders: This option allows you to select 
any file location for the Finder Watch Folder and designate any folder 
inside Entourage to store project e-mail. Select this option if you want 
to locate a Watch Folder on a shared directory, such as a network drive, 
or perhaps a Microsoft Mesh.com free file-sharing volume. If you put the 
Watch Folder on a network drive, you can share project files.
Import Items
This option takes into consideration three different situations that you may face:
 
✦ Default options: From Category and From Project are set to None. Use 
these settings if you’re starting fresh and you don’t have an existing cat-
egory or project that you can use as a basis for your new project.

Book VI
Chapter 1
Creating New 
Projects
735
Starting a New Project
 
✦ From Category: The need to create a project doesn’t always manifest 
itself right off the bat. You may have created a category in Entourage 
(see Book V, Chapter 3) and at some point realized that a simple category 
isn’t enough — you’re ready to convert the category into a project. Use 
this option to associate items that you already have in a category with 
your project. The category doesn’t go away.
 
✦ From Project: Projects sometimes spawn additional sub-projects. This 
option enables you to import items from an existing project as the basis 
of a new one.
When you’re finished with this page of the wizard, click the small arrow at 
the bottom-right corner.
Wizard Step 3 — Applying rules and tools
As shown in Figure 1-5, Step 3 helps you automatically populate your new 
project. If you’re familiar with Entourage mail rules, this step of the wizard 
makes sense to you. If you have no experience with Entourage mail rules 
(see Book V, Chapter 4), the following section gives you a good introduction 
because these rules aren’t very complex.
 
Figure 1-5: 
Applying 
rules and 
choosing 
tools.
 

736
Starting a New Project
Rules
The rules you decide on in this section are simple, yet powerful. Be thought-
ful in applying these rules because they might put more items into your proj-
ect than you might expect at first blush:
 
✦ Associate E-mail from Project Contacts: If you select this option, when 
you finish the New Project Wizard, you can associate Entourage con-
tacts with your project so that all e-mail to and from the contact auto-
matically associates with your project.
 
 To associate a contact with your project, in your Entourage Address 
Book, right-click or Control-click the contact’s name. From the resulting 
pop-up menu, choose Projects➪[Project Name]. All messages from project-
associated contacts are associated automatically with your project.
 
 This rule can be very convenient if you have someone in your contact 
list exclusively for your project. On the other hand, if you also receive 
non-project-related messages from a contact, the following method is 
better.
 
✦ Associate E-mail with the Following Subjects: This option is a good way 
to ensure that Entourage tags project-related e-mail as belonging to your 
project. Tell project members to use a unique, agreed-on (or specified) 
uncommon word, phrase, or nonsense character combination so that 
Entourage mail rules properly tag incoming mail messages and associate 
them with your project.
 
✦ Don’t Apply Other Rules to These Messages: Selecting this option pre-
vents existing rules from affecting incoming messages that are associ-
ated with your project.
 
✦ Apply (These) Rules to Existing Messages: Be careful with this one. If 
you select this check box and someone you associated with your project 
already has thousands of messages in your mailbox, all those messages 
become tagged as related to your project. On the other hand, if you 
already have a bunch of messages with a keyword in the subject, you 
can bring them into the project all at the same time, very easily.
Finder Tools
The Finder Tools area has one option. If you select the Add Project Watch 
Folder Alias to the Desktop check box, you put a shortcut to the shared files 
folder onto your Desktop.
When you’re finished with this page of the wizard, click the small arrow at 
the bottom-right corner.

Wizard Step 4 — Summary
The final step in the wizard is perhaps the most thoughtful. (Maybe that’s 
why we like this wizard so much.) Here, the wizard presents a summary of 
the choices you made. Read the information provided. If you need to change 
anything, click the left arrow buttons to return to any step in the wizard. 
When you approve the summary, click the right arrow to create your proj-
ect. Your project shows up in Project Center. Incidentally, you always have 
the opportunity in Project Center to change your project’s settings, so if you 
made a mistake or aren’t sure you made the right choices, you can relax!

Book VI: Entourage’s Project Center

Chapter 2: Overviewing and 
Sharing Projects
In This Chapter
✓ Working in the Projects list
✓ Clicking the tabs
✓ Customizing the Overview tab
✓ Sharing your project
✓ Using a shortcut
A
s you might expect, Project Center has a place where you can view 
all your projects at the same time and then switch easily from one to 
another. That place is the Overview tab, which we talk about in this chapter. 
The Overview tab is also where you get an overview (makes sense, right?) 
of individual projects with customizable blocks that let you choose which 
aspects of your project you want to view. In this chapter, we also discuss 
how you can share a project by using Project Center’s sharing capabilities.
The windows and layout of Entourage’s Project Center are similar to the other 
Entourage applications. For more on Entourage, see Book V, which covers 
topics such as ordering the lists in the interface, right-clicking and Control-
clicking to get pop-up menus, and using Search to create custom views. If you 
haven’t created a project yet, turn to Chapter 1 of this minibook.
Lurking in the Projects List
When you first get into Project Center from the New Project Wizard (see 
Chapter 1 in this minibook for more on this wizard), the Projects window 
appears, featuring a list of projects, as shown in Figure 2-1.
The Projects list is a bit like a fork in the road: You can continue in two dif-
ferent ways, and the route you choose depends on what you want to see in 
Project Center’s interface. You can open a project
 
✦ Within the Project Center window
 
✦ In its own window
We explain each option in the following sections.

When you view a project within the Project Center window, you can have 
access to the Favorites bar, the mini-calendar, and custom views. Before you 
can open your project within the Project Center window, you need to toggle 
the disclosure triangle (next to the Projects folder) so the triangle is pointing 
down in the folder list. See Figure 2-2.

Lurking in the Projects List
Within the Project Center window, you can view a list of all your projects, or 
you can view everything about one of the projects:
 
✦ To view a list of all your projects: Select the Projects folder at the top of 
the folder list (it has the disclosure triangle next to it). A list of all your 
projects appears in the pane to the right. You can see the list of all proj-
ects only when you have the Projects folder (which appears at the top of 
the folder list) selected.
 
✦ To view everything about one of your projects: Select a project from 
the projects that appear below the Projects folder in the folder list. A 
series of project tabs appears for the selected project in the pane to the 
right, along with project details, as shown in Figure 2-3.

Lurking in the Projects List
You can show or hide the folder list by using any of the following methods:
 
✦ Choose View➪Hide Folder List.
 
✦ Drag the divider to hide the folder list.
 
✦ Press Ô-B to toggle the folder list on and off.
We explain the remaining interface options in the section, “Touching the 
Tabs,” later in this chapter.
Opening a project in its own window
With the Projects folder selected in the folder list, right-click or Control-
click the project name to see a pop-up menu, as shown in Figure 2-4. If you 
choose Open Project from the pop-up menu, the project opens in its own 
window. Opening a project in its own window gives you more screen space 
to work in. The trade-off is that you can’t access the folder list, including all 
the views and custom views; you don’t see the mini-calendar; and you can’t 
use the Favorites bar (which we describe in the section, “Taking a Shortcut,” 
later in this chapter).

If you prefer opening a project in its own window all the time, consider 
changing one of Entourage’s preferences so that you can simply double-click 
a project name to open it in its own window. Follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Entourage➪Preferences.
 
 The Preferences dialog appears.
 
2. In the General Preferences list, select General.
 
 The General Preferences dialog appears.

4. Click OK to close the General Preferences dialog.
 
 Now, when you double-click a project in the folder list or the Projects 
list, your project opens in its own window. You can double-click more 
than one project so that you can have multiple projects open at the 
same time and still have access to the Projects list.
Touching the Tabs
Figure 2-3 shows the result of opening a project in its own window. The 
window has no folder list on the left side, so custom views aren’t avail-
able. We use the Personal Project example in this section, and as shown in 
Figure 2-5, it opened in the Overview tab. If your project doesn’t open on the 
Overview tab, just click the Overview tab in the project tabs.

Click these bars to customize.
Here are the seven different tabs in Project Center, as shown in Figure 2-5 
(we discuss many of these tabs in Chapter 4 of this minibook):
 
✦ Overview: Presents a snapshot of your project with customizable view-
ing boxes (see the following section for details).
 
✦ Schedule: Allows you to view all Calendar events and tasks associated 
with your project. See Chapter 3 of this minibook.

744
Surveying the Overview
 
✦ Mail: Displays mail associated with your project. You can also create 
new project-associated mail in this tab.
 
✦ Files: Displays a list of the files that are associated with your project. 
You can add and delete files from this tab.
 
✦ Contacts: Allows you to manage the list of contacts who are involved in 
your project.
 
✦ Clippings: Displays Scrapbook contents associated with your project.
 
✦ Notes: Allows you to create and display notes to yourself about your 
project.
Surveying the Overview
The Overview tab has an executive summary of your project. Overview lets 
you use many features on the Project Center tabs, but it’s less robust than 
each of the individual tabs for each feature. For example, you can work with 
a view of your project’s Calendar in Overview without having to switch to 
the Schedule tab.
Trying out the toolbars
Project Center is a bit unusual in that project windows have two tool-
bars: one at the top and another not so conspicuously at the bottom. In 
Project Center windows, you can customize the top toolbar by choosing 
View➪Customize Toolbar to display the Toolbar Options dialog. (See Book V, 
Chapter 3 for how to customize Entourage toolbars.) You can’t customize 
the toolbar on the bottom of the window.
Each of the tabs we mention in the preceding section has its own set of 
default toolbar buttons on both the top and bottom of the window. In 
Figures 2-3 and 2-5, you can see the default toolbar buttons for the Overview 
tab. Here are the most important Overview toolbar buttons (the rest are 
explained in Chapters 3 and 4 of this minibook):
 
 
✦ New: When you click the New toolbar button on the Overview tab, a 
new, blank e-mail message opens, ready to be addressed and filled in. 
Because you’re working in a project, the new e-mail message is associ-
ated automatically with this project.
 
 
✦ Share: When you want to turn a project from a single-user project into a 
shared project, click this button. The Share button is on every tab within 
Project Center. Read more about this button in the section, “Sharing a 
Project,” later in this chapter.

✦ Backup: Click this button to start the Entourage Export Wizard. See 
Book V, Chapter 3 for more on exporting Entourage items.
 
 
✦ Add: When you select an Add option, the new item is associated with 
your project. Figure 2-6 shows the choices in the Add pop-up menu:
 
 
• Event: Create a new Calendar event.

to your project from Scrapbook.
 
• Note: Add a project-related note.

✦ Remove: Removes the selected item from the project.
 
✦ Watch Folders: You have two Watch Folders:
 
 
• Entourage Watch Folder: Clicking this button displays a custom view 
of the mail associated with your project.
 
 
• Finder Watch Folder: Clicking this button displays the folder that con-
tains all the documents and files that are in your project.
 
Don’t create subfolders in the Finder Watch Folder. Finder allows you to 
create subfolders, but the Office interface can’t always display them.
Peeking at the Calendar and Tasks
This mini-view of your project’s Calendar allows you to see your project’s 
Calendar events. When you add an event, it appears in your Entourage 
Calendar, marked as associated with your project. Here’s more info on work-
ing with events:

746
Sharing a Project
 
✦ You can add events by double-clicking in the Calendar, or you can use 
the Add button to associate Calendar events with a project.
 
✦ You can open Calendar events and tasks by double-clicking them.
 
✦ You can mark tasks as completed by selecting the check box next to a 
task’s name.
Customizing the customizable areas
The Customize area in Figures 2-3 and 2-5 has two gray bars anchored to the 
top of a gray shaded block. (In Figure 2-5, these bars are labeled New and 
Recent Mail, and Microsoft Messenger contacts.) Click either bar to open a 
pop-up menu, as shown in Figure 2-7, and then select a menu item to preview 
various aspects of your project. The same menu choices appear for the bar 
on the left and the bar on the right. What appears under each bar changes 
considerably, depending on which elements you select. The Overview tab 
does indeed allow you to check each aspect of a project, although not in as 
much detail, as we explain in Chapters 3 and 4 of this minibook.
 
Figure 2-7: 
Customizing 
the 
Overview.
 
Sharing a Project
 
 The steps you follow to turn a single-user project into a shared project are 
simple. The hard part is having a secure place to locate the shared folder, as 
we emphasize heavily in the Chapter 1 of this minibook. But you may find 
deciding whether you’re ready to upgrade the project from single user to 
shared even harder. Whatever you decide, be kind to yourself and share the 
first few projects with colleagues and friends, not your boss or competitors!
You need a location on a shared directory that’s accessible to your project 
members so that those other people can join your project, as we describe in 
Chapter 1 of this minibook.
 
 When you’re ready to turn on sharing, click the Share button on the bottom 
toolbar in Project Center. From the pop-up menu, select the only option 
that’s offered for your first project: Start Sharing Project.

Sharing a Project
Step 1 — Start the Assistant
When you select Start Sharing Project from the Share pop-up menu, the 
Project Sharing Assistant, as shown in Figure 2-8, opens. Step 1 is informa-
tional only.
 
When you’re done with this step in the Project Sharing Assistant, click the 
right arrow in the lower-right corner to proceed to the next step.
 
Figure 2-8: 
Step 1 of 
sharing a 
project.
 
Click here to go to the next step.
Step 2 — Select which project to share
After a while, you’ll probably have more than one project. In Step 2, you 
simply select from a pop-up menu so that you can tell Entourage which of 
the available projects you want to share (see Figure 2-9). Entourage uses the 
cute little pedestrian-crossing icon (in the top-right of the Assistant) to sig-
nify shared projects.
When you’re done with this step in the Project Sharing Assistant, click the 
right arrow in the lower-right corner to proceed to the next step.
Step 3 — Choose the file location for 
the shared folder
This third step requires more than just one mouse click. In this step, select 
the location in Finder for your project’s Watch Folder. Usually, you place the 
Watch Folder on a shared network volume.

748

Shared Project icon
Choose the subject you want to share.
 
Yes, we know you can turn on Mac OS X file sharing and use a shared folder. 
That’s okay for testing and demonstrating Project Center’s sharing features, 
but it’s definitely not okay for using at work in your organization for daily 
project activities. Having said that, if you just want to test the waters for 
project sharing with a colleague at the office, Mac OS X file sharing is a good 
way to get started. Personal file sharing is inappropriate for daily use of 
Project Center.
Follow these steps to set your project’s Watch Folder:
 
1. In the Project Sharing Assistant, as shown in Figure 2-10, click the 
Choose button.
 
 The Choose a Location on a File Server dialog opens (see Figure 2-11). 
Everyone you’re sharing your project with needs to have read and write 
access to this folder. Usually, you select a shared folder on a network for 
the Watch Folder.
 
2. Navigate to the folder on the shared directory in which you want to 
store the project’s files.
 
 This location is the around-the-clock secure, consistent location for your 
project (see Figure 2-11).
 
3. Select New Folder or the folder you want to use, and then click the 
Choose button.
 
 You return to the Project Sharing Assistant, which displays the file path 
to your project’s shared folder, as shown in Figure 2-12.

When you’re done with this step in the Project Sharing Assistant, click the 
right arrow in the lower-right corner to proceed to the next step.
Step 4 — Share existing items
In many cases, you share a project that you’ve been using for a while on 
your own, so you have existing items already in your project. You can decide 
whether you want to include the existing items or just items that are added after 
you convert your single-user project to a shared project (see Figure 2-13).

have.
 
 
Pay attention to the big red notice that advises you that if you select Yes, the 
existing project items, including all related files, will be moved to the shared 
location and will no longer be where they were when you created the project.
When you’re done with this step in the Project Sharing Assistant, click the 
right arrow in the lower-right corner to proceed to the next step.
Step 5 — Decide how to manage new items
You have two ways to share items within a project (see Figure 2-14). The 
simple way is to share everything with everyone all the time. However, you 
can share only the items that you mark individually for sharing. So, you can 

Book VI
Chapter 2
Overviewing and 
Sharing Projects
751
Sharing a Project
put all sorts of things into your project without having to share each and every 
one of them. You can always change an item’s sharing status at any time.
When you’re done with this step in the Project Sharing Assistant, click the 
right arrow in the lower-right corner to proceed to the next step.
 
Figure 2-14: 
Choosing 
automatic 
or individual 
item 
sharing.
 
Step 6 — Close the Project Sharing Assistant
This step has only one option, as shown in Figure 2-15. Click the Close 
button after you review your settings. Now, your project is being shared in 
Project Center.
 
Figure 2-15: 
Closing 
the Project 
Sharing 
Assistant.
 

752
Sharing a Project
 
 
Changing Project settings
 
 To change the settings you made in the Project Sharing Assistant or to stop 
sharing a project entirely, click the Project Center Overview tab. Click the 
Properties button on the bottom toolbar and then click the Sharing tab. The 
Project Properties dialog appears, which has tabs that replicate steps of the 
Project Sharing assistant, as shown in Figure 2-16:
 
✦ To stop sharing: Click the Stop Sharing button.
 
✦ To save your Project Sharing setting changes: Click the Save button, 
which also dismisses the Project Properties dialog.
 
Figure 2-16: 
Changing 
your 
project’s 
sharing 
settings.
 
 
If the path to your project changes, visit the Project Properties dialog to reset 
it. Everyone who’s sharing projects has to change this setting in their copy of 
Entourage for each project’s location. If hundreds or thousands of projects 
exist, this process can be time-consuming and inconvenient, which is why we 
advise you to choose a safe, consistent place to store your projects.
Taking a Shortcut
Perhaps you noticed the shortcuts directly beneath the Standard toolbar 
in many Entourage windows. You can add your project to the shortcuts 
by right-clicking or Control-clicking the project name in the folder list, and 
then choosing Add to Favorites Bar, as shown in Figure 2-17. If your project

is already in the Favorites bar, the same pop-up menu offers Remove from 
Favorites Bar. Figure 2-18 shows our Personal Project after we added it to 
the Favorites bar. The Favorites bar isn’t visible in projects that are opened 
in their own windows.

Chapter 3: Keeping on Schedule
In This Chapter
✓ Managing Calendar events and tasks
✓ Making the most of the lower toolbar
✓ Gadding about with Gantt charts
M
anaging the time aspects of your project is one of the most important 
activities that you can do to meet your project’s deadlines. Because 
Entourage offers advanced calendar- and task-management capabilities, 
you can take advantage of them as they apply specifically to your individual 
projects.
For those who seek that elusive project-management tool — a Gantt chart — we 
show you how to make these helpful charts and include them in your project.
 
Before you can use the features in this chapter, you must first open a proj-
ect in its own window or in the Project Center window, which we explain 
how to do in Chapter 2 of this minibook.
Keeping Track of Events and Tasks
When you click Project Center’s Schedule tab, a detailed and robust applica-
tion appears that focuses on your project’s Calendar and Tasks. In this com-
bination window, as shown in Figure 3-1, you have all the tools of Entourage’s 
regular Calendar and Tasks applications. In Project Center, the events and 
tasks that you’ve associated with the selected project in the folder list at the 
left or with the project you opened in its own window from the Projects list 
(see Chapter 2 of this minibook).
Working with the Calendar
The Calendar portion of the Schedule tab looks and works intuitively. The 
toolbar buttons are the same as the regular Entourage Calendar view, and 
you can right-click or Control-click in the interface to use pop-up menus, as 
shown in Figure 3-1.

When you create a new event, it’s automatically tagged for the selected 
project, no matter which interface option you use, such as clicking the New 
button, using the File menu, double-clicking the Calendar, or selecting New 
Calendar Event from the context-sensitive pop-up menu.
 
Double-click an event to open the event in its own window.
If you right-click or Control-click an event and choose Delete Event from 
the pop-up menu, the event is deleted from all Entourage Calendars. If you 
select an event and then press the Delete key on the keyboard or choose 
Edit➪Delete to delete an event, it’s also deleted from all Calendars. You may 
not be able to undo this action, so be careful with Delete.
 
 If you select an event and then click the Remove button from the bottom 
toolbar, the event is still in your main Entourage Calendar. Click the Remove 
button to disassociate the event from your project but not delete it.
Filtering and making overlays
Because you probably have more than one project underway at any given 
time, the Schedule tab allows you to easily switch your Calendar view from 
one project to another, without leaving the current project.

Book VI
Chapter 3
Keeping on 
Schedule
757
Keeping Track of Events and Tasks
The Schedule tab also allows you to filter and overlay the Calendar events 
of a single project and overlay all your projects in a live view within the 
Schedule Calendar view. The more projects you have, the more useful the 
Schedule tab becomes!
Beneath the Project Center tabs, off to the right side is a combination of 
pop-up menus (and sometimes an input field) that together comprise the 
Calendar Filter:
 
✦ Menu 1: Click the arrow to see a pop-up menu where you can filter 
based on project, category, or subject. In Figure 3-1, this menu is the left-
most pop-up menu.
 
✦ Menu 2: The Personal menu appears to the right of pop-up Menu 1. Pop-up 
Menu 2 changes depending on what you select in Menu 1. Table 3-1 summa-
rizes your options.
 
✦ Search field: At times, you may see a blank search field (which Figure 3-1 
doesn’t show) when Subject Contains is chosen in Menu 1.
 
 
✦ X (Clear) button: On the far right, you can see an X (Clear) button that 
clears the Calendar Filter. When you click the X (Clear) button, pop-up 
Menu 2 switches to All.
 
 Although this behavior may seem strange, when pop-up Menu 1 displays 
Subject Contains, nothing happens to the input field when you click the 
X (Clear) button.
The Calendar Filter affects only the Calendar, not the Tasks associated with it.

Category Is

You may find the Schedule tab indispensable. While your responsibilities 
increase, you can use the Schedule tab to make sure your meetings, tasks, 
and events don’t overlap or conflict with each other from one project to 
another.
 
In the Schedule tab, the project you work with is selected in the top portion of 
the left panel, the folder view (see Chapter 2 of this minibook), which you can 
turn on and off by pressing Ú-B when viewing your project in a Project Center 
window. (You don’t have this option if your project is in its own window.)

758
Keeping Track of Events and Tasks
To copy an event, press and hold the Option key while you drag your event 
in the Calendar.
Changing Calendar views
 
 When you use the Schedule tab, Calendar View buttons appear on the 
Standard toolbar. Choose from these options:
 
✦ Today: Displays today’s date in the current view.
 
✦ View Date: Displays a small dialog in which you can enter a date or 
select a date from a pop-up calendar.
 
✦ Day: Displays one day’s calendar.
 
✦ Work Week: Displays one week of your calendar. You can set the work 
week in Entourage Preferences (see Book V, Chapter 2 to find out how).
 
✦ Week: Displays one week’s calendar.
 
✦ Month: Displays one month’s calendar.
Working with Tasks
The Tasks portion of the Schedule tab, as shown in Figure 3-1, shows a Tasks 
list that’s associated with your project. You have the same interface features 
that you do for Calendar events, as we discuss in the section, “Working with 
the Calendar,” earlier in this chapter, plus some additional options:
 
✦ Edit task in field: Click the fields in the Task list and edit the field right 
in the window.
 
✦ Completed check box: Mark a task as completed by clicking this check box.
 
✦ Order tasks: Click the column headers to order tasks.
 
✦ Drag and drop: You can drag a task to the Desktop to create a standard 
Calendar event file with an .ics extension that you can send as an 
e-mail attachment.
Right-clicking or Control-clicking a task produces a handy pop-up menu 
that’s definitely worth investigating, as shown in Figure 3-2.
Like with the Calendar Filter in the upper part of the Schedule tab, you can 
filter and/or compare tasks with all your projects in an overlay. The Task 
Filter’s pop-up menus look and work the same way as the Calendar Filter, 
which we discuss in the section, “Filtering and making overlays,” earlier in 
this chapter.

Exploring the Lower Toolbar
The toolbar at the bottom of the Schedule tab starts with the Share button 
and then features a New button, which works a little differently from the 
New button in the Standard toolbar. We explore the bottom toolbar’s but-
tons in the following sections.
Sharing your project with others
In Chapter 2 of this minibook, we explain how to share a project. (If you 
haven’t already, start there to find out about how to share a project.) After 
you start a shared project, you might want to invite a colleague, a relative, or 
a friend to join in the shared project. The person you invite becomes a proj-
ect member after he accepts your invitation. If your invitee has Entourage, 
he can add the same project to his Project Center and share all the docu-
ments, Calendar events, notes, and tasks that you’ve designated to share 
with project members.
To invite someone to become a project member, follow these steps:
 
 1. Click the Share button in the bottom toolbar.
 
 
 A pop-up menu, as shown in Figure 3-3, appears.
 
Figure 3-3: 
Step 1 of 
sending an

2. Choose Invite People to Join Project from the pop-up menu.
 
 A prompt, like the one shown in Figure 3-4, appears.
 
3. Click the Create E-Mail Invitation button in the confirmation dialog.
 
 A special invitation mail message, as shown in Figure 3-5, opens. When 
an invitee receives the invitation, she can click the yellow bar that has 
the Click Here to Subscribe to the Shared Project [Project Name] link. 
Clicking this link allows your invitee to associate her Entourage Project 
Center with your shared project.

You can send invitations to people who don’t have Entourage, but they can’t 
subscribe fully to a project. They can only share project documents with 
their file system by manually using the project Watch Folder.
New button
 
 The New button on the lower toolbar has a pop-up menu, as shown in Figure 3-6.
Automatically associate a new item with your project by choosing from these 
options:
 
✦ Event: Create a new Calendar event.
 
✦ Task: Create a new task.

Creating a Gantt Chart
 
✦ Message: Create a new e-mail message.
 
✦ File: Open the Add a File dialog, in which you can navigate or use 
Spotlight to select files to add to your project.
 
✦ Contact: Add a new contact to your Entourage contacts. The contact is 
associated with your project.
 
✦ Note: Add a project-related note.
Add button
 
 When you click the Add button on the lower toolbar, a pop-up menu 
appears, offering the same choices as the New button’s pop-up menu (which 
we discuss in the preceding section). The difference is that instead of creat-
ing a new item, you’re presented with a mini-viewer that displays all your 
existing items that fit into the option you choose from the pop-up menu (see 
Figure 3-6). By clicking the Add button, you can add an existing item to your 
project.
Say that you recently received an e-mail that you want to add to your project. 
To do so, click the Add button and then choose Message from the pop-up 
menu that appears. The Add Mail dialog appears and enables you to select 
messages from your entire Mail list, as shown in Figure 3-6.
 
Figure 3-6: 
Adding mail 
messages to

Creating a Gantt Chart
While we’re on the topic of scheduling, one of the popular tools that project-
oriented people like to use is a Gantt chart, which is a visual representa-
tion of the timelines associated with various aspects of your project. You 
can even use a Gantt chart to compare timelines of one or more projects. 
Although large-scale project management software generally can generate 
Gantt charts, you can create excellent Gantt charts in Microsoft Excel.

Creating a Gantt Chart
Making a very simple Gantt chart
A simple Gantt chart consists of colored cells. If you use Excel to create a 
Gantt chart, you can take advantage of the Fill color picker, which you can 
float anywhere on the screen, as shown in Figure 3-7. Follow these steps to 
float the Fill color picker:
 
1. Open Excel
 
 A new, blank worksheet appears.
 
2. In the Formatting Palette, click the disclosure triangle next to the 
Borders and Shading section to display it.
 
 
 If the Formatting Palette isn’t visible, click the Toolbox button on the 
Standard toolbar.
 
 3. In the Shading area, click the Color button, and at the top of the Fill 
color picker that appears, click the dotted lines.
 
4. Type column names and row labels, as shown in Figure 3-8.
 
 Column names in a Gantt chart are usually dates, and row labels are usu-
ally project tasks.
 
 In Figure 3-8, the grid lines are turned off. To hide gridlines, in the 
Formatting Palette’s Page Setup section, deselect the Gridlines check 
boxes.
 
5. Drag your mouse over cells and click different colors on the Fill color 
picker under the dates appropriate for each task.

Unfortunately, Excel 2008 doesn’t support Visual Basic for Applications. 
Many excellent add-ins can make Gantt charts, but none of them work in 
Office 2008. But now you have something to look forward to in the next 
version of Office for Mac. Meanwhile, you can manually create detailed 
Gantt charts by following the instructions given on Jon Peltier’s Web site. 
Although the instructions are Windows-centric, you can follow the steps that 
Excel MVP Jon Peltier outlines on this Web page and adapt them to work 
for you in Excel 2008 for Mac: www.peltiertech.com/Excel/Charts/

Project Details
In This Chapter
✓ Mining project mail
✓ Following your project files
✓ Speeding up Project Center
✓ Finding files in Project Gallery
✓ Chilling with project contacts
✓ Avoiding Clippings
✓ Taking notes
✓ Working with the amazing Project Palette
A
ctivities related to project e-mail and contacts are easy to watch over 
in Project Center. Managing the files that are associated with a project 
doesn’t require a lot of work because Project Center keeps tabs on every-
thing for you. In this chapter, you see that Project Center’s e-mail, contacts, 
and notes work very similarly to the regular Entourage interface. But we 
point out the special differences that Project Center offers. We try to sat-
isfy your curiosity about Clippings, and then show off the Project Center’s 
crowning achievement: the Project Palette.
Viewing Project Mail
Take a peek at Project Center’s Mail tab, as shown in Figure 4-1. You see 
hardly any difference at all between this tab and the Entourage Mail applica-
tion, except for the lack of mailboxes!
The messages that you see in the messages list have been previously associ-
ated with the project you’re currently working with. If messages reside in 
different folders, they still show up on Project Center’s Mail tab as long as 
you associate these messages with your project.

766
Watching your Project’s Files

Mail tab

Messages list
 
 On the Mail tab, the New buttons on the Standard toolbar and bottom tool-
bar do the same thing: They open a new e-mail message that’s associated 
with your project. In Figure 4-1, we chose to view the messages list without a 
Preview pane, but you can select a different Preview setting from the View 
menu on the menu bar, if you want. To change the column headings, right-
click or Control-click the column names.
Watching your Project’s Files
Project Center’s Files tab is a nifty file browser. The Files tab, as shown in 
Figure 4-2, displays all the files in the Finder Watch Folder — shared files 
first, followed by files in your hard drive’s local project file folder (which 
aren’t shared). The local (not-shared) folder was created when you desig-
nated your project as a place to store your project’s files. You also have 
the option of moving those files to the Finder Watch Folder when you begin 
sharing your project. Even if you choose to move all your files to the shared 
Finder Watch Folder, the local folder still exists. Of course, if a folder’s 
empty, you don’t see any files for that folder.
 
 If you aren’t logged in to your network, a dialog may appear, prompting you 
to enter user authentication information when you click Project Center’s 
Files tab. In the Project Center Files title bar, you see a Refresh button that 
you rarely, if ever, need to use to refresh the list of files. The list refreshes 
automatically whenever you do anything on the Files tab, so you probably 
don’t ever need to click Refresh.

Click triangle to see file names.
Shared file icon
Folder Watch folder
A disclosure triangle appears just to the left of the Entourage Watch Folder 
icon in the Files list. Click the disclosure triangle to see a list of the files 
contained in the Finder Watch Folder. In the Files list, you see a directory of 
all files currently associated with the project you selected. If you’re sharing 
this project, the files listed under the Finder Watch Folder are in the shared 
folder on the file server (refer to Figure 4-2).
 
 Files that are located in the local file folder for your project don’t have the 
orange Shared icon. If you don’t have a shared Finder Watch Folder in the 
project, all the files listed are located in the local file folder for your project.
If you do have a shared Finder Watch Folder in your project, you see a 
Shared folder icon in the list with a small orange icon indicating that it’s a 
shared item. The orange icon appears by the filenames of shared items.
 
Besides Office file formats, Project Center’s Files tab can handle any file 
type. You’re not limited to Office files. You can manage PDF, Quark Express, 
CAD (Computer Aided Design) files — you name it! When you work with files 
in the Files list, you can work with more than one file at a time. Select mul-
tiple files by holding down the Ô key while you click filenames.
 
The Files tab doesn’t work with subfolders. If you create subfolders in your 
Finder Watch Folder with Mac OS X Finder or Windows Explorer, the Files 
tab ignores the subfolders and all files contained in them. Mac OS X Finder 
does allow subfolders and their files to be shared with others, but they don’t 
appear in Project Center’s Files tab. To avoid confusion, don’t use subfolders 
in Finder Watch Folders.

768
Watching your Project’s Files
Adding files to the Files list
 
 When you add a file to the Files list, it appears in the shared Finder Watch 
Folder. You can add to the Files list by using any of the following methods:
 
✦ Drag files into the Files list from any Finder window.
 
✦ Drag files into the Files list from the Desktop.
 
✦ Click the green Add button, as shown in the margin. The Add a File 
dialog appears. Navigate or use Spotlight to select a file that you want to 
add, and then click the Open button to add your file to the project.
Project Center asks your permission before moving a file into the shared 
Finder Watch Folder.
Sharing a file
To share a file that’s currently not shared, you first must set up a shared 
Finder Watch Folder. We discuss how to share a project and create a Finder 
Watch Folder in Chapter 1 of this minibook. You can find files that you’re not 
sharing located in your project’s local file folder, which was created when 
you created your project. If you add files to your project before you start 
sharing and opt not to share those files already present when you turn shar-
ing on, the files remain in the local folder and appear without the sharing 
icon in the Files tab’s Files list.
 
 You can take one of two approaches to share a file. Taking either approach 
moves the selected file from the local project file folder (not shared) into the 
Finder Watch Folder (shared). The shared file icon (as shown in the margin) 
appears next to the file when the operation is complete. We outline the two 
ways that you can share a file in the following sections.
Sharing a file — Method 1
 
 1. Select the file you want to share and then click the Share button in the 
bottom toolbar.
 
2. Choose Share from the pop-up menu that appears.
Sharing a file — Method 2
 
1. Right-click or Control-click the file you want to share.
 
2. From the pop-up menu that appears, choose Share.

Watching your Project’s Files
 
1. On the Files tab, right-click or Control-click the filename in the Files list.
 
2. From the pop-up menu that appears, choose Do Not Share File.
 
 The file is moved to the local file folder for your project and appears in 
the Files list below the shared files.
Opening a file
 
 To open a file, do any of the following actions in the Files list:
 
 
✦ Double-click a file in the list.
 
✦ Right-click or Control-click a file in the list, and then select Open from 
the pop-up menu that appears.
 
✦ Select a file and then click the Open button on the Standard toolbar.
 
✦ Select a file and then choose File➪Open.
 
✦ Select a file and then press ÔO.
Removing a file from a project
 
 When you remove a file from a project, the file isn’t deleted. The file is 
removed from the Watch Folder, and either placed on your computer’s 
Desktop or returned to the unshared local file folder for your project.
To remove files from a project, follow these steps:
 
1. Select a file in the list and then click the red Remove button in the 
bottom toolbar.
 
 A Remove Files from Project dialog appears.
 
2. Select Yes.
 
 The Remove Files from Project dialog closes.
 
3. Select the Overview tab of Project Center.
 
 4. Select the Finder Watch Folder.
 
 
 The Finder Watch Folder opens. In this folder, you can use Mac OS X 
Finder to drag the file to the Desktop or other Finder location.
Sending files via e-mail or Microsoft Messenger
You can easily send files to anyone by using e-mail or Microsoft Messenger. 
You have to open Messenger before you can use it with this Files tab feature. 
You can send multiple files via a single e-mail, but only one file at a time via 
Messenger. You can send a file in one of two ways, which we talk about in 
the following sections.

770
Speeding Up Things
  
 Sending a file — Method 1
 
 1. Click the file in the Files list to select it and then click the Send button 
on the lower toolbar.
 
 A pop-up menu appears.
 
2. Choose either E-Mail or Messenger from the pop-up menu.
Sending a file — Method 2
 
1. Right-click or Control-click a file, as shown in Figure 4-3.
 
 A pop-up menu appears.
 
2. From the pop-up menu, select the option you want to use.
 
 You can choose from these two options:
 
• Send as Mail Attachment
 
• Send to Microsoft Messenger Contact
 
3. Select a contact from the pop-up’s submenu.
 
Figure 4-3:

Speeding Up Things
 
If you have your Finder Watch Folder on a network drive and your network 
connection isn’t gigabit speed, expect delays, called latency, when you use 
Project Center’s Files tab. If you connect to a server with a virtual private 
network (VPN) on a DSL or cable connection, expect quite a bit of delay 
because these connections are slow. Unfortunately, we haven’t found a way 
to tell Entourage to not refresh the list so often. It seems that no matter what 
you do, while you have the Files tab open, the Files list refreshes, which can 
take time. We chose Help➪Send Feedback about Entourage and requested 
Microsoft change this behavior. If you also send feedback, chances are good 
Microsoft will improve the overall speed of the Files tab considerably.

Associating with Project Contacts
Finding Files in Project Gallery
 
From any application, you can visit Project Gallery by choosing File➪Project 
Gallery. On Project Gallery’s Project Center tab, you can open any docu-
ments that are associated with projects, as shown in Figure 4-4.
 
Figure 
4-4: Using 
Project 
Gallery 
to open 
Project 
Center files.
 
Associating with Project Contacts
Independent of the list of people that you currently share a project with is 
the list of contacts from your Entourage Address Book that you designate 
as associated with your project. Select a contact to display that contact’s 
information in the Files tab window. You have the following buttons at your 
disposal:
 
 
✦ Add: To associate contacts with a project, simply click the Add button 
on the bottom toolbar. Figure 4-5 shows the Contacts tab of the Project 
Center window. We describe the Add button in Chapter 3 of this mini-
book.
 
 
✦ New: The New buttons on both the Standard and bottom toolbars do the 
same thing — they open the New Contact input form. (See Book V, 
Chapter 3 for more about managing contacts.)
 
 
✦ Messenger: The Messenger button on the bottom toolbar is a fast, easy 
way to create and manage a group of contacts in MSN Messenger. If you 
aren’t signed in already, you can click the Messenger button to sign into 
MSN Messenger. To create a new MSN Messenger group from the con-
tacts associated with your project, click the Messenger button and then 
choose Create Messenger Group (see Figure 4-6). After you create an 
MSN Messenger group for your project, the other two actions — Remove 
Messenger Group and Update Messenger Group — become available.

Storing and Using Clippings
When you open Project Center’s Clippings tab, you’re presented with an 
interesting interface. The Clippings interface looks like you can permanently 
store anything you want from the Scrapbook in your project. Unfortunately, 
that’s not the case. When you add a clipping to your project, it’s not actually 
added to your project. The clipping stays within the Toolbox’s Scrapbook. 
If you remove something from the Scrapbook, you also remove it from 
Clippings.
 
 You can be in Word, Excel, or PowerPoint, working on something that’s not 
related to your project in any way — yet, you can delete something from the 
Scrapbook that you had stored in one of your project’s Clippings collections 
and not even realize that you deleted a project clipping. Worse, you might 
decide to clear the Scrapbook by clicking the readily accessible Delete 
button and choosing Delete All from the pop-up menu that appears. Clearing 
the Scrapbook deletes all the clippings from all your projects, and you might 
not even know you did it! We recommend that you avoid the Clippings tab.

Working with the Project Palette
Working with the Project Palette
 
 In Book I, Chapter 4, we discuss the dazzling Project Palette (see Figure 4-8). 
Here, we want to showcase one of the most incredible pieces of screen real 
estate that we know about. You can open the Project Palette in several ways:
 
✦ Choose View➪Toolbox➪Project Palette to open the Project Palette in 
Word, Excel, or PowerPoint.
 
✦ Under the Toolbox subheading, select Project Palette.
 
✦ Click the Toolbox button on the Standard toolbar and then click the 
Projects button (see Figure 4-9).
This amazing palette (as shown in Figure 4-8) enables you to manage your 
projects with almost every tool we mention in this minibook.
 
Figure 4-8: 
The entire 
Project 
Palette.
 
Because this book is, after all, an easy go-to reference manual, the most help-
ful thing we can do is to break the palette into sections so that you can see 
what each of the incredible array of features available does. Starting from 
the top . . .
Right-click or Control-click the Project Palette heading area to switch from one 
project to another, or even start a brand-new project, as shown in Figure 4-9.

own windows by clicking the New Task button.
The Project Palette’s Recent Items section is another handy area. The Recent 
Items section has a More link that takes you to Entourage. However, you can 
also customize this block of the palette. If you click the gray bar near the top 
of this section of the palette, you can switch the view instantly to any of the 
options shown in the pop-up menu in Figure 4-12. You can click the Go to
