KEITH DEVLIN: Introduction to Mathematical Thinking (Winter 2014)
ASSIGNMENT 8
1. Prove or disprove the claim that there are integers m, n such that m2 +mn+n2 is a perfect square.
2. Prove or disprove the claim that for any positive integer m there is a positive integer n such that
mn + 1 is a perfect square.
3. Prove that there is a quadratic f(n) = n2 + bn + c, with positive integers coeﬃcients b, c, such
that f(n) is composite (i.e, not prime) for all positive integers n, or else prove that the statement
is false.
4. Prove that if every even natural number greater than 2 is a sum of two primes (the Goldbach
Conjecture), then every odd natural number greater than 5 is a sum of three primes.
5. Use the method of induction to prove that the sum of the ﬁrst n odd numbers is equal to n2.
6. The notation
n
X
i=1
ai
(or
Pn
i=1 ai)
is a common abbreviation for the sum
a1 + a2 + a3 + . . . + an
For instance,
n
X
r=1
r2
denotes the sum
12 + 22 + 32 + . . . + n2
Prove by induction that:
∀n ∈N :
n
X
r=1
r2 = 1
6n(n + 1)(2n + 1)
OPTIONAL PROBLEMS
1. In the lecture we used induction to prove the general theorem
1 + 2 + . . . + n = 1
2n(n + 1)
There is an alternative proof that does not use induction, famous because Gauss used the key idea
to solve a “busywork” arithmetic problem his teacher gave to the class when he was a small child
at school. The teacher asked the class to calculate the sum of the ﬁrst hundred natural numbers.
Gauss noted that if
1 + 2 + . . . + 100 = N
then you can reverse the order of the addition and the answer will be the same:
100 + 99 + . . . + 1 = N.
So by adding those two equations, you get
101 + 101 + . . . + 101 = 2N
1

and since there are 100 terms in the sum, this can be written as
100 · 101 = 2N
and hence
N = 1
2(100 · 101) = 5, 050.
Generalize Gauss’s idea to prove the theorem without recourse to the method of induction.
2. Prove that for any ﬁnite collection of points in the plane, not all collinear, there is a triangle having
three of the points as its vertices, which contains none of the other points in its interior.
3. Prove the following by induction:
(a) 4n −1 is divisible by 3.
(b) (n + 1)! > 2n+3 for all n ≥5.
(c) ∀n ∈N :
n
X
r=1
r.r! = (n + 1)! −1
NOTE: n! is the factorial function: n! = n(n −1)(n −2) . . . 3.2.1. So 2! = 2, 3! = 3 × 2 = 6,
4! = 4 × 3 × 2 = 24, etc.
