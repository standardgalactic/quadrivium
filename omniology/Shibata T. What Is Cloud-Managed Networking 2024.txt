Chapter 1. What Is Cloud-Managed
Networking?
Networks form the indispensable backbone of modern
organizations. However, traditional network management
practices often introduce operational complexities and
constraints that impede business agility. The challenges include
distributed configurations, time-consuming processes, limited
visibility into network health, and increased vulnerability to
security threats.
Ensuring optimal network performance requires a high degree
of specialized expertise. Network engineers are tasked with
configuring and troubleshooting intricate hardware and
software components. The constant evolution of security
threats demands continual vigilance, a burden that falls on the
IT teams responsible for updating and patching network
devices on time.
These inherent challenges of traditional networking models are
exacerbated in modern IT environments. The proliferation of
remote workers, cloud-based services, and distributed branch
offices necessitates an adaptable and centrally manageable
network. Traditional network infrastructure often struggles to

provide the scalability, flexibility, and unified visibility required
to support these dynamic needs.
Cloud-managed networking (CMN) offers a transformative
solution designed to overcome the limitations of conventional
approaches. Organizations can achieve unprecedented
operational simplicity and efficiency by migrating significant
portions of management functionality to a hosted cloud
platform. This approach promises streamlined network
deployment, real-time network performance and security
visibility, and a more cost-effective model for meeting evolving
business requirements.
This revolution comes with other, underlying changes: cloud
manager APIs that observability platforms can leverage,
streaming telemetry between devices and cloud-based
managers, and constant innovation. A critical and
transformational change is sweeping through networks,
bringing networking into the cloud era.
It is important to note that CMN is not about hosting virtual
network devices in the cloud where they perform network
switching and routing functions. Rather, CMN is focused on
managing any network resource, physical or virtual, from a
cloud-based service. CMN is also not defined by new business

models for network equipment, such as providing equipment as
part of a subscription service. However, because subscription
equipment services focus on ease of management, they usually
include CMN.
This report delves into CMN, exploring its significance and
advantages over traditional approaches to management and
monitoring.
Cloud-Managed Networking
With cloud-managed networking, some or all network
management functions are moved to a cloud-based platform.
This allows for centralized control of and visibility into your
network infrastructure, regardless of physical location
(Figure 1-1).

Figure 1-1. A cloud-managed network
A single software service can manage all network devices. Its
primary capabilities are configuration and monitoring.
Examples of cloud management networking include:
HPE Aruba Networking
Cisco Meraki
Fortinet FortiGate Cloud
The long arc of network management is transitioning from
device-by-device management, such as SSH terminal/CLI
sessions for each device, to a centralized management solution.

CMN continues that trend, extending the paradigm to cloud-
hosted management services. The underlying goal is network
management available from any screen, anywhere, at any time,
providing analysis and visibility across the entire network as
well as ease of operation—including onboarding and ongoing
use.
Configuration is improved with centralized configuration
management and zero-touch provisioning. Improvements may
include enhanced security policies, IP address allocation based
on a view of IP allocation over the entire network, wireless
parameters, and more.
CMN can be especially ideal for businesses with multiple
locations—such as retail chains, banks, and multinational
organizations—that want centralized control without replacing
their entire infrastructure.
Before Cloud-Managed Networking
The traditional on-premises approach to network management
has several inherent shortcomings:
Complexity

Configuring each network device often requires
specialized knowledge and complex command-line
interfaces, creating a steep learning curve for IT
personnel.
Manual processes
Tasks like deploying new devices, updating firmware, or
applying security patches is often time-consuming and
prone to human error.
Limited visibility
Getting a holistic view of a distributed network can be
difficult. Monitoring often involves separate tools and
siloed data.
Scaling difficulties
Accommodating growth or rapid changes means
purchasing additional hardware, which may then require
lengthy installation and configuration cycles.
The Benefits of Cloud-Managed
Networking

CMN addresses many of the pain points associated with the
traditional model. Here’s how the landscape shifts and brings
tangible benefits to organizations of all sizes:
Simplified management
Cloud-managed networks have intuitive web-based
interfaces accessible from anywhere. This reduces the
need for specialized networking expertise and
streamlines tasks.
Zero-touch provisioning
New devices can often be added automatically, receiving
pre­defined configurations from the cloud. This makes
deployment significantly faster.
Centralized visibility
Real-time dashboards comprehensively overview network
health, traffic patterns, and potential security threats.
Enhanced security
Cloud vendors typically push out security updates and
patches automatically, helping you maintain a more
assertive security posture. With consistent and
standardized policies and configurations, network devices

can get security updates and patches simultaneously,
further enhancing network security.
Scalability and agility
As a business grows, the number of networking devices
that need management increases. With CMN, network
resources can be scaled up or down on demand, aligning
with business requirements without the lead time
associated with procuring hardware. This elasticity allows
your network to multiply and support provisioning
networking devices at scale.
Streamlined operations
Centralized management, automation, and remote
troubleshooting reduce IT teams’ workloads, freeing up
resources for more strategic initiatives.
Improved flexibility
The cloud model makes expanding into new locations,
implementing temporary projects, or adjusting network
capacity easier.
Heightened network reliability

Proactive monitoring, automated updates, and a vendor-
managed infrastructure can reduce downtime and
improve overall network performance.
Improved response times
Network teams can request changes remotely in almost
real time without needing on-site interventions, resulting
in faster feedback loops, updates, and troubleshooting.
Consistency and standardization
The uniform deployment of policies and configurations
across multiple groups of devices and locations allows for
a highly consistent network, ensuring that
misconfigurations happen less frequently. This
consistency also allows for standardized, repeatable
deployments, increasing network teams’ productivity.
Robust monitoring
With a comprehensive view of network performance,
user behavior, and potential security threats from a
centralized dashboard, you no longer need to log in to
multiple dashboards based on location or device group;
everything is centralized in the cloud control plane.
Extensibility

You can opt in to additional cloud services, such as
enhanced analytics, enterprise-level support, and even
professional services maintenance, which can function as
an extension of your network team.
Financial Transformation
Cloud services transform IT costs from up-front capital
expenditure (CapEx) models to pay-as-you-go operating expense
(OpEx) models.
CMN relates to the management of network resources and thus
explicitly impacts the need to purchase, maintain, and upgrade
on-premises hardware and software dedicated to network
management. In some traditional scenarios, server hardware
has to be upgraded with more memory, for example, before a
new software version with new features can be used. This goes
away with CMN. New management features can be released
every few weeks without the networking team having to touch
anything about network management. The up-front cost of
hardware and software licenses and ongoing upgrades is
replaced with regular OpEx charges aligned with usage.

In a complementary trend, network equipment and virtual
appliances are transitioning from CapEx to OpEx/subscription
models. The relationship is that equipment provided as part of
a subscription service, such as branch wireless devices, is
almost always managed with CMN. The promise of a
subscription is an easier management experience, and CMN
meets this requirement.
Subscription-based network equipment services should not be
confused with CMN. However, they usually include CMN
(Table 1-1). CMN is applicable to both network resources that
are contained in subscription services and equipment that is
procured in traditional ways.

model will still have niche applications, cloud-managed
solutions are increasingly preferred for businesses of all sizes.
Their ease of use, flexibility, and cost benefits make them an
attractive option for organizations facing the dynamic demands
of the modern digital landscape.
As CMN matures, we can expect even more significant
innovations. Tighter integration with other cloud services,
advancements in network analytics driven by AI, and simplified
software-defined wide area networking (SD-WAN) deployment
are likely areas for continued development. The cloud is
definitively reshaping the networking world, and organizations
embracing this transformation will be well positioned to gain a
competitive advantage in future years.

Integrating CMN solutions with existing legacy systems
can be complex and time-consuming. Organizations often
have significant investments in traditional infrastructure,
and transitioning can involve compatibility issues, data
migration challenges, and the need for staff retraining.
Performance and bandwidth limitations
Moving network management functions to the cloud can
introduce latency, especially for geographically dispersed
organizations. Ensuring sufficient bandwidth and
optimizing network performance can be challenging,
particularly in areas with limited connectivity options.
Change management
Transitioning to CMN involves changes in processes and
potentially organizational structure. Resistance from
employees accustomed to traditional networking setups
can hinder adoption and must be overcome with effective
change management strategies.

providers have robust disaster recovery plans.
Hybrid IT and Cloud-Managed
Networking
Many networking teams find themselves working in hybrid IT
environments, as their companies have not fully migrated to
the public cloud. In addition, networking inherently involves
physical devices at branches and other locations, even if the
company is not operating data centers. Although hybrid IT has
benefits, its additional complexity warrants dedicated attention.
What Is Hybrid IT?
Hybrid IT (Figure 2-1) is an approach to IT infrastructure that
combines a mix of:

On-premises resources
These include traditional data centers or servers you own
and manage within your physical location.
Private cloud
Private cloud resources (e.g., servers, storage, networking)
are dedicated solely to your organization. These might be
in your own data center or hosted by a provider.
Public cloud
Public cloud resources are procured from major
providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft
Azure, or Google Cloud Platform. These are shared with
other customers but offer high scalability and a pay-as-
you-go cost model.
The key to a successful implementation of hybrid IT is that
these components are designed to work together seamlessly,
allowing you to place workloads in the environments best
suited to them.

Figure 2-1. An example hybrid IT infrastructure
Why Hybrid IT?
There are several benefits of hybrid IT, including:
Flexibility
Match workloads to the ideal environment based on
performance, security, or cost needs. This gives you more
options than relying solely on one type of infrastructure.
Control
Keep sensitive data or systems with strict compliance
needs on-premises while leveraging the cloud for other
workloads.

Cost optimization
The public cloud is great for scalability and handling
unpredictable traffic spikes, but running certain stable
workloads in-house might be more cost-effective.
Gradual cloud migration
Shift to the cloud at your own pace, testing and migrating
workloads over time instead of using an all-or-nothing
approach.
Leverage existing investments
If your data center has recently been refreshed, hybrid IT
lets you maximize that investment while still taking
advantage of the cloud.
Hybrid IT Considerations
As mentioned earlier, hybrid IT requires more attention to
detail than other setups. It’s important to consider:
Complexity
Managing a hybrid environment can be more
operationally complex than managing a single-location or
cloud-only approach.

Integration
Ensuring that data and applications work seamlessly
across on-premises and cloud systems requires careful
planning and tools.
Visibility
Monitoring performance and security across a hybrid
landscape might require dedicated tools or centralized
dashboards.
Skills
Your IT team may need a mix of traditional data center
expertise and cloud skills to be successful with hybrid IT.
Cloud-Managed Networking for Hybrid IT
Hybrid cloud and cloud-managed networking complement each
other, offering a cohesive approach to modern IT challenges.
Hybrid cloud environments can be more effectively managed
and optimized with CMN solutions. Here’s how they work
together:
Unified management across environments

CMN can span across the hybrid cloud, offering unified
network management regardless of whether resources
are in the public cloud, private cloud, or on-premises.
Enhanced performance and efficiency
CMN tools can optimize the performance of hybrid cloud
applications by managing traffic flows, balancing loads,
and reducing latency.
Improved security posture
A cloud-managed network solution can enforce consistent
security policies across the hybrid cloud environment,
ensuring secure data transfers between cloud services
and on-premises resources.
Seamless connectivity and integration
CMN facilitates the seamless integration of public and
private clouds, ensuring reliable connectivity and smooth
operation of applications and services, regardless of
where they reside.
In summary, while hybrid cloud offers a flexible and secure
approach to enterprise IT infrastructure, CMN provides the
tools and capabilities to manage this complex environment

efficiently. Together, they enable businesses to be more agile,
secure, and competitive in today’s digital landscape.
Cloud-Managed Networking
Adoption
The rise of the cloud created the opportunity to invest in a long-
term, scalable solution that requires fewer internal resources.
CMN is increasingly being adopted by smaller and midsized
enterprises. Since CMN provides a manageable solution that
does not require dedicated staff, it is a good choice for SMEs,
which often lack the IT and infrastructure staff that big
companies possess.
CMN is also widely adopted by big enterprises, largely due to its
scalability, centralized control, flexibility, and security.
Practical Implementation of Cloud-
Managed Networking
As adoption of CMN increases, the practicalities of
implementation are as critical as the conceptual considerations.
This is particularly evident when migrating traditional network

management systems to CMN solutions. For example, most
large enterprises using Cisco use Cisco Prime. To illustrate such
a migration, we will use a scenario in which an organization
migrates from Cisco Prime to Cisco Meraki.
Transitioning to a CMN system like Cisco Meraki offers
advantages such as long-term cost savings and bolstered
security. A successful migration depends on adequately
upskilling the company’s network engineers and establishing
processes that leverage the strengths of the CMN model. Once
these milestones are achieved, network challenges can be
addressed more effectively, allowing for more efficient and
secure networking.
There are several key challenges you’ll need to keep in mind:
Skills gap
Traditional network skills do not automatically translate
into expertise in cloud technologies, including CMN. For
example, Cisco Prime relies heavily on local command-
line configurations. Migration to Meraki, which utilizes a
centralized control plane GUI, requires climbing a steep
learning curve. A persistent skills gap can lead to
misconfigurations or the underutilization of key features.

Configuration variances
Network configurations are implemented differently in
Cisco Prime and in Meraki. For example, quality of service
settings, VLAN configurations, and access control lists
have different implementation nuances.
Security transition
Prime has only non–cloud security features, while Meraki
has robust cloud security features such as cloud-based
threat detection, encryption, and access control
mechanisms. Adopting and correctly configuring these
features may prove challenging.
Data security concerns
Moving to CMN raises concerns about data security.
Ensuring segmentation, end-to-end encryption, and
compliance with regulatory requirements is of paramount
importance during migration.
Licensing and support
Prime and Meraki have different licensing models.
Transitioning will involve revisiting licensing and support
agreements.

How to Choose the Correct Technology
When modernizing your network, the starting point is always
to understand your organization’s specific needs. For instance, a
business with a heavy data load, such as a media company,
would benefit from Cisco’s Meraki MX because of its robust
bandwidth management. Alternatively, an event management
company that frequently changes its network configuration
might find the adaptability of HPE Aruba’s SD-Branch more
suitable.
In the CMN landscape, Cisco, Fortinet, and HPE each bring its
own strengths. Cisco’s Meraki has a user-friendly interface,
scalability, and extensive cloud management capabilities that
are ideal for those who prioritize ease of use and
comprehensive control. Fortinet’s FortiGate stands out in
security, making it a top choice for industries such as finance or
healthcare. Finally, HPE’s Aruba may be a good choice when
you need flexibility and focus on edge technologies. Aruba
devices are often deployed when you have IoT devices that
require flexibility and mobility for the business to securely
connect and get insights from a range of data sources.
The choice among Cisco, Fortinet, and HPE for your CMN
solution hinges on balancing existing infrastructure, cost,

scalability, security, and performance:
Integration and compatibility
Does your current network infrastructure include
hardware from specific vendors? How will the new
technology integrate with it? For a network with existing
Cisco hardware, opting for Meraki can make integration
seamless. However, in an environment with a mix of
different vendor equipment, Aruba’s flexible solutions can
be a game-changer, allowing for a more diverse network
setup.
Cost considerations
What is your budget for immediate implementation, and
what are the expected long-term operational costs? Cost is
always a crucial factor. While Cisco’s solutions might seem
pricier up front, they often offer a lower total cost of
ownership due to their durability and ease of
management. Fortinet, meanwhile, might suit those
looking for budget-friendly options without having to
compromise on security features.
Scalability and future growth

Ask yourself, how much data do you need to handle?
What are the peak load times? For media companies and
other organizations with heavy data loads, Cisco Meraki,
with its scalability and robust bandwidth management, is
ideal.
A growing business needs a network that grows with it.
Both Meraki and Aruba excel in scalability, but your
choice might depend on the specifics of your expansion
plans. Aruba is particularly adept at accommodating
rapid and diverse device management needs, while Cisco
stands out for its enterprise-grade scalability, robust
bandwidth management, and low latency performance.
Security
Reflect on what level of security your network operations
require. Are you in an industry with stringent data
security needs? In an era where cyber threats loom large,
the robust security features of Fortinet’s solutions, such as
intrusion prevention, stateful packet inspection, and
application control, can provide peace of mind, especially
in data-sensitive sectors such as banking and healthcare.
Real-world trials

Before finalizing your decision, consider conducting pilot
tests with selected technologies. Real-world testing can
offer invaluable insights that specification sheets and
sales pitches cannot match.

Chapter 3. Monitoring Cloud-
Managed Networking
While adopting cloud-managed networking is itself a significant
change, CMN also tends to drive other changes in the
organization’s technology environment. For example,
organizations often complement CMN by making greater use of
streaming telemetry and integrations with network managers.
Underlying Changes Driven by Cloud-
Managed Networking
Organizations that adopt CMN often also begin collecting data
in new ways. For example, streaming telemetry, which is
available on many devices but rarely used, is becoming
increasingly popular with CMN because it is effective for cloud-
based management.
Integration with a centralized network manager, such as Cisco
Catalyst Center or Aruba Central, is also growing in popularity.
Such integrations provide significant advantages, but existing
tools may continue to support the option to collect directly from

network resources as well. Whether to integrate and when are
key considerations for networking teams.
We’ll explore both of these essential changes in the following
sections.
Streaming Telemetry
Streaming telemetry is a network-monitoring approach in which
devices continuously push real-time data (e.g., metrics, state
information, events) to a central collector, often using a
publish–​sub⁠scribe model. This contrasts with traditional polling
methods, like Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), in
which data is requested at intervals. Streaming telemetry
provides several advantages:
Real-time visibility
Streaming telemetry provides near-instant insights into
network health and performance. You can detect
problems as they occur, not minutes or even hours later.
Granular data
Streaming telemetry often captures a broader range of
data points at higher frequencies than do polling

methods. This enables more detailed analysis for
troubleshooting or capacity planning.
Proactive problem resolution
Real-time alerts about traffic spikes, interface errors, and
security events let you take corrective action before such
events escalate into significant outages.
Streaming telemetry can be pushed to any destination.
However, one use case specifically applies to CMN: pushing
telemetry to a network manager.
As Figure 3-1 shows, Cisco Catalyst Center receives data pushed
to it from devices using streaming telemetry. Cisco Catalyst
Center then provides the telemetry data to other observability
solutions through its intent-based API. While Figure 3-1 shows
wireless controllers and access points, Cisco Catalyst Center
supports a range of Cisco equipment, including switches and
routers.

Figure 3-1. Streaming telemetry with Cisco Catalyst Center
Integrating with a Network Manager
With additional tooling capabilities, such as multivendor
observability, you can realize many benefits from integrating
with network managers like Cisco Catalyst Center and Aruba
Central. These include:
Faster device discovery
Faster time to observability

Device discovery helps other tools work faster because the
network manager has already completed this task, meaning
that additional collectors or agents do not have to be deployed
to do discovery.
There are tradeoffs, though. The integration API provided by
the network manager may not offer the same granularity of
information as does regular device polling. On the other hand,
alerts and updates may be more timely. Depending on the tool,
support for devices that directly poll the data may need to be
retained. If so, it should be capable of operating at the same
time as integrations with network managers.
It is important to note that as equipment vendors focus more on
streaming telemetry, their support for SNMP-provided data may
decline. For this reason, it is essential that tooling support
integrations with new cloud-era managers. This is true whether
they are operating on-premises or as a software as a service
(SaaS).
Monitoring Cloud-Managed
Networks

As discussed in Chapter 2, hybrid IT infrastructure usually
means that workloads can simultaneously be on-premises and
in one or more private and/or public clouds, and more
commonly they migrate between on-prem and cloud as needed.
The more systems one has to interface with to get the “full
picture,” the more complicated the infrastructure is.
Businesses must consider hybrid monitoring solutions that
operate seamlessly across both on-premises and cloud
environments. These solutions should provide comprehensive
network performance and security monitoring, as well as
facilitate effective data exchange and operational stability
between on-premises and the cloud.
Key features for effective hybrid monitoring must support the
following data types:
SNMP
Available in both CMN and traditional networking devices
REST API
Available in both CMN and traditional networking devices
Streaming telemetry
Increasingly used by CMN devices

Webhooks
An option for CMN devices
Because hybrid IT infrastructure is highly interdependent,
monitoring solutions must bridge the gap between the cloud
and on-premises components. This requires tracking the
performance and stability of each component and
understanding how all elements interact with each other and
behave as a whole. An integrated monitoring solution is crucial
for detecting and resolving issues arising from the dynamics of
an architecture that spans the on-premises and cloud
environments.
To understand CMN monitoring at a high level, it is crucial to
identify the scope and scale of the network you’re monitoring.
This includes understanding the geographic distribution of
network resources, the scale of operations, and the variety of
devices and services integrated into CMN. Recognizing these
factors will help you tailor a monitoring plan that aligns with
the specific needs and challenges of the network.
CMN monitoring must be able to continuously monitor the
network’s performance and availability over time. It must
effectively track the network’s state (status), statistics
(performance metrics), and events (significant occurrences or

changes in the system) to provide a holistic view of the
network’s health. This multidimensional monitoring ensures
that the network operates optimally.
The Key Components of a Cloud-Managed
Networking Monitoring Solution
CMN represents a shift from monitoring individual devices to
establishing a detection-and-response model of the entire
network, allowing for a more holistic approach to monitoring
networks. As shown in Figure 3-2, monitoring in CMN moves
away from getting every telemetry data point from every device
and toward alerting only if there is an issue with a device (e.g.,
the network switch fans).

Figure 3-2. Example of monitoring the network switch fans in a traditional system and
with CMN
As networks transition to CMN, the relevance of device-specific
monitoring decreases. This makes it necessary to reevaluate
critical components of network monitoring. A centralized
monitoring solution needs the following elements:

Customer subscription
Be aware of when the CMN subscription will expire.
Unlike in traditional networking management, your CMN
devices will stop working once your subscription runs
out.
Broad vendor and device support
The capability to ingest various data types, including
metrics, logs/event flows, and configurations, from a
diverse group of CMN devices is key. This extensive data
support facilitates a deeper and more nuanced
comprehension of network functions.
Cloud platform monitoring
You should be able to monitor the configuration changes
of the tenant in CMN. For example, if someone changes
something on the device configurations of Cisco Meraki,
these changes need to be monitored and added to the
dashboard. This brings us to another key component.
Customizable dashboards and reporting tools
Customizable dashboards and reporting tools are
essential for visualizing network data and gaining
actionable insights. These tools should offer the flexibility

to tailor views and reports according to specific
requirements, ensuring that network administrators have
the information they need at their fingertips.
Robust security and compliance monitoring
Given the critical importance of security in CMN,
monitoring solutions must include robust security and
compliance features. These features must be able to detect
and respond to security threats in real time and ensure
that the network remains compliant with relevant
regulations and standards.
Advanced monitoring
The adoption of advanced monitoring tools can support
CMN operations. Organizations must stay ahead of the
evolving networking landscape to maintain optimal
performance and reliability of their cloud-managed
networks. Because network data is often large and needs
to be processed and correlated, advanced monitoring
technologies are needed.
Embracing Advanced Monitoring
Technologies

The use of advanced monitoring technologies such as cloud-
based network analytics, autogenerated topology mapping,
machine learning–based anomaly detection, and data
forecasting can lead to better CMN monitoring outcomes.
These advanced monitoring technologies enable organizations
to manage and analyze large volumes of network data
efficiently, identify potential issues before they escalate, and
automate response mechanisms for rapid problem resolution.
Additionally, these solutions can better integrate with cloud
APIs and other digital transformation technologies, ensuring
seamless operation in a hybrid cloud environment. We explore
several of these here:
Dynamic device discovery
Dynamic device discovery is an essential monitoring
capability in CMN. The deployment of CMN devices is
commonly streamlined through zero-touch provisioning
(ZTP). ZTP simplifies network expansion and
maintenance. Devices are shipped directly to sites and,
upon arrival, plugged in without any need for specialized
network knowledge. Initiating setup is simple; it involves
basic steps like connecting cables to designated ports and
waiting for a confirmation signal, such as a solid green
LED, to indicate successful activation.

However, dynamic discovery is needed to monitor these
devices. Dynamic discovery enables us to discover and
monitor new devices as they come online or to find an
entire enterprise or select sites without deploying a
collector at each site.
Cloud-based network analytics
Networking engineers often debate whether network
analytics should be performed in the cloud or locally.
Placing the analytics engine in the cloud offers access to
more processing power and communications with other
networks. Cloud-hosted analytics also benefit from up-to-
date algorithms and crowdsourced data.
Autogenerated topology mapping
Topology mapping is the visual representation of
relationships among elements within a communications
network.  In CMN, where network devices can be
provisioned and deprovisioned at a moment’s notice,
topology mapping is absolutely critical. Since networks in
CMN are extensive, autogenerated or dynamic discovery
is essential. Viewing individual connections should be
additive, and visualizations should be done on the fly to
aid discovery.

Anomaly detection and data forecasting
Anomaly detection identifies data that does not conform to
expected (or usual) patterns.  Anomaly detection systems
employ machine learning algorithms to recognize and
learn from established data patterns. This can enable the
system to identify and flag anomalies in resource
behavior, providing insights that can prevent issues from
escalating. For example, triggering automatic alerts when
data deviates from expected patterns and visually
emphasizing forecasted data ranges on graphs makes it
easy to spot any data that deviates from the norm.
Data forecasting allows you to predict future trends for
your monitored infrastructure, using past performance as
a basis.  The process involves identifying anomalies and
missing data and then applying a capacity-trending
algorithm to identify the best-fit model for the existing
data. You then use this model to calculate future trends.
Key Metrics for Cloud-Managed
Networking
When it comes to CMN, monitoring key metrics is essential to
ensure network health and performance. CMN environments

typically include routers/firewalls, switches, and access points
(APs), each with specific key performance indicators that must
be tracked.
Router/firewalls
For routers and firewalls, monitoring focuses on several critical
aspects:
Status of LAN and WAN ports
Ensure that these are operational and identify any
connectivity issues.
WAN metrics
This includes monitoring the percentage of WAN
utilization, packet loss, jitter, and latency. Tracking these
metrics is crucial for maintaining optimal network
performance.
Failover events
Monitoring the failover from one ISP to another or from
one port to another helps to ensure the continuity and
reliability of network connectivity.
NetFlow data

Analysis of network traffic flow enhances understanding
of traffic patterns, bandwidth usage, and potential
bottlenecks.
Security event
Particularly for firewalls, monitoring every transaction is
vital for security and threat detection.
Access points
Key metrics for APs include:
Network health and availability
This includes the status and performance of service set
identifiers (SSIDs), wireless networks, and virtual APs.
Radio performance and utilization
It is necessary to monitor the performance and utilization
of each radio frequency band (2.4Ghz, 5Ghz, and 6Ghz for
the newer 6E standard).
User count
Tracking the number of users per radio frequency and
per SSID is crucial for capacity planning and
troubleshooting.

Packet loss
Identify packet loss to ensure data integrity and network
efficiency.
Association and authentication issues
Monitor for any issues in device connection and network
access.
Switches
For switches, key metrics to monitor include:
Port status
Monitor the state of each switch port to detect any failures
or disconnections.
Packet loss (discard rate)
Identifying packet loss on each port can indicate
congestion or hardware issues.
Error rate
Monitor for errors in data transmission to maintain data
integrity.
Transmission and reception statistics

Analyze the amount of data transmitted and received
through each port.
Port utilization
Understand how much capacity is being used on each port
to manage network resources effectively.
Vendor-specific metrics
Some vendors, like Cisco Meraki, might not provide traditional
metrics like CPU, memory, and disk utilization. Instead, they
offer alternative indicators, such as a health score that assesses
the overall status of network devices. These vendor-specific
metrics provide a more holistic view of device performance and
health, aligning with the organization’s needs with CMN.
Conclusion
In summary, CMN marks a significant evolution in network
management, and it demands new integrations to fully harness
its benefits. Effective CMN monitoring goes beyond traditional
methods, requiring adaptation to CMN’s dynamic and
distributed nature. Organizations can ensure robust, compliant,

and efficient network operations by embracing new monitoring
technologies.
