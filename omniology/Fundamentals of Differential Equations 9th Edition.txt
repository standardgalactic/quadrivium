Cover is detail of Martin Burgess’ 
“Clock B” that was constructed to 
demonstrate the efficacy of John 
Harrison’s (1693-1776) science. 
Begun in 1974, and completed by 
the Charles Frodsham & Co. Ltd. 
of London in 2011, Clock B was 
placed on time trial at the Royal 
Observatory, Greenwich, England 
where it remained within 5/8 
seconds in 100 days, and officially 
dubbed “the world’s most accurate 
pendulum clock operating in free 
air.” The clock exhibits oscillation 
consistent with van der Pol’s 
nonlinear differential equation 
with an amplitude that minimizes 
external perturbation effects.

Dedicated to R. Kent Nagle
He has left his imprint not only on these pages but upon all who knew him. He was 
that rare mathematician who could effectively communicate at all levels, imparting 
his love for the subject with the same ease to undergraduates, graduates, precollege 
students, public school teachers, and his colleagues at the University of South Florida.
Kent was at peace in life—a peace that emanated from the depth of his under-
standing of the human condition and the strength of his beliefs in the institutions of 
family, religion, and education. He was a research mathematician, an accomplished 
author, a Sunday school teacher, and a devoted husband and father.
Kent was also my dear friend and my jogging partner who has left me behind still 
struggling to keep pace with his high ideals.

Our Goal
Fundamentals of Differential Equations is designed to serve the needs of a one-semester 
course in basic theory as well as applications of differential equations. The flexibility of the 
text provides the instructor substantial latitude in designing a syllabus to match the emphasis 
of the course. Sample syllabi are provided in this preface that illustrate the inherent flexibility 
of this text to balance theory, methodology, applications, and numerical methods, as well as 
the incorporation of commercially available computer software for this course.
New to This Edition
•	 This text now features a MyMathLab course with approximately 750 algorithmic online 
homework exercises, tutorial videos, and the complete eText. Please see the “Technology 
and Supplements” section below for more details.
•	 In the Laplace Transforms chapter (7), the treatments of discontinuous and periodic func-
tions are now divided into two sections that are more appropriate for 50 minute lectures: 
Section 7.6 “Transforms of Discontinuous Functions” (page 383) and Section 7.7 “Trans-
forms of Periodic and Power Functions” (page 392).
•	 New examples have been added dealing with variation of parameters, Laplace transforms, 
the Gamma function, and eigenvectors (among others).
•	 New problems added to exercise sets deal with such topics as axon gating variables and 
oscillations of a helium-filled balloon on a cord. Additionally, novel problems accompany 
the new projects, focusing on economic models, disease control, synchronization, signal 
propagation, and phase plane analyses of neural responses. We have also added a set of 
Review Problems for Chapter 1 (page 29).
•	 Several pedagogical changes were made including amplification of the distinction between 
phase plane solutions and actual trajectories in Chapter 5 and incorporation of matrix and 
Jacobian formulations for autonomous systems.
•	 A new appendix lists commercial software and freeware for direction fields, phase por-
traits, and numerical methods for solving differential equations. (Appendix G, page A-17.)
•	 “The 2014–2015 Ebola Epidemic” is a new Project in Chapter 5 that describes a sys-
tem of differential equations for modelling for the spread of the disease in West Africa. 
The model incorporates such features as contact tracing, number of contacts, likelihood of 
infection, and efficacy of isolation. See Project F, page 314.
•	 A new project in Chapter 1 called “Applications to Economics” deals with models for an 
agrarian economy as well as the growth of capital. See Project C, page 35.

Preface

xiv          Preface
•	 A new project in Chapter 4 called “Gravity Train” invites to reader to utilize differential 
equations in the design of an underground tunnel from Moscow to St. Petersburg, Russia, 
using gravity for propulsion. See Project H, page 240.
•	 Phase-locked loops constitute the theme of a new project in Chapter 5 that utilizes dif-
ferential equations to analyze a technique for measuring or matching high frequency radio 
oscillations. See Project G, page 317.
•	 A new Project in Chapter 10 broadens the analysis of the wave and heat equations to 
explore the telegrapher’s and cable equations. See Project E, page 637.
Prerequisites
While some universities make linear algebra a prerequisite for differential equations, many 
schools (especially engineering) only require calculus. With this in mind, we have designed 
the text so that only Chapter 6 (Theory of Higher-Order Linear Differential Equations) and 
Chapter 9 (Matrix Methods for Linear Systems) require more than high school level linear 
algebra. Moreover, Chapter 9 contains review sections on matrices and vectors as well as spe-
cific references for the deeper results used from the theory of linear algebra. We have also 
written Chapter 5 so as to give an introduction to systems of differential equations—including 
methods of solving, phase plane analysis, applications, numerical procedures, and Poincaré 
maps—that does not require a background in linear algebra.
Sample Syllabi
As a rough guide in designing a one-semester syllabus related to this text, we provide three 
samples that can be used for a 15-week course that meets three hours per week. The first 
emphasizes applications and computations including phase plane analysis; the second is 
designed for courses that place more emphasis on theory; and the third stresses methodology 
and partial differential equations. Chapters 1, 2, and 4 provide the core for any first course. The 
rest of the chapters are, for the most part, independent of each other. For students with a back-
ground in linear algebra, the instructor may prefer to replace Chapter 7 (Laplace Transforms) 
or Chapter 8 (Series Solutions of Differential Equations) with sections from Chapter 9 (Matrix 
Methods for Linear Systems).

Preface          xv
Projects
At the end of each chapter are projects relating to the material covered in the chapter. Sev-
eral of them have been contributed by distinguished researchers. A project might involve a 
more challenging application, delve deeper into the theory, or introduce more advanced top-
ics in differential equations. Although these projects can be tackled by an individual student, 
classroom testing has shown that working in groups lends a valuable added dimension to the 
learning experience. Indeed, it simulates the interactions that take place in the professional 
arena.
Choice of 
Applications
Because of syllabus constraints, some courses will have little or no time for sections (such as 
those in Chapters 3 and 5) that exclusively deal with applications. Therefore, we have made 
the sections in these chapters independent of each other. To afford the instructor even greater 
flexibility, we have built in a variety of applications in the exercises for the theoretical sec-
tions. In addition, we have included many projects that deal with such applications.
Flexible 
Organization
Most of the material is modular in nature to allow for various course configurations and 
emphasis (theory, applications and techniques, and concepts).
Optional Use 
of Computer 
Software
The availability of computer packages such as Mathcad®, Mathematica®, MATLAB®, and 
Maple™ provides an opportunity for the student to conduct numerical experiments and tackle 
realistic applications that give additional insights into the subject. Consequently, we have 
inserted several exercises and projects throughout the text that are designed for the student to 
employ available software in phase plane analysis, eigenvalue computations, and the numerical 
solutions of various equations.

In response to the perception that many of today’s students’ skills in integration have gotten 
rusty by the time they enter a differential equations course, we have included an appendix 
offering a quick review of the basic methods for integrating functions analytically.
Review of 
Integration

xvi          Preface
Chapter 
Summary and 
Review Problems
All of the main chapters contain a set of review problems along with a synopsis of the major 
concepts presented.
Computer 
Graphics
Most of the figures in the text were generated via computer. Computer graphics not only ensure 
greater accuracy in the illustrations, they demonstrate the use of numerical experimentation in 
studying the behavior of solutions.
Proofs
While more pragmatic students may balk at proofs, most instructors regard these justifications 
as an essential ingredient in a textbook on differential equations. As with any text at this level, 
certain details in the proofs must be omitted. When this occurs, we flag the instance and refer 
readers either to a problem in the exercises or to another text. For convenience, the end of a 
proof is marked by the symbol ◆.
Linear Theory
We have developed the theory of linear differential equations in a gradual manner. In Chapter 4 
(Linear Second-Order Equations) we first present the basic theory for linear second-order 
equations with constant coefficients and discuss various techniques for solving these equa-
tions. Section 4.7 surveys the extension of these ideas to variable-coefficient second-order 
equations. A more general and detailed discussion of linear differential equations is given in 
Chapter 6 (Theory of Higher-Order Linear Differential Equations). For a beginning course 
emphasizing methods of solution, the presentation in Chapter 4 may be sufficient and Chapter 6 
can be skipped.
Numerical 
Algorithms
Several numerical methods for approximating solutions to differential equations are presented 
along with program outlines that are easily implemented on a computer. These methods are 
introduced early in the text so that teachers and/or students can use them for numerical experi-
mentation and for tackling complicated applications. Where appropriate we direct the student 
to software packages or web-based applets for implementation of these algorithms.
Exercises
An abundance of exercises is graduated in difficulty from straightforward, routine problems 
to more challenging ones. Deeper theoretical questions, along with applications, usually 
occur toward the end of the exercise sets. Throughout the text we have included problems and 
projects that require the use of a calculator or computer. These exercises are denoted by the 
symbol 
.
Laplace 
Transforms
We provide a detailed chapter on Laplace transforms (Chapter 7), since this is a recurring topic 
for engineers. Our treatment emphasizes discontinuous forcing terms and includes a section on 
the Dirac delta function.
Motivating 
Problem
Most chapters begin with a discussion of a problem from physics or engineering that motivates 
the topic presented and illustrates the methodology.
Historical 
Footnotes
Throughout the text historical footnotes are set off by colored daggers (†). These footnotes 
typically provide the name of the person who developed the technique, the date, and the con-
text of the original research.
Technical 
Writing Exercises 
Communication skills are, of course, an essential aspect of professional activities. Yet few 
texts provide opportunities for the reader to develop these skills. Thus, we have added at the 
end of most chapters a set of clearly marked technical writing exercises that invite students 
to make documented responses to questions dealing with the concepts in the chapter. In so 
doing, students are encouraged to make comparisons between various methods and to present 
examples that support their analysis.

Preface          xvii
Partial 
Differential 
Equations 
An introduction to this subject is provided in Chapter 10, which covers the method of separa-
tion of variables, Fourier series, the heat equation, the wave equation, and Laplace’s equation. 
Examples in two and three dimensions are included.
Review of Algebraic 
Equations and 
Matrices
The chapter on matrix methods for linear systems (Chapter 9) begins with two (optional) intro-
ductory sections reviewing the theory of linear algebraic systems and matrix algebra.

Vibrations
Motivation for Chapter 4 on linear differential equations is provided in an introductory sec-
tion describing the mass–spring oscillator. We exploit the reader’s familiarity with common 
vibratory motions to anticipate the exposition of the theoretical and analytical aspects of linear 
equations. Not only does this model provide an anchor for the discourse on constant-coefficient 
equations, but a liberal interpretation of its features enables us to predict the qualitative behav-
ior of variable-coefficient and nonlinear equations as well.
Phase Plane
Chapter 5 describes how qualitative information for two-dimensional systems can be gleaned 
about the solutions to intractable autonomous equations by observing their direction fields and 
critical points on the phase plane. With the assistance of suitable software, this approach pro-
vides a refreshing, almost recreational alternative to the traditional analytic methodology as we 
discuss applications in nonlinear mechanics, ecosystems, and epidemiology.
Power Series
Power series solutions is a topic that occasionally causes student anxiety. Possibly, this is due 
to inadequate preparation in calculus where the more subtle subject of convergent series is 
(frequently) covered at a rapid pace. Our solution has been to provide a graceful initiation into 
the theory of power series solutions with an exposition of Taylor polynomial approximants 
to solutions, deferring the sophisticated issues of convergence to later sections. Unlike many 
texts, ours provides an extensive section on the method of Frobenius (Section 8.6) as well as a 
section on finding a second linearly independent solution. While we have given considerable 
space to power series solutions, we have also taken great care to accommodate the instructor 
who only wishes to give a basic introduction to the topic. An introduction to solving differen-
tial equations using power series and the method of Frobenius can be accomplished by cover-
ing the materials in Sections 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, and 8.6.

CHAPTER 
1
Introduction
In the sciences and engineering, mathematical models are developed to aid in the understanding 
of physical phenomena. These models often yield an equation that contains some derivatives 
of an unknown function. Such an equation is called a differential equation. Two examples of 
models developed in calculus are the free fall of a body and the decay of a radioactive substance.
In the case of free fall, an object is released from a certain height above the ground and 
falls under the force of gravity.† Newton’s second law, which states that an object’s mass times 
its acceleration equals the total force acting on it, can be applied to the falling object. This 
leads to the equation (see Figure 1.1)
m d2h
dt2 = -mg ,
where m is the mass of the object, h is the height above the ground, d2h>dt2 is its acceleration, g 
is the (constant) gravitational acceleration, and -mg is the force due to gravity. This is a differ-
ential equation containing the second derivative of the unknown height h as a function of time.
Fortunately, the above equation is easy to solve for h. All we have to do is divide by m and 
integrate twice with respect to t. That is,
d2h
dt2 = -g ,
so
dh
dt = -gt + c1
and
h = h1t2 = -gt2
2
+ c1t + c2 .
1.1  Background

†We are assuming here that gravity is the only force acting on the object and that this force is constant. More general 
models would take into account other forces, such as air resistance.

2          Chapter 1    Introduction
We will see that the constants of integration, c1 and c2, are determined if we know the initial 
height and the initial velocity of the object. We then have a formula for the height of the object 
at time t.
In the case of radioactive decay (Figure 1.2), we begin from the premise that the rate of 
decay is proportional to the amount of radioactive substance present. This leads to the equation
dA
dt = -kA ,    k 7 0 ,
where A1 7  02 is the unknown amount of radioactive substance present at time t and k is the 
proportionality constant. To solve this differential equation, we rewrite it in the form
1
A
 dA = -k dt
and integrate to obtain
L
 
 
1
A
 dA =
L
 
 
-k dt
ln A + C1 = -kt + C2 .
Solving for A yields
A = A1t2 = e ln A = e-kt eC2-C1 = Ce-kt,
where C is the combination of integration constants eC2-C1. The value of C, as we will see later, 
is determined if the initial amount of radioactive substance is given. We then have a formula 
for the amount of radioactive substance at any future time t.
Even though the above examples were easily solved by methods learned in calculus, they 
do give us some insight into the study of differential equations in general. First, notice that 
the solution of a differential equation is a function, like h1t2 or A1t2, not merely a number. 
Second, integration† is an important tool in solving differential equations (not surprisingly!). 
Third, we cannot expect to get a unique solution to a differential equation, since there will 
be arbitrary “constants of integration.” The second derivative d2h>dt2 in the free-fall equation 
gave rise to two constants, c1 and c2, and the first derivative in the decay equation gave rise, 
ultimately, to one constant, C.
Whenever a mathematical model involves the rate of change of one variable with respect 
to another, a differential equation is apt to appear. Unfortunately, in contrast to the examples for 
free fall and radioactive decay, the differential equation may be very complicated and difficult 
to analyze.
†For a review of integration techniques, see Appendix A.

Section 1.1    Background          3
Differential equations arise in a variety of subject areas, including not only the physi-
cal sciences but also such diverse fields as economics, medicine, psychology, and operations 
research. We now list a few specific examples.
1.	 In banking practice, if P1t2 is the number of dollars in a savings bank account that 
pays a yearly interest rate of r % compounded continuously, then P satisfies the dif-
ferential equation
(1)	
dP

 P  , t in years.
2.	 A classic application of differential equations is found in the study of an electric cir-
cuit consisting of a resistor, an inductor, and a capacitor driven by an electromotive 
force (see Figure 1.3). Here an application of Kirchhoff’s laws† leads to the equation
(2)	
L d2q
dt2 + R dq
dt + 1
C
 q = E1t2 ,
where L is the inductance, R is the resistance, C is the capacitance, E1t2 is the elec-
tromotive force, q1t2 is the charge on the capacitor, and t is the time.
3.	 In psychology, one model of the learning of a task involves the equation
(3) 	
dy>dt
y3>211 - y23>2 = 2p
1n .
Here the variable y represents the learner’s skill level as a function of time t. The con-
stants p and n depend on the individual learner and the nature of the task.
4.	 In the study of vibrating strings and the propagation of waves, we find the partial dif-
ferential equation
(4)	
02u
0 t2 - c2 02u
0 x2 = 0 ,‡
where t represents time, x the location along the string, c the wave speed, and u the 
displacement of the string, which is a function of time and location.

in 1747.

4          Chapter 1    Introduction
To begin our study of differential equations, we need some common terminology. If an 
equation involves the derivative of one variable with respect to another, then the former is 
called a dependent variable and the latter an independent variable. Thus, in the equation
(5)	
d2x
dt2 + a dx
dt + kx = 0 ,
t is the independent variable and x is the dependent variable. We refer to a and k as coefficients 
in equation (5). In the equation
(6)	
0u
0x - 0u
0y = x - 2y ,
x and y are independent variables and u is the dependent variable.
A differential equation involving only ordinary derivatives with respect to a single indepen-
dent variable is called an ordinary differential equation. A differential equation involving partial 
derivatives with respect to more than one independent variable is a partial differential equation. 
Equation (5) is an ordinary differential equation, and equation (6) is a partial differential equation.
The order of a differential equation is the order of the highest-order derivatives present in the 
equation. Equation (5) is a second-order equation because d2x>dt2 is the highest-order derivative 
present. Equation (6) is a first-order equation because only first-order partial derivatives occur.
It will be useful to classify ordinary differential equations as being either linear or nonlin-
ear. Remember that lines (in two dimensions) and planes (in three dimensions) are especially 
easy to visualize, when compared to nonlinear objects such as cubic curves or quadric surfaces. 
For example, all the points on a line can be found if we know just two of them. Correspond-
ingly, linear differential equations are more amenable to solution than nonlinear ones. Observe 
that the equations for lines ax + by = c and planes ax + by + cz = d have the feature that the 
variables appear in additive combinations of their first powers only. By analogy a linear differ-
ential equation is one in which the dependent variable y and its derivatives appear in additive 
combinations of their first powers.
More precisely, a differential equation is linear if it has the format
(7)	
an1x2 dny
dxn + an-11x2 dn−1y
dxn−1 + P + a11x2 dy
dx + a01x2y = F1x2 ,
where an1x2, an-11x2, . . . , a01x2 and F1x2 depend only on the independent variable x. The 
additive combinations are permitted to have multipliers (coefficients) that depend on x; no 
restrictions are made on the nature of this x-dependence. If an ordinary differential equation is 
not linear, then we call it nonlinear. For example,
d2y
dx2 + y3 = 0
is a nonlinear second-order ordinary differential equation because of the y3 term, whereas
t3 dx
dt = t3 + x
is linear (despite the t3 terms). The equation
d2y
dx2 - y dy
dx = cos x
is nonlinear because of the y dy>dx term.

Section 1.1    Background          5
Although the majority of equations one is likely to encounter in practice fall into the 
nonlinear category, knowing how to deal with the simpler linear equations is an important first 
step (just as tangent lines help our understanding of complicated curves by providing local 
approximations).
In Problems 1–12, a differential equation is given along with 
the field or problem area in which it arises. Classify each as 
an ordinary differential equation (ODE) or a partial differen-
tial equation (PDE), give the order, and indicate the indepen-
dent and dependent variables. If the equation is an ordinary 
differential equation, indicate whether the equation is linear 
or nonlinear.

†Historical Footnote: In 1630 Galileo formulated the brachistochrone problem 1bra´xi´sto% = shortest, xro´no% = time), that is, to determine a 
path down which a particle will fall from one given point to another in the shortest time. It was reproposed by John Bernoulli in 1696 and solved 
by him the following year.

6          Chapter 1    Introduction
An nth-order ordinary differential equation is an equality relating the independent variable 
to the nth derivative (and usually lower-order derivatives as well) of the dependent variable. 
Examples are
x2 d2y
dx2 + x dy
dx + y = x3 (second-order, x independent, y dependent)
B
1 - a d2y
dt2 b - y = 0 (second-order, t independent, y dependent)
d4x
dt4 = xt (fourth-order, t independent, x dependent).
Thus, a general form for an nth-order equation with x independent, y dependent, can be 
expressed as
(1)	
F ax, y, dy
dx, . . . , dny
dxn b = 0 ,
where F is a function that depends on x, y, and the derivatives of y up to order n; that is, on x, 
y, . . . , dny>dxn. We assume that the equation holds for all x in an open interval I (a 6 x 6 b, 
where a or b could be infinite). In many cases we can isolate the highest-order term dny>dxn 
and write equation (1) as
(2)	
dny
dx  n = f  ax, y, dy
dx, . . . , dn-1y
dx  n-1 b ,
which is often preferable to (1) for theoretical and computational purposes.
1.2  Solutions and Initial Value Problems
Explicit Solution
Definition 1.	 A function f1x2 that when substituted for y in equation (1) [or (2)]  
satisfies the equation for all x in the interval I is called an explicit solution to the  
equation on I.
Show that f1x2 = x2 - x-1 is an explicit solution to the linear equation
(3)	
d2y
dx2 - 2
x2 y = 0 ,
but c1x2 = x3 is not.
Example 1
Solution
The functions f1x2 = x2 - x-1, f′1x2 = 2x + x-2, and f″1x2 = 2 - 2x-3 are defined for 
all x ≠0. Substitution of f1x2 for y in equation (3) gives
12 - 2x-32 - 2
x2 1x2 - x-12 = 12 - 2x-32 - 12 - 2x-32 = 0 .

Section 1.2    Solutions and Initial Value Problems          7
Since this is valid for any x ≠0, the function f1x2 = x2 - x-1 is an explicit solution to (3) on 
1 - ∞, 02 and also on 10, ∞2.
For c1x2 = x3 we have c′1x2 = 3x2, c″1x2 = 6x, and substitution into (3) gives
6x - 2
x2 x3 = 4x = 0 ,
which is valid only at the point x = 0 and not on an interval. Hence c1x2 is not a solution.  ◆
Example 2
Show that for any choice of the constants c1 and c2, the function
f1x2 = c1e-x + c2e2x
is an explicit solution to the linear equation
(4)	
y″ - y′ - 2y = 0 .
Solution
We compute f′1x2 = -c1e-x + 2c2e2x and f″1x2 = c1e-x + 4c2e2x. Substitution of f, f′, 
and f″ for y, y′, and y″ in equation (4) yields
1c1e-x + 4c2e2x2 - 1 -c1e-x + 2c2e2x2 - 21c1e-x + c2e2x2
= 1c1 + c1 - 2c12e-x + 14c2 - 2c2 - 2c22e2x = 0 .
Since equality holds for all x in 1 - ∞, ∞2, then f1x2 = c1e-x + c2e2x is an explicit solution to 
(4) on the interval 1 - ∞, ∞2 for any choice of the constants c1 and c2.  ◆
As we will see in Chapter 2, the methods for solving differential equations do not always 
yield an explicit solution for the equation. We may have to settle for a solution that is defined 
implicitly. Consider the following example.
Example 3
Show that the relation
(5)	
y2 - x3 + 8 = 0
implicitly defines a solution to the nonlinear equation
(6)	
dy
dx = 3x2
2y
on the interval 12, ∞2.
Solution
When we solve (5) for y, we obtain y = { 2x3 - 8. Let’s try f1x2 = 2x3 - 8 to see if it 
is an explicit solution. Since df>dx = 3x2> 122x3 - 82, both f and df>dx are defined on 
12, ∞2. Substituting them into (6) yields
3x2
22x3 - 8
=
3x2
21 2x3 - 82
 ,
which is indeed valid for all x in 12, ∞2. [You can check that c1x2 = - 2x3 - 8 is also an 
explicit solution to (6).]  ◆

8          Chapter 1    Introduction
Implicit Solution
Definition 2.	 A relation G1x, y2 = 0 is said to be an implicit solution to equation (1) 
on the interval I if it defines one or more explicit solutions on I.
†See Vector Calculus, 6th ed, by J. E. Marsden and A. J. Tromba (Freeman, San Francisco, 2013).
Example 4
Show that
(7)	
x + y + e xy = 0
is an implicit solution to the nonlinear equation
(8)	
11 + xe xy2 dy
dx + 1 + ye xy = 0 .
Solution
First, we observe that we are unable to solve (7) directly for y in terms of x alone. However, for 
(7) to hold, we realize that any change in x requires a change in y, so we expect the relation (7) 
to define implicitly at least one function y1x2. This is difficult to show directly but can be rigor-
ously verified using the implicit function theorem† of advanced calculus, which guarantees 
that such a function y1x2 exists that is also differentiable (see Problem 30).
Once we know that y is a differentiable function of x, we can use the technique of implicit 
differentiation. Indeed, from (7) we obtain on differentiating with respect to x and applying the 
product and chain rules,
d
dx 1x + y + e xy2 = 1 + dy
dx + e xyay + x dy
dxb = 0
or
11 + xe xy2 dy
dx + 1 + ye xy = 0 ,
which is identical to the differential equation (8). Thus, relation (7) is an implicit solution on 
some interval guaranteed by the implicit function theorem.  ◆
Example 5
Verify that for every constant C the relation 4x2 - y2 = C is an implicit solution to
(9)	
y dy
dx - 4x = 0 .
Graph the solution curves for C = 0, {1, {4. (We call the collection of all such solutions a 
one-parameter family of solutions.)
Solution
When we implicitly differentiate the equation 4x2 - y2 = C with respect to x, we find
8x - 2y dy
dx = 0 ,

Section 1.2    Solutions and Initial Value Problems          9
which is equivalent to (9). In Figure 1.4 we have sketched the implicit solutions for 
C = 0, {1, {4. The curves are hyperbolas with common asymptotes y = {2x. Notice that 
the implicit solution curves (with C arbitrary) fill the entire plane and are nonintersecting for 
C ≠0. For C = 0, the implicit solution gives rise to the two explicit solutions y = 2x and 
y = -2x, both of which pass through the origin.  ◆
For brevity we hereafter use the term solution to mean either an explicit or an implicit 
solution.
In the beginning of Section 1.1, we saw that the solution of the second-order free-fall 
equation invoked two arbitrary constants of integration c1, c2:
h1t2 = -gt2
2
+ c1t + c2 ,
whereas the solution of the first-order radioactive decay equation contained a single constant C:
A1t2 = Ce-kt .
It is clear that integration of the simple fourth-order equation
d4y
dx4 = 0
brings in four undetermined constants:
y1x2 = c1x3 + c2x2 + c3x + c4 .
It will be shown later in the text that in general the methods for solving nth-order differential 
equations evoke n arbitrary constants. In most cases, we will be able to evaluate these constants 
if we know n initial values y1x02, y′1x02, . . . , y1n-121x02.

In the case of a first-order equation, the initial conditions reduce to the single requirement
y1x02 = y0 ,
and in the case of a second-order equation, the initial conditions have the form
y1x02 = y0 ,    dy
dx
 1x02 = y1 .
The terminology initial conditions comes from mechanics, where the independent variable 
x represents time and is customarily symbolized as t. Then if t0 is the starting time, y1t02 = y0 
represents the initial location of an object and y′1t02 gives its initial velocity.

Solution
Observe that f1x2 = sin x - cos x, df>dx =  cos x + sin x, and d2f>dx2 = -sin x + cos x 
are all defined on 1 - ∞, ∞2. Substituting into the differential equation gives
1 -sin x + cos x2 + 1sin x - cos x2 = 0 ,
which holds for all x ∈1 - ∞, ∞2. Hence, f1x2 is a solution to the differential equation in 
(10) on 1 - ∞, ∞2. When we check the initial conditions, we find
f102 = sin 0 - cos 0 = -1 ,
df
dx
 102 = cos 0 + sin 0 = 1 ,
which meets the requirements of (10). Therefore, f1x2 is a solution to the given initial value 
problem.  ◆

Example 7
As shown in Example 2, the function f1x2 = c1e-x + c2e2x is a solution to
d2y
dx2 - dy
dx - 2y = 0
for any choice of the constants c1 and c2. Determine c1 and c2 so that the initial conditions
y102 = 2   and   dy
dx
 102 = -3
are satisfied.
Solution
To determine the constants c1 and c2, we first compute df>dx to get df>dx =  -c1e-x + 2c2e2x. 
Substituting in our initial conditions gives the following system of equations:
•
f102
= c1e0 + c2e0 = 2  ,
df
dx
 102 = -c1e0 + 2c2e0 = -3  ,         or        •
c1 + c2
= 2  ,
-c1 + 2c2 = -3  .
Adding the last two equations yields 3c2 = -1, so c2 = -1>3. Since c1 + c2 = 2, we find 
c1 = 7>3. Hence, the solution to the initial value problem is f1x2 = 17>32e-x - 11>32e2x.  ◆
We now state an existence and uniqueness theorem for first-order initial value problems. 
We presume the differential equation has been cast into the format
dy
dx = ƒ1x, y2  .
Of course, the right-hand side, f1x, y2, must be well defined at the starting value x0 for x and at 
the stipulated initial value y0 = y1x02 for y. The hypotheses of the theorem, moreover, require 
continuity of both f and 0f>0y for x in some interval a 6 x 6 b containing x0, and for y in 
some interval c 6 y 6 d containing y0. Notice that the set of points in the xy-plane that satisfy  
a 6 x 6 b and c 6 y 6 d constitutes a rectangle. Figure 1.5 on page 12 depicts this “rectangle 
of continuity” with the initial point 1x0, y02 in its interior and a sketch of a portion of the solution 
curve contained therein.
Existence and Uniqueness of Solution
Theorem 1.	
Consider the initial value problem
dy
dx = f1x, y2  ,    y1x02 = y0  .
If f and 0f>0y are continuous functions in some rectangle
R = 51x, y2: a 6 x 6 b, c 6 y 6 d6
that contains the point 1x0, y02, then the initial value problem has a unique solution 
f1x2 in some interval x0 - d 6 x 6 x0 + d, where d is a positive number.†
†We remark that the continuity of f alone in such a rectangle is enough to guarantee the existence of a solution to the 
initial value problem in some open interval containing x0, but uniqueness may not hold (see Example 9).

12          Chapter 1    Introduction
The preceding theorem tells us two things. First, when an equation satisfies the hypotheses 
of Theorem 1, we are assured that a solution to the initial value problem exists. Naturally, it is 
desirable to know whether the equation we are trying to solve actually has a solution before 
we spend too much time trying to solve it. Second, when the hypotheses are satisfied, there is 
a unique solution to the initial value problem. This uniqueness tells us that if we can find a 
solution, then it is the only solution for the initial value problem. Graphically, the theorem says 
that there is only one solution curve that passes through the point 1x0, y02. In other words, for 
this first-order equation, two solutions cannot cross anywhere in the rectangle. Notice that the 
existence and uniqueness of the solution holds only in some neighborhood 1x0 - d, x0 + d2. 
Unfortunately, the theorem does not tell us the span 12d2 of this neighborhood (merely that it 
is not zero). Problem 18 elaborates on this feature.
Problem 19 gives an example of an equation with no solution. Problem 29 displays an ini-
tial value problem for which the solution is not unique. Of course, the hypotheses of Theorem 1 
are not met for these cases.
When initial value problems are used to model physical phenomena, many practitioners 
tacitly presume the conclusions of Theorem 1 to be valid. Indeed, for the initial value problem 
to be a reasonable model, we certainly expect it to have a solution, since physically “something 
does happen.” Moreover, the solution should be unique in those cases when repetition of the 
experiment under identical conditions yields the same results.†
The proof of Theorem 1 involves converting the initial value problem into an integral 
equation and then using Picard’s method to generate a sequence of successive approximations 
that converge to the solution. The conversion to an integral equation and Picard’s method are 
discussed in Project A at the end of this chapter. A detailed discussion and proof of the theorem 
are given in Chapter 13.‡

Example 8
For the initial value problem
(11)	
3 dy
dx = x2 - xy3  ,  y112 = 6  ,
does Theorem 1 imply the existence of a unique solution?
Solution
Dividing by 3 to conform to the statement of the theorem, we identify f1x, y2 as 1x2 - xy32/3 
and 0f>0y as -xy2. Both of these functions are continuous in any rectangle containing the point 
(1, 6), so the hypotheses of Theorem 1 are satisfied. It then follows from the theorem that 
the initial value problem (11) has a unique solution in an interval about x = 1 of the form 
11 - d, 1 + d2, where d is some positive number.  ◆
Example 9
For the initial value problem
(12)	
dy
dx = 3y2>3  ,    y122 = 0  ,
does Theorem 1 imply the existence of a unique solution?
Solution
Here f1x, y2 = 3y2>3 and 0f>0y = 2y-1>3. Unfortunately 0f>0y is not continuous or even 
defined when y = 0. Consequently, there is no rectangle containing 12, 02 in which both f 
and 0f>0y are continuous. Because the hypotheses of Theorem 1 do not hold, we cannot use 
Theorem 1 to determine whether the initial value problem does or does not have a unique 
solution. It turns out that this initial value problem has more than one solution. We refer you to 
Problem 29 and Project G of Chapter 2 for the details.  ◆
In Example 9 suppose the initial condition is changed to y122 = 1. Then, since f and 
0f>0y are continuous in any rectangle that contains the point 12, 12 but does not intersect the 
x-axis—say, R = 51x, y2: 0 6 x 6 10, 0 6 y 6 56—it follows from Theorem 1 that this new 
initial value problem has a unique solution in some interval about x = 2.

but not for larger d. This illustrates that in Theorem 1 
the existence interval can be quite small (if c is small)

30.	 Implicit Function Theorem. Let G1x, y2 have con-
tinuous first partial derivatives in the rectangle 
R = 51x, y2: a 6 x 6 b, c 6 y 6 d6 
containing 
the 
point 1x0, y02. If G1x0, y02 = 0 and the partial derivative
Gy1x0, y02 ≠0, then there exists a differentiable function 
y = f1x2, defined in some interval I = 1x0 - d, x0 + d2, 
that satisfies G1x, f1x22 = 0 for all x ∈I.
The implicit function theorem gives conditions under 
which the relationship G1x, y2 = 0 defines y implicitly 
as a function of x. Use the implicit function theorem 
to show that the relationship x + y + e xy = 0, given in 
Example 4, defines y implicitly as a function of x near the 
point 10, -12.

(a)	 Does Theorem 1 imply the existence of a unique 
solution to (13) that satisfies y1x02 = 0?
	
(b)	 Show that when x0 ≠0, equation (13) can’t possibly 
have a solution in a neighborhood of x = x0 that sat-
isfies y1x02 = 0.
	
(c)	 Show that there are two distinct solutions to (13)  
satisfying y102 = 0 (see Figure 1.4 on page 9).
The existence and uniqueness theorem discussed in Section 1.2 certainly has great value, but it 
stops short of telling us anything about the nature of the solution to a differential equation. For 
practical reasons we may need to know the value of the solution at a certain point, or the inter-
vals where the solution is increasing, or the points where the solution attains a maximum value. 
Certainly, knowing an explicit representation (a formula) for the solution would be a consider-
able help in answering these questions. However, for many of the differential equations that we 
are likely to encounter in real-world applications, it will be impossible to find such a formula. 
Moreover, even if we are lucky enough to obtain an implicit solution, using this relationship to 
determine an explicit form may be difficult. Thus, we must rely on other methods to analyze or 
approximate the solution.
One technique that is useful in visualizing (graphing) the solutions to a first-order differen-
tial equation is to sketch the direction field for the equation. To describe this method, we need 
to make a general observation. Namely, a first-order equation
dy
dx = f1x, y2
specifies a slope at each point in the xy-plane where f is defined. In other words, it gives  
the direction that a graph of a solution to the equation must have at each point. Consider, for 
example, the equation
(1)	
dy
dx = x2 - y .
The graph of a solution to (1) that passes through the point 1 -2, 12 must have slope 1 -222 - 1 = 3 
at that point, and a solution through 1 -1, 12 has zero slope at that point.
A plot of short line segments drawn at various points in the xy-plane showing the slope 
of the solution curve there is called a direction field for the differential equation. Because 
the direction field gives the “flow of solutions,” it facilitates the drawing of any particular 
solution (such as the solution to an initial value problem). In Figure 1.6(a) on page 16 we 
have sketched the direction field for equation (1) and in Figure 1.6(b) we have drawn several 
solution curves in color.
1.3  Direction Fields

16          Chapter 1    Introduction
Some other interesting direction field patterns are displayed in Figure 1.7. Depicted 
in Figure 1.7(a) is the pattern for the radioactive decay equation dy>dx = -2y (recall that in 
Section 1.1 we analyzed this equation in the form dA>dt = -kA). From the flow patterns, we 
can see that all solutions tend asymptotically to the positive x-axis as x gets larger. In other 
words, any material decaying according to this law eventually dwindles to practically nothing. 
This is consistent with the solution formula we derived earlier,
A = Ce-kt ,  or  y = Ce-2x .
From the direction field in Figure 1.7(b), we can anticipate that all solutions to 
dy>dx = -y>x also approach the x-axis as x approaches infinity (plus or minus infinity, in

fact). But more interesting is the observation that no solution can make it across the y-axis; 
0 y1x2 0  “blows up” as x goes to zero from either direction. Exception: On close examination, it 
appears the function y1x2 K 0 might just make it through this barrier. As a matter of fact, in Problem 
19 you are invited to show that the solutions to this differential equation are given by y = C>x, 
with C an arbitrary constant. So they do diverge at x = 0, unless C = 0.
Let’s interpret the existence–uniqueness theorem of Section 1.2 for these direction fields. 
For Figure 1.7(a), where dy>dx = f1x, y2 = -2y, we select a starting point x0 and an initial 
value y1x02 = y0, as in Figure 1.8(a). Because the right-hand side f1x, y2 = -2y is continu-
ously differentiable for all x and y, we can enclose any initial point 1x0, y02 in a “rectangle 
of continuity.” We conclude that the equation has one and only one solution curve passing 
through 1x0, y02, as depicted in the figure.
For the equation
dy
dx = f1x, y2 = - y
x ,
the right-hand side f1x, y2 = -y>x does not meet the continuity conditions when x = 0 
(i.e., for points on the y-axis). However, for any nonzero starting value x0 and any initial 
value y1x02 = y0, we can enclose 1x0, y02 in a rectangle of continuity that excludes the 
y-axis, as in Figure 1.8(b). Thus, we can be assured of one and only one solution curve 
passing through such a point.
The direction field for the equation
dy
dx = 3y2>3
is intriguing because Example 9 of Section 1.2 showed that the hypotheses of Theorem 1  
do not hold in any rectangle enclosing the initial point x0 = 2, y0 = 0. Indeed, Problem 29 of 
that section demonstrated the violation of uniqueness by exhibiting two solutions, y1x2 K 0 
and y1x2 = 1x - 223, passing through 12, 02. Figure 1.9(a) on page 18 displays this direction 
field, and Figure 1.9(b) demonstrates how both solution curves can successfully “negotiate” this 
flow pattern.

Solution
Clearly, a sketch of the direction field of a first-order differential equation can be helpful in 
visualizing the solutions. However, such a sketch is not sufficient to enable us to trace, unam-
biguously, the solution curve passing through a given initial point 1x0, y02. If we tried to trace 
one of the solution curves in Figure 1.6(b) on page 16, for example, we could easily “slip” over 
to an adjacent curve. For nonunique situations like that in Figure 1.9(b), as one negotiates the 
flow along the curve y = 1x - 223 and reaches the inflection point, one cannot decide whether 
to turn or to (literally) go off on the tangent 1y = 02.

Example 1
The logistic equation for the population p (in thousands) at time t of a certain species is 
given by
(2)	
dp
dt = p12 - p2 .
(Of course, p is nonnegative. The interpretation of the terms in the logistic equation is dis-
cussed in Section 3.2.) From the direction field sketched in Figure 1.10 on page 19, answer the 
following:
(a)	 If the initial population is 3000 3that is, p102 = 34, what can you say about the lim-
iting population limtS + ∞ p1t2?
(b)	 Can a population of 1000 ever decline to 500?
(c)	 Can a population of 1000 ever increase to 3000?
(a)	 The direction field indicates that all solution curves 3other than p1t2 K 04 will 
approach the horizontal line p = 2 as t S + ∞; that is, this line is an asymptote for 
all positive solutions. Thus, limtS+ ∞ p1t2 = 2.
(b)	 The direction field further shows that populations greater than 2000 will steadily 
decrease, whereas those less than 2000 will increase. In particular, a population of 
1000 can never decline to 500.

†Appendix G describes various web sites and commercial software that sketch direction fields and automate most of 
the differential equation algorithms discussed in this book.
(c)	 As mentioned in part (b), a population of 1000 will increase with time. But the direc-
tion field indicates it can never reach 2000 or any larger value; i.e., the solution curve 
cannot cross the line p = 2. Indeed, the constant function p1t2 K 2 is a solution to 
equation (2), and the uniqueness part of Theorem 1, page 11, precludes intersections 
of solution curves.  ◆
Notice that the direction field in Figure 1.10 has the nice feature that the slopes do not depend 
on t; that is, the slopes are the same along each horizontal line. The same is true for Figures 1.8(a) 
and 1.9. This is the key property of so-called autonomous equations y′ = f1y2, where the 
right-hand side is a function of the dependent variable only. Project B, page 33, investigates 
such equations in more detail.
Hand sketching the direction field for a differential equation is often tedious. Fortunately, 
several software programs have been developed to obviate this task†. When hand sketching is 
necessary, however, the method of isoclines can be helpful in reducing the work.
The Method of Isoclines
An isocline for the differential equation
y′ = f1x, y2
is a set of points in the xy-plane where all the solutions have the same slope dy>dx; thus, it is a 
level curve for the function f1x, y2. For example, if
(3)	
y′ = f1x, y2 = x +  y ,
the isoclines are simply the curves (straight lines) x + y = c or y = -x + c. Here c is an arbi-
trary constant. But c can be interpreted as the numerical value of the slope dy>dx of every solu-
tion curve as it crosses the isocline. (Note that c is not the slope of the isocline itself; the latter 
is, obviously, -1.) Figure 1.11(a) on page 20 depicts the isoclines for equation (3).

To implement the method of isoclines for sketching direction fields, we draw hash marks 
with slope c along the isocline f1x, y2 = c for a few selected values of c. If we then erase the 
underlying isocline curves, the hash marks constitute a part of the direction field for the dif-
ferential equation. Figure 1.11(b) depicts this process for the isoclines shown in Figure 1.11(a), 
and Figure 1.11(c) displays some solution curves.
Remark.  The isoclines themselves are not always straight lines. For equation (1) at the 
beginning of this section (page 15), they are parabolas x2 - y = c. When the isocline curves 
are complicated, this method is not practical.

20.	 A bar magnet is often modeled as a magnetic dipole with 
one end labeled the north pole N and the opposite end 
labeled the south pole S. The magnetic field for the mag-
netic dipole is symmetric with respect to rotation about 
the axis passing lengthwise through the center of the 
bar. Hence we can study the magnetic field by restricting 
ourselves to a plane with the bar magnet centered on the 
x-axis.
For a point P that is located a distance r from the 
origin, where r is much greater than the length of the 
magnet, the magnetic field lines satisfy the differential

The iron filings correspond to the hash marks.

the magnetic field lines that are solutions to (4).
	
(d)	 Apply the statement of part (a) to the curves in 
part (c) to sketch the equipotential lines that are 
solutions to (5). The magnetic field lines and the 
equipotential lines are examples of orthogonal 
trajectories. (See Problem 32 in Exercises 2.4, 
page 65.)†
Euler’s method (or the tangent-line method) is a procedure for constructing approximate solu-
tions to an initial value problem for a first-order differential equation
(1)	
y′ = f1x, y2 ,    y1x02 = y0 .
It could be described as a “mechanical” or “computerized” implementation of the informal 
procedure for hand sketching the solution curve from a picture of the direction field. As 
such, we will see that it remains subject to the failing that it may skip across solution curves. 
However, under fairly general conditions, iterations of the procedure do converge to true 
solutions.
The method is illustrated in Figure 1.15 on page 24. Starting at the initial point 1x0, y02, 
we follow the straight line with slope f1x0, y02, the tangent line, for some distance to the 
point 1x1, y12. Then we reset the slope to the value f1x1, y12 and follow this line to 1x2, y22. 
In this way we construct polygonal (broken line) approximations to the solution. As we take 
smaller spacings between points (and thus employ more points), we may expect to converge 
to the true solution.
To be more precise, assume that the initial value problem (1) has a unique solution f1x2 
in some interval centered at x0. Let h be a fixed positive number (called the step size) and con-
sider the equally spaced points‡
xn J x0 + nh ,    n = 0, 1, 2, . . .  .
1.4  The Approximation Method of Euler
† Equations (4) and (5) can be solved using the method for homogeneous equations in Section 2.6 (see Exercises 2.6, 
Problem 46).
‡The symbol J means “is defined to be.”

24          Chapter 1    Introduction
The construction of values yn that approximate the solution values f1xn2 proceeds as follows. 
At the point 1x0, y02, the slope of the solution to (1) is given by dy>dx = f1x0, y02. Hence, the 
tangent line to the solution curve at the initial point 1x0, y02 is
y = y0 + 1x - x02f1x0, y02 .
Using this tangent line to approximate f1x2, we find that for the point x1 = x0 + h
f1x12 ≈y1 J y0 + h f1x0, y02 .
Next, starting at the point 1x1, y12, we construct the line with slope given by the direction  
field at the point 1x1, y12—that is, with slope equal to f 1x1, y12. If we follow this line†  
3namely, y = y1 + 1x - x12f1x1, y124 in stepping from x1 to x2 = x1 + h, we arrive at the 
approximation
f1x22 ≈y2 J y1 + h f1x1, y12 .
Repeating the process (as illustrated in Figure 1.15), we get
f1x32 ≈y3 J y2 + h f1x2, y22 ,
f1x42 ≈y4 J y3 + h f1x3, y32 ,     etc.
This simple procedure is Euler’s method and can be summarized by the recursive formulas

†Because y1 is an approximation to f1x12, we cannot assert that this line is tangent to the solution curve y = f1x2.

Section 1.4    The Approximation Method of Euler          25
Example 1
Use Euler’s method with step size h = 0.1 to approximate the solution to the initial value 
problem
(4)	
y′ = x2y ,    y112 = 4
at the points x = 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, and 1.5.
Solution
Here x0 = 1, y0 = 4, h = 0.1, and f1x, y2 = x2y. Thus, the recursive formula (3) for yn is
yn+1 = yn + h f1xn, yn2 = yn + 10.12 xn2yn .
Substituting n = 0, we get
x1 = x0 + 0.1 = 1 + 0.1 = 1.1 ,
y1 = y0 + 10.12 x02y0 = 4 + 10.12112 24 = 4.2 .
Putting n = 1 yields
x2 = x1 + 0.1 = 1.1 + 0.1 = 1.2 ,
y2 = y1 + 10.12 x12y1 = 4.2 + 10.1211.12 24.2 ≈4.42543 .
Continuing in this manner, we obtain the results listed in Table 1.1. For comparison we have 
included the exact value (to five decimal places) of the solution f1x2 = 1x2 + 722>16 to (4), 
which can be obtained using separation of variables (see Section 2.2). As one might expect, the 
approximation deteriorates as x moves farther away from 1.  ◆

Given the initial value problem (1) and a specific point x, how can Euler’s method be used 
to approximate f1x2? Starting at x0, we can take one giant step that lands on x, or we can take 
several smaller steps to arrive at x. If we wish to take N steps, then we set h = 1x - x02>N 
so that the step size h and the number of steps N are related in a specific way. For example, if  
x0 = 1.5 and we wish to approximate f122 using 10 steps, then we would take h = 
12 - 1.52>10 = 0.05. It is expected that the more steps we take, the better will be the 
approximation. (But keep in mind that more steps mean more computations and hence greater  
accumulated roundoff error.)

26          Chapter 1    Introduction
Remark.  Observe that the solution to (5) is just f1x2 = ex, so Euler’s method will generate 
algebraic approximations to the transcendental number e = 2.71828. . . .
Solution
Here f1x, y2 = y, x0 = 0, and y0 = 1. The recursive formula for Euler’s method is
yn+1 = yn + hyn = 11 + h2yn .
To obtain approximations at x = 1 with N steps, we take the step size h = 1>N. For N = 1, 
we have
f112 ≈y1 = 11 + 12112 = 2 .
For N = 2, f1x22 = f112 ≈y2. In this case we get
 y1 = 11 + 0.52112 = 1.5 ,
 f112 ≈y2 = 11 + 0.5211.52 = 2.25 .
For N = 4, f1x42 = f112 ≈y4, where
 y1 = 11 + 0.252112 = 1.25 ,
 y2 = 11 + 0.25211.252 = 1.5625 ,
 y3 = 11 + 0.25211.56252 = 1.95313 ,
 f112 ≈y4 = 11 + 0.25211.953132 = 2.44141 .
(In the above computations, we have rounded to five decimal places.) Similarly, taking N = 8 
and 16, we obtain even better estimates for f112. These approximations are shown in Table 1.2. 
For comparison, Figure 1.16 on page 27 displays the polygonal-line approximations to ex using 
Euler’s method with h = 1>4 1N = 42 and h = 1>8 1N = 82. Notice that the smaller step 
size yields the better approximation.  ◆

Section 1.4    The Approximation Method of Euler          27
How good (or bad) is Euler’s method? In judging a numerical scheme, we must begin with 
two fundamental questions. Does the method converge? And, if so, what is the rate of conver-
gence? These important issues are discussed in Section 3.6, where improvements in Euler’s 
method are introduced (see also Problems 12 and 13 of this section).

Acknowledging the remote possibility that finer values of h might reveal aberrations, we state 
with reasonable confidence that v10.22 = 0.7 { 0.1. The Intermediate Value Theorem would 
imply that v1t02 = 0 at some time t0 satisfying 0.375 6 t0 6 0.4 if the computations were 
perfect; they clearly provide evidence that t0 = 0.4 { 0.1.  ◆
Example 3
Suppose v1t2 satisfies the initial value problem
dv
dt = -3 - 2v2 , v102 = 2 .
By experimenting with Euler’s method, determine to within one decimal place 1{0.12 the 
value of v10.22 and the time it will take v1t2 to reach zero.
Solution
Determining rigorous estimates of the accuracy of the answers obtained by Euler’s method can 
be quite a challenging problem. The common practice is to repeatedly approximate v10.22 and 
the zero crossing, using smaller and smaller values of h, until the digits of the computed values 
stabilize at the required accuracy level. For this example, Euler’s algorithm yields the following 
values:

In many of the problems below, it will be helpful to have a 
calculator or computer available.† You may also find it con-
venient to write a program for solving initial value problems 
using Euler’s method. (Remember, all trigonometric calcula-
tions are done in radians.)
In Problems 1– 4, use Euler’s method to approximate the 
solution to the given initial value problem at the points

on the same coordinate system.
10.	 Use the strategy of Example 3 to find a value of h for

Also find, to within {0.05, the value of x0 such that

that of the environment; this is known as Newton’s law of 
cooling. However, heat transfer also occurs due to ther-
mal radiation, which according to Stefan’s law of radi-
ation is governed by the difference of the fourth powers 
of these temperatures. In most cases one of these modes 
dominates the other. Problems 15 and 16 invite you to 
simulate each mode numerically for a given set of initial 
conditions.
15.	 Newton’s Law of Cooling.  Newton’s law of cooling 
states that the rate of change in the temperature T1t2 of 
a body is proportional to the difference between the tem-
perature of the medium M1t2 and the temperature of the 
body. That is,
dT
dt = K3M1t2 - T1t24 ,
where K is a constant. Let K = 0.04 (min)-1 and the tem-
perature of the medium be constant, M1t2 K 293 kelvins.

body after

16.	 Stefan’s Law of Radiation.  Stefan’s law of radiation 
states that the rate of change in temperature of a body at 
T1t2 kelvins in a medium at M1t2 kelvins is proportional 
to M4 - T4. That is,
dT
dt = K1M1t24 - T1t242 ,
where K is a constant. Let K = 2.9 * 10-10 (min)-1 
and assume that the medium temperature is constant, 
M1t2 K 293 kelvins. If T102 = 360 kelvins, use Euler’s

Chapter 1 Summary
In this chapter we introduced some basic terminology for differential equations. The order of 
a differential equation is the order of the highest derivative present. The subject of this text is 
ordinary differential equations, which involve derivatives with respect to a single independent 
variable. Such equations are classified as linear or nonlinear.
An explicit solution of a differential equation is a function of the independent variable 
that satisfies the equation on some interval. An implicit solution is a relation between the 
dependent and independent variables that implicitly defines a function that is an explicit solu-
tion. A differential equation typically has infinitely many solutions. In contrast, some theorems 
ensure that a unique solution exists for certain initial value problems in which one must find a 
solution to the differential equation that also satisfies given initial conditions. For an nth-order 
equation, these conditions refer to the values of the solution and its first n - 1 derivatives at 
some point.
Even if one is not successful in finding explicit solutions to a differential equation, several 
techniques can be used to help analyze the solutions. One such method for first-order equations 
views the differential equation dy>dx = f1x, y2 as specifying directions (slopes) at points on 
the plane. The conglomerate of such slopes is the direction field for the equation. Knowing 
the “flow of solutions” is helpful in sketching the solution to an initial value problem. Further-
more, carrying out this method algebraically leads to numerical approximations to the desired 
solution. This numerical process is called Euler’s method.
In Problems 1– 6, identify the independent variable, dependent 
variable, and determine whether the equation is linear or 
nonlinear.

The initial value problem

y′1x2 = f1x, y2 ,    y1x02 = y0

Equation (4) can be used to generate successive approximations of a solution to (1). Let the

Without further information about the solution to (1), it is common practice to take 
f01x2 K y0.
(a)	 Use Picard’s method with f01x2 K 1 to obtain the next four successive approximations 
of the solution to
(6)	
y′1x2 = y1x2 ,    y102 = 1 .
	
Show that these approximations are just the partial sums of the Maclaurin series for the 
actual solution ex.
(b)	 Use Picard’s method with f01x2 K 0 to obtain the next three successive approximations 
of the solution to the nonlinear problem

y′1x2 = 3x - 3y1x242 ,    y102 = 0 .
	
Graph these approximations for 0 … x … 1.
(c)	 In Problem 29 in Exercises 1.2, we showed that the initial value problem
(8)	
y′1x2 = 33y1x242>3 ,    y122 = 0
	
does not have a unique solution. Show that Picard’s method beginning with f01x2 K 0 
converges to the solution y1x2 K 0, whereas Picard’s method beginning with 
f01x2 = x - 2 converges to the second solution y1x2 = 1x - 223. [Hint: For the 
guess f01x2 = x - 2, show that fn1x2 has the form cn1x - 22rn, where cn S 1 and 
rn S 3 as n S ∞.]
Sketching the direction field of a differential equation dy>dt = f1t, y2 is particularly easy when 
the equation is autonomous—that is, the independent variable t does not appear explicitly:
(9)	
dy
dt = f1y2 .
In Figure 1.18(a) on page 34 the graph exhibits the direction field for 
y′ = -A1y - y12 1y - y221y - y322 
with A 7 0, and some solutions are sketched. Note the following properties of the graphs and 
explain how they follow from the fact that the equation is autonomous:
(a)	 The slopes in the direction field are all identical along horizontal lines.
(b)	 New solutions can be generated from old ones by time shifting [i.e., replacing y1t2 with 
y1t - t02.]
From observation (a) it follows that the entire direction field can be described by a single 
direction “line,” as in Figure 1.18(b).
Of particular interest for autonomous equations are the constant, or equilibrium, solutions 
y1t2 = yi, i = 1, 2, 3. The equilibrium y = y1 is called a stable equilibrium, or sink, because the 
neighboring solutions are attracted to it as t S ∞. Equilibria that repel neighboring solutions, like 
y = y2, are known as sources; all other equilibria are called nodes, illustrated by y = y3. Sources 
and nodes are unstable equilibria.

34          Chapter 1    Introduction
(c)	 Describe how equilibria are characterized by the zeros of the function f1y2 in equation (1) 
and how the sink–source–node distinction can be decided on the basis of the signs of 
f1y2 on either side of its zeros.
Therefore, the simple phase line depicted in Figure 1.18(c), which indicates with dots and 
arrows only the zeros and signs of f1y2, is sufficient to describe the nature of the equilibrium 
solutions for an autonomous equation.
(d)	 Sketch the phase line for y′ = 1y - 121y - 221y - 32 and state the nature of its equi-
libria.
(e)	 Use the phase line for y′ = - 1y - 125>31y - 2221y - 32 to predict the asymptotic 
behavior as t S ∞ of the solution satisfying y102 = 2.1.
(f)	 Sketch the phase line for y′ = y sin y and state the nature of its equilibria.
(g)	 Sketch the phase lines for y′ = y sin y + 0.1 and y′ = y sin y - 0.1. Discuss the effect 
of the small perturbation {0.1 on the equilibria.
The splitting of the equilibrium at y = 0 that you observed in part (g) is an illustration of 
what is known as bifurcation. The following problem provides a dramatic illustration of the 
effects of bifurcation, in the context of a herd-management situation.
(h)	 When the logistic model, to be discussed in Section 3.2, is applied to the existing data 
for the alligator population on the grounds of Kennedy Space Center in Florida, the  
following differential equation is derived:

Here y1t2 is the population and time t is measured in years. If hunters were allowed to 
thin the population at a rate of s alligators per year, the equation would be modified to

Draw the phase lines for s = 0, 50, 100, 125, 150, 175, and 200. Discuss the signifi-
cance of the equilibria. Note the bifurcation at s = 175; should a depletion rate near

“The more, the better” is a description that applies to many things, particularly in economics. Any 
increase in wealth results in an improved lifestyle (country music and fairy tales notwithstand-
ing). But once you have become a billionaire, earning another million dollars is not as gratify-
ing as earning the first million was. So a realistic “benefit” function is likely to take the shape 
shown in Figure 1.19. It is monotonically increasing - its slope is always positive - but the slope 
decreases; economists say it has diminishing marginal benefit.
The benefit function y1x2 has the properties y1x2 Ú 0, y′1x2 7 0, y″1x2 6 0 for positive 
x. (It is concave.) Such a function is y1x2 = xa with 0 6 a 6 1, since y′1x2 = axa-1 7 0 and 
y″1x2 = a1a - 12xa-2 6 0. Below we give two examples where concave functions arise in the 
field of economics.
Agrarian Economy  As a model of an agrarian economy, where a population of size N con-
sumes food produced from the land, the total amount F of food available should increase with the 
amount L of land available per person, in the manner of a diminishing marginal benefit. It should 
also increase with the number N of people available to work the land. This is commonly modeled 
by the formula
(10)	
F = Aa L
N b
a
 N ,
where 0 6 a 6 1 and the constant A is a parameter measuring the effectiveness of the farming 
technology. Assume the survival birth rate increases with the amount of food available per per-
son, so if D denotes the death rate (assumed constant), the rate of change of the population might 
be modeled by the differential equation
(11)	
dN
dt = c Qa F
N b

where 0 6 b 6 1 and Q measures the effectiveness of the fertility technology. (Note the diminishing 
marginal benefit mode in (11) as well as (10).)
(a)	 Insert (10) into (11) and use phase line analysis (Project B) to investigate the (nonzero) 
equilibrium population level. Is the equilibrium stable? How does this equilibrium 
population depend on the technology parameters A and Q?
(b)	 Show that when the farming technology improves, the equilibrium population increases 
so as to maintain the same level of food consumed per person F>N.
(c)	 Show that when the fertility technology improves, everyone’s dinner portions F>N 
diminish.

Growth of Capital  Let k be the amount of capital invested in a country’s industries at time t 
months. The investment yields a monthly return of Bka units of capital, where the constant B is 
a measure of the country’s technological prowess and a is a constant satisfying 0 6 a 6 1. Part 
of this output, which is denoted by cm, is needed for subsistence (consumption), part of the net 
output Bka - cm is reinvested (i.e., added to the capital accumulation) and the remainder is used 
for additional consumption. Assume that the subsistence consumption per month remains con-
stant and that one-third of the net output is reinvested each month. If the capital depreciates at a 
constant rate D, then a simple model for the rate of change in capital per month is the following:
(12)

dt = 1
3 3Bka - cm4 - Dk .
More precisely, since the consumption cannot exceed the output, we obtain
(13)

(d)	 Typical curves for the terms in the right-hand member of (13) are displayed in Figure 1.20 
for three different values of cm. Identify the equilibria in each case, sketch the phase line 
(see Project B), and determine the stability of the equilibria (are they sources, sinks or  
neither?).
(e)	 For the situation depicted by the third curve in Figure 1.20, set a = 1>2 and express the 
equilibrium levels for k as functions of B and D. How do the equilibrium levels behave 
when B is increased, or when D is increased?

Euler’s method is based on the fact that the tangent line gives a good local approximation for 
the function. But why restrict ourselves to linear approximants when higher-degree polynomial 
approximants are available? For example, we can use the Taylor polynomial of degree n about  
x = x0, which is defined by

To determine the Taylor series for the solution f1x2 to the initial value problem
dy>dx = f1x, y2 ,    y1x02 = y0 ,
we need only determine the values of the derivatives of f (assuming they exist) at x0; that is, 
f1x02, f′1x02, . . . . The initial condition gives the first value f1x02 = y0. Using the equation 
y′ = f1x, y2, we find f′1x02 = f1x0, y02. To determine f″1x02, we differentiate the equation 
y′ = f1x, y2 implicitly with respect to x to obtain
y″ = 0f
0x + 0f
0y dy
dx = 0f
0x + 0f

a calculator or tables to find the exact values of f1x2 to the nearest thousandth. Finally, 
decide which of the first four methods in Table 1.3 will yield the closest approximation 
to f1102 and give the reasons for your choice. (Remember that the computation of 
trigonometric functions must be done in the radian mode.)

CHAPTER

First-Order Differential 
Equations
2.1  Introduction: Motion of a Falling Body
Newton’s second law states that force is equal to mass times acceleration. We can express this 
by the equation
m dv
dt = F ,
where F represents the total force on the object, m is the mass of the object, and dv>dt is the 
acceleration, expressed as the derivative of velocity with respect to time. It will be convenient 
in the future to define v as positive when it is directed downward (as opposed to the analysis in 
Section 1.1).
Near Earth’s surface, the force due to gravity is just the weight of the objects and is also 
directed downward. This force can be expressed by mg, where g is the acceleration due to 
gravity. No general law precisely models the air resistance acting on the object, since this force 
seems to depend on the velocity of the object, the density of the air, and the shape of the object, 
among other things. However, in some instances air resistance can be reasonably represented 
by -bv, where b is a positive constant depending on the density of the air and the shape of the 
object. We use the negative sign because air resistance is a force that opposes the motion. The 
forces acting on the object are depicted in Figure 2.1 on page 39. (Note that we have general-
ized the free-fall model in Section 1.1 by including air resistance.)
Applying Newton’s law, we obtain the first-order differential equation
(1)	
m dY
dt = mg −bY .
To solve this equation, we exploit a technique called separation of variables, which was used 
to analyze the radioactive decay model in Section 1.1 and will be developed in full detail in 
Section 2.2. Treating dv and dt as differentials, we rewrite equation (1) so as to isolate the vari-
ables v and t on opposite sides of the equation:
dv
mg - bv = dt
m .
(Hence, the nomenclature “separation of variables.”)
An object falls through the air toward Earth. Assuming that the only forces acting 
on the object are gravity and air resistance, determine the velocity of the object as 
a function of time.

Therefore,
0 mg - bv0 = e-bce-bt>m
or
mg - bv = Ae-bt>m ,
where the new constant A has magnitude e-bc and the same sign 1 {2 as 1mg - bv2. Solving 
for v, we obtain
(4)	
v = mg
b - A
b
 e-bt>m ,
which is called a general solution to the differential equation because, as we will see in 
Section 2.3, every solution to (1) can be expressed in the form given in (4).
In a specific case, we would be given the values of m, g, and b. To determine the constant 
A in the general solution, we can use the initial velocity of the object v0. That is, we solve the 
initial value problem
m dv
dt = mg - bv ,    v102 = v0 .
Substituting v = v0 and t = 0 into the general solution to the differential equation, we can 
solve for A. With this value for A, the solution to the initial value problem is

Chapter 2    First-Order Differential Equations
The preceding formula gives the velocity of the object falling through the air as a func-
tion of time if the initial velocity of the object is v0. In Figure 2.2 we have sketched the 
graph of v1t2 for various values of v0. It appears from Figure 2.2 that the velocity v1t2 
approaches mg>b regardless of the initial velocity v0. 3This is easy to see from formula (5) 
by letting t S + ∞.4 The constant mg>b is referred to as the limiting or terminal velocity 
of the object.
From this model for a falling body, we can make certain observations. Because e-bt>m 
rapidly tends to zero, the velocity is approximately the weight, mg, divided by the coef-
ficient of air resistance, b. Thus, in the presence of air resistance, the heavier the object, 
the faster it will fall, assuming shapes and sizes are the same. Also, when air resistance is 
lessened (b is made smaller), the object will fall faster. These observations certainly agree 
with our experience.
Many other physical problems,† when formulated mathematically, lead to first-order dif-
ferential equations or initial value problems. Several of these are discussed in Chapter 3. In 
this chapter we learn how to recognize and obtain solutions for some special types of first-
order equations. We begin by studying separable equations, then linear equations, and then 
exact equations. The methods for solving these are the most basic. In the last two sections, we 
illustrate how devices such as integrating factors, substitutions, and transformations can be 
used to transform certain equations into either separable, exact, or linear equations that we can 
solve. Through our discussion of these special types of equations, you will gain insight into the 
behavior of solutions to more general equations and the possible difficulties in finding these 
solutions.
A word of warning is in order: In solving differential equations, integration plays an essen-
tial role. In particular, the separable equations in Section 2.2 always entail integration, as dem-

Separable Equation
Definition 1.	 If the right-hand side of the equation
dy
dx = ƒ1x, y2
can be expressed as a function g1x2 that depends only on x times a function p1y2 that 
depends only on y, then the differential equation is called separable.†
A simple class of first-order differential equations that can be solved using integration is the 
class of separable equations. These are equations
(1)	
dy
dx = ƒ1x, y2 ,
that can be rewritten to isolate the variables x and y (together with their differentials dx and dy) 
on opposite sides of the equation, as in
h1y2 dy = g1x2 dx .
So the original right-hand side f1x, y2 must have the factored form
ƒ1x, y2 = g1x2 #
1
h1y2 .
More formally, we write p1y2 = 1>h1y2 and present the following definition.
2.2  Separable Equations
In other words, a first-order equation is separable if it can be written in the form
dy
dx = g1x2 p1y2 .
For example, the equation
dy
dx = 2x + xy
y2 + 1
is separable, since (if one is sufficiently alert to detect the factorization)
2x + xy
y2 + 1 = x  2 + y
y2 + 1 = g1x2 p1y2 .
However, the equation
dy
dx = 1 + xy
admits no such factorization of the right-hand side and so is not separable.
Informally speaking, one solves separable equations by performing the separation and 
then integrating each side.
†Historical Footnote: A procedure for solving separable equations was discovered implicitly by Gottfried Leibniz in 
1691. The explicit technique called separation of variables was formalized by John Bernoulli in 1694.

Chapter 2    First-Order Differential Equations
Caution: Constant functions y K c such that p1c2 = 0 are also solutions to (2), but will 
not be included in (3) (see remarks on page 45).
We will look at the mathematical justification of this “streamlined” procedure shortly, but 
first we study some examples.
Example 1
Solve the nonlinear equation
dy
dx = x - 5
y2  .
Solution
Following the streamlined approach, we separate the variables and rewrite the equation in the form
y2 dy = 1x - 52 dx .
Integrating, we have
 
L
y2 dy =
L
1x - 52 dx
 y3
3 = x2
2 - 5x + C ,
and solving this last equation for y gives
y = a 3x2
2 - 15x + 3Cb
1>3
 .
Since C is a constant of integration that can be any real number, 3C can also be any real num-
ber. Replacing 3C by the single symbol K, we then have
y = a 3x2
2 - 15x + Kb
1>3
 .
If we wish to abide by the custom of letting C represent an arbitrary constant, we can go one 
step further and use C instead of K in the final answer. This solution family is graphed in 
Figure 2.3 on page 43.  ◆
Method for Solving Separable Equations
To solve the equation
(2)	
dy
dx = g1x2 p1y2
multiply by dx and by h1y2 J 1>p1y2 to obtain
h1y2 dy = g1x2 dx .
Then integrate both sides:
L
h1y2 dy =
L
g1x2 dx ,
(3)	
H1y2 = G1x2 + C ,
where we have merged the two constants of integration into a single symbol C. The last 
equation gives an implicit solution to the differential equation.

As Example 1 attests, separable equations are among the easiest to solve. However, the 
procedure does require a facility for computing integrals. Many of the procedures to be dis-
cussed in the text also require a familiarity with the techniques of integration. For this reason 
we have provided a review of integration methods in Appendix A and a brief table of integrals 
at the back of the book.

(5)	
 ln 0 y - 10 = ln 0 x + 30 + C .
At this point, we can either solve for y explicitly (retaining the constant C) or use the initial 
condition to determine C and then solve explicitly for y. Let’s try the first approach.
Exponentiating equation (5), we have
 eln 0y-10 = eln 0x+30 +C = eCeln 0x+30 ,
(6)	
 0 y - 10 = eC 0 x + 30 = C1 0 x + 30  ,
where C1 J eC.‡ Now, depending on the values of y, we have 0 y - 10 = {1y - 12; and 
similarly, 0 x + 30 = {1x + 32. Thus, (6) can be written as
y - 1 = {C11x + 32    or    y = 1 { C11x + 32 ,
†The gaps in the curves reflect the fact that in the original differential equation, y appears in the denominator, so that  
y = 0 must be excluded.
‡Recall that the symbol J means “is defined to be.”

Chapter 2    First-Order Differential Equations
where the choice of sign depends (as we said) on the values of x and y. Because C1 is a positive 
constant (recall that C1 = eC 7 0), we can replace {C1 by K, where K now represents an arbi-
trary nonzero constant. We then obtain
(7)	
y = 1 + K1x + 32 .
Finally, we determine K such that the initial condition y1 -12 = 0 is satisfied. Putting x = -1 
and y = 0 in equation (7) gives
0 = 1 + K1 -1 + 32 = 1 + 2K ,
and so K = -1>2. Thus, the solution to the initial value problem is
(8)	
y = 1 - 1
2
 1x + 32 = - 1
2
 1x + 12 .
Alternative Approach.  The second approach is to first set x = -1 and y = 0 in equation (5) 
and solve for C. In this case, we obtain
 ln 0 0 - 10 = ln 0 -1 + 30 + C ,
 0 = ln 1 = ln 2 + C ,
and so C = -ln 2. Thus, from (5), the solution y is given implicitly by
ln11 - y2 = ln1x + 32 - ln 2 .
Here we have replaced 0 y - 10  by 1 - y and 0 x + 30  by x + 3, since we are interested in x and y 
near the initial values x = -1, y = 0 (for such values, y - 1 6 0 and x + 3 7 0). Solving for 
y, we find
 ln11 - y2 = ln1x + 32 - ln 2 = lna x + 3

which agrees with the solution (8) found by the first method.  ◆
Example 3
Solve the nonlinear equation
(9)	
dy
dx = 6x5 - 2x + 1
cos y + ey  .
Solution
Separating variables and integrating, we find
 1cos y + ey2 dy = 16x5 - 2x + 12 dx ,
 
L
1cos y + ey2 dy =
L
16x5 - 2x + 12 dx ,
 sin y + ey = x6 - x2 + x + C .
At this point, we reach an impasse. We would like to solve for y explicitly, but we cannot. This 
is often the case in solving nonlinear first-order equations. Consequently, when we say “solve 
the equation,” we must on occasion be content if only an implicit form of the solution has been 
found.  ◆

Section 2.2    Separable Equations          45
The separation of variables technique, as well as several other techniques discussed in this 
book, entails rewriting a differential equation by performing certain algebraic operations on 
it. “Rewriting dy>dx = g1x2p1y2 as h1y2 dy = g1x2 dx” amounts to dividing both sides by 
p1y2. You may recall from your algebra days that doing this can be treacherous. For example, 
the equation x1x - 22 = 41x - 22 has two solutions: x = 2 and x = 4. But if we “rewrite” 
the equation as x = 4 by dividing both sides by 1x - 22, we lose track of the root x = 2. 
Thus, we should record the zeros of 1x - 22 itself before dividing by this factor.
By the same token we must take note of the zeros of p1y2 in the separable equation 
dy>dx = g1x2p1y2 prior to dividing. After all, if (say) g1x2p1y2 = 1x - 2221y - 132, then 
observe that the constant function y1x2 K 13 solves the differential equation dy>dx = g1x2p1y2:
 dy
dx = d1132
dx
= 0 ,
 g1x2p1y2 = 1x - 222113 - 132 = 0 .
Indeed, in solving the equation of Example 2,
dy
dx = y - 1
x + 3 ,
we obtained y = 1 + K1x + 32 as the set of solutions, where K was a nonzero constant (since 
K replaced { eC). But notice that the constant function y K 1 (which in this case corresponds 
to K = 0) is also a solution to the differential equation. The reason we lost this solution can be 
traced back to a division by y - 1 in the separation process. (See Problem 30 for an example of 
where a solution is lost and cannot be retrieved by setting the constant K = 0.)
Formal Justification of Method
We close this section by reviewing the separation of variables procedure in a more rigorous 
framework. The original differential equation (2) is rewritten in the form
(10)	
h1y2 dy
dx = g1x2 ,
where h1y2 J 1>p1y2. Letting H1y2 and G1x2 denote antiderivatives (indefinite integrals) 
of h1y2 and g1x2, respectively—that is,
H′1y2 = h1y2 ,    G′1x2 = g1x2 ,
we recast equation (10) as
H′1y2 dy
dx = G′1x2 .
By the chain rule for differentiation, the left-hand side is the derivative of the composite func-
tion H1y1x22:
d
dx
 H1y1x22 = H′1y1x22dy
dx .
Thus, if y1x2 is a solution to equation (2), then H1y1x22 and G1x2 are two functions of x that 
have the same derivative. Therefore, they differ by a constant:
(11)	
H1y1x22 = G1x2 + C .
Equation (11) agrees with equation (3), which was derived informally, and we have thus 
verified that the latter can be used to construct implicit solutions.

integration (integrals with variable upper limit). For 
example, consider the initial value problem
dy
dx = ex2y2 ,    y122 = 1 .

was so important that we stated an existence and unique-
ness theorem, Theorem 1, page 11. The method for sepa-
rable equations can give us a solution, but it may not give 
us all the solutions (also see Problem 30). To illustrate

(The solution y K 0 was lost because of the division by

page 42 requires division by p1y2, and this may disguise 
the fact that the roots of the equation p1y2 = 0 are actu-
ally constant solutions to the differential equation.

to derive the solution,
y = -1 + 1x2>6 - x + C23 .

31.	 Interval of Definition.  By looking at an initial value 
problem dy>dx = f1x, y2 with y1x02 = y0, it is not 
always possible to determine the domain of the solution 
y1x2 or the interval over which the function y1x2 satis-

and use it to guess the value of limxS ∞ f1x2.
	
(b)	 Use Euler’s method with a step size of 0.1 to find an

(c)	 Find a formula for f1x2 and graph f1x2 on the 
direction field from part (a).
	
(d)	 What is the exact value of f112? Compare with 
your approximation in part (b).
	
(e)	 Using the exact solution obtained in part (c), determine

33.	 Mixing.  Suppose a brine containing 0.3 kilogram (kg) 
of salt per liter (L) runs into a tank initially filled with 
400 L of water containing 2 kg of salt. If the brine enters 
at 10 L/min, the mixture is kept uniform by stirring, and 
the mixture flows out at the same rate. Find the mass of 
salt in the tank after 10 min (see Figure 2.4). [Hint: Let 
A denote the number of kilograms of salt in the tank at t 
min after the process begins and use the fact that
rate of increase in A = rate of input - rate of exit.
A further discussion of mixing problems is given in 
Section 3.2.]

of cooling, if an object at temperature T is immersed in a 
medium having the constant temperature M, then the rate 
of change of T is proportional to the difference of tem-
perature M - T. This gives the differential equation

(Further applications of Newton’s law of cooling appear 
in Section 3.3.)
35.	 Blood plasma is stored at 40°F. Before the plasma can be 
used, it must be at 90°F. When the plasma is placed in 
an oven at 120°F, it takes 45 min for the plasma to warm 
to 90°F. Assume Newton’s law of cooling (Problem 34) 
applies. How long will it take for the plasma to warm 
to 90°F if the oven temperature is set at (a) 100°F, 
(b) 140°F, and (c) 80°F?
36.	 A pot of boiling water at 100°C is removed from a stove 
and covered at time t = 0 and left to cool in the kitchen. 
After 5 min, the water temperature has decreased to 80°C, 
and another 5 min later it has dropped to 65°C. Assuming 
Newton’s law of cooling (Problem 34) applies, determine 
the (constant) temperature of the kitchen.

where m is the mass, g is the acceleration due to gravity, 
and b 7 0 is a constant (see Figure 2.1). If m = 100 kg,

driver B’s speed remained constant, who won the race?
40.	 The atmospheric pressure (force per unit area) on a sur-
face at an altitude z is due to the weight of the column of 
air situated above the surface. Therefore, the drop in air 
pressure p between the top and bottom of a cylindrical  
volume element of height ∆z and cross-section area  
A equals the weight of the air enclosed (density r times 
volume V = A∆z times gravity g), per unit area:

A
= -r1z2g∆z .
Let 
∆z S 0 to derive the differential equation 
dp>dz = -rg. To analyze this further we must postulate 
a formula that relates pressure and density. The perfect 
gas law relates pressure, volume, mass m, and absolute 
temperature T according to pV = mRT>M, where R  
is the universal gas constant and M is the molar mass  
(i.e., the mass of one mole) of the air. Therefore, density 
and pressure are related by r := m>V = Mp>RT.

determine the height of the building. Take  
R = 8.31 N-m>mol-K, M = 0.029 kg>mol, and 
g = 9.8 m>sec2. (An amusing story concerning this 
problem can be found at http://www.snopes.com/

A type of first-order differential equation that occurs frequently in applications is the linear 
equation. Recall from Section 1.1 that a linear first-order equation is an equation that can be 
expressed in the form

a11x2 dy
dx + a01x2y = b1x2 ,
where a11x2, a01x2, and b1x2 depend only on the independent variable x, not on y.

However, the equation

There are two situations for which the solution of a linear differential equation is quite 
immediate. The first arises if the coefficient a01x2 is identically zero, for then equation (1) 
reduces to
(2)	
a11x2 dy
dx = b1x2 ,
which is equivalent to
y1x2 =
L
b1x2
a11x2
 dx + C
3as long as a11x2 is not zero4.
The second is less trivial. Note that if a01x2 happens to equal the derivative of a11x2—that 
is, a01x2 = a=
11x2—then the two terms on the left-hand side of equation (1) simply comprise 
the derivative of the product a11x2y:
a11x2y′ + a01x2y = a11x2y′ + a=
11x2y = d
dx
 3a11x2y4 .
Therefore equation (1) becomes
(3)	
d
dx
 3a11x2y4 = b1x2
and the solution is again elementary:
a11x2y =
L
b1x2 dx + C ,
y1x2 =
1
a11x2 c
L
b1x2 dx + Cd  .
One can seldom rewrite a linear differential equation so that it reduces to a form as simple 
as (2). However, the form (3) can be achieved through multiplication of the original equation 
(1) by a well-chosen function m1x2. Such a function m1x2 is then called an “integrating fac-
tor” for equation (1). The easiest way to see this is first to divide the original equation (1) by 
a11x2 and put it into standard form
(4)	
dy
dx + P1x2y = Q1x2 ,
where P1x2 = a01x2>a11x2 and Q1x2 = b1x2>a11x2.
Next we wish to determine m1x2 so that the left-hand side of the multiplied equation
(5)	
m1x2 dy
dx + m1x2P1x2y = m1x2Q1x2

50	
Chapter 2    First-Order Differential Equations
is just the derivative of the product m1x2y:
m1x2 dy
dx + M1x2P1x2y = d
dx
 3m1x2y4 = m1x2 dy
dx + M′1x2y .
Clearly, this requires that μ satisfy
(6)	
m′ = mP .
To find such a function, we recognize that equation (6) is a separable differential equation, 
which we can write as 11>m2 dm = P1x2dx. Integrating both sides gives
(7)	
M1x2 = e1 P1x2 dx .
With this choice† for m1x2, equation (5) becomes
d
dx
 3m1x2y4 = m1x2Q1x2 ,
which has the solution
(8)	
y1x2 =
1
m1x2 c
L
m1x2Q1x2 dx + Cd  .
Here C is an arbitrary constant, so (8) gives a one-parameter family of solutions to (4). This 
form is known as the general solution to (4).
We can summarize the method for solving linear equations as follows.
†Any choice of the integration constant in 1P1x2 dx will produce a suitable m1x2.
Method for Solving Linear Equations
(a)	 Write the equation in the standard form
dy
dx + P1x2y = Q1x2 .
(b)	 Calculate the integrating factor m1x2 by the formula
m1x2 = expc
L

(c)	 Multiply the equation in standard form by m1x2 and, recalling that the left-hand side

Here P1x2 = -2>x, so

Thus, an integrating factor is
m1x2 = e-2 ln 0x0 = eln1x - 22 = x-2 .

x-2 dy

In the next example, we encounter a linear equation that arises in the study of the radioactive 
decay of an isotope.

52	
Chapter 2    First-Order Differential Equations
Example 2
A rock contains two radioactive isotopes, RA1 and RA2, that belong to the same radioactive 
series; that is, RA1 decays into RA2, which then decays into stable atoms. Assume that the rate 
at which RA1 decays into RA2 is 50e-10t kg/sec. Because the rate of decay of RA2 is propor-
tional to the mass y1t2 of RA2 present, the rate of change in RA2 is
 dy
dt = rate of creation - rate of decay ,
(12)	
 dy
dt = 50e-10t - ky ,
where k 7 0 is the decay constant. If k = 2>sec and initially y102 = 40 kg, find the mass 
y1t2 of RA2 for t Ú 0.
Solution
Equation (12) is linear, so we begin by writing it in standard form
(13)	
dy
dt + 2y = 50e-10t ,    y102 = 40 ,
where we have substituted k = 2 and displayed the initial condition. We now see that P1t2 = 2, 
so 1P1t2dt = 12 dt = 2t. Thus, an integrating factor is m1t2 = e2t. Multiplying equation 
(13) by m1t2 yields
 e2t dy
dt + 2e2ty = 50e-10t+2t = 50e-8t ,
3
 d
dt
 1e2ty2
 = 50e-8t .
Integrating both sides and solving for y, we find
 e2ty = - 25
4
 e-8t + C ,
 y = - 25
4
 e-10t + Ce-2t .
Substituting t = 0 and y102 = 40 gives
40 = - 25
4
 e0 + Ce0 = - 25
4 + C ,
so C = 40 + 25>4 = 185>4. Thus, the mass y1t2 of RA2 at time t is given by
(14)	
y1t2 = a 185
4 be-2t - a 25
4 be-10t ,    t Ú 0 .  ◆
Example 3
For the initial value problem
y′ + y = 21 + cos2x ,    y112 = 4 ,
find the value of y122.
Solution
The integrating factor for the differential equation is, from equation (7),
m1x2 = e1 1 dx = ex .

Section 2.3    Linear Equations          53
The general solution form (8) thus reads
y1x2 = e-xa 3ex21 + cos2x  dx + Cb .
However, this indefinite integral cannot be expressed in finite terms with elementary functions 
(recall a similar situation in Problem 27 of Exercises 2.2). Because we can use numerical algo-
rithms such as Simpson’s rule (Appendix C) to perform definite integration, we revert to the 
form (5), which in this case reads
d
dx
 1exy2 = ex21 + cos2x ,
and take the definite integral from the initial value x = 1 to the desired value x = 2:
exy `
x = 2
x = 1
= e2y122 - e1y112 =
L
x = 2
x = 1
ex21 + cos2x  dx .
Inserting the given value of y112 and solving, we express
y122 = e-2+1142 + e-2 
L
2
1
ex21 + cos2x  dx .
Using Simpson’s rule, we find that the definite integral is approximately 4.841, so
y122 ≈ 4e-1 + 4.841e-2 ≈ 2.127 .  ◆
In Example 3 we had no difficulty expressing the integral for the integrating factor 
m1x2 = e11 dx = ex. Clearly, situations will arise where this integral, too, cannot be expressed 
with elementary functions. In such cases we must again resort to a numerical procedure such as 
Euler’s method (Section 1.4) or to a “nested loop” implementation of Simpson’s rule. You are 
invited to explore such a possibility in Problem 27.
Because we have established explicit formulas for the solutions to linear first-order differ-
ential equations, we get as a dividend a direct proof of the following theorem.
The essentials of the proof of Theorem 1 are contained in the deliberations leading  
to equation (8); Problem 34 provides the details. This theorem differs from Theorem 1 on  
page 11 in that for the linear initial value problem (15), we have the existence and uniqueness 
of the solution on the whole interval 1a, b2, rather than on some smaller unspecified interval 
about x0.
Existence and Uniqueness of Solution
Theorem 1.	
If P1x2 and Q1x2 are continuous on an interval 1a, b2 that contains the 
point x0, then for any choice of initial value y0, there exists a unique solution y1x2 on 
1a, b2 to the initial value problem
(15)	
dy
dx + P1x2y = Q1x2 ,    y1x02 = y0 .
In fact, the solution is given by (8) for a suitable value of C.

Chapter 2    First-Order Differential Equations
The theory of linear differential equations is an important branch of mathematics not only 
because these equations occur in applications but also because of the elegant structure associ-
ated with them. For example, first-order linear equations always have a general solution given by 
equation (8). Some further properties of first-order linear equations are described in Problems 28 
and 36. Higher-order linear equations are treated in Chapters 4, 6, and 8.
In Problems 1–6, determine whether the given equation is 
separable, linear, neither, or both.

23.	 Radioactive Decay.  In Example 2 assume that the rate 
at which RA1 decays into RA2 is 40e-20t kg>sec and the 
decay constant for RA2 is k = 5/sec. Find the mass y1t2 
of RA2 for t Ú 0 if initially y102 = 10 kg.
24.	 In Example 2 the decay constant for isotope RA1 was  
10/sec, which expresses itself in the exponent of the rate 
term 50e-10t kg>sec. When the decay constant for RA2 
is k = 2 /sec, we see that in formula (14) for y the term 
1185>42e-2t eventually dominates (has greater magni-
tude for t large).

should take into account the number of functional evalua-
tions in each algorithm as well as the inherent accuracies.]

30.	 Bernoulli Equations.  The equation

dy

is an example of a Bernoulli equation. (Further discussion 
of Bernoulli equations is in Section 2.6.)

(b)	 Solve equation (19) for v. Then make the substitution 
v = y3 to obtain the solution to equation (18).
31.	 Discontinuous Coefficients.  As we will see in Chapter 3,  
occasions arise when the coefficient P1x2 in a linear 
equation fails to be continuous because of jump discon-
tinuities. Fortunately, we may still obtain a “reasonable” 
solution. For example, consider the initial value problem
dy
dx + P1x2y = x ,    y102 = 1 ,
where
P1x2 J e1 ,
0 … x … 2 ,
3 ,
x 7 2 .
	
(a)	 Find the general solution for 0 … x … 2.
	
(b)	 Choose the constant in the solution of part (a) so that 
the initial condition is satisfied.
	
(c)	 Find the general solution for x 7 2.
	
(d)	 Now choose the constant in the general solution from 
part (c) so that the solution from part (b) and the 
solution from part (c) agree at x = 2. By patching 
the two solutions together, we can obtain a continu-
ous function that satisfies the differential equation 
except at x = 2, where its derivative is undefined.
	
(e)	 Sketch the graph of the solution from x = 0 to x = 5.
32.	 Discontinuous Forcing Terms.  There are occasions 
when the forcing term Q1x2 in a linear equation fails to be 
continuous because of jump discontinuities. Fortunately, 
we may still obtain a reasonable solution imitating the pro-
cedure discussed in Problem 31. Use this procedure to find 
the continuous solution to the initial value problem.
dy
dx + 2y = Q1x2 ,    y102 = 0 ,
where
Q1x2 J e   2 ,
0 … x … 3 ,
-2 ,
x 7 3 .
Sketch the graph of the solution from x = 0 to x = 7.
33.	 Singular Points.  Those values of x for which P1x2 in 
equation (4) is not defined are called singular points of 
the equation. For example, x = 0 is a singular point of 
the equation xy′ + 2y = 3x, since when the equation is 
written in the standard form, y′ + 12>x2y = 3, we see 
that P1x2 = 2>x is not defined at x = 0. On an interval 
containing a singular point, the questions of the existence 
and uniqueness of a solution are left unanswered, since 
Theorem 1 on page 53 does not apply. To show the pos-
sible behavior of solutions near a singular point, consider 
the following equations.
	
(a)	 Show that xy′ + 2y = 3x has only one solution 
defined at x = 0. Then show that the initial value 
problem for this equation with initial condition 
y102 = y0 has a unique solution when y0 = 0 and 
no solution when y0 ≠0.

56	
Chapter 2    First-Order Differential Equations
	
(b)	 Show that xy′ - 2y = 3x has an infinite number 
of solutions defined at x = 0. Then show that the 
initial value problem for this equation with ini-
tial condition y102 = 0 has an infinite number of 
solutions.
34.	 Existence and Uniqueness.  Under the assumptions of 
Theorem 1, we will prove that equation (8) gives a solu-
tion to equation (4) on 1a, b2. We can then choose the 
constant C in equation (8) so that the initial value prob-
lem (15) is solved.
	
(a)	 Show that since P1x2 is continuous on 1a, b2, then 
m1x2 defined in (7) is a positive, continuous func-
tion satisfying dm>dx = P1x2m1x2 on 1a, b2.
	
(b)	 Since
d
dx 
L
m1x2Q1x2dx = m1x2Q1x2 ,
	
verify that y given in equation (8) satisfies equation 
(4) by differentiating both sides of equation (8).
	
(c)	 Show that when we let 1m1x2Q1x2 dx be 
the antiderivative whose value at x0 is 0 (i.e., 
1
x
x0 m1t2Q1t2 dt) and choose C to be y0 m1x02, the 
initial condition y1x02 = y0 is satisfied.
	
(d)	 Start with the assumption that y1x2 is a solution 
to the initial value problem (15) and argue that 
the discussion leading to equation (8) implies that 
y1x2 must obey equation (8). Then argue that the 
initial condition in (15) determines the constant C 
uniquely.
35.	 Mixing.  Suppose a brine containing 0.2 kg of salt 
per liter runs into a tank initially filled with 500 L 
of water containing 5 kg of salt. The brine enters 
the tank at a rate of 5 L/min. The mixture, kept uni-
form by stirring, is flowing out at the rate of 5 L/min  
(see Figure 2.6).
	
(b)	 After 10 min, a leak develops in the tank and an 
additional liter per minute of mixture flows out of 
the tank (see Figure 2.7). What will be the concen-
tration, in kilograms per liter, of salt in the tank  
20 min after the leak develops? [Hint: Use the 
method discussed in Problems 31 and 32.]

36.	 Variation of Parameters.  Here is another procedure 
for solving linear equations that is particularly useful for 
higher-order linear equations. This method is called vari-
ation of parameters. It is based on the idea that just by 
knowing the form of the solution, we can substitute into the 
given equation and solve for any unknowns. Here we illus-
trate the method for first-order equations (see Sections 4.6 
and 6.4 for the generalization to higher-order equations).
	
(a)	 Show that the general solution to
(20)	
dy
dx + P1x2y = Q1x2
	
has the form
y1x2 = Cyh1x2 + yp1x2 ,
	
where yh ( [ 0) is a solution to equation (20) when  
Q1x2 K 0, C is a constant, and yp1x2 = v1x2yh1x2 
for a suitable function v1x2. [Hint: Show that we 
can take yh = m-11x2 and then use equation (8).]
	
  We can in fact determine the unknown function 
yh by solving a separable equation. Then direct sub-
stitution of vyh in the original equation will give a 
simple equation that can be solved for v.

(21), and simplify to obtain v′1x2 = x2>yh1x2.

Section 2.4    Exact Equations          57
	
(d)	 Now integrate to get v1x2.
	
(e)	 Verify that y1x2 = Cyh1x2 + v1x2yh1x2 is a gen-
eral solution to (21).
37.	 Secretion of Hormones. The secretion of hormones 
into the blood is often a periodic activity. If a hormone 
is secreted on a 24-h cycle, then the rate of change of the 
level of the hormone in the blood may be represented by 
the initial value problem
dx
dt = a - b cospt
12 - kx ,    x102 = x0 ,
where x1t2 is the amount of the hormone in the blood at 
time t, a is the average secretion rate, b is the amount of 
daily variation in the secretion, and k is a positive constant 
reflecting the rate at which the body removes the hormone 
from the blood. If a = b = 1, k = 2, and x0 = 10, 
solve for x1t2.
38.	 Use the separation of variables technique to derive the 
solution (7) to the differential equation (6).

Suppose T = 0 at 9:00 a.m., the heating unit is ON  
from 9–10 a.m., OFF from 10–11 a.m., ON again from 
11 a.m.–noon, and so on for the rest of the day. How 
warm will the classroom be at noon? At 5:00 p.m.?
40.	 The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1963 was 
shared by A. L. Hodgkin and A. F. Huxley in recogni-
tion of their model for the firing of neuronal synapses. 
As will be discussed in Chapter 12, they proposed that 
the opening/closing of certain ion channels in the neuron

Suppose the mathematical function F1x, y2 represents some physical quantity, such as tem-
perature, in a region of the xy-plane. Then the level curves of F, where F1x, y2 = constant, 
could be interpreted as isotherms on a weather map, as depicted in Figure 2.8.

How does one calculate the slope of the tangent to a level curve? It is accomplished by 
implicit differentiation: One takes the derivative, with respect to x, of both sides of the equation 
F1x, y2 = C, taking into account that y depends on x along the curve:

The expression obtained by formally multiplying the left-hand member of (1) by dx is known 
as the total differential of F, written dF:

and our procedure for obtaining the equation for the slope ƒ1x, y2 of the level curve 
F1x, y2 = C can be expressed as setting the total differential dF = 0 and solving.
Because equation (2) has the form of a differential equation, we should be able to reverse 
this logic and come up with a very easy technique for solving some differential equations. After 
all, any first-order differential equation dy>dx = ƒ1x, y2 can be rewritten in the (differential) 
form
(3)	
M1x, y2 dx + N1x, y2 dy = 0
(in a variety of ways). Now, if the left-hand side of equation (3) can be identified as a total 
differential,
M1x, y2 dx + N1x, y2 dy = 0F
0x
 dx + 0F
0y
 dy = dF1x, y2 ,
then its solutions are given (implicitly) by the level curves
F1x, y2 = C
for an arbitrary constant C.
Example 1
Solve the differential equation
dy
dx = - 2xy2 + 1
2x2y
 .
Solution
Some of the choices of differential forms corresponding to this equation are
 12xy2 + 12 dx + 2x2y dy = 0 ,
 2xy2 + 1
2x2y
 dx + dy = 0 ,
 dx +
2x2y
2xy2 + 1
 dy = 0 ,  etc.
However, the first form is best for our purposes because it is a total differential of the function 
F1x, y2 = x2y2 + x:
 12xy2 + 12 dx + 2x2y dy = d3x2y2 + x4
 = 0
0x
 1x2y2 + x2 dx + 0

 1x2y2 + x2 dy .
Thus, the solutions are given implicitly by the formula x2y2 + x = C. See Figure 2.9 on

Exact Differential Form
Definition 2.	 The differential form M1x, y2 dx + N1x, y2 dy is said to be exact in a 
rectangle R if there is a function F1x, y2 such that
(4)	
eF
ex
 1x, y2 = M1x, y2  and  eF
ey
 1x, y2 = N1x, y2
for all 1x, y2 in R. That is, the total differential of F1x, y2 satisfies
dF1x, y2 = M1x, y2 dx + N1x, y2 dy .
If M1x, y2 dx + N1x, y2 dy is an exact differential form, then the equation
M1x, y2 dx + N1x, y2 dy = 0
is called an exact equation.
As you might suspect, in applications a differential equation is rarely given to us in exact 
differential form. However, the solution procedure is so quick and simple for such equations 
that we devote this section to it. From Example 1, we see that what is needed is (i) a test to 
determine if a differential form M1x, y2 dx + N1x, y2 dy is exact and, if so, (ii) a procedure for 
finding the function F1x, y2 itself.
The test for exactness arises from the following observation. If
M1x, y2 dx + N1x, y2 dy = 0F

then the calculus theorem concerning the equality of continuous mixed partial derivatives

would dictate a “compatibility condition” on the functions M and N:
0

 N1x, y2 .
In fact, Theorem 2 states that the compatibility condition is also sufficient for the differential 
form to be exact.
Test for Exactness
Theorem 2.	
Suppose the first partial derivatives of M1x, y2 and N1x, y2 are continuous 
in a rectangle R. Then
M1x, y2 dx + N1x, y2 dy = 0
is an exact equation in R if and only if the compatibility condition
(5)	
eM
ey
 1x, y2 = eN
ex
 1x, y2
holds for all 1x, y2 in R.†
Before we address the proof of Theorem 2, note that in Example 1 the differential form 
that led to the total differential was
12xy2 + 12 dx + 12x2y2 dy = 0 .
The compatibility conditions are easily confirmed:
 0M
0y = 0
0y
 12xy2 + 12 = 4xy ,
 0N
0x = 0
0x
 12x2y2 = 4xy .
Also clear is the fact that the other differential forms considered,
2xy2 + 1
2x2y
 dx + dy = 0 ,    dx +
2x2y
2xy2 + 1
 dy = 0 ,
do not meet the compatibility conditions.
Proof of Theorem 2.  There are two parts to the theorem: Exactness implies compatibility, 
and compatibility implies exactness. First, we have seen that if the differential equation is 
exact, then the two members of equation (5) are simply the mixed second partials of a function 
F1x, y2. As such, their equality is ensured by the theorem of calculus that states that mixed 
second partials are equal if they are continuous. Because the hypothesis of Theorem 2 guaran-
tees the latter condition, equation (5) is validated.
†Historical Footnote: This theorem was proven by Leonhard Euler in 1734.

Section 2.4    Exact Equations          61
Rather than proceed directly with the proof of the second part of the theorem, let’s derive 
a formula for a function F1x, y2 that satisfies 0F>0x = M and 0F>0y = N. Integrating the first 
equation with respect to x yields
(6)	
F1x, y2 =
L
M1x, y2 dx + g1y2 .
Notice that instead of using C to represent the constant of integration, we have written g1y2. 
This is because y is held fixed while integrating with respect to x, and so our “constant” may 
well depend on y. To determine g1y2, we differentiate both sides of (6) with respect to y to 
obtain
(7)	
0F
0y
 1x, y2 = 0
0y 
L
M1x, y2 dx + 0
0y
 g1y2 .
As g is a function of y alone, we can write 0g>0y = g′1y2, and solving (7) for g′1y2 gives
g′1y2 = 0F
0y
 1x, y2 - 0
0y 
L
M1x, y2 dx .
Since 0F>0y = N, this last equation becomes
(8)	
g′1y2 = N1x, y2 - 0
0y 
L
M1x, y2 dx .
Notice that although the right-hand side of (8) indicates a possible dependence on x, the 
appearances of this variable must cancel because the left-hand side, g′1y2, depends only on y. By  
integrating (8), we can determine g1y2 up to a numerical constant, and therefore we can deter-
mine the function F1x, y2 up to a numerical constant from the functions M1x, y2 and N1x, y2.
To finish the proof of Theorem 2, we need to show that the condition (5) implies that 
M dx + N dy = 0 is an exact equation. This we do by actually exhibiting a function F1x, y2 
that satisfies 0F>0x = M and 0F>0y = N. Fortunately, we needn’t look too far for such a func-
tion. The discussion in the first part of the proof suggests (6) as a candidate, where g′1y2 is 
given by (8). Namely, we define F1x, y2 by
(9)	
F1x, y2 J
L
x
x0
 M1t, y2 dt + g1y2 ,
where 1x0, y02 is a fixed point in the rectangle R and g1y2 is determined, up to a numerical 
constant, by the equation
(10)	
g′1y2 J N1x, y2 - 0
0y 
L
x
x0
 M1t, y2 dt .
Before proceeding we must address an extremely important question concerning the defi-
nition of F1x, y2. That is, how can we be sure (in this portion of the proof) that g′1y2, as given 
in equation (10), is really a function of just y alone? To show that the right-hand side of (10) 
is independent of x (that is, that the appearances of the variable x cancel), all we need to do is 
show that its partial derivative with respect to x is zero. This is where condition (5) is utilized. 
We leave to the reader this computation and the verification that F1x, y2 satisfies conditions (4) 
(see Problems 35 and 36).  ◆
The construction in the proof of Theorem 2 actually provides an explicit procedure for 
solving exact equations. Let’s recap and look at some examples.

62	
Chapter 2    First-Order Differential Equations
Example 2
Solve
(12)	
12xy - sec2x2 dx + 1x2 + 2y2 dy = 0 .
Solution
Here M1x, y2 = 2xy - sec2x and N1x, y2 = x2 + 2y. Because
0M
0y = 2x = 0N
0x  ,
equation (12) is exact. To find F1x, y2, we begin by integrating M with respect to x:
(13)	
 F1x, y2 =
L
12xy - sec2x2 dx + g1y2
 = x2y - tan x + g1y2 .
Next we take the partial derivative of (13) with respect to y and substitute x2 + 2y for N:
 0F
0y
 1x, y2 = N1x, y2 ,
 x2 + g′1y2 = x2 + 2y .
Thus, g′1y2 = 2y, and since the choice of the constant of integration is not important, we can 
take g1y2 = y2. Hence, from (13), we have F1x, y2 = x2y - tan x + y2, and the solution to 
equation (12) is given implicitly by x2y - tan x + y2 = C.  ◆
Remark.  The procedure for solving exact equations requires several steps. As a check on our 
work, we observe that when we solve for g′1y2, we must obtain a function that is independent 
of x. If this is not the case, then we have erred either in our computation of F1x, y2 or in com-
puting 0M>0y or 0N>0x.
In the construction of F1x, y2, we can first integrate N1x, y2 with respect to y to get
(14)	
F1x, y2 =
L
N1x, y2 dy + h1x2
and then proceed to find h1x2. We illustrate this alternative method in the next example.
Method for Solving Exact Equations
(a)	 If M dx + N dy = 0 is exact, then 0F>0x = M. Integrate this last equation with 
respect to x to get
(11)	
F1x, y2 =
L
M1x, y2 dx + g1y2 .
(b)	 To determine g1y2, take the partial derivative with respect to y of both sides of equa-
tion (11) and substitute N for 0F>0y. We can now solve for g′1y2.
(c)	 Integrate g′1y2 to obtain g1y2 up to a numerical constant. Substituting g1y2 into 
equation (11) gives F1x, y2.
(d)	 The solution to M dx + N dy = 0 is given implicitly by
F1x, y2 = C .
(Alternatively, starting with 0F>0y = N, the implicit solution can be found by first 
integrating with respect to y; see Example 3.)

Section 2.4    Exact Equations          63
Example 3
Solve
(15)	
11 + exy + xexy2 dx + 1xex + 22 dy = 0 .
Solution
Here M = 1 + exy + xexy and N = xex + 2. Because
0M
0y = ex + xex = 0N
0x  ,
equation (15) is exact. If we now integrate N1x, y2 with respect to y, we obtain
F1x, y2 =
L
1xex + 22 dy + h1x2 = xexy + 2y + h1x2 .
When we take the partial derivative with respect to x and substitute for M, we get
 0F
0x
 1x, y2 = M1x, y2
 exy + xexy + h′1x2 = 1 + exy + xexy .
Thus, h′1x2 = 1, so we take h1x2 = x. Hence, F1x, y2 = xexy + 2y + x, and the solution to 
equation (15) is given implicitly by xexy + 2y + x = C. In this case we can solve explicitly for y 
to obtain y = 1C - x2>12 + xex2.  ◆
Remark.  Since we can use either procedure for finding F1x, y2, it may be worthwhile to 
consider each of the integrals 1M1x, y2 dx and 1N1x, y2 dy. If one is easier to evaluate than 
the other, this would be sufficient reason for us to use one method over the other. [The skeptical 
reader should try solving equation (15) by first integrating M1x, y2.]
Example 4
Show that
(16)	
1x + 3x3sin y2 dx + 1x4cos y2 dy = 0
is not exact but that multiplying this equation by the factor x-1 yields an exact equation. Use 
this fact to solve (16).
Solution
In equation (16), M = x + 3x3sin y and N = x4cos y. Because
0M
0y = 3x3cos y [ 4x3cos y = 0N
0x  ,
equation (16) is not exact. When we multiply (16) by the factor x -1, we obtain
(17)	
11 + 3x2sin y2 dx + 1x3cos y2 dy = 0 .
For this new equation, M = 1 + 3x2sin y and N = x3cos y. If we test for exactness, we now 
find that
0M
0y = 3x2cos y = 0N
0x  ,
and hence (17) is exact. Upon solving (17), we find that the solution is given implicitly by 
x + x3sin y = C. Since equations (16) and (17) differ only by a factor of x, then any solution 
to one will be a solution for the other whenever x ≠0. Hence the solution to equation (16) is 
given implicitly by x + x3sin y = C.  ◆
In Section 2.5 we discuss methods for finding factors that, like x-1 in Example 4, change 
inexact equations into exact equations.

32.	 Orthogonal Trajectories.  A geometric problem occur-
ring often in engineering is that of finding a family of 
curves (orthogonal trajectories) that intersects a given 
family of curves orthogonally at each point. For example, 
we may be given the lines of force of an electric field and 
want to find the equation for the equipotential curves. 
Consider the family of curves described by F1x, y2 = k, 
where k is a parameter. Recall from the discussion of 
equation (2) that for each curve in the family, the slope 
is given by
dy

Chapter 2    First-Order Differential Equations
If we take the standard form for the linear differential equation of Section 2.3,
dy
dx + P1x2y = Q1x2 ,
and rewrite it in differential form by multiplying through by dx, we obtain
3P1x2y - Q1x24 dx + dy = 0 .
This form is certainly not exact, but it becomes exact upon multiplication by the integrating 
factor m1x2 = e1 P1x2 dx. We have
3m1x2P1x2y - m1x2Q1x24 dx + m1x2 dy = 0
as the form, and the compatibility condition is precisely the identity m1x2P1x2 = m′1x2 (see 
Problem 20).
This leads us to generalize the notion of an integrating factor.
2.5  Special Integrating Factors
Integrating Factor
Definition 3.	 If the equation
(1)	
M1x, y2 dx + N1x, y2 dy = 0
is not exact, but the equation
(2)	
m1x, y2M1x, y2 dx + m1x, y2N1x, y2 dy = 0 ,
which results from multiplying equation (1) by the function m1x, y2, is exact, then 
m1x, y2 is called an integrating factor† of the equation (1).
Example 1
Show that m1x, y2 = xy2 is an integrating factor for
(3)	
12y - 6x2 dx + 13x - 4x2y-12 dy = 0 .
Use this integrating factor to solve the equation.
Solution
We leave it to you to show that (3) is not exact. Multiplying (3) by m1x, y2 = xy2, we obtain
(4)	
12xy3 - 6x2y22 dx + 13x2y2 - 4x3y2 dy = 0 .
For this equation we have M = 2xy3 - 6x2y2 and N = 3x2y2 - 4x3y. Because
0M
0y
 1x, y2 = 6xy2 - 12x2y = 0N
0x
 1x, y2 ,
equation (4) is exact. Hence, m1x, y2 = xy2 is indeed an integrating factor of equation (3).
†Historical Footnote: A general theory of integrating factors was developed by Alexis Clairaut in 1739. Leonhard 
Euler also studied classes of equations that could be solved using a specific integrating factor.

Let’s now solve equation (4) using the procedure of Section 2.4. To find F1x, y2, we begin 
by integrating M with respect to x:
F1x, y2 =
L
12xy3 - 6x2y22 dx + g1y2 = x2y3 - 2x3y2 + g1y2 .
When we take the partial derivative with respect to y and substitute for N, we find
 0F
0y
 1x, y2 = N 1x, y2
 3x2y2 - 4x3y + g′1y2 = 3x2y2 - 4x3y .
Thus, g′1y2 = 0, so we can take g1y2 K 0. Hence, F1x, y2 = x2y3 - 2x3y2, and the solution 
to equation (4) is given implicitly by
x2y3 - 2x3y2 = C .
Although equations (3) and (4) have essentially the same solutions, it is possible to lose or 
gain solutions when multiplying by m1x, y2. In this case y K 0 is a solution of equation (4) but 
not of equation (3). The extraneous solution arises because, when we multiply (3) by m = xy2 
to obtain (4), we are actually multiplying both sides of (3) by zero if y K 0. This gives us 
y K 0 as a solution to (4), but it is not a solution to (3).  ◆
Generally speaking, when using integrating factors, you should check whether any solu-
tions to m1x, y2 = 0 are in fact solutions to the original differential equation.
How do we find an integrating factor? If m1x, y2 is an integrating factor of (1) with con-
tinuous first partial derivatives, then testing (2) for exactness, we must have
0
0y
 3m1x, y2M1x, y24 = 0
0x
 3m1x, y2N1x, y24 .
By use of the product rule, this reduces to the equation
(5)	
M eM
ey −N eM
ex = a eN
ex −eM
ey bM .
But solving the partial differential equation (5) for μ is usually more difficult than solving the 
original equation (1). There are, however, two important exceptions.
Let’s assume that equation (1) has an integrating factor that depends only on x; that is, 
m = m1x2. In this case equation (5) reduces to the separable equation
(6)	
dm
dx = a
0M>0y - 0N>0x
N
bm ,
where 10M>0y - 0N>0x2>N is (presumably) just a function of x. In a similar fashion, if equa-
tion (1) has an integrating factor that depends only on y, then equation (5) reduces to the sepa-
rable equation
(7)	
dm
dy = a
0N>0x - 0M>0y
M
bm ,
where 10N>0x - 0M>0y2>M is just a function of y.

Chapter 2    First-Order Differential Equations
We can reverse the above argument. In particular, if 10M>0y - 0N>0x2>N is a function that 
depends only on x, then we can solve the separable equation (6) to obtain the integrating factor
m1x2 = expc
L
a
0M>0y - 0N>0x

for equation (1). We summarize these observations in the following theorem.

Theorem 3 suggests the following procedure.
Example 2
Solve
(12)	
12x2 + y2 dx + 1x2y - x2 dy = 0 .
Solution
A quick inspection shows that equation (12) is neither separable nor linear. We also note that
0M
0y = 1 [ 12xy - 12 = 0N
0x  .
Method for Finding Special Integrating Factors
If M dx + N dy = 0 is neither separable nor linear, compute 0M>0y and 0N>0x. If 
0M>0y = 0N>0x, then the equation is exact. If it is not exact, consider
(10)	
0M>0y - 0N>0x
N
 .
If (10) is a function of just x, then an integrating factor is given by formula (8). If not, 
consider
(11)	
0N>0x - 0M>0y
M
 .
If (11) is a function of just y, then an integrating factor is given by formula (9).

Section 2.5    Special Integrating Factors          69
Because (12) is not exact, we compute
0M>0y - 0N>0x
N
= 1 - 12xy - 12
x2y - x
=
211 - xy2
-x11 - xy2 = -2
x  .
We obtain a function of only x, so an integrating factor for (12) is given by formula (8). That is,
m1x2 = expa
L
-2
x
 dxb = x-2 .
When we multiply (12) by m = x-2, we get the exact equation
12 + yx-22 dx + 1y - x-12 dy = 0 .
Solving this equation, we ultimately derive the implicit solution
(13)	
2x - yx-1 + y2
2 = C .
Notice that the solution x K 0 was lost in multiplying by m = x-2. Hence, (13) and x K 0 are 
solutions to equation (12).  ◆
There are many differential equations that are not covered by Theorem 3 but for which an 
integrating factor nevertheless exists. The major difficulty, however, is in finding an explicit 
formula for these integrating factors, which in general will depend on both x and y.
In Problems 1–6, identify the equation as separable, linear, 
exact, or having an integrating factor that is a function of 
either x alone or y alone.

When the equation
M1x, y2 dx + N1x, y2 dy = 0
is not a separable, exact, or linear equation, it may still be possible to transform it into one that 
we know how to solve. This was in fact our approach in Section 2.5, where we used an inte-
grating factor to transform our original equation into an exact equation.
In this section we study four types of equations that can be transformed into either a sepa-
rable or linear equation by means of a suitable substitution or transformation.
2.6  Substitutions and Transformations
Homogeneous Equation
Definition 4.	 If the right-hand side of the equation
(1)	
dy
dx = f1x, y2
can be expressed as a function of the ratio y>x alone, then we say the equation  
is homogeneous.
Homogeneous Equations
Substitution Procedure
(a)	 Identify the type of equation and determine the appropriate substitution or  
transformation.
(b)	 Rewrite the original equation in terms of new variables.
(c)	 Solve the transformed equation.
(d)	 Express the solution in terms of the original variables.

Section 2.6    Substitutions and Transformations          71
For example, the equation
(2)	
1x - y2 dx + x dy = 0
can be written in the form
dy
dx = y - x
x
= y
x - 1 .
Since we have expressed 1y - x2>x as a function of the ratio y>x 3that is, 1y - x2>x = G1y>x2, 
where G1v2 J v - 14, then equation (2) is homogeneous.
The equation
(3)	
1x - 2y + 12 dx + 1x - y2 dy = 0
can be written in the form
dy
dx = x - 2y + 1
y - x
=
1 - 21y>x2 + 11>x2
1y>x2 - 1
 .
Here the right-hand side cannot be expressed as a function of y>x alone because of the term 
1>x in the numerator. Hence, equation (3) is not homogeneous.
One test for the homogeneity of equation (1) is to replace x by tx and y by ty. Then (1) is 
homogeneous if and only if
ƒ1tx, ty2 = ƒ1x, y2
for all t ≠0 [see Problem 43(a)].
To solve a homogeneous equation, we make a rather obvious substitution. Let
Y = y
x .
Our homogeneous equation now has the form
(4)	
dy
dx = G1v2 ,
and all we need is to express dy>dx in terms of x and v. Since v = y>x, then y = vx. Keeping in 
mind that both v and y are functions of x, we use the product rule for differentiation to deduce 
from y = vx that
dy
dx = v + x dv
dx .
We then substitute the above expression for dy>dx into equation (4) to obtain
(5)	
v + x dv
dx = G1v2 .
The new equation (5) is separable, and we can obtain its implicit solution from
L
1
G1v2 - v
 dv =
L
1
x
 dx .
All that remains to do is to express the solution in terms of the original variables x and y.

Chapter 2    First-Order Differential Equations
Example 1
Solve
(6)	
1xy + y2 + x22 dx - x2 dy = 0 .
Solution
A check will show that equation (6) is not separable, exact, or linear. If we express (6) in the 
derivative form
(7)	
dy
dx = xy + y2 + x2
x2
= y
x + a y
xb
2
+ 1 ,
then we see that the right-hand side of (7) is a function of just y>x. Thus, equation (6) is homo-
geneous.
Now let v = y>x and recall that dy>dx = v + x1dv>dx2. With these substitutions, 
equation (7) becomes
v + x dv
dx = v + v2 + 1 .
The above equation is separable, and, on separating the variables and integrating, we obtain
 
L

v2 + 1
 dv =
L

x
 dx ,
 arctan v = ln 0 x0 + C .
Hence,
v = tan1ln 0 x0 + C2 .
Finally, we substitute y>x for v and solve for y to get
y = x tan1ln 0 x0 + C2
as an explicit solution to equation (6). Also note that x K 0 is a solution.  ◆
Equations of the Form dy
dx = G1ax + by2
When the right-hand side of the equation dy>dx = ƒ1x, y2 can be expressed as a function of 
the combination ax + by, where a and b are constants, that is,
dy
dx = G1ax + by2 ,
then the substitution
z = ax + by
transforms the equation into a separable one. The method is illustrated in the next example.
Example 2
Solve
(8)	
dy
dx = y - x - 1 + 1x - y + 22-1 .
Solution
The right-hand side can be expressed as a function of x - y, that is,
y - x - 1 + 1x - y + 22-1 = -1x - y2 - 1 + 31x - y2 + 24-1 ,

Section 2.6    Substitutions and Transformations          73
so let z = x - y. To solve for dy>dx, we differentiate z = x - y with respect to x to obtain 
dz>dx = 1 - dy>dx, and so dy>dx = 1 - dz>dx. Substituting into (8) yields
1 - dz
dx = -z - 1 + 1z + 22-1 ,
or
dz
dx = 1z + 22 - 1z + 22-1 .
Solving this separable equation, we obtain
 
L
z + 2
1z + 222 - 1
 dz =
L
dx ,
 1
2  ln0 1z + 222 - 10 = x + C1 ,
from which it follows that
1z + 222 = Ce2x + 1 .
Finally, replacing z by x - y yields
1x - y + 222 = Ce2x + 1
as an implicit solution to equation (8).  ◆
Bernoulli Equations
Bernoulli Equation
Definition 5.	 A first-order equation that can be written in the form
(9)	
dy
dx + P1x2y = Q1x2yn ,
where P1x2 and Q1x2 are continuous on an interval 1a, b2 and n is a real number, is 
called a Bernoulli equation.†
Notice that when n = 0 or 1, equation (9) is also a linear equation and can be solved by the 
method discussed in Section 2.3. For other values of n, the substitution
Y = y1−n
transforms the Bernoulli equation into a linear equation, as we now show.
†Historical Footnote: This equation was proposed for solution by James Bernoulli in 1695. It was solved by his 
brother John Bernoulli. (James and John were two of eight mathematicians in the Bernoulli family.) In 1696, Gottfried 
Leibniz showed that the Bernoulli equation can be reduced to a linear equation by making the substitution v = y1-n.

74	
Chapter 2    First-Order Differential Equations
Dividing equation (9) by yn yields
(10)	
y-n dy
dx + P1x2y1-n = Q1x2 .
Taking v = y1-n, we find via the chain rule that
dv
dx = 11 - n2y-n dy
dx ,
and so equation (10) becomes
1
1 - n dv
dx + P1x2v = Q1x2 .
Because 1>11 - n2 is just a constant, the last equation is indeed linear.
Example 3
Solve
(11)	
dy
dx - 5y = - 5
2
 xy3 .
Solution
This is a Bernoulli equation with n = 3, P1x2 = -5, and Q1x2 = -5x>2. To transform (11) 
into a linear equation, we first divide by y3 to obtain
y-3 dy
dx - 5y-2 = - 5
2x .
Next we make the substitution v = y-2. Since dv>dx = -2y-3 dy>dx, the transformed equation is
 - 1
2 dv
dx - 5v = - 5
2x ,
(12)	
 dv
dx + 10v = 5x .
Equation (12) is linear, so we can solve it for v using the method discussed in Section 2.3. 
When we do this, it turns out that
v = x
2 - 1
20 + Ce-10x .
Substituting v = y-2 gives the solution
y-2 = x
2 - 1
20 + Ce-10x .
Not included in the last equation is the solution y K 0 that was lost in the process of dividing 
(11) by y3.  ◆
A general formula for the solution to the Bernoulli equation (9) is given in Problem 48.
Equations with Linear Coefficients
We have used various substitutions for y to transform the original equation into a new equation 
that we could solve. In some cases we must transform both x and y into new variables, say, u and 
v. This is the situation for equations with linear coefficients — that is, equations of the form
(13)	
1a1x + b1  y + c12 dx + 1a2 x + b2   y + c22 dy = 0 ,

Section 2.6    Substitutions and Transformations          75
where the ai’s, bi’s, and ci’s are constants. We leave it as an exercise to show that when 
a1b2 = a2b1, equation (13) can be put in the form dy>dx = G1ax + by2, which we solved via 
the substitution z = ax + by. Moreover, if b1 = a2, then (13) is exact and can be solved using 
the method of Section 2.4.
Before considering the general case when b1 ≠a2 and a1b2 ≠a2b1, let’s first look at the 
special situation when c1 = c2 = 0. Equation (13) then becomes
1a1x + b1y2 dx + 1a2x + b2y2 dy = 0 ,
which can be rewritten in the form
dy
dx = - a1x + b1y
a2x + b2y = - 
a1 + b11y>x2
a2 + b21y>x2 .
This equation is homogeneous, so we can solve it using the method discussed earlier in this 
section.
The above discussion suggests the following procedure for solving (13). If b1 ≠a2 and 
a1b2 ≠a2b1, then we seek a translation of axes of the form
x = u + h    and    y = Y + k ,
where h and k are constants, that will change a1x + b1y + c1 into a1u + b1v and change 
a2x + b2y + c2 into a2u + b2v. Some elementary algebra shows that such a transformation 
exists if the system of equations
(14)	
a1h + b1k + c1 = 0 ,
a2h + b2k + c2 = 0
has a solution. This is ensured by the assumption a1b2 ≠a2b1, which is geometrically equiva-
lent to assuming that the two lines described by the system (14) intersect. Now if 1h, k2 
satisfies (14), then the substitutions x = u + h and y = v + k transform equation (13) into the 
homogeneous equation
(15)	
dv
du = - a1u + b1v
a2u + b2v = - 
a1 + b11v>u2
a2 + b21v>u2 ,
which we know how to solve.
Example 4
Solve
(16)	
12x - 2y - 62dx + 1x - 3y - 52dy = 0 .
Solution
Since b1 = -2 ≠1 = a2 and a1b2 = 1221-32 ≠1121-22 = a2b1, we will use the trans-
lation of axes x = u + h, y = v + k, where h and k satisfy the system
2h - 2k = 6
 h - 3k = 5 .
Solving this system gives h = 2, k = -1. Next we substitute x = u + 2, y = v - 1 into (16), 
observing that dx = du and dy = dv, and we get
12u - 2v2du + 1u - 3v2dv = 0
dv
du =
21v>u2 - 2
1 - 31v>u2 .

Chapter 2 Summary
In this chapter we have discussed various types of first-order differential equations. The most 
important were the separable, linear, and exact equations. Their principal features and method 
of solution are outlined below.
Separable Equations: dy,dx = g1x2 p1y2.  Separate the variables and integrate.
Linear Equations: dy,dx + P1x2y = Q1x2.  The integrating factor m = exp3 1P1x2 dx4 
reduces the equation to d1my2>dx = mQ, so that my = 1mQ dx + C.
Exact Equations: dF1x, y2 = 0.  Solutions are given implicitly by F1x, y2 = C. If  
0M>0y = 0N>0x, then M dx + N dy = 0 is exact and F is given by
F =
L
M dx + g1y2 ,  where  g′1y2 = N - 0
0y 
L
M dx
or
F =
L
N dy + h1x2 ,  where  h′1x2 = M - 0
0x 
L
N dy .
When an equation is not separable, linear, or exact, it may be possible to find an integrat-
ing factor or perform a substitution that will enable us to solve the equation.
Special Integrating Factors:  MM  dx + MN  dy = 0 is exact. If 10M>0y - 0N>0x2>N 
depends only on x, then
m1x2 = expc
L
a
0M>0y - 0N>0x
N
bdxd
is an integrating factor. If 10N>0x - 0M>0y2>M depends only on y, then
m1y2 = expc
L
a
0N>0x - 0M>0y
M
bdyd
is an integrating factor.
Homogeneous Equations: dy,dx = G1  y,x2.  Let v = y>x. Then dy>dx = v + x1dv>dx2, 
and the transformed equation in the variables v and x is separable.
Equations of the Form: dy,dx = G1ax + by2.  Let z = ax + by. Then dz>dx =
a + b1dy>dx2, and the transformed equation in the variables z and x is separable.
Bernoulli Equations:  dy,dx + P1x2y = Q1x2yn. For n ≠0 or 1, let v = y1-n. Then 
dv>dx = 11 - n2y-n1dy>dx2, and the transformed equation in the variables v and x is linear.
Linear Coefficients: 1a1x + b1y + c12  dx + 1a2x + b2y + c22  dy = 0.  For a1b2 ≠a2b1, let 
x = u + h and y = v + k, where h and k satisfy
 a1h + b1k + c1 = 0 ,
 a2h + b2k + c2 = 0 .
Then the transformed equation in the variables u and v is homogeneous.

In 1973 an oil barge collided with a bridge in the Mississippi River, leaking oil into the water 
at a rate estimated at 50 gallons per minute. In 1989 the Exxon Valdez spilled an estimated 
11,000,000 gallons of oil into Prudhoe Bay in 6 hours†, and in 2010 the Deepwater Horizon well 
leaked into the Gulf of Mexico at a rate estimated to be 15,000 barrels per day‡ (1 barrel = 42 
gallons). In this project you are going to use differential equations to analyze a simplified model 
of the dissipation of heavy crude oil spilled at a rate of S ft3>sec into a flowing body of water. 
The flow region is a canal, namely a straight channel of rectangular cross section, w feet wide by 
d feet deep, having a constant flow rate of v ft>sec; the oil is presumed to float in a thin layer of 
thickness s (feet) on top of the water, without mixing.
In Figure 2.12, the oil that passes through the cross-section window in a short time ∆t occu-
pies a box of dimensions s by w by v∆t. To make the analysis easier, presume that the canal is 
conceptually partitioned into cells of length L ft. each, and that within each particular cell the oil 
instantaneously disperses and forms a uniform layer of thickness si1t2 in cell i (cell 1 starts at the 
point of the spill). So, at time t, the ith cell contains si1t2wL ft3 of oil. Oil flows out of cell i at a 
rate equal to si1t2wv ft3>sec, and it flows into cell i at the rate si-11t2wv; it flows into the first cell 
at S ft3>sec.

(a)	 Formulate a system of differential equations and initial conditions for the oil thickness 
in the first three cells. Take S = 50 gallons/min, which was roughly the spillage rate for 
the Mississippi River incident, and take w = 200 ft, d = 25 ft, and v = 1 mi/h (which 
are reasonable estimates for the Mississippi River†). Take L = 1000 ft.
(b)	 Solve for s11t2. [Caution: Make sure your units are consistent.]
(c)	 If the spillage lasts for T seconds, what is the maximum oil layer thickness in cell 1?
(d)	 Solve for s21t2. What is the maximum oil layer thickness in cell 2?
(e)	 Probably the least tenable simplification in this analysis lies in regarding the layer thick-
ness as uniform over distances of length L. Reevaluate your answer to part (c) with L 
reduced to 500 ft. By what fraction does the answer change?

In medicine, mechanical ventilation is a procedure that assists or replaces spontaneous breathing 
for critically ill patients, using a medical device called a ventilator. Some people attribute the first 
mechanical ventilation to Andreas Vesalius in 1555. Negative pressure ventilators (iron lungs) 
came into use in the 1940s–1950s in response to poliomyelitis (polio) epidemics. Philip Drinker 
and Louis Shaw are credited with its invention. Modern ventilators use positive pressure to inflate 
the lungs of the patient. In the ICU (intensive care unit), common indications for the initiation 
of mechanical ventilation are acute respiratory failure, acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease, coma, and neuromuscular disorders. The goals of mechanical ventilation are 
to provide oxygen to the lungs and to remove carbon dioxide.
In this project, we model the mechanical process performed by the ventilator. We make the 
following assumptions about this process of filling the lungs with air and then letting them deflate 
to some rest volume (see Figure 2.13).
	 (i)	 The length (in seconds) of each breath is fixed (ttot) and is set by the clinician, with 
each breath being identical to the previous breath.
	 (ii)	 Each breath is divided into two parts: inspiration (air flowing into the patient) and 
expiration (air flowing out of the patient). We assume that inspiration takes place over 
the interval [0, ti] and expiration over the time interval [ti, ttot]. The time ti is called 
the inspiratory time.

Chapter 2    First-Order Differential Equations
	 (iii)	 During inspiration the ventilator applies a constant pressure Papp to the patient’s 
airway, and during expiration this pressure is zero, relative to atmospheric pressure. 
This is called pressure-controlled ventilation.
	 (iv)	 We assume that the pulmonary system (lung) is modeled by a single compartment. 
Hence, the action of the ventilator is similar to inflating a balloon and then releasing 
the pressure.
	 (v)	 At the airway there is a pressure balance:
(1)	
Pr + Pe + Pex = Paw ,
	
	 where Pr denotes pressure losses due to resistance to flow into and out of the lung, Pe 
is the elastic pressure due to changes in volume of the lung, Pex is a residual pressure 
that remains in the lung at the completion of a breath, and Paw denotes the pressure 
applied to the airway. (Paw = Papp during inspiration and Paw = 0 during expiration.) 
The residual pressure Pex is called the end-expiratory pressure.
	 (vi)	 Let V1t2 denote the volume of the lung at time t, with Vi 1t2, 0 … t … ti , denoting its 
volume during inspiration and Ve 1t2, ti … t … ttot , its volume during expiration.  
We assume that Vi 102 = Ve 1ttot2 = 0. The number Vi 1ti2 = VT is called the tidal 
volume of the breath.
	(vii)	 We assume that the resistive pressure Pr is proportional to the flows into and out of 
the lung such that Pr = R1dV/dt 2, and we assume that the proportionality constant R 
is the same for inspiration and expiration.
	(viii)	 Furthermore, we assume that the elastic pressure is proportional to the instantaneous 
volume of the lung. That is, Pe = 11/C2V, where the constant C is called the compliance 
of the lung.
Using the pressure equation in (1) together with the above assumptions, a mathematical 
model for the instantaneous volume in the single compartment lung is given by the following pair 
of first-order linear differential equations:
(2)	
RadVi
dt b + a 1
C bVi + Pex = Papp ,  0 … t … ti ,
(3)	
RadVe
dt b + a 1
C bVe + Pex = 0 ,  ti … t … ttot .
The initial conditions, as indicated in assumption (vi), are Vi 102 = 0 and Ve 1ti2 = Vi 1ti2 = VT. 
The constant Pex is not known a priori but is determined from the end condition on the expiratory 
volume: Ve 1ttot2 = 0. This will make each breath identical to the previous breath. To obtain a 
formula for Pex, complete the following steps.
(a)	 Solve equation (2) for Vi 1t2 with the initial condition Vi 102 = 0.
(b)	 Solve equation (3) for Ve 1t2 with the initial condition Ve 1ti2 = VT.
(c)	 Using the fact that Vi 1ti2 = VT, show that
Pex =
1eti /RC - 12 Papp
ettot /RC - 1
 .
(d)	 For R = 10 cm 1H2O2>L>sec, C = 0.02 L>cm 1H2O2, Papp = 20 cm 1H2O2,  
ti = 1 sec and ttot = 3 sec, plot the graphs of Vi1t2 and Ve1t2 over the interval 30, ttot4. 
Compute Pex for these parameters.

How long does it take for water to drain through a hole in the bottom of a tank? Consider the tank 
pictured in Figure 2.14, which drains through a small, round hole. Torricelli’s law† states that 
when the surface of the water is at a height h, the water drains with the velocity it would have if it 
fell freely from a height h (ignoring various forms of friction).
(a)	 Show that the standard gravity differential equation
d2h
dt2 = -g
leads to the conclusion that an object that falls from a height h102 will land with a 
velocity of - 22gh102.
(b)	 Let A1h2 be the cross-sectional area of the water in the tank at height h and a the area 
of the drain hole. The rate at which water is flowing out of the tank at time t can be 
expressed as the cross-sectional area at height h times the rate at which the height of 
the water is changing. Alternatively, the rate at which water flows out of the hole can be 
expressed as the area of the hole times the velocity of the draining water. Set these two 
equal to each other and insert Torricelli’s law to derive the differential equation
(4)	
A1h2 dh
dt = -a22gh .
(c)	 The conical tank of Figure 2.14 has a radius of 30 cm when it is filled to an initial depth 
of 50 cm. A small round hole at the bottom has a diameter of 1 cm. Determine A1h2 
and a and then solve the differential equation in (4), thus deriving a formula relating 
time and the height of the water in this tank.

(d)	 Use your solution to (c) to predict how long it will take for the tank to drain entirely.
(e)	 Which would drain faster, the tank pictured or an upside-down conical tank of the same 
dimensions draining through a hole of the same size (1-cm diameter)? How long would 
it take to drain the upside-down tank?
(f )	 Find a water tank and time how long it takes to drain. (You may be able to borrow a 
“separatory funnel” from your chemistry department or use a large water cooler.) The 
tank should be large enough to take several minutes to drain, and the drain hole should 
be large enough to allow water to flow freely. The top of the tank should be open (so 
that the water will not “glug”). Repeat steps (c) and (d) for your tank and compare the 
prediction of Torricelli’s law to your experimental results.
To apply the techniques discussed in this chapter to real-world problems, it is necessary to trans-
late these problems into questions that can be answered mathematically. The process of refor-
mulating a real-world problem as a mathematical one often requires making certain simplifying 
assumptions. To illustrate this, consider the following snowplow problem:
One morning it began to snow very hard and continued snowing steadily throughout 
the day. A snowplow set out at 9:00 a.m. to clear a road, clearing 2 mi by 11:00 a.m. 
and an additional mile by 1:00 p.m. At what time did it start snowing?
To solve this problem, you can make two physical assumptions concerning the rate at which 
it is snowing and the rate at which the snowplow can clear the road. Because it is snowing 
steadily, it is reasonable to assume it is snowing at a constant rate. From the data given (and from 
our experience), the deeper the snow, the slower the snowplow moves. With this in mind, assume 
that the rate (in mph) at which a snowplow can clear a road is inversely proportional to the depth 
of the snow.
D 	 The Snowplow Problem
Courtesy of Alar Toomre, Massachusetts Institute of Technology
One day it began to snow exactly at noon at a heavy and steady rate. A snowplow left its garage at 
1:00 p.m., and another one followed in its tracks at 2:00 p.m. (see Figure 2.15 on page 85).
(a)	 At what time did the second snowplow crash into the first? To answer this question, 
assume as in Project D that the rate (in mph) at which a snowplow can clear the road 
is inversely proportional to the depth of the snow (and hence to the time elapsed since 
the road was clear of snow). [Hint: Begin by writing differential equations for x1t2 and 
y1t2, the distances traveled by the first and second snowplows, respectively, at t hours 
past noon. To solve the differential equation involving y, let t rather than y be the dependent 
variable!]
(b)	 Could the crash have been avoided by dispatching the second snowplow at 3:00 p.m. 
instead?

An equation of the form
(5)	
y = x dy
dx + ƒ1dy,dx2 ,
where the continuously differentiable function ƒ1t2 is evaluated at t = dy>dx, is called a Clairaut 
equation.† Interest in these equations is due to the fact that (5) has a one-parameter family of solu-
tions that consist of straight lines. Further, the envelope of this family—that is, the curve whose 
tangent lines are given by the family—is also a solution to (5) and is called the singular solution.
To solve a Clairaut equation:
(a)	 Differentiate equation (5) with respect to x and simplify to show that
(6)	
3x + ƒ′1dy>dx24 d2y
dx2 = 0 ,    where    ƒ′1t2 = d
dt
 ƒ1t2 .
(b)	 From (6), conclude that dy>dx = c or ƒ′1dy>dx2 = -x. Assume that dy>dx = c and 
substitute back into (5) to obtain the family of straight-line solutions
y = cx + ƒ1c2 .
(c)	 Show that another solution to (5) is given parametrically by
 x = -ƒ′1p2 ,
 y = ƒ1p2 - pƒ′1p2 ,
where the parameter p = dy>dx. This solution is the singular solution.
(d)	 Use the above method to find the family of straight-line solutions and the singular solution 
to the equation

Here ƒ1t2 = 2t2. Sketch several of the straight-line solutions along with the singular 
solution on the same coordinate system. Observe that the straight-line solutions are all

The initial value problem (IVP),
(7)	
dy
dx = 3y2/3 ,    y122 = 0 ,
which was discussed in Example 9 and Problem 29 of Section 1.2, is an example of an IVP that has 
more than one solution. The goal of this project is to find all the solutions to (7) on 1- ∞, + ∞2. 
It turns out that there are infinitely many! These solutions can be obtained by concatenating the 
three functions 1x - a23 for x 6 a, the constant 0 for a … x … b, and 1x - b23 for x 7 b, where 
a … 2 … b, as can be seen by completing the following steps:
(a)	 Show that if y = ƒ1x2 is a solution to the differential equation dy>dx = 3y 2>3 that 
is not zero on an open interval I, then on this interval ƒ1x2 must be of the form 
ƒ1x2 = 1x - c23 for some constant c not in I.
(b)	 Prove that if y = ƒ1x2 is a solution to the differential equation dy>dx = 3y 2>3 on  
1- ∞, + ∞2 and ƒ1a2 = ƒ1b2 = 0, where a 6 b, then ƒ1x2 = 0 for a … x … b. 
[Hint: Consider the sign of ƒ′.]
(c)	 Now let y = g1x2 be a solution to the IVP (7) on 1- ∞, + ∞2. Of course g122 = 0. 
If g vanishes at some point x 7 2, then let b be the largest of such points; otherwise, set 
b = 2. Similarly, if g vanishes at some point x 6 2, then let a be the smallest (furthest 
to the left) of such points; otherwise, set a = 2. Here we allow b = + ∞ and a = - ∞. 
(Because g is a continuous function, it can be proved that there always exist such largest 
and smallest points.) Using the results of parts (a) and (b) prove that if both a and b are 
finite, then g has the following form:
g1x2 = •
1x - a23
if x … a
0
if a 6 x … b 
1x - b23

Would you rather have $5 with certainty or a gamble involving a 50% chance of receiving $1 and 
a 50% chance of receiving $11? The gamble has a higher expected value ($6); however, it also 
has a greater level of risk. Economists model the behavior of consumers or other agents facing

risky decisions with the help of a (von Neumann–Morgenstern) utility function u and the criterion 
of expected utility.
Rather than using expected values of the dollar payoffs, the payoffs are first transformed  
into utility levels and then weighted by probabilities to obtain expected utility. Following the 
suggestion of Daniel Bernoulli, we might set u1x2 = ln x and then compare ln 5 ≈0.8047 to  
[0.5 ln 1 + 0.5 ln 11] ≈0.1969, which would result in the sure thing being chosen in this case 
rather than the gamble. This utility function is strictly concave, which corresponds to the agent 
being risk averse, or wanting to avoid gambles (unless of course the extra risk is sufficiently com-
pensated by a high enough increase in the mean or expected payoff).
Alternatively, the utility function might be u1x2 = x2, which is strictly convex and corre-
sponds to the agent being risk loving. This agent would surely select the above gamble. The case 
of u1x2 = x occurs when the agent is risk neutral and would select according to the expected 
value of the payoff. It is normally assumed that u′1x2 7 0 at all payoff levels, x; in other words, 
higher payoffs are desirable.
In addition to knowing if an agent is risk averse or risk loving, economists are often inter-
ested in knowing how risk averse (or risk loving) an agent is. Clearly this has something to do 
with the second derivative of the utility function. The measure of relative risk aversion of an 
agent with utility function u1x2 and payoff x is defined as r 1x2 = -u″1x2x>u′1x2. Normally, 
r 1x2 is a function of the payoff level. However, economists often find it convenient to restrict 
consideration to utility functions for which r 1x2 is constant, say, r 1x2 = s for all x. It is easily 
shown that each of u1x2 = ln x, u1x2 = x2, and u1x2 = x exhibits constant relative risk aver-
sion (with levels s = 1, s = -1, and s = 0, respectively). A question naturally arises: What is 
the set of all utility functions that have constant relative risk aversion?
(a)	 State the second-order differential equation defined by the above question.
(b)	 Convert this into a separable first-order differential equation for u′1x2, solve, and use 
the solution to determine the possible forms that u′1x2 can take.
(c)	 Integrate to obtain the set of all constant relative risk-aversion utility functions. This 
class is used extensively throughout economics.
(d)	 An alternative measure of risk aversion is a1x2 = u″1x2>u′1x2, the measure of  
absolute risk aversion. Find the set of all utility functions exhibiting constant absolute 
risk aversion.

utility functions?

You want to design a solar collector that will concentrate the Sun’s rays at a point. By symmetry 
this surface will have a shape that is a surface of revolution obtained by revolving a curve about 
an axis. Without loss of generality, you can assume that this axis is the x-axis and the rays paral-
lel to this axis are focused at the origin (see Figure 2.16). To derive the equation for the curve, 
proceed as follows:

Mathematical Models and 
Numerical Methods Involving 
First-Order Equations
3.1  Mathematical Modeling
Adopting the Babylonian practices of careful measurement and detailed observations, the 
ancient Greeks sought to comprehend nature by logical analysis. Aristotle’s convincing argu-
ments that the world was not flat, but spherical, led the intellectuals of that day to ponder the 
question: What is the circumference of Earth? And it was astonishing that Eratosthenes man-
aged to obtain a fairly accurate answer to this problem without having to set foot beyond the 
ancient city of Alexandria. His method involved certain assumptions and simplifications: Earth 
is a perfect sphere, the sun’s rays travel parallel paths, the city of Syene was 5000 stadia due 
south of Alexandria, and so on. With these idealizations Eratosthenes created a mathematical 
context in which the principles of geometry could be applied.†
Today, as scientists seek to further our understanding of nature and as engineers seek, on a 
more pragmatic level, to find answers to technical problems, the technique of representing our 
“real world” in mathematical terms has become an invaluable tool. This process of mimicking 
reality by using the language of mathematics is known as mathematical modeling.
Formulating problems in mathematical terms has several benefits. First, it requires that we 
clearly state our premises. Real-world problems are often complex, involving several differ-
ent and possibly interrelated processes. Before mathematical treatment can proceed, one must 
determine which variables are significant and which can be ignored. Often, for the relevant 
variables, relationships are postulated in the form of laws, formulas, theories, and the like. 
These assumptions constitute the idealizations of the model.
Mathematics contains a wealth of theorems and techniques for making logical deductions 
and manipulating equations. Hence, it provides a context in which analysis can take place free 
of any preconceived notions of the outcome. It is also of great practical importance that math-
ematics provides a format for obtaining numerical answers via a computer.
The process of building an effective mathematical model takes skill, imagination, and 
objective evaluation. Certainly an exposure to several existing models that illustrate various 
aspects of modeling can lead to a better feel for the process. Several excellent books and arti-
cles are devoted exclusively to the subject.†† In this chapter we concentrate on examples of 
models that involve first-order differential equations. In studying these and in building your 
own models, the following broad outline of the process may be helpful.
†For further reading, see, for example, The Mapmakers, by John Noble Wilford (Vintage Books, New York, 2001), 
Chapter 2.
††See, for example, A First Course in Mathematical Modeling, 5th ed., by F. T. Giordano, W. P. Fox, S. B. Horton, 
and M. D. Weir (Cengage Learning, Independence, KY, 2014) or Concepts of Mathematical Modeling, by W. J. 
Meyer (Dover Publications, Mineola, New York, 2004).

Section 3.1    Mathematical Modeling          91
Formulate the Problem
Here you must pose the problem in such a way that it can be “answered” mathematically. This 
requires an understanding of the problem area as well as the mathematics. At this stage you 
may need to confer with experts in that area and read the relevant literature.
Develop the Model
There are two things to be done here. First, you must decide which variables are important 
and which are not. The former are then classified as independent variables or dependent vari-
ables. The unimportant variables are those that have very little or no effect on the process. (For 
example, in studying the motion of a falling body, its color is usually of little interest.) The 
independent variables are those whose effect is significant and that will serve as input for the 
model.† For the falling body, its shape, mass, initial position, initial velocity, and time from 
release are possible independent variables. The dependent variables are those that are affected 
by the independent variables and that are important to solving the problem. Again, for a falling 
body, its velocity, location, and time of impact are all possible dependent variables.
Second, you must determine or specify the relationships (for example, a differential equa-
tion) that exist among the relevant variables. This requires a good background in the area and 
insight into the problem. You may begin with a crude model and then, based upon testing, 
refine the model as needed. For example, you might begin by ignoring any friction acting on 
the falling body. Then, if it is necessary to obtain a more acceptable answer, try to take into 
account any frictional forces that may affect the motion.
Test the Model
Before attempting to “verify” a model by comparing its output with experimental data, the 
following questions should be considered:
Are the assumptions reasonable?
Are the equations dimensionally consistent? (For example, we don’t want to add 
units of force to units of velocity.)
Is the model internally consistent in the sense that equations do not contradict one 
another?
Do the relevant equations have solutions?
Are the solutions unique?
How difficult is it to obtain the solutions?
Do the solutions provide an answer for the problem being studied?
When possible, try to validate the model by comparing its predictions with any experi-
mental data. Begin with rather simple predictions that involve little computation or analysis. 
Then, as the model is refined, check to see that the accuracy of the model’s predictions is 
acceptable to you. In some cases validation is impossible or socially, politically, economi-
cally, or morally unreasonable. For example, how does one validate a model that predicts 
when our sun will die out?
†In the mathematical formulation of the model, some of the independent variables may be called parameters.

92          Chapter 3    Mathematical Models and Numerical Methods Involving First-Order Equations
Each time the model is used to predict the outcome of a process and hence solve a prob-
lem, it provides a test of the model that may lead to further refinements or simplifications. In 
many cases a model is simplified to give a quicker or less expensive answer—provided, of 
course, that sufficient accuracy is maintained.
One should always keep in mind that a model is not reality but only a representation of 
reality. The more refined models may provide an understanding of the underlying processes of 
nature. For this reason applied mathematicians strive for better, more refined models. Still, the 
real test of a model is its ability to find an acceptable answer for the posed problem.
In this chapter we discuss various models that involve differential equations. Section 3.2, 
Compartmental Analysis, studies mixing problems and population models. Sections 3.3 
through 3.5 are physics-based and examine heating and cooling, Newtonian mechanics, and 
electrical circuits. Finally Sections 3.6 and 3.7 introduce some numerical methods for solving 
first-order initial value problems. This will enable us to consider more realistic models that 
cannot be solved using the methods of Chapter 2.
Many complicated processes can be broken down into distinct stages and the entire system 
modeled by describing the interactions between the various stages. Such systems are called 
compartmental and are graphically depicted by block diagrams. In this section we study the 
basic unit of these systems, a single compartment, and analyze some simple processes that can 
be handled by such a model.
The basic one-compartment system consists of a function x1t2 that represents the amount 
of a substance in the compartment at time t, an input rate at which the substance enters the com-
partment, and an output rate at which the substance leaves the compartment (see Figure 3.1).
Because the derivative of x with respect to t can be interpreted as the rate of change in the 
amount of the substance in the compartment with respect to time, the one-compartment system 
suggests
(1)	
dx
dt = input rate −output rate
as a mathematical model for the process.
Mixing Problems
A problem for which the one-compartment system provides a useful representation is the mixing  
of fluids in a tank. Let x1t2 represent the amount of a substance in a tank (compartment) at 
time t. To use the compartmental analysis model, we must be able to determine the rates at 
which this substance enters and leaves the tank. In mixing problems one is often given the rate 
at which a fluid containing the substance flows into the tank, along with the concentration of 
the substance in that fluid. Hence, multiplying the flow rate (volume/time) by the concentration 
(amount/volume) yields the input rate (amount/time).

Section 3.2    Compartmental Analysis          93
The output rate of the substance is usually more difficult to determine. If we are given the 
exit rate of the mixture of fluids in the tank, then how do we determine the concentration of the 
substance in the mixture? One simplifying assumption that we might make is that the concen-
tration is kept uniform in the mixture. Then we can compute the concentration of the substance 
in the mixture by dividing the amount x1t2 by the volume of the mixture in the tank at time t. 
Multiplying this concentration by the exit rate of the mixture then gives the desired output rate 
of the substance. This model is used in Examples 1 and 2.
Example 1
Consider a large tank holding 1000 L of pure water into which a brine solution of salt begins 
to flow at a constant rate of 6 L/min. The solution inside the tank is kept well stirred and is 
flowing out of the tank at a rate of 6 L/min. If the concentration of salt in the brine entering the 
tank is 0.1 kg/L, determine when the concentration of salt in the tank will reach 0.05 kg/L (see 
Figure 3.2).

Solution
We can view the tank as a compartment containing salt. If we let x1t2 denote the mass of salt 
in the tank at time t, we can determine the concentration of salt in the tank by dividing x1t2 
by the volume of fluid in the tank at time t. We use the mathematical model described by 
equation (1) to solve for x1t2.
First we must determine the rate at which salt enters the tank. We are given that brine 
flows into the tank at a rate of 6 L/min. Since the concentration is 0.1 kg/L, we conclude that 
the input rate of salt into the tank is
(2)	
16 L/min210.1 kg/L2 = 0.6 kg/min .
We must now determine the output rate of salt from the tank. The brine solution in the tank 
is kept well stirred, so let’s assume that the concentration of salt in the tank is uniform. That is, 
the concentration of salt in any part of the tank at time t is just x1t2 divided by the volume of 
fluid in the tank. Because the tank initially contains 1000 L and the rate of flow into the tank 
is the same as the rate of flow out, the volume is a constant 1000 L. Hence, the output rate of 
salt is
(3)	
16 L/min2 c
x1t2
1000 kg/Ld = 3x1t2

The tank initially contained pure water, so we set x102 = 0. Substituting the rates in (2) 
and (3) into equation (1) then gives the initial value problem
(4)

500 ,        x102 = 0 ,
as a mathematical model for the mixing problem.

94          Chapter 3    Mathematical Models and Numerical Methods Involving First-Order Equations
The equation in (4) is separable (and linear) and easy to solve. Using the initial condition 
x102 = 0 to evaluate the arbitrary constant, we obtain
(5)	
x1t2 = 10011 - e-3t>5002 .
Thus, the concentration of salt in the tank at time t is
x1t2
1000 = 0.111 - e-3t>5002 kg/L .
To determine when the concentration of salt is 0.05 kg/L, we set the right-hand side equal to 
0.05 and solve for t. This gives
0.111 - e-3t>5002 = 0.05 or e-3t>500 = 0.5 ,
and hence
t = 500 ln 2
3
 ≈ 115.52 min .
Consequently the concentration of salt in the tank will be 0.05 kg/L after 115.52 min.  ◆
From equation (5), we observe that the mass of salt in the tank steadily increases and has 
the limiting value
lim
tS ∞ x1t2 = lim
tS ∞10011 - e-3t>5002 = 100 kg .
Thus, the limiting concentration of salt in the tank is 0.1 kg/L, which is the same as the con-
centration of salt in the brine flowing into the tank. This certainly agrees with our expectations!
It might be interesting to see what would happen to the concentration if the flow rate into 
the tank is greater than the flow rate out.
Example 2
For the mixing problem described in Example 1, assume now that the brine leaves the tank at a 
rate of 5 L/min instead of 6 L/min, with all else being the same (see Figure 3.3). Determine the 
concentration of salt in the tank as a function of time.

Solution
The difference between the rate of flow into the tank and the rate of flow out is 6 - 5 =  
1 L/min, so the volume of fluid in the tank after t minutes is 11000 + t2 L. Hence, the rate at 
which salt leaves the tank is

as a mathematical model for the mixing problem.
The differential equation in (6) is linear, so we can use the procedure outlined on page 50 
to solve for x1t2. The integrating factor is m1t2 = 11000 + t25. Thus,
 d
dt
 3 11000 + t25x4 = 0.611000 + t25
 11000 + t25x = 0.111000 + t26 + c
 x1t2 = 0.111000 + t2 + c11000 + t2-5 .
Using the initial condition x102 = 0, we find c = -0.11100026, and thus the solution to (6) is
x1t2 = 0.13 11000 + t2 - 110002611000 + t2-54 .
Hence, the concentration of salt in the tank at time t is
(7)	
x1t2
1000 + t = 0.131 - 110002611000 + t2-64 kg/L .  ◆
As in Example 1, the concentration given by (7) approaches 0.1 kg/L as t S ∞. However, 
in Example 2 the volume of fluid in the tank becomes unbounded, and when the tank begins to 
overflow, the model in (6) is no longer appropriate.
Population Models
How does one predict the growth of a population? If we are interested in a single population, 
we can think of the species as being contained in a compartment (a petri dish, an island, a 
country, etc.) and study the growth process as a one-compartment system.
Let p1t2 be the population at time t. While the population is always an integer, it is usu-
ally large enough so that very little error is introduced in assuming that p1t2 is a continuous 
function. We now need to determine the growth (input) rate and the death (output) rate for the 
population.
Let’s consider a population of bacteria that reproduce by simple cell division. In our 
model, we assume that the growth rate is proportional to the population present. This assump-
tion is consistent with observations of bacterial growth. As long as there are sufficient space and 
ample food supply for the bacteria, we can also assume that the death rate is zero. (Remember 
that in cell division, the parent cell does not die, but becomes two new cells.) Hence, a math-
ematical model for a population of bacteria is
(8)	
dp
dt = k1p ,        p102 = p0 ,
where k1 7 0 is the proportionality constant for the growth rate and p0 is the population at time 
t = 0. For human populations the assumption that the death rate is zero is certainly wrong! 
However, if we assume that people die only of natural causes, we might expect the death rate 
also to be proportional to the size of the population. That is, we revise (8) to read
(9)	
dp
dt = k1p - k2p = 1k1 - k22p = kp ,

96          Chapter 3    Mathematical Models and Numerical Methods Involving First-Order Equations
where k J k1 - k2 and k2 is the proportionality constant for the death rate. Let’s assume that  
k1 7 k2 so that k 7 0. This gives the mathematical model
(10)	
dp
dt = kp ,        p102 = p0 ,
which is called the Malthusian,† or exponential, law of population growth. This equation is 
separable, and solving the initial value problem for p1t2 gives
(11)	
p1t2 = p0ekt .
To test the Malthusian model, let’s apply it to the demographic history of the United States.
Example 3
In 1790 the population of the United States was 3.93 million, and in 1890 it was 62.98 million. 
Using the Malthusian model, estimate the U.S. population as a function of time.
Solution
If we set t = 0 to be the year 1790, then by formula (11) we have
(12)	
p1t2 = 13.932ekt ,
where p1t2 is the population in millions. One way to obtain a value for k would be to make the 
model fit the data for some specific year, such as 1890 (t = 100 years).†† We have
p11002 = 62.98 = 13.932e100k .
Solving for k yields
k = ln162.982 - ln13.932
100
 ≈ 0.027742 .
Substituting this value in equation (12), we find
(13)	
p1t2 = 13.932e10.0277422t .  ◆
In Table 3.1 on page 97 we list the U.S. population as given by the U.S. Bureau of the  
Census and the population predicted by the Malthusian model using equation (13). From Table 3.1 
we see that the predictions based on the Malthusian model are in reasonable agreement with 
the census data until about 1900. After 1900 the predicted population is too large, and the Mal-
thusian model is unacceptable.
We remark that a Malthusian model can be generated using the census data for any two 
different years. We selected 1790 and 1890 for purposes of comparison with the logistic model 
that we now describe.
The Malthusian model considered only death by natural causes. What about prema-
ture deaths due to malnutrition, inadequate medical supplies, communicable diseases,  
violent crimes, etc.? These factors involve a competition within the population, so we might 
†Historical Footnote: Thomas R. Malthus (1766 –1834) was a British economist who studied population models.
††The choice of the year 1890 is purely arbitrary, of course; a more democratic (and better) way of extracting parameters 
from data is described after Example 4.

Section 3.2    Compartmental Analysis          97
assume that another component of the death rate is proportional to the number of two-party 
interactions. There are p1p - 12>2 such possible interactions for a population of size p. 
Thus, if we combine the birth rate (8) with the death rate and rearrange constants, we get

If p1t2 = p0 at t = 0, and c3 = 1 - p1>p0, then solving for p1t2, we find

p1t2 =

p0 + 1p1 −p02e−Ap1 t .
The function p1t2 given in (15) is called the logistic function, and graphs of logistic curves 
are displayed in Figure 3.4.† Note that for A 7 0 and p0 7 0, the limit population as t S ∞, 
is p1.

Taking the 1790 population of 3.93 million as the initial population and given the 1840 and 
1890 populations of 17.07 and 62.98 million, respectively, use the logistic model to estimate 
the population at time t.
Solution
With t = 0 corresponding to the year 1790, we know that p0 = 3.93. We must now deter-
mine the parameters A, p1 in equation (15). For this purpose, we use the given facts that 
p1502 = 17.07  and p11002 = 62.98; that is,
(16)	
17.07 =
3.93 p1
3.93 + 1p1 - 3.932e-50Ap1 ,
(17)	
62.98 =
3.93 p1
3.93 + 1p1 - 3.932e-100Ap1 .
Equations (16) and (17) are two nonlinear equations in the two unknowns A, p1. To solve such 
a system, we would usually resort to a numerical approximation scheme such as Newton’s 
method. However, for the case at hand, it is possible to find the solutions directly because 
the data are given at times ta and tb with tb = 2ta (see Problem 12). Carrying out the algebra 
described in Problem 12, we ultimately find that
(18)	
p1 ≈251.7812 and A ≈0.0001210 .
Thus, the logistic model for the given data is
(19)	
p1t2 =
989.50
3.93 + 1247.852e-10.0304632 t .  ◆
†Historical Footnote: The logistic model for population growth was first developed by P. F. Verhulst around 1840.

Section 3.2    Compartmental Analysis          99
The population data predicted by (19) are displayed in column 4 of Table 3.1 on page 97.  
As you can see, these predictions are in better agreement with the census data than the 
­Malthusian model is. And, of course, the agreement is perfect in the years 1790, 1840, and 
1890. However, the choice of these particular years for estimating the parameters p0, A, and p1 
is quite arbitrary, and we would expect that a more robust model would use all of the data, in 
some way, for the estimation. One way to implement this idea is the following.
Observe from equation (14) that the logistic model predicts a linear relationship between 
1dp>dt2>p and p:
1
p dp
dt = Ap1 - Ap ,
with Ap1 as the intercept and -A as the slope. In column five of Table 3.1, we list values of 
1dp>dt2>p, which are estimated from centered differences according to
(20)

p1t2 dp
dt
 1t2 ≈

p1t2 p1t + 102 - p1t - 102
20
(see Problem 16). In Figure 3.5 these estimated values of 1dp>dt2>p are plotted against p in 
what is called a scatter diagram. The linear relationship predicted by the logistic model sug-
gests that we approximate the plot by a straight line. A standard technique for doing this is the 
so-called least-squares linear fit, which is discussed in Appendix E. This yields the straight line

p dp
dt ≈0.0280960 - 0.00008231 p ,
which is also depicted in Figure 3.5. Now with A = 0.00008231 and p1 = 10.0280960>A2 
≈ 341.4, we can solve equation (15) for p0:

By averaging the right-hand side of (21) over all the data, we obtain the estimate p0 ≈4.107. 
Finally, the insertion of these estimates for the parameters in equation (15) leads to the predic-
tions listed in column six of Table 3.1.
Note that this model yields p1 ≈341.4 million as the limit on the future population of the 
United States.

8 L/min into a large tank that initially held 100 L of brine 
solution in which was dissolved 0.5 kg of salt. The solu-
tion inside the tank is kept well stirred and flows out of 
the tank at the same rate. If the concentration of salt in 
the brine entering the tank is 0.05 kg/L, determine the 
mass of salt in the tank after t min. When will the con-
centration of salt in the tank reach 0.02 kg/L?
2.	 A brine solution of salt flows at a constant rate of 6 L/min 
into a large tank that initially held 50 L of brine solution 
in which was dissolved 0.5 kg of salt. The solution inside

the solution entering the tank is 20% nitric acid, determine 
the volume of nitric acid in the tank after t min. When will 
the percentage of nitric acid in the tank reach 10%?
4.	 A brine solution of salt flows at a constant rate of 4 L/min 
into a large tank that initially held 100 L of pure water. 
The solution inside the tank is kept well stirred and flows 
out of the tank at a rate of 3 L/min. If the concentration 
of salt in the brine entering the tank is 0.2 kg/L, deter-
mine the mass of salt in the tank after t min. When will 
the concentration of salt in the tank reach 0.1 kg/L?
5.	 A swimming pool whose volume is 10,000 gal contains 
water that is 0.01% chlorine. Starting at t = 0, city water 
containing 0.001% chlorine is pumped into the pool at a 
rate of 5 gal/min. The pool water flows out at the same 
rate. What is the percentage of chlorine in the pool after 
1 h? When will the pool water be 0.002% chlorine?
6.	 The air in a small room 12 ft by 8 ft by 8 ft is 3% car-
bon monoxide. Starting at t = 0, fresh air containing  
no carbon monoxide is blown into the room at a rate of 
100 ft3/min. If air in the room flows out through a vent 
at the same rate, when will the air in the room be 0.01% 
carbon monoxide?
7.	 Beginning at time t = 0, fresh water is pumped at the 
rate of 3 gal/min into a 60-gal tank initially filled with 
brine. The resulting less-and-less salty mixture overflows 
at the same rate into a second 60-gal tank that initially 
contained only pure water, and from there it eventually 
spills onto the ground. Assuming perfect mixing in both 
tanks, when will the water in the second tank taste saltiest? 
And exactly how salty will it then be, compared with the 
original brine?
8.	 A tank initially contains s0 lb of salt dissolved in 200 gal 
of water, where s0 is some positive number. Starting 
at time t = 0, water containing 0.5 lb of salt per gallon 
enters the tank at a rate of 4 gal/min, and the well-stirred 
solution leaves the tank at the same rate. Letting c (t) 
be the concentration of salt in the tank at time t, show 
that the limiting concentration—that is, limtS ∞ c(t)—is 
0.5 lb/gal.
9.	 In 1990 the Department of Natural Resources released

Using the Malthusian law for population growth, estimate 
the population of splake in the lake in the year 2020.

In Problems 23–27, assume that the rate of decay of a

25.	 Carbon dating is often used to determine the age of a fos-
sil. For example, a humanoid skull was found in a cave 
in South Africa along with the remains of a campfire. 
Archaeologists believe the age of the skull to be the same 
age as the campfire. It is determined that only 2% of the 
original amount of carbon-14 remains in the burnt wood 
of the campfire. Estimate the age of the skull if the half-
life of carbon-14 is about 5600 years.

27.	 The only undiscovered isotopes of the two unknown ele-
ments hohum and inertium (symbols Hh and It) are radio-
active. Hohum decays into inertium with a decay constant 
of 2/yr, and inertium decays into the nonradioactive iso-
tope of bunkum (symbol Bu) with a decay constant of  
1/yr. An initial mass of 1 kg of hohum is put into a non-
radiaoctive container, with no other source of hohum, 
inertium, or bunkum. How much of each of the three ele-
ments is in the container after t yr? (The decay constant 
is the constant of proportionality in the statement that the 
rate of loss of mass of the element at any time is propor-
tional to the mass of the element at that time.)
Our goal is to formulate a mathematical model that describes the 24-hr temperature profile 
inside a building as a function of the outside temperature, the heat generated inside the build-
ing, and the furnace heating or air conditioner cooling. From this model we would like to 
answer the following three questions:
	
(a)	 How long does it take to change the building temperature substantially?
	
(b)	 How does the building temperature vary during spring and fall when there is no  
furnace heating or air conditioning?
	
(c)	 How does the building temperature vary in summer when there is air conditioning or 
in the winter when there is furnace heating?
A natural approach to modeling the temperature inside a building is to use compartmental 
analysis. Let T1t2 represent the temperature inside the building at time t and view the building 
as a single compartment. Then the rate of change in the temperature is determined by all the 
factors that generate or dissipate heat.
We will consider three main factors that affect the temperature inside the building. First 
is the heat produced by people, lights, and machines inside the building. This causes a rate of 
increase in temperature that we will denote by H1t2. Second is the heating (or cooling) sup-
plied by the furnace (or air conditioner). This rate of increase (or decrease) in temperature 
will be represented by U1t2. In general, the additional heating rate H1t2 and the furnace (or 
air conditioner) rate U1t2 are described in terms of energy per unit time (such as British ther-
mal units per hour). However, by multiplying by the heat capacity of the building (in units of 
degrees temperature change per unit heat energy), we can express the two quantities H1t2 and 
U1t2 in terms of temperature per unit time.
The third factor is the effect of the outside temperature M1t2 on the temperature inside the 
building. Experimental evidence has shown that this factor can be modeled using Newton’s 
law of cooling. This law states that the rate of change in the temperature T1t2 is proportional 
to the difference between the outside temperature M1t2 and the inside temperature T1t2. That 
is, the rate of change in the building temperature due to M1t2 is
K3M1t2 - T1t24 .
The positive constant K depends on the physical properties of the building, such as the num-
ber of doors and windows and the type of insulation, but K does not depend on M, T, or t. 
Hence, when the outside temperature is greater than the inside temperature, M1t2 - T1t2 7 0 
and there is an increase in the building temperature due to M1t2. On the other hand, when the 
3.3  Heating and Cooling of Buildings

Section 3.3    Heating and Cooling of Buildings          103
outside temperature is less than the inside temperature, then M1t2 - T1t2 6 0 and the building 
temperature decreases.
Summarizing, we find
(1)	
dT
dt = K3M1t2 −T1t24 + H1t2 + U1t2 ,
where the additional heating rate H1t2 is always nonnegative and U1t2 is positive for furnace 
heating and negative for air conditioner cooling. A more detailed model of the temperature 
dynamics of the building could involve more variables to represent different temperatures in 
different rooms or zones. Such an approach would use compartmental analysis, with the rooms 
as different compartments (see Problems 35–37, Exercises 5.2).
Because equation (1) is linear, it can be solved using the method discussed in Section 2.3. 
Rewriting (1) in the standard form

 1t2 + P1t2T1t2 = Q1t2 ,
where
	
 P1t2 J K ,
(3)	
 Q1t2 J KM1t2 + H1t2 + U1t2 ,
we find that the integrating factor is
m1t2 = expa

K dtb = eKt .
To solve (2), multiply each side by eKt and integrate:
 eKt dT
dt
 1t2 + KeKtT1t2 = eKtQ1t2 ,
 eKtT1t2 =

eKtQ1t2dt + C .
Solving for T1t2 gives
(4)	
 T1t2 = e−Kt
L
eKtQ1t2dt + Ce−Kt
 = e−Kte
L
eKt3KM1t2 + H1t2 + U1t24dt + Cf .
Example 1
Suppose at the end of the day (at time t0), when people leave the building, the outside tem-
perature stays constant at M0, the additional heating rate H inside the building is zero, and the 
furnace/air conditioner rate U is zero. Determine T1t2, given the initial condition T1t02 = T0.
Solution
With M = M0, H = 0, and U = 0, equation (4) becomes
 T1t2 = e-Kt c
L
eKtKM0 dt + Cd = e-Kt3M0eKt + C4
 =  M0 + Ce-Kt .
Setting t = t0 and using the initial value T0 of the temperature, we find that the constant C is 
1T0 - M02 exp1Kt02. Hence,
(5)	
T1t2 = M0 + 1T0 - M02e-K1t-t02 .  ◆

104          Chapter 3    Mathematical Models and Numerical Methods Involving First-Order Equations
When M0 6 T0, the solution in (5) decreases exponentially from the initial temperature T0 
to the final temperature M0. To determine a measure of the time it takes for the temperature to 
change “substantially,” consider the simple linear equation dA>dt = -aA, whose solutions 
have the form A1t2 = A102e-at. Now, as t S + ∞, the function A1t2 either decays expo-
nentially 1a 7 02 or grows exponentially 1a 6 02. In either case the time it takes for A1t2 to 
change from A102 to A102>e 1 ≈0.368 A1022 is just 1>a because
Aa 1
a b = A102e-a11>a2 = A102
e
 .
The quantity 1> 0 a0 , which is independent of A102, is called the time constant for the equation. 
For linear equations of the more general form dA>dt = -aA + g1t2, we again refer to 1> 0 a0  
as the time constant.
Returning to Example 1, we see that the temperature T1t2 satisfies the equations
dT
dt
 1t2 = - KT1t2 + KM0 ,  d1T - M02
dt
 1t2 =  -K3T1t2 - M04 ,
for M0 a constant. In either case, the time constant is just 1>K, which represents the time it 
takes for the temperature difference T - M0 to change from T0 - M0 to 1T0 - M02>e. We also 
call 1>K the time constant for the building (without heating or air conditioning). A typical 
value for the time constant of a building is 2 to 4 hr, but the time constant can be much shorter 
if windows are open or if there is a fan circulating air. Or it can be much longer if the building 
is well insulated.
In the context of Example 1, we can use the notion of time constant to answer our initial 
question (a): The building temperature changes exponentially with a time constant of 1>K. An 
answer to question (b) about the temperature inside the building during spring and fall is given 
in the next example.
Example 2
Find the building temperature T1t2 if the additional heating rate H1t2 is equal to the constant 
H0, there is no heating or cooling 1U1t2 K 02, and the outside temperature M varies as 
a sine wave over a 24-hr period, with its minimum at t = 0 (midnight) and its maximum at 
t = 12 (noon). That is,
M1t2 = M0 - B cos vt ,
where B is a positive constant, M0 is the average outside temperature, and v = 2p>24 = 
p>12 radians/hr. (This could be the situation during the spring or fall when there is neither 
furnace heating nor air conditioning.)
Solution
The function Q1t2 in (3) is now

Setting B0 J M0 + H0>K, we can rewrite Q as

C = T0 - B0 + BF102 = T0 - B0 +

Notice that the third term in solution (7) involving the constant C tends to zero expo-
nentially. The constant term B0 in (7) is equal to M0 + H0>K and represents the daily average 
temperature inside the building (neglecting the exponential term). When there is no additional 
heating rate inside the building 1H0 = 02, this average temperature is equal to the average out-
side temperature M0. The term BF1t2 in (7) represents the sinusoidal variation of temperature 
inside the building responding to the outside temperature variation. Since F1t2 can be written 
in the form
(8)	
F1t2 = 31 + 1v>K224 -1>2 cos1vt - f2 ,
where tan f = v>K (see Problem 16), the sinusoidal variation inside the building lags behind 
the outside variation by f>v hours. Further, the magnitude of the variation inside the building 
is slightly less, by a factor of 31 + 1v>K224 -1>2, than the outside variation. The angular fre-
quency of variation v is 2p>24 radians/hr (which is about 1>4). Typical values for the dimen-
sionless ratio v>K lie between 1>2 and 1. For this range, the lag between inside and outside 
temperature is approximately 1.8 to 3 hr and the magnitude of the inside variation is between 
89% and 71% of the variation outside. Figure 3.6 shows the 24-hr sinusoidal variation of the

Example 3
Suppose, in the building of Example 2, a simple thermostat is installed that is used to compare 
the actual temperature inside the building with a desired temperature TD. If the actual tempera-
ture is below the desired temperature, the furnace supplies heating; otherwise, it is turned off. 
If the actual temperature is above the desired temperature, the air conditioner supplies cool-
ing; otherwise, it is off. (In practice, there is some dead zone around the desired temperature 
in which the temperature difference is not sufficient to activate the thermostat, but that is to be 
ignored here.) Assuming that the amount of heating or cooling supplied is proportional to the 
difference in temperature—that is,
U1t2 = KU3TD - T1t24 ,
where KU is the (positive) proportionality constant—find T1t2.
outside temperature for a typical moderate day as well as the temperature variations inside the 
building for a dimensionless ratio v>K of unity, which corresponds to a time constant 1>K of 
approximately 4 hr. In sketching the latter curve, we have assumed that the exponential term 
has died out.
Solution
If the proportional control U1t2 is substituted directly into the differential equation (1) for the 
building temperature, we get
(9)	
dT1t2
dt
= K3M1t2 - T1t24 + H1t2 + KU3TD - T1t24 .
A comparison of equation (9) with the first-order linear differential equation (2) shows that for 
this example the quantity P is equal to K + KU and the quantity Q1t2 representing the forcing 
function includes the desired temperature TD. That is,
 P = K + KU ,
 Q1t2 = KM1t2 + H1t2 + KUTD .
When the additional heating rate is a constant H0 and the outside temperature M varies as a 
sine wave over a 24-hr period in the same way as it did in Example 2, the forcing function is
Q1t2 = K1M0 - B cos vt2 + H0 + KUTD .
The function Q1t2 has a constant term and a cosine term just as in equation (6). This equiva-
lence becomes more apparent after substituting
(10)	
Q1t2 = K11B2 - B1 cos vt2 ,
where

 .
The expressions for the constant P and the forcing function Q1t2 of equation (10) are 
the same as the expressions in Example 2, except that the constants K, B0, and B are replaced, 

Section 3.3    Heating and Cooling of Buildings          107
respectively, by the constants K1, B2, and B1. Hence, the solution to the differential equation (9) 
will be the same as the temperature solution in Example 2, except that the three constant terms 
are changed. Thus,
(12)	
T1t2 = B2 - B1F11t2 + C exp1 -K1t2 ,
where
F11t2 J
cos vt + 1v>K12sin vt
1 + 1v>K122
 .
The constant C is chosen so that at time t = 0 the value of the temperature T equals T0. Thus,
C = T0 - B2 + B1F1102 .  ◆
In the above example, the time constant for equation (9) is 1>P = 1>K1, where 
K1 = K + KU. Here 1>K1 is referred to as the time constant for the building with heating 
and air-conditioning. For a typical heating and cooling system, KU is somewhat less than 2; 
for a typical building, the constant K is between 1>2 and 1>4. Hence, the sum gives a value for 
K1 of about 2, and the time constant for the building with heating and air-conditioning is about 
1>2 hr.
When the heating or cooling is turned on, it takes about 30 min for the exponential term in 
(12) to die off. If we neglect this exponential term, the average temperature inside the building 
is B2. Since K1 is much larger than K and H0 is small, it follows from (11) that B2 is roughly 
TD, the desired temperature. In other words, after a certain period of time, the temperature 
inside the building is roughly TD, with a small sinusoidal variation. (The outside average M0 
and inside heating rate H0 have only a small effect.) Thus, to save energy, the heating or cool-
ing system may be left off during the night. When it is turned on in the morning, it will take 
roughly 30 min for the inside of the building to attain the desired temperature. These observa-
tions provide an answer to question (c), regarding the temperature inside the building during 
summer and winter, that was posed at the beginning of this section.
The assumption made in Example 3 that the amount of heating or cooling is U1t2 = 
KU3TD - T1t24 may not always be suitable. We have used it here and in the exercises to illus-
trate the use of the time constant. More adventuresome readers may want to experiment with 
other models for U1t2, especially if they have available the numerical techniques discussed in 
Sections 3.6 and 3.7.

Section 3.4    Newtonian Mechanics          109
Mechanics is the study of the motion of objects and the effect of forces acting on those objects. 
It is the foundation of several branches of physics and engineering. Newtonian, or classical, 
mechanics deals with the motion of ordinary objects—that is, objects that are large com-
pared to an atom and slow moving compared with the speed of light. A model for Newtonian 
mechanics can be based on Newton’s laws of motion:†
1.	 When a body is subject to no resultant external force, it moves with a constant 
velocity.
2.	 When a body is subject to one or more external forces, the time rate of change of the 
body’s momentum is equal to the vector sum of the external forces acting on it.
3.	 When one body interacts with a second body, the force of the first body on the sec-
ond is equal in magnitude, but opposite in direction, to the force of the second body 
on the first.
Experimental results for more than two centuries verify that these laws are extremely use-
ful for studying the motion of ordinary objects in an inertial reference frame—that is, a ref-
erence frame in which an undisturbed body moves with a constant velocity. It is Newton’s 
second law, which applies only to inertial reference frames, that enables us to formulate the 
equations of motion for a moving body. We can express Newton’s second law by
dp
dt = F1t, x, v2 ,
where F1t, x, v2 is the resultant force on the body at time t, location x, and velocity v, and 
p1t2 is the momentum of the body at time t. The momentum is the product of the mass of the 
body and its velocity—that is,
p1t2 = mv1t2 
—so we can express Newton’s second law as
(1)	
m dv
dt = ma = F1t, x, v2 ,
where a = dv>dt is the acceleration of the body at time t.
Typically one substitutes v = dx>dt for the velocity in (1) and obtains a second-order  
differential equation in the dependent variable x. However, in the present section, we will focus on 
situations where the force F does not depend on x. This enables us to regard (1) as a first-order 
equation

To apply Newton’s laws of motion to a problem in mechanics, the following general 
procedure may be useful.
Procedure for Newtonian Models
(a)	 Determine all relevant forces acting on the object being studied. It is helpful to draw 
a simple diagram of the object that depicts these forces.
(b)	 Choose an appropriate axis or coordinate system in which to represent the motion of 
the object and the forces acting on it. Keep in mind that this coordinate system must 
be an inertial reference frame.
(c)	 Apply Newton’s second law as expressed in equation (2) to determine the equations 
of motion for the object.
In this section we express Newton’s second law in either of two systems of units: the 
U.S. Customary System or the meter-kilogram-second (MKS) system. The various units in 
these systems are summarized in Table 3.2, along with approximate values for the gravitational 
acceleration (on the surface of Earth).

Example 1
An object of mass m is given an initial downward velocity y0 and allowed to fall under the 
influence of gravity. Assuming the gravitational force is constant and the force due to air resis-
tance is proportional to the velocity of the object, determine the equation of motion for this 
object.
Solution
Two forces are acting on the object: a constant force due to the downward pull of gravity and 
a force due to air resistance that is proportional to the velocity of the object and acts in opposi-
tion to the motion of the object. Hence, the motion of the object will take place along a vertical 
axis. On this axis we choose the origin to be the point where the object was initially dropped 
and let x1t2 denote the distance the object has fallen in time t (see Figure 3.7).

Figure 3.7 Forces on a falling object

Section 3.4    Newtonian Mechanics          111
The forces acting on the object along this axis can be expressed as follows. The force due 
to gravity is
F1 = mg ,
where g is the acceleration due to gravity at Earth’s surface (see Table 3.2). The force due to 
air resistance is
F2 = -bv1t2 ,
where b1 7 02 is the proportionality constant† and the negative sign is present because air 
resistance acts in opposition to the motion of the object. Hence, the net force acting on the 
object (see Figure 3.7) is
(3)	
F = F1 + F2 = mg - bv1t2 .
We now apply Newton’s second law by substituting (3) into (2) to obtain
m dv
dt = mg - bv .
Since the initial velocity of the object is v0, a model for the velocity of the falling body is 
expressed by the initial value problem
(4)	
m dv
dt = mg - bv ,  v102 = v0 ,
where g and b are positive constants.
The model (4) is the same as the one we obtained in Section 2.1. Using separation of vari-
ables or the method of Section 2.3 for linear equations, we get
(5)	
V1t2 = mg
b + aV0 −mg
b be−bt,m .
Since we have taken x = 0 when t = 0, we can determine the equation of motion of the object 
by integrating v = dx>dt with respect to t. Thus, from (5) we obtain
x1t2 =

v1t2 dt = mg

and setting x = 0 when t = 0, we find

In Figure 3.8, we have sketched the graphs of the velocity and the position as functions of 
t. Observe that the velocity v1t2 approaches the horizontal asymptote v = mg/b as t S + ∞ 
and that the position x1t2 asymptotically approaches the line
x = mg

as t S + ∞. The value mg/b of the horizontal asymptote for v1t2 is called the limiting, or 
terminal, velocity of the object, and, in fact, v = mg>b = constant is a solution of (4). Since 
the two forces are in balance, this is called an “equilibrium” solution.
Notice that the terminal velocity depends on the mass but not the initial velocity of  
the object; the velocity of every free-falling body approaches the limiting value mg/b. Heavier 
objects do, in the presence of friction, ultimately fall faster than lighter ones, but for a given 
object the terminal velocity is the same whether it initially is tossed upward or downward, or 
simply dropped from rest.
Now that we have obtained the equation of motion for a falling object with air resistance 
proportional to v, we can answer a variety of questions.

Example 2
An object of mass 3 kg is released from rest 500 m above the ground and allowed to fall under 
the influence of gravity. Assume the gravitational force is constant, with g = 9.81 m>sec2, and 
the force due to air resistance is proportional to the velocity of the object† with proportionality 
constant b = 3 N-sec/m. Determine when the object will strike the ground.
Solution
We can use the model discussed in Example 1 with v0 = 0, m = 3, b = 3, and g = 9.81. 
From (6), the equation of motion in this case is
x1t2 = 13219.812
3
 t - 132219.812
1322
 11 - e-3t>32 = 19.812t - 19.81211 - e-t2 .
Because the object is released 500 m above the ground, we can determine when the object 
strikes the ground by setting x1t2 = 500 and solving for t. Thus, we put
500 = 19.812t - 9.81 + 19.812e-t

or
t + e-t = 509.81

= 51.97 ,
where we have rounded the computations to two decimal places. Unfortunately, this equation 
cannot be solved explicitly for t. We might try to approximate t using Newton’s approximation 
method (see Appendix B), but in this case, it is not necessary. Since e-t will be very small for t 
near 51.97 1e-51.97 ≈10-222, we simply ignore the term e-t and obtain as our approximation 
t = 51.97 sec.  ◆
Example 3
A parachutist whose mass is 75 kg drops from a helicopter hovering 4000 m above the ground 
and falls toward the earth under the influence of gravity. Assume the gravitational force is 
constant. Assume also that the force due to air resistance is proportional to the velocity of the 
parachutist, with the proportionality constant b1 = 15 N-sec/m when the chute is closed and 
with constant b2 = 105 N-sec/m when the chute is open. If the chute does not open until 1 min 
after the parachutist leaves the helicopter, after how many seconds will she hit the ground?
Solution
We are interested only in when the parachutist will hit the ground, not where. Thus, we con-
sider only the vertical component of her descent. For this, we need to use two equations: one 
to describe the motion before the chute opens and the other to apply after it opens. Before the 
chute opens, the model is the same as in Example 1 with v0 = 0, m = 75 kg, b = b1 = 15 
N-sec/m, and g = 9.81 m/sec2. If we let x11t2 be the distance the parachutist has fallen in t sec 
and let v1 = dx1>dt, then substituting into equations (5) and (6), we have
 v11t2 = 175219.812
15
 11 - e-115>752t2
 = 149.05211 - e-0.2t2 ,
and
 x11t2 = 175219.812
15
 t - 1752219.812
11522
 11 - e-115>752t2
 =  49.05t - 245.2511 - e-0.2t2 .
Hence, after 1 min, when t = 60, the parachutist is falling at the rate
v11602 = 149.05211 - e-0.216022 = 49.05 m>sec ,
and has fallen
x11602 = 149.0521602 - 1245.25211 - e-0.216022 = 2697.75 m .
(In these and other computations for this problem, we round our answers to two decimal 
places.)
Now when the chute opens, the parachutist is 4000 - 2697.75 or 1302.25 m above the 
ground and traveling at a velocity of 49.05 m/sec. To determine the equation of motion after 
the chute opens, let x21T2 denote the position of the parachutist T sec after the chute opens 
(so that T = t - 60), taking x2102 = 0 at x11602 (see Figure 3.9, page 114). Further assume 
that the initial velocity of the parachutist after the chute opens is the same as the final velocity 

114          Chapter 3    Mathematical Models and Numerical Methods Involving First-Order Equations
before it opens—that is, x′2102 = x′11602 = 49.05 m/sec. Because the forces acting on the 
parachutist are the same as those acting on the object in Example 1, we can again use equations 
(5) and (6). With v0 =  49.05, m = 75, b = b2 = 105, and g = 9.81, we find from (6) that
 x21T2 = 175219.812

To determine when the parachutist will hit the ground, we set x21T2 = 1302.25, the 
height the parachutist was above the ground when her parachute opened. This gives
 7.01T + 30.03 - 30.03e-1.4T = 1302.25
(7)	
 T - 4.28e-1.4T - 181.49 = 0 .
Again we cannot solve (7) explicitly for T. However, observe that e-1.4T is very small for T near 
181.49, so we ignore the exponential term and obtain T = 181.49. Hence, the parachutist will 
strike the ground 181.49 sec after the parachute opens, or 241.49 sec after dropping from the 
helicopter.  ◆
In the computation for T in equation (7), we found that the exponential e-1.4T was 
negligible. Consequently, ignoring the corresponding exponential term in equation (5), we see 
that the parachutist’s velocity at impact is

In some situations the resistive drag force on an object is proportional to a power of 0 v0  other 
than 1. Then when the velocity is positive, Newton’s second law for a falling object generalizes 
to

where m and g have their usual interpretation and b 1 7  02 and the exponent r are experimental 
constants. [More generally, the drag force would be written as -b0 v0 rsign1v2.] Express the 
solution to (8) for the case r = 2.

The (positive) equilibrium solution, with the forces in balance, is v = v0 = 2mg>b. Other-
wise, we write (8) as v′ = b1v2

Here c3 = c2 sign3 1v0 + v2>1v0 - v24 is determined by the initial conditions. Again we see 
that v approaches the terminal velocity v0 as t S ∞.  ◆
Unless otherwise stated, in the following problems we assume 
that the gravitational force is constant with g = 9.81 m/sec2 
in the MKS system and g = 32 ft/sec2 in the U.S. Customary 
System.
1.	 An object of mass 5 kg is released from rest 1000 m above 
the ground and allowed to fall under the influence of grav-
ity. Assuming the force due to air resistance is proportional 
to the velocity of the object with proportionality constant 
b = 50 N-sec/m, determine the equation of motion of the 
object. When will the object strike the ground?
2.	 A 400-lb object is released from rest 500 ft above the 
ground and allowed to fall under the influence of gravity. 
Assuming that the force in pounds due to air resistance 
is -10v, where v is the velocity of the object in ft/sec, 
determine the equation of motion of the object. When 
will the object hit the ground?
3.	 If the object in Problem 1 has a mass of 500 kg instead 
of 5 kg, when will it strike the ground? [Hint: Here the 
exponential term is too large to ignore. Use Newton’s 
method to approximate the time t when the object strikes 
the ground (see Appendix B).]
4.	 If the object in Problem 2 is released from rest 30 ft 
above the ground instead of 500 ft, when will it strike 
the ground? [Hint: Use Newton’s method to solve for t.]
5.	 An object of mass 5 kg is given an initial downward 
velocity of 50 m/sec and then allowed to fall under the 
influence of gravity. Assume that the force in newtons 
due to air resistance is -10v, where v is the velocity of 
the object in m/sec. Determine the equation of motion 
of the object. If the object is initially 500 m above the 
ground, determine when the object will strike the ground.
6.	 An object of mass 8 kg is given an upward initial veloc-
ity of 20 m/sec and then allowed to fall under the influ-
ence of gravity. Assume that the force in newtons due 
to air resistance is -16v, where v is the velocity of the 
object in m/sec. Determine the equation of motion of the 
object. If the object is initially 100 m above the ground, 
determine when the object will strike the ground.
7.	 A parachutist whose mass is 75 kg drops from a helicopter 
hovering 2000 m above the ground and falls toward the 
ground under the influence of gravity. Assume that the 
force due to air resistance is proportional to the velocity 
of the parachutist, with the proportionality constant  
b1 = 30 N-sec/m when the chute is closed and b2 = 
90 N-sec/m when the chute is open. If the chute does not 
open until the velocity of the parachutist reaches 20 m/sec, 
after how many seconds will she reach the ground?
8.	 A parachutist whose mass is 100 kg drops from a heli-
copter hovering 3000 m above the ground and falls 
under the influence of gravity. Assume that the force 
due to air resistance is proportional to the velocity of 
the parachutist, with the proportionality constant b3 = 
20 N-sec/m when the chute is closed and b4 = 100 
N-sec/m when the chute is open. If the chute does not 
open until 30 sec after the parachutist leaves the helicop-
ter, after how many seconds will he hit the ground? If the 
chute does not open until 1 min after he leaves the heli-
copter, after how many seconds will he hit the ground?

9.	 An object of mass 100 kg is released from rest from a boat 
into the water and allowed to sink. While gravity is pull-
ing the object down, a buoyancy force of 1>40 times the 
weight of the object is pushing the object up (weight =
mg). If we assume that water resistance exerts a force 
on the object that is proportional to the velocity of the 
object, with proportionality constant 10 N-sec/m, find the 
equation of motion of the object. After how many sec-
onds will the velocity of the object be 70 m/sec?
10.	 An object of mass 2 kg is released from rest from a 
platform 30 m above the water and allowed to fall under 
the influence of gravity. After the object strikes the water, 
it begins to sink with gravity pulling down and a buoyancy 
force pushing up. Assume that the force of gravity is con-
stant, no change in momentum occurs on impact with the 
water, the buoyancy force is 1>2 the weight (weight = mg), 
and the force due to air resistance or water resistance is 
proportional to the velocity, with proportionality constant 
b1 = 10 N-sec/m in the air and b2 = 100 N-sec/m in the 
water. Find the equation of motion of the object. What is 
the velocity of the object 1 min after it is released?
11.	 In Example 1, we solved for the velocity of the object as a 
function of time (equation (5)). In some cases, it is useful 
to have an expression, independent of t, that relates v and 
x. Find this relation for the motion in Example 1. [Hint: 
Letting v1t2 = V1x1t22, then dv>dt = 1dV>dx2V.]
12.	 A shell of mass 2 kg is shot upward with an initial veloc-
ity of 200 m/sec. The magnitude of the force on the shell 
due to air resistance is 0 v0 >20. When will the shell reach 
its maximum height above the ground? What is the maxi-
mum height?
13.	 When the velocity v of an object is very large, the  
magnitude of the force due to air resistance is proportional 
to v2 with the force acting in opposition to the motion 
of the object. A shell of mass 3 kg is shot upward from 
the ground with an initial velocity of 500 m/sec. If the 
magnitude of the force due to air resistance is 10.12v2, 
when will the shell reach its maximum height above the 
ground? What is the maximum height?
14.	 An object of mass m is released from rest and falls 
under the influence of gravity. If the magnitude of the 
force due to air resistance is bvn, where b and n are 
positive constants, find the limiting velocity of the 
object (assuming this limit exists). [Hint: Argue that 
the existence of a (finite) limiting velocity implies that 
dv>dt S 0 as t S + ∞.]
15.	 A rotating flywheel is being turned by a motor that 
exerts a constant torque T (see Figure 3.10). A retard-
ing torque due to friction is proportional to the angular 
velocity v. If the moment of inertia of the flywheel is  
I and its initial angular velocity is v0, find the equa-
tion for the angular velocity v as a function of time. 
[Hint: Use Newton’s second law for rotational motion, 
that is, moment of inertia * angular acceleration = sum 
of the torques.]
16.	 Find the equation for the angular velocity v in Problem 
15, assuming that the retarding torque is proportional to 
1v.
17.	 In Problem 16, let I = 50 kg-m2 and the retarding torque 
be 51v N-m. If the motor is turned off with the angular 
velocity at 225 rad/sec, determine how long it will take 
for the flywheel to come to rest.
18.	 When an object slides on a surface, it encounters a resis-
tance force called friction. This force has a magnitude 
of mN, where m is the coefficient of kinetic friction and 
N is the magnitude of the normal force that the surface 
applies to the object. Suppose an object of mass 30 kg is 
released from the top of an inclined plane that is inclined 
30º to the horizontal (see Figure 3.11). Assume the gravi-
tational force is constant, air resistance is negligible, and 
the coefficient of kinetic friction m = 0.2. Determine the 
equation of motion for the object as it slides down the 
plane. If the top surface of the plane is 5 m long, what 
is the velocity of the object when it reaches the bottom?
19.	 An object of mass 60 kg starts from rest at the top of a 
45º inclined plane. Assume that the coefficient of kinetic 
friction is 0.05 (see Problem 18). If the force due to air 
resistance is proportional to the velocity of the object, 
say, -3v, find the equation of motion of the object. How 
long will it take the object to reach the bottom of the 
inclined plane if the incline is 10 m long?

20.	 An object at rest on an inclined plane will not slide 
until the component of the gravitational force down the 
incline is sufficient to overcome the force due to static 
friction. Static friction is governed by an experimental 
law somewhat like that of kinetic friction (Problem 18); 
it has a magnitude of at most mN, where m is the coef-
ficient of static friction and N is, again, the magnitude of 
the normal force exerted by the surface on the object. If 
the plane is inclined at an angle a, determine the critical 
value a0 for which the object will slide if a 7 a0 but will 
not move for a 6 a0.
21.	 A sailboat has been running (on a straight course) under 
a light wind at 1 m/sec. Suddenly the wind picks up, 
blowing hard enough to apply a constant force of 600 N 
to the sailboat. The only other force acting on the boat 
is water resistance that is proportional to the velocity of 
the boat. If the proportionality constant for water resis-
tance is b = 100 N-sec/m and the mass of the sailboat 
is 50 kg, find the equation of motion of the sailboat. 
What is the limiting velocity of the sailboat under this 
wind?
22.	 In Problem 21 it is observed that when the velocity of 
the sailboat reaches 5 m/sec, the boat begins to rise out 
of the water and “plane.” When this happens, the pro-
portionality constant for the water resistance drops to  
b0 = 60 N-sec/m. Now find the equation of motion of 
the sailboat. What is the limiting velocity of the sailboat 
under this wind as it is planing?
23.	 Sailboats A and B each have a mass of 60 kg and cross 
the starting line at the same time on the first leg of a race. 
Each has an initial velocity of 2 m/sec. The wind applies 
a constant force of 650 N to each boat, and the force due 
to water resistance is proportional to the velocity of the 
boat. For sailboat A the proportionality constants are  
b1 = 80 N-sec/m before planing when the velocity is 
less than 5 m/sec and b2 = 60 N-sec/m when the veloc-
ity is above 5 m/sec. For sailboat B the proportionality 
constants are b3 = 100 N-sec/m before planing when the 
velocity is less than 6 m/sec and b4 = 50 N-sec/m when 
the velocity is above 6 m/sec. If the first leg of the race is 
500 m long, which sailboat will be leading at the end of 
the first leg?
24.	 Rocket Flight.  A model rocket having initial mass  
m0 kg is launched vertically from the ground. The rocket 
expels gas at a constant rate of a kg/sec and at a constant 
velocity of b m/sec relative to the rocket. Assume that 
the magnitude of the gravitational force is proportional 
to the mass with proportionality constant g. Because the 
mass is not constant, Newton’s second law leads to the 
equation
1m0 - at2 dv
dt - ab = -g1m0 - at2 ,
where v = dx>dt is the velocity of the rocket, x is its 
height above the ground, and m0 - at is the mass of the 
rocket at t sec after launch. If the initial velocity is zero, 
solve the above equation to determine the velocity of the 
rocket and its height above ground for 0 … t 6 m0>a.
25.	 Escape Velocity.  According to Newton’s law of gravi-
tation, the attractive force between two objects varies 
inversely as the square of the distances between them. 
That is, Fg = GM1M2>r2, where M1 and M2 are the 
masses of the objects, r is the distance between them 
(center to center), Fg is the attractive force, and G is 
the constant of proportionality. Consider a projectile of  
constant mass m being fired vertically from Earth  
(see Figure 3.12). Let t represent time and v the velocity 
of the projectile.
	
(a)	 Show that the motion of the projectile, under Earth’s 
gravitational force, is governed by the equation

where r is the distance between the projectile and 
the center of Earth, R is the radius of Earth, M is the 
mass of Earth, and g = GM>R2.

ity of the projectile remains positive if and only if

the escape velocity of Earth.

In this section we consider the application of first-order differential equations to simple electrical 
circuits consisting of a voltage source (e.g., a battery or a generator), a resistor, and either an 
inductor or a capacitor. These so-called RL and RC circuits are shown in Figure 3.13. More 
general circuits will be discussed in Section 5.7.
The physical principles governing electrical circuits were formulated by G. R. Kirchhoff† 
in 1859. They are the following:
1.	 Kirchhoff’s current law  The algebraic sum of the currents flowing into any junc-
tion point must be zero.
2.	 Kirchhoff’s voltage law  The algebraic sum of the instantaneous changes in poten-
tial (voltage drops) around any closed loop must be zero.
Kirchhoff’s current law implies that the same current passes through all elements in each 
circuit of Figure 3.13.
To apply Kirchhoff’s voltage law, we need to know the voltage drop across each element 
of the circuit. These voltage formulas are stated below (you can consult an introductory phys-
ics text for further details).
	
(a)	 According to Ohm’s law, the voltage drop ER across a resistor is proportional to the 
current I passing through the resistor:
ER = RI .
	
	 The proportionality constant R is called the resistance.
	
(b)	 It can be shown using Faraday’s law and Lenz’s law that the voltage drop EL across 
an inductor is proportional to the instantaneous rate of change of the current I:
EL = L dI
dt .
	
	 The proportionality constant L is called the inductance.

Example 1
An RL circuit with a 1-Ω resistor and a 0.01-H inductor is driven by a voltage E1t2 = sin 100t V. 
If the initial inductor current is zero, determine the subsequent resistor and inductor voltages 
and the current.
The common units and symbols used for electrical circuits are listed in Table 3.3.
A voltage source is assumed to add voltage or potential energy to the circuit. If we let  
E1t2 denote the voltage supplied to the circuit at time t, then applying Kirchhoff’s voltage law 
to the RL circuit in Figure 3.13(a) on page 118 gives
(1)	
EL + ER = E1t2 .
Substituting into (1) the expressions for EL and ER gives
(2)	
LdI
dt + RI = E1t2 .
Note that this equation is linear (compare Section 2.3), and upon writing it in standard form we 
obtain the integrating factor
m1t2 = e11R>L2 dt = eRt>L ,
which leads to the following general solution [see equation (8), Section 2.3, page 50]
(3)	
I1t2 = e-Rt>Lc

For the RL circuit, one is usually given the initial current I102 as an initial condition.

Solution
From equation (3) and the integral tables, we find that the general solution to the linear equa-
tion (2) is given by
I1t2 = e-100ta

+ Ke-100t .
For I102 = 0, we obtain -1>2 + K = 0, so K = 1>2 and the current is
I1t2 = 0.51sin 100t - cos 100t + e-100t2 .
The resistor and inductor voltages are then given by
ER1t2 = RI1t2 K I1t2 ,
EL1t2 = L dI
dt = 10.521cos 100t + sin 100t - e-100t2 .  ◆
Now we turn to the RC circuit in Figure 3.13(b), page 118. Applying Kirchhoff’s voltage 
law yields
RI + q>C = E1t2 .
The capacitor current, however, is the rate of change of its charge: I = dq>dt. So
(4)	
R dq
dt + q
C = E
is the governing differential equation for the RC circuit. The initial condition for a capacitor is 
its charge q at t = 0.
Example 2
Suppose a capacitor of C farads holds an initial charge of Q coulombs. To alter the charge, 
a constant voltage source of V volts is applied through a resistance of R ohms. Describe the 
capacitor charge for t 7 0.
Solution
Since E1t2 = V is constant in equation (4), the latter is both separable and linear, and its general 
solution is easily derived:
q1t2 = CV + Ke-t>RC .
The solution meeting the prescribed initial condition is
q1t2 = CV + 1Q - CV2e-t>RC .
The capacitor charge changes exponentially from Q to CV as time increases.  ◆
If we take V = 0 in Example 2, we see that the time constant—that is, the time required 
for the capacitor charge to drop to 1>e times its initial value—is RC. Thus, a capacitor is a 
leaky energy-storage device; even the very high resistivity of the surrounding air can dissipate 
its charge, particularly on a humid day. Capacitors are used in cellular phones to store electri-
cal energy from the battery while the phone is in a (more-or-less) idle receiving mode and then 
assist the battery in delivering energy during the transmitting mode.
The time constant for inductor current in the RL circuit can be gleaned from Example 1 to be 
L>R. An application of the RL circuit is the spark plug of a combustion engine. If a voltage source 
establishes a nonzero current in an inductor and the source is suddenly disconnected, the rapid 

Section 3.6    Numerical Methods: A Closer Look At Euler’s Algorithm          121
change of current produces a high dI>dt and, in accordance with the formula EL = L dI>dt, 
the inductor generates a voltage surge sufficient to cause a spark across the terminals—thus 
igniting the gasoline.
If an inductor and a capacitor both appear in a circuit, the governing differential equation 
will be second order. We’ll return to RLC circuits in Section 5.7.
1.	 An RL circuit with a 5-Ω resistor and a 0.05-H inductor 
carries a current of 1 A at t = 0, at which time a volt-
age source E1t2 = 5 cos 120t V is added. Determine the 
subsequent inductor current and voltage.
2.	 An RC circuit with a 1-Ω resistor and a 0.000001-F 
capacitor is driven by a voltage E1t2 = sin 100 t V. If 
the initial capacitor voltage is zero, determine the sub-
sequent resistor and capacitor voltages and the current.
3.	 The pathway for a binary electrical signal between gates 
in an integrated circuit can be modeled as an RC circuit, 
as in Figure 3.13(b); the voltage source models the trans-
mitting gate, and the capacitor models the receiving gate. 
Typically, the resistance is 100 Ω, and the capacitance is 
very small, say, 10-12 F (1 picofarad, pF). If the capacitor 
is initially uncharged and the transmitting gate changes 
instantaneously from 0 to 5 V, how long will it take for 
the voltage at the receiving gate to reach (say) 3 V? (This 
is the time it takes to transmit a logical “1.”)
4.	 If the resistance in the RL circuit of Figure 3.13(a) is zero, 
show that the current I1t2 is directly proportional to the 
integral of the applied voltage E1t2. Similarly, show that 
if the resistance in the RC circuit of Figure 3.13(b) is 
zero, the current is directly proportional to the derivative 
of the applied voltage.
5.	 The power generated or dissipated by a circuit element 
equals the voltage across the element times the current 
through the element. Show that the power dissipated by a 
resistor equals I2R, the power associated with an inductor 
equals the derivative of 11>22L I2, and the power associ-
ated with a capacitor equals the derivative of 11>22CE2
C.
6.	 Derive a power balance equation for the RL and RC cir-
cuits. (See Problem 5.) Discuss the significance of the 
signs of the three power terms.
7.	 An industrial electromagnet can be modeled as an RL 
circuit, while it is being energized with a voltage source. 
If the inductance is 10 H and the wire windings contain  
3 Ω of resistance, how long does it take a constant 
applied voltage to energize the electromagnet to within 
90% of its final value (that is, the current equals 90% of 
its asymptotic value)?
8.	 A 10-8-F capacitor (10 nanofarads) is charged to 50 V 
and then disconnected. One can model the charge leak-
age of the capacitor with a RC circuit with no voltage 
source and the resistance of the air between the capacitor 
plates. On a cold dry day, the resistance of the air gap is 
5 * 1013 Ω; on a humid day, the resistance is 7 * 106 Ω. 
How long will it take the capacitor voltage to dissipate to 
half its original value on each day?
3.5  EXERCISES
Although the analytical techniques presented in Chapter 2 were useful for the variety of math-
ematical models presented earlier in this chapter, the majority of the differential equations 
encountered in applications cannot be solved either implicitly or explicitly. This is especially 
true of higher-order equations and systems of equations, which we study in later chapters. In this 
section and the next, we discuss methods for obtaining a numerical approximation of the solution 
to an initial value problem for a first-order differential equation. Our goal is to develop algo-
rithms that you can use with a calculator or computer.† These algorithms also extend naturally

y′ = f1x, y2 ,  y1x02 = y0 .
To guarantee that (1) has a unique solution, we assume that f and 0f>0y are continuous in a 
rectangle R J 51x, y2: a 6 x 6 b, c 6 y 6 d6 containing 1x0, y02. It follows from Theorem 
1 in Chapter 1 (page 11) that the initial value problem (1) has a unique solution f1x2 in some 
interval x0 - d 6 x 6 x0 + d, where d is a positive number. Because d is not known a priori, 
there is no assurance that the solution will exist at a particular point x 1 ≠x02, even if x is in the 
interval 1a, b2. However, if 0f>0y is continuous and bounded†† on the vertical strip
S J 51x, y2: a 6 x 6 b, - ∞6 y 6 ∞6 ,
then it turns out that (1) has a unique solution on the whole interval 1a, b2. In describing 
numerical methods, we assume that this last condition is satisfied and that f possesses as many 
continuous partial derivatives as needed.
In Section 1.4 we used the concept of direction fields to motivate a scheme for approxi-
mating the solution to the initial value problem (1). This scheme, called Euler’s method, is 
one of the most basic, so it is worthwhile to discuss its advantages, disadvantages, and possible 
improvements. We begin with a derivation of Euler’s method that is somewhat different from 
that presented in Section 1.4.
Let h 7 0 be fixed (h is called the step size) and consider the equally spaced points
(2)	
xn J x0 + nh ,  n = 0, 1, 2, . . . .
Our goal is to obtain an approximation to the solution f1x2 of the initial value problem (1) at 
those points xn that lie in the interval 1a, b2. Namely, we will describe a method that generates 
values y0, y1, y2, . . . that approximate f1x2 at the respective points x0, x1, x2, . . . ; that is,
yn ≈f1xn2 ,  n = 0, 1, 2, . . . .
Of course, the first “approximant” y0 is exact, since y0 = f1x02 is given. Thus, we must 
describe how to compute y1, y2, . . . .
For Euler’s method we begin by integrating both sides of equation (1) from xn to xn+1 to 
obtain
f1xn+12 - f1xn2 =
L
xn + 1
xn
 f′1t2 dt =
L
xn + 1
xn
 f1t, f1t22dt ,
where we have substituted f1x2 for y. Solving for f1xn+12, we have
(3)	
f1xn+12 = f1xn2 +
L
xn + 1
xn
 f1t, f1t22dt .
Without knowing f1t2, we cannot integrate f1t, f1t22. Hence, we must approximate the 
integral in (3). Assuming we have already found yn ≈f1xn2, the simplest approach is to 
†See, for example, A First Course in the Numerical Analysis of Differential Equations, 2nd ed., by A. Iserles  
(Cambridge University Press, 2008), or Numerical Analysis, 9th ed., by R. L. Burden and J. D. Faires (Cengage Learning, 
Independence, KY, 2011).
††A function g1x, y2 is bounded on S if there exists a number M such that 0 g1x, y2 0 … M for all 1x, y2 in S.

Section 3.6    Numerical Methods: A Closer Look At Euler’s Algorithm          123
approximate the area under the function f1t, f1t22 by the rectangle with base 3xn, xn+14 and 
height f1xn, f1xn22 (see Figure 3.14). This gives
f1xn+12 ≈f1xn2 + 1xn+1 - xn2f1xn, f1xn22 .
Substituting h for xn+1 - xn and the approximation yn for f1xn2, we arrive at the numerical 
scheme
(4)	
yn+1 = yn + hf1xn, yn2 ,  n = 0, 1, 2, . . . ,
which is Euler’s method.
Starting with the given value y0, we use (4) to compute y1 = y0 + hf1x0, y02 and then use 
y1 to compute y2 = y1 + hf1x1, y12, and so on. Several examples of Euler’s method can be 
found in Section 1.4. (Compare page 24.)
As discussed in Section 1.4, if we wish to use Euler’s method to approximate the solution 
to the initial value problem (1) at a particular value of x, say, x = c, then we must first deter-
mine a suitable step size h so that x0 + Nh = c for some integer N. For example, we can take  
N = 1 and h = c - x0 in order to arrive at the approximation after just one step:
f1c2 = f1x0 + h2 ≈y1 .
If, instead, we wish to take 10 steps in Euler’s method, we choose h = 1c - x02>10 and ulti-
mately obtain
f1c2 = f1x0 + 10h2 = f1x102 ≈y10 .
In general, depending on the size of h, we will get different approximations to f1c2. It is 
reasonable to expect that as h gets smaller (or, equivalently, as N gets larger), the Euler approx-
imations approach the exact value f1c2. On the other hand, as h gets smaller, the number 
(and cost) of computations increases and hence so do machine errors that arise from round-off. 
Thus, it is important to analyze how the error in the approximation scheme varies with h.
If Euler’s method is used to approximate the solution f1x2 = ex to the problem
(5)	
y′ = y ,  y102 = 1 ,
at x = 1, then we obtain approximations to the constant e = f112. It turns out that these 
approximations take a particularly simple form that enables us to compare the error in the 
approximation with the step size h. Indeed, setting f1x, y2 = y in (4) yields
yn+1 = yn + hyn = 11 + h2yn ,  n = 0, 1, 2, . . . .

Since y0 = 1, we get
 y1 = 11 + h2y0 = 1 + h ,
 y2 = 11 + h2y1 = 11 + h211 + h2 = 11 + h22 ,
 y3 = 11 + h2y2 = 11 + h211 + h22 = 11 + h23 ,
and, in general,
(6)	
yn = 11 + h2n ,  n = 0, 1, 2, . . . .
For the problem in (5) we have x0 = 0, so to obtain approximations at x = 1, we must set 
nh = 1. That is, h must be the reciprocal of an integer 1h = 1>n2. Replacing n by 1>h in (6), 
we see that Euler’s method gives the (familiar) approximation 11 + h21>h to the constant e.  
In Table 3.4, we list this approximation for h = 1, 10-1, 10-2, 10-3, and 10-4, along with the 
corresponding errors
e - 11 + h21>h .
From the second and third columns in Table 3.4, we see that the approximation gains roughly 
one decimal place in accuracy as h decreases by a factor of 10; that is, the error is roughly propor-
tional to h. This observation is further confirmed by the entries in the last column of Table 3.4. In 
fact, using methods of calculus (see Exercises 1.4, Problem 13), it can be shown that
(7)

The general situation is similar: When Euler’s method is used to approximate the solution 
to the initial value problem (1), the error in the approximation is at worst a constant times the 
step size h. Moreover, in view of (7), this is the best one can say.
Numerical analysts have a convenient notation for describing the convergence behavior of 
a numerical scheme. For fixed x we denote by y1x; h2 the approximation to the solution f1x2 
of (1) obtained via the scheme when using a step size of h. We say that the numerical scheme 
converges at x if
lim
hS0
  y1x; h2 = f1x2 .
In other words, as the step size h decreases to zero, the approximations for a convergent scheme 
approach the exact value f1x2. The rate at which y1x; h2 tends to f1x2 is often expressed in 
terms of a suitable power of h. If the error f1x2 - y1x; h2 tends to zero like a constant times 
h  p, we write
F1x2 −y1x; h2 = O1h  p2
and say that the method is of order p. Of course, the higher the power p, the faster is the rate 
of convergence as h S 0.

Section 3.6    Numerical Methods: A Closer Look At Euler’s Algorithm          125
As seen from our earlier discussion, the rate of convergence of Euler’s method is O(h); 
that is, Euler’s method is of order p = 1. In fact, the limit in (7) shows that for equation (5), 
the error is roughly 1.36h for small h. This means that to have an error less than 0.01 requires 
h 6 0.01>1.36, or n = 1>h 7 136 computation steps. Thus Euler’s method converges too 
slowly to be of practical use.
How can we improve Euler’s method? To answer this, let’s return to the derivation 
expressed in formulas (3) and (4) and analyze the “errors” that were introduced to get the 
approximation. The crucial step in the process was to approximate the integral
L
xn + 1
xn

by using a rectangle (recall Figure 3.14 on page 123). This step gives rise to what is called 
the local truncation error in the method. From calculus we know that a better (more accurate) 
approach to approximating the integral is to use a trapezoid—that is, to apply the trapezoidal 
rule (see Figure 3.15). This gives
L

which leads to the numerical scheme
(8)	
yn+1 = yn + h
2
 3f1xn, yn2 + f1xn+1, yn+124 ,  n = 0, 1, 2, . . . .
We call equation (8) the trapezoid scheme. It is an example of an implicit method; that is, 
unlike Euler’s method, equation (8) gives only an implicit formula for yn+1, since yn+1 appears 
as an argument of f. Assuming we have already computed yn, some root-finding technique such 
as Newton’s method (see Appendix B) might be needed to compute yn+1. Despite the incon-
venience of working with an implicit method, the trapezoid scheme has two advantages over 
Euler’s method. First, it is a method of order p = 2; that is, it converges at a rate that is pro-
portional to h2 and hence is faster than Euler’s method. Second, as described in Project F,  
page 148, the trapezoid scheme has the desirable feature of being stable.
Can we somehow modify the trapezoid scheme in order to obtain an explicit method? 
One idea is first to get an estimate, say, y*n+1, of the value yn+1 using Euler’s method and 
then use formula (8) with yn+1 replaced by y*n+1 on the right-hand side. This two-step pro-
cess is an example of a predictor–corrector method. That is, we predict yn+1 using Euler’s

method and then use that value in (8) to obtain a “more correct” approximation. Setting  
yn+1 = yn + h f1xn, yn2 in the right-hand side of (8), we obtain

yn+1 = yn + h
2 3f1xn, yn2 + f1xn + h,  yn + hf1xn, yn22 4 ,  n = 0, 1, . . . ,
where xn+1 = xn + h. This explicit scheme is known as the improved Euler’s method.
Example 1
Compute the improved Euler’s method approximation to the solution f1x2 = ex of
y′ = y ,  y102 = 1
at x = 1 using step sizes of h = 1, 10-1, 10-2, 10-3, and 10-4.
Solution
The starting values are x0 = 0 and y0 = 1. Since f1x, y2 = y, formula (9) becomes
yn+1 = yn + h

2 b
n
 ,  n = 0, 1, 2, . . . .
To obtain approximations at x = 1, we must have 1 = x0 + nh = nh, and so n = 1>h. Hence, 
the improved Euler’s approximations to e = f112 are just
a1 + h + h2
2 b
1>h
 .
In Table 3.5 on page 127 we have computed this approximation for the specified values of h, 
along with the corresponding errors
e - a1 + h + h2
2 b
1>h
 .
Comparing the entries of this table with those of Table 3.4 on page 124, we observe that the 
improved Euler’s method converges much more rapidly than the original Euler’s method. In 
fact, from the first few entries in the second and third columns of Table 3.5, it appears that 
the approximation gains two decimal places in accuracy each time h is decreased by a factor of 
10. In other words, the error is roughly proportional to h2 (see the last column of the table and also 
Problem 4). The entries in the last row of the table must be regarded with caution. Indeed, when  
h = 10-3, the true error is so small that our calculator rounded it to zero, to five decimal places. 
The entry in color in the last column may be inaccurate due to the loss of significant figures in 
the calculator arithmetic.  ◆
As Example 1 suggests, the improved Euler’s method converges at the rate O1h22, and 
indeed it can be proved that in general this method is of order p = 2.

Section 3.6    Numerical Methods: A Closer Look At Euler’s Algorithm          127
A step-by-step outline for a subroutine that implements the improved Euler’s method over 
a given interval 3x0, c4 is described below. For programming purposes it is usually more con-
venient to input the number of steps N in the interval rather than the step size h itself. For an 
interval starting at x = x0 and ending at x = c, the relation between h and N is
(11)	
Nh = c −x0 .
(Note that the subroutine includes an option for printing x and y.) Of course, the implementa-
tion of this algorithm with N steps on the interval 3x0, c4 only produces approximations to the 
actual solution at N + 1 equally spaced points. If we wish to use these points to help graph an 
approximate solution over the whole interval 3x0, c4, then we must somehow “fill in” the gaps 
between these points. A crude method is to simply join the points by straight-line segments 
producing a polygonal line approximation to f1x2. More sophisticated techniques for pre-
scribing the intermediate points are used in professional codes.

Now we want to devise a program that will compute f1c2 to a desired accuracy. As we 
have seen, the accuracy of the approximation depends on the step size h. Our strategy, then, 
will be to estimate f1c2 for a given step size and then halve the step size and recompute the 
estimate, halve again, and so on. When two consecutive estimates of f1c2 differ by less than 
some prescribed tolerance e, we take the final estimate as our approximation to f1c2. Admit-
tedly, this does not guarantee that f1c2 is known to within P, but it provides a reasonable stop-
ping procedure in practice.† The following procedure also contains a safeguard to stop if the 
desired tolerance is not reached after M halvings of h.
†Professional codes monitor accuracy much more carefully and vary step size in an adaptive fashion for this purpose.

Section 3.6    Numerical Methods: A Closer Look At Euler’s Algorithm          129
Solution
The starting values are x0 = 0, y0 = 0.25. Because we are computing the approximations for 
c = 2, the initial value for h is
h = 12 - 022-0 = 2 .
For equation (12), we have f1x, y2 = x + 2y, so the numbers F and G in the subroutine are
 F = x + 2y ,
 G = 1x + h2 + 21y + hF2 = x + 2y + h11 + 2x + 4y2 ,
and we find
 x = x + h ,
 y = y + h
2
 1F + G2 = y + h
2
 12x + 4y2 + h2
2
 11 + 2x + 4y2 .
Thus, with x0 = 0, y0 = 0.25, and h = 2, we get for the first approximation
y = 0.25 + 10 + 12 + 211 + 12 = 5.25 .
To describe the further outputs of the algorithm, we use the notation y12; h2 for the approx-
imation obtained with step size h. Thus, y12; 22 = 5.25, and we find from the algorithm
 y12; 12 = 11.25000   y12; 2-52 = 25.98132
 y12; 2-12 = 18.28125   y12; 2-62 = 26.03172
 y12; 2-22 = 23.06067   y12; 2-72 = 26.04468
 y12; 2-32 = 25.12012   y12; 2-82 = 26.04797
 y12; 2-42 = 25.79127   y12; 2-92 = 26.04880 .
Since 0 y12; 2-92 - y12; 2-82 0 = 0.00083, which is less than e = 0.001, we stop.
The exact solution of (12) is f1x2 = 1

or the improved Euler’s methods.

a calculator or computer available. You may use a software

14.	 By experimenting with the improved Euler’s method 
subroutine, find the maximum value over the interval 
30, 24 of the solution to the initial value problem
y′ = sin1x + y2 ,  y102 = 2 .
Where does this maximum value occur? Give answers to 
two decimal places.
15.	 The solution to the initial value problem
dy
dx = 1x + y + 222 ,  y102 = -2
crosses the x-axis at a point in the interval 30, 1.44. By 
experimenting with the improved Euler’s method sub-
routine, determine this point to two decimal places.
16.	 The solution to the initial value problem
dy
dx + y
x = x3y2 ,  y112 = 3
has a vertical asymptote (“blows up”) at some point in 
the interval 31, 24. By experimenting with the improved 
Euler’s method subroutine, determine this point to two 
decimal places.
17.	 Use Euler’s method (4) with h = 0.1 to approximate the 
solution to the initial value problem
y′ = -20y ,  y102 = 1 ,
on the interval 0 … x … 1 (that is, at x = 0, 0.1, . . . , 1.0). 
Compare your answers with the actual solution 
y = e-20x. What went wrong? Next, try the step size  
h = 0.025 and also h = 0.2. What conclusions can you 
draw concerning the choice of step size?
18.	 Local versus Global Error.  In deriving formula 
(4) for Euler’s method, a rectangle was used to 
approximate the area under a curve (see Figure 3.14). 
With g1t2 J f1t, f1t22, this approximation can be 
written as
L
xn + 1
xn
 g1t2 dt ≈hg1xn2 , where h = xn+1 - xn .
(a)	 Show that if g has a continuous derivative that is 
bounded in absolute value by B, then the rectangle 
approximation has error O1h22; that is, for some 
constant M,
`
L
xn + 1
xn
 g1t2 dt -  hg1xn2 `  …  Mh2 .
	
This is called the local truncation error of the scheme. 
[Hint: Write
L
xn + 1
xn
 g1t2dt -  hg1xn2 =
L
xn + 1
xn
 3g1t2 - g1xn24 dt .
	
Next, using the mean value theorem, show that 
0 g1t2 - g1xn2 0  …  B0 t - xn0 . Then integrate to 
obtain the error bound 1B>22h2.]
(b)	 In applying Euler’s method, local truncation errors 
occur in each step of the process and are propagated 
throughout the further computations. Show that the 
sum of the local truncation errors in part (a) that 
arise after n steps is O1h2. This is the global error, 
which is the same as the convergence rate of Euler’s 
method.
19.	 Building Temperature.  In Section 3.3 we modeled 
the temperature inside a building by the initial value 
problem
(13)	
 dT
dt = K3M1t2 - T1t24 + H1t2 + U1t2 
 T1t02 = T0 ,
where M is the temperature outside the building, T is 
the temperature inside the building, H is the addi-
tional heating rate, U is the furnace heating or air 
conditioner cooling rate, K is a positive constant, 
and T0 is the initial temperature at time t0. In a typi-
cal model, t0 = 0 (midnight), T0 = 65°F, H1t2 = 0.1, 
U1t2 = 1.5370 - T1t24, and
M1t2 = 75 - 20 cos1pt>122 .
The constant K is usually between 1>4 and 1>2, depend-
ing on such things as insulation. To study the effect of 
insulating this building, consider the typical building 
described above and use the improved Euler’s method 
subroutine with h = 2>3 to approximate the solution to 
(13) on the interval 0 … t … 24 (1 day) for K = 0.2, 0.4, 
and 0.6.
20.	 Falling Body.  In Example 1 of Section 3.4, page 110, 
we modeled the velocity of a falling body by the initial 
value problem
m dv
dt = mg - bv ,  v102 = v0 ,
under the assumption that the force due to air resistance 
is -bv. However, in certain cases the force due to air 
resistance behaves more like -bvr, where r1712 is 
some constant. This leads to the model
(14)	
m dv
dt = mg - bvr ,  v102 = v0 .
To study the effect of changing the parameter r in (14), 
take m = 1, g = 9.81, b = 2, and v0 = 0. Then use 
the improved Euler’s method subroutine with h = 0.2 
to approximate the solution to (14) on the interval 
0 … t … 5 for r = 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0. What is the relation-
ship between these solutions and the constant solution 
v1t2 K 19.81>221>r ?

132          Chapter 3    Mathematical Models and Numerical Methods Involving First-Order Equations
In Sections 1.4 and 3.6, we discussed a simple numerical procedure, Euler’s method, for 
obtaining a numerical approximation of the solution f(x) to the initial value problem
(1)	
y′ = f1x, y2 ,  y1x02 = y0 .
Euler’s method is easy to implement because it involves only linear approximations to the solu-
tion f1x2. But it suffers from slow convergence, being a method of order 1; that is, the error 
is O1h2. Even the improved Euler’s method discussed in Section 3.6 has order of only 2. In 
this section we present numerical methods that have faster rates of convergence. These include 
Taylor methods, which are natural extensions of the Euler procedure, and Runge–Kutta 
methods, which are the more popular schemes for solving initial value problems because they 
have fast rates of convergence and are easy to program.
As in the previous section, we assume that f and 0f>0y are continuous and bounded on the 
vertical strip {1x, y2: a 6 x 6 b, - ∞6 y 6 ∞} and that f possesses as many continuous par-
tial derivatives as needed.
To derive the Taylor methods, let fn1x2 be the exact solution of the related initial value 
problem
(2)	
f=
n = f1x, fn2 ,  fn1xn2 = yn .
The Taylor series for fn1x2 about the point xn is
fn1x2 = fn1xn2 + hf=
n1xn2 + h2
2!
 f>
n1xn2 + g ,
where h = x - xn. Since fn satisfies (2), we can write this series in the form
(3)	
fn1x2 = yn + hf1xn, yn2 + h2
2!
 f>
n1xn2 + g .
Observe that the recursive formula for yn+1 in Euler’s method is obtained by truncating the 
Taylor series after the linear term. For a better approximation, we will use more terms in the 
Taylor series. This requires that we express the higher-order derivatives of the solution in terms 
of the function f1x, y2.
If y satisfies y′ = f1x, y2, we can compute y″ by using the chain rule:
(4)	
 y″ = 0f
0x
 1x, y2 + 0f
0y
 1x, y2 y′
 = 0f
0x
 1x, y2 + 0f
0y
 1x, y2 f1x, y2
   =: f21x, y2 .
In a similar fashion, define f3, f4, . . . , that correspond to the expressions y‴1x2, y1421x2, etc. If 
we truncate the expansion in (3) after the h  p term, then, with the above notation, the recursive 
formulas for the Taylor method of order p are
(5)	
xn+1 = xn + h ,
(6)	
yn+1 = yn + hf1xn, yn2 + h2
2!
  f21xn, yn2 + P + h  p
p!
  fp1xn, yn2 .
3.7  Higher-Order Numerical Methods:  
Taylor and Runge–Kutta

Section 3.7    Higher-Order Numerical Methods: Taylor and Runge–Kutta           133
As before, yn ≈f1xn2, where f1x2 is the solution to the initial value problem (1). It can 
be shown† that the Taylor method of order p has the rate of convergence O1h  p2.
Example 1
Determine the recursive formulas for the Taylor method of order 2 for the initial value problem
(7)	
y′ = sin1xy2 ,  y102 = p .
Solution
We must compute f21x, y2 as defined in (4). Since f1x, y2 = sin1xy2,
0f
0x
 1x, y2 = y cos1xy2 ,  0f
0y
 1x, y2 = x cos1xy2 .
Substituting into (4), we have
 f21x, y2 = 0f
0x
 1x, y2 + 0f
0y
 1x, y2 f1x, y2
 = y cos1xy2 + x cos1xy2 sin1xy2
 = y cos1xy2 + x
2
  sin12xy2 ,
and the recursive formulas (5) and (6) become
 xn+1 = xn + h ,
 yn+1 = yn + h sin1xnyn2 + h2
2
 c yn cos1xnyn2 + xn
2
  sin12xnyn2 d ,
where x0 = 0, y0 = p are the starting values.  ◆
The convergence rate, O1h  p2, of the pth-order Taylor method raises an interesting ques-
tion: If we could somehow let p go to infinity, would we obtain exact solutions for the interval 
3x0, x0 + h4? This possibility is explored in depth in Chapter 8. Of course, a practical difficulty 
in employing high-order Taylor methods is the tedious computation of the partial derivatives 
needed to determine fp (typically these computations grow exponentially with p). One way to 
circumvent this difficulty is to use one of the Runge–Kutta methods.††
Observe that the general Taylor method has the form
(8)	
yn+1 = yn + hF1xn, yn; h2 ,
where the choice of F depends on p. In particular [compare (6)], for
 p = 1 ,   F = T11x, y; h2 J f1x, y2 ,
(9)	
 p = 2 ,   F = T21x, y; h2 J f1x, y2 + h
2
 c 0f
0x
 1x, y2 + 0f
0y
 1x, y2 f1x, y2 d .
The idea behind the Runge–Kutta method of order 2 is to choose F in (8) of the form
(10)	
F = K21x, y; h2 J f1x + ah, y + bhf1x, y22 ,
where the constants a, b are to be selected so that (8) has the rate of convergence O1h22. The 
advantage here is that K2 is computed by two evaluations of the original function f1x, y2 and 
does not involve the derivatives of f1x, y2.
†See Introduction to Numerical Analysis by J. Stoer and R. Bulirsch (Springer-Verlag, New York, 2002).
††Historical Footnote: These methods were developed by C. Runge in 1895 and W. Kutta in 1901.

134          Chapter 3    Mathematical Models and Numerical Methods Involving First-Order Equations
To ensure O1h22 convergence, we compare this new scheme with the Taylor method of 
order 2 and require
T21x, y; h2 - K21x, y; h2 = O1h22 , as h S 0 .
That is, we choose a, b so that the Taylor expansions for T2 and K2 agree through terms of 
order h. For 1x, y2 fixed, when we expand K2 = K21h2 as given in (10) about h = 0, we find
(11)	
 K21h2 = K2102 + dK2
dh
 102h + O1h22
 = f1x, y2 + c a 0f
0x
 1x, y2 + b 0f
0y
 1x, y2 f1x, y2 dh + O1h22 ,
where the expression in brackets for dK2>dh, evaluated at h = 0, follows from the chain rule. 
Comparing (11) with (9), we see that for T2 and K2 to agree through terms of order h, we must 
have a = b = 1>2. Thus,
K21x, y; h2 = f ax + h
2,  y + h
2
  f1x, y2 b .
The Runge–Kutta method we have derived is called the midpoint method and it has the recur-
sive formulas
(12)	
xn+1 = xn + h ,
(13)	
yn+1 = yn + hf axn + h
2,  yn + h
2
   f1xn, yn2 b .
By construction, the midpoint method has the same rate of convergence as the Taylor method 
of order 2; that is, O1h22. This is the same rate as the improved Euler’s method.
In a similar fashion, one can work with the Taylor method of order 4 and, after some 
elaborate calculations, obtain the classical fourth-order Runge–Kutta method. The recursive 
formulas for this method are
(14)
	
xn+1 = xn + h ,
yn+1 = yn + 1
6
 1k1 + 2k2 + 2k3 + k42 ,
where
 k1 = hf1xn, yn2 ,
 k2 = hf  axn + h
2,  yn + k1
2 b ,
 k3 = hf  axn + h
2,  yn + k2
2 b ,
 k4 = hf1xn + h,  yn + k32 .
The classical fourth-order Runge–Kutta method is one of the more popular methods because 
its rate of convergence is O1h42 and it is easy to program. Typically, it produces very accurate 
approximations even when the number of iterations is reasonably small. However, as the num-
ber of iterations becomes large, other types of errors may creep in.
Program outlines for the fourth-order Runge–Kutta method are given below. Just as with 
the algorithms for the improved Euler’s method, the first program (the Runge–Kutta subrou-
tine) is useful for approximating the solution over an interval 3x0, c4 and takes the number of 

Section 3.7    Higher-Order Numerical Methods: Taylor and Runge–Kutta           135
steps in the interval as input. As in Section 3.6, the number of steps N is related to the step 
size h and the interval 3x0, c4 by
Nh = c - x0 .
The subroutine has the option to print out a table of values of x and y. The second algorithm 
(Runge–Kutta with tolerance) on page 136 is used to approximate, for a given tolerance, the 
solution at an inputted value x = c. This algorithm† automatically halves the step sizes succes-
sively until the two approximations y1c; h2 and y1c; h>22 differ by less than the prescribed 
tolerance e. For a stopping procedure based on the relative error, Step 6 of the algorithm should 
be replaced by
Step 6′  If ` y - z
y
` 6 e, go to Step 10 .
†Note that the form of the algorithm on page 136 is the same as that for the improved Euler’s method on page 128 
except for Step 4, where the Runge–Kutta subroutine is called. More sophisticated stopping procedures are used in 
production-grade codes.

Example 2
Use the classical fourth-order Runge–Kutta algorithm to approximate the solution f1x2 of the 
initial value problem
y′ = y ,  y102 = 1 ,
at x = 1 with a tolerance of 0.001.
Solution
The inputs are x0 = 0, y0 = 1, c = 1, e = 0.001, and M = 25 (say). Since f1x, y2 = y, the 
formulas in Step 3 of the subroutine become
k = hy ,  k2 = hay + k1
2 b ,  k3 = hay + k2
2 b ,  k4 = h1y + k32 .
The initial value for N in this algorithm is N = 1, so
h = 11 - 02>1 = 1 .
Thus, in Step 3 of the subroutine, we compute
k1 = 112112 = 1 ,  
 k2 = 11211 + 0.52 = 1.5 ,
k3 = 11211 + 0.752 = 1.75 ,  k4 = 11211 + 1.752 = 2.75 ,
and, in Step 4 of the subroutine, we get for the first approximation
 y = y0 + 1
6
 1k1 + 2k2 + 2k3 + k42
 = 1 + 1
6
 31 + 211.52 + 211.752 + 2.754
 = 2.70833 ,

Section 3.7    Higher-Order Numerical Methods: Taylor and Runge–Kutta           137
where we have rounded to five decimal places. Because
0 z - y0 = 0 y0 - y0 = 0 1 - 2.708330 = 1.70833 7 e ,
we start over and reset N = 2, h = 0.5.
Doing Steps 3 and 4 for i = 1 and 2, we ultimately obtain (for i = 2) the approximation
y = 2.71735 .
Since 0 z - y0 = 0 2.70833 - 2.717350 = 0.00902 7 e , we again start over and reset 
N = 4, h = 0.25. This leads to the approximation
y = 2.71821 ,
so that
0 z - y0 = 0 2.71735 - 2.718210 = 0.00086 ,
which is less than e = 0.001. Hence f112 = e ≈2.71821.  ◆
In Example 2 we were able to obtain a better approximation for f112 = e with h = 0.25 
than we obtained in Section 3.6 using Euler’s method with h = 0.001 (see Table 3.4, page 124) 
and roughly the same accuracy as we obtained in Section 3.6 using the improved Euler’s 
method with h = 0.01 (see Table 3.5, page 127).
Example 3
Use the fourth-order Runge–Kutta subroutine to approximate the solution f1x2 of the initial 
value problem
(15)	
y′ = y2 ,  y102 = 1 ,
on the interval 0 … x … 2 using N = 8 steps (i.e., h = 0.25).
Solution
Here the starting values are x0 = 0 and y0 = 1. Since f1x, y2 = y2, the formulas in Step 3 of 
the subroutine are
 k1 = hy2 ,
 k2 = hay + k1
2 b
2
 ,
 k3 = hay + k2
2 b
2
 ,   k4 = h1y + k322 .
From the output, we find
 x = 0.25   y = 1.33322 ,
 x = 0.50   y = 1.99884 ,
 x = 0.75   y = 3.97238 ,
 x = 1.00   y = 32.82820 ,
 x = 1.25   y = 4.09664 * 1011 ,
 x = 1.50   y = overflow .
What happened? Fortunately, the equation in (15) is separable, and, solving for f1x2, we 
obtain f1x2 = 11 - x2-1. It is now obvious where the problem lies: The true solution f1x2 
is not defined at x = 1. If we had been more cautious, we would have realized that 0f>0y = 2y 
is not bounded for all y. Hence, the existence of a unique solution is not guaranteed for all x 
between 0 and 2, and in this case, the method does not give meaningful approximations for x 
near (or greater than) 1.  ◆

138          Chapter 3    Mathematical Models and Numerical Methods Involving First-Order Equations
Example 4
Use the fourth-order Runge–Kutta algorithm to approximate the solution f1x2 of the initial 
value problem
y′ = x - y2 ,  y102 = 1 ,
at x = 2 with a tolerance of 0.0001.
Solution
This time we check to see whether 0f>0y is bounded. Here 0f>0y = -2y, which is certainly 
unbounded in any vertical strip. However, let’s consider the qualitative behavior of the solution 
f1x2. The solution curve starts at (0, 1), where f′102 = 0 - 1 6 0, so f1x2 begins decreas-
ing and continues to decrease until it crosses the curve y = 1x. After crossing this curve, 
f1x2 begins to increase, since f′1x2 = x - f21x2 7 0. As f1x2 increases, it remains below 
the curve y = 1x. This is because if the solution were to get “close” to the curve y = 1x, then 
the derivative of f1x2 would approach zero, so that overtaking the function 1x is impossible.
Therefore, although the existence-uniqueness theorem does not guarantee a solution, we 
are inclined to try the algorithm anyway. The above argument shows that f1x2 probably exists 
for x 7 0, so we feel reasonably sure the fourth-order Runge–Kutta method will give a good 
approximation of the true solution f1x2. Proceeding with the algorithm, we use the starting 
values x0 = 0 and y0 = 1. Since f1x, y2 = x - y2, the formulas in Step 3 of the subroutine 
become
 k1 = h1x - y22 ,
  k2 = hc ax + h
2b - ay + k1
2 b
2
d  ,
 k3 = hc ax + h
2b - ay + k2
2 b
2
d  ,   k4 = h3 1x + h2 - 1y + k3224 .
In Table 3.6, we give the approximations y12; 2-m+12 for f122 for m = 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. The 
algorithm stops at m = 4, since
0 y12; 0.1252 - y12; 0.252 0 = 0.00000 .
Hence, f122 ≈1.25132 with a tolerance of 0.0001.  ◆

As in Exercises 3.6, for some problems you will find it 
essential to have a calculator or computer available.† For

The dynamics of HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infection within a human host involve the 
interaction of the HIV virions and CD4+ T lymphocytes. CD4+ T lymphocytes are long-lived 
white blood cells that play a major role in the defense of the human body against microbial invad-
ers. HIV targets these very cells. When HIV first appeared as a new and major health threat, it was 
recognized that the disease typically exhibited a lengthy gradual progression lasting 10 or more 
years. It was widely believed that the dynamics of HIV destruction of the CD4+ T-cell population 
involved a very low rate of infection and a very slow turnover of virus and infected cells. In 1995 
differential equation models of HIV-CD4+ T-cell interaction revealed that the turnover rate for the 
infected CD4+ T cells was very much faster than this (about 2 days)—a scientific breakthrough 
reported simultaneously in the papers of D. D. Ho et al., “Rapid Turnover of Plasma Virions and 
CD4 Lymphocytes in HIV-1 Infection,” Nature, 1995; and of G. M. Shaw et al., “Viral Dynamics 
in Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type I Infection,” Nature, 1995.
Underlying the models in these papers is the knowledge that within a person infected with 
HIV, the virus spends part of its existence free and part inside an infected CD4+ T cell. The 
time spent free was known to be very short—on the order of 30 minutes. The time spent inside 
an invaded CD4+ T cell was believed to be very long—on the order of years. When a cell was 
invaded, a virion (a complete viral particle, consisting of RNA surrounded by a protein shell) 
took over the cell’s DNA and used it to replicate its own RNA, thereby creating new virions; then 
it budded, or burst the cell, to release multiple virus particles.
The differential equations of the model are similar to those for compartmental analysis dis-
cussed in Section 3.2. They involve compartments and parameters. The compartments of the 
model are
T1t2 = the population of uninfected CD4+ T cells at time t .
I1t2 = the population of infected CD4+ T cells at time t .
V 1t2 = the population of virus at time t .
The parameters (followed by their units) of the model are
l1cells # day-12 = constant input source of uninfected cells per day (the human body 
produces these cells daily in the thymus) .
d1day-12 = normal loss rate constant of uninfected cells 11/d = the average lifespan 
of an uninfected cell in days2 .
b1virions-1 #  day-12 = infection rate constant of uninfected cells per infected cell  
1the rate is of mass action form, i.e., bV1t2 T1t22 .
m1day-12 = loss rate constant of infected cells 11/m = the average lifespan of an 
infected cell in days2 .
g1day-12 = loss rate constant of free virus 11/g = the average lifespan of a free virion 
in days2 .
N1virions #  cell-12 = number of virions produced per day per infected cell (the burst 
number of an infected cell) .

As mentioned above, the average lifespan of a free virion, 1/g, is approximately 30 minutes, 
which means g ≈48 day-1. On the other hand, it was thought that 1/m, the average length of 
time an infected CD4+ T cell lasts before bursting to produce new virions, should be several 
years, implying that m must be quite small 1on the order of 10-3 day-12. However, when drugs 
to treat HIV infection first became available in the mid-1990s, researchers were able to deduce a 
surprisingly different value from patient data and the differential equation models. By completing 
the following steps, you will be able to determine a better approximation to 1/m in the manner 
utilized by Ho et al.
To incorporate the effect of treatment in the differential equations model, set b = 0; that 
is, assume the action of the drug completely inhibits the infection process. This is a reasonable 
approximation and it simplifies the analysis.
(a)	 With the assumption of treatment, what are the reduced forms of the differential equa-
tions for T1t2, I1t2, and V1t2?
(b)	 Solve these reduced equations for T1t2, I1t2, and V1t2, with the initial conditions 
T102 = T0, I102 = I0, and V102 = V0.
(c)	 Argue from your formula for V1t2 that the graph of V1t2 on a log scale (i.e., the graph 
of log V ) over an extended period of time (say, several weeks) will tend toward a graph 
of a straight line whose slope is either -g (the negative reciprocal of the average  
lifespan of a free virus) or -m (the negative reciprocal of the average lifespan of an 
infected CD4+ T cell), according to whether g or m is smaller.
(d)	 For patients who undergo therapy, it is possible to measure the viral load V and to deter-
mine the rate at which their viral load declines. In Ho et al., the data in Figure 3.17 were 
presented for the decrease (on a logarithmic scale) in viral loads of three patients. Using

these data and part (c), explain why it follows that -m must be the approximate slope 
of the nearly linear curve for log V and thereby deduce the revised estimate for the  
average time an infected cell lasts between being invaded and bursting.
(e)	 Check out the recent literature of mathematical models of HIV dynamics in infected 
hosts (try a Google Scholar search) and find out how the estimate of the lifespan of 
infected CD4+ T cells has been improved using more refined ordinary differential 
equation models. (Other models have been used to estimate the lifespan of the free 
virus. Also, models have been developed to track the long-term effects of patients 
undergoing therapy, optimal ways to schedule treatment, and the problems that arise 
when drug resistance develops.)
The dynamics of HIV-1 replication in patients receiving anti-retroviral therapy is a subject of 
continuing investigation and mathematical modeling. It is well known that therapy does not elim-
inate the virus in patients, and it is necessary to continue treatment indefinitely. The reasons are 
complex and connected to the presence of viral reservoirs, which allow the virus population to 
restore if treatment is discontinued. Further investigations of this subject may be found in the fol-
lowing references:

Aquaculture is the art of cultivating the plants and animals indigenous to water. In the example 
considered here, it is assumed that a batch of catfish are raised in a pond. We are interested in 
determining the best time for harvesting the fish so that the cost per pound for raising the fish is 
minimized.
A differential equation describing the growth of fish may be expressed as
(1)	
dW
dt = KWa ,
where W1t2 is the weight of the fish at time t and K and a are empirically determined growth 
constants. The functional form of this relationship is similar to that of the growth models for 
other species. Modeling the growth rate or metabolic rate by a term like Wa is a common assump-
tion. Biologists often refer to equation (1) as the allometric equation. It can be supported by 
plausibility arguments such as growth rate depending on the surface area of the gut (which varies 
like W2>3) or depending on the volume of the animal (which varies like W).
(a)	 Solve equation (1) when a ≠1.
(b)	 The solution obtained in part (a) grows large without bound, but in practice there is 
some limiting maximum weight Wmax for the fish. This limiting weight may be included 
in the differential equation describing growth by inserting a dimensionless variable S 
that can range between 0 and 1 and involves an empirically determined parameter m. 
Namely, we now assume that
(2)	
dW
dt = KWaS ,
	
where S J 1 - 1W>Wmax2m. When m = 1 - a, equation (2) has a closed form solu-
tion. Solve equation (2) when K = 10, a = 3>4, m = 1>4, Wmax = 81 (ounces), and 
W102 = 1 (ounce). The constants are given for t measured in months.
(c)	 The differential equation describing the total cost in dollars C1t2 of raising a fish for t 
months has one constant term K1 that specifies the cost per month (due to costs such as 
interest, depreciation, and labor) and a second constant K2 that multiplies the growth 
rate (because the amount of food consumed by the fish is approximately proportional to 
the growth rate). That is,
(3)	
dC
dt = K1 + K2 dW
dt  .
	
Solve equation (3) when K1 = 0.4, K2 = 0.1, C102 = 1.1 (dollars), and W1t2 is as 
determined in part (b).
(d)	 Sketch the curve obtained in part (b) that represents the weight of the fish as a function 
of time. Next, sketch the curve obtained in part (c) that represents the total cost of rais-
ing the fish as a function of time.
(e)	 To determine the optimal time for harvesting the fish, sketch the ratio C1t2>W1t2. This 
ratio represents the total cost per ounce as a function of time. When this ratio reaches its 
minimum—that is, when the total cost per ounce is at its lowest—it is the optimal time 
to harvest the fish. Determine this optimal time to the nearest month.

An interesting geometric model arises when one tries to determine the path of a pursuer chasing 
its prey. This path is called a curve of pursuit. These problems were analyzed using methods of 
calculus circa 1730 (more than two centuries after Leonardo da Vinci had considered them). The 
simplest problem is to find the curve along which a vessel moves in pursuing another vessel that 
flees along a straight line, assuming the speeds of the two vessels are constant.
Let’s assume that vessel A, traveling at a speed a, is pursuing vessel B, which is traveling at a 
speed b. In addition, assume that vessel A begins (at time t = 0) at the origin and pursues vessel 
B, which begins at the point (1, 0) and travels up the line x = 1. After t hours, vessel A is located 
at the point P = 1x, y2, and vessel B is located at the point Q = 11, bt2 (see Figure 3.18). The 
goal is to describe the locus of points P; that is, to find y as a function of x.
(a)	 Vessel A is pursuing vessel B, so at time t, vessel A must be heading right at vessel B. 
That is, the tangent line to the curve of pursuit at P must pass through the point Q  
(see Figure 3.18). For this to be true, show that
(4)

dx = y - bt
x - 1  .
(b)	 We know the speed at which vessel A is traveling, so we know that the distance it  
travels in time t is at. This distance is also the length of the pursuit curve from 10, 02 to 
1x, y2. Using the arc length formula from calculus, show that

An aircraft flying under the guidance of a nondirectional beacon (a fixed radio transmitter, abbrevi-
ated NDB) moves so that its longitudinal axis always points toward the beacon (see Figure 3.19). 
A pilot sets out toward an NDB from a point at which the wind is at right angles to the initial direc-
tion of the aircraft; the wind maintains this direction. Assume that the wind speed and the speed of 
the aircraft through the air (its “airspeed”) remain constant. (Keep in mind that the latter is differ-
ent from the aircraft’s speed with respect to the ground.)

A perfectly competitive market is made up of many buyers and sellers of an economic product, each 
of whom has no control over the market price. In this model, the overall quantity demanded by 
the buyers of the product is taken to be a function of the price of the product (among other things) 
called the demand function. Similarly, the overall quantity supplied by the sellers of the product is a 
function of the price of the product (among other things) called the supply function. A market is in 
equilibrium at a price where the quantity demanded is just equal to the quantity supplied.
The linear model assumes that the demand and supply functions have the form qd = d0 - d1p 
and qs = -s0 + s1p, respectively, where p is the market price of the product, qd is the associ-
ated quantity demanded, qs is the associated quantity supplied, and d0, d1, s0, and s1 are all posi-
tive constants. The functional forms ensure that the “laws” of downward sloping demand and 
upward sloping supply are being satisfied. It is easy to show that the equilibrium price is p* =  
1d0 + s02>1d1 + s12.
Economists typically assume that markets are in equilibrium and justify this assumption with 
the help of stability arguments. For example, consider the simple price adjustment equation
 dp
dt = l1qd - qs2 , 
where l 7 0 is a constant indicating the speed of adjustments. This follows the intuitive require-
ment that price rises when demand exceeds supply and falls when supply exceeds demand. The 
market equilibrium is said to be globally stable if, for every initial price level p102, the price 
adjustment path p1t2 satisfies p1t2 S  p* as t S  ∞.
(a)	 Find the price adjustment path: Substitute the expressions for qd and qs into the price 
adjustment equation and show that the solution to the resulting differential equation is 
p1t2 = 3p102 - p*4ect + p*, where c = -l1d1 + s12 .
(b)	 Is the market equilibrium globally stable?
Now consider a model that takes into account the expectations of agents. Let the market 
demand and supply functions over time t Ú 0 be given by
qd1t2 = d0 - d1p1t2 + d2p′1t2 and qs1t2 = -s0 + s1p1t2 - s2p′1t2 ,
respectively, where p1t2 is the market price of the product, qd1t2 is the associated quantity 
demanded, qs1t2 is the associated quantity supplied, and d0, d1, d2, s0, s1, and s2 are all positive 
constants. The functional forms ensure that, when faced with an increasing price, demanders

and Time Paths

will tend to purchase more (before prices rise further) while suppliers will tend to offer less (to 
take advantage of the higher prices in the future). Now given the above stability argument, we 
restrict consideration to market clearing time paths p1t2 satisfying qd1t2 = qs1t2, for all t Ú 0, 
and explore the evolution of price over time. We say that the market is in dynamic equilibrium 
if p′1t2 = 0 for all t. It is easy to show that the dynamic equilibrium in this model is given by 
p1t2 = p* for all t, where p* is the market equilibrium price defined above. However, many other 
market clearing time paths are possible.
(c)	 Find a market clearing time path: Equate qd1t2 and qs1t2 and solve the resulting differ-
ential equation p1t2 in terms of its initial value p0 = p102.
(d)	 Is it true that for any market clearing time path we must have p1t2 S  p* as t S  ∞?
(e)	 If the price p1t2 of a product is $5 at t = 0 months and demand and supply functions 
are modeled as qd1t2 = 30 - 2p1t2 + 4p′1t2 and qs1t2 = -20 + p1t2 - 6p′1t2, 
what will be the price after 10 months? As t becomes very large? What is happening to 
p′1t2 and how are the expectations of demanders and suppliers evolving?

(c)	 Show that the improved Euler’s method applied to problem (8) is absolutely stable for 
0 6 lh 6 2.
Multistep Methods.  When multistep numerical methods are used, instability problems may 
arise that cannot be circumvented by simply choosing a sufficiently small step size h. This is 
because multistep methods yield “extraneous solutions,” which may dominate the calculations. 
To see what can happen, consider the two-step method
(10)	
yn+1 = yn-1 + 2hf1xn, yn2 ,  n = 1, 2, c,
for the equation y′ = f1x, y2.
(d)	 Show that for the initial value problem
(11)	
y′ + 2y = 0 ,  y102 = 1 ,
the recurrence formula (10), with xn = nh, becomes
(12)	
yn+1 + 4hyn - yn-1 = 0 .
Equation (12), which is called a difference equation, can be solved by using the fol-
lowing approach. We postulate a solution of the form yn = rn, where r is a constant to be 
determined.
(e)	 Show that substituting yn = rn in (12) leads to the “characteristic equation”
r2 + 4hr - 1 = 0 ,
	
which has roots
r1 = -2h + 21 + 4h2 and r2 = -2h - 21 + 4h2 .
	
By analogy with the theory for second-order differential equations, it can be shown that 
a general solution of (12) is
yn = c1rn
1 + c2rn
2 ,
	
where c1 and c2 are arbitrary constants. Thus, the general solution to the difference 
equation (12) has two independent constants, whereas the differential equation in (11) 
has only one, namely, f1x2 = ce-2x.
(f)	 Show that for each h 7 0,
lim
nS ∞rn
1 = 0 but lim
nS ∞0 rn
20 = ∞ .
	
Hence, the term rn
1 behaves like the solution f1xn2 = e-2xn as n S ∞. However, the 
extraneous solution rn
2 grows large without bound.
(g)	 Applying the scheme of (10) to the initial value problem (11) requires two starting  
values y0, y1. The exact values are y0 = 1, y1 = e-2h. However, regardless of the 
choice of starting values and the size of h, the term c2rn
2 will eventually dominate the 
full solution to the recurrence equation as xn increases. Illustrate this instability tak-
ing y0 = 1, y1 = e-2h, and using a calculator or computer to compute y2, y3, . . . , y100 
from the recurrence formula (12) for h = 0.5 and h = 0.05. (Note: Even if initial con-
ditions are chosen so that c2 = 0, round-off error will inevitably “excite” the extrane-
ous dominant solution.)

Figure 3.20 Period doubling to chaos
G	 Period Doubling and Chaos
In the study of dynamical systems, the phenomena of period doubling and chaos are observed. 
These phenomena can be seen when one uses a numerical scheme to approximate the solution to 
an initial value problem for a nonlinear differential equation such as the following logistic model 
for population growth:
(13)	
dp
dt = 10p11 - p2 ,  p102 = 0.1 .
(See Section 3.2.)
(a)	 Solve the initial value problem (13) and show that p1t2 approaches 1 as t S + ∞.
(b)	 Show that using Euler’s method (see Sections 1.4 and 3.6) with step size h to approxi-
mate the solution to (13) gives
(14)	
pn+1 = 11 + 10h2pn - 110h2p2
n ,  p0 = 0.1 .
(c)	 For h = 0.18, 0.23, 0.25, and 0.3, show that the first 40 iterations of (14) appear to  
(i) converge to 1 when h = 0.18, (ii) jump between 1.18 and 0.69 when h = 0.23,  
(iii) jump between 1.23, 0.54, 1.16, and 0.70 when h = 0.25, and (iv) display no dis-
cernible pattern when h = 0.3.
The transitions from convergence to jumping between two numbers, then four numbers, and 
so on, are called period doubling. The phenomenon displayed when h = 0.3 is referred to as 
chaos. This transition from period doubling to chaos as h increases is frequently observed in 
dynamical systems.
The transition to chaos is nicely illustrated in the bifurcation diagram (see Figure 3.20). This 
diagram is generated for equation (14) as follows. Beginning at h = 0.18, compute the sequence 

Projects for Chapter 3          151
{pn} using (14) and, starting at n = 201, plot the next 30 values—that is, p201, p202, . . . , p230. 
Next, increment h by 0.001 to 0.181 and repeat. Continue this process until h = 0.30. Notice 
how the figure splits from one branch to two, then four, and then finally gives way to chaos.
Our concern is with the instabilities of the numerical procedure when h is not chosen 
small enough. Fortunately, the instability observed for Euler’s method—the period doubling 
and chaos—was immediately recognized because we know that this type of behavior is not 
expected of a solution to the logistic equation. Consequently, if we had tried Euler’s method 
with h = 0.23, 0.25, or 0.3 to solve (13) numerically, we would have realized that h was not 
chosen small enough.
The situation for the classical fourth-order Runge–Kutta method (see Section 3.7) is more 
troublesome. It may happen that for a certain choice of h period doubling occurs, but it is also 
possible that for other choices of h the numerical solution actually converges to a limiting value 
that is not the limiting value for any solution to the logistic equation in (13).
(d)	 Approximate the solution to (13) by computing the first 60 iterations of the classical 
fourth-order Runge–Kutta method using the step size h = 0.3. (Thus, for the subrou-
tine on page 135, input N = 60 and c = 6010.32 = 18.) Repeat with h = 0.325 and  
h = 0.35. Which values of h (if any) do you feel are giving the “correct” approximation 
to the solution? Why?
	
A further discussion of chaos appears in Section 5.8.

Linear Second-Order Equations
CHAPTER 
4 
4.1  Introduction: The Mass–Spring Oscillator
Newton’s second law—force equals mass times acceleration 1F = ma2—is without a doubt 
the most commonly encountered differential equation in practice. It is an ordinary differential 
equation of the second order since acceleration is the second derivative of position 1y2 with 
respect to time 1a = d2y>dt22.
When the second law is applied to a mass–spring oscillator, the resulting motions are com-
mon experiences of everyday life, and we can exploit our familiarity with these vibrations to 
obtain a qualitative description of the solutions of more general second-order equations.
We begin by referring to Figure 4.1, which depicts the mass–spring oscillator. When the 
spring is unstretched and the inertial mass m is still, the system is at equilibrium; we measure 
the coordinate y of the mass by its displacement from the equilibrium position. When the mass 
m is displaced from equilibrium, the spring is stretched or compressed and it exerts a force that 
resists the displacement. For most springs this force is directly proportional to the displace-
ment y and is thus given by
(1)	
Fspring = -ky ,
where the positive constant k is known as the stiffness and the negative sign reflects the oppos-
ing nature of the force. Hooke’s law, as equation (1) is commonly known, is only valid for 
sufficiently small displacements; if the spring is compressed so strongly that the coils press 
against each other, the opposing force obviously becomes much stronger.
A damped mass–spring oscillator consists of a mass m attached to a spring fixed 
at one end, as shown in Figure 4.1. Devise a differential equation that governs 
the motion of this oscillator, taking into account the forces acting on it due to the 
spring elasticity, damping friction, and possible external influences.

Section 4.1    Introduction: The Mass–Spring Oscillator          153
Practically all mechanical systems also experience friction, and for vibrational motion this 
force is usually modeled accurately by a term proportional to velocity:
(2)	
Ffriction = -b dy
dt = -by′ ,
where b 1 Ú02 is the damping coefficient and the negative sign has the same significance as in 
equation (1).
The other forces on the oscillator are usually regarded as external to the system. Although 
they may be gravitational, electrical, or magnetic, commonly the most important external 
forces are transmitted to the mass by shaking the supports holding the system. For the moment 
we lump all the external forces into a single, known function Fext1t2. Newton’s law then pro-
vides the differential equation for the mass–spring oscillator:
 my″ = -ky - by′ + Fext1t2
or
(3)	
my″ + by′ + ky = Fext1t2 .
What do mass–spring motions look like? From our everyday experience with weak 
auto suspensions, musical gongs, and bowls of jelly, we expect that when there is no friction 
1b = 02 or external force, the (idealized) motions would be perpetual vibrations like the ones 
depicted in Figure 4.2. These vibrations resemble sinusoidal functions, with their amplitude 
depending on the initial displacement and velocity. The frequency of the oscillations increases 
for stiffer springs but decreases for heavier masses.
In Section 4.3 we will show how to find these solutions. Example 1 demonstrates a quick 
calculation that confirms our intuitive predictions.

Example 1
Verify that if b = 0 and Fext1t2 = 0, equation (3) has a solution of the form y1t2 = cos vt 
and that the angular frequency v increases with k and decreases with m.
Solution
Under the conditions stated, equation (3) simplifies to
(4)	
my″ + ky = 0 .
The second derivative of y1t2 is -v2 cos vt, and if we insert it into (4), we find
my″ + ky = -mv2 cos vt + k cos vt ,
which is indeed zero if v = 2k>m. This v increases with k and decreases with m, as 
predicted.  ◆

154          Chapter 4    Linear Second-Order Equations
When damping is present, the oscillations die out, and the motions resemble Figure 4.3. 
In Figure 4.3(a) the graph displays a damped oscillation; damping has slowed the frequency, 
and the amplitude appears to diminish exponentially with time. In Figure 4.3(b) the damping is 
so dominant that it has prevented the system from oscillating at all. Devices that are supposed 
to vibrate, like tuning forks or crystal oscillators, behave like Figure 4.3(a), and the damp-
ing effect is usually regarded as an undesirable loss mechanism. Good automotive suspension 
systems, on the other hand, behave like Figure 4.3(b); they exploit damping to suppress the 
oscillations.
The procedures for solving (unforced) mass–spring systems with damping are also 
described in Section 4.3, but as Examples 2 and 3 below show, the calculations are more com-
plex. Example 2 has a relatively low damping coefficient 1b = 62 and illustrates the solu-
tions for the “underdamped” case in Figure 4.3(a). In Example 3 the damping is more severe 
1b = 102, and the solution is “overdamped” as in Figure 4.3(b).

Example 2
Verify that the exponentially damped sinusoid given by y1t2 = e-3t cos 4t is a solution to 
equation (3) if Fext = 0, m = 1, k = 25, and b = 6.
Solution
The derivatives of y are
 y′1t2 = -3e-3t cos 4t - 4e-3t sin 4t ,
y″1t2 = 9e-3t cos 4t + 12e-3t sin 4t + 12e-3t sin 4t - 16e-3t cos 4t
 = -7e-3t cos 4t + 24e-3t sin 4t ,
and insertion into (3) gives
my″ + by′ + ky = 112y″ + 6y′ + 25y
 = -7e-3t cos 4t + 24e-3t sin 4t + 61 -3e-3t cos 4t - 4e-3t sin t2
 + 25e-3t cos 4t
 = 0 .  ◆
Example 3
Verify that the simple exponential function y1t2 = e-5t is a solution to equation (3) if 
Fext = 0, m = 1, k = 25, and b = 10.
Solution
The derivatives of y are y′1t2 = -5e-5t, y″1t2 = 25e-5t and insertion into (3) produces
my″ + by′ + ky = 112y″ + 10y′ + 25y = 25e-5t + 101 -5e-5t2 + 25e-5t = 0 .  ◆
Now if a mass–spring system is driven by an external force that is sinusoidal at the angular 
frequency v, our experiences indicate that although the initial response of the system may be 

Section 4.1    Introduction: The Mass–Spring Oscillator          155
somewhat erratic, eventually it will respond in “sync” with the driver and oscillate at the same 
frequency, as illustrated in Figure 4.4.
Common examples of systems vibrating in synchronization with their drivers are sound sys-
tem speakers, cyclists bicycling over railroad tracks, electronic amplifier circuits, and ocean tides 
(driven by the periodic pull of the moon). However, there is more to the story than is revealed 
above. Systems can be enormously sensitive to the particular frequency v at which they are driven. 
Thus, accurately tuned musical notes can shatter fine crystal, wind-induced vibrations at the right 
(wrong?) frequency can bring down a bridge, and a dripping faucet can cause inordinate headaches. 
These “resonance” responses (for which the responses have maximum amplitudes) may be quite 
destructive, and structural engineers have to be very careful to ensure that their products will not 
resonate with any of the vibrations likely to occur in the operating environment. Radio engineers, on 
the other hand, do want their receivers to resonate selectively to the desired broadcasting channel.
The calculation of these forced solutions is the subject of Sections 4.4 and 4.5. The next 
example illustrates some of the features of synchronous response and resonance.

Solution
We seek solutions of the differential equation
(5)	
y″ + y′ + 25y =  sin Ωt
that are sinusoids in sync with sin Ωt; so let’s try the form y1t2 = A cos Ωt + B sin Ωt. Since
 y′ = -ΩA sin Ωt + ΩB cos Ωt ,
 y″ = -Ω2A cos Ωt - Ω2B sin Ωt ,
we can simply insert these forms into equation (5), collect terms, and match coefficients to 
obtain a solution:
 sin Ωt = y″ + y′ + 25y
 = -Ω2A cos Ωt - Ω2B sin Ωt + 3 -ΩA sin Ωt + ΩB cos Ωt4
 
 +253A cos Ωt + B sin Ωt4
 = 3 -Ω2B - ΩA + 25B4 sin Ωt + 3 -Ω2A + ΩB + 25A4 cos Ωt ,
so
 -ΩA + 1 -Ω2 + 252B = 1
 1 -Ω2 + 252A + ΩB = 0 .

A =

Ω2 + 1Ω2 - 2522 ,  B =

Ω2 + 1Ω2 - 2522 .
Figure 4.5 displays A and B as functions of the driving frequency Ω. A resonance clearly 
occurs around Ω≈5.  ◆
In most of this chapter, we are going to restrict our attention to differential equations of the form
(6)	
ay″ + by′ + cy = f1t2 ,
where y1t2 [or y1x2, or x1t2, etc.] is the unknown function that we seek; a, b, and c are con-
stants; and f1t2 [or f1x2] is a known function. The proper nomenclature for (6) is the linear, 
second-order ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients. In Sections 4.7 and 4.8, 
we will generalize our focus to equations with nonconstant coefficients, as well as to nonlinear 
equations. However, (6) is an excellent starting point because we are able to obtain explicit 
solutions and observe, in concrete form, the theoretical properties that are predicted for more 
general equations. For motivation of the mathematical procedures and theory for solving (6), 
we will consistently compare it with the mass–spring paradigm:

(b)	 Sketch graphs of the coefficients A and B, as func-
tions of Ω, for m = 1, b = 0.1, and k = 25.
	
(c)	 Now set b = 0 in your formulas for A and B and 
resketch the graphs in part (b), with m = 1, and 
k = 25. What happens at Ω= 5? Notice that the 
amplitudes of the synchronous solutions grow with-
out bound as Ω approaches 5.
	
(d)	 Show directly, by substituting the form A cos Ωt + 
B sin Ωt into equation (7), that when b = 0 there 
are no synchronous solutions if Ω= 2k>m.
	
(e)	 Verify that 12mΩ2-1t sin Ωt solves equation (7) 
when b = 0 and Ω= 2k>m. Notice that this 
nonsynchronous solution grows in time, without 
bound.
Clearly one cannot neglect damping in analyzing an 
oscillator forced at resonance, because otherwise the 
solutions, as shown in part (e), are nonphysical. This 
behavior will be studied later in this chapter.
We begin our study of the linear second-order constant-coefficient differential equation
(1)	
ay″ + by′ + cy = f1t2  1a ≠02
with the special case where the function f1t2 is zero:
(2)	
ay″ + by′ + cy = 0 .
This case arises when we consider mass–spring oscillators vibrating freely—that is, without 
external forces applied. Equation (2) is called the homogeneous form of equation (1); f1t2 is 
the “nonhomogeneity” in (1). (This nomenclature is not related to the way we used the term for 
first-order equations in Section 2.6.)
A look at equation (2) tells us that a solution of (2) must have the property that its second 
derivative is expressible as a linear combination of its first and zeroth derivatives.† This sug-
gests that we try to find a solution of the form y = ert, since derivatives of ert are just constants 
times ert. If we substitute y = ert into (2), we obtain
 ar2 ert + brert + cert = 0 ,
 ert1ar2 + br + c2 = 0 .
4.2  Homogeneous Linear Equations: The General Solution
†The zeroth derivative of a function is the function itself.

158          Chapter 4    Linear Second-Order Equations
Because ert is never zero, we can divide by it to obtain
(3)	
ar2 + br + c = 0 .
Consequently, y = ert is a solution to (2) if and only if r satisfies equation (3). Equation (3) is 
called the auxiliary equation (also known as the characteristic equation) associated with the 
homogeneous equation (2).
Now the auxiliary equation is just a quadratic, and its roots are
r1 = -b + 2b2 - 4ac
2a
  and  r2 = -b - 2b2 - 4ac
2a
 .
When the discriminant, b2 - 4ac, is positive, the roots r1 and r2 are real and distinct. If 
b2 - 4ac = 0, the roots are real and equal. And when b2 - 4ac 6 0, the roots are complex 
conjugate numbers. We consider the first two cases in this section; the complex case is deferred 
to Section 4.3.
Example 1
Find a pair of solutions to
(4)	
y″ + 5y′ - 6y = 0 .
Solution
The auxiliary equation associated with (4) is
r2 + 5r - 6 = 1r - 121r + 62 = 0 ,
which has the roots r1 = 1, r2 = -6. Thus, et and e-6t are solutions.  ◆
Notice that the identically zero function, y1t2 K 0, is always a solution to (2). Further-
more, when we have a pair of solutions y11t2 and y21t2 to this equation, as in Example 1, we 
can construct an infinite number of other solutions by forming linear combinations:
(5)	
y1t2 = c1 y11t2 + c2 y21t2
for any choice of the constants c1 and c2. The fact that (5) is a solution to (2) can be seen by 
direct substitution and rearrangement:
ay″ + by′ + cy = a1c1y1 + c2y22″ + b1c1y1 + c2y22′ + c1c1y1 + c2y22

 = c11ay>
1 + by=
1 + cy12 + c21ay>
2 + by=
2 + cy22
 = 0 + 0 .
The two “degrees of freedom” c1 and c2 in the combination (5) suggest that solutions to 
the differential equation (2) can be found meeting additional conditions, such as the initial 
conditions for the first-order equations in Chapter 1. But the presence of c1 and c2 leads one 
to anticipate that two such conditions, rather than just one, can be imposed. This is consistent 
with the mass–spring interpretation of equation (2), since predicting the motion of a mechani-
cal system requires knowledge not only of the forces but also of the initial position y102 and 
velocity y′102 of the mass. A typical initial value problem for these second-order equations is 
given in the following example.
Example 2
Solve the initial value problem

y″ + 2y′ - y = 0 ;    y102 = 0 ,  y′102 = -1 .

Section 4.2    Homogeneous Linear Equations: The General Solution          159
Solution
We will first find a pair of solutions as in the previous example. Then we will adjust the con-
stants c1 and c2 in (5) to obtain a solution that matches the initial conditions on y102 and y′102. 
The auxiliary equation is
r2 + 2r - 1 = 0 .
Using the quadratic formula, we find that the roots of this equation are
r1 = -1 + 22  and  r2 = -1 - 22 .
Consequently, the given differential equation has solutions of the form
(7)	
y1t2 = c1e1-1+ 222t + c2e1-1- 222t .
To find the specific solution that satisfies the initial conditions given in (6), we first differentiate 
y as given in (7), then plug y and y′ into the initial conditions of (6). This gives
 y102 = c1e0 + c2e0 ,
 y′102 = 1 -1 + 222c1e0 + 1 -1 - 222c2e0 ,
or
 0 = c1 + c2 ,
 -1 = 1 -1 + 222c1 + 1 -1 - 222c2 .
Solving this system yields c1 = - 22>4 and c2 = 22>4. Thus,
y1t2 = - 22

is the desired solution.  ◆
To gain more insight into the significance of the two-parameter solution form (5), we need 
to look at some of the properties of the second-order equation (2). First of all, there is an 
existence-and-uniqueness theorem for solutions to (2); it is somewhat like the corresponding 
Theorem 1 in Section 1.2 for first-order equations but updated to reflect the fact that two ini-
tial conditions are appropriate for second-order equations. As motivation for the theorem, sup-
pose the differential equation (2) were really easy, with b = 0 and c = 0. Then y″ = 0 would 
merely say that the graph of y1t2 is simply a straight line, so it is uniquely determined by 
specifying a point on the line,
(8)	
y1t02 = Y0 ,
and the slope of the line,
(9)	
y′1t02 = Y1 .
Theorem 1 states that conditions (8) and (9) suffice to determine the solution uniquely for the 
more general equation (2).
Existence and Uniqueness: Homogeneous Case
Theorem 1.	
For any real numbers a 1 ≠02, b, c, t0, Y0, and Y1, there exists a unique 
solution to the initial value problem
(10)	 ay″ + by′ + cy = 0 ;    y1t02 = Y0 ,  y′1t02 = Y1 .
The solution is valid for all t in 1 - ∞, + ∞2.

160          Chapter 4    Linear Second-Order Equations
Note in particular that if a solution y1t2 and its derivative vanish simultaneously at a 
point t0 1i.e., Y0 = Y1 = 02, then y1t2 must be the identically zero solution.
In this section and the next, we will construct explicit solutions to (10), so the question of 
existence of a solution is not really an issue. It is extremely valuable to know, however, that the 
solution is unique. The proof of uniqueness is rather different from anything else in this chap-
ter, so we defer it to Chapter 13.†
Now we want to use this theorem to show that, given two solutions y11t2 and y21t2 to 
equation (2), we can always find values of c1 and c2 so that c1y11t2 + c2y21t2 meets specified 
initial conditions in (10) and therefore is the (unique) solution to the initial value problem. But 
we need to be a little more precise; if, for example, y21t2 is simply the identically zero solu-
tion, then c1y11t2 + c2y21t2 = c1y11t2 actually has only one constant and cannot be expected 
to satisfy two conditions. Furthermore, if y21t2 is simply a constant multiple of y11t2—say, 
y21t2 = ky11t2—then again c1y11t2 + c2y21t2 = 1c1 + kc22y11t2 = Cy11t2 actually has 
only one constant. The condition we need is linear independence.
Linear Independence of Two Functions
Definition 1.	 A pair of functions y11t2 and y21t2 is said to be linearly independent on 
the interval I if and only if neither of them is a constant multiple of the other on all  
of I.†† We say that y1 and y2 are linearly dependent on I if one of them is a constant 
multiple of the other on all of I.
Representation of Solutions to Initial Value Problem
Theorem 2.	
If y11t2 and y21t2 are any two solutions to the differential equation (2) 
that are linearly independent on 1 - ∞, ∞2, then unique constants c1 and c2 can always 
be found so that c1y11t2 + c2y21t2 satisfies the initial value problem (10) on 1 - ∞, ∞2.
The proof of Theorem 2 will be easy once we establish the following technical lemma.
†All references to Chapters 11–13 refer to the expanded text, Fundamentals of Differential Equations and Boundary 
Value Problems, 7th ed.
††This definition will be generalized to three or more functions in Problem 35 and Chapter 6.
A Condition for Linear Dependence of Solutions
Lemma 1.	
For any real numbers a 1 ≠02, b, and c, if y11t2 and y21t2 are any two 
solutions to the differential equation (2) on 1 - ∞, ∞2 and if the equality
(11)	
y11t2y=
21t2 - y=
11t2y21t2 = 0
holds at any point t, then y1 and y2 are linearly dependent on 1 - ∞, ∞2. (The expres-
sion on the left-hand side of (11) is called the Wronskian of y1 and y2 at the point t; see 
Problem 34 on page 164.)

Section 4.2    Homogeneous Linear Equations: The General Solution          161
Proof of Lemma 1.  Case 1. If y11t2 ≠0, then let k equal y21t2>y11t2 and consider 
the solution to (2) given by y1t2 = ky11t2. It satisfies the same “initial conditions” at t = t as 
does y21t2:
y1t2 = y21t2
y11t2 y11t2 = y21t2 ;    y′1t2 = y21t2
y11t2 y=
11t2 = y=
21t2 ,
where the last equality follows from (11). By uniqueness, y21t2 must be the same function as 
ky11t2 on I.
Case 2. If y11t2 = 0 but y=
11t2 ≠0, then (11) implies y21t2 = 0. Let k = y=
21t2>y=
11t2. 
Then the solution to (2) given by y1t2 = ky11t2 (again) satisfies the same “initial conditions” 
at t = t as does y21t2:
y1t2 = y=
21t2
y=
11t2 y11t2 = 0 = y21t2 ;        y′1t2 = y=
21t2
y=
11t2 y=
11t2 = y=
21t2 .
By uniqueness, then, y21t2 = ky11t2 on I.
Case 3. If y11t2 = y=
11t2 = 0, then y11t2 is a solution to the differential equation (2) 
satisfying the initial conditions y11t2 = y=
11t2 = 0; but y1t2 K 0 is the unique solution to 
this initial value problem. Thus, y11t2 K 0 3and is a constant multiple of y21t24.  ◆
Proof of Theorem 2.  We already know that y1t2 = c1y11t2 + c2y21t2 is a solution to 
(2); we must show that c1 and c2 can be chosen so that
y1t02 = c1y11t02 + c2y21t02 = Y0
and
y′1t02 = c1y=
11t02 + c2y=
21t02 = Y1 .
But simple algebra shows these equations have the solution†
c1 =
Y0y=
21t02 - Y1y21t02
y11t02y=
21t02 - y=
11t02y21t02 and c2 =
Y1y11t02 - Y0y=
11t02
y11t02y=
21t02 - y=
11t02y21t02
as long as the denominator is nonzero, and the technical lemma assures us that this condition 
is met.  ◆
Now we can honestly say that if y1 and y2 are linearly independent solutions to (2) on 
1 - ∞, + ∞2, then (5) is a general solution, since any solution yg1t2 of (2) can be expressed in 
this form; simply pick c1 and c2 so that c1y1 + c2y2 matches the value and the derivative of yg at any 
point. By uniqueness, c1y1 + c2y2 and yg have to be the same function. See Figure 4.6 on page 162.
How do we find a general solution for the differential equation (2)? We already know the 
answer if the roots of the auxiliary equation (3) are real and distinct because clearly y11t2 = er1t 
is not a constant multiple of y21t2 = er2t if r1 ≠r2.
†To solve for c1, for example, multiply the first equation by y=
21t02 and the second by y21t02 and subtract.
Distinct Real Roots
If the auxiliary equation (3) has distinct real roots r1 and r2, then both y11t2 = er1t and 
y21t2 = er2t are solutions to (2) and y1t2 = c1er1t + c2er2t is a general solution.

162          Chapter 4    Linear Second-Order Equations
When the roots of the auxiliary equation are equal, we only get one nontrivial solution, 
y1 = ert. To satisfy two initial conditions, y1t02 and y′1t02, then we will need a second, lin-
early independent solution. The following rule is the key to finding a second solution.
y
t
t0
y(t0)
Slope y9(t0)
(Can’t both be
solutions)
Figure 4.6 y1t02, y′1t02 determine a unique solution.
Repeated Root
If the auxiliary equation (3) has a repeated root r, then both y11t2 = ert and y21t2 = tert 
are solutions to (2), and y1t2 = c1ert + c2tert is a general solution.
We illustrate this result before giving its proof.
Example 3
Find a solution to the initial value problem
(12)	
y″ + 4y′ + 4y = 0 ;    y102 = 1 ,   y′102 = 3 .
Solution
The auxiliary equation for (12) is
r2 + 4r + 4 = 1r + 222 = 0 .
Because r = -2 is a double root, the rule says that (12) has solutions y1 = e-2t and y2 = te-2t. 
Let’s confirm that y21t2 is a solution:
 y21t2 = te-2t ,
 y′21t2 = e-2t - 2te-2t ,
 y″21t2 = -2e-2t - 2e-2t + 4te-2t = -4e-2t + 4te-2t ,
y″2 + 4y′2 + 4y2 = -4e-2t + 4te-2t + 41e-2t - 2te-2t2 + 4te-2t = 0 .
Further observe that e-2t and te-2t are linearly independent since neither is a constant multiple 
of the other on 1 - ∞, ∞2. Finally, we insert the general solution y1t2 = c1e-2t + c2te-2t into 
the initial conditions,
 y102 = c1e0 + c2102e0 = 1 ,
 y′102 = -2c1e0 + c2e0 - 2c2102e0 = 3 ,
and solve to find c1 = 1, c2 = 5. Thus y = e-2t + 5te-2t is the desired solution.  ◆

Section 4.2    Homogeneous Linear Equations: The General Solution          163
Why is it that y21t2 = tert is a solution to the differential equation (2) when r is a double 
root (and not otherwise)? In later chapters we will see a theoretical justification of this rule in 
very general circumstances; for present purposes, though, simply note what happens if we sub-
stitute y2 into the differential equation (2):
y21t2 = tert ,
y=
21t2 = ert + rtert ,
y″21t2 = rert + rert + r2tert = 2rert + r2tert ,
ay>
2 + by=
2 + cy2 = 32ar + b4ert + 3ar2 + br + c4tert .
Now if r is a root of the auxiliary equation (3), the expression in the second brackets is zero. 
However, if r is a double root, the expression in the first brackets is zero also:
(13)	
r = -b { 2b2 - 4ac
2a
= -b { 102
2a
 ;
hence, 2ar + b = 0 for a double root. In such a case, then, y2 is a solution.
The method we have described for solving homogeneous linear second-order equations 
with constant coefficients applies to any order (even first-order) homogeneous linear equa-
tions with constant coefficients. We give a detailed treatment of such higher-order equations 
in Chapter 6. For now, we will be content to illustrate the method by means of an example. 
We remark briefly that a homogeneous linear nth-order equation has a general solution of the 
form
y1t2 = c1y11t2 + c2y21t2 + g + cnyn1t2 ,
where the individual solutions yi1t2 are “linearly independent.” By this we mean that no yi is 
expressible as a linear combination of the others; see Problem 35 on page 164.
Example 4
Find a general solution to
(14)	
y‴ + 3y″ - y′ - 3y = 0 .
Solution
If we try to find solutions of the form y = ert, then, as with second-order equations, we are led 
to finding roots of the auxiliary equation
(15)	
r3 + 3r2 - r - 3 = 0 .
We observe that r = 1 is a root of the above equation, and dividing the polynomial on the left-
hand side of (15) by r - 1 leads to the factorization
1r - 121r2 + 4r + 32 = 1r - 121r + 121r + 32 = 0 .
Hence, the roots of the auxiliary equation are 1, -1, and -3, and so three solutions of (14) 
are et, e-t, and e-3t. The linear independence of these three exponential functions is proved in 
Problem 36. A general solution to (14) is then
(16)	
y1t2 = c1et + c2e-t + c3e-3t .  ◆
So far we have seen only exponential solutions to the linear second-order constant coef-
ficient equation. You may wonder where the vibratory solutions that govern mass–spring oscil-
lators are. In the next section, it will be seen that they arise when the solutions to the auxiliary 
equation are complex.

26.	 Boundary Value Problems.  When the values of a solu-
tion to a differential equation are specified at two differ-
ent points, these conditions are called boundary condi-
tions. (In contrast, initial conditions specify the values of 
a function and its derivative at the same point.) The pur-
pose of this exercise is to show that for boundary value 
problems there is no existence–uniqueness theorem that 
is analogous to Theorem 1. Given that every solution to
(17)	
y″ + y = 0
is of the form
y1t2 = c1 cos t + c2 sin t ,
where c1 and c2 are arbitrary constants, show that
	
(a)	 There is a unique solution to (17) that satisfies the

is called the Wronskian† of y1 and y2. This function plays 
a crucial role in the proof of Theorem 2.

mogeneous equation ay″ + by′ + cy = 0 (with 
a ≠0) on an open interval I. Prove that y11t2 and 
y21t2 are linearly independent on I if and only if 
their Wronskian is never zero on I. [Hint: This is just 
a reformulation of Lemma 1.]
	
(c)	 Show that if y11t2 and y21t2 are any two differen-
tiable functions that are linearly dependent on I, then 
their Wronskian is identically zero on I.
35.	 Linear Dependence of Three Functions.  Three func-
tions y11t2, y21t2, and y31t2 are said to be linearly depen-
dent on an interval I if, on I, at least one of these func-
tions is a linear combination of the remaining two [e.g., 
if y11t2 = c1y21t2 + c2y31t2]. Equivalently (compare 
Problem 33), y1, y2, and y3 are linearly dependent on I if 
there exist constants C1, C2, and C3, not all zero, such that
C1y11t2 + C2y21t2 + C3y31t2 = 0    for all t in I.
Otherwise, we say that these functions are linearly inde-
pendent on I.

for all t. Divide by er2t to get e1r1-r22t = c1 + c2e1r3-r22t 
and then differentiate to deduce that e1r1-r22t and e1r3-r22t 
are linearly dependent, which is a contradiction. (Why?)]

46.	 One way to define hyperbolic functions is by means of 
differential equations. Consider the equation y″ - y = 0. 
The hyperbolic cosine, cosh t, is defined as the solution 
of this equation subject to the initial values: y 102 = 1 
and y′102 = 0. The hyperbolic sine, sinh t, is defined as 
the solution of this equation subject to the initial values:

The simple harmonic equation y″ + y = 0, so called because of its relation to the fundamental

ever, that the auxiliary equation associated with the harmonic equation is r2 + 1 = 0, which 
has imaginary roots r = {i, where i denotes 2-1.† In the previous section, we expressed the 
solutions to a linear second-order equation with constant coefficients in terms of exponential 
functions. It would appear, then, that one might be able to attribute a meaning to the forms eit 
and e-it and that these “functions” should be related to cos t and sin t. This matchup is accom-
plished by Euler’s formula, which is discussed in this section.

 .
As in the previous section, we would like to assert that the functions er1t and er2t are solutions to 
the equation (2). This is in fact the case, but before we can proceed, we need to address some 
fundamental questions. For example, if r1 = a + ib is a complex number, what do we mean by 
the expression e1a+ib2t? If we assume that the law of exponents applies to complex numbers, then
(4)	
e1a+ib2t = eat+ibt = eateibt .
We now need only clarify the meaning of eibt.
For this purpose, let’s assume that the Maclaurin series for ez is the same for complex 
numbers z as it is for real numbers. Observing that i2 = -1, then for u real we have
 eiu = 1 + 1iu2 + 1iu22
2!

n!

 = 1 + iu - u2
2! - iu3

4! + iu5
5! + g
 = a1 - u2
2! + u4
4! + gb + iau - u3
3! + u5
5! + gb .
Now recall the Maclaurin series for cos u and sin u:
 cos u = 1 - u2
2! + u4
4! + g ,
 sin u = u - u3
3! + u5
5! + g .
Recognizing these expansions in the proposed series for eiu, we make the identification

eiU = cos U + i sin U ,
which is known as Euler’s formula.†
When Euler’s formula (with u = bt) is used in equation (4), we find
(6)	
e1a+ib2t = eat1cos bt + i sin bt2 ,
which expresses the complex function e1a+ib2t in terms of familiar real functions. Having made 
sense out of e1a+ib2t, we can now show (see Problem 30 on page 172) that

 e1a+ib2t = 1a + ib2e1a+ib2t ,

Analysin Infinitorum (1748).

Section 4.3    Auxiliary Equations with Complex Roots          167
and, with the choices of a and b as given in (3), the complex function e1a+ib2t is indeed a solu-
tion to equation (2), as is e1a-ib2t, and a general solution is given by
(8)	
y1t2 = c1e1a+ib2t + c2e1a-ib2t
 = c1eat1cos bt + i sin bt2 + c2eat1cos bt - i sin bt2 .
Example 1 shows that in general the constants c1 and c2 that go into (8), for a specific 
initial value problem, are complex.
Example 1
Use the general solution (8) to solve the initial value problem
y″ + 2y′ + 2y = 0 ;   y102 = 0,  y′102 = 2  .
Solution
The auxiliary equation is r2 + 2r + 2 = 0, which has roots
r = -224 - 8
2
= -1 { i .
Hence, with a = -1, b = 1, a general solution is given by
y1t2 = c1e-t1 cos t + i sin t2 + c2e-t1 cos t - i sin t2 .
For initial conditions we have
 y102 = c1e01 cos 0 + i sin 02 + c2e01 cos 0 - i sin 02 = c1 + c2 = 0 ,
 y′102 = -c1e01 cos 0 + i sin 02 + c1e01 - sin 0 + i cos 02
 
-c2e01 cos 0 - i sin 02 + c2e01 - sin 0 - i cos 02
 = 1 -1 + i2c1 + 1 -1 - i2c2
 = 2 .
As a result, c1 = -i, c2 = i, and y1t2 = -ie-t1 cos t + i sin t2 + ie-t1 cos t - i sin t2, or 
simply 2e-t sin t. ◆
The final form of the answer to Example 1 suggests that we should seek an alternative pair 
of solutions to the differential equation (2) that don’t require complex arithmetic, and we now 
turn to that task.
In general, if z1t2 is a complex-valued function of the real variable t, we can write  
z1t2 = u1t2 + iv1t2, where u1t2 and v1t2 are real-valued functions. The derivatives of z1t2 
are then given by
dz
dt = du
dt + i dv
dt ,   d2z
dt2 = d2u
dt2 + i d2v
dt2  .
With the following lemma, we show that the complex-valued solution e1a+ib2t gives rise to two 
linearly independent real-valued solutions.
Real Solutions Derived from Complex Solutions
Lemma 2.	
Let z1t2 = u1t2 + iv1t2 be a solution to equation (2), where a, b, and 
c are real numbers. Then, the real part u1t2 and the imaginary part v1t2 are real-valued 
solutions of (2).†
†It will be clear from the proof that this property holds for any linear homogeneous differential equation having real-
valued coefficients.

168          Chapter 4    Linear Second-Order Equations
Proof.  By assumption, az″ + bz′ + cz = 0, and hence
 a1u″ + iv″2 + b1u′ + iv′2 + c1u + iv2 = 0 ,
 1au″ + bu′ + cu2 + i1av″ + bv′ + cv2 = 0 .
But a complex number is zero if and only if its real and imaginary parts are both zero. Thus, 
we must have
au″ + bu′ + cu = 0    and    av″ + bv′ + cv = 0 ,
which means that both u1t2and v1t2 are real-valued solutions of (2).  ◆
When we apply Lemma 2 to the solution
e1a+ib2t = eat cos bt + ieat sin bt ,
we obtain the following.
Complex Conjugate Roots
If the auxiliary equation has complex conjugate roots a { ib, then two linearly  
independent solutions to (2) are
eat cos bt  and  eat sin bt ,
and a general solution is
(9)	
y1t2 = c1eAt cos Bt + c2eAt sin Bt ,
where c1 and c2 are arbitrary constants.
In the preceding discussion, we glossed over some important details concerning complex 
numbers and complex-valued functions. In particular, further analysis is required to justify the 
use of the law of exponents, Euler’s formula, and even the fact that the derivative of ert is rert 
when r is a complex constant.† If you feel uneasy about our conclusions, we encourage you to 
substitute the expression in (9) into equation (2) to verify that it is, indeed, a solution.
You may also be wondering what would have happened if we had worked with the func-
tion e1a-ib2t instead of e1a+ib2t. We leave it as an exercise to verify that e1a-ib2t gives rise to the 
same general solution (9). Indeed, the sum of these two complex solutions, divided by two, 
gives the first real-valued solution, while their difference, divided by 2i, gives the second.
†For a detailed treatment of these topics see, for example, Fundamentals of Complex Analysis, 3rd ed., by E. B. Saff 
and A. D. Snider (Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, New Jersey, 2003).

= -2 { 2-12

Section 4.3    Auxiliary Equations with Complex Roots          169
Hence, with a = -1, b = 23, a general solution for (10) is
y1t2 = c1e-t cos1 23 t2 + c2e-t sin1 23 t2 .  ◆
When the auxiliary equation has complex conjugate roots, the (real) solutions oscillate 
between positive and negative values. This type of behavior is observed in vibrating springs.
Example 3
In Section 4.1 we discussed the mechanics of the mass–spring oscillator (Figure 4.1,  
page 152), and we saw how Newton’s second law implies that the position y1t2 of the mass m 
is governed by the second-order differential equation
(11)	
my″1t2 + by′1t2 + ky1t2 = 0 ,
where the terms are physically identified as
3inertia4y″ + 3damping4y′ + 3stiffness4y = 0 .
Determine the equation of motion for a spring system when m = 36 kg, b = 12 kg/sec (which 
is equivalent to 12 N-sec/m), k = 37 kg/sec2, y102 = 0.7 m, and y′102 = 0.1 m/sec. After 
how many seconds will the mass first cross the equilibrium point?
Solution
The equation of motion is given by y1t2, the solution of the initial value problem for the speci-
fied values of m, b, k, y102, and y′102. That is, we seek the solution to
(12)	
36y″ + 12y′ + 37y = 0 ;  y102 = 0.7 , y′102 = 0.1 .
The auxiliary equation for (12) is
36r2 + 12r + 37 = 0 ,
which has roots
r =
-12 { 2144 - 413621372
72
= -12 { 1221 - 37
72
= - 1
6 { i .
Hence, with a = -1>6, b = 1, the displacement y1t2 can be expressed in the form
(13)	
y1t2 = c1e-t>6 cos t + c2e-t>6 sin t .
We can find c1 and c2 by substituting y1t2 and y′1t2 into the initial conditions given in (12). 
Differentiating (13), we get a formula for y′1t2:
y′1t2 = a - c1
6 + c2be-t>6cos t + a -c1 - c2
6 be-t>6sin t .
Substituting into the initial conditions now results in the system
 c1 = 0.7 ,
- c1
6 + c2 = 0.1 .
Upon solving, we find c1 = 0.7 and c2 = 1.3>6. With these values, the equation of motion 
becomes
y1t2 = 0.7e-t>6 cos t + 1.3
6
 e-t>6 sin t .

170          Chapter 4    Linear Second-Order Equations
To determine the times when the mass will cross the equilibrium point, we set y1t2 = 0 
and solve for t:
0 = y1t2 = 0.7e-t>6 cos t + 1.3
6 e-t>6 sin t = 1cos t210.7e-t>6 + 1.3
6 e-t>6 tan t2 .
But y1t2 is not zero for cos t = 0, so only the zeros of the second factor are pertinent; that is,
tan t = -4.2
1.3 .
A quick glance at the graph of tan t reveals that the first positive t for which this is true lies 
between p>2 and p. Since the arctangent function takes only values between -p>2 and p>2, 
the appropriate adjustment is
t = arctan1 -4.2
1.3 2 + p ≈1.87 seconds .  ◆
From Example 3 we see that any second-order constant-coefficient differential equation 
ay″ + by′ + cy = 0 can be interpreted as describing a mass–spring system with mass a, damp-
ing coefficient b, spring stiffness c, and displacement y, if these constants make sense physi-
cally; that is, if a is positive and b and c are nonnegative. From the discussion in Section 4.1, 
then, we expect on physical grounds to see damped oscillatory solutions in such a case. This is 
consistent with the display in equation (9). With a = m and c = k, the exponential decay rate 
a equals -b>12m2, and the angular frequency b equals 24mk - b2>12m2, by equation (3).
It is a little surprising, then, that the solutions to the equation y″ + 4y′ + 4y = 0 do 
not oscillate; the general solution was shown in Example 3 of Section 4.2 (page 162) to be 
c1e-2t + c2te-2t. The physical significance of this is simply that when the damping coefficient 
b is too high, the resulting friction prevents the mass from oscillating. Rather than overshoot 
the spring’s equilibrium point, it merely settles in lazily. This could happen if a light mass on a 
weak spring were submerged in a viscous fluid.
From the above formula for the oscillation frequency b, we can see that the oscillations 
will not occur for b 7 24mk. This overdamping phenomenon is discussed in more detail in 
Section 4.9.
It is extremely enlightening to contemplate the predictions of the mass–spring analogy 
when the coefficients b and c in the equation ay″ + by′ + cy = 0 are negative.
Example 4
Interpret the equation
(14)	
36y″ - 12y′ + 37y = 0
in terms of the mass–spring system.
Solution
Equation (14) is a minor alteration of equation (12) in Example 3; the auxiliary equation 
36r2 - 12r + 37 has roots r = 1 +21
6 { i. Thus, its general solution becomes
(15)	
y1t2 = c1e+t>6 cos t + c2e+t>6 sin t .
Comparing equation (14) with the mass–spring model
(16)	
3inertia4y″ + 3damping4y′ + 3stiffness4y = 0 ,
we have to envision a negative damping coefficient b = -12, giving rise to a friction force 
Ffriction = -by′ that imparts energy to the system instead of draining it. The increase in energy 
over time must then reveal itself in oscillations of ever-greater amplitude–precisely in accor-
dance with formula (15), for which a typical graph is drawn in Figure 4.7.  ◆

Figure 4.7 Solution graph for Example 4
Example 5
Interpret the equation
(17)	
y″ + 5y′ - 6y = 0
in terms of the mass–spring system.
Solution
Comparing the given equation with (16), we have to envision a spring with a negative stiff-
ness k = -6. What does this mean? As the mass is moved away from the spring’s equilib-
rium point, the spring repels the mass farther with a force Fspring = -ky that intensifies as the 
­displacement increases. Clearly the spring must “exile” the mass to (plus or minus) infinity, 
and we expect all solutions y1t2 to approach {∞ as t increases (except for the equilibrium 
solution y1t2 K 0).
In fact, in Example 1 of Section 4.2, we showed the general solution to equation (17) to be
(18)	
c1et + c2e-6t .
Indeed, if we examine the solutions y1t2 that start with a unit displacement y102 = 1 and 
velocity y′102 = v0, we find
(19)	
y1t2 = 6 + v0
7
 et + 1 - v0
7
 e-6t ,
and the plots in Figure 4.8 on page 172 confirm our prediction that all (nonequilibrium) solu-
tions diverge—except for the one with v0 = -6.
What is the physical significance of this isolated bounded solution? Evidently, if the mass 
is given an initial inwardly directed velocity of -6, it has barely enough energy to overcome 
the effect of the spring banishing it to + ∞ but not enough energy to cross the equilibrium point 
(and get pushed to - ∞). So it asymptotically approaches the (extremely delicate) equilibrium 
position y = 0.  ◆
In Section 4.8, we will see that taking further liberties with the mass–spring interpretation 
enables us to predict qualitative features of more complicated equations.
Throughout this section we have assumed that the coefficients a, b, and c in the differen-
tial equation were real numbers. If we now allow them to be complex constants, then the roots  

172          Chapter 4    Linear Second-Order Equations
r1, r2 of the auxiliary equation (1) are, in general, also complex but not necessarily conjugates 
of each other. When r1 ≠r2, a general solution to equation (2) still has the form
y1t2 = c1er1t + c2er2t ,
but c1 and c2 are now arbitrary complex-valued constants, and we have to resort to the clumsy 
calculations of Example 1.
We also remark that a complex differential equation can be regarded as a system of two 
real differential equations since we can always work separately with its real and imaginary 
parts. Systems are discussed in Chapters 5 and 9.

tion to a nonhomogeneous linear equation with constant coefficients
(1)	
ay″ + by′ + cy = f1t2, 
when the nonhomogeneity f1t2 is a single term of a special type. Our experience in Section 4.3 
indicates that (1) will have an infinite number of solutions. For the moment we are content to find 
one particular solution. To motivate the procedure, let’s first look at a few instructive examples.
4.4  Nonhomogeneous Equations:  
the Method of Undetermined Coefficients
Example 1
Find a particular solution to
(2)	
y″ + 3y′ + 2y = 3t .
Solution
We need to find a function y1t2 such that the combination y″ + 3y′ + 2y is a linear function of 
t—namely, 3t. Now what kind of function y “ends up” as a linear function after having its zeroth, 
first, and second derivatives combined? One immediate answer is: another linear function. So we 
might try y11t2 = At and attempt to match up y>
1 + 3y=
1 + 2y1 with 3t.
Perhaps you can see that this won’t work: y1 = At, y=
1 = A and y>
1 = 0 gives us
y>
1 + 3y=
1 + 2y1 = 3A + 2At , 
and for this to equal 3t, we require both that A = 0 and A = 3>2. We’ll have better luck if we 
append a constant term to the trial function: y21t2 = At + B. Then y=
2 = A, y>
2 = 0, and
y>
2 + 3y=
2 + 2y2 = 3A + 21At + B2 = 2At + 13A + 2B2 , 
which successfully matches up with 3t if 2A = 3 and 3A + 2B = 0. Solving this system gives 
A = 3>2 and B = -9>4. Thus, the function
y21t2 = 3
2 t - 9
4
is a solution to (2).  ◆
Example 1 suggests the following method for finding a particular solution to the equation
ay″ + by′ + cy = Ctm, m = 0, 1, 2, c;
namely, we guess a solution of the form
yp1t2 = Amtm + g + A1t + A0 ,
with undetermined coefficients Aj, and match the corresponding powers of t in ay″ + by′ + cy 
with Ctm.† This procedure involves solving m + 1 linear equations in the m + 1 unknowns 
†In this case the coefficient of tk in ay″ + by′ + cy will be zero for k ≠m and C for k = m.

A0, A1, c, Am, and hopefully they have a solution. The technique is called the method of 
undetermined coefficients. Note that, as Example 1 demonstrates, we must retain all the pow-
ers tm, tm-1, c, t1, t0 in the trial solution even though they are not present in the nonhomoge-
neity f1t2.
Example 2
Find a particular solution to
(3)	
y″ + 3y′ + 2y = 10e3t .
Solution
We guess yp1t2 = Ae3t because then y=
p and y>
p will retain the same exponential form:
y>
p + 3y=
p + 2yp = 9Ae3t + 313Ae3t2 + 21Ae3t2 = 20Ae3t .
Setting 20Ae3t = 10e3t and solving for A gives A = 1>2; hence,
yp1t2 = e3t
2
is a solution to (3).  ◆
Example 3
Find a particular solution to
(4)	
y″ + 3y′ + 2y = sin t .
Solution
Our initial action might be to guess y11t2 = A sin t, but this will fail because the derivatives 
introduce cosine terms:
y>
1 + 3y=
1 + 2y1 = -A sin t + 3A cos t + 2A sin t = A sin t + 3A cos t ,
and matching this with sin t would require that A equal both 1 and 0. So we include the cosine 
term in the trial solution:
yp1t2 = A sin t + B cos t ,
y=
p1t2 = A cos t - B sin t ,
y>
p1t2 = -A sin t - B cos t ,
and (4) becomes
 y>
p1t2 + 3y=
p1t2 + 2yp1t2 = -A sin t - B cos t + 3A cos t - 3B sin t
 
+ 2A sin t + 2B cos t
 = 1A - 3B2 sin t + 1B + 3A2 cos t
 =  sin t .
The equations A - 3B = 1, B + 3A = 0 have the solution A = 0.1, B = -0.3. Thus, the 
function
yp1t2 = 0.1 sin t - 0.3 cos t
is a particular solution to (4).  ◆
More generally, for an equation of the form
(5)	
ay″ + by′ + cy = C sin bt  1or  C cos bt2 ,
the method of undetermined coefficients suggests that we guess
(6)	
yp1t2 = A cos bt + B sin bt
and solve (5) for the unknowns A and B.

If we compare equation (5) with the mass–spring system equation
(7)	
3inertia4 * y″ + 3damping4 * y′ + 3stiffness4 * y = Fext ,
we can interpret (5) as describing a damped oscillator, shaken with a sinusoidal force. Accord-
ing to our discussion in Section 4.1, then, we would expect the mass ultimately to respond by 
moving in synchronization with the forcing sinusoid. In other words, the form (6) is suggested 
by physical, as well as mathematical, experience. A complete description of forced oscillators 
will be given in Section 4.10.
Example 4
Find a particular solution to
(8)	
y″ + 4y = 5t2et .
Solution
Our experience with Example 1 suggests that we take a trial solution of the form yp1t2 =
1At2 + Bt + C2et, to match the nonhomogeneity in (8). We find
 yp = 1At2 + Bt + C2et ,
 y=
p = 12At + B2et + 1At2 + Bt + C2et ,
 y>
p = 2Aet + 212At + B2et + 1At2 + Bt + C2et ,
 y>
p + 4yp = et12A + 2B + C + 4C2 + tet14A + B + 4B2 + t2et1A + 4A2
 = 5t2et .
Matching like terms yields A = 1, B = -4>5, and C = -2>25. A solution is given by
yp1t2 = at2 - 4t

As our examples illustrate, when the nonhomogeneous term f1t2 is an exponential, a sine, 
a cosine function, or a nonnegative integer power of t times any of these, the function f1t2 
itself suggests the form of a particular solution. However, certain situations thwart the straight-
forward application of the method of undetermined coefficients. Consider, for example, the 
equation
(9)	
y″ + y′ = 5 .
Example 1 suggests that we guess y11t2 = A, a zero-degree polynomial. But substitution into 
(9) proves futile:
1A2″ + 1A2′ = 0 ≠5 .
The problem arises because any constant function, such as y11t2 = A, is a solution to the cor-
responding homogeneous equation y″ + y′ = 0, and the undetermined coefficient A gets lost 
upon substitution into the equation. We would encounter the same situation if we tried to find 
a solution to
(10)	
y″ - 6y′ + 9y = e3t
of the form y1 = Ae3t, because e3t solves the associated homogeneous equation and
3Ae3t4 ″ - 63Ae3t4 ′ + 93Ae3t4 = 0 ≠e3t .
The “trick” for refining the method of undetermined coefficients in these situations smacks 
of the same logic as in Section 4.2, when a method was prescribed for finding second solutions 
to homogeneous equations with double roots. Basically, we append an extra factor of t to the trial 

Section 4.4    Nonhomogeneous Equations: the Method of Undetermined Coefficients           177
solution suggested by the basic procedure. In other words, to solve (9) we try yp1t2 = At instead 
of A:
(9′)	
yp = At, y=
p = A, y>
p = 0,
	
 y>
p + y=
p = 0 + A = 5 ,
	
A = 5, 
 yp1t2 = 5t .
Similarly, to solve (10) we try yp = Ate3t instead of Ae3t. The trick won’t work this time, 
because the characteristic equation of (10) has a double root and, consequently, Ate3t also 
solves the homogeneous equation:
3Ate3t4 ″ - 63Ate3t4 ′ + 93Ate3t4 = 0 ≠e3t.
But if we append another factor of t, yp = At2e3t, we succeed in finding a particular solution:†
 yp = At2e3t,   y=
p = 2Ate3t + 3At2e3t,   y>
p = 2Ae3t + 12Ate3t + 9At2e3t ,
 y>
p - 6y=
p + 9yp = 12Ae3t + 12Ate3t + 9At2e3t2 - 612Ate3t + 3At2e3t2 + 91At2e3t2
 = 2Ae3t = e3t ,
so A = 1>2 and yp1t2 = t2e3t>2.
To see why this strategy resolves the problem and to generalize it, recall the form of the 
original differential equation (1), ay″ + by′ + cy = f1t2. Its associated auxiliary equation is
(11)	
ar2 + br + c = 0 ,
and if r is a double root, then
(12)	
2ar + b = 0
holds also [equation (13), Section 4.2, page 163].
Now suppose the nonhomogeneity f1t2 has the form Ctmert, and we seek to match this
f1t2 by substituting yp1t2 = 1Antn + An-1tn-1 + g + A1t + A02ert into (1), with the power 
n to be determined. For simplicity we merely list the leading terms in yp, y=
p, and y>
p:
 yp = Antnert + An-1tn-1ert + An-2tn-2ert +  (lower-order terms)
 y′p = Anrtnert + Anntn-1ert + An-1rtn-1ert + An-11n - 12tn-2ert
+ An-2rtn-2ert + 1l.o.t.2 ,
 y″p = Anr2tnert + 2Annrtn-1ert + Ann1n - 12tn-2ert
+ An-1r2tn-1ert + 2An-1r1n - 12tn-2ert + An-2r2tn-2ert + 1l.o.t2 .
Then the left-hand member of (1) becomes
(13)	
ay>
p + by=
p + cyp
= An1ar2 + br + c2tnert + 3Ann12ar + b2 + An-11ar2 + br + c24tn-1ert
+ 3Ann1n - 12a + An-11n - 1212ar + b2 + An-21ar2 + br + c24tn-2ert
+ 1l.o.t.2 ,
†Indeed, the solution t2 to the equation y″ = 2, computed by simple integration, can also be derived by appending two 
factors of t to the solution y K 1 of the associated homogeneous equation.

178          Chapter 4    Linear Second-Order Equations
and we observe the following:
Case 1.  If r is not a root of the auxiliary equation, the leading term in (13) is  
An1ar2 + br + c2tnert, and to match f1t2 = Ctmert we must take n = m:
yp1t2 = 1Amtm + g + A1t + A02ert .
Case 2.  If r is a simple root of the auxiliary equation, (11) holds and the leading term in 
(13) is Ann12ar + b2tn-1ert, and to match f1t2 = Ctmert we must take n = m + 1:
yp1t2 = 1Am+1tm+1 + Amtm + g + A1t + A02ert .
However, now the final term A0ert can be dropped, since it solves the associated homogeneous 
equation, so we can factor out t and for simplicity renumber the coefficients to write
yp1t2 = t1Amtm + g + A1t + A02ert .
Case 3.  If r is a double root of the auxiliary equation, (11) and (12) hold and the leading 
term in (13) is Ann1n - 12atn-2ert, and to match f1t2 = Ctmert we must take n = m + 2:
yp1t2 = 1Am+2tm+2 + Am+1tm+1 + g + A2t2 + A1t + A02ert,
but again we drop the solutions to the associated homogeneous equation and renumber to write
yp1t2 = t21Amtm + g + A1t + A02ert .
We summarize with the following rule.
Method of Undetermined Coefficients
To find a particular solution to the differential equation
ay″ + by′ + cy = Ctmert,
where m is a nonnegative integer, use the form
(14)	
yp1t2 = ts1Amtm + g + A1t + A02ert,
with
(i)	 s = 0 if r is not a root of the associated auxiliary equation;
(ii)	 s = 1 if r is a simple root of the associated auxiliary equation; and
(iii)	s = 2 if r is a double root of the associated auxiliary equation.
To find a particular solution to the differential equation
ay″ + by′ + cy = c
Ctmeatcos bt
or
Ctmeatsin bt
for b ≠0, use the form
(15)	
yp1t2 = ts1Amtm + g + A1t + A02eat cos bt
+ ts1Bmtm + g + B1t + B02eat sin bt ,
with
(iv)	s = 0 if a + ib is not a root of the associated auxiliary equation; and
(v)	 s = 1 if a + ib is a root of the associated auxiliary equation.

Section 4.4    Nonhomogeneous Equations: the Method of Undetermined Coefficients           179
[The (cos, sin) formulation (15) is easily derived from the exponential formulation (14) by 
putting r = a + ib and employing Euler’s formula, as in Section 4.3.]
Remark 1.  The nonhomogeneity Ctm corresponds to the case when r = 0.
Remark 2.  The rigorous justification of the method of undetermined coefficients [including the 
analysis of the terms we dropped in (13)] will be presented in a more general context in Chapter 6.
Example 5
Find the form for a particular solution to
(16)	
y″ + 2y′ - 3y = f1t2 ,
where f1t2 equals
(a)  7 cos 3t  (b)  2tet sin t  (c)  t2 cos pt  (d)  5e-3t  (e)  3tet  (f)  t2et
Solution
The auxiliary equation for the homogeneous equation corresponding to (16), r2 + 2r - 3 = 0, 
has roots r1 = 1 and r2 = -3. Notice that the functions in (a), (b), and (c) are associated with 
complex roots (because of the trigonometric factors). These are clearly different from r1 and r2, 
so the solution forms correspond to (15) with s = 0:
(a)	 yp1t2 = A cos 3t + B sin 3t
(b)	 yp1t2 = 1A1t + A02et  cos t + 1B1t + B02et sin t
(c)	 yp1t2 = 1A2t2 + A1t + A02 cos pt + 1B2t2 + B1t + B02 sin pt
For the nonhomogeneity in (d) we appeal to (ii) and take yp1t2 = Ate-3t since -3 is a 
simple root of the auxiliary equation. Similarly, for (e) we take yp1t2 = t1A1t + A02et and for 
(f) we take yp1t2 = t1A2t2 + A1t + A02e t.  ◆
Example 6
Find the form of a particular solution to
y″ - 2y′ + y = f1t2,
for the same set of nonhomogeneities f1t2 as in Example 5.
Solution
Now the auxiliary equation for the corresponding homogeneous equation is r2 - 2r + 1 =
1r - 122 = 0, with the double root r = 1. This root is not linked with any of the nonhomo-
geneities (a) through (d), so the same trial forms should be used for (a), (b), and (c) as in the 
previous example, and y1t2 = Ae-3t will work for (d).
Since r = 1 is a double root, we have s = 2 in (14) and the trial forms for (e) and (f) have 
to be changed to
(e)	 yp1t2 = t21A1t + A02et
(f)	 yp1t2 = t21A2t2 + A1t + A02et
respectively, in accordance with (iii).  ◆
Example 7
Find the form of a particular solution to
y″ - 2y′ + 2y = 5tet cos t .
Solution
Now the auxiliary equation for the corresponding homogeneous equation is r2 - 2r + 2 = 0, 
and it has complex roots r1 = 1 + i, r2 = 1 - i. Since the nonhomogeneity involves eat cos bt 
with a = b = 1; that is, a + ib = 1 + i = r1, the solution takes the form
yp1t2 = t1A1t + A02et cos t + t1B1t + B02et sin t .  ◆

180          Chapter 4    Linear Second-Order Equations
The nonhomogeneity tan t in an equation like y″ + y′ + y =  tan t is not one of the forms 
for which the method of undetermined coefficients can be used; the derivatives of the “trial 
solution” y1t2 = A tan t, for example, get complicated, and it is not clear what additional terms 
need to be added to obtain a true solution. In Section 4.6 we discuss a different procedure that 
can handle such nonhomogeneous terms. Keep in mind that the method of undetermined 
coefficients applies only to nonhomogeneities that are polynomials, exponentials, sines or 
cosines, or products of these functions. The superposition principle in Section 4.5 shows how 
the method can be extended to the sums of such nonhomogeneities. Also, it provides the key 
to assembling a general solution to (1) that can accommodate initial value problems, which we 
have avoided so far in our examples.

Superposition Principle
Theorem 3.	
If y1 is a solution to the differential equation
ay″ + by′ + cy = f11t2 ,
and y2 is a solution to
ay″ + by′ + cy = f21t2 ,
then for any constants k1 and k2, the function k1y1 + k2y2 is a solution to the differential 
equation
ay″ + by′ + cy = k1  f11t2 + k2  f21t2 .
Example 1
Find a particular solution to
(1)	
y″ + 3y′ + 2y = 3t + 10e3t  and
(2)	
y″ + 3y′ + 2y = -9t + 20e3t .
Solution
In Example 1, Section 4.4, we found that y11t2 = 3t>2 - 9>4 was a solution to y″ + 3y′+ 
2y = 3t, and in Example 2 we found that y21t2 = e3t>2 solved y″ + 3y′ + 2y = 10e3t. By 
superposition, then, y1 + y2 = 3t>2 - 9/4 + e3t>2 solves equation (1).
The right-hand member of (2) equals minus three times 13t2 plus two times 110e3t2. 
Therefore, this same combination of y1 and y2 will solve (2):
y1t2 = -3y1 + 2y2 = -313t>2 - 9>42 + 21e3t>22 = -9t>2 + 27>4 + e3t .  ◆

the sum

Since (5) contains two parameters, one would suspect that c1 and c2 can be chosen to make it 
satisfy arbitrary initial conditions. It is easy to verify that this is indeed the case.
Existence and Uniqueness: Nonhomogeneous Case
Theorem 4.	
For any real numbers a1 ≠02, b, c, t0, Y0, and Y1, suppose yp1t2 is a par-
ticular solution to (3) in an interval I containing t0 and that y11t2 and y21t2 are linearly 
independent solutions to the associated homogeneous equation (4) in I. Then there exists 
a unique solution in I to the initial value problem
(6)	
ay″ + by′ + cy = f1t2,    y1t02 = Y0, y′1t02 = Y1 ,
and it is given by (5), for the appropriate choice of the constants c1, c2.
Proof.  We have already seen that the superposition principle implies that (5) solves the dif-
ferential equation. To satisfy the initial conditions in (6) we need to choose the constants so that
(7)	
byp1t02 + c1y11t02 + c2y21t02 = Y0 , 
y=
p1t02 + c1y=
11t02 + c2y=
21t02 = Y1 .
But as in the proof of Theorem 2 in Section 4.2, simple algebra shows that the choice
c1 = 3Y0 - yp1t024y=
21t02 - 3Y1 - y=
p1t024y21t02
y11t02y=
21t02 - y=

11t02
y11t02y=
21t02 - y=

solves (7) unless the denominator is zero; Lemma 1, Section 4.2, assures us that it is not.
Why is the solution unique? If yI1t2 were another solution to (6), then the difference 
yII1t2 := yp1t2 + c1y11t2 + c2y21t2 - yI1t2 would satisfy
(8)	
bay>
II + by=
II + cyII = f1t2 - f1t2 = 0 ,
yII1t02 = Y0 - Y0 = 0 ,   y=
II1t02 = Y1 - Y1 = 0 .
But the initial value problem (8) admits the identically zero solution, and Theorem 1 in Section 
4.2 applies since the differential equation in (8) is homogeneous. Consequently, (8) has only the 
identically zero solution. Thus, yII K 0 and yI = yp + c1y1 + c2y2.  ◆
These deliberations entitle us to say that y = yp + c1y1 + c2y2 is a general solution to the 
nonhomogeneous equation (3), since any solution yg1t2 can be expressed in this form. (Proof: 
As in Section 4.2, we simply pick c1 and c2 so that yp + c1y1 + c2y2 matches the value and the 
derivative of yg at any single point; by uniqueness, yp + c1y1 + c2y2 and yg have to be the same 
function.)
Example 2
Given that yp1t2 = t2 is a particular solution to
y″ - y = 2 - t2 , 
find a general solution and a solution satisfying y102 = 1, y′102 = 0.

Section 4.5    The Superposition Principle and Undetermined Coefficients Revisited           183
Solution
The corresponding homogeneous equation,
y″ - y = 0 , 
has the associated auxiliary equation r2 - 1 = 0. Because r = {1 are the roots of this equa-
tion, a general solution to the homogeneous equation is c1et + c2e-t. Combining this with the par-
ticular solution yp1t2 = t2 of the nonhomogeneous equation, we find that a general solution is
y1t2 = t2 + c1et + c2e-t .
To meet the initial conditions, set
 y102 = 02 + c1e0 + c2e-0 = 1 , 
 y′102 = 2 * 0 + c1e0 - c2e-0 = 0 , 
which yields c1 = c2 = 1
2. The answer is
y1t2 = t2 + 1
21et + e-t2 = t2 +  cosh t .  ◆
Example 3
A mass–spring system is driven by a sinusoidal external force 15 sin t + 5 cos t2. The mass 
equals 1, the spring constant equals 2, and the damping coefficient equals 2 (in appropriate units), 
so the deliberations of Section 4.1 imply that the motion is governed by the differential equation
(9)	
y″ + 2y′ + 2y = 5 sin t + 5 cos t .
If the mass is initially located at y102 = 1, with a velocity y′102 = 2, find its equation of motion.
Solution
The associated homogeneous equation y″ + 2y′ + 2y = 0 was studied in Example 1, Section 
4.3; the roots of the auxiliary equation were found to be -1 { i, leading to a general solution 
c1e-t cos t + c2e-t sin t.
The method of undetermined coefficients dictates that we try to find a particular solution 
of the form A sin t + B cos t for the first nonhomogeneity 5 sin t:
(10)	
yp = A sin t + B cos t ,   y=
p = A cos t - B sin t ,   y>
p = -A sin t - B cos t ;
	
y>
p + 2y=
p + 2yp = 1 -A - 2B + 2A2 sin t + 1 -B + 2A + 2B2 cos t = 5 sin t .
Matching coefficients requires A = 1, B = -2 and so yp =  sin t - 2 cos t.
The second nonhomogeneity 5 cos t calls for the identical form for yp and leads  
to 
1 -A - 2B + 2A2 sin t + 1 -B + 2A + 2B2 cos t = 5 cos t, 
or 
A = 2, B = 1. 
Hence  
yp = 2 sin t +  cos t.
By the superposition principle, a general solution to (9) is given by the sum
 y = c1e-t cos t + c2e-t sin t +  sin t - 2 cos t + 2 sin t +  cos t
 = c1e-t cos t + c2e-t sin t + 3 sin t -  cos t .
The initial conditions are
 y102 = 1 = c1e-0 cos 0 + c2e-0 sin 0 + 3 sin 0 -  cos 0 = c1 - 1 ,
 y′102 = 2 = c13 -e-t cos t - e-t sin t4t = 0 + c23 -e-t sin t + e-t cos t4t = 0
 + 3 cos 0 +  sin 0
 = -c1 + c2 + 3 ,
requiring c1 = 2, c2 = 1, and thus
(11)	
y1t2 = 2e-t cos t + e-t sin t + 3 sin t -  cos t .  ◆

The solution (11) exemplifies the features of forced, damped oscillations that we antici-
pated in Section 4.1. There is a sinusoidal component 13 sin t -  cos t2 that is synchronous 
with the driving force 15 sin t + 5 cos t2, and a component 12e-t cos t + e-t sin t2 that dies out. 
When the system is “pumped” sinusoidally, the response is a synchronous sinusoidal oscilla-
tion, after an initial transient that depends on the initial conditions; the synchronous response 
is the particular solution supplied by the method of undetermined coefficients, and the transient 
is the solution to the associated homogeneous equation. This interpretation will be discussed in 
detail in Sections 4.9 and 4.10.
You may have observed that, since the two undetermined-coefficient forms in the last 
example were identical and were destined to be added together, we could have used the form 
(10) to match both nonhomogeneities at the same time, deriving the condition
y>
p + 2y=
p + 2yp = 1 -A - 2B + 2A2 sin t + 1 -B + 2A + 2B2 cos t = 5 sin t + 5 cos t ,
with solution yp = 3 sin t -  cos t. The next example illustrates this “streamlined” procedure.
Example 4
Find a particular solution to
(12)	
y″ - y = 8tet + 2et .
Solution
A general solution to the associated homogeneous equation is easily seen to be c1et + c2e-t. 
Thus, a particular solution for matching the nonhomogeneity 8tet has the form t1A1t + A02et, 
whereas matching 2et requires the form A0tet. Therefore, we can match both with the first form:
 yp = t1A1t + A02et = 1A1t2 + A0t2et , 
 y=
p = 1A1t2 + A0t2et + 12A1t + A02et = 3A1t2 + 12A1 + A02t + A04et , 
 y>
p = 32A1t + 12A1 + A02 4et + 3A1t2 + 12A1 + A02t + A04et
 = 3A1t2 + 14A1 + A02t + 12A1 + 2A02 4et .
Thus
 y″p - yp = 34A1t + 12A1 + 2A02 4et
 = 8tet + 2et , 
which yields A1 = 2, A0 = -1, and so yp = 12t2 - t2et.  ◆
We generalize this procedure by modifying the method of undetermined coefficients as 
follows.
Method of Undetermined Coefficients (Revisited)
To find a particular solution to the differential equation
ay″ + by′ + cy = Pm1t2ert, 
where Pm1t2 is a polynomial of degree m, use the form
(13)	
yp1t2 = ts1Amtm + g + A1t + A02ert ;
if r is not a root of the associated auxiliary equation, take s = 0; if r is a simple root of 
the associated auxiliary equation, take s = 1; and if r is a double root of the associated 
auxiliary equation, take s = 2.

Section 4.5    The Superposition Principle and Undetermined Coefficients Revisited           185
To find a particular solution to the differential equation
ay″ + by′ + cy = Pm1t2eat cos bt + Qn1t2eat sin bt ,  b ≠0 ,
where Pm1t2 is a polynomial of degree m and Qn1t2 is a polynomial of degree n, use the 
form
(14)	
 yp1t2 = ts1Aktk + g + A1t + A02eat cos bt
 
+ ts1Bktk + g + B1t + B02eat sin bt , 
where k is the larger of m and n. If a + ib is not a root of the associated auxiliary equa-
tion, take s = 0; if a + ib is a root of the associated auxiliary equation, take s = 1.
Example 5
Write down the form of a particular solution to the equation
y″ + 2y′ + 2y = 5e-t sin t + 5t3e-t cos t .
Solution
The roots of the associated homogeneous equation y″ + 2y′ + 2y = 0 were identified in 
Example 3 as -1 { i. Application of (14) dictates the form
yp1t2 = t1A3t3 + A2t2 + A1t + A02e-t cos t + t1B3t3 + B2t2 + B1t + B02e-t sin t .  ◆
The method of undetermined coefficients applies to higher-order linear differential equa-
tions with constant coefficients. Details will be provided in Chapter 6, but the following example 
should be clear.
Example 6
Write down the form of a particular solution to the equation
y‴ + 2y″ + y′ = 5e-t sin t + 3 + 7te-t .
Solution
The auxiliary equation for the associated homogeneous is r3 + 2r2 + r = r1r + 122 = 0, with 
a double root r = -1 and a single root r = 0. Term by term, the nonhomogeneities call for 
the forms
A0 e-t cos t + B0 e-t sin t   1for 5e-t sin t2 , 
t A0   1for 32 , 
t21A1t + A02e-t   1for 7te-t2 .
(If -1 were a triple root, we would need t31A1t + A02e-t for 7te-t.) Of course, we have to 
rename the coefficients, so the general form is
yp1t2 = Ae-t cos t + Be-t sin t + tC + t21Dt + E2e-t .  ◆

We have seen that the method of undetermined coefficients is a simple procedure for determin-
ing a particular solution when the equation has constant coefficients and the nonhomogeneous term 
is of a special type. Here we present a more general method, called variation of parameters,† for 
finding a particular solution.
Consider the nonhomogeneous linear second-order equation
(1)	
ay″ + by′ + cy = ƒ1t2
and let {y11t2, y21t2} be two linearly independent solutions for the corresponding homoge-
neous equation
ay″ + by′ + cy = 0 .
4.6  Variation of Parameters
†Historical Footnote: The method of variation of parameters was invented by Joseph Lagrange in 1774.

188          Chapter 4    Linear Second-Order Equations
Then we know that a general solution to this homogeneous equation is given by
(2)	
yh1t2 = c1y11t2 + c2y21t2 ,
where c1 and c2 are constants. To find a particular solution to the nonhomogeneous equation, 
the strategy of variation of parameters is to replace the constants in (2) by functions of t. That 
is, we seek a solution of (1) of the form†
(3)	
yp1t2 = V11t2y11t2 + V21t2y21t2 .
Because we have introduced two unknown functions, v11t2 and v21t2, it is reasonable 
to expect that we can impose two equations (requirements) on these functions. Naturally, one 
of these equations should come from (1). Let’s therefore plug yp1t2 given by (3) into (1). To 
accomplish this, we must first compute y=
p1t2 and y>
p1t2. From (3) we obtain
y=
p = 1v=
1y1 + v=
2y22 + 1v1y=
1 + v2y=
22 .
To simplify the computation and to avoid second-order derivatives for the unknowns v1, v2 in 
the expression for y>
p, we impose the requirement
(4)	
v=
1y1 + v=
2y2 = 0 .
Thus, the formula for y=
p becomes
(5)	
y=
p = v1y=

2 , 
and so
(6)	
y>
p = v=
1y=
1 + v1y″1 + v=

2 .
Now, substituting yp, y=
p, and y>
p, as given in (3), (5), and (6), into (1), we find
(7)	
 f = ay>

p + cyp

 = a1v=
1y=
1 + v=
2y=

since y1 and y2 are solutions to the homogeneous equation. Thus, (7) reduces to
(8)	
y=
1y=
1 + y=
2y=
2 = f
a .
To summarize, if we can find v1 and v2 that satisfy both (4) and (8), that is,
(9)
	
y1V′1 + y2V′2 = 0 ,
	
y′1V′1 + y′2V′2 = f
a , 
then yp given by (3) will be a particular solution to (1). To determine v1 and v2, we first solve 
the linear system (9) for v=
1 and v=
2. Algebraic manipulation or Cramer’s rule (see Appendix D) 
immediately gives
v=

11t2y21t24
 , 
†In Exercises 2.3, Problem 36, we developed this approach for first-order linear equations. Because of the similarity  
of equations (2) and (3), this technique is sometimes known as “variation of constants.”

Let’s review this procedure.

d2y
dt2 + y = tan t .
Of course, in step (b) one could use the formulas in (10), but v11t2 and v21t2 are so easy 
to derive that you are advised not to memorize them.
Solution
Observe that two independent solutions to the homogeneous equation y″ + y = 0 are cos t and 
sin t. We now set
(12)	
yp1t2 = v11t2 cos t + v21t2 sin t
and, referring to (9), solve the system
 1 cos t2v=
11t2 + 1 sin t2v=
21t2 = 0  ,
 1 - sin t2v=
11t2 + 1 cos t2v=

for v=

v=

Method of Variation of Parameters
To determine a particular solution to ay″ + by′ + cy = f :
(a)	 Find two linearly independent solutions {y11t2, y21t2} to the corresponding  
homogeneous equation and take
yp1t2 = v11t2y11t2 + v21t2y21t2 .
(b)	 Determine v11t2 and v21t2 by solving the system in (9) for v=
11t2 and v=
21t2 and 
integrating.
(c)	 Substitute v11t2 and v21t2 into the expression for yp1t2 to obtain a particular solution.

190          Chapter 4    Linear Second-Order Equations
We need only one particular solution, so we take both C1 and C2 to be zero for simplicity. 
Then, substituting v11t2 and v21t2 in (12), we obtain
yp1t2 = 1sin t - ln0 sec t +  tan t0 2 cos t -  cos t  sin t ,
which simplifies to
yp1t2 = -1cos t2 ln0 sec t +  tan t0  .
We may drop the absolute value symbols because sec t +  tan t = 11 +  sin t2> cos t 7 0 for 
-p>2 6 t 6 p>2.
Recall that a general solution to a nonhomogeneous equation is given by the sum of a gen-
eral solution to the homogeneous equation and a particular solution. Consequently, a general 
solution to equation (11) on the interval 1 -p>2, p>22 is
(15)	
y1t2 = c1 cos t + c2 sin t - 1 cos t2 ln1sec t +  tan t2 .  ◆
Note that in the above example the constants C1 and C2 appearing in (13) and (14) were 
chosen to be zero. If we had retained these arbitrary constants, the ultimate effect would be just 
to add C1 cos t + C2 sin t to (15), which is clearly redundant.
Example 2
Find a particular solution on 1 -p>2, p>22 to
(16)	
d2y
dt2 + y =  tan t + 3t - 1 .
Solution
With f 1t2 = tan t + 3t - 1, the variation of parameters procedure will lead to a solution. But it 
is simpler in this case to consider separately the equations
(17)	
d2y
dt2 + y =  tan t ,
(18)	
d2y
dt2 + y = 3t - 1
and then use the superposition principle (Theorem 3, page 181).
In Example 1 we found that
yq1t2 = -1cos t2 ln1sec t +  tan t2
is a particular solution for equation (17). For equation (18) the method of undetermined coef-
ficients can be applied. On seeking a solution to (18) of the form yr1t2 = At + B, we quickly 
obtain
yr1t2 = 3t - 1 .
Finally, we apply the superposition principle to get
 yp1t2 = yq1t2 + yr1t2
 = -1cos t2 ln1sec t +  tan t2 + 3t - 1
as a particular solution for equation (16).  ◆
Note that we could not have solved Example 1 by the method of undetermined coeffi-
cients; the nonhomogeneity tan t is unsuitable. Another important advantage of the method of 
variation of parameters is its applicability to linear equations whose coefficients a, b, c are 
functions of t. Indeed, on reviewing the derivation of the system (9) and the formulas (10), one 

Section 4.6    Variation of Parameters          191
can check that we did not make any use of the constant coefficient property; i.e., the method 
works provided we know a pair of linearly independent solutions to the corresponding homo-
geneous equation. We illustrate the method in the next example.
Example 3
Find a particular solution of the variable coefficient linear equation
(19)	
t2y″ - 4ty′ + 6y = 4t3 , t 7 0 ,
given that y11t2 = t2 and y21t2 = t3 are solutions to the corresponding homogeneous equation.
Solution
The functions t2 and t3 are linearly independent solutions to the corresponding homogeneous 
equation on 10, ∞2 (verify this !) and so (19) has a particular solution of the form
yp1t2 = v11t2t2 + v21t2t3 .
To determine the unknown functions v1 and v2, we solve the system (9) with f 1t2 = 4t3 and 
a = a1t2 = t2 :
 t2v=
11t2 + t3v=
21t2 = 0
 2tv=
11t2 + 3t2v=
21t2 = f>a = 4t .
The solutions are readily found to be v=
11t2 = -4 and v=
21t2 = 4>t, which gives v11t2 = -4t 
and v21t2 = 4 ln t. Consequently,
yp1t2 = 1 -4t2t2 + 14 ln t2t3 = 4t31 -1 + ln t2
is a solution to (19).  ◆

The techniques of Sections 4.2 and 4.3 have explicitly demonstrated that solutions to a linear 
homogeneous constant-coefficient differential equation,
(1)	
ay″ + by′ + cy = 0 ,
are defined and satisfy the equation over the whole interval 1 - ∞, + ∞2. After all, such solu-
tions are combinations of exponentials, sinusoids, and polynomials.
The variation of parameters formula of Section 4.6 extended this to nonhomogeneous 
constant-coefficient problems,
(2)	
ay″ + by′ + cy = f 1t2 ,
yielding solutions valid over all intervals where f1t2 is continuous (ensuring that the integrals 
in (10) of Section 4.6 containing f1t2 exist and are differentiable). We could hardly hope for 
more; indeed, it is debatable what meaning the differential equation (2) would have at a point 
where f1t2 is undefined, or discontinuous.
Therefore, when we move to the realm of equations with variable coefficients of the form
(3)	
a21t2y″ + a11t2y′ + a01t2y = f1t2 ,
the most we can expect is that there are solutions that are valid over intervals where all four 
“governing” functions—a21t2, a11t2, a01t2, and f1t2—are continuous. Fortunately, this 
expectation is fulfilled except for an important technical requirement—namely, that the coef-
ficient function a21t2 must be nonzero over the interval.†
Typically, one divides by the nonzero coefficient a21t2 and expresses the theorem for the 
equation in standard form [see (4), below] as follows.

Existence and Uniqueness of Solutions
Theorem 5.	
If p1t2, q1t2, and g(t) are continuous on an interval 1a, b2 that contains 
the point t0, then for any choice of the initial values Y0 and Y1, there exists a unique solu-
tion y1t2 on the same interval (a, b) to the initial value problem

is zero.

the point t0 = 1, where the initial conditions are specified, so Theorem 5 guarantees (5) has a 
unique solution in 0 6 t 6 3.  ◆
Theorem 5, embracing existence and uniqueness for the variable-coefficient case, is dif-
ficult to prove because we can’t construct explicit solutions in the general case. So the proof is 
deferred to Chapter 13.† However, it is instructive to examine a special case that we can solve 
explicitly.
Cauchy–Euler, or Equidimensional, Equations
Definition 2.	 A linear second-order equation that can be expressed in the form
(6)	
at2y″1t2 + bty′1t2 + cy = f1t2 ,
where a, b, and c are constants, is called a Cauchy–Euler, or equidimensional, equation.
†All references to Chapters 11–13 refer to the expanded text, Fundamentals of Differential Equations and Boundary 
Value Problems, 7th ed.
For example, the differential equation
3t2y″ + 11ty′ - 3y = sin t
is a Cauchy–Euler equation, whereas
2y″ - 3ty′ + 11y = 3t - 1
is not because the coefficient of y″ is 2, which is not a constant times t2.
The nomenclature equidimensional comes about because if y has the dimensions of, say, meters 
and t has dimensions of time, then each term t2y″, ty′, and y has the same dimensions (meters). The 
coefficient of y″1t2 in (6) is at2, and it is zero at t = 0; equivalently, the standard form
y″ + b
at y′ + c
at2 y = f1t2
at2
has discontinuous coefficients at t = 0. Therefore, we can expect the solutions to be valid only 
for t 7 0 or t 6 0. Discontinuities in ƒ, of course, will impose further restrictions.

194          Chapter 4    Linear Second-Order Equations
To solve a homogeneous Cauchy–Euler equation, for t 7 0, we exploit the equidimen-
sional feature by looking for solutions of the form y = tr, because then t2y″, ty′, and y each 
have the form (constant) * tr:
y = tr , ty′ = trtr-1 = rtr , t2y″ = t2r1r - 12tr-2 = r1r - 12tr ,
and substitution into the homogeneous form of (6) (that is, with g = 0) yields a simple qua-
dratic equation for r:
ar1r - 12tr + brtr + ctr = [ar2 + 1b - a2r + c]tr = 0 , or
(7)	
ar2 + 1b - a2r + c = 0 ,
which we call the associated characteristic equation.
Example 2
Find two linearly independent solutions to the equation
3t2y″ + 11ty′ - 3y = 0 , t 7 0 .
Solution
Inserting y = tr yields, according to (7),
3r2 + 111 - 32r - 3 = 3r2 + 8r - 3 = 0 ,
whose roots r = 1>3 and r = -3 produce the independent solutions
y11t2 = t1>3 , y21t2 = t -3 1for  t 7 02 .  ◆
Clearly, the substitution y = tr into a homogeneous equidimensional equation has the 
same simplifying effect as the insertion of y = ert into the homogeneous constant-coefficient 
equation in Section 4.2. That means we will have to deal with the same encumbrances:
1.	 What to do when the roots of (7) are complex
2.	 What to do when the roots of (7) are equal
If r is complex, r = a + ib, we can interpret ta+ib by using the identity t = eln t and 
invoking Euler’s formula [equation (5), Section 4.3]:
ta+ib = tatib = taeib ln t = ta3cos1b ln t2 + i sin1b ln t24 .
Then we simplify as in Section 4.3 by taking the real and imaginary parts to form independent 
solutions:
(8)	
y1 = ta cos1b ln t2 , y2 = ta sin1b ln t2 .
If r is a double root of the characteristic equation (7), then independent solutions of the 
Cauchy–Euler equation on 10, ∞2 are given by
(9)	
y1 = tr , y2 = tr ln t .
This can be verified by direct substitution into the differential equation. Alternatively, the sec-
ond, linearly independent, solution can be obtained by reduction of order, a procedure to be 
discussed shortly in Theorem 8. Furthermore, Problem 23 demonstrates that the substitution 
t = ex changes the homogeneous Cauchy–Euler equation into a homogeneous constant-coefficient 
equation, and the formats (8) and (9) then follow from our earlier deliberations.
We remark that if a homogeneous Cauchy–Euler equation is to be solved for t 6 0, then 
one simply introduces the change of variable t = -t, where t 7 0. The reader should verify 
via the chain rule that the identical characteristic equation (7) arises when tr = 1 -t2r is sub-
stituted in the equation. Thus the solutions take the same form as (8), (9), but with t replaced 

Section 4.7    Variable-Coefficient Equations          195
by -t; for example, if r is a double root of (7), we get 1 -t2r and 1 -t2r ln 1 -t2 as two linearly 
independent solutions on 1 - ∞, 02.
Example 3
Find a pair of linearly independent solutions to the following Cauchy–Euler equations for t 7 0.
(a)	 t2y″ + 5ty′ + 5y = 0        (b)  t2y″ + ty′ = 0
Solution
For part (a), the characteristic equation becomes r2 + 4r + 5 = 0 , with the roots r = -2 { i , 
and (8) produces the real solutions t-2 cos1ln t2 and t-2 sin1ln t2.
For part (b), the characteristic equation becomes simply r2 = 0 with the double root 
r = 0, and (9) yields the solutions t0 = 1 and ln t.  ◆
In Chapter 8 we will see how one can obtain power series expansions for solutions to vari-
able-coefficient equations when the coefficients are analytic functions. But, as we said, there 
is no procedure for explicitly solving the general case. Nonetheless, thanks to the existence/ 
uniqueness result of Theorem 5, most of the other theorems and concepts of the preceding sec-
tions are easily extended to the variable-coefficient case, with the proviso that they apply only 
over intervals in which the governing functions p1t2, q1t2, g1t2 are continuous. Thus we have 
the following analog of Lemma 1, page 160.
†The determinant representation of the Wronskian was introduced in Problem 34, Section 4.2.
A Condition for Linear Dependence of Solutions
Lemma 3.	
If y11t2 and y21t2 are any two solutions to the homogeneous differential 
equation
(10)	
y″1t2 + p1t2y′1t2 + q1t2y1t2 = 0
on an interval I where the functions p1t2 and q1t2 are continuous and if the Wronskian†

is zero at any point t of I, then y1 and y2 are linearly dependent on I.
As in the constant-coefficient case, the Wronskian of two solutions is either identically 
zero or never zero on I, with the latter implying linear independence on I.
Precisely as in the proof for the constant-coefficient case, it can be verified that any linear 
combination c1y1 + c2y2 of solutions y1 and y2 to (10) is also a solution. In fact, these are the 
only solutions to (10) as stated in the following result.
Representation of Solutions to Initial Value Problems
Theorem 6.	
If y11t2 and y21t2 are any two solutions to the homogeneous differential 
equation (10) that are linearly independent on an interval I, then every solution to (10) 
on I is expressible as a linear combination of y1 and y2. Moreover, the initial value prob-
lem consisting of equation (10) and the initial conditions y1t02 = Y0, y′1t02 = Y1 has a 
unique solution on I for any point t0 in I and any constants Y0, Y1.

196          Chapter 4    Linear Second-Order Equations
As in the constant-coefficient case, the linear combination yh = c1y1 + c2y2 is called a 
general solution to (10) on I if y1, y2 are linearly independent solutions on I.
For the nonhomogeneous equation
(11)	
y″1t2 + p1t2y′1t2 + q1t2y1t2 = g1t2 ,
a general solution on I is given by y = yp + yh, where yh = c1y1 + c2y2 is a general solu-
tion to the corresponding homogeneous equation (10) on I and yp is a particular solution 
to (11) on I. In other words, the solution to the initial value problem stated in Theorem 5 must 
be of this form for a suitable choice of the constants c1, c2. This follows, just as before, from 
a straightforward extension of the superposition principle for variable-coefficient equations 
described in Problem 30.
As illustrated at the end of the Section 4.6, if linearly independent solutions to the homo-
geneous equation (10) are known, then yp can be determined for (11) by the variation of 
parameters method.
Variation of Parameters
Theorem 7.	
If y1 and y2 are two linearly independent solutions to the homogeneous 
equation (10) on an interval I where p1t2, q1t2, and g1t2 are continuous, then a particu-
lar solution to (11) is given by yp = v1y1 + v2y2, where v1 and v2 are determined up to a 
constant by the pair of equations
y1V′1 + y2V′2 = 0 ,
y1′V1′ + y2′V2′ = g ,
which have the solution
(12)	
v11t2 =
L
-g1t2 y21t2
W3y1, y241t2 dt , v21t2 =
L
g1t2y11t2
W3y1, y241t2 dt .
Note the formulation (12) presumes that the differential equation has been put into 
standard form [that is, divided by a21t2].
The proofs of the constant-coefficient versions of these theorems in Sections 4.2 and 4.5 
did not make use of the constant-coefficient property, so one can prove them in the general case 
by literally copying those proofs but interpreting the coefficients as variables. Unfortunately, 
however, there is no construction analogous to the method of undetermined coefficients for the 
variable-coefficient case.
What does all this mean? The only stumbling block for our completely solving nonhomo-
geneous initial value problems for equations with variable coefficients,
y″ + p1t2y′ + q1t2y = g1t2 ; y1t02 = Y0 , y′1t02 = Y1 ,
is the lack of an explicit procedure for constructing independent solutions to the associated 
homogeneous equation (10). If we had y1 and y2 as described in the variation of parame-
ters formula, we could implement (12) to find yp, formulate the general solution of (11) as 
yp + c1y1 + c2y2, and (with the assurance that the Wronskian is nonzero) fit the constants to 
the initial conditions. But with the exception of the Cauchy–Euler equation and the ponderous 
power series machinery of Chapter 8, we are stymied at the outset; there is no general proce-
dure for finding y1 and y2.

Section 4.7    Variable-Coefficient Equations          197
Ironically, we only need one nontrivial solution to the associated homogeneous equation, 
thanks to a procedure known as reduction of order that constructs a second, linearly indepen-
dent solution y2 from a known one y1. So one might well feel that the following theorem rubs 
salt into the wound.
Reduction of Order
Theorem 8.	
If y11t2 is a solution, not identically zero, to the homogeneous differen-
tial equation (10) in an interval I (see page 195), then
(13)	
y21t2 = y11t2 
L
e-1p1t2dt
y11t22   dt
is a second, linearly independent solution.
This remarkable formula can be confirmed directly, but the following derivation shows 
how the procedure got its name.
Proof of Theorem 8.  Our strategy is similar to that used in the derivation of the varia-
tion of parameters formula, Section 4.6. Bearing in mind that cy1 is a solution of (10) for any 
constant c, we replace c by a function v1t2 and propose the trial solution y21t2 = v1t2y11t2, 
spawning the formulas
y=
2 = vy=
1 + v=y1 , y>
2 = vy>
1 + 2v=y=
1 + v>y1 .
Substituting these expressions into the differential equation (10) yields
1vy>
1 + 2v′y=
1 + v″y12 + p1vy=
1 + v′y12 + qvy1 = 0 ,
or, on regrouping,
(14)	
1 y>
1 + py=
1 + qy12v + y1v″ + 12y=
1 + py12v′ = 0 .
The group in front of the undifferentiated v1t2 is simply a copy of the left-hand member of the 
original differential equation (10), so it is zero.† Thus (14) reduces to
(15)	
y1v″ + 12y1
= + py12v′ = 0 ,
which is actually a first-order equation in the variable w K v′:
(16)	
y1w′ + 12y1
= + py12w = 0 .
Indeed, (16) is separable and can be solved immediately using the procedure of Section 2.2. 
Problem 48 on page 201 requests the reader to carry out the details of this procedure to com-
plete the derivation of (13).  ◆
†This is hardly a surprise; if v were constant, vy would be a solution with v′ = v″ = 0 in (14).
Example 4
Given that y11t2 = t is a solution to
(17)	
y″ - 1
t  y′ + 1
t2 y = 0 ,
use the reduction of order procedure to determine a second linearly independent solution for  
t 7 0.

198          Chapter 4    Linear Second-Order Equations
Solution
Rather than implementing the formula (13), let’s apply the strategy used to derive it. We set 
y21t2 = v1t2y11t2 = v1t2t and substitute y=
2 = v′t + v, y>
2 = v″t + 2v′ into (17) to find
(18)	
 v″t + 2v′ - 1
t 1v′t + v2 + 1
t2 vt = v″t + 12v′ - v′2 = v″t + v′ = 0 .
As promised, (18) is a separable first-order equation in v′, simplifying to 1v′2′>1v′2 = -1>t 
with a solution v′ = 1>t, or v = ln t (taking integration constants to be zero). Therefore, a 
second solution to (17) is y2 = vt = t ln t.
Of course (17) is a Cauchy–Euler equation for which (7) has equal roots:
ar2 + 1b - a2r + c = r2 - 2r + 1 = 1r - 122 = 0 ,
and y2 is precisely the form for the independent solution predicted by (9).  ◆
Example 5
The following equation arises in the mathematical modeling of reverse osmosis.†
(19)	
1sin t2y″ - 21cos t2y′ - 1sin t2y = 0 , 0 6 t 6 p .
Find a general solution.
Solution
As we indicated above, the tricky part is to find a single nontrivial solution. Inspection of (19) 
suggests that y = sin t or y = cos t, combined with a little luck with trigonometric identities, 
might be solutions. In fact, trial and error shows that the cosine function works:
y1 = cos t , y1
= = -sin t , y1
> = -cos t ,
1sin t2y>
1 - 21cos t2y=
1 - 1sin t2y1 = 1sin t21 -cos t2 - 21cos t21 -sin t2 - 1sin t21cos t2 = 0 .
Unfortunately, the sine function fails (try it).
So we use reduction of order to construct a second, independent solution.  
Setting 
y21t2 = v1t2y11t2 = v1t2cos t 
and 
computing 
y=
2 = v′cos t - v sin t, 
y>
2 = 
v″cos t - 2v′sin t - v cos t, we substitute into (19) to derive
1sin t23v″cos t - 2v′sin t - v cos t4 - 21cos t23v′cos t - v sin t4 - 1sin t23v cos t4
= v″1sin t21cos t2 - 2v′1sin2 t + cos2 t2 = 0,
which is equivalent to the separated first-order equation
1v′2′
1v′2 =
2
1sin t21cos t2 = 2sec2 t
tan t  .
Taking integration constants to be zero yields ln  v′ = 2 ln 
  1 tan t2 or v′ =  tan2 t, and 
v =  tan t - t. Therefore, a second solution to (19) is y2 = 1 tan t - t2 cos t =  sin t - t cos t. 
We conclude that a general solution is c1 cos t + c2 1sin t - t cos t2.  ◆
In this section we have seen that the theory for variable-coefficient equations differs only 
slightly from the constant-coefficient case (in that solution domains are restricted to intervals), 
but explicit solutions can be hard to come by. In the next section, we will supplement our 
exposition by describing some nonrigorous procedures that sometimes can be used to predict 
qualitative features of the solutions.

as (7) in this section. If the roots of the former are 
complex, linearly independent solutions of (20) have 
the form eax cos bx and eax sin bx; if they are equal,

mula to obtain an integral representation of a second lin-
early independent solution to Hermite’s equation for the 
given value of l and corresponding solution f 1t2.

49.	 The reduction of order procedure can be used more gen-
erally to reduce a homogeneous linear nth-order equation 
to a homogeneous linear 1n - 12th-order equation. For 
the equation
ty″′ - ty″ + y′ - y = 0, 
which has f  1t2 = et as a solution, use the substitution 
y 1t2 = v 1t2 f 1t2 to reduce this third-order equation to 
a homogeneous linear second-order equation in the vari-
able w = v′.
50.	 The equation
ty″′ + 11 - t2y″ + ty′ - y = 0
has f 1t2 = t as a solution. Use the substitution y 1t2 =
v 1t2 f 1t2 to reduce this third-order equation to a homo-
geneous linear second-order equation in the variable 
w = v′.
51.	 Isolated Zeros.  Let f1t2 be a solution to y″ +
py′ + qy = 0 on (a, b), where p, q are continuous on (a, b).  
By completing the following steps, prove that if f is not 
identically zero, then its zeros in (a, b) are isolated, i.e., if 
f1t 02 = 0, then there exists a d 7 0 such that f1t2 ≠0 
for 0 6 0 t - t00 6 d.
	
(a)	 Suppose f1t 02 = 0 and assume to the contrary that 
for each n = 1, 2, c, the function f has a zero at 
tn, where 0 6 0 t0 - tn0 6 1>n. Show that this implies 
f′1t02 = 0. [Hint: Consider the difference quotient 
for f at t0.]
	
(b)	 With the assumptions of part (a), we have 
f1t02 = f′1t02 = 0. Conclude from this that f 
must be identically zero, which is a contradiction. 
Hence, there is some integer n0 such that f1t2 is not 
zero for 0 6 0 t - t00 6 1>n0.
52.	 The reduction of order formula (13) can also be derived 
from Abels’ identity (Problem 32). Let f 1t2 be a non-
trivial solution to (10) and y1t2 a second linearly inde-
pendent solution. Show that
¢y
f ≤′ =
W3f, y4
f 2
and then use Abel’s identity for the Wronskian W3 f, y4 
to obtain the reduction of order formula.
There are no techniques for obtaining explicit, closed-form solutions to second-order linear 
differential equations with variable coefficients (with certain exceptions) or for nonlinear equa-
tions. In general, we will have to settle for numerical solutions or power series expansions. So 
it would be helpful to be able to derive, with simple calculations, some nonrigorous, qualita-
tive conclusions about the behavior of the solutions before we launch the heavy computational 
machinery. In this section we first display a few examples that illustrate the profound differ-
ences that can occur when the equations have variable coefficients or are nonlinear. Then we 
show how the mass–spring analogy, discussed in Section 4.1, can be exploited to predict some 
of the attributes of solutions of these more complicated equations.
To begin our discussion we display a linear constant-coefficient, a linear variable-coefficient, 
and two nonlinear equations.
4.8  Qualitative Considerations for Variable-Coefficient 
and Nonlinear Equations

202          Chapter 4    Linear Second-Order Equations
(a)	 The equation
(1)	
3y″ + 2y′ + 4y = 0
is linear, homogeneous with constant coefficients. We know everything about such 
equations; the solutions are, at worst, polynomials times exponentials times sinusoids 
in t, and unique solutions can be found to match any prescribed data y1a2, y′1a2 at 
any instant t = a. It has the superposition property: If y11t2 and y21t2 are solutions, 
so is y1t2 = c1y11t2 + c2y21t2.
(b)	 The equation
(2)	
11 −t22y″ −2ty′ + 2y = 0
also has the superposition property (Problem 30, Exercises 4.7). It is a linear  
variable-coefficient equation and is a special case of Legendre’s equation 
11 - t22y″ - 2ty′ + ly = 0, which arises in the analysis of wave and diffusion  
phenomena in spherical coordinates.
(c)	 The equations
(3)	
 y″ - 6y2 = 0 ,
(4)	
 y″ - 24y1>3 = 0
do not share the superposition property because of the square and the cube root 
of y terms (e.g., the quadratic term y2 does not reduce to y2
1 + y2
2). They are 
nonlinear†equations.
The Legendre equation (2) has one simple solution, y11t2 = t, as can easily be verified by 
mental calculation. A second, linearly independent, solution for -1 6 t 6 1 can be derived by 
the reduction of order procedure of Section 4.7. Traditionally, the second solution is taken to be
(5)	
y21t2 = t
2 lna 1 + t
1 - tb - 1 .
Notice in particular the behavior near t = {1; none of the solutions of our constant-coefficient 
equations ever diverged at a finite point!
We would have anticipated troublesome behavior for (2) at t = {1 if we had rewritten it 
in standard form as
(6)	
y″ -
2t
1 - t2 y′ +
2
1 - t2 y = 0 ,
since Theorem 5, page 192, only promises existence and uniqueness between these points.
As we have noted, there are no general solution procedures for solving nonlin-
ear equations. However, the following lemma is very useful in some situations such as 
equations (3), (4). It has an extremely significant physical interpretation, which we will 
explore in Project D of Chapter 5; for now we will merely tantalize the reader by giving 
it a suggestive name.
†Although the quadratic y2 renders equation (3) nonlinear, the occurrence of t2 in (2) does not spoil its linearity (in y).

As a result, an equation of the form (7) can be reduced to
(10)

 1y′22 - F1y2 = K ,
for some constant K, which is equivalent to the separable first-order equation

(11)	
t = {

We will use formula (11) to illustrate some startling features of nonlinear equations.
The Energy Integral Lemma
Lemma 4.	
Let y1t2 be a solution to the differential equation
(7)	
y″ = f1y2 ,
where f1y2 is a continuous function that does not depend on y′ or the independent  
variable t. Let F1y2 be an indefinite integral of f1y2, that is,
f1y2 = d
dy F1y2 .
Then the quantity
(8)	
E1t2 J 1
2
 y′1t22 - F1y1t22
is constant; i.e.,
(9)	
d
dt
 E1t2 = 0 .

204          Chapter 4    Linear Second-Order Equations
Solution
Since 6y2 = d
dy
 12y32, the solution form (11) becomes
t = {
L
dy
223y3 + K4
+ c .
For simplicity we take the plus sign and focus attention on solutions with K = 0. Then we find 
t = 1 1
2 y-3>2 dy = -y-1>2 + c, or
(12)	
y1t2 = 1c - t2-2 ,
for any value of the constant c.
Clearly, this equation is an enigma; solutions can blow up at t = 1, t = 2, t = p, 
or anywhere—and there is no clue in equation (3) as to why this should happen! More-
over, we have found an infinite family of pairwise linearly independent solutions (rather 
than the expected two). Yet we still cannot assemble, out of these, a solution matching (say) 
y102 = 1, y′102 = 3; all our solutions (12) have y′102 = 2y1023>2, and the absence of a 
superposition principle voids the use of linear combinations c1y11t2 + c2y21t2.  ◆
Example 2
Apply the energy integral lemma to explore the solutions of the nonlinear equation y″ = 24y1>3, 
given in (4).
Solution
Since 24y1>3 = d
dy118y4>32, formula (11) gives
t = {
L
dy
22318y4>3 + K4
+ c .
Again we take the plus sign and focus attention on solutions with K = 0. Then we find 
t = y1>3>2 + c. In particular, y11t2 = 8t3 is a solution, and it satisfies the initial conditions 
y102 = 0, y′102 = 0. But note that y21t2 K 0 is also a solution to (4), and it satisfies the 
same initial conditions! Hence, the uniqueness feature, guaranteed for linear equations by 
Theorem 5 on page 192 of Section 4.7, can fail in the nonlinear case.  ◆
So these examples have demonstrated violations of the existence and uniqueness proper-
ties (as well as “finiteness”) that we have come to expect from the constant-coefficient case. It 
should not be surprising, then, that the solution techniques for variable-coefficient and nonlin-
ear second-order equations are more complicated—when, indeed, they exist. Recall, however, 
that in Section 4.3 we saw that our familiarity with the mass–spring oscillator equation
(13)	
 Fext = 3inertia4y″ + 3damping4y′ + 3stiffness4y
	
 = my″ + by′ + ky
was helpful in picturing the qualitative features of the solutions of other constant-coefficient 
equations. (See Figure 4.1, page 152.) By pushing these analogies further, we can also antici-
pate some of the features of the solutions in the variable-coefficient and nonlinear cases. One of 
the simplest linear second-order differential equations with variable coefficients is
(14)	
y″ + ty = 0 .
Example 1
Apply the energy integral lemma to explore the solutions of the nonlinear equation y″ = 6y2, 
given in (3).

Figure 4.12 Solution to equation (14)
Example 3
Using the mass–spring analogy, predict the nature of the solutions to equation (14) for t 7 0.
Solution
Comparing (13) with (14), we see that the latter equation describes a mass–spring oscillator 
where the spring stiffness “k” varies in time—in fact, it stiffens as time passes [“k” = t in 
equation (14)]. Physically, then, we would expect to see oscillations whose frequency increases 
with time, while the amplitude of the oscillations diminishes (because the spring gets harder to 
stretch). The numerically computed solution in Figure 4.12 displays precisely this behavior.  ◆
Remark  Schemes for numerically computing solutions to second-order equations will be dis-
cussed in Section 5.3. If such schemes are available, then why is there a need for the qualitative anal-
ysis discussed in this section? The answer is that numerical methods provide only approximations to 
solutions of initial value problems, and their accuracy is sometimes difficult to predict (especially for 
nonlinear equations). For example, numerical methods are often ineffective near points of discontinu-
ity or over the long time intervals needed to study the asymptotic behavior. And this is precisely when 
qualitative arguments can lend insight into the reasonableness of the computed solution.
It is easy to verify (Problem 1) that if y1t2 is a solution of the Airy equation
(15)	
y″ - ty = 0 ,
then y1 -t2 solves y″ + ty = 0, so “Airy functions” exhibit the behavior shown in Figure 4.12 
for negative time. For positive t the Airy equation has a negative stiffness “k” = -t, with 
magnitude increasing in time. As we observed in Example 5 of Section 4.3, negative stiff-
ness tends to reinforce, rather than oppose, displacements, and the solutions y1t2 grow rap-
idly with (positive) time. The solution known as the Airy function of the second kind Bi1t2, 
depicted in Figure 4.13, behaves exactly as expected.

Apply the mass–spring analogy to predict qualitative features of solutions to Bessel’s equation 
for t 7 0.
t
Y1/2(t)
J1/2(t)
Figure 4.14 Bessel functions
Solution
Comparing (16) with the paradigm (13), we observe that
•	 the inertia “m” = 1 is fixed at unity;
•	 there is positive damping 1“b” = 1>t2, although it weakens with time; and
•	 the stiffness 1“k” = 1 - n2>t22 is positive when t 7 n and tends to 1 as t S + ∞.
Solutions, then, should be expected to oscillate with amplitudes that diminish slowly (due to 
the damping), and the frequency of the oscillations should settle at a constant value (given, 
according to the procedures of Section 4.3, by 2k>m = 1 radian per unit time). The graphs 
of the Bessel functions Jn1t2 and Yn1t2 of the first and second kind of order n = 1
2 exemplify 
these qualitative predictions; see Figure 4.14. The effect of the singularities in the coefficients 
at t = 0 is manifested in the graph of Y1>21t2.  ◆
Although most Bessel functions have to be computed by power series methods, if 
the order n is a half-integer, then Jn1t2 and Yn1t2 have closed-form expressions. In fact, 
J1>21t2 = 22>1pt2 sin t and Y1>21t2 = - 22>1pt2 cos t. You can verify directly that these 
functions solve equation (16).
In Section 4.3 we also pointed out that mass–spring systems with negative spring stiffness 
can have isolated bounded solutions if the initial displacement y102 and velocity y′102 are 
precisely selected to counteract the repulsive spring force. The Airy function of the first kind 
Ai1t2, also depicted in Figure 4.13, is such a solution for the “Airy spring”; the initial inwardly 
directed velocity is just adequate to overcome the outward push of the stiffening spring, and the 
mass approaches a delicate equilibrium state y1t2 K 0.
Now let’s look at Bessel’s equation. It arises in the analysis of wave or diffusion phenom-
ena in cylindrical coordinates. The Bessel equation of order n is written
(16)	
y″ + 1
t
 y′ + a1 −n2
t2 by = 0 .
Clearly, there are irregularities at t = 0, analogous to those at t = {1 for the Legendre 
equation (2); we will explore these in depth in Chapter 8.

Example 5
Give a qualitative analysis of the modified Bessel equation of order n:
(17)	
y″ + 1

Solution
This equation also exhibits unit mass and positive, diminishing, damping. However, the stiffness 
now converges to negative 1. Accordingly, we expect typical solutions to diverge as t S + ∞. 
The modified Bessel function of the first kind, In1t2 of order n = 2 in Figure 4.15 follows this 
prediction, whereas the modified Bessel function of the second kind, Kn1t2 of order n = 2 in 
Figure 4.15, exhibits the same sort of balance of initial position and velocity as we saw for the 
Airy function Ai1t2. Again, the effect of the singularity at t = 0 is evident.  ◆
Example 6
Use the mass–spring model to predict qualitative features of the solutions to the nonlinear 
Duffing equation
(18)	
y″ + y + y3 = y″ + 11 + y22y = 0 .
Solution
Although equation (18) is nonlinear, it can be matched with the paradigm (13) if we envision 
unit mass, no damping, and a (positive) stiffness “k” = 1 + y2, which increases as the dis-
placement y gets larger. (This increasing-stiffness effect is built into some popular mattresses 
for therapeutic reasons.)† Such a spring grows stiffer as the mass moves farther away, but it 
restores to its original value when the mass returns. Thus, high-amplitude excursions should 
oscillate faster than low-amplitude ones, and the sinusoidal shapes in the graphs of y1t2 should 
be “pinched in” somewhat at their peaks. These qualitative predictions are demonstrated by the 
numerically computed solutions plotted in Figure 4.16.  ◆

Predict the behavior of the solutions to equation (19) using the mass–spring model.
Solution
By comparison to the paradigm (13), we observe unit mass and stiffness, positive damping 
3“b” = -11 - y224 when 0 y1t2 0 7 1, and negative damping when 0 y1t2 0 6 1. Friction thus 
dampens large-amplitude motions but energizes small oscillations. The result, then, is that all 
(nonzero) solutions tend to a limit cycle whose friction penalty incurred while 0 y1t2 0 7 1 is 
balanced by the negative-friction boost received while 0 y1t2 0 6 1. The computer-generated 
Figure 4.17 illustrates the convergence to the limit cycle for some solutions to the van der Pol 
equation†.  ◆
Finally, we consider the motion of the pendulum depicted in Figure 4.18. This motion is 
measured by the angle u1t2 that the pendulum makes with the vertical line through O at time t. 
As the diagram shows, the component of gravity, which exerts a torque on the pendulum and 
thus accelerates the angular velocity du>dt, is given by -mg sin u. Consequently, the rotational 
analog of Newton’s second law, torque equals rate of change of angular momentum, dictates

graph of u1t2, and lowers the frequency. This is evident in Figure 4.21 on page 210.

The computation of the solutions of the Legendre, Bessel, and Airy equations and the 
analysis of the nonlinear equations of Duffing, van der Pol, and the pendulum have challenged 
many of the great mathematicians of the past. It is gratifying, then, to note that so many of their 
salient features are susceptible to the qualitative reasoning we have used herein.

17.	 Armageddon.  Earth revolves around the sun in an 
approximately circular orbit with radius r = a, complet-
ing a revolution in the time T = 2p1a3>GM21>2, which 
is one Earth year; here M is the mass of the sun and G 
is the universal gravitational constant. The gravitational 
force of the sun on Earth is given by GMm>r2, where m 
is the mass of Earth. Therefore, if Earth “stood still,” los-
ing its orbital velocity, it would fall on a straight line into 
the sun in accordance with Newton’s second law:
md 2r
dt 2 = - GMm
r 2  .
If this calamity occurred, what fraction of the normal 
year T would it take for Earth to splash into the sun (i.e., 
achieve r = 0)? [Hint: Use the energy integral lemma 
and the initial conditions r102 = a, r′102 = 0.]
In this section we return to the mass–spring system depicted in Figure 4.1 (page 152) and ana-
lyze its motion in more detail. The governing equation is
(1)	
 Fext = 3inertia4 d2y
dt2 + 3damping4 dy
dt + 3stiffness4y
 = my″ + by′ + ky .
Let’s focus on the simple case in which b = 0 and Fext = 0, the so-called undamped, 
free case. Then equation (1) reduces to
(2)	
m d2y
dt2 + ky = 0
and, when divided by m, becomes
(3)	
d2y
dt2 + V2y = 0 ,
where v = 2k>m. The auxiliary equation associated with (3) is r2 + v2 = 0, which has 
complex conjugate roots {vi. Hence, a general solution to (3) is
(4)	
y1t2 = C1 cos Vt + C2 sin Vt .
We can express y1t2 in the more convenient form
(5)	
y1t2 = A sin1Vt + F2 ,
with A Ú 0, by letting C1 = A sin f and C2 = A cos f. That is,
 A sin1vt + f2 = A cos vt sin f + A sin vt cos f
 = C1 cos vt + C2 sin vt .

Section 4.9    A Closer Look at Free Mechanical Vibrations          213
Solving for A and f in terms of C1 and C2, we find
(6)	
A = 2C2
1 + C2
2    and    tan F = C1
C2
 ,
where the quadrant in which f lies is determined by the signs of C1 and C2. This is because sin f 
has the same sign as C1 1sin f = C1>A2 and cos f has the same sign as C2 1cos f = C2>A2. 
For example, if C1 7 0 and C2 6 0, then f is in Quadrant II. (Note, in particular, that f is not 
simply the arctangent of C1>C2, which would lie in Quadrant IV.)
It is evident from (5) that, as we predicted in Section 4.1, the motion of a mass in an 
undamped, free system is simply a sine wave, or what is called simple harmonic motion. 
(See Figure 4.27.) The constant A is the amplitude of the motion and f is the phase angle. The 
motion is periodic with period 2p>v and natural frequency v>2p, where v = 2k>m. The 
period is measured in units of time, and the natural frequency has the dimensions of periods (or 
cycles) per unit time. The constant v is the angular frequency for the sine function in (5) and 
has dimensions of radians per unit time. To summarize:
angular frequency = v = 2k>m 1rad/sec2 ,
natural frequency = v>2p 1cycles/sec2 ,
period = 2p>v 1sec2 .
Observe that the amplitude and phase angle depend on the constants C1 and C2, which, in 
turn, are determined by the initial position and initial velocity of the mass. However, the period 
and frequency depend only on k and m and not on the initial conditions.

Figure 4.27 Simple harmonic motion of undamped, free vibrations
Example 1
A 1>8-kg mass is attached to a spring with stiffness k = 16 N/m, as depicted in Figure 4.1.  
The mass is displaced 1>2 m to the right of the equilibrium point and given an outward 
velocity (to the right) of 22 m/sec. Neglecting any damping or external forces that may be 
present, determine the equation of motion of the mass along with its amplitude, period, and 
natural frequency. How long after release does the mass pass through the equilibrium position?
Solution
Because we have a case of undamped, free vibration, the equation governing the motion is (3). 
Thus, we find the angular frequency to be
v = A
k
m = A
16
1>8 = 822 rad /sec .
Substituting this value for v into (4) gives
(7)	
y1t2 = C1 cos1822 t2 + C2 sin1822 t2 .

214          Chapter 4    Linear Second-Order Equations
Now we use the initial conditions, y102 = 1>2 m and y′102 = 22 m/sec, to solve for C1 
and C2 in (7). That is,
 1>2 = y102 = C1 ,
 22 = y′102 = 822C2 ,
and so C1 = 1>2 and C2 = 1>8. Hence, the equation of motion of the mass is
(8)	
y1t2 = 1
2 cos1822 t2 + 1
8 sin1822 t2 .
To express y1t2 in the alternative form (5), we set

2 = 211>222 + 11>822 = 217

 ,
 tan f = C1
C2
=
1>2
1>8 = 4 .
Since both C1 and C2 are positive, f is in Quadrant I, so f = arctan 4 ≈1.326. Hence,
(9)	
y1t2 = 217
8
 sin1822 t + f2 .
Thus, the amplitude A is 217>8 m, and the phase angle f is approximately 1.326 rad. The 
period is P = 2p>v = 2p>18222 = 22p>8 sec, and the natural frequency is 1>P =
8>1 22p2 cycles per sec.
Finally, to determine when the mass will pass through the equilibrium position, y = 0, we 
must solve the trigonometric equation
(10)	
y1t2 = 217

 sin1822 t + f2 = 0
for t. Equation (10) will be satisfied whenever

In most applications of vibrational analysis, of course, there is some type of frictional or 
damping force affecting the vibrations. This force may be due to a component in the system, such 
as a shock absorber in a car, or to the medium that surrounds the system, such as air or some liquid. 
So we turn to a study of the effects of damping on free vibrations, and equation (2) generalizes to
(12)	
m d2y
dt2 + b dy
dt + ky = 0 .
The auxiliary equation associated with (12) is
(13)	
mr2 + br + k = 0 ,
and its roots are

As we found in Sections 4.2 and 4.3, the form of the solution to (12) depends on the nature 
of these roots and, in particular, on the discriminant b2 - 4mk.
Underdamped or Oscillatory Motion (b2 * 4mk)
When b2 6 4mk, the discriminant b2 - 4mk is negative, and there are two complex conjugate 
roots to the auxiliary equation (13). These roots are a { ib, where
(15)	
a J - b
2m , b J

2m 24mk - b2 .
Hence, a general solution to (12) is
(16)	
y1t2 = eat1C1 cos bt + C2 sin bt2 .
As we did with simple harmonic motion, we can express y1t2 in the alternate form
(17)	
y1t2 = Aeat sin1bt + f2 ,
where A = 2C 2
1 + C 2
2 and tan f = C1>C2. It is now evident that y1t2 is the product of an 
exponential damping factor,
Aeat = Ae-1b>2m2t ,
and a sine factor, sin1bt + f2, which accounts for the oscillatory motion. Because the sine 
factor varies between –1 and 1 with period 2p>b, the solution y1t2 varies between -Aeat and 
Aeat with quasiperiod P = 2p>b = 4mp> 24mk - b2 and quasifrequency 1>P. Moreover, 
since b and m are positive, a = -b>2m is negative, and thus the exponential factor tends to 
zero as t S + ∞. A graph of a typical solution y1t2 is given in Figure 4.28. The system is 
called underdamped because there is not enough damping present (b is too small) to prevent 
the system from oscillating.
It is easily seen that as b S 0 the damping factor approaches the constant A and the quasi-
frequency approaches the natural frequency of the corresponding undamped harmonic motion. 
Figure 4.28 demonstrates that the values of t where the graph of y1t2 touches the exponential 
curves {Aeat are close to (but not exactly) the same values of t at which y1t2 attains its rela-
tive maximum and minimum values (see Problem 13 on page 221).

Overdamped Motion (b2 + 4mk)
When b2 7 4mk, the discriminant b2 - 4mk is positive, and there are two distinct real roots to 
the auxiliary equation (13):
(18)	
r1 = - b
2m + 1
2m 2b2 - 4mk , r2 = - b
2m - 1
2m 2b2 - 4mk .
Hence, a general solution to (12) in this case is
(19)	
y1t2 = C1er1t + C2er2t .
Obviously, r2 is negative. And since b2 7 b2 - 4mk (that is, b 7 2b2 - 4mk  ), it follows that r1 
is also negative. Therefore, as t S + ∞, both of the exponentials in (19) decay and y1t2 S 0. 
Moreover, since
y′1t2 = C1r1er1t + C2r2er2t = er1t1C1r1 + C2r2e1r2-r12t2 ,
we see that the derivative is either identically zero (when C1 = C2 = 0) or vanishes for at 
most one value of t (when the factor in parentheses is zero). If the trivial solution y1t2 K 0 is 
ignored, it follows that y1t2 has at most one local maximum or minimum for t 7 0. Therefore, 
y1t2 does not oscillate. This leaves, qualitatively, only three possibilities for the motion of y1t2, 
depending on the initial conditions. These are illustrated in Figure 4.29. This case where b2 7 4mk 
is called overdamped motion.
Critically Damped Motion (b2 = 4mk)
When b2 = 4mk, the discriminant b2 - 4mk is zero, and the auxiliary equation has the repeated 
root -b>2m. Hence, a general solution to (12) is now
(20)	
y1t2 = 1C1 + C2t2e-1b>2m2t .
To understand the motion described by y1t2 in (20), we first consider the behavior of y1t2 
as t S  + ∞. By L’Hôpital’s rule,

(recall that b>2m 7 0). Hence, y1t2 dies off to zero as t S + ∞. Next, since
y′1t2 = aC2 - b
2m
 C1 - b
2m
 C2tbe-1b>2m2t ,
we see again that a nontrivial solution can have at most one local maximum or minimum for  
t 7 0, so motion is nonoscillatory. If b were any smaller, oscillation would occur. Thus, the 
special case where b2 = 4mk is called critically damped motion. Qualitatively, critically 
damped motions are similar to overdamped motions (see Figure 4.29 again).

Find the equation of motion and sketch its graph for the three cases where b = 6, 10, and 12.

(23)	
r 2 + br + 25 = 0 ,
whose roots are
(24)	
r = - b
2 { 1
2 2b2 - 100 .
Case 1.  When b = 6, the roots (24) are -3 { 4i. This is thus a case of underdamping, 
and the equation of motion has the form
(25)	
y1t2 = C1e-3t cos 4t + C2e-3t sin 4t .
Setting y102 = 1 and y′102 = 0 gives the system
C1 = 1 , -3C1 + 4C2 = 0 ,
whose solution is C1 = 1, C2 = 3>4. To express y1t2 as the product of a damping factor and a 
sine factor [recall equation (17)], we set
A = 2C 2
1 + C 2
2 = 5

where f is a Quadrant I angle, since C1 and C2 are both positive. Then

where f = arctan14>32 ≈0.9273. The underdamped spring motion is shown in Figure 4.30(a) 
on page 218.
Case 2.  When b = 10, there is only one (repeated) root to the auxiliary equation (23), 
namely, r = -5. This is a case of critical damping, and the equation of motion has the form
(27)	
y1t2 = 1C1 + C2t2e-5t .
Setting y102 = 1 and y′102 = 0 now gives
C1 = 1 , C2 - 5C1 = 0 ,
and so C1 = 1, C2 = 5. Thus,
(28)	
y1t2 = 11 + 5t2e-5t .

The graph of y1t2 given in (28) is represented by the lower curve in Figure 4.30(b). Notice that 
y1t2 is zero only for t = -1>5 and hence does not cross the t-axis for t 7 0.
Case 3.  When b = 12, the roots to the auxiliary equation are -6 { 211. This is a case 
of overdamping, and the equation of motion has the form
(29)	
y1t2 = C1e1-6+2112t + C2e1-6- 2112t .
Setting y102 = 1 and y′102 = 0 gives
C1 + C2 = 1 , 1 -6 + 2112C1 + 1 -6 - 2112C2 = 0 ,
from which we find C1 = 111 + 62112>22 and C2 = 111 - 62112>22. Hence,

The graph of this overdamped motion is represented by the upper curve in Figure 4.30(b).  ◆
It is interesting to observe in Example 2 that when the system is underdamped 1b = 62, 
the solution goes to zero like e-3t; when the system is critically damped 1b = 102, the solution 
tends to zero roughly like e-5t; and when the system is overdamped 1b = 122, the solution 
goes to zero like e1-6+2112t ≈e-2.68t. This means that if the system is underdamped, it not only 
oscillates but also dies off slower than if it were critically damped. Moreover, if the system is 
overdamped, it again dies off more slowly than if it were critically damped (in agreement with 
our physical intuition that the damping forces hinder the return to equilibrium).

Example 3
A 1>4-kg mass is attached to a spring with a stiffness 4 N/m as shown in Figure 4.31(a). The 
damping constant b for the system is 1 N-sec/m. If the mass is displaced 1>2 m to the left and 
given an initial velocity of 1 m/sec to the left, find the equation of motion. What is the maxi-
mum displacement that the mass will attain?
Solution
Substituting the values for m, b, and k into equation (12) and enforcing the initial conditions, 
we obtain the initial value problem

To determine the maximum displacement from equilibrium, we must determine the maxi-
mum value of 0 y1t2 0  on the graph in Figure 4.31(b). Because y1t2 dies off exponentially, this 
will occur at the first critical point of y1t2. Computing y′1t2 from (32), setting it equal to zero, 
and solving gives
 y′1t2 = e-2te 5

Substituting this value for t back into equation (32) or (33) gives y10.0962 ≈-0.55. Hence, the

We now consider the vibrations of a mass–spring system when an external force is applied. 
Of particular interest is the response of the system to a sinusoidal forcing term. As a para-
digm, let’s investigate the effect of a cosine forcing function on the system governed by the 
­differential equation
(1)	
m d2y
dt2 + b dy
dt + ky = F0 cos Gt ,
where F0 and g are nonnegative constants and 0 6 b2 6 4mk (so the system is underdamped).
A solution to (1) has the form y = yh + yp, where yp is a particular solution and yh is a 
general solution to the corresponding homogeneous equation. We found in equation (17) of 
Section 4.9 that
(2)	
yh1t2 = Ae-1b>2m2t sina 24mk - b2
2m
 t + fb ,
where A and f are constants.
To determine yp, we can use the method of undetermined coefficients (Section 4.4). From 
the form of the nonhomogeneous term, we know that
(3)	
yp1t2 = A1 cos gt + A2 sin gt ,
where A1 and A2 are constants to be determined. Substituting this expression into equation (1) 
and simplifying gives
(4)	
3 1k - mg22 A1 + bgA24cos gt + 3 1k - mg22A2 - bgA14sin gt = F0 cos gt .
Setting the corresponding coefficients on both sides equal, we have
 1k - mg22A1 + bgA2 = F0 ,
 -bgA1 + 1k - mg22A2 = 0 .
4.10  A Closer Look at Forced Mechanical Vibrations

222          Chapter 4    Linear Second-Order Equations
Solving, we obtain
(5)	
A1 =
F01k - mg22
1k - mg222 + b2g2 , A2 =
F0bg
1k - mg222 + b2g2 .
Hence, a particular solution to (1) is
(6)	
yp1t2 =
F0
1k - mg222 + b2g23 1k - mg22cos gt + bg sin gt4.
The expression in brackets can also be written as
21k - mg222 + b 2g2 sin1gt + u2 ,
so we can express yp in the alternative form
(7)	
yp1t2 =
F0
21k - mg 222 + b 2g2
  sin1gt + u2 ,
where tan u = A1>A2 = 1k - mg 22>1bg2 and the quadrant in which u lies is determined by 
the signs of A1 and A2.
Combining equations (2) and (7), we have the following representation of a general 
­solution to (1) in the case 0 6 b2 6 4mk:
(8)	
y1t2 = Ae-1b>2m2t sina 24mk - b 2
2m
 t + fb +
F0
21k - mg 222 + b 2g 2
  sin1gt + u2 .
The solution (8) is the sum of two terms. The first term, yh, represents damped oscillation and 
depends only on the parameters of the system and the initial conditions. Because of the damp-
ing factor Ae-1b>2m2t, this term tends to zero as t S + ∞. Consequently, it is referred to as the 
transient part of the solution. The second term, yp, in (8) is the offspring of the external forcing 
function f1t2 = F0 cos gt. Like the forcing function, yp is a sinusoid with angular frequency g. 
It is the synchronous solution that we anticipated in Section 4.1. However, yp is out of phase 
with f1t2 (by the angle u - p>2), and its magnitude is different by the factor
(9)	
1
21k - mg222 + b2g2 
  .
As the transient term dies off, the motion of the mass–spring system becomes essentially that 
of the second term yp (see Figure 4.32, page 223). Hence, this term is called the steady-state 
solution. The factor appearing in (9) is referred to as the frequency gain, or gain factor, since 
it represents the ratio of the magnitude of the sinusoidal response to that of the input force. 
Note that this factor depends on the frequency g and has units of length/force.
Example 1
A 10-kg mass is attached to a spring with stiffness k = 49 N/m. At time t = 0, an external 
force f1t2 = 20 cos 4t N is applied to the system. The damping constant for the system is  
3 N-sec/m. Determine the steady-state solution for the system.
Solution
Substituting the given parameters into equation (1), we obtain
(10)	
10 d2y
dt2 + 3 dy
dt + 49y = 20 cos 4t ,
where y1t2 is the displacement (from equilibrium) of the mass at time t.

Figure 4.32 Convergence of y1t2 to the steady-state solution yp1t2 when m = 4, b = 6, k = 3, F0 = 2, g = 4
To find the steady-state response, we must produce a particular solution to (10) that is a sinu-
soid. We can do this using the method of undetermined coefficients, guessing a solution of the 
form A1 cos 4t +  A2 sin 4t. But this is precisely how we derived equation (7). Thus, we substitute 
directly into (7) and find
(11)	
yp1t2 =
20
2149 - 16022 + 1921162
 sin14t + u2 ≈10.182 sin14t + u2 ,
where tan u = 149 - 1602>12 ≈-9.25. Since the numerator, 149 - 1602, is negative and the 
denominator, 12, is positive, u is a Quadrant IV angle. Thus,
u ≈arctan1 -9.252 ≈-1.46 ,
and the steady-state solution is given (approximately) by
(12)	
yp1t2 = 10.182 sin14t - 1.462 .  ◆
The above example illustrates an important point made earlier: The steady-state response 
(12) to the sinusoidal forcing function 20 cos 4t is a sinusoid of the same frequency but different 
amplitude. The gain factor [see (9)] in this case is 10.182>20 = 0.009 m/N.
In general, the amplitude of the steady-state solution to equation (1) depends on the angular 
frequency g of the forcing function and is given by A1g2 = F0M1g2, where
(13)	
M1g2 J
1
21k - mg222 + b2g2
is the frequency gain [see (9)]. This formula is valid even when b2 Ú 4mk. For a given system (m, 
b, and k fixed), it is often of interest to know how this system reacts to sinusoidal inputs of various 
frequencies (g is a variable). For this purpose the graph of the gain M1g2, called the frequency 
response curve, or resonance curve, for the system, is enlightening.

224          Chapter 4    Linear Second-Order Equations
To sketch the frequency response curve, we first observe that for g = 0 we find 
M102 = 1>k. Of course, g = 0 implies the force F0 cos gt is static; there is no motion in 
the steady state, so this value of M102 is appropriate. Also note that as g S ∞ the gain 
M1g2 S 0; the inertia of the system limits the extent to which it can respond to extremely 
rapid vibrations. As a further aid in describing the graph, we compute from (13)
(14)	
M′1g2 = - 
2m2gc g2 - a k
m - b2
2m2 b d
3 1k - mg222 + b2g243>2  .
It follows from (14) that M′1g2 = 0 if and only if
(15)	
g = 0 or g = gr J B
k
m - b2
2m2 .
Now when the system is overdamped or critically damped, so b2 Ú 4mk 7 2mk, the term 
inside the radical in (15) is negative, and hence M′1g2 = 0 only when g = 0. In this case, 
as g increases from 0 to infinity, M1g2 decreases from M102 = 1>k to a limiting value of 
zero.
When b2 6 2mk (which implies the system is underdamped), then gr is real and positive, 
and it is easy to verify that M1g2 has a maximum at gr. Substituting gr into (13) gives
(16)	
M1gr2 =
1>b
B
k
m - b2
4m2
 .
The value gr>2p is called the resonance frequency for the system. When the system is 
­stimulated by an external force at this frequency, it is said to be at resonance.
To illustrate the effect of the damping constant b on the resonance curve, we consider a 
system in which m = k = 1. In this case the frequency response curves are given by
(17)	
M1g2 =
1
211 - g222 + b2g2 
 ,
and, for b 6 22, the resonance frequency is gr>2p = 11>2p2 21 - b2>2. Figure 4.33 
­displays the graphs of these frequency response curves for b = 1>4, 1>2, 1, 3>2, and 
2. Observe that as b S 0 the maximum magnitude of the frequency gain increases and the  
resonance frequency gr>2p for the damped system approaches 2k>m>2p = 1>2p, the natu-
ral frequency for the undamped system.
To understand what is occurring, consider the undamped system 1b = 02 with forcing 
term F0 cos gt. This system is governed by
(18)	
m d2y
dt2 + ky = F0 cos gt .
A general solution to (18) is the sum of a particular solution and a general solution to the 
homogeneous equation. In Section 4.9 we showed that the latter describes simple harmonic 
motion:
(19)	
yh1t2 = A sin1vt + f2 ,  v J 2k>m .
The formula for the particular solution given in (7) is valid for b = 0, provided g ≠v = 2k>m. 
However, when b = 0 and g = v, then the form we used with undetermined coefficients 

Section 4.10    A Closer Look at Forced Mechanical Vibrations          225
to derive (7) does not work because cos vt and sin vt are solutions to the corresponding 
­homogeneous equation. The correct form is
(20)	
yp1t2 = A1t cos vt + A2t sin vt ,
which leads to the solution
(21)	
yp1t2 =
F0
2mV
 t sin Vt .
[The verification of (21) is straightforward.] Hence, in the undamped resonant case (when 
g = v), a general solution to (18) is
(22)	
y1t2 = A sin1vt + f2 +
F0
2mv
 t sin vt .
Returning to the question of resonance, observe that the particular solution in (21) oscillates 
between {1F0t2>12mv2. Hence, as t S + ∞ the maximum magnitude of (21) approaches ∞ 
(see Figure 4.34 on page 226).
It is obvious from the above discussion that if the damping constant b is very small, 
the system is subject to large oscillations when the forcing function has a frequency near 
the resonance frequency for the system. It is these large vibrations at resonance that con-
cern engineers. Indeed, resonance vibrations have been known to cause airplane wings to snap, 
bridges to collapse,† and (less catastrophically) wine glasses to shatter.

When the mass–spring system is hung vertically as in Figure 4.35, the force of gravity 
must be taken into account. This is accomplished very easily. With y measured downward from 
the unstretched spring position, the governing equation is
my″ + by′ + ky = mg ,
and if the right-hand side is recognized as a sinusoidal forcing term with frequency zero 
1mg cos 0t2, then the synchronous steady-state response is a constant, which is easily seen to 
be yp1t2 = mg>k. Now if we redefine y1t2 to be measured from this (true) equilibrium level, 
as indicated in Figure 4.35(c),
ynew1t2 J y1t2 - mg>k ,
then the governing equation
my″ + by′ + ky = mg + Fext1t2

yp1t2 =

Thus, the gravitational force can be ignored if y1t2 is measured from the equilibrium position. 
Adopting this convention, we drop the “new” subscript hereafter.
Example 3
A 64-lb weight is attached to a vertical spring, causing it to stretch 3 in. upon coming to 
rest at equilibrium. The damping constant for the system is 3 lb-sec/ft. An external force 
F1t2 = 3 cos 12t lb is applied to the weight. Find the steady-state solution for the system.
Solution
If a weight of 64 lb stretches a spring by 3 in. (0.25 ft), then the spring stiffness must be 
64>0.25 = 256 lb/ft. Thus, if we measured the displacement from the (true) equilibrium level, 
equation (23) becomes
(24)	
my″ + by′ + ky = 3 cos 12t ,
with b = 3 and k = 256. But recall that the unit of mass in the U.S. Customary System is the 
slug, which equals the weight divided by the gravitational acceleration constant g ≈32 ft/sec2 
(Table 3.2, page 110). Therefore, m in equation (24) is 64>32 = 2 slugs, and we have
2y″ + 3y′ + 256y = 3 cos 12t .
The steady-state solution is given by equation (6) with F0 = 3 and g = 12:
 yp1t2 =

­system at resonance governed by
d2y
dt2 + y = 5 cos t  ;
y102 = 0 ,  y′102 = 1 .
Sketch the solution.
5.	 An undamped system is governed by
m d2y
dt2 + ky = F0 cos gt  ;
y102 = y′102 = 0 ,
where g ≠v J 2k>m.
	
(a)	 Find the equation of motion of the system.
	
(b)	 Use trigonometric identities to show that the ­solution 
can be written in the form
y1t2 =
2F0
m1v2 - g22 sinav + g

 tb .
	
(c)	 When g is near v, then v - g is small, while v + g 
is relatively large compared with v - g. Hence, y1t2 
can be viewed as the product of a slowly varying 
sine function, sin31v - g2t>24, and a rapidly vary-
ing sine function, sin31v + g2t>24. The net effect 
is a sine function y1t2 with frequency 1v - g2>4p, 
which serves as the time-varying amplitude of a sine 
function with frequency 1v + g2>4p. This vibra-
tion phenomenon is referred to as beats and is used 
in tuning stringed instruments. This same phenom-
enon in electronics is called amplitude modulation. 
To illustrate this phenomenon, sketch the curve y1t2 
for F0 = 32, m = 2, v = 9, and g = 7.
6.	 Derive the formula for yp1t2 given in (21).

described as forced overdamped mass–spring systems. 
Derive an expression analogous to equation (8) for the 
general solution to the differential equation (1) when 
b2 7 4mk.
8.	 The response of an overdamped system to a constant force 
is governed by equation (1) with m = 2, b = 8, k = 6, 
F0 = 18, and g = 0. If the system starts from rest 
3y102 = y′102 = 04, compute and sketch the displace-
ment y1t2. What is the limiting value of y1t2 as t S + ∞? 
Interpret this physically.
9.	 An 8-kg mass is attached to a spring hanging from the 
ceiling, thereby causing the spring to stretch 1.96 m 
upon coming to rest at equilibrium. At time t = 0, an 
external force F1t2 = cos 2t N is applied to the system. 
The damping constant for the system is 3 N-sec/m. 
Determine the steady-state solution for the system.
10.	 Show that the period of the simple harmonic motion of a 
mass hanging from a spring is 2p2l>g, where l denotes 
the amount (beyond its natural length) that the spring is 
stretched when the mass is at equilibrium.
11.	 A mass weighing 8 lb is attached to a spring hanging 
from the ceiling and comes to rest at its equilibrium posi-
tion. At t = 0, an external force F1t2 = 2 cos 2t lb is 
applied to the system. If the spring constant is 10 lb/ft 
and the damping constant is 1 lb@sec/ft, find the equation 
of motion of the mass. What is the resonance frequency 
for the system?
12.	 A 2-kg mass is attached to a spring hanging from the 
ceiling, thereby causing the spring to stretch 20 cm 
upon coming to rest at equilibrium. At time t = 0, the 
mass is displaced 5 cm below the equilibrium position 
and released. At this same instant, an external force  
F1t2 = 0.3 cos t N is applied to the system. If the damp-
ing constant for the system is 5 N@sec/m, determine the 
equation of motion for the mass. What is the resonance 
frequency for the system?
13.	 A mass weighing 32 lb is attached to a spring hanging 
from the ceiling and comes to rest at its equilibrium posi-
tion. At time t = 0, an external force F1t2 = 3 cos 4t lb 
is applied to the system. If the spring constant is 5 lb/ft 
and the damping constant is 2 lb-sec/ft, find the steady-
state solution for the system.
14.	 An 8-kg mass is attached to a spring hanging from 
the ceiling and allowed to come to rest. Assume that 
the spring constant is 40 N/m and the damping con-
stant is 3 N-sec/m. At time t = 0, an external force of 
2 sin 12t + p>42 N is applied to the system. Deter-
mine the amplitude and frequency of the steady-state 
solution.
15.	 An 8-kg mass is attached to a spring hanging from the 
ceiling and allowed to come to rest. Assume that the 
spring constant is 40 N/m and the damping constant  
is 3 N-sec/m. At time t = 0, an external force of  
2 sin 2t cos 2t N is applied to the system. Determine the 
amplitude and frequency of the steady-state solution.
16.	 A helium-filled balloon on a cord, hanging y km above a 
level surface, is subjected to three forces:
	
(i)	
the (constant) buoyant force B exerted by the 
­external air pressure;
	
(ii)	 the weight of the balloon mg, where m is the mass 
of the balloon;
	
(iii)	 the weight of the part of the cord that has been lifted 
off the surface, dgy, where d is the linear density 
(kg /m) of the cord. (We assume that the cord is 
­longer than the elevation of the balloon.)
	 Express Newton’s second law for the balloon and show 
that it is exactly analogous to the governing equation for 
a mass vertically hung from a spring (page 226). Find 
the equation of motion. What is the frequency of the bal-
loon’s oscillations?

Chapter 4 Summary
In this chapter we discussed the theory of second-order linear differential equations and pre-
sented explicit solution methods for equations with constant coefficients. Much of the method-
ology can also be applied to the more general case of variable coefficients. We also studied the 
mathematical description of vibrating mechanical systems, and we saw how the mass–spring 
analogy could be used to predict qualitative features of solutions to some variable-coefficient 
and nonlinear equations.
The important features and solution techniques for the constant-coefficient case are listed below.
Homogeneous Linear Equations (Constant Coefficients)
ay″ + by′ + cy = 0,  a13 02, b, c constants.
Linearly Independent Solutions: y1, y2.  Two solutions y1 and y2 to the homogeneous equa-
tion on the interval I are said to be linearly independent on I if neither function is a constant 
times the other on I. This will be true provided their Wronskian,
W3y1, y241t2 J y11t2y=
21t2 - y=
11t2y21t2 ,
is different from zero for some (and hence all) t in I.
General Solution to Homogeneous Equation: c1y1 + c2y2.  If y1 and y2 are linearly 
­independent solutions to the homogeneous equation, then a general solution is
y1t2 = c1y11t2 + c2y21t2 ,
where c1 and c2 are arbitrary constants.
Form of General Solution.  The form of a general solution for a homogeneous equation with 
constant coefficients depends on the roots
r1 = -b + 2b2 - 4ac
2a
 ,  r2 = -b - 2b2 - 4ac
2a
of the auxiliary equation
ar2 + br + c = 0 ,  a ≠0 .
(a)	 When b2 - 4ac 7 0, the auxiliary equation has two distinct real roots r1 and r2 and a 
general solution is
y1t2 = c1er1t + c2er2t .
(b)	 When b2 - 4ac = 0, the auxiliary equation has a repeated real root r =  r1 = r2 and 
a general solution is
y1t2 = c1ert + c2tert .
(c)	 When b2 - 4ac 6 0, the auxiliary equation has complex conjugate roots r = a { ib 
and a general solution is
y1t2 = c1eat cos bt + c2eat sin bt .

230          Chapter 4    Linear Second-Order Equations
Nonhomogeneous Linear Equations (Constant Coefficients)
ay″ + by′ + cy = f1t2
General Solution to Nonhomogeneous Equation: yp + c1y1 + c2y2.  If yp is any particular 
solution to the nonhomogeneous equation and y1 and y2 are linearly independent solutions to 
the corresponding homogeneous equation, then a general solution is
y1t2 = yp1t2 + c1y11t2 + c2y21t2 ,
where c1 and c2 are arbitrary constants.
Two methods for finding a particular solution yp are those of undetermined coefficients and 
variation of parameters.
Undetermined Coefficients: f1t2 = pn1t2eAtecos Bt
sin Bt f.  If the right-hand side f1t2 of a 
­nonhomogeneous equation with constant coefficients is a polynomial pn1t2, an exponential of 
the form eat, a trigonometric function of the form cos bt or sin bt, or any product of these spe-
cial types of functions, then a particular solution of an appropriate form can be found. The form 
of the particular solution involves unknown coefficients and depends on whether a + ib is a 
root of the corresponding auxiliary equation. See the summary box on page 184. The unknown 
coefficients are found by substituting the form into the differential equation and equating coef-
ficients of like terms.
Variation of Parameters: y1t2 = V11t2y11t2 + V21t2y21t2.  If y1 and y2 are two linearly 
independent solutions to the corresponding homogeneous equation, then a particular solution 
to the nonhomogeneous equation is
y1t2 = v11t2y11t2 + v21t2y21t2 ,
where v=
1 and v=
2 are determined by the equations
v=
1y1 + v=
2y2 = 0
v=
1y=
1 + v=
2y=
2 = f 1t2>a  .
Superposition Principle.  If y1 and y2 are solutions to the equations
ay″ + by′ + cy = f1 and ay″ + by′ + cy = f2 ,
respectively, then k1y1 + k2y2 is a solution to the equation
ay″ + by′ + cy = k1  f1 + k2  f2 .
The superposition principle facilitates finding a particular solution when the nonhomogeneous 
term is the sum of nonhomogeneities for which particular solutions can be determined.
Cauchy–Euler (Equidimensional) Equations
at2y″ + bty′ + cy = f1t2
Substituting y = tr yields the associated characteristic equation
ar 2 + 1b - a2r + c = 0
for the corresponding homogeneous Cauchy–Euler equation. A general solution to the 
­homogeneous equation for t 7  0 is given by
	
(i)	 c1tr1 + c2 tr2, if r1 and r2 are distinct real roots;
	
(ii)	 c1tr + c2 tr ln t, if r is a repeated root;
	
(iii)	 c1ta cos1b ln t2 + c2 ta sin1b ln t2, if a + ib is a complex root.

Review Problems for Chapter 4          231
A general solution to the nonhomogeneous equation is y = yp + yh, where yp is a ­particular

of variation of parameters (but not the method of undetermined coefficients) can be used to find 
a particular solution.

Projects for Chapter 4
Certain nonlinear second-order equations—namely, those with dependent or independent 
­variables missing—can be solved by reducing them to a pair of first-order equations. This is 
accomplished by making the substitution w = dy>dx, where x is the independent variable.
(a)	 To solve an equation of the form y″ = F1x, y′2 in which the dependent variable y is 
missing, setting w = y′ (so that w′ = y″) yields the pair of equations
 w′ = F1x, w2 ,
 y′ = w .
Because w′ = F1x, w2 is a first-order equation, we have available the techniques of 
Chapter 2 to solve it for w1x2. Once w1x2 is determined, we integrate it to obtain y1x2.
Using this method, solve
2xy″ - y′ + 1
y′ = 0 ,  x 7 0 .
(b)	 To solve an equation of the form y″ = F1y, y′2 in which the independent variable x is 
missing, setting w = dy>dx yields, via the chain rule,
d2y
dx2 = dw
dx = dw
dy  dy
dx = w dw
dy  .
Thus, y″ = F1y, y′2 is equivalent to the pair of equations
(1)	
w dw
dy = F1y, w2 , 
(2)	
dy
dx = w .
In equation (1) notice that y plays the role of the independent variable; hence, solving 
it yields w1y2. Then substituting w1y2 into (2), we obtain a separable equation that 
­determines y1x2.
Using this method, solve the following equations:

Each time the Apollo astronauts returned from the moon circa 1970, they took great care to reenter 
Earth’s atmosphere along a path that was only a small angle a from the horizontal. (See Figure 4.37.) 
This was necessary in order to avoid intolerably large “g” forces during their reentry.
To appreciate their grounds for concern, consider the idealized problem
d2s
dt2 = -Kes >H ads
dt b
2 
,
where K and H are constants and distance s is measured downrange from some reference point 
on the trajectory, as shown in the figure. This approximate equation pretends that the only force 
on the capsule during reentry is air drag. For a bluff body such as the Apollo, drag is proportional 
to the square of the speed and to the local atmospheric density, which falls off exponentially with 
height. Intuitively, one might expect that the deceleration predicted by this model would depend 
heavily on the constant K (which takes into account the vehicle’s mass, area, etc.); but, remark-
ably, for capsules entering the atmosphere (at “s = - ∞”) with a common speed V0, the maxi-
mum deceleration turns out to be independent of K.
(a)	 Verify this last assertion by demonstrating that this maximum deceleration is just 
V2
0>12eH2. [Hint: The independent variable t does not appear in the differential equa-
tion, so it is helpful to make the substitution v = ds>dt; see Project A, part (b).]
(b)	 Also verify that any such spacecraft at the instant when it is decelerating most fiercely 
will be traveling exactly with speed V0> 1e, having by then lost almost 40% of its origi-
nal velocity.
(c)	 Using the plausible data V0 = 11 km/sec and H = 10/1sin a2 km, estimate how small a 
had to be chosen so as to inconvenience the returning travelers with no more than 10 g’s.

For fixed k, F1k, Φ2 has an “inverse,” denoted by sn1k, u2, that satisfies u = F1k, Φ2 if and 
only if sn1k, u2 = sin Φ. The function sn1k, u2 is called a Jacobi elliptic function and has many 
properties that resemble those of the sine function. Using the Jacobi elliptic function sn1k, u2, 
express the equation of motion for the pendulum in the form

(f)	 Take / = 1 m, g = 9.8 m/sec, a = p>4 radians. Use Runge–Kutta algorithms or  
tabulated values of the Jacobi elliptic function to determine the period of the pendulum.
A useful approach to analyzing a nonlinear equation is to study its linearized equation, which is 
obtained by replacing the nonlinear terms by linear approximations. For example, the nonlinear 
equation
(8)	
d2u
dt2 + sin u = 0 ,
which governs the motion of a simple pendulum, has
(9)	
d2u
dt2 + u = 0
as a linearization for small u. (The nonlinear term sin u has been replaced by the linear approxi-
mation u.)
A general solution to equation (8) involves Jacobi elliptic functions (see Project C), which 
are rather complicated, so let’s try to approximate the solutions. For this purpose we consider two 
methods: Taylor series and linearization.
(a)	 Derive the first six terms of the Taylor series about t = 0 of the solution to equation (8) 
with initial conditions u102 = p>12, u′102 = 0. (The Taylor series method is dis-
cussed in Project D of Chapter 1 and Section 8.1.)
(b)	 Solve equation (9) subject to the same initial conditions u102 = p>12, u′102 = 0.
(c)	 On the same coordinate axes, graph the two approximations found in parts (a) and (b).
(d)	 Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the Taylor series method and the lineariza-
tion method.
(e)	 Give a linearization for the initial value problem.
x″1t2 + 0.131 - x21t24x′1t2 + x1t2 = 0  x102 = 0.4 , x′102 = 0 ,
	
for x small. Solve this linearized problem to obtain an approximation for the nonlinear 
problem.

(a)	 From the preceding formulas derive the equations
(12)	
 Re31a + ib2e1a+ib2t4 = eat1a cos bt - b sin bt2 ,
(13)	
 Im31a + ib2e1a+ib2t4 = eat1b cos bt + a sin bt2 .
Now consider a second-order equation of the form
(14)	
L3y4 J ay″ + by′ + cy = g ,
where a, b, and c are real numbers and g is of the special form
(15)	
g1t2 = eAt31antn + P + a1t + a02 cos Bt + 1bntn + P + b1t + b02 sin Bt4 ,
with the aj’s, bj’s, a, and b real numbers. Such a function can always be expressed as the real 
or imaginary part of a function involving the complex exponential. For example, using equation 
(12), one can quickly check that
(16)	
g1t2 = Re3G1t24 ,
where
(17)	
G1t2 = e1A−iB2t31an + ibn2tn + P + 1a1 + ib12t + 1a0 + ib024 .
Now suppose for the moment that we can find a complex-valued solution Y to the equation
(18)	
L3Y4 = aY″ + bY′ + cY = G .
Then, since a, b, and c are real numbers, we get a real-valued solution y to (14) by simply tak-
ing the real part of Y; that is, y = Re Y solves (14). (Recall that in Lemma 2, page 167, we proved 
this fact for homogeneous equations.) Thus, we need focus only on finding a solution to (18).
The method of undetermined coefficients implies that any differential equation of the form
(19)	
L3Y4 = e1a{ib2t31an + ibn2tn + g + 1a1 + ib12t + 1a0 + ib024
has a solution of the form
(20)	
Yp1t2 = tse1a{ib2t3Antn + g + A1t + A04 ,
where An, . . ., A0 are complex constants and s is the multiplicity of a + ib as a root of the aux-
iliary equation for the corresponding homogeneous equation L3Y4 = 0. We can solve for the 
unknown constants Aj by substituting (20) into (19) and equating coefficients of like terms. With 
these facts in mind, we can (for the small price of using complex arithmetic) dispense with the 
methods of Section 4.5 and avoid the unpleasant task of computing derivatives of a function like 
e3t12 + 3t + t22sin12t2, which involves both exponential and trigonometric factors.
Carry out this procedure to determine particular solutions to the following equations:
(b)	 y″ - y′ - 2y = cos t - sin 2t .
(c)	 y″ + y = e-t1cos 2t - 3 sin 2t2 .
(d)	 y″ - 2y′ + 10y = tet sin 3t .
The use of complex arithmetic not only streamlines the computations but also proves very 
useful in analyzing the response of a linear system to a sinusoidal input. Electrical engineers 
make good use of this in their study of RLC circuits by introducing the concept of impedance.

In the application of linear systems theory to mechanical problems, we have encountered the 
equation
(21)	
y″ + py′ + qy = f1t2 ,
where p and q are positive constants with p2 6 4q and f1t2 is a forcing function for the system. In 
many cases it is important for the design engineer to know that a bounded forcing function gives 
rise only to bounded solutions. More specifically, how does the behavior of f1t2 for large values 
of t affect the asymptotic behavior of the solution? To answer this question, do the following:
(a)	 Show that the homogeneous equation associated with equation (21) has two linearly 
independent solutions given by

where a = -p>2 6 0 and b = 1

(b)	 Let f1t2 be a continuous function defined on the interval 30, ∞2. Use the variation of 
parameters formula to show that any solution to (21) on 30, ∞2 can be expressed in the

Legend has it that Robert Hooke proposed to Isaac Newton that a straight tunnel be drilled from 
Moscow to St. Petersburg to accommodate a “gravity train” serving the two cities. Upon depar-
ture gravity would accelerate the train toward the center of the tunnel, then decelerate it as it 
continued toward the terminal. It is amusing to investigate the mechanics of such a conveyance, 
under idealized conditions.
As depicted in Figure 4.38, x denotes the distance of the train from the center of the tunnel, R 
denotes its distance from the center of the earth, and mg denotes the pull of gravity.
(a)	 Show that Newton’s law yields the differential equation
(23)

(b)	 Assume that the tunnel lies so close to the surface of the earth that it is reasonable to 
regard g and R as constants—in which case (23) is analogous to the undamped mass–
spring equation (2) on page 212 of Section 4.9, with mg/R as the effective “spring con-
stant” k. Take g = 9.8 km/s2 and R = 6400 km. The overland (surface) distance from 
Moscow to St. Petersburg is about 650 km. Find the equation of motion for the train 
departing at rest from Moscow at time t = 0.
(c)	 How long will it take the train to get to St. Petersburg?

(1,300 km) to Omsk (900 km) to Pinsk (21,000 km) to Minsk (3,000 km) to Moscow 
(5,000 km). If gravity trains were to connect all these cities, what would be unusual 
about their timetables?

Introduction to Systems  
and Phase Plane Analysis
5.1  Interconnected Fluid Tanks
241
Note that the volume of liquid in each tank remains constant at 24 L because of the balance 
between the inflow and outflow volume rates. Hence, we have two unknown functions of t: the 
mass of salt x1t2 in tank A and the mass of salt y1t2 in tank B. By focusing attention on one 
tank at a time, we can derive two equations relating these unknowns. Since the system is being 
flushed with freshwater, we expect that the salt content of each tank will diminish to zero as 
t S + ∞.
To formulate the equations for this system, we equate the rate of change of salt in each 
tank with the net rate at which salt is transferred to that tank. The salt concentration in tank  
A is x1t2>24 kg/L, so the upper interconnecting pipe carries salt out of tank A at a rate of 
8x>24 kg/min; similarly, the lower interconnecting pipe brings salt into tank A at the rate  
2y>24 kg/min (the concentration of salt in tank B is y>24 kg/L). The freshwater inlet, of 
course, transfers no salt (it simply maintains the volume in tank A at 24 L). From our premise,
dx
dt = input rate −output rate ,
Two large tanks, each holding 24 liters of a brine solution, are interconnected by 
pipes as shown in Figure 5.1. Fresh water flows into tank A at a rate of 6 L/min, and 
fluid is drained out of tank B at the same rate; also 8 L/min of fluid are pumped 
from tank A to tank B, and 2 L/min from tank B to tank A. The liquids inside each 
tank are kept well stirred so that each mixture is homogeneous. If, initially, the 
brine solution in tank A contains x0 kg of salt and that in tank B initially contains  
y0 kg of salt, determine the mass of salt in each tank at time t + 0.†

†For this application we simplify the analysis by assuming the lengths and volumes of the pipes are sufficiently small 
that we can ignore the diffusive and advective dynamics taking place therein.

so the rate of change of the mass of salt in tank A is
dx
dt = 2

 y - 8

 x = 1

The rate of change of salt in tank B is determined by the same interconnecting pipes and by the 
drain pipe, carrying away 6y>24 kg/min:
dy
dt = 8
24
 x - 2
24
 y - 6
24
 y = 1

 x - 1

 y .
The interconnected tanks are thus governed by a system of differential equations:
(1)
	
 x′ = - 1
3
 x + 1
12 y ,
 y′ = 1
3
 x - 1
3 y .
Although both unknowns x1t2 and y1t2 appear in each of equations (1) (they are “coupled”), 
the structure is so transparent that we can obtain an equation for y alone by solving the second 
equation for x,
(2)	
x = 3y′ + y ,
and substituting (2) in the first equation to eliminate x:
13y′ + y2′ = - 1

 13y′ + y2 + 1

 3y″ + y′ = -y′ - 1
3
 y + 1
12
 y ,
or
   3y″ + 2y′ + 1
4
 y = 0 .
This last equation, which is linear with constant coefficients, is readily solved by the methods 
of Section 4.2. Since the auxiliary equation
3r2 + 2r + 1
4 = 0
has roots -1>2, -1>6, a general solution is given by
(3)	
y1t2 = c1e-t>2 + c2e-t>6 .
Having determined y, we use equation (2) to deduce a formula for x:
(4)	
x1t2 = 3a - c1
2
 e-t>2 - c2
6
 e-t>6b + c1e-t>2 + c2e-t>6 = - 1
2
 c1e-t>2 + 1
2
 c2e-t>6 .
Formulas (3) and (4) contain two undetermined parameters, c1 and c2, which can be 
adjusted to meet the specified initial conditions:
x102 = - 1
2
 c1 + 1
2
 c2 = x0 ,    y102 = c1 + c2 = y0 ,

Section 5.2    Differential Operators and the Elimination Method* for Systems           243
or
c1 = y0 - 2x0
2
 , c2 = y0 + 2x0
2
 .
Thus, the mass of salt in tanks A and B at time t are, respectively,
(5)
	
x1t2 = - a y0 - 2x0
4
be-t>2 + a y0 + 2x0
4
be-t>6 ,    
	
y1t2 = a y0 - 2x0
2
be-t>2 + a y0 + 2x0
2
be-t>6 .
The ad hoc elimination procedure that we used to solve this example will be generalized and 
formalized in the next section, to find solutions of all linear systems with constant coefficients. Fur-
thermore, in later sections we will show how to extend our numerical algorithms for first-order equa-
tions to general systems and will consider applications to coupled oscillators and electrical systems.
It is interesting to note from (5) that all solutions of the interconnected-tanks problem 
tend to the constant solution x1t2 K 0, y1t2 K 0 as t S + ∞. (This is of course consistent  
with our physical expectations.) This constant solution will be identified as a stable equilibrium 
solution in Section 5.4, in which we introduce phase plane analysis. It turns out that, for a general 
class of systems, equilibria can be identified and classified so as to give qualitative information 
about the other solutions even when we cannot solve the system explicitly.
The notation y′(t) = dy
dt = d
dt y was devised to suggest that the derivative of a function y is the 
result of operating on the function y with the differentiation operator d
dt. Indeed, second deriva-
tives are formed by iterating the operation: y″(t) = d2y
dt2 = d
dt d
dt y. Commonly, the symbol D 
is used instead of d
dt, and the second-order differential equation
y″ + 4y′ + 3y = 0
is represented† by
D2y + 4Dy + 3y = 1D2 + 4D + 323y4 = 0 .
So, we have implicitly adopted the convention that the operator “product,” D times D, is inter-
preted as the composition of D with itself when it operates on functions: D2y means D1D3y42; 
i.e., the second derivative. Similarly, the product 1D + 321D + 12 operates on a function via
 1D + 321D + 123y4 = 1D + 3231D + 123y44 = 1D + 323y′ + y4
 = D3y′ + y4 + 33y′ + y4
 = 1y″ +  y′2 + 13y′ + 3y2 = y″ + 4y′ + 3y = 1D2 + 4D + 323y4 .
5.2  Differential Operators and  
the Elimination Method* for Systems
*An alternative procedure to the methodology of this section will be described in Chapter 9. Although it involves the 
machinery of matrix analysis, it is preferable for large systems.
†Some authors utilize the identity operator I, defined by I3y4 = y, and write more formally D2 + 4D + 3I instead of 
D2 + 4D + 3.

244          Chapter 5    Introduction to Systems and Phase Plane Analysis
Thus, 1D + 321D + 12 is the same operator as D2 + 4D + 3; when they are applied to 
twice-differentiable functions, the results are identical.
Example 1
Show that the operator 1D + 121D + 32 is also the same as D2 + 4D + 3.
Solution
For any twice-differentiable function y1t2, we have
 1D + 121D + 323y4 = 1D + 1231D + 323y44 = 1D + 123y′ + 3y4
 = D3y′ + 3y4 + 13y′ + 3y4 = 1y″ + 3y′2 + 1y′ + 3y2
 = y″ + 4y′ + 3y = 1D2 + 4D + 323y4 .
Hence, 1D + 121D + 32 = D2 + 4D + 3.  ◆
Since 1D + 121D + 32 = 1D + 321D + 12 = D2 + 4D + 3, it is tempting to generalize 
and propose that one can treat expressions like aD2 + bD + c as if they were ordinary polyno-
mials in D. This is true, as long as we restrict the coefficients a, b, c to be constants. The fol-
lowing example, which has variable coefficients, is instructive.
Example 2
Show that 1D + 3t2D is not the same as D1D + 3t2.
Solution
With y1t2 as before,
 1D + 3t2D3y4 = 1D + 3t23y′4 = y″ + 3ty′ ;
 D1D + 3t23y4 = D3y′ + 3ty4 = y″ + 3y + 3ty′ .
They are not the same!  ◆
Because the coefficient 3t is not a constant, it “interrupts” the interaction of the differ-
entiation operator D with the function y1t2. As long as we only deal with expressions like  
aD2 + bD + c with constant coefficients a, b, and c, the “algebra” of differential operators 
follows the same rules as the algebra of polynomials. (See Problem 39 for elaboration on this 
point.)
This means that the familiar elimination method, used for solving algebraic systems like
 3x - 2y + z = 4 ,
 x + y - z = 0 ,
 2x - y + 3z = 6 ,
can be adapted to solve any system of linear differential equations with constant coefficients.  
In fact, we used this approach in solving the system that arose in the interconnected tanks prob-
lem of Section 5.1. Our goal in this section is to formalize this elimination method so that we 
can tackle more general linear constant coefficient systems.
We first demonstrate how the method applies to a linear system of two first-order differen-
tial equations of the form
 a1x′1t2 + a2x1t2 + a3y′1t2 + a4y1t2 = f11t2 ,
 a5x′1t2 + a6x1t2 + a7y′1t2 + a8y1t2 = f21t2 ,
where a1, a2, . . . , a8 are constants and x1t2, y1t2 is the function pair to be determined. In 
operator notation this becomes
 1a1D + a223x4 + 1a3D + a423y4 = f1 ,
 1a5D + a623x4 + 1a7D + a823y4 = f2 .

Section 5.2    Differential Operators and the Elimination Method* for Systems           245
Example 3
Solve the system
(1)
	
 x′1t2 = 3x1t2 - 4y1t2 + 1 ,
	
 y′1t2 = 4x1t2 - 7y1t2 + 10t .
Solution
The alert reader may observe that since y′ is absent from the first equation, we could use the 
latter to express y in terms of x and x′ and substitute into the second equation to derive an 
“uncoupled” equation containing only x and its derivatives. However, this simple trick will not 
work on more general systems (Problem 18 is an example).
To utilize the elimination method, we first write the system using the operator notation:
(2)
	
 1D - 323x4 + 4y = 1 ,
	
 -4x + 1D + 723y4 = 10t .
Imitating the elimination procedure for algebraic systems, we can eliminate x from this system 
by adding 4 times the first equation to 1D - 32 applied to the second equation. This gives
116 + 1D - 321D + 7223y4 = 4 # 1 + 1D - 32310t4 = 4 + 10 - 30t ,
which simplifies to
(3)	
1D2 + 4D - 523y4 = 14 - 30t .
Now equation (3) is just a second-order linear equation in y with constant coefficients that has 
the general solution
(4)	
y1t2 = C1e-5t + C2et + 6t + 2 ,
which can be found using undetermined coefficients.
To find x1t2, we have two options.
Method 1.  We return to system (2) and eliminate y. This is accomplished by “multiply-
ing” the first equation in (2) by 1D + 72 and the second equation by -4 and then adding to 
obtain
1D2 + 4D - 523x4 = 7 - 40t .
This equation can likewise be solved using undetermined coefficients to yield
(5)	
x1t2 = K1e-5t + K2et + 8t + 5 ,
where we have taken K1 and K2 to be the arbitrary constants, which are not necessarily the 
same as C1 and C2 used in formula (4).
It is reasonable to expect that system (1) will involve only two arbitrary constants, since it 
consists of two first-order equations. Thus, the four constants C1, C2, K1, and K2 are not inde-
pendent. To determine the relationships, we substitute the expressions for x1t2 and y1t2 given 
in (4) and (5) into one of the equations in (1)—say, the first one. This yields
-5K1e-5t + K2et + 8 =
3K1e-5t + 3K2et + 24t + 15 - 4C1e-5t - 4C2et - 24t - 8 + 1 ,
which simplifies to
14C1 - 8K12e-5t + 14C2 - 2K22et = 0 .

246          Chapter 5    Introduction to Systems and Phase Plane Analysis
Because et and e-5t are linearly independent functions on any interval, this last equation holds 
for all t only if
4C1 - 8K1 = 0  and  4C2 - 2K2 = 0 .
Therefore, K1 = C1>2 and K2 = 2C2.
A solution to system (1) is then given by the pair
(6)	
x1t2 = 1
2
 C1e-5t + 2C2et + 8t + 5 , y1t2 = C1e-5t + C2et + 6t + 2 .
As you might expect, this pair is a general solution to (1) in the sense that any solution to (1) 
can be expressed in this fashion.
Method 2.  A simpler method for determining x1t2 once y1t2 is known is to use the system 
to obtain an equation for x1t2 in terms of y1t2 and y′1t2. In this example we can directly solve 
the second equation in (1) for x1t2:
x1t2 = 1
4
 y′1t2 + 7
4
 y1t2 - 5
2 t .
Substituting y1t2 as given in (4) yields
 x1t2 = 1
4
 3 -5C1e-5t + C2et + 64 + 7
4
 3C1e-5t + C2et + 6t + 24 - 5
2 t
 = 1
2
 C1e-5t + 2C2et + 8t + 5 ,
which agrees with (6).  ◆
The above procedure works, more generally, for any linear system of two equations and 
two unknowns with constant coefficients regardless of the order of the equations. For example, 
if we let L1, L2, L3, and L4 denote linear differential operators with constant coefficients (i.e., 
polynomials in D), then the method can be applied to the linear system
 L13x4 + L23y4 = f1 ,
 L33x4 + L43y4 = f2 .
Because the system has constant coefficients, the operators commute (e.g., L2L4 = L4L2) 
and we can eliminate variables in the usual algebraic fashion. Eliminating the variable y gives
(7)	
1L1L4 - L2L323x4 = g1 ,
where g1 J L4[f1] - L2[f2]. Similarly, eliminating the variable x yields
(8)	
1L1L4 - L2L323y4 = g2 ,
where g2 J L1[  f2] - L3[  f1]. Now if L1L4 - L2L3 is a differential operator of order n, then 
a general solution for (7) contains n arbitrary constants, and a general solution for (8) also 
contains n arbitrary constants. Thus, a total of 2n constants arise. However, as we saw in 
Example 3, there are only n of these that are independent for the system; the remaining con-
stants can be expressed in terms of these.† The pair of general solutions to (7) and (8) written 
in terms of the n independent constants is called a general solution for the system.
†For a proof of this fact, see Ordinary Differential Equations, by M. Tenenbaum and H. Pollard (Dover, New York, 
1985), Chapter 7.

Section 5.2    Differential Operators and the Elimination Method* for Systems           247
If it turns out that L1L4 - L2L3 is the zero operator, the system is said to be degenerate. As 
with the anomalous problem of solving for the points of intersection of two parallel or coinci-
dent lines, a degenerate system may have no solutions, or if it does possess solutions, they may 
involve any number of arbitrary constants (see Problems 23 and 24).
Elimination Procedure for 2 : 2 Systems
To find a general solution for the system
L13x4 + L23y4 = f1 ,
L33x4 + L43y4 = f2 ,
where L1, L2, L3, and L4 are polynomials in D = d>dt:
(a)	 Make sure that the system is written in operator form.
(b)	 Eliminate one of the variables, say, y, and solve the resulting equation for x1t2. If 
the system is degenerate, stop! A separate analysis is required to determine whether 
or not there are solutions.
(c)	 (Shortcut) If possible, use the system to derive an equation that involves y1t2 but not 
its derivatives. [Otherwise, go to step (d).] Substitute the found expression for x1t2 
into this equation to get a formula for y1t2. The expressions for x1t2, y1t2 give the 
desired general solution.  ◆
(d)	 Eliminate x from the system and solve for y1t2. [Solving for y1t2 gives more  
constants—in fact, twice as many as needed.]
(e)	 Remove the extra constants by substituting the expressions for x1t2 and y1t2 into 
one or both of the equations in the system. Write the expressions for x1t2 and y1t2 
in terms of the remaining constants.  ◆
Example 4
Find a general solution for
(9)
	
 x″1t2 + y′1t2 - x1t2 + y1t2 = -1 ,
	
 x′1t2 + y′1t2 - x1t2 = t2 .
Solution
We begin by expressing the system in operator notation:
(10)	
 1D2 - 123x4 + 1D + 123y4 = -1 ,
	
 1D - 123x4 + D3y4 = t2 .
Here L1 J D2 - 1, L2 J D + 1, L3 J D - 1, and L4 J D.
Eliminating y gives [see (7)]:
11D2 - 12D - 1D + 121D - 1223x4 = D[-1] - 1D + 123t24 ,
which reduces to
	
 1D2 - 121D - 123x4 = -2t - t2 ,  or
(11)	
 1D - 1221D + 123x4 = -2t - t2 .
Since 1D - 1221D + 12 is third order, we should expect three arbitrary constants in a general 
solution to system (9).
Although the methods of Chapter 4 focused on solving second-order equations,  
we have seen several examples of how they extend in a natural way to higher-order  

248          Chapter 5    Introduction to Systems and Phase Plane Analysis
equations.† Applying this strategy to the third-order equation (11), we observe that the cor-
responding homogeneous equation has the auxiliary equation 1r - 1221r + 12 = 0 with roots 
r = 1, 1, -1. Hence, a general solution for the homogeneous equation is
xh1t2 = C1et + C2tet + C3e-t .
To find a particular solution to (11), we use the method of undetermined coefficients with 
xp1t2 = At2 + Bt + C. Substituting into (11) and solving for A, B, and C yields (after a little 
algebra)
xp1t2 = -t2 - 4t - 6 .
Thus, a general solution to equation (11) is
(12)	
x1t2 = xh1t2 + xp1t2 = C1et + C2tet + C3e-t - t2 - 4t - 6 .
To find y1t2, we take the shortcut described in step (c) of the elimination procedure box. 
Subtracting the second equation in (10) from the first, we find
1D2 - D23x4 + y = -1 - t2 ,
so that
y = 1D - D223x4 - 1 - t2 .
Inserting the expression for x1t2, given in (12), we obtain
 y1t2 = C1et + C21tet + et2 - C3e-t - 2t - 4
-3C1et + C21tet + 2et2 + C3e-t - 24 - 1 - t2 ,  or
(13)	
 y1t2 = -C2et - 2C3e-t - t2 - 2t - 3 .
The formulas for x1t2 in (12) and y1t2 in (13) give the desired general solution to (9).  ◆
The elimination method also applies to linear systems with three or more equations and 
unknowns; however, the process becomes more cumbersome as the number of equations and 
unknowns increases. The matrix methods presented in Chapter 9 are better suited for handling 
larger systems. Here we illustrate the elimination technique for a 3 * 3 system.
†More detailed treatment of higher-order equations is given in Chapter 6.
Example 5
Find a general solution to
(14)
	
 x′1t2 = x1t2 + 2y1t2 - z1t2 ,
	
 y′1t2 = x1t2 + z1t2 ,
	
 z′1t2 = 4x1t2 - 4y1t2 + 5z1t2 .
Solution
We begin by expressing the system in operator notation:
(15)
	
 1D - 123x4 - 2y + z = 0 ,
	
 -x + D3y4 - z = 0 ,
	
 -4x + 4y + 1D - 523z4 = 0 .
Eliminating z from the first two equations (by adding them) and then from the last two 
­equations yields (after some algebra, which we omit) 
(16)
	
 1D - 223x4 + 1D - 223y4 = 0 ,
	
 -1D - 123x4 + 1D - 121D - 423y4 = 0 .

Section 5.2    Differential Operators and the Elimination Method* for Systems           249
On eliminating x from this 2 * 2 system, we eventually obtain
1D - 121D - 221D - 323y4 = 0 ,
which has the general solution
(17)	
y1t2 = C1et + C2e2t + C3e3t .
Taking the shortcut approach, we add the two equations in (16) to get an expression for x 
in terms of y and its derivatives, which simplifies to
x = 1D2 - 4D + 223y4 = y″ - 4y′ + 2y .
When we substitute the expression (17) for y1t2 into this equation, we find
(18)	
x1t2 = -C1et - 2C2e2t - C3e3t .
Finally, using the second equation in (14) to solve for z1t2, we get
z1t2 = y′1t2 - x1t2 ,
and substituting in for y1t2 and x1t2 yields
(19)	
z1t2 = 2C1et + 4C2e2t + 4C3e3t .
The expressions for x1t2 in (18), y1t2 in (17), and z1t2 in (19) give a general solution 
with C1, C2, and C3 as arbitrary constants.  ◆

tank A into tank B at a rate of 3 L/min and from B 
into A at a rate of 1 L/min (see Figure 5.2). The liquid 
inside each tank is kept well stirred. A brine solution 
with a concentration of 0.2 kg/L of salt flows into tank 
A at a rate of 6 L/min. The (diluted) solution flows out 
of the system from tank A at 4 L/min and from tank B 
at 2 L/min. If, initially, tank A contains pure water and 
tank B contains 20 kg of salt, determine the mass of 
salt in each tank at time t Ú 0.
32.	 In Problem 31, 3 L/min of liquid flowed from tank A

33.	 In Problem 31, assume that no solution flows out of the 
system from tank B, only 1 L/min flows from A into B,

34.	 Feedback System with Pooling Delay.    Many physical 
and biological systems involve time delays. A pure time 
delay has its output the same as its input but shifted in 
time. A more common type of delay is pooling delay. An 
example of such a feedback system is shown in Figure 5.3 
on page 251. Here the level of fluid in tank B determines 
the rate at which fluid enters tank A. Suppose this rate 
is given by R11t2 = a3V - V21t24, where a and V are 
positive constants and V21t2 is the volume of fluid in 
tank B at time t.

flow rate R2 from tank A into B is R21t2 = KV11t2,

35.	 A house, for cooling purposes, consists of two zones: 
the attic area zone A and the living area zone B (see 
Figure 5.4). The living area is cooled by a 2-ton air 
conditioning unit that removes 24,000 Btu/hr. The heat 
capacity of zone B is 1>2°F per thousand Btu. The time 
constant for heat transfer between zone A and the out-
side is 2 hr, between zone B and the outside is 4 hr, and 
between the two zones is 4 hr. If the outside tempera-
ture stays at 100°F, how warm does it eventually get in 
the attic zone A? (Heating and cooling of buildings was 
treated in Section 3.3 on page 102.)

zone A and the outside is 4 hr, between the unheated zone 
B and the outside is 5 hr, and between the two zones is  
2 hr. If the outside temperature stays at 0°F, how cold 
does it eventually get in the unheated zone B?

 dy
dt = 4x - 3y + b ;   y102 = 4 ,
where a and b are constants that measure the trust (or dis-
trust) each country has for the other. Determine whether 
there is going to be disarmament (x and y approach 0 as 
t increases), a stabilized arms race (x and y approach a

252          Chapter 5    Introduction to Systems and Phase Plane Analysis
Although we studied a half-dozen analytic methods for obtaining solutions to first-order 
ordinary differential equations in Chapter 2, the techniques for higher-order equations,  
or systems of equations, are much more limited. Chapter 4 focused on solving the linear 
constant-coefficient second-order equation. The elimination method of the previous section 
is also restricted to constant-coefficient systems. And, indeed, higher-order linear constant-
coefficient equations and systems can be solved analytically by extensions of these methods, 
as we will see in Chapters 6, 7, and 9.
However, if the equations—even a single second-order linear equation—have variable 
coefficients, the solution process is much less satisfactory. As will be seen in Chapter 8, the 
solutions are expressed as infinite series, and their computation can be very laborious (with the 
notable exception of the Cauchy–Euler, or equidimensional, equation). And we know virtually 
nothing about how to obtain exact solutions to nonlinear second-order equations.
Fortunately, all the cases that arise (constant or variable coefficients, nonlinear, higher-
order equations or systems) can be addressed by a single formulation that lends itself to a mul-
titude of numerical approaches. In this section we’ll see how to express differential equations 
as a system in normal form and then show how the basic Euler method for computer solution 
can be easily “vectorized” to apply to such systems. Although subsequent chapters will return 
to analytic solution methods, the vectorized version of the Euler technique or the more efficient 
Runge–Kutta technique will hereafter be available as fallback methods for numerical explora-
tion of intractable problems.
Normal Form
A system of m differential equations in the m unknown functions x11t2, x21t2, . . . , xm1t2 
expressed as
	
 x=
11t2 = f11t, x1, x2, . . . , xm2  ,
(1)	
 x=
21t2 = f21t, x1, x2, . . . , xm2  ,
O
	
 x=
m1t2 = fm1t, x1, x2, . . . , xm2
is said to be in normal form. Notice that (1) consists of m first-order equations that collec-
tively look like a vectorized version of the single generic first-order equation
(2)	
x′ = f1t, x2 ,
and that the system expressed in equation (1) of Section 5.1 takes this form, as do equations (1) 
and (14) in Section 5.2. An initial value problem for (1) entails finding a solution to this system 
that satisfies the initial conditions
x11t02 = a1, x21t02 = a2, . . . , xm1t02 = am
for prescribed values t0, a1, a2, . . . , am.
The importance of the normal form is underscored by the fact that most professional codes 
for initial value problems presume that the system is written in this form. Furthermore, for a 
linear system in normal form, the powerful machinery of linear algebra can be readily applied. 
[Indeed, in Chapter 9 we will show how the solutions x1t2 = ceat of the simple equation 
x′ = ax can be generalized to constant-coefficient systems in normal form.]
5.3  Solving Systems and Higher-Order  
Equations Numerically

Section 5.3    Solving Systems and Higher-Order Equations Numerically           253
For these reasons it is gratifying to note that a (single) higher-order equation can always be 
converted to an equivalent system of first-order equations.
To convert an mth-order differential equation
(3)	
y1m21t2 = f1t, y, y′, c, y1m-122
into a first-order system, we introduce, as additional unknowns, the sequence of derivatives of y:
x11t2 J y1t2, x21t2 J y′1t2, . . . , xm1t2 J y1m-121t2 .
With this scheme, we obtain m - 1 first-order equations quite trivially:
(4)
	
 x′11t2 = y′1t2 = x21t2 ,
	
 x′21t2 = y″1t2 = x31t2 ,
O
	
 x′m−11t2 = y1m−121t2 = xm1t2 .
The mth and final equation then constitutes a restatement of the original equation (3) in terms 
of the new unknowns:
(5)	
x′m1t2 = y1m21t2 = f1t, x1, x2, . . . , xm2 .
If equation (3) has initial conditions y1t02 = a1, y′1t02 = a2, . . . , y1m-121t02 = am, then the 
system (4)–(5) has initial conditions x11t02 = a1, x21t02 = a2, . . . , xm1t02 = am.
Example 1
Convert the initial value problem
(6)	
y″1t2 + 3ty′1t2 + y1t22 = sin t ; y102 = 1 , y′102 = 5
into an initial value problem for a system in normal form.
Solution
We first express the differential equation in (6) as
y″1t2 = - 3ty′1t2 - y1t22 + sin t .
Setting x11t2 J y1t2 and x21t2 J y′1t2, we obtain
x=
11t2 = x21t2 ,
x=
21t2 = -3tx21t2 - x11t22 + sin t .
The initial conditions transform to x1102 = 1, x2102 = 5 .  ◆
Euler’s Method for Systems in Normal Form
Recall from Section 1.4 that Euler’s method for solving a single first-order equation (2) is 
based on estimating the solution x at time 1t0 + h2 using the approximation
(7)	
x1t0 + h2 ≈x1t02 + hx′1t02 = x1t02 + h f1t0, x1t022 ,
and that as a consequence the algorithm can be summarized by the recursive formulas
(8)	
tn+1 = tn + h ,
(9)	
xn+1 = xn + h f1tn, xn2,  n = 0, 1, 2, . . .
[compare equations (2) and (3), Section 1.4]. Now we can apply the approximation (7) to each 
of the equations in the system (1):
(10)	
xk1t0 + h2 ≈xk1t02 + hx=
k1t02 = xk1t02 + h fk1t0, x11t02, x21t02, . . . , xm1t022 ,

254          Chapter 5    Introduction to Systems and Phase Plane Analysis
and for k = 1, 2, . . . m, we are led to the recursive formulas
(11)	
tn+1 = tn + h ,
(12)
	
 x1;n+1 = x1;n + h f11tn, x1;n, x2;n, . . . , xm;n2 ,
	
 x2;n+1 = x2;n + h f21tn, x1;n, x2;n, . . . , xm;n2 ,
O
	
 xm;n+1 = xm;n + h fm1tn, x1;n, x2;n, . . . , xm;n2  1n = 0, 1, 2, c2 .
Here we are burdened with the ungainly notation xp;n for the approximation to the value of the 
pth-function xp at time t = t0 + nh; i.e., xp;n ≈xp1t0 + nh2. However, if we treat the unknowns 
and right-hand members of (1) as components of vectors
x1t2 J 3x11t2, x21t2, . . . , xm1t24 ,
f1t, x2 J 3f11t, x1, x2, . . . , xm2,  f21t, x1, x2,  . . . , xm2, . . . ,  fm1t, x1, x2, . . . , xm24 ,
then (12) can be expressed in the much neater form
(13)	
xn+1 = xn + h f1tn, xn2 .
Example 2
Use the vectorized Euler method with step size h = 0.1 to find an approximation for the solu-
tion to the initial value problem
(14)	
y″1t2 + 4y′1t2 + 3y1t2 = 0; y102 = 1.5 , y′102 = -2.5 ,
on the interval 30, 14.
Solution
For the given step size, the method will yield approximations for y10.12, y10.22, . . . , y11.02. 
To apply the vectorized Euler method to (14), we first convert it to normal form. Setting x1 = y 
and x2 = y′, we obtain the system
(15)
	
x=
1 = x2;	             x1102 = 1.5 ,
	
x=
2 = -4x2 - 3x1;     x2102 = -2.5 .
Comparing (15) with (1) we see that f11t, x1, x22 = x2  and  f21t, x1, x22 = -4x2 - 3x1. 
With the starting values of t0 = 0, x1;0 = 1.5, and x2;0 = -2.5, we compute
c
x110.12 ≈x1;1 = x1;0 + hx2;0 = 1.5 + 0.11-2.52 = 1.25 ,
x210.1) ≈x2;1 = x2;0 + h1-4x2;0 - 3x1;02 = -2.5 + 0.13 -41-2.52 - 3 # 1.54 = -1.95 ;
c
x110.22 ≈x1;2 = x1;1 + hx2;1 = 1.25 + 0.11-1.952 = 1.055 ,
x210.2) ≈x2;2 = x2;1 + h1-4x2;1 - 3x1;12 = -1.95 + 0.13 -41-1.952 - 3 # 1.254 = -1.545 .
Continuing the algorithm we compute the remaining values. These are listed in Table 5.1 on 
page 255, along with the exact values calculated via the methods of Chapter 4. Note that the x2;n 
column gives approximations to y′1t2, since x21t2 K y′1t2.  ◆

Euler’s method is modestly accurate for this problem with a step size of h = 0.1. The next 
example demonstrates the effects of using a sequence of smaller values of h to improve the 
accuracy.

Example 3
For the initial value problem of Example 2, use Euler’s method to estimate y112 for succes-
sively halved step sizes h = 0.1, 0.05, 0.025, 0.0125, 0.00625.
Solution
Using the same scheme as in Example 2, we find the following approximations, denoted by 
y11;h2 (obtained with step size h):
h
0.1
0.05
0.025
0.0125
0.00625
y11;h2
0.36280
0.37787
0.38535
0.38907
0.39092
[Recall that the exact value, rounded to 5 decimal places, is y112 = 0.39277.]  ◆
The Runge–Kutta scheme described in Section 3.7 is easy to vectorize also; details are 
given on the following page. As would be expected, its performance is considerably more 
accurate, yielding five-decimal agreement with the exact solution for a step size of 0.05:
h
0.1
0.05
0.025
0.0125
0.00625
y11;h2
0.39278
0.39277
0.39277
0.39277
0.39277
As in Section 3.7, both algorithms can be coded so as to repeat the calculation of y112 
with a sequence of smaller step sizes until two consecutive estimates agree to within some pre-
specified tolerance e. Here one should interpret “two estimates agree to within e” to mean that 
each component of the successive vector approximants [i.e., approximants to y112 and y′112] 
should agree to within e.
An Application to Population Dynamics
A mathematical model for the population dynamics of competing species, one a predator with 
population x21t2 and the other its prey with population x11t2, was developed independently in 

256          Chapter 5    Introduction to Systems and Phase Plane Analysis
the early 1900s by A. J. Lotka and V. Volterra. It assumes that there is plenty of food available 
for the prey to eat, so the birthrate of the prey should follow the Malthusian or exponential law 
(see Section 3.2); that is, the birthrate of the prey is Ax1, where A is a positive constant. The death 
rate of the prey depends on the number of interactions between the predators and the prey. This 
is modeled by the expression Bx1x2, where B is a positive constant. Therefore, the rate of change 
in the population of the prey per unit time is dx1>dt = Ax1 - Bx1x2. Assuming that the predators 
depend entirely on the prey for their food, it is argued that the birthrate of the predators depends 
on the number of interactions with the prey; that is, the birthrate of predators is Dx1x2, where D is 
a positive constant. The death rate of the predators is assumed to be Cx2 because without food the 
population would die off at a rate proportional to the population present. Hence, the rate of change 
in the population of predators per unit time is dx2>dt = -Cx2 + Dx1x2. Combining these two equa-
tions, we obtain the Volterra–Lotka system for the population dynamics of two competing species:
(16)	
 x′1 = Ax1 −Bx1x2 ,
	
 x′2 = −Cx2 + Dx1x2 .
Such systems are in general not explicitly solvable. In the following example, we obtain 
an approximate solution for such a system by utilizing the vectorized form of the Runge–Kutta 
algorithm.
For the system of two equations
x=
1 = f11t, x1, x22 ,
x=
2 = f21t, x1, x22 ,
with initial conditions x11t02 = x1;0, x21t02 = x2;0, the vectorized form of the Runge–Kutta 
recursive equations (cf. (14), page 254) becomes
(17)

x2;n+1 J x2;n + 1

where h is the step size and, for i = 1 and 2,

2k2,22 ,
ki,4 J h fi1tn + h, x1;n + k1,3, x2;n + k2,32 .
It is important to note that both k1,1 and k2,1 must be computed before either k1,2 or k2,2. 
Similarly, both k1,2 and k2,2 are needed to compute k1,3 and k2,3, etc. In Appendix F, program 
outlines are given for applying the method to graph approximate solutions over a specified 
interval 3t0, t14 or to obtain approximations of the solutions at a specified point to within a 
desired tolerance.

Example 4
Use the classical fourth-order Runge–Kutta algorithm for systems to approximate the solution 
of the initial value problem

 x=
1 = 2x1 - 2x1x2 ;    x1102 = 1 ,
	
 x=
2 = x1x2 - x2 ;
    x2102 = 3
at t = 1. Starting with h = 1, continue halving the step size until two successive approximations 
of x1112 and of x2112 differ by at most 0.0001.
Solution
Here f11t, x1, x22 = 2x1 - 2x1x2 and f21t, x1, x22 = x1x2 - x2. With the inputs t0 = 0, x1;0 = 1, 
x2;0 = 3, we proceed with the algorithm to compute x111; 12 and x211; 12, the approxima-
tions to x1112, x2112 using h = 1. We find from the formulas in (18) that
 k1,1 = h12x1;0 - 2x1;0 x2;02 = 2112 - 2112132 = -4 ,
 k2,1 = h1x1;0 x2;0 - x2;02 = 112132 - 3 = 0 ,
k1,2 = h321x1;0 + 1
2k1,12 - 21x1;0 + 1
2k1,12 1x2;0 + 1
2k2,12 4
 = 231 + 1
21 -424 - 231 + 1
21 -424 33 + 1
21024
 = -2 + 2132 = 4 ,
k2,2 = h3 1x1;0 + 1
2k1,12 1x2;0 + 1
2k2,12 - 1x2;0 + 1
2k2,12 4
 = 31 + 1
21 -424 33 + 1
21024 - 33 + 1
21024
 = 1 -12132 - 3 = -6 ,
and similarly we compute
k1,3 = h321x1;0 + 1
2k1,22 - 21x1;0 + 1
2k1,22 1x2;0 + 1
2k2,22 4 = 6 ,
k2,3 = h3 1x1;0 + 1
2k1,22 1x2;0 + 1
2k2,22 - 1x2;0 + 1
2k2,22 4 = 0 ,
k1,4 = h321x1;0 + k1,32 - 21x1;0 + k1,321x2;0 + k2,324 = -28 ,
k2,4 = h31x1;0 + k1,321x2;0 + k2,32 - 1x2;0 + k2,324 = -18 .
Inserting these values into formula (17), we get
x1;1 = x1;0 + 1
61k1,1 + 2k1,2 + 2k1,3 + k1,42
 = 1 + 1
61-4 + 8 + 12 - 282 = -1 ,
x2;1 = x2;0 + 1
61k2,1 + 2k2,2 + 2k2,3 + k2,42 ,
 = 3 + 1
610 - 12 + 0 + 182 = 4 ,
as the respective approximations to x1112 and x2112.

258          Chapter 5    Introduction to Systems and Phase Plane Analysis
To get a better feel for the solution to system (19), we have graphed in Figure 5.6 an approxi-
mation of the solution for 0 … t … 12, using linear interpolation to connect the vectorized Runge–
Kutta approximants for the points t = 0, 0.125, 0.25, . . . , 12.0 (i.e., with h = 0.125). From 
the graph it appears that the components x1 and x2 are periodic in the variable t. Phase plane 
analysis is used in Section 5.5 to show that, indeed, Volterra–Lotka equations have periodic 
solutions.
Repeating the algorithm with h = 1>2 1N = 22 we obtain the approximations x111; 2-12 
and x211; 2-12 for x1112 and x2112. In Table 5.2, we list the approximations x111; 2-m2 and 
x211; 2-m2 for x1112 and x2112 using step size h = 2-m for m = 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. We stopped 
at m = 4, since both
0 x111; 2-32 - x111; 2-42 0 = 0.00006 6 0.0001
and
0 x211; 2-32 - x211; 2-42 0 = 0.00001 6 0.0001 .
Hence, x1112 ≈0.07735 and x2112 ≈1.46445, with tolerance 0.0001.  ◆

for approximating the solution to a first-order equation. 
Extend this method to normal systems and give the recur-
sive formulas for solving the initial value problem.
In Problems 10–13, use the vectorized Euler method with  
h = 0.25 to find an approximation for the solution to the

(Can you guess the solution?)
In Problems 14–24, you will need a computer and a pro-
grammed version of the vectorized classical fourth-order 
Runge–Kutta algorithm. (At the instructor’s discretion, other 
algorithms may be used.)†

18.	 Combat Model.    A simplified mathematical model for 
conventional versus guerrilla combat is given by the system
x=
1 = - 10.12x1x2 ;  x1102 = 10 ,
x=
2 = -x1 ;  
 x2102 = 15 ,
where x1 and x2 are the strengths of guerrilla and conven-
tional troops, respectively, and 0.1 and 1 are the combat 
effectiveness coefficients. Who will win the conflict: the 
conventional troops or the guerrillas? [Hint: Use the vec-
torized Runge–Kutta algorithm for systems with h = 0.1 
to approximate the solutions.]
19.	 Predator–Prey Model.  The Volterra–Lotka predator–
prey model predicts some rather interesting behavior that is 
evident in certain biological systems. For example, suppose 
you fix the initial population of prey but increase the initial 
population of predators. Then the population cycle for the 
prey becomes more severe in the sense that there is a long 
period of time with a reduced population of prey followed 
by a short period when the population of prey is very large. 
To demonstrate this behavior, use the vectorized Runge–
Kutta algorithm for systems with h = 0.5 to approximate 
the populations of prey x and of predators y over the period 
30, 54 that satisfy the Volterra–Lotka system
x′ = x13 - y2 ,
y′ = y1x - 32
under each of the following initial conditions:
	
	(a)	 x102 = 2 ,  y102 = 4 .
	
	(b)	 x102 = 2 ,  y102 = 5 .
	
	(c)	 x102 = 2 ,  y102 = 7 .
20.	 In Project C of Chapter 4, it was shown that the simple 
pendulum equation
u″1t2 + sin u1t2 = 0
has periodic solutions when the initial displacement and 
velocity are small. Show that the period of the solution 
may depend on the initial conditions by using the vector-
ized Runge–Kutta algorithm with h = 0.02 to approxi-
mate the solutions to the simple pendulum problem on 
30, 44 for the initial conditions:
	
	(a)	 u102 = 0.1 ,  u′102 = 0 .
	
	(b)	 u102 = 0.5 ,  u′102 = 0 .
	
	(c)	 u102 = 1.0 ,  u′102 = 0 .
[Hint: Approximate the length of time it takes to reach 
-u102.]
21.	 Fluid Ejection.  In the design of a sewage treatment 
plant, the following equation arises:†
60 - H = 177.72H″ + 119.4221H′22 ;
H102 = H′102 = 0 ,
where H is the level of the fluid in an ejection chamber and 
t is the time in seconds. Use the vectorized Runge–Kutta 
algorithm with h = 0.5 to approximate H1t2 over the 
interval 30, 54.
22.	 Oscillations and Nonlinear Equations.  For the initial 
value problem
x″ + 10.1211 - x22x′ + x = 0 ;
x102 = x0 ,  x′102 = 0 ,
use the vectorized Runge–Kutta algorithm with h = 0.02 
to illustrate that as t increases from 0 to 20, the solution 
x exhibits damped oscillations when x0 = 1, whereas x 
exhibits expanding oscillations when x0 = 2.1.
23.	 Nonlinear Spring.  The Duffing equation
y″ + y + ry3 = 0 ,
where r is a constant, is a model for the vibrations of a 
mass attached to a nonlinear spring. For this model, does 
the period of vibration vary as the parameter r is varied? 
Does the period vary as the initial conditions are varied? 
[Hint: Use the vectorized Runge–Kutta algorithm with  
h = 0.1 to approximate the solutions for r = 1 and 2, 
with initial conditions y102 = a, y′102 = 0 for a = 1, 
2, and 3.]
24.	 Pendulum with Varying Length.  A pendulum is 
formed by a mass m attached to the end of a wire that is 
attached to the ceiling. Assume that the length l1t2 of the 
wire varies with time in some predetermined fashion. If 
u1t2 is the angle in radians between the pendulum and 
the vertical, then the motion of the pendulum is governed 
for small angles by the initial value problem
l21t2u″1t2 + 2l1t2l′1t2u′1t2 + gl1t2sin1u1t22 = 0 ;
u102 = u0 ,  u′102 = u1 ,
where g is the acceleration due to gravity. Assume that
l1t2 = l0 + l1 cos1vt - f2 ,
where l1 is much smaller than l0. (This might be a model 
for a person on a swing, where the pumping action 
changes the distance from the center of mass of the 
swing to the point where the swing is attached.) To sim-
plify the computations, take g = 1. Using the Runge–
Kutta algorithm with h = 0.1, study the motion of the 
pendulum when u0 = 0.05, u1 = 0, l0 = 1, l1 = 0.1, 
v = 1, and f = 0.02. In particular, does the pendulum 
ever attain an angle greater in absolute value than the 
initial angle u0?

27.	 Generalized Blasius Equation.  H. Blasius, in his study of 
laminar flow of a fluid, encountered an equation of the form
y‴ + yy″ = 1y′22 - 1 .
Use the Runge–Kutta algorithm for systems with h = 0.1 
to approximate the solution that satisfies the initial con-
ditions y102 = 0, y′102 = 0, and y″102 = 1.32824. 
Sketch this solution on the interval 30, 24.
28.	 Lunar Orbit.  The motion of a moon moving in a planar 
orbit about a planet is governed by the equations
d2x
dt2 = -G mx
r3  ,  d2y
dt2 = -G my
r3  ,
where r J 1x2 + y221>2, G is the gravitational constant, 
and m is the mass of the planet. Assume Gm = 1. When 
x102 = 1, x′102 = y102 = 0, and y′102 = 1, the 
motion is a circular orbit of radius 1 and period 2p.
	
	(a)	 Setting x1 = x, x2 = x′, x3 = y, x4 = y′, express 
the governing equations as a first-order system in 
normal form.
	
	(b)	 Using h = 2p>100 ≈0.0628318, compute one 
orbit of this moon (i.e., do N = 100 steps.). Do your 
approximations agree with the fact that the orbit is a 
circle of radius 1?
29.	 Competing Species.  Let pi1t2 denote, respectively, the 
populations of three competing species Si, i = 1, 2, 3. 
Suppose these species have the same growth rates, and 
the maximum population that the habitat can support is 
the same for each species. (We assume it to be one unit.) 
Also suppose the competitive advantage that S1 has over 
S2 is the same as that of S2 over S3 and S3 over S1. This 
situation is modeled by the system
p=
1 = p111 - p1 - ap2 - bp32 ,
p=
2 = p211 - bp1 - p2 - ap32 ,
p=
3 = p311 - ap1 - bp2 - p32 ,
where a and b are positive constants. To demonstrate the 
population dynamics of this system when a = b = 0.5, 
use the Runge–Kutta algorithm for systems with h = 0.1 
to approximate the populations pi over the time interval 
30, 104 under each of the following initial conditions:
	
	(a)	 p1102 = 1.0 , p2102 = 0.1 , p3102 = 0.1 .
	
	(b)	 p1102 = 0.1 , p2102 = 1.0 , p3102 = 0.1 .
	
	(c)	 p1102 = 0.1 , p2102 = 0.1 , p3102 = 1.0 .
On the basis of the results of parts (a)–(c), decide what 
you think will happen to these populations as t S + ∞.
30.	 Spring Pendulum.  Let a mass be attached to one end of 
a spring with spring constant k and the other end attached 
to the ceiling. Let l0 be the natural length of the spring 
and let l1t2 be its length at time t. If u1t2 is the angle 
between the pendulum and the vertical, then the motion 
of the spring pendulum is governed by the system
l″1t2 - l1t2u′1t2 - g cos u1t2 + k
m
 1l - l02 = 0 ,
l21t2u″1t2 + 2l1t2l′1t2u′1t2 + gl1t2 sin u1t2 = 0 .
Assume g = 1, k = m = 1, and l0 = 4. When the sys-
tem is at rest, l = l0 + mg>k = 5.
	
	(a)	 Describe the motion of the pendulum when 
l102 = 5.5, l′102 = 0, u102 = 0, and u′102 = 0.
	
	(b)	 When the pendulum is both stretched and given an 
angular displacement, the motion of the pendulum is 
more complicated. Using the Runge–Kutta algorithm 
for systems with h = 0.1 to approximate the solu-
tion, sketch the graphs of the length l and the angular 
displacement u on the interval 30, 104 if l102 = 5.5, 
l′102 = 0, u102 = 0.5, and u′102 = 0.

Note that the independent variable t does not appear in the right-hand terms f1x, y2 and g1x, y2; 
such systems are called autonomous. For example, the system that modeled the interconnected 
tanks problem in Section 5.1,
 x′ = - 1
3
 x + 1
12 y ,
 y′ = 1
3
 x - 1
3 y ,
is autonomous. So is the Volterra–Lotka system,
 x′ = Ax - Bxy ,
 y′ = -Cy + Dxy ,
(with A, B, C, D constants), which was discussed in Example 4 of Section 5.3 as a model for 
population dynamics.
For future reference, we note that the solutions to autonomous systems have a “time-
shift immunity,” in the sense that if the pair x1t2, y1t2 solves (1), so does the time-shifted 
pair x1t + c2, y1t + c2 for any constant c. Specifically, if we let X1t2 J x1t + c2 and 
Y1t2 J y1t + c2, then by the chain rule
 dX
dt
 1t2 = dx
dt
 1t + c2 = f1x1t + c2, y1t + c22 = f1X1t2, Y1t22 ,
 dY
dt
 1t2 = dy
dt
 1t + c2 = g1x1t + c2, y1t + c22 = g1X1t2, Y1t22 ,
proving that X1t2, Y1t2 is also a solution to (1).
Since a solution to the autonomous system is a pair of functions x1t2, y1t2 that satisfies (1) 
for all t in some interval I, it can be visualized as a pair of graphs, as shown in Figure 5.7. For pur-
poses of comparing one of the solution pair with its mate, we can compress these two graphs into 
one by charting the path in the plane traced out by the ordered pair 1x1t2, y1t22 as t increases.
Trajectories and the Phase Plane
Definition 1.	 If x1t2, y1t2 is a solution pair to (1) for t in the interval I, then a plot in 
the xy-plane of the parametrized curve x = x1t2, y = y1t2 for t in I, together with arrows 
indicating its direction with increasing t, is said to be a trajectory of the system (1).  
In such a context we call the xy-plane the phase plane and refer to a representative set 
of trajectories in this plane as a phase portrait of the system.
In this section, we study systems of two first-order equations of the form
(1)
	
 dx
dt = f1x, y2 ,
	
 dy
dt = g1x, y2 .
5.4  Introduction to the Phase Plane
A trajectory provides a visualization of the motion of a particle in the plane that starts at 
some point 1x0, y02 and follows a path as time increases that is determined by the solution to 
the autonomous system with initial conditions x102 = x0, y102 = y0. The trajectory for the 

Section 5.4    Introduction to the Phase Plane          263
solution pair of Figure 5.7 is shown in Figure 5.8. Note, however, that the trajectory contains 
less information than the individual graphs for x1t2 and y1t2, because the t-dependence has 
been suppressed. (We can’t tell if the particle’s speed is fast or slow.) In principle we can con-
struct, point by point, the trajectory from the solution graphs, but we cannot reconstruct the 
solution graphs from the phase plane trajectory alone (because we would not know what value 
of t to assign to each point). Nonetheless, trajectories provide valuable information about the 
qualitative behavior of solutions to the autonomous system.
Can we find trajectories without knowing a solution pair to the system? Yes; the key is to 
observe that since t does not appear explicitly on the right-hand side of system (1), if we divide 
the two equations and invoke the chain rule
dy
dx =
dy>dt
dx>dt ,
we get the “related phase plane differential equation” (without t)
(2)	
dy
dx = g1x, y2
f1x, y2  .
We mastered equations like (2) in Chapter 2; their solution curves provide highways along 
which the trajectories travel. What is missing from these highways is the orientation of a tra-
jectory, which can be gleaned from the autonomous system (1) by determining the sign of f or 
g at a point and recalling that 1dx>dt, dy>dt2 = 1f, g2 is the velocity of the moving particle. 
Furthermore, as illustrated in Example 1 below, a single curve arising from the related phase 
plane differential equation might well accommodate several different trajectories.
As we shall see in the examples to follow as well as in Figure 5.12, trajectories are typi-
cally of the following types: (i) a single point, indicating a stationary particle; (ii) a non-closed 
arc, without self-intersections; or (iii) a closed curve (cycle), indicating periodic motion. 
Moreover, thanks to the Existence-Uniqueness Theorem for first-order equations in Chapter 1 
(page 11), as long as the functions f and g in (1) are continuously differentiable in the plane, 
the trajectories of a phase portrait will not intersect each other (unless they coincide).

Notice that trajectories of equilibrium solutions consist of just single points (the equili-brium 
points). But what can be said about the other trajectories? Can we predict any of their features from 
closer examination of the equilibrium points? To explore this we focus on the related phase plane 
differential equation (2) and exploit its direction field (recall Section 1.3, page 15). However, we’ll 
augment the direction field plot by attaching arrowheads to the line segments, indicating the direc-
tion of the “flow” of solutions as t increases. This is easy: When dx>dt is positive, x1t2 increases 
so the trajectory flows to the right. Therefore, according to (1), all direction field segments drawn 
in a region where f1x, y2 is positive should point to the right [and, of course, they point to the left 
if f1x, y2 is negative]. If f1x, y2 is zero, we can use g1x, y2 to decide if the flow is upward [y1t2 
increases] or downward 3y1t2 decreases]. [What if both f1x, y2 and g1x, y2 are zero?]
In the examples that follow, one can use computers or calculators for generating these 
direction fields.
Critical Points and Equilibrium Solutions
Definition 2.	 A point 1x0, y02 where f1x0, y02 = 0 and g1x0, y02 = 0 is called a critical 
point, or equilibrium point, of the system dx>dt = f1x, y2, dy>dt = g1x, y2, and the 
corresponding constant solution x1t2 K x0, y1t2 K y0 is called an equilibrium solution.
Example 1
Sketch the direction field in the phase plane for the system

 dx
dt = -x ,
	
 dy
dt = -2y
and identify its critical point.
Solution
Here f1x, y2 = -x and g1x, y2 = -2y are both zero when x = y = 0, so 10, 02 is the critical 
point. The direction field for the related phase plane differential equation
(4)	
dy
dx = -2y

x
is given in Figure 5.9 on page 265. Since dx>dt = -x in (3), trajectories in the right half-plane 
(where x 7 02 flow to the left, and vice versa. From the figure we can see that all solutions 
“flow into” the critical point 10, 02. Such a critical point is called asymptotically stable.†  ◆
Remark.  For this simple example, we can actually solve the system (3) explicitly; indeed, 
(3) constitutes an uncoupled pair of linear equations whose solutions are x1t2 = c1e-t and 
y1t2 = c2e-2t. By elimination of t, we obtain the equation y = c2e-2t = c2[x1t2>c1]2 = cx2. 
So the trajectories lie along the parabolas y = cx2. [Alternatively, we could have solved (4) by 
separating variables and obtained these same parabolas as the “highways” on which the trajec-
tories travel.] Notice that each such parabola is made up of three trajectories: an incoming tra-
jectory approaching the origin in the right half-plane; its mirror-image trajectory approaching

Except for the very special case of linear systems with constant coefficients that was discussed 
in Section 5.2, finding all solutions to the system (1) is generally an impossible task. But it is 
relatively easy to find constant solutions; if f1x0, y02 = 0 and g1x0, y02 = 0, then the constant  
functions x1t2 K x0,  y1t2 K y0 solve (1). For such solutions the following terminology is used.

is shown in Figure 5.11, along with some trajectories and a typical solution pair.† Note that solu-
tions flow to the right for 5x - 3y - 2 7 0, i.e., for all points below the line 5x - 3y - 2 = 0, 
and that they slow down near the critical point.
The solution curve to (9) passing through 12, 02 in Figure 5.11 apparently is a “high-
way” extending to infinity. Does this imply the corresponding system solution x1t2, y1t2 also 
approaches infinity in the sense that 0 x1t2 0 + 0 y1t2 0 S + ∞ as t S + ∞, or could its trajectory 
“stall” at some point along the highway, or possibly even “backtrack?” It cannot backtrack, 
because the direction arrows along the trajectory point, unambiguously, to the right. And if 
1x1t2, y1t22 stalls at some point 1x1, y12, then intuitively we would conclude that 1x1, y12 
was an equilibrium point (since the “speeds” dx>dt and dy>dt would approach zero there). But 
we have already found the only critical point. So we conclude, with a high degree of confi-
dence,‡ that the system solution does indeed go to infinity.
The critical point 11, 12 is unstable because, although many solutions get arbitrarily close 
to 11, 12, most of them eventually flow away. Solutions that lie on the line y = 2x - 1, how-
ever, do converge to 11, 12. Such an equilibrium is an example of a saddle point.  ◆
In the preceding example, we informally argued that if a trajectory “stalls”—that is, if it 
has an endpoint—then this endpoint would have to be a critical point. This is more carefully 
stated in the following theorem, whose proof is outlined in Problem 30.
†Solutions to equation (9) can be obtained analytically using the methods of Section 2.6.

Endpoints Are Critical Points
Theorem 1.	
Let the pair x1t2, y1t2 be a solution on [0, + ∞2 to the autonomous system 
dx>dt = f1x, y2, dy>dt = g1x, y2, where f and g are continuous in the plane. If the limits
x* J
lim
tS + ∞ x1t2  and  y* J
lim
tS + ∞ y1t2
exist and are finite, then the point 1x*, y*2 is a critical point for the system.

Section 5.4    Introduction to the Phase Plane          267
Some typical trajectory configurations near critical points are displayed and classified in 
Figure 5.12. These phase plane portraits were generated by software packages having trajectory-
sketching options†. A more complete discussion of the nature of various types of equilibrium 
solutions and their stability is deferred to Chapter 12.‡ For the moment, however, notice that 
unstable critical points are distinguished by “runaway” trajectories emanating from arbitrarily 
nearby points, while stable equilibria “trap” all neighboring trajectories. The asymptotically 
stable critical points attract their neighboring trajectories as t S + ∞.
Historically, the phase plane was introduced to facilitate the analysis of mechanical sys-
tems governed by Newton’s second law, force equals mass times acceleration. An autonomous 
mechanical system arises when this force is independent of time and can be modeled by a 
second-order equation of the form
(10)	
y″ = ƒ1y, y′2 .
As we have seen in Section 5.3, this equation can be converted to a normal first-order system 
by introducing the velocity y = dy>dt and writing

Thus, we can analyze the behavior of an autonomous mechanical system by studying its phase 
portrait in the yy-plane. Notice that with y as the vertical axis, trajectories 1y1t2, y1t22 flow to 
the right in the upper half-plane (where y 7 0), and to the left in the lower half-plane.
Example 4
Sketch the direction field in the phase plane for the first-order system corresponding to the 
unforced, undamped mass–spring oscillator described in Section 4.1 (Figure 4.1, page 152). 
Sketch several trajectories and interpret them physically.
Solution
The equation derived in Section 4.1 for this oscillator is my″ + ky = 0 or, equivalently, 
y″ = -ky>m. Hence, the system (11) takes the form
(12)
	
 y′ = y ,
	
 y′ = - ky
m .
The critical point is at the origin y = y = 0. The direction field in Figure 5.13 indicates that 
the trajectories appear to be either closed curves (ellipses?) or spirals that encircle the critical 
point.
We saw in Section 4.9 that the undamped oscillator motions are periodic; they cycle 
repeatedly through the same sets of points, with the same velocities. Their trajectories in the 
phase plane, then, must be closed curves.† Let’s confirm this mathematically by solving the 
related phase plane differential equation

so its solutions are the ellipses y2>2 + ky2>2m = C as shown in Figure 5.14. The trajectories  
of (12) are confined to these ellipses, and hence neither come arbitrarily close to nor wander 
arbitrarily far from the equilibrium solution. The critical point is thus identified as a center in 
Figure 5.12 on page 267.
Furthermore, the system solutions must continually circulate around the ellipses, since 
there are no critical points to stop them. This confirms that all solutions are periodic.  ◆
Remark.  More generally, we argue that if a solution to an autonomous system like (1) 
passes through a point in the phase plane twice and if it is sufficiently well behaved to satisfy a 
­uniqueness theorem, then the second “tour” satisfies the same initial conditions as the first tour 
and so must replicate it. In other words, closed trajectories containing no critical points 
correspond to periodic solutions.
Through these examples we have seen how, by studying the phase plane, one can often 
anticipate some of the features (boundedness, periodicity, etc.) of solutions of autonomous 
systems without solving them explicitly. Much of this information can be predicted simply 
from the critical points and the direction field (oriented by arrowheads), which are obtainable 
through standard software packages. The final example ties together several of these ideas.

What is the asymptotic behavior of the solutions starting from 13, 02, 15, 02, and 12, 32?
Solution
To find the critical points, we solve the system
-y1y - 22 = 0,  1x - 221y - 22 = 0 .
One family of solutions to this system is given by y = 2 with x arbitrary; that is, the line y = 2. 
If y ≠2, then the system simplifies to -y = 0, and x - 2 = 0, which has the solution x = 2, 
y = 0. Hence, the critical point set consists of the isolated point 12, 02 and the horizontal 
line y = 2. The corresponding equilibrium solutions are x1t2 K 2, y1t2 K 0, and the family 
x1t2 K c, y1t2 K 2, where c is an arbitrary constant.

270          Chapter 5    Introduction to Systems and Phase Plane Analysis
The related phase plane differential equation for the system (14) is
(15)	
dy
dx = 1x - 221y - 22
-y1y - 22
= - x - 2
y
 .
Solving this equation by separating variables,
y dy = -1x - 22 dx  or  y2 + 1x - 222 = C ,
demonstrates that the trajectories lie on concentric circles centered at 12, 02. See Figure 5.15.
Next we analyze the flow along each trajectory. From the equation dx>dt = -y1y - 22, 
we see that x is decreasing when y 7 2. This means the flow is from right to left along the arc 
of a circle that lies above the line y = 2. For 0 6 y 6 2, we have dx>dt 7 0, so in this region 
the flow is from left to right. Furthermore, for y 6 0, we have dx>dt 6 0, and again the flow is 
from right to left.
We now observe in Figure 5.15 that there are four types of trajectories associated with sys-
tem (14): (a) those that begin above the line y = 2 and follow the arc of a circle counterclock-
wise back to that line; (b) those that begin below the line y = 2 and follow the arc of a circle 
clockwise back to that line; (c) those that continually move clockwise around a circle centered 
at 12, 02 with radius less than 2 (i.e., they do not intersect the line y = 2); and finally, (d) the 
critical points 12, 02 and y = 2, x arbitrary.
The solution starting at 13, 02 lies on a circle with no critical points; therefore, it is a 
periodic solution, and the critical point 12, 02 is a center. But the circle containing the solu-
tions starting at 15, 02 and at 12, 32 has critical points at 12 - 25, 22 and 12 + 25, 22. 
The direction arrows indicate that both solutions approach 12 - 25, 22 asymptotically (as 
t S + ∞2. They lie on the same solution curve for the related phase plane differential equation 
(a circle), but they are quite different trajectories.  ◆
Note that for the system (14) the critical points on the line y = 2 are not isolated, so they 
do not fit into any of the categories depicted in Figure 5.12 on page 267. Observe also that all 
solutions of this system are bounded, since they are confined to circles.

goal is to show that f1x*, y*2 = g1x*, y*2 = 0. Justify

t 7 T, where C is some constant.
	
	(c)	 Conclude from part (b) that limtS+∞x1t2 = + ∞, 
contradicting the fact that this limit is the finite 
number x*. Thus, f1x*, y*2 cannot be positive.

where the constants x0 and l are, respectively, the dis-
tances from the bar to the wall and to the wire when the 
bar is at equilibrium (rest) with the current off.
	
	(a)	 Setting y = dx>dt, convert the second-order equa-
tion to an equivalent first-order system.
	
	(b)	 Solve the related phase plane differential equation 
for the system in part (a) and thereby show that its

l 6 2 there are no critical 
points in the xy-phase plane, whereas if l 7 2 there 
are two ­critical points. For the latter case, determine 
these critical points.
	
	(d)	 Physically, the case l 6 2 corresponds to a current 
so high that the magnetic attraction completely over-
powers the spring. To gain insight into this, use soft-
ware to plot the phase plane diagrams for the system 
when l = 1 and when l = 3.
	
	(e)	 From your phase plane diagrams in part (d), describe 
the possible motions of the bar when l = 1 and 
when l = 3, under various initial conditions.
34.	 Falling Object.  The motion of an object moving verti-
cally through the air is governed by the equation
d2y
dt2 = -g - g
V2 dy
dt ` dy
dt `  ,
where y is the upward vertical displacement and V is a 
constant called the terminal speed. Take g = 32 ft/sec2 
and V = 50 ft/sec. Sketch trajectories in the yy-phase 
plane for -100 … y … 100, -100 … y … 100, starting 
from y = 0 and y = -75, -50, -25, 0, 25, 50, and 75 ft/sec. 
Interpret the trajectories physically; why is V called the 
terminal speed?
35.	 Sticky Friction.  An alternative for the damping fric-
tion model F = -by′ discussed in Section 4.1 is the 
“sticky friction” model. For a mass sliding on a surface 
as depicted in Figure 5.18, the contact friction is more 
complicated than simply -by′. We observe, for example, 
that even if the mass is displaced slightly off the equilib-
rium location y = 0, it may nonetheless remain station-
ary due to the fact that the spring force -ky is insufficient 
to break the static friction’s grip. If the maximum force 
that the friction can exert is denoted by m, then a feasible 
model is given by
Ffriction = d
ky ,
m sign1y2 ,
-m sign1y′2 ,
(16)	
m d2y
dt2 = -ky + Ffriction .
Thus, if the mass is at rest, friction balances the spring 
force if 0 y0 6 m>k but simply opposes it with intensity m 
if 0 y0 Ú m>k. If the mass is moving, friction opposes the 
velocity with the same intensity m.

order system

and solve it to derive the solutions

where the plus sign prevails for y 7 0 and the minus 
sign for y 6 0.

families of concentric semicircles. What is the cen-
ter of the semicircles in the upper half-plane? The

36.	 Rigid Body Nutation.  Euler’s equations describe the 
motion of the principal-axis components of the angular 
velocity of a freely rotating rigid body (such as a space 
station), as seen by an observer rotating with the body 
(the astronauts, for example). This motion is called nuta-
tion. If the angular velocity components are denoted by 
x, y, and z, then an example of Euler’s equations is the 
three-dimensional autonomous system
 dx>dt = yz ,
 dy>dt = -2xz ,
 dz>dt = xy .

	(e)	 Figure 5.19 displays some typical trajectories for 
this system. Discuss the stability of the three critical 
points indicated on the positive axes.
In this section we are going to survey some issues in biological systems that have been suc-
cessfully modeled by differential equations. We begin by reviewing the population models 
described in Sections 3.2 and 5.3.
In the Malthusian model, the rate of growth of a population p1t2 is proportional to the size 
of the existing population:
(1)	
dp
dt = kp 1k 7 02 .
Cells that reproduce by splitting, such as amoebae and bacteria, are obvious biological examples 
of this type of growth. Equation (1) implies that a Malthusian population grows exponentially; 
there is no mechanism for constraining the growth. In Section 3.2 we saw that certain popula-
tions exhibit Malthusian growth over limited periods of time (as does compound interest).†
Inserting a negative growth rate,
(2)	
dp
dt = -kp ,
results in solutions that decay exponentially. Their average lifetime is 1>k, and their half-life 
is 1ln 22>k (Problems 6 and 8). In animals, certain organs such as the kidney serve to cleanse 
5.5  Applications to Biomathematics:  
Epidemic and Tumor Growth Models
†Gordon E. Moore (1929–) has observed that the number of transistors on new integrated circuits produced by the 
electronics industry doubles every 24 months. “Moore’s law” is commonly cited by industrialists.

Section 5.5    Applications to Biomathematics: Epidemic and Tumor Growth Models           275
the bloodstream of unwanted components (creatinine clearance, renal clearance), and their 
concentrations diminish exponentially. As a general rule, the body tends to dissipate ingested 
drugs in such a manner. (Of course, the most familiar physical instance of Malthusian disin-
tegration is radioactive decay.) Note that if there are both growth and extinction processes, 
dp>dt = k+p - k-p and the equation in (1) still holds with k = k+ - k-.
When there are two-party interactions occurring in the population that decrease the growth 
rate, such as competition for resources or violent crime, the logistic model might be applicable; 
it assumes that the extinction rate is proportional to the number of possible pairs in the popula-
tion, p1p - 12>2:
(3)	
dp
dt = k1p - k2
p ( p - 1)
2
 or, equivalently, dp
dt = -Ap ( p - p1) .†
Rodent, bird, and plant populations exhibit logistic growth rates due to social structure, territo-
riality, and competition for light and space, respectively. The logistic function
p1t2 =
p0p1
p0 + 1p1 - p02e-Ap1t ,  p0 J p102
was shown in Section 3.2 to be the solution of (3), and typical graphs of p1t2 were displayed 
there.
In Section 5.3 we observed that the Volterra–Lotka model for two different populations, 
a predator x21t2 and a prey x11t2, postulates a Malthusian growth rate for the prey and an 
extinction rate governed by x1x2, the number of possible pairings of one from each population,
(4)	
dx1
dt = Ax1 - Bx1x2 ,
while predators follow a Malthusian extinction rate and pairwise growth rate
(5)	
dx2
dt = -Cx2 + Dx1x2 .
Volterra–Lotka dynamics have been observed in blood vessel growth (predator = new capil-
lary tips; prey = chemoattractant), fish populations, and several animal–plant interactions.
Systems like (4)–(5) were studied in Section 5.3 with the aid of the Runge–Kutta 
algorithm. Now, armed with the insights of Section 5.4, we can further explore this model 
theoretically.
First, we perform a “reality check” by proving that the populations x11t2, x21t2 in the  
Volterra–Lotka model never change sign. Separating (4) leads to
1
x1
 dx1
dt = d ln x1
dt
= A - Bx2 ,
while integrating from 0 to t results in
(6)	
x11t2 = x1102e1
t
0{A-Bx2(t)} dt ,
and the exponential factor is always positive. Thus x11t2 [and similarly x21t2] retains its initial 
sign (negative populations never arise).
†One might propose that the growth rate in animal populations is due to two–party interactions as well. (Wink, wink.) 
However, in monogamous societies, the number of pairs participating in procreation is proportional to p>2, leading to (1). 
A growth rate determined by all possible pairings p1p - 12>2 would indicate a highly hedonistic social order.

suggests that this equilibrium is a center (compare Figure 5.12 on page 267) with closed (periodic) 
neighboring trajectories, in accordance with the simulations in Section 5.3. However it is conceiv-
able that some spiral trajectories might snake through the field pattern and approach the critical 
point asymptotically. A rather tricky argument in Problem 4 demonstrates that this is not the case.  ◆
The SIR Epidemic Model.  The SIR† model for an epidemic addresses the spread of diseases 
that are only contracted by contact with an infected individual; its victims, once recovered, are 
immune to further infection and are themselves noninfectious. So the members of a population 
of size N fall into three classes:
S1t2 = the number of susceptible individuals—that is, those who have not been 
infected; s J S/N is the fraction of susceptibles.
I1t2 = the number of individuals who are currently infected, comprising a fraction  
i J  I/N of the population.
R1t2 = the number of individuals who have recovered from infection, comprising 
the fraction r J  R/N.

Section 5.5    Applications to Biomathematics: Epidemic and Tumor Growth Models           277
The classic SIR epidemic model assumes that on the average, an infectious individual 
encounters a people per unit time (usually per week). Thus, a total of aI people per week are 
contacted by infectees, but only a fraction s = S/N of them are susceptible. So the susceptible 
population diminishes at a rate
(10)	
dS
dt = -saI or (dividing by N)
(11)	
ds
dt = -asi .
The parameter a is crucial in disease control. Crowded conditions, or high a, make it difficult 
to combat the spread of infection. Ideally, we would quarantine the infectees (low a) to fight 
the epidemic.
The infected population is (obviously) increased whenever a susceptible individual is 
infected. Additionally, infectees recover in a Malthusian-disintegrative manner over an average 
time of, say, 1>k weeks [recall (1)], so the infected population changes at a rate
(12)	
dI
dt = saI - kI = aas - k
abI or
(13)	
di
dt = aas - k
abi .
And, of course, the population of recovered individuals increases whenever an infectee is 
healed:
(14)	
dR
dt = kI or dr
dt = ki .
With the SIR model, the total population count remains unchanged:
d(S + I + R)
dt
= -saI + saI - kI + kI = 0 .
Thus, any fatalities are tallied in the “recovered/noninfectious” population R.
Interestingly, equations (11) and (13) do not contain R or r, so they are suitable for phase 
plane analysis. In fact they constitute a Volterra–Lotka system with A = 0, B = D = a, and 
C = k. Because the coefficient A is zero, the critical point structure is different from that 
discussed in Example 1. Specifically, if -asi in (11) is zero, then only -ki remains on the 
right in (13), so I1t2 = i1t2 K 0 is necessary and sufficient for a critical point, with S unre-
stricted. (Physically, this means the populations remain stable only if there are no carriers of 
the infection.)
Our earlier argument has shown that if s1t2 and i1t2 are initially positive, they remain so. 
As a result we conclude from (11) immediately that s1t2 decreases monotonically; as such, it has 
a limiting value s1 ∞2 as t S ∞. Does i1t2 have a limiting value also? If so, 5s1∞2, i1∞26 
would be a critical point by Theorem 1 of Section 5.4, page 266, and thus i1 ∞2 = 0.
To analyze i1t2 consider the phase plane equation for (11) and (13):
(15)	
di
ds = asi - ki
-asi
= -1 + k
as ,
which has solutions
(16)	
i = -s + k
a ln s + K .

278          Chapter 5    Introduction to Systems and Phase Plane Analysis
From (16) we see that s1 ∞2 cannot be zero; otherwise the right-hand side would eventually 
be negative, contradicting i1t2 7 0. Therefore, (16) demonstrates that i1t2 does have a limiting 
value i1 ∞2 = -s1 ∞2 + 1k>a2 ln s1 ∞2 + K. As noted, i1 ∞2 must then be zero.
From (13) we further conclude that if s102 exceeds the “threshold value” k>a, the infected 
fraction i1t2 will initially increase 1di>dt 7 0 at t = 02 before eventually dying out. The peak 
value of i1t2 occurs when di>dt = 0 = a3s - 1k>a24i, i.e., when s1t2 passes through the 
value k>a. In the jargon of epidemiology, this phenomenon defines an “epidemic.” You will be 
directed in Problem 10 to show that if s102 … k>a, the infected population diminishes mono-
tonically, and no epidemic develops.

Figure 5.21 Mortality data for Hong Kong flu, New York City
Example 2†
According to data issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, 
Georgia, the Hong Kong flu epidemic during the winter of 1968–1969 was responsible for 1035 
deaths in New York City (population 7,900,000), according to the time chart in Figure 5.21. 
Analyze this data with the SIR model.
†We borrow liberally from “The SIR Model for Spread of Disease” by Duke University’s David Smith and  
Lang Moore, Journal of Online Mathematics and Its Applications, The MAA Mathematical Sciences Digital Library, 
http://mathdl.maa.org/mathDL/4/?pa=content&sa=viewDocument&nodeId=479&bodyId=612, copyright 2000, CCP 
and the authors, published December, 2001. The article contains much interesting information about this epidemic.
Solution
Of course, we need to make some assumptions about the parameters. First of all, only a small 
percentage of people who contract Hong Kong flu perish, so let’s assume that the chart reflects 
a scaled version of the infected population fraction i1t2. It is known that the recovery period 
for this flu is around 5 days, or 5>7 week, so we try k = 7>5 = 1.4. And since the infectees 
spend much of their convalescence in bed, the average contact rate a is probably less than 1 
person per day or 7 per week. The CDC estimated that the initial infected population I102 was 
about 10, so the initial data for (11), (13), and (14) are
s102 = 7,900,000 - 10
7,900,000
 ≈0.9999987, i102 =
10
7,900,000 ≈1.2658 * 10-6, r102 = 0 . 

Section 5.5    Applications to Biomathematics: Epidemic and Tumor Growth Models           279
Numerical simulations of this system are displayed in Figure 5.22.† The contact rate  
a = 3.5 per week generates an infection fraction curve that closely matches the mortality 
data’s characteristics: time of peak and duration of epidemic.  ◆
A Tumor Growth Model.‡  The observed growth of certain tumors can be explained by a 
model that is mathematically similar to the epidemic model. The total number of cells N in the 
tumor subdivides into a population P that proliferates by splitting (Malthusian growth) and a 
population Q that remains quiescent. However, the proliferating cells also can make a transi-
tion to the quiescent state, and this occurrence is modeled as a Malthusian-like decay with a 
“rate” r1N2 that increases with the overall size of the tumor:
(17)	
dP
dt = cP −r1N2P ,
(18)	
dQ
dt = r1N2P .
Thus the total population N increases only when the proliferating cells split, as can be seen by 
adding the equations (17) and (18):
(19)	
dN
dt = d(P + Q)
dt
= cP .
We take (17) and (19) as the system for our analysis. The phase plane equation

Suppose the initial conditions are P102 = 1, Q102 = 0, and N102 = 1 (a single prolif-
erating cell). Then we can eliminate the nuisance constant K by taking the indefinite integral in

Problem 9 invites the reader to show that if the growth rate is modeled as 
r1N2 = s12N - 12, then the solution of (22) describes logistic growth. Typical curves for the 
Gompertz and logistic models are displayed in Figure 5.23. See also Figure 3.4 on page 98.

1.	 Logistic Model.    In Section 3.2 we discussed the logis-
tic equation
dp
dt = Ap1p - Ap2 ,  p102 = p0 ,
and its use in modeling population growth. A more gen-
eral model might involve the equation
(25)	
dp
dt = Ap1p - Apr ,  p102 = p0 ,
where r 7 1. To see the effect of changing the parameter 
r in (25), take p1 = 3, A = 1, and p0 = 1. Then use a 
numerical scheme such as Runge–Kutta with h = 0.25 
to approximate the solution to (25) on the interval 
0 …  t …  5 for r = 1.5, 2, and 3. What is the limiting 
population in each case? For r 7 1, determine a general 
formula for the limiting population.
2.	 Radioisotopes and Cancer Detection.    A radioiso-
tope commonly used in the detection of breast cancer is  
technetium-99m. This radionuclide is attached to a chem-
ical that upon injection into a patient accumulates at can-
cer sites. The isotope’s radiation is then detected and the 
site located, using gamma cameras or other tomographic 
devices.
Technetium-99m decays radioactively in accordance 
with the equation dy>dt = -ky, with k = 0.1155>h. 
The short half-life of technetium-99m has the advantage 
that its radioactivity does not endanger the patient. A dis-
advantage is that the isotope must be manufactured in a 
cyclotron. Since hospitals are not equipped with cyclo-
trons, doses of technetium-99m have to be ordered in 
advance from medical suppliers.
Suppose a dosage of 5 millicuries (mCi) of techne-
tium-99m is to be administered to a patient. Estimate 
the delivery time from production at the manufacturer 
to arrival at the hospital treatment room to be 24 hours 
and calculate the amount of the radionuclide that the 
hospital must order, to be able to administer the proper 
dosage.
3.	 Secretion of Hormones.    The secretion of hormones 
into the blood is often a periodic activity. If a hormone 
is secreted on a 24-h cycle, then the rate of change of the 
level of the hormone in the blood may be represented by 
the initial value problem
dx
dt = a - b cos pt
12 - kx , x102 = x0 ,
where x1t2 is the amount of the hormone in the blood at 
time t, a is the average secretion rate, b is the amount of 
daily variation in the secretion, and k is a positive con-
stant reflecting the rate at which the body removes the 
hormone from the blood. If a = b = 1, k = 2, and 
x0 = 10, solve for x1t2.
4.	 Prove that the critical point (8) of the Volterra–Lotka sys-
tem is a center; that is, the neighboring trajectories are 
periodic. [Hint: Observe that (9) is separable and show 
that its solutions can be expressed as
(26)

Prove that the maximum of the function xpe-qx is  
1p>qe2p, occurring at the unique value x = p>q (see 
Figure 5.24), so the critical values (8) maximize the fac-
tors on the left in (26). Argue that if K takes the correspond-
ing maximum value 1A>Be2A1C>De2C, the critical point 
(8) is the (unique) solution of (26), and it cannot be an end-
point of any trajectory for (26) with a lower value of K.†

Section 5.6    Coupled Mass–Spring Systems          283
In this section we extend the mass–spring model of Chapter 4 to include situations in which 
coupled springs connect two masses, both of which are free to move. The resulting motions 
can be very intriguing. For simplicity we’ll neglect the effects of friction, gravity, and external 
forces. Let’s analyze the following experiment.
5.6  Coupled Mass–Spring Systems
Example 1
On a smooth horizontal surface, a mass m1 = 2 kg is attached to a fixed wall by a spring with 
spring constant k1 = 4 N/m. Another mass m2 = 1 kg is attached to the first object by a spring 
with spring constant k2 = 2 N/m. The objects are aligned horizontally so that the springs are their 
natural lengths (Figure 5.26). If both objects are displaced 3 m to the right of their equilibrium 
positions (Figure 5.27) and then released, what are the equations of motion for the two objects?
Solution
From our assumptions, the only forces we need to consider are those due to the springs them-
selves. Recall that Hooke’s law asserts that the force acting on an object due to a spring has 
magnitude proportional to the displacement of the spring from its natural length and has direc-
tion opposite to its displacement. That is, if the spring is either stretched or compressed, then it 
tries to return to its natural length.
Because each mass is free to move, we apply Newton’s second law to each object. Let 
x1t2 denote the displacement (to the right) of the 2-kg mass from its equilibrium position and 
similarly, let y1t2 denote the corresponding displacement for the 1-kg mass. The 2-kg mass has 
a force F1 acting on its left side due to one spring and a force F2 acting on its right side due to 
the second spring. Referring to Figure 5.27 and applying Hooke’s law, we see that
F1 = -k1x ,  F2 = +k21y - x2 ,
since 1y - x2 is the net displacement of the second spring from its natural length. There is only 
one force acting on the 1-kg mass: the force due to the second spring, which is
F3 = -k21y - x2 .
Applying Newton’s second law to these objects, we obtain the system
(1)
	
 m1 d2x
dt2 = F1 + F2 = -k1x + k21y - x2 ,
	
 m2 d2y
dt2 = F3 = -k21y - x2 ,

284          Chapter 5    Introduction to Systems and Phase Plane Analysis
In this problem, we know that m1 = 2, m2 = 1, k1 = 4, and k2 = 2. Substituting these 
values into system (2) yields
(3)	
 2 d2x
dt2 + 6x - 2y = 0 ,
(4)	
 d2y
dt2 + 2y - 2x = 0 .
We’ll use the elimination method of Section 5.2 to solve (3)–(4). With D J d>dt we 
rewrite the system as
(5)	
 12D2 + 623x4 - 2y = 0 ,
(6)	
 -2x + 1D2 + 223y4 = 0 .
Adding 1D2 + 22 applied to equation (5) to 2 times equation (6) eliminates y:
31D2 + 2212D2 + 62 - 443x4 = 0 ,
which simplifies to
(7)	
2 d4x
dt4 + 10 d2x
dt2 + 8x = 0 .
Notice that equation (7) is linear with constant coefficients. To solve it let’s proceed as we 
did with linear second-order equations and try to find solutions of the form x = ert. Substitut-
ing ert in equation (7) gives
21r4 + 5r2 + 42ert = 0 .
Thus, we get a solution to (7) when r satisfies the auxiliary equation
r4 + 5r2 + 4 = 0 .
From the factorization r4 + 5r2 + 4 = 1r2 + 121r2 + 42, we see that the roots of the auxiliary 
equation are complex numbers i, -i, 2i, -2i. Using Euler’s formula, it follows that
z11t2 = eit = cos t + i sin t  and  z21t2 = e2it = cos 2t + i sin 2t
are complex-valued solutions to equation (7). To obtain real-valued solutions, we take the real 
and imaginary parts of z11t2 and z21t2. Thus, four real-valued solutions are
x11t2 = cos t ,  x21t2 = sin t ,  x31t2 = cos 2t ,  x41t2 = sin 2t ,
and a general solution is
(8)	
x1t2 = a1 cos t + a2 sin t + a3 cos 2t + a4 sin 2t ,
where a1, a2, a3, and a4 are arbitrary constants.†
To obtain a formula for y1t2, we use equation (3) to express y in terms of x:
 y1t2 = d2x
dt2 + 3x
 = -a1 cos t - a2 sin t - 4a3 cos 2t - 4a4 sin 2t
+ 3a1 cos t + 3a2 sin t + 3a3 cos 2t + 3a4 sin 2t ,
†A more detailed discussion of general solutions is given in Chapter 6.

Section 5.6    Coupled Mass–Spring Systems          285
and so
(9)	
y1t2 = 2a1 cos t + 2a2 sin t −a3 cos 2t −a4 sin 2t .
To determine the constants a1, a2, a3, and a4, let’s return to the original problem. We were 
told that the objects were originally displaced 3 m to the right and then released. Hence,
(10)	
x102 = 3 ,  dx
dt
 102 = 0 ;  y102 = 3 ,  dy
dt
 102 = 0 .
On differentiating equations (8) and (9), we find
dx
dt = -a1 sin t + a2 cos t - 2a3 sin 2t + 2a4 cos 2t ,
dy
dt = -2a1 sin t + 2a2 cos t + 2a3 sin 2t - 2a4 cos 2t .
Now, if we put t = 0 in the formulas for x, dx>dt, y, and dy>dt, the initial conditions (10) give 
the four equations
 x102 = a1 + a3 = 3 ,    dx
dt
 102 = a2 + 2a4  = 0 ,
 y102 = 2a1 - a3 = 3 ,   dy
dt
 102 = 2a2 - 2a4 = 0 .
From this system, we find a1 = 2, a2 = 0, a3 = 1, and a4 = 0. Hence, the equations of 
motion for the two objects are
x1t2 = 2 cos t + cos 2t ,
y1t2 = 4 cos t - cos 2t ,
which are depicted in Figure 5.28.  ◆

Figure 5.28 Graphs of the motion of the two masses in the coupled mass–spring system

286          Chapter 5    Introduction to Systems and Phase Plane Analysis
The general solution pair (8), (9) that we have obtained is a combination of sinusoids 
oscillating at two different angular frequencies: 1 rad/sec and 2 rad/sec. These frequencies 
extend the notion of the natural frequency of the single (free, undamped) mass–spring oscil-
lator (page 212, Section 4.9) and are called the natural (or normal) angular frequencies† of 
the system. A complex system consisting of more masses and springs would have many normal 
frequencies.
Notice that if the initial conditions were altered so that the constants a3 and a4 in (8) and 
(9) were zero, the motion would be a pure sinusoid oscillating at the single frequency 1 rad/sec. 
Similarly, if a1 and a2 were zero, only the 2 rad/sec oscillation would be “excited.” Such solu-
tions, wherein the entire motion is described by a single sinusoid, are called the normal modes 
of the system.‡ The normal modes in the following example are particularly easy to visualize 
because we will take all the masses and all the spring constants to be equal.
†The study of the natural frequencies of oscillations of complex systems is known in engineering as modal analysis.
‡The normal modes are more naturally characterized in terms of eigenvalues (see Section 9.5).
Example 2
Three identical springs with spring constant k and two identical masses m are attached in a 
straight line with the ends of the outside springs fixed (see Figure 5.29). Determine and 
interpret the normal modes of the system.

Solution
We define the displacements from equilibrium, x and y, as in Example 1 on page 283. The 
equations expressing Newton’s second law for the masses are quite analogous to (1), except for 
the effect of the third spring on the second mass:
(11)	
 mx″ = -kx + k1y - x2 ,
(12)	
 my″ = -k1y - x2 - ky ,
or
 1mD2 + 2k23x4 - ky = 0 ,
 -kx + 1mD2 + 2k23y4 = 0 .
Eliminating y in the usual manner results in
(13)	
3 1mD2 + 2k22 - k24 3x4 = 0 .
This has the auxiliary equation
1mr2 + 2k22 - k2 = 1mr2 + k21mr2 + 3k2 = 0 ,
with roots { i2k>m, { i23k>m. Setting v J 2k>m, we get the following general solution 
to (13):
(14)	
x1t2 = C1 cos vt + C2 sin vt + C3 cos1 23vt2 + C4 sin1 23vt2 .

Section 5.6    Coupled Mass–Spring Systems          287
To obtain y1t2, we solve for y1t2 in (11) and substitute x1t2 as given in (14). Upon sim-
plifying, we get
(15)	
y1t2 = C1 cos vt + C2 sin vt - C3 cos1 23vt2 - C4 sin1 23vt2 .
From the formulas (14) and (15), we see that the normal angular frequencies are 
v and 23 v. Indeed, if C3 = C4 = 0, we have a solution where y1t2 K x1t2, oscillating at 
the angular frequency v = 2k>m rad/sec (equivalent to a frequency 2k>m>2p periods/sec).  
Now if x1t2 K y1t2 in Figure 5.29, the two masses are moving as if they were a single 
rigid body of mass 2m, forced by a “double spring” with a spring constant given by 2k. And 
indeed, according to equation (4) of Section 4.9 (page 212), we would expect such a system 
to oscillate at the angular frequency 22k>2m = 2k>m (!). This motion is depicted in 
Figure 5.30(a).
Similarly, if C1 = C2 = 0, we find the second normal mode where y1t2 = -x1t2, so that 
in Figure 5.29 there are two mirror-image systems, each with mass m and a “spring and a half” 
with spring constant k + 2k = 3k. (The half-spring will be twice as stiff.) Section 4.9’s equa-
tion (4) then predicts an angular oscillation frequency for each system of 23k>m = 23 v, 
which again is consistent with (14) and (15). This motion is shown in Figure 5.30(b).  ◆

The equations governing the voltage–current relations for the resistor, inductor, and capacitor 
were given in Section 3.5, together with Kirchhoff’s laws that constrain how these quantities 
behave when the elements are electrically connected into a circuit. Now that we have the tools 
for solving linear equations of higher-order systems, we are in a position to analyze more com-
plex electrical circuits.
5.7  Electrical Systems
Example 1
The series RLC circuit in Figure 5.37 on page 290 has a voltage source given by E1t2 = sin 100t 
volts (V), a resistor of 0.02 ohms 1Ω2, an inductor of 0.001 henrys (H), and a capacitor of 2 
farads (F). (These values are selected for numerical convenience; typical capacitance values are 
much smaller.) If the initial current and the initial charge on the capacitor are both zero, deter-
mine the current in the circuit for t 7 0.
Solution
Using the notation of Section 3.5, we have L = 0.001 H, R = 0.02 Ω, C = 2 F, and 
E1t2 = sin 100t. According to Kirchhoff’s current law, the same current I passes through each circuit 
element. The current through the capacitor equals the instantaneous rate of change of its charge q:
(1)	
I = dq>dt .
From the physics equations in Section 3.5, we observe that the voltage drops across the 
capacitor (EC), the resistor (ER), and the inductor (EL) are expressed as
(2)	
EC = q
C ,  ER = RI ,  EL = L dI
dt .
Therefore, Kirchhoff’s voltage law, which implies EL + ER + EC = E, can be expressed as
(3)	
L dI
dt + RI + 1

 q = E1t2 .

290          Chapter 5    Introduction to Systems and Phase Plane Analysis
In most applications we will be interested in determining the current I1t2. If we differentiate 
(3) with respect to t and substitute I for dq>dt, we obtain
(4)	
L d2I

dt + 1
C
 I = dE

After substitution of the given values this becomes
10.0012 d2I
dt2 + 10.022 dI
dt + 10.52I = 100 cos 100t ,
or, equivalently,
(5)	
d2I
dt2 + 20 dI
dt + 500I = 100,000 cos 100t .
The homogeneous equation associated with (5) has the auxiliary equation
r2 + 20r + 500 = 1r + 1022 + 12022 = 0 ,
whose roots are -10 { 20i. Hence, the solution to the homogeneous equation is
(6)	
Ih1t2 = C1e-10t cos 20t + C2e-10t sin 20t .
To find a particular solution for (5), we can use the method of undetermined coefficients. Setting
Ip1t2 = A cos 100t + B sin 100t
and carrying out the procedure in Section 4.5, we ultimately find, to three decimals,
A = -10.080 ,  B = 2.122 .
Hence, a particular solution to (5) is given by
(7)	
Ip1t2 = -10.080 cos 100t + 2.122 sin 100t .
Since I = Ih + Ip, we find from (6) and (7) that
(8)	
I1t2 = e-10t1C1 cos 20t + C2 sin 20t2 - 10.080 cos 100t + 2.122 sin 100t .
To determine the constants C1 and C2, we need the values I102 and I′102. We were given 
I102 = q102 = 0. To find I′102, we substitute the values for L, R, and C into equation (3) 
and equate the two sides at t = 0. This gives
10.0012I′102 + 10.022I102 + 10.52q102 = sin 0 .

Section 5.7    Electrical Systems          291
Because I102 = q102 = 0, we find I′102 = 0. Finally, using I1t2 in (8) and the initial 
conditions I102 = I′102 = 0, we obtain the system
 I102 = C1 - 10.080 = 0 ,
 I′102 = -10C1 + 20C2 + 212.2 = 0 .
Solving this system yields C1 = 10.080 and C2 = -5.570. Hence, the current in the RLC 
series circuit is
(9)	
I1t2 = e-10t110.080 cos 20t - 5.570 sin 20t2 - 10.080 cos 100t + 2.122 sin 100t .  ◆
Observe that, as was the case with forced mechanical vibrations, the current in (9) is made 
up of two components. The first, Ih, is a transient current that tends to zero as t S + ∞. The 
second,
Ip1t2 = -10.080 cos 100t + 2.122 sin 100t ,
is a sinusoidal steady-state current that remains.
It is straightforward to verify that the steady-state solution Ip1t2 that arises from the more 
general voltage source E1t2 = E0 sin gt is
(10)	
Ip1t2 =
E0 sin1gt + u2
2R2 + 3gL - 1>1gC242 ,
where tan u = 11>C - Lg22>1gR2 (compare Section 4.10, page 221).

Solution
To determine the charge and currents in the electrical network, we begin by observing that the 
network consists of three closed circuits: loop 1 through the battery, resistor, and inductor; loop 
2 through the battery, resistor, and capacitor; and loop 3 containing the capacitor and inductor. 
Taking advantage of Kirchhoff’s current law, we denote the current passing through the battery 
and the resistor by I1, the current through the inductor by I2, and the current through the capaci-
tor by I3. For consistency of notation, we denote the charge on the capacitor by q3. Hence, 
I3 = dq3>dt.

292          Chapter 5    Introduction to Systems and Phase Plane Analysis
As discussed at the beginning of this section, the voltage drop at a resistor is RI, at an 
inductor LdI>dt, and at a capacitor q>C. So, applying Kirchhoff’s voltage law to the electrical 
network in Figure 5.38, we find for loop 1,
(11)	
  dI2
dt +  20I1 =  5 ;
(inductor)           (resistor)          (battery)
for loop 2,
(12)	
  20I1  +   160q3  =   5 ;
(resistor)              (capacitor)               (battery)
and for loop 3,
(13)	
 − dI2
dt +  160q3 = 0 .
(inductor)                  (capacitor)
[The minus sign in (13) arises from taking a clockwise path around loop 3 so that the current 
passing through the inductor is –I2.] Notice that these three equations are not independent: We 
can obtain equation (13) by subtracting (11) from (12). Hence, we have only two equations 
from which to determine the three unknowns I1, I2, and q3. If we now apply Kirchhoff’s current 
law to the two junction points in the network, we find at point A that I1 - I2 - I3 = 0 and at 
point B that I2 + I3 - I1 = 0. In both cases, we get
(14)	
I1 - I2 - dq3
dt = 0 ,
since I3 = dq3>dt. Assembling equations (11), (12), and (14) into a system, we have (with 
D = d>dt)
(15)	
 DI2 + 20I1 = 5 ,
(16)	
 20I1 + 160q3 = 5 ,
(17)	
 -I2 + I1 - Dq3 = 0 .
We solve these by the elimination method of Section 5.2. Using equation (16) to eliminate I1 
from the others, we are left with
(18)	
 DI2 - 160q3 = 0 ,
(19)	
 20I2 + 120D + 1602q3 = 5 .
Elimination of I2 then leads to
(20)	
20D2q3 + 160Dq3 + 3200q3 = 0 .
To obtain the initial conditions for the second-order equation (20), recall that at time t = 0, 
the charge on the capacitor is 2 coulombs and the current is zero. Hence,
(21)	
q3102 = 2 ,  dq3
dt
 102 = 0 .

Section 5.7    Electrical Systems          293
We can now solve the initial value problem (20)–(21) using the techniques of Chapter 4. 
Ultimately, we find
 q31t2 = 2e-4t cos 12t + 2

 e-4t sin 12t ,
 I31t2 = dq3

 1t2 = - 80

Next, to determine I2, we substitute these expressions into (19) and obtain

 1t2 - 8q31t2
 = 1

Note that the differential equations that describe mechanical vibrations and RLC series 
circuits are essentially the same. And, in fact, there is a natural identification of the parameters 
m, b, and k for a mass–spring system with the parameters L, R, and C that describe circuits. 
This is illustrated in Table 5.3. Moreover, the terms transient, steady-state, overdamped, criti-
cally damped, underdamped, and resonant frequency described in Sections 4.9 and 4.10 apply 
to electrical circuits as well.
This analogy between a mechanical system and an electrical circuit extends to large-scale 
systems and circuits. An interesting consequence of this is the use of analog simulation and, in 
particular, analog computers to analyze mechanical systems. Large-scale mechanical systems 
are modeled by building a corresponding electrical system and then measuring the charges 
q1t2 and currents I1t2.
Although such analog simulations are important, both large-scale mechanical and electri-
cal systems are currently modeled using digital computer simulation. This involves the numeri-
cal solution of the initial value problem governing the system. Still, the analogy between 
mechanical and electrical systems means that basically the same computer software can be 
used to analyze both systems.

9.	 Because of Euler’s formula, eiu = cos u + i sin u, it is

In this section we take an excursion through an area of mathematics that has received a lot of 
attention both for the interesting mathematical phenomena being observed and for its applica-
tion to fields such as meteorology, heat conduction, fluid mechanics, lasers, chemical reactions, 
and nonlinear circuits, among others. The area is that of nonlinear dynamical systems.†
A dynamical system is any system that allows one to determine (at least theoretically) the 
future states of the system given its present or past state. For example, the recursive formula 
(difference equation)
xn+1 = 11.052xn ,  n = 0, 1, 2, c
is a dynamical system, since we can determine the next state, xn+1, given the previous state, xn. 
If we know x0, then we can compute any future state 3indeed, xn+1 = x011.052n+14.
Another example of a dynamical system is provided by the differential equation
dx
dt = -2x ,
where the solution x1t2 specifies the state of the system at “time” t. If we know x1t02 = x0, 
then we can determine the state of the system at any future time t 7 t0 by solving the initial 
value problem
dx
dt = -2x ,  x1t02 = x0 .
Indeed, a simple calculation yields x1t2 = x0e-21t-t02 for t Ú t0.
For a dynamical system defined by a differential equation, it is often helpful to work with 
a related dynamical system defined by a difference equation. For example, when we cannot 
express the solution to a differential equation using elementary functions, we can use a numeri-
cal technique such as the improved Euler’s method or Runge–Kutta to approximate the solu-
tion to an initial value problem. This numerical scheme defines a new (but related) dynamical 
system that is often easier to study.
In Section 5.4, we used phase plane diagrams to study autonomous systems in the plane. Many 
important features of the system can be detected just by looking at these diagrams. For example, a 
closed trajectory corresponds to a periodic solution. The trajectories for nonautonomous systems in

the phase plane are much more complicated to decipher. One technique that is helpful in this regard 
is the so-called Poincaré map. As we will see, these maps replace the study of a nonautonomous 
system with the study of a dynamical system defined by the location in the xy-plane 1y = dx>dt2 
of the solution at regularly spaced moments in time such as t = 2pn, where n = 0, 1, 2, . . . . The 
advantage in using the Poincaré map will become clear when the method is applied to a nonlinear 
problem for which no explicit solution is known. In such a case, the trajectories are computed using 
a numerical scheme such as Runge–Kutta. Several software packages have options that will con-
struct Poincaré maps for a given system.
To illustrate the Poincaré map, consider the equation
(1)	
x″1t2 + v2x1t2 = F cos t ,
where F and v are positive constants. We studied similar equations in Section 4.10 and found 
that a general solution for v ≠1 is given by
(2)	
x1t2 = A sin1vt + f2 +
F
v2 - 1 cos t ,
where the amplitude A and the phase angle f are arbitrary constants. Since y = x′,
y1t2 = vA cos1vt + f2 -
F
v2 - 1
 sin t .
Because the forcing function F cos t is 2p-periodic, it is natural to seek 2p-periodic solutions 
to (1). For this purpose, we define the Poincaré map as
(3)	
xn J x12pn2 = A sin12pvn + f2 + F>1v2 - 12 ,
	
yn J y12pn2 = vA cos12pvn + f2 ,
for n = 0, 1, 2, . . . . In Figure 5.43 on page 297, we plotted the first 100 values of 1xn, yn2 in 
the xy-plane for different choices of v. For simplicity, we have taken A = F = 1 and f = 0. 
These graphs are called Poincaré sections. We will interpret them shortly.
Now let’s play the following game. We agree to ignore the fact that we already know the 
formula for x1t2 for all t Ú 0. We want to see what information about the solution we can 
glean just from the Poincaré section and the form of the differential equation.
Notice that the first two Poincaré sections in Figure 5.43, corresponding to v = 2 and 3, 
consist of a single point. This tells us that, starting with t = 0, every increment 2p of t returns 
us to the same point in the phase plane. This in turn implies that equation (1) has a 2p-periodic 
solution, which can be proved as follows: For v = 2, let x1t2 be the solution to (1) with 
1x102, y1022 = 11>3, 22 and let X1t2 J x1t + 2p2. Since the Poincaré section is just the 
point 11>3, 22, we have X102 = x12p2 = 1>3 and X′102 = x′12p2 = 2. Thus, x1t2 and 
X1t2 have the same initial values at t = 0. Further, because cos t is 2p-periodic, we also have
X″1t2 + v2X1t2 = x″1t + 2p2 + v2x1t + 2p2 = cos1t + 2p2 = cos t .
Consequently, x1t2 and X1t2 satisfy the same initial value problem. By the uniqueness theo-
rems of Sections 4.2 and 4.5, these functions must agree on the interval [0, ∞2. Hence, x1t2 =
X1t2 = x1t + 2p2 for all t Ú 0; that is, x1t2 is 2p-periodic. (The same reasoning works for 
v = 3.) With a similar argument, it follows from the Poincaré section for v = 1>2 that there 
is a solution of period 4p that alternates between the two points displayed in Figure 5.43(c) as t 
is incremented by 2p. For the case v = 1>3, we deduce that there is a solution of period 6p 
rotating among three points, and for v = 1>4, there is an 8p-periodic solution rotating among 
four points. We call these last three solutions subharmonics.
The case v = 12 is different. So far, in Figure 5.43(f), none of the points has repeated. 
Did we stop too soon? Will the points ever repeat? Here, the fact that 12 is irrational plays 

Section 5.8    Dynamical Systems, Poincaré Maps, and Chaos          297
a crucial role. It turns out that every integer n yields a distinct point in the Poincaré section 
(see Problem 8). However, there is a pattern developing. The points all appear to lie on a sim-
ple curve, possibly an ellipse. To see that this is indeed the case, notice that when v = 22, 
A = F = 1, and f = 0, we have
xn = sin1222 pn2 + 1 ,  yn = 22 cos1222 pn2 ,  n = 0, 1, 2, . . . .
It is then an easy computation to show that each 1xn, yn2 lies on the ellipse
1x - 122 + y2
2 = 1 .
In our investigation of equation (1), we concentrated on 2p-periodic solutions because 
the forcing term Fcos t has period 2p. [We observed subharmonics when v = 1>2, 1>3, and  
1>4—that is, solutions with periods 212p2, 312p2, and 412p2.] When a damping term is 
introduced into the differential equation, the Poincaré map displays a different behavior. Recall

that the solution will now be the sum of a transient and a steady-state term. For example, let’s 
analyze the equation
(4)	
x″1t2 + bx′1t2 + v2x1t2 = F cos t ,
where b, F, and v are positive constants.
When b2 6 4v2, the solution to (4) can be expressed as

21v2 - 122 + b2 sin1t + u2 ,
where tan u = 1v2 - 12>b and A and f are arbitrary constants [compare equations (7) and (8) 
in Section 4.10]. The first term on the right-hand side of (5) is the transient and the second term, 
the steady-state solution. Let’s construct the Poincaré map using t = 2pn, n = 0, 1, 2, . . . .  
We will take b = 0.22, v = A = F = 1, and f = 0 to simplify the computations. Because 
tan u = 1v2 - 12>b = 0, we will take u = 0 as well. Then we have
 x12pn2 = xn = e-0.22pnsin1 20.9879 2pn2 ,

10.222 .
The Poincaré section for n = 0, 1, 2, . . . , 10 is shown in Figure 5.44 (black points). After just 
a few iterations, we observe that xn ≈0 and yn ≈1>10.222 ≈4.545; that is, the points of the 
Poincaré section are approaching a single point in the xy-plane (colored point). Thus, we might 
expect that there is a 2p-periodic solution corresponding to a particular choice of A and f. [In 
this example, where we can explicitly represent the solution, we see that indeed a 2p-periodic 
solution arises when we take A = 0 in (5).]
There is an important difference between the Poincaré sections for equation (1) and those 
for equation (4). In Figure 5.43, the location of all of the points in (a)–(e) depends on the initial 
value selected (here A = 1 and f = 0). (See Problem 10.) However, in Figure 5.44, the first 
few points (black points) depend on the initial conditions, while the limit point (colored point) 
does not (see Problem 6). The latter behavior is typical for equations that have a “damping”

term (i.e., b 7 0); namely, the Poincaré section has a limit set† that is essentially independent 
of the initial conditions.
For equations with damping, the limit set may be more complicated than just a point. For 
example, the Poincaré map for the equation
(6)	
x″1t2 + 10.222x′1t2 + x1t2 = cos t + cos1 22t2
has a limit set consisting of an ellipse (see Problem 11). This is illustrated in Figure 5.45 for the 
initial values x0 = 2, y0 = 4 and x0 = 2, y0 = 6.
So far we have seen limit sets for the Poincaré map that were either a single point or an 
ellipse—independent of the initial values. These particular limit sets are attractors. In general, 
an attractor is a set A with the property that there exists an open set‡ B containing A such that 
whenever the Poincaré map enters B, its points remain in B and the limit set of the Poincaré 
map is a subset of A. Further, we assume A has the invariance property: Whenever the Poincaré 
map starts at a point in A, it remains in A.
In the previous examples, the attractors of the dynamical system (Poincaré map) were 
easy to describe. In recent years, however, many investigators, working on a variety of applica-
tions, have encountered dynamical systems that do not behave orderly—their attractor sets are 
very complicated (not just isolated points or familiar geometric objects such as ellipses). The 
behavior of such systems is called chaotic, and the corresponding limit sets are referred to as 
strange attractors.
†The limit set for a map 1xn, yn2, n = 1, 2, 3, . . . , is the set of points 1p, q2 such that limkS ∞1xnk, ynk2 = 1p, q2, 
where n1 6 n2 6 n3 6 cis some subsequence of the positive integers.
‡A set B ⊂R2 is an open set if for each point p ∈B there is an open disk V containing p such that V ⊂B.

To illustrate chaotic behavior and what is meant by a strange attractor, we discuss two non-
linear differential equations and a simple difference equation. First, let’s consider the forced 
Duffing equation
(7)	
x″1t2 + bx′1t2 −x1t2 + x31t2 = F sin Gt .
We cannot express the solution to (7) in any explicit form, so we must obtain the Poincaré 
map by numerically approximating the solution to (7) for fixed initial values and then plot 
the approximations for x12pn>g2 and y12pn>g2 = x′12pn>g2. (Because the forcing term 
F sin gt has period 2p>g, we seek 2p>g-periodic solutions and subharmonics.) In Figure 5.46, 
we display the limit sets (attractors) when b = 0.3 and g = 1.2 in the cases (a) F = 0.2, 
(b) F = 0.28, (c) F = 0.29, and (d) F = 0.37.
Notice that as the constant F increases, the Poincaré map changes character. When 
F = 0.2, the Poincaré section tells us that there is a 2p>g-periodic solution. For F = 0.28, 
there is a subharmonic of period 4p>g, and for F = 0.29 and 0.37, there are subharmonics 
with periods 8p>g and 10p>g, respectively.
Things are dramatically different when F = 0.5: The solution is neither 2p>g-periodic nor 
subharmonic. The Poincaré section for F = 0.5 is illustrated in Figure 5.47 on page 301. This 
section was generated by numerically approximating the solution to (7) when g = 1.2, b = 0.3, 
and F = 0.5, for fixed initial values.† Not all of the approximations x12pn>g2 and y12pn>g2 
that were calculated are graphed; because of the presence of a transient solution, the first few 
points were omitted. It turns out that the plotted set is essentially independent of the initial 
values and has the property that once a point is in the set, all subsequent points lie in the set.

†Historical Footnote: When researchers first encountered these strange-looking Poincaré sections, they would check 
their computations using different computers and different numerical schemes [see Hénon and Heiles, “The Applica-
bility of the Third Integral of Motion: Some Numerical Experiments,” Astronomical Journal, Vol. 69 (1964): 75]. For 
special types of dynamical systems, such as the Hénon map, it can be shown that there exists a true trajectory 
that shadows the numerical trajectory [see M. Hammel, J. A. Yorke, and C. Grebogi, “Numerical Orbits of Chaotic 
Processes Represent True Orbits,” Bulletin American Mathematical Society, Vol. 19 (1988): 466–469].

Section 5.8    Dynamical Systems, Poincaré Maps, and Chaos          301
Because of the complicated shape of the set, it is indeed a strange attractor. While the shape of 
the strange attractor does not depend on the initial values, the picture does change if we con-
sider different sections; for example, t = 12pn + p>22>g, n = 0, 1, 2, . . . yields a different 
configuration.
Another example of a strange attractor occurs when we consider the forced pendulum 
equation
(8)	
x″1t2 + bx′1t2 + sin1x1t22 = F cos t ,
where the x1t2 term in (4) has been replaced by sin1x1t22. Here x1t2 is the angle between the 
pendulum and the vertical rest position, b is related to damping, and F represents the strength 
of the forcing function (see Figure 5.48). For F = 2.7 and b = 0.22, we have graphed in 
Figure 5.49 approximately 90,000 points in the Poincaré map. Since we cannot express the 
solution to (8) in any explicit form, the Poincaré map was obtained by numerically approximat-
ing the solution to (8) for fixed initial values and plotting the approximations for x12pn2 and 
y12pn2 = x′12pn2.
The Poincaré maps for the forced Duffing equation and for the forced pendulum equation 
not only illustrate the idea of a strange attractor; they also exhibit another peculiar behavior 
called chaos. Chaos occurs when small changes in the initial conditions lead to major changes 
in the behavior of the solution. Henri Poincaré described the situation as follows:
It may happen that small differences in the initial conditions will produce 
very large ones in the final phenomena. A small error in the former produces 
an enormous error in the latter. Prediction becomes impossible . . . .

In a physical experiment, we can never exactly (with infinite accuracy) reproduce the same 
initial conditions. Consequently, if the behavior is chaotic, even a slight difference in the initial 
conditions may lead to quite different values for the corresponding Poincaré map when n is 
large. Such behavior does not occur for solutions to either equation (4) or equation (1) (see 
Problems 6 and 7). However, two solutions to the Duffing equation (7) with F = 0.5 that cor-
respond to two different but close initial values have Poincaré maps that do not remain close 
together. Although they both are attracted to the same set, their locations with respect to this set 
may be relatively far apart.
The phenomenon of chaos can also be illustrated by the following simple map. Let x0 lie 
in 30, 12 and define
(9)	
xn+1 = 2xn (mod 1) ,
where by (mod 1) we mean the decimal part of the number if it is greater than or equal to 1; that is
xn+1 = e2xn ,
for 0 … xn 6 1>2 ,
2xn - 1 ,
for 1>2 … xn 6 1 .
When x0 = 1>3, we find
x1 = 2 # 11>32 1mod 12 = 2>3 ,
x2 = 2 # 12>32 1mod 12 = 4>3 1mod 12 = 1>3 ,
x3 = 2 # 11>32 1mod 12 = 2>3 ,
x4 = 2 # 12>32 1mod 12 = 1>3 ,    etc.
Written as a sequence, we get 51>3, 2>3, 1>3, 2>3, . . .6, where the overbar denotes the 
repeated pattern.
What happens when we pick a starting value x0 near 1>3? Does the sequence cluster about 
1>3 and 2>3 as does the mapping when x0 = 1>3? For example, when x0 = 0.3, we get the 
sequence
50.3, 0.6, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 0.6, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, . . .6 .
In Figure 5.50, we have plotted the values of xn for x0 = 0.3, 0.33, and 0.333. We have 
not plotted the first few terms, but only those that repeat. (This omission of the first few terms 
parallels the situation depicted in Figure 5.47 on page 301, where transient solutions arise.)
It is clear from Figure 5.50 that while the values for x0 are getting closer to 1>3, the cor-
responding maps are spreading out over the whole interval 30, 14 and not clustering near 1>3 
and 2>3. This behavior is chaotic, since the Poincaré maps for initial values near 1>3 behave 
quite differently from the map for x0 = 1>3. If we had selected x0 to be irrational (which we 
can’t do with a calculator), the sequence would not repeat and would be dense in 30, 14.

A software package that supports the construction of Poincaré 
maps is required for the problems in this section.
1.	 Compute and graph the points of the Poincaré map 
with t = 2pn, n = 0, 1, . . . , 20 for equation (1), tak-
ing A = F = 1, f = 0, and v = 3>2. Repeat, taking 
v = 3>5. Do you think the equation has a 2p-periodic 
solution for either choice of v? A subharmonic solution?
2.	 Compute and graph the points of the Poincaré map with 
t = 2pn, n = 0, 1, . . . , 20 for equation (1), taking 
A = F = 1, f = 0, and v = 1> 13. Describe the limit 
set for this system.
3.	 Compute and graph the points of the Poincaré map with 
t = 2pn, n = 0, 1, . . . , 20 for equation (4), taking 
A = F = 1, f = 0, v = 1, and b = -0.1. What is 
happening to these points as n S ∞?
4.	 Compute and graph the Poincaré map with t = 2pn, 
n = 0, 1, . . . , 20 for equation (4), taking A = F = 1, 
f = 0, v = 1, and b = 0.1. Describe the attractor for 
this system.
5.	 Compute and graph the Poincaré map with t = 2pn, 
n = 0, 1, . . . , 20 for equation (4), taking A = F = 1, 
f = 0, v = 1>3, and b = 0.22. Describe the attractor 
for this system.
6.	 Show that for b 7 0, the Poincaré map for equation (4) is 
not chaotic by showing that as t gets large
 xn = x12pn2 ≈
F
21v2 - 122 + b2 sin12pn + u2 ,
 yn = x′12pn2 ≈
F
21v2 - 122 + b2
  cos12pn + u2
independent of the initial values x0 = x102 and 
y0 = x′102.
7.	 Show that the Poincaré map for equation (1) is not cha-
otic by showing that if 1x0, y02 and 1x*0, y*02 are two 
initial values that define the Poincaré maps {1xn, yn2} 
and 51x*n, y*n26, respectively, using the recursive for-
mulas in (3), then one can make the distance between 
1xn, yn2 and 1x*n, y*n2 small by making the distance 
between 1x0, y02 and 1x*0, y*02 small. [Hint: Let 1A, f2 
and 1A*, f*2 be the polar coordinates of two points in 
the plane. From the law of cosines, it follows that the 
distance d between them is given by d2 = 1A - A*22 + 
2AA*31 - cos1f - f*24.]
8.	 Consider the Poincaré maps defined in (3) with 
v = 12, A = F = 1, and f = 0. If this map were ever 
to repeat, then for two distinct positive integers n and m, 
sin1212pn2 = sin1212pm2. Using basic proper-
ties of the sine function, show that this would imply that 
12 is rational. It follows from this contradiction that the 
points of the Poincaré map do not repeat.
9.	 The doubling modulo 1 map defined by equation (9) 
exhibits some fascinating behavior. Compute the sequence 
obtained when
	
	(a)	 x0 = k>7 for k = 1, 2, . . . , 6 .
	
	(b)	 x0 = k>15 for k = 1, 2, . . . , 14 .
	
	(c)	 x0 = k>2j, where j is a positive integer and k = 1, 
2, . . . , 2j - 1 .
	 Numbers of the form k>2j are called dyadic numbers 
and are dense in 30, 14. That is, there is a dyadic num-
ber arbitrarily close to any real number (rational or 
irrational).
10.	 To show that the limit set of the Poincaré map given in 
(3) depends on the initial values, do the following:
	
	(a)	 Show that when v = 2 or 3, the Poincaré map con-
sists of the single point
1x, y2 = aA sin f +
F
v2 - 1 , vA cos fb .
	
	(b)	 Show that when v = 1>2, the Poincaré map alter-
nates between the two points
a
F
v2 - 1 { A sin f , { vA cos fb .
	
	(c)	 Use the results of parts (a) and (b) to show that when 
v =  2, 3, or 1>2, the Poincaré map (3) depends on 
the initial values 1x0, y02.
5.8  EXERCISES
Systems that exhibit chaotic behavior arise in many applications. The challenge to engi-
neers is to design systems that avoid this chaos and, instead, enjoy the property of stability. 
The topic of stable systems is discussed at length in Chapter 12.†

xn J x12pn2, yn J x′12pn2, where x1t2 is a solution 
to equation (6), is an ellipse and that this ellipse is the 
same for any initial values x0, y0, do the following:
	
	(a)	 Argue that since the initial values affect only the

that the closer you start to the limiting point, the sooner 
the transient part will die out.) Compare your map with 
Figure 5.46(a) on page 300. Redo for F = 0.28.

does the solution exhibit?
15.	 Chaos Machine. Chaos can be illustrated using a long 
ruler, a short ruler, a pin, and a tie tack (pivot). Construct 
the double pendulum as shown in Figure 5.51(a). The 
pendulum is set in motion by releasing it from a posi-
tion such as the one shown in Figure 5.51(b). Repeatedly 
set the pendulum in motion, each time trying to release 
it from the same position. Record the number of times 
the short ruler flips over and the direction in which it 
was moving. If the pendulum was released in exactly the 
same position each time, then the motion would be the 
same. However, from your experiments you will observe 
that even beginning close to the same position leads to 
very different motions. This double pendulum exhibits 
chaotic behavior.

Chapter 5 Summary
Systems of differential equations arise in the study of biological systems, coupled mass–spring 
oscillators, electrical circuits, ecological models, and many other areas.
Linear systems with constant coefficients can be solved explicitly using a variant of the 
Gauss elimination process. For this purpose we begin by writing the system with opera-
tor notation, using D J d>dt, D2 J d2>dt2, and so on. A system of two equations in two 
unknown functions then takes the form
L13x4 + L23y4 = f1 ,        L33x4 + L43y4 = f2 ,
where L1, L2, L3, and L4 are polynomial expressions in D. Applying L4 to the first equation, L2 
to the second, and subtracting, we get a single (typically higher-order) equation in x1t2, namely,
1L4L1 - L2L323x4 = L43 f14 - L23 f24 .

Chapter 5 Summary          305
We then solve this constant coefficient equation for x1t2. Similarly, we can eliminate x from 
the system to obtain a single equation for y1t2, which we can also solve. This procedure intro-
duces some extraneous constants, but by substituting the expressions for x and y back into one 
of the original equations, we can determine the relationships among these constants.
A preliminary step for the application of numerical algorithms for solving systems or sin-
gle equations of higher order is to rewrite them as an equivalent system of first-order equations 
in normal form:
(1)
	
 x=
11t2 = f11t, x1, x2, . . . , xm2 ,
	
 x=
21t2 = f21t, x1, x2, . . . , xm2 ,
f
	
 x=
m1t2 = fm1t, x1, x2, . . . , xm2 .
For example, by setting y = y′, we can rewrite the second-order equation y″ = ƒ1t, y, y′2 as 
the normal system
y′ = y ,
y′ = ƒ1t, y, y2 .
The normal system (1) has the outward appearance of a vectorized version of a single first-
order equation, and as such it suggests how to generalize numerical algorithms such as those of 
Euler and Runge–Kutta.
A technique for studying the qualitative behavior of solutions to the autonomous system
(2)	
dx
dt = ƒ1x, y2 ,  dy
dt = g1x, y2
is phase plane analysis. We begin by finding the critical points of (2)—namely, points 1x0, y02 
where
ƒ1x0, y02 = 0    and    g1x0, y02 = 0 .
The corresponding constant solution pairs x1t2 K x0, y1t2 K y0 are called equilibrium solu-
tions to (2). We then sketch the direction field for the related phase plane differential equation
(3)	
dy
dx = g1x, y2
ƒ1x, y2
with appropriate direction arrows (oriented by the sign of dx>dt or dy>dt). From this we can 
usually conjecture qualitative features of the solutions and of the critical points, such as stabil-

which provide the highways along which the trajectories of the system (2) travel.
Nonautonomous systems can be studied by considering a Poincaré map for the system. A 
Poincaré map can be used to detect periodic and subharmonic solutions and to study systems 
whose solutions exhibit chaotic behavior.

You are a second-year Starfleet Academy Cadet aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise on a continuing 
study of the star system Glia. The object of study on the present expedition is the large airless 
planet Glia-4. A class 1 sensor probe of mass m is to be sent to the planet’s surface to collect data. 
The probe has a modifiable landing system so that it can be used on planets of different grav-
ity. The system consists of a linear spring (force = -kx, where x is displacement), a nonlinear 
spring (force = -ax3), and a shock-damper (force = -bx# ),† all in parallel. Figure 5.53 shows 
a schematic of the system. During the landing process, the probe’s thrusters are used to create a 
constant rate of descent. The velocity at impact varies; the symbol VL is used to denote the largest 
velocity likely to happen in practice. At the instant of impact, (1) the thrust is turned off, and (2) 
the suspension springs are at their unstretched natural length.
(a)	 Let the displacement x be measured from the unstretched length of the springs and be 
taken negative downward (i.e., compression gives a negative x). Show that the equation 
governing the oscillations after impact is
mx$ + bx# + kx + ax3 = -mg .
(b)	 The probe has a mass m = 1220 kg. The linear spring is permanently installed and has 
a stiffness k = 35,600 N/m. The gravity on the surface of Glia-4 is g = 17.5 m/sec2. 
The nonlinear spring is removable; an appropriate spring must be chosen for each mission. 
These nonlinear springs are made of coralidium, a rare and difficult-to-fabricate alloy. 
Therefore, the Enterprise stocks only four different strengths: a = 150,000, 300,000, 
450,000, and 600,000 N/m3. Determine which springs give a compression as close as

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), commonly referred to as staph, is a bacte-
rium that causes serious infections in humans and is resistant to treatment with the widely used 
antibiotic methicillin. MRSA has traditionally been a problem inside hospitals, where elderly 
patients or patients with compromised immune systems could more easily contract the bacte-
ria and develop bloodstream infections. MRSA is implicated in a large percentage of hospital 
fatalities, causing more deaths per year than AIDS. Recently, a genetically different strain of 
MRSA has been found in the community at large. The new strain (CA-MRSA) is able to infect 
healthy and young people, which the traditional strain (HA-MRSA) rarely does. As CA-MRSA 
appears in the community, it is inevitably being spread into hospitals. Some studies suggest that  
CA-MRSA will overtake HA-MRSA in the hospital, which would increase the severity of the 
problem and likely cause more deaths per year.
To predict whether or not CA-MRSA will overtake HA-MRSA, a compartmental model has 
been developed by mathematicians in collaboration with medical professionals (see references 
[1], [2] on page 310). This model classifies all patients in the hospital into three groups:
•	 H1t2 = patients colonized with the traditional hospital strain, HA-MRSA.
•	 C1t2 = patients colonized with the community strain, CA-MRSA.
•	 S1t2 = susceptible patients, those not colonized with either strain.
The parameters of the model are
•	 bC = the rate (per day) at which CA-MRSA is transmitted between patients.
•	 bH = the rate (per day) at which HA-MRSA is transmitted between patients.
•	 dC = the rate (per day) at which patients who are colonized with CA-MRSA exit the 
hospital by death or discharge.
•	 dH = the rate (per day) at which patients who are colonized with HA-MRSA exit the 
hospital by death or discharge.
•	 dS = the rate (per day) at which susceptible patients exit the hospital by death or discharge.
•	 aC = the rate (per day) at which patients who are colonized with CA-MRSA successfully 
undergo decolonization measures.
•	 aH =  the rate (per day) at which patients who are colonized with HA-MRSA successfully 
undergo decolonization measures.
•	 N = the total number of patients in the hospital.
•	 Λ = the rate (per day) at which patients enter the hospital.

possible to 0.3 m without exceeding 0.3 m, when the ship is resting on the surface of 
Glia-4. (The limit of 0.3 m is imposed by unloading clearance requirements.)
(c)	 The other adjustable component on the landing system is the linear shock-damper, which 
may be adjusted in increments of ∆b = 500 N-sec/m, from a low value of 1000 N-sec/m 
to a high value of 10,000 N-sec/m. It is desirable to make b as small as possible because 
a large b produces large forces at impact. However, if b is too small, there is some danger 
that the probe will rebound after impact. To minimize the chance of this, find the small-
est value of b such that the springs are always in compression during the oscillations after 
impact. Use a minimum impact velocity VL = 5 m/sec downward. To find this value of b, 
you will need to use a software package to integrate the differential equation.

Patients move between compartments as they become colonized or decolonized (see Figure 5.54). 
This type of model is typically known as a SIS (susceptible-infected-susceptible) model, in which patients 
who become colonized can become susceptible again and colonized again (there is no immunity).

If we assume that the hospital is always full, we can conserve the system by letting 
Λ = dSS1t2 + dHH1t2 + dCC1t2. In this case S1t2 + C1t2 + H1t2 = N for all t (assuming you 
start with a population of size N).

S is then determined by the equation S1t2 = N - H1t2 - C1t2.

The motion of various-shaped objects that bob in a pool of water can be modeled by a second-
order differential equation derived from Newton’s second law of motion, F = ma. The forces 
acting on the object include the force due to gravity, a frictional force due to the motion of the 
object in the water, and a buoyant force based on Archimedes’ principle: An object that is com-
pletely or partially submerged in a fluid is acted on by an upward (buoyant) force equal to the 
weight of the water it displaces.
(a)	 The first step is to write down the governing differential equation. The dependent 
variable is the depth z of the object’s lowest point in the water. Take z to be negative 
downward so that z = -1 means 1 ft of the object has submerged. Let V1z2 be the 
submerged volume of the object, m be the mass of the object, r be the density of water 
(in pounds per cubic foot), g be the acceleration due to gravity, and gw be the coefficient 
of friction for water. Assuming that the frictional force is proportional to the vertical 
velocity of the object, write down the governing second-order ODE.
(b)	 For the time being, neglect the effect of friction and assume the object is a cube measur-
ing L feet on a side. Write down the governing differential equation for this case. Next, 
designate z = l (a negative number) to be the depth of submersion such that the buoyant 
force is equal and opposite the gravitational force. Introduce a new variable, z, that gives

the displacement of the object from its equilibrium position l (that is, z = z + l). You can 
now write the ODE in a more familiar form. [Hint: Recall the mass–spring system and the 
equilibrium case.] Now you should recognize the type of solution for this problem. What is 
the natural frequency?
(c)	 In this task you consider the effect of friction. The bobbing object is a cube, 1 ft on a 
side, that weighs 32 lb. Let gw = 3 lb-sec/ft, r = 62.57 lb/ft3, and suppose the object 
is initially placed on the surface of the water. Solve the governing ODE by hand to find 
the general solution. Next, find the particular solution for the case in which the cube is 
initially placed on the surface of the water and is given no initial velocity. Provide a plot 
of the position of the object as a function of time t.
(d)	 In this step of the project, you develop a numerical solution to the same problem pre-
sented in part (c). The numerical solution will be useful (indeed necessary) for subse-
quent parts of the project. This case provides a trial to verify that your numerical solution 
is correct. Go back to the initial ODE you developed in part (a). Using parameter values 
given in part (c), solve the initial value problem for the cube starting on the surface with 
no initial velocity. To solve this problem numerically, you will have to write the second-
order ODE as a system of two first-order ODEs, one for vertical position z and one for 
vertical velocity w. Plot your results for vertical position as a function of time t for the 
first 3 or 4 sec and compare with the analytical solution you found in part (c). Are they  
in close agreement? What might you have to do in order to compare these solutions? 
Provide a plot of both your analytical and numerical solutions on the same graph.
(e)	 Suppose a sphere of radius R is allowed to bob in the water. Derive the governing  
second-order equation for the sphere using Archimedes’ principle and allowing for fric-
tion due to its motion in the water. Suppose a sphere weighs 32 lb, has a radius of 1>2 ft,  
and gw = 3.0 lb-sec/ft. Determine the limiting value of the position of the sphere 
without solving the ODE. Next, solve numerically the governing ODE for the velocity 
and position of the sphere as a function of time for a sphere placed on the surface of 
the water. You will need to write the governing second-order ODE as a system of two 
ODEs, one for velocity and one for position. What is the limiting position of the sphere 
for your solution? Does it agree with the equilibrium solution you found above? How 
does it compare with the equilibrium position of the cube? If it is different, explain why.
(f)	 Suppose the sphere in part (d) is a volleyball. Calculate the position of the sphere as a func-
tion of time t for the first 3 sec if the ball is submerged so that its lowest point is 5 ft under 
water. Will the ball leave the water? How high will it go? Next, calculate the ball’s trajectory 
for initial depths lower than 5 ft and higher than 5 ft. Provide plots of velocity and position 
for each case and comment on what you see. Specifically, comment on the relationship 
between the initial depth of the ball and the maximum height the ball eventually attains.
	
  You might consider taking a volleyball into a swimming pool to gather real data in 
order to verify and improve on your model. If you do so, report the data you found and 
explain how you used it for verification and improvement of your model.

of a system and its phase plane implications. This formulation replaces Newton’s second law 
F = ma = my″ and is based on three mathematical manipulations:

(i)	 It is presumed that the force F1t, y, y′2 depends only on y and has an antiderivative 
-V1y2, that is, F = F1y2 = -dV1y2>dy.
(ii)	 The velocity variable y′ is replaced throughout by the momentum p = my′ (so y′ = p>m).
(iii)	The Hamiltonian of the system is defined as
H = H1y, p2 = p2
2m + V1y2 .
(a)	 Express Newton’s law F = my″ as an equivalent first-order system in the manner pre-

(c)	 Using Hamilton’s equations and the chain rule, show that the Hamiltonian remains con-
stant along the solution curves:
d

 H1y, p2 = 0 .
In the formula for the Hamiltonian function H1y, p2, the first term, p2>12m2 = m1y′22>2, 
is the kinetic energy of the mass. By analogy, then, the second term V1y2 is known as the potential 
energy of the mass, and the Hamiltonian is the total energy. The total (mechanical)† energy is 
constant—hence “conserved”—when the forces F1y2 do not depend on time t or velocity y′; 
such forces are called conservative. The energy integral lemma of Section 4.8 (page 203) is sim-
ply an alternate statement of the conservation of energy.
Hamilton’s formulation for mechanical systems and the conservation of energy principle 
imply that the phase plane trajectories of conservative systems lie on the curves where the Hamil-
tonian H1y, p2 is constant, and plotting these curves may be considerably easier than solving for 
the trajectories directly (which, in turn, is easier than solving the original system!).
(d)	 For the mass–spring oscillator of Section 4.1, the spring force is given by F = -ky 
(where k is the spring constant). Find the Hamiltonian, express Hamilton’s equations, 
and show that the phase plane trajectories H1y, p2 = constant for this system are the 
ellipses given by p2>12m2 + ky2>2 = constant. See Figure 5.14, page 269.
The damping force -by′ considered in Section 4.1 is not conservative, of course. Physically 
speaking, we know that damping drains the energy from a system until it grinds to a halt at an 
equilibrium point. In the phase plane, we can qualitatively describe the trajectory as continuously 
migrating to successively lower constant-energy orbits; stable centers become asymptotically 
stable spiral points when damping is taken into consideration.
(e)	 The second Hamiltonian equation (3), which effectively states p′ = my″ = F, has to 
be changed to

when damping is present. Show that the Hamiltonian decreases along trajectories in this 
case (for b 7 0):

A simple mathematical model that can be used to determine the time it would take to clean up the 
Great Lakes can be developed using a multiple compartmental analysis approach.† In particular, 
we can view each lake as a tank that contains a liquid in which is dissolved a particular pollutant 
(DDT, phosphorus, mercury). Schematically, we view the lakes as consisting of five tanks con-
nected as indicated in Figure 5.55.

For our model, we make the following assumptions:
1.  The volume of each lake remains constant.
2.  The flow rates are constant throughout the year.
3.  When a liquid enters the lake, perfect mixing occurs and the pollutants are uniformly 
distributed.
4.  Pollutants are dissolved in the water and enter or leave by inflow or outflow of solution.
Before using this model to obtain estimates on the cleanup times for the lakes, we consider 
some simpler models:
(a)	 Use the outflow rates given in Figure 5.55 to determine the time it would take to “drain” 
each lake. This gives a lower bound on how long it would take to remove all the pollutants.
(b)	 A better estimate is obtained by assuming that each lake is a separate tank with only 
clean water flowing in. Use this approach to determine how long it would take the pol-
lution level in each lake to be reduced to 50% of its original level. How long would it 
take to reduce the pollution to 5% of its original level?
(c)	 Finally, to take into account the fact that pollution from one lake flows into the next lake 
in the chain, use the entire multiple compartment model given in Figure 5.55 to deter-
mine when the pollution level in each lake has been reduced to 50% of its original level, 
assuming pollution has ceased (that is, inflows not from a lake are clean water). Assume 
that all the lakes initially have the same pollution concentration p. How long would it 
take for the pollution to be reduced to 5% of its original level?

We develop a model for the 2014–2015 Ebola epidemic in West Africa, which began in the spring 
of 2014 and spread though the countries of Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea. Initially there was 
great concern that the epidemic might develop with great severity, and even spread globally.† 
Instead, by early 2015 the epidemic had subsided in these West African countries, and in January 
2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that the epidemic was contained in all 
three countries. The reasons that Ebola subsided are complex, but a key role was increased identifi-
cation and isolation of infected cases, and contact tracing of these cases to identify additional cases.
Our model incorporates the principal features of contact tracing, namely, the number of con-
tacts per identified infectious case, the likelihood that a traced contact is infectious, and the effi-
ciency of the isolation of contact-traced individuals. The model consists of a system of ordinary 
differential equations for the compartments of the epidemic population, and is based on an earlier 
version of the model.‡ The model incorporates the unique features of the Ebola outbreaks in this 
region. These features include the rates of transmission to susceptibles from both infectious cases 
and improperly handled deceased cases, the rates of reporting cases, and the rates of recovery and 
mortality of unreported cases.

The model extends the SIR paradigm of Section 5.5, by refining the population classes into 
susceptibles S1t2 (those who have not been affected), exposed E1t2 (incubating cases), I1t2 
(infectious cases), and contaminated deceased C1t2 (improperly handled corpses of cases). The 
successful containment of the epidemic was due to measures isolating infected individuals and 
contaminated corpses, implemented around October 16, 2014. The WHO data in Figure 5.56 
traces the chronology of the number of reported cases R1t2; the inflection point clearly highlights 
the initiation of isolation and contact tracing measures.

By trial and error and numerical experimentation, the following parameter values were found 
to give a good fit, to the WHO data, of the solution of this system. The initial values were taken to 
be S102 = N, E102 = 20, I102 = 20, C102 = 10. Note the change in the values of k, a, and 
c on the 142nd day, reflecting the initiation of contact tracing.

Today’s high-speed communications technology requires circuitry that will measure or match 
incoming radio-frequency oscillations in the gigahertz range. Mathematically, that means one 
must determine the frequency v in a sinusoidal signal A sin1vt + a2 when v is in the neighbor-
hood of 2p * 109 rad>s. In theory this can be accomplished by taking three measurements of the 
sinusoid within a quarter-period. However, obtaining three accurate measurements of a signal 
in an interval of 10-10 seconds is impractical. The phase-locked loop accomplishes the task in 
hardware, using a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) to synthesize another sinusoid B cos u1t2 
whose phase, u1t2, matches that of the incoming signal 1vt + a2. The frequency du1t2>dt of the 
VCO output is linearly related to the voltage applied to the VCO (say, du1t2>dt = E + Fv1t22, 
and it matches v once synchronization is achieved. Thus one can determine the incoming fre-
quency by reading off the VCO voltage.
A diagram of the phase-locked loop circuit is given in Figure 5.58. In brief: the mixer com-
bines the signals A sin 1vt + a2 and B cos u1t2 to create a control signal AB
2  sin3vt + a - u1t24 
whose phase equals the difference between the phase of the incoming signal and the phase of the 
VCO output.† This control signal provides a measure of the lack of synchronization; it is zero 
when u1t2 = vt + a1{2pn2. Thus to help u1t2 catch up to vt + a, the circuit adjusts the VCO 
voltage v1t2 so as to increase the output frequency, du1t2>dt, in proportion to a weighted combi-
nation of the control signal and its derivative:

CHAPTER 
6
Theory of Higher-Order Linear 
Differential Equations
In this chapter we discuss the basic theory of linear higher-order differential equations. The 
material is a generalization of the results we obtained in Chapter 4 for second-order constant-
coefficient equations. In the statements and proofs of these results, we use concepts usually 
covered in an elementary linear algebra course—namely, linear dependence, determinants, 
and methods for solving systems of linear equations. These concepts also arise in the matrix 
approach for solving systems of differential equations and are discussed in Chapter 9, which 
includes a brief review of linear algebraic equations and determinants.
Since this chapter is more mathematically oriented—that is, not tied to any particular 
physical application—we revert to the customary practice of calling the independent variable 
“x” and the dependent variable “y.”
A linear differential equation of order n is an equation that can be written in the form
(1)	
an1x2y1n21x2 + an-11x2y1n-121x2 + g + a01x2y1x2 = b1x2 ,
where a01x2, a11x2, . . . , an1x2 and b1x2 depend only on x, not y. When a0, a1, . . . , an are 
all constants, we say equation (1) has constant coefficients; otherwise it has variable coef-
ficients. If b1x2 K 0, equation (1) is called homogeneous; otherwise it is nonhomogeneous.
In developing a basic theory, we assume that a01x2, a11x2, . . . , an1x2 and b1x2 are all 
continuous on an interval I and an1x2 ≠0 on I. Then, on dividing by an1x2, we can rewrite (1) 
in the standard form
(2)	
y1n21x2 + p11x2y1n-121x2 + g + pn1x2y1x2 = g1x2 ,
where the functions p11x2, . . . , pn1x2, and g1x2 are continuous on I.
For a linear higher-order differential equation, the initial value problem always has a 
unique solution.
6.1  Basic Theory of Linear Differential Equations
Existence and Uniqueness
Theorem 1.	
Suppose p11x2, . . . , pn1x2 and g1x2 are each continuous on an 
interval 1a, b2 that contains the point x0. Then, for any choice of the initial values 
g0, g1, . . . , gn-1, there exists a unique solution y1x2 on the whole interval 1a, b2 to the 
initial value problem
(3)	
y1n21x2 + p11x2y1n−121x2 + P + pn1x2y1x2 = g1x2 ,
(4)	
y1x02 = G0, y′1x02 = G1, . . . , y1n−121x02 = Gn−1 .

The proof of Theorem 1 can be found in Chapter 13.†
Example 1
For the initial value problem
(5)	
x1x - 12y‴ - 3xy″ + 6x2y′ - 1cos x2y = 2x + 5 ;
(6)	
y1x02 = 1 ,  y′1x02 = 0 ,  y″1x02 = 7 ,
determine the values of x0 and the intervals 1a, b2 containing x0 for which Theorem 1 guaran-
tees the existence of a unique solution on 1a, b2.
Solution
Putting equation (5) in standard form, we find that p11x2 = -3>1x - 1), p21x2 = 6x>1x - 1), 
p31x2 = -1cos x2>3x1x - 124, and g1x2 = 2x + 5>3x1x - 124. Now p11x2 and p21x2 
are continuous on every interval not containing x = 1, while p31x2 is continuous on every 
interval not containing x = 0 or x = 1. The function g1x2 is not defined for x 6 -5, x = 0, 
and x = 1, but is continuous on 1 -5, 02, 10, 12, and 11, ∞2. Hence, the functions p1, p2, 
p3, and g are simultaneously continuous on the intervals 1 -5, 02, 10, 12, and 11, ∞2. From 
Theorem 1 it follows that if we choose x0 ∈1 -5, 02, then there exists a unique solution to the 
initial value problem (5)–(6) on the whole interval 1 -5, 02. Similarly, for x0 ∈10, 12, there is 
a unique solution on 10, 12 and, for x0 ∈11, ∞2, a unique solution on 11, ∞2.  ◆
If we let the left-hand side of equation (3) define the differential operator L,
(7)	
L3y4 J dny
dxn + p1 dn−1y
dxn−1 + P + pny = 1Dn + p1Dn−1 + P + pn23y4 ,
then we can express equation (3) in the operator form
(8)	
L3y41x2 = g1x2 .
It is essential to keep in mind that L is a linear operator—that is, it satisfies
(9)	
 L3y1 + y2 + g + ym4 = L3y14 + L3y24 + g + L3ym4 ,
(10)	
 L3cy4 = cL3y4    (c any constant) .
These are familiar properties for the differentiation operator D, from which (9) and (10) follow 
(see Problem 25).
As a consequence of this linearity, if y1, . . . , ym are solutions to the homogeneous equation
(11)	
L3y41x2 = 0 ,
then any linear combination of these functions, C1y1 + g + Cmym, is also a solution, because
L3C1y1 + C2y2 + g + Cmym4 = C1 # 0 + C2 # 0 + g + Cm # 0 = 0 .
Imagine now that we have found n solutions y1, . . . , yn to the nth-order linear equation (11). Is 
it true that every solution to (11) can be represented by
(12)	
C1y1 + C2y2 + g + Cnyn

for appropriate choices of the constants C1, . . . , Cn? The answer is yes, provided the solutions 
y1, . . . , yn satisfy a certain property that we now derive.
Let f1x2 be a solution to (11) on the interval 1a, b2 and let x0 be a fixed number in 1a, b2. 
If it is possible to choose the constants C1, . . . , Cn so that

then, since f1x2 and C1y11x2 + g + Cnyn1x2 are two solutions satisfying the same initial 
conditions at x0, the uniqueness conclusion of Theorem 1 gives
(14)	
f1x2 = C1y11x2 + g + Cnyn1x2
for all x in 1a, b2.
The system (13) consists of n linear equations in the n unknowns C1, . . . , Cn. It has a 
unique solution for all possible values of f1x02, f′1x02, . . . , f1n-121x02 if and only if the 
determinant† of the coefficients is different from zero; that is, if and only if

Hence, if y1, . . . , yn are solutions to equation (11) and there is some point x0 in 1a, b2 such 
that (15) holds, then every solution f1x2 to (11) is a linear combination of y1, . . . , yn. Before 
formulating this fact as a theorem, it is convenient to identify the determinant by name.

We now state the representation theorem that we proved above for solutions to homoge-

book (such as Fundamentals of Matrix Analysis with Applications, by Edward Barry Saff and Arthur David Snider,

The linear combination of y1, . . . , yn in (19), written with arbitrary constants C1, . . . , Cn, 
is referred to as a general solution to (17).
In linear algebra a set of m column vectors 5v1, v2, c,vm6, each having m components, 
is said to be linearly dependent if and only if at least one of them can be expressed as a linear 
combination of the others.† A basic theorem then states that if a determinant is zero, its column 
vectors are linearly dependent, and conversely. So if a Wronskian of solutions to (17) is zero at 
a point x0, one of its columns (the final column, say; we can always renumber!) equals a linear 
combination of the others:

Now consider the two functions yn1x2 and 3d1y11x2 + d2y21x2 + g + dn-1yn-11x24. 
They are both solutions to (17), and we can interpret (20) as stating that they satisfy the same 
initial conditions at x = x0. By the uniqueness theorem, then, they are one and the same 
function:
(21)	
yn1x2 = d1y11x2 + d2y21x2 + g + dn-1yn-11x2
for all x in the interval I. Consequently, their derivatives are the same also, and so

for all x in I. Hence, the final column of the Wronskian W3y1, y2, c, yn4 is always a linear 
combination of the other columns, and consequently the Wronskian is always zero.
In summary, the Wronskian of n solutions to the homogeneous equation (17) is either 
identically zero, or never zero, on the interval 1a, b2. We have also shown that, in the former

y1n21x2 + p11x2y1n-121x2 + g + pn1x2y1x2 = 0 ,

satisfy

where C1, . . . , Cn are constants.
†This is equivalent to saying there exist constants c1, c2, . . . , cm not all zero, such that c1v1 + c2v2 + g + cmvm 
equals the zero vector.

Section 6.1    Basic Theory of Linear Differential Equations          323
case, (21) holds throughout 1a, b2. Such a relationship among functions is an extension of the 
notion of linear dependence introduced in Section 4.2. We employ the same nomenclature for 
the general case.
Linear Dependence of Functions
Definition 2.	 The m functions f1, f2, c, fm are said to be linearly dependent on an 
interval I if at least one of them can be expressed as a linear combination of the others 
on I; equivalently, they are linearly dependent if there exist constants c1, c2, c, cm, not 
all zero, such that
(23)	
c1  f11x2 + c2  f21x2 + g + cm   fm(x2 = 0
for all x in I. Otherwise, they are said to be linearly independent on I.
Example 2
Show that the functions f11x2 = ex, f21x2 = e-2x, and f31x2 = 3ex - 2e-2x are linearly 
dependent on 1 - ∞, ∞2.
Solution
Obviously, f3 is a linear combination of f1 and f2 :
f31x2 = 3ex - 2e-2x = 3f11x2 - 2f21x2 .
Note further that the corresponding identity 3f11x2 - 2f21x2 - f31x2 = 0 matches the pattern 
(23). Moreover, observe that f1, f2, and f3 are pairwise linearly independent on 1- ∞, ∞2, but 
this does not suffice to make the triplet independent.  ◆
To prove that functions f1, f2, . . . , fm are linearly independent on the interval 1a, b2, a 
convenient approach is the following: Assume that equation (23) holds on 1a, b2 and show that 
this forces c1 = c2 = g = cm = 0.
Example 3
Show that the functions f11x2 = x, f21x2 = x2, and f31x2 = 1 - 2x2 are linearly independent 
on 1 - ∞, ∞2.
Solution
Assume c1, c2, and c3 are constants for which
(24)	
c1x + c2x2 + c311 - 2x22 = 0
holds at every x. If we can prove that (24) implies c1 = c2 = c3 = 0, then linear independence 
follows. Let’s set x = 0, 1, and -1 in equation (24). These x values are, essentially, “picked 
out of a hat,” but will get the job done. Substituting in (24) gives
(25)
	
 c3 = 0 1x = 02 ,
	
 c1 + c2 - c3 = 0 1x = 1) ,
	
 -c1 + c2 - c3 = 0 1x = -12 .
When we solve this system (or compute the determinant of the coefficients), we find that the 
only possible solution is c1 = c2 = c3 = 0. Consequently, the functions f1, f2, and f3 are lin-
early independent on 1 - ∞, ∞2.

324          Chapter 6    Theory of Higher-Order Linear Differential Equations
A neater solution is to note that if (24) holds for all x, so do its first and second derivatives. 
At x = 0 these conditions are c3 = 0, c1 = 0, and 2c2 - 4c3 = 0. Obviously, each coefficient 
must be zero.  ◆
Linear dependence of functions is, prima facie, different from linear dependence of vec-
tors in the Euclidean space Rn, because (23) is a functional equation that imposes a condition at 
every point of an interval. However, we have seen in (21) that when the functions are all solu-
tions to the same homogeneous differential equation, linear dependence of the column vectors 
of the Wronskian (at any point x0) implies linear dependence of the functions. The converse is 
also true, as demonstrated by (21) and (22). Theorem 3 summarizes our deliberations.
Linear Dependence and the Wronskian

interval 1a, b2, with p1, p2, c, pn continuous on 1a, b2, then the following statements 
are equivalent:
	 (i)	 y1, y2, c, yn are linearly dependent on 1a, b2.
	(ii)	 The Wronskian W3y1, y2, c, yn41x02 is zero at some point x0 in 1a, b2.
	(iii)	 The Wronskian W3y1, y2, c, yn41x2 is identically zero on 1a, b2.
The contrapositives of these statements are also equivalent:
	(iv)	 y1, y2, c, yn are linearly independent on 1a, b2.
	(v)	 The Wronskian W3y1, y2, c, yn41x02 is nonzero at some point x0 in 1a, b2.
	(vi)	 The Wronskian W3y1, y2, c, yn41x2 is never zero on 1a, b2.
Whenever (iv), (v), or (vi) is met, 5y1, y2, c, yn6 is called a fundamental solution set 
for (17) on 1a, b2.
The Wronskian is a curious function. If we take W3f1, f2, c, fn41x2 for n arbitrary func-
tions, we simply get a function of x with no particularly interesting properties. But if the n functions 
are all solutions to the same homogeneous differential equation, then either it is identically zero or 
never zero. In fact, one can prove Abel’s identity when the functions are all solutions to (17):

which clearly exhibits this property. Problem 30 on page 327 outlines a proof of (26) for n = 3.†
It is useful to keep in mind that the following sets consist of functions that are linearly 
independent on every open interval 1a, b2:
51, x, x2, . . . , xn6
51, cos x, sin x, cos 2x, sin 2x, . . . , cos nx, sin nx 6 ,
5eA1x, eA2x, . . . , eAnx6 1Ai’s distinct constants2 .
[See Problems 27 and 28 on page 326, and Section 6.2 (page 327).]
If we combine the linearity (superposition) properties (9) and (10) with the representation 
theorem for solutions of the homogeneous equation, we obtain the following representation 
theorem for nonhomogeneous equations.
†See Problem 32, Exercises 4.7, for the case n = 2.

Section 6.1    Basic Theory of Linear Differential Equations          325
Proof.  Let f1x2 be any solution to (27). Because both f1x2 and yp1x2 are solutions to 
(27), by linearity the difference f1x2 - yp1x2 is a solution to the homogeneous equation (28). 
It then follows from Theorem 2 that
f1x2 - yp1x2 = C1y11x2 + g + Cnyn1x2
for suitable constants C1, . . . , Cn. The last equation is equivalent to (29) 3with f1x2 in place 
of y1x24, so the theorem is proved.  ◆
The linear combination of yp, y1, . . .  , yn in (29) written with arbitrary constants  
C1, . . . , Cn is, for obvious reasons, referred to as a general solution to (27). Theorem 4 can 
be easily generalized. For example, if L denotes the operator appearing as the left-hand side in 
equation (27) and if L3yp14 = g1 and L3yp24 = g2, then any solution of L3y4 = c1g1 + c2g2 
can be expressed as
y1x2 = c1yp11x2 + c2yp21x2 + C1y11x2 + C2y21x2 + g + Cnyn1x2 ,
for a suitable choice of the constants C1, C2, . . . , Cn.
Representation of Solutions (Nonhomogeneous Case)
Theorem 4.	
Let yp1x2 be a particular solution to the nonhomogeneous equation
(27)	
y1n21x2 + p11x2y1n-121x2 + g + pn1x2y1x2 = g1x2
on the interval 1a, b2 with p1, p2, . . . , pn continuous on 1a, b2, and let {y1, . . . , yn} be a 
fundamental solution set for the corresponding homogeneous equation
(28)	
y1n21x2 + p11x2y1n-121x2 + g + pn1x2y1x2 = 0 .
Then every solution of (27) on the interval 1a, b2 can be expressed in the form
(29)	
y1x2 = yp1x2 + C1 y11x2 + P + Cn yn1x2 .
Example 4
Find a general solution on the interval 1 - ∞, ∞2 to
(30)	
L3y4 J y‴ - 2y″ - y′ + 2y = 2x2 - 2x - 4 - 24e-2x ,
given that yp11x2 = x2 is a particular solution to L3y4 = 2x2 - 2x - 4, that yp21x2 = e-2x is 
a particular solution to L3y4 = -12e-2x, and that y11x2 = e-x, y21x2 = ex, and y31x2 = e2x 
are solutions to the corresponding homogeneous equation.
Solution
We previously remarked that the functions e-x, ex, e2x are linearly independent because the 
exponents -1, 1, and 2 are distinct. Since each of these functions is a solution to the cor-
responding homogeneous equation, then {e-x, ex, e2x} is a fundamental solution set. It now 
follows from the remarks above for nonhomogeneous equations that a general solution to 
(30) is
(31)	
 y1x2 = yp1 + 2yp2 + C1y1 + C2y2 + C3y3
	
 = x2 + 2e-2x + C1e-x + C2ex + C3e2x .  ◆

tion with constant coefficients. Based on the experience gained with second-order equations in 
Section 4.2, you should have little trouble guessing the form of such a solution. However, our 
interest here is to help you understand why these techniques work. This is done using an opera-
tor approach—a technique that is useful in tackling many other problems in analysis such as 
solving partial differential equations.
6.2  Homogeneous Linear Equations with  
Constant Coefficients

328          Chapter 6    Theory of Higher-Order Linear Differential Equations
Let’s consider the homogeneous linear nth-order differential equation
(1)	
any1n21x2 + an-1y1n-121x2 + g + a1y′1x2 + a0y1x2 = 0 ,
where an1 ≠02, an-1, . . . , a0 are real constants.† Since constant functions are everywhere 
continuous, equation (1) has solutions defined for all x in 1 - ∞, ∞2 (recall Theorem 1 in 
Section 6.1). If we can find n linearly independent solutions to (1) on 1 - ∞, ∞2, say, 
y1, . . . , yn, then we can express a general solution to (1) in the form
(2)	
y1x2 = C1y11x2 + g + Cnyn1x2 ,
with C1, . . . , Cn as arbitrary constants.
To find these n linearly independent solutions, we capitalize on our previous success with 
second-order equations. Namely, experience suggests that we begin by trying a function of the 
form y = erx.
If we let L be the differential operator defined by the left-hand side of (1), that is,
(3)	
L3y4 J  an y1n2 + an−1 y1n−12 + P + a1 y′ + a0 y ,
then we can write (1) in the operator form
(4)	
L3y41x2 = 0 .
For y = erx, we find
(5)	
 L3erx41x2 = anrnerx + an-1rn-1erx + g + a0erx
	
 = erx1anrn + an-1rn-1 + g + a02 = erxP1r2 ,
where P1r2 is the polynomial anrn + an-1rn-1 + g + a0. Thus, erx is a solution to equation 
(4), provided r is a root of the auxiliary (or characteristic) equation
(6)	
P1r2 = anrn + an−1rn−1 + P + a0 = 0 .
According to the fundamental theorem of algebra, the auxiliary equation has n roots 
(counting multiplicities), which may be either real or complex. However, there are no formulas 
for determining the zeros of an arbitrary polynomial of degree greater than four, although if 
we can determine one zero r1, then we can divide out the factor r - r1 and be left with a poly-
nomial of lower degree. (For convenience, we have chosen most of our examples and exercises 
so that 0, {1, or {2 are zeros of any polynomial of degree greater than two that we must 
factor.) When a zero cannot be exactly determined, numerical algorithms such as Newton’s 
method or the quotient-difference algorithm can be used to compute approximate roots of the 
polynomial equation.‡ Some pocket calculators even have these algorithms built in.
We proceed to discuss the various possibilities.
Distinct Real Roots
If the roots r1, . . . , rn of the auxiliary equation (6) are real and distinct, then n solutions to 
equation (1) are
(7)	
y11x2 = er1x,  y21x2 = er2x,  . . . ,  yn1x2 = ernx  .
†Historical Footnote: In a letter to John Bernoulli dated September 15, 1739, Leonhard Euler claimed to have solved 
the general case of the homogeneous linear nth-order equation with constant coefficients.
‡See, for example, Applied and Computational Complex Analysis, by P. Henrici (Wiley-Interscience, New York, 1993), 
Volume 1, or Numerical Analysis, 9th ed., by R. L. Burden and J. D. Faires (Brooks/Cole Cengage Learning, 2011).

Section 6.2    Homogeneous Linear Equations with Constant Coefficients           329
As stated in the previous section, these functions are linearly independent on 1- ∞, ∞2, a fact 
that we now officially verify. Let’s assume that c1, . . . , cn are constants such that
(8)	
c1er1x + g + cnernx = 0
for all x in 1 - ∞, ∞2. Our goal is to prove that c1 = c2 = g = cn = 0.
One way to show this is to construct a linear operator Lk that annihilates (maps to zero) 
everything on the left-hand side of (8) except the kth term. For this purpose, we note that since 
r1, . . . , rn are the zeros of the auxiliary polynomial P1r2, then P1r2 can be factored as
(9)	
P1r2 = an1r - r12 g1r - rn2 .
Consequently, the operator L3y4 = any1n2 + an-1y1n-12 + g + a0y can be expressed in terms 
of the differentiation operator D as the following composition:†
(10)	
L = P1D2 = an1D - r12 g1D - rn2 .
We now construct the polynomial Pk1r2 by deleting the factor 1r - rk2 from P1r2. Then we set 
Lk J Pk1D2; that is,
(11)	
Lk J Pk1D2 = an1D - r1) g1D - rk-121D - rk+12 g1D - rn2 .
Applying Lk to both sides of (8), we get, via linearity,
(12)	
c1Lk3er1x4 + g + cnLk3ernx4 = 0 .
Also, since Lk = Pk1D2, we find [just as in equation (5)] that Lk3erx41x2 = erxPk1r2 for all r. 
Thus (12) can be written as
c1er1xPk1r12 + g + cnernxPk1rn2 = 0 ,
which simplifies to
(13)	
ckerkxPk1rk2 = 0 ,
because Pk1ri2 = 0 for i ≠k. Since rk is not a root of Pk1r2, then Pk1rk2 ≠0. It now fol-
lows from (13) that ck = 0. But as k is arbitrary, all the constants c1, . . . , cn must be zero. Thus, 
y11x2, . . . , yn1x2 as given in (7) are linearly independent. (See Problem 26 for an alternative proof.)
We have proved that, in the case of n distinct real roots, a general solution to (1) is
(14)	
y1x2 = C1er1x + P + Cnernx ,
where C1, . . . , Cn are arbitrary constants.
Example 1
Find a general solution to
(15)	
y‴ - 2y″ - 5y′ + 6y = 0 .
†Historical Footnote: The symbolic notation P1D2 was introduced by Augustin Cauchy in 1827.
Solution
The auxiliary equation is
(16)	
r3 - 2r2 - 5r + 6 = 0 .
By inspection we find that r = 1 is a root. Then, using polynomial division, we get
r3 - 2r2 - 5r + 6 = 1r - 121r2 - r - 62 ,
which further factors into 1r - 121r + 221r - 32. Hence the roots of equation (16) are r1 = 1, 
r2 = -2, r3 = 3. Since these roots are real and distinct, a general solution to (15) is
y1x2 = C1ex + C2e-2x + C3e3x .  ◆

330          Chapter 6    Theory of Higher-Order Linear Differential Equations
Complex Roots
If a + ib 1a, b real2 is a complex root of the auxiliary equation (6), then so is its complex 
conjugate a - ib, since the coefficients of P1r2 are real-valued (see Problem 24). If we accept 
complex-valued functions as solutions, then both e1a+ib2x and e1a-ib2x are solutions to (1). 
Moreover, if there are no repeated roots, then a general solution to (1) is again given by (14). 
To find two real-valued solutions corresponding to the roots a { ib, we can just take the real 
and imaginary parts of e1a+ib2x. That is, since
(17)	
e1a+ib2x = eax cos bx + ieax sin bx ,
then two linearly independent solutions to (1) are
(18)	
eax cos bx ,  eax sin bx .
In fact, using these solutions in place of e1a+ib2x and e1a-ib2x in (14) preserves the linear inde-
pendence of the set of n solutions. Thus, treating each of the conjugate pairs of roots in this 
manner, we obtain a real-valued general solution to (1).
Example 2
Find a general solution to
(19)	
y‴ + y″ + 3y′ - 5y = 0 .
Solution
The auxiliary equation is
(20)	
r3 + r2 + 3r - 5 = 1r - 121r2 + 2r + 5) = 0 ,
which has distinct roots r1 = 1, r2 = -1 + 2i, r3 = -1 - 2i. Thus, a general solution is
(21)	
y1x2 = C1ex + C2e-x cos 2x + C3e-x sin 2x .  ◆
Repeated Roots
If r1 is a root of multiplicity m, then the n solutions given in (7) are not even distinct, let alone 
linearly independent. Recall that for a second-order equation, when we had a repeated root r1 to 
the auxiliary equation, we obtained two linearly independent solutions by taking er1x and xer1x. So 
if r1 is a root of (6) of multiplicity m, we might expect that m linearly independent solutions are
(22)	
er1x , xer1x , x2er1x , . . . , xm−1er1x .
To see that this is the case, observe that if r1 is a root of multiplicity m, then the auxiliary 
equation can be written in the form
(23)	
an1r - r12m1r - rm+12 g1r - rn2 = 1r - r12m P∼1r2 = 0 ,
where P∼1r2 J an1r - rm+12 g1r - rn2 and P∼1r12 ≠0. With this notation, we have the 
identity
(24)	
L3erx41x2 = erx1r - r12m P∼1r2
[see (5) on page 328]. Setting r = r1 in (24), we again see that er1x is a solution to L3y4 = 0.
To find other solutions, we take the kth partial derivative with respect to r of both sides 
of (24):
(25)	
0k
0rk L3erx41x2 = 0k
0rk 3erx1r - r12m P∼1r24 .
Carrying out the differentiation on the right-hand side of (25), we find that the resulting expres-
sion will still have 1r - r12 as a factor, provided k … m - 1. Thus, setting r = r1 in (25) gives

(26)	
0k
0rk L3erx41x2 `
   
r = r1
= 0 if k … m - 1 .
Now notice that the function erx has continuous partial derivatives of all orders with respect 
to r and x. Hence, for mixed partial derivatives of erx, it makes no difference whether the differen-
tiation is done first with respect to x, then with respect to r, or vice versa. Since L involves deriva-
tives with respect to x, this means we can interchange the order of differentiation in (26) to obtain
Lc 0k
0rk 1erx2 2  
r = r1
d 1x2 = 0 .
Thus,
(27)	
0k
0rk 1erx2 2  
r = r1
= xker1x
will be a solution to (1) for k = 0, 1, . . . , m - 1. So m distinct solutions to (1), due to the root 
r = r1 of multiplicity m, are indeed given by (22). We leave it as an exercise to show that the m 
functions in (22) are linearly independent on 1 - ∞, ∞) (see Problem 25).
If a + ib is a repeated complex root of multiplicity m, then we can replace the 2m 
complex-valued functions
e1a+ib2x , xe1a+ib2x , . . . , xm-1e1a+ib2x ,
e1a-ib2x , xe1a-ib2x , . . . , xm-1e1a-ib2x
by the 2m linearly independent real-valued functions
(28)
	
eAx cos Bx , xeAx cos Bx , . . . , xm−1eAx cos Bx ,
	
eAx sin Bx , xeAx sin Bx , . . . , xm−1eAx sin Bx .
Using the results of the three cases discussed above, we can obtain a set of n linearly 
independent solutions that yield a real-valued general solution for (1).
Example 3
Find a general solution to
(29)

Solution
The auxiliary equation is

which has roots r1 = 1, r2 = 1, r3 = 1, r4 = -2. Because the root at 1 has multiplicity 3, a 
general solution is

whose auxiliary equation can be factored as
(32)	
r4 - 8r3 + 26r2 - 40r + 25 = 1r2 - 4r + 522 = 0 .
Solution
The auxiliary equation (32) has repeated complex roots: r1 = 2 + i, r2 = 2 + i, r3 = 2 - i, 
and r4 = 2 - i. Hence, a general solution is
y1x2 = C1e2x cos x + C2xe2x cos x + C3e2x sin x + C4xe2x sin x .  ◆

first object by a spring with spring constant k2 N/m. The 
objects are aligned horizontally so that the springs are 
their natural lengths. As we showed in Section 5.6, this 
coupled mass–spring system is governed by the system 
of differential equations

Annihilator
Definition 3.	 A linear differential operator A is said to annihilate a function f if
(2)	
A3f41x2 = 0 ,    
for all x. That is, A annihilates f if f is a solution to the homogeneous linear differential 
equation (2) on 1 - ∞, ∞2.
In Sections 4.4 and 4.5 we mastered an easy method for obtaining a particular solution to a 
nonhomogeneous linear second-order constant-coefficient equation,
(1) 	
L3y4 = 1aD2 + bD + c23y4 = ƒ1x2 ,
when the nonhomogeneity ƒ1x2 had a particular form (namely, a product of a polynomial, 
an exponential, and a sinusoid). Roughly speaking, we were motivated by the observation 
that if a function ƒ, of this type, resulted from operating on y with an operator L of the form 
1aD2 + bD + c2, then we must have started with a y of the same type. So we solved (1) by 
postulating a solution form yp that resembled ƒ, but with undetermined coefficients, and we 
inserted this form into the equation to fix the values of these coefficients. Eventually, we real-
ized that we had to make certain accommodations when ƒ was a solution to the homogeneous 
equation L3y4 = 0.
In this section we are going to reexamine the method of undetermined coefficients from 
another, more rigorous, point of view—partly with the objective of tying up the loose ends in 
our previous exposition and more importantly with the goal of extending the method to higher-
order equations (with constant coefficients). At the outset we’ll describe the new point of view 
that will be adopted for the analysis. Then we illustrate its implications and ultimately derive 
a simplified set of rules for its implementation: rules that justify and extend the procedures of 
Section 4.4. The rigorous approach is known as the annihilator method.
The first premise of the annihilator method is the observation, gleaned from the analysis 
of the previous section, that all of the “suitable types” of nonhomogeneities ƒ1x2 (products of 
polynomials times exponentials times sinusoids) are themselves solutions to homogeneous 
differential equations with constant coefficients. Observe the following:
	
(i)	 Any nonhomogeneous term of the form ƒ1x2 = erx satisfies 1D - r23f4 = 0.
	
(ii)	 Any nonhomogeneous term of the form ƒ1x2 = xkerx satisfies 1D - r2m3f4 = 0 for 
k = 0, 1, c, m - 1 .
	
(iii)	 Any nonhomogeneous term of the form ƒ1x2 = cos bx or sin bx satisfies 
1D2 + b223f4 = 0.
	
(iv)	 Any nonhomogeneous term of the form ƒ1x2 = xkeax cos bx or xkeax sin bx satisfies 
31D - a22 + b24m3f4 = 0 for k = 0, 1, c, m - 1 .
In other words, each of these nonhomogeneities is annihilated by a differential operator with 
constant coefficients.
6.3  Undetermined Coefficients and the  
Annihilator Method

Section 6.3    Undetermined Coefficients and the Annihilator Method           335
Example 1
Find a differential operator that annihilates
(3)	
6xe-4x + 5ex sin 2x .
Solution
Consider the two functions whose sum appears in (3). Observe that 1D + 422 annihilates 
the function f11x2 J 6xe-4x. Further, f21x2 J 5ex sin 2x is annihilated by the operator 
1D - 122 + 4. Hence, the composite operator
A J 1D + 42231D - 122 + 44 ,
which is the same as the operator
31D - 122 + 441D + 422 ,
annihilates both f1 and f2. But then, by linearity, A also annihilates the sum f1 + f2.  ◆
We now show how annihilators can be used to determine particular solutions to certain non-
homogeneous equations. Consider the nth-order differential equation with constant coefficients
(4)	
any1n21x2 + an-1y1n-121x2 + g + a0y1x2 = ƒ1x2 ,
which can be written in the operator form
(5)	
L3y41x2 = ƒ1x2 ,
where
L = anDn + an-1Dn-1 + g + a0 .
Assume that A is a linear differential operator with constant coefficients that annihilates ƒ1x2. 
Then
A3L3y44 1x2 = A3f41x2 = 0 ,
so any solution to (5) is also a solution to the homogeneous equation
(6)	
AL3y41x2 = 0 ,
involving the composition of the operators A and L. But we are experts on homogeneous 
differential equations (with constant coefficients)! In particular, we can use the methods of  
Section 6.2 to write down a general solution of (6). From this we can deduce the form of a  
particular solution to (5). Let’s look at some examples and then summarize our findings. The 
differential equation in the next example is second order, so we will be able to see exactly how 
the annihilator method is related to the techniques of Sections 4.4 and 4.5.
Example 2
Find a general solution to
(7)	
y″ - y = xex + sin x .
Solution
First let’s solve this by the methods of Sections 4.4 and 4.5, to get a perspective for the annihi-
lator method. The homogeneous equation corresponding to (7) is y″ - y = 0, with the general 
solution C1e-x + C2ex. Since ex is a solution of the homogeneous equation, the nonhomogene-
ity xex demands a solution form x1C3 + C4x2ex. To accommodate the nonhomogeneity sin  x, 
we need an undetermined coefficient form C5 sin x + C6 cos x. Values for C3 through C6 in the 
particular solution are determined by substitution:
y>
p - yp = 3C3xex + C4x2ex + C5 sin x + C6 cos x4″
-3C3xex + C4x2ex + C5 sin x + C6 cos x4 = sin x + xex ,

336          Chapter 6    Theory of Higher-Order Linear Differential Equations
eventually leading to the conclusion C3 = -1>4, C4 = 1>4, C5 = -1>2, and C6 = 0. Thus 
(for future reference), a general solution to (7) is
(8)	
y1x2 = C1e-x + C2ex + xa - 1
4 + 1
4xbex - 1
2 sin x .
For the annihilator method, observe that 1D2 + 12 annihilates sin x and 1D - 122 anni-
hilates xex. Therefore, any solution to (7), expressed for convenience in operator form as 
1D2 - 123y41x2 = xex + sin x, is annihilated by the composition 1D2 + 121D - 1221D2 - 12; 
that is, it satisfies the constant-coefficient homogeneous equation
(9)	
1D2 + 121D - 1221D2 - 123y4 = 1D + 121D - 1231D2 + 123y4 = 0 .
From Section 6.2 we deduce that the general solution to (9) is given by
(10)	
y = C1e-x + C2ex + C3xex + C4x2ex + C5 sin x + C6 cos x .
This is precisely the solution form generated by the methods of Chapter 4; the first two terms 
are the general solution to the associated homogeneous equation, and the remaining four terms 
express the particular solution to the nonhomogeneous equation with undetermined coeffi-
cients. Substitution of (10) into (7) will lead to the quoted values for C3 through C6, and 
indeterminant values for C1 and C2; the latter are available to fit initial conditions.
Note how the annihilator method automatically accounts for the fact that the nonhomo-
geneity xex requires the form C3xex + C4x2ex in the particular solution, by counting the total 
number of factors of 1D - 12 in the annihilator and the original differential operator.  ◆
Example 3
Find a general solution, using the annihilator method, to
(11)	
y‴ - 3y″ + 4y = xe2x .
Solution
The associated homogeneous equation takes the operator form
(12)	
1D3 - 3D2 + 423y4 = 1D + 121D - 2223y4 = 0 .
The nonhomogeneity xe2x is annihilated by 1D - 222. Therefore, every solution of (11) also 
satisfies
(13)	
1D - 2221D3 - 3D2 + 423y4 = 1D + 121D - 2243y4 = 0 .
A general solution to (13) is
(14)	
y1x2 = C1e-x + C2e2x + C3xe2x + C4x2e2x + C5x3e2x .
Comparison with (12) shows that the first three terms of (14) give a general solution to the 
associated homogeneous equation and the last two terms constitute a particular solution form 
with undetermined coefficients. Direct substitution reveals C4 = -1>18 and C5 = 1>18 and 
so a general solution to (11) is
y1x2 = C1e-x + C2e2x + C3xe2x - 1
18x2e2x + 1
18x3e2x .  ◆
The annihilator method, then, rigorously justifies the method of undetermined coeffi-
cients of Section 4.4. It also tells us how to upgrade that procedure for higher-order equa-
tions with constant coefficients. Note that we don’t have to implement the annihilator method 
directly; we simply need to introduce the following modifications to the method of 
undetermined coefficients for second-order equations that was described in the procedural 
box on page 178.

In the previous section, we discussed the method of undetermined coefficients and the annihila-
tor method. These methods work only for linear equations with constant coefficients and when 
the nonhomogeneous term is a solution to some homogeneous linear equation with constant 
coefficients. In this section we show how the method of variation of parameters discussed 
in Sections 4.6 and 4.7 generalizes to higher-order linear equations with variable coefficients.
Our goal is to find a particular solution to the standard form equation
(1)	
L3y41x2 = g1x2 ,
where L3y4 J y1n2 + p1y1n-12 + g + pny and the coefficient functions p1, . . . , pn, as well 
as g, are continuous on 1a, b2. The method to be described requires that we already know a 
fundamental solution set 5y1, . . ., yn6 for the corresponding homogeneous equation
(2)	
L3y41x2 = 0 .
A general solution to (2) is then
(3)	
yh1x2 = C1y11x2 + g + Cnyn1x2 ,
where C1, . . . , Cn are arbitrary constants. In the method of variation of parameters, we assume 
there exists a particular solution to (1) of the form
(4)	
yp1x2 = Y11x2y11x2 + P + Yn1x2yn1x2
and try to determine the functions y1, . . . , yn.
There are n unknown functions, so we will need n conditions (equations) to determine 
them. These conditions are obtained as follows. Differentiating yp in (4) gives
(5)	
y=
p = 1y1y=
1 + g + yny=
n2 + 1y=
1y1 + g + y=
nyn2 .
6.4  Method Of Variation of Parameters

Section 6.4    Method Of Variation of Parameters          339
To prevent second derivatives of the unknowns y1, . . . , yn from entering the formula for y>
p, we 
impose the condition
y=
1y1 + g + y=
nyn = 0 .
In a like manner, as we compute y>
p, y?
p , . . ., y1n-12

involving y=

ny=
n = 0,  . . . ,  y=
1y1n-22

+ g + y=
ny1n-22
n
= 0 .
Finally, the nth condition that we impose is that yp satisfy the given equation (1). Using the pre-
vious conditions and the fact that y1, . . . , yn are solutions to the homogeneous equation, then 
L3yp4 = g reduces to
(6)	
y=
1y1n-12

+ g + y=
ny1n-12
n
= g
(see Problem 12, page 341). We therefore seek n functions y=
1, . . . , y=
n that satisfy the system

Caution. This system was derived under the assumption that the coefficient of the highest 
derivative y(n) in (1) is one. If, instead, the coefficient of this term is the constant a, then in the 
last equation in (7) the right-hand side becomes g>a.
A sufficient condition for the existence of a solution to system (7) for x in 1a, b2 is that the 
determinant of the matrix made up of the coefficients of y=
1, . . . , y=
n be different from zero for 
all x in 1a, b2. But this determinant is just the Wronskian:

(9)	
y=

W3y1, . . . , yn41x2 ,  k = 1, . . ., n ,
where Wk1x2 is the determinant of the matrix obtained from the Wronskian W3y1, . . . yn41x2 
by replacing the kth column by col30, . . . , 0, 14. Using a cofactor expansion about this col-
umn, we can express Wk1x2 in terms of an 1n - 12th-order Wronskian:
(10)	
Wk1x2 = 1 -12n-kW3y1, . . . , yk-1, yk+1, . . . , yn41x2 ,  k = 1, . . . , n .
Integrating y=
k1x2 in (9) gives
(11)	
yk1x2 =
L
g1x2Wk1x2
W3y1, . . . , yn41x2

Finally, substituting the yk’s back into (4), we obtain a particular solution to equation (1):
(12)	
yp1x2 = a

k=1

Note that in equation (1) we presumed that the coefficient of the leading term, y1n2, was unity. 
If, instead, it is p01x2, we must replace g1x2 by g1x2>p01x2 in (12).

Although equation (12) gives a neat formula for a particular solution to (1), its imple-
mentation requires one to evaluate n + 1 determinants and then perform n integrations. This 
may entail several tedious computations. However, the method does work in cases when the 
technique of undetermined coefficients does not apply (provided, of course, we know a funda-
mental solution set).
Example 1
Find a general solution to the Cauchy–Euler equation
(13)	
x3y‴ + x2y″ - 2xy′ + 2y = x3 sin x ,  x 7 0 ,
given that 5x, x-1, x26 is a fundamental solution set to the corresponding homogeneous equation.
Solution
An important first step is to divide (13) by x3 to obtain the standard form
(14)	
y‴ + 1
x
 y″ - 2
x2 y′ + 2
x3 y = sin x ,  x 7 0 ,
from which we see that g1x2 = sin x. Since 5x, x-1, x26 is a fundamental solution set, we can 
obtain a particular solution of the form
(15)	
yp1x2 = y11x2x + y21x2x-1 + y31x2x2 .
To use formula (12), we must first evaluate the four determinants:
 W3x, x-1, x241x2 = †

which after some labor simplifies to
(16)	
yp1x2 = cos x - x-1sin x + C1x + C2x-1 + C3x2 ,
where C1, C2, and C3 denote the constants of integration. Since 5x, x-1, x26 is a fundamental 
solution set for the homogeneous equation, we can take C1, C2, and C3 to be arbitrary con-
stants. The right-hand side of (16) then gives the desired general solution.  ◆
In the preceding example, the fundamental solution set 5x, x-1, x26 can be derived by 
substituting y = xr into the homogeneous equation corresponding to (13) (see Problem 31, 
Exercises 6.2). However, in dealing with other equations that have variable coefficients, the 
determination of a fundamental set may be extremely difficult. In Chapter 8 we tackle this 
problem using power series methods.

Chapter 6 Summary
The theory and techniques for solving an nth-order linear differential equation
(1)	
y1n2 + p11x2y1n−12 + P + pn1x2y = g1x2
are natural extensions of the development for linear second-order equations given  
in Chapter 4. Assuming that p1, . . . , pn and g are continuous functions on an open interval I,  
there is a unique solution to (1) on I that satisfies the n initial conditions: y1x02 = g0, 
y′1x02 = g1, . . . , y1n-121x02 = gn-1, where x0 ∈I.
For the corresponding homogeneous equation
(2)	
y1n2 + p11x2y1n−12 + P + pn1x2y = 0 ,
there exists a set of n linearly independent solutions 5y1, . . . , yn6 on I. Such functions are 
said to form a fundamental solution set, and every solution to (2) can be written as a linear 
combination of these functions:
y1x2 = C1y11x2 + C2y21x2 + P + Cnyn1x2 .
The linear independence of solutions to (2) is equivalent to the nonvanishing on I of the 
Wronskian

When equation (2) has (real) constant coefficients so that it is of the form
(3)	
any1n2 + an-1y1n-12 + g + a0y = 0 ,  an ≠0 ,
then the problem of determining a fundamental solution set can be reduced to the algebraic 
problem of solving the auxiliary or characteristic equation
(4)	
anrn + an-1rn-1 + g + a0 = 0 .
If the n roots of (4)—say, r1, r2, . . . , rn—are all distinct, then
(5)	
5er1x, er2x, . . . , ernx6
is a fundamental solution set for (3). If some real root—say, r1—occurs with multiplicity m 
(e.g., r1 = r2 = g = rm), then m of the functions in (5) are replaced by
er1x, xer1x, . . . , xm-1er1x .
When a complex root a + ib to (4) occurs with multiplicity m, then so does its conjugate and 
2m members of the set (5) are replaced by the real-valued functions
eax sin bx, xeax sin bx, . . . , xm-1eax sin bx ,
eax cos bx, xeax cos bx, . . . , xm-1eax cos bx .
A general solution to the nonhomogeneous equation (1) can be written as
y1x2 = yp1x2 + yh1x2 ,

Review Problems for Chapter 6          343
where yp is some particular solution to (1) and yh is a general solution to the corresponding 
homogeneous equation. Two useful techniques for finding particular solutions are the annihilator 
method (undetermined coefficients) and the method of variation of parameters.
The annihilator method applies to equations of the form
(6)	
L3y4 = g1x2 ,
where L is a linear differential operator with constant coefficients and the forcing term g1x2 is 
a polynomial, exponential, sine, or cosine, or a linear combination of products of these. Such 
a function g1x2 is annihilated (mapped to zero) by a linear differential operator A that also has 
constant coefficients. Every solution to the nonhomogeneous equation (6) is then a solution 
to the homogeneous equation AL3y4 = 0, and, by comparing the solutions of the latter equa-
tion with a general solution to L3y4 = 0, we can obtain the form of a particular solution to 
(6). These forms have previously been studied in Section 4.4 for the method of undetermined 
coefficients.
The method of variation of parameters is more general in that it applies to arbitrary equa-
tions of the form (1). The idea is, starting with a fundamental solution set 5y1, . . . , yn6 for (2), 
to determine functions y1, . . . , yn such that
(7)	
yp1x2 = y11x2y11x2 + g + yn1x2yn1x2

ing successive integrations, each of which, at worst, involves integration by parts, which is nicely 
automated with a computer algebra system (CAS). This technique could be programmed on a 
computer and thus sheds some light on the inner workings of the CAS.
(a)	 Use mathematical induction to prove the following exponential shift property. Given a 
nonnegative integer n, an n-times differentiable function y1x2, and a real number r, then
Dn3e-rxy4 = e-rx1D - r2n3y4.
(b)	 Let n be a positive integer and r a real number. Use the exponential shift property to 
prove that the solution of the homogeneous equation
1D - r2n3y4 = 0
is given by
y1x2 = 1C0 + C1x + g + Cn-1 xn-12 erx ,
where C0, C1, . . . , Cn-1 are real constants.
We can apply the exponential shift property to nonhomogeneous equations.
(c)	 Use the exponential shift property to find the general solution to the third-order non-
homogeneous equation:
 y‴1x2 + 9y″1x2 + 27y′1x2 + 27y1x2 = 124 + 47x2ex cos x
 + 145 + 52x2ex sin x - 6xe-3x cos x
 + 1-6 + x22e-3x sin x .
[Hint: Rewrite the equation in operator form; then for the factor of the form 1D - r2n, 
multiply by e-rx, apply the exponential shift property, and perform n integrals using the 
CAS. These integrals would involve integration by parts if done by hand.]
Note that using the superposition principle together with the method of undetermined coef-
ficients, in part (c) we would have to set up and solve two linear systems, one 4 * 4 and the other 
6 * 6. For the equation in part (c), this new method is much faster.
We can use a “peeling off” method to solve equations for which the corresponding auxiliary 
equation has more than one root.
(d)	 Find a general solution to the equation
y1421x2 - 2y‴1x2 - 3y″1x2 + 4y′1x2 + 4y1x2 = 6e-x3-6 + 9x + 2e3x12 + 12x + 9x224 .
[Hint: Rewrite the equation in operator form; then for the first factor of the form 1D - r2n, 
multiply by e-rx, apply the exponential shift property, and perform n integrals using the 
CAS. Repeat the procedure for each new factor.]

The exponential shift property also holds with r replaced by a complex number a + ib. In 
this case we have to use Euler’s formula on page 166. Now, suppose the factored form of an oper-
ator has a power of 1D - a22 + b2. Then we could write 1D - a22 + b2 = 1D - z21D - z2, 
where z = a + ib.
(e)	 Find a general solution to the equation
31D - 122 + 4423y4 = sin2 x .
[Hint: So as to only involve integrating polynomials times complex exponentials, 
write sin x = 1eix - e-ix2>12i2. But make sure your answer is given as a real-valued 
function.]
The annihilator method discussed in Section 6.3 can be used to derive the rules in Sections 4.4 
and 4.5 for the method of undetermined coefficients. To show this, it suffices to work with func-
tions of the form
(1)	
g1x2 = pn1x2eax cos bx + qm1x2eax sin bx ,
where pn and qm are polynomials of degrees n and m, respectively—since the other types in 
Section 4.5 are just special cases of (1).

where s1Ú02 is the multiplicity of a { ib as roots of the auxiliary equation associated 
with L3y4 = 0, and r2s+1, . . . , rn are the remaining roots of this equation.
(c)	 Find a general solution for AL3y4 = 0 and compare it with a general solution for 
L3y4 = 0 to verify that equation (2) has a particular solution of the form

In applying elasticity theory to study the transverse vibrations of a beam, one encounters the 
equation
EIy1421x2 - gly1x2 = 0 ,
where y1x2 is related to the displacement of the beam at position x; the constant E is Young’s 
modulus; I is the area moment of inertia, which we assume is constant; g is the constant mass per 
unit length of the beam; and l is a positive parameter to be determined. We can simplify the equa-
tion by letting r4 J gl>EI; that is, we consider
(5)	
y1421x2 −r4y1x2 = 0 .
When the beam is clamped at each end, we seek a solution to (5) that satisfies the boundary conditions
(6)	
y102 = y′102 = 0  and  y1L2 = y′1L2 = 0 ,
where L is the length of the beam. The problem is to determine those nonnegative values of r for 
which equation (5) has a nontrivial solution 1y1x2 [ 02 that satisfies (6). To do this, proceed as 
follows:
(a)	 Show that there are no nontrivial solutions to the boundary value problem (5)–(6) when 
r = 0.
(b)	 Represent the general solution to (5) for r 7 0 in terms of sines, cosines, hyperbolic

linear algebraic equations for the four coefficients appearing in the general solution.

Difference equations occur in mathematical models of physical processes and as tools in numeri-
cal analysis. The theory of linear difference equations parallels the theory of linear differential 
equations. Using the results of this chapter as models, both for the statements of theorems and for 
their proofs, we can develop a theory for linear difference equations.
A Kth order linear difference equation is an equation of the form

aK1n2yn+K + aK-11n2yn+K-1 + g + a11n2yn+1 + a01n2yn = gn,  n Ú 0,
where aK1n2, . . . , a01n2, and gn are defined for all nonnegative integers n. By a solution to (8)

In 1202 the mathematician Fibonacci (Leonardo da Pisa) modeled the growth of a rabbit popu-
lation by assuming that each mating pair produces one new pair (one male, one female) every

mating at the age of one month. (And, in this Utopian setting, they are immortal.)

The number f is known as the golden ratio. If you rough-sketch a rectangle, without think-
ing about it, its sides will probably be in the proportion 1.618; it’s just an aesthetically appealing 
dimension. (The Parthenon’s dimensions conform to the golden ratio. Next time you visit Athens, 
you will understand.)
Many biological phenomena can be modeled by Fibonacci’s rule (14), and you will see the 
sequence appearing in tree branching, arrangement of leaves on a stem, pineapple and artichoke

Laplace Transforms
7.1  Introduction: A Mixing Problem
We analyzed a simpler version of this problem in Example 1 of Section 3.2. Let x1t2 be the 
amount of salt (in kilograms) in the tank at time t. Then of course x1t2>1000 is the concentration, 
in kilograms per liter. The salt content is depleted at the rate 16 L/min2 * 1x1t2>1000 kg/L2 =
3x1t2>500 kg/min through the exit valve. Simultaneously, it is enriched through valves A and B 
at the rate g1t2, given by
(1)	
g1t2 = e0.04 kg/L * 6 L/min = 0.24 kg/min ,
0 6 t 6 10 (valve A) ,
0.02 kg/L * 6 L/min = 0.12 kg/min ,
t 7 10 (valve B) .
Thus, x1t2 changes at a rate

Figure 7.1 depicts a mixing problem with valved input feeders. At time 
t = 0, valve A is opened, delivering 6 L/min of a brine solution contain-
ing 0.04 kg of salt per liter. At t = 10 min, valve A is closed and valve B 
is opened, delivering 6 L /min of brine at a concentration of 0.02 kg/L. 
Initially, 30 kg of salt are dissolved in 1000 L of water in the tank. The exit 
valve C, which empties the tank at 6 L /min, maintains the contents of the 
tank at constant volume. Assuming the solution is kept well stirred, deter-
mine the amount of salt in the tank at all times t + 0.

with initial condition
(3)	
x102 = 30 .
To solve the initial value problem (2) – (3) using the techniques of Chapter 4, we would 
have to break up the time interval 10, ∞2 into two subintervals 10, 102 and 110, ∞2. On these 
subintervals, the nonhomogeneous term g1t2 is constant, and the method of undetermined 
coefficients could be applied to equation (2) to determine general solutions for each subin-
terval, each containing one arbitrary constant (in the associated homogeneous solutions). The 
initial condition (3) would fix this constant for 0 6 t 6 10, but then we would need to evaluate 
x1102 and use it to reset the constant in the general solution for t 7 10.
Our purpose here is to illustrate a new approach using Laplace transforms. As we will 
see, this method offers several advantages over the previous techniques. For one thing, it is 
much more convenient in solving initial value problems for linear constant coefficient equa-
tions when the forcing term contains jump discontinuities.
The Laplace transform of a function f1t2, defined on 30, ∞2, is given by†
(4)	
F1s2 J
L
∞
0
 e-stf1t2dt .
Thus we multiply f1t2 by e-st and integrate with respect to t from 0 to ∞. This takes a function 
of t and produces a function of s.
In this chapter we’ll scrutinize many of the details on this “exchange of functions,” but for 
now let’s simply state the main advantage of executing the transform. The Laplace transform 
replaces linear constant coefficient differential equations in the t-domain by (simpler) algebraic 
equations in the s-domain! In particular, if X1s2 is the Laplace transform of x1t2, then the trans-
form of x′1t2 is simply sX1s2 - x102. Therefore, the information in the differential equation (2) 
and initial condition (3) is transformed from the t-domain to the s-domain simply as
t-Domain                                               s-Domain

500
  x1t2 = g1t2 ,  x102 = 30 ;  sX1s2 - 30 +
3
500X1s2 = G1s2 ,
where G1s2 is the Laplace transform of g1t2. (Notice that we have taken certain linearity 
properties for granted, such as the fact that the transform preserves sums and multiplications 
by constants.) We can find X1s2 in the s-domain without solving any differential equations: the 
solution is simply
(6)	
X1s2 =
30
s + 3>500 +
G1s2
s + 3>500 .
For this procedure to be useful, there has to be an easy way to convert from the t-domain to 
the s-domain and vice versa. There are, in fact, tables and theorems that facilitate this conver-
sion in many useful circumstances. We’ll see, for instance, that the transform of g1t2, despite 
its unpleasant piecewise specification in equation (1), is given by the single formula
G1s2 = 0.24
s
- 0.12
s
 e-10s ,
and as a consequence the transform of x1t2 equals
X1s2 =
30
s + 3>500 +
0.24
s1s + 3>5002 -
0.12e-10s
s1s + 3>5002 .
†Historical Footnote: The Laplace transform was first introduced by Pierre Laplace in 1779 in his research on prob-
ability. G. Doetsch helped develop the use of Laplace transforms to solve differential equations. His work in the 1930s 
served to justify the operational calculus procedures earlier used by Oliver Heaviside.

Figure 7.2 Solution to mixing tank example
Note that to arrive at (7) we did not have to take derivatives of trial solutions, break up 
intervals, or evaluate constants through initial data. The Laplace transform machinery replaces 
all of these operations by basic algebra: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division—and, 
of course, the judicious use of the table. Figure 7.3 depicts the advantages of the transform 
method.
Unfortunately, the Laplace transform method is less helpful with equations containing 
variable coefficients or nonlinear equations (and sometimes determining inverse transforms 
can be a Herculean task!). But it is ideally suited for many problems arising in applications. 
Thus, we devote the present chapter to this important topic.

Section 7.2    Definition of the Laplace Transform          353
In earlier chapters we studied differential operators. These operators took a function and 
mapped or transformed it (via differentiation) into another function. The Laplace transform, 
which is an integral operator, is another such transformation.
7.2  Definition of the Laplace Transform
Laplace Transform
Definition 1.	 Let f1t2 be a function on 30, ∞2. The Laplace transform of f is the 
function F defined by the integral
(1)	
F1s2 J
L
H
0
 e-stf1t2 dt .
The domain of F1s2 is all the values of s for which the integral in (1) exists.† The  
Laplace transform of f is denoted by both F and ℒ5f6.
Notice that the integral in (1) is an improper integral. More precisely,
L
∞

e-stf1t2 dt J lim

e-stf1t2 dt
whenever the limit exists.
Example 1
Determine the Laplace transform of the constant function f1t2 = 1, t Ú 0 .

Since e-sN S 0 when s 7 0 is fixed and N S ∞, we get
F1s2 = 1
s  for  s 7 0 .
When s … 0, the integral 1
∞
0  e-st dt diverges. (Why?) Hence F1s2 = 1>s, with the domain of 
F1s2 being all s 7 0.  ◆
†We treat s as real-valued, but in certain applications s may be a complex variable. For a detailed treatment of complex-
valued Laplace transforms, see Complex Variables and the Laplace Transform for Engineers, by Wilbur R. LePage 
(Dover Publications, New York, 2010), or Fundamentals of Complex Analysis with Applications to Engineering and 
Science (3rd ed.), by E. B. Saff and A. D. Snider (Pearson Education, Boston, MA, 2003).

Again, if s … a the integral diverges, and hence the domain of F1s2 is all s 7 a.  ◆
It is comforting to note from Example 2 that the transform of the constant function 
f1t2 = 1 = e0t is 1>1s - 02 = 1>s, which agrees with the solution in Example 1.
Example 3

Since f1t2 is defined by a different formula on different intervals, we begin by breaking up the 
integral in (1) into three separate parts.† Thus,

Notice that the function f1t2 of Example 4 has jump discontinuities at t = 5 and t = 10. 
These values are reflected in the exponential terms e-5s and e-10s that appear in the formula 
for F1s2. We’ll make this connection more precise when we discuss the unit step function in 
Section 7.6.
An important property of the Laplace transform is its linearity. That is, the Laplace trans-
form ℒ is a linear operator.
†Notice that f1t2 is not defined at the points t = 0, 5, and 10. Nevertheless, the integral in (1) is still meaningful and 
unaffected by the function’s values at finitely many points.
Linearity of the Transform
Theorem 1.	
Let f, f1, and f2 be functions whose Laplace transforms exist for s 7 a and 
let c be a constant. Then, for s 7 a,
(2)	
 ℒ5f1 + f26 = ℒ5f16 + ℒ5f26 ,
(3)	
 ℒ5cf6 = cℒ5f6 .
Proof.  Using the linearity properties of integration, we have for s 7 a

Solution
From the linearity property, we know that the Laplace transform of the sum of any finite num-
ber of functions is the sum of their Laplace transforms. Thus,
 ℒ511 + 5e4t - 6 sin 2t6 = ℒ5116 + ℒ55e4t6 + ℒ5 -6 sin 2t6
 = 11ℒ516 + 5ℒ5e4t6 - 6ℒ5sin 2t6 .
In Examples 1, 2, and 3, we determined that
ℒ5161s2 = 1
s ,  ℒ5e4t61s2 =
1
s - 4 ,  ℒ5sin 2t61s2 =
2
s2 + 22 .
Using these results, we find
 ℒ511 + 5e4t - 6 sin 2t61s2 = 11 a 1

s - 4b - 6 a

s2 + 4b

s - 4 -

s2 + 4 .
Since ℒ516, ℒ5e4t6, and ℒ5sin 2t6 are all defined for s 7 4, so is the transform 
ℒ511 + 5e4t - 6 sin 2t6.  ◆
Table 7.1 lists the Laplace transforms of some of the elementary functions. You should 
become familiar with these, since they are frequently encountered in solving linear differential 
equations with constant coefficients. The entries in the table can be derived from the defini-
tion of the Laplace transform. A more elaborate table of transforms is given on the inside back

Existence of the Transform
There are functions for which the improper integral in (1) fails to converge for any value of s. 
For example, this is the case for the function f1t2 = 1>t, which grows too fast near zero. 
Likewise, no Laplace transform exists for the function f1t2 = et2, which increases too rap-
idly as t S ∞. Fortunately, the set of functions for which the Laplace transform is defined 
includes many of the functions that arise in applications involving linear differential equa-
tions. We now discuss some properties that will (collectively) ensure the existence of the 
Laplace transform.
A function f1t2 on 3a, b4 is said to have a jump discontinuity at t0 ∈1a, b2 if f1t2 is 
discontinuous at t0, but the one-sided limits
lim
tSt-
0  f1t2  and 
lim

0
  f1t2
exist as finite numbers. We have encountered jump discontinuities in Example 4 (page 354) 
and in the input to the mixing tank in Section 7.1 (page 350). If the discontinuity occurs 
at an endpoint, t0 = a (or b), a jump discontinuity occurs if the one-sided limit of f1t2 as 
t S a+1t S b-2 exists as a finite number. We can now define piecewise continuity.
Piecewise Continuity
Definition 2.	 A function f1t2 is said to be piecewise continuous on a finite interval 
3a, b4 if f1t2 is continuous at every point in 3a, b4, except possibly for a finite number 
of points at which f1t2 has a jump discontinuity.
A function f1t2 is said to be piecewise continuous on 30, H2 if f1t2 is piecewise 
continuous on 30, N4 for all N 7 0.

whose graph is sketched in Figure 7.4 (on page 358), is piecewise continuous on 30, 34.

358          Chapter 7    Laplace Transforms
Solution
From the graph of f1t2 we see that f1t2 is continuous on the intervals (0, 1), (1, 2), and (2, 3]. 
Moreover, at the points of discontinuity, t = 0, 1, and 2, the function has jump discontinuities, 
since the one-sided limits exist as finite numbers. In particular, at t = 1, the left-hand limit is 1 
and the right-hand limit is 2. Therefore f1t2 is piecewise continuous on 30, 34.  ◆
Observe that the function f1t2 of Example 4 on page 354 is piecewise continuous on 
30, ∞2 because it is piecewise continuous on every finite interval of the form 30, N4, with 
N 7 0. In contrast, the function f1t2 = 1>t is not piecewise continuous on any interval 
­containing the origin, since it has an “infinite jump” at the origin (see Figure 7.5).
A function that is piecewise continuous on a finite interval is necessarily integrable over 
that interval. However, piecewise continuity on 30, ∞2 is not enough to guarantee the exis-
tence (as a finite number) of the improper integral over 30, ∞2; we also need to consider the

growth of the integrand for large t. Roughly speaking, we’ll show that the Laplace transform 
of a piecewise continuous function exists, provided the function does not grow “faster than an 
exponential.”
Exponential Order A
Definition 3.	 A function f1t2 is said to be of exponential order A if there exist positive 
constants T and M such that
(4)	
0 f1t2 0 … Meat ,        for all t Ú T .
Conditions for Existence of the Transform
Theorem 2.	
If f1t2 is piecewise continuous on 30, ∞2 and of exponential order a, 
then ℒ5f61s2 exists for s 7 a.
For example, f1t2 = e5t sin 2t is of exponential order a = 5 since
0 e5t sin 2t0 … e5t ,
and hence (4) holds with M = 1 and T any positive constant.
We use the phrase f1t2 is of exponential order to mean that for some value of a, the func-
tion f1t2 satisfies the conditions of Definition 3; that is, f1t2 grows no faster than a function of 
the form Meat. The function et2 is not of exponential order. To see this, observe that
lim
tS∞
 et2
eat = lim
tS∞ et1t-a2 = + ∞
for any a. Consequently, et2 grows faster than eat for every choice of a.
The functions usually encountered in solving linear differential equations with constant 
coefficients (e.g., polynomials, exponentials, sines, and cosines) are both piecewise continuous 
and of exponential order. As we now show, the Laplace transforms of such functions exist for 
large enough values of s.
Proof.  We need to show that the integral
L
∞
0
e-stf1t2 dt
converges for s 7 a. We begin by breaking up this integral into two separate integrals:
(5)	
L
T
0
e-stf1t2 dt +
L
∞
T
e-stf1t2 dt ,
where T is chosen so that inequality (4) holds. The first integral in (5) exists because f1t2 and 
hence e-stf1t2 are piecewise continuous on the interval 30, T4 for any fixed s. To see that the 
second integral in (5) converges, we use the comparison test for improper integrals.
Since f1t2 is of exponential order a, we have for t Ú T
0 f1t2 0 … Meat ,

360          Chapter 7    Laplace Transforms
and hence
0 e-stf1t2 0 = e-st0 f1t2 0 … Me-1s-a2t ,
for all t Ú T. Now for s 7 a.
L

Since 0 e-stf1t2 0 … Me-1s-a2t for t Ú T and the improper integral of the larger function con-
verges for s 7 a, then, by the comparison test, the integral
L

T
e-stf1t2 dt
converges for s 7 a. Finally, because the two integrals in (5) exist, the Laplace transform 
ℒ5f61s2 exists for s 7 a.  ◆

In the previous section, we defined the Laplace transform of a function f1t2 as
ℒ5f61s2 J
L

0
 e-stf1t2dt .
Using this definition to get an explicit expression for ℒ5f6 requires the evaluation of the 
improper integral—frequently a tedious task! We have already seen how the linearity property 
of the transform can help relieve this burden. In this section we discuss some further properties 
of the Laplace transform that simplify its computation. These new properties will also enable 
us to use the Laplace transform to solve initial value problems.
7.3  Properties of the Laplace Transform
Translation in s
Theorem 3.	
If the Laplace transform ℒ5f61s2 = F1s2 exists for s 7 a, then
(1)	
ℒ5eatf1t261s2 = F1s - a2
for s 7 a + a .
Proof.  We simply compute

Theorem 3 illustrates the effect on the Laplace transform of multiplication of a function 
f1t2 by eat .

362          Chapter 7    Laplace Transforms
Example 1
Determine the Laplace transform of eat sin bt.
Solution
In Example 3 in Section 7.2, page 354, we found that
ℒ5sin bt61s2 = F1s2 =
b
s2 + b2 .
Thus, by the translation property of F1s2, we have
ℒ5eat sin bt61s2 = F1s - a2 =
b
1s - a22 + b2 .  ◆
Laplace Transform of the Derivative
Theorem 4.	
Let f1t2 be continuous on 30, ∞2 and f′1t2 be piecewise continuous on 
30, ∞2, with both of exponential order a. Then, for s 7 a ,
(2)	
ℒ5f ′61s2 = sℒ5f61s2 −f102 .
Proof.  Since ℒ5f′6 exists, we can use integration by parts 3with u = e-st and dy =
f′1t2dt4 to obtain
(3)	
 ℒ5f′61s2 =

To evaluate limNS∞ e-sNf1N2, we observe that since f1t2 is of exponential order a, there exists 
a constant M such that for N large,
0 e-sNf1N2 0 … e-sNMeaN = Me-1s-a2N .
Hence, for s 7 a,
0 … lim
NS∞0 e-sNf1N2 0 … lim
NS∞Me-1s-a2N = 0 ,
so
lim
NS∞e-sNf1N2 = 0
for s 7 a. Equation (3) now reduces to
ℒ5f′61s2 = sℒ5f61s2 - f102 .  ◆
Using induction, we can extend the last theorem to higher-order derivatives of f1t2. For 
example,
 ℒ5f ″61s2 = sℒ5f′61s2 - f′102
 = s3sℒ5f61s2 - f1024 - f′102 ,

Section 7.3    Properties of the Laplace Transform          363
which simplifies to
ℒ5f ″61s2 = s2ℒ5f61s2 - sf102 - f ′102 .
In general, we obtain the following result.
Laplace Transform of Higher-Order Derivatives
Theorem 5.	
Let f1t2, f′1t2, . . . , f 1n-121t2 be continuous on 30, ∞2 and let f 1n21t2 
be piecewise continuous on 30, ∞2, with all these functions of exponential order a. 
Then, for s 7 a,
(4)	
ℒ5f 1n261s2 = snℒ5f61s2 −sn−1f102 −sn−2f ′102 −P −f 1n−12102 .
The last two theorems shed light on the reason why the Laplace transform is such a useful 
tool in solving initial value problems. Roughly speaking, they tell us that by using the Laplace 
transform we can replace “differentiation with respect to t” with “multiplication by s,” thereby 
converting a differential equation into an algebraic one. This idea is explored in Section 7.5. 
For now, we show how Theorem 4 can be helpful in computing a Laplace transform.
Example 2
Using Theorem 4 and the fact that
ℒ5sin bt61s2 =
b
s2 + b2 ,
determine ℒ5cos bt6 .
Solution
Let f1t2 J sin bt. Then f102 = 0 and f ′1t2 = b cos bt. Substituting into equation (2), we have
 ℒ5f′61s2 = sℒ5f61s2 - f102 ,
 ℒ5b cos bt61s2 = sℒ5sin bt61s2 - 0 ,
 bℒ5cos bt61s2 =
sb
s2 + b2 .
Dividing by b gives
ℒ5cos bt61s2 =
s
s2 + b2 .  ◆

Solution

g1t2 J
L
t
0
f1t2 dt .

364          Chapter 7    Laplace Transforms
Observe that g102 = 0 and g′1t2 = f1t2. Thus, if we apply Theorem 4 to g1t2 3instead of 
f1t24, equation (2) on page 362 reads
ℒ5f1t261s2 = sℒe
L
t
0
f1t2 dtf1s2 - 0 ,
which is equivalent to equation (5).
Now since
sin bt =

 b cos bt dt ,
equation (5) predicts
ℒ5sin bt61s2 = 1
s
 ℒ5b cos bt61s2 = b
s
 ℒ5cos bt61s2 .
This identity is indeed valid for the transforms in Example 2.  ◆
Another question arises concerning the Laplace transform. If F1s2 is the Laplace 
transform of f1t2, is F′1s2 also a Laplace transform of some function of t ? The answer is yes:
F′1s2 = ℒ5 -t f1t261s2 .
In fact, the following more general assertion holds.
Derivatives of the Laplace Transform
Theorem 6.	
Let F1s2 = ℒ5f61s2 and assume f1t2 is piecewise continuous on 
30, ∞2 and of exponential order a. Then, for s 7 a,
(6)	
ℒ5tnf1t261s2 = 1−12n dnF
dsn  1s2 .
Proof.  Consider the identity
dF
ds
 1s2 = d

L

Because of the assumptions on f1t2, we can apply a theorem from advanced calculus (some-
times called Leibniz’s rule) to interchange the order of integration and differentiation:
 dF

 1s2 =

e-stt f1t2 dt = -ℒ5t f1t261s2 .
Thus,
ℒ5t f1t261s2 = 1-12 dF
ds
 1s2 .
The general result (6) now follows by induction on n.  ◆
A consequence of the above theorem is that if f1t2 is piecewise continuous and of 
exponential order, then its transform F1s2 has derivatives of all orders.

Section 7.3    Properties of the Laplace Transform          365
Example 4

In Section 7.2 we defined the Laplace transform as an integral operator that maps a function f1t2 
into a function F1s2. In this section we consider the problem of finding the function f1t2 when 
we are given the transform F1s2. That is, we seek an inverse mapping for the Laplace transform.
To see the usefulness of such an inverse, let’s consider the simple initial value problem
(1)	
y″ - y = -t ;  y102 = 0 ,  y′102 = 1 .
If we take the transform of both sides of equation (1) and use the linearity property of the 
transform, we find
ℒ5y″61s2 - Y1s2 = - 1
s2 ,
7.4  Inverse Laplace Transform

Section 7.4    Inverse Laplace Transform          367
where Y1s2 J ℒ5y61s2. We know the initial values of the solution y1t2, so we can use  
Theorem 5, page 363, on the Laplace transform of higher-order derivatives to express
ℒ5y″61s2 = s2Y1s2 - sy102 - y′102 = s2Y1s2 - 1 .
Substituting for ℒ5y″61s2 yields
s2Y1s2 - 1 - Y1s2 = - 1
s2 .
Solving this algebraic equation for Y1s2 gives
Y1s2 =
1 - a 1
s2 b
s2 - 1
=
s2 - 1
s21s2 - 12 = 1
s2 .
We now recall that ℒ5t61s2 = 1>s2, and since Y1s2 = ℒ5y61s2, we have
ℒ5y61s2 = 1>s2 = ℒ5t61s2 .
It therefore seems reasonable to conclude that y1t2 = t is the solution to the initial value prob-
lem (1). A quick check confirms this!
Notice that in the above procedure, a crucial step is to determine y1t2 from its Laplace 
transform Y1s2 = 1>s2. As we noted, y1t2 = t is such a function, but it is not the only func-
tion whose Laplace function is 1>s2. For example, the transform of
g1t2 J et ,
t ≠6 ,
0 ,
t = 6
is also 1>s2. This is because the transform is an integral, and integrals are not affected by 
changing a function’s values at isolated points. The significant difference between y1t2 and 
g1t2 as far as we are concerned is that y1t2 is continuous on 30, ∞2, whereas g1t2 is not. 
Naturally, we prefer to work with continuous functions, since solutions to differential equa-
tions are continuous. Fortunately, it can be shown that if two different functions have the same 
Laplace transform, at most one of them can be continuous.† With this in mind we give the  
following definition.
Inverse Laplace Transform
Definition 4.	 Given a function F1s2, if there is a function f1t2 that is continuous on 
30, ∞2 and satisfies
(2)	
ℒ5f6 = F ,
then we say that f1t2 is the inverse Laplace transform of F1s2 and employ the notation 
f = ℒ-15F6.
In case every function f1t2 satisfying (2) is discontinuous (and hence not a solution of a 
differential equation), one could choose any one of them to be the inverse transform; the dis-
tinction among them has no physical significance. [Indeed, two piecewise continuous functions 
satisfying (2) can only differ at their points of discontinuity.]
†For this result and further properties of the Laplace transform and its inverse, we refer you to Operational Mathematics, 
3rd ed., by R. V. Churchill (McGraw-Hill, New York, 1971).

368          Chapter 7    Laplace Transforms
Naturally the Laplace transform tables will be a great help in determining the inverse 
Laplace transform of a given function F1s2.
Linearity of the Inverse Transform
Theorem 7.	
Assume that ℒ-15F6, ℒ-15F16, and ℒ-15F26 exist and are continuous 
on 30, ∞2 and let c be any constant. Then
(3)	
 ℒ-15F1 + F26 = ℒ-15F16 + ℒ-15F26 ,
(4)	
 ℒ-15cF6 = cℒ-15F6 .

Determine ℒ-15F6, where

To compute ℒ-15F6, we refer to the Laplace transform table on page 356.

In part (c) we used the technique of completing the square to rewrite the denominator in a form 
that we could find in the table.  ◆
In practice, we do not always encounter a transform F1s2 that exactly corresponds to an 
entry in the second column of the Laplace transform table. To handle more complicated func-
tions F1s2, we use properties of ℒ-1, just as we used properties of ℒ. One such tool is the 
linearity of the inverse Laplace transform, a property that is inherited from the linearity of the 
operator ℒ.

(b)	 F1s2 =

The proof of Theorem 7 is outlined in Problem 37. We illustrate the usefulness of this 
theorem in the next example.

Section 7.4    Inverse Laplace Transform          369
Referring to the Laplace transform tables, we see that
ℒ-1e
1
s - 6 f1t2 = e6t   and   ℒ-1e
s
s2 + 32 f1t2 = cos 3t .
This gives us the first two terms. To determine ℒ-151>1s2 + 4s + 526, we complete the 
square of the denominator to obtain s2 + 4s + 5 = 1s + 222 + 1. We now recognize from the 
tables that
ℒ-1e
1
1s + 222 + 12 f1t2 = e-2t sin t .
Hence,
ℒ-1e
5
s - 6 -

s2 + 9 +

2s2 + 8s + 10 f1t2 = 5e6t - 6 cos 3t + 3e-2t

Example 3
Determine ℒ-1e
5
1s + 224 f.
Solution
The 1s + 224 in the denominator suggests that we work with the formula
ℒ-1e
n!
1s - a2n+1 f1t2 = eattn .
Here we have a = -2 and n = 3, so ℒ-156>1s + 22461t2 = e-2tt3. Using the linearity 
property, we find
ℒ-1e
5
1s + 224 f1t2 = 5

 ℒ-1e
3!
1s + 224 f1t2 = 5
6
 e-2tt3 .  ◆
Example 4
Determine ℒ-1e
3s + 2
s2 + 2s + 10 f .
Solution
By completing the square, the quadratic in the denominator can be written as
s2 + 2s + 10 = s2 + 2s + 1 + 9 = 1s + 122 + 32 .
The form of F1s2 now suggests that we use one or both of the formulas
ℒ-1e
s - a
1s - a22 + b2 f1t2 = eat cos bt ,
ℒ-1e
b
1s - a22 + b2 f1t2 = eat sin bt .
In this case, a = -1 and b = 3. The next step is to express
(5)	
3s + 2
s2 + 2s + 10 = A 
s + 1
1s + 122 + 32 + B 
3
1s + 122 + 32 ,
where A, B are constants to be determined. Multiplying both sides of (5) by s2 + 2s + 10 leaves
3s + 2 = A1s + 12 + 3B = As + 1A + 3B2 ,
which is an identity between two polynomials in s. Equating the coefficients of like terms gives
A = 3 ,  A + 3B = 2 ,

370          Chapter 7    Laplace Transforms
so A = 3 and B = -1>3. Finally, from (5) and the linearity property, we find
 ℒ-1e
3s + 2
s2 + 2s + 10 f1t2 = 3ℒ-1e
s + 1
1s + 122 + 32 f1t2 - 1

Given the choice of finding the inverse Laplace transform of
F11s2 =
7s2 + 10s - 1
s3 + 3s2 - s - 3
or of
F21s2 =
2
s - 1 +
1
s + 1 +
4
s + 3 ,
which would you select? No doubt F21s2 is the easier one. Actually, the two functions F11s2 
and F21s2 are identical. This can be checked by combining the simple fractions that form 
F21s2. Thus, if we are faced with the problem of computing ℒ-1 of a rational function such as 
F11s2, we will first express it, as we did F21s2, as a sum of simple rational functions. This is 
accomplished by the method of partial fractions.
We briefly review this method. Recall from calculus that a rational function of the form 
P1s2>Q1s2, where P1s2 and Q1s2 are polynomials with the degree of P less than the degree 
of Q, has a partial fraction expansion whose form is based on the linear and quadratic factors 
of Q1s2. (We assume the coefficients of the polynomials to be real numbers.) There are three 
cases to consider:
1.	 Nonrepeated linear factors.
2.	 Repeated linear factors.
3.	 Quadratic factors.
1.  Nonrepeated Linear Factors
If Q1s2 can be factored into a product of distinct linear factors,
Q1s2 = 1s - r121s - r22 g1s - rn2 ,
where the ri’s are all distinct real numbers, then the partial fraction expansion has the form
P1s2
Q1s2 =
A1
s −r1
+
A2
s −r2
+ P +
An
s −rn
 ,
where the Ai’s are real numbers. There are various ways of determining the constants 
A1, . . . , An. In the next example, we demonstrate two such methods.
Example 5
Determine ℒ-15F6, where
F1s2 =
7s - 1
1s + 121s + 221s - 32 .
Solution
We begin by finding the partial fraction expansion for F1s2. The denominator consists of three 
distinct linear factors, so the expansion has the form
(6)	
7s - 1
1s + 121s + 221s - 32 =
A
s + 1 +
B
s + 2 +
C
s - 3 ,
where A, B, and C are real numbers to be determined.

Section 7.4    Inverse Laplace Transform          371
One procedure that works for all partial fraction expansions is first to multiply the expan-
sion equation by the denominator of the given rational function. This leaves us with two 
identical polynomials. Equating the coefficients of sk leads to a system of linear equations 
that we can solve to determine the unknown constants. In this example, we multiply (6) by 
1s + 121s + 221s - 32 and find
(7)	
7s - 1 = A1s + 221s - 32 + B1s + 121s - 32 + C1s + 121s + 22 ,†
which reduces to
7s - 1 = 1A + B + C2s2 + 1 -A - 2B + 3C2s + 1 -6A - 3B + 2C2 .
Equating the coefficients of s2, s, and 1 gives the system of linear equations
 A + B + C = 0 ,
 -A - 2B + 3C = 7 ,
 -6A - 3B + 2C = -1 .
Solving this system yields A = 2, B = -3, and C = 1. Hence,
(8)	
7s - 1
1s + 121s + 221s - 32 =
2
s + 1 -
3
s + 2 +
1
s - 3 .
An alternative method for finding the constants A, B, and C from (7) is to choose three 
values for s and substitute them into (7) to obtain three linear equations in the three unknowns. 
If we are careful in our choice of the values for s, the system is easy to solve. In this case, equa-
tion (7) obviously simplifies if s = -1, -2, or 3. Putting s = -1 gives
 -7 - 1 = A1121-42 + B102 + C102 ,
 -8 = -4A .
Hence A = 2. Next, setting s = -2 gives
 -14 - 1 = A102 + B1 -121-52 + C102 ,
 -15 = 5B ,
and so B = -3. Finally, letting s = 3, we similarly find that C = 1. In the case of  
nonrepeated linear factors, the alternative method is easier to use.
Now that we have obtained the partial fraction expansion (8), we use linearity to compute
 ℒ-1e
7s - 1
1s + 121s + 221s - 32 f1t2 = ℒ-1e

s + 2 f1t2
 = + ℒ-1e
1
s - 3 f1t2
 = 2e-t - 3e-2t + e3t .  ◆
†Rigorously speaking, equation (7) was derived for s different from -1, -2, and 3, but by continuity it holds for these 
values as well.

2.  Repeated Linear Factors
If s - r is a factor of Q1s2 and 1s - r2m is the highest power of s - r that divides Q1s2, 
then the portion of the partial fraction expansion of P1s2>Q1s2 that corresponds to the term 
1s - r2m is
A1
s −r +
A2
1s −r22 + P +
Am
1s −r2m ,
where the Ai’s are real numbers.
Example 6
Determine ℒ-1e
s2 + 9s + 2
1s - 1221s + 32 f .
Solution
Since s - 1 is a repeated linear factor with multiplicity two and s + 3 is a nonrepeated linear 
factor, the partial fraction expansion has the form
s2 + 9s + 2
1s - 1221s + 32 =
A
s - 1 +
B
1s - 122 +
C
s + 3 .
We begin by multiplying both sides by 1s - 1221s + 32 to obtain
(9)	
s2 + 9s + 2 = A1s - 121s + 32 + B1s + 32 + C1s - 122 .
Now observe that when we set s = 1 (or s = -3), two terms on the right-hand side of (9) 
vanish, leaving a linear equation that we can solve for B (or C). Setting s = 1 in (9) gives
 1 + 9 + 2 = A102 + 4B + C102 ,
 12 = 4B ,
and, hence, B = 3. Similarly, setting s = -3 in (9) gives
 9 - 27 + 2 = A102 + B102 + 16C
 -16 = 16C .
Thus, C = -1. Finally, to find A, we pick a different value for s, say s = 0. Then, since B = 3 
and C = -1, plugging s = 0 into (9) yields
2 = -3A + 3B + C = -3A + 9 - 1
so that A = 2. Hence,
(10)	
s2 + 9s + 2
1s - 1221s + 32 =
2
s - 1 +
3
1s - 122 -
1
s + 3 .
We could also have determined the constants A, B, and C by first rewriting equation (9) in 
the form
s2 + 9s + 2 = 1A + C2s2 + 12A + B - 2C2s + 1 -3A + 3B + C2 .
Then, equating the corresponding coefficients of s2, s, and 1 and solving the resulting system, 
we again find A = 2, B = 3, and C = -1 .

Section 7.4    Inverse Laplace Transform          373
Now that we have derived the partial fraction expansion (10) for the given rational func-
tion, we can determine its inverse Laplace transform:
 ℒ-1e
s2 + 9s + 2

 = 2et + 3tet - e-3t .  ◆
3.  Quadratic Factors
If 1s - a22 + b2 is a quadratic factor of Q1s2 that cannot be reduced to linear factors with real 
coefficients and m is the highest power of 1s - a22 + b2 that divides Q1s2, then the portion of 
the partial fraction expansion that corresponds to 1s - a22 + b2 is
C1s + D1
1s - a22 + b2 +
C2s + D2
31s - a22 + b242 + g +
Cms + Dm
31s - a22 + b24m .
As we saw in Example 4, page 369, it is more convenient to express Cis + Di in the form 
Ai1s - a2 + bBi when we look up the Laplace transforms. So let’s agree to write this 
­portion of the partial fraction expansion in the equivalent form
A11s −A2 + BB1
1s −A22 + B2
+ A21s −A2 + BB2
31s −A22 + B242 + P + Am1s −A2 + BBm
31s −A22 + B24m .
Example 7
Determine ℒ-1e
2s2 + 10s
1s2 - 2s + 521s + 12 f .
Solution
We first observe that the quadratic factor s2 - 2s + 5 is irreducible (check the sign of the 
discriminant in the quadratic formula). Next we write the quadratic in the form 1s - a22 + b2 
by completing the square:
s2 - 2s + 5 = 1s - 122 + 22 .
Since s2 - 2s + 5 and s + 1 are nonrepeated factors, the partial fraction expansion has the form
2s2 + 10s
1s2 - 2s + 521s + 12 = A1s - 12 + 2B
1s - 122 + 22 +
C
s + 1 .
When we multiply both sides by the common denominator, we obtain
(11)	
2s2 + 10s = 3A1s - 12 + 2B41s + 12 + C1s2 - 2s + 52 .
In equation (11), let’s put s = -1, 1, and 0. With s = -1, we find
 2 - 10 = 3A1 -22 + 2B4102 + C182 ,
 -8 = 8C ,

374          Chapter 7    Laplace Transforms
and, hence, C = -1. With s = 1 in (11), we obtain
2 + 10 = 3A102 + 2B4122 + C142 ,
and since C = -1, the last equation becomes 12 = 4B - 4. Thus B = 4. Finally, setting 
s = 0 in (11) and using C = -1 and B = 4 gives
 0 = 3A1 -12 + 2B4112 + C152 ,
 0 = -A + 8 - 5 ,
 A = 3 .
Hence, A = 3, B = 4, and C = -1 so that
2s2 + 10s
1s2 - 2s + 521s + 12 = 31s - 12 + 2142
1s - 122 + 22
 -  
1
s + 1 .
With this partial fraction expansion in hand, we can immediately determine the inverse 
Laplace transform:
 ℒ-1e
2s2 + 10s
1s2 - 2s + 521s + 12 f1t2 = ℒ-1e

In Section 7.8, we discuss a different method (involving convolutions) for computing 
inverse transforms that does not require partial fraction decompositions. Moreover, the convo-
lution method is convenient in the case of a rational function with a repeated quadratic factor in 
the denominator. Other helpful tools are described in Problems 33–36 and 38–43.
In Problems 1–10, determine the inverse Laplace transform  
of the given function.
In Problems 11–20, determine the partial fraction expansion 
for the given rational function.

Our goal is to show how Laplace transforms can be used to solve initial value problems for 
linear differential equations. Recall that we have already studied ways of solving such initial 
value problems in Chapter 4. These previous methods required that we first find a general 
solution of the differential equation and then use the initial conditions to determine the desired 
solution. As we will see, the method of Laplace transforms leads to the solution of the initial 
value problem without first finding a general solution.
Other advantages to the transform method are worth noting. For example, the technique can 
easily handle equations involving forcing functions having jump discontinuities, as illustrated 
in Section 7.1. Further, the method can be used for certain linear differential equations with 
variable coefficients, a special class of integral equations, systems of differential equations, and 
partial differential equations.
7.5  Solving Initial Value Problems
Method of Laplace Transforms
To solve an initial value problem:
(a)	 Take the Laplace transform of both sides of the equation.
(b)	 Use the properties of the Laplace transform and the initial conditions to obtain an 
equation for the Laplace transform of the solution and then solve this equation for 
the transform.
(c)	 Determine the inverse Laplace transform of the solution by looking it up in a table or 
by using a suitable method (such as partial fractions) in combination with the table.
In step (a) we are tacitly assuming the solution is piecewise continuous on 30, ∞2 and of 
exponential order. Once we have obtained the inverse Laplace transform in step (c), we can 
verify that these tacit assumptions are satisfied.
Example 1
Solve the initial value problem
(1)	
y″ - 2y′ + 5y = -8e-t ;  y102 = 2 ,  y′102 = 12 .

Section 7.5    Solving Initial Value Problems          377
Solution
The differential equation in (1) is an identity between two functions of t. Hence equality holds 
for the Laplace transforms of these functions:
ℒ5y″ - 2y′ + 5y6 = ℒ5 -8e-t6 .
Using the linearity property of ℒ and the previously computed transform of the exponential 
function, we can write
(2)	
ℒ5y″61s2 - 2ℒ5y′61s2 + 5ℒ5y61s2 =
-8
s + 1 .
Now let Y1s2 J ℒ5y61s2. From the formulas for the Laplace transform of higher-order 
derivatives (see Section 7.3) and the initial conditions in (1), we find
 ℒ5y′61s2 = sY1s2 - y102 = sY1s2 - 2 ,
 ℒ5y″61s2 = s2Y1s2 - sy102 - y′102 = s2Y1s2 - 2s - 12 .
Substituting these expressions into (2) and solving for Y1s2 yields
3s2Y1s2 - 2s - 124 - 23sY1s2 - 24 + 5Y1s2 =
-8
s + 1
 1s2 - 2s + 52Y1s2 = 2s + 8 -

s + 1
 Y1s2 =
2s2 + 10s
1s2 - 2s + 521s + 12 .
Our remaining task is to compute the inverse transform of the rational function Y1s2. This 
was done in Example 7 of Section 7.4, page 373, where, using a partial fraction expansion, we 
found
(3)	
y1t2 = 3et cos 2t + 4et sin 2t - e-t ,
which is the solution to the initial value problem (1).  ◆
As a quick check on the accuracy of our computations, the reader is advised to verify that 
the computed solution satisfies the given initial conditions.
The reader is probably questioning the wisdom of using the Laplace transform method to 
solve an initial value problem that can be easily handled by the methods discussed in Chapter 4.  
The objective of the first few examples in this section is simply to make the reader familiar  
with the Laplace transform procedure. We will see in Example 4 and in later sections that the 
method is applicable to problems that cannot be readily handled by the techniques discussed in 
the previous chapters.
Example 2
Solve the initial value problem
(4)	
y″ + 4y′ - 5y = tet ;  y102 = 1 ,  y′102 = 0 .
Solution
Let Y1s2 J ℒ5y61s2. Taking the Laplace transform of both sides of the differential equation 
in (4) gives
(5)	
ℒ5y″61s2 + 4ℒ5y′61s2 - 5Y1s2 =
1
1s - 122 .

378          Chapter 7    Laplace Transforms
Using the initial conditions, we can express ℒ5y′61s2 and ℒ5y″61s2 in terms of Y1s2. That is,
 ℒ5y′61s2 = sY1s2 - y102 = sY1s2 - 1 ,
 ℒ5y″61s2 = s2Y1s2 - sy102 - y′102 = s2Y1s2 - s .
Substituting back into (5) and solving for Y1s2 gives
 3s2Y1s2 - s4 + 43sY1s2 - 14 - 5Y1s2 =
1
1s - 122
 1s2 + 4s - 52Y1s2 = s + 4 +

1s - 122
 1s + 521s - 12Y1s2 = s3 + 2s2 - 7s + 5
1s - 122
 Y1s2 = s3 + 2s2 - 7s + 5
1s + 521s - 123  .
The partial fraction expansion for Y1s2 has the form

1s + 521s - 123 =
A
s + 5 +
B

and D = 1>6. Substituting these values into (6) gives
Y1s2 = 35

Example 3
Solve the initial value problem
(8)	
w″1t2 - 2w′1t2 + 5w1t2 = -8ep-t ; w1p2 = 2 , w′1p2 = 12 .
Solution
To use the method of Laplace transforms, we first move the initial conditions to t = 0. This 
can be done by setting y1t2 J w1t + p2. Then
y′1t2 = w′1t + p2 ,  y″1t2 = w″1t + p2 .
Replacing t by t + p in the differential equation in (8), we have
(9)	
w″1t + p2 - 2w′1t + p2 + 5w1t + p2 = -8ep-1t+p2 = -8e-t .
Substituting y1t2 = w1t + p2 in (9), the initial value problem in (8) becomes
y″1t2 - 2y′1t2 + 5y1t2 = -8e-t ;  y102 = 2 ,  y′102 = 12 .
Because the initial conditions are now given at the origin, the Laplace transform method is 
applicable. In fact, we carried out the procedure in Example 1, page 376, where we found
(10)	
y1t2 = 3et cos 2t + 4et sin 2t - e-t .

Section 7.5    Solving Initial Value Problems          379
Since w1t + p2 = y1t2, then w1t2 = y1t - p2. Hence, replacing t by t - p in (10) gives
 w1t2 = y1t - p2 = 3et-pcos 321t - p24 + 4et-psin 321t - p24 - e-1t-p2
 = 3et-pcos 2t + 4et-psin 2t - ep-t .  ◆
Thus far we have applied the Laplace transform method only to linear equations with 
constant coefficients. Yet several important equations in mathematical physics involve linear 
equations whose coefficients are polynomials in t. To solve such equations using Laplace trans-
forms, we apply Theorem 6, page 364, where we proved that
(11)	
ℒ5tnf1t261s2 = 1-12n dnℒ5f6
dsn
1s2 .
If we let n = 1 and f1t2 = y′1t2, we find
 ℒ5ty′1t261s2 = - d
ds
 ℒ5y′61s2
 = - d
ds
 3sY1s2 - y1024 = -sY′1s2 - Y1s2 .
Similarly, with n = 1 and f1t2 = y″1t2, we obtain from (11)
 ℒ5ty″1t261s2 = - d
ds
 ℒ5y″61s2
 = - d
ds
 3s2Y1s2 - sy102 - y′1024
 = -s2Y′1s2 - 2sY1s2 + y102 .
Thus, we see that for a linear differential equation in y1t2 whose coefficients are polynomials 
in t, the method of Laplace transforms will convert the given equation into a linear differential 
equation in Y1s2 whose coefficients are polynomials in s. Moreover, if the coefficients of the 
given equation are polynomials of degree 1 in t, then (regardless of the order of the given equa-
tion) the differential equation for Y1s2 is just a linear first-order equation. Since we know how 
to solve this first-order equation, the only serious obstacle we may encounter is obtaining the 
inverse Laplace transform of Y1s2. [This problem may be insurmountable, since the solution 
y1t2 may not have a Laplace transform.]
In illustrating the technique, we make use of the following fact. If f1t2 is piecewise 
continuous on 30, ∞2 and of exponential order, then
(12)	
lim
sS∞ℒ5f61s2 = 0 .
(You may have already guessed this from the entries in Table 7.1, page 356.) An outline of the 
proof of (12) is given in Exercises 7.3, page 366, Problem 26.
Example 4
Solve the initial value problem

y″ + 2ty′ - 4y = 1 ,  y102 = y′102 = 0 .

ℒ5y″61s2 + 2ℒ5ty′1t261s2 - 4Y1s2 = 1

Equation (15) is a linear first-order equation and has the integrating factor
m1s2 = e113>s-s>22ds = eln s3-s2>4 = s3e-s2>4
(see Section 2.3). Multiplying (15) by m1s2, we obtain

Now if Y1s2 is the Laplace transform of a piecewise continuous function of exponential order, 
then it follows from equation (12) that
lim
sS∞Y1s2 = 0 .
For this to occur, the constant C in equation (16) must be zero. Hence, Y1s2 = 1>s3, and 
taking the inverse transform gives y1t2 = t2>2. We can easily verify that y1t2 = t2>2 is the 
solution to the given initial value problem by substituting it into (13).  ◆
We end this section with an application from control theory. Let’s consider a servomecha-
nism that models an automatic pilot. Such a mechanism applies a torque to the steering control 
shaft so that a plane or boat will follow a prescribed course. If we let y1t2 be the true direction 
(angle) of the craft at time t and g1t2 be the desired direction at time t, then
e1t2 J y1t2 - g1t2
denotes the error or deviation between the desired direction and the true direction.
Let’s assume that the servomechanism can measure the error e1t2 and feed back to the 
steering shaft a component of torque that is proportional to e1t2 but opposite in sign (see 
Figure 7.6 on page 381). Newton’s second law, expressed in terms of torques, states that
1moment of inertia2 : 1angular acceleration2 = total torque.

Section 7.5    Solving Initial Value Problems          381
For the servomechanism described, this becomes
(17)

Example 5
Determine the error e1t2 for the automatic pilot if the steering shaft is initially at rest in the 
zero direction and the desired direction is given by g1t2 = at, where a is a constant.
Solution
Based on the discussion leading to equation (17), a model for the mechanism is given by the 
initial value problem
(18)	
Iy″1t2 = -ke1t2 ;  y102 = 0 ,  y′102 = 0 ,
where e1t2 = y1t2 - g1t2 = y1t2 - at. We begin by taking the Laplace transform of both 
sides of (18):
 Iℒ5y″61s2 = -kℒ5e61s2
 I3s2Y1s2 - sy102 - y′1024 = -kE1s2
(19)	
 s2IY1s2 = -kE1s2 ,
where Y1s2 = ℒ5y61s2 and E1s2 = ℒ5e61s2. Since
E1s2 = ℒ5y1t2 - at61s2 = Y1s2 - ℒ5at61s2 = Y1s2 - as-2 ,
we find from (19) that
s2IE1s2 + aI = -kE1s2 .
Solving this equation for E1s2 gives
E1s2 = -

s2I + k =

As we can see from equation (20), the automatic pilot will oscillate back and forth about 
the desired course, always “oversteering” by the factor a> 2k>I. Clearly, we can make the 

382          Chapter 7    Laplace Transforms
error small by making k large relative to I, but then the term 2k>I becomes large, causing the 
error to oscillate more rapidly. (See Figure 7.7.) As with vibrations, the oscillations or over-
steering can be controlled by introducing a damping torque proportional to e′1t2 but opposite 
in sign (see Problem 40).

In this section we study special functions that often arise when the method of Laplace trans-
forms is applied to physical problems. Of particular interest are methods for handling func-
tions with jump discontinuities. As we saw in the mixing problem of Section 7.1, jump 
discontinuities occur naturally in any physical situation that involves switching. Finding the 
Laplace transforms of such functions is straightforward; however, we need some theory for 
inverting these transforms. To facilitate this, Oliver Heaviside introduced the following step 
function.
7.6  Transforms of Discontinuous Functions

By shifting the argument of u1t2, the jump can be moved to a different location. That is,

has its jump at t = a. By multiplying by a constant M, the height of the jump can also be 
modified:
Mu1t - a2 = e0 ,

a 6 t .
See Figure 7.8.

(Any Riemann integral, like the Laplace transform, of a function is unaffected if the 
integrand’s value at a single point is changed by a finite amount. Therefore, we do not 
specify a value for u1t2 at t = 0.)

To simplify the formulas for piecewise continuous functions, we employ the rectangular 
window, which turns the step function on and then turns it back off.
†Also known as the square pulse, or the boxcar function.
Rectangular Window Function

The function Πa,b1t2 is displayed in Figure 7.9, and Figure 7.10, illustrating multiplication of a 
function by Πa,b1t2, justifies its name.

Solution
Clearly, from the figure we want to window the function in the intervals (0, 2), (2, 5), and  
(5, 8), and to introduce a step for t 7 8. From (5) we read off the desired representation as

inverse Laplace transform for e-as>s and we write
ℒ-1e e-as
s f1t2 = u1t - a2 .
For the rectangular window function, we deduce from (6) that

Theorem 8.	
Let F1s2 = ℒ5f61s2 exist for s 7 a Ú 0. If a is a positive constant, then
(8)	
ℒ5f1t −a2u1t −a261s2 = e−asF1s2 ,
and, conversely, an inverse Laplace transform† of e-asF1s2 is given by
(9)	
ℒ−15e−asF1s261t2 = f1t −a2u1t −a2 .
Proof.  By the definition of the Laplace transform,

†This inverse transform is in fact a continuous function of t if f102 = 0 and f1t2 is continuous for t Ú 0; the values of 
f1t2 for t 6 0 are of no consequence, since the factor u1t - a2 is zero there.

Section 7.6    Transforms of Discontinuous Functions          387
where, in the last equation, we used the fact that u(t - a2 is zero for t 6 a and equals 1 for 
t 7 a. Now let y = t - a. Then we have dy = dt, and equation (10) becomes
 ℒ5f1t - a2u1t - a261s2 =
L
∞
0
e-ase-syf1y2 dy
 = e-as 
L

e-syf1y2 dy = e-asF1s2 .  ◆
Notice that formula (8) includes as a special case the formula for ℒ5u1t - a26; indeed, if 
we take f1t2 K 1, then F1s2 = 1>s and (8) becomes ℒ5u1t - a261s2 = e-as>s.
In practice it is more common to be faced with the problem of computing the trans-
form of a function expressed as g1t2u1t - a2 rather than f1t - a2u1t - a2. To compute 
ℒ5g1t2u1t - a26, we simply identify g1t2 with f1t - a2 so that f1t2 = g1t + a2. Equation 
(8) then gives
(11)	
ℒ5g1t2u1t −a261s2 = e−asℒ5g1t + a261s2 .
Example 2
Determine the Laplace transform of t2u1t - 12 .
Solution
To apply equation (11), we take g1t2 = t2 and a = 1. Then
g1t + a2 = g1t + 12 = 1t + 122 = t2 + 2t + 1 .
Now the Laplace transform of g1t + a2 is
ℒ5g1t + a261s2 = ℒ5t2 + 2t + 161s2 = 2
s3 + 2
s2 + 1
s .
So, by formula (11), we have
ℒ5t2u1t - 1261s2 = e-se 2
s3 + 2
s2 + 1
s f .  ◆
Example 3
Determine ℒ51cos t2 u1t - p26 .
Solution
Here g1t2 = cos t and a = p. Hence,
g1t + a2 = g1t + p2 = cos1t + p2 = -cos t ,
and so the Laplace transform of g1t + a2 is
ℒ5g1t + a261s2 = -ℒ5cos t61s2 = - 
s
s2 + 1 .
Thus, from formula (11), we get
ℒ51cos t2u1t - p261s2 = -e-ps 
s
s2 + 1 .  ◆

388          Chapter 7    Laplace Transforms
In Examples 2 and 3, we could also have computed the Laplace transform directly from 
the definition. In dealing with inverse transforms, however, we do not have a simple alternative 
formula† upon which to rely, and so formula (9) is especially useful whenever the transform 
has e-as as a factor.

Example 4

Solution
To use the translation property (9), we first express e-2s>s2 as the product e-asF1s2. For this 
purpose, we put e-as = e-2s and F1s2 = 1>s2. Thus, a = 2 and
f1t2 = ℒ-1 e 1
s2 f 1t2 = t .
It now follows from the translation property that
ℒ-1 e e-2s
s2 f1t2 = f1t - 22u1t - 22 = 1t - 22u1t - 22 .
See Figure 7.12.  ◆
As we anticipated in the beginning of this section, step functions arise in the modeling of 
on/off switches, changes in polarity, etc.

Section 7.6    Transforms of Discontinuous Functions          389
Writing g1t2 in terms of the rectangular window function Πa,b1t2 = u1t - a2 - u1t - b2, 
we get
 g1t2 = Π0,11t2 + 1 -12Π1,21t2 = u1t2 - u1t - 12 - 3u1t - 12 - u1t - 224
 = 1 - 2u1t - 12 + u1t - 22 ,
and so
ℒ5g61s2 = 1
s - 2e-s

Thus, when we take the Laplace transform of both sides of (12), we obtain

formulated by Galileo in 1638 (Discourses and Mathematical Demonstrations Relating to Two New Sciences), this 
principle is useful in explaining the limitations on animal growth.
Periodic functions arise frequently in physical situations such as sinusoidal vibrations in struc-
tures, and in electromagnetic oscillations in AC machinery and microwave transmission. Power 
functions 1tn2 occur in more specialized applications: the square-cube law of biomechanics*, 
the cube rule of electoral politics,† Coulomb’s inverse-square force, and, most significantly, the 
Taylor series of Section 3.7 and Chapter 8. The manipulation of these functions’ transforms 
(when they exist) is facilitated by the techniques described in this section.

Periodic Function
Definition 7.	 A function f1t2 is said to be periodic of period T 1 ≠02 if
f1t + T2 = f1t2
for all t in the domain of f.
As we know, the sine and cosine functions are periodic with period 2p and the tangent 
function is periodic with period p.‡ To specify a periodic function, it is sufficient to give its 
values over one period. For example, the square wave function in Figure 7.19 can be expressed 
as

‡A function that has period T will also have period 2T, 3T, etc. For example, the sine function has periods 2p, 4p,

It is convenient to introduce a notation for the “windowed” version of a periodic function 
f1t2, using a rectangular window whose width is the period:
(2)	
fT1t2 J f1t2Π0,T1t2 = f1t23u1t2 - u1t - T24 = ef1t2 ,
0 6 t 6 T ,
0 ,
otherwise .
(See Figure 7.20 on page 392.) The Laplace transform of fT1t2 is given by
FT1s2 =
L
∞
0
 e-st fT1t2 dt =
L
T
0
 e-st f1t2 dt .
It is related to the Laplace transform of f1t2 as follows.
Transform of Periodic Function
Theorem 9.	
If  f  has period T and is piecewise continuous on 30, T4, then the Laplace 
transforms
F1s2 =
L

0
 e-st f1t2 dt    and    FT1s2 =
L
∞
0
 e-st fT1t2 dt =

 e-st f1t2 dt 
are related by
(3)	
FT1s2 = F1s2 31 - e-sT4    or  F1s2 = FT1s2
1−e−sT.
Proof.  From (2) and the periodicity of ƒ, we have
(4)	
fT1t2 = f1t2u1t2 - f1t2u1t - T2 = f1t2u1t2 - f1t - T2u1t - T2 ,
so taking transforms and applying the translation-in-t property (Theorem 8, page 386) yields 
FT1s2 = F1s2 - e-sTF1s2, which is equivalent to (3).  ◆
Example 1
Determine ℒ5f6, where  f  is the periodic square wave function in Figure 7.19.
Solution
Here T = 2. Windowing the function results in fT1t2 = Π0,11t2 - Π1,21t2, so from the for-
mula for the transform of the window function (equation (7) in Section 7.6, page 386) we get 
FT1s2 = 11 - e-s2>s - 1e-s - e-2s2>s = 11 - e-s22>s. Therefore (3) implies
ℒ5f61s2 =
11 - e-s22>s
1 - e-2s
=
1 - e-s
11 + e-s2s .  ◆
Example 2
Determine ℒ5f6, where
f1t2 J •
sin t
t  ,
t ≠0 ,
1 ,
t = 0 .
We next turn to the problem of finding transforms of functions given by a power series. 
Our approach is simply to apply the formula ℒ5tn61s2 = n!/sn+1, n = 0, 1, 2, . . . , to the 
terms of the series.

394          Chapter 7    Laplace Transforms
Solution
We begin by expressing f1t2 in a Taylor series† about t = 0. Since
sin t = t - t3
3! + t5
5! - t7
7! + g ,
then dividing by t, we obtain
f1t2 = sin t
t
= 1 - t2
3! + t4
5! - t6
7! + g
for t 7 0. This representation also holds at t = 0 since
lim
tS0  
 f1t2 = lim
tS0
 sin t
t
= 1 .
Observe that f1t2 is continuous on 30, ∞2 and of exponential order. Hence, its Laplace trans-
form exists for all s sufficiently large. Because of the linearity of the Laplace transform, we 
would expect that
 ℒ5f61s2 = ℒ5161s2 - 1
3!
 ℒ5t261s2 + 1
5!
 ℒ5t461s2 + g
 = 1
s - 2!
3!s3 + 4!
5!s5 - 6!
7!s7 + g
 = 1
s - 1
3s3 + 1
5s5 - 1
7s7 + g .
Indeed, using tools from analysis, it can be verified that this series representation is valid for 
all s 7 1. Moreover, one can show that the series converges to the function arctan11>s2 (see 
Problem 22). Thus,
(5)	
ℒe sin t
t
f1s2 = arctan  1
s .  ◆
A similar procedure involving the series expansion for F1s2 in powers of 1>s can be used 
to compute f1t2 = ℒ-15F61t2 (see Problems 23–25).
We have previously shown, for every nonnegative integer n, that ℒ5tn61s2 = n!>sn+1. 
But what if the power of t is not an integer? Is this formula still valid? To answer this question, 
we need to extend the idea of “factorial.” This is accomplished by the gamma function.‡
Gamma Function
Definition 8.	 The gamma function Γ1r2 is defined by
(6)	
횪1r2 J
L
H
0
 e−uu r−1 du ,  r + 0 .
†For a discussion of Taylor series, see Sections 8.1 and 8.2.
‡Historical Footnote: The gamma function was introduced by Leonhard Euler.
It can be shown that the integral in (6) converges for r 7 0. A useful property of the 
gamma function is the recursive relation
(7)	
횪1r + 12 = r횪1r2 .

Section 7.7    Transforms of Periodic and Power Functions          395
This identity follows from the definition (6) after performing an integration by parts:
 Γ1r + 12 =

 = 0 + r Γ1r2 = r Γ1r2 .
When r is a positive integer, say r = n, then the recursive relation (7) can be repeatedly 
applied to obtain
 Γ1n + 12 = nΓ1n2 = n1n - 12Γ1n - 12 = g
 = n1n - 121n - 22 g2Γ112 .
It follows from the definition (6) that Γ112 = 1, so we find
횪1n + 12 = n! .
Thus, the gamma function extends the notion of factorial.
As an application of the gamma function, let’s return to the problem of determining the 
Laplace transform of an arbitrary power of t. We will verify that the formula
(8)	
ℒ5t r61s2 = 횪1r + 12
s r+1
holds for every constant r 7 -1 .
By definition,
ℒ5tr61s2 =
L
∞
0
e-sttr dt .
Let’s make the substitution u = st. Then du = s dt, and we find
 ℒ5tr61s2 =

e-uu r du = Γ1r + 12
s r+1
 .
Notice that when r = n is a nonnegative integer, then Γ1n + 12 = n!, and so formula (8) 
reduces to the familiar formula for ℒ5tn6.
Example 3
Given that Γ11>22 = 1p (see Problem 26), find the Laplace transform of f1t2 = t3>2e2t.
Solution
We’ll apply the translation-in-s property (Theorem 3, page 361) to the transform for t3>2, which from 
(8) is given by Γ13
2 + 12 >s 
3
2 +1. Thanks to the basic gamma function property (7), we can write
Γa 3
2 + 1b = 3
2Γa 3
2b = 3
2Γa 1
2 + 1b = a 3
2b a 1
2bΓa 1
2b = 3
41p .
Hence ℒ5t3>261s2 = 31p
4s5>2 , and so
ℒ5t3>2e2t6 1s2 =
31p
41s - 225>2 .  ◆

is a simple formula for y1t2 in terms of sin t and g1t2. Just as the integral of a product is not 
the product of the integrals, y1t2 is not the product of sin t and g1t2. However, we can express 
y1t2 as the “convolution” of sin t and g1t2.

Convolution is certainly different from ordinary multiplication. For example,

properties as multiplication.

and 34). Equation (7) is obvious, since f1t - y2 # 0 K 0.  ◆
Returning to our original goal, we now prove that if Y1s2 is the product of the Laplace 
transforms F1s2 and G1s2, then y1t2 is the convolution 1f * g21t2.

Thus we have obtained an integral representation for the solution to the initial value problem (1) 
for any forcing function g1t2 that is piecewise continuous on 30, ∞2 and of exponential order.
Convolution Theorem
Theorem 11.	 Let f1t2 and g1t2 be piecewise continuous on 30, ∞2 and of exponential 
order a and set F1s2 = ℒ5f61s2 and G1s2 = ℒ5g61s2. Then

Solution
Let Y1s2 = ℒ5y61s2 and G1s2 = ℒ5g61s2. Taking the Laplace transform of both sides of 
the differential equation in (11) and using the initial conditions gives

Section 7.8    Convolution          401
As the preceding example attests, the convolution theorem is useful in determining the 
inverse transforms of rational functions of s. In fact, it provides an alternative to the method of 
partial fractions. For example,
ℒ-1e
1
1s - a21s - b2 f1t2 = ℒ-1e a
1
s - ab a
1
s - bb f1t2 = eat * ebt ,
and all that remains in finding the inverse is to compute the convolution eat * ebt.
In the early 1900s, V. Volterra introduced integro-differential equations in his study of 
population growth. These equations enabled him to take into account “hereditary influences.” 
In certain cases, these equations involved a convolution. As the next example shows, the con-
volution theorem helps to solve such integro-differential equations.
Example 3
Solve the integro-differential equation

Equation (12) can be written as
(13)	
y′1t2 = 1 - y1t2 * e-2t .
Let Y1s2 = ℒ5y61s2. Taking the Laplace transform of (13) (with the help of the convolution 
theorem) and solving for Y1s2, we obtain
 sY1s2 - 1 = 1
s - Y1s2 a

Hence, y1t2 = 2 - e-t .  ◆
The transfer function H1s2 of a linear system is defined as the ratio of the Laplace trans-
form of the output function y1t2 to the Laplace transform of the input function g1t2, under 
the assumption that all initial conditions are zero. That is, H1s2 = Y1s2>G1s2. If the linear 
system is governed by the differential equation
(14)	
ay″ + by′ + cy = g1t2 ,  t 7 0 ,
where a, b, and c are constants, we can compute the transfer function as follows. Take the 
Laplace transform of both sides of (14) to get
as2Y1s2 - asy102 - ay′102 + bsY1s2 - by102 + cY1s2 = G1s2 .
Because the initial conditions are assumed to be zero, the equation reduces to
1as2 + bs + c2Y1s2 = G1s2 .

402          Chapter 7    Laplace Transforms
Thus the transfer function for equation (14) is
(15)	
H1s2 = Y1s2
G1s2 =
1
as2 + bs + c .
You may note the similarity of these calculations to those for finding the auxiliary  
equation for the homogeneous equation associated with (14) (recall Section 4.2, page 157). 
Indeed, the first step in inverting Y1s2 = G1s2>1as2 + bs + c2 would be to find the roots 
of the denominator as2 + bs + c, which is identical to solving the characteristic equation  
for (14).
The function h1t2 J ℒ-15H61t2 is called the impulse response function for the system 
because, physically speaking, it describes the solution when a mass–spring system is struck by 
a hammer (see Section 7.9). We can also characterize h1t2 as the unique solution to the homo-
geneous problem
(16)	
ah″ + bh′ + ch = 0 ;  h102 = 0 ,  h′102 = 1>a .
Indeed, observe that taking the Laplace transform of the equation in (16) gives
(17)	
a3s2H1s2 - sh102 - h′1024 + b3sH1s2 - h1024 + cH1s2 = 0 .
Substituting in h102 = 0 and h′102 = 1>a and solving for H1s2 yields
H1s2 =
1
as2 + bs + c ,
which is the same as the formula for the transfer function given in equation (15).
One nice feature of the impulse response function h is that it can help us describe the 
solution to the general initial value problem
(18)	
ay″ + by′ + cy = g1t2 ;  y102 = y0 ,  y′102 = y1 .
From the discussion of equation (14), we can see that the convolution h * g is the solution to (18) in 
the special case when the initial conditions are zero (i.e., y0 = y1 = 02. To deal with nonzero 
initial conditions, let yk denote the solution to the corresponding homogeneous initial value 
problem; that is, yk solves
(19)	
ay″ + by′ + cy = 0 ;  y102 = y0 ,  y′102 = y1 .
Then, the desired solution to the general initial value problem (18) must be h * g + yk. 
Indeed, it follows from the superposition principle (see Theorem 3 in Section 4.5) that since 
h * g is a solution to equation (14) and yk is a solution to the corresponding homogeneous 
equation, then h * g + yk is a solution to equation (14). Moreover, since h * g has initial con-
ditions zero,
1h * g2102 + yk102 = 0 + y0 = y0 ,
1h * g2′102 + y=
k102 = 0 + y1 = y1 .
We summarize these observations in the following theorem.

Section 7.8    Convolution          403
Equation (20) is instructive in that it highlights how the value of y at time t depends on the 
initial conditions (through yk1t22 and on the nonhomogeneity g1t2 (through the convolution 
integral). It even displays the causal nature of the dependence, in that the value of g1y2 cannot 
influence y1t2 until t Ú y.
A proof of Theorem 12 that does not involve Laplace transforms is outlined in Project E 
in Chapter 4.
In the next example, we use Theorem 12 to find a formula for the solution to an initial 
value problem.
Solution Using Impulse Response Function
Theorem 12.	 Let I be an interval containing the origin. The unique solution to the initial 
value problem

H1s2 =

s2 + 2s + 5 =

To solve the initial value problem, we need the solution to the corresponding homogeneous 
problem. The auxiliary equation for the homogeneous equation is r2 + 2r + 5 = 0, which has 
roots r = -1 { 2i. Thus a general solution is C1e-t cos 2t + C2e-t sin 2t. Choosing C1 and C2 
so that the initial conditions in (21) are satisfied, we obtain yk1t2 = 2e-t cos 2t.
Hence, a formula for the solution to the initial value problem (21) is

[Hint: Use Leibniz’s rule, described in Project E of

In mechanical systems, electrical circuits, bending of beams, and other applications, one 
encounters functions that have a very large value over a very short interval. For example, the 
strike of a hammer exerts a relatively large force over a relatively short time, and a heavy 
weight concentrated at a spot on a suspended beam exerts a large force over a very small sec-
tion of the beam. To deal with violent forces of short duration, physicists and engineers use the 
delta function introduced by Paul A. M. Dirac. Relaxing our standards of rigor for the moment, 
we present the following somewhat informal definition.
7.9  Impulses and the Dirac Delta Function
Dirac Delta Function
Definition 10.	 The Dirac delta function d1t2 is characterized by the following two 
properties:
(1)	
D1t2 = e0 ,
t 3 0 ,
“infinite,”
t = 0 ,
and
(2)	
L
H
−H
 f1t2D1t2dt = f102
for any function f1t2 that is continuous on an open interval containing t = 0.
By shifting the argument of d1t2, we have d1t - a2 = 0, t ≠a, and
(3)	
L
∞
-∞
 f1t2d1t - a2dt = f1a2
for any function f1t2 that is continuous on an interval containing t = a.
It is obvious that d1t - a2 is not a function in the usual sense; instead it is an example of 
what is called a generalized function or a distribution. Despite this shortcoming, the Dirac 

406          Chapter 7    Laplace Transforms
delta function was successfully used for several years to solve various physics and engineering 
problems before Laurent Schwartz mathematically justified its use!
A heuristic argument for the existence of the Dirac delta function can be made by consid-
ering the impulse of a force over a short interval. If a force ℱ1t2 is applied from time t0 to time 
t1, then the impulse due to ℱ is the integral
Impulse J
L
t1
t0
 ℱ1t2dt .
By Newton’s second law, we see that
(4)	
L
t1
t0
 ℱ1t2 dt =
L

t0
 m dy
dt
 dt = my1t12 - my1t02 ,
where m denotes mass and y denotes velocity. Since my represents the momentum, we can 
interpret equation (4) as saying: The impulse equals the change in momentum.
When a hammer strikes an object, it transfers momentum to the object. This change in 
momentum takes place over a very short period of time, say, 3t0, t14. If we let ℱ11t2 represent 
the force due to the hammer, then the area under the curve ℱ11t2 is the impulse or change in 
momentum (see Figure 7.26). If, as is illustrated in Figure 7.27, the same change in momentum 
takes place over shorter and shorter time intervals—say, 3t0, t24 or 3t0, t34—then the average 
force must get greater and greater in order for the impulses (the areas under the curves ℱn) to 
remain the same. In fact, if the forces ℱn having the same impulse act, respectively, over the 
intervals 3t0, tn4, where tn S t0 as n S ∞, then ℱn approaches a function that is zero for t ≠t0 
but has an infinite value for t = t0. Moreover, the areas under the ℱn’s have a common value. 
Normalizing this value to be 1 gives

When t0 = 0, we derive from the limiting properties of the ℱn’s a “function” d that satisfies 
property (1) and the integral condition
(5)	
L
∞
-∞
d1t2 dt = 1 .
Notice that (5) is a special case of property (2) that is obtained by taking f1t2 K 1. It is inter-
esting to note that (1) and (5) actually imply the general property (2) (see Problem 33).
The Laplace transform of the Dirac delta function can be quickly derived from property 
(3). Since d1t - a2 = 0 for t ≠a, then setting f1t2 = e-st in (3), we find for a Ú 0
L

e-std1t - a2 dt = e-as .
Thus, for a Ú 0,
(6)	
ℒ5D1t −a261s2 = e-as .
An interesting connection exists between the unit step function and the Dirac delta func-
tion. Observe that as a consequence of equation (5) and the fact that d1x - a2 is zero for x 6 a 
and for x 7 a, we have
(7)	
 
L
t
-∞
d1x - a2 dx = e0 ,
t 6 a ,

 = u1t - a2 .
If we formally differentiate both sides of (7) with respect to t (in the spirit of the fundamental 
theorem of calculus), we find
d1t - a2 = u′1t - a2 .
Thus it appears that the Dirac delta function is the derivative of the unit step function. That is, 
in fact, the case if we consider “differentiation” in a more general sense.†
The Dirac delta function is used in modeling mechanical vibration problems involving 
an impulse. For example, a mass–spring system at rest that is struck by a hammer exerting an 
impulse on the mass might be governed by the symbolic initial value problem
(8)	
x″ + x = d1t2 ;  x102 = 0 ,  x′102 = 0 ,
where x1t2 denotes the displacement from equilibrium at time t. We refer to this as a symbolic 
problem because while the left-hand side of equation (8) represents an ordinary function, the 
right-hand side does not. Consequently, it is not clear what we mean by a solution to problem (8). 
Because d1t2 is zero everywhere except at t = 0, one might be tempted to treat (8) as a homo-
geneous equation with zero initial conditions. But the solution to the latter is zero everywhere, 
which certainly does not describe the motion of the spring after the mass is struck by the hammer.
To define what is meant by a solution to (8), recall that d1t2 is depicted as the limit of 
forces ℱn1t2 having unit impulse and acting over shorter and shorter intervals. If we let yn1t2 
be the solution to the initial value problem
(9)	
y>
n + yn = ℱn1t2 ;  yn102 = 0 ,  y=
n102 = 0 ,
where d is replaced by ℱn, then we can think of the solution x1t2 to (8) as the limit (as n S ∞2 
of the solutions yn1t2.

Also, for t = 0, we have limnS∞ yn102 = 0 = sin 0. Therefore,
lim
nS∞ yn1t2 = sin t .
Hence, the solution to the symbolic initial value problem (8) is x1t2 = sin t.
Fortunately, we do not have to go through the tedious process of solving for each yn in 
order to find the solution x of the symbolic problem. It turns out that the Laplace transform 
method when applied directly to (8) yields the derived solution x1t2. Indeed, simply taking the 
Laplace transform of both sides of (8), we obtain from (6) (with a = 0)
 1s2 + 12X1s2 = 1 ,
 X1s2 =
1
s2 + 1 ,
which gives
x1t2 = ℒ-1 e

s2 + 1 f1t2 = sin t .
A peculiarity of using the Dirac delta function is that the solution x1t2 = sin t of the sym-
bolic initial value problem (8) does not satisfy both initial conditions; that is, x′102 = 1 ≠0. 
This reflects the fact that the impulse d1t2 is applied at t = 0. Thus, the momentum x′ (observe 
that in equation (8) the mass equals one) jumps abruptly from x′102 = 0 to x′10+2 = 1.

In the next example, the Dirac delta function is used in modeling a mechanical vibration 
problem.
Example 1
A mass attached to a spring is released from rest 1 m below the equilibrium position for the 
mass–spring system and begins to vibrate. After p seconds, the mass is struck by a hammer

where x1t2 denotes the displacement from equilibrium at time t. Determine x1t2.
Solution
Let X1s2 = ℒ5x61s2. Since
ℒ5x″61s2 = s2X1s2 - s   and   ℒ5d1t - p261s2 = e-ps ,
taking the Laplace transform of both sides of (11) and solving for X1s2 yields

 X1s2 =

In Section 7.8 we defined the impulse response function for
(12)	
ay″ + by′ + cy = g1t2
as the function h1t2 J ℒ-15H61t2, where H1s2 is the transfer function. Recall that H1s2 
is the ratio
H1s2 J Y1s2
G1s2 ,
where Y1s2 is the Laplace transform of the solution to (12) with zero initial conditions and G1s2 
is the Laplace transform of g1t2. It is important to note that H1s2, and hence h1t2, does not 
depend on the choice of the function g1t2 in (12) [see equation (15) in Section 7.8, page 402]. 
However, it is useful to think of the impulse response function as the solution of the symbolic 
initial value problem
(13)	
ay″ + by′ + cy = D1t2 ;  y102 = 0 ,  y′102 = 0 .
Indeed, with g1t2 = d1t2, we have G1s2 = 1, and hence H1s2 = Y1s2. Consequently, 
h1t2 = y1t2. So we see that the function h1t2 is the response to the impulse d1t2 for a 
mechanical system governed by the symbolic initial value problem (13).

412          Chapter 7    Laplace Transforms
We can use the Laplace transform to reduce certain systems of linear differential equations with 
initial conditions to a system of linear algebraic equations, where again the unknowns are the 
transforms of the functions that make up the solution. Solving for these unknowns and taking 
their inverse Laplace transforms, we can then obtain the solution to the initial value problem 
for the system.
7.10  Solving Linear Systems with Laplace Transforms
Example 1
Solve the initial value problem
(1)	
 x′1t2 - 2y1t2 = 4t ;
 x102 = 4 ,
	
 y′1t2 + 2y1t2 - 4x1t2 = -4t - 2 ;   y102 = -5 .
Solution
Taking the Laplace transform of both sides of the differential equations gives
(2)
	
 ℒ5x′61s2 - 2ℒ5y61s2 = 4
s2 ,
	
 ℒ5y′61s2 + 2ℒ5y61s2 - 4ℒ5x61s2 = -  4
s2 - 2
s .
Let X1s2 J ℒ5x61s2 and Y1s2 J ℒ5y61s2. Then, by Theorem 4 on page 362,
 ℒ5x′61s2 = sX1s2 - x102 = sX1s2 - 4 ,
 ℒ5y′61s2 = sY1s2 - y102 = sY1s2 + 5 .
Substituting these expressions into system (2) and simplifying, we find
(3)
	
 sX1s2 - 2Y1s2 = 4s2 + 4
s2
 ,
	
 -4X1s2 + 1s + 22Y1s2 = -  5s2 + 2s + 4
s2
 .
To eliminate Y1s2 from the system, we multiply the first equation by 1s + 22 and the 
second by 2 and then add to obtain
3s1s + 22 - 84X1s2 = 1s + 2214s2 + 42
s2
 -  10s2 + 4s + 8
s2
 .
This simplifies to
X1s2 =
4s - 2
1s + 421s - 22 .
To compute the inverse transform, we first write X1s2 in the partial fraction form
X1s2 =
3
s + 4 +
1
s - 2 .
Hence, from the Laplace transform table on the inside back cover, we find that
(4)	
x1t2 = 3e-4t + e2t .

Section 7.10    Solving Linear Systems with Laplace Transforms          413
To determine y1t2, we could solve system (3) for Y1s2 and then compute its inverse 
Laplace transform. However, it is easier just to solve the first equation in system (1) for y1t2 in 
terms of x1t2. Thus,
y1t2 = 1
2
 x′1t2 - 2t .
Substituting x1t2 from equation (4), we find that
(5)	
y1t2 = -6e-4t + e2t - 2t .
The solution to the initial value problem (1) consists of the pair of functions x1t2, y1t2 given 
by equations (4) and (5).  ◆

Chapter 7 Summary
The use of the Laplace transform helps to simplify the process of solving initial value problems 
for certain differential and integral equations, especially when a forcing function with jump 
discontinuities is involved. The Laplace transform ℒ5f6 of a function f1t2 is defined by
ℒ5f61s2 J
L
∞
0
 e−stf1t2 dt
for all values of s for which the improper integral exists. If f1t2 is piecewise continuous on 
30, ∞2 and of exponential order a (that is, 0 f1t2 0  grows no faster than a constant times eat as 
t S ∞), then ℒ5f61s2 exists for all s 7 a.
The Laplace transform can be interpreted as an integral operator that maps a function f1t2 
to a function F1s2. The transforms of commonly occurring functions appear in Table 7.1, page 
356, and on the inside back cover of this book. The use of these tables is enhanced by several 
important properties of the operator ℒ.
Linearity:  ℒ5af + bg6 = aℒ5f6 + bℒ5g6.
Translation in s:  ℒ5eatf1t261s2 = F1s - a2, where F = ℒ5f6.
Translation in t:  ℒ5g1t2u1t - a261s2 = e-asℒ5g1t + a261s2, where u1t - a2 
is the step function that equals 1 for t 7 a and 0 for t 6 a. If f1t2 is continuous and 
f102 = 0, then
ℒ-15e-asF1s261t2 = f1t - a2u1t - a2 ,
where f = ℒ-15F6.
Convolution Property:  ℒ5f * g6 = ℒ5f6ℒ5g6, where f * g denotes the 
­convolution function

Review Problems for Chapter 7          415
One reason for the usefulness of the Laplace transform lies in the simple formula for the 
transform of the derivative f′:
(1)	
ℒ5f′61s2 = sF1s2 - f102 ,  where  F = ℒ5f6 .
This formula shows that by using the Laplace transform, “differentiation with respect to t” can 
essentially be replaced by the simple operation of “multiplication by s.” The extension of (1) to 
higher-order derivatives is
(2)	
ℒ5f 1n261s2 = s  nF1s2 - s  n-1f102 - sn-2f′102 - g - f 1n-12102 .
To solve an initial value problem of the form
(3)	
ay″ + by′ + cy = f1t2 ;  y102 = a ,  y′102 = b
via the Laplace transform method, one takes the transform of both sides of the differential equa-
tion in (3). Using the linearity of ℒ and formula (2) leads to an equation involving the Laplace 
transform Y1s2 of the (unknown) solution y1t2. The next step is to solve this simpler equation 
for Y1s2. Finally, one computes the inverse Laplace transform of Y1s2 to obtain the desired 
solution. This last step of finding ℒ-15Y6 is often the most difficult. Sometimes it requires a 
partial fractions decomposition, a judicious use of the properties of the transform, an excursion 
through the Laplace transform tables, or the evaluation of a contour integral in the complex 
plane.
For the special problem in (3), where a, b, and c are constants, the differential equation is 
transformed to a simple algebraic equation for Y1s2. Another nice feature of this latter equa-
tion is that it incorporates the initial conditions. When the coefficients of the equation in (3) 
depend on t, the following formula may be helpful in taking the transform:
ℒ5tn f1t261s2 = 1-12n  dnF
dsn  1s2 ,  where  F = ℒ5f6 .
If the forcing function f1t2 in equation (3) has jump discontinuities, it is often convenient to 
write f1t2 in terms of unit step functions u1t - a2 before proceeding with the Laplace transform 
method. For this purpose, the rectangular window function Πa,b1t2 = u1t - a2 - u1t - b2 is 
useful. The transform of a periodic function f1t2 with period T is given by
ℒ5f61s2 = L
T
0
 e-stf1t2 dt
1 - e-sT
 .
The Dirac delta function d1t2 is useful in modeling a system that is excited by a large 
force applied over a short time interval. It is not a function in the usual sense but can be roughly 
interpreted as the derivative of a unit step function. The transform of d1t - a2 is
ℒ5d1t - a261s2 = e-as ,  a Ú 0 .

ℒ5input6  ,
where all initial conditions are taken to be zero, is called the transfer function for the system. 
(As mentioned in Section 7.8, the transfer function H1s2 depends only on the constants a, b, c of 
the system; it is not affected by the choice of g.) If the output function g1t2 is the unit step func-
tion u1t2, then equation (2) yields
ℒ5y61s2 = ℒ5u61s2H1s2 =

 .
The solution (output function) in this special case is called the indicial admittance and is denoted 
by A1t2. Hence, ℒ5A61s2 = H1s2>s.
It is possible to express the response y1t2 of the system to a general input function g1t2 in 
terms of g1t2 and the indicial admittance A1t2. To derive these relations, proceed as follows:

Equations (5)–(8) are referred to as Duhamel’s formulas, in honor of the French mathemati-
cian J. M. C. Duhamel. These formulas are helpful in determining the response of the system to a 
general input g1t2, since the indicial admittance of the system can be determined experimentally 
by measuring the response of the system to a unit step function.
(e)	 The impulse response function h1t2 is defined as h1t2 J ℒ-15H61t2, where H1s2 
is the transfer function. Show that h1t2 = A′1t2, so that equations (5) and (7) can be 
written in the form

y1t2 =

 h1t - y2g1y2 dy =

 h1y2g1t - y2 dy .
We remark that the indicial admittance is the response of the system to a unit step function, 
and the impulse response function is the response to the unit impulse or delta function (see Section 7.9). 
But the delta function is the derivative (in a generalized sense) of the unit step function. Therefore, 
the fact that h1t2 = A′1t2 is not really surprising.
Frequency response modeling of a linear system is based on the premise that the dynamics of a 
linear system can be recovered from a knowledge of how the system responds to sinusoidal inputs. 
(This will be made mathematically precise in Theorem 13.) In other words, to determine (or iden-
tify) a linear system, all one has to do is observe how the system reacts to sinusoidal inputs.
Let’s assume that we have a linear system governed by
(10)	
y″ + py′ + qy = g1t2 ,
where p and q are real constants. The function g1t2 is called the forcing function or input function. 
When g1t2 is a sinusoid, the particular solution to (10) obtained by the method of undetermined 
coefficients is the steady-state solution or output function yss1t2 corresponding to g1t2. We can 
think of a linear system as a compartment or block into which goes an input function g and out 
of which comes the output function yss (see Figure 7.32). To identify a linear system means to 
determine the coefficients p and q in equation (10).

It will be convenient for us to work with complex variables. A complex number z is usually 
expressed in the form z = a + ib, with a, b real numbers and i denoting 1-1. We can also 
express z in polar form, z = reiu, where r2 = a2 + b2 and tan u = b>a. Here r 1Ú02 is called 
the magnitude and u the phase angle of z.
The following theorem gives the relationship between the linear system and its response to 
sinusoidal inputs in terms of the transfer function H1s2 [see Project A, equation (2), page 417].
Steady-State Solutions to Sinusoidal Inputs
Theorem 13.	 Let H1s2 be the transfer function for equation (10). If H1s2 is finite at 
s = iv, with v real, then the steady-state solution to (10) for g1t2 = eiv t is
(11)	
yss1t2 = H1iV2eiV t = H1iV25cos V t + i sin V t6 .
(a)	 Prove Theorem 13. 3Hint: Guess yss1t2 = Aeiv t and show that A = H1iv2.4
(b)	 Use Theorem 13 to show that if g1t2 = sin vt, then the steady-state solution to (10) is
	
M1v2 sin3vt + N1v24, where H1iv2 = M1v2eiN1v2 is the polar form for H1iv2.
(c)	 Solve for M1v2 and N1v2 in terms of p and q.
(d)	 Experimental results for modeling done by frequency response methods are usually pre-
sented in frequency response† or Bode plots. There are two types of Bode plots. The 
first is the log of the magnitude M1v2 of H1iv2 versus the angular frequency v using 
a log scale for v. The second is a plot of the phase angle or argument N1v2 of H1iv2 
versus the angular frequency using a log scale for v. The Bode plots for the transfer 
function H1s2 = 11 + 0.2s + s22-1 are given in Figure 7.33.
†Frequency response curves are also discussed in Section 4.10.

In most applications there are some inaccuracies in the measurement of the magnitudes and 
frequencies. To compensate for these errors, sinusoids with several different frequencies are used 
as input. A least-squares approximation for p and q is then found. For a discussion of frequency 
response modeling as a mathematical modeling tool, see the chapter by W. F. Powers, “Model-
ing Linear Systems by Frequency Response Methods,” in Differential Equations Models, by  
M. Braun, C. Coleman, and D. Drew (eds.) (Springer-Verlag, New York, 1983), Chapter 9. Additional 
examples may be found in Schaum’s Outline on Feedback and Control Systems, by J. J. DiStefano, 
A. R. Stubberud, and I. J. Williams (McGraw-Hill, New York, 1995, 3rd edition), Chapter 15.
In mechanical design one sometimes must determine system parameters even though information 
on the system forces is incomplete. For example, the differential equation governing the motion

to be

Probably the best tool for numerically approximating a function f1x2 near a particular point 
x0 is the Taylor polynomial. The formula for the Taylor polynomial of degree n centered at x0, 
approximating a function f1x2 possessing n derivatives at x0, is given by

 pn1x2 = f1x02 + f′1x021x - x02 + f ″1x02

This polynomial matches the value of f and the values of its derivatives, up to the order of the 
polynomial, at the point x0:

 p21x2 = 1 + x + x2

Their efficacy in approximating the exponential function is demonstrated in Figure 8.1, page 422.
The Taylor polynomial of degree n differs from the polynomial of the next lower degree 
only in the addition of a single term:

so a listing like (2) is clearly redundant—one can read off p01x2, p11x2, and p21x2 from the 
formula for p31x2. In fact, if f is infinitely differentiable, pn1x2 is just the 1n + 12st partial

Section 8.1    Introduction: The Taylor Polynomial Approximation           423
To relate this approximation scheme to our theme (the solution of differential equations), 
we alter our point of view; we regard a differential equation not as a “condition to be satisfied,” 
but as a prescription for constructing the Taylor polynomials for its solutions. Besides provid-
ing a very general method for computing accurate approximate solutions to the equation near 
any particular “starting” point, this interpretation also provides insight into the role of the ini-
tial conditions. The following example illustrates the method.
Example 2
Find the first few Taylor polynomials approximating the solution around x0 = 0 of the initial 
value problem
y″ = 3y′ + x2y ;  y102 = 10 ,  y′102 = 5 .
Solution

y″102

we need the values of y102, y′102, y″102, y‴102, etc. The first two are provided by the given 
initial conditions. The value of y″102 can be deduced from the differential equation itself and 
the values of the lower derivatives:
y″102 = 3y′102 + 02y102 = 3 # 5 + 0 # 10 = 15 .
Now since y″ = 3y′ + x2y holds for some interval around x0 = 0, we can differentiate both 
sides to derive
 y‴ = 3y″ + 2 xy + x2y′ ,
 y142 = 3y‴ + 2y + 2xy′ +  2xy′ + x2y″ = 3y‴ + 2y +  4xy′ + x2y″ ,
 y152 = 3y142 + 2y′ + 4y′ + 4xy″ + 2xy″ + x2y‴ = 3y142 + 6y′ + 6xy″ + x2y‴ .
Thus on substituting x = 0 we deduce, in turn, that
 y‴102 = 3 # 15 + 2 # 0 # 10 + 02 # 5 = 45 ,
 y142102 = 3 # 45 + 2 # 10 + 4 # 0 # 5 + 02 # 15 = 155 ,
 y152102 = 3 # 155 + 6 # 5 + 6 # 0 # 15 + 02 # 45 = 495 .
Consequently the Taylor polynomial of degree 5 for the solution is given by
 p51x2 = 10 + 5x + 15

It is of interest to note that if the original equation in Example 2 were replaced by 
y″ = 3y′ + x1>3y, the third derivative would look like y‴ = 3y″ + y>13x2>32 + x1>3y′, and 
y‴102 would not exist. Only Taylor polynomials of degree 0 through 2 can be constructed for 
the solution to this problem.
The next example demonstrates the application of the Taylor polynomial method to a 
nonlinear equation.
Example 3

y′ =

x + y + 1 ,  y102 = 0 .

424          Chapter 8    Series Solutions of Differential Equations
Solution
Using y102 = 0, we substitute x = 0 and y = 0 into equation (4) and find that y′102 = 1. 
To determine y″102, we differentiate both sides of the equation in (4) with respect to x, thereby 
getting an expression for y″1x2 in terms of x, y1x2, and y′1x2. That is,
(5)	
y″1x2 = 1 -123x + y1x2 + 14-231 + y′1x24 .
Substituting x = 0, y102 = 0, and y′102 = 1 in (5), we obtain
y″102 = 1 -12112-211 + 12 = -2 .
Similarly, differentiating (5) and substituting, we obtain
 y‴1x2 = 23x + y1x2 + 14-331 + y′1x242 - 3x + y1x2 + 14-2y″1x2 ,
 y‴102 = 2112-311 + 122 - 112-21 -22 = 10 .
Thus, the Taylor polynomial of degree 3 is
p31x2 = 0 + x - x2 + 10

 x3 = x - x2 + 5

In a theoretical sense we can estimate the accuracy to which a Taylor polynomial pn1x2 
approximates its target function f1x2 for x near x0. Indeed, if we let en1x2 measure the accu-
racy of the approximation,
en1x2 J f1x2 - pn1x2 ,
then calculus provides us with several formulas for estimating en. The most transparent is due 
to Lagrange: if the 1n + 12st derivative of f exists and is continuous on an interval containing 
x0 and x, then
(6)	
En1x2 = f  1n+121J2
1n + 12!
 1x −x02n+1 ,
where j, although unknown, is guaranteed to lie between x0 and x.†
Figure 8.1 on page 422 and equation (6) suggest that one might control the error in the 
Taylor polynomial approximation by increasing the degree n of the polynomial (i.e., taking 
more terms), thereby increasing the factor 1n + 12! in the denominator. This possibility is lim-
ited, of course, by the number of times f can be differentiated. In Example 2, for instance, 
the solution did not have a fifth derivative at x0 = 0 (f 152102 is “infinite”). Thus, we could 
not construct p51x2, nor could we conclude anything about the accuracy of p41x2 from the 
Lagrange formula.
However, for Example 3 we could, in theory, compute every derivative of the solution 
y1x2 at x0 = 0, and speculate on the convergence of the Taylor series

to the solution y1x2. Now for nonlinear equations such as (4), the factor f (n+1)1j2 in the 
Lagrange error formula may grow too rapidly with n, and the convergence can be thwarted. 
But if the differential equation is linear and its coefficients and nonhomogeneous term enjoy 
a feature known as analyticity, our wish is granted; the error does indeed diminish to zero as 
the degree n goes to infinity, and the sequence of Taylor polynomials can be guaranteed to 
converge to the actual solution on a certain (known) interval. For instance, the exponential, 
†Equation (6) is proved by invoking the mean value theorem; see, e.g., Principles of Mathematical Analysis, 3rd ed., 
by Walter Rudin (McGraw-Hill, New York, 1976).

Section 8.1    Introduction: The Taylor Polynomial Approximation           425
sine, and cosine functions in Example 1 all satisfy linear differential equations with constant 
coefficients, and their Taylor series converge to the corresponding function values. (Indeed, 
all their derivatives are bounded on any interval of finite length, so the Lagrange formula for 
their approximation errors approaches zero as n increases, for each value of x.) This topic is the 
theme for the early sections of this chapter.
In Sections 8.5 and 8.6 we’ll see that solutions to second-order linear equations can exhibit 
very wild behavior near points x0 where the coefficient of y″ is zero; so wild, in fact, that no 
Euler or Runge–Kutta algorithm could hope to keep up with them. But a clever modification 
of the Taylor polynomial method, due to Frobenius, provides very accurate approximations to 
the solutions in such regions. It is this latter feature, perhaps, that underscores the value of the 
Taylor methodology in the current practice of applied mathematics.
In Problems 1–8, determine the first three nonzero terms in 
the Taylor polynomial approximations for the given initial 
value problem.

14.	 Soft versus Hard Springs.  For Duffing’s equa-
tion given in Problem 13, the behavior of the solutions 
changes as r changes sign. When r 7 0, the restoring 
force ky + ry3 becomes stronger than for the linear spring 
1r = 02. Such a spring is called hard. When r 6 0, the 
restoring force becomes weaker than the linear spring and 
the spring is called soft. Pendulums act like soft springs.

The differential equations studied in earlier sections often possessed solutions y1x2 that could 
be written in terms of elementary functions such as polynomials, exponentials, sines, and 
cosines. However, many important equations arise whose solutions cannot be so expressed.  
In the previous chapters, when we encountered such an equation we either settled for express-
ing the solution as an integral (see Exercises 2.2, Problem 27, page 46) or as a numerical 
approximation (Sections 3.6, 3.7, and 5.3). However, the Taylor polynomial approximation 
scheme of the preceding section suggests another possibility. Suppose the differential equation 
(and initial conditions) permit the computation of every derivative y1n2 at the expansion point 
x0. Are there any conditions that would guarantee that the sequence of Taylor polynomials 
would converge to the solution y1x2 as the degree of the polynomials tends to infinity:

In other words, when can we be sure that a solution to a differential equation is represented 
by its Taylor series? As we’ll see, the answer is quite favorable, and it enables a powerful new 
technique for solving equations.
The most efficient way to begin an exploration of this issue is by investigating the alge-
braic and convergence properties of generic expressions that include Taylor series—“long 
polynomials” so to speak, or more conventionally, power series.

But what about convergence for other values of x? As stated in the following Theorem 1, a 
power series of the form (1) converges for all values of x in some “interval” centered at x0 and 
diverges for x outside this interval. Moreover, at the interior points of this interval, the power 
series converges absolutely in the sense that Σ∞
n = 00 an1x - x02n0  converges. [Recall that abso-
lute convergence of a series implies (ordinary) convergence of the series.]
Ratio Test for Power Series
Theorem 2.	
If, for n large, the coefficients an are nonzero and satisfy
lim
nS∞` an
an+1
` = L  10 … L … ∞2 ,
then the radius of convergence of the power series Σ∞
n = 0 an1x - x02n is r = L.
Radius of Convergence
Theorem 1.	
For each power series of the form (1), there is a number r 10 … r … ∞2, 
called the radius of convergence of the power series, such that (1) converges absolutely 
for 0 x - x00 6 r and diverges for 0 x - x00 7 r. (See Figure 8.2.)
If the series (1) converges for all values of x, then r = ∞. When the series (1) 
converges only at x0, then r = 0.
Notice that Theorem 1 settles the question of convergence except at the endpoints x0 { r. 
Thus, these two points require separate analysis. To determine the radius of convergence r, one 
method that is often easy to apply is the ratio test.

Remark.  We caution that if the ratio 0 an>an+10  does not have a limit, then methods other 
than the ratio test (e.g., root test) must be used to determine r. In particular, if infinitely many 
of the an’s are zero, then the ratio test cannot be directly applied. (However, Problem 7 demon-
strates how to apply the result for series containing only “even-order” or “odd-order” terms.)

Power Series Vanishing on an Interval
Theorem 3.	 If Σ∞
n = 0 an1x - x02n = 0 for all x in some open interval, then each 
coefficient an equals zero.

By the ratio test, the radius of convergence is r = 1>2. Hence, the series (2) converges abso-
lutely for 0 x - 30 6 1>2 and diverges when 0 x - 30 7 1>2. It remains only to determine what 
happens when 0 x - 30 = 1>2, that is, when x = 5>2 and x = 7>2.
Set x = 5>2, and the series (2) becomes the harmonic series Σ∞
n = 0 1n + 12-1, which is 
known to diverge. When x = 7>2, the series (2) becomes an alternating harmonic series, 
which is known to converge. Thus, the power series converges for each x in the half-open inter-
val 15>2, 7>24; outside this interval it diverges.  ◆
For each value of x for which the power series Σ∞
n = 0 an 1x - x02n converges, we get a 
number that is the sum of the series. It is appropriate to denote this sum by f1x2, since its value 
depends on the choice of x. Thus, we write
f1x2 = a
∞
n = 0
 an1x - x02n
for all numbers x in the convergence interval. For example, the geometric series Σ∞
n = 0 xn has 
the radius of convergence r = 1 and the sum function f1x2 = 1>11 - x2; that is,
(3)

In this chapter we’ll frequently appeal to the following basic property of power series.
Given two power series
(4)	
f1x2 = a
∞
n = 0
 an1x - x02n ,  g1x2 = a
∞
n = 0
 bn1x - x02n ,
with nonzero radii of convergence, we want to find power series representations for the sum, 
product, and quotient of the functions f1x2 and g1x2. The sum is simply obtained by termwise 
addition:
f1x2 + g1x2 = a
∞
n = 0
1an + bn21x - x02n
for all x in the common interval of convergence of the power series in (4). The power series 
representation for the product f1x2g1x2 is a bit more complicated. To provide motivation for 

Section 8.2    Power Series and Analytic Functions          429
the formula, we treat the power series for f1x2 and g1x2 as “long polynomials,” apply the dis-
tributive law, and group the terms in powers of 1x - x02:
3a0 + a11x - x02 + a21x - x022 + g4 # 3b0 + b11x - x02 + b21x - x022 + g4
      = a0b0 + 1a0b1 + a1b021x - x02 + 1a0b2 + a1b1 + a2b021x - x022 + g .
The general formula for the product is

where

The power series in (5) is called the Cauchy product, and it will converge for all x in the 
common open interval of convergence for the power series of f and g.†
The quotient f1x2>g1x2 will also have a power series expansion about x0, provided 
g1x02 ≠0. However, the radius of convergence for this quotient series may be smaller than 
that for f1x2 or g1x2. Unfortunately, there is no nice formula for obtaining the coefficients 
in the power series for f1x2>g1x2. However, we can use the Cauchy product to divide power 
series indirectly (see Problem 15 on page 434). The quotient series can also be obtained by 
formally carrying out polynomial long division (see Problem 16).
The next theorem explains, in part, why power series are so useful.
Differentiation and Integration of Power Series
Theorem 4.	
If the series f1x2 = Σ∞
n = 0 an1x - x02n has a positive radius of conver-
gence r, then f is differentiable in the interval 0 x - x00 6 r and termwise differentiation 
gives the power series for the derivative:
f′1x2 = a
∞
n = 1
 nan1x - x02n-1  for  0 x - x00 6 r .
Furthermore, termwise integration gives the power series for the integral of f:
L
f1x2dx = a
∞
n = 0
 an
n + 1
 1x - x02n+1 + C for 0 x - x00 6 r .
†Actually, it may happen that the radius of convergence of the power series for f1x2g1x2 or f1x2 + g1x2 is larger 
than that for the power series of f or g.
Example 2
Starting with the geometric series (3) for 1>11 - x2, find a power series for each of the follow-
ing functions:
(a)	
1
1 + x2 .    (b)	
1
11 - x22 .
(c)	 arctan x.
Solution
(a)	 Replacing x by -x2 in (3) immediately gives
(7)	
1
1 + x2 = 1 - x2 + x4 - x6 + g + 1-12nx2n + g .

430          Chapter 8    Series Solutions of Differential Equations
(b)	 Notice that 1>11 - x22 is the derivative of the function f1x2 = 1>11 - x2. Hence, 
on differentiating (3) term by term, we obtain
(8)	
f′1x2 =
1
11 - x22 = 1 + 2x + 3x2 + 4x3 + g + nxn-1 + g .
(c)	 Since
arctan x =
L
x
0
1
1 + t2 dt ,
we can integrate the series in (7) termwise to obtain the series for arctan x. Thus,
L

It is important to keep in mind that since the geometric series (3) has the (open) interval 
of convergence 1 -1, 12, the representations (7), (8), and (9) are at least valid in this interval. 
[Actually, the series (9) for arctan x converges for all 0 x0 … 1.]
Shifting the Summation Index
The index of summation in a power series is a dummy index just like the variable of integration 
in a definite integral. Hence,
a
∞
n = 0
 an1x - x02n = a
∞
k = 0
 ak1x - x02k = a
∞
i = 0
 ai1x - x02i .
Just as there are times when we want to change the variable of integration, there are situa-
tions (and we will encounter many in this chapter) when it is desirable to change or shift the 
index of summation. This is particularly important when one has to combine two different 
power series.
Example 3
Express the series
a
∞
n = 2
 n1n - 12an xn-2
as a series where the generic term is xk instead of xn-2.
Solution
Writing out a few terms of the series, we have
a
∞
n = 2
 n1n - 12an xn-2
= 2 # 1a2 x2-2 + 3 # 2a3 x3-2 + 4 # 3a4 x4-2 + 5 # 4a5 x5-2 + 6 # 5a6 x6-2 + g
= 2 # 1a2 x0
+ 3 # 2a3 x1
+ 4 # 3a4 x2
+ 5 # 4a5 x3
+ 6 # 5a6 x4
+ g .
Relabeling the terms by the exponents of x, we get
a
∞
k = 0
 1k + 221k + 12ak+2 xk
In effect we have implemented the change of variables k = n - 2, or n = k + 2; thus when 
n = 2, then k = 0.  ◆

Section 8.2    Power Series and Analytic Functions          431
We employ this technique for changing indices in the next two examples.
Example 4
Show that
x3 a
∞
n = 0
 n21n - 22an xn = a
∞
n = 3
1n - 3221n - 52an-3
 xn .
Solution
We start by taking the x3 inside the summation on the left-hand side:
x3 a
∞
n = 0
 n21n - 22an xn = a
∞
n = 0
 n21n - 22an xn+3 .
To rewrite this with generic term xk, we set k = n + 3. Thus n = k - 3, and n = 0 corre-
sponds to k = 3. Straightforward substitution thus yields
a
∞
n = 0
 n21n - 22an xn+3 = a
∞
k = 3
1k - 3221k - 52ak-3
 xk .
By replacing k by n, we obtain the desired form.  ◆
Example 5
Show that the identity
a
∞
n = 1
 nan-1xn-1 + a
∞
n = 2
 bn xn+1 = 0
implies that a0 = a1 = a2 = 0 and an = -bn-1>1n + 12 for n Ú 3.
Solution
First, we rewrite both series in terms of xk. For the first series, we set k = n - 1, and hence 
n = k + 1, to write
a
∞
n = 1
 nan-1xn-1 = a
∞
k = 0
1k + 12ak xk .
Then with k = n + 1, n = k - 1, the second series becomes
a
∞
n = 2
 bn xn+1 = a
∞
k = 3
 bk-1xk .
The identity thus states
a
∞
k = 0
1k + 12ak xk + a
∞
k = 3
 bk-1xk = 0 ,
and so we have a power series that sums to zero; consequently, by Theorem 3, each of its coef-
ficients equals zero. For k = 3, 4, . . . , both series contribute to the coefficient of xk, and thus 
we confirm that
1k + 12ak + bk-1 = 0
or ak = -bk-1>1k + 12 for k Ú 3. For k = 0, 1, or 2, only the first series contributes, and we 
find, in turn,
10 + 12a0 = 0 ,
11 + 12a1 = 0 ,
12 + 12a2 = 0 .
Hence, a0 = a1 = a2 = 0.  ◆

Analytic Functions
Not all functions are expressible as power series. Those distinguished functions that can be so 
represented are called analytic.
Analytic Function
Definition 1.	 A function f is said to be analytic at x0 if, in an open interval about x0, 
this function is the sum of a power series Σ∞
n = 0 an1x - x02n that has a positive radius of 
convergence.
For example, a polynomial function b0 + b1x + g + bn xn is analytic at every x0, since 
we can always rewrite it in the form a0 + a11x - x02 + g + an1x - x02n. A rational func-
tion P1x2>Q1x2, where P1x2 and Q1x2 are polynomials without a common factor, is an ana-
lytic function except at those x0 for which Q1x02 = 0. As you may recall from calculus, the 
elementary functions ex, sin x, and cos x are analytic for all x, while ln x is analytic for x 7 0. 
Some familiar representations are

where (10), (11), and (12) are valid for all x, whereas (13) is valid for x in the half-open interval 
10, 24.
From Theorem 4 on the differentiation of power series, we see that a function f analytic 
at x0 is differentiable in a neighborhood of x0. Moreover, because f′ has a power series rep-
resentation in this neighborhood, it too is analytic at x0. Repeating this argument, we see that 
f ″, f 132, etc., exist and are analytic at x0. Consequently, if a function does not have derivatives 
of all orders at x0, then it cannot be analytic at x0. The function f1x2 = 0 x - 10  is not analytic 
at x0 = 1 because f′112 does not exist; and f1x2 = x7>3 is not analytic at x0 = 0 because 
f ‴102 does not exist.
Now we can deduce something very specific about the possible power series that can rep-
resent an analytic function. If f1x2 is analytic at x0, then (by definition) it is the sum of some 
power series that converges in a neighborhood of x0:
f1x2 = a
∞
n = 0
 an1x - x02n .

Section 8.2    Power Series and Analytic Functions          433
By the reasoning in the previous paragraph, the derivatives of f have convergent power series 
representations
 f′1x2 = a

 n1n - 12 g1n - 3j - 142an1x - x02n-j ,
f
But if we evaluate these series at x = x0, we learn that
 f1x02 = a0 ,
 f′1x02 = 1 # a1 ,
 f″1x02 = 2 # 1 # a2 ,
f
 f 1j21x02 = j! # aj ,
f
that is, aj = f 1j21x02>j! and the power series must coincide with the Taylor series†
a
∞
j = 0
 f 1j21x02
j!
 1x - x02j
about x0. Any power series—regardless of how it is derived—that converges in some neighbor-
hood of x0 to a function has to be the Taylor series of that function. For example, the expansion 
for arctan x given in (9) of Example 2 must be its Taylor expansion.
With these facts in mind we are ready to turn to the study of the effectiveness of power 
series techniques for solving differential equations. In the next sections, you will find it helpful 
to keep in mind that if f and g are analytic at x0, then so are f + g, cf, fg, and f>g if g1x02 ≠0. 
These facts follow from the algebraic properties of power series discussed earlier.
†When the expansion point x0 is zero, the Taylor series is also known as the Maclaurin series.
In Problems 1–6, determine the convergence set of the given 
power series.

In this section we demonstrate a method for obtaining a power series solution to a linear differ-
ential equation with polynomial coefficients. This method is easier to use than the Taylor series 
method discussed in Section 8.1 and sometimes gives a nice expression for the general term in 
the power series expansion. Knowing the form of the general term also allows us to test for the 
radius of convergence of the power series.
We begin by writing the linear differential equation
(1)	
a21x2y″ + a11x2y′ + a01x2y = 0
in the standard form
(2)	
y″ + p1x2y′ + q1x2y = 0 ,

Ordinary and Singular Points
Definition 2.	 A point x0 is called an ordinary point of equation (2) if both p and q are 
analytic at x0. If x0 is not an ordinary point, it is called a singular point of the equation.
Example 1
Determine all the singular points of
xy″ + x11 - x2-1y′ + 1sin x2y = 0 .
Solution
Dividing the equation by x, we find that
p1x2 =
x
x11 - x2 ,  q1x2 = sin x
x  .
The singular points are those points where p1x2 or q1x2 fails to be analytic. Observe that 
p1x2 and q1x2 are the ratios of functions that are everywhere analytic. Hence, p1x2 and q1x2 
are analytic except, perhaps, when their denominators are zero. For p1x2 this occurs at x = 0 
and x = 1. But since we can cancel an x in the numerator and denominator of p1x2, that is,
p1x2 =
x
x11 - x2 =
1
1 - x ,
we see that p1x2 is actually analytic at x = 0.† Therefore, p1x2 is analytic except at x = 1. 
For q1x2, the denominator is zero at x = 0. Just as with p1x2, this zero is removable since 
q1x2 has the power series expansion
q1x2 = sin x
x
=
x - x3
3! + x5
5! - g
x
= 1 - x2
3! + x4
5! - g .
Thus, q1x2 is everywhere analytic. Consequently, the only singular point of the given equation 
is x = 1.  ◆
At an ordinary point x0 of equation (1) (or (2)), the coefficient functions p1x2 and q1x2 
are analytic. Hence, we might expect that the solutions to these equations inherit this property. 
From the discussion in Section 6.1 on linear equations, the continuity of p and q in a neigh-
borhood of x0 is sufficient to imply that equation (2) has two linearly independent solutions 
defined in that neighborhood. But analytic functions are not merely continuous—they possess 
derivatives of all orders in a neighborhood of x0. Thus we can differentiate equation (2) to show 
that y132 exists and, by a “bootstrap” argument, prove that solutions to (2) must likewise pos-
sess derivatives of all orders. Although we cannot conclude by this reasoning that the solutions 
enjoy the stronger property of analyticity, this is nonetheless the case (see Theorem 5 in 
Section 8.4, page 445). Hence, in a neighborhood of an ordinary point x0, the solutions to (1) 
(or (2)) can be expressed as a power series about x0.
To illustrate the power series method about an ordinary point, let’s look at a simple 
first-order linear differential equation.
†Such points are called removable singularities. In this chapter we assume in such cases that the function has been 
defined (or redefined) so that it is analytic at the point.

Example 2
Find a power series solution about x = 0 to
(3)	
y′ + 2xy = 0 .
Solution
The coefficient of y is the polynomial 2x, which is analytic everywhere, so x = 0 is an ordi-
nary point† of equation (3). Thus, we expect to find a power series solution of the form
(4)	
y1x2 = a0 + a1x + a2 x2 + g = a
∞
n = 0
 an xn .
Our task is to determine the coefficients an.
For this purpose we need the expansion for y′1x2 that is given by termwise differentiation 
of (4):
y′1x2 = 0 + a1 + 2a2 x + 3a3 x2 + g = a
∞
n = 0
 nan xn-1 .
We now substitute the series expansions for y and y′ into (3) and obtain
a
∞
n = 0
 nan xn-1 + 2x a

n = 0
 an xn = 0 ,
which simplifies to
(5)	
a
∞
n = 0
 nan xn-1 + a
∞
n = 0
 2an xn+1 = 0 .
To add the two power series in (5), we add the coefficients of like powers of x. If we write out 
the first few terms of these summations and add, we get
	
 1a1 + 2a2 x + 3a3 x2 + 4a4 x3 + g2 + 12a0 x + 2a1 x2 + 2a2 x3 + g2 = 0 ,
(6)	
 a1 + 12a2 + 2a02x + 13a3 + 2a12x2 + 14a4 + 2a22x3 + g = 0 .
For the power series on the left-hand side of equation (6) to be identically zero, we must have 
all the coefficients equal to zero. Thus,
 a1 = 0 ,
 2a2 + 2a0 = 0 ,
 3a3 + 2a1 = 0 ,   4a4 + 2a2 = 0 ,        etc.
Solving the preceding system, we find
a1 = 0 ,  a2 = -a0 ,  a3 = - 2
3
 a1 = 0 ,
a4 = - 1
2
  a2 = - 1
2
 1-a02 = 1
2
 a0 .
Hence, the power series for the solution takes the form
(7)	
y1x2 = a0 - a0 x2 + 1
2
  a0 x4 + g .
Although the first few terms displayed in (7) are useful, it is sometimes advantageous to 
have a formula for the general term in the power series expansion for the solution. To achieve 
this goal, let’s return to equation (5). This time, instead of just writing out a few terms, let’s 
†By an ordinary point of a first-order equation y′ + q1x2y = 0, we mean a point where q1x2 is analytic.

shift the indices in the two power series so that they sum over the same powers of x, say, xk. To 
do this we shift the index in the first summation in (5) by letting k = n - 1. Then n = k + 1 
and k = 0 when n = 1. Hence, the first summation in (5) becomes
(8)	
a
∞
n = 0
 nan xn-1 = a
∞
k = 0
 1k + 12ak+1 xk .
In the second summation of (5), we put k = n + 1 so that n = k - 1 and k = 1 when n = 0. 
This gives

Since the first summation in (10) begins at k = 0 and the second at k = 1, we break up the 
first into
a
∞
k = 0
 1k + 12ak+1
 xk = a1 + a
∞
k = 0

 xk .
Then (10) becomes
(11)	
a1 + a
∞
k = 1
31k + 12ak+1 + 2ak-14xk = 0 .
When we set all the coefficients in (11) equal to zero, we find
a1 = 0 ,
and, for all k Ú 1,
(12)	
1k + 12ak+1 + 2ak-1 = 0 .
Equation (12) is a recurrence relation that we can use to determine the coefficient ak+1 in 
terms of ak-1; that is,
ak+1 = -

Setting k = 1, 2, . . . , 8 and using the fact that a1 = 0, we find

Substituting back into the expression (4), we obtain the power series solution

y1x2 = a0 - a0 x2 + 1

n = 0

Since a0 is left undetermined, it serves as an arbitrary constant, and hence (13) gives a general 
solution to equation (3).  ◆
Applying the ratio test as described in Problem 7, Exercises 8.2 (page 434), we can verify 
that the power series in (13) has radius of convergence r = ∞. Moreover, (13) is reminiscent 
of the expansion for the exponential function; you can check that it converges to
y1x2 = a0 e-x2 .
This general solution to the simple equation (3) can also be obtained by the method of separa-
tion of variables.
The convergence of the partial sums of (13), with a0 = 1, to the actual solution e-x2 is 
depicted in Figure 8.3. Notice that taking more terms results in better approximations around 
x = 0. Note also, however, that every partial sum is a polynomial and hence must diverge at 
x = { ∞, while e-x2 converges to zero, of course. Thus, each partial sum approximation even-
tually deteriorates for large 0 x0 . This is a typical feature of power series approximations.
In the next example we use the power series method to obtain a general solution to a linear 
second-order differential equation.

To simplify the addition of the three summations in (16), let’s shift the indices so that the general

n = 2
 2n1n - 12an xn-2 = a

In the second and third summations, we simply substitute k for n. With these changes of indi-

Next, we separate the x0 terms from the others and then combine the like powers of x in the 
three summations to get
4a2 + a0 + a

k = 1
 321k + 221k + 12ak+2 + kak + ak4xk = 0 .
Setting the coefficients of this power series equal to zero yields

4a2 + a0 = 0
and the recurrence relation
(18)	
21k + 221k + 12ak+2 + 1k + 12ak = 0 ,  k Ú 1 .
We can now use (17) and (18) to determine all the coefficients ak of the solution in terms of a0

Hence, a general solution to (14) is a0y11x2 + a1y21x2. Approximations to the solutions 
y11x2, y21x2 are depicted in Figure 8.4.  ◆
The method illustrated in Example 3 can also be used to solve initial value problems. 
Suppose we are given the values of y102 and y′102; then, from equation (15), we see that 
a0 = y102 and a1 = y′102. Knowing these two coefficients leads to a unique power series 
solution for the initial value problem.
The recurrence relation (18) in Example 3 involved just two of the coefficients, ak+2 and 
ak, and we were fortunate in being able to deduce from this relation the general form for the 
coefficient an. However, many cases arise that lead to more complicated two-term or even to 
many-term recurrence relations. When this occurs, it may be impossible to determine the gen-
eral form for the coefficients an. In the next example, we consider an equation that gives rise to 
a three-term recurrence relation.

Find the first few terms in a power series expansion about x = 0 for a general solution to

Solution
Since p1x2 = -11 + x22-1 and q1x2 = 11 + x22-1 are analytic at x = 0, then x = 0 is an 
ordinary point for equation (22). Hence, we can express its general solution in the form

Given specific values for a0 and a1, will the partial sums of the power series representation (28) 
yield useful approximations to the solution when x = 0.5? What about when x = 2.3 or x = 7.8? 
The answers to these questions certainly depend on the radius of convergence of the power series in 
(28). But since we were not able to determine a general form for the coefficients an in this example, 
we cannot use the ratio test (or other methods such as the root test, integral test, or comparison test) 
to compute the radius r. In the next section we remedy this situation by giving a simple procedure 
that determines a lower bound for the radius of convergence of power series solutions.

its spring “constant” decreases. Suppose the spring 
is heated so that the spring “constant” at time t is 
k(t) = 6 - t N/m (see Figure 8.6). If the unforced 
mass–spring system has mass m = 2 kg and a damping 
constant b = 1 N-sec/m with initial conditions x102 = 3 m 
and x′102 = 0 m/sec, then the displacement x1t2 is 
governed by the initial value problem

x102 = 3 ,  x′102 = 0 .
Find at least the first four nonzero terms in a power 
series expansion about t = 0 for the displacement.
In Section 8.3 we introduced a method for obtaining a power series solution about an ordinary 
point. In this section we continue the discussion of this procedure. We begin by stating a basic 
existence theorem for the equation
(1)	
y″1x2 + p1x2y′1x2 + q1x2y1x2 = 0 ,
which justifies the power series method.
8.4  Equations with Analytic Coefficients
The key element in the proof of Theorem 5 is the construction of a convergent geometric 
series that dominates the series expansion (2) of a solution to equation (1). The convergence of 
the series in (2) then follows by the comparison test. The details of the proof can be found in 
more advanced books on differential equations.†
As we saw in Section 8.3, the power series method gives us a general solution in the 
same form as (2), with a0 and a1 as arbitrary constants. The two linearly independent solutions 
referred to in Theorem 5 can be obtained by taking a0 = 1, a1 = 0 for the first and a0 = 0, 
a1 = 1 for the second. Thus, we can extend Theorem 5 by saying that equation (1) has a gen-
eral solution of the form (2) with a0 and a1 as the arbitrary constants.
†See, for example, Ordinary Differential Equations, 4th ed., by G. Birkhoff and G.-C. Rota (Wiley, New York, 1989).

The second part of Theorem 5 gives a simple way of determining a minimum value 
for the radius of convergence of the power series. We need only find the singular points of 
equation (1) and then determine the distance between the ordinary point x0 and the nearest 
singular point.
Example 1
Find a minimum value for the radius of convergence of a power series solution about x = 0 to
(3)	
2y″ + xy′ + y = 0 .
Solution
For this equation, p1x2 = x>2 and q1x2 = 1>2. Both of these functions are analytic for all 
real or complex values of x. Since equation (3) has no singular points, the distance between 
the ordinary point x = 0 and the nearest singular point is infinite. Hence, the radius of conver-
gence is infinite.  ◆
The next example helps to answer the questions posed at the end of the last section.
Example 2
Find a minimum value for the radius of convergence of a power series solution about x = 0 to
(4)	
11 + x22y″ - y′ + y = 0 .
Solution
Here p1x2 = -1>11 + x22, q1x2 = 1>11 + x22, and so the singular points of equation (4) 
occur when 1 + x2 = 0; that is, when x = { 1-1 = {i. Since the only singular points of 
equation (4) are the complex numbers {i, we see that x = 0 is an ordinary point. Moreover, 
the distance† from 0 to either {i is 1. Thus, the radius of convergence of a power series solu-
tion about x = 0 is at least 1.  ◆
In equation (28) of Section 8.3, page 443, we found the first few terms of a power 
series solution to equation (4). Because we now know that this series has radius of conver-
gence at least 1, the partial sums of this series will converge to the solution for 0 x0 6 1. 
However, when 0 x0 Ú 1, we have no basis on which to decide whether we can use the series 
to approximate the solution.
Power series expansions about x0 = 0 are somewhat easier to manipulate than expansions 
about nonzero points. As the next example shows, a simple shift in variable enables us always 
to expand about the origin.
Example 3
Find the first few terms in a power series expansion about x = 1 for a general solution to
(5)	
2y″ + xy′ + y = 0 .
Also determine the radius of convergence of the series.
Solution
As seen in Example 1, there are no singular points for equation (5). Thus, x = 1 is an ordinary 
point, and, as a consequence of Theorem 5, equation (5) has a general solution of the form
(6)	
y1x2 = a
∞
n = 0
 an1x - 12n .
Moreover, the radius of convergence of the series in (6) must be infinite.
†Recall that the distance between the two complex numbers z = a + bi and w = c + di is given by 
21a - c22 + 1b - d22.

We can simplify the computation of the coefficients an by shifting the center of the expan-
sion (6) from x0 = 1 to t0 = 0. This is accomplished by the substitution x = t + 1. Setting 
Y1t2 = y1t + 12, we find via the chain rule
dy
dx = dY
dt  ,  d2y
dx2 = d2Y
dt2  ,
and, hence, equation (5) is changed into
(7)	
2 d2Y
dt2 + 1t + 12  dY
dt + Y = 0 .
We now seek a general solution of the form
(8)	
Y1t2 = a
∞
n = 0
 an tn ,
where the an’s in equations (6) and (8) are the same. Proceeding as usual, we substitute the 
power series for Y1t2 into (7), derive a recurrence relation for the coefficients, and ultimately 
find that
Y1t2 = a0 e1 - 1

When the coefficients of a linear equation are not polynomials in x, but are analytic 
functions, we can still find analytic solutions by essentially the same method.

(10)	
y″1x2 + e x y′1x2 + 11 + x22y1x2 = 0 ;  y102 = 1 ,  y′102 = 0 .
Solution
Here p1x2 = e x and q1x2 = 1 + x2, and both are analytic for all x. Thus, by Theorem 5, the 
initial value problem (10) has a power series solution
(11)	
y1x2 = a

p1x2 = e x in its Maclaurin series:

3! + g .
Substituting the expansions for y1x2, y′1x2, y″1x2, and ex into (10) gives

Grouping the like powers of x in equation (13) (for example, the x2 terms are shown in color) 
and then setting the coefficients equal to zero yields the system of equations
 2a2 + a1 + a0 = 0  1x0 term2 ,
 6a3 + 2a2 + 2a1 = 0  1x1 term2 ,
 12a4 + 3a3 + 3a2 + 1

24
 a1 = 0  1x4 term2 .
The initial conditions in (10) imply that y102 = a0 = 1 and y′102 = a1 = 0. Using these 
values for a0 and a1, we can solve the above system first for a2, then a3, and so on:
 2a2 + 0 + 1 = 0 1 a2 = - 1

 6a3 - 1 + 0 = 0 1 a3 = 1

Thus far we have used the power series method only for homogeneous equations. But the 
same method applies, with obvious modifications, to nonhomogeneous equations of the form
(15)	
y″1x2 + p1x2y′1x2 + q1x2y1x2 = g1x2 ,
provided the forcing term g1x2 and the coefficient functions are analytic at x0. For example, to 
find a power series about x = 0 for a general solution to
(16)	
y″1x2 - xy′1x2 - y1x2 = sin x ,
we use the substitution y1x2 = Σ an xn to obtain a power series expansion for the left-hand

30.	 Aging Spring.  As a spring ages, its spring “constant” 
decreases in value. One such model for a mass–spring 
system with an aging spring is
mx″1t2 + bx′1t2 + ke-h tx1t2 = 0 ,
where m is the mass, b the damping constant, k and h 
positive constants, and x1t2 the displacement of the 
spring from its equilibrium position. Let m = 1 kg, 
b = 2 N-sec/m, k = 1 N/m, and h = 11sec2-1. The 
system is set in motion by displacing the mass 1 m 
from its equilibrium position and then releasing it 
1x102 = 1, x′102 = 02. Find at least the first four non-
zero terms in a power series expansion about t = 0 for

spring system for an aging spring discussed in Problem 30,

and k = 1. To see the effect of aging, consider h as a

In the previous sections we considered methods for obtaining power series solutions about an 
ordinary point for a linear second-order equation. However, in certain cases we may want a 
series expansion about a singular point of the equation. To motivate a procedure for finding such 
expansions, we consider the class of Cauchy–Euler equations. In Section 4.7 we studied this 
topic briefly. Here we will use the operator approach to rederive and extend our conclusions.
A second-order homogeneous Cauchy–Euler equation has the form
(1)	
ax2y″1x2 + bxy′1x2 + cy1x2 = 0 ,  x + 0 ,
8.5  Cauchy–Euler (Equidimensional) Equations

Section 8.5    Cauchy–Euler (Equidimensional) Equations          451
where a 1 ≠02, b, and c are (real) constants. Since here p1x2 = b>1ax2 and q1x2 = c>1ax22, 
it follows that x = 0 is a singular point for (1).
Equation (1) has solutions of the form y = xr. To determine the values for r, we can proceed 
as follows. Let L be the differential operator defined by the left-hand side of equation (1), that is,
(2)	
L3y41x2 J ax2y″1x2 + bxy′1x2 + cy1x2 ,
and set
(3)	
w1r, x2 J xr .
When we substitute w1r, x2 for y1x2 in (2), we find
 L3w41x2 = ax2r1r - 12xr-2 + bxrxr-1 + cxr
 = {ar2 + 1b - a2r + c}xr .
From this, we see that w = xr is a solution to (1) if and only if r satisfies
(4)	
ar2 + 1b −a2r + c = 0 .
This equation is referred to as the characteristic, or indicial, equation for (1).
When the indicial equation has two distinct roots, we have
L3w41x2 = a1r - r121r - r22xr ,
from which it follows that equation (1) has the two solutions
(5)	
y11x2 = w1r1, x2 = xr1 ,  x 7 0 ,
(6)	
y21x2 = w1r2, x2 = xr2 ,  x 7 0 ,
which are linearly independent.
When r1 and r2 are complex conjugates, a { ib, we can use Euler’s formula to express
 xa+ib = e1a+ib2ln x = ea lnx cos1b ln x2 + iea ln x sin1b ln x2
 = xa cos1b ln x2 + ixa sin1b ln x2 .
Since the real and imaginary parts of xa+ib must also be solutions to (1), we can replace (5)  
and (6) by the two linearly independent real-valued solutions
y11x2 = xa cos1b ln x2 ,  y21x2 = xa sin1b ln x2 .
If the indicial equation (4) has a repeated real root r0, then it turns out that xr0 and xr0 ln x are 
two linearly independent solutions. This can be deduced using the reduction of order approach 
of Section 4.7. However, it is more instructive for later applications to see how these two linearly 
independent solutions can be obtained via the operator approach. If r0 is a repeated root, then
(7)	
L3w41x2 = a1r - r022xr .
Setting r = r0 gives the solution
(8)	
y11x2 = w1r0, x2 = xr0 ,  x 7 0 .
To find a second linearly independent solution, we make the following observation. The right-
hand side of (7) has the factor 1r - r022, so taking the partial derivative of (7) with respect to r 
and setting r = r0, we get zero. That is,
(9)

 5L3w41x26 `
r=r0
= 5a1r - r022xr ln x + 2a1r - r02xr6 `
r=r0
= 0 .
While it may not appear that we have made any progress toward finding a second solution, a 
closer look at the expression on the left in (9) will soon vindicate our efforts.

First note that w1r, x2 = xr has continuous partial derivatives of all orders with respect to 
both r and x. Hence, the mixed partial derivatives are equal:
03w
0r 0x2 =
03w
0x2 0r ,    02w
0r 0x = 02w
0x 0r .
Consequently, for the differential operator L, we have

that is, the operators 0>0r and L commute. With this fact, (9) can be written as

Thus for the case of a repeated root r0, a second linearly independent solution to (1) is

Solution
Let w1r, x2 = xr and let L denote the left-hand side of (11). A short calculation gives
L3w41x2 = 14r2 - 4r + 12xr .
Solving the indicial equation
4r2 - 4r + 1 = 12r - 122 = 4 ar - 1

yields the repeated root r0 = 1>2. Thus, a general solution to (11) is obtained from equations 
(8) and (10) by setting r0 = 1>2. That is,
y1x2 = C11x + C21x ln x ,  x 7 0 .  ◆
In closing we note that the solutions to Cauchy–Euler equations can exhibit some extraor-
dinary features near their singular points—features unlike anything we have encountered in the 
case of constant coefficient equations. Observe that:
1.	 xr and xr ln x, for 0 6 r 6 1, have infinite slope at the origin;
2.	 xr, for r 6 0, grows without bound near the origin; and
3.	 xa cos1b ln x2 and xa sin1b ln x2 oscillate “infinitely rapidly” near the origin. (See 
Figure 8.7 on page 453.)

Section 8.5    Cauchy–Euler (Equidimensional) Equations          453
Numerical solvers based on Euler or Runge–Kutta procedures would be completely frustrated 
in trying to chart such behavior; analytic methods are essential for characterizing solutions 
near singular points.
In Section 8.7 we discuss the problem of finding a second linearly independent series 
solution to certain differential equations. As we will see, operator methods similar to those 
described in this section will lead to the desired second solution.

454          Chapter 8    Series Solutions of Differential Equations
In the previous section we showed that a homogeneous Cauchy–Euler equation has a solution 
of the form y1x2 = xr, x 7 0, where r is a certain constant. Cauchy–Euler equations have, of 
course, a very special form with only one singular point (at x = 0). In this section we show 
how the theory for Cauchy–Euler equations generalizes to other equations that have a special 
type of singularity.
To motivate the procedure, let’s rewrite the Cauchy–Euler equation,
(1)	
ax2y″1x2 + bxy′1x2 + cy1x2 = 0 ,  x 7 0 ,
in the standard form
(2)	
y″1x2 + p1x2y′1x2 + q1x2y1x2 = 0 ,  x 7 0 ,
where
p1x2 = p0
x  ,  q1x2 = q0
x2 ,
and p0, q0 are the constants b>a and c>a, respectively. When we substitute w1r, x2 = xr for y 
into equation (2), we get
3r1r - 12 + p0r + q04xr-2 = 0 ,
which yields the indicial equation
(3)	
r1r - 12 + p0r + q0 = 0 .
Thus, if r1 is a root of (3), then w1r1, x2 = xr1 is a solution to equations (1) and (2).
Let’s now assume, more generally, that (2) is an equation for which xp1x2 and x2q1x2, 
instead of being constants, are analytic functions. That is, in some open interval about 
x = 0,
(4)	
 xp1x2 = p0 + p1
 x + p2
 x2 + g = a
∞
n = 0
 pn
 xn ,
(5)	
 x2q1x2 = q0 + q1
 x + q2
 x2 + g = a
∞
n = 0
 qn
 xn .
It follows from (4) and (5) that
(6)	
lim
xS0 xp1x2 = p0  and  lim
xS0 x2q1x2 = q0 ,
and hence, for x near 0 we have xp1x2 ≈p0 and x2q1x2 ≈q0. Therefore, it is reasonable to 
expect that the solutions to (2) will behave (for x near 0) like the solutions to the Cauchy–Euler 
equation
x2y″ + p0 xy′ + q0 y = 0 .
When p1x2 and q1x2 satisfy (4) and (5), we say that the singular point at x = 0 is regular. 
More generally, we state the following.
8.6  Method of Frobenius

Section 8.6    Method of Frobenius          455
Regular Singular Point
Definition 3.	 A singular point x0 of
(7)	
y″1x2 + p1x2y′1x2 + q1x2y1x2 = 0
is said to be a regular singular point if both 1x - x02p1x2 and 1x - x022q1x2 are analytic 
at x0.† Otherwise x0 is called an irregular singular point.
†In the terminology of complex variables, p has a pole of order at most 1, and q has a pole of order at most 2, at x0.
‡Historical Footnote: George Frobenius (1848–1917) developed this method in 1873. He is also known for his 
research on group theory.
Example 1
Classify the singular points of the equation
(8)	
1x2 - 122 y″1x2 + 1x + 12y′1x2 - y1x2 = 0 .
Solution
Here
p1x2 =
x + 1
1x2 - 122 =
1
1x + 121x - 122 ,
q1x2 =
-1
1x2 - 122 =
-1
1x + 1221x - 122 ,
from which we see that {1 are the singular points of (8). For the singularity at 1, we have
1x - 12p1x2 =
1
1x + 121x - 12 ,
which is not analytic at x = 1. Therefore, x = 1 is an irregular singular point.
For the singularity at -1, we have
1x + 12p1x2 =
1
1x - 122 ,  1x + 122q1x2 =
-1
1x - 122 ,
both of which are analytic at x = -1. Hence, x = -1 is a regular singular point.  ◆
Let’s assume that x = 0 is a regular singular point for equation (7) so that p1x2 and q1x2 
satisfy (4) and (5); that is,
(9)	
p1x2 = a
∞
n = 0
 pn xn-1 ,  q1x2 = a
∞
n = 0
 qn xn-2 .
The idea of the mathematician Frobenius was that since Cauchy–Euler equations have solu-
tions of the form xr, then for the regular singular point x = 0, there should be solutions to (7) 
of the form xr times an analytic function.‡ Hence we seek solutions to (7) of the form
(10)	
w1r, x2 = xr a
H
n=0
 an xn = a
H
n=0
 an xn+r ,  x + 0 .
In writing (10), we have assumed a0 is the first nonzero coefficient, so we are left with 
determining r and the coefficients an, n Ú 1. Differentiating w1r, x2 with respect to x, we have
(11)	
 w′1r, x2 = a
∞
n = 0
 1n + r2an xn+r-1 ,
(12)	
 w″1r, x2 = a
∞
n = 0
 1n + r21n + r - 12an xn+r-2 .

456          Chapter 8    Series Solutions of Differential Equations
If we substitute the above expansions for w1r, x2, w′1r, x2, w″1r, x2, p1x2, and q1x2 into (7), 
we obtain
(13)	
a
∞
n = 0

 1n + r2an xn+r-1≤
	
+ ¢ a

n = 0
 qn xn-2≤¢ a

n = 0
 an xn+r≤= 0 .
Now we use the Cauchy product to perform the series multiplications and then group like 
powers of x, starting with the lowest power, xr-2. This gives
(14)	
3r1r - 12 + p0
 r + q04a0 xr-2
	
+ 31r + 12ra1 + 1r + 12p0
 a1 + p1ra0 + q0
 a1 + q1a04xr-1 + g = 0 .
For the expansion on the left-hand side of equation (14) to sum to zero, each coefficient must 
be zero. Considering the first term, xr-2, we find
(15)	
3r1r - 12 + p0
 r + q04a0 = 0 .
We have assumed that a0 ≠0, so the quantity in brackets must be zero. This gives the indicial 
equation; it is the same as the one we derived for Cauchy–Euler equations.
Indicial Equation
Definition 4.	 If x0 is a regular singular point of y″ + py′ + qy = 0, then the indicial 
equation for this point is
(16)	
r1r −12 + p0 r + q0 = 0 ,
where
p0 J lim
xSx01x - x02p1x2 ,  q0 J lim
xSx01x - x022 q1x2 .
The roots of the indicial equation are called the exponents (indices) of the singularity x0.
Example 2
Find the indicial equation and the exponents at the singularity x = -1 of
(17)	
1x2 - 122 y″1x2 + 1x + 12y′1x2 - y1x2 = 0 .
Solution
In Example 1 we showed that x = -1 is a regular singular point. Since p1x2 =
1x + 12-11x - 12-2 and q1x2 = -1x + 12-2 1x - 12-2, we find
p0 = lim
xS-11x + 12p1x2 = lim
xS-11x - 12-2 = 1
4 ,
q0 = lim
xS-11x + 122 q1x2 = lim
xS-13 -1x - 12-24 = - 1
4 .
Substituting these values for p0 and q0 into (16), we obtain the indicial equation
(18)	
r1r - 12 + 1
4
 r - 1
4 = 0 .
Multiplying by 4 and factoring gives 14r + 121r - 12 = 0. Hence, r = 1, -1>4 are the 
exponents.  ◆

Section 8.6    Method of Frobenius          457
As we have seen, we can use the indicial equation to determine those values of r for which the 
coefficient of xr-2 in (14) is zero. If we set the coefficient of xr-1 in (14) equal to zero, we have
(19)	
31r + 12r + 1r + 12p0 + q04a1 + 1p1r + q12a0 = 0 .
Since a0 is arbitrary and we know the pi’s, qi’s, and r, we can solve equation (19) for a1, pro-
vided the coefficient of a1 in (19) is not zero. This will be the case if we take r to be the larger 
of the two roots of the indicial equation (see Problem 43, page 464).† Similarly, when we set 
the coefficient of xr equal to zero, we can solve for a2 in terms of the pi’s, qi’s, r, a0, and a1. 
Continuing in this manner, we can recursively solve for the an’s. The procedure is illustrated in 
the following example.
Example 3
Find a series expansion about the regular singular point x = 0 for a solution to
(20)	
1x + 22x2y″1x2 - xy′1x2 + 11 + x2y1x2 = 0 ,  x 7 0 .
Solution
Here p1x2 = -x-11x + 22-1 and q1x2 = x-21x + 22-111 + x2, so
p0 = lim
xS0
  xp1x2 = lim
xS0 3 -1x + 22-14 = - 1
2 ,
q0 = lim
xS0
  x2q1x2 = lim
xS0 1x + 22-111 + x2 = 1
2 .
Since x = 0 is a regular singular point, we seek a solution to (20) of the form
(21)	
w1r, x2 = xr a
∞
n = 0
 an xn = a
∞
n = 0
 an xn+r .
By the previous discussion, r must satisfy the indicial equation (16). Substituting for p0 and q0 
in (16), we obtain
r1r - 12 - 1
2
 r + 1
2 = 0 ,
which simplifies to 2r2 - 3r + 1 = 12r - 121r - 12 = 0. Thus, r = 1 and r = 1>2 are the 
roots of the indicial equation associated with x = 0.
Let’s use the larger root r = 1 and solve for a1, a2, etc., to obtain the solution w11, x2. We 
can simplify the computations by substituting w1r, x2 directly into equation (20), where the 
coefficients are polynomials in x, rather than dividing by 1x + 22x2 and having to work with 
the rational functions p1x2 and q1x2. Inserting w1r, x2 in (20) and recalling the formulas for 
w′1r, x2 and w″1r, x2 in (11) and (12) gives (with r = 1)

Next we shift the indices so that each summation in (23) is in powers xk. With k = n + 2 in the 
first and last summations and k = n + 1 in the rest, (23) becomes
(24)	
a

 31k - 121k - 22 + 14ak-2

k = 1
 32k1k - 12 - k + 14ak-1

Separating off the k = 1 term and combining the rest under one summation yields
(25)

∞
k = 2
 31k2 - 3k + 32ak-2 + 12k - 121k - 12ak-14xk = 0 .
Notice that the coefficient of x in (25) is zero. This is because r = 1 is a root of the indicial 
equation, which is the equation we obtained by setting the coefficient of the lowest power of x 
equal to zero.
We can now determine the ak’s in terms of a0 by setting the coefficients of xk in equation 
(25) equal to zero for k = 2, 3, etc. This gives the recurrence relation
(26)	
1k2 - 3k + 32ak-2 + 12k - 121k - 12ak-1 = 0 ,
or, equivalently,
(27)	
ak-1 = - 
k2 - 3k + 3
12k - 121k - 12
 ak-2 ,  k Ú 2  .
Setting k = 2, 3, and 4 in (27), we find

30
 a0   1k = 42 .

See Figure 8.8 on page 459.  ◆
To find a second linearly independent solution to equation (20), we could try setting 
r = 1>2 and solving for a1, a2, . . . to obtain a solution w11>2, x2 (see Problem 44, page 464). 
In this particular case, the approach would work. However, if we encounter an indicial equa-
tion that has a repeated root, then the method of Frobenius would yield just one solution 
(apart from constant multiples). To find the desired second solution, we must use another 
technique, such as the reduction of order procedure discussed in Section 4.7 or Exercises 6.1, 
Problem 31, page 327. We tackle the problem of finding a second linearly independent solution 
in the next section.

Theorem 6.	 If x0 is a regular singular point of equation (29), then there exists at 
least one series solution of the form (30), where r = r1 is the larger root of the  
associated indicial equation. Moreover, this series converges for all x such that  
0 6 x - x0 6 R, where R is the distance from x0 to the nearest other singular point 
(real or complex) of (29).
For simplicity, in the examples that follow we consider only series expansions about the 
regular singular point x = 0 and only those equations for which the associated indicial equa-
tion has real roots.
The following three examples not only illustrate the method of Frobenius but also are 
important models to which we refer in later sections.
Example 4
Find a series solution about the regular singular point x = 0 of
(32)	
x2y″1x2 - xy′1x2 + 11 - x2y1x2 = 0 ,  x 7 0 .
Solution
Here p1x2 = -x-1 and q1x2 = 11 - x2x-2. It is easy to check that x = 0 is a regular singular 
point of (32), so we compute
 p0 = lim
xS0 
 xp1x2 = lim
xS01 -12 = -1 ,
 q0 = lim
xS0
  x2q1x2 = lim
xS011 - x2 = 1 .
Then the indicial equation is
r1r - 12 - r + 1 = r2 - 2r + 1 = 1r - 122 = 0 ,
which has the roots r1 = r2 = 1.
Next we substitute
(33)	
w1r, x2 = xr a
∞
n = 0
 an xn = a

n = 0
 an xn+r
into (32) and obtain
(34)

n = 0
 1n + r2an xn+r-1
	
      + 11 - x2 a
∞
n = 0
 an xn+r = 0 ,
which we write as
(35)	
a

n = 0
 1n + r21n + r - 12an xn+r - a

n = 0
 1n + r2an xn+r

n = 0
 an xn+r - a
∞
n = 0
 an xn+r+1 = 0 .

Section 8.6    Method of Frobenius          461
Shifting the indices so that each summation in (35) is in powers xk+r, we take k = n + 1 in the 
last summation and k = n in the rest. This gives
(36)	
a
∞
k = 0
 31k + r21k + r - 12 - 1k + r2 + 14akxk+r - a
∞
k = 1
 ak-1xk+r = 0 .
Singling out the term corresponding to k = 0 and combining the rest under one summation 
yields
(37)	
3r1r - 12 - r + 14a0 xr
	
      + a
∞
k = 1
 531k + r21k + r - 12 - 1k + r2 + 14ak - ak-16xk+r = 0 .
When we set the coefficients equal to zero, we recover the indicial equation
(38)	
3r1r - 12 - r + 14a0 = 0 ,
and obtain, for k Ú 1, the recurrence relation
(39)	
31k + r22 - 21k + r2 + 14ak - ak-1 = 0 ,
which reduces to
(40)	
1k + r - 122ak - ak-1 = 0 .
Relation (40) can be used to solve for ak in terms of ak-1:
(41)	
ak =
1
1k + r - 122 ak-1 ,  k Ú 1 .
Setting r = r1 = 1 in (38) gives (as expected) 0 # a0 = 0, and in (41) gives
(42)	
ak = 1
k2 ak−1 ,  k # 1 .
For k = 1, 2, and 3, we now find
 a1 = 1
12 a0 = a0
 1k = 12 ,
 a2 = 1
22 a1 =
1
12 # 122 a0 = 1
4 a0
 1k = 22 ,
 a3 = 1
32 a2 =
1
13 # 2 # 122 a0 = 1
36 a0   1k = 32 .
In general, we have
(43)	
ak =
1
1k!22 a0 .
Hence, equation (32) has a series solution given by
(44)	
 w11, x2 = a0 x e1 + x + 1

 x2 + 1
36
 x3 + g f
	
 = a0  x a
∞
k = 0

1k!22 xk ,  x 7 0 .  ◆
Since x = 0 is the only singular point for equation (32), it follows from Frobenius’s theo-
rem or directly by the ratio test that the series solution (44) converges for all x 7 0.

462          Chapter 8    Series Solutions of Differential Equations
In the next two examples, we only outline the method; we leave it to you to furnish the 
intermediate steps.
Example 5
Find a series solution about the regular singular point x = 0 of
(45)	
xy″1x2 + 4y′1x2 - xy1x2 = 0 ,  x 7 0 .
Solution
Since p1x2 = 4>x and q1x2 = -1, we see that x = 0 is indeed a regular singular point and
p0 = lim
xS0
 xp1x2 = 4 ,  q0 = lim
xS0
 x2q1x2 = 0 .
The indicial equation is
r1r - 12 + 4r = r2 + 3r = r1r + 32 = 0 ,
with roots r1 = 0 and r2 = -3.
Now we substitute
(46)	
w1r, x2 = xr a
∞
n = 0
 an xn = a

n = 0
 an xn+r
into (45). After a little algebra and a shift in indices, we get

      + a
∞
k = 1
 31k + r + 121k + r + 42ak+1 - ak-14xk+r = 0 .
Next we set the coefficients equal to zero and find
(48)	
3r1r - 12 + 4r4a0 = 0 ,
(49)	
31r + 12r + 41r + 124a1 = 0 ,
and, for k Ú 1, the recurrence relation
(50)	
1k + r + 121k + r + 42ak+1 - ak-1 = 0 .
For r = r1 = 0, equation (48) becomes 0 # a0 = 0 and (49) becomes 4 # a1 = 0. Hence, 
although a0 is arbitrary, a1 must be zero. Setting r = r1 = 0 in (50), we find
(51)	
ak+1 =
1
1k + 121k + 42
 ak−1 ,  k # 1 ,
from which it follows (after a few experimental computations) that a2k+1 = 0 for k = 0, 1, . . . , 
and

 a2k =

Solution
Since p1x2 = 3>x and q1x2 = -1, we see that x = 0 is a regular singular point. Moreover,
p0 = lim
xS0 
 xp1x2 = 3 ,  q0 = lim
xS0  x2q1x2 = 0 .
So the indicial equation is
(55)	
r1r - 12 + 3r = r2 + 2r = r1r + 22 = 0 ,
with roots r1 = 0 and r2 = -2.
Substituting

k = 1
 31k + r + 121k + r + 32ak+1 - ak-14xk+r = 0 .
Setting the coefficients equal to zero, we have
(58)	
 3r1r - 12 + 3r4a0 = 0 ,
(59)	
 31r + 12r + 31r + 124a1 = 0 ,
and, for k Ú 1, the recurrence relation
(60)	
1k + r + 121k + r + 32ak+1 −ak−1 = 0 .
With r = r1 = 0, these equations lead to the following formulas: a2k+1 = 0, k = 0, 1, . . . ,

Unlike in Example 5, if we work with the second root r = r2 = -2 in Example 6, then 
we do not obtain a second linearly independent solution (see Problem 46).
In the preceding examples we were able to use the method of Frobenius to find a series 
solution valid to the right (x 7  0) of the regular singular point x = 0. For x 6 0, we can use 
the change of variables x = -t and then solve the resulting equation for t 7 0.
The method of Frobenius also applies to higher-order linear equations (see Problems 35–38).
If in Example 5 we had worked with the root r = r2 = -3, then we would actually have 
obtained two linearly independent solutions (see Problem 45).

In the previous section we showed that if x = 0 is a regular singular point of
(1)	
y″1x2 + p1x2y′1x2 + q1x2y1x2 = 0 ,  x 7 0 ,
then the method of Frobenius can be used to find a series solution valid for x near zero. The 
first step in the method is to find the roots r1 and r2 1Re r1 Ú Re r22 of the associated indicial 
equation
(2)	
r1r - 12 + p0r + q0 = 0 .
Then, utilizing the larger root r1, equation (1) has a series solution of the form

w1r1, x2 = xr1 a

 an xn+r1 ,
where a0 ≠0. To find a second linearly independent solution, our first inclination is to set

We’ll see that this procedure works, provided r1 - r2 is not an integer. However, when r1 - r2 
is an integer, the Frobenius method with r = r2 may just lead to the same solution that we 
obtained using the root r1. (This is obviously true when r1 = r2.2

where y11x2 and y21x2 are the series solutions given in equations (8) and (9). See  
Figure 8.9.  ◆
When the indicial equation has repeated roots, r1 = r2, obviously substituting r = r2 just 
gives us back the first solution and gets us nowhere. One possibility is to use the reduction of 
order method described in Section 4.7 or Exercises 6.1, Problem 31. However, this method has 
drawbacks in that it requires manipulations of series that often make it difficult to determine 
the general term in the series expansion for the second linearly independent solution. A more 
direct approach is to use the next theorem, which provides the form of this second solution. 
You will not be surprised to see that, analogous to the situation for a Cauchy–Euler equation 
whose indicial equation has repeated roots, a second linearly independent solution will involve 
the first solution multiplied by a logarithmic function.
In the following theorem, we give the general form of two linearly independent solutions 
for the three cases where the roots of the indicial equation (a) do not differ by an integer, (b) are 
equal, or (c) differ by a nonzero integer.

†For a proof of Theorem 7, see the text Ordinary Differential Equations, 4th ed., by G. Birkhoff and G.-C. Rota 
(Wiley, New York, 1989).
In each case of the theorem, y11x2 is just the series solution obtained by the method of 
Frobenius, with r = r1. When r1 - r2 is not an integer, the method of Frobenius yields a second 
linearly independent solution by taking r = r2. Let’s see how knowing the form of the second 
solution enables us to obtain it. Again, for simplicity, we consider only indicial equations hav-
ing real roots.

In Example 4 of Section 8.6, page 460, we used the method of Frobenius to obtain a series 
solution to equation (17). In the process, we found the indicial equation to be r2 - 2r + 1 = 0, 
which has roots r1 = r2 = 1. Working with r1 = 1, we derived the series solution

To find a second linearly independent solution y21x2, we appeal to Theorem 7, part (b),

Notice that the factor in front of ln x is just the left-hand side of equation (17) with y = y1. 
Since y1 is a solution to (17), this factor is zero. With this observation and a shift in the indices 
of summation, equation (21) can be rewritten as
(22)	
2xy=
11x2 - 2y11x2 + b1 x2 + a

k = 2
 1k2bk - bk-12xk+1 = 0 .
To identify the coefficients in (22) so that we can set them equal to zero, we must substi-
tute back in the series expansions for y11x2 and y=
11x2. From (18), we get that y=
11x2 =

1k!22 + k2bk - bk-1 Rxk+1 = 0 .
Next, we set the coefficients in (24) equal to zero. From the x2 term we have 2 + b1 = 0, so 
b1 = -2. From the xk+1 term, we obtain

1k!22 + k2bk - bk-1 = 0

In the next two examples we consider the case when the difference between the roots of 
the indicial equation is a positive integer. In Example 3, it will turn out that the constant C in 
formula (16) must be taken to be zero (i.e., no ln x term is present), while in Example 4, this 
constant is nonzero (i.e., a ln x term is present). Since the solutions to these examples require 
several intermediate computations, we do not display all the details. Rather, we encourage you 
to take an active part by bridging the gaps.

In closing we note that if the roots r1 and r2 of the indicial equation associated with a dif-
ferential equation are complex, then they are complex conjugates. Thus, the difference r1 - r2 
is imaginary and, hence, not an integer, and we are in case (a) of Theorem 7 on page 467. 
However, rather than employing the display (11)–(12) for the linearly independent solutions, 
one usually takes the real and imaginary parts of (11); Problem 26 provides an elaboration 
of this situation.

In advanced work in applied mathematics, engineering, and physics, a few special second-
order equations arise very frequently. These equations have been extensively studied, and vol-
umes have been written on the properties of their solutions, which are often referred to as 
special functions.
8.8  Special Functions

Section 8.8    Special Functions          475
For reference purposes we include a brief survey of three of these equations: the hyper-
geometric equation, Bessel’s equation, and Legendre’s equation. Bessel’s equation governs 
the radial dependence of the solutions to the classical partial differential equations of phys-
ics in spherical coordinate systems (see Section 10.7, page 624); Legendre’s equation gov-
erns their latitudinal dependence. C. F. Gauss formulated the hypergeometric equation as 
a generic equation whose solutions include the special functions of Legendre, Chebyshev, 
Gegenbauer, and Jacobi. For a more detailed study of special functions, we refer you to 
Basic Hypergeometric Series, 2nd ed., by G. Gasper and M. Rahman (Cambridge University 
Press, Cambridge, 2004); Special Functions, by E. D. Rainville (Chelsea, New York, 1971); 
and Higher Transcendental Functions, by A. Erdelyi (ed.) (McGraw-Hill, New York, 1953),

(1)	
x11 −x2y″ + 3G −1A + B + 12x4y′ −ABy = 0 ,
where a, b, and g are fixed parameters, is called the hypergeometric equation. This equation 
has singular points at x = 0 and 1, both of which are regular. Thus a series expansion about 
x = 0 for a solution to (1) obtained by the method of Frobenius will converge at least for 
0 6 x 6 1 (see Theorem 6, page 460). To find this expansion, observe that the indicial equation 
associated with x = 0 is
r1r - 12 + gr = r3r - 11 - g24 = 0 ,
which has roots 0 and 1 - g. Let us assume that g is not an integer and use the root r = 0 to

Since n Ú 1 and g is not an integer, there is no fear of dividing by zero when we rewrite (4) as
(5)	
an = 1n + a - 121n + b - 12
n1n + g - 12
 an-1 .
Solving recursively for an, we obtain

then we can express an more compactly as
(8)	
an = 1a2n1b2n
n!1g2n
 a0 ,  n Ú 1 .
[In fact, we can write n! as 112n.] If we take a0 = 1 and then substitute the expression for an in 
(8) into (2), we obtain the following solution to the hypergeometric equation:
(9)	
y11x2 = 1 + a

n = 1
1a2n1b2n
n!1g2n

The solution given in (9) is called a Gaussian hypergeometric function and is denoted 
by the symbol F1a, b; g; x2.† That is,
(10)	
F1A, B; G; x2 J 1 + a

Hypergeometric functions are generalizations of the geometric series. To see this, observe that 
for any constant b that is not zero or a negative integer,
F11, b; b; x2 = 1 + x + x2 + x3 + g .
It is interesting to note that many other familiar functions can be expressed in terms of the 
hypergeometric function. For example,
(11)	
 F1a, b; b; x2 = 11 - x2-a ,
(12)	
 F11, 1; 2; x2 = -x-1 ln11 - x2 ,

We omit the verification of these formulas.
To obtain a second linearly independent solution to (1) when g is not an integer, we use 
the other root, 1 - g, of the indicial equation and seek a solution of the form
(15) 	
y21x2 = a
∞
n = 0
 bn xn+1-g .
Substituting y21x2 into equation (1) and solving for bn, we eventually arrive at
(16)	
y21x2 = x1-g + a
∞
n = 1
1a + 1 - g2n1b + 1 - g2n
n!12 - g2n
 xn+1-g .
Factoring out x1-g, we see that the second solution y21x2 can be expressed in terms of a hyper-
geometric function. That is,
(17)	
y21x2 = x1-gF1a + 1 - g, b + 1 - g; 2 - g; x2 .
†Historical Footnote: A detailed study of this function was done by Carl Friedrich Gauss in 1813. In Men of Math-
ematics (Simon & Schuster, London, 1986), the mathematical historian E. T. Bell refers to Gauss as the Prince of 
Mathematicians.

Section 8.8    Special Functions          477
When g is an integer, one of the formulas given in (9) or (16) (corresponding to the larger 
root, 0 or 1 - g2 still gives a solution. We then use the techniques of this chapter to obtain a 
second linearly independent solution, which may or may not involve a logarithmic term. We 
omit a discussion of these solutions.
In many books, the hypergeometric function is expressed in terms of the gamma function 
Γ1x2 instead of the factorial function. Recall that in Section 7.7, we defined
(18)	
Γ1x2 J
L
∞

e-uu  x-1 du ,  x 7 0
and showed that
(19)	
Γ1x + 12 = x Γ1x2 ,  x 7 0 .
It follows from repeated use of relation (19) that
(20)	
1t2n = Γ1t + n2
Γ1t2
  ,
for t 7 0 and n any nonnegative integer. Using relation (20), we can express the hypergeomet-
ric function as

Bessel’s Equation
The linear second-order differential equation
(22)	
x2y″ + xy′ + 1x2 −N22y = 0 ,
where n Ú 0 is a fixed parameter, is called Bessel’s equation of order n. This equation has 
a regular singular point at x = 0 and no other singular points in the complex plane. Hence, a 
series solution for (22) obtained by the method of Frobenius will converge for 0 6 x 6 ∞. The 
indicial equation for (22) is
r1r - 12 + r - n2 = 1r - n21r + n2 = 0 ,
which has roots r1 = n and r2 = -n. If 2n is not an integer, then the method of Frobenius 
yields two linearly independent solutions, given by
(23)

If in (23) we take
a0 =

then it follows from relation (20) that the function

is a solution to (22). We call Jn1x2 the Bessel function of the first kind of order n.† Similarly, 
taking
b0 =
1
2-n Γ11 - n2
in equation (24) gives the solution
(26)

H
n=0
  
1 −12n
n! 횪11 −N + n2

,
which is the Bessel function of the first kind of order -n. When r1 - r2 = 2n is not an integer, 
we know by Theorem 7 of Section 8.7 that Jn1x2 and J-n1x2 are linearly independent. More-
over, it can be shown that if n is not an integer, even though 2n is, then Jn1x2 and J-n1x2 are 
still linearly independent.
What happens in the remaining case when n is a nonnegative integer, say n = m? While 
Jm1x2 is still a solution, the function J-m1x2 is not even properly defined because formula 
(26) will involve the gamma function evaluated at a nonpositive integer. From a more in-depth 
study of the gamma function, it turns out that 1>Γ1k2 should be 0, for k = 0, -1, -2, . . . . 
Hence, (26) becomes
(27)	
J-m1x2 = a

n = 0
 
1 -12n
n! Γ11 - m + n2

1 -12n

 .
Comparing (27) with the formula (25) for Jm1x2, we see (after a shift in index) that
(28)	
J-m1x2 = 1 -12mJm1x2 ,
which means that J-m1x2 and Jm1x2 are linearly dependent. To resolve the problem of find-
ing a second linearly independent solution in the case when n is a nonnegative integer, we can 
use Theorem 7 in Section 8.7, page 467. There is, however, another approach to this problem, 
which we now describe.
For n not an integer, we can take linear combinations of Jn1x2 and J-n1x2 to obtain other 
solutions to (22). In particular, let
(29)	
YN1x2 J cos1NP2JN1x2 −J−N1x2
sin1NP2
 ,  N not an integer,
for x 7 0. The function Yn1x2 is called the Bessel function of the second kind of order n,  
and, as can be verified, Jn1x2 and Yn1x2 are linearly independent. Notice that when n is an 
integer, the denominator in (29) is zero; but, by formula (28), so is the numerator! Hence, it 
is reasonable to hope that, in a limiting sense, formula (29) is still meaningful. In fact, using 
L’Hôpital’s rule, it is possible to show that for m a nonnegative integer, the function defined by
(30)	
Ym1x2 J lim
NSm
 cos1NP2JN1x2 −J−N1x2
sin1NP2
for x 7 0 is a solution to (22) with n = m. Furthermore, Jm1x2 and Ym1x2 are linearly inde-
pendent. We again call Ym1x2 the Bessel function of the second kind of order m. In the litera-
ture the function Ym1x2 is sometimes denoted by Nm1x2; variations of it have been called the 
Neumann function and the Weber function.
†Historical Footnote: Frederic Wilhelm Bessel (1784–1846) started his career in commercial navigation and later 
became an astronomer. In 1817 Bessel introduced the functions Jn1x2 in his study of planetary orbits.

Figure 8.14 shows the graphs of J01x2 and J11x2 and Figure 8.15 the graphs of Y01x2 and 
Y11x2. Notice that the curves for J01x2 and J11x2 behave like damped sine waves and have 
zeros that interlace (see Problem 28, page 485). The fact that the Bessel functions Jn have an 
infinite number of zeros is helpful in certain applications (see Project A in Chapter 10).
There are several useful recurrence relations involving Bessel functions. For example,

d

 3xnJn1x24 = xnJn-11x2 ,

To illustrate the techniques involved in proving the recurrence relations, let’s verify rela-
tion (31). We begin by substituting series (25) for Jn1x2 into the left-hand side of (31). Differ-
entiating, we get

(see Problems 22–24 on page 485).

sion dominate and we have

Legendre’s Equation
The linear second-order differential equation
(38)	
11 −x22y″ −2xy′ + n1n + 12y = 0 ,
where n is a fixed parameter, is called Legendre’s equation.† This equation has a regular sin-
gular point at 1, and hence a series solution for (38) about x = 1 may be obtained by the 
method of Frobenius. By setting z = x - 1, equation (38) is transformed into
(39)	
z1z + 22 d2y
dz2 + 21z + 12 dy
dz −n1n + 12y = 0 .
The indicial equation for (39) at z = 0 is
r1r - 12 + r = r2 = 0 ,
†Historical Footnote: Solutions to this equation were obtained by Adrien Marie Legendre (1752–1833) in 1785 and 
are referred to as Legendre functions.

where we have expressed y1 in terms of the original variable x and have taken a0 = 1. We have 
written (40) in a “hybrid” form to facilitate the observation that
(41)	
y11x2 = Fa -n, n + 1; 1; 1 - x
2
b ,
where F is the Gaussian hypergeometric function defined in (10) on page 476.
For n a nonnegative integer, the factor
1 -n2k = 1 -n21-n + 121-n + 22 g1 -n + k - 12
will be zero for k Ú n + 1. Hence, the solution given in (40) and (41) is a polynomial of degree n.  
Moreover, y1112 = 1. These polynomial solutions of equation (38) are called the Legendre 
polynomials or spherical polynomials and are traditionally denoted by Pn1x2. That is,
(42)

where 3n>24 is the greatest integer less than or equal to n>2 (see Problem 34). The first three 
Legendre polynomials are
P01x2 = 1 ,  P11x2 = x ,  P21x2 = 3

The Legendre polynomials satisfy the orthogonality condition
(44)

 Pm1x2Pn1x2dx = 0 for  n 3 m .
To see this, we first rewrite equation (38) in what is called the selfadjoint form:
(45)	
311 - x22y′4′ + n1n + 12y = 0 .
Since Pn1x2 and Pm1x2 satisfy (45) with parameters n and m, respectively, we have
(46)	
311 - x22P=
n1x24′ + n1n + 12Pn1x2 = 0 ,
(47)	
311 - x22P=
m1x24′ + m1m + 12Pm1x2 = 0 .
Multiplying (46) by Pm1x2 and (47) by Pn1x2 and then subtracting, we find
Pm1x2311 - x22P=
n1x24′ - Pn1x2311 - x22P=

        + 3n1n + 12 - m1m + 124Pm1x2Pn1x2 = 0 ,
which can be rewritten in the form

m1x24′ - Pm1x2311 - x22P=

It is a straightforward calculation to show that the right-hand side of (48) is just
511 - x223Pn1x2P=
m1x2 - P=
n1x2Pm1x246′ .
Using this fact and the identity n2 - m2 + n - m = 1n - m21n + m + 12, we rewrite equation 
(48) as
(49)	
1n - m21n + m + 12Pm1x2Pn1x2 = 511 - x223Pn1x2P=
m1x2 - P=
n1x2Pm1x246′ .
Integrating both sides of (49) from x = -1 to x = 1 yields

because 1 - x2 = 0 for x = {1. Since n and m are nonnegative integers with n ≠m, then 
1n - m21n + m + 12 ≠0, and so equation (44) follows from (50).
Legendre polynomials also satisfy the recurrence formula
(51)	
1n + 12Pn+11x2 = 12n + 12xPn1x2 −nPn−11x2
and Rodrigues’s formula
(52)	
Pn1x2 =

2nn! dn

(see Problems 32 and 33).
The Legendre polynomials are generated by the function 11 - 2xz + z22-1>2 in the sense 
that
(53)	
11 - 2xz + z22-1>2 = a
∞
n = 0
 Pn1x2zn ,  0 z0 6 1 ,  0 x0 6 1 .
That is, if we expand 11 - 2xz + z22-1>2 in a Taylor series about z = 0, treating x as a fixed 
parameter, then the coefficients of zn are the Legendre polynomials Pn1x2. The function 
11 - 2xz + z22-1>2 is called a generating function for Pn1x2 and can be derived from the 
recurrence formula (51) (see Problem 35).
The Legendre polynomials are an example of a class of special functions called classical 
orthogonal polynomials.† The latter includes, for example, the Jacobi polynomials, P1a,b2
n
1x2; 
the Gegenbauer or ultraspherical polynomials, Cl
n1x2; the Chebyshev (Tchebichef) polynomials, 
Tn1x2 and Un1x2; the Laguerre polynomials, La
n1x2; and the Hermite polynomials, Hn1x2. 
The properties of the classical orthogonal polynomials can be found in the books mentioned 
earlier in this section or in the Handbook of Mathematical Functions with Formulas, Graphs, 
and Mathematical Tables, by M. Abramowitz and I. A. Stegun (eds.) (Dover Publications,  
New York, 1964), Chapter 22. The latter has been updated by the National Institute of

Chapter 8 Summary
Initial value problems that do not fall into the “solvable” categories that have been studied (such 
as constant-coefficient or equidimensional equations) can often be analyzed by interpreting 
the differential equation as a prescription for computing the higher derivatives of the unknown 
function. The Taylor polynomial method uses the equation to construct a polynomial ap-
proximation matching the initial values of a finite number of derivatives of the unknown. If the 
equation permits the extrapolation of this procedure to polynomials of arbitrarily high degree, 
power series representations of the solution can be constructed.

Power Series
Every power series Σ∞
n = 0 an1x - x02n has a radius of convergence r, 0 … r … ∞, such that the 
series converges absolutely for 0 x - x00 6 r and diverges when 0 x - x00 7 r. By the ratio test,
r = lim
nS∞
 0 an0
0 an+10  ,
provided that this limit exists as an extended real number. A function f1x2 that is the sum of a 
power series in some open interval about x0 is said to be analytic at x0. If f is analytic at x0, its 
power series representation about x0 is the Taylor series
f1x2 = a

n = 0

Power Series Method for an Ordinary Point
In the case of a linear equation of the form
(1)	
y″ + p1x2y′ + q1x2y = 0 ,
where p and q are analytic at x0, the point x0 is called an ordinary point, and the equation 
has a pair of linearly independent solutions expressible as power series about x0. The radii of 
convergence of these series solutions are at least as large as the distance from x0 to the nearest 
singularity (real or complex) of the equation. To find power series solutions to (1), we substitute 
y1x2 = Σ∞
n = 0 an1x - x02n into (1), group like terms, and set the coefficients of the resulting 
power series equal to zero. This leads to a recurrence relation for the coefficients an, which, in 
some cases, may even yield a general formula for the an. The same method applies to the non-
homogeneous version of (1), provided the forcing function is also analytic at x0.
Regular Singular Points
If, in equation (1), either p or q fails to be analytic at x0, then x0 is a singular point of (1). If x0 
is a singular point for which 1x - x02p1x2 and 1x - x022q1x2 are both analytic at x0, then x0 is 
a regular singular point. The Cauchy–Euler equation,
(2)	
ax2 d2y
dx2 + bx dy
dx + cy = 0 ,  x 7 0 ,
has a regular singular point at x = 0, and a general solution to (2) can be obtained by substitut-
ing y = xr and examining the roots of the resulting indicial equation ar2 + 1b - a2r + c = 0.
Method of Frobenius
For an equation of the form (1) with a regular singular point at x0, a series solution can be found 
by the method of Frobenius. This is obtained by substituting
w1r, x2 = 1x - x02r a
∞
n = 0
 an1x - x02n
into (1), finding a recurrence relation for the coefficients, and choosing r = r1, the larger root 
of the indicial equation
(3)	
r1r - 12 + p0 r + q0 = 0 ,
where p0 J limxSx01x - x02p1x2, q0 J limxSx01x - x022 q1x2.

Finding a Second Linearly Independent Solution
If the two roots r1, r2 of the indicial equation (3) do not differ by an integer, then a second lin-
early independent solution to (1) can be found by taking r = r2 in the method of Frobenius. 
However, if r1 = r2 or r1 - r2 is a positive integer, then discovering a second solution requires a 
different approach. This may be a reduction of order procedure or the utilization of Theorem 7, 
page 467, which gives the forms of the solutions.
Special Functions
Some special functions in physics and engineering that arise from series solutions to linear 
second-order equations with polynomial coefficients are Gaussian hypergeometric functions, 
F1a, b; g; x2; Bessel functions Jn1x2; and orthogonal polynomials such as those of Legendre, 
Chebyshev, Laguerre, and Hermite.

Projects for Chapter 8
In 1961, C. A. R. Hoare published the algorithm Quicksort, for alphabetizing a large list of words 
(“Algorithm 64: Quicksort,” by C. A. R. Hoare, Comm. ACM 4 (1961): 324). First, one of the n 
words is selected at random, and the rest of the list is separated into two sublists—those that pre-
cede the selected word and those that follow it. This entails 1n - 12 comparisons. Then the same 
procedure is applied to each sublist, and so on.
If the selected words happen to belong in the middle of the collections—say, 50th out of 
100—then the sort is very efficient. One sort involving 99 comparisons, then 2 sorts of 49 com-
parisons each, and so forth. But in the worst case, if the randomly selected words happen to 
belong at the beginning or end of the list, the number of comparisons is 99 + 98 + 97 + g + 1.
(a)	 Show that, for a list of length n, if all the selected words happen to belong at the mid-
point of their sublists, then the total number of comparisons is roughly n ln2 n.

Several authors have devised improvements to Quicksort to reduce the probability of  
worst-case scenarios. (For example, instead of choosing one word at random, one chooses 
three words and uses the median for comparison.) The article “An Asymptotic Theory for  
Cauchy-Euler Differential Equations with Applications to the Analysis of Algorithms,” by  
H.-H. Chern, H.-K. Hwang, and T.-H. Tsai (Journal of Algorithms, 44 (2002): 177–225) shows 
how the methodology in this project can be extended to analyze many of these strategies.
In quantum mechanics one is interested in determining the wave function and energy states of an 
atom. These are determined from Schrödinger’s equation. In the case of the hydrogen atom, it is 
possible to find wave functions c that are functions only of r, the distance from the proton to the 
electron. Such functions are called spherically symmetric and satisfy the simpler equation

(d)	 Now for a1 = 1 and k very large, ak+1 ≈12a>k2ak and so ak+1 ≈12a2k>k!, which 
are the coefficients for re2ar. Hence, g acts like re2ar, so f1r2 = e-arg1r2 is like rear.

large, so is c. Roughly speaking, c21r2 is proportional to the probability of finding an 
electron a distance r from the proton. Thus, the above argument would imply that the 
electron in a hydrogen atom is more likely to be found at a very large distance from the 
proton! Since this makes no sense physically, we ask: Do there exist positive values for 
a for which c remains bounded as r becomes large?

Matrix Methods for Linear 
Systems
In this chapter we return to the analysis of systems of differential equations. When the equa-
tions in the system are linear, matrix algebra provides a compact notation for expressing the 
system. In fact, the notation itself suggests new and elegant ways of characterizing the solution 
properties, as well as novel, efficient techniques for explicitly obtaining solutions.
9.1  Introduction
In Chapter 5 we analyzed physical situations wherein two fluid tanks containing 
brine solutions were interconnected and pumped so as ultimately to deplete the salt 
content in each tank. By accounting for the various influxes and outfluxes of brine, 
a system of differential equations for the salt contents 1x1t2 and y1t22 of each tank 
was derived; a typical model is
(1)	
dx>dt = −4x + 2y ,
	
dy>dt = 4x −4y .
Express this system in matrix notation as a single equation.
The right-hand side of the first member of (1) possesses a mathematical structure that is familiar 
from vector calculus; namely, it is the dot product† of two vectors:
(2)	
-4x + 2y = 3 -4 24 # 3x y4  .
Similarly, the second right-hand side in (1) is the dot product
4x - 4y = 34 -44 # 3x y4 .
The frequent occurrence in mathematics of arrays of dot products, such as evidenced in the 
system (1), led to the development of matrix algebra, a mathematical discipline whose basic 
operation—the matrix product—is the arrangement of a set of dot products according to the 
following plan:
c -4
2
4
-4d c x
yd = c 3 -4 24 # 3x y4
34 -44 # 3x y4 d = c -4x + 2y
4x - 4yd .
In general, the product of a matrix—i.e., an m by n rectangular array of numbers—and a 
column vector is defined to be the collection of dot products of the rows of the matrix with the 
†Recall that the dot product of two vectors u and v equals the length of u times the length of v times the cosine of the 
angle between u and v. However, it is more conveniently computed from the components of u and v by the “inner 
product” indicated in equation (2).

vector, arranged as a column vector:
D
row # 1
row # 2
f
row # m
T  DvT = D
3row # 14 # v
3row # 24 # v
f
3row # m4 # v
T  ,
where the vector v has n components; the dot product of two n-dimensional vectors is com-
puted in the obvious way:
3a1 a2 gan4 # 3x1 x2 g xn4 = a1x1 + a2x2 + g + anxn .
Using the notation for the matrix product, we can write the system (1) for the intercon-
nected tanks as
c x′
y′ d = c -4

4
-4d c x
yd  .
The following example demonstrates a four-dimensional implementation of this notation. 
Note that the coefficients in the linear system need not be constants.

 x=

 x=

as a matrix equation.
Solution
We express the right-hand side of the first member of (3) as the dot product
2x1 + t2x2 + 14t + et2x4 = 32 t2 0 14t + et24 # 3x1 x2 x3 x44  .

Section 4.1, page 152)
(4)	
my″ + ky = 0
as an equivalent system of first-order equations in normal form, expressed in matrix notation.
Solution
We have to express the second derivative, y″, as a first derivative in order to formulate (4) as a 
first-order system. This is easy; the acceleration y″ is the derivative of the velocity y = y′, so 
(4) becomes
(5)	
my′ + ky = 0 .
The first-order system is then assembled by identifying y with y′, and appending it to (5):
 y′ = y
 my′ = -ky .
To put this system in normal form and express it as a matrix equation, we need to divide the 
second equation by the mass m:
c y

In general, the customary way to write an nth-order linear homogeneous differential 
equation
an1t2y1n2 + an-11t2y1n-12 + g + a11t2y′ + a01t2y = 0

Section 9.1    Introduction          499
as an equivalent system in normal form is to define the first 1n - 12 derivatives of y (including 
y, the zeroth derivative, itself) to be new unknowns:
 x11t2 = y1t2 ,
 x21t2 = y′1t2 ,
f
 xn1t2 = y1n-121t2 .
Then the system consists of the identification of xj1t2 as the derivative of xj-11t2, together 
with the original differential equation expressed in these variables (and divided by an1t2):

For systems of two or more higher-order differential equations, the same procedure is applied 
to each unknown function in turn; an example will make this clear.

governed by the system

Write (6) in matrix notation.
Solution
We introduce notation for the lower-order derivatives:

x1 = x ,  x2 = x′ ,  x3 = y ,  x4 = y′ .

9.1  EXERCISES
Here and in the next section we review some basic facts concerning linear algebraic systems 
and matrix algebra that will be useful in solving linear systems of differential equations in nor-
mal form. Readers competent in these areas may proceed to Section 9.4.

a11x1 + a12x2 + g + a1nxn = b1 ,
a21x1 + a22x2 + g + a2nxn = b2 ,
f
an1x1 + an2x2 + g + annxn = bn
(where the aij’s and bi’s are given constants) is called a linear system of n algebraic equa-
tions in the n unknowns x1, x2, c, xn. The procedure for solving the system using elimination 
methods is well known. Herein we describe a particularly convenient implementation of the 
method called the Gauss–Jordan elimination algorithm.† The basic idea of this formulation 
is to use the first equation to eliminate x1 in all the other equations; then use the second equa-
tion to eliminate x2 in all the others; and so on. If all goes well, the resulting system will be 
“uncoupled,” and the values of the unknowns x1, x2, c, xn will be apparent. A short example 
will make this clear.
9.2  Review 1: Linear Algebraic Equations
†The Gauss–Jordan algorithm is neither the fastest nor the most accurate computer algorithm for solving a linear sys-
tem of algebraic equations, but for solutions executed by hand it has many pedagogical advantages. Usually it is much 
faster than Cramer’s rule, described in Appendix D.

Section 9.2    Review 1: Linear Algebraic Equations          501
Example 1
Solve the system
2x1 +  6x2 +  8x3 = 16 ,
4x1 +  15x2 +  19x3 = 38 ,
2x1
 +  3x3 = 6 .
Solution
By subtracting 2 times the first equation from the second, we eliminate x1 from the latter. 
Similarly, x1 is eliminated from the third equation by subtracting 1 times the first equation 
from it:
 2x1 + 6x2 + 8x3 = 16 ,
 3x2 + 3x3 = 6 ,
 -6x2 - 5x3 = -10 .
Next we subtract multiples of the second equation from the first and third to eliminate x2 in 
them; the appropriate multiples are 2 and -2, respectively:
 2x1
+ 2x3 = 4 ,
 
3x2 + 3x3 = 6 ,
 x3 = 2 .
Finally, we eliminate x3 from the first two equations by subtracting multiples (2 and 3, respec-
tively) of the third equation:
2x1
= 0 ,
3x2
= 0 ,
x3 = 2 .
The system is now uncoupled; i.e., we can solve each equation separately:
x1 = 0 , x2 = 0 , x3 = 2 .  ◆
Two complications can disrupt the straightforward execution of the Gauss–Jordan algorithm. 
The first occurs when the impending variable to be eliminated (say, xj ) does not occur in the  
jth equation. The solution is usually obvious; we employ one of the subsequent equations to 
eliminate xj. Example 2 illustrates this maneuver.
Example 2
Solve the system
x1 + 2x2 + 4x3 + x4 = 0 ,
-x1 - 2x2 - 2x3
= 1 ,
-2x1 - 4x2 - 8x3 + 2x4 = 4 ,
x1 + 4x2 + 2x3
= -3 .
Solution
The first unknown x1 is eliminated from the last three equations by subtracting multiples of the 
first equation:
 x1 + 2x2 + 4x3 + x4 = 0 ,
 2x3 + x4 = 1 ,
 4x4 = 4 ,
 2x2 - 2x3 - x4 = -3 .

502          Chapter 9    Matrix Methods for Linear Systems
Now, we cannot use the second equation to eliminate the second unknown because x2 is not 
present. The next equation that does contain x2 is the fourth, so we switch the second and 
fourth equation:
 x1 + 2x2 + 4x3 + x4 = 0 ,
 2x2 - 2x3 - x4 = -3 ,
 4x4 = 4 ,
 2x3 + x4 = 1 ,
and proceed to eliminate x2:
x1
+ 6x3 + 2x4 = 3 ,
2x2 - 2x3 - x4 = -3 ,
4x4 = 4 ,
2x3 + x4 = 1 .
To eliminate x3, we have to switch again,
x1
+ 6x3 + 2x4 = 3 ,
2x2 - 2x3 - x4 = -3 ,
2x3 + x4 = 1 ,
4x4 = 4 ,
and eliminate, in turn, x3 and x4. This gives
x1
- x4 = 0 ,                   x1
= 1 ,
2x2
= -2 ,    and     
2x2
= -2 ,
2x3 + x4 = 1 ,                  
2x3
= 0 ,
4x4 = 4 ,                  
4x4 = 4 .
The solution to the uncoupled equations is
x1 = 1 , x2 = -1 , x3 = 0 , x4 = 1 .  ◆
The other complication that can disrupt the Gauss–Jordan algorithm is much more 
profound. What if, when we are “scheduled” to eliminate the unknown xj, it is absent from all 
of the subsequent equations? The first thing to do is to move on to the elimination of the next 
unknown xj+1, as demonstrated in Example 3.
Example 3
Apply the Gauss–Jordan algorithm to the system
(1)
	
 2x1 +  4x2 +  x3 = 8 ,
	
 2x1 +  4x2
 = 6 ,
	
 -4x1 -  8x2 +  x3 = -10 .
Solution
Elimination of x1 proceeds as usual:
 2x1 + 4x2 +  x3 = 8 ,
 -  x3 = -2 ,
 
 3x3 = 6 .

Section 9.2    Review 1: Linear Algebraic Equations          503
Now since x2 is absent from the second and third equations, we use the second equation to 
eliminate x3 :
(2)
	
 2x1 + 4x2
 = 6 ,
	
 - x3 = -2 ,
	
 
 0 = 0 .
How do we interpret the system (2)? The final equation contains no information, of course, 
and we ignore it.† The second equation implies that x3 = 2.
The first equation implies that x1 = 3 - 2x2, but there is no equation for x2. Evidently, 
x2 is a “free” variable, and we can assign any value to it—as long as we take x1 to be 3 - 2x2. 
Thus (1) has an infinite number of solutions, and a convenient way of characterizing them is
x1 = 3 - 2s , x2 = s , x3 = 2 ; - ∞6 s 6 ∞ .
We remark that an equivalent solution can be obtained by treating x1 as the free variable, 
say x1 = s, and taking x2 = 13 - s2>2, x3 = 2.  ◆
The final example is contrived to demonstrate all the features that we have encountered.
Example 4
Find all solutions to the system
 x1 -  x2 +  2x3 +  2x4 = 0 ,
 2x1 -  2x2 +  4x3 +  3x4 = 1 ,
 3x1 -  3x2 +  6x3 +  9x4 = -3 ,
 4x1 -  4x2 +  8x3 +  8x4 = 0 .
Solution
We use the first equation to eliminate x1:
 x1 - x2 + 2x3 +  2x4 = 0 ,
 -  x4 = 1 ,
 
 3x4 = -3 ,
 
 0 = 0 .
Now, both x2 and x3 are absent from all subsequent equations, so we use the second equation 
to eliminate x4.
 x1 - x2 + 2x3
 = 2 ,
 -x4 = 1 ,
 0 = 0 ,
 0 = 0 .
There are no constraints on either x2 or x3; thus we take them to be free variables and characterize 
the solutions by
x1 = 2 + s - 2t , x2 = s , x3 = t , x4 = -1, - ∞6 s, t 6 ∞ .  ◆
In closing, we note that if the execution of the Gauss–Jordan algorithm results in a display 
of the form 0 = 1 (or 0 = k, where k ≠0), the original system has no solutions; it is inconsistent. 
This is explored in Problem 12.
†The occurrence of the identity 0 = 0 in the Gauss–Jordan algorithm implies that one of the original equations was 
redundant. In this case you may observe that the final equation in (1) can be derived by subtracting 3 times the second 
equation from the first.

A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers arranged in rows and columns. An m * n matrix—
that is, a matrix with m rows and n columns—is usually denoted by

where the element in the ith row and jth column is aij. The notation 3aij4 is also used to desig-
nate A. The matrices we will work with usually consist of real numbers, but in certain instances 
we allow complex-number entries.
9.3  Review 2: Matrices and Vectors

Section 9.3    Review 2: Matrices and Vectors          505
Some matrices of special interest are square matrices, which have the same number of 
rows and columns; diagonal matrices, which are square matrices with only zero entries off the 
main diagonal (that is, aij = 0 if i ≠j); and (column) vectors, which are n * 1 matrices. For 
example, if
A = £

then A is a square matrix, B is a diagonal matrix, and x is a vector. An m * n matrix whose 
entries are all zero is called a zero matrix and is denoted by 0. For consistency, we denote 
matrices by boldfaced capitals, such as A, B, C, I, X, and Y, and reserve boldfaced lower­
case letters, such as c, x, y, and z, for vectors.
Algebra of Matrices
Matrix Addition and Scalar Multiplication.  The operations of matrix addition and scalar 
multiplication are very straightforward. Addition is performed by adding corresponding elements:
c 1
2
3
4
5
6d + c 1
1
1
1
1
1d = c 2
3
4
5
6
7d  .
Formally, the sum of two m * n matrices is given by
A + B = 3aij4 + 3bij4 = 3aij + bij4 .
(The sole novelty here is that addition is not defined for two matrices whose dimensions m, n 
differ.)
To multiply a matrix by a scalar (number), we simply multiply each element in the matrix 
by the number:
3 c 1
2
3
4
5
6d = c 3
6
9
12
15
18d  .
In other words, rA = r3aij4 = 3raij4. The notation -A stands for 1 -12A.
Properties of Matrix Addition and Scalar Multiplication.  Matrix addition and scalar mul-
tiplication are nothing more than mere bookkeeping, and the usual algebraic properties hold. If 
A, B, and C are m * n matrices and r, s are scalars, then
A + 1B + C2 = 1A + B2 + C ,    A + B = B + A ,
A + 0 = A ,	
A + 1 -A2 = 0 ,
r1A + B2 = rA + rB ,	
1r + s2A = rA + sA ,
r1sA2 = 1rs2A = s1rA2 .
Matrix Multiplication.  The matrix product is what makes matrix algebra interesting and 
useful. We indicated in Section 9.1 that the product of a matrix A and a column vector x is the 
column vector composed of dot products of the rows of A with x:
c 1

§ = c 1 # 1 + 2 # 0 + 3 # 2
4 # 1 + 5 # 0 + 6 # 2d = c 7
16d  .

506          Chapter 9    Matrix Methods for Linear Systems
More generally, the product of two matrices A and B is formed by taking the array of dot prod-
ucts of the rows of the first “factor” A with the columns of the second factor B; the dot product 
of the ith row of A with the jth column of B is written as the ijth entry of the product AB:
 c 1

6 + 1 + 2
3x - y + 2z d
 = c 5
3
x + z
12
9
3x - y + 2z d .
Note that AB is only defined when the number of columns of A matches the number of rows of 
B. A useful formula for the product of an m * n matrix A and an n * p matrix B is
AB J 3cij4 ,        where    cij J a
n
k = 1
aikbkj .
The dot product of the ith row of A and the jth column of B is seen in the “sum of products” 
expression for cij.
Since AB is computed in terms of the rows of the first factor and the columns of the second 
factor, it should not be surprising that, in general, AB does not equal BA (matrix multiplication 
does not commute):
c 1
2
3
4d c 0

0d = c 2

0d c 1

4d = c 3

In fact, the dimensions of A and B may render one or the other of these products undefined:
c 1
2
3
4d c 0
1d = c 2
4d  ;  c 0
1d c 1
2
3
4d  not defined .
By the same token, one might not expect (AB)C to equal A(BC), since in (AB)C we take 
dot products with the columns of B, whereas in A(BC) we employ the rows of B. So it is a 
pleasant surprise that this complication does not arise, and the “parenthesis grouping” rules are 
the customary ones:
Properties of Matrix Multiplication
1AB2C = A1BC2	
(Associativity)
1A + B2C = AC + BC	
(Distributivity)
A1B + C2 = AB + AC	
(Distributivity)
1rA)B = r1AB2 = A1rB2	
(Associativity)
To summarize, the algebra of matrices proceeds much like the standard algebra of num-
bers, except that we should never presume that we can switch the order of matrix factors.  
(If you think 1A + B22 = A2 + B2 + 2AB, what error have you made?)
Matrices as Linear Operators.  Let A be an m * n matrix and let x and y be n * 1 vectors. 
Then Ax is an m * 1 vector, and so we can think of multiplication by A as defining an operator 
that maps n * 1 vectors into m * 1 vectors. A consequence of the distributivity and associativ-
ity properties is that multiplication by A defines a linear operator, since A(x + y) = Ax + Ay 
and A(rx) = rAx. Moreover, if A is an m * n matrix and B is an n * p matrix, then the m * p 
matrix AB defines a linear operator that is the composition of the linear operator defined by B 

Section 9.3    Review 2: Matrices and Vectors          507
with the linear operator defined by A. That is, (AB)x = A(Bx), where x is a p * 1 vector.
Examples of linear operations are
(i)	 stretching or contracting the components of a vector by constant factors;
(ii)	 rotating a vector through some angle about a fixed axis;
(iii)	 reflecting a vector in a plane mirror.
The Matrix Formulation of Linear Algebraic Systems.  Matrix algebra was developed to 
provide a convenient tool for expressing and analyzing linear algebraic systems. Note that the 
set of equations
x1 +  2x2 +  x3 = 1 ,
x1 +  3x2 +  2x3 = -1 ,
x1
 +  x3 = 0
can be written using the matrix product

In general, we express the linear system
 a11x1 +  a12x2 + g +  a1nxn = b1 ,
 a21x1 +  a22x2 + g +  a2nxn = b2 ,
f
 an1x1 +  an2x2 + g +  annxn = bn
in matrix notation as Ax = b, where A is the coefficient matrix, x is the vector of unknowns, 
and b is the vector of constants occurring on the right-hand side:
A = D

If b = 0, the system Ax = b is said to be homogeneous (analogous to the nomenclature of  
Section 4.2).
Matrix Transpose.  The matrix obtained from A by interchanging its rows and columns is 
called the transpose of A and is denoted by AT. For example, if
A = c

Problem 7.

Matrix Identity.  There is a “multiplicative identity” in matrix algebra, namely, a square 
diagonal matrix I with ones down the main diagonal. Multiplying I on the right or left by any 
other matrix (with compatible dimensions) reproduces the latter matrix:

Matrix Inverse.  Some square matrices A can be paired with other (square) matrices B 
having the property that BA = I:

When this happens, it can be shown that
(i)	 B is the unique matrix satisfying BA = I, and
(ii)	 B also satisfies AB = I.
In such a case, we say that B is the inverse of A and write B = A-1.
Not every matrix possesses an inverse; the zero matrix 0, for example, can never satisfy 
the equation 0B = I. A matrix that has no inverse is said to be singular.
If we know an inverse for the coefficient matrix A in a system of linear equations Ax = b, 
the solution can be calculated directly by computing A-1b, as the following derivation shows:
Ax = b implies A-1Ax = A-1b implies x = A-1b .
Using (2), for example, we can solve equation (1) quite efficiently:

for the inconsistent systems of Problem 12, Exercises 9.2 (page 504), are necessarily singular.
When A-1 is known, solving Ax = b by multiplying b by A-1 is certainly easier than 
applying the Gauss–Jordan algorithm of the previous section†. So it appears advantageous to 
be able to find matrix inverses. Some inverses can be obtained directly from the interpretation 
of the matrix as a linear operator. For example, the inverse of a matrix that rotates a vector is 
†(When the effort to compute the inverse is accounted for, Gauss–Jordan emerges as the winner.)

Section 9.3    Review 2: Matrices and Vectors          509
the matrix that rotates it in the opposite direction. A matrix that performs a mirror reflection 
is its own inverse (what do you get if you reflect twice?). But in general one must employ  
an algorithm to compute a matrix inverse. The underlying strategy for this algorithm is based 
on the observation that if X denotes the inverse of A, then X must satisfy the equation AX = I; 
finding X amounts to solving n linear systems of equations for the columns 5x1, x2, . . . , xn6 
of X:
Ax1 = F

The implementation of this operation is neatly executed by the following variation of the 
Gauss–Jordan algorithm.
Finding the Inverse of a Matrix.  By a row operation, we mean any one of the following:
(a)	 Interchanging two rows of the matrix
(b)	 Multiplying a row of the matrix by a nonzero scalar
(c)	 Adding a scalar multiple of one row of the matrix to another row.
If the n * n matrix A has an inverse, then A-1 can be determined by performing row oper-
ations on the n * 2n matrix 3A?I4 obtained by writing A and I side by side. In particular, we 
perform row operations on the matrix 3A?I4 until the first n rows and columns form the iden-
tity matrix; that is, the new matrix is 3I?B4. Then A-1 = B. We remark that if this procedure 
fails to produce a matrix of the form 3I?B4, then A has no inverse.

Determinants.  The determinant of a 2 * 2 matrix A, denoted det A or  A  , is defined by
det A = ` a11

` = a11a22 - a12a21.
The determinants of higher-order square matrices can be defined recursively in terms of 
lower-order determinants, using the concept of the minor; the minor of a particular entry is 
the determinant of the submatrix formed when that entry’s row and column are deleted. Then 
the determinant of an n * n matrix equals the alternating-sign sum of the products of the 
entries of the first row with their minors. For a 3 * 3 matrix A this looks like

Although higher-order determinants can be calculated similarly, a more practical way to 
evaluate them involves the row-reduction of the matrix to upper triangular form. Here we will 
deal mainly with low-order determinants, and direct the reader to a linear algebra text for fur-
ther discussion.†
Determinants have a geometric interpretation: det A is the volume (in n-dimensional space) 
of the parallelepiped whose edges are given by the column vectors of  A. But their chief value 
lies in the role they play in the following theorem, which summarizes many of the results from 
linear algebra that we shall need, and in Cramer’s rule, described in Appendix D.
†Your authors’ personal favorite is Fundamentals of Matrix Analysis with Applications, by Edward Barry Saff and 
Arthur David Snider (John Wiley & Sons, Hoboken, New Jersey, 2016).
Matrices and Systems of Equations
Theorem 1.	
Let A be an n * n matrix. The following statements are equivalent:
(a)	 A is singular (does not have an inverse).
(b)	 The determinant of A is zero.
(c)	 Ax = 0 has nontrivial solutions (x ≠0).
(d)	 The columns (rows) of A form a linearly dependent set.
In part (d), the statement that the n columns of A are linearly dependent means that there 
exist scalars c1, c, cn, not all zero, such that
c1a1 + c2a2 + g + cnan = 0 ,
where aj is the vector forming the jth column of A.
If A is a singular square matrix (so det A = 0), then Ax = 0 has infinitely many solutions. 
Indeed, Theorem 1 asserts that there is a vector x0 ≠0 such that Ax0 = 0, and we can get 
infinitely many other solutions by multiplying x0 by any scalar, i.e., taking x = cx0. Furthermore, 
Ax = b either has no solutions or it has infinitely many of them of the form
x = xp + xh ,
where xp is a particular solution to Ax = b and xh is any of the infinity of solutions to Ax = 0 
(see Problem 15). The resemblance of this situation to that of solving nonhomogeneous linear 
differential equations should be quite apparent.
To illustrate, in Example 3 of Section 9.2 (page 502) we saw that the system

If A is a nonsingular square matrix (i.e., A has an inverse and det A ≠02, then the homo-
geneous system Ax = 0 has x = 0 as its only solution. More generally, when det A ≠0, the 
system Ax = b has a unique solution (namely, x = A-1b2.
Calculus of Matrices
If we allow the entries aij1t2 in a matrix A1t2 to be functions of the variable t, then A1t2 is a 
matrix function of t. Similarly, if the entries xi1t2 of a vector x1t2 are functions of t, then x1t2 
is a vector function of t.
These matrix and vector functions have a calculus much like that of real-valued functions. 
A matrix A1t2 is said to be continuous at t0 if each entry aij1t2 is continuous at t0. Moreover, 
A1t2 is differentiable at t0 if each entry aij1t2 is differentiable at t0, and we write

1lx, y2 = l1x, y) , 1x, ly2 = l1x, y2 .
In keeping with the introduction presented in Section 9.1, we say that a system of n linear dif-
ferential equations is in normal form if it is expressed as
(1)	
x′1t2 = A1t2x1t2 + f1t2 ,
where x1t2 = col1x11t2, c, xn1t22, f1t2 = col1f11t2, c, fn1t22, and A1t2 = 3aij1t24 
is an n * n matrix. As with a scalar linear differential equation, a system is called homogeneous 
when f1t2 K 0; otherwise, it is called nonhomogeneous. When the elements of A are all  
constants, the system is said to have constant coefficients. Recall that an nth-order linear  
differential equation
(2)	
y1n21t2 + pn-11t2y1n-121t2 + g + p01t2y1t2 = g1t2
can be rewritten as a first-order system in normal form using the substitution x11t2 J y1t2, 
x21t2 J y′1t2, c, xn1t2 J y1n-121t2; indeed, equation (2) is equivalent to x′1t2 = 
A1t2x1t2 +  f1t2, where x1t2 = col1x11t2, c, xn1t22, f1t2 J col10, c, 0, g1t22, and

The theory for systems in normal form parallels very closely the theory of linear differential 
equations presented in Chapters 4 and 6. In many cases the proofs for scalar linear differential 
equations carry over to normal systems with appropriate modifications. Conversely, results for 
normal systems apply to scalar linear equations since, as we showed, any scalar linear equation 
can be expressed as a normal system. This is the case with the existence and uniqueness theo-
rems for linear differential equations.
The initial value problem for the normal system (1) is the problem of finding a differen-
tiable vector function x1t2 that satisfies the system on an interval I and also satisfies the initial 
condition x1t02 = x0, where t0 is a given point of I and x0 = col1x1,0, c, xn,02 is a given 
vector.
9.4  Linear Systems in Normal Form

516          Chapter 9    Matrix Methods for Linear Systems
We give a proof of this result in Chapter 13† and obtain as corollaries the existence and 
uniqueness theorems for second-order equations (Theorem 4, Section 4.5, page 182) and 
higher-order linear equations (Theorem 1, Section 6.1, page 319).
If we rewrite system (1) as x′ - Ax = f and define the operator L3x4 J x′ - Ax, then 
we can express system (1) in the operator form L3x4 = f. Here the operator L maps vector 
functions into vector functions. Moreover, L is a linear operator in the sense that for any scalars 
a, b and differentiable vector functions x, y, we have
L3ax + by4 = aL3x4 + bL3y4 .
The proof of this linearity follows from the properties of matrix multiplication (see Problem 27).
As a consequence of the linearity of L, if x1, c, xn are solutions to the homogeneous sys-
tem x′ = Ax, or L3x4 = 0 in operator notation, then any linear combination of these vectors, 
c1x1 + g + cnxn, is also a solution. Moreover, we will see that if the solutions x1, c, xn are 
linearly independent, then every solution to L3x4 = 0 can be expressed as c1x1 + g + cnxn 
for an appropriate choice of the constants c1, c, cn.
Existence and Uniqueness
Theorem 2.	
If A1t2 and f1t2 are continuous on an open interval I that contains the 
point t0, then for any choice of the initial vector x0, there exists a unique solution x1t2 
on the whole interval I to the initial value problem
x′1t2 = A1t2x1t2 + f1t2 ,  x1t02 = x0 .
Linear Dependence of Vector Functions
Definition 1.	 The m vector functions x1, c, xm are said to be linearly dependent on 
an interval I if there exist constants c1, c, cm, not all zero, such that
(3)	
c1x11t2 + g + cmxm1t2 = 0
for all t in I. If the vectors are not linearly dependent, they are said to be linearly  
independent on I.
Example 1
Show that the vector functions x11t2 = col1et, 0, et2, x21t2 = col13et, 0, 3et2, and 
x31t2 =  col1t, 1, 02 are linearly dependent on 1 - ∞, ∞2.
Solution
Notice that x2 is just 3 times x1 and therefore 3x11t2 - x21t2 + 0 # x31t2 = 0 for all t. Hence, 
x1, x2, and x3 are linearly dependent on 1 - ∞, ∞2.  ◆

Value Problems, 7th ed.

Section 9.4    Linear Systems in Normal Form          517
Solution
Note that at every instant t0, the column vector x11t02 is a multiple of x21t02; indeed, 
x11t02 = x21t02 for t0 Ú 0, and x11t02 = -x21t02 for t0 … 0. Nonetheless, the vector functions 
are not dependent, because the c’s in condition (3) are not allowed to change with t; for t 6 0, 
the equation c1x11t2 + c2x21t2 = 0 implies c1 - c2 = 0, but for t 7 0 it implies c1 + c2 = 0. 
Thus c1 = c2 = 0 and the functions are independent.  ◆
Example 3
Show that the vector functions x11t2 = col1e2t, 0, e2t2, x21t2 = col1e2t, e2t, -e2t2, and 
x31t2 =  col1et, 2et, et2 are linearly independent on 1 - ∞, ∞2.
Solution
To prove independence, we assume c1, c2, and c3 are constants for which
c1x11t2 + c2x21t2 + c3x31t2 = 0
holds at every t in 1 - ∞, ∞2 and show that this forces c1 = c2 = c3 = 0. In particular, when 
t = 0 we obtain
c1 £

which is equivalent to the system of linear equations
(4)
	
 c1 + c2 + c3 = 0 ,
	
 c2 + 2c3 = 0 ,
	
 c1 - c2 + c3 = 0 .
Either by solving (4) or by checking that the determinant of its coefficients is nonzero (recall 
Theorem 1 on page 511), we can verify that (4) has only the trivial solution c1 = c2 = c3 = 0. 
Therefore the vector functions x1, x2, and x3 are linearly independent on 1 - ∞, ∞2 (in fact, on 
any interval containing t = 0).  ◆
As Example 3 illustrates, if x11t2, x21t2, c, xn1t2 are n vector functions, each having 
n components, we can establish their linear independence on an interval I if we can find one 
point t0 in I where the determinant
det3x11t02 cxn1t024
is not zero. Because of the analogy with scalar equations, we call this determinant the  
Wronskian.
Wronskian
Definition 2.	 The Wronskian of n vector functions x11t2 = col1x1,1, c, xn,12, c, 
xn1t2 = col1x1,n, c, xn,n2 is defined to be the function

518          Chapter 9    Matrix Methods for Linear Systems
We see that n vector functions are linearly independent on an interval if their Wronskian 
is nonzero at any point in the interval. But now we show that if these functions happen to 
be independent solutions to a homogeneous system x′ = Ax, where A is an n * n matrix of 
continuous functions, then the Wronskian is never zero on I. For suppose to the contrary that 
W1t02 = 0. Then by Theorem 1 the vanishing of the determinant implies that the column 
vectors x11t02, x21t02, c, xn1t02 are linearly dependent. Thus there exist scalars c1, c, cn 
not all zero, such that at t0
c1x11t02 + g + cnxn1t02 = 0 .
However, c1x11t2 + g + cnxn1t2 and the vector function z1t2 K 0 are both solutions to 
x′ = Ax on I, and they agree at the point t0. So these solutions must be identical on I accord-
ing to the existence-uniqueness theorem (Theorem 2, page 516). That is,
c1x11t2 + g + cnxn1t2 = 0
for all t in I. But this contradicts the given information that x1, c, xn are linearly independent on I.  
We have shown that W1t02 ≠0, and since t0 is an arbitrary point, it follows that W1t2 ≠0 for all t ∈I.
The preceding argument has two important implications that parallel the scalar case. First, 
the Wronskian of solutions to x′ = Ax is either identically zero or never zero on I (see also 
Problem 33). Second, a set of n solutions x1, c, xn to x′ = Ax on I is linearly independent 
on I if and only if their Wronskian is never zero on I. With these facts in hand, we can imitate 
the proof given for the scalar case in Section 6.1 (Theorem 2, page 322) to obtain the following 
representation theorem for the solutions to x′ = Ax.
Representation of Solutions (Homogeneous Case)
Theorem 3.	
Let x1, c, xn be n linearly independent solutions to the homogeneous system
(5)	
x′1t2 = A1t2x1t2
on the interval I, where A1t2 is an n * n matrix function continuous on I. Then every 
solution to (5) on I can be expressed in the form
(6)	
x1t2 = c1x11t2 + g + cnxn1t2 ,
where c1, c, cn are constants.
A set of solutions 5x1, c, xn6 that are linearly independent on I or, equivalently, whose 
Wronskian does not vanish on I, is called a fundamental solution set for (5) on I. The linear 
combination in (6), written with arbitrary constants, is referred to as a general solution to (5).
If we take the vectors in a fundamental solution set and let them form the columns of a 
matrix X1t2, that is,
X1t2 = 3x11t2 x21t2 cxn1t24 = D
x1,11t2

then the matrix X1t2 is called a fundamental matrix for (5). We can use it to express the 
general solution (6) as
x1t2 = X1t2c ,
where c = col1c1, c, cn2 is an arbitrary constant vector. Since det X = W3x1, c, xn4 is 
never zero on I, it follows from Theorem 1 on page 511 that X1t2 is invertible for every t in I.

indeed, this is equivalent to showing that x′ = Ax for each column x in S. In general, a funda-
mental matrix for a system x′ = Ax satisfies the corresponding matrix differential equation 
X′ = AX.
Another consequence of the linearity of the operator L defined by L3x4 J x′ - Ax is the 
superposition principle for linear systems. It states that if x1 and x2 are solutions, respectively, 
to the nonhomogeneous systems
L3x4 = g1 and L3x4 = g2 ,

520          Chapter 9    Matrix Methods for Linear Systems
then c1x1 + c2x2 is a solution to
L3x4 = c1g1 + c2g2 .
Using the superposition principle and the representation theorem for homogeneous systems, we 
can prove the following theorem.
Representation of Solutions (Nonhomogeneous Case)
Theorem 4.	
If xp is a particular solution to the nonhomogeneous system
(9)	
x′1t2 = A1t2x1t2 + f1t2
on the interval I and 5x1, c, xn6 is a fundamental solution set on I for the correspond-
ing homogeneous system x1t2 = A1t2x1t2, then every solution to (9) on I can be 
expressed in the form
(10)	
x1t2 = xp1t2 + c1x11t2 + g + cnxn1t2 ,
where c1, c, cn are constants.
The proof of this theorem is almost identical to the proofs of Theorem 4 in Section 4.5 
(page 182) and Theorem 4 in Section 6.1 (page 325). We leave the proof as an exercise.
The linear combination of xp, x1, c, xn in (10) written with arbitrary constants c1, c, cn 
is called a general solution of (9). This general solution can also be expressed as x = xp + Xc, 
where X is a fundamental matrix for the homogeneous system and c is an arbitrary constant vector.
We now summarize the results of this section as they apply to the problem of finding a 
general solution to a system of n linear first-order differential equations in normal form.
We devote the rest of this chapter to methods for finding fundamental solution sets for 
homogeneous systems and particular solutions for nonhomogeneous systems.
Approach to Solving Normal Systems
1.  To determine a general solution to the n * n homogeneous system x′ = Ax:
(a)  Find a fundamental solution set 5x1, c, xn6 that consists of n linearly indepen-
dent solutions to the homogeneous system.
(b)  Form the linear combination
x = Xc = c1x1 + g + cnxn ,
where c = col1c1, c, cn2 is any constant vector and X = 3x1 cxn4 is the 
fundamental matrix, to obtain a general solution.
2.  To determine a general solution to the nonhomogeneous system x′ = Ax + f:
(a)  Find a particular solution xp to the nonhomogeneous system.
(b)  Form the sum of the particular solution and the general solution Xc =
c1x1 + g + cnxn to the corresponding homogeneous system in part 1,
x = xp + Xc = xp + c1x1 + g + cnxn ,
to obtain a general solution to the given system.

Section 9.5    Homogeneous Linear Systems with Constant Coefficients           523
In this section we discuss a procedure for obtaining a general solution for the homogeneous 
system
(1)	
x′1t2 = Ax1t2 ,
where A is a (real) constant n * n matrix. The general solution we seek will be defined for all 
t because the elements of A are just constant functions, which are continuous on 1- ∞, ∞2 
(recall Theorem 2, page 516). In Section 9.4 we showed that a general solution to (1) can be 
constructed from a fundamental solution set consisting of n linearly independent solutions to 
(1). Thus our goal is to find n such vector solutions.
In Chapter 4 we were successful in solving homogeneous linear equations with constant 
coefficients by guessing that the equation had a solution of the form ert. Because any scalar 
linear equation can be expressed as a system, it is reasonable to expect system (1) to have solu-
tions of the form
x1t2 = ertu ,
where r is a constant and u is a constant vector, both of which must be determined. Substituting 
ertu for x1t2 in (1) gives
rertu = Aertu = ertAu .
Canceling the factor ert and rearranging terms, we find that
(2)	
1A - rI2u = 0 ,
where rI denotes the diagonal matrix with r’s along its main diagonal.
The preceding calculation shows that x1t2 = ertu is a solution to (1) if and only if r and u 
satisfy equation (2). Since the trivial case, u = 0, is of no help in finding linearly independent 
solutions to (1), we require that u ≠0. Such vectors are given a special name, as follows.
9.5  Homogeneous Linear Systems with  
Constant Coefficients
Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Definition 3.	 Let A = 3aij4 be an n * n constant matrix. The eigenvalues of A are 
those (real or complex) numbers r for which 1A - rI2u = 0 has at least one nontrivial 
(real or complex) solution u. The corresponding nontrivial solutions u are called the 
eigenvectors of A associated with r.
As stated in Theorem 1 of Section 9.3, a linear homogeneous system of n algebraic equa-
tions in n unknowns has a nontrivial solution if and only if the determinant of its coefficients 
is zero. Hence, a necessary and sufficient condition for (2) to have a nontrivial solution is that
(3)	
0 A −rI0 = 0 .
Expanding the determinant of A - rI in terms of its cofactors, we find that it is an  
nth-degree polynomial in r; that is,
(4)	
0 A −rI0 = p1r2 .

524          Chapter 9    Matrix Methods for Linear Systems
Therefore, finding the eigenvalues of a matrix A is equivalent to finding the zeros of the 
polynomial p1r2. Equation (3) is called the characteristic equation of A, and p1r2 in (4) 
is the characteristic polynomial of A. The characteristic equation plays a role for systems  
similar to the role played by the auxiliary equation for scalar equations.
Many commercially available software packages can be used to compute the eigenvalues 
and eigenvectors for a given matrix. Three such packages are MATLAB®, available from The 
MathWorks, Inc.; MATHEMATICA®, available from Wolfram Research; and MAPLESOFT®, 
available from Waterloo Maple Inc. Although you are encouraged to make use of such pack-
ages, the examples and most exercises in this text can be easily carried out without them. Those 
exercises for which a computer package is desirable are flagged with the icon       .

The characteristic equation for A is

Hence the eigenvalues of A are r1 = 1, r2 = -1. To find the eigenvectors corresponding to 
r1 = 1, we must solve 1A - r1I2u = 0. Substituting for A and r1 gives

Notice that this matrix equation is equivalent to the single scalar equation u1 - 3u2 = 0. 
Therefore, the solutions to (5) are obtained by assigning an arbitrary value for u2 (say, u2 = s) 
and setting u1 = 3u2 = 3s. Consequently, the eigenvectors associated with r1 = 1 can be 
expressed as
(6)	
u1 = s c 3

Solving, we obtain u1 = s and u2 = s, with s arbitrary. Therefore, the eigenvectors associated 
with the eigenvalue r2 = -1 are

We remark that in the above example the collection (6) of all eigenvectors associated with 
r1 = 1 forms a one-dimensional subspace when the zero vector is adjoined. The same is true 
for r2 = -1. These subspaces are called eigenspaces.

526          Chapter 9    Matrix Methods for Linear Systems
Let’s return to the problem of finding a general solution to a homogeneous system of  
differential equations. We have already shown that ertu is a solution to (1) if r is an eigenvalue 
and u a corresponding eigenvector. The question is: Can we obtain n linearly independent  
solutions to the homogeneous system by finding all the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A? The 
answer is yes, if A has n linearly independent eigenvectors.
n Linearly Independent Eigenvectors
Theorem 5.	
Suppose the n * n constant matrix A has n linearly independent  
eigenvectors u1, u2, c, un. Let ri be the eigenvalue† corresponding to ui. Then
(12)	
{er1tu1, er2tu2, c, erntun}
is a fundamental solution set (and X1t2 = 3er1tu1   er2tu2   g   erntun4 is a fundamental 
matrix) on 1 - ∞, ∞2 for the homogeneous system x′ = Ax. Consequently, a general 
solution of x′ = Ax is
(13)	
x1t2 = c1er1tu1 + c2er2tu2 + g + cnerntun ,
where c1, c, cn are arbitrary constants.
Proof.  As we have seen, the vector functions listed in (12) are solutions to the homoge-
neous system. Moreover, their Wronskian is
W1t2 = det3er1tu1, c, erntun4 = e1r1+ g+rn2t det3u1, c, un4 .
Since the eigenvectors are assumed to be linearly independent, it follows from Theorem 1 in 
Section 9.3 that det3u1, c, un4 is not zero. Hence the Wronskian W1t2 is never zero. This 
shows that (12) is a fundamental solution set, and consequently a general solution is given  
by (13).  ◆
An application of Theorem 5 is given in the next example.
Example 3
Find a general solution of
(14)	
x′1t2 = Ax1t2 , where A = c 2
-3
1
-2d  .
†The eigenvalues r1, c, rn may be real or complex and need not be distinct. In this section the cases we discuss have 
real eigenvalues. We consider complex eigenvalues in Section 9.6.
Solution
In Example 1 we showed that the matrix A has eigenvalues r1 = 1 and r2 = -1. Taking, say, 
s = 1 in equations (6) and (7), we get the corresponding eigenvectors
u1 = c 3
1d   and  u2 = c 1
1d  .
Because u1 and u2 are linearly independent, it follows from Theorem 5 that a general 
solution to (14) is
(15)	
x1t2 = c1et c 3
1d + c2e-t c 1
1d  .  ◆

Section 9.5    Homogeneous Linear Systems with Constant Coefficients           527
If we sum the vectors on the right-hand side of equation (15) and then write out the expres-
sions for the components of x1t2 =  col1x11t2, x21t22, we get
x11t2 = 3c1et + c2e-t ,
x21t2 = c1et + c2e-t .
This is the familiar form of a general solution for a system, as discussed in Section 5.2.
Example 3 nicely illustrates the geometric role played by the eigenvectors u1 and u2. If 
the initial vector x102 is a scalar multiple of u11i.e., x102 = c1u12, then the vector solution 
to the system, x1t2 = c1etu1, will always have the same or opposite direction as u1. That is, it 
will lie along the straight line determined by u1 (see Figure 9.1). Furthermore, the trajectory of 
this solution, as t increases, will tend to infinity, since the corresponding eigenvalue r1 = 1 is 
positive (observe the et term). A similar assertion holds if the initial vector is a scalar multiple 
of u2, except that since r2 = -1 is negative, the trajectory x1t2 = c2e-tu2 will approach the 
origin as t increases (because of e-t). For an initial vector that involves both u1 and u2, such as 
x102 = 1
21u1 + u22, the resulting trajectory is a blend of the above motions, with the contribu-
tion due to the larger eigenvalue r1 = 1 dominating as t increases; see Figure 9.1.
The straight-line trajectories in the x1x2-plane (the phase plane), then, point along the 
directions of the eigenvectors of the matrix A. (See Section 5.4, Figure 5.11, page 266, for 
example.)
A useful property of eigenvectors that concerns their linear independence is stated in the 
next theorem.

Linear Independence of Eigenvectors
Theorem 6.	
If r1, c, rm are distinct eigenvalues for the matrix A and ui is an  
eigenvector associated with ri, then u1, c, um are linearly independent.
Proof.  Let’s first treat the case m = 2. Suppose, to the contrary, that u1 and u2 are 
linearly dependent so that
(16)	
u1 = cu2

528          Chapter 9    Matrix Methods for Linear Systems
for some constant c. Multiplying both sides of (16) by A and using the fact that u1 and u2 are 
eigenvectors with corresponding eigenvalues r1 and r2, we obtain
(17)	
r1u1 = cr2u2 .
Next we multiply (16) by r2 and then subtract from (17) to get
1r1 - r22u1 = 0 .
Since u1 is not the zero vector, we must have r1 = r2. But this violates the assumption that the 
eigenvalues are distinct! Hence u1 and u2 are linearly independent.
The cases m 7 2 follow by induction. The details of the proof are left as Problem 48.  ◆
Combining Theorems 5 and 6, we get the following corollary.
n Distinct Eigenvalues
Corollary 1.	 If the n * n constant matrix A has n distinct eigenvalues r1, c, rn and  
ui is an eigenvector associated with ri, then
{er1tu1, c, erntun}
is a fundamental solution set for the homogeneous system x′ = Ax.

Section 9.5    Homogeneous Linear Systems with Constant Coefficients           529
There is a special class of n * n matrices that always have n linearly independent 
eigenvectors. These are the real symmetric matrices.
Real Symmetric Matrices
Definition 4.	 A real symmetric matrix A is a matrix with real entries that satisfies 
AT = A.
Taking the transpose of a matrix interchanges its rows and columns. Doing this is equiva-
lent to “flipping” the matrix about its main diagonal. Consequently, AT = A if and only if A is 
symmetric about its main diagonal.
If A is an n * n real symmetric matrix, it is known† that all its eigenvalues are real and that 
there always exist n linearly independent eigenvectors. In such a case, Theorem 5 applies and a 
general solution to x′ = Ax is given by (13).
†See Fundamentals of Matrix Analysis with Applications, by Edward Barry Saff and Arthur David Snider (John Wiley 
& Sons, Hoboken, New Jersey, 2016).

Solution
A is symmetric, so we are assured that A has three linearly independent eigenvectors. To find 
them, we first compute the characteristic equation for A:
0 A - rI0 = †
1 - r
-2
2
-2
1 - r
2
2
2
1 - r
† = -1r - 3221r + 32 = 0 .
Thus the eigenvalues of A are r1 = r2 = 3 and r3 = -3.
Notice that the eigenvalue r = 3 has multiplicity 2 when considered as a root of the 
characteristic equation. Therefore, we must find two linearly independent eigenvectors 
associated with r = 3. Substituting r = 3 in 1A - rI2u = 0 gives

This system is equivalent to the single equation -u1 - u2 + u3 = 0, so we can obtain its solu-
tions by assigning an arbitrary value to u2, say u2 = y, and an arbitrary value to u3, say u3 = s. 
Solving for u1, we find u1 = u3 - u2 = s - y. Therefore, the eigenvectors associated with 
r1 = r2 = 3 can be expressed as

If a matrix A is not symmetric, it is possible for A to have a repeated eigenvalue but not to 
have two linearly independent corresponding eigenvectors. In particular, the matrix
(22)	
A = c 1
-1

-3d
has the repeated eigenvalue r1 = r2 = -1, but Problem 35 shows that all the eigenvectors 
associated with r = -1 are of the form u = s col11, 22. Consequently, no two eigenvectors 
are linearly independent.
A procedure for finding a general solution in such a case is illustrated in Problems 35–40, 
but the underlying theory is deferred to Section 9.8, where we discuss the matrix exponential.
A final note. If an n * n matrix A has n linearly independent eigenvectors ui with eigen-
values ri, a little inspection reveals that property (2) is expressed columnwise by the equation

or AU = UD, where U is the matrix whose column vectors are eigenvectors and D is a diago-
nal matrix whose diagonal entries are the eigenvalues. Since U’s columns are independent, U is 
invertible and we can write
(24)	
A = UDU-1 or D =  U-1AU ,
and we say that A is diagonalizable. [In this context equation (24) expresses a similarity trans-
formation.] Because the argument that leads from (2) to (23) to (24) can be reversed, we have 
a new characterization: An n * n matrix has n linearly independent eigenvectors if, and only if, 
it is diagonalizable.

low from Theorem 9 in Section 9.8 that if one fundamen-
tal matrix of the system has this property, then all funda-
mental matrices for the system do.) Otherwise, the system 
is unstable. A stable system is asymptotically stable if 
all solutions approach the zero solution as t S + ∞. Sta-
bility is discussed in more detail in Chapter 12.†

where A is a constant n * n matrix, has a solution of the form x1t2 = ertu if and only if r is an 
eigenvalue of A and u is a corresponding eigenvector. In this section we show how to obtain 
two real vector solutions to system (1) when A is real and has a pair† of complex conjugate 
eigenvalues a + ib and a - ib.
Suppose r1 = a + ib1a and b real numbers) is an eigenvalue of A with corresponding 
eigenvector z = a + ib, where a and b are real constant vectors. We first observe that the 
complex conjugate of z, namely z J a - ib, is an eigenvector associated with the eigenvalue 
r2 = a - ib. To see this, note that taking the complex conjugate of 1A - r1I2z = 0 yields 
1A - r1I2z = 0 because the conjugate of the product is the product of the conjugates and A 
and I have real entries 1A = A, I = I2. Since r2 = r1, we see that z is an eigenvector associ-
ated with r2. Therefore, two linearly independent complex vector solutions to (1) are
(2)	
w11t2 = er1t z = e1a+ib2t1a + ib2 ,
(3)	
w21t2 = er2t  z = e1a-ib2t1a - ib2 .
As in Section 4.3, where we handled complex roots to the auxiliary equation, let’s use one 
of these complex solutions and Euler’s formula to obtain two real vector solutions. With the aid 
of Euler’s formula, we rewrite w11t2 as
 w11t2 = eat1cos bt + i sin bt21a + ib2
 = eat51cos bt  a - sin bt  b2 + i1sin bt  a + cos bt  b26 .
We have thereby expressed w11t2 in the form w11t2 = x11t2 + ix21t2, where x11t2 and x21t2 
are the two real vector functions
(4)	
x11t2 J eat cos bt  a - eat sin bt  b ,
(5)	
x21t2 J eat sin bt  a + eat cos bt  b .

Equating the real and imaginary parts yields

Hence, x11t2 and x21t2 are real vector solutions to (1) associated with the complex conjugate 
eigenvalues a { ib. Because a and b are not both the zero vector, it can be shown that x11t2 
and x21t2 are linearly independent vector functions on 1 - ∞, ∞2 (see Problem 15).
Let’s summarize our findings.
Complex Eigenvalues
If the real matrix A has complex conjugate eigenvalues a { ib with corresponding eigen-
vectors a { ib, then two linearly independent real vector solutions to x′1t2 = Ax1t2 are

Solution
The characteristic equation for A is

Hence, A has eigenvalues r = -2 { i.
To find a general solution, we need only find an eigenvector associated with the eigenvalue 
r = -2 + i. Substituting r = -2 + i into 1A - rI2z = 0 gives
c 1 - i

The solutions can be expressed as z1 = 2s and z2 = 1 -1 + i2s, with s arbitrary. Hence, the eigen-
vectors associated with r = -2 + i are z = s col12, -1 + i2. Taking s = 1 gives the eigenvector

Complex eigenvalues occur in modeling coupled mass–spring systems. For example, the 
motion of the mass–spring system illustrated in Figure 9.5 is governed by the ­second-order 
­system

where x1 and x2 represent the displacements of the masses m1 and m2 to the right of their equi-
librium positions and k1, k2, k3 are the spring constants of the three springs (see the discussion 
in Section 5.6). If we introduce the new variables y1 J x1, y2 J x=
1, y3 J x2, y4 J x=

we can rewrite the system in the normal form

For such a system, it turns out that A has only imaginary eigenvalues and they occur in ­complex 
conjugate pairs: {ib1, {ib2. Hence, any solution will consist of sums of sine and cosine func-
tions. The frequencies of these functions
f1 J b1
2p    and    f2 J b2

are called the normal or natural frequencies of the system (b1 and b2 are the angular 
­frequencies of the system).
In some engineering applications, the only information that is required about a particular 
device is a knowledge of its normal frequencies; one must ensure that they are far from the 
frequencies that occur naturally in the device’s operating environment (so that no resonances 
will be excited).

when A is an n * n constant matrix and the entries of f1t2 are polynomials, exponential func-
tions, sines and cosines, or finite sums and products of these functions. We can use the proce-
dure box in Section 4.5 (page 184) and reproduced at the back of the book as a guide in choos-
ing the form of a particular solution xp1t2. Some exceptions are discussed in the exercises (see

t1Aa + g2 + 1Ab - a2 = 0 .
Setting the “coefficients” of this vector polynomial equal to zero yields the two systems
(3)	
Aa = -g ,
(4)	
Ab = a .
By Gaussian elimination or by using a linear algebra software package, we can solve (3)  
for a and we find a = col15, 2, 42. Next we substitute for a in (4) and solve for b to obtain 
b = col11, 0, 22. Hence a particular solution for (1) is

A general solution for (1) is x1t2 = xh1t2 + xp1t2, where xh1t2 is given in (2) and xp1t2 
in (5).  ◆
In the preceding example, the nonhomogeneous term f1t2 was a vector polynomial. If, 
instead, f1t2 has the form
f1t2 = col11, t, sin t2 ,
then, using the superposition principle, we would seek a particular solution of the form
xp1t2 = ta + b + 1sin t2c + 1cos t2d .

540          Chapter 9    Matrix Methods for Linear Systems
Similarly, if
f1t2 = col1t, et, t22 ,
we would take
xp1t2 = t2a + tb + c + etd .
Of course, we must modify our guess, should one of the terms be a solution to the corre-
sponding homogeneous system. If this is the case, the annihilator method [equations (15) and 
(16) of Section 6.3, page 337] would appear to suggest that for a nonhomogeneity f1t2 of the 
form erttmg, where r is an eigenvalue of A, m is a nonnegative integer, and g is a constant vector, 
a particular solution of x′ = Ax + f can be found in the form
xp1t2 = ert5tm+sam+s + tm+s-1am+s-1 + g + ta1 + a06 ,
for a suitable choice of s. We omit the details.
Variation of Parameters
In Section 4.6 we discussed the method of variation of parameters for a general constant-­
coefficient second-order linear equation. Simply put, the idea is that if a general solution to 
the homogeneous equation has the form xh1t2 = c1x11t2 + c2x21t2, where x11t2 and x21t2 
are linearly independent solutions to the homogeneous equation, then a particular solution to 
the nonhomogeneous equation would have the form xp1t2 = y11t2x11t2 + y21t2x21t2, where 
y11t2 and y21t2 are certain functions of t. A similar idea can be used for systems.
Let X1t2 be a fundamental matrix for the homogeneous system
(6)	
x′1t2 = A1t2x1t2 ,
where now the entries of A may be any continuous functions of t. Because a general solution to 
(6) is given by X1t2c, where c is a constant n * 1 vector, we seek a particular solution to the 
nonhomogeneous system
(7)	
x′1t2 = A1t2x1t2 + f1t2
of the form
(8)	
xp1t2 = X1t2Y1t2 ,
where Y1t2 = col1y11t2, c, yn1t22 is a vector function of t to be determined.
To derive a formula for Y1t2, we first differentiate (8) using the matrix version of the 
­product rule to obtain
x=
p1t2 = X1t2Y′1t2 + X′1t2Y1t2 .
Substituting the expressions for xp1t2 and x=
p1t2 into (7) yields
(9)	
X1t2Y′1t2 + X′1t2Y1t2 = A1t2X1t2Y1t2 + f1t2 .
Since X1t2 satisfies the matrix equation X′1t2 = A1t2X1t2, equation (9) becomes
XY′ + AXY = AXY + f ,
XY′ = f .
Multiplying both sides of the last equation by X-11t2 [which exists since the columns of X1t2 
are linearly independent] gives
Y′1t2 = X-11t2 f1t2 .

Section 9.7    Nonhomogeneous Linear Systems          541
Integrating, we obtain
Y1t2 =
L
X-11t2 f1t2dt .
Hence, a particular solution to (7) is
(10)	
xp1t2 = X1t2Y1t2 = X1t2
L
X−11t2 f1t2dt .
Combining (10) with the solution X1t2c to the homogeneous system yields the following 
­general solution to (7):
(11)	
x1t2 = X1t2c + X1t2
L
X−11t2 f1t2dt .
The elegance of the derivation of the variation of parameters formula (10) for systems 
becomes evident when one compares it with the more lengthy derivations for the scalar case in 
Sections 4.6 and 6.4.
Given an initial value problem of the form
(12)	
x′1t2 = A1t2x1t2 + f1t2 ,  x1t02 = x0 ,
we can use the initial condition x1t02 = x0 to solve for c in (11). Expressing x1t2 using a 
definite integral, we have
x1t2 = X1t2c + X1t2
L
t
t0
X-11s2 f1s2ds .
From the initial condition x1t02 = x0, we find
x0 = x1t02 = X1t02c + X1t02
L
t0
t0
X-11s2 f1s2ds = X1t02c .
Solving for c, we have c = X-11t02x0. Thus, the solution to (12) is given by the formula
(13)	
x1t2 = X1t2X−11t02x0 + X1t2
L
t
t0
X−11s2 f1s2 ds .
To apply the variation of parameters formulas, we first must determine a fundamental 
matrix X1t2 for the homogeneous system. In the case when the coefficient matrix A  
is constant, we have discussed methods for finding X1t2. However, if the entries of  
A depend on t, the determination of X1t2 may be extremely difficult (entailing, perhaps, 
a matrix power series!).

50 L of liquid, are interconnected by pipes. The liquid 
flows from tank A into tank B at a rate of 4 L/min and 
from B into A at a rate of 1 L/min (see Figure 9.9). The 
liquid inside each tank is kept well stirred. A brine solu-
tion that has a concentration of 0.2 kg/L of salt flows 
into tank A at a rate of 4 L/min. A brine solution that 
has a concentration of 0.1 kg/L of salt flows into tank B 
at a rate of 1 L/min. The solutions flow out of the sys-
tem from both tanks—from tank A at 1 L/min and from 
tank B at 4 L/min. If, initially, tank A contains pure water 
and tank B contains 0.5 kg of salt, determine the mass of 
salt in each tank at time t Ú 0. After several minutes have

Section 9.8    The Matrix Exponential Function          545
In this chapter we have developed various ways to extend techniques for scalar differential 
equations to systems. In this section we take a substantial step further by showing that with the 
right notation, the formulas for solving normal systems with constant coefficients are identi-
cal to the formulas for solving first-order equations with constant coefficients. For example, 
we know that a general solution to the equation x′1t2 = ax1t2, where a is a constant, is 
x1t2 = ceat. Analogously, we show that a general solution to the normal system
(1)	
x′1t2 = Ax1t2 ,
where A is a constant n * n matrix, is x1t2 = eAtc. Our first task is to define the matrix 
­exponential eAt.
If A is a constant n * n matrix, we define eAt by taking the series expansion for eat and 
replacing a by A; that is,
(2)	
eAt J I + At + A2 t2
2! + P + An tn
n! + P.
(Note that we also replace 1 by I.) By the right-hand side of (2), we mean the n * n matrix 
whose elements are power series with coefficients given by the corresponding entries in the 
matrices I, A, A2>2!, . . . .
If A is a diagonal matrix, then the computation of eAt is straightforward. For example, if
A = c -1
0

2d  ,
then
A2 = AA = c 1

More generally, if A is an n * n diagonal matrix with r1, r2, c, rn down its main diagonal, 
then eAt is the diagonal matrix with er1t, er2t, c, ernt down its main diagonal (see Problem 26). 
If A is not a diagonal matrix, the computation of eAt is more involved. We deal with this impor-
tant problem later in this section.
It can be shown that the series (2) converges for all t and has many of the same properties† 
as the scalar exponential eat.
9.8  The Matrix Exponential Function
†For proofs of these and other properties of the matrix exponential function, see Fundamentals of Matrix Analysis 
with Applications, by Edward Barry Saff and Arthur David Snider (John Wiley & Sons, Hoboken, New Jersey, 2016), 
Chapter 7. See also the amusing articles, “Nineteen Dubious Ways to Compute the Exponential of a Matrix,” by Cleve 
Moler and Charles van Loan, SIAM Review, Vol. 20, No. 4 (Oct. 1978), and “Nineteen . . . Matrix, Twenty-Five Years 
Later,” ibid., Vol. 45, No. 1 (Jan. 2003).

Properties of the Matrix Exponential Function
Theorem 7.	
Let A and B be n * n constant matrices and r, s, and t be real (or complex) 
numbers. Then,
(a)	 eA0 = e0 = I .
(b)	 eA1t+s2 = eAteAs .
(c)	 1eAt2-1 = e-At .
(d)	 e1A+B2t = eAteBt, provided that AB = BA .
(e)	 erIt = ertI .
Property (c) has profound implications. First, it asserts that for any matrix A, the matrix 
eAt has an inverse for all t. Moreover, this inverse is obtained by simply replacing t by -t. 
(Note that (c) follows from (a) and (b) with s = -t.) In applying property (d) (the law of  
exponents), one must exercise care because of the stipulation that the matrices A and B  
commute (see Problem 25).
Another important property of the matrix exponential arises from the fact that we can dif-
ferentiate the series in (2) term by term. This gives
 d

 1eAt2 = d

tn-1

2 + g + An-1  
tn-1
1n - 12! + g d  .
Hence,
d

 1eAt2 = AeAt ,
and so eAt is a solution to the matrix differential equation X′ = AX. Since eAt is invertible 
[property (c)], it follows that the columns of eAt are linearly independent solutions to system 
(1). Combining these facts we have the following.
eAt Is a Fundamental Matrix
Theorem 8.	
If A is an n * n constant matrix, then the columns of the matrix exponen-
tial eAt form a fundamental solution set for the system x′1t2 = Ax1t2. Therefore, eAt is 
a fundamental matrix for the system, and a general solution is x1t2 = eAtc.
If a fundamental matrix X1t2 for the system x′ = Ax has somehow been determined, it is 
easy to compute eAt, as the next theorem describes.
Relationship Between Fundamental Matrices
Theorem 9.	
Let X1t2 and Y1t2 be two fundamental matrices for the same system  
x′ = Ax. Then there exists a constant matrix C such that Y1t2 = X1t2C for all t. In particular,
(3)	
eAt = X1t2X102-1 .

Section 9.8    The Matrix Exponential Function          547
Proof.  Since X1t2 is a fundamental matrix, every column of Y1t2 can be expressed as 
X1t2c for a suitable constant vector c, so column-by-column we have

§ = X1t2C .
If we choose Y1t2 = eAt = X1t2C, then (3) follows by setting t = 0.  ◆
If the n * n matrix A has n linearly independent eigenvectors ui, then Theorem 5 of 
Section 9.5 (page 526) provides us with X(t) and (3) gives us
(4)	
eAt = 3er1tu1   er2tu2   g   erntun4 3u1   u2   g   un4-1 .
Are there any other ways that we can compute eAt? As we observed, if A is a diagonal 
matrix, then we simply exponentiate the diagonal elements of At to obtain eAt. Also, if A is a 
nilpotent matrix, that is, Ak = 0 for some positive integer k, then the series for eAt has only 
a finite number of terms—it “truncates”—since Ak = Ak+1 = g = 0. In such cases, eAt 
reduces to
eAt = I + At + g + Ak-1 
tk-1
1k - 12! + 0 + 0 + g = I + At + g + Ak-1 
t k-1
1k - 12!
  .
Thus eAt can be calculated in finite terms if A is diagonal or nilpotent. Can we take this any 
further? Yes; a consequence of the Cayley–Hamilton theorem† is that when the characteristic 
polynomial for A has the form p1r2 = 1r1 - r2n, then 1r1I - A2n = 0 = 1 -12n1A - r1I2n. 
So if A has only one (multiple) eigenvalue r1, then A - r1I is nilpotent, and we exploit that by 
writing A = r1I + A - r1I:
eAt = er1Ite1A-r1I2t = er1tc I + 1A - r1I2t + g + 1A - r1I2n-1 
tn-1
1n - 12! d  .
†The Cayley–Hamilton theorem states that a matrix satisfies its own characteristic equation, that is, p1A2 = 0. For a 
discussion of this theorem, see Fundamentals of Matrix Analysis with Applications, by Edward Barry Saff and Arthur 
David Snider (John Wiley & Sons, Hoboken, New Jersey, 2016), Section 6.3.

We are not through with nilpotency yet. What if we have a nonzero vector u, an exponent 
m, and a scalar r satisfying 1A - r I2m u = 0, so that A - r I is “nilpotent when restricted to 
u”? Such vectors are given a (predictable) name.
Generalized Eigenvectors
Definition 5.	 Let A be a square matrix. A nonzero vector u satisfying
(7)	
1A - rI2m u = 0
for some scalar r and some positive integer m is called a generalized eigenvector  
associated with r.
[Note that r must be an eigenvalue of A, since the final nonzero vector in the list  
u, 1A - rI2u, 1A - rI22 u, c, 1A - rI2m-1 u is a “regular” eigenvector.]
A valuable feature of generalized eigenvectors u is that we can compute eAtu in finite 
terms without knowing eAt, because
 eAt u = erIte1A-rI2t u
(8)	
= ertc Iu + t1A - rI2u + g+
tm-1
1m - 12!1A - rI2m-1 u + tm
m!1A - rI2m u + g d
	
= ertc u + t1A - rI2u + g+
tm-1
1m - 12!1A - rI2m-1 u +  0 + g d  .
Moreover, eAtu is a solution to the system x′ = Ax (recall Theorem 8). Hence if we can 
find n generalized eigenvectors ui for the n * n matrix A that are linearly independent, the 
­corresponding solutions xi1t2 = eAtui will form a fundamental solution set and can be assem-
bled into a fundamental matrix X1t2. (Since the xi’s are solutions that reduce to the linearly 
independent ui’s at t = 0, they are always linearly independent.) Finally, we get the matrix 
exponential by applying (3) from Theorem 9:
(9)	
eAt = X1t2X102-1 = 3eAtu1   eAtu2   g   eAtun4 3u1   u2   g   un4-1 ,
computed in a finite number of steps.
Of course, any (regular) eigenvector is a generalized eigenvector (corresponding to 
m = 1), and if A has a full set of n linearly independent eigenvectors, then (9) is simply 
the representation (4). But what if A is defective, that is, possesses fewer than n linearly 

Section 9.8    The Matrix Exponential Function          549
independent eigenvectors? Luckily, the primary decomposition theorem in advanced linear 
algebra* guarantees that when the characteristic polynomial of A is
(10)	
p1r2 = 1r1 - r2m11r2 - r2m2 g1rk - r2mk ,
where the ri ’s are the distinct eigenvalues of A and mi is the multiplicity of the eigenvalue ri, 
then for each i there exist mi linearly independent generalized eigenvectors satisfying
(11)	
1A - riI2mi u = 0 .
Furthermore, the conglomeration of these n = m1 + m2 + g + mk generalized eigenvectors 
is linearly independent.†
We’re home! The following scheme will always yield a fundamental solution set, for any 
square matrix A.
*See Fundamentals of Matrix Analysis with Applications, by Edward Barry Saff and Arthur David Snider (John Wiley 
& Sons, Hoboken, New Jersey, 2016), Section 7.3.
†Some of the generalized eigenvectors satisfy (11) with a lower exponent, but that will not affect the calculation.
‡With defective matrices this algorithm may prove ineffective for computer implementation; rounding effects inevitably 
foil the machine’s ability to detect multiple eigenvalues.

(a)	 Compute the characteristic polynomial p1r2 = 0 A - rI0 .
(b)	 Find the zeros of p1r2 and express it as p1r2 = 1r1 - r2m11r2 - r2m2 g1rk - r2mk, 
where r1, r2, c, rk are the distinct zeros (i.e., eigenvalues) and m1, m2, c, mk are 
their multiplicities.
(c)	 For each eigenvalue ri find mi linearly independent generalized eigenvectors by 
applying the Gauss–Jordan algorithm to the system 1A - riI2mi u = 0.
(d)	 Form n = m1 + m2 + g + mk linearly independent solutions to x′ = Ax by  
computing
x1t2 J eAtu = ertc u + t1A - rI2u + t2
2!1A - rI22 u + g d
for each generalized eigenvector u found in part (c) and corresponding eigenvalue r. 
If r has multiplicity m, this series terminates after m or fewer terms.
We can then, if desired, assemble the fundamental matrix X1t2 from the n solutions 
and obtain the matrix exponential eAt using (9).‡

Hence, the eigenvalues of A are r = 1 with multiplicity 2 and r = 3 with multiplicity 1.
Since r = 1 has multiplicity 2, we must determine two linearly independent associated 
generalized eigenvectors satisfying 1A - I22 u = 0. From

we find u2 = s, u1 = -2u2 = -2s, and u3 = y, where s and y are arbitrary.
Taking s = 0 and y = 1, we obtain the generalized eigenvector u1 = col10, 0, 12. The 
corresponding solution to (12) is

(u1 is, in fact, a regular eigenvector).
Next we take s = 1 and y = 0 to derive the second linearly independent generalized

Use of the fundamental matrix eAt simplifies many computations. For example, the prop-
erties eAte-As = eA1t-s2 and 1eAt02-1 = e-At0 enable us to rewrite the variation of parameters 
formula (13) in Section 9.7 (page 541) in a simpler form. Namely, the solution to the initial 
value problem x′ = Ax + f1t2, x1t02 = x0 is given by
(16)	
x1t2 = eA1t-t02x0 +
L
t

eA1t-s2f1s2ds ,
which is a system version of the formula for the solution to the scalar initial value problem 
x′ = ax + f1t2, x1t02 = x0.
In closing, we remark that the software packages for eigenvalue computation listed in 
Section 9.5 (page 524) also contain subroutines for computing the matrix exponential.
In Problems 1–6, (a) show that the given matrix A sat-
isfies 1A - rI2k = 0 for some number r and some positive 
integer k and (b) use this fact to determine the matrix eAt.

Chapter 9 Summary
In this chapter we discussed the theory of linear systems in normal form and presented ­methods 
for solving such systems. The theory and methods are natural extensions of the development 
for second-order and higher-order linear equations. The important properties and ­techniques 
are as follows.
Homogeneous Normal Systems
x′1t2 = A1t2x1t2
The n * n matrix function A1t2 is assumed to be continuous on an interval I.
Fundamental Solution Set: 5x1, c, xn6.    A set of n vector solutions x11t2, c, xn1t2 of 
the homogeneous system on the interval I form a fundamental solution set provided they are 
linearly independent on I or, equivalently, their Wronskian
W3x1, c, xn41t2 J det3x1, c, xn4 = ∞

g
x2,n1t2
f

is never zero on I.
Fundamental Matrix: X1t2.  An n * n matrix function X1t2 whose column vectors form 
a fundamental solution set for the homogeneous system is called a fundamental matrix. The 
determinant of X1t2 is the Wronskian of the fundamental solution set. Since the Wronskian is 
never zero on the interval I, then X-11t2 exists for t in I.

554          Chapter 9    Matrix Methods for Linear Systems
General Solution to Homogeneous System: Xc = c1x1 + g + cnxn.    If X1t2 is a funda-
mental matrix whose column vectors are x1, . . . , xn, then a general solution to the homogeneous 
system is
x1t2 = X1t2c = c1x11t2 + c2x21t2 + g + cnxn1t2 ,
where c = col1c1, c, cn2 is an arbitrary constant vector.
Homogeneous Systems with Constant Coefficients.  The form of a general solution for a 
homogeneous system with constant coefficients depends on the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of 
the n * n constant matrix A. An eigenvalue of A is a number r such that the system Au = ru 
has a nontrivial solution u, called an eigenvector of A associated with the eigenvalue r. Finding 
the eigenvalues of A is equivalent to finding the roots of the characteristic equation
0 A - rI0 = 0 .
The corresponding eigenvectors are found by solving the system 1A - rI2u = 0.
If the matrix A has n linearly independent eigenvectors u1, . . . , un and ri is the eigenvalue 
corresponding to the eigenvector ui, then
5er1tu1, er2tu2, c, erntun6
is a fundamental solution set for the homogeneous system. A class of matrices that always has 
n linearly independent eigenvectors is the set of symmetric matrices—that is, matrices that 
satisfy A = AT.
If A has complex conjugate eigenvalues a { ib and associated eigenvectors z = a { ib, 
where a and b are real vectors, then two linearly independent real vector solutions to the homo-
geneous system are
eat cos bt  a - eat sin bt  b ,  eat sin bt  a + eat cos bt  b .
When A has a repeated eigenvalue r of multiplicity m, then it is possible that A does not 
have n linearly independent eigenvectors. However, associated with r are m linearly indepen-
dent generalized eigenvectors that can be used to generate m linearly independent solutions to 
the homogeneous system (see page 548 under “Generalized Eigenvectors”).
Nonhomogeneous Normal Systems
x′1t2 = A1t2x1t2 + f1t2
The n * n matrix function A1t2 and the vector function f1t2 are assumed continuous on an 
interval I.
General Solution to Nonhomogeneous System: xp + Xc.    If xp1t2 is any particular solution 
for the nonhomogeneous system and X1t2 is a fundamental matrix for the associated homoge-
neous system, then a general solution for the nonhomogeneous system is
x1t2 = xp1t2 + X1t2c = xp1t2 + c1 x11t2 + g + cn xn1t2 ,
where x11t2, c, xn1t2 are the column vectors of X1t2 and c = col1c1, c, cn2 is an arbi-
trary constant vector.
Undetermined Coefficients.  If the nonhomogeneous term f1t2 is a vector whose compo-
nents are polynomials, exponential or sinusoidal functions, and A is a constant matrix, then 
one can use an extension of the method of undetermined coefficients to decide the form of a 
particular solution to the nonhomogeneous system.

Review Problems for Chapter 9          555
Variation of Parameters: X1t2Y1t2.    Let X1t2 be a fundamental matrix for the homoge-
neous system. A particular solution to the nonhomogeneous system is given by the variation 
of parameters formula
xp1t2 = X1t2Y1t2 = X1t2
L
X-11t2f1t2 dt .
Matrix Exponential Function
If A is a constant n * n matrix, then the matrix exponential function
eAt J I + At + A2 t2
2! + g + An tn
n! + g
is a fundamental matrix for the homogeneous system x′1t2 = Ax1t2. The matrix exponential 
has some of the same properties as the scalar exponential eat. In particular,
e0 = I ,  eA1t+s2 = eAteAs ,  1eAt2-1 = e-At .
If 1A - rI2k = 0 for some r and k, then the series for eAt has only a finite number of 
terms:
eAt = erteI + 1A - rI2t + g + 1A - rI2k-1 
tk-1
1k - 12! f .
The matrix exponential function eAt can also be computed from any fundamental matrix X1t2 
via the formula
eAt = X1t2X-1102 .
Generalized Eigenvectors
If an eigenvalue ri of a constant n * n matrix A has multiplicity mi there exist mi linearly in-
dependent generalized eigenvectors u satisfying 1A - riI2mi u = 0. Each such u determines a 
solution to the system x′ = Ax of the form
x1t2 = eri tc I + 1A - ri I2t + g+1A - riI2mi-1 
tmi-1
1mi - 12!
 d u
and the totality of all such solutions is linearly independent on 1 - ∞, ∞2 and forms a funda-
mental solution set for the system.
In Problems 1–4, find a general solution for the system 
x′1t2 = Ax1t2, where A is given.

The Laplace transform method for solving systems of linear differential equations with constant 
coefficients was discussed in Chapter 7. To apply the procedure for equations given in matrix 
form, we first extend the definition of the Laplace operator ℒ to a column vector of functions 
x = col1x11t2, c, xn1t22 by taking the transform of each component:
ℒ5x61s2 J col1ℒ5x161s2, c, ℒ5xn61s22 .
With this notation, the vector analogue of the important property relating the Laplace transform 
of the derivative of a function (see Theorem 4, Chapter 7, page 362) becomes
(6)	
ℒ5x′61s2 = sℒ5x61s2 - x102 .
Now suppose we are given the initial value problem
(7)	
x′ = Ax + f1t2  ,  x102 = x0 ,
where A is a constant n * n matrix. Let xn1s2 denote the Laplace transform of x1t2 and fn1s2 
denote the transform of f1t2. Then, taking the transform of the system and using the relation (6), 
we get
 ℒ5x′6 = ℒ5Ax + f6 ,
 sxn - x0 = Axn + fn .
Next we collect the xn terms and solve for xn by premultiplying by 1sI - A2-1:
 1sI - A2xn = fn + x0  ,
 xn = 1sI - A2-11fn + x02 .
Finally, we obtain the solution x1t2 by taking the inverse Laplace transform:
(8)	
x = ℒ-15xn6 = ℒ-151sI - A2-11fn + x026 .
In applying the matrix Laplace transform method, it is straightforward (but possibly tedious) 
to compute 1sI - A2-1, but the computation of the inverse transform may require some of the 
special techniques (such as partial fractions) discussed in Chapter 7.
(a)	 In the above procedure, we used the property that ℒ5Ax6 = Aℒ5x6 for any constant 
n * n matrix A. Show that this property follows from the linearity of the transform in 
the scalar case.

We have seen that the coupled mass–spring system depicted in Figure 9.5, page 536, is governed 
by equations (10) of Section 9.6, which we reproduce here:

CHAPTER

Partial Diﬀerential Equations
10.1 Introduction: A Model for Heat Flow
Suppose the wire is placed along the x-axis with x = 0 at the left end of the wire and x = L at 
the right end (see Figure 10.1). If we let u denote the temperature of the wire, then u depends 
on the time t and on the position x within the wire. (We will assume the wire is thin and hence u 
is constant throughout a cross section of the wire corresponding to a ﬁxed value of x.) Because 
the wire is insulated, we assume no heat enters or leaves through the sides of the wire.
To develop a model for heat ﬂow through the thin wire, let’s consider the small volume 
element V of wire between the two cross-sectional planes A and B that are perpendicular to the 
x-axis, with plane A located at x and plane B located at x + ∆x (see Figure 10.1).
The temperature on plane A at time t is u1x, t2 and on plane B is u1x + ∆x, t2. We will 
need the following principles of physics that describe heat ﬂow.†
1. Heat Conduction:  The rate of heat ﬂow (the amount of heat per unit time ﬂowing 
through a unit of cross-sectional area at A) is proportional to 0u>0x, the temperature 
gradient at A (Fick’s law). The proportionality constant k is called the thermal con-
ductivity of the material. In general, the thermal conductivity can vary from point to 
point: k = k1x2.
2. Direction of Heat Flow:  The direction of heat ﬂow is always from points of 
higher temperature to points of lower temperature.
Develop a model for the ﬂow of heat through a thin, insulated wire whose ends are 
kept at a constant temperature of 0°C and whose initial temperature distribution is 
to be speciﬁed.
†For a discussion of heat transfer, see University Physics with Modern Physics™, 13th ed., by H. D. Young and 
R. A. Freedman (Addison-Wesley, Reading, Mass., 2011).

Section 10.1  Introduction: A Model for Heat Flow     561
3. Speciﬁc Heat Capacity:  The amount of heat necessary to raise the temperature of 
an object of mass m by an amount ∆u is cm ∆u, where the constant c is the speciﬁc 
heat capacity of the material. The speciﬁc heat capacity, like the thermal conductiv-
ity, can vary with position: c = c1x2.
If we let H represent the amount of heat ﬂowing from left to right through the surface A 
during an interval of time ∆t, then the formula for heat conduction becomes
H1x2 = -k1x2 a ∆t 0u
0x
 1x, t2 ,
where a is the cross-sectional area of the wire. The negative sign follows from the second 
principle—if 0u>0x is positive, then heat ﬂows from right to left (hotter to colder).
Similarly, the amount of heat ﬂowing from left to right across plane B during an interval 
of time ∆t is
H1x + ∆x2 = -k1x + ∆x2 a ∆t 0u
0x
 1x + ∆x, t2  .
The net change in the heat ∆E in volume V is the amount entering at end A minus the 
amount leaving at end B, plus any heat generated by sources (such as electric currents, chemi-
cal reactions, heaters, etc.). The latter is modeled by a term Q1x, t2∆x a ∆t, where Q is the 
energy rate (power) density. Therefore,
(1) 
 ∆E = H1x2 - H1x + ∆x2 + Q1x, t2∆x a ∆t
 = a ∆t  c k1x + ∆x2 0u
0x 
 1x + ∆x, t2 - k1x2 0u
0x
 1x, t2 d + Q1x, t2∆x   a ∆t .
Now by the third principle, the net change is given by ∆E = cm ∆u, where ∆u is the 
change in temperature and c is the speciﬁc heat capacity. If we assume that the change in 
temperature in the volume V is essentially equal to the change in temperature at x—that is, 
∆u = u1x, t + ∆t2 - u1x, t2, and that the mass of the volume V of wire is a  r ∆x, where 
r = r1x2 is the density of the wire, then
(2) 
∆E = c1x2ar1x2 ∆x 3u1x, t + ∆t2 - u1x, t24 .
Equating the two expressions for ∆E given in equations (1) and (2) yields
a ∆t c k1x + ∆x2 0u
0x
 1x + ∆x, t2 - k1x2 0u
0x
 1x, t2 d + Q1x, t2 ∆x  a ∆t
= c1x2a  r1x2 ∆x 3u1x, t + ∆t2 - u1x, t24 .
Now dividing both sides by a ∆x ∆t and then taking the limits as ∆x and ∆t approach zero, 
we obtain
(3) 
0
0xck1x2 0u
0x
 1x, t2 d + Q1x, t2 = c1x2r1x2 0u
0t
 1x, t2 .
If the physical parameters k, c, and r are uniform along the length of the wire, then (3) reduces 
to the one-dimensional heat ﬂow equation
(4) 
0u
0t
 1x, t2 = b 02u

where the positive constant b J k>1cr2 is the diﬀusivity of the material and P1x, t2 J
Q1x, t2>1cr2.

562     Chapter 10  Partial Differential Equations
Equation (4) governs the ﬂow of heat in the wire. We have two other constraints in our 
original problem. First, we are keeping the ends of the wire at 0°C. Thus, we require that
(5) 
u10, t2 = u1L, t2 = 0
for all t. These are called boundary conditions. Second, we must be given the initial tempera-
ture distribution f1x2. That is, we require
(6) 
u1x, 02 = f1x2 ,  0 6 x 6 L .
Equation (6) is referred to as the initial condition on u.
Combining equations (4), (5), and (6), we have the following mathematical model for the 
heat ﬂow in a uniform wire without internal sources 1P = 02 whose ends are kept at the con-
stant temperature 0°C:
(7)

et
 1x, t2 = B e2u
ex2 1x, t2 ,  0 6 x 6 L ,  t 7 0 ,
(8) 
 u10, t2 = u1L, t2 = 0 ,  t 7 0 ,
(9) 
 u1x, 02 = f1x2 ,
  0 6 x 6 L .
This model is an example of an initial-boundary value problem. Intuitively we expect that 
equations (7)–(9) completely and unambiguously specify the temperature in the wire. Once we 
have found a function u1x, t2 that meets all three of these conditions, we can be assured that u 
is the temperature. (Theorem 7 in Section 10.5, page 602, will bear this out.)
In higher dimensions, the heat ﬂow equation (or just heat equation) is adjusted to account 
for the additional heat ﬂow contribution along the other axes by the simple modiﬁcation
0u
0t = b ∆u + P1x, y, z, t2 ,
where ∆u, known as the Laplacian in this context,† is deﬁned in two and three dimensions, 
respectively, as
∆u J 02u
0x2 + 02u
0y2  and  ∆u J 02u
0x2 + 02u
0y2 + 02u
0z2 .
When the temperature reaches a steady state—that is, when u does not depend on time, 
and there are no sources—then 0u>0t = 0 and the temperature satisﬁes Laplace’s equation
∆u = 0 .
One classical technique for solving the initial-boundary value problem for the heat equation 
(7)–(9) is the method of separation of variables, which eﬀectively allows us to replace the partial 
diﬀerential equation by ordinary diﬀerential equations. This technique is discussed in the next sec-
tion. In using separation of variables, one is often required to express a given function as a trigono-
metric series. Such series are called Fourier series; their properties are discussed in Sections 10.3 
and 10.4. We devote the remaining three sections to the three basic partial diﬀerential equations that 
arise most commonly in applications: the heat equation, the wave equation, and Laplace’s equation.
Many computer-based algorithms for solving partial diﬀerential equations have been devel-
oped. These are based on ﬁnite diﬀerences, ﬁnite elements, variational principles, and projection 
methods that include the method of moments and its wavelet-based implementations. Like the 
Runge–Kutta or Euler methods for ordinary diﬀerential equations, such techniques are more uni-
versally applicable than the analytic procedures of separation of variables, but their accuracy is 
often diﬃcult to assess. Indeed, it is customary practice to gauge any newly proposed numerical 
procedure by comparing its predictions with those of separation of variables.
†Regrettably, it is the same notation as we just used for u1x, t + ∆t2 - u1x, t2. Some authors prefer the symbol ∇2 for 
the Laplacian.

Section 10.2  Method of Separation of Variables     563
The method of separation of variables is a classical technique that is eﬀective in solving several 
types of partial diﬀerential equations. The idea is roughly the following. We think of a solution, 
say u1x, t2, to a partial diﬀerential equation as being a linear combination of simple compo-
nent functions un1x, t2, n = 0, 1, 2, c, which also satisfy the equation and certain boundary 
conditions. (This is a reasonable assumption provided the partial diﬀerential equation and the 
boundary conditions are linear.) To determine a component solution, un1x, t2, we assume it can 
be written with its variables separated; that is, as
un1x, t2 = Xn1x2Tn1t2 .
Substituting this form for a solution into the partial diﬀerential equation and using the bound-
ary conditions leads, in many circumstances, to two ordinary diﬀerential equations for the 
unknown functions Xn1x2 and Tn1t2. In this way we have reduced the problem of solving a 
partial diﬀerential equation to the more familiar problem of solving a diﬀerential equation that 
involves only one variable. In this section we will illustrate this technique for the heat equation 
and the wave equation.
In the previous section we derived the following initial-boundary value problem as a math-
ematical model for the sourceless heat ﬂow in a uniform wire whose ends are kept at the con-
stant temperature zero:
(1) 
 eu
et
 1x, t2 = B e2u
ex2 1x, t2 ,  0 6 x 6 L ,  t 7 0 ,
(2) 
 u10, t2 = u1L, t2 = 0 ,  t 7 0 ,
(3) 
 u1x, 02 = f1x2 ,
  0 6 x 6 L .
To solve this problem by the method of separation of variables, we begin by addressing 
equation (1). We propose that it has solutions of the form
u1x, t2 = X1x2T1t2 ,
where X is a function of x alone and T is a function of t alone. To determine X and T, we ﬁrst 
compute the partial derivatives of u to obtain
0u
0t = X1x2T ′1t2  and  02u
0x2 = X″1x2T1t2 .
Substituting these expressions into (1) gives
X1x2T ′1t2 = bX″1x2T1t2 ,
and separating variables yields
(4) 
T ′1t2
bT1t2 = X″1x2
X1x2  .
We now observe that the functions on the left-hand side of (4) depend only on t, while those 
on the right-hand side depend only on x. If we ﬁx t and vary x, the ratio on the right cannot 
change; it must be constant. Most authors deﬁne this constant with a minus sign, so we adhere 
to the convention:
X″1x2
X1x2 = -l  and  T ′1t2
bT1t2 = -l ,
10.2 Method of Separation of Variables

564     Chapter 10  Partial Differential Equations
or
(5) 
X″1x2 = −LX1x2 and T ′1t2 = −LBT1t2 .
Consequently, for separable solutions, we have reduced the problem of solving the partial dif-
ferential equation (1) to solving the two ordinary diﬀerential equations in (5).
Next we consider the boundary conditions in (2). Since u1x, t2 = X1x2T1t2, these condi-
tions are
X102T1t2 = 0  and  X1L2T1t2 = 0 ,  t 7 0 .
Hence, either T1t2 = 0 for all t 7 0, which implies that u1x, t2 K 0, or
(6) 
X102 = X1L2 = 0 .
Ignoring the trivial solution u1x, t2 K 0, we combine the boundary conditions in (6) with the 
diﬀerential equation for X in (5) and obtain the boundary value problem
(7) 
X″1x2 + lX1x2 = 0 ,   X102 = X1L2 = 0 ,
where l can be any constant.
Notice that the function X1x2 K 0 is a solution of (7) for every l. Depending on the choice 
of l, this may be the only solution to the boundary value problem (7). Thus, if we seek a non-
trivial solution u1x, t2 = X1x2T1t2 to (1)–(2), we must ﬁrst determine those values of l for 
which the boundary value problem (7) has nontrivial solutions. These solutions are called the 
eigenfunctions of the problem; the eigenvalues are the special values of l. If we write the ﬁrst 
equation in (7) as -D23X4 = lX and compare with the matrix eigenvector equation Au = r u 
(Section 9.5, page 523), the designation of l as an eigenvalue (of -D2) becomes clear.
To solve the (constant-coeﬃcient) equation in (7), we try X1x2 = erx, derive the auxiliary 
equation r2 + l = 0, and consider three cases.
Case 1. l 6 0. In this case, the roots of the auxiliary equation are { 1-l, so a general 
solution to the diﬀerential equation in (7) is
X1x2 = C1e1-l x + C2e-1-l x .
To determine C1 and C2, we appeal to the boundary conditions:
X102 = C1 + C2 = 0 ,
X1L2 = C1e1-l L + C2e-1-l L = 0 .
From the ﬁrst equation, we see that C2 = -C1. The second equation can then be written 
as C11e1-l L - e-1-l L2 = 0 or C11e21-l L - 12 = 0. Since -l 7 0, it follows that 
1e21-l L - 12 7 0. Therefore C1, and hence C2, is zero. Consequently, there is no nontrivial 
solution to (7) for l 6 0.
Case 2. l = 0. Here r = 0 is a repeated root to the auxiliary equation, and a general 
solution to the diﬀerential equation is
X1x2 = C1 + C2 x .
The boundary conditions in (7) yield C1 = 0 and C1 + C2 L = 0, which imply that 
C1 = C2 = 0. Thus, for l = 0, there is no nontrivial solution to (7).
Case 3. l 7 0. In this case the roots of the auxiliary equation are {i1l. Thus a general 
solution to X″ + l X = 0 is
(8) 
X1x2 = C1 cos 1l x + C2 sin 1l x .

Section 10.2  Method of Separation of Variables     565
This time the boundary conditions X102 = X1L2 = 0 give the system
 C1 = 0 ,
 C1 cos 1l L + C2 sin 1l L = 0 .
Because C1 = 0, the system reduces to solving C2 sin 1lL = 0. Hence, either sin 1lL = 0
or C2 = 0. Now sin 1lL = 0 only when 1lL = np, where n is an integer. Therefore, (7) 
has a nontrivial solution 1C2 ≠02 when 1lL = np or l = 1np>L22, n = 1, 2, 3, c (we 
exclude n = 0, since it makes l = 0). Furthermore, the nontrivial solutions (eigenfunctions) 
Xn corresponding to the eigenvalue l = 1np>L22 are given by [cf. (8)]
(9) 
Xn1x2 = an sina npx
L b ,
where the an’s are arbitrary nonzero constants.
The eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for this example have many features that are common 
to all of the separation of variables solutions that we will study. Take note of these features of

EIGENFUNCTION PROPERTIES
(i) The eigenfunctions are solutions to a second-order ordinary 
diﬀerential equation (7) containing a parameter l called the 
eigenvalue.
 
(ii)  Each eigenfunction satisﬁes a homogeneous boundary condition 
at each end (7).
 
(iii)  The only values of l that admit nontrivial solutions, i.e., the 
 eigenvalues, form an inﬁnite set accumulating at ∞.
 
(iv)  The eigenfunctions oscillate faster as l increases; the ﬁrst contains 
no interior zeros, and each subsequent eigenfunction contains one 
more zero than its predecessor.
 
(v)  If any two distinct eigenfunctions are multiplied together, the 
resulting function is zero on the average; speciﬁcally,

and both cosines integrate to 0 over 30, L4.
Having determined that l = 1np>L22 for any positive integer n, let’s consider the second 
equation in (5):
T ′1t2 + b a np
L b
2
T1t2 = 0 .
For each n = 1, 2, 3, c, a general solution to this linear ﬁrst-order equation is
Tn1t2 = bn e-b1np>L22t .

566     Chapter 10  Partial Differential Equations
(Note that the time factor has none of the eigenfunction properties.) Combining this with equa-
tion (9) we obtain, for each n = 1, 2, 3, c, the functions
(10) 
 un1x, t2 J Xn1x2Tn1t2 = an sin1npx>L2 bn e-b1np>L22t
 = cn e-b1np>L22t sin1npx>L2 ,
where cn is also an arbitrary constant.
It is easy to see that each un1x, t2 is a solution to (1)–(2). A simple computation also 
shows that if un and um are solutions to (1)–(2), then so is any linear combination aun + bum.
(This is a consequence of the facts that the operator L J 0>0t - b02>0x2 is a linear operator 
and the boundary conditions in (2) are linear homogeneous.)
This enables us to solve the following example.
Example 1

t 7 0 ,
(13) 
 u1x, 02 = 3 sin 2x - 6 sin 5x , 
0 6 x 6 p .
Solution
Comparing equation (11) with (1), we see that b = 7 and L = p. Hence, we need only ﬁnd a 
combination of terms like (10) that satisﬁes the initial condition (13):
u1x, 02 = a cn e0 sin nx = 3 sin 2x - 6 sin 5x.
For these data the task is simple; c2 = 3 and c5 = -6. The solution to the heat ﬂow problem 
(11)–(13) is
 u1x, t2 = c2e-b12p>L22t sin12px>L2 + c5e-b15p>L22t sin15px>L2
 = 3e-28t sin 2x - 6e-175t sin 5x . ◆
What would we do if the initial condition (13) had been an arbitrary function, rather 
than a simple combination of a few of the eigenfunctions we found? Possibly the most beau-
tiful property of the eigenfunctions—one that we did not list on page 565—is  completeness; 
virtually any function f likely to arise in applications can be expressed as a convergent 
series of eigenfunctions! For the sines we have been working with, the Fourier sine series
looks like

For now, let us turn to the mathematical description of a vibrating string, another situation in 
which the separation of variables approach applies. This concerns the transverse vibrations 
of a string stretched between two points, such as a guitar string or piano wire. The goal is 
to ﬁnd a function u1x, t2 that gives the displacement (deﬂection) of the string at any point 

Section 10.2  Method of Separation of Variables     567
x 10 … x … L2 and any time t Ú 0 (see Figure 10.3). In developing the mathematical model, 
we assume that the string is perfectly ﬂexible and has constant linear density, the tension on 
the string is  constant, gravity is negligible, and no other forces are acting on the string. Under 
these conditions and the additional assumption that the displacements u1x, t2 are small in 
comparison to the length of the string, it turns out that the motion of the string is governed by 
the  following initial-boundary value problem.†

Equation (16) essentially states Newton’s third law, F = ma, for the string. The second 
(time) derivative on the left is the acceleration, and the second (spatial) derivative on the right 
arises because the restoring force is produced by the string’s curvature. The constant a2 is 
strictly positive and equals the ratio of the tension to the (linear) density of the string. The 
physical signiﬁcance of a, which has units of velocity, will be revealed in Section 10.6. The 
boundary conditions in (17) reﬂect the fact that the string is held ﬁxed at the two endpoints  
x = 0 and x = L. Equations (18) and (19), respectively, specify the initial displacement of the 
string and the initial velocity of each point on the string. Recall that these are the typical initial 
data for all mechanical systems. For the initial and boundary conditions to be consistent, we 
assume f102 = f1L2 = 0 and g102 = g1L2 = 0.
Let’s apply the method of separation of variables to the initial-boundary value problem for 
the vibrating string (16)–(19). Thus, we begin by assuming equation (16) has a solution of the 
form
u1x, t2 = X1x2T1t2 ,
where X is a function of x alone and T is a function of t alone. Diﬀerentiating u, we obtain
02u
0 t2 = X1x2T ″1t2 ,  02u
0 x2 = X″1x2T1t2 .
Substituting these expressions into (16), we have
X1x2T″1t2 = a2X″1x2T1t2 ,

and separating variables gives
T ″1t2
a2T1t2 = X″1x2
X1x2  .
Just as before, these ratios must equal some constant -l:
(20) 
 
X″1x2
X1x2 = -L  and   
T ″1t2
A2T1t2 = -L .
Furthermore, with u1x, t2 = X1x2T1t2, the boundary conditions in (17) give
X102T1t2 = 0 ,  X1L2T1t2 = 0 ,  t Ú 0 .
In order for these equations to hold for all t Ú 0, either T1t2 K 0, which implies that 
u1x, t2 K 0, or
X102 = X1L2 = 0 .
Ignoring the trivial solution, we combine these boundary conditions with the diﬀerential equation 
for X in (20) and obtain the boundary value problem
(21) 
X″1x2 + lX1x2 = 0 ,  X102 = X1L2 = 0 ,
where l can be any constant.
This is the same boundary value problem that we encountered earlier while solving the 
heat equation. There we found that the suitable values for l are
l = a np

with corresponding eigenfunctions (nontrivial solutions)
(22) 
Xn1x2 = cn sina npx

where the cn’s are arbitrary nonzero constants. Recall Figure 10.2, page 565.
Having determined that l = 1np>L22 for some positive integer n, let’s consider the  
second equation in (20) for such l:
T ″1t2 + a2n2p2
L2
 T1t2 = 0 .
For each n = 1, 2, 3, c, a general solution is
Tn1t2 = cn,1 cos npa
L
 t + cn,2 sin npa
L

Combining this with equation (22), we obtain, for each n = 1, 2, 3, c, the function
un1x, t2 = Xn1x2Tn1t2 = acn sin npx
L b acn,1 cos npa
L

or, reassembling the constants,
(23) 
un1x, t2 = aan cos npa

Section 10.2  Method of Separation of Variables     569
Using the fact that linear combinations of solutions to (16)–(17) are again solutions, we 
consider a superposition of the functions in (23):
(24) 
u1x, t2 = a

f1x2 = a

n = 1

where Bn = 1npa>L2bn. If we choose the an’s and bn’s so that the equations in (25) and (26) 
hold, then the expansion for u1x, t2 in (24) is a formal solution to the vibrating string problem 
(16)–(19). If this expansion is ﬁnite, or converges to a function with continuous second partial 
derivatives, then the formal solution is an actual (genuine) solution.

Solution
Comparing equation (28) with equation (16), we see that a = 2 and L = p. Hence, we need 
only determine the values of the coeﬃcients an and bn in formula (24). The an’s are chosen so 
that equation (25) holds; that is,
u1x, 02 = sin 3x - 4 sin 10 x = a

n = 1
 an sin nx .
Equating coeﬃcients of like terms, we see that
a3 = 1 ,  a10 = -4 ,
and the remaining an’s are zero. Similarly, referring to equation (26), we must choose the bn’s 
so that
0 u
0 t
 1x, 02 = 2 sin 4x + sin 6x = a

and the remaining bn’s are zero. Hence, from formula (24), the solution to the vibrating string 
problem (28)–(31) is

In later sections the method of separation of variables is used to study a wide variety of 
problems for the heat, wave, and Laplace’s equations. However, to use the method eﬀectively, 
one must be able to compute trigonometric series (or, more generally, eigenfunction expan-
sions) such as the Fourier sine series that we encountered here. These expansions are discussed 
in the next two sections.
In Problems 1– 8, determine all the solutions, if any, to the 
given boundary value problem by ﬁrst ﬁnding a general solu-

While analyzing heat ﬂow and vibrating strings in the previous section, we encountered the 
problem of expressing a function in a trigonometric series [compare equations (12) and (25) in 
Section 10.2]. In the next two sections, we discuss the theory of Fourier series, which deals with 
trigonometric series expansions. First, however, we review some function properties that are 
particularly relevant to this study: piecewise continuity, periodicity, and even and odd symmetry.
In Section 7.2 we deﬁned a piecewise continuous function on 3a, b4 as a function f that 
is continuous at every point in 3a, b4, except possibly for a ﬁnite number of points at which f 
has a jump discontinuity. Such functions are necessarily integrable over any ﬁnite interval on 
which they are piecewise continuous.
10.3 Fourier Series

572     Chapter 10  Partial Differential Equations
Recall also that a function is periodic of period T if f1x + T2 = f1x2 for all x in the 
domain of f. The smallest positive value of T is called the fundamental period. The trigono-
metric functions sin x and cos x are examples of periodic functions with fundamental period 2p 
and tan x is periodic with fundamental period p. A constant function is a periodic function with 
arbitrary period T.
Two symmetry properties of functions will be useful in the study of Fourier series. A func-
tion f that satisﬁes f1 -x2 = f1x2 for all x in the domain of f has a graph that is symmetric with 
respect to the y-axis [see Figure 10.4(a)]. We say that such a function is even. A function f that 
satisﬁes f1 -x2 = -f1x2 for all x in the domain of f has a graph that is symmetric with respect 
to the origin [see Figure 10.4(b)]. It is said to be an odd function. The functions 1, x2, x4, . . . 
are examples of even functions, while the functions x, x3, x5, . . . are odd. The trigonometric 
functions sin x and tan x are odd functions and cos x is an even function.

Determine whether the given function is even, odd, or neither.
(a) f1x2 = 21 + x2  
(b) g1x2 = x1>3 - sin x  
(c) h1x2 = ex 
Solution
(a) Since f1 -x2 = 21 + 1 -x22 = 21 + x2 = f1x2, then f1x2 is an even function.
(b) Because g1 -x2 = 1 -x21>3 - sin 1 -x2 = -x1>3 + sin x = -1x1>3 - sin x2 = -g1x2,  
it follows that g1x2 is an odd function.
(c) Here h1 -x2 = e-x. Since e-x = ex only when x = 0 and e-x is never equal to -ex, 
then h1x2 is neither an even nor an odd function. ◆
Knowing that a function is even or odd can be useful in evaluating deﬁnite integrals. The 
following result, illustrated in Figure 10.4, is a straightforward consequence of the deﬁnition of 
the deﬁnite integral.

Thus if m ≠n, each of the integrals calls for the (signed) area under an oscillating sinusoid 
over a whole number of periods, and is therefore zero. In fact, the only way to avoid these 
“oscillators” is to take m = n; whence cos31m - n2px>L4 = cos 0 = 1 and subtends an area 
of 2L, while sin31m - n2px>L4 = sin 0 = 0 subtending zero area (again). But note that if 
m and n are both zero, then cos31m + n2px>L4 = cos 0 also subtends area 2L. Restoring the

ric functions 51 = cos 0x,  cos x,  sin x,  cos 2x,  sin 2x, c6, where L = p. We will say more 
about this later in this section.
It is easy to verify that if each of the functions f1, c, fn is periodic of period T, then so is 
any linear combination
c1 f11x2 + g + cn fn1x2 .
For example, the sum 7 + 3 cos px - 8 sin px + 4 cos 2px - 6 sin 2px has period 2, since 
each term has period 2. Furthermore, if the inﬁnite series

consisting of 2L-periodic functions converges for all x, then the function to which it converges 
will be periodic of period 2L.
Just as we can associate a Taylor series with a function that has derivatives of all orders 
at a ﬁxed point, we can identify a particular trigonometric series with a piecewise continuous 
function. To illustrate this, let’s assume that f1x2 has the series expansion‡

(3)–(5) look like dot products (Section 9.1, page 496) of higher-dimensional vectors. In most calculus texts, it is shown 
that the dot product of orthogonal vectors in two dimensions is zero.
‡The choice of constant a0>2 instead of just a0 will be motivated shortly.

Formulas (9) and (10) are called the Euler-Fourier formulas. We use the symbol ∼ in 
(8) to remind us that this series is associated with f1x2 but may not converge to f1x2. We will 
return to the question of convergence later in this section. Let’s ﬁrst consider a few examples 
of Fourier series.

†Historical Footnote: Joseph B. J. Fourier (1768–1830) developed his series for solving heat ﬂow problems. Lagrange 
expressed doubts about the validity of the representation, but Dirichlet devised conditions that ensured its convergence. 
Note that the notational choice of a0>2 in equation (6) made it unnecessary to insert an extra formula for a0 in (9).
‡Notice that f1x2 need not be deﬁned for every x in 3-L, L4; we need only that the integrals in (9) and (10) exist.

In Example 4 the odd function f has a Fourier series consisting only of sine functions. It is 
easy to see that, in general, if f is any odd function, then its Fourier series consists only of sine 
terms.

Section 10.3  Fourier Series     579
Notice that the even function f of Example 5 has a Fourier series consisting only of cosine 
functions and the constant function 1 = cos10px2. In general, if f is an even function, then its 
Fourier series consists only of cosine functions [including cos10px2].
Orthogonal Expansions
Fourier series are examples of orthogonal expansions.† A set of functions 5fn1x26 ∞
n = 1 is said 
to be an orthogonal system or just orthogonal with respect to the nonnegative weight func-
tion w1x2 on the interval 3a, b4 if
(14) 
L
b
a
 fm1x2 fn1x2w1x2 dx = 0 ,    whenever  m ≠n .
As we have seen, the set of trigonometric functions
(15) 
51, cos x, sin x, cos 2x, sin 2x, c6
is orthogonal on 3 -p, p4 with respect to the weight function w1x2 K 1. If we deﬁne the 
norm of f as
(16) 
‘ f ‘ J c
L
b
a
 f 21x2 w1x2 dxd
1>2
 ,
then we say that a set of functions 5fn1x26 ∞
n = 1 1or 5fn1x26 N
n = 12 is an orthonormal system 
with respect to w1x2 if (14) holds and also ‘ fn‘ = 1 for each n. Equivalently, we say the set 
is an orthonormal system if
(17) 
L
b
a
 fm1x2 fn1x2w1x2 dx = e0 , 
m ≠n ,
1 , 
m = n .
We can always obtain an orthonormal system from an orthogonal system just by dividing each 
function by its norm. In particular, since
L
p
-p
 cos2nx dx =
L
p
-p
 sin2nx dx = p ,  n = 1, 2, 3, c
and
L
p
-p
 1 dx = 2p ,
then the orthogonal system (15) gives rise on 3 -p, p4 to the orthonormal system
512p2-1>2,  p-1>2 cos x,  p-1>2 sin x,  p-1>2 cos 2x,  p-1>2 sin 2x, c6 .
If 5fn1x26 ∞
n = 1 is an orthogonal system with respect to w1x2 on 3a, b4, we might ask if 
we can expand a function f1x2 in terms of these functions; that is, can we express f in the form
(18) 
f1x2 = c1 f11x2 + c2 f21x2 + c3 f31x2 + g
for a suitable choice of constants c1, c2, c? Such an expansion is called an orthogonal 
expansion, or a generalized Fourier series.
†Orthogonality is also discussed in Section 8.8 on page 474.

580     Chapter 10  Partial Differential Equations
To determine the constants in (18), we can proceed as we did in deriving Euler’s for-
mulas for the coeﬃcients of a Fourier series, this time using the orthogonality of the sys-
tem. Presuming the representation (18) is valid, we multiply by fm1x2w1x2 and integrate to 
obtain

(Here we have also assumed that we can integrate term by term.) Because the system is orthog-
onal with respect to w1x2, every integral on the right-hand side of (19) is zero except when 
n = m. Solving for cm gives
(20)

The derivation of the formula for cm was only formal, since the question of the con-
vergence of the expansion in (18) was not answered. If the series g ∞
n = 1 cn fn1x2 converges 
 uniformly to f1x2 on 3a, b4, then each step can be justiﬁed, and indeed, the coeﬃcients are 
given by formula (20). The notion of uniform convergence is discussed in the next subsection 
and in Section 13.2.†
Convergence of Fourier Series
Let’s turn to the question of the convergence of a Fourier series. For Example 5 it 
is possible to use a comparison or limit comparison test to show that the series is 
absolutely dominated by a p-series of the form g ∞
n = 1 1>n2, which converges. How-
ever, this is much harder to do in Example 4, since the terms go to zero like 1>n. 
Matters can be even worse, since there exist Fourier series that diverge.‡ We state 
two theorems that deal with the convergence of a Fourier series and two dealing with  
the properties of termwise diﬀerentiation and integration. For proofs of these results, see 
Partial Diﬀerential Equations of Mathematical Physics, 2nd ed., by Tyn Myint-U (Elsevier 
North Holland, Inc., New York, 1983), Chapter 5; Advanced Calculus with Applications, by  
N. J. DeLillo (Macmillan, New York, 1982), Chapter 9; or an advanced text on the theory 
of Fourier series.
Before proceeding, we need a notation for the left- and right-hand limits of a function. 
Let
f1x+2J lim
hS0 + f1x + h2  and  f1x-2 J
lim
hS0 + f1x - h2 .
We now present the fundamental pointwise convergence theorem for Fourier series. While 
reading it, keep in mind Figures 10.6-10.8 .
†All references to Chapters 11–13 refer to the expanded text, Fundamentals of Diﬀerential Equations and Boundary 
Value Problems, 7th ed.

Section 10.3  Fourier Series     581
In other words, when f  and f′ are piecewise continuous on 3 -L, L4, the Fourier series 
converges to f1x2 whenever f is continuous at x and converges to the average of the left- and 
right-hand limits at points where f is discontinuous.
Observe that the left-hand side of (21) is periodic of period 2L. This means that if we 
extend f1x2 from the interval 1 -L, L2 to the entire real line using 2L-periodicity, then equa-
tion (21) holds for all x for the 2L-periodic extension of f1x2.

23f1-L+2 + f1L-24 .†
†From formula (21), we see that it doesn’t matter how we deﬁne f1x2 at its points of discontinuity, since only the 
left-and right-hand limits are involved. The derivative f ′1x2, of course, is undeﬁned at such points.

To which function does the Fourier series for

Solution
In Example 4 we found that the Fourier series for f1x2 is given by (12), and in Figure 10.7, 
we sketched the graphs of two of its partial sums. Now f1x2 and f′1x2 are piecewise continu-
ous in 3 -p, p4. Moreover, f is continuous except at x = 0. Thus, by Theorem 2, the Fou-
rier series of f in (12) converges to the 2p-periodic function g1x2, where g1x2 = f1x2 = -1
for -p 6 x 6 0,  g1x2 = f1x2 = 1 for 0 6 x 6 p,  g102 = 3f10+2 + f10-24>2 = 0, and at 
{p we have g1 {p2 = 3f1 -p+2 + f1p-24>2 = 1 -1 + 12>2 = 0. The graph of g1x2 is 
given in Figure 10.9. ◆

When f is a 2L-periodic function that is continuous on 1 - ∞, ∞2 and has a piecewise 
continuous derivative, its Fourier series not only converges at each point—it converges 
uniformly on 1 - ∞, ∞2. This means that for any prescribed tolerance e 7 0, the graph of

when one needs to verify that a formal solution to a partial diﬀerential equation is an actual 
(genuine) solution.

Uniform Convergence of Fourier Series
Theorem 3. 
Let  f  be a continuous function on 1 - ∞, ∞2 and periodic of period 2L.  
If f ′ is piecewise continuous on 3 -L, L4, then the Fourier series for f converges  
uniformly to f on 3 -L, L4 and hence on any interval. That is, for each e 7 0, there  
exists an integer N0 (that depends on e) such that

In Example 5 we obtained the Fourier series expansion given in (13) for f1x2 = 0 x0 , 
-1 6 x 6 1. Since g1x2, the periodic extension of f1x2 (see Figure 10.11 on page 583) is 
continuous on 1 - ∞, ∞2 and
f ′1x2 = e
-1 , 
-1 6 x 6 0 ,

0 6 x 6 1 ,
is piecewise continuous on 3 -1, 14, the Fourier series expansion (13) converges uniformly to 
0 x0  on 3 -1, 14. Compare Figure 10.8 on page 578.
The term-by-term diﬀerentiation of a Fourier series is not always permissible. For 
 example, the Fourier series for f1x2 = x, -p 6 x 6 p (see Problem 9), is

Let f1x2 be continuous on 1 - ∞, ∞2 and 2L-periodic. Let f ′1x2 and

A ﬁnal note on the convergence issue: The question as to under what conditions the Fou-
rier series converges has led to a tremendous amount of beautiful mathematics. As a practical 
matter, however, time and economics will often dictate that you can aﬀord to compute only a 
few terms of an eigenfunction series for your particular partial diﬀerential equation. Conver-
gence fades into the background, and you need to know how to “do the best with what you’ve 
got.” So it is extremely gratifying to know that even if you’re going to use only part of an 
eigenfunction expansion, the Fourier coeﬃcients (9)–(10) are still the best choice; Problem 37 
demonstrates that every partial sum of a Fourier series outperforms any comparable superposi-
tion of the trigometric functions, in terms of mean-square approximation.
In Problems 1– 6, determine whether the given function is 
even, odd, or neither.
In Problems 17–24, determine the function to which the 
Fourier series for f1x2, given in the indicated problem,  
converges.

that the ﬁrst three Legendre polynomials are
P01x2 K 1 , P11x2 = x , P21x2 = 13>22x2 - 11>22 ,

 (c)  ‘ f + g‘ … ‘ f ‘ + ‘g‘ .
35. Inner Product. The integral in the orthogonality con-

 (a)  8f + g, h9 = 8f, h9 + 8g, h9 .
(b)  8cf, h9 = c8f, h9, where c is any real number.
 
 (c)  8f, g9 = 8g, f9 .
36. Complex Form of the Fourier Series.

39. Gibbs Phenomenon.† Josiah Willard Gibbs, who was 
awarded the ﬁrst American doctorate in engineering 
(Yale, 1863), observed that near points of discontinuity 
of f, the partial sums of the Fourier series for f may over-
shoot by approximately 9% of the jump, regardless of 
the number of terms. This is illustrated in Figure 10.12 
for the function
f1x2 = e

-p 6 x 6 0 ,

0 6 x 6 p ,
†Historical Footnote: Actually, H. Wilbraham discovered this phenomenon some 50 years earlier than Gibbs did. It is 
more appropriately called the Gibbs–Wilbraham phenomenon.

to f10+2.
A typical problem encountered in using separation of variables to solve a partial diﬀerential 
equation is the problem of representing a function deﬁned on some ﬁnite interval by a trigo-
nometric series consisting of only sine functions or only cosine functions. For example, in 
Section 10.2, equation (25), page 569, we needed to express the initial values u1x, 02 = f1x2, 
0 6 x 6 L, of the solution to the initial-boundary value problem associated with the problem of 
a vibrating string as a trigonometric series of the form
(1) 
f1x2 = a
∞
n = 1
 an sina npx
L b .
Recalling that the Fourier series for an odd function deﬁned on 3 -L, L4 consists entirely of 
sine terms, we might try to achieve (1) by artiﬁcially extending the function f1x2, 0 6 x 6 L,
to the interval 1 -L, L2 in such a way that the extended function is odd. This is accomplished 
by deﬁning the function
fo1x2J e
f1x2 , 
  0 6 x 6 L ,
-f1 -x2 ,
-L 6 x 6 0 ,
and extending fo1x2 to all x using 2L-periodicity.† Since fo1x2 is an odd function, it has a 
Fourier series consisting entirely of sine terms. Moreover, fo1x2 is an extension of f1x2,
10.4 Fourier Cosine and Sine Series
†Strictly speaking, we have extended fo1x2 to all x other than the integer multiples of L. Continuity considerations 
often suggest appropriate values for the extended functions at some of these points, as well. Figure 10.13 on page 589 
illustrates this.

588     Chapter 10  Partial Differential Equations
since fo1x2 = f1x2 on 10, L2. This extension is called the odd 2L-periodic extension of 
f1x2. The resulting Fourier series expansion is called a half-range expansion for f1x2, since 
it represents the function f1x2 on 10, L2, which is half of the interval 1 -L, L2 where it 
 represents fo1x2.
In a similar fashion, we can deﬁne the even 2L-periodic extension of f1x2 as the  
function
fe1x2 J e
f1x2 ,
  0 6 x 6 L ,
f1 -x2 ,
 -L 6 x 6 0 ,
with fe1x + 2L2 = fe1x2.
To illustrate the various extensions, let’s consider the function f1x2 = x, 0 6 x 6 p.  
If we extend f1x2 to the interval 1 -p, p2 using p-periodicity, then the extension f∼ is 
given by
f∼1x2 = e
x , 
 0 6 x 6 p ,
x + p , 
-p 6 x 6 0 ,
with f∼1x + 2p2 = f∼1x2. In Problem 14 of Exercises 10.3, the Fourier series for f∼1x2 was 
found to be
f∼1x2 ∼ p
2 - a
∞
n = 1

n
  sin 2nx ,
which consists of both odd functions (the sine terms) and even functions (the constant 
term), since the p-periodic extension f∼1x2 is neither an even nor an odd function. The odd  
2p-periodic extension of f1x2 is just fo1x2 = x, -p 6 x 6 p, which has the Fourier series 
expansion
(2) 
fo1x2 ∼ 2 a
∞
n = 1

(see Problem 9 in Exercises 10.3). Because fo1x2 = f1x2 on the interval 10, p2, the expan-
sion in (2) is a half-range expansion for f1x2. The even 2p-periodic extension of f1x2 is the 
function fe1x2 = 0 x0 , -p 6 x 6 p, which has the Fourier series expansion

The preceding three extensions, the p-periodic function f∼1x2, the odd 2p-periodic func-
tion fo1x2, and the even 2p-periodic function fe1x2, are natural extensions of f1x2. There are 
many other ways of extending f1x2. For example, the function
g1x2 = e
x ,
0 6 x 6 p , 
0 ,
-p 6 x 6 0 ,   g1x + 2p2 = g1x2 ,
which we studied in Example 3 of Section 10.3, is also an extension of f1x2. However, 
its Fourier series contains both sine and cosine terms and hence is not as useful as pre-
vious extensions. The graphs of these extensions of f1x2 are given in Figure 10.13 on 
page 589.

Section 10.4  Fourier Cosine and Sine Series     589
The Fourier series expansions for fo1x2 and fe1x2 given in (2) and (3) represent f1x2 on the 
interval 10, p2 1actually, they equal f1x2 on 10, p22. This motivates the following deﬁnitions.

Comparing equation (9) with equation (1) in Section 10.2 (page 563), we see that b = 2 and

In Section 10.1 we developed a model for heat ﬂow in an insulated uniform wire whose ends

In other words, solving (1)–(3) reduces to computing the Fourier sine series for the initial value 
function f1x2.
In this section we discuss heat ﬂow problems where the ends of the wire are insulated or 
kept at a constant, but nonzero, temperature. (The latter involves nonhomogeneous boundary 
conditions.) We will also discuss the problem in which a heat source is adding heat to the wire. 
(This results in a nonhomogeneous partial diﬀerential equation.) The problem of heat ﬂow in a 
rectangular plate is also discussed and leads to the topic of double Fourier series. We conclude 
this section with a discussion of the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the heat ﬂow 
problem.
In the model of heat ﬂow in a uniform wire, let’s replace the assumption that the ends of 
the wire are kept at a constant temperature zero and instead assume that the ends of the wire 
are insulated—that is, no heat ﬂows out (or in) at the ends of the wire. It follows from the prin-
ciple of heat conduction (see Section 10.1) that the temperature gradient must be zero at these 
endpoints, that is,
0u

In the next example we obtain the formal solution to the heat ﬂow problem with these boundary 
conditions.

Solution
Using the method of separation of variables, we ﬁrst assume that
u1x, t2 = X1x2T1t2 .
Substituting into equation (6) and separating variables, as was done in Section 10.2 [compare 
equation (5) on page 564], we get the two equations
(9) 
X″1x2 + lX1x2 = 0 ,
(10) 
T′1t2 + blT1t2 = 0 ,
where l is some constant. The boundary conditions in (7) become
X′102T1t2 = 0  and  X′1L2T1t2 = 0 .
For these equations to hold for all t 7 0, either T1t2 K 0, which implies that u1x, t2 K 0, or
(11) 
X′102 = X′1L2 = 0 .
Combining the boundary conditions in (11) with equation (9) gives the boundary value problem
(12) 
X″1x2 + lX1x2 = 0 ;  X′102 = X′1L2 = 0 ,
where l can be any constant.
To solve for the nontrivial solutions to (12), we propose X1x2 = e rx and form the auxil-
iary equation r2 + l = 0. When l 6 0, arguments similar to those used in Section 10.2 show 
that there are no nontrivial solutions to (12).
When l = 0, the auxiliary equation has the repeated root 0 and a general solution to the 
diﬀerential equation is
X1x2 = A + Bx .
The boundary conditions in (12) reduce to B = 0 with A arbitrary. Thus, for l = 0, the 
nontrivial solutions to (12) are of the form
X1x2 = c0 ,
where c0 = A is an arbitrary nonzero constant.
When l 7 0, the auxiliary equation has the roots r = {i1l. Thus, a general solution to 
the diﬀerential equation in (12) is
X1x2 = C1 cos 1l x + C2 sin 1l x .
The boundary conditions in (12) lead to the system
 1lC2 = 0 ,
 - 1lC1 sin 1l L + 1lC2 cos 1l L = 0 .

594     Chapter 10  Partial Differential Equations
Hence, C2 = 0 and the system reduces to solving C1 sin 1lL = 0. Since sin1lL = 0
only when 1lL = np, where n is an integer, we obtain a nontrivial solution only when 
1l = np>L or l = 1np>L22, n = 1, 2, 3, c . Furthermore, the nontrivial solutions 
(eigenfunctions) Xn corresponding to the eigenvalue l = 1np>L22 are given by
(13) 
Xn1x2 = cn cos npx
L  ,
where the cn’s are arbitrary nonzero constants. In fact, formula (13) also holds for n = 0, since 
l = 0 has the eigenfunctions X01x2 = c0.
Note that these eigenvalues and eigenfunctions (see Figure 10.15) have the same prop-
erties as those on page 565 (which we now recognize as the components of the sine series): 
homogeneous boundary conditions, eigenvalues clustering at inﬁnity, increasingly oscillatory, 
orthogonal.
Having determined that l = 1np>L22, n = 0, 1, 2, c, let’s consider equation (10) for 
such l:
T′1t2 + b1np>L22T1t2 = 0 .

Figure 10.15 Cosine eigenfunctions
For n = 0, 1, 2, c, the general solution is
Tn1t2 = bn e-b1np>L22t ,
where the bn’s are arbitrary constants. Combining this with equa-
tion (13), we obtain the functions
un1x, t2 = Xn1x2Tn1t2 = c cn cos npx
L d  3bn e-b1np>L22t4 ,
un1x, t2 = an e-b1np>L22t cos npx

where an = bncn is, again, an arbitrary constant.

which will be a solution to (6)–(7) provided the series has the 
proper convergence behavior. Notice that in (14) we have altered 
the constant term and written it as a0>2, thus producing the stan-
dard form for cosine expansions.
Assuming a solution to (6)–(7) is given by the series in (14) and substituting into the initial 
condition (8), we get

then u1x, t2 given in (14) will be a formal solution to the heat ﬂow problem (6)–(8). Again, if 
this expansion converges to a continuous function with continuous second partial derivatives, 
then the formal solution is an actual solution. ◆
Note that the individual terms in the series (4) and (14) are genuine solutions to the heat 
equation and the associated boundary conditions (but not the initial condition, of course). 
These solutions are called the modes of the system. Observe that the time factor e-b1np>L22t
decays faster for the more oscillatory (higher n) modes. This makes sense physically; a temper-
ature pattern of many alternating hot and cold strips arranged closely together will equilibrate 
faster than a more uniform pattern. See Figure 10.16.
A good way of expressing how separation of variables “works” is as follows: The initial 
temperature proﬁle f1x2 is decomposed into modes through Fourier analysis—equations (5) 
or (15). Then each mode is matched with a time decay factor—equations (4) or (14)—and it 
evolves in time accordingly.
When the ends of the wire are kept at 0°C or when the ends are insulated, the boundary 
conditions are said to be homogeneous. But when the ends of the wire are kept at constant 
temperatures diﬀerent from zero, that is,
(16) 
u10, t2 = U1  and  u1L, t2 = U2 ,  t 7 0 ,
then the boundary conditions are called nonhomogeneous.

596     Chapter 10  Partial Differential Equations
From our experience with vibration problems in Section 4.9 we expect that the solution 
to the heat ﬂow problem with nonhomogeneous boundary conditions will consist of a steady-
state solution y1x2 that satisﬁes the nonhomogeneous boundary conditions in (16) plus a 
transient solution w1x, t2. That is,
u1x, t2 = Y1x2 + w1x, t2 ,
where w1x, t2 and its partial derivatives tend to zero as t S ∞. The function w1x, t2 will then 
satisfy homogeneous boundary conditions, as illustrated in the next example.

(19) 
 u1x, 02 = f1x2 ,  0 6 x 6 L .
 Solution
Let’s assume that the solution u1x, t2 consists of a steady-state solution y1x2 and a transient 
solution w1x, t2—that is,
(20) 
u1x, t2 = y1x2 + w1x, t2 .
Substituting for u1x, t2 in equations (17)–(19) leads to
(21) 
 0 u
0 t = 0 w
0 t = by″1x2 + b 02w

(22) 
 y102 + w10, t2 = U1 ,  y1L2 + w1L, t2 = U2 ,  t 7 0 ,
(23) 
 y1x2 + w1x, 02 = f1x2 , 0 6 x 6 L .
If we allow t S ∞ in (21)–(22), assuming that w1x, t2 is a transient solution, we obtain the 
steady-state boundary value problem
y″1x2 = 0 ,  0 6 x 6 L ,
 y102 = U1 ,  y1L2 = U2 .
Solving for y, we obtain y1x2 = Ax + B, and choosing A and B so that the boundary condi-
tions are satisﬁed yields
(24) 
y1x2 = U1 + 1U2 - U12x
L
as the steady-state solution.
With this choice for y1x2, the initial-boundary value problem (21)–(23) reduces to the 
following initial-boundary value problem for w1x, t2:
(25) 
 0 w
0 t = b 02w
0x2  ,  0 6 x 6 L ,  t 7 0 ,
(26) 
 w10, t2 = w1L, t2 = 0 ,  t 7 0 ,
(27) 
 w1x, 02 = f1x2 - U1 - 1U2 - U12x
L

Section 10.5  The Heat Equation     597
Recall that a formal solution to (25)–(27) is given by equation (4). Hence,
w1x, t2 = a

n = 1

where the cn’s are the coeﬃcients of the Fourier sine series expansion

In the next example, we consider the heat ﬂow problem when a heat source is present but 
is independent of time. (Recall the derivation in Section 10.1.)

(31) 
 u1x, 02 = f1x2 ,  0 6 x 6 L .
Solution
We begin by assuming that the solution consists of a steady-state solution y1x2 and a transient 
solution w1x, t2, namely,
u1x, t2 = y1x2 + w1x, t2 ,
where w1x, t2 and its partial derivatives tend to zero as t S ∞. Substituting for u1x, t2 in 
(29)–(31) yields
(32) 
 0 u

0 t = by″1x2 + b 02w

(34) 
 y1x2 + w1x, 02 = f1x2 ,  0 6 x 6 L .
Letting t S ∞ in (32)–(33), we obtain the steady-state boundary value problem
 y″1x2 = - 1
b
 P1x2 ,  0 6 x 6 L ,
 y102 = U1 ,  y1L2 = U2 .

The solution to this boundary value problem can be obtained by two integrations using the 
boundary conditions to determine the constants of integration. The reader can verify that the 
solution is given by the formula

With this choice for y1x2, we ﬁnd that the initial-boundary value problem (32)–(34) 
reduces to the following initial-boundary value problem for w1x, t2:
(36) 
 0 w
0 t = b 02w
0x2  ,  0 6 x 6 L ,  t 7 0 ,
(37) 
 w10, t2 = w1L, t2 = 0 ,  t 7 0 ,
(38) 
 w1x, 02 = f1x2 - y1x2 ,  0 6 x 6 L ,
where y1x2 is given by formula (35). As before, the solution to this initial-boundary value 
problem is
(39) 
w1x, t2 = a
∞
n = 1
 cn e-b1np>L22t sin npx
L  ,
where the cn’s are determined from the Fourier sine series expansion of f1x2 - y1x2:
(40) 
f1x2 - y1x2 = a
∞
n = 1
 cn sin npx
L  .
Thus the formal solution to (29)–(31) is given by
u1x, t2 = y1x2 + w1x, t2 ,
where y1x2 is given in (35) and w1x, t2 is prescribed by (39)–(40). ◆
The method of separation of variables is also applicable to problems in higher 
dimensions. For example, consider the problem of heat flow in a rectangular plate with 
sides x = 0, x = L, y = 0, and y = W. If the two sides y = 0, y = W are kept at a constant 
temperature of 0°C and the two sides x = 0, x = L are perfectly insulated, then heat 
flow is governed by the initial-boundary value problem in the following example (see 
Figure 10.17).

(44) 
u1x, y, 02 = f1x, y2 ,  0 6 x 6 L ,  0 6 y 6 W .
Solution
If we assume a solution of the form u1x, y, t2 = V1x, y2T1t2, then equation (41) separates 
into the two equations
(45) 
T′1t2 + blT1t2 = 0 ,
(46) 
02V
0x2  1x, y2 + 02V
0y2  1x, y2 + lV1x, y2 = 0 ,
where l can be any constant. To solve equation (46), we again use separation of variables. Here 
we assume V1x, y2 = X1x2Y1y2. This allows us to separate equation (46) into the two equations
(47) 
 X″1x2 + mX1x2 = 0 ,
(48) 
 Y ″1y2 + 1l - m2Y1y2 = 0 ,
where µ can be any constant (see Problem 29 in Exercises 10.2 on page 571).
To solve for X1x2, we observe that the boundary conditions in (42), in terms of the sepa-
rated variables, become
X′102Y1y2T1t2 = X′1L2Y1y2T1t2 = 0 ;  0 6 y 6 W ,  t 7 0 .
Hence, in order to get a nontrivial solution, we must have
(49) 
X′102 = X′1L2 = 0 .
The boundary value problem for X given in equations (47) and (49) was solved in Example 1 
[compare equations (12) and (13)]. Here m = 1mp>L22, m = 0, 1, 2, . . . , and
Xm1x2 = cm cos  mpx
L  ,
where the cm’s are arbitrary. (We forgo the “c0>2” convention here.)
To solve for Y1y2, we ﬁrst observe that the boundary conditions in (43) become
(50) 
Y102 = Y1W2 = 0 .
Next, substituting m = 1mp>L22 into equation (48) yields
Y ″1y2 + 1l - 1mp>L222Y1y2 = 0 ,
which we can rewrite as
(51) 
Y ″1y2 + EY1y2 = 0 ,
where E = l - 1mp>L22. The boundary value problem for Y consisting of (50)–(51) has also 
been solved before. In Section 10.2 [compare equations (7) and (9), pages 564 and 565] we 
showed that E = 1np>W22, n = 1, 2, 3, c , and the nontrivial solutions are given by
Yn1y2 = an sin npy
W  ,

600     Chapter 10  Partial Differential Equations
where the an’s are arbitrary.
Since l = E + 1mp>L22, we have
l = 1np>W22 + 1mp>L22 ;  m = 0, 1, 2, . . .  ,  n = 1, 2, 3, c .
Substituting l into equation (45), we can solve for T1t2 and obtain
Tmn1t2 = bmn e-1m2>L2+n2>W22bp2t .
Substituting in for Xm, Yn, and Tmn, we get

where amn J anbmncm 1m = 0, 1, 2, c, n = 1, 2, 3, c2 are arbitrary constants.

Finally, the solution to the initial-boundary value problem (41)–(44) is given by equation (52), 
where the coeﬃcients are prescribed by equations (54) and (55). ◆
We derived formulas (54) and (55) under the assumption that the double series (53) truly 
converged (uniformly). How can we justify the assumption that a double Fourier series con-
verges? A rough argument goes as follows. If we ﬁx y in f1x, y2, then f1x, y2 presumably has 
a convergent cosine series in x: f1x, y2 = a
∞
m = 0 dm cos  1mpx>L2. But the coeﬃcients dm 
depend on the value of the y that we ﬁxed: dm = dm1y2. So presumably each function dm1y2 
has a convergent sine series in y: dm1y2 = a
∞
n = 1 amn  sin 1npy/W2. Assembling all this, we 
get f1x, y2 = a

m = 0 a

n = 1 amn cos 1mpx>L2 sin 1npy>W2.
Existence and Uniqueness of Solutions
In the examples that we have studied in this section and in Section 10.2, we were able to obtain 
formal solutions in the sense that we could express the solution in terms of a series expansion 
consisting of exponentials, sines, and cosines. To prove that these series converge to actual 
solutions requires results on the convergence of Fourier series and results from real analysis on 
uniform convergence. We will not go into these details here, but refer the reader to Section 6.5 
of the text by Tyn Myint-U (see footnote on page 600) for a proof of the existence of a solution 
to the heat ﬂow problem discussed in Sections 10.1 and 10.2. (A proof of uniqueness is also 
given there.)
As might be expected, by using Fourier series and the method of separation of variables 
one can also obtain “solutions” when the initial data are discontinuous, since the formal 
solutions require only the existence of a convergent Fourier series. This allows one to study 
idealized problems in which the initial conditions do not agree with the boundary conditions 
or the initial conditions involve a jump discontinuity. For example, we may assume that 
initially one half of the wire is at one temperature, whereas the other half is at a diﬀerent 
temperature, that is,
f1x2 = e
U1 ,
  0 6 x 6 L>2 ,
U2 ,
L>2 6 x 6 L .
The formal solution that we obtain will make sense for 0 6 x 6 L, t 7 0, but near the points of 
discontinuity x = 0, L>2, and L, we have to expect behavior like that exhibited in Figure 10.7 
of Section 10.3, page 578.
The question of the uniqueness of the solution to the heat ﬂow problem can be answered 
in various ways. One is tempted to argue that the method of separation of variables yields 
formulas for the solutions and therefore a unique solution. However, this does not exclude 
the possibility of solutions existing that cannot be obtained by the method of separation of 
variables.
From physical considerations, we know that the peak temperature along a wire does not 
increase spontaneously if there are no heat sources to drive it up. Indeed, if hot objects could 
draw heat from colder objects without external intervention, we would have violations of 
the second law of thermodynamics. Thus no point on an unheated wire will ever reach a 

602     Chapter 10  Partial Differential Equations
higher temperature than the initial peak temperature. Such statements are called maximum 
principles and can be proved mathematically for the heat equation and Laplace’s equation. 
One such result is the following.†
†For a discussion of maximum principles and their applications, see Maximum Principles in Diﬀerential Equations, by 
M. H. Protter and H. F. Weinberger (Springer-Verlag, New York, 1984).

and the boundary conditions

(60) 
 u1x, 02 = f1x2 ,  0 6 x 6 L ,
has at most one continuously diﬀerentiable solution.
We can use the maximum principle to show that the heat ﬂow problem has a unique solution.
Proof. Assume u1x, t2 and y1x, t2 are continuously diﬀerentiable functions that satisfy 
the initial-boundary value problem (58)–(60). Let w = u - y. Now w is a continuously diﬀer-
entiable solution to the boundary value problem (56)–(57). By the maximum principle, w must 
attain its maximum at t = 0, and since
w1x, 02 = u1x, 02 - y1x, 02 = f1x2 - f1x2 = 0 ,
we have w1x, t2 … 0. Hence, u1x, t2 … y1x, t2 for all 0 … x … L, t Ú 0. A similar argu-
ment using wn = y - u yields y1x, t2 … u1x, t2. Therefore we have u1x, t2 = y1x, t2 for 
all 0 … x … L, t Ú 0. Thus, there is at most one continuously diﬀerentiable solution to the  
problem (58)–(60). ◆

boundary conditions are
C10, t2 = C1a, t2 = 0 ,  t 7 0 ,
and the initial concentration is given by
C1x, 02 = f1x2 ,  0 6 x 6 a .

In Section 10.2 we presented a model for the motion of a vibrating string. If u1x, t2 represents 
the displacement (deﬂection) of the string and the ends of the string are held ﬁxed, then the 
motion of the string is governed by the initial-boundary value problem
(1)

(4) 
 0 u
0 t
 1x, 02 = g1x2 ,  0 6 x 6 L .
Equation (1) is called the wave equation.
The constant a2 appearing in (1) is strictly positive and depends on the linear density and 
tension of the string. The boundary conditions in (2) reﬂect the fact that the string is held ﬁxed 
at the two endpoints x = 0 and x = L.
Equations (3) and (4) specify, respectively, the initial displacement and the initial velocity 
of each point on the string. For the initial and boundary conditions to be consistent, we assume 
f102 = f1L2 = 0 and g102 = g1L2 = 0.
Using the method of separation of variables, we found in Section 10.2 that a formal solu-
tion to (1)–(4) is given by [compare equations (24)–(26) on page 569]

10.6 The Wave Equation

Section 10.6  The Wave Equation     605
Each term (or mode) in expansion (5) can be viewed as a standing wave (a wave that 
vibrates in place without lateral motion along the string). For example, the ﬁrst term,
aa1 cos pa
L
 t + b1 sin pa
L
 tb sin  px
L  ,
consists of a sinusoidal shape function sin1px>L2 multiplied by a time-varying amplitude. 
The second term is also a sinusoid sin12px>L2 with a time-varying amplitude. In the latter 
case, there is a node in the middle at x = L>2 that never moves. For the nth term, we have a 
sinusoid sin1npx>L2 with a time-varying amplitude and 1n - 12 nodes. This is illustrated in 
Figure 10.19. Thus, separation of variables decomposes the initial data into sinusoids or modes 
[equations (6)–(7)], assigns each mode a frequency at which to vibrate [equation (5)], and rep-
resents the solution as the superposition of inﬁnitely many standing waves. Modes with more 
nodes vibrate at higher frequencies. By choosing the initial conﬁguration of the string to have 
the same shape as one of the individual terms in the solution, we can activate only that mode.

The diﬀerent modes of vibration of a guitar string are distinguishable to the human ear 
by the frequency of the sound they generate; diﬀerent frequencies are discerned as diﬀerent 
“pitches.” The fundamental is the frequency of the lowest mode, and integer multiples of the 
fundamental frequency are called “harmonics.” A cello and a trombone sound diﬀerent even if 
they are playing the same fundamental, say F#, because of the diﬀerence in the intensities of 
the harmonics they generate.

606     Chapter 10  Partial Differential Equations
Many engineering devices operate better in some modes than in others. For example, cer-
tain modes propagate down a waveguide or an optical ﬁber with less attenuation than the oth-
ers. In such cases, engineers design the systems to suppress the undesirable modes, either by 
shaping the initial excitation or by introducing devices (like resistor cards in a waveguide) 
which damp out certain modes preferentially.
The fundamental mode on a guitar string can be suppressed by holding the ﬁnger lightly in 
contact with the midpoint, thereby creating a stationary point or node there. According to equa-
tion (5), the pitch of the note then doubles, thus producing an “octave.” This style of ﬁngering, 
called “playing harmonics,” is used frequently in musical performance.
An important characteristic of an engineering device is the set of angular frequencies sup-
ported by its eigenmodes—its “eigenfrequencies.” According to equation (5), the eigenfre-
quencies of the vibrating string are the harmonics vn = npa>L, n = 1, 2, 3, . . . . These blend 
together pleasantly to the human ear, and we enjoy melodies played on string instruments. The 
eigenfrequencies of a drum are not harmonics (see Problem 21). Therefore, drums are used for 
rhythm, not for melody.
As we have seen in the preceding section, the method of separation of variables can be 
used to solve problems with nonhomogeneous boundary conditions and nonhomogeneous 
equations where the forcing term is time independent. In the next example, we will consider a 
problem with a time-dependent forcing term h1x, t2.

Solution
The boundary conditions in (9) certainly require that the solution be zero for x = 0 and  
x = L. Motivated by the fact that the solution to the corresponding homogeneous system (1) – (4) 
consists of a superposition of standing waves, let’s try to ﬁnd a solution to (8) – (11) of the form
(12) 
u1x, t2 = a
∞
n = 1
 un1t2 sin  npx
L  ,
where the un1t2’s are functions of t to be determined.
For each ﬁxed t, we can compute a Fourier sine series for h1x, t2. If we assume that the 
series is convergent to h1x, t2, then
(13) 
h1x, t2 = a

n = 1

Equating the coeﬃcients in each series (why?), we have

 un1t2 = hn1t2 .
This is a nonhomogeneous, constant-coeﬃcient equation that can be solved using variation of

[compare Problem 20 of Exercises 4.6]. Hence, with this choice of un1t2, the series in (12) is a 
formal solution to the partial diﬀerential equation (8).
Since†
un102 = an  and  u=
n102 = bn a npa

substituting (12) into the initial conditions (10)–(11) yields

The method of separation of variables can also be used to solve initial-boundary value 
problems for the wave equation in higher dimensions. For example, a vibrating rectangular 
membrane of length L and width W (see Figure 10.20 on page 608) is governed by the following 
initial-boundary value problem for u1x, y, t2:

We mentioned earlier that the solution to the vibrating string problem (1)–(4) consisted of 
a superposition of standing waves. There are also “traveling waves” associated with the wave 
equation. Traveling waves arise naturally out of d’Alembert’s solution to the wave equation for 
an “inﬁnite” string.

we use the change of variables
c = x + at ,  h = x - at .
If u has continuous second partial derivatives, then 0u>0x = 0u>0c + 0u>0h and 
0u>0t =  a10u>0c - 0u>0h2, from which we obtain
02u

0t2 = a2 e 02u
0c2 - 2 02u
0c0h + 02u

Substituting these expressions into the wave equation and simplifying yields
02u
0c 0h = 0 .
We can solve this equation directly by ﬁrst integrating with respect to c to obtain
0u
0h = b1h2 ,
where b1h2 is an arbitrary function of h, and then integrating with respect to h to ﬁnd
u1c, h2 = A1c2 + B1h2 ,
where A1c2 and B1h2 = 1b1h2 dh are arbitrary functions. Substituting the original vari-
ables x and t gives d’Alembert’s solution
(25) 
u1x, t2 = A1x + At2 + B1x −At2 .
It is easy to check by direct substitution that u1x, t2, deﬁned by formula (25), is indeed a solution 
to the wave equation, provided A and B are twice-diﬀerentiable functions.

We now use d’Alembert’s formula to show that the solution to the “inﬁnite” string prob-
lem consists of traveling waves.
Let h1x2 be a function deﬁned on 1 - ∞, ∞2. The function h1x + a2, where a 7 0, is a 
translation of the function h1x2 in the sense that its “shape” is the same as h1x2, but its posi-
tion has been shifted to the left by an amount a. This is illustrated in Figure 10.21 for a function

then the functions h1x + at2 represent a family of functions with the same shape but shifted 
farther and farther to the left as t S ∞ (Figure 10.22 on page 611). We say that h1x + at2 is a 
traveling wave moving to the left with speed a. In a similar fashion, h1x - at2 is a traveling 
wave moving to the right with speed a.

If we refer to formula (25), we ﬁnd that the solution to 02u>0t2 = a202u>0x2 consists of 
traveling waves A1x + at2 moving to the left with speed a and B1x - at2 moving to the right 
at the same speed.

Hence, u1x, t2 is the sum of the traveling waves

These waves are initially superimposed, since
u1x, 02 = 1

2 f1x2 = f1x2 .
As t increases, the two waves move away from each other with speed 2a. This is illustrated in

Existence and Uniqueness of Solutions
In Example 1 the method of separation of variables was used to derive a formal solution to the 
given initial-boundary value problem. To show that these series converge to an actual solution 
requires results from real analysis, just as was the case for the formal solutions to the heat 
equation in Section 10.5. In Examples 2 and 3, we can establish the validity of d’Alembert’s 
solution by direct substitution into the initial value problem, assuming suﬃcient diﬀerentiabil-
ity of the initial functions. We leave it as an exercise for you to show that if f has a continuous 
second derivative and g has a continuous ﬁrst derivative, then d’Alembert’s solution is a true 
solution (see Problem 12).
The question of the uniqueness of the solution to the initial-boundary value problem (1)–(4) 
can be answered using an energy argument.

has at most one twice continuously diﬀerentiable solution.
Proof. Assume both u1x, t2 and y1x, t2 are twice continuously diﬀerentiable solutions 
to (37)–(40) and let w1x, t2 J u1x, t2 - y1x, t2. It is easy to check that w1x, t2 satisﬁes the 
initial-boundary value problem (37)–(40) with zero initial data; that is, for 0 … x … L,
(41) 
w1x, 02 = 0  and  0 w
0 t
 1x, 02 = 0 .
We now show that w1x, t2 K 0 for 0 … x … L, t Ú 0.
If w1x, t2 is the displacement of the vibrating string at location x for time t, then with the 
appropriate units, the total energy E1t2 of the vibrating string at time t equals the integral

(The ﬁrst term in the integrand relates to the stretching of the string at location x and represents 
the potential energy. The second term is the square of the velocity of the vibrating string at x 
and represents the kinetic energy.)

order of integration and diﬀerentiation. This gives

that is,

0x 0t .
Combining this fact with integration by parts, we obtain

Since w satisﬁes equation (37), the integrand is zero for all x. Thus, dE>dt = 0, and so 
E1t2 K C, where C is a constant. This means that the total energy is conserved within the 
vibrating string.
The ﬁrst boundary condition in (41) states that w1x, 02 = 0 for 0 … x … L. Hence, 
10w>0x21x, 02 = 0 for 0 6 x 6 L. Combining this with the second boundary condition in (41), 
we ﬁnd that when t = 0, the integrand in (42) is zero for 0 6 x 6 L. Therefore, E102 = 0. 
Since E1t2 K C, we must have C = 0. Hence,

That is, the total energy of this system is zero.
Because the integrand in (45) is nonnegative and continuous and the integral is zero, the 
integrand must be zero for 0 … x … L. Moreover, the integrand is the sum of two squares and so 
each term must be zero. Hence,

where u1x, t2 is the displacement of the water from 
its equilibrium depth at location x and at time t, and a 
and b are positive constants.
 
 (a)  Show that equation (46) has a solution of the 
form
(47) 
u1x, t2 = V1z2 ,
 
z = kx - w1k2t ,
 
 where k is a ﬁxed constant and w1k2 is a func-
tion of k, provided V satisﬁes
(48) 
-w dV
dz + ak dV
dz + bk3 d3V
dz3 = 0 .
 
 These solutions, deﬁned by (47), are called 
uniform waves.
 
 (b)  Physically, we are interested only in solutions 
V1z2 that are bounded and nonconstant on the 
inﬁnite interval 1- ∞, ∞2. Show that such solu-
tions exist only if ak - w 7 0.
 
 (c)  Let l2 = 1ak - w2>1bk32. Show that the solu-
tions from part (b) can be expressed in the form
V1x, t2 = A sin 3lkx - 1alk - bl3k32t + B4 ,
 
 where A and B are arbitrary constants. [Hint: 
Solve for w in terms of l and k and use (47).]
 
 (d)  Since both l and k can be chosen arbitrarily and 
they always appear together as the product lk, 
we can set l = 1 without loss of generality. 
Hence, we have
V1x, t2 = A sin 3kx - 1ak - bk32t + B4
 
 as a uniform wave solution to (46). The deﬁn-
ing relation w1k2 = ak - bk3 is called the dis-
persion relation, the ratio w1k2>k = a - bk2 
is called the phase velocity, and the derivative 
dw>dk = a - 3bk2 is called the group veloc-
ity. When the group velocity is not constant, the 
waves are called dispersive. Show that the stan-
dard wave equation utt = a2uxx has only nondis-
persive waves.

In Section 10.1 we showed how Laplace’s equation,
∆u = 02u
0x2 + 02u
0y2 = 0 ,
arises in the study of steady-state or time-independent solutions to the heat equation. Because 
these solutions do not depend on time, initial conditions are irrelevant and only boundary con-
ditions are speciﬁed. Other applications include the static displacement u1x, y2 of a stretched 
membrane fastened in space along the boundary of a region (here u must satisfy Laplace’s 
equation inside the region); the electrostatic and gravitational potentials in certain force ﬁelds 
(here u must satisfy Laplace’s equation in any region that is free of electrical charges or mass); 
and, in ﬂuid mechanics for an idealized ﬂuid, the stream function u1x, y2 whose level curves 
(stream lines), u1x, y2 = constant, represent the path of particles in the ﬂuid (again u satisﬁes 
Laplace’s equation in the ﬂow region).
There are two basic types of boundary conditions that are usually associated with Laplace’s 
equation: Dirichlet boundary conditions, where the solution u1x, y2 to Laplace’s equation in 
a domain D is required to satisfy
u1x, y2 = f1x, y2  on 0D ,
with f1x, y2 a speciﬁed function deﬁned on the boundary 0D of D; and Neumann boundary 
conditions, where the directional derivative 0u>0n along the outward normal to the boundary 
is required to satisfy
0u

with g1x, y2 a speciﬁed function deﬁned on 0D.† We say that the boundary conditions are 
mixed if the solution is required to satisfy u1x, y2 = f1x, y2 on part of the boundary and 
10u>0n21x, y2 = g1x, y2 on the remaining portion of the boundary.
In this section we use the method of separation of variables to ﬁnd solutions to Laplace’s 
equation with various boundary conditions for rectangular, circular, and cylindrical domains. 
We also discuss the existence and uniqueness of such solutions.
†These generalize the boundary conditions (5) in Section 10.1 and (42) in Section 10.5.

Solution
Separating variables, we ﬁrst let u1x, y2 = X1x2Y1y2. Substituting into equation (1), we have
X″1x2Y1y2 + X1x2Y ″1y2 = 0 ,
which separates into
X″1x2
X1x2 = - Y ″1y2
Y1y2 = -l ,
where l is some constant. This leads to the two ordinary diﬀerential equations

 X″1x2 + lX1x2 = 0 ,

 Y ″1y2 - lY1y2 = 0 .

solutions

†We usually express Yn1y2 = an enpy>a + bn e-npy>a. However, computation is simpliﬁed in this case by using the 
hyperbolic functions cosh z = 1ez + e-z2>2 and sinh z = 1ez - e-z2>2 .

In Example 1 the boundary conditions were homogeneous on three sides of the rectangle 
and nonhomogeneous on the fourth side, 51x, y2: y = 0, 0 … x … a6. It is important to note 
that the method used in Example 1 can also be used to solve problems for which the boundary 
conditions are nonhomogeneous on all sides. This is accomplished by solving four separate 
boundary value problems in which three sides have homogeneous boundary conditions and 
only one side is nonhomogeneous. The solution is then obtained by summing these four solu-
tions (see Problem 5).
For problems involving circular domains, it is usually more convenient to use polar coor-
dinates. In rectangular coordinates the Laplacian has the form
∆u = 02u

In polar coordinates 1r, u2, we let
x = r cos u ,  y = r sin u
so that
r = 2x2 + y2 ,  tan u = y>x .
With patience and a little care in applying the chain rule, one can show that the Laplacian in 
polar coordinates is

A circular metal disk of radius a has its top and bottom insulated. The edge 1r = a2 of the 
disk is kept at a speciﬁed temperature that depends on its location (varies with u). The steady-
state temperature inside the disk satisﬁes Laplace’s equation. Determine the temperature distri-
bution u1r, u2 inside the disk by ﬁnding the solution to the following Dirichlet boundary value

Solution
To use the method of separation of variables, we ﬁrst set
u1r, u2 = R1r2ϴ1u2 ,
where 0 … r 6 a and -p … u … p. Substituting into (13) and separating variables give
r2R″1r2 + rR′1r2
R1r2
= - ϴ″1u2
ϴ1u2 = l ,
where l is any constant. This leads to the two ordinary diﬀerential equations
(15) 
 r2R″1r2 + rR′1r2 - lR1r2 = 0 ,
(16) 
 ϴ″1u2 + lϴ1u2 = 0 .
For u1r, u2 to be continuous in the disk 0 … r 6 a, we need ϴ1u2 to be 2p-periodic; in 
particular, we require
(17) 
ϴ1 -p2 = ϴ1p2  and  ϴ′1 -p2 = ϴ′1p2 .
Therefore, we seek nontrivial solutions to the eigenvalue problem (16)–(17).
When l 6 0, the general solution to (16) is the sum of two exponentials. Hence we have 
only trivial 2p-periodic solutions.
When l = 0, we ﬁnd ϴ1u2 = Au + B to be the solution to (16). This linear function is 
periodic only when A = 0, that is, ϴ01u2 = B is the only 2p-periodic solution corresponding 
to l = 0.
When l 7 0, the general solution to (16) is
ϴ1u2 = A cos 1l u + B sin 1l u .
Here we get a nontrivial 2p-periodic solution only when 1l = n, n = 1, 2, c. [You can 
check this using (17).] Hence, we obtain the nontrivial 2p-periodic solutions
(18) 
ϴn1u2 = An cos nu + Bn sin  nu
corresponding to 1l = n, n = 1, 2, c. Notice that the eigenfunctions are the terms of the 
Fourier series discussed in Section 10.3 (recall Figure 10.5, page 573).

Section 10.7  Laplace’s Equation     621
Now for l = n2, n = 0, 1, 2, c, equation (15) is the Cauchy–Euler equation
(19) 
r2R″1r2 + rR′1r2 - n2R1r2 = 0
(see Section 4.7, page 192). When n = 0, the general solution is
R01r2 = C + D ln r .
Since ln r S - ∞ as r S 0+, this solution is unbounded near r = 0 when D ≠0. Therefore, 
we must choose D = 0 if u1r, u2 is to be continuous at r = 0. We now have R01r2 = C and 
so u01r, u2 = R01r2ϴ1u2 = CB, which for convenience we write in the form
(20) 
u01r, u2 = A0
2  ,
where A0 is an arbitrary constant.
When l = n2, n = 1, 2, c, you should verify that equation (19) has the general 
solution
Rn1r2 = Cnrn + Dnr-n .
Since r-n S ∞ as r S 0+, we must set Dn = 0 in order for u1r, u2 to be bounded at r = 0. 
Thus,
Rn1r2 = Cnrn .
Now for each n = 1, 2, . . . , we have the solutions
(21) 
un1r, u2 = Rn1r2ϴn1u2 = Cnrn1An cos nu + Bn sin nu2 ,
and by forming an inﬁnite series from the solutions in (20) and (21), we get the following  
formal solution to (13):
u1r, u2 = A0
2 + a
∞
n = 1
Cnrn1An cos nu + Bn sin nu2 .
It is more convenient to write this series in the equivalent form
(22) 
u1r, u2 = a0
2 + a
∞
n = 1
a r
ab
n
1an cos nu + bn sin nu2 ,
where the an’s and bn’s are constants. These constants can be determined from the boundary 
condition; indeed, with r = a in (22), condition (14) becomes
f1u2 = a0
2 + a
∞
n = 1
1an cos nu + bn sin nu2 .
Hence, we recognize that an, bn are Fourier coeﬃcients for f1u2. Thus,

622     Chapter 10  Partial Differential Equations
To summarize, if an and bn are deﬁned by formulas (23) and (24), then u1r, u2 given in 
(22) is a formal solution to the Dirichlet problem (13)–(14). ◆
The procedure in Example 2 can also be used to study the Neumann problem in a disk:
(25) 
∆u = 0 ,  0 … r 6 a ,  -p … u … p ,
(26) 
0u
0r
 1a, u2 = f1u2 ,  -p … u … p .
For this problem there is no unique solution, since if u is a solution, then the function u
plus a constant is also a solution. Moreover, f must satisfy the consistency condition
(27) 
L
p
-p
 f1u2 du = 0 .
If we interpret the solution u1r, u2 of equation (25) as the steady-state temperature distribu-
tion inside a circular disk that does not contain either a heat source or heat sink, then equa-
tion (26) speciﬁes the ﬂow of heat across the boundary of the disk. Here the consistency 
condition (27) is simply the requirement that the net ﬂow of heat across the boundary is 
zero. (If we keep pumping heat in, the temperature won’t reach equilibrium!) We leave the 
solution of the Neumann problem and the derivation of the consistency condition for the 
exercises.
The technique used in Example 2 also applies to annular domains, 51r, u2: 0 6 a 6 r 6 b6,
and to exterior domains, 51r, u2: a 6 r6. We also leave these applications as exercises.
Laplace’s equation in cylindrical coordinates arises in the study of steady-state tempera-
ture distributions in a solid cylinder and in determining the electric potential inside a cylinder. 
In cylindrical coordinates,
x = r cos u ,  y = r sin u ,  z = z ,
Laplace’s equation becomes

The Dirichlet problem for the cylinder 51r, u, z2: 0 … r … a, 0 … z … b6 has the boundary 
conditions
(29) 
u1a, u, z2 = f1u, z2 ,  
-p … u … p ,     0 … z … b ,

u1r, u, 02 = g1r, u2 ,    0 … r … a ,   -p … u … p ,
(31) 
u1r, u, b2 = h1r, u2 ,       0 … r … a ,   -p … u … p .
To solve the Dirichlet boundary value problem (28)–(31), we ﬁrst solve the three boundary 
value problems corresponding to: (i) g K 0 and h K 0; (ii) f K 0 and h K 0; and (iii) f K 0
and g K 0. Then by the superposition principle, the solution to (28)–(31) will be the sum of 
these three solutions. This is the same method that was discussed in dealing with Dirichlet 
problems on rectangular domains. (See the remarks following Example 1.) In the next example 
we solve the Dirichlet problem when g K 0 and h K 0.
Example 3
The base 1z = 02 and the top 1z = b2 of a charge-free cylinder are grounded and therefore 
are at zero potential. The potential on the lateral surface 1r = a2 of the cylinder is given by 
u1a, u, z2 = f1u, z2 where f1u, 02 = f1u, b2 = 0. Inside the cylinder, the potential u1r, u, z2

Solution
Using the method of separation of variables, we ﬁrst assume that
u1r, u, z2 = R1r2ϴ1u2Z1z2 .
Substituting into equation (32) and separating out the Z’s, we ﬁnd
R″1r2 + 11>r2R′1r2
R1r2
+ 1
r2 ϴ″1u2
ϴ1u2 = - Z″1z2
Z1z2 = l ,
where l can be any constant. Separating further the R’s and ϴ ’s gives
r2R″1r2 + rR′1r2
R1r2
- r2l = - ϴ″1u2
ϴ1u2 = m ,
where m can also be any constant. We now have the three ordinary diﬀerential equations:
(35) 
 r2R″1r2 + rR′1r2 - 1r2l + m2R1r2 = 0 ,
(36) 
 ϴ″1u2 + mϴ1u2 = 0 ,
(37) 
 Z″1z2 + lZ1z2 = 0 .
For u to be continuous in the cylinder, ϴ1u2 must be 2p-periodic. Thus, let’s begin with 
the eigenvalue problem
ϴ″1u2 + mϴ1u2 = 0 ,     -p 6 u 6 p ,
ϴ1 -p2 = ϴ1p2  and  ϴ′1 -p2 = ϴ′1p2 .
In Example 2 we showed that this problem has nontrivial solutions for m = n2, n = 0, 1, 2, c, 
that are given by the Fourier series components
(38) 
ϴn1u2 = An cos nu + Bn sin nu ,
where the An’s and Bn’s are arbitrary constants.
The boundary conditions in (34) imply that Z102 = Z1b2 = 0. Therefore, Z must satisfy 
the eigenvalue problem
Z″1z2 + lZ1z2 = 0 ,  0 6 z 6 b ,    Z102 = Z1b2 = 0 .
We have seen this eigenvalue problem several times before. Nontrivial solutions exist for 
l = 1mp>b22, m = 1, 2, 3, . . . and are given by the sine series components

Zm1z2 = Cm sin a mpz

which becomes unbounded as s S 0. (Recall that Γ is the gamma function discussed in 
Section 7.6.) A general solution to (40) has the form CKn + DIn, where C and D are constants. 
Since u must remain bounded near s = 0, we must take C = 0. Thus, the desired solutions to 
(40) have the form
(41) 
Rmn1r2 = Dmn Ina mpr
b

where the Dmn’s are arbitrary constants.
If we multiply the functions in (38), (39), and (41) and then sum over m and n, we obtain 
the following series solution to (32) and (34):

solution.

Existence and Uniqueness of Solutions
The existence of solutions to the boundary value problems for Laplace’s equation can be estab-
lished by studying the convergence of the formal solutions that we obtained using the method 
of separation of variables.
To answer the question of the uniqueness of the solution to a Dirichlet boundary value 
problem for Laplace’s equation, recall that Laplace’s equation arises in the search for 
steady-state solutions to the heat equation. Just as there are maximum principles for the 
heat equation, there are also maximum principles for Laplace’s equation. We state one such 
result here.†
†A proof can be found in Section 8.2 of the text, Partial Diﬀerential Equations of Mathematical Physics, 2nd ed., by 
Tyn Myint-U (Elsevier North Holland, New York, 1983).
Maximum Principle for Laplace’s Equation
Theorem 9. 
Let u1x, y2 be a solution to Laplace’s equation in a bounded domain D 
with u1x, y2 continuous in D, the closure of D. 1   D = D ∪0D, where 0D denotes the 
boundary of D.) Then u1x, y2 attains its maximum value on 0D.
The uniqueness of the solution to the Dirichlet boundary value problem follows from the 
maximum principle. We state this result in the next theorem but leave its proof as an exercise 
(see Problem 19).
Uniqueness of Solution
Theorem 10. Let D be a bounded domain. If there is a continuous solution to the 
Dirichlet boundary value problem
 ∆u1x, y2 = 0 in D ,
 u1x, y2 = f1x, y2 on 0D ,
then the solution is unique.

Solutions to Laplace’s equation in two variables are called harmonic functions. These 
functions arise naturally in the study of analytic functions of a single complex variable. More-
over, complex analysis provides many useful results about harmonic functions. For a discus-
sion of this interaction, we refer the reader to an introductory text on complex analysis such 
as Fundamentals of Complex Analysis, 3rd ed., by E. B. Saﬀ and A. D. Snider (Prentice Hall,

the solution to the Dirichlet problem
 ∆u = 0 ,  in D ,
 u = fi ,  on 0D .

Chapter 10 Summary
Separation of Variables. A classical technique that is eﬀective in solving boundary value 
problems for partial diﬀerential equations is the method of separation of variables. Brieﬂy, the 
idea is to assume ﬁrst that there exists a solution that can be written with the variables sepa-
rated: e.g., u1x, t2 = X1x2T1t2. Substituting u = XT into the partial diﬀerential equation and 
then imposing the boundary conditions leads to the problem of ﬁnding the eigenvalues and 
eigenfunctions for a boundary value problem for an ordinary diﬀerential equation. Solving for 
the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions, one eventually obtains solutions un1x, t2 = Xn1x2Tn1t2, 
n = 1, 2, 3, . . . that solve the partial diﬀerential equation and the homogeneous boundary con-
ditions. Taking inﬁnite linear combinations of the un1x, t2 yields complete solutions of the 
form
u1x, t2 = a
∞
n = 1
 cnun1x, t2 .
The coeﬃcients cn are then obtained using the initial conditions or nonhomogeneous conditions.

Fourier series and the method of separation of variables are used to solve boundary value 
problems and initial-boundary value problems for the three classical equations:

For the heat equation, there is a unique solution u1x, t2 when the boundary values at 
the ends of a conducting wire are specified along with the initial temperature distribu-
tion. The wave equation yields the displacement u1x, t2 of a vibrating string when the 
ends are held fixed and the initial displacement and initial velocity at each point of the 
string are given. In such a case, separation of variables yields a solution that is the sum 
of standing waves. For an infinite string with specified initial displacement and velocity, 
d’Alembert’s solution yields traveling waves. Laplace’s equation arises in the study of 
steady-state solutions to the heat and wave equations.

1. The method of separation of variables is an important 
technique in solving initial-boundary value problems and 
boundary value problems for linear partial diﬀerential 
equations. Explain where the linearity of the diﬀerential 
equation plays a crucial role in the method of separation 
of variables.
2. In applying the method of separation of variables, we 
have encountered a variety of special functions, such 
as sines, cosines, Bessel functions, and modiﬁed Bes-
sel functions. Describe three or four examples of partial 
diﬀerential equations that involve other special func-
tions, such as Legendre polynomials, Hermite polynomi-
als, and Laguerre polynomials. (Some exploring in the 
library may be needed; start with the table on page 483.)
3. A constant-coeﬃcient second-order partial diﬀerential 
equation of the form
a 02u
0x2 + b 02u
0x 0y + c 02u
0y2 = 0
can be classiﬁed using the discriminant D J  b2 - 4ac. In 
particular, the equation is called
hyperbolic  if  D 7 0,  and
elliptic 
if  D 6 0.
Verify that the wave equation is hyperbolic and Laplace’s 
equation is elliptic. It can be shown that such hyperbolic 
(elliptic) equations can be transformed by a linear change of 
variables into the wave (Laplace’s) equation. Based on your 
knowledge of the latter equations, describe which types of 
problems (initial value, boundary value, etc.) are appropri-
ate for hyperbolic equations and elliptic equations.

The method is similar to the ﬁnite-diﬀerence technique discussed in Chapter 4. We begin by 
selecting positive integers m and n and step sizes h and k so that b - a = hm and d - c = kn.
The interval 3a, b4 is now partitioned into m equal subintervals and 3c, d4 into n equal subinter-
vals. The partition points are
xi = a + ih ,   0 … i … m ,
yj = c + jk ,   0 … j … n
(see Figure 10.32). The (dashed) lines x = xi and y = yj are called grid lines and their intersec-
tions 1xi, yj2 are the mesh points of the partition. Our goal is to obtain approximations to the 
solution u1x, y2 of problem (11) at each interior mesh point, i.e., at 1xi, yj2 where 1 … i … m - 1, 
1 … j … n - 1. 3Of course, from (11), we are given the values of u1x, y2 at the boundary mesh 
points, e.g., u1x0, yj2 = g1x0, yj2, 0 … j … n.4
The next step is to approximate the partial derivatives 02u>0x2 and 02u>0y2 using the 
centered-diﬀerence approximations

These approximations are based on the generic formula
y″1x2 = 3y1x + h2 - 2y1x2 + y1x - h24>h2 + 3terms involving h2, h3, c4 ,
which follows from the Taylor series expansion for y1x2.

Electrical engineers often employ transmission lines to guide electromagnetic waves from a 
source to a device. The transmission line may take any of several forms, such as depicted in 
Figure 10.34(a) on page 638. They have common characteristics: uniformity in one direction (z) 
and uniform capacitance, inductance, longitudinal resistance, and transversal resistance per unit 
length in the z direction (if they are operated at low frequency). Thus any short length dz of the 
line can be modeled as an RLC circuit as depicted in Figure 10.34(b).
In the ﬁgure, the circuit parameters are interpreted per unit length; thus the incremental 
inductance is L dz, the incremental capacitance is C dz, the (very low) incremental longitudinal

(f ) Naturally engineers are interested in oscillatory waves on transmission lines, and thanks 
to Euler’s formula (Section 4.3, page 166), solutions to the system (17) can be con-
structed from the real and imaginary parts of solutions of the form V1z, t2 = V1z2eivt
and I1z, t2 = I1z2eivt. (Elaboration of this procedure is given in Project B, Chapter 7,

(h) In the neurons of an invertebrate’s central nervous system, electric signals are propagated 
between Ranvier nodes along axons, which are ﬁbers containing an axoplasm liquid and 
insulated by a myelin sheaf; see Figure 10.35. Their electrical properties are quite simi-
lar to those of the coaxial cable in Figure 10.34 on page 638. However, the inductance is 
negligible. Therefore the voltages in a myelinated axon propagate in accordance with the 
cable equation, which is the transmission line equation (18) with L omitted:

For (a) we can use algebraic substitution, while (b) can be handled with trigonometric 
substitution. For (c) we have available integration by parts, and the integral in (d) will yield to 
partial fractions. But try as we may, no trick is sufficient to give (e) in a finite number of terms. 
By this we mean that if we have available the elementary functions (rational functions, trigo-
nometric functions, inverse trigonometric functions, exponential functions, and logarithmic 
functions) and permit use of the standard operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, 
division, taking roots, and composite functions—a finite number of times, we cannot find a for-
mula for the antiderivative of ex2. A similar conundrum arises with integration of 21 +  cos 2x. 
So we can add a fourth reason for honing our skills with integration techniques: They will help 
us to recognize those integrals that can be expressed in a finite number of terms.
In this context, we are speaking of integration in closed form—analytically—as opposed 
to numerical integration. Thus integration is the inverse of differentiation; it requires finding an 
antiderivative. As a warmup, then, we begin this appendix by jogging your recollection of rules 
for derivatives. We hope you will find our approach a little different and refreshing.
Differentiation
Of course you remember that the derivative of a constant equals zero, and the derivative of a 
sum equals the sum of the derivatives. So let’s jump in with the basic power rule.

In solving differential equations, we cannot overemphasize the importance of integration tech-
niques. Indeed, we sometimes refer to the problem of solving a differential equation by asking, 
“How can we integrate this equation?”
This section is devoted to reviewing three of the standard techniques that will be useful for 
integrating many of the functions encountered in this text. Of course, one can always search in 
a table of integrals (a brief table appears on the inside back cover of this text), but familiarity 
with tricks of integration is a worthwhile investment of time for several reasons: (i) we may not 
find the particular integral we need in the table; (ii) using one of the techniques may be quicker; 
and (iii) we might be curious to know how the various integrals in the table were obtained.
So what techniques can we use for the following integrals?

Appendix A    Review of Integration Techniques          A-3
Now we begin our review of integration with the method of substitution (also called change 
of variable), which is derived from the chain rule.
Method of Substitution
From the formula d
dx
 f1g1x22 = f′1g1x22g′1x2 we obtain
L
f′1g1x22g′1x2dx = f1g1x22 + C .
Thus if we can recognize an integrand as being of the form f′1g1x22g′1x2, then integra-
tion is immediate via the substitution u = g1x2. Here are some simple illustrations:
•	
L
sin3 2x cos 2x dx
Since d1sin 2x2 = 2 cos 2x dx, the substitution u = sin 2x reduces the integration 
to that of u3>2 du.
•	
L
x3e5x4 dx
Observe that x3 is essentially (except for a constant factor) the derivative of 5x4, so 
we set u = 5x4 and integrate eu>20 du.
•	
L
6 ln 1x + 52
x + 5
 dx
Recognizing that 1>1x + 52 is the derivative of ln 1x + 52, we put u = ln 1x + 52 
and integrate 6u du.
•	
L
tan3 x sec x dx
Here it is convenient to use the identity tan2 x = sec2 x - 1 and write the integrand 
as 1sec2 x - 12sec x tan x. Recalling that 1sec x2′ = sec x tan x, the substitution 
u = sec x reduces the problem to integrating 1u2 - 12 du.
When a portion of the integrand involves some fractional power of an expression, an 
algebraic substitution can sometimes simplify the integration process. The technique is amply 
illu-strated in the following example.
Example 1
Find
(1)	
I1 J
L

Solution
The difficulty here arises from the square root factor, so let’s try to rid ourselves of this prob-
lem term by making the substitution u = 22x + 1. Here are the details:
(2)	
u2 = 2x + 1,  x = u2 - 1
2
,  dx = u du .

If we use these expressions in (1), we find that in terms of the new variable u,

2a u5

3 b + C
	
 = u3
3013u2 - 52 + C .
Returning to the original variable x, via u = 22x + 1, we deduce that
I1 = 12x + 123>2
30
3312x + 12 - 54 + C = 12x + 123>2
15
 13x - 12 + C .  ◆
We remark that the substitution u = 22x + 1 is not the only substitution that will allow 
us to compute the integral in (1). Another substitution that works just as well is u = 2x + 1.
In a similar manner we can compute the integrals
L
x3
11 + x223>2 dx  and  
L
ex1>3+1
x2>3  dx
by making the substitution u = 1 + x2 in the first and u = x1>3 + 1 in the second.
The integration of certain algebraic expressions can sometimes be simplified by utiliz-
ing trigonometric substitutions. The effectiveness of these substitutions in handling quadratic 
expressions under a radical derives from the familiar identities
1 -  sin2 u =  cos2 u , 1 +  tan2 u = sec2 u, sec2 u - 1 =  tan2 u .
Accordingly, if the integrand involves:
	
(I)	
2a2 - x2,  set x = a sin u,
	
(II)	
2a2 + x2,  set x = a tan u,
	
(III)	
2x2 - a2,  set x = a sec u.
These substitutions are easy to remember if we associate with each of the cases a right 
triangle whose sides are a, x, and a suitable radical.† The labeling of the triangle depends on the
particular case at hand. For example, in (II) it is clear that the hypotenuse must be 2a2 + x2, 
while in (I) the hypotenuse must be a, and in (III) the hypotenuse is x.
Example 2

This integral is of type (I) with a = 3. We first construct a triangle as shown in Figure A.1.

†The radical sign may not be visible. For example, if the integrand is 1>1a2 + x225, this comes under case (II), because 
1>1a2 + x225 = 1>12a2 + x2210.

From this triangle we see immediately that
I2 =

29 - x2 =

and obtain

directly from the triangle in Figure A.1. We find that
u = arcsin x

Hence

Integration by Parts
The method of integration by parts is of both practical and theoretical importance. It is based 
on the product rule for differentiation which we now write in the format
d
dx
 1uy2 = u dy
dx + y du
dx = uy′ + yu′ .
Integrating both sides of this equation and transposing, we obtain
(4)	
L
uy′dx = uy -
L
yu′dx .
Since dy = y′dx and du = u′dx, equation (4) can be put in the more compact form
(5)	
L
u dY = uY -
L
Y  du .
Equation (5) is the basic equation for integration by parts. The idea is that the integrand on 
the left side may be very complicated, but if we select the part for u and the part for dy quite 
carefully, the integral on the right side may be much easier. (Some experimentation may be 
necessary to find the right selection.)
Appendix A    Review of Integration Techniques          A-5

Appendices
Solution
There are two natural ways of selecting u and dy so that the product is x ln x dx:
First possibility:
let u = x,
dy = ln  x dx.
Second possibility:
let u = ln  x,
dy = x dx.
With the first selection we cannot easily find y, the integral of ln x, so we come to a dead 
end. In the second case we can find y. We arrange the work as follows. Let
u = ln x, dy = x dx .
Then
du = 1
x dx, y = x2
2  .
Making these substitutions in (5), we have for the left side
L
u dy =
L
1ln x21x dx2 =
L
x ln  x dx .
and for the right side
(6)	
uy -
L
y du = x2
2  ln  x -
L
x2
2  1
x dx = x2
2  ln  x - 1
2 L
x dx .
Therefore, by (5),
(7)	
I3 =
L
x ln x dx = x2
2  ln  x - 1
4x2 + C .  ◆
Note that we used y = x2>2 rather than y = x2>2 + C. It is clear that equation (5) is 
­correct for every value of C, and in most cases it is simpler to set C = 0. The arbitrary constant 
that we need can be added in the last step, as we have done in going from equation (6) to (7).
It is sometimes necessary to apply integration by parts more than once in order to evaluate 
a particular integral, such as
I4 J
L
x2ex dx .
In the first application, we set u = x2,  dy = ex dx to deduce that
(8)	
I4 = x2ex - 2
L
xex dx
and to evaluate the last integral in (8) we perform a second application of integration by parts 
with u = x, dy = ex dx.
There are some integrals that may appear at first not to be split into two parts, but we 
need to keep in mind that “1” can be considered as a factor of any expression. For example, to 
compute the integrals
I5 J
L
arctan13x2 dx  and  I6 J
L
 ln  x dx .
an effective splitting for evaluating I5 is u = arctan13x2, dy = 1 dx, while for I6 an appro-
priate choice is u = ln  x, dy = 1 dx. The reader should verify that integration by parts then 
reduces these integrals to routine problems.

Find the indefinite integral I3 J
L
x ln x dx.

Partial Fractions
Any rational function, that is, any function of the form R1x2 = P1x2>Q1x2, where P1x2 and 
Q1x2 are polynomials, can be integrated in finite terms. The first step in the process is to 
compare the degree of P1x2 with that of Q1x2. If deg P Ú deg Q, then division gives
(9)	
P1x2
Q1x2 = s1x2 + p1x2
Q1x2 ,
where s1x2 and p1x2 are polynomials and deg p 6 deg Q. Since the integration of the poly-
nomial s1x2 is a trivial matter, we need only focus on the integration of the remainder term 
p1x2>Q1x2.
The idea of the method of partial fractions is to express p1x2>Q1x2 as the sum of simpler 
fractions that are easy to integrate. For example, knowing that
(10)	
R1x2 =
7x2 + 10x - 1
x3 + 3x2 - x - 3
can be written as
2
x - 1 +
1
x + 1 +
4
x + 3
leads immediately to the evaluation
L
R1x2 dx = 2 ln 0 x - 10 + ln 0 x + 10 + 4 ln 0 x + 30 + C .
The key to finding such a simple fraction representation is to first factor the denominator poly-
nomial Q1x2. Indeed, in (10) the denominator is just the product 1x - 121x + 121x + 32. In 
general, we recall that any polynomial Q1x2 with real coefficients can be factored into a pro-
duct of linear and irreducible quadratic factors with real coefficients. There are four cases that 
may arise in the factorization: (i) nonrepeated linear factors; (ii) repeated linear factors; (iii) 
nonrepeated quadratic factors; and (iv) repeated quadratic factors.
In the case when a nonrepeated linear factor 1x - a2 occurs in the factorization of Q1x2, 
we associate the partial fraction A>1x - a2, where A is a constant to be determined. If a linear 
factor 1x - a2 is repeated m times in the factorization of Q1x2, we associate the sum of m 
fractions
a
m
k = 1
Ak
1x - a2k ,
where the m constants Ak are to be determined. In the case of a nonrepeated quadratic factor 
ax2 + bx + c (where b2 - 4ac 6 0) we associate the single fraction
Ax + B
ax2 + bx + c ,
where we now have two constants in the numerator to be determined, while if this quadratic 
factor is repeated m times, then we associate the sum
a
m
k = 1
Akx + Bk
1ax2 + bx + c2k ,
which involves the determination of 2m constants Ak and Bk.
We illustrate the approach in the following example. Further discussion of partial fractions 
appears in Section 7.4, page 370.

Example 4
Find the indefinite integral I7 =
L
3x3 + 3x2 + 3x + 2
x31x + 12
 dx.
Solution
Since the factor x is repeated three times in the denominator, while 1x + 12 is a nonrepeated 
factor, our partial fraction decomposition must be
(11)	
3x3 + 3x2 + 3x + 2
x31x + 12
=
A
x + 1 + B
x + C
x2 + D
x3 ,
where A, B, C, and D are unknowns to be determined. Multiplying both sides of (11) by 
x31x + 12, we have
(12)	
3x3 + 3x2 + 3x + 2 = Ax3 + Bx21x + 12 + Cx1x + 12 + D1x + 12 .
In order for (12) to be true for all x, the corresponding coefficients must be the same:
The coefficients of x3 yield
A + B                = 3.
The coefficients of x2 yield
B + C        = 3.
The coefficients of x1 yield
C + D = 3.
The coefficients of x0 yield
D = 2.
Solving this system of four linear equations in four unknowns gives A = 1, B = 2, C = 1, 
and D = 2. Hence
I7 =
L

1
x + 1 + 2
x + 1
x2 + 2
x3 bdx = ln 0 1x + 12x20 - 1
x - 1
x2 + C .  ◆
We remark that the coefficients A and D in the representation (11) can be determined 
directly. Indeed, if we set x = 0 in (12), we obtain 2 = D, and if we set x = -1 in (12), we 
obtain -3 + 3 - 3 + 2 = A1 -12 or A = 1. But B and C cannot be obtained so readily. If we 
are fortunate to have a denominator with only nonrepeated linear factors, then this simple sub-
stitution method will work to quickly determine all the unknown coefficients.
In dealing with the integration of rational functions that have a quadratic factor in the 
denominator, the familiar formula
L
1
1 + x2 dx = arctan x + C
plays a central role. For example, by completing the square and making a simple change of 
variables, we find
L

x2 + 4x + 5 dx =
L

1x + 222 + 1 dx = 3 arctan1x + 22 + C .

Figure B.1 Tangent line approximation of root
To solve an equation g1x2 = 0, we must find the point or points where the graph of y = g1x2 
meets the x-axis. One procedure for approximating a solution is Newton’s method.
To motivate Newton’s method geometrically, we let x∼ be a root of g1x2 = 0 and let x1 be 
our guess at the value of x∼. If g1x12 = 0, we are done. If g1x12 ≠0, then we are off by some 
amount that we call dy (see Figure B.1). Then

Now dx = x1 - x2 or x2 = x1 - dx, where x2 is at the point where the tangent line through 
1x1, g1x122 intersects the x-axis (Figure B.1). Using equation (1) and the fact that dy = g1x12, 
we obtain
x2 = x1 -
dy
g′1x12 = x1 - g1x12
g′1x12 ,
which we use as the next approximation to the root x∼.
Repeating this process with x2 in place of x1, we obtain the next approximation x3 to the 
root x∼. In general, we find the next approximation xn+1 by the formula
(2)	
xn+1 = xn −g1xn2
g′1xn2 ,  n = 1, 2, . . .  .
The process is illustrated in Figure B.2.
If the initial guess x1 is sufficiently close to a root x∼, then the sequence of iterations 
5xn6∞
n = 1  usually converges to the root x∼. However, if we make a bad guess for x1, then the 
process may lead away from x∼.

Example 1
Find a root to four decimal places of the equation
(3)	
x3 + 2x - 4 = 0 .
Solution
Setting g1x2 = x3 + 2x - 4, we find that g′1x2 = 3x2 + 2 is positive for all x. Hence, g is 
increasing and has at most one zero. Furthermore, since g112 = -1 and g122 = 8, this zero 
must lie between 1 and 2. Thus, we begin the procedure with the initial guess x1 = 1.5. For 
g1x2 = x3 + 2x - 4, equation (2) becomes
(4)	
xn+1 = xn - x3
n + 2xn - 4
3x2
n + 2
 ,  n = 1, 2, . . .  .
With x1 = 1.5, equation (4) gives
x2 = 1.5 - 11.523 + 211.52 - 4
311.522 + 2
= 1.5 - 2.375
8.75 ≈1.22857 .

Using x2 to compute x3 and so on, we find
x3 = 1.18085 ,
x4 = 1.17951 ,
x5 = 1.17951 ,
where we have rounded off the computations to five decimal places. Since x4 and x5 agree to 
four decimal places and we are uncertain of the fifth decimal place because of roundoff, we 
surmise that the root x∼ of (3) agrees with 1.1795 to four decimal places. Indeed,
g11.17952 = -0.00005 . . .    and    g11.17962 = 0.00056 . . .  ,
so 1.1795 6 x∼6 1.1796. Consequently, x∼= 1.1795 . . . .  ◆
Observe that Newton’s method transforms the problem of finding a root to the equation 
g1x2 = 0 into the problem of finding a fixed point for the function h1x2 = x - g1x2>g′1x2; 
that is, finding a number x such that x = h1x2. [See equation (2).]
Several theorems give conditions that guarantee that the sequence of iterations 5xn6∞
n = 1  
defined by (2) will converge to a zero of g1x2. We mention one such result.
Convergence of Newton’s Method
Theorem 1.	
Suppose a zero x∼ of g1x2 lies in the interval 1a, b2 and that in this interval
g′1x2 7 0  and  g″1x2 7 0 .
If we select x1 so that x∼6 x1 6 b, then the sequence of iterations defined by (2) will 
decrease to x∼.
We do not give a proof of this theorem, but refer the reader to an introductory numerical 
analysis text such as Numerical Analysis, 10th ed., by R. Burden, J. Faires, and A. Burden 
(Cengage Learning, 2016).
A useful procedure for approximating the value of a definite integral is Simpson’s rule.
Let the interval [a, b] be divided into 2n equal parts and let x0, x1, . . . , x2n be the points of 
the partition, that is,
xk J a + kh  ,  k = 0, 1, . . . , 2n ,
where h J 1b - a2>12n2. If

When a system of n linear equations in n unknowns has a unique solution, determinants can be 
used to obtain a formula for the unknowns. This procedure is called Cramer’s rule. When n is 
small, these formulas provide a simple procedure for solving the system.
Suppose that for a system of n linear equations in n unknowns,

a21x1 + a22x2 + g + a2nxn = b2 ,

The method of least squares is a procedure for fitting a straight line to a set of measured 
data. Consider the scatter diagram in Figure E.1, consisting of an x, y-plot of some data points 
51xi, yi2: i = 1, 2, . . . , N6. It is desired to construct the straight line y = a + bx that best 
fits the data points, in the sense that the sum of the squares of the vertical deviations from the 
points to the line is minimized.

Figure E.1 Scatter diagram and least-squares linear fit
If the y-axis intercept a and the slope b of the line are known, then the y-value on the line 
corresponding to the measured x-value xi is given by a + bxi. The corresponding measured 
y-value, yi, thus deviates from the line by 3yi - 1a + bxi24, and the total sum of squares of 
deviations is
S J a
N
i = 1
3yi - 1a + bxi242 .
The interesting feature of the function S is that the symbols xi and yi are constants, while a 
and b are the (unknown) variables. The values of a and b that minimize S will force its partial 
derivatives to be zero:
0 = 0S
0a = a

i = 1
23yi - 1a + bxi241-12 ,
0 = 0S
0b = a

i = 1

Displaying these conditions in a form that emphasizes the roles of a and b, we rewrite them

	 7.	 (a)  The velocity, which is always perpendicular to the 
lever arm, is / du>dt. Thus, (lever arm) times (per-
pendicular momentum) = / m/ du>dt = m/2du>dt.
	
(b)  The component of the gravitational force perpendic-
ular to lever arm is mg sin u, and is directed toward 
decreasing u. Thus, torque = -/mg  sin u.

	 1.	 Let Y1t2 = y1-t2. Then 
Y′1t2 = -y′1-t2, Y″1t2 = y″1-t2. But 
y″1s2 - sy1s2 = 0, so y″1-t2 + ty1-t2 = 0 or 
Y″1t2 + tY1t2 = 0.
	 3.	 The spring stiffness is 1-6y2, so it opposes negative 
displacements 1y 6 02 and reinforces positive displace-
ments 1y 7 02. Initially y 6 0 and y′ 6 0, so the (posi-
tive) stiffness reverses the negative velocity and restores 
y to 0. Thereafter, y 7 0 and the negative stiffness drives 
y to + ∞.
	 5.	 (a)  y″ = 2y3 = d

METHOD OF UNDETERMINED COEFFICIENTS
To find a particular solution to the constant-coefficient differential equation
ay″ + by′ + cy = Pm1t2ert ,
where Pm1t2 is a polynomial of degree m, use the form
yp1t2 = ts1Amtm + g + A1t + A02ert ;
if r is not a root of the associated auxiliary equation, take s = 0; if r is a simple root of 
the associated auxiliary equation, take s = 1; and if r is a double root of the associated 
auxiliary equation, take s = 2.
To find a particular solution to the differential equation
ay″ + by′ + cy = Pm1t2eat cos bt + Qn1t2eat sin bt ,  b ≠0 ,
where Pm1t2 is a polynomial of degree m and Qn1t2 is a polynomial of degree n, use the 
form
yp1t2 = ts1Aktk + g + A1t + A02eat cos bt
 
+ ts1Bktk + g + B1t + B02eat sin bt ,
where k is the larger of m and n. If a + ib is not a root of the associated auxiliary equa-
tion, take s = 0; if a + ib is a root of the associated auxiliary equation, take s = 1.
VARIATION OF PARAMETERS FORMULA
If y1 and y2 are two linearly independent solutions to ay″ + by′ + cy = 0, then a 
particular solution to ay″ + by′ + cy = f  is y = y1y1 + y2y2, where
