Security + 701 - Study Plan 
 
This study plan contains general study tips, an overview of how to create and use flash cards 
effectively, other study tools, a suggested 30 day study plan, and a suggested 60 day study plan. 
The purpose is to provide students with some general information and a general plan that they 
can adapt to fit their own learning goals. 
 
General Study Tips 
● Studying and learning are very individualistic.  Not everything works for everybody. Find 
the tools, methods, and strategies that work for you. 
● The average person has an attention span of 20-30 minutes.  
○ Once you have reached the limit of your attention on a task you should do 
something else for a while. 
○ Any time you spend studying beyond your attention span is generally wasted 
time because you the studying will become increasingly inefficient. 
○ The key to maintaining attention is to divide work into different tasks and 
alternate types of tasks. For example, you can watch videos for 20 minutes, then 
review notes for 10 minutes, then work on learning tools for 15 minutes, then 
get up and move around for 15 minutes before returning to videos. You can also 
alternate watching videos with another task like working on learning tools. 
● Be realistic and learn how you learn. If you have a shorter attention span, then set your 
study time accordingly. Try some different time spans and activities and see what works. 
If, for example, sitting still makes you lose focus quickly, try to engage in some activity 
such as following along with the closed captions, taking notes, or even walking around 
as you watch the video.  
○ If a strategy or tool isn’t working after a few days of trying it, change to it. 
Learning how you learn is mainly the result of trial and error. 
● Once you have the plan set, establish small rewards for following the plan. This could be 
30 minutes of uninterrupted video game time, a food or drink treat, or anything else 
that will motivate you to stick to the plan. The reward is just for following through on 
the plan for that day, not for getting a particular score on a practice exam or a quiz. 
● Find the balance between strictly following the plan you created and extreme flexibility. 
○ Strictly following a plan that isn’t working or is too ambitious will create anxiety 
and you will lose motivation. If the 30 day plan is creating too much anxiety, you 
can switch to the 60 day plan, or modify it so it fits with your learning style. 
○ Being extremely flexible, for example, constantly changing the plan, will cause 
you to lose focus and lose motivation. 
● Don’t beat yourself up over a perceived failure. This includes not sticking to the plan, 
failing a quiz, or failing a practice exam. Instead think about the factors that may have 
led to the perceived failure. 
○ If the factor is something in your control, change it. For example, if you planned 
on studying for an hour and lost focus after 30 minutes, change up the plan to 
make it work for your attention span. If studying during your lunch break was 

interrupted by people talking in your lunch space, change the lunch space or 
schedule your studying for another time. 
○ If the factor is not in your control, ignore it.  Life happens and feeling badly about 
things beyond your control isn’t helpful. 
 
How to Use the Videos Effectively 
● As you watch the videos  
○ Add notes to the study guide 
○ Highlight terms and concepts you want to make flashcards for 
○ Mark terms or sections based on how well you understand them 
○ Put question marks next to any concepts you want to do more research on 
● After you watch a section  
○ Reread the study guide and the notes you have made to ensure you understand 
what you wrote while the material is still fresh in your mind 
○ Create flashcards or study tools 
○ Review the previous day’s flashcards or study tools 
 
How to Use the Practice Exams Effectively 
● While taking the practice exams 
○ Follow the tips from the Conclusion 
■ Do a brain dump when you begin the exam to practice the process and to 
see whether it will be helpful to you 
● After you take a practice exam  
○ Review the questions that you got incorrect 
■ Read the explanation  
■ Add to your flashcards or study tools and to your study guide 
○ Review the brain dump you created and evaluate whether you should make 
changes to it 
○ Make a list of the objectives for the questions that you got correct and those you 
got incorrect. Using a tracking chart like the one below will help you see trends

How to Make Retaking the Exam an Effective Learning Tool 
● When you retake the exam 
○ When you read a question that you remember, take a moment and think 
through why the correct answer is correct instead of just clicking on the 
remembered correct answer 
● After you retake the exam 
○ Review the questions that you got incorrect 

■ Read the explanation  
■ Add to your flashcards or study tools and to your study guide 
○ Review the brain dump you created and evaluate whether you should make 
changes to it 
○ Add the retake to the tracking chart 
 
How to Use Flashcards Effectively 
Flash Cards can be a very effective learning tool if they are set up correctly and used correctly 
and consistently.  In general, there are two types of flash cards: Written and Apps. Each has its 
advantages and disadvantages.  
 
Written Flashcards 
● Writing is an effective way to create memories, so writing your own flash cards will help 
you to remember material even if you don’t use the flashcards later. 
● Set up your flash cards consistently. For example, use the lined side of the card for 
definitions and the blank side for terms.  Visual clues (like lines) often work in our 
subconscious to help us remember. 
● Use colored flash cards to distinguish different parts of content. For example, use pink 
cards for learning ports and protocols. This creates a visual clue and helps you associate 
the term with the content that it falls under. 
● Consider drawing pictures and diagrams on the cards. 
● When you go through the flashcards, sort them into stacks based on how confident you 
are that you know the material or how much time it takes you to think of the answer. 
See if you can get all of the cards into the stack that represents that you know the 
answers. 
○ Examples stacks for how long it took you to think of the answer 
■ Knew it right away 
■ Had to think for a moment 
■ Had to think for a while 
■ Had to look at the answer 
Flash Card Apps 
● There are many flash card apps available.  Most are free or low cost. They often contain 
games or methods of going through the cards that are designed specifically to make 
your studying more efficient. They also prevent you from just thinking “I know that” and 
moving on by requiring you to perform a task to prove you know it. 
● Some apps offer ready made stacks that have been created by other students.  While 
this may seem like a quick alternative, many of these stacks are not set up well and may 
contain errors.  Making your own is a more reliable way to ensure the quality of the set 
up and content. 
● The most important part of the set up for flash card apps is consistency.  Generally, you 
should have short answers and longer definitions, descriptions, or questions. Be sure 
that the answers are consistently on one side of the card. 
○ This becomes important when using apps that have you type the answer, which 
is the best way to determine if you know the correct answer. Shorter answers 

will allow you to type the answer more effectively and quickly. If the answer is a 
sentence or longer phrase you won’t be able to remember the exact words in 
the answer and you will be marked wrong even when your answer was really 
correct. 
● Flash card apps like Quizlet and Anki have modes that help you learn content by first 
setting up multiple choice questions and then fill in the blank questions. This is based on 
research into memory and how to create it. 
● Brainscape uses a confidence measure to sort cards into stacks similar to how you would 
use written flashcards. This can be very effective as long as you are honest in your 
confidence ranking. 
● Some apps allow you to create lists in word processing programs and then importing 
them into the program.  This is very handy and makes creating the cards faster and 
more consistent. Normally you type the answer, then tab and write the question. You 
copy and paste the whole page of answers and questions into the app. 
 
Other Study Tools/Methods 
● Using the exam objectives and turning them into questions can be a powerful way to 
figure out what areas you need to work harder on.  
○ Objective 5.5:  Explain types and purposes of audits and assessments.  
○ Term: Attestation 
○ Question: What is the purpose of attestation? 
● ChatGPT offers a way to check your learning. Enter a question into ChatGPT. Before you 
look at the ChatGPT answer, write an answer of your own. Compare your answer to 
ChatGPT’s answer.
