lthough it came into being a couple of 
decades before I entered the job market, 
‚ÄúNew Journalism‚Äù was one of the reasons I 
became a writer and editor. I grew up reading 
Hunter S. Thompson‚Äôs stories in Rolling Stone. Yes, 
there were lots of drugs, but also politics, music, 
and more, colored by the unmistakable voice of the 
the author. 
What was ‚Äúnew‚Äù then is now just another way of 
reporting a story. The media industry is in crisis, no 
doubt, but there has probably never been a better 
WLPHWR¬øQGORQJIRUPSHUVRQDOLW\GULYHQ
journalism. Hard as it is to make a living as a 
journalist, the pages of The Atlantic, Harper‚Äôs, The 
New Yorker, and EsquireDUHVWLOO¬øOOHGZLWKJRRG
reads. Except that now, most people read those 
stories online. 
The old (traditional) style of journalism‚Äîfacts 
imparted with an objective voice‚Äîhas had a 
tougher time in the Internet era, though. Why? 
Click on a story, and Google News serves you 100 
more stories covering the same topic, often with the 
same facts and photos. There is simply no reason to 
scroll down. Anyone writing stories that don‚Äôt 
DSSHDUDERYHWKHIROGLV¬øQGLQJLWKDUGWRSD\ELOOV
these days.
To succeed in media, you need to bring some 
unique value. That could be new facts, but those are 
easily copied and not copyrightable. The value 
could be a unique voice and perspective, but that is 
reserved for the most talented among us. Just look 
at the scores of failed Thompson impersonators as 
proof (myself among them). 
The 
New New 
Journalism
DAN COSTA
FIRST WORD

@dancosta
Technology is providing a new frontier for 
journalism, however, and virtual reality is at the 
very edge of it. In this month‚Äôs cover story, ‚ÄúVR 
Gets Real: Immersive Storytelling in Journalism,‚Äù 
PCMag‚Äôs Terry Sullivan tours the latest 
experiences in virtual reality (VR) journalism. 
These aren‚Äôt games or demos‚Äîthey‚Äôre engaging, 
interactive depictions of the most important 
stories of our time. 
What is it like to be deaf? The New York Times can 
bring you there. Where are 860,000 Rohingya 
refugees sleeping at night? Al Jazeera can bring 
you there. When do you start to lose your mind 
ZKHQ\RX¬∂UHFRQ¬øQHGLQDE\IRRWFHOO"The 
Guardian can bring you there. (A project called 
‚ÄúNotes on Blindness,‚Äù covered in our story, was the 
inspiration for the cover of this issue.)
PCMag has written a lot about VR hardware and 
games, but the real power of virtual reality may lie 
in bringing us closer to reality. It isn‚Äôt always 
pretty, but it has the potential to effectively foster 
empathy and learning in a world made weary by 
too much of the same information.

major philosophy in the IT arena. ‚ÄúChange‚Äù is 
used to justify paying all those highly-paid IT

the two-hour blackout in Central Hall of the Las Vegas Convention

$4,000 treadmills that deliver live workout classes on HD screens.
There were plenty of less surprising, though no less welcome, innovations on 
display as well. We weren‚Äôt surprised to see voice assistance play a bigger role 
than ever this year, for instance. But we didn‚Äôt necessarily expect to see it 
embedded in the bathroom, where it can start your shower or turn on your 
toilet‚Äôs foot warmer.
We‚Äôve gathered our favorite 21 new products and technologies from the show.

WHAT‚ÄôS NEW NOW

BEST LAPTOP
Acer Swift 7
Dubbed the world‚Äôs thinnest notebook, the Swift 7 measures just 0.39-inch 
thick and weighs 2.48 pounds. With a sturdy aluminum build, it avoids feeling

Swift 7 drew audible excitement and instant comparisons to a MacBook Air 
from our photographer, I knew Acer had succeeded with its design. It will arrive 
this spring at $1,699, packing an HD touch display, an Intel Core i7 processor, 
and 4G LTE connectivity.‚ÄîMatthew Buzzi
BEST CONVERTIBLE HYBRID LAPTOP
Dell XPS 15 2-in-1
The premium XPS line has been consistently lauded for its quality build and 
solid feature set, and Dell is now bringing that experience to a convertible 15-

inch system. Convertibles this size often raise eyebrows, as the screen is 
arguably too large to be used comfortably in Tablet mode, but the XPS 15 is the 
slimmest on the market. This, along with a high-quality build, helps mitigate

on the road.‚ÄîMB
BEST WINDOWS TABLET
Lenovo Miix 630
With a starting price of $799, the Lenovo Miix 630 detachable tablet is on the 
less expensive end of a brand-new crop of PCs that run power-sipping 
Qualcomm Snapdragon processors originally designed for smartphones. It‚Äôs got 
DLQFKIXOO+'WRXFKVFUHHQWKDW¬∂VIRUWL¬øHGZLWK&RUQLQJ*RULOOD*ODVV$
kickstand is built into the back of the tablet to prop it up when the keyboard is 
attached, and the whole thing weighs less than 3 pounds. The big draw here: 
Lenovo claims the Miix 630 lasts up to 20 hours between battery charges. Even 
better, that estimate assumes you‚Äôll use it as you would a smartphone‚Äîrarely 
turning it off and accessing the internet both via Wi-Fi and the included LTE 
modem. Depending on the cost of wireless service plans and whether that 
battery claim is true, this Windows tablet has the potential to be a road 
warrior‚Äôs best friend when it goes on sale this spring.‚ÄîTom Brant

BEST PHONE
Honor View 10
The Honor View 10 sets the bar for value. Huawei‚Äôs low-cost spinoff brand is 
bringing a 6-inch phone with tons of RAM and storage, an AI-enhanced camera, 
DQGD√ÄDJVKLSOHYHO.LULQSURFHVVRUWRWKH86IRUOHVVWKDQ¬≤WKDW

years now, and this device expands its market to people who aren‚Äôt looking to 
make compromises.‚ÄîSascha Segan

6LPLODUWRWKH0LV¬øW3KDVHEXWGHVLJQHGZLWKVPDOOHUZULVWVLQPLQGWKH0LV¬øW
Path is a beautiful smartwatch that looks more like an analog timepiece. It 
tracks steps, calories burned, distance, and sleep, and it displays call, text, and 
DSSQRWL¬øFDWLRQV6ZLPPHUVZLOOEHKDSS\WRQRWHLW¬∂VVDIHIRUWKHSRRODQG
shower. The Path launches this spring, and at $150, it‚Äôs stylish and affordable.
‚ÄîVictoria Song

BEST HEALTH AND FITNESS DEVICE
Peloton Tread
Though a $4,000 treadmill is undoubtedly extravagant, the Peloton Tread sets 
itself apart with a 32-inch HD touch screen. For $39 per month, you can stream 
more than 10 daily live classes as well as guided workouts. You can view your 
stats at the bottom of the screen and check out a leaderboard of other Peloton 
users on the side. That should be enough to motivate you, if spending all that 
money on a treadmill doesn‚Äôt do the trick.‚ÄîVS
BEST CAR
Fisker EMotion
Henrik Fisker cut his teeth working on sports cars for Aston Martin and BMW, 
and it shows in his latest design, the Fisker EMotion. This gorgeous sports 
VHGDQFRXOGKDYHZRQRQORRNVDORQHZLWKJUHDWOLQHVDQGEXWWHU√Ä\GRRUVEXWLW

PLOHV)LVNHUSURPLVHVDUDGLFDOQHZEDWWHU\GHVLJQLQOHVVWKDQ¬øYH\HDUVWKDW
will increase range to 500 miles and require only 9 minutes of charge time. So 

smart power coupled with a host of luxury and connected car features 
(including advanced LiDAR-based autonomous driving capabilities being 
developed through a partnership with Quanergy) make this $129,000 sports car 
the belle of the CES ball.‚ÄîOliver Rist
BEST CAR ACCESSORY
Raven
New cars just keep getting smarter and more connected. And nowhere is that 
more obvious than at CES. But what if you‚Äôre not ready to trade up your couple-
of-years-old ride just yet? The $300 Raven sits on your dashboard and packs a 
Wi-Fi hotspot, GPS, security system, vehicle diagnostic system, and front- and 
cabin-facing video cameras in a box no bigger than your rearview mirror. It 
even gives you feedback on your driving skills.‚ÄîWendy Sheehan Donnell
BEST DRONE
Tello

phone or optional Bluetooth gamepad, with a modest 720p video camera. But 

the price is a big plus, especially when you consider that it‚Äôs powered by Intel 
and DJI tech. The Tello is also a teaching tool; it can be programmed with MIT‚Äôs 
Scratch language, and anything that teaches you (or your kids) to code is a plus 
in our book.‚ÄîJim Fisher
BEST CAMERA/PHONE ACCESSORY
DJI Osmo Mobile 2
The Osmo Mobile 2 is our pick for the best camera gear of CES, even though it 
doesn‚Äôt have a lens or sensor. The $129 handheld gimbal works with both 
Android and iOS phones. It keeps handheld video silky smooth, can be mounted 
on a tripod, and has an app that adds time-lapse and other capabilities to your 
phone‚Äôs camera. It‚Äôs less expensive than its predecessor but has three times the 
battery life‚Äî15 hours.‚ÄîJF

BEST SMART HOME DEVICE
JBL Link View Smart Display
We saw a ton of devices with integrated Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant at 
CES this year‚Äîcars, bathrooms, TiVos, you name it. But the most important 
category for Google was its four smart displays, which give Google Assistant a 
solid (and YouTube-enabled) competitor for the Amazon Echo Show. Though 
we love the industrial design of Lenovo‚Äôs model, JBL‚Äôs‚Äîwhich appears to be 
based on its Link 300 speaker‚Äîlooks like it will offer better audio, making it a 
√ÄH[LEOHKRPHHQWHUWDLQPHQWDQGKRPHFRQWUROFHQWHU¬≤SS
BEST TELEVISION
The Wall by Samsung
We thought the TV-size race was over, since manufacturing an LCD panel of 
PRUHWKDQLQFKHVLVSURKLELWLYHO\GLI¬øFXOWDQGH[SHQVLYH6DPVXQJVXUSULVHG

us with a 140-inch monster that doesn‚Äôt use LCD or OLED. The Wall by 
Samsung reaches its massive size by using MicroLEDs, millions of tiny light-
emitting diodes arranged in an array. LED arrays are used for huge commercial 
signs and usually have giant pixels that are easily visible unless you‚Äôre several 
dozen feet away, but the Wall‚Äôs pixels are just 0.8 millimeters, which promises a 
viewing experience that‚Äôs closer to a TV than a billboard.‚ÄîWill Greenwald
BEST HOME THEATER GEAR
TCL Alto
Roku announced its Roku Connect software to encourage the development of 
audio products that work with its media streamers and licensed Roku TVs. TCL

simply a soundbar designed to work with TCL Roku TVs or any other device 
that uses Roku OS. It enables voice control with the Roku Entertainment 
Assistant, wireless playback of music without using your TV, and basically 
brings audio-only options into the Roku ecosystem.‚ÄîWG

BEST AUDIO GEAR
Libratone Track+
Libratone is best known for its speakers but has proven its chops at making 
earphones with the excellent Adapt Q Lightning. Now the company is 
combining noise cancellation technology and a workout-friendly design into an 
impressive set of wireless earphones. The $200 Libratone Track+ might not be 
completely wire-free like so many other new pairs, but they incorporate 
adjustable active noise cancellation and are resistant to splashes, all at a slightly 
friendlier price than the Bose QuietControl 30.‚ÄîWG
BEST NETWORKING GEAR
Asus Lyra Voice
In a world with way too many gadgets, we savor devices that multitask well. The 
Asus Lyra Voice pulls triple duty as a tri-band AC2200 mesh Wi-Fi router, a 
speaker, and a digital assistant. With a built-in microphone, two eight-watt 

speakers, and Amazon Alexa on board, you can use the Lyra Voice to answer 
queries, play music, control your smart home devices, and take advantage of 
Alexa‚Äôs many third-party skills. The Voice pairs with other Lyra routers to 
provide whole-home 802.11ac Wi-Fi, while the discrete speakers deliver ‚Äúrich 
and powerful sound,‚Äù according to Asus. We‚Äôll test those claims when we review 
the Lyra Voice, but we applaud Asus‚Äô ability to pack this much functionality into 
a slick and compact package.‚ÄîWSD
BEST GAMING PC
Digital Storm Spark
I saw plenty of nice gaming systems at CES, but the Spark stood out for its small 
size. It‚Äôs only 12 inches tall and 4 inches wide, yet it‚Äôs full of enthusiast-level 
components as well as custom liquid-cooling piping. You can start a build at 
$1,299 with an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060, but the same tiny body can handle 
XSWRD*7;DQGDQ,QWHO&RUHL.SURFHVVRU,W¬∂VDQLPSUHVVLYHIHDW
of engineering, and the black aluminum body, interior window, and 
customizable lighting look super sleek. This was a better year for gaming 
desktops than laptops‚ÄîI saw nice PCs from Origin, as well‚Äîbut manufacturers 
are in a holding pattern as they wait for the next generation of Intel processors 
before releasing new notebooks later this year.‚ÄîMB

BEST GAMING GEAR
Razer Mamba HyperFlux

HyperFlux is expensive at $249, but high-end gaming purchases tend to be 
luxury buys to begin with, and the innovation just might be worth it.‚ÄîMB
BEST AR/VR HEADSET
Lenovo Mirage Solo
The Lenovo Mirage Solo pumps new life into Google‚Äôs Daydream platform by 
freeing it from the phone. It‚Äôs an entirely liberated VR headset, in fact: With no 

wires and six degrees of freedom, it promises VR experiences you can run, 
MXPSDQGZDONWKURXJKZLWKRXWZRUU\LQJDERXWWULSSLQJRYHUZLUHV8VLQJWKH
Mirage Solo is far less kludgey than dropping your phone into a headset, and it 
uses a superior processor to the upcoming Oculus Go. This is the future of 
mobile VR.‚ÄîSS
BEST ROBOT
Sony Aibo
Man‚Äôs best robot friend is back. The new and improved Sony Aibo is more 
lovable than ever. With advanced sensors, better AI, and a friendlier design, the 
new Aibo can recognize your family, stream video (through its nose), nuzzle 
your hand, and learn its environment. It‚Äôs available only in Japan at the 
moment and costs a hefty 198,000 yen (nearly $1,800), but at least it won‚Äôt pee 
on your carpet.‚ÄîVS

BEST CONCEPT/PROTOTYPE
LG Rollable OLED TV
Paper-thin screens you can simply roll up have been futuristic fantasies for 
years. That won‚Äôt likely change anytime soon, but LG Display is pushing the 
technology a bit closer to reality with its 65-inch rollable OLED screen: It rolls

by behemoth corporations suddenly were in your own hands. You could make 
your own videos, your own stories. You could go around and show them. There 
weren‚Äôt restrictions. You could do porn, etc., and it was a very exciting time. I 
learned that I liked working with machines. The possibility of working with 
these machines to do social change and art was intriguing. 
Eventually, I left Ithaca to go to San Francisco. One must leave the college town 
or become pitiful. And one day, I was walking on Market Street, and there in the 
window of dearly departed Radio Shack was the TRS-80‚Äîaffectionately known 
as the Trash-80‚Äîand I thought, ‚ÄúOh, is this anything like a Portapak? What can 
you do with this thing? Can you make art, social activism?
So on an impulse, I bought it. And then there was the issue of programming. It‚Äôs 
a little harder than getting started with a Portapak, [where you just] press the 
EXWWRQ,IRXQGLWGLI¬øFXOWEXWWKHJRRGGLI¬øFXOW,WKLQNWKDWDQ\RQHZKRZDQWV
to go into software engineering has to feel, ‚ÄòYeah, this hard,‚Äô but also the 
pleasure of the hunt. If there isn‚Äôt some sense of seduction about solving 
problems, it‚Äôs going to be a very unhappy experience.
And people today don‚Äôt quite understand that back then, when you 
bought a TRS-80 at Radio Shack, it didn‚Äôt do a lot. You have to make it 
do things. You have to learn how to use it, and that‚Äôs sort of the 
invitation that you took it up on?
Yes, there was a blank screen. It was already an obsolete television at the time. 
It had a keyboard, and you recorded programs on a reel-to-reel cassette. And I 
think it held maybe 4K. That was the maximum program size. And it had the 
BASIC language. And I don‚Äôt know if people know the difference between 
interpreted and compiled language. Interpreted means it just executes it right 
in front of you. So you... enter... two plus two and it shows you four. That‚Äôs easy, 
JHWWLQJWKH¬øUVWOLWWOHWKLQJVJRLQJ'RLQJDQ\WKLQJVLJQL¬øFDQWZDVYHU\GLI¬øFXOW
especially since early BASIC had many traps. Like you could say ‚ÄúGo To‚Äù but it 
didn‚Äôt automatically Go Back. So you could lose your way in the tangle, and it 
was known as the Geddy code. Again, it was frustrating and intriguing.

When I was looking through the book and you talk 
about those early years, what strikes me is the 
people that you were working with. It almost 
seems more like a ragtag collection of artists than 
engineers and hardcore programmers. Can you 
talk a little bit about the esprit de corps, or the 
people you were working with?
Yes. If you look back and‚Äîyou know who Stewart Brand 
is, the Whole Earth ‚ÄòLectronic Catalog, The Well‚Äîthat 
ZDVRQHRIWKH¬øUVWRQOLQHFRPPXQLWLHV$QGWKHSHRSOH
were attracted to it. You know John Markoff‚Äôs book, 
What the Dormouse Said?
Sure.
You know, stoners and dropouts and people who were 
just crazy, and wanted to have fun. That was the 
atmosphere that drew me in, like the Portapak. These 
ZHUHSHRSOHKDYLQJIXQH[SORULQJ$QGWKH¬øUVWSHRSOH,
worked with when I had to take a job and earn a living

doing a dissertation and art history, some guy from 
France who smoked Gauloises, though smoking was not 
permitted. And he‚Äôd say, ‚ÄúA computer never told me to 
stop smoking.‚Äù And these are the kind of people we 
worked with.
Somewhere around ‚Äò83 to ‚Äò86, it changed. Computer 
Science became a common degree, Software 
Engineering. And we were joined by a heavily male, 
self-selected group who had studied Computer Science 
as an undergraduate degree. And the atmosphere 
completely changed. People were harder to talk to. In 
my experience, [they] were not as well rounded. That is 
a very broad generalization.
I was 
walking on 
Market Street, 
and there in 
the window 
of dearly 
departed Radio 
Shack was the 
TRS-80...

I worked with men who were very well rounded. You could quote Shakespeare 
with the best of them. But that whole atmosphere changed. I guess it‚Äôs because 
the profession had to lose its innocence.
How were you inspired to do coding?

program running, there was a rush of pleasure. ‚ÄòWow, it works. I did that.‚Äô It

carburetor. You know, you take things apart. You put them back together and 
the car starts, right? So this is a rare pleasure, and it‚Äôs hard to get to. Once I had 
that feeling, it was a little bit like a drug, you know. You got that high and then 
you lose it, and then you get it back it, or you try to.
You talk a lot about this in the book. You say, everybody should learn 
how to code because it is hard. And that difÔ¨Åculty is eventually going be 
the sense of satisfaction that you get from it.
I‚Äôm not telling everyone to learn to code. As I said, people need to be exposed to 
it. The point is to demystify code. We are surrounded by algorithms that control 
us, and this is no news to anybody who just got hacked by Equifax, for instance. 
One-third of the adult population of the United States. So, the point is to know 
enough that it‚Äôs written by people and it can be changed by people.
There is a councilman in the Bronx who is proposing a bill there that the 
borough looks at all the algorithms that they are using, and they go from police 
assignments to garbage pick-up schedules to what school the kids go to, and 
look for bias in them. This is the process that I‚Äôm hoping for, that people in the 
general public begin to see that these things can be changed. They have bias, 
and that bias can be addressed.

M
ost days, I dream of chucking my 
iPhone 7 off a cliff. I imagine this $750 
slab hurtling through the air, skipping 
across the surface of a turbulent ocean, and 
sinking deep, deep down into the murky depths. 
When that doesn‚Äôt work, I picture dropping it out 
a window and watching the screen shatter against 
the sidewalk, a thousand hairline cracks 
zigzagging across its glossy surface like lightning.
Hi. I‚Äôm a millennial, and I‚Äôm suffering from an 
acute case of technological exhaustion.
Surprising, I know. Millennials are supposed to

I‚Äôll be sitting at my desk, or in a movie theater,

my body. It starts with the phone in my pocket

days, I feel buzzes where there are none.

so you become addicted to making sure it‚Äôs

You‚Äôd be surprised how much time you lose

friends were doing, possibly without me. If I had 
a crush, I never had to give myself pep talks in the 
mirror to avoid stalking their every single waking 
decision on social media like a mildly unhinged 
psychopath. It only takes one buzz to break your

Once your friends and family know you‚Äôre always

consoling your elderly father that no, you are not

Whatever you asked, a synthesized version of a 
woman likely answered you, polite and 
deferential, pleasant no matter the tone or topic.

When performed by humans, these tasks have

outdated gender stereotypes. But companies have

that position, we enforce a harmful culture.
Still, consumers expect a friendly, helpful female 
in this kind of scenario, and that is what 
companies give them.
‚ÄúWe tested many voices with our internal beta 
program and customers before launching and this 
voice tested best,‚Äù an Amazon spokesperson told 
PCMag.
A Microsoft spokesperson said Cortana can 
technically be genderless, but the company did 
immerse itself in gender research when choosing 
DYRLFHDQGZHLJKHGWKHEHQH¬øWVRIDPDOHDQG
female voice. ‚ÄúHowever, for our objectives‚Äî
building a helpful, supportive, trustworthy 
assistant‚Äîa female voice was the stronger 
choice,‚Äù according to Redmond.
Apple‚Äôs Siri and the Google Assistant currently 
offer the option to switch to a male voice; Siri 
since 2013 and Google since October. But Alexa 
and Cortana don‚Äôt have male counterparts.
Consider that IBM‚Äôs Watson, an AI of a higher 
order, speaks with a male voice as it works 
alongside physicians on cancer treatment and 
handily wins Jeopardy. When choosing Watson‚Äôs 
voice for Jeopardy, IBM went with one that was 
VHOIDVVXUHGDQGKDGLWXVHVKRUWGH¬øQLWLYH
phrases. Both are typical of male speech‚Äîand 
people prefer to hear a masculine-sounding voice 
from a leader, according to research‚Äîso Watson 
got a male voice.
Women, meanwhile, use more pronouns and 
tentative words than men, according to 
@chansteele
Chandra Steele

Psychologist James W. Pennebaker. Pronoun use, 
particularly of the word ‚ÄúI,‚Äù is indicative of lower 
social status. AI assistants are very prone to using 
the word ‚ÄúI,‚Äù particularly in taking responsibility 
for mistakes. Ask Siri a question she can‚Äôt process 
and she says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure I understand.‚Äù
It‚Äôs critical that we challenge stereotypical gender 
roles in our personal assistants. Our interactions 
with AI teach and train it, but we are also shaped 
by these experiences. It‚Äôs why parents are 
concerned about unintentionally raising rude 
children, when Alexa does not require a ‚Äúplease‚Äù 
or ‚Äúthank you‚Äù to carry out a task.
As our relationship with technology enters a new 
stage of intimacy, it‚Äôs worrying to think of what 
will happen when some people‚Äôs primary sexual 
experiences will be with a sexually acquiescent 
robot. Sexually harassing Siri for a YouTube video 
might be amusing to some, but it‚Äôs unsettling to 
hear how similar that language is to what women 
hear from street harassers. There is the same 
societal expectation that both just accept it.
Humans aim for linguistic style matching in their 
social interactions, meaning they try to match the 
language patterns of the human‚Äîand now, AI‚Äî
with whom they are speaking. But as AI enters 
our physical realm, there are serious personal and 
social consequences for treating it in a degrading 
manner. The companies behind AI are cashing in 
on bias, and that is not the way to a utopia, tech 
or otherwise.
AI assistants 
are very prone 
to using the 
word ‚ÄúI,‚Äù 
particularly 
in taking 
responsibility 
for mistakes.

in black or white. It measures 4.1 by 3.8 by 3.6 inches 
(HWD), weighs 14.8 ounces, and has a reasonably sharp 
2.5-inch, 480-by-480 circular color touch screen on the 
front and a 1.4-inch speaker that radiates out through a 
grille around the bottom. A small camera is located 
right above the screen. On the back of the device is a 
3.5mm audio out jack.
The design is cute, soothing, and harmonious. The 
device looks great on a bedside table, in a kitchen, or in 
a living room. As it‚Äôs much smaller than the blocky Echo 
Show, it doesn‚Äôt impose.
The Spot connects to Wi-Fi on both the 2.4GHz and 
5GHz bands, which is great in places with crowded 
2.4GHz airwaves. It‚Äôs easy to set up, and when it‚Äôs time 
to enter your home Wi-Fi password, a very tiny touch 
keyboard appears. It‚Äôs surprisingly usable. Like other 
Alexa devices, the Spot requires an Amazon account 
and works best for those who are plugged into 
Amazon‚Äôs services.

PROS Super cute

CONS Not a powerful 
speaker. No non-

Keep in mind that the Echo Spot is not a full-room 
audio speaker. It‚Äôs quiet, only 1dB to 2dB louder than an 
Echo Dot at its various volume levels. That said, the 
Spot‚Äôs audio quality is much better‚Äîwhere the Dot is 
painfully tinny, the Spot plays voices and midrange 
instruments without harshness. You‚Äôll wake up 
pleasantly, and if your Spot is in the kitchen, you‚Äôll

use the 3.5mm-out to attach the Spot to a more 
powerful speaker.

of Alexa. It works as part of a whole-home audio 
system, offers multiple wake words, has ‚ÄúESP‚Äù to 
prevent it from answering when another Alexa device is 
nearer, and works with all of Alexa‚Äôs thousands of third-
party skills. It plays music from Amazon, Pandora, 
Spotify, and TuneIn, and it can read audiobooks or 
Kindle books to you. 
You won‚Äôt be 
throwing dance 
parties unless 
you use the 
3.5mm-out to 
attach the Spot 
to a more 
powerful 
speaker.

PERFECTLY ALARMING
Let‚Äôs treat the Spot primarily as an alarm clock. I‚Äôve been recommending that 
people use the Echo Dot and Google Home Mini to set alarms in their bedrooms 
for a while, but the experience isn‚Äôt ideal if you don‚Äôt sleep alone. When it‚Äôs the 
middle of the night, you want to glance at your clock rather than have to ask it 
the time and risk waking up your partner.
An ambient light sensor in the Spot dims the screen in dark rooms. If any light 
at all bothers you, you can say, ‚ÄúAlexa, turn off the screen.‚Äù It won‚Äôt come back 
on until you turn the room lights on.
The clock offers six analog and six digital face options, as well as the ability to 
use your own photo as a clockface. It offers more than a dozen alarm chimes, as 
well as some odd celebrity voices (Alec Baldwin, for instance) telling you to 
wake up. You can also set an alarm to wake up to any song from a connected 
streaming service or in your Amazon Music locker.
You can set multiple alarms with different sounds or songs, and when the alarm 
goes off, tapping the screen or saying, ‚ÄúAlexa, snooze‚Äù delays it for nine minutes. 
Swiping up on the screen dismisses the alarm entirely. When you swipe right 
from the clock face, you see the weather‚Äîgreat for knowing what to wear in the 
morning‚Äîand then the less-useful What to Do With Alexa and Trending Topics 
screens, which you can turn off.
You can customize 
the cards that the 
Spot‚Äôs face shows, 
so that if you don‚Äôt 
like this Trending 
Topics card, for 
instance (I don‚Äôt), 
you can turn it off.

Alexa‚Äôs one downside when dealing with groggy people: 
It‚Äôs a stickler for exact wording. For instance, if you 
tend to have brilliant ideas in the middle of the night, 
‚ÄúAlexa, add XYZ to my to-do list,‚Äù works, while, ‚ÄúAlexa, 
note to self,‚Äù does not. The Google Home is much better 
at interpreting differently phrased commands. You have 
to ask the Spot to, ‚ÄúWake me up at 8:11 a.m. to 
‚ÄòCalifornia‚Äô by Grimes,‚Äù not, ‚ÄúSet an alarm for 8:11 a.m. 
to ‚ÄòCalifornia‚Äô by Grimes.‚Äù
SCREENING ROOM
The clock is the killer app for the screen, at least for 
now. But there are a few other useful things you can do 
with the display.
In a smart home, the screen can show what‚Äôs on your 
video doorbell, security camera, or connected baby 
monitor, as long as that device is also Alexa-capable. 
You can use the screen and camera to video-chat with 
other screen-sporting Alexa devices or with the Alexa 
app on smartphones. I tried it with an Android phone, 
and it worked well.
You can also play Amazon Video, some news videos, or 
movie trailers, but not music videos or YouTube. The 
URXQGVFUHHQKDVDZHLUGDVSHFWUDWLRIRUYLGHRVWKH\
are either going to be cropped severely or have big black 
borders.
When playing music, you‚Äôll see album art and, if you‚Äôre 
lucky, lyrics. In the kitchen, the screen helps you step 
through recipes, but because the font size is quite big, 
you can‚Äôt read enough of a recipe without having to 
swipe on the screen. Still, it‚Äôs better than having an 
audio-only recipe, especially if you have trouble with 
auditory memory.
The clock is 
the killer app 
for the screen, 
for now. But 
there are a few 
other useful 
things you can 
do with the 
display.

A lot of people won‚Äôt want a camera in their bedrooms. I put a small piece of 
EODFNWDSHRQWKHFDPHUDDQGLWGLGQ¬∂WVHHPWRDIIHFWWKHDPELHQWOLJKWVHQVRU
the Spot still got brighter and darker depending on the light in the room. The 
mic mute button on the top of the Spot (sandwiched between the volume 
buttons) also kills the camera, but then you lose voice control as well. You can 
say, ‚ÄúAlexa, turn off the camera,‚Äù and Alexa says, ‚ÄúDone,‚Äù but then you could get 
into spiraling paranoia around whether the camera is really off.

best sound quality, you need to travel outside of Amazon and get a Sonos One. 
And since the Spot is so cute, friendly, and easy to use, the Echo Show doesn‚Äôt 
really have much of a place anymore unless you want a larger screen that‚Äôs 
similarly limited in video playback.
The Echo Spot keeps Amazon ahead of the Google Home ecosystem, which

although it does have the big Home Max speaker, which Amazon can‚Äôt match.
It‚Äôs easy to recommend the Echo Spot, even though it‚Äôs a little expensive for a 
bedside or tableside clock. Most traditional alarm clocks cost between $15 and 
$50. The Echo Spot is twice as good and twice as classy, but three times? I‚Äôd 
love to see it on sale for $99. Its main competitor, the iHome iAVS16 Alexa-
powered alarm clock, is even more expensive, at $149.99. That device also 
doesn‚Äôt have a full screen, although its lack of a camera will make some people 
feel more secure. You can also set up an Echo Dot with a $69.99 iHome Docking 
Bedside Speaker, which has a cradle with a clock in it, but that‚Äôs a kludge.

At the bottom of the back panel is a connection for the

reads out horizontally, and it also adjusts the audio into 
mono‚Äîwhen you‚Äôre using two speakers as a stereo pair, 
they‚Äôre meant to be used vertically. And when you‚Äôre 
using only a single Home Max speaker, you should use

of supported smart home brands, and weirdly, it‚Äôs still 
better at handling calendar information for people with 
G Suite accounts.

particularly good at. We were quite impressed, for instance, when we played 
Led Zeppelin‚Äôs ‚ÄúKashmir‚Äù at full volume and then said, ‚ÄúHey, Google,‚Äù in a 
normal speaking voice‚Äîthe Max picked it up every time. When we stood 
between a Google Home speaker and a Home Max speaker, the mics on each 
were able to detect which one we were closer to, even if just by a foot or two, 
and whatever commands we uttered would be followed by the closest speaker.

What‚Äôs missing? We‚Äôd like to see track navigation 
controls onboard‚Äîyou skip tracks either on your phone 
itself or with the power of your voice and Google

the design when you‚Äôve included volume and playback 
controls. And it would have been great to enhance

or another lossless audio service.
AUDIO PERFORMANCE
So the Home Max looks good and works well, but how 
does it sound? On tracks with intense sub-bass content, 
VXFKDV7KH.QLIH¬∂V¬≥6LOHQW6KRXW¬¥LWGHOLYHUVSRZHUIXO
low-frequency response. At top volumes, it doesn‚Äôt 
distort, though you can hear the digital signal 
processing (DSP) kick in a little to thin out the deep 
bass‚Äîthis is common with wireless speakers that utilize 
DSP, and it‚Äôs meant to prevent distortion at high 
OLVWHQLQJOHYHOV7KXVDWPRUHPRGHUDWHOHYHOV\RXJHW
a rounder, fuller sense of bass depth. In fact, for a 
speaker this size‚Äînot tiny but not massive‚Äîyou get a 
GLVSURSRUWLRQDWHO\IXOOEDVVUHVSRQVH7KLVLVDSRZHUIXO
sound that‚Äôll appeal to fans of deep bass, yet the speaker 
doesn‚Äôt forsake the overall balance of the mix, as the 
highs are also well represented.
At top volumes, 
it doesn‚Äôt 
distort, though 
you can hear the 
digital signal

(DSP) kick in a

Bill Callahan‚Äôs ‚ÄúDrover,‚Äù a track with less deep bass in the mix, gives us a better

round‚Äîneither overly boosted nor weak. Callahan‚Äôs baritone vocals get an ideal 
low-mid presence as well, highlighting their richness, while the high-mids are 
dialed in to deliver some crisp treble edge to the vocals, guitar strums, and 
KLJKHUUHJLVWHUSHUFXVVLYHKLWV7KHEDODQFHKHUHLVLPSUHVVLYH0RVWOLVWHQHUV
will enjoy the full, clear sound.
On Jay-Z and Kanye West‚Äôs ‚ÄúNo Church in the Wild,‚Äù the kick drum loop 
receives an ideal high-mid presence that accentuates its sharp attack, while the 
sub-bass synth hits that punctuate the beat are delivered with near-subwoofer-
level power and depth. Again, the louder you pump the volume, the thinner the 
bass gets, but at fairly high listening levels, the bass depth is still impressive.

to the Other Mary,‚Äù sound wonderful through the Google Home Max‚Äîthe 
higher register brass, strings, and vocals are delivered with brightness and the 
lower register instrumentation gets some added, subtle bass depth. When sub-
bass moments occasionally occur in the mix, the speakers deliver them with 
full-bodied presence that doesn‚Äôt compete with the highs for the spotlight.
So let‚Äôs say the built-in Google Assistant functionality is worth about $50 of the 
$400 price tag‚Äîthat would mean the Home Max should sound as good as a 
$350 speaker, right? Compared with some of our favorite standard wireless

GHSWKZKLOHWKH.OLSVFKPRGHOGHOLYHUVWKHPRVWUH¬øQHGDXGLRRIWKHEXQFK
But in terms of clarity, power, and bass depth, the Home Max delivers an 
excellent listening experience that can hang in the same league as these 
speakers, which is especially impressive when you factor in the voice control. 
And it blows away the audio performance offered by the smaller Google Home 
speaker, though that speaker offers some decent bass depth for its size. If 
Google Assistant is a priority and solid audio performance is also high on the 
list, you won‚Äôt be disappointed with the Home Max.

SMART COMPETITION
As far as smart speakers go, the top competitor for the Google Home Max right 
now is JBL‚Äôs Link system, especially the Link 500 ($399.95), which we are in 
WKHSURFHVVRIUHYLHZLQJ7KH/LQNV\VWHPKDVIRXUGLIIHUHQWVSHDNHURSWLRQVDOO

phone calls, which Google‚Äôs own speakers have but third-party models don‚Äôt. 
You can also assume, of course, that Google‚Äôs own speakers will get new

One, which sounds good but isn‚Äôt in the same class, bass-wise (or price-wise). 
Apple‚Äôs $349 Homepod may end up competing, but it‚Äôs been delayed, and Siri is 
far behind Google when it comes to voice assistant capabilities right now.

We still recommend an array of Alexa devices for people primarily interested in

priority, choose Max and the Google ecosystem.

THIN BEZEL, GOOD DISPLAY
The Yoga 720 rides the thin-bezel wave that began to 
wash over the high-end ultraportable market a few 
years ago and shows no sign of breaking any time soon. 
The bezel, or border around the screen, is quite thin on 
the sides of the Yoga 720‚Äôs 12.5-inch full HD display, 
but it‚Äôs thick enough on top to include a webcam in the 
normal position at the center of the screen. Compare

Input/output options are limited on the Yoga 720, but 
that‚Äôs usual for a small laptop. You‚Äôll have to make do 
with one USB 3.0 port and a single USB-C port, both 
located on the right edge next to the power button. 
Luckily, unlike the Apple MacBook, neither of those will

conventional laptops, it also lags slightly behind the Editors‚Äô Choice Dell

For working people, email is still a necessary 
evil. A whole class of productivity apps has 
emerged to mitigate some of email‚Äôs inherent 
problems, and Hiri is one such contender. 
This downloadable app is an alternative 
interface for your Microsoft email account. It adds a

turned into tasks. Hiri‚Äôs price is competitive, and its

Hiri app, which has a totally different interface and 
suite of tools than what‚Äôs in Outlook or whichever app 
you use for email currently. Some email assistant 
services work within your current email app rather than 
replace it, so you never have to learn the ins and outs of 
a new interface, as you do with Hiri. The star among

available for macOS, Windows, and Linux. No matter

a bargain. So I would recommend downloading Hiri, 
giving it a try, and locking in the deal if you like what 
the app does.
Hiri isn‚Äôt the same as Sanebox, Boomerang, Nudgemail, 
or other email assistants‚Äîeach does something slightly 
different. But it‚Äôs helpful nonetheless to compare their 
prices to get a sense of how much is reasonable to pay 
for a service designed to improve email.

WHAT DOES HIRI DO?
Hiri is an alternative app for managing email from 
([FKDQJH2I¬øFHRUD0LFURVRIWHPDLODFFRXQW
VXFKDV2XWORRNFRP/LYH+RWPDLO<RXGRZQORDG
and install it on any computer where you want to 
manage your email. There are no mobile apps at this 
time, which is a real drawback.
Hiri is an 
alternative 
application for 
managing 
email from 
Exchange, 
OfÔ¨Åce 365, or a 
Microsoft 
email account.

Once you set up the app and connect your account, Hiri pulls your email into

one month, three months, six months, a year, two years, or all of it.
Before you get too far with Hiri, explore the Skills center, where you learn about 
different features and choose which ones to enable.

The next option, Dashboard, discourages you from checking your inbox 
obsessively. When you enable the Dashboard and choose to display it, Hiri 
places a summary box over your inbox, which has a timer at the center that

messages received since you last checked, as well as the total number of 
messages received today. I like the feature, although I‚Äôd like it more if I could 
customize the length of time.
Another option is the Task List, which creates a short to-do list that appears to

worlds better than relying on the existing subject line.

Reminders is similar to what other email assistant apps 
call Snooze, although it operates slightly differently. In 
other apps, when you snooze an email, it temporarily 
disappears from the inbox until a time you set. In Hiri, 
the Reminders feature instead marks an email as 
unread for now and reminds you via a pop-up alert at a 
time you set that you should deal with it.
Speaking of alerts, Hiri‚Äôs do not appear in macOS‚Äôs

means fewer

concrete feedback to other Hiri users, such as when someone writes emails that 
are way too long.
Hiri also has an integrated calendar and contact list, which sync with your 
Microsoft account. The search bar for both contacts and emails is speedy and 
accurate. The calendar can hold a lot of appointments without looking cluttered. 
One gripe, however, is that when you create a new appointment, the start and 
HQGWLPHVPXVWHQGLQRU<RXFDQ¬∂WKDYHDPHHWLQJDWRUDQG
you can‚Äôt create an appointment that‚Äôs less than a half hour long. For an app 
that‚Äôs all about productivity, the lack of an ability to schedule short meetings 
seems like a miss.
WHAT DOES HIRI NOT DO?
Hiri‚Äôs features and tools work well and take little time to learn to use. The 
biggest change for many people who adopt Hiri is getting used to having an all-
new interface. If you‚Äôve spent the better part of the last decade becoming an 
Outlook guru, you‚Äôre probably going to be reluctant to switch to Hiri simply 
because it has a few features that Outlook does not.
Some email assistant services don‚Äôt have this problem. SaneBox and Boomerang 
are two examples. Both are services that you add to your existing email 
application. Boomerang is merely an add-on service to Gmail, and SaneBox also 
does its magic without asking you to leave the familiar world of your existing 
email app.

Meanwhile, Hiri doesn‚Äôt have nearly all the features 
found in Outlook, especially the tight integrations with 
other Microsoft products. For example, from within 
Outlook, you can navigate to the calendar and schedule 
a meeting to take place over Microsoft Skype for 
Business, with dial-in conferencing instructions 
included automatically. Hiri is only worthwhile if you‚Äôre 
not heavily invested in those kinds of existing 
integrations and features.
One feature I‚Äôve always wanted to see in any email app 
is the ability to drag to the top of the window my most 
important messages. I just want a little holding cell for 
the VIP messages, some way to literally set apart from 
the pack the handful of messages that I absolutely must 
reply to or process today, or else! Some apps have come 
up with different ways to view starred messages so that 
they and only they are lumped together, but I still 
dream of a holding tank.
CONCLUSION
Hiri brings valuable tools to email that can make it less 
horrible. But it‚Äôs a feasible option only if you use a 
Microsoft-based email account and if you‚Äôre willing to 
dive into a new application with a new interface. Those 
are two big ifs, highlighting why Hiri isn‚Äôt for everyone. 
For those who do meet those two if conditions, the 
seven-day free trial is certainly worth the few minutes it 
takes to set up the app and explore what it can do. If 
you choose to continue using Hiri, the price is easy to 
swallow. If you use a different email system or don‚Äôt

Fluenz ranks among the best language-

REVIEWS

Although Fluenz is a wonderful alternative to other 
apps that don‚Äôt include any instruction in the learner‚Äôs 
native tongue, Rosetta Stone remains PCMag Editors‚Äô 
Choice among paid language-learning programs 
because it offers many more languages. Duolingo is the 
Editors‚Äô Choice among free programs. If you‚Äôve tried 
those apps and didn‚Äôt like them, take a look at Fluenz. 
It‚Äôs refreshingly different, accurate, and well designed.
LANGUAGES OFFERED
Fluenz has programs for seven languages: Chinese 
(Mandarin with Pinyin writing only), French, German, 
Italian, Portuguese, Latin American, and European 
6SDQLVK7KDW¬∂VQRWDKXJHVHOHFWLRQEXWLWGRHVLQFOXGH
some of the most popular languages English speakers 
study. Note that with the Mandarin program, you won‚Äôt 
learn to read or write Chinese, as it uses Pinyin writing 
only, which is a romanization. You‚Äôll have to go 
elsewhere to learn Chinese characters.
If the language you need isn‚Äôt taught by Fluenz, plenty 
of other good programs are available. Duolingo has 22 
fully developed courses, plus a few more in beta. (In 
counting languages,, I exclude English programs as well

more than 100 languages, although the amount of 
material for languages that are not in high demand can 
be rather limited. Pimsleur, an audio-based program, 
has more than 50 language courses.
Another place to look if you‚Äôre in a bind is Mango 
Languages, although I have a hard time recommending 
it, because the app is painfully repetitive and slow.

FLUENZ PRICE AND PACKAGES
How much you end up paying for Fluenz varies based 
on how many levels of a language course you purchase. 
7KHPRVWFRPSUHKHQVLYHSDFNDJH\RXFDQEX\LV/HYHOV
1 through 5, which costs $368. Note that the Mandarin 
course has only three levels, so the most you can spend 
learning Chinese with Fluenz is $298. For any of the 
languages, Level 1 on its own costs $177. If you want 
Levels 3 to 5 only, that package costs $310.
With any of the packages, you can choose to buy

SKUDVHVTXLFNO\0RUHH[SHULHQFHGVSHDNHUVPD\KDYHWURXEOH¬øJXULQJRXW
where to start. I moved ahead in French (I had taken a classroom French course 
some years ago) and found I could understand most of it, but I had a hard time 
spelling, which left me struggling through some of the interactive exercises.

You can jump around Fluenz at will, so if the lesson 
seems beyond you or too simple, you can easily back up 
or move forward. Not all language courses let you do 
that. With Duolingo, for example, you have to progress 
sequentially or test out of levels. 
Fluenz pushes writing a little more than speaking, 
especially in the early units, but overall it blends 
listening, reading, speaking, and writing well. Much of 
the content comes in the form of interactive exercises, 
but there‚Äôs also a sizable portion of learning from 
instructors who appear in videos to explain grammar, 
what words mean, and other aspects of the language. In 
the Chinese course, for example, the videos explain 
tones, as well as how to answer yes/no questions in the 
language, which is quite different from how English 
VSHDNHUVGRLW7KDW¬∂VWKHNLQGRIPDWHULDOWKDW¬∂VGLI¬øFXOW
to get across in a program where there‚Äôs no English 
instruction.
For the speaking portions, Fluenz doesn‚Äôt have an 
advanced speech-recognition system, but it does have 
recording and playback capabilities. Some other 
language-learning software programs use speech 
waveforms to help with pronunciation: You record 
yourself speaking, and the app generates a visualization 
of your speech, which you can compare to that of a 
QDWLYHVSHDNHUVD\LQJWKHVDPHWKLQJ,GRQ¬∂W¬øQG
waveforms especially useful, because I don‚Äôt know how 
to change my speaking form by looking at lines on a 
screen. If you‚Äôre keen on waveforms, Rosetta Stone and 
7UDQVSDUHQW/DQJXDJHERWKKDYHWKHP7UDQVSDUHQW
has a neat feature that highlights the part of your 
waveform where you‚Äôre having trouble, which allows 
you to at least listen closely during the playback to the 
highlighted parts that you need to improve.
You can jump 
around Fluenz 
at will, so if the 
lesson seems 
beyond you or 
too simple, you 
can easily back

gives you time to absorb concepts. Even so, at times the 
videos feel tedious‚Äîthey‚Äôre a little too staged. But the 
material is excellent, and there‚Äôs real value in seeing the 
face of a person who is explaining a concept. 
For pronunciation, I like being able to see someone‚Äôs 
lips and throat move. I also like being told what a word 
really means, rather than guessing its meaning from 
context alone, which is sometimes a problem in Rosetta 
Stone. For example, you might understand in Rosetta 
Stone that some word is the opposite of ‚Äúchild,‚Äù but 
whether it means ‚Äúadult‚Äù or ‚Äúperson‚Äù or something else 
is impossible to know.
Fluenz isn‚Äôt the only program to provide an instructor. 
Rocket Languages and Pimsleur have something 
similar, although in those courses, the instructor-driven 
lessons are audio only (except in Rocket Languages‚Äô 
American Sign Language course).
At Ô¨Årst, the 
videos feel too 
slow, but when 
you get into 
difÔ¨Åcult 
content, the 
pacing gives you 
time to absorb 
concepts. 

Structurally, Fluenz is very clear. Progress markers show exactly where you are 
and what you‚Äôve completed. You‚Äôre meant to move through content sequentially, 
though you don‚Äôt have to.
WORKOUTS
Fluenz starts most of its exercises, or workouts, with a dialogue that the learner 
is told to play three times: once with subtitles in both the new language and 
English, once with the subtitles in only the new language, and once with no 
VXEWLWOHVDWDOO7KHQWKHZRUGVDQGSKUDVHV\RXKHDUGIURPWKHRSHQLQJ
dialogue are used in the writing, speaking, and listening exercises that follow.
While Fluenz calls its exercises workouts, they are no different from the 
exercises found in most other polished language-learning software packages. 
You might, for example, hear a word or phrase and have to type it or translate it.

doing some of these exercises, you watch a video with your guide, who breaks 
down what you‚Äôve learned and explains it further.
Fluenz has mastered the art of repetition. When the program introduces a new 
word or concept, you‚Äôll see, hear, and write it many times over in both the 
current lesson and future lessons. For beginners, the drill-and-kill method is 
highly effective, as long as you study consistently.

example, you learn the word for ‚Äúwant‚Äù and how to conjugate it very early. 
Fluenz recreates 
aspects of classroom 
learning in its foreign 
language instruction. 
It‚Äôs an excellent app, 
but it‚Äôs expensive 
and only offers a few 
languages.

7KHNLQGVRIZRUGV\RXOHDUQLQWKHHDUO\VWDJHVRI
Fluenz are completely different than what‚Äôs in Rosetta 
Stone. Rosetta Stone teaches through deductive 
reasoning: For example, you might learn to say, ‚Äúthe 
boy eats rice,‚Äù ‚Äúyou eat rice,‚Äù and ‚Äúthe cat eats rice.‚Äù

which word means ‚Äúdog,‚Äù but you might also wonder 
when you‚Äôll ever actually need to say, ‚Äúthe dog eats 
rice.‚Äù In both Rosetta Stone and Fluenz, you learn 
similar concepts, but Fluenz does it with words and 
phrases you‚Äôre likely to use.
In typing exercises, Fluenz is precise in that it requires 
you to spell everything exactly correctly, accent marks 
and all. It is not forgiving of typos or small mistakes. In 
some exercises, you can‚Äôt even get away with leaving the

BY TERRY SULLIVAN 

I‚Äôm standing in a dark room. I hear rain falling outside. A man says, ‚ÄúIt was 
raining. And I stood for a few minutes lost in the beauty of it. If only there could 
be something equivalent to rain falling inside. Then the whole of a room would 
take on shape and dimension.‚Äù Suddenly, the sound of the rain is coming from 
within the room.
 
As I gaze around, I see dim shapes of ordinary household items‚Äîa pot, a pan, a 
bowl. They mysteriously change color and then transform into a slow burst of 
iridescent light. I can almost feel the raindrops. The man says, ‚ÄúWhy should this 
experience strike one as being beautiful? Cognition is beautiful. It‚Äôs beautiful to 
know.‚Äù The rain becomes a downpour, and the sound blends with beautiful, 
melancholy music.
 
This may sound like I‚Äôm dreaming (or hallucinating). But it‚Äôs an attempt to 
describe what I saw and heard in ‚ÄúNotes on Blindness,‚Äù a powerful virtual 
reality (VR) ‚Äúexperience‚Äù (the term for these 360-degree interactive movies). It 
accompanies a documentary on the writer and philosopher John Hull as he 
began to lose his sight.
A NEW KIND OF VR
‚ÄúNotes on Blindness‚Äù is just one example of how VR is taking off in a new 
GLUHFWLRQ,W¬∂VDWXUQIURPWKHPRUHFRPPRQO\NQRZQ¬øFWLRQDO95ZRUOGVLQ
gaming, which uses 360-degree video and computer-generated graphics (CGI) 
to immerse you in, say, an ethereal landscape on a make-believe distant planet 
RUDKLJKO\GHWDLOHGUHFRQVWUXFWHGVHWRI\RXUIDYRULWHVFLHQFH¬øFWLRQPRYLH

That‚Äôs not to say the technology used in ‚ÄúNotes on Blindness‚Äù is different from 
what‚Äôs used to create entertainment VR: In fact, it‚Äôs very much the same 
(360-degree video, CGI, and so on). The aim is not to escape the real world, 
though, but to feel more engaged with it. ‚ÄúNotes on Blindness‚Äù gives you a sense 
of what it feels like to be John Hull, as his eyesight diminishes and then 
vanishes altogether.
These types of VR experiences are beginning to appear more frequently. What if 
you could dive under the ice in Antarctica and swim next to a seal? Or see the 
devastation and hear the falling bombs in a city that‚Äôs been ravaged by war, 
VXFKDV$OHSSR6\ULD"2UPRYHDORQJVLGHUHIXJHHV√ÄHHLQJWKHLUKRPHVWRDYRLG
persecution? These are some examples of how journalists, creators of 
GRFXPHQWDU\PRYLHVDQGRWKHUQRQ¬øFWLRQVWRU\WHOOHUVDUHEHJLQQLQJWR
experiment with VR. 
Some of the the most ambitious endeavors in VR and 
360-degree video have come from The New York 
Times. In 2015, the paper sent Google Cardboard 
headsets to more than a million subscribers to use 
with their smartphones. ‚ÄúThat was really one of the 
watershed moments in VR in terms of exposing a 
broad group of people who probably have not seen 
anything in that medium,‚Äù said Adam Sheppard 
(pictured at right), CEO and co-founder of 8ninths, a 
Seattle-based virtual- and mixed-reality studio. In late 
2016, The New York Times introduced a feature 
called The Daily 360, which posts a new 360-degree 
video and VR experience every day. 
IMMERSIVE STORYTELLING
Not surprisingly, The New York Times believes immersive virtual journalistic 
experiences can make a huge impact. According to Marcelle Hopkins, co-
director of virtual reality and deputy director of video at the Times, ‚ÄúWe see 
virtual reality, as well as 360 video, AR, MR, and whatever comes next, as part 
of the same spectrum, which is immersive platforms. We see that as part of the 
future of how people consume media, including journalism.‚Äù 

For Hopkins, as well as many others in this emerging 
¬øHOGLW¬∂VWKHLPPHUVLYHTXDOLW\WKDWKROGVWKHELJJHVW
draw. But for journalism, documentaries, news, and 
RWKHUQRQ¬øFWLRQJHQUHV95LVUHODWLYHO\QHZWHUULWRU\
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a very young medium,‚Äù said Hopkins, ‚Äúand we‚Äôre 
just learning how to use it. As we‚Äôre telling stories in this 
way, we‚Äôre learning a lot each time we do it.‚Äù
‚ÄúCutting yourself off from the rest of the world in a 
headset is a very immersive experience,‚Äù explained 
Jessica Lauretti, vice president of RYOT Studio Oath‚Äôs 
creative studio, which creates VR content. She noted 
that VR can be powerful for storytellers, since it forces 
the viewer to be engaged. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt see anything else. 
So it does have this ability to transport you to another 
place, another country, another time.‚Äù
In 2016, The Guardian used this isolating quality of VR 
to great effect in ‚Äú6 x 9,‚Äù which aimed to replicate the 
H[SHULHQFHOLYLQJLQVROLWDU\FRQ¬øQHPHQWLQSULVRQ
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre always looking at new ways to express our 
journalism at The GuardianDQG¬øQGZD\VWRLQQRYDWH¬¥
said Francesca Panetta, executive editor, virtual reality, 
Guardian News & Media. ‚ÄúVirtual reality was a form we 
had been thinking about and wanted to experiment with 
and simultaneously, editorially at The Guardian, we

the two things came together: VR is a medium that is all

small and very undesirable space. It also is a piece about 
psychology: the impact on the mind when you are in 
isolation. We also wanted to portray the possible effects 
of this, such as blurred vision, audio, and visual 
hallucinations. With all this considered, it felt obvious 
WKDW¬µ[¬∂ZRXOGEHDJRRGVWRU\IRUWKHIRUP¬¥

Panetta also wanted to engage viewers in other ways, 
including interactive elements‚Äîalthough technically, 
VKHVDLGWKDWZDVGLI¬øFXOWWRLPSOHPHQW¬≥2QHVFHQHKDV
hot spots which you trigger by looking at them,‚Äù said 
Panetta. ‚ÄúThis sounds easy, but it wasn‚Äôt.‚Äù

piece about being in a space and having very little to do, 
with minimal interaction for days, months, years, even 
decades. We needed to consider how we could make a 
piece that wasn‚Äôt deadly boring and [in] which people 
didn‚Äôt take the headsets off halfway through.‚Äù 
Actually, ‚Äú6 x 9‚Äù is the opposite of dull‚Äîit‚Äôs riveting and 
produces a strong visceral reaction. I had the 
opportunity to try this experience using an Oculus Rift 
VR headset. During the roughly ten-minute piece, I was 
moved by hearing the voices of other prisoners outside 
my ‚Äúcell‚Äù while I looked at the plain space around me, 
which contained a bed, a bench, a tiny stool, a 
combination toilet and sink, and a few books and 
magazines. In such a sparse setting, the objects took on 
the gravitas of a Chardin still-life. 
A scene from ‚Äú6x9‚Äù
VR is a medium 
that is all about 
space, and 
solitary 
conÔ¨Ånement is 
too, albeit a 
small and very 
undesirable 
space.

During the experience, a variety of statistics, quotes, 
and phrases from former inmates, guards, and even 
psychologists, are superimposed on the walls. At one

hovered near the ceiling of the cell, my ‚Äúvision‚Äù 
(actually, the video itself) started to blur. This part of 
the experience is meant to give the viewer the feeling of 
disorientation and hallucinations that result from being

‚ÄúMany people have told us that it demonstrates in nine

Panetta.

person, point-of-view quality enables viewers to feel as 
though they‚Äôre inside the story in a physical way, which 
is often referred to as the ‚Äúsense of presence.‚Äù That‚Äôs the 
quality that makes you feel like you‚Äôre truly there on top 
of Mount Everest or swimming under the ocean. And 
because a viewer can employ gestures or body language, 
such as a turn of the head to view different scenes or 
trigger actions, there‚Äôs a profound shift in how the story 
is told. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre in control of what you see,‚Äù said Lauretti, 
‚Äúand what information you have access to.‚Äù 
Niko Chauls, former director of emerging technology at 
USA Today Networks, who has led many of the 
company‚Äôs VR and AR teams, concurs with Lauretti on 
the importance of choice and interactivity in VR,

‚ÄúGiving control to consumers can be pretty scary to 
traditional storytellers,‚Äù said Chauls, ‚Äúbut it can be 
powerful if it‚Äôs embraced.‚Äù
Chauls and his team tackled restructuring how a story is

‚ÄúIt essentially documents life aboard a nuclear aircraft carrier. But it‚Äôs really

SOUND MATTERS
VR teams are experimenting with other elements, in addition to nonlinear 
narrative structures and immersive 360-degree video. One is audio.

not more‚Äîimportant, because it is one of the ways people understand the 
space,‚Äù noted The New York Time‚Äôs Hopkins. ‚ÄúWe can use spatial audio so that 
we can place sounds in space, so that when they hear something, they can hear 
LWFRPLQJIURPDVSHFL¬øFGLUHFWLRQ¬¥
Zahra Rasool (pictured below), editorial lead for Contrast VR, an immersive-
media studio that creates VR experiences for Al Jazeera, said, ‚ÄúAudio gives you 
the sense of scale and location in VR. We use spatial audio in all of our 
productions and can convey a sense of environment and a sense of space. As a 
storyteller, it‚Äôs powerful when you feel you need someone to be there in order to 
understand the gravity of the story and the situation.‚Äù
‚ÄúSensations of Sound,‚Äù from The New York Times, is a powerful example of 
using spatial audio to help tell a story. This VR creation is centered on Rachel 
Kolb and her experience of music. Kolb had been profoundly deaf her whole 
life‚Äîuntil a few years ago, when she was 20 and underwent surgery for cochlear 
implants, which gave her partial hearing.

Although Kolb, who also narrates the story, hadn‚Äôt been able to hear music for 
most of her life, she had still been able to experience it. As a child, she played 
piano and guitar. ‚ÄúShe saw and felt music,‚Äù said Hopkins, ‚Äúeven in ways that we 
DVKHDULQJSHRSOHGRQ¬∂W¬¥%XWZKHQ.ROE¬øUVWKHDUGOLYHPXVLF¬≥,WZDVDMDUULQJ
experience for her,‚Äù said Hopkins, since her previous concept of music was far 
less dynamic. 
‚ÄúSound in this piece is obviously important,‚Äù said Hopkins. ‚ÄúWe were able to 
use spatial audio as well as an interesting sound design to express some of the 
things that she is talking about in conveying her story.‚Äù
At the end of ‚ÄúSensations of Sound,‚Äù Kolb asks, ‚ÄúCan you hear the music? Even 
though I now can, I think this question misses the point. Music is also visual, 
physical, tactile. It weaves its rhythms though our lives. I believe music becomes 
more remarkable when we experience it with our whole bodies.‚Äù 
Other elements of multimedia that are being explored in VR projects are motion

Jazeera, ‚ÄúI Am Rohingya,‚Äù chronicles the life of Jamalida, a young woman from 
Myanmar who now lives in a refugee camp in Bangladesh. In one section, 
Jamalida describes her persecution in Myanmar. Since there was no footage of 
Jamilda in particular, Rasool said, ‚ÄúThe best way to represent those memories 
and recollections was through digital animations.‚Äù By focusing on just one point 
of view, Rasool and her team generated a powerful sense of empathy.

THE FUTURE OF VR JOURNALISM 
1RQ¬øFWLRQ95KDVQ¬∂WIXOO\DUULYHGMXVW\HW/DXUHWWL
Chauls, and others note that one challenge is in demand 
and distribution. Many publishing and news 
organizations are still struggling with mainstream 
digital platforms and how to monetize those more 
accessible forms of media. And because VR projects 
generally require lots of people and time to produce, 
they‚Äôre just too expensive for most outlets.
‚ÄúRight now, the biggest challenge is about reach and 
scale,‚Äù said Lauretti. ‚ÄúComparing it to the expense of 
VR, written journalism is really quick and really cheap. 
And you can get massive scale with written journalism... 
On the distribution side, you also have a problem. 
Headsets aren‚Äôt mainstream yet. The average consumer 
doesn‚Äôt have the Microsoft HoloLens right now, or even 
the Samsung Gear [VR]. We haven‚Äôt seen the 
mainstream adoption yet.‚Äù
But like most digital technology, VR will doubtless 
become cheaper and more widely adopted. Sheppard 
predicted, ‚ÄúWhat you‚Äôre going to see, in the short-term, 
is 360-degree video becoming just another format that 
consumers will come to expect for media consumption.‚Äù 
Platforms including Facebook and YouTube already 
support 360-degree video.
Longer-term, Sheppard sees some really interesting 
opportunities around video and cloud-based 
technology: ‚ÄúIf you can imagine a future where most 
people are wearing a small camera, and it‚Äôs constantly 
gathering information (storing it both locally and to the 
cloud), I think citizen journalism will become one of the 
primary ways we will be involved in the news.‚Äù If we‚Äôre 
all carrying connected cameras, we have the 
opportunity to be VR journalists ourselves.
Because VR 
projects 
generally 
require lots of 
people and time 
to produce, 
they‚Äôre just too 
expensive for 
most outlets.

But Sheppard also noted that the public, media, and government will need to be 
YLJLODQWLQSD\LQJDWWHQWLRQWRWKHQHJDWLYHUDPL¬øFDWLRQVRI95)RUH[DPSOHKH
suggested that the confusion between fake news and real news may increase. 
‚ÄúWe can already create highly realistic faces that appear to be saying any line 
you want them to say. And you wouldn‚Äôt have any idea whether that was real or 
QRW¬¥VDLG6KHSSDUG¬≥,WPD\EHFRPHGLI¬øFXOWWRXQZLQGZKDW¬∂VUHDOIURPWKH
unreal. How do we think about authenticity and authoritative sources when 
almost everything can be fabricated?‚Äù 
Despite its challenging aspects (and sensitivity concerns‚Äîthink back to the 
controversy surrounding Mark Zuckerberg‚Äôs VR ‚Äútour‚Äù of storm-ravaged Puerto 
Rico), some see VR journalism as a possible way to solve current problems in 
the media and journalism. 
‚ÄúVR journalism really has the potential to rebuild trust between an audience 
and a reporter, because of the nature of 360-degree video capture,‚Äù said Chauls. 
‚ÄúYou are removing layers of interpretation or layers of gatekeeping between the 
audience and the event.‚Äù  That is to say, with 360-degree video, there‚Äôs generally 
very little editing other than the length of the video. So viewers might be less 
skeptical that the photographer or journalist is leaving out important 
information or footage. 
Lauretti suggested something similar: ‚ÄúI would argue that every time 
[traditional] photographers put a camera up to their eye, they are cropping out 
or including just certain parts in a particular photo or video.‚Äù So there‚Äôs already 
an edit taking place at the beginning of shooting a traditional video or photo. 
‚ÄúIn a way, 360-degree video actually democratizes that process. Because we‚Äôre 
actually not leaving anything out. We‚Äôre actually showing you everything.‚Äù 
This could be one of the most important ways VR can empower the public. ‚ÄúIn a 
way,‚Äù says Lauretti, ‚Äúit almost leaves nothing to the imagination, but gives you, 
as the viewer, the opportunity to really see and take away whatever you want.‚Äù

VOICE-TRAIN ECHO
TIPS & HOW TOS
D
oes your Amazon Echo often misunderstand your questions and 
commands? That‚Äôs not unusual. The Alexa voice assistant isn‚Äôt perfect 
and can sometimes misinterpret words. But you can help it better 
comprehend what you‚Äôre saying with a round of voice training. By speaking 
aloud a collection of phrases, you teach Alexa the sound of your voice so it gets a 
better grasp of your way of speaking.

instead, position yourself next to the Echo device that 
you want to use.
Open settings: Open the Alexa app on your mobile 
device. Tap on the hamburger menu icon and then tap 
on Settings.
Scroll to Voice Training: Scroll to the bottom of the 
Settings screen and tap on the setting for Voice 
Training.
Pick your Echo: If you have more than one Alexa 
device in your household, tap on the current device at

Prepare to speak: The next screen explains that to go

Pause if you must: The next screen displays the

If further voice training is required, start a new session 
with another round of 25 sentences. Each round of 
voice training serves up a unique set of sentences, so it 
may be helpful to go through at least a couple of 
sessions to train Alexa on different phrases.
Add more voices: What if more than one family 
member talks to Alexa? Naturally, each person has his 
or her own individual style of speaking. First, add each 
person as a member of your Amazon Household, if you 
haven‚Äôt already done so. To do this, tap on Settings. 
Scroll to the Accounts section and tap on Household

Amazon Household.
To switch your Echo device to another account, say: 
‚ÄúAlexa, switch to [person‚Äôs name] account.‚Äù That person 
can then kick off the voice training and go through the 
round of 25 sentences. Each member of the household 
can complete the voice training, one by one. If you lose 
track of which account is the active one, just say: ‚ÄúAlexa, 
which account is this?‚Äù Alexa tells you the name of the 
current account. She‚Äôs nice like that.

PASSWORDS
TIPS & HOW TOS
W
e constantly review the latest password managers as they grow and 
evolve. Some update frequently, adding such features as password 
inheritance and automated password change. Others can go years 
without an update. If your password manager is mired in the past, you don‚Äôt 
have to be a stick-in-the-mud. Changing to a new password manager isn‚Äôt a 
walk in the park, but neither is it impossible. Here are two ways to make the 
switch from your old, tired password manager to a slick, powerful new one.
How to Switch to a New 
Password Manager  BY NEIL J. RUBENKING  

METHOD 1: SLOW BUT STEADY
Password managers are a companionable lot, not like 
antivirus tools. In most cases, two running at the same 
WLPHGRQ¬∂W¬øJKWHDFKRWKHUWKHZD\DQWLYLUXVVRIWZDUH
tends to do. Just install the new one without removing 
the old one. Each time you visit a secure site, the old 
SDVVZRUGPDQDJHU¬øOOVLQ\RXUFUHGHQWLDOVDQGWKHQHZ
one slurps them up into its own collection. Simple!
,IERWKWRROVSRSXSDQGRIIHUWR¬øOOLQ\RXUVDYHG
credentials, it probably means that you already 
migrated the site‚Äôs data to the new password manager. 
But look closely: You might have more than one login 
for that site, perhaps home and work emails. In that 
case, I recommend logging in to transfer each login for 
the site, so there‚Äôs no confusion.
Of course, you want to get all your passwords 
transferred, not just the ones you‚Äôve used recently. One 
way to track progress is to delete each transferred 
password from the old utility. Another is to add a tag to 
those you‚Äôve transferred (which you do only if the old 
password manager supports that functionality) or move 
them to a Finished folder.
In most cases, 
two running 
at the same 
time don‚Äôt 
Ô¨Åght each 
other, the way 
antivirus 
software 
tends to do.

Eventually, though, you‚Äôll have to power through the remaining passwords, the 
sites that you haven‚Äôt yet visited during this migration. Most password 
managers have some kind of master list of passwords. Step through the list, 
launch each one, capture it in the new password manager, and tag or delete the 
ROGRQH5HSHDWXQWLO¬øQLVKHG7KHEHDXW\RIGRLQJLWWKLVZD\LVWKDWLWZHHGV
out sites that no longer exist and sites where your password isn‚Äôt valid. Don‚Äôt 
care about the site? Just delete it without transferring.
A few years ago, I used this technique to migrate from LastPass Premium to 
Dashlane. It took a while, but it was worth the trouble.
METHOD 2: COULD BE FAST, COULD BE TROUBLE
If your old password manager doesn‚Äôt have an export function, or the new one 
can‚Äôt import, the technique just discussed is your only option. But if the features 
align, you may be able to switch over in a jiffy. Just don‚Äôt expect perfection.
Smart developers make sure their products can import from as many 
competitors as possible. LogMeOnce Password Management Suite Ultimate, for 
H[DPSOHFDQLPSRUWIURPDOPRVWFRPSHWLWRUV7KHOLVWRILPSRUWRSWLRQVIRU
LastPass contains more than 30 products, but a closer look reveals that only a 
third of those are widely relevant. Some of the rest are defunct, and others come 
from individuals rather than companies. Of the products I‚Äôve reviewed, more 
can import from Dashlane, LastPass, and RoboForm Everywhere than from any 
other programs.

won‚Äôt be on the import list for your new one. Hardly any 
products import from Keeper Password Manager & 
Digital Vault, for example. But fear not. You can 
probably make the transfer using a simple CSV (Comma

the order of the data columns. Suppose one product

you‚Äôre golden. Export the old data, and import it all.
If the import didn‚Äôt work, the way it didn‚Äôt work should

order the new product wants. A few smart password 
managers offer the option to create a template, a CSV 
¬øOHWKDWVKRZVZKDWWKH\H[SHFW
There‚Äôs a good 
chance that 
your old 
password 
manager 
won‚Äôt be on 
the import list 
for your 
new one. 

Even so, the export/import process can have its bumps. I recently switched yet 
again, this time from Dashlane to Keeper. Alas, I found that I lost all my 
password categories, and some entries didn‚Äôt import correctly. Dashlane proved 
to be the culprit. It simply doesn‚Äôt export the category information. And it 
LQFOXGHGIRXUFRPPDVHSDUDWHG¬øHOGVRQPRVWOLQHVEXW¬øYHRQVRPH
Dashlane can also export to a password-protected proprietary format, to 
transfer between instances of Dashlane. With a little help from yours truly, 
.HHSHU¬∂VGHYHORSHUVZRUNHGRXWDZD\WRLPSRUWIURPWKLVSURSULHWDU\¬øOH$VRI
this writing, that feature is still in beta, but it worked for me!
MAKE THE MOVE
Getting all your passwords into a password manager can take quite a while. 
Updating the weak and duplicate passwords is another lengthy task. By the time 
you‚Äôve done both, you may feel that you‚Äôre locked in to whatever password 
manager you chose. Who wants to go through all that again?
But as I‚Äôve shown, you can always escape. In the best-case scenario, you simply 
export from the old product and import into the new. Done! Sometimes you 
need to massage the data to make that process work. You can also run both 
SURGXFWVLQSDUDOOHOOHWWLQJWKHQHZSDVVZRUGPDQDJHUFDSWXUHWKHGDWD¬øOOHG
by the old one (and, in the process, cleaning out any useless entries). 
As for which password manager should be your new best friend, we lean toward 
products that combine powerful security, a rich feature set, and a smooth user 
experience. Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault has the latest and 
greatest features and works consistently across all popular platforms and

managers. LogMeOnce Password Management Suite Ultimate and Sticky 
Password Premium also share that honor, though when I next review them I‚Äôll 
be thinking hard about the balance between complexity and advanced features.
