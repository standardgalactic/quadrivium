About the Author
Stephen L. Nelson is a CPA in Redmond, Washington. He provides account-
ing, business advisory, and tax planning and preparation services to small
businesses such as manufacturers, retailers, professional service firms, and
startup technology companies. He also teaches CPAs how to help their clients
use QuickBooks more effectively and is an Adjunct Professor of Tax at Golden
Gate University where he teaches S corporation and LLC tax law.
Curiously enough, Nelson is also the most prolific computer book writer of 
all time, according to a recent feature in The Wall Street Journal. He’s also the
bestselling author of books about how to use computers to manage one’s per-
sonal and business finances. In fact, Nelson’s 100-plus books have sold more
than 4,000,000 copies in English and have been translated into more than a
dozen other languages.
Steve holds a BS in accounting, an MBA in finance, and a Master of Science in
Taxation. He’s been a CPA for more than 20 years. He used to work as a senior
consultant with Arthur Andersen & Co. (Yes, that Arthur Andersen — but, hey,
it was a long time ago.) He also has been the controller and treasurer of a 50-
person manufacturing firm and has run his own manufacturing firm. Steve is
also the bestselling author of Quicken 2007 For Dummies and QuickBooks
2007 For Dummies (from Wiley).


Dedication
To the entrepreneurs and small-business people of the world. You folks
create most of the new jobs.
Author’s Acknowledgments
Okay, I’m not going to make this an Academy Awards–style speech, but let me
thank just a few people. First, I want to thank my business school and tax pro-
fessors at Central Washington University, the University of Washington, and
Golden Gate University. Next, thanks to the business clients who’ve given me
the honor of working with them and teaching me about their businesses and
industries. Finally, I want to thank all my friends and colleagues at Wiley
Publishing, Inc., who gave me the distinct honor of writing not only this book
but also Quicken For Dummies (14 editions) and QuickBooks For Dummies
(9 editions). I also want to say a specific thanks to Bob Woerner, my acquisi-
tions editor; Kim Darosett, my project editor; Mary Lagu, my copy editor; and
David Ringstrom, who performed the technical edit.

Introduction
F
ew people read introductions to reference books, so I’ll make this very
brief. I just want to tell you which versions of QuickBooks this book
works for, what’s in the reference, what it assumes about your existing skills,
and about the conventions used in the reference.
About This Book
QuickBooks comes in several different flavors, including QuickBooks Simple
Start, QuickBooks Pro, QuickBooks Premier, and QuickBooks Enterprise
Solutions. This reference talks about QuickBooks 2007 Premier, which is a
superset of QuickBooks Pro and sort of a subset of QuickBooks Enterprise
Solutions.
If you’re using QuickBooks Simple Start — which is the simplest, most bare
bones version of QuickBooks — you should not use this book. Sorry.
Fortunately, I have a solution of sorts for you. You might want to get another
book I’ve written, QuickBooks Simple Start For Dummies (Wiley Publishing,
Inc.). That book covers the Simple Start version of QuickBooks in friendly
detail.
On the other hand, even though this book is written for QuickBooks Premier,
if you’re using QuickBooks Pro or QuickBooks Enterprise Solutions, don’t
worry. You’re just fine with this book. And don’t freak out if you’re using
some version of QuickBooks that’s very similar to QuickBooks 2007, such as
QuickBooks 2006 or QuickBooks 2008. Although this reference is about
QuickBooks Pro 2007, it also works just fine for the 2005, 2006, and probably
2008 versions of QuickBooks because QuickBooks is a very mature product
at this point. The changes from one year to the next are modest. This means
that if you’re using QuickBooks 2005, stuff may look a little different if you
closely compare the images in this book to what you see on your screen, but
the information in this reference will still apply to your situation.
Note, too, that specialty versions of QuickBooks like QuickBooks
Accountants Edition and QuickBooks Contractors versions also work almost
identically to QuickBooks Premier.
If you use QuickBooks Pro and see some whistle or bell that you really want
to use but that isn’t available in your version of QuickBooks, you’ll know
that you should upgrade to the Premier version of QuickBooks.

How to Use This Book
2
The bottom line? Yes, QuickBooks comes in several flavors. Yes, Intuit pub-
lishes new editions of its QuickBooks products every year. But you can use
this book for any recent version of QuickBooks Pro, Premier, or Enterprise
Solutions.
How to Use This Book
This reference combines eight short books, including a book about account-
ing, one about setting up the QuickBooks system, one for bookkeepers using
QuickBooks, one for accountants and managers using QuickBooks, a book
about small business financial management, a book about business planning,
a book about taking care of a QuickBooks accounting system, and a book of
appendixes of further useful information.
I’m not going to go into more detail here about what’s available in the book.
If you have a specific question about what’s covered or where some topic is
covered, refer to the Table of Contents in the front of this reference.
Remember also that the book provides an index for jumping to the page or
pages with the information you need.
While I’m on the subject of what’s in this book and how to find information,
let me make four tangential points:
✦You would never read this book from cover to cover unless you’re some-
one with an obsessive-compulsive personality (like me) and many hours
to devote to your reading. But that’s okay. This reference isn’t meant to
be read from cover to cover like some Harry Potter page-turner. Instead,
chapters within the eight books are organized into largely self-contained
descriptions of how you do the things that you need to do. You just read
the paragraph, page, or chapter that provides the information you want.
✦I have not discussed in any detail how to use the QuickBooks Premier
features for business planning. The wizard-based approach that
QuickBooks Premier provides for business planning is not, in my humble
opinion, the right way to do this. Instead, I discuss in detail alternative,
superior approaches to business planning and budgeting (using spread-
sheets) in Book VI. (Just so you know: The approach I describe and rec-
ommend here is the same one that any business school teaches its
students.)
✦At a few points in the book, you’ll find me saying things like, “Well, I
really don’t think you should use this part of the product.” I just want to
explain here, up front, where I’m coming from on this. First, know that I
think QuickBooks is an outstanding product. But not every feature and
every command is good. I’ve already mentioned that the new business
planning tools aren’t ones that I can recommend. And payroll, very

Foolish Assumptions
3
frankly, is another pain-in-the-butt feature that most businesses should
avoid. (I do briefly discuss payroll in Book III, Chapter 5.) So, if I think
that a particular feature is one that you shouldn’t use, I don’t use page
space (or much page space) describing the feature. I want to rather use
that page space to describe other stuff that I believe is going to be valu-
able to you and other readers.
✦I should also mention one final thing: Accounting software programs
require you to do a certain amount of preparation before you can use
them to get real work done. If you haven’t started to use QuickBooks
yet, I recommend that you skim through Book I and then read Book II to
find out what you need to do first.
Hey. There’s something else I should tell you. I have fiddled a bit with the
Windows display property settings. For example, I’ve noodled around with
the font settings and most of the colors. The benefit is that the pictures in
this book are easy to read. And that’s good. But the cost of all this is that my
pictures look a little bit different from what you see on your screen. In a few
places, command buttons get “cut off” on the right side of the image, for
example. That’s not perfect, of course. But in the end, the publisher has
found that people are really happier with increased readability. Anyway, I
just thought I should mention this here, up front, in case you had any ques-
tions about it.
Foolish Assumptions
I’m making only three assumptions about your QuickBooks and accounting
skills:
✦You have a PC with Microsoft Windows 2000 SP4 or later, or Windows XP
SP2 or later. (I took pictures of the QuickBooks windows and dialog
boxes using Windows XP, in case you’re interested.)
✦You know a little bit about how to work with your computer.
✦You have or will buy a copy of QuickBooks Pro, QuickBooks Premier, or
QuickBooks Enterprise Solutions for each computer on which you want
to run the program.
In other words, I don’t assume that you’re a computer genius or an M.B.A. or
super-experienced in the arcane rules of accounting. I assume that QuickBooks
and accounting are new subjects to you. But I also assume that you want to
learn the subjects because you need to for your job or your business.
Personally, I use QuickBooks Premier, so this book includes some features
unique to the Premier.

How This Book Is Organized
4
By the way, if you’re just starting out with Microsoft Windows, peruse
Chapter 1 of the Windows User’s Guide or one of the Windows For Dummies
books on your flavor of Windows, such as Windows XP For Dummies, by
Andy Rathbone (Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
How This Book Is Organized
This book is organized into eight individual “books.” Some of these books
give you the skinny on how to powerfully and effectively perform routine
tasks with QuickBooks; others focus on general accounting, business plan-
ning, or other aspects of managing your operation. All of them, however,
deliver the kind of information that savvy business owners need.
Book I: An Accounting Primer
For you non-accountants, Book I covers the basics of general accounting. If
you don’t know a debit from a credit, this is the place to start.
Book II: Getting Ready to Use QuickBooks
Book II lays the groundwork for using QuickBooks effectively: setting up the
program, loading files, and customizing QuickBooks for your purposes.
Book III: Bookkeeping Chores
Book III shows you how to take on those work-a-day tasks in QuickBooks:
invoicing customers, paying vendors, and tracking inventory, just to name 
a few.
Book IV: Accounting Chores
If you really want to get in touch with your inner accountant, this is the part
for you. In Book IV, I take on activity-based costing, preparing a budget, and
job costing.
Book V: Financial Management
In Book V, I dig into advanced financial management strategies: ratio analy-
sis, EVA, and capital budgeting.
Book VI: Business Plans
Ever wonder what Wal-Mart does so right, while Kmart continues to floun-
der? Turn to Book VI to find out how to write a business plan that can help
you find your niche.

Conventions Used in This Book
5
Book VII: Care and Maintenance
Book VII shows you how to do the things that will keep you working happily
and productively in QuickBooks for years to come: setting up a network, pro-
tecting your data, and troubleshooting.
Book VIII: Appendixes
QuickBooks is a great program, but it can’t do it all. You may find that a
spreadsheet program is just the tool you need to supplement QuickBooks.
For that reason, in Book VIII, I provide a quick primer on Excel. I also offer an
appendix detailing several great online government resources, as well as a
glossary of (nearly) every business or accounting term you would ever want
to know.
Stuff at my Web site
Oh, here’s something I should probably mention. This book has a little bit of
companion Web site content that can be found at www.stephenlnelson.
com. In a handful of places, I’ll provide URLs that you can use to download
Excel workbooks discussed in several chapters of this book.
Conventions Used in This Book
To make the best use of your time and energy, you should know about the
conventions I use in this book.
When I want you to type something such as Jennifer, it’s in bold letters.
By the way, except for passwords, you don’t have to worry about the case of
the stuff you type in QuickBooks. If I tell you to type Jennifer, you can type
JENNIFER. Or you can follow poet e. e. cummings’ lead and type jennifer.
Whenever I tell you to choose a command from a menu, I say something like,
Choose Lists➪Items, which simply means to first choose the Lists menu 
and then choose Items. The ➪separates one part of the command from the
next part.
You can choose menus and commands and select dialog box elements with
the mouse. Just click the thing that you want to select.
While I’m on the subject of conventions, let me also mention something
about QuickBooks conventions because it turns out there’s not really any
good place to point this out. QuickBooks doesn’t use document windows the
same way that other Windows programs do. Instead, it locks the active

Special Icons
6
window into place and then displays a list of windows in its Navigator pane,
which is like another little window. To move to a listed window, you click it.
You can tell QuickBooks to use windows like every other program does,
however, by choosing View➪Multiple Windows. You can even remove the
Navigator pane by choosing View➪Open Window List. (You can also move
the other locked pane that lists windows and is called the Shortcuts List by
choosing View➪Shortcuts List.)
Special Icons
Like many computer books, this book uses icons, or little pictures, to flag
things that don’t quite fit into the flow of things:
Whee, here’s a shortcut or pointer to make your life easier!
This icon is just a friendly reminder to do something.
And this icon is a friendly reminder not to do something . . . or else.
This icon points out nerdy technical material that you may want to skip (or
read, if you’re feeling particularly bright).

In This Chapter
 Figuring out the purpose of accounting
 Reviewing the common financial statements
 Understanding the philosophy of accounting
 Discovering income tax accounting and reporting
A
ny discussion of how to use QuickBooks to better manage your busi-
ness begins with a discussion of the basics of accounting. For this
reason, in this chapter and the next two, I attempt to provide the same infor-
mation that you would receive in an introductory college accounting course.
Of course, I tailor the entire discussion to QuickBooks and the small busi-
ness environment. What you’ll read about here and in the next chapters of
this book pretty much describes how accounting works in a small-business
setting using QuickBooks.
If you have had some experience with accounting, if you know how to read
an income statement and balance sheet, or if you know how to construct a
journal entry, you don’t need to read this chapter or the next. However, if
you’re new to accounting and business bookkeeping, take the time to care-
fully read this chapter. The chapter starts by giving a high-level overview of
the purpose of accounting. Then, I review the common financial statements
that any accounting system worth its salt produces. I also discuss some of
the important principles of accounting and the philosophy of accounting.
Finally, I talk a little bit about income tax law and tax accounting.
The Purpose of Accounting
In the movie Creator, Peter O’Toole plays an eccentric professor. At one
point, O’Toole’s character attempts to talk a young student into working as
an unpaid research assistant. When the student protests, noting that he
needs 15 credit hours, O’Toole creates a special 15-credit independent study
named “Introduction to the Big Picture.” In the next section, I describe the
“big picture” of accounting. At its very core, accounting makes perfect, logi-
cal sense.

The Purpose of Accounting
10
The big picture
The most important thing to understand about accounting is that it provides
financial information to stakeholders. Stakeholders are the people who do
business with or interact with a firm; they include managers, employees,
investors, banks, vendors, government authorities, and agencies who may
tax a firm. Stakeholders and their information requirements deserve a bit
more discussion. Why? Because the information needs of these stakeholders
determine what an accounting system must do.
Managers, investors, and entrepreneurs
The first category of stakeholders includes the firm’s managers, investors,
and entrepreneurs. This group needs financial information to determine
whether a business is making money. This group also wants any information
that gives insight into whether a business is growing or contracting and how
healthy or sick it is. In order to fulfill its obligations and duties, this group
often needs detailed information. For example, a manager or entrepreneur
may want to know which customers are particularly profitable — or unprof-
itable. An active investor may want to know which product lines are growing
or contracting.
A related set of information requirements concerns asset and liability record
keeping. An asset is something that the firm owns, such as cash, inventory,
or equipment. A liability is some debt or obligation that the firm owes, such
as bank loans and accounts payable.
Obviously, someone at a firm — perhaps a manager, bookkeeper, or 
accountant — needs to have very detailed records of the amount of cash
that the firm has in its bank accounts, the inventory that the firm has in its
warehouse or on its shelves, and the equipment that the firm owns and uses
in its operations.
If you look over the preceding two paragraphs, nothing I’ve said is particu-
larly surprising. It makes sense, right? Someone who works in a business,
manages a business, or actively invests in a business needs good general
information about the financial affairs of the firm and, in many cases, very
detailed information about important assets (such as cash) and liabilities
(such as bank loans).
External creditors
A second category of stakeholders includes outside firms that loan money 
to a business and credit reporting agencies that supply information to these
lenders. For example, banks want to know about the financial affairs and

Book I
Chapter 1
Principles of
Accounting
The Purpose of Accounting
11
financial condition of a firm before lending money. The accounting system
needs to produce the financial information that a bank requires in order to
consider a loan request.
What information do lenders want? Lenders want to know that a business is
profitable and enjoys a positive cash flow. Profits and positive cash flows
allow a business to easily repay debt. A bank or other lender also wants to
see assets that could be liquidated, in a worst case scenario, to pay a loan —
and also other debts that may represent a claim on the firm’s assets.
Vendors also typically require financial information from a firm. A vendor often
loans money to a firm by extending trade credit. What’s noteworthy about
this is that vendors sometimes require special accounting. For example, one
of the categories of vendors that a company such as Wiley Publishing, Inc.,
deals with is authors. In order to pay an author the royalty that he or she is
entitled to, Wiley puts in a fair amount of work to calculate royalty-per-unit
amounts and then reports and remits these amounts to authors.
Other firms sometimes have similar financial reporting requirements for ven-
dors. Franchisees (such as the man or woman who owns and operates the
local McDonald’s) pay a franchise fee based on revenues. Retailers may per-
form special accounting and reporting in order to enjoy rebates and incen-
tives from the manufacturers of the products that they sell.
Government agencies
Predictable stakeholders requiring financial information from a business are
the federal and state government agencies with jurisdiction over the firm.
For example, every business in the United States needs to report on its rev-
enues, expenses, and profits so that the firm can correctly calculate income
tax due to the federal government and then pay that tax.
Firms with employees must also report to the federal and state government
on wages paid to those employees — and pay payroll taxes based on metrics,
such as number of employees, wages paid to employees, and unemployment
benefits claimed by past employees.
Providing this sort of financial information to government agencies repre-
sents a key duty of a firm’s accounting system.
Business form generation
In addition to the financial reporting described in the preceding paragraphs,
accounting systems typically perform one other key task for businesses: pro-
ducing business forms. For example, an accounting system almost always

Reviewing the Common Financial Statements
12
produces the checks needed to pay vendors. In addition, an accounting
system also prepares the invoices and payroll checks. More sophisticated
accounting systems, such as those used by large firms, prepare many other
business forms including purchase orders, monthly customer statements,
credit memos to customers, sales receipts, and so forth.
Every accounting function that I have described so far is performed ably by
each of the versions of QuickBooks: QuickBooks Simple Start, QuickBooks
Pro, QuickBooks Premier, and QuickBooks Enterprise.
Reviewing the Common Financial Statements
With the background information just provided, I’m ready to talk about some
of the common financial statements or accounting reports that an account-
ing system like QuickBooks produces. If you understand which reports you
want your accounting system to produce, you should find it much easier to
collect the raw data necessary to prepare these reports.
In the following paragraphs, I describe the three principal financial state-
ments: the income statement, the balance sheet, and the statement of cash
flows. I also briefly describe a fourth, catch-all category of accounting
reports.
Don’t worry — I’ll go through this material slowly. You need to understand
what financial statements your accounting systems are supposed to provide
and what data these financial statements supply.
The income statement
Perhaps the most important financial statement that an accounting system
produces is the income statement. The income statement is also known as 
a profit and loss statement. An income statement summarizes a firm’s rev-
enues and expenses for a particular period of time. Revenues represent
amounts that a business earns by providing goods and services to its cus-
tomers. Expenses represent amounts that a firm spends providing those
goods and services. If a business can provide goods or services to cus-
tomers for revenues that exceed its expenses, the firm earns a profit. If
expenses exceed revenues, obviously, the firm suffers a loss.
To show you how this all works — and it’s really pretty simple — take a 
look at Tables 1-1 and 1-2. Table 1-1 summarizes the sales that an imaginary
business enjoys. Table 1-2 summarizes the expenses that the same business
incurs for the same period of time. These two tables provide all the informa-
tion necessary to construct an income statement.

Using the information from Tables 1-1 and 1-2, you can construct the simple
income statement shown in Table 1-3. Understanding the details of an income
statement is key to your understanding of how accounting works and what
accounting tries to do. Therefore, I want to go into some detail discussing
this income statement.

Reviewing the Common Financial Statements

The first thing to note about the income statement shown in Table 1-3 is the
sales revenue figure of $13,000. This sales revenue figure shows the sales
generated for a particular period of time. The $13,000 figure shown in Table
1-3 comes directly from the Sales Journal shown in Table 1-1.
One important thing to recognize about accounting for sales revenue is that
revenue gets counted when goods or services are provided and not when a
customer pays for the goods or services. If you look at the list of sales
shown in Table 1-1, for example, Joe (the first customer listed) may have
paid $1,000 in cash, but Bob, Frank, and Abdul (the second, third, and fourth
customers) may have paid for their purchases with a credit card. Yoshio,
Marie, and Jeremy (the fifth, sixth, and seventh customers listed) may not
have even paid for their purchases at the time the goods or services were
provided. These customers may have simply promised to pay for the pur-
chases at some later date. However, this timing of the payment for goods or
services doesn’t matter. Accountants have figured out that you count rev-
enue when goods or services are provided. Information about when cus-
tomers pay for those goods or services, if you want that information, can
come from lists of customer payments.
Cost of goods sold and gross margins are two other values that you commonly
see on income statements. Before I discuss cost of goods sold and gross
margins, however, let me add a little more detail to this example. Suppose,
for example, that the financial information shown in Tables 1-1, 1-2, and 1-3
shows the financial results from your business: the hot dog stand that you
operate for one day at the major sporting event in the city where you live.
Table 1-1 describes sales to hungry customers. Table 1-2 summarizes the
one-day expenses of operating your super-duper hot dog stand.
In this case, the actual items that you sell — hot dogs and buns — are shown
separately on the income statement as cost of goods sold. By separately
showing the cost of the goods sold, the income statement can show what is
called a gross margin. The gross margin is the amount of revenue left over
after paying for the cost of goods. In Table 1-3, the cost of goods sold equals
$3,000 for purchases of dogs and buns. The difference between the $13,000
of sales revenue and the $3,000 of cost of goods sold equals $10,000, which is
the gross margin.
Knowing how to calculate gross margin allows you to estimate firm break-
even points and also to perform profit, volume, and cost analyses. All these
techniques are extremely useful for thinking about the financial affairs of
your business. In fact, Book VI, Chapter 1 describes how you can perform
these analyses.
The operating expenses portion of the simple income statement shown in
Table 1-3 repeats the other information listed in the Expenses Journal. The

$1,000 of rent, the $4,000 of wages, and the $1,000 of supplies get totaled.
These operating expenses are then subtracted from the gross.
Do you see, then, what an income statement does? An income statement
reports on the revenues that a firm has generated. It shows the cost of goods
sold and calculates the gross margin. It identifies and shows operating
expenses, and finally, shows the profits of the business.
One other important point: Income statements summarize revenues,
expenses, and profits for a particular period of time. Some managers and
entrepreneurs, for example, may want to prepare income statements on a
daily basis. Public companies are required to prepare income statements on
a quarterly and annual basis. And taxing authorities, such as the Internal
Revenue Service, require tax return preparation both quarterly and annually.
Technically speaking, the quarterly statements required by the Internal
Revenue Service don’t need to report revenue. The Internal Revenue Service
only requires quarterly statements of wages paid to employees. Only the
annual income statements required by the Internal Revenue Service report
both revenue and expenses. These are the income statements produced to
prepare an annual income tax return.
Balance sheet
The second most important financial statement that an accounting system
produces is a balance sheet. A balance sheet reports on a business’s assets,
liabilities, and owner contributions of capital at a particular point in time.
✦The assets shown on a balance sheet are those items that are owned by
the business, which have value and for which money was paid.
✦The liabilities shown on a balance sheet are those amounts that a busi-
ness owes to other people, businesses, and government agencies.
✦The owner’s contributions of capital are the amounts that owners, part-
ners, or shareholders have paid into the business in the form of invest-
ment or have reinvested in the business by leaving profits inside the
company.
As long as you understand what assets and liabilities are, a balance sheet is
easy to understand and interpret. Table 1-4, for example, shows a simple bal-
ance sheet. Pretend that this balance sheet shows the condition of the hot
dog stand at the beginning of the day, before any hot dogs have been sold.
The first portion of the balance sheet shows and totals the two assets of the
hot dog stand business: the $1,000 cash in the cash register in a box under
the counter and the $3,000 worth of hot dogs and buns that you’ve pur-
chased to sell during the day.

Balance sheets can use several other categories to report assets: accounts
receivable (these are amounts that customers owe), investments, fixtures,
equipment, and long-term investments. In the case of a small owner-operated
business, not all these asset categories show up. But if you look at the bal-
ance sheet of a very large business — say one of the 100 largest businesses
in the United States — you see these other categories.
The liabilities section of the balance sheet shows the amounts that the firm
owes to other people and businesses. For example, the balance sheet in Table
1-4 shows $2,000 of accounts payable and a $1,000 loan payable. Presumably,
the $2,000 of accounts payable is the money that you owe to the vendors
who have supplied your hot dogs and buns. The $1,000 loan payable repre-
sents some loan you’ve taken out — perhaps from some well-meaning and
naive relative.
The owner’s equity section shows the amount that the owner, the partners,
or shareholders have contributed to the business in the form of original
funds invested or profits reinvested. One important point about the balance
sheet shown in Table 1-4: This balance sheet shows how owner’s equity
looks when the business is a sole proprietorship. In the case of a sole propri-
etor, only one line is reported in the owner’s equity section of the balance
sheet. This line combines all contributions made by the proprietor — both
amounts originally invested and amounts reinvested.
I talk a bit more about owner’s equity accounting later in this chapter because
the owner’s equity sections look different for partnerships and corporations.
Before I get into that, however, let me make two important observations about
the balance sheet shown in Table 1-4. A balance sheet needs to balance. This
means that the total assets must equal the total liabilities and owner’s equity.

Book I
Chapter 1
Principles of
Accounting
Reviewing the Common Financial Statements
17
In the balance sheet shown in Table 1-4, for example, total assets show as
$4,000. Total liabilities and owner’s equity also show as $4,000. This equality
is no coincidence. If an accounting system works right and the accountants
and bookkeepers entering information into this system do their jobs right,
the balance sheet balances.
A balance sheet provides a snapshot of a business’s financial condition at a
particular point in time. For example, I mention in the introductory remarks
related to Table 1-4 that the balance sheet in this table shows the financial
condition of the hot dog stand business immediately before beginning the
day’s business activities. You can prepare a balance sheet for any point in
time. It is key that you understand that a balance sheet is prepared for a par-
ticular point in time.
By convention, businesses prepare balance sheets to show the financial con-
dition at the end of the period of time for which an income statement is pre-
pared. For example, a business typically prepares an income statement on
an annual basis. In this orthodox situation, a firm also prepares a balance
sheet at the very end of the year.
At this point, I return to something that I alluded to previously in the chapter —
the fact that the owner’s equity section of a balance sheet looks different for
different types of businesses.
Table 1-5 shows how the owner’s equity section of a balance sheet looks for
a partnership. In Table 1-5, I show how the owner’s equity section of the hot
dog stand business appears if, instead of having a sole proprietor named S.
Nelson running the hot dog stand, the business is actually owned and oper-
ated by three partners named Tom, Dick, and Harry. In this case, the part-
ners’ equity section shows the amounts originally invested and any amounts
reinvested by the partners. As is the case with sole proprietorships, each
partner’s contributions and reinvested profits appear on a single line.

Go ahead and take a look at Table 1-6. It shows how the owner’s equity sec-
tion looks for a corporation.

This next part is a little bit weird. For a corporation, the amounts that show
in the owner’s equity or shareholder’s equity section actually fall into two
major categories: retained earnings and contributed capital. Retained earnings
represent profits that the shareholders have left in the business. Contributed
capital is the money originally contributed by the shareholders to the 
corporation.
The retained earnings thing makes sense, right? That’s just the money — the
profits — that investors have reinvested in the business.
The contributed capital thing is more complicated. Here’s how it works: If
you buy a share of stock in some new corporation — for say, $5 — typically
some portion of that price per share is for par value. Now don’t ask me to
justify par value. It really stems from business practices that were common a
century or more ago. Just trust that typically, if you pay some amount — again,
say $5 — for a share, some portion of the amount that you pay — maybe 10
cents a share or $1 a share — is for par value.
In the owner’s equity section of a corporation’s balance sheet, capital that’s
contributed by original investors is broken down into the amounts paid for
this mysterious par value and the amounts paid in excess of this par value.
For example, in Table 1-6, you can see that $100 of shareholder’s equity or
owner’s equity represents amounts paid for par value. Another $400 of the
amounts contributed by the original investors represents amounts paid in
excess of par value. The total shareholder’s equity, or total corporate owner’s
equity, equals the sum of the capital stock par value, the contributed capital
and excess of par value, and any retained earnings. So in Table 1-6, the total
shareholder’s equity equals $1,000.
Statement of cash flows
Now I come to the one tricky financial statement: the statement of cash flows.
Before I begin, I have one comment to make about the statement of cash flows:
As an accountant, I’ve worked with many bright managers and business

people. No matter how much handholding and explanation I or other
accountants provide, some of these smart people never quite get some of
the numbers on the statement of cash flows. In fact, many of the students
who major in accounting never (in my opinion, at least) quite understand
how a statement of cash flows really works.
For this reason, don’t spend too much time spinning your wheels on this
statement or trying to understand what it does. QuickBooks does supply a
statement of cash flows, but you don’t need to use this statement. In fact,
QuickBooks produces cash basis income statements, which give you almost
the same information — and in a more easy-to-understand format.
I think the best way to explain what a statement of cash flows does is to ask
you to look again at the balance sheet shown in Table 1-4. This is the balance
sheet for the imaginary hot dog stand at the beginning of the day.
Now take a look at Table 1-7, which shows the balance sheet at the end of
the day, after operations for the hot dog stand have ended. Notice that at the
start of the day, cash equals $1,000, and at the end of the day, cash equals
$5,000. The statement of cash flows explains why cash changes from the one
number to the other number over a period of time. In other words, a state-
ment of cash flows explains how cash goes from $1,000 at the start of the
day to $5,000 at the end of the day.

Table 1-8, not coincidentally, shows a statement of cash flows that explains
how cash flowed for your imaginary hot dog stand business. If you’re read-
ing this book, presumably, you need to understand this statement. I start at
the bottom of the statement and work up.

By convention, accountants show negative numbers inside parentheses.
These parentheses more clearly flag negative values than a simple minus
sign would.
The last three lines of the statement of cash flows are all easily understand-
able. The cash balance at the end of the period, $5,000, shows what cash the
business holds at the end of the day. The cash balance at the start of the
period, $1,000, shows the cash that the business holds at the beginning of
the day. Both the cash balance at the start of the period and the cash bal-
ance at the end of the period tie to the cash balance values reported on the
two balance sheets. (Look at Table 1-4 and Table 1-7 to corroborate this
assertion.) Clearly, if you start the period with $1,000 and end the period
with $5,000, cash has increased by $4,000. That’s an arithmetic certainty. No
question there, right?
The financing activities of the statement of cash flows show how firm bor-
rowing and firm debt repayment affect the firm cash flow. If the hot dog
stand business uses its profits to repay the $1,000 loan payable — and, in
this case, this is what happened — this $1,000 cash outflow shows up in the
financing activities portion of the statement of cash flows as a negative
$1,000.
The top portion of the statement of cash flows is often the trickiest to under-
stand. Note, however, that I’ve talked about everything else in this statement.
So, with a strong push, you can fight your way through to understanding
what is going on here.

Book I
Chapter 1
Principles of
Accounting
Reviewing the Common Financial Statements
21
The operating activities portion of the statement of cash flows essentially
shows the cash that comes from the profit. If you look at Table 1-8, for exam-
ple, you see that the first line in the operating activities portion of the state-
ment of cash flows is net income of $4,000. This is the net income amount
reported on the income statement for the period. However, the net income
or operating profit reported on the business’s income statement isn’t neces-
sarily the same thing as cash income or cash profit. A variety of factors must
be adjusted in order to convert this net income amount to what’s essentially
a cash operating profit amount.
For example, in the case of the hot dog stand business, if you use some of
the profits to pay off all the accounts payable, this payoff uses up some of
your cash profit. This is exactly what Table 1-8 shows. You can see that the
decrease in the accounts payable from $2,000 to $0 over the day required,
quite logically, $2,000 of the net income. Another way to think about this is
that essentially, you used up $2,000 of your cash profits to pay off accounts
payable. Remember that the accounts payable is the amount that you owed
your vendors for hot dogs and buns.
Another adjustment is required for the decrease in inventory. The decrease
in inventory from the start of the period to the end of the period produces
cash. Basically, you’re liquidating inventory. Another way to think about this
is that although this inventory — the hot dogs and buns in our example —
shows up as an expense for the day’s income statement, it isn’t purchased
during the day. It doesn’t consume cash during the day; it was purchased at
some point in the past.
When you combine the net income, the accounts payable adjustment, and
the inventory adjustment, you get the net cash provided by the operating
activities. In Table 1-8, these three amounts combine to $5,000 of cash pro-
vided by the operations.
After you understand the details of the financing and operating activities
areas of the statement of cash flows, the statement makes sense. Net cash
provided by the operating activities equals $5,000. Financing activities
reduce cash by $1,000. This means that cash actually increased over the
period by $4,000, which explains why cash starts the period at $1,000 and
ends the period at $5,000.
Other accounting statements
You can probably come up with examples of several other popular or useful
accounting reports. Not surprisingly, a good accounting system such as
QuickBooks produces most of these reports. For example, one very common
report or financial statement is a list of the amounts that your customers

Reviewing the Common Financial Statements

owe you. It’s a good idea to prepare and review such reports on a regular
basis to make sure that you don’t have customers turning into collection
problems.
Table 1-9 shows how the simplest sort of accounts receivable report may
look: Each customer is named along with the amount owed.

Table 1-10 shows another common accounting report — an inventory report
that the hot dog stand may have at the start of the day. An inventory report
like the one shown in Table 1-10 would probably name the various items
held for resale, the quantity held, and the amount or value of the inventory
item. A report such as this is useful to make sure that you have the appropri-
ate quantities of inventory in stock. (Think of how useful such a report
would be if you really were planning to sell thousands of hot dogs at major
sporting events in your hometown.)

Putting it all together
By now, you should understand what an accounting system does. When you
boil everything down to its essence, it’s straightforward, isn’t it? Really, an
accounting system just provides you with the financial information that you
need to run your business.

Let me add a tangential but important point. QuickBooks supplies all this
accounting information. For the most part, preparing these sorts of financial
statements in QuickBooks is pretty darn easy. But first, you’ll find it helpful
to learn a bit more about accounting and bookkeeping. I go over that infor-
mation in the coming chapters. Also, note that the big picture stuff covered
Curious about different business forms?
Curious about the differences among a sole
proprietorship, a partnership, and a corpora-
tion? A sole proprietorship is formed automati-
cally in most states and in most industries when
an individual decides to go into business. In
many jurisdictions, the sole proprietor needs to
acquire or apply for a business license from the
state or local city government. Other than that
modest hurdle, sole proprietorship requires no
other special prerequisites.
A partnership is formed automatically when
two or more people enter into a joint business
or investment activity for the purpose of making
a profit. As is the case with a sole proprietor-
ship, partnerships typically need to acquire a
business license from the state and perhaps
the federal government. Partnership formation
doesn’t necessarily require any additional
paperwork or legal maneuvering. However, if
you do enter into a partnership, most attorneys
(probably all attorneys) will tell you that you do
so at a certain amount of risk if you don’t have
an attorney draw up a partnership agreement
that outlines the duties, rights, and responsibil-
ities of the partners. However, you can actually
form a partnership simply by collaborating in
business with someone. The law books are full
of stories of people, for example, who have
inadvertently created partnerships merely by
collaborating on some project, sharing office
space, or working together in some activity.
In comparison, most states allow several other
business forms, including corporations, limited
liability companies, and limited liability partner-
ships. These other business forms require con-
siderably more work to set up, sometimes the
assistance of a good attorney or accountant,
and payment of at least several hundred — and
possibly several thousand — dollars in legal
and licensing fees. The unique feature of most
of these other business forms, however, is that
the corporation or limited liability company or
limited liability partnership becomes a separate
legal entity. In many cases, this separate legal
entity protects investors from creditors who
have a claim on the assets of the business. In
comparison, in a sole proprietorship or a part-
nership, the sole proprietor and the partners
are liable for the debts and obligations of the
proprietorship or the partnership.
If you have questions about the correct busi-
ness form in which to operate, talk with a good
local attorney or accountant. He or she can
assist you in choosing the appropriate business
form and in considering both the legal and tax
aspects of choosing a particular form. As a
general rule, more sophisticated business
forms such as corporations, limited liability
companies, or limited liability partnerships
deliver significant legal and tax benefits to
investors and managers. Unfortunately, these
more sophisticated business forms also require
considerably more legal and accounting fiddle-
faddling.

in this chapter is the most important knowledge that you need. If you under-
stand the ideas described in this chapter, the battle is more than half won.
The philosophy of accounting
Maybe the phrase philosophy of accounting is too strong, but accounting
does rest on a rather small set of fundamental assumptions and principles.
People often refer to these fundamentals as generally accepted accounting
principles.
I want to quickly summarize what these principles are. I find — and I bet you’ll
find the same thing — that understanding the principles gives context and
makes accounting practices more understandable. With this in mind, let me
go through the half dozen or so key accounting principles and assumptions.
Revenue principle
The revenue principle, also known as the realization principle, states that
revenue is earned when the sale is made. The sale is made, typically, when
goods or services are provided. A key component of the revenue principle,
when it comes to the sale of goods, is that revenue is earned when legal own-
ership of the goods passes from seller to buyer.
Note that revenue isn’t earned when you collect cash for something. It turns
out, perhaps counterintuitively, that counting revenue when cash is collected
doesn’t give the business owner a good idea of what sales really are. Some
customers may pay deposits early, before actually receiving the goods or
services. Often customers want to use trade credit, paying a firm at some
point in the future for goods or services. Because cash flows can fluctuate
wildly — even something like a delay in the mail can affect cash flow — you
don’t want to use cash collection from customers as a measure of sales.
Besides that, you can easily track cash collections from customers. So why
not have the extra information about when sales actually occur?
Expense principle
The expense principle states that an expense occurs when the business uses
goods or receives services. In other words, the expense principle is the flip
side of the revenue principle. As is the case with the revenue principle, if you
receive some goods, simply receiving the goods means that you have incurred
the expense of the goods. Similarly, if you received some service — services
from your lawyer, for example — you have incurred the expense. It doesn’t
matter that your lawyer takes a few days or a few weeks to send you the bill.
You incur an expense when goods or services are received.

Book I
Chapter 1
Principles of
Accounting
Reviewing the Common Financial Statements
25
Matching principle
The matching principle is related to the revenue and the expense principles.
The matching principle states that when you recognize revenue, you should
match related expenses with the revenue. The best example of the matching
principle concerns the case of businesses that resell inventory. In the hot
dog stand example, you should count the expense of a hot dog and the
expense of a bun on the day when you sell that hot dog and that bun. Don’t
count the expense when you buy the buns and the dogs. Count the expense
when you sell them. In other words, match the expense of the item with the
revenue of the item.
Accrual-based accounting, which is a term you have probably heard, is what
you get when you apply the revenue principle, the expense principle, and
the matching principle. In a nutshell, accrual-based accounting means that
you record revenue when a sale is made and record expenses when goods
are used or services are received.
Cost principle
The cost principle states that amounts in your accounting system should be
quantified, or measured, by using historical cost. For example, if you have a
business and the business owns a building, that building, according to the
cost principle, shows up on your balance sheet at its historical cost. You
don’t adjust the values in an accounting system for changes in a fair market
value. You use the original historical costs.
I should admit that the cost principle is occasionally violated in a couple of
ways. The cost principle is adjusted through the application of depreciation,
which I discuss in the next chapter. Also, sometimes fair market values are
used to value assets, but only when assets are worth less than they cost.
Objectivity principle
The objectivity principle states that accounting measurements and account-
ing reports should use objective, factual, and verifiable data. In other words,
accountants, accounting systems, and accounting reports should rely on
subjectivity as little as possible.
An accountant always wants to use objective data (even if it’s bad) rather
than subjective data (even if the subjective data is arguably better). The idea
is that objectivity becomes a protection against the corrupting influence that
subjectivity can introduce into a firm’s accounting records.

Reviewing the Common Financial Statements
26
Continuity assumption
The continuity assumption — accountants call it an assumption rather than a
principle for reasons unbeknownst to me — states that accounting systems
assume that a business will continue to operate. The importance of the con-
tinuity assumption becomes most clear if you consider the ramifications of
assuming that a business won’t continue. If a business won’t continue, it
becomes very unclear how one should value assets if the assets have no
resale value. This sounds like gobbledygook, but think about the implicit
continuity assumption built into the balance sheet for the hot dog stand at
the beginning of the day. (This is the hot dog stand balance sheet that shows
up in Table 1-4.)
Implicit in that balance sheet is the assumption that hot dogs and hot dog
buns have some value because they can be sold. If a business won’t continue
operations, no assurance exists that any of the inventory can be sold. If the
inventory can’t be sold, what does that say about the owner’s equity value
shown in the balance sheet?
You can see, I hope, the sorts of accounting problems that you get into with-
out the assumption that the business will continue to operate.
Unit-of-measure assumption
The unit-of-measure assumption assumes that a business’s domestic currency
is the appropriate unit of measure for the business to use in its accounting.
In other words, the unit-of-measure assumption states that it’s okay for 
U.S. businesses to use U.S. dollars in their accounting. And it’s okay for U.K.
businesses to use pounds sterling as the unit of measure in their accounting
system. The unit-of-measure assumption also states, implicitly, that even
though inflation and occasionally deflation changes the purchasing power 
of the unit of measure used in the accounting system, that’s still okay. Sure,
inflation and deflation foul up some of the numbers in a firm’s financial 
statements. But the unit-of-measure assumption says that’s usually okay —
especially in light of the fact that no better alternatives exist.
Separate entity assumption
The separate entity assumption states that a business entity, like a sole pro-
prietorship, is a separate entity, a separate thing from its business owner.
And the separate entity assumption says that a partnership is a separate
thing from the partners who own part of the business. The separate entity
assumption, therefore, enables one to prepare financial statements just for
the sole proprietorship or just for the partnership. As a result, the separate
entity assumption also relies on a business being separate and distinct and
definable as compared to its business owners.

These are the basic accounting principles that underlie business accounting.
These principles and assumptions are implicit in all the discussions in this
book as well as those in all the other books of this all-in-one desk reference.
It is no exaggeration to say that they permeate almost everything related to
business accounting.
A Few Words about Tax Accounting
I’m not going to talk much about tax accounting or tax preparation in this
book. However, one of the key reasons that you do accounting and use a 
program such as QuickBooks is to make your tax accounting easier. That’s
obvious. So a fair question is this: How does what I’ve said so far relate to
income tax return preparation?
This is a tough question to answer. Tax laws typically don’t map to generally
accepted accounting principles. Generally accepted accounting principles
are not the same thing as income tax law.
However, if you use good basic accounting practices as you operate
QuickBooks, you get financial information that can be used to easily prepare
your tax returns, especially if you get some help from your CPA.
If you want, you can also use income tax rules to fine-tune your accounting
and bookkeeping. This practice, which is technically known as an other 
comprehensive basis of accounting (OCBOA), is generally considered an
appropriate way to perform accounting for small and medium enterprises.
If you have more specific questions about the right way to create a financial
statement using generally accepted accounting principles to prepare an
income tax return, consult your CPA or your tax advisor. Applying generally
accepted accounting principles or tax laws in specific situations requires an
understanding of the specific circumstances and the industry in which a firm
operates. Given the one-way nature of the communication in this book — me
chattering away at you — I can’t provide that sort of detailed commentary
here. Sorry, buddy. . . .

he preceding chapter describes why businesses create financial state-

Book I, Chapter 1, or if you’ve spent much time managing a business, you
probably know what you need to know about financial statements. In truth,
financial statements are pretty straightforward. An income statement, for
example, shows a firm’s revenues, expenses, and profits. A balance sheet
itemizes a firm’s assets, liabilities, and owner’s equity. So far, so good.
Unfortunately, preparing traditional financial statements is more complicated
and tedious. The work of preparing financial statements — called accounting
or bookkeeping — requires either a whole bunch of fiddle-faddling with num-
bers or learning how to use double-entry bookkeeping.
In this chapter, I start by describing the fiddle-faddle method. This is not
because I think you should use that method. In fact, I assume that you even-
tually want to use QuickBooks for your accounting and, by extension, for
double-entry bookkeeping. However, if you understand the fiddle-faddle
method, you’ll clearly see why double-entry bookkeeping is so much better.
After I describe the fiddle-faddle method, I am going to walk you through the
steps to using and understanding double-entry bookkeeping. After you see
all the anguish and grief that the fiddle-faddle method causes, you should
have no trouble appreciating why double-entry bookkeeping works so much
better. And I hope you’ll also commit to the 30 or 40 minutes necessary to
learn the basics of double-entry bookkeeping.

The Fiddle-Faddle Method of Accounting

The Fiddle-Faddle Method of Accounting
Most small businesses — or at least those small businesses where the owners
aren’t already trained in accounting — have used the fiddle-faddle method.
For example, take a peek at the financial statements shown in Tables 2-1 and
2-2. If you’ve read or reviewed Book I, Chapter 1, you may recognize these
financial statements as those that stem from the imaginary hot dog stand
business. Table 2-1 shows the income statement for the one day a year that
the imaginary hot dog stand business operates. Table 2-2 shows the balance
sheet at the start of the first day of operation.

With the fiddle-faddle method of accounting, you individually calculate each
number shown in the financial statement. For example, the sales revenue figure
shown in Table 2-1 equals $13,000. The fiddle-faddle method of accounting

Book I
Chapter 2
Double-Entry
Bookkeeping
The Fiddle-Faddle Method of Accounting
31
requires you to somehow come up with this sales revenue number manually.
You may be able to come up with this number by remembering each of the
sales that you made over the day. Or, if you prepare invoices or sales receipts,
you may be able to come up with this number by adding all the individual
sales. If you have a cash register, you may also be able to come up with this
number by looking at the cash register tape.
Other revenue and expense numbers get calculated in the same crude
manner. For example, the $1,000 of rent expense gets calculated by either
remembering what amount you paid for rent, or by looking in your check-
book register and finding the check that you wrote for rent.
The balance sheet values get produced in roughly the same way. You can
deduce the cash balance of $1,000, for example, by looking at the checkbook
or, in a worst case scenario, the bank statement. You can deduce the inven-
tory balance of $3,000 by adding the individual inventory item values. You
can calculate the liability and owner’s equity amounts in similar fashion.
Some of the values shown in an income statement or on a balance sheet get
plugged — meaning that they’re calculated using other numbers from the
financial statement. For example, you don’t look up the profit amount in any
particular place; instead, you calculate profit by subtracting expenses from
revenue. You can also, of course, calculate balance sheet values, such as
total assets, owner’s equity, and total liability of owner’s equity.
Okay, I admit it: The fiddle-faddle method of accounting works reasonably
well for a very small business as long as you have a good checkbook. So, for
a very small business, you may be able to get away with this crude, piece-
meal approach to accounting.
But unfortunately, the fiddle-faddle method suffers from three horrible weak-
nesses for a firm that doesn’t have super-simple finances:
✦It’s not systematic enough to be automated. Now, admittedly, you may
not care that the fiddle-faddle approach isn’t systematic enough for
automation. But this point is an important one. A systematic approach
like double-entry bookkeeping can be automated, as QuickBooks does.
This automation means that the task of preparing financial statements
requires — oh, I don’t know — maybe five mouse clicks. Because the
fiddle-faddle approach can’t be automated, every time you want to 
produce financial statements, you or some poor co-worker goes to an
enormous amount of work to collect the numbers and all the raw data
necessary to produce information like that shown in Table 2-1 and Table
2-2. In reality, of course, with more complicated financial statements,
someone does much, much more work.

How Double-Entry Bookkeeping Works
32
✦It’s very easy to lose details. This sounds abstract, but let me give you a
good, concrete example. If you look at Table 2-1, you see that the hot dog
stand business incurs only three operating expenses: rent, wages, and
supplies. If you know the operating expense categories that the business
incurs, it is fairly easy to look through the check register and find the
check or checks that pay rent, for example. You can use a similar approach
with the wages expense. Also, you can use a similar approach with the
supplies expense. However, what if you also have an advertising expense
category or a business license expense, or some other easy-to-forget cat-
egory? If you forget a category, you miss expenses. For example, if you
forget that you spent money advertising and, thereby, forget to tally
your advertising expenses, that whole category of operating expense
gets omitted from your income statement.
✦It doesn’t allow rigorous error checking. This business about error
checking seems, perhaps, nit-picky. However, error checking is impor-
tant with accounting and bookkeeping systems. With all the numbers
and transactions floating around, errors easily creep into the system. I
discuss more about error checking later in this chapter, but let me give
you an example of the sort of error checking an accounting system can
(and should) perform. Take a look at the example of the sales transac-
tion. If you sell an item for $1,000, you can actually check that amount 
by comparing it to your record of what the customer paid. This makes
sense, right? If you sell me an item for $1,000, you actually should be
able to compare that $1,000 sale to the amount of cash that I pay you. A
$1,000 sale to me should correspond to a $1,000 cash payment from me.
The fiddle-faddle method can’t make these comparisons. However,
double-entry bookkeeping can.
You see where I’m at now, right? I’ve admitted that you can construct financial
statements using the fiddle-faddle method. But I hope I’ve also convinced
you that the fiddle-faddle method suffers from some really debilitating weak-
nesses. I’m talking about something as important as how you can best manage
the financial affairs of your business. These weaknesses indicate that you
need a better tool. Specifically, you need double-entry bookkeeping, which I
discuss next.
How Double-Entry Bookkeeping Works
After you conclude that the fiddle-faddle method is for the birds, you’re
ready to absorb the necessary accounting theory and learn the bookkeeping
tricks required to employ double-entry bookkeeping. Essentially, you need
two things in order to work with double-entry bookkeeping. First, you need
an understanding of the accounting model. And second, you need a grasp of

Book I
Chapter 2
Double-Entry
Bookkeeping
How Double-Entry Bookkeeping Works
33
the mechanics of debits and credits. Neither of these things is difficult. If you
flip ahead a few pages, you can see that I am going to spend only a few pages
talking about this material. How difficult can anything be that can be described
in just a few pages? Not very, right?
The accounting model
Here’s the first thing to understand and internalize in order to use double-
entry bookkeeping: Modern accounting uses an accounting model that says
assets equal liabilities plus owner’s equity. The following formula expresses
this in a more conventional, algebraic form:
assets = liabilities + owner’s equity
If you think about this for a moment and flip back to Table 2-2, you see that
this formula summarizes the organization of a business’s balance sheet. Con-
ceptually, the formula says that a business owns stuff and that the money or
the funds for that stuff come either from creditors (such as the bank or some
vendor) or the owners (either in the form of original contributed capital or
perhaps in reinvested profits). If you understand the balance sheet shown in
Table 2-2 and discussed here, you understand the first core principle of
double-entry bookkeeping. This isn’t that tough so far, is it?
Here’s the second thing to understand about the basic accounting model:
Revenues increase owner’s equity and expenses decrease owner’s equity.
Think about that for a minute. That makes intuitive sense. If you receive
$1,000 in cash from a customer, you have $1,000 more in the business. If you
write a $1,000 check to pay a bill, you have $1,000 less in the business.
Another way to say the same thing is that profits clearly add to the owner’s
equity. Profits get reinvested in the business and boost owner’s equity.
Profits are calculated as the difference between revenues and expenses. If
revenues exceed expenses, profits exist.
Let me review where I am so far in this discussion about the basic account-
ing model. The basic model says that assets equal liabilities plus owner’s
equity. In other words, the total assets of a firm equal the total of its liabili-
ties and owner’s equity. Furthermore, revenue increases the owner’s equity
and expenses decrease the owner’s equity.
At this point, you don’t have to intuitively understand the logic of the account-
ing model and the way that revenues and expenses plug into the owner’s
equity of the model. If you do “get it” that’s great, but not necessary. However,
you do need to memorize or remember (for at least the next few paragraphs)
the manner in which the basic model works.

How Double-Entry Bookkeeping Works
34
This may seem like a redundant point, but note that a balance sheet is con-
structed by using information about a firm’s assets, liabilities, and owner’s
equity. Similarly, note that a firm’s income statement is constructed by using
information about its revenues and its expenses. Remember that all this dis-
cussion, all this tediousness, is really about how you collect the information
necessary to produce an income statement and a balance sheet.
Now I come to perhaps the most important point to understand in order to
“get” double-entry bookkeeping. Every transaction and every economic
event that occurs in the life of a firm produces two effects: An increase in
some account shown on the balance sheet or on the income statement, and
a decrease in some account shown on the balance sheet or income state-
ment. When something happens, economically speaking, that something
affects at least two types of information shown in the financial statement. In
the next few paragraphs, I give you some examples so you can really under-
stand this.
Suppose that in your business, you sell $1,000 of an item for $1,000 in cash.
In the case of this transaction or economic event, two things occur from the
perspective of your financial statements:
✦Your cash increases by $1,000.
✦Your sales revenue increases by $1,000.
Another way to say this same thing is that your $1,000 cash sale affects both
your balance sheet (because cash increases) and your income statement
(because sales revenue is earned).
See the duality? And, just a paragraph ago, you were thinking this might be
too complicated for you, weren’t you?
Here’s another common example: Suppose that you buy $1,000 of inventory for
cash. In this case, you decrease your cash balance by $1,000, but you increase
your inventory balance by $1,000. Note that in this case, both effects of the
transaction appear in sort of the same area of your financial statement —
the list of assets. Nevertheless, this transaction also affects two accounts.
When I use the word account, I simply mean some value that appears on
your income statement or on your balance sheet. If you look at Tables 2-1
and 2-2, for example, any value that appears on those financial statements
that isn’t simply a calculation represents an account. In essence, an account
tracks some group of assets, liabilities, owner’s equity, contributions, rev-
enues, or expenses. I talk more about accounts in the next section when I get
to the actual mechanics of double-entry bookkeeping.

Book I
Chapter 2
Double-Entry
Bookkeeping

35
Here’s another example that shows this duality of effects in an economic
event: Suppose that you spend $1,000 in cash on advertising. In this case, this
economic event reduces cash by $1,000 and increases the advertising expense
amount by $1,000. This economic event affects both the assets portion of the
balance sheet and the operating expenses portion of the income statement.
And now — believe it or not — you’re ready to see how the mechanics of
double-entry bookkeeping work.
Talking mechanics
Roughly 500 years ago, an Italian monk named Pacioli devised a systematic
approach to keeping track of the increases and decreases in account bal-
ances. He said that increases in asset and expense accounts should be called
debits, whereas decreases in asset and expense accounts should be called
credits. He also said that increases in liabilities, owner’s equity, and revenue
accounts should be called credits, whereas decreases in liabilities, owner’s
equity, and revenue accounts should be called debits.
Table 2-3 summarizes the information that I just shared. Unfortunately —
and you can’t get around this — you need to memorize this table or dog-ear
the page so you can easily refer to it.

Using Pacioli’s debits and credits system, any transaction can be described
as a set of balancing debits and credits. Not only does this system work as
financial shorthand, but it also provides error checking. To get a better idea
of how this works, look at some simple examples.
Take the case of a $1,000 cash sale, for example. Using Pacioli’s system, or 
by using double-entry bookkeeping, you can record this transaction as
shown here:
Cash
$1,000
debit
Sales revenue
$1,000
credit

How Double-Entry Bookkeeping Works
36
See how that works? The $1,000 cash sale appears as both a debit to cash
(which means an increase in cash) and a $1,000 credit to sales (which means
a $1,000 increase in sales revenue). Debits equal credits, and that’s no accident.
The accounting model and Pacioli’s assignment of debits and credits mean that
any correctly recorded transaction balances. For a correctly recorded transac-
tion, the transaction’s debits equal the transaction’s credits.
Although you can show transactions as I’ve just shown the $1,000 cash sale,
you and I may just as well use the more orthodox nomenclature. By conven-
tion, accountants and bookkeepers show transactions, or what accountants
and bookkeepers call journal entries, like this one shown in Table 2-4.
Table 2-4
Journal Entry 1: Recording the Cash Sale
Account
Debit
Credit
Cash
1,000
Sales revenue
1,000
See how that works? Each account that’s affected by a transaction appears
on a separate line. Debits appear in the left column. Credits appear in the
right column.
You actually already understand how this account business works. You have
a checkbook. You use it to keep track of both the balance in your checking
account and the transactions that change the checking account balance. The
rules of double-entry bookkeeping essentially say that you are going to use a
similar record-keeping system not only for your cash account, but for every
other account you need to prepare your financial statements, too.
Here are a couple of other examples of how this transaction recording
works. In the first part of this discussion of how double-entry bookkeeping
works, I describe two other transactions: the purchase of $1,000 of inventory
for cash, and spending $1,000 in cash on advertising. Table 2-5 shows how
the purchase of $1,000 of inventory for cash appears. Table 2-6 shows how
spending $1,000 of cash on advertising appears.

By tallying the debits and credits to an account, you can calculate the
account balance. For example, suppose that before Journal Entries 1, 2, and
3, the cash balance equals $2,000. Journal Entry 1 increases cash by $1,000
(this is the debit). Journal Entries 2 and 3 decrease cash by $1,000 each
(these are the $2,000 credits). If you combine all these entries, you get the
new account balance. The following formula shows the calculation:
Beginning balance of cash
$2,000
Plus cash debit from Journal Entry 1

That darn bank
When I learned about double-entry bookkeep-
ing, I stumbled over the terms debit and credit.
The way I had heard the terms used before
didn’t agree with the way that double-entry
bookkeeping seemed to describe them. This
conflict caused a certain amount of confusion
for me. Because I don’t want you to suffer from
the same fate, let me quickly describe my initial
confusion.
If you look at Table 2-3, you see that an increase
in an asset account is a debit and a decrease
in an asset account is a credit. This means that
in the case of your cash account, increases to
cash are debits and decreases to cash are
credits.
However, you’ve undoubtedly talked at some
time to the bank and heard them refer to cred-
iting your bank account — which meant 
they increased the account balance. And they
perhaps talked about debiting your account —
which meant they decreased the account 
balance. So, what’s up with that? Am I wrong,
and is the bank right?
Actually, both the bank and I are right. And
here’s why. The bank is talking about debiting
and crediting — not a cash account and not an
asset account — but a liability account. To
them, the money that you’ve placed in the bank
is not cash (an asset) but a liability (money that
they owe you). If you look at Table 2-3, you see
that increases in a liability are credit amounts
and decreases in a liability are debit amounts.
Therefore, from the bank’s perspective, when
they increase the balance in your account, that
increase is a credit.
Your assets may represent another firm’s liabil-
ities. Your liabilities will represent another firm’s
assets. Therefore, whenever you hear some
other business talking about crediting or debit-
ing your account, what you do is exactly the
opposite. If they credit, you debit. If they debit,
you credit.

Ending cash balance
$1,000
Do you see how that works? You start with $2,000 as the cash account bal-
ance. The first cash debit of $1,000 increases the cash balance to $3,000, and
then the cash credit of $1,000 in Journal Entry 2 decreases the cash balance
to $2,000. Then, finally, the cash credit of $1,000 in Journal Entry 3 decreases
the cash balance to $1,000.
You can calculate the account balance for any account by taking the starting
account balance and then adding the debits and credits that have occurred
since then. By hand, this arithmetic is a little unwieldy. Your computer (with
the help of QuickBooks) does this math easily.
Almost a Real-Life Example
To cement the concepts that I’ve talked about in the preceding paragraphs
of this chapter, I want to quickly step through the journal entries, or book-
keeping transactions, that you would record in the case of the hot dog stand
business discussed in the preceding chapter. To start, you need to know that
the balance sheet shown in Table 2-2 is the balance sheet at the start of the
day. This means that the account balances in all the accounts appear as
shown in Table 2-7. This list of account balances is actually called a trial bal-
ance. It shows the debit or credit balance for each account.
I am assuming that no year-to-date revenues or expenses exist yet with the hot
dog stand business. In other words, the operation is just at a starting period.

Rent expense
Suppose that the first transaction to record is a $1,000 check written to pay
rent. In this case, the journal entry appears as shown in Table 2-8. In this
example, $1,000 is debited to rent expense, and $1,000 is credited to cash.

If you need to record $4,000 of wages expense, you use the journal entry
shown in Table 2-9. This journal entry debits wages expense for $4,000 and
credits cash for $4,000. In other words, you use $4,000 of cash to pay wages
for the hot dog stand business.

To record $1,000 of supplies expense paid for by writing a check, you record

This balance is one of the ways that double-entry bookkeeping prevents
errors.

Recording sales revenue
Suppose that you sell $13,000 worth of hot dogs. To record this transaction
in a journal entry, you debit cash for $13,000 and credit sales revenue for
$13,000, as shown in Table 2-11. I should tell you, however, that in the case of
the hot dog stand selling hot dogs for a dollar or two a piece, you can’t actu-
ally use a single journal entry to record sales revenue amounts. If you are
selling hot dogs at a dollar a dog, you may actually have 13,000 one-dollar
transactions. Each of these transactions debits cash for a dollar and credits
sales revenue for a dollar.
Table 2-11

Recording cost of goods sold
You must record the expense of the hot dogs and buns that you sell. You
must also record the fact that if you use up your inventory of hot dogs and
buns, your inventory balance has decreased. Table 2-12 shows how you
record this. Cost of goods sold gets debited for $3,000, and inventory gets
credited for $3,000.

If you’re confused about this cost of goods sold transaction — and it represents
the first transaction that doesn’t use cash — flip back to Book I, Chapter 1,
where I describe the two accounting principles. In short, these two princi-
ples go like this:
✦Expense principle: This principle says that an expense gets counted
when the item gets sold. This means that the inventory isn’t counted as
cost of goods sold or as an expense when it is purchased. Rather, the
expense of the hot dog and bun that you sell gets counted when the item
is actually sold to somebody.
✦Matching principle: This principle says that expenses or cost of a sale
get matched with the revenue of the sale. This means that you recognize
the cost of goods sold at the same time that you recognize the sale.
Typically, in fact, you can combine Journal Entry 7 and Journal Entry 8.

Book I
Chapter 2
Double-Entry
Bookkeeping
Almost a Real-Life Example
41
Another way to think about the information recorded in Journal Entry 8 is
this — rather than “spending” cash to provide customers with hot dogs and
buns, you spend inventory.
Recording the payoff of accounts payable
Suppose that one of the things you do at the end of the day is write a check
to pay off the accounts payable. The accounts payable are the amounts that
you owe vendors — probably the suppliers from whom you purchased the hot
dogs and buns. To record the payoff of accounts payable, you debit accounts
payable for $2,000 and credit cash for $2,000, as shown in Table 2-13.

Recording the payoff of a loan
Suppose also that you use cash profits from the day to pay off the $1,000
loan that the balance sheet shows (see Table 2-2). To record this transaction,
you debit loan payable for $1,000 and credit cash for $1,000, as shown in
Table 2-14.

Calculating account balance
You may already be able to guess this: If you know an account’s starting bal-
ance and have a way to add up the debits and the credits to the account, you
can easily calculate the ending account balance.
For example, take the case of the cash account balance of the hot dog stand
business. If you look at the balance sheet shown in Table 2-2, you see that
the beginning balance for cash is $1,000. You can easily construct a little
schedule of how the account balance changes — this is called a T-account —
that calculates the ending balance. In fact, Table 2-15 does just this. If you
look closely at Table 2-15, you see that the cash beginning balance is $1,000.
Then, on the following lines of the T-account, you see the effects of Journal

Almost a Real-Life Example
42
Entries 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 10. Some of these journal entries credit cash. Some of
them debit cash. You can calculate the ending cash balance by combining
the debit and credit amounts.

The information shown in Table 2-15 should make sense to you. But just in
case you’re still trying to memorize what debits and credits mean, I’m going
to give you a bit more detail. To calculate the ending balance shown in Table
2-15, you add up the debits, add up the credits, and combine the two sums.
The net amount in the cash account equals the $5,000 debit. If you recall
from the preceding paragraphs, a debit balance in an asset account, such as
cash, represents a positive amount. A $5,000 debit balance in the cash account,
therefore, indicates that you have $5,000 of cash in the account.
Cash is usually the trickiest account to analyze using a T-account because so
many journal entries affect cash. In many cases, however, a T-account analy-
sis of an account balance is much more straightforward. For example, if you
look at Table 2-16, you see a T-account analysis of the inventory account.
This T-account analysis shows that the beginning inventory account balance
equals $3,000. However, when Journal Entry 8 credits inventory for $3,000 —
this is the journal entry that records the cost of goods sold — the inventory
balance is wiped out.

Paying off the accounts payable and loan payable accounts is similarly straight-
forward. Table 2-17 shows the T-account analysis of the accounts payable
account. Table 2-18 shows the T-account analysis of the loan payable account.
In both cases, the T-account analysis shows that the liability accounts start
with a credit beginning balance. (Remember that a liability account would
have a credit balance if the firm really owed money.) Then, when the payments
are recorded to pay off the accounts payable and loan payable in Journal
Entries 9 and 10, the liability account is debited. The end result, in the case
of both accounts, is that the liability account balance is reduced to zero.

I’m not going to show T-account analyses of the other accounts that the pre-
ceding journal entries used. In every other case, the only debit or credit to
the account comes from the journal entry. This means that the journal entry
amount is the account balance. For example, only one journal entry affects
the sales revenue account — Journal Entry 7, which credits sales revenue for
$13,000. Because there is no beginning balance in the sales revenue account,
that $13,000 credit equals the sales revenue account balance. The expense
accounts work the same way.
Using T-account analysis results
If you or your accounting program constructs T-accounts for each balance
sheet and income statement account, you can easily calculate account bal-
ances at a particular point in time by using the T-account analysis results.
Table 2-19 shows a trial balance at the end of the day for the hot dog stand
business. Each of these account balances can be calculated by using T-account
analysis.

For example, the first line shown in the trial balance in Table 2-19 is the 
cash account with the debit balance of $5,000. This debit account balance
comes from the T-account analysis shown in Table 2-15. The account bal-
ances for inventory, accounts payable, and loan payable also come from the
T-account analyses shown previously in this chapter (Table 2-16, Table 2-17,
and Table 2-18).
As I noted in the preceding section, you don’t need to perform T-account
analyses for the other accounts shown in the trial balance provided in Table
2-19. These other accounts showed a single debit or credit.
One final and perhaps already obvious point needs to be made: The infor-
mation provided in Table 2-19 is the information necessary to construct an
income statement for the day and a balance sheet as of the end of the day.
For example, if you take sales revenue, cost of goods sold, rent, wages expense,
and supplies expense from the trial balance, you have all the information
that you need to construct an income statement for the day. In fact, the
information shown in Table 2-19 is the information used to construct the
income statement shown in Table 2-1.
Similarly, the asset, liability, and owner’s equity balance information shown
in the trial balance provided in Table 2-19 supplies the information neces-
sary to construct a balance sheet as of the end of the day.
The end of the day balance sheet won’t actually “balance” unless you also
include the profits of the day. These profits, either called retained earnings or
lumped into the owner’s capital account, equal $4,000. You can see what this

end-of-day balance sheet looks like by turning back to Book I, Chapter 1. In
that chapter, Table 1-7 shows the end-of-day balance sheet for the hot dog
stand business.
A Few Words about How QuickBooks Works
Before I end this chapter, I want to make just a few comments about how
QuickBooks helps you. First of all — and this may be the most important
point — QuickBooks makes most of these journal entries for you. For exam-
ple, in Journal Entry 6, I show you how to record a $1,000 check written to
pay supplies. However, you would never have to make this journal entry in
QuickBooks. When you use QuickBooks to record a $1,000 check that pays
Acme Supplies for some paper products that you purchased, QuickBooks
automatically debits supplies expense (as long as you indicate that the
check is for supplies) and then credits cash.
Similarly, in the case of Journal Entry 7 and Journal Entry 8, when you pro-
duce an invoice that records a sale, QuickBooks makes these journal entries
for you. For example, if you sold $13,000 of hot dogs and buns, and those hot
dogs and buns actually cost you $3,000, QuickBooks debits cash for $13,000,
credits sales revenue for $13,000, debits cost of goods sold for $3,000, and
credits inventory for $3,000. In other words, for most of your routine trans-
actions, QuickBooks handles the journal entries for you behind the scenes.
This doesn’t mean, however, that you can always avoid working with journal
entries. Any transaction that can’t be handled through a standard QuickBooks
form — such as the invoice form or the write checks form — must be recorded
by using a journal entry. For example, if you purchase some fixed asset by
writing a check, the purchase of the fixed asset gets recorded automatically
by QuickBooks. However, the depreciation that will be used to expense the
asset over its estimated economic life — something I talk a bit about in the
next chapter — must be recorded with journal entries that you construct
yourself and enter a different way.
One other really important point: I noted in the preceding paragraphs that
the trial balance information shown in Table 2-19 provides the raw data that
you need to prepare your financial statement. I don’t want to leave you with
a misunderstanding, however. You don’t actually have to take this sort of
raw data and prepare your financial statements. Predictably, QuickBooks
easily, quickly, and without effort builds your financial statements by using
this trial balance information.
Just to put these comments together, then, QuickBooks automatically creates
most journal entries for you, builds a trial balance by using journal entry

A Few Words about How QuickBooks Works
46
information, and — when asked — produces financial statements. Most of
the work of double-entry bookkeeping, then, goes on behind the scenes. You
don’t worry about many journal entries on a day-to-day basis. And if you
don’t want to ever see a trial balance, you don’t have to. In fact, if you just
use QuickBooks to produce invoices and to write checks that pay the bills,
almost all the information that you need to prepare your financial state-
ments gets collected automatically. So that’s really neat.
However, not all the information that is necessary for producing good accu-
rate financial statements gets collected automatically. You will encounter a
handful of important cases that should be handled on a special basis through
journal entries that either you or your CPA construct and enter.
In the next chapter, I describe some of the most common special cases.
However, it is likely that you’ll encounter other special cases. With the infor-
mation in this chapter, you may be able to figure out these journal entries
yourself. Or, you may need to pay someone else to help you figure them out.
Or, as a sometimes reasonable resort, you may just need to skip the extra
precision and accuracy that you can achieve by recording these journal
entries.

ven if you understand the principles of accounting (which I describe in
Book I, Chapter 1) and the basics of double-entry bookkeeping (which 
I describe in Book I, Chapter 2), you still may not have all the information
that you need to keep good records. For example, tracking the amounts that
customers owe you and the amounts that you owe vendors can be a bit
tricky. Inventory can also present challenging record-keeping problems, a
fact that’s not surprising to you retailers. And things like fixed assets — oh,
don’t even get me started.
For these reasons, this chapter describes the most common complexities
that business owners confront. You don’t need to be an accountant or an
experienced bookkeeper to understand the material in this chapter. However,
you do need to proceed carefully, take your time, and think a bit about how
the material I describe here applies to your specific business situation.
Working with Accounts Receivable
If you read Book I, Chapter 1, you already know that accounting principles
state that sales revenue needs to be recognized when a sale is made. And that
the sale is made when a business provides goods or services to a customer.
In other words — and this is really an important point — sales revenue
doesn’t get recorded when you receive payment from a customer. Sales 
revenue gets recorded when a customer has a legal obligation to pay you
because you have (or your business has) provided the customer with the
goods or services.

Working with Accounts Receivable
48
Recording a sale
This requirement to record sales revenue at the time that goods or services
are provided means that accounting for sales revenue is slightly more com-
plicated than you may have first guessed. The first transaction, for example,
the transaction that records a sale, is shown in Table 3-1.
Table 3-1
Journal Entry 1: Recording a Credit Sale
Account
Debit
Credit
Accounts receivable
1,000
Sales revenue
1,000
Journal Entry 1 shows how a $1,000 sale may be recorded. The journal entry
shows a $1,000 debit to accounts receivable and a $1,000 credit to sales rev-
enue. To record a $1,000 sale — a credit sale — the journal entry needs to
show both the $1,000 increase in accounts receivable and the $1,000 increase
in sales revenue.
Recording a payment
When the business receives payment from the customer for the $1,000
receivable, the business records a journal entry like that shown in Table 3-2.
Table 3-2
Journal Entry 2: Recording the Customer Payment
Account
Debit
Credit
Cash
1,000
Accounts receivable
1,000
Journal Entry 2 shows a $1,000 debit to cash, which is the $1,000 increase in
the cash account that occurs because the customer has just paid you $1,000.
Journal Entry 2 also shows a $1,000 credit to accounts receivable. This credit
to the accounts receivable asset account reduces the accounts receivable
balance.
At the point when you record both Journal Entry 1 and Journal Entry 2, the
net effect is a $1,000 debit to cash, showing that the cash has increased by
$1,000, and a $1,000 credit to sales revenue, showing that sales revenue has
increased by $1,000. The $1,000 debit to accounts receivable and the $1,000
credit to accounts receivable net to zero.
If you think about this accounts receivable business a bit, you should realize
that it makes sense. Although the accounts receivable account includes a
$1,000 receivable balance, this just means that the customer owes you

Book I
Chapter 3
Special Accounting
Problems
Working with Accounts Receivable
49
$1,000. But when the customer finally pays off the $1,000 bill, you need to
zero out that receivable.
QuickBooks, by the way, automatically records Journal Entry 1 and Journal
Entry 2 for you. Journal Entry 1 gets recorded whenever you issue or create
a customer invoice. Therefore, you don’t need to worry about the debits and
credits shown in Journal Entry 1 except for one special occasion: When you
set up QuickBooks and QuickBooks items (items are things that get included
on the invoices), you do specify which account should be credited to track
sales revenue. So, although you may not need to worry much about the
mechanics of Journal Entry 1, you should understand how this journal entry
works so that you can set up QuickBooks correctly.
Book II, Chapter 1 describes the mechanics of setting up QuickBooks.
Journal Entry 2 also gets recorded automatically by QuickBooks. QuickBooks
records Journal Entry 2 for you whenever you record a cash payment from a
customer. You don’t need to worry, then, about the debits and credits neces-
sary for recording customer payments. However, I find that it’s helpful to
understand how this journal entry works and how QuickBooks records this
customer payment transaction.
Estimating bad debt expense
One other important journal entry to understand is shown in Table 3-3.
Table 3-3
Journal Entry 3: Recording an Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts
Account
Debit
Credit
Bad debt expense
100
Allowance for uncollectible A/R
100
Journal Entry 3 records an estimate of the uncollectible portion of accounts
receivable. (Businesses that don’t want to keep accrual-based accounting
statements may not need to worry about Journal Entry 3.) Unfortunately,
some of the money you bill customers may be uncollectible. Yet Journal
Entry 1 records every dollar that you bill your customers as revenue.
Therefore, you need a way to offset, or reduce, some of the sales revenue 
by the amount that ultimately turns out to be uncollectible.
Journal Entry 3 shows a common way of doing this. Journal Entry 3 debits bad
debt expense — which is an expense account that you may use to record
uncollectible customer receivables. Journal Entry 3 also credits another
account shown as allowance for uncollectible A/R. This allowance account is
called a contra-asset account, which means it basically reduces the balance

Working with Accounts Receivable
50
reported on the balance sheet of an asset account. In the case of the allowance
for uncollectible A/R accounts, for example, this $100 credit reduces the
accounts receivable balance shown on the balance sheet by $100.
Where the bad debt expense shown in Journal Entry 3 appears varies from
business to business. Some businesses report the bad debt expense with the
other sales revenue, thereby allowing the income statement to show net
sales revenue. Other businesses report bad debt expense with the other
operating expenses. You should report bad debt expense wherever it makes
most sense in terms of managing your business.
QuickBooks doesn’t automatically record the transaction in Journal Entry 3.
You record estimates of bad debt expense yourself by using the QuickBooks
Make Journal Entries command.
Removing uncollectible accounts receivable
If you do set up an allowance for uncollectible accounts, you also need to
periodically remove the uncollectible accounts from both the accounts
receivable balance and the allowance for uncollectible accounts. You don’t
want to do this while any chance exists to collect on the accounts. But at
some point, obviously, you may as well clean out the bad receivables from
your records. It makes no sense, for example, to have uncollectible receiv-
ables from 17 years ago still appearing on your balance sheet. Table 3-4 illus-
trates how to clean out bad receivables.
Table 3-4
Journal Entry 4: Writing Off an Uncollectible Receivable
Account
Debit
Credit
Allowance for uncollectible
100
Accounts receivable
100
This journal entry debits the allowance from the uncollectible A/R account
for $100. The journal entry also credits the accounts receivable account for
$100. In combination, these two entries zero out the allowance for the uncol-
lectible A/R account and remove the uncollectible amount from the accounts
receivable account.
Writing off an actual, specific uncollectible receivable for invoice should be
done on a case-by-case basis. This is what Journal Entry 4 shows.
None of these entries is particularly tricky as long as you understand the
logic — something I hope I have illuminated for you in this discussion. If you
do have trouble with these journal entries or with recording the economic
events that they attempt to summarize, you may want to consult your CPA.

Recording Accounts Payable Transactions
51
Most likely, you would record these same transactions (of course, with dif-
ferent customers and amounts) many, many times over the year. If you can
get a bit of help or a template that shows you how to record these transac-
tions, you should be able to record them yourself without any outside help.
In order to write off an uncollectible account receivable, you record a credit
memo and then apply the credit memo to the uncollectible account. The
item shown on your credit memo should cause the allowance for uncol-
lectible accounts to be debited.
Recording Accounts Payable Transactions
Within QuickBooks, you have the option of either working with or without 
an accounts payable account. If you want to, you can record expenses when
you write checks. This means that in order to have a complete list of all your
expenses, you must have recorded checks that pay all your expenses. This
approach works fine — and, in fact, is the approach that I have always used
in my businesses.
QuickBooks also supports a more precise approach of recording expenses.
By answering a few questions during the QuickBooks setup process, you can
set up an accounts payable account, which is just an account that tracks the
amounts that you owe your vendors and other suppliers.
Recording a bill
When you use an accounts payable account, you enter the bills that you get
from vendors when you receive them.
Table 3-5 shows the way this transaction is recorded. Journal Entry 5 auto-
matically debits office supplies expense for $1,000 and credits accounts
payable for $1,000. This is the journal entry that would be recorded by
QuickBooks if you purchased $1,000 of office supplies and then entered that
bill into the QuickBooks system.
Table 3-5

When you later pay that bill, QuickBooks records Journal Entry 6, shown in
Table 3-6. In Journal Entry 6, QuickBooks debits accounts payable for $1,000

and credits cash for $1,000. The net effect on accounts payable combining
both the purchase and the payment is zero. That makes sense, right? The
approach shown in Journal Entries 5 and 6 counts the amount that you owe
some vendor or supplier as a liability, accounts payable, only while you owe
the money.
Table 3-6

Account
Debit
Credit

When you record Journal Entry 5 in QuickBooks, you must supply the name
of the account that gets debited. QuickBooks obviously knows which account
to credit — the accounts payable account. However, QuickBooks also has to
know the expense or asset account to debit.
QuickBooks does need to know which cash account to credit when you pay
an accounts payable amount. You identify this when you write the check to
pay the bill.
Some other accounts payable pointers
Let me make a couple of additional points about Journal Entries 5 and 6:
✦The accounts payable method is more accurate. The accounts payable
method, which is what Journal Entries 5 and 6 show, is the best way to
record your bills. The accounts payable method means that you record
expenses when the expenses actually occur. As you may have already
figured out, the accounts payable method is really the mirror image of
the accounts receivable approach described in the early paragraphs of
this chapter. The big benefit of the accounts payable method, as you
may intuit, is that it keeps track of the amounts that you owe vendors
and suppliers and it recognizes expenses as they occur rather than
when you pay them (which may be some time later).
✦Not every debit is for an expense. Journal Entry 5 shows the debit
going to an office supplies expense account. Many of the accounts
payable that you record are amounts owed for expenses. However, not
every accounts payable transaction stems from incurring some expense.
You may also need to record the purchase of an asset — such as a piece
of equipment. In this case, the debit goes not to an expense account but
to an asset account. Other than this minor change, however, the transac-
tion works in the same way. I describe how fixed asset accounting works
later in this chapter in the “Accounting for Fixed Assets” section.

Book I
Chapter 3
Special Accounting
Problems
Inventory Accounting
53
Can you guess how an expense or fixed asset purchase gets recorded if you
don’t use an accounts payable account? In the case where you paid $1,000
for office supplies, QuickBooks debits office supplies expense for $1,000 and
credits cash for $1,000 when you write a $1,000 check. As part of writing the
check, you identify which expense account to debit.
If you are purchasing a $1,000 piece of equipment, the journal entry looks
and works in roughly the same way. When you record the purchase,
QuickBooks debits the asset account for $1,000 and credits cash for $1,000.
Again, this transaction gets recorded when you write the check to pay for
the asset.
Inventory Accounting
Thankfully, most of the inventory accounting that goes on in a business gets
handled automatically by QuickBooks. For example, when you purchase an
inventory item by writing a check or recording an accounts payable bill,
QuickBooks automatically adjusts your inventory accounts both for the
dollar value of the inventory and the quantity of the items. When you sell an
inventory item to a customer, QuickBooks again automatically adjusts the
dollar value of your inventory and adjusts the quantity accounts of the items
you sell.
Basically, all this means that QuickBooks maintains a perpetual inventory
system — an inventory system that lets you know at any time what quantity
of items you have in inventory and what value your inventory amounts to.
(In the past, smaller firms often used a periodic inventory system, which
meant that business owners never really knew with any precision the dollar
value of their inventory or the quantity counts for the inventory items that
they held.)
Although everything in the preceding paragraph represents good news, 
several inventory-related headaches do require a bit of accounting magic.
Specifically, if your firm carries inventory, you need to know how to deal with
obsolete inventory, disposal of obsolete inventory, and inventory shrinkage. 
I discuss all three accounting gambits in the following paragraphs.
Dealing with obsolete inventory
Obsolete inventory refers to items that you’ve purchased for sale but turn
out not to be saleable. Perhaps customers no longer want it. Perhaps you
have too much of the inventory item and will never be able to sell everything
that you hold.

Inventory Accounting
54
In either case, you record the fact that your inventory value is actually less
than what you purchased it for. And you want to record the fact that, really,
the money you spent on the obsolete item is an expense. For example, sup-
pose that you purchased some $100 item that you now realize is obsolete.
How do you record this obsolescence? Table 3-7 shows the conventional
approach.
Table 3-7
Journal Entry 7: Recording an Allowance for Obsolete Inventory
Account
Debit
Credit
Inventory obsolescence
100
Allowance for obsolete inventory
100
As Journal Entry 7 shows, to record the obsolescence of a $100 inventory
item, you first debit an expense account called something like “inventory
obsolescence” for $100. Then, you credit a contra-asset account named
something like “allowance for obsolete inventory” for $100. As I mention in
the discussion of accounts receivable, a contra-asset account gets reported
on the balance sheet immediately beneath the asset account to which it
relates. The contra-asset account, with its negative credit balance, reduces
the net reported value of the asset account. For example, if the inventory
account balance was $3,100 and you had an allowance for an obsolete inven-
tory contra-asset account of $100, the net inventory balance shows as
$3,000. In other words, the contra-asset account gets subtracted from the
related asset account.
QuickBooks requires you to record Journal Entry 7 yourself using the Make
Journal Entries command.
When you ultimately do dispose of obsolete inventory, you record a journal
entry like the one shown in Table 3-8. This journal entry debits the contra-
asset account for $100 and credits inventory for $100. In other words, this
journal entry removes the value of the obsolete inventory both from the
allowance for obsolete inventory account and from the inventory account
itself. You record this journal entry when you actually physically dispose of
the inventory. This may be, for example, when you pay the junk man to haul
away the inventory or when you toss the inventory out into the large
Dumpster behind your office or factory.

Inventory Accounting
55
In general, one of the things you should do every year for tax accounting rea-
sons is deal with your obsolete inventory. The tax rules generally state that
you can’t write off obsolete inventory unless you actually dispose of it for
income purposes. You can, however, typically write down inventory to its
liquidation value. Such a write-down works the same way as a write-down for
obsolete inventory. A write-down can be a little tricky if you have never done
it before, however, so you may want to confer with your tax advisor.
One more really important point about recording disposal of obsolete inven-
tory: Within QuickBooks, you record inventory disposal by adjusting the
physical item count of the inventory items. I describe how adjusting the phys-
ical inventory accounts works in Book III, Chapter 3. So even though I won’t
go down that path here, you should know that you don’t actually enter a jour-
nal entry like the one shown in Journal Entry 8. You adjust the inventory
accounts for the obsolete inventory. This adjustment would automatically
reduce the inventory account balance. When QuickBooks asks you which
account to debit, you specify the allowance for obsolete inventory account.
Why not just credit the asset account?
If you are really getting into this double-entry
bookkeeping, you may wonder why you don’t
just credit the inventory account in the case of
something like obsolete inventory. Wouldn’t
that save you time and trouble? Well, yes 
and no.
Simply crediting the inventory account does
make sense. Such an approach saves you the
task of having to set up a goofy contra-asset
account. However, accountants have con-
cluded over the centuries that it makes sense
to keep a record of your obsolete inventory as
long as you own it. There are a bunch of differ-
ent reasons for this, but one reason is that you
want to know what inventory you need to get
rid of or dispose of.
It’s not necessary to set up some sort of sepa-
rate system for keeping track of obsolete inven-
tory. By using the contra-asset account, you
can continue to store information about your
inventory in the accounting system without
making the balance sheet information and
income statement information incorrect.
This logic applies to other contra-asset
accounts, too. For example, previously in this
chapter, I describe how to set up a contra-
asset account for uncollectible accounts
receivable. The business about wanting to have
some record of your uncollectible accounts
receivable — perhaps so you know you don’t
want to deal with those customers again —
means that you may as well keep this informa-
tion in the accounting system. A contra-asset
account allows you to do so and at the same
time not have the presence of uncollectible
receivables overstate your accounts receiv-
able balance.

Inventory Accounting
56
Dealing with inventory shrinkage
The other chronic inventory headache that many business owners and busi-
ness managers have to deal with is inventory shrinkage. It’s very likely,
sometimes for the most innocent reasons, that your inventory records over-
state the quantity counts of items. When this happens, you must adjust your
records. Essentially, you want to reduce both the dollar value of your inven-
tory and the quantity counts of your inventory items.
Table 3-9 shows the journal entry that QuickBooks makes for you to record
this event. This journal entry debits an appropriate expense account — in
Journal Entry 9, I call the expense account shrinkage expense — for $100. A
journal entry also needs to credit the inventory account for $100.
Table 3-9
Journal Entry 9: Recording Inventory Shrinkage
Account
Debit
Credit
Shrinkage expense

Inventory
100
Within QuickBooks, as I mentioned, you don’t actually record a formal jour-
nal entry like the one shown here. You use something called a physical count
worksheet to adjust the quantities of your inventory item counts to whatever
they actually are. When you make this adjustment, QuickBooks automati-
cally credits the inventory account balance and adjusts the quantity counts.
QuickBooks also requires you to supply the expense account that it should
debit for the shrinkage.
In the old days (by the “old days,” I mean a few decades ago), businesses com-
pared their accounting records to the physical counts of inventory items only
once a year. In fact, the annual inventory physical count was a painful ritual
that many distributors and retailers went through. These days, I think, most
businesses have found that it works much better to stage physical inventory
counts throughout the year. This approach, called cycle counting, means that
you’re probably comparing your accounting records with physical counts for
your most valuable items several times a year. For your moderately valuable
items, you’re probably comparing your inventory accounting records with
physical counts once or twice a year. With your least valuable inventory items,
you probably only irregularly compare inventory records with physical
counts, and you may accept a degree of imprecision. For example, rather than
counting screws in some bin, you may weigh the bin and then make an esti-
mate of the screw count. In any case, you want some system that allows you to
compare your accounting records to your physical counts. Inventory shrink-
age and inventory obsolescence represent real costs of doing business that
won’t get recorded in your accounting records in any other way.

Accounting for Fixed Assets
57
Accounting for Fixed Assets
Fixed assets are those items that you can’t immediately count as an expense
when purchased. Fixed assets include such things as vehicles, furniture,
equipment, and so forth. Fixed assets are tricky for two reasons: Typically,
you must depreciate fixed assets (more on that in a bit), and you need to
record the disposal of the fixed asset at some point in the future — for either
a gain or for a loss.
Purchasing a fixed asset
Accounting for the purchase of a fixed asset is pretty straightforward. 
Table 3-10 shows how a fixed asset purchase typically looks:
Table 3-10
Journal Entry 10: Recording Fixed Asset Purchase
Account
Debit
Credit
Delivery truck
12,000
Cash
12,000
If you purchase a $12,000 delivery truck with cash, for example, the journal
entry that you use to record this purchase debits delivery truck for $12,000
and credits cash for $12,000.
Within QuickBooks, this journal entry actually gets made when you write the
check to pay for the purchase. The one thing that you absolutely must do is
set up a fixed asset account for the specific asset. In other words, you don’t
want to debit a general catch-all fixed asset account. If you buy a delivery
truck, you set up a fixed asset account for that specific delivery truck. If you
buy a computer system, you set up a fixed asset account for that particular
computer system. In fact, the general rule is that any fixed asset that you
buy individually or dispose of later individually needs its own asset account.
The reason for this is that if you don’t have individual fixed asset accounts,
later on, the job of calculating gains and losses on the disposal of the fixed
asset turns into a Herculean task.
Dealing with depreciation
Depreciation is an accounting gimmick to recognize the expense of using a
fixed asset over a period of time. Although you may not be all that familiar
with the mechanics of depreciation, you probably do understand the logic.
For the sake of illustration, suppose that you bought a $12,000 delivery
truck. Suppose also that because you know how to do your own repair work
and take excellent care of your vehicles, you will be able to use this truck for
ten years. Further suppose that at the end of the ten years, the truck will

probably have a $2,000 salvage value (your best guess). Depreciation says that
if you buy something for $12,000 and that you can later sell it for $2,000, that
decrease in value can be apportioned to expense. In this case, the $10,000
decrease in value is counted as expense over ten years. That expense is called
depreciation.
Accountants and tax accounting laws use a variety of methods to apportion
the cost of using an asset over the years in which it’s used. A common
method is called straight-line depreciation. Straight-line depreciation divides
the decrease in value by the number of years that an asset is used. An asset
that decreases $10,000 over ten years, for example, produces $1,000 a year
of depreciation expense.
To record depreciation, you use a journal entry like the one shown in 
Table 3-11.
Table 3-11
Journal Entry 11: Recording Fixed Asset Depreciation
Account
Debit
Credit
Depreciation expense
1,000
Acc. dep. — Delivery truck
1,000
Journal Entry 11 debits an expense account called “depreciation expense”
for $1,000. Journal Entry 11 also credits a contra-asset account called “accu-
mulated depreciation — delivery truck” for $1,000. (By convention, because
the phrase “accumulated depreciation” is so long, accountants and book-
keepers usually abbreviate it as “acc. dep.”) Note also that you need specific
individual accumulated depreciation contra-asset accounts for each specific
individual fixed asset account. You don’t want to lump all your accumulated
depreciation together into a single catch-all account. That way lies madness
and ruin.
Disposing of a fixed asset
The final wrinkle of fixed asset accounting concerns disposal of a fixed asset
for a gain or for a loss. When you ultimately sell a fixed asset or trade it in or
discard it because it’s now junk, you record any gain or loss on the disposal
of the asset. You also remove the fixed asset from your accounting records.
To show you how this works, consider again the example of the $12,000
delivery truck. Suppose that you’ve owned and operated this truck for two
years. Over that time, you’ve depreciated $2,000 of the truck’s original pur-
chase price. Further suppose that you are going to sell the truck for $11,000
in cash. Table 3-12 shows the journal entry that you would make in order to
record this disposal.

The first component of Journal Entry 12 shows the $12,000 credit of the
delivery truck asset. This makes sense, right? You remove the delivery truck
from your fixed asset amounts by crediting the account for the same amount
that you originally debited the account when you purchased the asset.
The next component of the journal entry shows the $11,000 debit to cash.
This component, again, is pretty straightforward. It shows the cash that you
receive by selling the asset.
Choosing a depreciation method
Straight-line depreciation, which I’ve illustrated
here, makes for a good example in a book. It’s
easy to understand and to illustrate. However,
most accountants and business owners use
more complicated depreciation methods for a
variety of reasons. One of the most important
reasons is that tax accounting laws generally
allow for depreciation methods that accelerate
tax deductions.
You can figure out the annual depreciation
according to one of these tax-based deprecia-
tion methods with your tax advisor’s help.
Different rules apply to different types of
assets. The rules that you use for a particular
asset depend on when you originally purchase
the asset. I recommend that you use the same
asset depreciation method in QuickBooks that
you use for your tax accounting. Depreciation
is complicated enough as it is. You don’t want
to be using one method of depreciation within
QuickBooks for your own internal financial
management and another method for your tax
returns.
While I am on the subject of depreciation, I
should also mention that many small firms have
the option of using something called a Section
179 election. (Section 179 is a chunk of law in
the Internal Revenue Code.) A Section 179 elec-
tion allows many businesses to immediately
depreciate 100% of the cost of many of their
fixed assets at the time of purchase. Despite
the fact that a Section 179 election means that
you can immediately write off the purchase of,
for example, a $24,000 vehicle at the time of
purchase, you still want to treat fixed assets
expensed via a Section 179 election the way I
describe here. The difference is that you’ll
immediately show the asset as fully depreci-
ated — which means depreciated down to its
salvage value or down to zero.

Recognizing Liabilities
60
The third component of the journal entry backs out the accumulated depre-
ciation. If you depreciated the truck $1,000 a year for two years, the accumu-
lated depreciation contra-asset account for the truck should equal $2,000. To
remove this accumulated depreciation from your balance sheet, you debit
the accumulated depreciation account for $2,000.
The final piece of the disposal journal entry is a plug, a calculated amount.
You know the amount and whether that amount is a debit or credit by look-
ing at the other accounts affected. For example, in the case of Journal Entry
12, you know that a $1,000 credit is necessary to balance the journal entry.
Debits must equal credits.
A credit is a gain. A credit is essentially revenue, as you may remember from
the discussion on double-entry bookkeeping in Book I, Chapter 2.
If the plug was a debit amount, the disposal produces a loss. This makes
sense; a loss is like an expense and expenses are debits.
If you are confused about the gain component of Journal Entry 12, let me
make this observation. Over the two years of use, the business depreciated
the truck by $2,000. In other words, the business, through the depreciation
expense, said that the truck lost $2,000 of value. If, however, the $12,000
delivery truck is sold two years later for $11,000, the loss in value doesn’t
equal $2,000. The loss in value equals $1,000. The $1,000 gain, essentially,
recaptures the unnecessary, extra depreciation that was incorrectly charged.
You can enter both Journal Entries 11 and 12 as journal entries within
QuickBooks using the Make Journal Entries command.
Recognizing Liabilities
Liabilities are amounts that a business owes to other parties. For example, if
a business owes a bank money because of a loan, that’s a liability. If a busi-
ness owes an employee wages or benefits, that’s a liability. If a business
owes the federal, state, or local government taxes, those are liabilities.
Borrowing money
Liabilities, fortunately, aren’t that tricky to record after you’ve seen how the
journal entries look. Table 3-13, for example, shows how you record money
borrowed on a loan. In the case of a $10,000 loan, for example, you would
debit cash for $10,000 and credit a loan payable liability account for $10,000.

Sometimes, you may purchase an asset with a loan. Suppose, for example,
that you purchased $10,000 of furniture by using a note payable or a loan.
Even though there is no immediate cash effect, you still record the transac-
tion. Table 3-14 shows how you record this transaction. A furniture account
gets debited for $10,000, and a loan payable account gets credited for $10,000.
Table 3-14

You can record Journal Entry 13 directly into your checkbook when you
record the $10,000 cash deposit. You can also record Journal Entry 13, as
well as Journal Entry 14, by using the Make Journal Entries command that
QuickBooks provides. Journal Entry 14, by the way, can only be recorded by
using the Make Journal Entries command.
Making a loan payment
To record the payment on a loan, you or QuickBooks makes a journal entry
like the one shown in Table 3-15. For example, suppose that in connection
with the loan shown in Journal Entry 13, you need to pay $2,200. Suppose
that this amount is for $1,200 of loan interest and $1,000 of principal. In this
case, you debit loan payable for $1,000, debit loan interest expense for
$1,200, and credit cash for $2,200.
Table 3-15

Sometimes, the tricky thing about loan payments is breaking the payment
amount into its principal and interest components. Hopefully, the lender will
provide you with an amortization schedule that breaks down payments into
principal and interest.

Recognizing Liabilities
62
If a lender doesn’t provide such an amortization schedule, you can calculate
the interest expense yourself by using either a spreadsheet or a calculator. (I
also have some free amortization schedules available at my Web site: www.
stephenlnelson.com.) Then, after you have calculated the interest expense,
you can deduce the principal component by subtracting the interest from the
payment amount.
Accruing liabilities
I want to show you one other liability-related journal entry. Very commonly,
a business owes money for some goods or services or taxes that must be
recorded in the accounting system. For example, if at the end of an account-
ing period — say at the end of the year — you owe $1,200 of interest on
some loan, you really need to record that interest expense in your account-
ing system. For example, you want to record the fact that, although the loan
balance may show as $10,000 in your accounting records, you probably
really owe $11,200 because you owe both the $10,000 of principal and $1,200
of accrued interest.
To accrue a liability, you use a journal entry like the one shown in Table 3-16.
This journal entry shows the accrual of $1,200 of interest expense on a loan
payable.
Table 3-16
Journal Entry 16: Accruing a Liability
Account
Debit
Credit
Loan interest expense
1,200
Loan interest payable
1,200
The journal entry shows a $1,200 debit to loan interest expense and a $1,200
credit to loan interest payable. This journal entry records amounts that you
owe as of the end of the accounting period that don’t get recorded in some
other way.
You need to be careful about using journal entries like the one shown in
Journal Entry 16. Typically, you want to use such journal entries when it’s
very important to count all your expenses and to accurately measure all
your liabilities.
One common situation when you want to be especially careful about making
such accruals is if you sell your firm. Any prospective purchaser wants to
have not only a very good estimate of your true expenses for the accounting
period, but the purchaser also wants a very accurate estimate of liabilities at
the point in time that the business is being evaluated.

Book I
Chapter 3
Special Accounting
Problems
Recognizing Liabilities
63
Liability accruals like the one shown in Journal Entry 16 present the account-
ant or bookkeeper with a problem, however. To return to the example of the
accrued interest shown in Journal Entry 16, suppose that at a later point in
time, the business makes a $3,000 payment, which includes the interest
accrued in Journal Entry 16. When the accountant or bookkeeper later records
this loan payment, he or she must remember or recognize the earlier journal
entry. You don’t want the accountant or bookkeeper to double-count interest
expense by again recording the same interest. This makes sense, right?
Because accountants and bookkeepers can’t reliably remember these sorts
of accrual entries — they may need to recall them months later — they typi-
cally back out the effect of the accrual from the first day of the new account-
ing period.
For example, if Journal Entry 16 were recorded at the end of year 1 to accu-
rately estimate interest expense and liability balances, an accountant or
bookkeeper could, on the first day of year 2, enter a reversing journal entry.
This reversing journal entry would credit loan interest expense for $1,200
and debit loan interest payable for $1,200. In other words, this reversing
journal entry reverses the earlier accrual. Because the accrual entry is still
in year 1, however, year 1’s estimates of interest expense and liability
account balances are still correct.
Table 3-17 shows how a reversing entry looks. Again, notice that it’s simply
the mirror image of Journal Entry 16. The debits and credits are flip-flopped.
Table 3-17

Account
Debit
Credit
Loan interest expense

When the actual loan interest payment is made, the journal entry appears as
though no accrual or reversal ever existed. Table 3-18 shows this. For exam-
ple, suppose that at some time in year 2 the business pays $1,800 of interest
by making a cash payment. Journal Entry 18 shows how this transaction gets
recorded.

Let me just quickly summarize what happens with Journal Entries 16, 17, 
and 18:
✦Journal Entry 16 enables you to show that, at the end of year 1, the busi-
ness owes $1,200 of interest on a loan — even though that interest hasn’t
yet been paid. Journal Entry 16 also shows that even though the money
wasn’t paid, loan interest expense of $1,200 was incurred.
✦Journal Entries 17 and 18 need to be combined to be understood.
Journal Entry 17, for example, reduces the loan interest payable to zero.
Remember that the loan interest payable would be a balance sheet liabil-
ity account. The combination of the $1,200 debit and credit zero this
account out. The $1,200 credit to loan interest expense in Journal Entry
17 must be combined with the $1,800 debit to loan interest expense in
Journal Entry 18. This seems funny because after all, aren’t you really
paying $1,800 of interest? That’s true. But looking back at Journal Entry
16, you can see that you have already recorded $1,200 of loan interest
expense. That interest expense has been recorded for year 1 in this
example. If you have $1,800 of loan interest in total, what’s left over for
year 2 is the remaining $600. The combination of the $1,200 credit to
loan interest expense and the $1,800 debit to loan interest expense pro-
duces this $600 of loan interest expense. The only other component of
these two journal entries is the $1,800 credit to cash. This credit to cash
represents just the actual cash payment that is made to pay the loan
interest amount.
You need to be careful when working with accrual entries, reversing entries,
and then the real entries that follow and correct everything in the end. These
tools can be enormously helpful when it’s important to accurately measure
expenses and liabilities. However, you must remember to complete the entire
sequence of transactions; you can’t stop halfway.
One last important point — in Journal Entries 16, 17, and 18, I talk about how
to accrue loan interest expense. This accrual technique can be used to rec-
ognize any liability, a fact that I want to emphasize here. You can use the
technique demonstrated in these journal entries to deal with liabilities for
things such as wages owed to employees, taxes owed to the government,
and so forth.
Some firms, particularly those with sophisticated accounting systems, can
even use this technique to record hard-to-quantify liabilities, such as a war-
ranty liability. (A warranty is a promise that you make to a customer; for
example, you promise that your product won’t break.) These promises
create liabilities and expenses. An accurate accounting system requires that
you record these expenses as they occur and recognize these liabilities as
they come into existence.

Closing Out Revenue and Expense Accounts

Closing Out Revenue and Expense Accounts
You’re about to enter the twilight zone of accounting. In this section, I talk
about what happens to revenue and expense accounts at the end of the year
in traditional manual accounting systems. And then I explain why QuickBooks
doesn’t quite work that way, and what you need to do about it.
If you want to skip anything in this chapter, this is probably the material. On
the other hand, if you (like me) have a compulsive personality and deem it
essential to read everything in this chapter (even stuff that’s not particularly
exciting), read on.
Book I, Chapters 1 and 2 describe an imaginary hot dog stand business. This
is a one-day business that, in my imagination, you operate. (If you’ve been
reading through this chapter and have no questions, you don’t even need to
worry about Chapters 1 and 2.) Table 3-19 shows the trial balance for this
business at the end of the day of operation.

The traditional close
As you, I hope, already know, revenue and expense accounts count revenue
and expenses for a particular period of time. For example, revenue and
expense accounts may count for the month, the quarter, or the year.
One of the things that accounting systems traditionally do is zero out the
revenue and expense accounts at the end of the year. This makes sense if
you think about it a bit. You want your counters reset at the beginning of the

Closing Out Revenue and Expense Accounts
66
year, so counting the new year’s revenues and the new year’s expenses is
easy. In the case of a trial balance like the one shown in Table 3-19, for exam-
ple, you would typically make the journal entry shown in Table 3-20.
Table 3-20

If you look at Journal Entry 19, for example, you see that the first line in the
journal entry is a $13,000 debit for sales revenue. If you look back at the trial
balance shown in Table 3-19, you see that sales revenue has a $13,000 credit
balance. The combination of the account balance shown in Table 3-19 and
the closing entry shown in Journal Entry 19 effectively zeros out the sales
revenue account.
The same sort of accounting magic occurs for each of the other expense
accounts shown in the trial balance. The cost of the goods sold balance is
equal to a $3,000 debit in Table 3-19 and is zeroed out in Journal Entry 19
with a $3,000 credit. And so it goes.
The QuickBooks close
The sort of accounting taught at local community colleges makes just the
sort of closing entry shown in Journal Entry 19. However, you actually don’t
need or even want to make such a closing entry within QuickBooks.
The closing entry shown in Journal Entry 19 gets made in a manual system
so that the revenue and expense accounts can be reset to zero. In compari-
son, QuickBooks, relying on the power of the computer, doesn’t need to have
these accounts reset to zero in order to correctly calculate the revenue and
expense for the new accounting period. QuickBooks, as you will learn
throughout this book, can calculate revenue or sales for any period and for
any interval of time by using its report generation tool to summarize rev-
enues and expenses that occur within a particular time interval.
This seemingly missed step doesn’t cause any idiosyncratic behavior on the
part of QuickBooks. QuickBooks lumps the revenue and expenses from all
the previous years into a retained earnings amount reported on the balance

sheet. Net income for the current year is also reported in the equity portion
of the balance sheet. In addition, if you have a corporation, QuickBooks typi-
cally includes a dividends paid account in the equity portion of the balance
sheet. I’m getting ahead of myself, however.
The main thing that I want you to know is that this seemingly critical text-
book journal entry for closing out revenue and expense accounts isn’t made
within QuickBooks. This is okay, because QuickBooks doesn’t need to make
the traditional closing entry.
You may want to ask your accountant about this. By convention, however,
any dividends paid by a corporation are typically zeroed out or combined
with retained earnings at the end of the year. If you want to combine divi-
dends paid for the current year with accumulative retained earnings, you 
do this with a journal entry. The journal entry credits the dividends paid
account and debits retained earnings for the amount of dividends paid for
the year. I hesitate to encourage you to make this journal entry willy-nilly,
however. I think it’s okay to skip making the entry. And before you make it,
consult your tax advisor.
One More Thing . . .
In this chapter, I tried to address any of the common, complicated journal
entries or accounting transactions that business owners encounter. I know I
can’t answer every question here, but I do want to provide as thorough a set
of instructions as possible. All this is leading up to a special request. If
you’ve read through this chapter and didn’t find a discussion of the sort of
journal entry or accounting transaction that you need to record, send me an
e-mail or write me a letter that tells me what help you hoped to find here . . .
but didn’t.
I can’t promise you that I’ll be able to supply an answer. But if you describe 
a journal entry that I should have included, I’ll try to respond to your e-mail
with instructions on how to make the journal entry. I’ll also include a descrip-
tion of the journal entry in the next edition of this book.
If you want to reach me, you can write me a letter in care of the publisher
(the publisher’s address is in the front of this book). You can also send me
an e-mail message; you can find my e-mail address and other contact infor-
mation at www.stephenlnelson.com. (Please note that during tax season,
I, unfortunately, cannot respond to reader inquiries.)

n order to use QuickBooks, you need to do two things: install the
QuickBooks software and run the setup interview, which is called the
EasyStep Interview. This chapter gives a bird’s-eye view of both of these
tasks. I also want to spend just a few paragraphs talking about some of the
planning that you should do before you set up QuickBooks, and some of the
missing setup steps in the EasyStep Interview — things it should do but
doesn’t. (Don’t worry: I tell you how to complete the missing steps — partly
at the end of this chapter and also in the next chapter.)
Planning Your New QuickBooks System
I start with a couple of big picture discussions: what accounting does and
what accounting systems do. If you understand this big picture stuff from
the very start, you’ll find that the QuickBooks setup process makes a whole
lot more sense.
What accounting does
Let’s start with a discussion about what accounting does. People may argue
about the little details, but most would agree that accounting does the fol-
lowing four important things:
✦Measures profits and losses
✦Reports on a financial condition of a firm (its assets, liabilities, and net
worth)
✦Provides detailed records of the assets, liabilities, and owner’s equity
accounts
✦Supplies financial information to stakeholders, especially to management

Planning Your New QuickBooks System
72
What accounting systems do
Now take a brief look at what accounting systems — or at least at what small
business accounting systems — typically do:
✦Produce financial statements, including income statements, balance
sheets, and other accounting reports. 
✦Generate business forms, including checks, paychecks, invoices, cus-
tomer statements, and so forth.
✦Keep detailed records of key accounts, including cash, accounts receiv-
able (amounts that customers owe a firm), accounts payable (amounts
that a firm owes its vendors), inventory items, fixed assets, and so on.
✦Perform specialized information management functions. For example, in
the publishing industry, book publishers often pay authors royalties. So
royalty accounting is a task that book publisher accounting systems
must typically do.
What QuickBooks does
Okay, after you understand what accounting does and what accounting sys-
tems typically do, you can see with some perspective what QuickBooks does:
✦Produces financial statements.
✦Generates many common business forms, including checks, paychecks,
customer invoices, customer statements, credit memos, and purchase
orders.
✦Keeps detailed records of a handful of key accounts: cash, accounts
receivable, accounts payable, and inventory in simple settings.
Allow me to make an important observation here: QuickBooks does three of
the four things that you would expect an accounting system to do. Compare
the list that I just provided with the previous list (“What accounting systems
do”). However, I’ll save you the time of finding the fourth thing; QuickBooks
doesn’t supply the specialized accounting stuff. For example, QuickBooks
doesn’t do royalty accounting discussed in the earlier example. 
And now for the bad news
So, QuickBooks does three of the four things that accounting systems do,
but it doesn’t do everything. QuickBooks is often an incomplete accounting
solution. Be careful, therefore, about setting your expectations. You also,
typically, need to figure out workarounds for some of your special account-
ing requirements. 

Book II

QuickBooks

73
QuickBooks gives users and businesses a lot of flexibility. So, returning to the
previous example, a book publisher can do much of what it needs to do for
royalty accounting in QuickBooks. This royalty accounting work simply
requires a certain amount of fiddling as the business is setting up QuickBooks. 
However, QuickBooks does suffer from a couple of significant weaknesses: 
✦QuickBooks Pro doesn’t supply a good way to handle the manufacture 
of inventory. However, QuickBooks Premier and QuickBooks Enterprise
Solutions do support simple manufacturing accounting. (These versions
of QuickBooks help you account for the process of turning raw materials
into finished goods.)
✦QuickBooks doesn’t handle the situation of storing inventory in multiple
locations. It just shows, for example, that you have 3,000 widgets. It
doesn’t let you keep track of the fact that you have 1,000 widgets at the
warehouse, 500 widgets at store A, and 1,500 widgets at store B.
In spite of the fact that QuickBooks may be an incomplete solution and may
not handle inventory the way you want or need, QuickBooks is still a very
good solution. What QuickBooks does, it does very well. Furthermore, I
don’t want to suggest that you shouldn’t ever use a smaller software com-
pany’s accounting solution, but consider the fact that QuickBooks will be
around for a long, long time. 
It’s far more likely that an accounting software product with 600 users, for
example, will be discontinued rather than a product like QuickBooks, which
has 2,000,000 customers. 
Installing QuickBooks
You install QuickBooks in the same way that you install any application pro-
gram. And how you install an application program depends on which version
of Microsoft Windows you’re using. In general, however, recent versions of
Microsoft Windows require that you place the QuickBooks CD into your
CD-ROM or DVD drive. When you do this, Windows looks at the QuickBooks
CD and recognizes it as a CD that includes a new, to-be-installed software
program, and starts the process for installing the QuickBooks software.
You don’t need to do anything special to install QuickBooks. Simply follow
the on-screen instructions. You typically are prompted to enter the installa-
tion key or installation code. This code is available within the QuickBooks
packaging — usually on the back of the envelope that the disc comes in. 

Dealing with the Pre-Interview Jitters
74
The QuickBooks installation process may ask you to answer questions about
how you want QuickBooks installed. Almost always, you want to accept the
default suggestions. In other words, QuickBooks may ask you whether it can
create a new folder in which to install the QuickBooks program files. And in
this case, choose yes.
If your version of Microsoft Windows doesn’t recognize that you’ve stuffed
the QuickBooks CD into the machine’s CD or DVD drive, you have a couple of
choices:
✦You can wait. Probably, if you wait, Windows will recognize that you’ve
placed the QuickBooks CD into the CD or DVD drive and, after a short
wait (even though it may seem like an eternity), Windows starts the
process of installing the QuickBooks program.
✦You can manually force the installation of the QuickBooks program.
Windows includes a tool that you can use to add or remove new programs
(unsurprisingly named the Add/Remove Programs tool). I don’t describe
how this Control Panel tool works here, but you can refer to a book such
as Windows XP For Dummies, by Andy Rathbone (Wiley Publishing, Inc.),
or Windows online Help to get this information. In a nutshell, you simply
open the Control Panel window, click the Add/Remove Programs tool and
follow the on-screen instructions for telling Windows to install a program
stored on the CD or DVD in the computer’s CD or DVD drive.
QuickBooks can work as a multi-user accounting system. This means that sev-
eral people can use QuickBooks. The QuickBooks data file — the repository 
of all the QuickBooks information — typically resides on a centrally available
computer or server. People who want to work with the QuickBooks data file
simply install the QuickBooks program on their computers and then use the
program to access centrally located QuickBooks data files. This multi-user
system isn’t complicated to run; in fact, I talk about it quite a bit in Book VII,
Chapter 2. Note that you need to own a separate copy of QuickBooks for each
computer on which you install QuickBooks. You can also buy multi-user
copies of QuickBooks that let you install the QuickBooks program on up to
five computers. I mention this because you don’t want to get involved in soft-
ware piracy — which is a felony — as part of inadvertently setting up
QuickBooks in the wrong way. The bottom line: You need a legal copy of
QuickBooks for every machine on which you install QuickBooks.
Dealing with the Pre-Interview Jitters
After you install QuickBooks, you run an interview to set up QuickBooks for
your firm’s accounting. In the next sections, I explain what you need to do
before you run the QuickBooks setup interview so that you work in an effi-
cient manner. I also give you an overview of what you’ll do as you go through
the interview. 

Book II
Chapter 1

QuickBooks
Dealing with the Pre-Interview Jitters

Preparing for the interview
In running the interview, you provide quite a bit of information to QuickBooks.
As a practical matter, the EasyStep Interview and the post-interview cleanup
(which I describe in this chapter and the next one) require that you have the
following:
✦Accurate financial statements as of the conversion-to-QuickBooks date 
✦Detailed records of your accounts payable, accounts receivable, inven-
tory, and fixed assets
✦A complete or nearly complete list of employees, customers, vendors,
and inventory items (if you buy and sell inventory)
You want to get all this stuff together before you start the EasyStep Interview
because you are asked about this stuff as part of the interview. Don’t try to
scurry around, looking for a particular piece of data while you are running
the interview; collect this data up front. Then stack all the necessary paper-
work on your desk next to your computer. 
Let me also note that you are going to make several accounting decisions 
as you go through the EasyStep Interview. For example, you decide whether
you want to use an accounts payable system. You tell QuickBooks whether
you want to send customers monthly statements. You are also asked
whether you want to prepare estimates for customers. And you are asked
whether you want to use classes to further track your income and spending.
In general, when you’re asked one of the accounting questions, you can
simply accept the default answer. However, you are required by law to be
consistent in your accounting for tax purposes. If you want to change your
accounting — technically called a change of accounting method by the
Internal Revenue Service — you must request permission to make the
change from the IRS. How to do this and the ramifications of doing this are
beyond the scope of this book, but be forewarned: The IRS insists that you
be consistent in your accounting. If you’ve been treating particular items of
income or expense in a certain way, the IRS says, “Hey, dude, you must con-
tinue to treat them that way unless you get permission from us to change.”
One final note: You should have your tax return from last year handy
because it supplies a bunch of information that you need for running the
EasyStep Interview. For example, last year’s tax return supplies your tax-
payer ID number, your legal business name, and your method of accounting.
What happens during the interview
As you walk through the interview, you work with QuickBooks to set up the
QuickBooks preferences (which determine how QuickBooks works and which
features are initially available) and to set up a chart of accounts and your bank
accounts.

Running the EasyStep Interview
76
The chart of accounts, just so you know, identifies those income, expense,
asset, liability, and owner’s equity accounts that appear on your financial
statements.
After you complete the EasyStep Interview, you’re almost ready to begin using
QuickBooks. In fact, in a pinch, you could (after the EasyStep Interview) limp
along with QuickBooks. 
An important point of clarification: You might think that you should be ready
to rock and roll after installing QuickBooks and running through the EasyStep
Interview. However, you have two other QuickBooks setup tasks to complete
after the EasyStep Interview: identify your starting trial balance (which I
describe at the end of this chapter) and load your key master files (which I
mostly describe in the next chapter). The trial balance identifies your year-
to-date income and expense numbers and your asset, liability, and owner’s
equity numbers as of the conversion date. The master files store information
that you repeatedly use about customers, vendors, employees, and inventory
items. For example, the customer master file stores a customer’s name and
address, phone number, and the contact person.
Running the EasyStep Interview
After you install the QuickBooks program, the installation program may start
QuickBooks automatically and then start the EasyStep Interview. You can also
start the EasyStep Interview by starting the QuickBooks program the same
way you start any program — by choosing the File➪New Company command. 
The big Welcome
The Welcome screen of the EasyStep Interview appears when you choose 
the New Company command (see Figure 1-1). The screen provides some gen-
eral information about setting up a new company within QuickBooks. The
screen also provides links — such as the link you can click to get help from a
QuickBooks certified advisor. (QuickBooks advisors, by the way, are people
who have taken a test about QuickBooks and paid $500 to Intuit to get a copy
of QuickBooks and be listed on the QuickBooks Web site as a QuickBooks
advisor.) You probably want to read through this screen’s information, but
when you’re ready to begin, click the Start Interview button.
The EasyStep Interview walks you through a bunch of screens full of informa-
tion. To move to the next screen, you click the Next button. To move to the
previous screen, you click the Prev button. If you get discouraged and want
to give up, you can click the Leave button. But try not to get discouraged.

Supplying company information
The first few screens of the EasyStep Interview collect several important
pieces of general information about your business, including your company
name and the firm’s legal name, your company address, your federal tax ID
number, the first month in the fiscal year (typically January), the type of
income tax form that your firm uses to report to the IRS, and the industry or
type of company that you are operating (retail, service, and so forth), as
shown in Figure 1-2.

78
After collecting this general company information, QuickBooks creates the
company data file that stores your firm’s financial information. QuickBooks
suggests a default name or a QuickBooks data file based on the company
name (see Figure 1-3). All you need to do is accept the suggested name and
the suggested folder location (unless you want to save the data file into the
My Documents folder, which isn’t a bad idea).
Customizing QuickBooks
After QuickBooks collects the general company information mentioned in the
preceding paragraphs, the EasyStep Interview asks you some very specific
questions about how you run your business so it can set the QuickBooks
preferences. Preferences, in effect, turn on or off various accounting features
within QuickBooks, thereby controlling how QuickBooks works and looks.
Here are the sorts of questions that the EasyStep Interview asks to set the
QuickBooks preferences:
✦Does your firm maintain inventory?
✦Do you want to track the inventory that you buy and sell?
✦Do you collect sales tax from your customers?
✦When do you sell items?
✦What invoice format do you want to use to bill customers?
✦Do you want to use sales orders to track customer orders and 
backorders?
✦Do you want to use QuickBooks to help with your employee payroll?
✦Do you want to prepare written or verbal estimates for your customers?
Figure 1-3:

dialog box.

Book II
Chapter 1

QuickBooks
Running the EasyStep Interview

✦Do you ever prepare more than one invoice for an estimate (if you want
to do progress billing or partial billing)? 
✦Would you like to track the time that you or your employees spend on
jobs or projects for customers?
✦Do you want to use classes to further segregate income and expense,
assets, liabilities, and owner’s equity data? 
✦How do you want to handle bills and payments (enter the checks
directly, or enter the bills first and the payments later)?
✦How often do you want to see your Reminder List?
✦Do you prefer to view reports on an accrual or cash basis?
Setting your start date
Perhaps the key decision that you make in setting up any accounting system is
the day on which you begin using your new system. This is called the conver-
sion date. Typically, you want to begin using an accounting system on either
the first day of the year or the first day of a new month. Accordingly, one other
big question you are asked is about the conversion date. You are prompted to
identify the start date by using the dialog box shown in Figure 1-4.
The easiest time to start using a new accounting system is at the beginning
of the year. The reason? You get to enter a simpler trial balance. At the start
of the year, for example, you enter only asset, liability, and owner’s equity
account balances. 
Figure 1-4:
The
EasyStep
Interview
dialog box
that lets you
select the
start date.

Running the EasyStep Interview
80
At any other time, you also enter year-to-date income and year-to-date
expense account balances. Typically, you have this year-to-date income and
expense information available only at the start of the month. For this reason,
the only other feasible start date that you can pick is the start of a month. 
In this case, you get year-to-date income amounts through the end of the
previous month from your previous accounting system. For example, if
you’ve been using Peachtree, get year-to-date income and expense amounts
from Peachtree.
After you provide the start date, you have supplied the basic company infor-
mation, you’ve identified most of your accounting preferences, and you’ve
identified the date on which you want to start using QuickBooks. You’re
almost done.
If you click the Leave button, QuickBooks leaves you in the QuickBooks pro-
gram, ready to get to work. However, the EasyStep Interview process isn’t
lost forever; to get back into the interview, just open the file you were in the
process of setting up. When you do, the EasyStep Interview restarts.
Adding bank accounts
During the EasyStep interview, you are asked about any bank accounts you
use in your business, as shown in Figure 1-5. You just name the bank accounts.
Later on, as I describe in the next chapter, you provide the starting balance on
the conversion date.

Reviewing the suggested chart of accounts
At the very end of the EasyStep Interview and based on the information that
you supply about your type of industry and the tax return form that you file
with the IRS, QuickBooks suggests a starting set of accounts — accountants
call it a chart of accounts. These accounts are the categories that you use to
track your income, expenses, assets, and owner’s equity. Figure 1-6 shows the
screen that the EasyStep Interview displays for showing you these accounts.
The accounts that QuickBooks marks with a check, as the screen explains, 
are the recommended accounts. And if you don’t do anything else, these
checked accounts are the ones you’ll use (at least to start) within QuickBooks.
However, you can remove a suggested account by clicking the checkmark.
QuickBooks removes the checkmark and that means the account won’t be
part of the final chart of accounts. You can also click an account to add a
checkmark and have the account included on the starting chart of accounts.
You can click the Restore Recommendations button at the bottom of the list
to return to the initial, recommended chart of accounts (if you made changes
you later decide you don’t want).
When the suggested chart of accounts looks okay to you, click Next. It’s fine
to just accept what QuickBooks suggests because you can later change the
chart of accounts.

Identifying the Starting Trial Balance
82
Looking at the QuickBooks Learning Center window
After you finish with the EasyStep Interview, QuickBooks displays the
QuickBooks Learning Center window, as shown in Figure 1-7. This window
provides clickable hyperlinks that you can use to view tutorials that provide
a “big picture” overview of how you work with QuickBooks. There’s good
stuff here, so if you’re new to QuickBooks, go ahead: poke around. After you
finish poking, click the Begin Using QuickBooks button and the QuickBooks
program window comes into full view. Now, finally, you can begin to enter
accounting data into QuickBooks. Whew.
Identifying the Starting Trial Balance
Here’s an interesting bit of trivia: In spite of all the accounting, tax, and just
general financial genius residing at Intuit (the maker of QuickBooks and a
bunch of other financial accounting software), the EasyStep Interview doesn’t
leave you at a point where you’re truly ready to begin using QuickBooks. You
still haven’t entered your trial balance data.
A simple example to start
In order to record your starting trial balance, you record a journal entry. The
journal entry records the trial balance amounts for all your accounts at the
conversion or start date except for the account balances of your accounts
receivable, accounts payable, and inventory.
As a simple example to show you how this works, suppose that you have the
trial balance shown in Table 1-1. Note that these trial balances are used in
the discussion in Book I, Chapter 2 and shown in that chapter’s Table 2-19.
Please notice that, for this example, no balance is recorded for accounts

receivable (this account doesn’t even show up in the trial balance) and no
balances are recorded for inventory or accounts payable (because these
accounts have zero balances at the conversion date).

Figure 1-8 shows how the Make General Journal Entries window looks when
it records the missing trial balance information from Table 1-1. After this
journal entry is recorded, the trial balance is correct as of the start date.
For more information about how to record a journal entry by using the Make
General Journal Entries window, you can refer to Book IV, Chapter 1. If you
want to try this on your own with no further instruction from me, choose the
Company➪Make Journal Entry command. When QuickBooks displays the
Figure 1-8:

showing a

balance.

Identifying the Starting Trial Balance
84
General Journal Entries window, as shown in Figure 1-8, use the Account,
Debit, and Credit columns to record your journal entry.
Does the idea of making a journal entry terrify the heck out of you? If so, you
may find yourself in a bit of a pickle. You need to become comfortable work-
ing with double-entry bookkeeping in order to set up QuickBooks at a time
other than at the beginning of the year. This means, unfortunately, that if you
are setting up QuickBooks sometime during the middle of the year, you must
enter a general journal entry in order to fix the weirdness that the EasyStep
Interview creates. If you don’t know how double-entry bookkeeping works —
if debits and credits aren’t your friends — you probably need to get some-
body’s help. I suggest that you call your CPA or some other friend who truly
understands accounting. Get him or her to come over and enter the last part
of the trial balance for you by using the General Journal Entry window. Note
that this shouldn’t be a big project — just in case you decide to call your
CPA. If your CPA comes over to your office and if you have the trial balance
ready for her, it should only take a few minutes to enter the general journal
entry necessary. Perhaps you can buy her a nice lunch and that will settle
the score. 
A real-life example to finish
Okay, true confessions. The example I give in the preceding four paragraphs?
you probably won’t be lucky enough to have your starting trial balance jour-
nal entry be so simple. You probably have to deal with an account balance in
your accounts receivable, accounts payable, or inventory account. I now
show you, therefore, how this works.
Suppose that you have the trial balances shown in Table 1-2.

Identifying the Starting Trial Balance

Here’s the tricky part of recording this balance. You are not — I repeat not —
to record all this trial balance information through a journal entry. (I know —
this topic is confusing, but stick with me.) you will record the parts of the
journal that are not accounts receivable, not inventory, and not accounts
payable, as shown in Figure 1-9. Your trial balance won’t balance, of course.
To make it balance, you plug in the difference to an account that QuickBooks
supplies for just this sort of bookkeeping madness: the Opening Bal Equity
account.
Supplying the missing account balances . . .
With a more life-like trial balance, such as the one shown in Table 1-2, you
don’t enter the entire trial balance by using a general entry. Accordingly, you
need a way (obviously) to supply the missing account balance balances.
The burning question, then, is how do you supply the missing account bal-
ances? I’ll tell you. You supply the missing information when you set up the
master files for the customers, your inventory, and your vendors. This is all
more straightforward than you might guess, so let me just give you a bit
more detail about how this process works. (In the next chapter, when I
explain how to load the master files, I describe the mechanics of supplying
almost all the missing information.)
Supplying missing inventory balances
Take the case of the $2,000 of inventory shown in Table 1-2. Suppose that
this inventory is made up of two items: 1,000 widgets that cost $1 each and
500 whatchamacallits that cost $2 each.
Figure 1-9:
The General
Journal
Entries
window
showing
part of a
more
complicated
trial
balance.

Identifying the Starting Trial Balance
86
When you set up your inventory master file (also known as the Item List) and
you tell QuickBooks about the widgets (including what they cost and how
many you’re holding), QuickBooks knows that you have $2,000 of inventory.
This makes sense, right? If you tell QuickBooks that you have 1000 widgets
in stock and they cost $1 apiece, QuickBooks is smart enough to figure out
that you’re holding $1,000 of widgets in your inventory.
Similarly, if you tell QuickBooks that you have 500 whatchamacallits in stock
and that they cost $2 apiece, again, QuickBooks is smart enough to figure
out that you’re holding $1,000 of whatchamacallits in your inventory.
No huge surprise, then, that if QuickBooks knows that you’re holding only two
items in your inventory — $1,000 of widgets and $1,000 of whatchamacallits —
QuickBooks can also calculate that your inventory balance equals $2,000.
It’s really that simple. (See Book III, Chapter 3 for more information.)
Supplying missing accounts receivable 
and accounts payable balances
QuickBooks arrives at the accounts receivable and accounts payable bal-
ances in a fashion very similar to how it determines the inventory account
balance.
As part of setting up your vendor master file, you describe what you owe a
vendor. For example, if you tell QuickBooks about a particular vendor and
indicate that you owe that vendor $1,000, QuickBooks knows that the $1,000
balance represents an account payable. Furthermore, QuickBooks can figure
out your total accounts payable balance by adding up the amounts you owe
all your vendors.
Accounts receivable works in the same way. When you set up your customer
master file, you can describe what each customer owes you. By tallying up
all the individual customer open balances, QuickBooks can easily determine
your accounts receivable balance.
For more information about setting up customer and vendor accounts,
including the opening balances, refer to Book II, Chapter 2.

etting up QuickBooks, as a practical matter, requires that you take two
steps: Run the EasyStep Interview described in Book II, Chapter 1, and
load the master file lists. The master file lists store information that you can
use and reuse. For example, one of the master file lists describes each of
your customers. And this master file of customer information includes the
customer’s name and address, contact information, account numbers, and
so on.
In this chapter, I walk you through the process of adding information to each
of the master files — or lists, as QuickBooks calls them — that you need to
fill (or mostly fill) before you begin using QuickBooks on a day-to-day basis.
One important note: You don’t need to completely fill your master files
before you start doing anything. If you enter your active customers into the
customer master file, your active vendors into the vendor master file, and
so forth, that amount of information may be all you need to get started. With
the information you entered through the EasyStep Interview (as described
in Book II, Chapter 1) and the addition of a few more entries into key master
files, you may be able to add everything else on the fly. QuickBooks enables
you to add entries to the various master files as you work with windows and
dialog boxes that reference master file information.

Setting Up the Chart of Accounts List
88
Setting Up the Chart of Accounts List
The Chart of Accounts List is a list of accounts that you use to categorize
your income, expense, assets, liabilities, and owner’s equity amounts. If you
want to see a particular line item of financial data on a report, you need an
account for that line item. If you want to budget by a particular line item,
you need an account for that budget amount. If you want to report some bit
of financial information on your tax returns, you need an account to collect
that specific data.
Fortunately, the steps for creating new accounts are quite straightforward.
To set up a new account within your Chart of Accounts List, follow these
steps:
1. Choose the Lists➪Chart of Accounts command.
When you choose the Lists➪Chart of Accounts command, QuickBooks
displays the Chart of Accounts window shown in Figure 2-1.
2. Click the Account button at the bottom of the window.
QuickBooks displays the Account menu. One of the Account menu
options is New, which is the command that you use to add a new account.
Figure 2-1:

Setting Up the Chart of Accounts List
89
3. Add a new account by choosing the New command from the Account
menu.
QuickBooks displays the first New Account dialog box, as shown in
Figure 2-2.
4. Use the Type buttons to identify the type of account that you are
adding.
QuickBooks supplies the following account types: Income, Expense,
Fixed Assets, Bank, Loan, Credit Card, Equity, and, if you mark the Other
Accounts Type and open the Other Accounts Type drop-down list box,
Accounts Receivable, Other Current Asset, Other Asset, Accounts
Payable, Other Current Liability, Long Term Liability, Cost of Goods Sold,
Other Income, and Other Expense. If you have a question about which
account type your new account fits into, you should review Book I,
Chapter 1, which describes how financial statements work. These
account groups essentially tell QuickBooks in which area of a financial
statement account data gets reported. Note, too, that the first New
Account dialog box shows examples of the selected account type in the
box above the Continue and Cancel command buttons.

5. Click Continue.
QuickBooks displays the second New Account dialog box, as shown in
Figure 2-3.
6. Use the Name box to give your new account a unique name.
The name that you give the account will appear on your financial 
statements.
7. If the account you’re adding is a subaccount underneath a parent
account, identify the parent account by selecting the Subaccount Of
check box.
After you select the Subaccount Of check box, name the parent account
by using the Subaccount Of drop-down list.
8. (Optional) Provide a description for the new account.
You don’t need to provide a description. Without a description,
QuickBooks can still use the account name on financial statements. If
you want a more descriptive label placed on accounting reports, how-
ever, use the Description box for this purpose.

9. Provide other account information.
The New Account window shown in Figure 2-2 includes a Bank Acct. No.
box that lets you record the bank account number for a particular bank
account. Other account types may have similar boxes for storing related
account information. For example, the credit card account type version
of the New Account window lets you store the card number. If you do
have another box or two in which to store account information, go
ahead and use that, if necessary, to collect the bits and pieces of data
that you want to save.
10. Identify the tax line on which the account information is to be reported
by selecting a tax form and tax line from the Tax Line drop-down list.
You may not need to assign a particular account to a tax line if that
account data isn’t reported on the business’s tax return. For example,
cash account balances aren’t reported on a sole proprietor’s tax return.
So a bank account for a sole proprietor doesn’t have any required tax
line data. Cash account balances are recorded on a tax return of a corpo-
ration, however. So if you are adding a bank account for a corporation,
you use the Tax Line drop-down list to identify the tax line on which the
bank account information gets reported.
11. (Optional but dangerous) Consider recording an opening balance for
the account.
Typically, you should not supply an opening account balance for an
account. But the second New Account window does let you do so. 
For example, in the dialog box shown in Figure 2-3, you can click the
Enter Opening Balance command button. When you click this button,
QuickBooks displays another dialog box that you can use to set a start-
ing account balance. All this sounds rather innocuous. But, seriously,
this is something you rarely do. (You should set starting balances for
accounts using a journal entry, as discussed at the end of Chapter 1 in
Book II.) However, if you know something I don’t, you can use this capa-
bility to set the starting balance for the account as of some date. One
last caution, however. My accounting professors taught me two things
that would suggest that this approach to setting account balances is
crazy:
• Debits are supposed to equal credits. (If you’re setting the opening
balance for an account as part of setting up the new account, you’re
only recording half of the accounting transaction.)
• Entering the opening balance as part of setting up a new account
means no audit trail exists for the transaction. (Rather than having
an invoice associated with a transaction or a check, or even a gen-
eral journal entry, you’re just setting balances on the fly. But hey,
maybe you know something I don’t. . .).

Setting Up the Item List
92
After you describe the new account that you want to set up, you can click
the OK button to save the new account to the Chart of Accounts List. You
can also click the Next button to save the account information and then
redisplay the New Account window so that you can add another account.
If you look closely at Figure 2-3, note some boxes and buttons and even a
hyperlink that I haven’t talked about. QuickBooks does supply other fields
for collecting account information. And, occasionally, QuickBooks also pro-
vides clickable hyperlinks and buttons that you can use to do special tasks
associated with the particular type of account. For example, in the case of a
bank account, QuickBooks supplies an Order Checks hyperlink that you can
click to start the process of ordering check forms for the new account.
And that’s almost everything you need to know about adding accounts. The
one other thing I should mention is that the Account menu — this is the
menu of commands that QuickBooks displays when you click the Account
button available on the Chart of Accounts window — provides several other
useful commands for working with accounts. The menu provides a Delete
command that you use to delete the selected account (as long as you
haven’t already used the account). The menu provides an Edit button that
you can use to make any changes to the selected account information (by
using a window that looks very much like the New Account window shown
in Figure 2-3). The Account menu also provides other commands that you
can use to work with the Chart of Accounts List. Fortunately, most use self-
descriptive command names: Print List, Make Inactive, and so on.
The Activities button, which appears at the bottom of the Chart of Accounts
window, displays a menu of commands that you can use to write checks,
make deposits, enter credit card charges, transfer funds, make journal
entries, reconcile a bank account, and use a register. The Reports button 
displays a menu of commands that you can use to print reports containing
account information.
Setting Up the Item List
If you choose the Lists➪Item List command, QuickBooks displays the Item
List window, as shown in Figure 2-4. The Item List window lists all the items
that you’ve set up as part of running the EasyStep Interview and items that
you’ve added manually since running the EasyStep Interview.
I don’t talk about how you add items to the Item List window here because
Book III, Chapter 3 details that. Note that the Item List is very important! The
Item List lets you keep track of what you buy, hold, and sell to your customers.

Working with the Price Level List
The Price Level List lets you create price adjustments that you can use on
the fly as you invoice customers, issue credit memos, and so forth. Because
the Price Level List directly relates to how you work with and bill for inven-
tory items, I describe how you work with the Price Level List in Book III,
Chapter 3. Rather than repeat information that is of interest to only a few
people and isn’t actually essential for getting started with QuickBooks, I
refer you instead to Book 3, Chapter III.
Using Sales Tax Codes
The Sales Tax Codes List keeps a list of codes, or abbreviations, that you can
use to describe items as taxable or nontaxable. If you choose this command,
QuickBooks displays a window listing the existing sales tax codes. (Usually,
you see two existing codes: Tax and Non.) To add a new sales tax code, click
the Sales Tax Code button, choose New, and describe the new sales tax. 
The Sales Tax Code List doesn’t appear unless you tell QuickBooks to track
sales tax.

Setting Up a Payroll Item List

Setting Up a Payroll Item List
The Payroll Item List identifies items that appear on employee payroll check
stubs. If you’re using an outside payroll service bureau to handle your pay-
roll — and this is not a bad idea — you don’t even need to worry about the
Payroll Item List. If you’re using either the QuickBooks Deluxe or QuickBooks
Premier Payroll Service, again, don’t worry about the Payroll Item List. (In
either case, the QuickBooks folks set up the payroll items that you use for
recording payroll.) And in the case of the QuickBooks Premier Payroll Service,
you don’t even need to track payroll inside QuickBooks because the
QuickBooks people do it at their office location on their computers.
If you do need to add payroll items, follow these steps:
1. Choose the Lists➪Payroll Item List command.
QuickBooks displays the Payroll Item List window.
2. To add a new Payroll Item, click the Payroll Item button and then
choose New from the Payroll Item menu.
QuickBooks displays the Add New Payroll Item dialog box. You can
choose to set up a new payroll item either by using the EZ Set Up
Method or the Custom Set Up Method. If you want QuickBooks to help
you and you’re setting up a common payroll item, click the EZ Set Up
button, click Next, and then simply follow the on-screen instructions.
If you want to perform a custom setup of a payroll item, click the
Custom Set Up button and then Next. QuickBooks walks you through a
multiple-screen interview — like the EasyStep Interview discussed in
Book II, Chapter 1 — that asks you about the payroll item to set up. For
example, the first dialog box that QuickBooks displays asks you to iden-
tify the type of payroll item that you want to create. You answer this
question by selecting one of the radio buttons and then clicking Next.
3. Name the payroll item.
After you identify the type of payroll item, you name it. QuickBooks pro-
vides another version of the Add New Payroll Item dialog box that
includes a field you fill in to give the new item a name.
4. To finish the payroll item setup, click the Next button to move through
the remaining payroll items setup questions.
You identify the name of the government agency to which the liability is
paid, the taxpayer identification number that uniquely identifies you to
the taxing agency, the liability account that you use to track the items, the
tax form line that you use to report the item, the rules that QuickBooks
should use for calculating the item (such as whether the item is subject 
to taxes), and a couple of other miscellaneous pieces of data. After you
supply all this information and click the Finish button (which appears on

Book II

Setting Up Classes
95
the last version of the Add New Payroll Item dialog box), QuickBooks adds
the new payroll item to the Payroll Item List.
The Payroll Item menu supplies commands that are useful for working
with the Payroll Item List. In addition to the commands that you use to
add an item to the list, the menu supplies commands for deleting payroll
items, renaming payroll items, making payroll items active, and printing
the list of payroll items.
Setting Up Classes
QuickBooks lets you use classes to segregate or track financial data in ways
that aren’t possible by using other bits of accounting information, such as
the account number, the customer, the sales rep, the item, and so forth. A
firm can use classes, for example, to segregate business units for product
lines or geographical territories.
To set up classes, follow these steps:
1. Choose the Lists➪Class List command.
QuickBooks displays the Class List window, as shown in Figure 2-5.
Figure 2-5:
The Class
List window.

Setting Up Classes
96
If you don’t see the Class List command, Choose Edit➪Preferences, click
the Accounting icon and then the Company Preferences tab, and check
the Use Class Tracking box.
2. To create a new class, click the Class button and choose New from the
Class menu.
QuickBooks displays the New Class window, as shown in Figure 2-6.
3. To name the new class, enter a name or abbreviation into the Class
Name box.
Note that you enter the class name whenever you record a transaction
that falls into the class. For this reason, you don’t want to create lengthy
or easy-to-mistype class names. Keep things short, simple, and easy.
4. If the class that you’re setting up is actually a subclass of a parent
class, select the Subclass Of check box and then select the parent class
from the Subclass Of drop-down list box.
After you describe the new class, you can click OK to save the class.
Alternatively, you can click Cancel to not save the class. Or, you can click
the Next button to save the class and redisplay the New Class window.
If you don’t want the class to be used any more, you can select the Class
Is Inactive check box.

The Class menu, which appears when you click the Class button, also
supplies commands for editing the information of the selected class, for
deleting the selected class, for making the selected class inactive, for
printing a list of classes, and several other useful commands as well.
These commands are all pretty straightforward to use. Go ahead and
experiment with them to find out how they work.
Setting Up a Customer List
A Customer List keeps track of all your customers and your customer infor-
mation. For example, the Customer List keeps track of billing addresses and
shipping addresses for customers.
Follow these steps to add a customer to the Customer List:
1. Choose the Customers➪Customer Center command.
QuickBooks displays the Customer Center window, as shown in Figure 2-7.
Figure 2-7:
The
Customer
Center
window.

Setting Up a Customer List
98
2. To add a new customer, click the New Customer & Job button and
then choose the New Customer command.
QuickBooks displays the New Customer window, as shown in Figure 2-8.
3. Use the Customer Name box to give the customer a short name.
You don’t need to enter the customer’s full name into the Customer
Name box. That information can go into the Company Name box shown
on the Address Info tab. You just want some abbreviated version of the
customer name that you can use to refer to the customer within the
QuickBooks accounting system.
4. (Usual Rule) Ignore the Opening Balance and As Of boxes.
You typically don’t want to set the customer’s opening balance by using
the Opening Balance and As Of boxes. That’s not the right way to set
your new customer accounts receivable balance. If you do this, you are
essentially setting up the debit part of an entry without the correspon-
ding credit part. Later, you’ll have to go in and enter crazy, wacky journal
entries in order to fix your incomplete bookkeeping. But, an exception to
the usual rule exists, as discussed in the tip that follows.
Although the usual rule is that you do not want to set an opening bal-
ance for a customer, this rule has an important exception. As discussed
at the very end of Chapter 1 in Book II, you record your accounts receiv-
able balance on the conversion date by setting an opening balance for
each customer as of the conversion date. The sum of these opening bal-
ances is what QuickBooks uses to determine your total accounts receiv-
able on the conversion date.
5. Use the boxes of the Address Info tab to supply the company name,
including contact information, billing and shipping addresses, contact
name, contact phone number, fax number, and so on.
(I’m not going to tell you that you should enter somebody’s first name
into the First Name box, or that the phone number of your customer goes
into the box labeled Phone. I figure you don’t need that kind of help.)
6. Supply a bit of additional information about the customer.
If you click the Additional Info tab, shown in Figure 2-9, QuickBooks dis-
plays several other boxes that you can use to collect and store customer
information. For example, you can use the Type drop-down list to cate-
gorize a customer as fitting into a particular “customer type.” (I talk
about how to set up a Customer Type List later in this chapter.) Use the
Terms drop-down list box to identify the customer’s default payment
terms. Use the Rep drop-down list box to identify the customer’s default
sales rep. Finally, use the Preferred Send Method to select the default
method for transmitting the customer’s invoices and credit memos. You
can also record a resale number, specify a default price level, and even
click the Define Fields button to specify additional fields that you want
to collect and report for the customer.

The Price Level List and how it works is discussed in Book III, Chapter 3.
7. Click the Payment Info tab to display the set of boxes shown in Figure
2-10. You can record the customer’s account number, his or her credit
limit, and the preferred payment method.
8. (Optional) Click the Job Info tab to describe the customer job.
The Job Info tab lets you describe information associated with a particu-
lar job being performed for a customer. You use the Job Info tab if you
not only set up a customer but also set up a job for that customer. See
Book IV, Chapter 5 for more information on how job costing works.
Setting Up the Vendor List
Just as you use a Customer List to keep records on all your customers, you
use a Vendor List to keep records on your vendors. Like a Customer List, a
Vendor List lets you collect and record information, such as the vendor’s
address, the contact person, and so on.

Setting Up the Vendor List
101
To add a vendor to your Vendor List, follow these steps:
1. Choose the Vendors➪Vendor Center command.
When you do, QuickBooks displays the Vendor Center window, as shown
in Figure 2-11.
2. To add a new vendor, click the New Vendor button.
QuickBooks displays the New Vendor window, as shown in Figure 2-12.
3. Give the vendor a name in the Vendor Name box.
As is the case with the Customer:Job List, you use this name to refer to
the vendor within QuickBooks. For this reason, an abbreviation is fine.
You just want something easy to enter and easy to remember.
4. (Usual Rule) Ignore the Opening Balance and As Of fields.
Don’t do anything with the Opening Balance and As Of boxes. People
who don’t know better use those boxes to enter the opening balance
owed a vendor and the date the amount is owed. But this only creates
problems later. At some point in the future, this poor soul’s accountant
will need to find and correct this error. As when you add new customers,
however, an exception to the usual rule exists, as discussed in the tip
that follows.
Figure 2-11:
The Vendor
Center
window.

Setting Up the Vendor List
102
Although the usual rule is that you do not want to set an opening bal-
ance for a vendor, this rule has an important exception. As discussed at
the very end of Chapter 1 in Book II, you record your accounts payable
balance on the conversion date by setting an opening balance for each
vendor as of the conversion date. The sum of these opening balances is
what QuickBooks uses to determine your total accounts payable on the
conversion date.
5. Supply the vendor address information.
The Address Info tab supplies a bunch of easy-to-understand boxes that
you use to collect vendor name and address information. You enter, pre-
dictably, the vendor’s full name into the Company Name box.
You can click the Address Details button to display another dialog box
called the Edit Address Information dialog box, which lets you enter the
address in typical street address, city, state, and ZIP code format.
6. Supply any additional information necessary.
If you click the Additional Info tab (shown in Figure 2-13), QuickBooks
displays a handful of other boxes that you can use to collect and store
information, such as your account number with the vendor, the vendor

type, the payment terms that you use when paying the vendor, your
credit limit, and the vendor’s tax ID number. The tax ID number is actu-
ally important if you later send this vendor a 1099 form to report pay-
ments to him.
A good guideline if you’re paying a vendor for the first time is to get 
his or her tax ID number. If somebody won’t give you his or her tax ID
number — thereby making it impossible for you to report payments that
you make to him — it’s probably a sign of something a bit amiss.
Setting Up a Fixed Assets List
If you choose the Lists➪Fixed Asset Item List command, QuickBooks displays
the Fixed Asset Item List window. You can use this window to see a list of the
fixed assets — furniture, equipment, machinery, vehicles, and so forth — that
you’ve purchased. Or at least you can after you click the Item button, choose
New from the menu, and fill in the New Item window for each fixed asset.
Figure 2-14 shows the New Item window you use to describe each fixed asset.
Figure 2-13:
The
Additional
Info tab.

Setting Up a Fixed Assets List
104
Let me make a couple of comments about the QuickBooks Fixed Asset Item
List. The Fixed Asset List doesn’t really integrate with the QuickBooks gen-
eral ledger. You record the purchase or disposal of fixed assets using regular
old QuickBooks transactions. For example, you might record the purchase of
a particular fixed asset simply by entering a check in the usual fashion. And
you might record the disposal of a fixed asset by entering a general ledger
journal entry.
The Fixed Assets Item List, then, just acts as a standalone list that lets you
keep track of the fixed assets you purchased. Because the list is so standalone-
ish, I’m not going to spend much time talking about it in the books of this ref-
erence. Let me also say that your CPA probably — no surely — maintains a list
of your fixed assets because she needs that list in order to correctly include
depreciation on your tax return and in your financial statements (if you get
CPA help to prepare those). For this reason, some people — including me —
see the fixed asset item list as a little bit redundant.
Setting Up Your Employees
If you click the Employee Center button, QuickBooks displays the Employee
Center window. You can use this window to see a list of the employees —

active or inactive — that you’ve identified to QuickBooks. You can also click
the New Employee button to add employees to the list.
Because I discuss how to add employees to the Employee List in Book III,
Chapter 5, I won’t repeat that information here.
Setting Up an Other Names List
If you choose the Lists➪Other Names List command, QuickBooks displays
the Other Names List window. The Other Names List identifies those busi-
nesses or individuals that you pay but who don’t fall into one of these other
standard categories: customers, vendors, and employees. For example, you
may use the Other Names List to identify government agencies that you pay.
To add a name to the Other Names List, click the Other Names button, 
which appears at the bottom of the Other Names window. When QuickBooks
displays the Other Names menu, click New. The New Name window that
QuickBooks displays after you choose the New command provides boxes for
a name, identifying the entity, recording an address, and so on. I don’t show
this window here because it’s just a simplified version of the window that
you use to identify and describe a customer, vendor, or employee.
Setting Up the Profile Lists
If you choose the Lists➪Customer & Vendor Profile List command,
QuickBooks displays a submenu of commands that you use to create 
some of the mini-lists that QuickBooks uses to ease your bookkeeping and
accounting. The Profile Lists include lists of sales reps, customer types,
vendor types, job types, payment terms, customer messages, payment 
methods, shipping methods, and vehicles.
Most of the Profile Lists are pretty darn simple to use. For example, if you
choose the Sales Rep List command, QuickBooks displays the Sales Rep List
window. You then click the Sales Rep button and choose New. QuickBooks
displays the New Sales Rep window, as shown in Figure 2-15. I bet you can
figure out how to use this window.
In case you’re still experiencing a certain amount of accounting anxiety, let
me just point out that you enter the name of the sales representative into the
Sales Rep Name box. Then, throwing caution to the wind, you enter the sales
rep’s initials into the Sales Rep Initials box. When you click OK, QuickBooks
adds the sales rep to your Sales Rep List.

Setting Up the Profile Lists
106
The other Profile Lists work in the same, simple, scaled-down fashion. You
choose the Profile List in the submenu, click the Profile List button, and
choose New. When QuickBooks displays a window, you use one or two boxes
to describe the new Profile List.
Just to prove to you that this really is as easy as I’ve said here, take a look at
the New Customer Message window shown in Figure 2-16 (accessible from
the Customer Message List). This is the window that you use to create a new
customer message. You can place customer messages at the bottom of cus-
tomer invoices and credit memos.
If you want to track vehicle mileage within QuickBooks — and note that you
usually must track business vehicle mileage in order to claim business vehi-
cle expenses as a tax deduction — you can maintain a list of business vehi-
cles using the Vehicle List. This list then lets you easily track your business
vehicles — something you do by using the Company➪Enter Vehicle Mileage
command.

You can specify how QuickBooks works for you by setting preferences.
In fact, just so you know, much of what you do when you run the
QuickBooks EasyStep Interview (when you set up QuickBooks) is provide
information that QuickBooks uses to set your preferences. For example, if
you indicate that you charge customers sales tax, the EasyStep Interview
describes how sales tax should work for your business by using the sales
tax preferences.
Because these preferences have so much effect on how QuickBooks works
and on how a particular user works with QuickBooks, I devote this chapter
to describing how you change the preferences. None of this material is par-
ticularly complicated, but because QuickBooks provides you with a rich set
of preferences options, I cover quite a bit of material. Don’t worry: You don’t
have to read this chapter from beginning to end. Simply use it as a reference
when you have a question about how to change the way QuickBooks works
in a particular area.

Accessing the Preferences Settings
110
Accessing the Preferences Settings
You can set preferences within QuickBooks in two ways:
✦During the EasyStep Interview: You actually set all the preferences, or
at least all the starting preferences for QuickBooks, when you run the
EasyStep Interview. Most of the time, the preferences that the EasyStep
Interview sets are correct. The EasyStep Interview is very smart about
the way it asks questions and translates your answers into preferences
settings. But, if your business changes, or if you make a mistake during
the setup interview, or if someone else in your office ran the EasyStep
Interview for you, you may still need to check and fiddle-faddle with
these preferences.
✦By manually changing the preferences: You can manually change the
preferences by choosing the Edit➪Preferences command. QuickBooks
displays the Preferences dialog box, as shown in Figure 3-1. QuickBooks
groups categories of preferences. For example, QuickBooks groups all the
accounting preferences into an accounting preference set. QuickBooks
groups all the checking account preferences into a checking preference
set. If you look closely at Figure 3-1, you see that along the left edge of the
Preferences dialog box, QuickBooks displays a list of icons. The first icon
is Accounting. The third icon is Checking. To see the preferences within
one of these groups, you click that preference’s icon.
One other item to note about the Preferences dialog box is that it supplies,
in general, two tabs of preferences for each preference set. Preferences that
are specific to an individual user appear on the My Preferences tab, shown
in Figure 3-1. Preferences that are tied to the company data file appear on
the Company Preferences tab, shown in Figure 3-2.
Figure 3-1:
The
Preferences
dialog box.

Chapter 3
Fine-Tuning
QuickBooks
Setting the Accounting Preferences
111
Not every My Preferences tab gives you options for changing the way that
QuickBooks works. Sometimes a particular set of preferences gives personal
options; sometimes it doesn’t.
For example, the My Preferences tab of the Accounting set of preferences
provides no personalized options. In other words, you can’t tell QuickBooks
that a firm’s accounting works differently for a particular person. This makes
sense, right? Accounting needs to work the same way for every user within a
firm. However, with other preferences settings, QuickBooks may allow differ-
ent options for different users. You’ll see this as I discuss the various sets of
preferences in the remainder of this chapter.
And now, I’m just going to walk you through a discussion of each of these
preferences sets. I talk both about the My Preferences option (if available)
and the Company Preferences option.
Setting the Accounting Preferences
QuickBooks doesn’t give individual users personalized preferences for the
way that accounting works within QuickBooks. This makes sense, if you think
about it. Accounting for a business needs to work the same way for Jane as it
does for Joe and for Susan. However, you do have the option to set company
preferences for accounting. This makes sense, again, if you think about it.
Different companies run their accounting system in different ways. Figure 3-3
shows the Company Preferences tab for the Accounting Preferences set.
Figure 3-2:
The
Company
Preferences
tab of the
Preferences
dialog box.

Setting the Accounting Preferences
112
Using account numbers
By default, QuickBooks lets you use names to identify accounts on the Chart
of Accounts or in the accounts list. For example, the account that you use to
track wages expense may be known as “wages.” However, you can check the
Use Account Numbers box to tell QuickBooks that you want to use account
numbers rather than account names for identifying accounts. Larger busi-
nesses and businesses with very lengthy lists of accounts often use account
numbers. You can more easily control both the ordering of accounts on a
financial statement and the insertion of new accounts into the Chart of
Accounts if you’re using numbers.
The Show Lowest Subaccount Only check box lets you tell QuickBooks that it
should display the lowest subaccount rather than the higher parent account
on financial statements. QuickBooks allows you to create subaccounts, which
are accounts within accounts (discussed further in Book II, Chapter 2). You
can also create sub-sub accounts, which are accounts within subaccounts.
You use subaccounts to more finely track assets, liabilities, equity amounts,
revenues, and expenses.
General accounting options
The Company Preferences tab provides the following five general accounting
check boxes as well as closing date settings. (These check boxes are proba-
bly self-explanatory to anybody who has done a bit of accounting with
QuickBooks, but for new QuickBooks users, I provide a brief description of
what each one does.)
✦Use Account Numbers: The Use Account Numbers check box, if selected,
enables you to enter an account number for a transaction. The associ-
ated check box, Show Lowest Subaccount Only, tells QuickBooks to dis-
play only the name and account number of a subaccount (if you’re using
one) instead of the full heritage of the account. If you use a lot of levels of
subaccounts, this option can really clean up views, making it easier to tell
what account you’re looking at.

Company
Preferences
tab of the
Accounting
Preferences
dialog box.

Book II
Chapter 3
Fine-Tuning
QuickBooks
Setting the Accounting Preferences
113
✦Require Accounts: The Require Accounts check box, if selected, tells
QuickBooks that you must specify an account for a transaction. This
makes sense. If you aren’t using account numbers to track the amounts
that flow into and out of the business, you aren’t really doing account-
ing. It would never make sense, in my humble opinion, to deselect the
Require Accounts check box.
✦Use Class Tracking: The Use Class Tracking check box lets you tell
QuickBooks that you want to use not only accounts to track your financial
information but also classes. Classes let you split account level informa-
tion in another way. This sounds complicated, but it’s really quite simple.
The account list, for example, lets you track revenue and expenses by cat-
egories of revenue and expense. You may track expenses by using cate-
gories such as wages, rent, and supplies. Classes, therefore, provide you
with a way to track this information in another dimension. For example,
you can split wages expense into those wages spent for two different loca-
tions of your business. A restaurateur with two restaurants may want to
do this.
✦Automatically Assign General Journal Entry Number: This check box
tells QuickBooks to assign numbers to the general journal entries that
you enter by using the Make Journal Entry command. You want to leave
this check box selected. General journal entries, by the way, are typi-
cally entered by your CPA or your professional on-staff accountant.
✦Closing Date settings: The Closing Date box lets you identify a date
before which your QuickBooks data file can’t be changed. In other
words, if you set the closing date to December 31, 2004, you’re telling
QuickBooks that you don’t want any changes made to the QuickBooks
data file before this date. This means that someone can’t modify a trans-
action that is dated before your closing date without getting a scary
warning message. It also means that someone can’t enter a transaction
by using a date before this closing date. You can also click the Set
Password button to display a dialog box that lets you create a password,
which is required if someone wants to add an old transaction or modify
an old transaction.
Past versions of QuickBooks also let you turn on and off an audit trail feature
by using the Company Preferences tab of the Accounting Preferences.
However, QuickBooks 2007 provides an always-on audit trail, so you don’t see
an Audit Trail check box accounting preference any more. An audit trail, by
the way, simply keeps a list of who makes which changes to transactions.
Accountants, predictably, love audit trails. Audit trails enable someone, such
as your CPA, to come in after the fact and figure out why an account balance
is what it is.

Setting the Checking Preferences
114
Setting the Bill Preferences
If you display the Preferences dialog box and click the Bills icon, you can set
company-level preferences for handling vendor bills. You can, for example,
specify that bills are considered “due” a certain number of days after their
receipt by entering a value into the appropriate text box. You can also use
these company-level preferences to specify that early-payment discounts
should be used and to choose an account for recording the value of these
discounts. (I don’t show you a picture of the Company Preferences tab for
the Bills Preferences. It’s not really worth your time.)
Setting the Checking Preferences
If you display the Preferences dialog box and click the Checking icon,
QuickBooks displays either the My Preferences tab, shown in Figure 3-4, or
the Company Preferences tab, shown in Figure 3-5.

QuickBooks
Setting the Checking Preferences
115
The My Preferences tab for Checking Preferences lets you tell QuickBooks
which account it should suggest as a default account when you open partic-
ular types of windows within QuickBooks. For example, if you look closely 
at Figure 3-4, you see the Open the Write Checks check box. This is the first
check box on the tab. To the right of the Open the Write Checks check box,
you see the Form With Account box. If you check the Open the Write Checks
check box, you can select an account from the Form With Account box. This
tells QuickBooks to use or suggest the specified account every time you
open the Write Checks window.
The My Preferences tab also includes check boxes that you can use to spec-
ify the default account for the Pay Bills window, the Pay Sales Tax window,
and the Make Deposits window. If you have multiple checking accounts set
up, setting the default accounts using the My Preferences tab is a good idea.
Setting these preferences makes it less likely that you’ll erroneously write
checks on or pay bills from the wrong account.
The Company Preferences tab, as shown in Figure 3-5, provides check boxes
that you can use to describe how checks work within QuickBooks:
✦Print Account Names On Voucher: This check box lets you indicate to
QuickBooks that it should print account names on the voucher portion
of the check.
✦Change Check Date When Check Is Printed: Select this check box to tell
QuickBooks to use the current system date as the printed check date.
✦Start with Payee Field on Check: Select this check box to tell QuickBooks
to place the insertion point, or text cursor, on the Payee field when you
open the Write Checks window.
✦Warn about Duplicate Check Numbers: Selecting this check box tells
QuickBooks to alert you to duplicate check numbers. (You want to leave
this check box selected, obviously, so that you don’t use duplicate or
erroneous check numbers.)
✦Autofill Payee Account Number in Check Memo: Select this check box
to tell QuickBooks to automatically fill in the payee account number
when you write a check. QuickBooks retrieves the account number for 
a payee from the Vendor List or from the Other Names List.
✦Select Default Accounts To Use: These check boxes let you specify which
account QuickBooks suggests when you open the Create Paychecks
window or open the Pay Payroll Liabilities window. Essentially, then, these
boxes let you tell QuickBooks which checking account you use to write
payroll checks and to pay payroll liabilities, such as federal income tax
withholding amounts.

Changing the Desktop View
Figure 3-6 shows the My Preferences tab of the Desktop View Preferences
set. The My Preferences tab provides View radio buttons — One Window
and Multiple Windows — that let you indicate whether QuickBooks should
use one window or multiple windows for displaying all its information. The
Multiple Windows option looks like older versions of Microsoft Windows.
With multiple windows, an application such as QuickBooks displays multi-
ple, floating document windows within the application program window. If
you have a question about how this works, your best bet is to simply try
both view settings.
The Desktop radio buttons (refer to Figure 3-6) let you specify whether and
when QuickBooks should save the current appearance, or view, of the desk-
top. You can select the Save When Closing Company radio button to tell
QuickBooks that it should save the view of the desktop when you close a
company. When you reopen a company, QuickBooks then reuses this desk-
top view. You can also select the Save Current Desktop radio button to tell
QuickBooks to save the current view and then reuse this view when
QuickBooks later opens. If you don’t want to make changes to the default
desktop view, select the Don’t Save the Desktop radio button or the Keep
Previously Saved Desktop radio button.
The Color Scheme box lets you pick a color set for the QuickBooks program.
The default color scheme is the Checkbook: Sea Green scheme. QuickBooks
provides several other color schemes, including Denim Blues, Desert Isle,
Grappa Granite, and so on. (If you are wild about color, you can experiment
with these other options.) Note that these are My Preferences options, which
means that they are personal to you. You can experiment with the settings for
color without having anyone else see that you are really into Sea Stone or
Summer Linen (two other color options).

The Windows Settings buttons let you access the Windows Display Properties
and Windows Sounds Properties settings. Typically, you would make changes
to Windows Display Properties and Windows Sounds Properties by using 
the Control Panel tools. However, you can also make changes from within
QuickBooks by using these two buttons. (In actuality, when you click these
buttons, QuickBooks just starts the Control Panel tools.)
If you have questions about how the Windows Display Properties or Sounds
Properties work, refer to the Windows Help file or to a good book, such as
Windows XP For Dummies, by Andy Rathbone (Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
The Company Preferences available for the Desktop view let you specify
what icons appear on the QuickBooks home page, as shown in Figure 3-7.
The Customers set of check boxes, for example, let you specify which cus-
tomer-related accounting tasks are available via icons on the home page.
The Vendors set of check boxes let you specify, in similar fashion, which
vendor-related accounting tasks are available via icons on the home page.
Near the button of the Company Preferences tab for the Desktop view are
other hyperlinks you can click to turn on and off the display of other
accounting task icons.
Setting Finance Charge Calculation Rules
The Finance Charge Preferences settings let you specify how QuickBooks
should calculate finance charges on overdue invoices to customers. None of
the My Preferences options are available for finance charges — only Company
Preferences. Because I describe how the Company Preferences tab for the
Finance Charge Preferences works in Book III, Chapter 1, I won’t repeat that
information here.

✦To automatically open drop-down lists when typing
✦To beep when you record a transaction
✦To automatically place a decimal point two characters from the right

✦To warn you when you are editing an existing transaction
✦To bring back all the one-time Help messages that it shows
✦To turn off pop-up messages for products and services
✦To show ToolTips for clipped text
✦To warn you when you are deleting an existing transaction or some item

✦To automatically recall account or transaction information — telling
QuickBooks, for example, to automatically recall the last transaction for
a particular customer, vendor, or employee
✦To use either today’s date or the last entered date as the default date
✦To keep custom item information changed as part of entering a 
transaction

If you have specific questions about the My Preferences check boxes that
are available for the General Preferences options, click the Help button that
appears along the right edge of the Preferences dialog box. QuickBooks pro-
vides brief but useful descriptions of how the Preferences options work and
what they do.
Figure 3-9 shows the Company Preferences tab for the General Preferences
set. The Time Format radio buttons let you specify whether QuickBooks
should show the minutes in an hour as a decimal value or as minutes. The
Time Format radio button descriptions include examples of how these two
approaches vary, so look closely at the dialog box if you have questions. The
Company Preferences tab includes a check box that lets you specify that
QuickBooks should always show years using four digits. And the Company
Preferences tab includes a check box that you can select to tell QuickBooks
that it should not update the name information for a particular customer,
vendor, employee, or other name when you are saving a new transaction for
that customer, vendor, employee, or other name.
Controlling Integrated Applications
The Integrated Applications Preferences aren’t personal, so no options are
available on the My Preferences tab. However, the Company Preferences tab
for the Integrated Applications Preferences set does control and track other
applications, or computer programs that open the QuickBooks company
data files. Figure 3-10 shows the Company Preferences tab for the Integrated
Applications Preferences set.
The Don’t Allow Any Applications to Access This Company File check box, if
selected, tells QuickBooks that it should not allow other applications to open
this company data file. The Notify the User Before Running Any Application
Whose Certificate Has Expired check box, if selected, tells QuickBooks that it
should not allow any program whose security certificate is out of date to open
the QuickBooks company data file without first notifying the user (that’s you).

The list box on the Company Preferences tab of the Integrated Applications
Preferences set shows the name of the applications that have previously
requested to open the QuickBooks company data file. You can remove an
application from this list by clicking the application and then the Remove
button. You can change the rules or properties that the QuickBooks program
applies to access this other application by clicking the application in the list
and then clicking the Properties button.
Controlling Inventory
No personal preferences are available for inventory tracking and control, 
but QuickBooks provides several Company Preferences available regarding
inventory and items, as shown in Figure 3-11. You can turn the QuickBooks
inventory and purchase order features on and off. You can specify you want
to be warned if you enter a purchase order number you’ve previously used.
And you can specify how QuickBooks determines whether you have or don’t
have enough inventory to sell.

Controlling How Jobs and Estimates Work
121
If you buy or sell an item using more than one unit of measure — say you sell
fabric both by the yard and by the bolt (the rolled-up fabric), QuickBooks
lets you quantify your inventory items using more than a single unit of meas-
ure. If you’re interested in doing this, click the Enable button.
Controlling How Jobs and Estimates Work
Because no personal preferences are available for Jobs & Estimates prefer-
ences, the My Preferences tab for this Preferences set shows no options.
However, you have several Company Preferences available regarding jobs
and estimates, as shown in Figure 3-12. The Pending text box lets you
describe what term or word should be used for jobs that have been submit-
ted but haven’t been accepted or rejected. The Awarded box lets you pro-
vide a term or description that you want to use within QuickBooks to
identify those jobs that customers or clients have accepted. The default
description of an awarded job is, cleverly, awarded. The In Progress, Closed,
and Not Awarded boxes similarly let you describe what term you want to use
for jobs that fit into these categories.
The Do You Create Estimates? radio buttons let you indicate to QuickBooks
whether you want to create job estimates for customers. You select the
radio button — Yes or No — that answers the question. The Do You Do
Progress Invoicing? buttons let you indicate whether you do progress billing
for jobs. The Warn About Duplicate Estimate Numbers check box, if selected,
tells QuickBooks to warn you about using duplicate estimate numbers. The
Don’t Print Items That Have Zero Amount check box, if selected, tells
QuickBooks not to print estimates that have zero balances.
Book IV, Chapter 5 talks more about setting up jobs and estimates. You may
want to refer to it if you have questions about how project costing and job
costing work within QuickBooks.

tab of the

Controlling How Payroll Works
122
Controlling How Payroll Works
The Payroll & Employees Preferences set includes only Company Preferences.
The Company Preferences tab is shown in Figure 3-13. The QuickBooks Payroll
Features radio buttons let you tell QuickBooks how you want to handle pay-
roll: using an outside payroll service such as Intuit Complete Payroll (select
Complete Payroll Customers in this case), using QuickBooks payroll features
(select the Full Payroll radio button), or that you’re not using payroll at all
(select the No Payroll radio button).
The Printing Preferences button lets you tell QuickBooks what employee
information to print on the payroll check: employee address, company
address, sick pay information, vacation pay information, and pay period
information. You can figure out how this works by clicking the button and
looking at the dialog box that QuickBooks displays.
The Set Preferences button lets you fiddle with the way that QuickBooks
tracks information related to your workers’ compensation tax. Again, click the
button to see a screen that provides more information about how this works.
In roughly the middle of the Company Preferences tab of the Payroll &
Employees Preferences set, QuickBooks supplies several other check boxes
and radio buttons:
✦Copy Last Paycheck Earnings When Creating New One: Another Duh.
✦Recall Quantity Field on Paychecks: QuickBooks recalls or reuses pay-
check quantity information from the last pay period’s paychecks. (The
QuickBooks Help File suggests that you use this option when you have a
“fixed quantity that occurs from paycheck to paycheck.” The Help File
uses the example of tiered sales commissions where the commission
amount is set for each tier.)

Telling QuickBooks How Reminders Should Work
123
✦Job Costing, Class and Item Tracking for Paycheck Expenses:
QuickBooks lets you track payroll expenses not just by account but 
by job, class, or item.
✦The Assign One Class Per radio buttons (Entire Paycheck and Earnings
Item): Enables you to break down wages expense into classes more finely.
For example, you can indicate that you want to use a different class for
each item that appears on an employee’s paycheck. (This option only
appears if classes are enabled.)
The Display Employee List By radio buttons let you choose how employee
lists are sorted on reports — by first name or by last name.
If you click the Employee Defaults button, QuickBooks displays a dialog box
that you can use to set employee payroll default information, such as deduc-
tions for taxes or health insurance.
Finally, at the bottom of the dialog box, QuickBooks provides two other
options for handling payroll. The Mark New Employees as Sales Reps check
box, if selected, does what you’d expect: It marks new employees that you
add to the employee list as sales reps. And the Display Employee Social
Security Numbers in Headers on Reports, if selected, also does what you’d
expect: It adds employee social security numbers to reports.
Telling QuickBooks How Reminders Should Work
The My Preferences tab of the Reminders Preferences set consists of just
one check box: You can use it to tell QuickBooks that you want to see the
Reminders list when you open a company file. Because the My Preferences
tab includes only a single check box, I don’t show it here as a figure.
The Company Preferences tab, as shown in Figure 3-14, provides a bunch of
radio buttons that you can use to specify how QuickBooks should remind you
of accounting and bookkeeping tasks that you need to complete: Checks to
Print, Paychecks to Print, Invoices/Credit Memos to Print, Overdue Invoices,
Sales Receipts to Print, Sales Orders to Print, Inventory to Reorder, Assembly
Items to Build, Bills to Pay, Memorized Transactions Due, Money to Deposit,
Purchase Orders to Print, and To Do Notes.
For each of these accounting or bookkeeping tasks, you indicate whether
you want to see a reminder for the item in the Summary list that appears in
the QuickBooks Company Preferences Reminders list. You can also choose
to actually see the List of Tasks — such as the list of Checks to Print — or
you can indicate that you don’t want to be reminded of some particular cate-
gory of accounting or bookkeeping. For some of the reminder notes, you

Specifying Reports & Graphs Preferences
124
indicate how many work days in advance you want to be reminded. For
example, if you indicate that you want to be reminded to print checks, you
must indicate how many days before the check date that you want the
reminder to appear. You do this by entering a numeral in one of the Remind
Me text boxes.
Specifying Reports & Graphs Preferences
The My Preferences tab of the Reports & Graphs Preferences set is shown in
Figure 3-15. This tab provides radio buttons that you can use to indicate how
QuickBooks should refresh reports when the information upon which the
report is based changes. The default refresh option is Prompt Me to Refresh.
If you set refreshing to Prompt Me to Refresh, when QuickBooks updates a
report for changes in the information, it prompts you via a message box. You
can also select the Refresh Automatically radio button to have QuickBooks
automatically refresh a report whenever the data changes. You don’t want to
refresh automatically, however, if you have a large data set and many reports.
Refreshing a report can be rather time-consuming. Refreshing many reports
based on a large data set takes a long time. You can also select the Don’t
Refresh radio button if you don’t want or don’t need to be reminded about
refreshing a report.
The Graphs Only check boxes let you control the way QuickBooks graphs
report information. You can select the Draw Graphs in 2D check box to tell
QuickBooks to draw two-dimensional rather than three-dimensional graphs.
(QuickBooks draws two-dimensional graphs much more quickly, so you may
want to use two-dimensional graphs.) Note also that two-dimensional graphs
are visually more precise than three-dimensional graphs. You can also select
the Use Patterns check box to tell QuickBooks to draw a graph that uses
cross-hatching patterns rather than colors for the different pieces of a chart.

The Prompt Me to Modify Report Options Before Opening a Report check
box, if selected, tells QuickBooks to open the Modify Report window when-
ever you create a report. You can use the Modify Report window to control
what information is included in a report (such as what date range the report
is based on) and other reporting options as well. If the Prompt Me to Modify
Report Options Before Opening a Report check box isn’t selected, QuickBooks
creates a report by using the default reporting options.
For a complete discussion of the Modify Reports window, refer to the discus-
sion in Book IV, Chapter 2.
Figure 3-16 shows the Company Preferences tab for the Reports & Graphs
Preferences set. This Company Preferences tab provides several useful
options for default report generation rules. The Summary Reports Basis
radio buttons, for example, let you indicate whether the default accounting
method used to create a report should be accrual-basis accounting or cash-
basis accounting. The Aging Reports radio buttons let you specify how the
age of an invoice or bill should be calculated: from the due date or from the
transaction date. The Reports-Show Accounts By Option radio buttons let
you specify how account information appears on reports: account name
only, description only, or both name and description.

Two other Company Preference options are especially noteworthy. The
Classify Cash button displays a dialog box that lets you indicate whether
changes in a particular account balance should appear under the operating,
investing, or financing portion of the Statement of Cash Flows. If you’re not a
professional accountant, you want to get your CPA’s help in making changes
to this area of QuickBooks. The rules for presenting a Statement of Cash
Flows are quite involved.
The Format button displays the Report Format Preferences dialog box, which
lets you customize the report header and footer information. Figure 3-17
shows the Header/Footer tab for the Report Format Preferences dialog box.
The Show Header Information check boxes let you specify what information
should appear in the report header area. The Show Footer Information check
boxes let you make the same specifications for the report footer. The Page
Layout Alignment box lets you specify how information should be aligned on
the report page.
Figure 3-18 shows the Fonts & Numbers tab of the Report Format Preferences
dialog box. This dialog box lets you specify what font and formatting you want
to use for bits of report information. For example, if you want to change the
font for the reports column labels, click the Column Labels entry in the
Change Font For list box. Then click the Change Font button. QuickBooks dis-
plays a Font Formatting dialog box that lets you specify the font, font style,
point size, and other special effects.
If you’re confused about changing report formatting, refer to the discussion
in Book IV, Chapter 2. It talks about all this stuff.

I won’t show you the My Preferences tab. The personalized preferences for
dealing with sales and customers are pretty basic. The tab just lets you spec-
ify whether QuickBooks should prompt you to invoice a customer for time
or costs you’ve previously said are billable to that customer.
The company preferences deserve more explanation. Figure 3-19 shows the
Company Preferences tab for the Sales & Customers Preferences set. The
Sales Forms options relate to the invoice information you supply to cus-
tomers. The Usual Shipping Method box lets you specify the default shipping
method. The Usual FOB box lets you set the default FOB, or Free On Board,
point. You can mark a check box to tell QuickBooks if it should warn you
when you use duplicate invoice numbers.

The Miscellaneous options fine-tune some of your invoicing calculations. For
example, to indicate how you want to track reimbursed expenses, mark or
unmark the Track Reimbursed Expenses as Income box. The Default Markup
Percentage box lets you specify a default retail markup percentage to use in
your pricing (although you should double-check that it’s showing up prop-
erly on estimates before you count on it). You can also use the Choose
Template for Invoice Packing Slip drop-down list box to specify how packing
slips should look.
The Receive Payments check boxes let you indicate that you want to auto-
matically apply and automatically calculate payments as well as use the
Undeposited Funds account as a temporary holding account for customer
payments. (For more information about the Undeposited Funds account and
customer payments, refer to Book III, Chapter 1.)
The Use Price Levels check box lets you turn on QuickBooks price levels fea-
tures. I won’t say more about this here. Price levels are discussed in more
detail in Book III, Chapter 3.
The Sales Orders boxes let you control how the QuickBooks sales orders
work, including whether you even want to use sales orders and how they
should look when they print.
Specifying How Sales Are Taxed
Although no personal preferences are available for sales tax, company pref-
erences do exist. Figure 3-20 shows the Company Preferences tab for the
Sales Tax Preferences set. The Do You Charge Sales Tax? radio buttons,
which appear near the top of the tab, control whether you can charge sales
tax within QuickBooks. You select the radio button — Yes or No — that
answers the question.

The Default Sales Tax Codes boxes let you define what code QuickBooks
should use to identify taxable and non-taxable sales. By default, QuickBooks
uses the clever “tax” code for taxable sales and the equally clever “non”
code for non-taxable sales. However, you can select the Add New entry from
either the Taxable drop-down list box or the Non-Taxable drop-down list box
and use the dialog box that QuickBooks displays to create your own taxable
and non-taxable codes.
The Set Up Sales Tax Items and Assign Sales Tax Codes boxes let you set up
an item for the sales tax that you charge on invoices. You can indicate the
default (or most common) sales tax item that you want to include by enter-
ing this sales tax item name into the Your Most Common Sales Tax Item box.
To add the sales tax item by using the Most Common Sales Tax Item box,
select the Add New entry from the drop-down list box and complete the
dialog box that QuickBooks displays. The New Item dialog box lets you name
the sales tax item and identify the sales tax rate.
You can also add a new sales tax item by clicking the Add Sales Tax Item
button.
The Taxable Item Code and Non-taxable Item Code drop-down lists let you
select the code words to designate invoice items as subject to sales tax. The
Mark Taxable Amounts With “T” When Printing check box, if selected, tells
QuickBooks to flag taxable amounts on an invoice with the code T.
The When Do You Owe Sales Tax radio buttons let you indicate when the
taxing authority says you owe sales tax: as of the invoice date (which means
the taxing authority requires accrual-basis accounting) or upon receipt of
payment (which means the taxing authority allows cash-basis accounting).
The When Do You Pay Sales Tax radio buttons (Monthly, Quarterly, and
Annually) let you tell QuickBooks how frequently you must remit sales tax
amounts. You select the radio button that corresponds to your sales tax pay-
ment frequency.
Book II, Chapter 2 describes how to set up sales tax items.
Setting the Send Forms Preferences
The Company Preferences tab for the Send Forms Preferences set is shown
in Figure 3-21. The Company Preferences tab lets you specify the default
message text, message subject, and salutation for e-mailed invoices, esti-
mates, and statements. To use the Company Preferences tab, you use the
Change Default For drop-down list box to specify which type of message text

Fine-Tuning the Service Connection
130
that you want to change. Then you use the other boxes on the Company
Preferences tab to make whatever change you want to the default message.
To change the message subject, for example, you replace the contents of the
Subject text box.
The only personal preference for sending forms is a check box that tells
QuickBooks you want the To Be Emailed check box on the invoice automati-
cally marked. Book III, Chapter 1 talks about invoicing customers and how to
e-mail customer invoices.
Fine-Tuning the Service Connection
For the Service Connection Preferences set, several company preferences
options are available. You can, for example, indicate whether QuickBooks
should automatically connect to QuickBooks Services without asking for a
password, or whether it should always ask for a password. To make this
decision, you simply select the appropriate radio button. You can also select
the Allow Background Downloading Of Service Messages check box to tell
QuickBooks that background collection of messages is okay. (If you select
this check box, QuickBooks downloads new messages during idle times so
that it doesn’t slow down your other Internet activities.)
The My Preferences tab of the Service Connection Preferences provides two
check boxes you can mark to control how QuickBooks works when you’re
making Web connections, as shown in Figure 3-22. One check box gives you
the option of saving downloaded files. The other tells QuickBooks not to
close your Web browser when it finishes using the Web.

Always Check Spelling Before Printing, Saving, or Sending Supported Forms
check box, for example, if you want to have automatic spell checking per-
formed before you actually distribute a document to an outside party, such
as a customer or vendor. You can also use the Ignore Words With check
boxes to tell QuickBooks not to spell check words or phrases that aren’t
going to appear correctly spelled because they aren’t real words. For exam-
ple, you can select the Internet Addresses check box to tell QuickBooks that
it shouldn’t check Internet URL addresses. And you can select the All UPPER-

check words that are acronyms and abbreviations, such as OK and ASAP.

Controlling How 1099 Tax Reporting Works
No personal preferences exist for 1099 tax reporting. Company preferences,
however, exist as indicated by the Company Preferences tab, shown in
Figure 3-24. The Company Preferences tab lets you tell QuickBooks when you
are required to file 1099-MISC forms. The Company Preferences tab also lets
you identify the threshold amounts for the different types of miscellaneous
income that you can report. For example, the current threshold amounts for
rent that is paid is $600. Therefore, the threshold amount shown for Box 1:
Rents on the 1099 appears as $600. You can change this amount by editing
the value shown in the Threshold box. Note that different types of 1099 mis-
cellaneous income have different reporting thresholds. For example, if you
look down to Box 9: Direct Sales, you see that the reporting threshold is
$5,000. Confer with your tax advisor if you have questions about these
amounts or visit the IRS Web site at www.irs.gov.
Setting Time Tracking Preferences
Figure 3-25 shows the Company Preferences tab for the Time Tracking
Preferences set. To turn on time tracking within QuickBooks, select Do You
Track Time? by selecting the Yes radio button. You can also use the First Day

Time Sheet window. (This is what you use to describe billable time for the
week.) Book III, Chapter 1 talks about billing for time in more detail. You may
want to look there if you have questions about tracking time and billing for

In This Chapter
 Choosing an invoice form
 Customizing an invoice form
 Invoicing a customer
 Billing for time
 Recording a sales receipt
 Recording credit memos
 Receiving customer payments
 Assessing finance charges
QuickBooks provides several tools for invoicing your customers. This
chapter describes these tools as well as a handful of related tools for
recording customer payments and for issuing credit memos.
If you’ve already been invoicing customers using some manual method —
perhaps you’ve been preparing invoices with a word processor — you’ll find
QuickBooks to be a godsend. Not only does QuickBooks make invoicing and
related tasks easier, but it also collects invoice information, recording this
information into the QuickBooks data file. Happily, this means that you get
the extra benefit of recording accounting transactions simply by using
QuickBooks for invoicing.
Choosing an Invoice Form
QuickBooks allows you to use an invoice form that matches the requirements
of your business. For example, businesses that sell products need an invoice
that includes descriptions of the product items that are sold. Businesses that
sell services — such as a law firm or an architectural firm — need an invoice
that appropriately describes these services. Businesses that sell both prod-
ucts and services need a blend of attributes.
Fortunately, QuickBooks lets you choose the invoice form that best matches
your business. To choose an invoice form, display the Create Invoices window
by choosing the Customers➪Create Invoices command. When QuickBooks

Customizing an Invoice Form
138
displays the Create Invoices window, use the Form Template drop-down list
box, which appears in the top-right portion of the window, to choose the
invoice form that you want. This drop-down list box provides choice such as 
a product invoice, a service invoice, or a professional invoice. Choose the
invoice form template that seems to best match your business. QuickBooks
redraws the Create Invoices window when you choose a new invoice form
template. This means that you can see what an invoice form template looks
like simply by choosing an option from the Form Template drop-down list box.
Customizing an Invoice Form
Although you can choose a predefined invoice form template for your
invoices, QuickBooks gives you more flexibility than that. You can also create
custom invoice form templates to design an invoice that looks just the way
you want. To do this, you can start with one of the basic invoice form tem-
plates and then customize it so that it perfectly matches your requirements.
Choosing a template to customize
To choose a template to customize, display the Create Invoices window. You
can do this by choosing the Customers➪Create Invoices command. Next,
click the Customize button. QuickBooks displays the Basic Customization
dialog box, shown in Figure 1-1.
Figure 1-1:
The Basic
Customiza-
tion dialog
box.

Invoicing Customers
Customizing an Invoice Form

You may need to maximize the Create Invoices window in order to see the
Customize button.
To identify which invoice form template you want to customize, click the
Manage Templates button and then, when QuickBooks displays the Manage
Templates dialog box (see Figure 1-2), choose the invoice template you want
to customize. QuickBooks initially supplies a custom invoice template and a
finance charge template you can customize.
Alternatively, you can click one of these existing templates and then click
Copy to create and then customize one of these templates. When you click
OK, QuickBooks closes the Manage Templates dialog box and returns you to
the Basic Customization dialog box.
Easy invoice customizations
The Basic Customization dialog box, shown in Figure 1-1, provides you with
several easy-to-make invoice customization choices. As you make these 
customizations — and I describe how in the paragraphs that follow —
QuickBooks updates the Preview box shown on the right half of the Basic
Customization dialog box so you can see what your changes look like. But
first, I talk about how to make the changes.
Logo, please
To add a logo to your invoices, check the Use Logo box. Then when
QuickBooks displays the Select Image dialog box (not shown), use it to
Figure 1-2:
The
Manage
Templates
dialog box.

Customizing an Invoice Form
140
select the graphic image file that shows your logo. The Select Image dialog
box works like a standard Windows open file dialog box.
Color you beautiful
To add color to your invoices — say you’ve got a color printer and you don’t
care if you spend a small fortune on colored ink — select the color scheme
you want to use from the Select Color Scheme drop-down list box. Then click
the Apply Color Scheme button.
Fiddling with invoice fonts
You can choose the font that QuickBooks uses for the bits of text that go on
an invoice. Just select the bit of text you want from the Change Font For list
box and click the Change Font button. QuickBooks displays the Example
dialog box, shown in Figure 1-3. Use its Font, Font Style, and Size boxes to
specify what the selected bit of text should look like. The Example dialog
box includes a Sample box that shows how your font changes look. When
you complete your specification of the font, click OK.
Specifying Company & Transaction information
The Company & Transaction Information options, also shown in Figure 1-1,
let you indicate what information should appear on the form template. You
select the check box that corresponds to the bit of information. If you want
the company name to appear on the invoice form — this means you aren’t
using letterhead or preprinted invoice forms — select the Print Company
Name check box.
If you need to change some bit of company information, click the Update
Information button. QuickBooks then displays the Company Information
dialog box which you can use to edit or update your company name,
address, telephone number, and so on.

Reviewing the Additional Customization options
If you can’t create invoices that look exactly the way you want using the
options available on the Basic Customization window, shown in Figure 1-1,
your next step is to click the Additional Customization button. QuickBooks
displays the Additional Customization dialog box, as shown in Figure 1-4.
This dialog box gives you more control over both the information that
appears on your invoices and how invoices print.
Specifying Header information
The Header tab of the Additional Customization dialog box (see Figure 1-4)
lets you specify what information goes on the top portion of the Create
Invoices window and in the top area of an actual printed invoice form. This
information is called the header and provides the invoice number, the
invoice date, and the billing and shipping information. You can also choose
how information is labeled by filling in or editing the contents of the text
boxes. For example, the Default Title check boxes let you specify whether
the form title should appear on the screen version of the invoice (this would
be inside the Create Invoices window) and on the printed version of the
invoice. The Default Title text box lets you specify what the form title should
be. In a similar fashion, the Date check boxes let you specify whether the
date should appear on the screen and print versions of the invoice and what
label should be used to describe the invoice date. Figure 1-4, as you can see,
uses the clever descriptive text Date for this invoice date information.
Figure 1-4:
The Header
tab of the
Additional
Customiza-
tion dialog
box.

Customizing an Invoice Form
142
If you don’t need a particular piece of information on an invoice, leave the
Screen and Print check boxes for that bit of data deselected. This tells
QuickBooks that it should not include that piece of header information on
the window or print version of the invoice form.
Specifying Columns information
The columns portion of an invoice describes in detail the items for which 
an invoice bills. For example, product invoice columns describe the specific
products, including price and quantity; they also describe the items being
invoiced. A service invoice’s columns describe the specific services being
billed. As you may guess from looking closely at Figure 1-5, the Columns tab
of the Additional Customization dialog box looks like the Header tab. You
use the Screen and Print check boxes to indicate whether a particular piece
of column-level information should appear as a column on the Create
Invoices window or on the actual created invoice. Similarly, you use the Title
text boxes to provide the descriptive labels that QuickBooks uses on the
Create Invoices window and on the printed invoice form. The only unusual
option shown on the Columns tab is the Order text boxes (see Figure 1-5).
The Order boxes let you indicate in what order (from left to right) the
column should appear. If the item number or code should appear in the first
column on the left, for example, you enter the value 1 in the Item Order box.
The Header and Columns tabs let you make changes to your invoice forms,
but don’t get too tense about making perfect changes the first time. You can
easily see exactly how your changes look by using the Preview box (if your
eyesight is better than mine) or by clicking OK and then carefully reviewing
the new version of the Create Invoices window. If you realize that you’ve

143
made an error — perhaps you’ve used the wrong bit of descriptive text or
you’ve incorrectly ordered the columns — you can customize your invoice
again and thereby fix your earlier mistakes.
Some versions of QuickBooks may include a tab for specifying how the
columns on a progress billing invoice look and work. This tab, called the
Prog Cols tab, looks and works very much like the Columns tab.
Specifying Footer information
The Footer tab of the Additional Customization dialog box lets you specify
what information appears on the Create Invoices window beneath the
columns area and on the actual printed invoice beneath the columns area.
As Figure 1-6 indicates, the footer information includes a customer message,
the invoice total, payments and credit information, a balance due field, and,
optionally, a longer text box. You work with the Footer tab in the same
manner as you work with other tabs. If you want some bit of information to
appear, select the Screen check box and the Print check box. To change the
bit of text that QuickBooks uses, edit the contents of the Title text box.
Specifying Print information
The Print tab of the Additional Customization dialog box, shown in Figure 1-7,
lets you exercise a bit of control over how QuickBooks prints invoices that
use the template you have customized. For example, the radio buttons at the
top of tab let you specify that when printing this particular invoice template,
QuickBooks should use the regular old invoice printer settings or, alterna-
Figure 1-6:
The Footer
tab of the
Additional
Customiza-
tion dialog
box.

Customizing an Invoice Form
144
tively, that it should use other, special print settings. The Print settings also
let you tell QuickBooks how it should number the pages of a multiple-page
invoice.
You can return all the customized invoice settings to their default condition
by clicking the Default button. When you do this, however, you remove any
changes or customizations that you’ve made.
Working with the Layout Designer tool
Okay. Perhaps you’ve used the Basic Customization window to make some
changes to your invoice’s appearance. And you haven’t been satisfied.
Maybe you’ve gone the extra mile and noodled around with the Additional
Customization window to make further changes. And maybe even that hasn’t
left you happy with the appearance of your invoice.
Do you have any additional recourse? Are you stuck with an invoice that
doesn’t look right? That doesn’t work for your organization? Heck no!
If you click the Layout Designer button, which is available in both the Basic
Customization and Additional Customization dialog boxes, QuickBooks dis-
plays the Layout Designer window, as shown in Figure 1-8. The Layout
Designer window lets you move invoice information around on the actual
printed invoice. Your best bet for learning to work with the Layout Designer
tool is to experiment with it. My recommendation is that you create an exam-
ple invoice form template — something you don’t really care about — and
then use this new invoice form template for some goofing around.

Here are some of the things that you may want to try:
✦Moving and resizing objects: You can move and resize objects on the
form pretty easily. To move some bit of the form, first select the bit by
clicking it. Then use the arrow keys or drag the mouse to move the
selected bit. You can resize the selected bit in a similar way. Resize the
selected object by dragging the black squares (called resizing handles)
that show the object is selected. When moving and resizing invoice form
objects, keep two points in mind:
• You can select the Show Envelope Window check box to have
QuickBooks draw envelope windows on the invoice form to show
you where these appear. You want to have envelope windows shown
to make sure that your customized invoice still has its address infor-
mation showing through.
• You can click the Grid button to display the Grid and Snap Settings
dialog box. This dialog box provides two check boxes where you can
indicate whether QuickBooks should use a grid (those are the dots
you see) to more accurately line up invoice objects on the form. The
Grid And Snap Settings dialog box also includes a Snap To Grid box so
you can tell QuickBooks that it should make gridlines sticky — sticky
gridlines automatically attract invoice objects so that you can more

The Layout
Designer
window.

Customizing an Invoice Form
146
easily line up the objects against the gridlines. The Grid And Snap
Settings dialog box also includes a Grid Spacing box that you can use
to specify how wide or narrow QuickBooks should draw gridlines.
✦Selecting objects: You can select multiple objects on the invoice by
dragging the mouse. To do so, click at a point above the upper-leftmost
object that you want to select and drag the mouse to a point that is just
below the lower-rightmost object that you want to select. As you drag
the mouse from one corner to the other, QuickBooks draws a rectangle.
Any object that’s inside this rectangle when you release the mouse gets
selected.
✦Resizing multiple objects: You can change the height, width, and size of
multiple selected objects by clicking the Make Same Width, Make Same
Height, and Make Same Size buttons. To use these Make Same buttons,
you first select the objects that you want to make the same.
✦Changing column widths: You can change the width of columns in the
column area of the invoice form by clicking the Column object. After 
you do this and QuickBooks selects the columns area, drag the column
divider line left or right to resize the column. Note that if you make
column 1 narrower, QuickBooks makes column 2 wider to take up the
space. Also note that you can resize the entire column area in the
manner described in the preceding point.
✦Positioning text within fields: If you click an invoice object and then
click the Properties button, QuickBooks displays the Properties dialog
box, shown in Figure 1-9. The Properties dialog box includes a Text tab
that lets you specify how text should appear within an invoice object
area. The Properties dialog box also includes a Border tab that lets you
specify whether QuickBooks should draw a border along the edges of
the invoice object.
✦Changing fonts: You can change the font used for the selected object by
clicking the Properties button, clicking the Text tab of the Properties
dialog box, and then clicking the Font button that appears on this tab.
QuickBooks displays the Example dialog box (shown earlier in the chap-
ter in Figure 1-4). The Example dialog box lets you choose a font, font
style, a point size, and special effects, such as strikeout, underlining, 
and color.
✦Adjusting margins: If you click the Margins button, QuickBooks displays
the Margins dialog box, which includes a Top, Bottom, Left, and Right
text box that you use to specify the margin around the invoice. The
default or initial margin settings equal half an inch.

Center a selected object on an invoice form by clicking the Center button to
activate the Layout Designer. You can click the Zoom In and Zoom Out but-
tons to see more or less detail. If you want to undo your most recent change,
click Undo. Or, click the Redo button to undo your last undo option.
After you use the Layout Designer to make whatever changes are appropri-
ate to your new invoice form template, click OK to save your changes.
Invoicing a Customer
To invoice a customer, use the Create Invoices window to identify the cus-
tomer and specify the amount that the customer owes. To display the Create
Invoices window, choose the Customers➪Create Invoices command. When
you do, QuickBooks displays a Create Invoices window like the one shown in
Figure 1-10. Note, however, that the Create Invoices window you see may not
look exactly like the one shown in Figure 1-10. As previously described, you
can use more than one type of invoice form. You can also choose to customize
an invoice form so that it perfectly matches your business requirements. In
the following steps, I describe, generally, how to invoice a customer. The spe-
cific steps that you take may be ever-so-slightly different if you’re working with
a different invoice form template.
In Figure 1-10, I closed the Open Window List to provide more room for the
Create Invoices window. You can close your Open Window List by clicking its
close box (the small box marked with an X that appears in the upper-right
corner of the list. To redisplay the Open Window List after you’ve closed it,
choose View➪Open Window List.
Figure 1-9:
The
Properties
dialog box.

Invoicing a Customer
148
After you display the Create Invoices window, take the following steps to
invoice a customer:
1. Identify the customer and, if appropriate, the job.
To do this, select the customer or customer and job combination from
the Customer:Job drop-down list box. Don’t worry about this “job” busi-
ness if you aren’t familiar with it. I describe how jobs work in Book IV,
Chapter 5. You should, however, understand how customers work. You
must identify the specific customer that you are invoicing. You do this
by selecting the customer from the Customer:Job list box. If the cus-
tomer is a new customer that you haven’t yet invoiced or described in
the Customer List, enter a brief name for the customer — like an abbre-
viation of the customer’s business name — in the Customer:Job list box.
QuickBooks then indicates that the customer doesn’t yet exist on the
Customer List and asks whether you want to add the customer; indicate
that you do. When prompted, supply the customer information that
QuickBooks requests.
For more information about adding customers in QuickBooks, refer to
Book II, Chapter 2.
You can also classify an invoice as fitting into a particular category by
using the Class drop-down list. Don’t worry at this point about using
Figure 1-10:
The Create
Invoices
window.

Book III

Invoicing Customers
Invoicing a Customer

class tracking. Book IV, Chapter 4 describes how you can use classes to
get a better handle on your business’s finances.
2. Confirm or provide new invoice header information.
After you identify the customer, QuickBooks fills out the Date, Invoice, Bill
To, and, possibly, the Ship To fields. You probably don’t need to change
any of this information. You should review the information shown in these
boxes to make sure that it is correct. For example, you wouldn’t typically
invoice someone unless you have already shipped the product or the
service has already been provided. Therefore, you probably should con-
firm that the invoice date follows the product shipment date or the provi-
sion of service date. You may also want to confirm, for example, that the
Ship To address is correct.
3. Provide or confirm the Invoice field information.
Invoices include field information that records items such as purchase
order numbers, payment terms, ship date, and shipping method. You
should make sure that whatever QuickBooks shows in these field boxes
is correct. If a customer has provided you with a purchase order number,
for example, enter that purchase order number into the P.O. Number box.
Confirm that the payment terms shown in the Terms box are correct.
Confirm that the date shown in the Ship field is correct. Not all these
fields need to be filled for every invoice, but you want to supply any
information that makes it easier for a customer to pay an invoice, tie an
invoice to his or her purchasing records, and figure out how and when an
item is being shipped.
4. Describe the items sold.
How the columns area of your invoice looks really depends on whether
you are selling products or services. Figure 1-11 shows the columns 
area for a product. The columns area for a service looks simpler because
you don’t provide much information when describing service items. In
the columns area, you want to describe each item — each product or
service — for which an invoice bills. To do this, you use a single row for
each item. The first item that you want to bill for, then, goes into row 1
of the columns area. For each item, you enter the quantity ordered, the
code for the item, and a price or rate. QuickBooks retrieves an item
description from your Item List and places this data into the description
column. QuickBooks also calculates the amount billed for the item by
multiplying the quantity by the price or rate. You can, however, edit
both the Description and the Amount fields. If you edit the Amount field,
QuickBooks recalculates the Price Each field by dividing the amount by
the quantity.
To enter additional items onto the invoice, enter additional rows. Each
item that you want to bill for — each item that should appear as a sepa-
rate charge on the invoice — appears as a row in the columns area. If you
want to invoice a customer for some product, one line in the columns area
of the invoice is used for that product. If you want to charge a customer

Invoicing a Customer
150
for freight, one line of the invoice area describes that freight charge. If you
want to bill a customer for sales tax, again, one line or row of the columns
area shows that sales tax charge.
Discounts represent a tricky line item to include on an invoice. For this
reason, I provide an example of how a discount item appears on an
invoice. Assume that you want to grant some customer a 25 percent dis-
count. In order to do this, you now know (or should be able to guess)
that you include a discount line item on your invoice. However, although
QuickBooks includes a discount item on its Item List, a discount percent-
age can be applied only to the previous line item on the invoice. For this
reason, QuickBooks also supplies a subtotal line item. You use a subtotal
line item to total all the previous items shown on the invoice. By subto-
taling all the product items shown on the invoice in Figure 1-11, for
example, the business can grant the customer a 25 percent discount on
these products.
Click to check spelling.
A subtotal line enables QuickBooks to calculate a discount.

5. Use the Customer Message box at the bottom of the Create Invoices
window to supply a customer message that appears at the bottom of
the invoice.
If you’ve created a custom invoice form template that includes other
footer information, these footer boxes also appear at the bottom of the
Create Invoices window. You can use them to collect and transfer addi-
tional footer information.
6. (Optional) Check your spelling.
If you click the Spelling button, which appears along the top edge of the
Create Invoices window, QuickBooks checks the spelling of the words
that you’ve used on the invoice. If QuickBooks finds no spelling errors,
QuickBooks displays a message telling you that the spelling check is
complete. If QuickBooks finds a spelling error — product code abbrevia-
tions often produce spelling errors in QuickBooks — QuickBooks dis-
plays the Check Spelling On Form dialog box, shown in Figure 1-12. (In
Figure 1-12, I’ve misspelled the word “Yellow” much to the dismay of my
editor.) You can use the Change To box to correct your spelling error —
if it actually is a spelling error. You can select one of the suggested
replacements from the Suggestions list box by clicking the suggestion
and then clicking the Replace button. You can replace all occurrences 
of the misspelling by clicking the Replace All button. If the word that
QuickBooks says is misspelled is actually correctly spelled, you can
click the Ignore button to tell QuickBooks to ignore this word or the
Ignore All button to tell QuickBooks to ignore all occurrences of this
word on the invoice form.
If you use terms that are always popping up as misspelled words, at least
in QuickBooks, you can click the Add button that appears on the Check
Spelling on Form dialog box. Clicking the Add button tells QuickBooks to
Figure 1-12:
The Check
Spelling on
Form dialog
box.

Invoicing a Customer
152
add the word to its spelling dictionary. After you’ve added a word to the
QuickBooks spelling dictionary, QuickBooks doesn’t see the word as mis-
spelled. Also note that you can click the Options button to display the
Spelling Options dialog box. The Spelling Options dialog box includes
check boxes that you can use to turn on or off certain types of spell
checking logic. For example, the Spelling Options dialog box includes a
check box that you can select to tell QuickBooks to always check the
spelling of forms before printing, saving, or sending the form. The
Spelling Options dialog box also includes check boxes to tell QuickBooks
it should ignore certain sorts of words, such as those that use numbers,
those that are all uppercase, and those that are mixed case.
7. Click either the Save & Close button or the Save & New button to save
your invoice.
Click the Save & Close button if you want to save the invoice and close
the Create Invoices window. You use the Save & New button if you want
to save the invoice and then enter another invoice into the blank version
of the Create Invoices window.
Click the Ship button to display the QuickBooks Shipping Manager
window, which lets you automate some of the steps in shipping pack-
ages using Federal Express or UPS. If you use Federal Express or UPS,
therefore, you may want to experiment with this tool.
One internal control problem within QuickBooks that I hear CPAs com-
plain about over and over is that QuickBooks allows someone to print a
form without saving it. This seems innocuous enough, but this little idio-
syncrasy can cause serious problems for a business owner. Here is why
this “printing without saving” option becomes dangerous: A dishonest
employee can create an invoice form, print the invoice form, send the
invoice form to a customer, and then not save the invoice form. At this
point, a customer has what appears to be a valid invoice from your firm
and probably will pay that invoice. If the nefarious employee can inter-
cept the check that pays that invoice, he can then deposit that check
into a personal checking account, and you are none the wiser.
In order to prevent or at least minimize this opportunity for employee
theft, you want to separate the capability to create an invoice form from
the capability to print an invoice form. Book VII, Chapter 2 describes
how you do this as part of setting up user passwords for segregation of
duty. In this scenario, by the way, the people who create invoices (such
as sales people or accounting clerks) don’t actually print invoices.
Somebody else — perhaps even you, the owner — prints the invoices
and then arrange to have them distributed. Also note that you can use
QuickBooks’ e-mail invoices and batch printing to greatly simplify the
work of sending out invoices. So you aren’t actually creating that much
extra work for yourself.

Billing for Time

To page through invoices that you’ve already created, click the Previous
and Next buttons. Or, click the Find button and use the Find Invoices
dialog box to describe the invoice that you want to locate.
Billing for Time
Most of the time, line items that appear on an invoice are items that you
have described in the item list and then quantify directly on the invoice.
However, in some service businesses, you may actually sell many units of
the same item. For example, a lawyer may sell hours or partial hours of legal
advice. This may be all that she sells. A CPA may sell hours of consulting or
accounting or tax preparation work.
In these circumstances, you don’t want to have an invoice go out to the cus-
tomer with one line on it that says, for example, “legal services, 100 hours,
$20,000.” You instead want an invoice that details each of the tasks that the
lawyer performed: estate planning for 1.5 hours, review of a contract for 
4 hours, preparation of a new real estate lease for 2 hours, and so forth. To
provide this level of detail — detail that is really beneath the item — you use
the QuickBooks Time Tracking feature.
QuickBooks supplies two methods for tracking the time spent that will be
billed on an invoice as an item. You can use the weekly time sheet or you can
time or record individual activities. I briefly describe how both time tracking
methods work — neither is difficult. Professional service providers — such
as accountants, attorneys, consultants, architects, and so on — should con-
sider using one of these features to make sure that they accurately keep
good records of the time spent working for a client or customer.
Using a weekly timesheet
To use the weekly timesheet method, choose the Customers➪Enter Time➪
Use Weekly Timesheet command. QuickBooks displays the Weekly Timesheet
window, shown in Figure 1-13. To use the Weekly Timesheet window, first use
the Name box to identify the employee or vendor or other person performing
the service. You should be able to select this person’s name from the Name
box. If you can’t select a person’s name from the Name box, enter the
person’s name into the box, and then, when prompted, tell QuickBooks which
list (employee, vendor, or other names) should be added. After you have
added the name of the person performing the work, use the columns of the
Weekly Timesheet window to describe the customer or job for whom the
work has been performed, the service code, a brief description or note, the
class (if you are tracking classes), and then the hours spent per day. You can
enter as many lines onto the Weekly Timesheet window as you want. Each
line appears separately on an invoice. The notes information appears in the
description area of the invoice. For this reason, you want to use appropriate
and descriptive notes.

Billing for Time
154
Timing single activities
If you want to record service activities as they occur, choose the Customers➪
Enter Time➪Time/Enter Single Activity command. QuickBooks displays the
Time/Enter Single Activity window, as shown in Figure 1-14.
To time or record a single activity, record the activity date into the Date 
box. Use the Name box to identify the person performing the service. In the
Customer:Job box, identify the customer or the job for which the service is
being performed. Select the appropriate service item from the Service Item
drop-down list box. If you’re tracking classes, predictably, you can also use
the Class drop-down list box to classify the activity. The Notes box should be
used to record a brief appropriate description of the service. This descrip-
tion appears on the invoice, so be thoughtful about what you write. After
describing or providing this general information about the service, you have
two ways to record the time spent on the service:
✦Manually record time: You can manually record the time spent on an
activity by using the Duration box to enter the time. If you spent 10 min-
utes, for example, enter 0:10 into the Duration box. If you spent 3 hours
and 40 minutes, enter 3:40 into the Duration box.
Figure 1-13:
The Weekly

Book III
Chapter 1
Invoicing Customers
Billing for Time
155
✦Have QuickBooks record the time: You can also have QuickBooks record
the time that you spent on the activity. Just click the Start button in the
Duration box when you start the activity, and click the Stop button when
you stop the activity. If you want to pause the timer (while you take a
phone call, for example) click the Pause button.
After you describe the activity you’re performing in the Time/Enter Single
Activity window, click the Save & New or Save & Close button to save the
activity information.
Verify that the Billable check box is selected. The Billable check box appears
in the upper-right corner of the Time/Enter Single Activity window. By select-
ing the Billable box, you tell QuickBooks that it should keep this record of a
billable activity for later inclusion on an invoice.
You can use the Previous and Next buttons that appear at the top of the Time/
Enter Single Activity window to page back and forth through your records of
activity timing. Note, too, that the Spelling button is also available on the
Time/Enter Single Activity window. You can, therefore, click the Spelling
button to spell check the notes description that you enter — which is a good
idea because this information will later appear on an invoice.

156
Including billable time on an invoice
To add billable time and cost to an invoice, create the invoice in the usual
way, as I describe previously. The only difference when you are adding bill-
able time is that you click the Time/Costs button (in the lower-right area of
Figure 1-15). When you do this, QuickBooks displays the Choose Billable
Time and Costs dialog box shown in Figure 1-16. The Time tab of the Choose
Billable Time and Costs dialog box shows each of the times that you’ve
recorded for a customer. To add these times to the invoice, click the Use
column for the time. Or, if you want to select all the times, click the Select All
button. Then click OK. QuickBooks then adds each of these billable times as
lines to the invoice. Figure 1-15 shows how billable time information appears
on the Create Invoices window.
As Figure 1-16 suggests, you can click the Items, Expenses, or Mileage tabs to
see lists of the items, out-of-pocket expenses, or business miles incurred on
behalf of a customer. You add charges to an invoice for these sorts of things
in the same way as you add charges for time. I talk about how to record busi-
ness miles and out-of-pocket expenses that you want to charge to customers
in Chapter 2 of this book. By the way, the very last line of the invoice shown
in Figure 1-15 bills the client for the out-of-pocket expenses incurred for a
luncheon.

E-Mailing Invoices

Printing Invoices
You can print invoices and then mail the printed invoices in a couple of dif-
ferent ways:
✦You can print individual invoices by clicking the Print button at the top
of the Create Invoices window.
✦You can also print a batch of invoices by clicking the arrow button next
to the Print button, choosing Print Batch from the menu that QuickBooks
displays, and then using the Select Invoices to Print dialog box (which
QuickBooks displays) to select the To Be Printed Invoices for printing.
After you select the invoices that you want to print by clicking them, you
click OK.
The menu that QuickBooks displays when you click the Print arrow button
includes a Preview command. You can choose the Preview command to see
a preview version of the printed invoice.
E-Mailing Invoices
You can e-mail an invoice from QuickBooks. To do this, click the Send button
and choose the Mail Invoice command from the menu that QuickBooks dis-
plays. (The Send button that appears at the top of the Create Invoice
screen.) When QuickBooks displays the Send Invoice dialog box, as shown in
Figure 1-17, provide the e-mail address and, optionally, a new e-mail mes-
sage. Then click the Send Now button to send the invoice. Alternatively, you
can click the Send Later button to batch your e-mail invoices for later deliv-
ery. To send all your invoices in a batch later, you click the arrow button
next to the Send button at the top of the Create Invoices window and choose
the Send Batch command from the menu that QuickBooks displays.
Figure 1-16:
The Choose
Billable
Time and
Costs dialog
box.

Recording a Sales Receipt
158
You can also use the Send Invoice dialog box to send the invoice to
QuickBooks and then have the QuickBooks folks mail a paper copy to the
customer or client. To do this, mark the Mail through QuickBooks button.
QuickBooks then tells you about this extra service and, if you decide to go
for it, steps you through the sign-up process.
Recording a Sales Receipt
To bill a customer, you create an invoice as I describe earlier in this chapter.
To record the fact that you sold the customer some item — presumably this
is because the customer simultaneously purchases and pays for the item or
service — you don’t invoice the customer. Rather, you create a sales receipt.
A sales receipt looks very, very similar to an invoice. However, it doesn’t
include shipping information (because that’s irrelevant) and it lets you
record the amount that the customer pays.
To record a sales receipt when it is appropriate, choose the
Customers➪Enter Sales Receipts command and then follow these steps:
1. In the Enter Sales Receipts window, shown in Figure 1-18, use the
Customer:Job box to describe the customer or, optionally, the cus-
tomer and job.
Use the Class drop-down list box to identify the class if you are perform-
ing class tracking.
Figure 1-17:
The Send
Invoice
dialog box.

Book III
Chapter 1
Invoicing Customers
Recording a Sales Receipt
159
If you have questions about how the Customer:Job box works or how
the Class box works, refer to the discussion on this topic earlier in the
chapter.
You can customize a sales receipt in the same basic way that you cus-
tomize an invoice form. Go back to the section on this topic located at
the beginning of this chapter.
2. Provide the sales receipt header info.
A sales receipt, like an invoice, includes some header information.
Specifically, the sales receipt includes a sales receipt date and a sales
number. The sales receipt also includes a Sold To box, which shows the
customer name and address. You should confirm that this information is
correct — and it should be if you are recording timely sales receipts and
have an up-to-date Customer List.
3. Use the items column to describe the items that you are selling.
The items column on a sales receipt works the exact same way as the
items column on an invoice. Therefore, rather than repeat myself, go
back to the earlier discussion of how this column works.
Figure 1-18:
The Enter
Sales
Receipts
window.

Recording a Sales Receipt
160
4. If you want, enter a customer message in the footer area of the Enter
Sales Receipts window.
If you have added other footer information to the Enter Sales Receipts
window — this would be because you have customized the sales receipt
form template — you can include that information, too.
5. Describe where the sales proceeds go.
At the bottom-left corner of the Enter Sales Receipts window is a Deposit
To drop-down list box. Use this box to indicate what you do with the
money that you receive from this sale. If you immediately deposit the
amount into a bank account, select the account into which you will
deposit the check. If you want to batch this receipt with a bunch of
other receipts — maybe you are going to deposit the day’s receipts
together in one lump sum — select Group with Other Undeposited Fund.
If you don’t see the Deposit To box, you may have indicated (perhaps
even inadvertently) during the setup that you just want QuickBooks to
assume funds are deposited into an undeposited funds account. This
probably works just fine. If you do want to specify an account where
sales proceeds go when you record the sales receipt, choose the
Edit➪Preferences command, click the Sales and Customers icon, click
the Company Preferences tab, and then unmark the Use Undeposited
Funds as a default deposit to account.
Book III, Chapter 4 talks about making deposits of undeposited funds.
6. Click the Save & Close or Save & New button to save the sales receipt.
These buttons work the same way for the Enter Sales Receipts window
as they do for the Create Invoices window.
7. (Optional) To print a copy of the receipt, click the Print button.
The Previous, Next, Find, Spelling, History, and Time/Cost buttons on
the Enter Sales Receipts window work identically to the same buttons on
the Create Invoices window.
Both the Create Invoices window (described earlier in the chapter) and
the Enter Sales Receipts window (just described) include a To Be Printed
check box in the footer area. If you select this check box, QuickBooks
adds the invoice or sales receipt to its list of unprinted invoices or sales
receipts. You can print invoices and sales receipts that appear on either
side of these lists by choosing the File➪Print Forms command and then
either the Invoices or Sales Receipt command. There’s also a To Be
E-mailed check box that you can mark if you want to later e-mail a receipt.
(See the earlier discussion, “E-Mailing Invoices.”)

Book III
Chapter 1
Invoicing Customers
Recording Credit Memos
161
Recording Credit Memos
Credit memos show when a customer no longer owes you money or when
you now owe a customer money. Credit memos may occur because your cus-
tomer returns items that you previously sold to him or her. Credit memos
may also occur because you issue a customer a refund for some other good
reason — perhaps the product wasn’t of the quality that you usually sell, or
a service wasn’t provided in the manner in which it should have been.
To record a credit memo, first display the Create Credit Memos/Refunds
window by choosing Customers➪Create Credit Memos/Refunds command.
Then, follow these steps:
1. Identify the customer or the customer and the job in the Customer:
Job box.
Use the Class box for class tracking if you’ve decided to do that (see
Figure 1-19). If you have questions about how either of these boxes
works, refer to the earlier discussion about these two boxes. These
boxes work the same way for credit memos as they do for invoices.
Figure 1-19:
The Create
Credit
Memos/
Refunds
window.

Receiving Customer Payments
162
The Create Credit Memos/Refunds window supplies several buttons that
work the same way here as they do on the Create Invoices window:
Previous, Next, Print, Find, Spelling, and History. For information about
how to use these buttons if you have questions, refer to the earlier chap-
ter section on this topic.
As is the case with invoices, you can create custom credit memo forms.
To do this, you click the Customize button. Customizing a credit memo
works the same way as customizing an invoice form. Refer to the earlier
chapter section on this topic if you have questions about how to cus-
tomize a credit memo.
2. Provide the credit memo date, credit memo number, and confirm cus-
tomer information.
Credit memos, like invoices and sales receipts, include a header. This
header includes the transaction date, number, and the customer infor-
mation. You should confirm that the credit memo header information is
correct on the Create Credit Memos/Refunds window. If it isn’t, edit the
default information that QuickBooks uses to fill the Create Credit
Memos/Refunds window.
3. In the columns area of the Create Credit Memos/Refunds window,
describe the reason for the credit memo.
If the customer returned items, for example, use the columns to
describe these items and the original price that you are refunding.
4. Click either Save & Close or Save & New to save the credit memo.
5. Click the Print button to print the credit memo.
Note, too, that you can also print credit memos in a batch. Obviously,
after you print credit memos, you need to distribute them.
At the time you save your credit memo, QuickBooks allows you to indi-
cate what you want to do with the credit memo: retain it for later applica-
tion to a customer invoice, immediately apply it to a customer invoice, or
issue a refund check. You apply credit memos to invoices as described in
the next section of the chapter. You write a refund check in the same way
as you write other checks. Book III, Chapter 4 describes writing checks.
Receiving Customer Payments
When a customer pays an invoice that you have previously sent, you choose
the Customers➪Receive Payments command to record the payment. To use
this command to record a payment, choose the command and then follow
these steps:
1. After QuickBooks displays the Receive Payments window, as shown in
Figure 1-20, use the Received From box to identify the customer
paying you.

Book III
Chapter 1
Invoicing Customers
Receiving Customer Payments
163
2. Record the payment information in the Date, Amount, Reference # box,
Pmt. Method box, and Card No. and Exp. Date boxes (if appropriate).
3. Identify the invoice or invoices paid.
QuickBooks lists the open invoices for the customer in the columns area
of the Receive Payments window. You can identify which invoices a cus-
tomer payment pays by clicking the invoices that you see listed.
4. Apply any credit memos to open invoices as you apply the payment.
Click the Discounts & Credits button. QuickBooks displays the Discounts
and Credits dialog box, as shown in Figure 1-21. To apply a credit to the
selected invoices, click the Credits tab and then select credit that you
want to apply.
5. Apply any discounts to the open invoices and click Done.
Discounts work like credits. In fact, you use the same dialog box (refer to
Figure 1-21).
6. Select the account to which you want to deposit the check or the
Group with Other Undeposited Funds option from the Deposit To box
to indicate whether you immediately deposit the payment or batch
the payment with a bunch of other payments that you later deposit.
If you have a question about how these buttons work, refer to the earlier
discussion of these buttons in the section “Recording a Sales Receipt.”
Figure 1-20:
The Receive
Payments
window.

Assessing Finance Charges
164
7. Click the Save & Close or Save & New button to save the customer
payment information.
Click the Get Online Pmts button to receive online payment information
for a customer. The Get Online Pmts button appears only if you are using
either online billing or online billing. An earlier discussion describes
how online billing and deluxe online billing work.
To see a list of the payments that have been applied to an invoice, click
the History button.
Assessing Finance Charges
You can tell QuickBooks to assess finance charges on overdue customer
invoices. To do this, you first set up the finance charge calculation rules.
After you’ve done this, you can easily assess finance charges on overdue
amounts by choosing the QuickBooks command.
Setting up finance charge rules
To set up the finance charge rules, choose the Edit➪Preferences command.
When QuickBooks displays the Preferences dialog box, click the Finance
Charge icon and then the Company Preferences tab. The Preferences dialog
box at this point should look like the one shown in Figure 1-22. To tell
QuickBooks how it should calculate the finance charges, enter the annual
interest rate that you’ll use for calculating charges into the Annual Interest
Rate (%) box. Enter the minimum finance charge amount that you assess
Figure 1-21:
The
Discounts
and Credits
dialog box.

Book III
Chapter 1
Invoicing Customers
Assessing Finance Charges
165
into the Minimum Finance Charge box. If you want to create a grace period,
enter the number of grace period days into the Grace Period (Days) box. Use
the Finance Charge Account drop-down list box to specify the QuickBooks
income account to which finance charge revenue should be credited. Select
the Assess Finance Charges on Overdue Finance Charges check box if you
want to charge finance charges on finance charges. Finally, use the Calculate
Charges From radio buttons — Due Date and Invoice/Billed Date — to spec-
ify the date from which finance charges should be calculated. After you’ve
provided this information, you can click OK to save your finance charge cal-
culation rules.
QuickBooks assumes that you don’t want to print finance charge invoices.
For this reason, the Mark Finance Charge Invoices to Be Printed check box is
not selected. Finance charges typically appear only on customer statements.
Calculating finance charges
After you set up the finance charge rules, you can easily assess finance
charges on overdue invoices. To do this, choose Customers➪Assess Finance
Charges. QuickBooks displays the Assess Finance Charges window, as shown
in Figure 1-23. This window lists all the overdue invoices that customers owe
you and, based on your finance charge calculation rules, calculates a finance
charge. To assess the finance charge to a particular customer, click the
Assess field for the customer. (By default, QuickBooks assumes that you
want to assess finance charges whenever a customer’s account is past due.)
If you don’t want to assess finance charges to a particular customer, remove
the check mark from the Assess field by clicking it. After you’ve identified
which customers should be assessed finance charges, click the Assess
Charges button. QuickBooks, essentially, creates new invoices for each of
these customers. These new invoices charge the customer a finance fee.

Customer Odds and Ends
In this chapter, I discuss most of the important commands on the Customers
menu. However, the Customers menu supplies several other commands that
are noteworthy — perhaps even useful — and deserve discussion some-
where in this book. For this reason, I want to briefly describe the other com-
mands available on the Customers menu:
✦Customer Center: Displays the Customer Center window, which includes
information about your customer list, including the amounts that your
customers owe.
✦Enter Statement Charges: Displays the Accounts Receivable Register.
You shouldn’t need to use this command. You can, however, use this
command to add amounts to the accounts receivable for a particular
customer. The amounts then appear on the customer’s next statement.
✦Create Statements: Displays a window that you can use to create a set of
monthly statements for customers. Such statements show the amounts
that a customer owes, invoices created for the month, credit memos
issued for the month, and payments made during the month.

✦Add Credit Card Processing: Displays a submenu of commands that
you can use to deal with credit card payments and credit card billing.
QuickBooks, by the way, supports credit card merchant accounts and
makes it easy to accept credit cards from customers. This is something
you may want to do. You should visit the QuickBooks Web site and find
out the details.
✦Item List: Displays the Item List, which shows the items that may be
included on the invoice or credit memo.
✦Change Item Prices: Lets you change the prices of a bunch of different
items at one time—for example, increasing every price by 5 percent.

Chapter 2: Paying Vendors
In This Chapter
 Working with purchase orders
 Recording the receipt of items
 Entering bills
 Paying bills
 Using the other Vendor menu commands
You can make the process of tracking vendor information as simple or as
sophisticated as you like. In this chapter, I assume that you’re going for
sophisticated. However, you can make vendor management simpler by not
using purchase orders or an accounts payable system.
You decide whether to use purchase orders and whether to track accounts
payable (amounts that you owe vendors) as part of setting up QuickBooks.
You can also later change your decision about using purchase orders or
accounts payables. To do this, you choose the Edit➪Preferences command.
For more information, refer to Book II, Chapter 3.
Creating a Purchase Order
A purchase order serves a simple purpose: It tells some vendor that you want
to purchase some item. In fact, a purchase order is a contract to purchase.
Many small businesses don’t use purchase orders. But when they grow to a
certain size, many businesses decide to use them because purchase orders
become permanent records of items that you’ve ordered. What’s more,
using purchase orders often formalizes the purchasing process in a com-
pany. For example, you may decide that nobody in your firm can purchase
anything that costs more than $100 unless he gets a purchase order. If only
you can issue purchase orders, you’ve effectively controlled purchasing
activities through this procedure.
A real purchase order
To use QuickBooks to create purchase orders, follow these steps:
1. Tell QuickBooks that you want to create a purchase order by choos-
ing Vendors➪Create Purchase Orders.

Creating a Purchase Order
170
QuickBooks displays the window shown in Figure 2-1.
If the Vendors menu doesn’t supply a Create Purchase Orders command,
QuickBooks doesn’t know that you want to create purchase orders.
Follow the instructions described in Book II, Chapter 3 to turn on the
purchase order feature.
2. Use the Vendor menu drop-down list box to identify the vendor from
whom you want to purchase the item.
The Vendor drop-down list box lists each of the vendors in your
Vendor List.
3. (Optional) Classify the purchase using the Class drop-down list box.
For more information about how you can use classes, read Book IV,
Chapter 4.
4. (Optional) Provide a different Ship To address in the Ship To drop-
down list box.
The Ship To drop-down list box displays a list of all your customers, 
vendors, and employees. You select the Ship To address by selecting
one of these other names. After you select an entry from the Ship To
list, QuickBooks fills in the Ship To address box with the appropriate
information.
Choose the vendor here.
Figure 2-1:
The Create
Purchase

window.

Book III
Chapter 2
Paying Vendors
Creating a Purchase Order
171
The Create Purchase Orders window supplies some standard and, I hope,
familiar buttons and boxes: Previous, Next, Print, Find, Spelling, History,
and Template. Because I spend quite a bit of time talking about these
buttons and boxes in Book III, Chapter 1, I don’t provide a redundant dis-
cussion of these buttons and boxes here. If you have questions about
what the Previous and Next buttons do, refer to Book III, Chapter 1.
5. Confirm the purchase order date.
Initially, QuickBooks puts the current system date into the Date box.
You should, however, confirm that the date that QuickBooks enters as
the purchase order date is correct. This is the contract date. Often, the
date sets contractual terms — such as the number of days within which
the item is to be shipped.
6. Confirm the purchase order number.
The purchase order number, or P.O. number, uniquely identifies the pur-
chase order document. QuickBooks sequentially numbers purchase
orders for you and places the appropriate number into the P.O. No. box.
The guess that QuickBooks makes about the right purchase order number
is usually correct. If it isn’t correct, you can enter a replacement number.
7. Confirm the vendor and ship to information.
The Vendor block and the Ship To block identify the vendor from whom
you are purchasing the item and the address to which you want the
vendor to send the shipment. This information should be correct if your
vendor list is up-to-date and you have correctly used the Ship To drop-
down list box to identify, if necessary, an alternative Ship To address.
Nevertheless, confirm that the information shown in these two address
blocks is correct. If the information isn’t correct, of course, fix it. You
can edit address block information by selecting the incorrect informa-
tion and then retyping whatever should be shown.
8. Describe each item that you want to order.
You use the columns of the Create Purchase Orders window to describe
in detail each item that you want to order as part of the purchase. Each
item goes on its own row. To describe an item that you want to purchase
from the vendor, you provide the following bits of information:
• Item: The Item column is where you record the unique item number
for the item that you want to buy. Remember that items need to be
entered, or described, in the Item List. Book II, Chapter 2 discusses
briefly how you go about setting up the Item List. The next chapter,
Book III, Chapter 3, talks in more detail about the Item List. The main
thing to know about the Item List is that anything that you want to
show on the invoice — or, for that matter, on a purchase order —
must be described in the item file.
• Description: In the Description column, you describe the item that
you select. You can also edit the Description field so that it makes
sense to customers or vendors.

Creating a Purchase Order
172
• Qty: The Qty column specifies the quantity of the item that you want.
Obviously, you enter the number of items that you want in this field.
• Rate: The Rate column specifies the price per unit or rate per unit for
the item. Note that QuickBooks uses different labels for this column
depending on the type of business that you’ve set up.
• Customer: The Customer column identifies the customer for whom
the item is being purchased.
• Class: In the Class column, you classify purchase order items at the
item level rather than at the purchase order level.
• Amount: The Amount column shows the total expended for the item.
QuickBooks will calculate the amount for you by multiplying the
quantity by the rate (or price). You can also edit the column amount.
In this case, QuickBooks adjusts the rate (or price) so that quantity
times rate always equals the amount.
You enter a description of each item that should be included on the pur-
chase order. This means, for example, that if you want to order six items
from a vendor, your purchase order should include six lines of information.
9. Print the purchase order.
The purpose of recording a purchase order into QuickBooks is to create
a formal record of a purchase. You almost always want to transmit this
purchase order to the vendor. The purchase order tells the vendor
exactly what you want to purchase and the price that you are willing to
pay. To print the purchase order, you can click the Print button. You can
also print purchase orders later in a batch; to do so, save all the pur-
chase orders that you want to create, and then choose the File➪Print
Forms➪Purchase Orders command.
10. Save the purchase order.
To save your purchase order, click either the Save & Close button or the
Save & New button. If you click the Save & New button, QuickBooks
saves that purchase order and redisplays an empty version of the Create
Purchase Orders window so you can record another purchase order.
Purchase order tips and tricks
Even though the last section details about all you need to know to create a
purchase order, I want to make a few more important observations:
✦Be aware that you can print without saving. As I note several times
throughout this book, QuickBooks allows you to print forms such as pur-
chase orders without actually saving the purchase order. This sometimes
creates an internal control risk. For example, someone can invoice a cus-
tomer or print a check without actually recording the invoice or check in
the QuickBooks system. Perhaps the risk isn’t quite as great with a pur-
chase order, but still, you definitely don’t want to be printing purchase

Book III
Chapter 2
Paying Vendors
Recording the Receipt of Items
173
orders, distributing them to vendors, and not saving them. Be aware that
you must remember to save your purchase order after you print it.
✦Not every purchase deserves a purchase order. If you’re not used to
working with purchase orders, it is easy to go overboard when you first
start using this handy tool. Nevertheless, keep in mind that not all pur-
chases warrant purchase orders. Typically, businesses use purchase
orders as a way to control and document purchases. In fact, many pur-
chases don’t really require a purchase order. Amounts that you’ve agreed
to purchase that are documented through standard contracts, such as
bills from the telephone company, the gas company, and your landlord,
don’t need purchase orders, obviously. In addition, modest purchases like
office supplies often don’t need purchase orders, either. You definitely
do need a way to control these expenditures, but purchase orders are
probably not the way to go. Other budgetary controls such as “approval
from the supervisor” or a simple budget often work just as well.
Recording the Receipt of Items
When you receive items from a vendor, you can record the receipt. You typi-
cally do this when you want to record the receipt of an item even before you
receive a bill for the item. For example, in any business with inventory, you
want to know exactly how much inventory you have in your warehouse or
on your store floor. You don’t want to wait to adjust your inventory records
for these purchases until you receive the invoice from the vendor. In this
scenario, you record when you receive items.
To record item receipts, follow these steps:
1. Choose the Vendors➪Receive Items command.
QuickBooks displays the Create Item Receipts window, as shown in
Figure 2-2.
2. Select the vendor from whom you’re receiving items from the Vendor
drop-down list box.
3. Select any P.O.s that you’re receiving items on.
If open purchase orders exist for the vendor, QuickBooks displays a
Message box. The Message box asks whether you want to receive items
against one of the open purchase orders. If the items that you receive
are items that you set up on a purchase order, click Yes. When Quick
Books displays the Open Purchase Orders dialog box — the dialog box
just lists open purchase orders — select the one that ordered the items
you are now receiving and then click OK. QuickBooks fills out the Items
tab of the Create Item Receipts window by using the information from
the purchase order. This automatic data entry of purchase order infor-
mation should save you time if the items that you’re receiving match
items on the purchase order.

Recording the Receipt of Items
174
4. Confirm the receipt date.
Use the Date field to confirm the date of receipt. As with the Date field in
other places in QuickBooks, enter the date in mm/dd/yyyy format. Or, you
can click the Calendar button that appears to the right of the Date field
and choose the date from the pop-up calendar that QuickBooks displays.
5. Use the Total box to identify the total value of the order received, if
available.
QuickBooks calculates this total for you by adding up the individual item
costs, so you can wait until later.
6. (Optional) Use a reference number.
You can use the Ref. No. field to provide a reference number. For exam-
ple, you may want to reference the vendor’s order number.
7. (Optional) Provide a memo description.
8. Describe the items received.
Use the Items tab to identify the items that you’ve received. The Items
tab of the Create Item Receipts window resembles and works like the
Items tab of the Create Purchase Order window, as described (briefly)
earlier in the chapter and (in some detail) in the preceding chapter. For
this reason, I don’t discuss how you enter, for example, item codes in the
Item column. If you have questions about how the Items tab works, refer
Figure 2-2:
The Create
Item
Receipts
window.

Book III
Chapter 2
Paying Vendors
Recording the Receipt of Items
175
to one of the other appropriate chapter sections in this book. For exam-
ple, you may want to refer to the discussion in Book III, Chapter 1.
9. Describe any related expenses.
The Expenses tab of the Create Item Receipts window works like the
Expenses tab of the Write Checks window. If you have questions about
how the Expenses tab works, refer to the discussion of writing checks in
Book III, Chapter 4.
10. Click either the Save & Close or Save & New button to save the
receipt item.
If you click the Save & Close button, QuickBooks saves your item receipt
information and closes the Create Item Receipts window. If you click the
Save & New button, QuickBooks saves the item receipt information and
redisplays a fresh, clean, cleared version of the Create Item Receipts
window. You can then use the window to describe the receipts of some
other set of items.
That’s about all you need to know to work with the Create Item Receipts
window. Nevertheless, let me just quickly describe the half-dozen command
buttons located at the bottom of the Create Item Receipts window that I
haven’t referenced in the earlier discussions:
✦Select PO: This command button displays the Open Purchase Orders
dialog box. The Open Purchase Orders dialog box lists the purchase
orders open for the selected vendor. By selecting a listed purchase
order, you tell QuickBooks to fill out the Item tab with the information
from that purchase order or orders.
✦Clear Qtys: This button clears the received quantities shown in the
Items tab if you’ve specified a purchase order. You can use this button
to, in effect, start over (when you click this button it changes into the
Receive All button, which accepts all items in the purchase order).
✦Show P.O.: This button shows the selected purchase order.
✦Clear Splits: This button erases any expense or item information that
you’ve entered in the Expenses tab or Items tab. In effect, the Clear Splits
button lets you start over in recording the receipt of some item or items.
✦Recalculate: This button recalculates the total amount by using the infor-
mation that you’ve entered onto the Expenses tab and the Items tab.
✦Clear: This button clears all the information that you’ve entered in the
Create Item Receipts window, including the Expenses tab information,
the Items tab information, and the vendor information shown at the top
of the window.
✦Time: This button opens the Select Time Period dialog box, shown in
Figure 2-3, which you use to specify the date range of the work for which
you’re paying.

Simultaneously Recording the Receipt and the Bill
176
Simultaneously Recording the Receipt and the Bill
You can record a bill for items that you receive at the same time that you
record the receipt of the items. You can do this simply by selecting the Bill
Received check box that appears near the top of the Create Item Receipts
window (as shown in Figure 2-2).
If you know that you’re going to record a bill at the same time as you record the
receipt of items, you can also choose the Vendors➪Receive Items and Enter Bill
command. In other words, rather than choosing the Receive Items command
from the Vendors menu, you choose the Receive Items and Enter Bill com-
mand. When you do this, QuickBooks displays the Enter Bills window, shown
in Figure 2-4. Essentially, the Enter Bills window is just another version of the
Create Item Receipts window except that the Bill Received check box is already
selected. To simultaneously record items that you’ve received and enter a
bill, you follow the same steps as you do to record the receipt of the items.

One item worth noting about simultaneously recording bills and the receipt
of items, however, is this: When you enter a bill, you need to be very precise
about the charges of the vendor. For example, in all probability, you won’t
pay just for the ordered items. You may also pay certain shipping and han-
dling fees. These amounts won’t necessarily get recorded on the Items tab.
They will probably be recorded on the Expenses tab.
Entering a Bill
If you told QuickBooks during the setup process that you want to track
unpaid bills, also known as accounts payable, you can enter bills as you
receive them. As you do this, QuickBooks keeps track of the unpaid bills.
Good, accurate recordkeeping of unpaid bills, or accounts payable, is essen-
tial if you want to do good accrual-basis accounting. As I discuss in Book I,
Chapter 1, accrual-basis accounting produces more accurate financial state-
ments than other methods.
If you haven’t previously recorded an item receipt
To enter a bill, you follow one of two sequences of steps. If you are entering
a bill for which you haven’t previously recorded an item receipt, you follow
these steps:
1. Choose the Vendors➪Enter Bills command.
QuickBooks displays the Enter Bills window, shown in Figure 2-5. You’ll
use this window to describe the bills that you later need to pay.
2. Use the Vendor drop-down list box to identify the vendor.
3. Use the Date, Bill Due, and Amount Due fields to describe the invoice
date, the invoice due date, and the invoice amount.
Optionally, use the Terms drop-down list box to identify the payment
terms and the Ref. No. box to identify the vendor’s reference number.
Next, if you want to, go ahead and provide a memo description for the
bill by using the Memo box.
4. Identify the expenses billed.
Use the Expenses tab of the Enter Bills window to identify the expenses
that the bill represents. To identify expenses, you supply the account
number that should be debited, the amount, and, optionally, the memo,
customer:job, and class information. If you have questions about how
the Expenses tab works, refer to the discussion in Book III, Chapter 4
about writing a check. The Expenses tab of the Write Checks window
works the same way as the Expenses tab of the Enter Bills window.

Entering a Bill
178
5. Identify the items billed in the Items tab.
Use the Items tab of the Enter Bills window to describe any items for
which the vendor bills you. For example, use the Item column to identify
the thing that you purchased. Then use the Qty, Cost, and Amount
columns to identify what the item cost. You can also use the Customer:
Job column if you are tracking bills by customers. If you have questions
about how to work with the Items tab, be aware that the Items tab of
the Enter Bills window works in the same way that Items tabs of other
QuickBooks windows work. You can, for example, refer to the discussion
of the Create Invoices window in Book III, Chapter 1.
The buttons at the bottom of the Enter Bills window — Select PO,
Receive All, Show PO, Clear Splits, Recalculate, and Clear — work the
same way as the similarly titled command buttons located at the bottom
of the Create Item Receipts window discussed earlier in the chapter in
the section “Recording the Receipt of Items.”
If you have previously recorded an item receipt
To enter a bill when you’ve already recorded the receipt of the item for
which the bill invoices you, follow these steps:
1. Choose the Vendors➪Enter Bill for Received Items command.
Figure 2-5:

dow. Again.

QuickBooks displays the Select Item Receipt window, shown in Figure 2-6.
2. To identify the item receipt for which you are now recording a bill,
select the vendor from the Vendor drop-down list box.
Then, when QuickBooks displays a list of item receipts for the vendor,
click the item receipt that corresponds to your bill. Next, click OK.
QuickBooks displays the Enter Bills window for the item. QuickBooks
fills out much of the Enter Bills window by using the information from
the item receipt, as shown in Figure 2-7.
You may be able to skip Steps 3, 4, and 5 if your item receipt information
correctly and completely fills the Enter Bills window.

3. Use the Date, Bill Due, and Amount Due fields to describe the invoice
date, the invoice due date, and the invoice amount.
Optionally, use the Terms drop-down list box to identify the payment
terms and the Ref. No. box to identify the vendor’s reference number.
Next, if you want to, go ahead and provide a memo description for the
bill by using the Memo box.
4. Use the Expenses tab of the Enter Bills window to identify the
expenses that the bill represents.
To identify expenses, you supply the account number that should be
debited, the amount, and, optionally, the memo, customer:job, and class
information. If you have questions about how the Expenses tab works,
refer to the discussion in Book III, Chapter 4 about writing a check. The
Expenses tab of the Write Checks window works the same way as the
Expenses tab of the Enter Bills window.
5. Use the Items tab of the Enter Bills window to describe any items for
which the vendor bills you.
For example, use the Item column to identify the thing that you pur-
chased. Then use the Qty, Cost, and Amount columns to identify what
the item cost. You can also use the Customer:Job columns if you are
tracking bills by customers. If you have questions about how to work
with the Items tab, be aware that the Items tab of the Enter Bills window
works in the same way that Items tabs of other QuickBooks windows work.
You can, for example, refer to the discussion of the Create Invoices
window in Book III, Chapter 1.
Recording a credit memo
You record credit memos from vendors by using the Enter Bills window, too.
The only difference in recording a credit memo is that you mark the Credit
button.
Paying Bills
If you use QuickBooks to keep track of the bills that you owe, you don’t use
the Write Checks window (described in Book III, Chapter 4) to record the
bills that you want to pay. Rather, you tell QuickBooks to display a list of
these unpaid bills that you’ve already recorded — and then you pick and
choose which bills QuickBooks should pay and the bank account from which
QuickBooks should write the check.
Follow these steps to pay bills in this manner:
1. Choose the Vendors➪Pay Bills command.

Book III
Chapter 2
Paying Vendors
Paying Bills
181
QuickBooks displays the Pay Bills window, shown in Figure 2-8. You use
the Pay Bills window to describe the payment that you want to make.
2. Describe which bills you want to pay.
Use the Show Bills radio buttons at the top of the Pay Bills window to
identify what you want to see. Select the Due On or Before radio button
to show only those bills that are due on or before the specified date.
To specify the date, enter the date into the Due On or Before date
box. To see a list of all the bills that you have to pay, select the 
Show All Bills radio button.
You can use the Sort Bills By drop-down list box to select the order that
QuickBooks uses for listing your bills. For example, you can sort bills by
due date, discount date, vendor, and amount due.
3. Select the bills that you want to pay.
To select bills that you want to pay, click the check column. The check
column is the leftmost column in the list of unpaid bills — it’s headed by
a check mark. When you click the check column, QuickBooks marks the
bill with a check mark. The check mark tells QuickBooks that you want
to pay that bill. To deselect a bill, click the check column again.
QuickBooks removes the check mark.
Figure 2-8:
The Pay Bills
window.

4. (Optional) Review a specific bill.
You can review detailed information about a specific bill by first clicking
the bill to highlight it in the list and then by clicking the Go To Bill button.
When you do this, QuickBooks displays the Enter Bills window with the
bill information. To close the Enter Bills window, click the Close button.
5. Set the discount and credit.
If you click the Set Discount button, QuickBooks displays the Discount
tab of the Discount and Credits window, as shown in Figure 2-9. You can
use the Discount tab to enter a discount amount for the bill. If you enter
a discount amount for the bill, you also enter the discount account.
This is the account that gets credited for the reduction — the discount —
in the correct amount.
If you click the Set Credits button, QuickBooks displays the Credits tab
of the Discount and Credits dialog box, shown in Figure 2-10. The Credit
tab lists any credit memos from this vendor. To apply a credit memo to
the amount due a vendor, click the Set Credits button. QuickBooks
marks applied credits by placing a check mark in the marked column.
When you complete your work with the Discounts and Credits dialog
box, click the Done button to close the dialog box and return to the Pay
Bills window.
Click the Clear button in the Discount and Credits dialog box to clear the
applied credits shown on the Credits tab.
6. Use the Payment Account drop-down list box to select the bank
account to be used for making payments.
The ending balance for the bank account shows the Payment Account
drop-down list box.

7. Use the Payment Method drop-down list box to select the payment
method.
If you want to pay your bills by check, for example, select Check.
Assuming that you will print the checks in QuickBooks, select the To Be
Printed radio button (otherwise, select the Assign Check No. radio
button to have QuickBooks assign the next consecutive check number).
You can also pay bills by other methods, such as by credit card and by
online payment (if you are set up for online payment or online banking).
8. Use the Payment Date drop-down list box to record the payment date
that you want.
The payment date entry interacts with the payment method entry. The
payment date that you set, for example, affects when an online payment
gets made. The payment date also corresponds to the check date that is
shown on printed checks.
9. After you select the bills that you want to pay and describe how you
want to pay them, click Pay Selected Bills to pay the selected bills.
QuickBooks records the payment transactions in the bank account to
pay the selected bills. QuickBooks also closes the Pay Bills window.
10. Complete your task.
You still need to print any unprinted checks necessary to pay bills if you
are using checks to pay the bills. You also need to transmit any online
payment instructions necessary to pay the bills if that’s how you’ve
chosen to pay the bills. If you are going to hand-write checks, you obvi-
ously need to hand-write the checks and then mail them out. In other
words, all QuickBooks does at this point is record in the QuickBooks
data file the payment transactions. It hasn’t yet affected the transactions.
You need to print the checks, send the online payment instructions, or
hand-write the checks!

Reviewing the Other Vendor Menu Commands
In the preceding paragraphs of this chapter, I talk about the most important
commands on the Vendor menu. Nevertheless, before I wrap up this little
dog and pony show, I will quickly review for you the other commands and
what they do.
Vendor Center
The Vendor Center window, shown in Figure 2-11, displays a list of vendors
and detailed vendor information for the selected vendor. To use it, select
from the Vendors drop-down list box the vendor for which you want to see
detailed information. The Vendor Center shows a bunch of information for a
vendor. This information all comes from the Vendor List, by the way.
If you keep records of your vendors, including information such as their tele-
phone numbers, about the best place to store that information, in my
humble opinion, is in the Vendor List. You have to maintain the Vendor List
in order for QuickBooks to work. So why not also go to a little bit extra effort
and keep all your vendor information there? If you adopt this approach, the
Vendor Detail Center window is the window that you can use to quickly look
up things such as the vendor’s phone or fax number.

Vendor Ratings Online
The Vendor Ratings Online command takes you to the Zipingo (www.
zipingo.com) Web site, which provides online ratings of vendors. I don’t
find that the Zipingo site helps me choose vendors — it’s better, I think, to
just google some vendor’s name to learn what his customers have said. But
you might want to try this site. Who knows? Maybe you’ll like it. (You can
turn off this Zipingo feature using the Edit➪Preferences command.)
Sales Tax menu commands
The Sales Tax command displays a submenu of commands that pay sales tax
amounts you’ve collected to the appropriate tax agency; adjust the sales tax
liability due; and produce reports on the sales tax liability you owe, the sales
tax revenue you’ve generated, and the sales tax codes you’ve set up.
To pay the sales taxes you owe, simply choose the Vendors➪Sales Tax➪Pay
Sales Tax command. When QuickBooks displays the Pay Sales Tax dialog box
(which lists the amounts you owe various sales tax collection agencies),
you select the agencies you want to pay or click the Pay All Tax button.
QuickBooks then records checks into the bank account register (see Book III,
Chapter 4 for details about how to work with the bank register), and you
print the checks in the usual way.
To adjust the amount that QuickBooks thinks you owe a sales tax collection
agency, you can choose the Vendors➪Sales Tax➪Adjust Sales Tax Due com-
mand. When QuickBooks displays the Sales Tax Adjustment dialog box,
select a sales tax agency from the Sales Tax Vendor box and an appropriate
expense or income account from the Adjustment Account box. Next, you
select the appropriate button (either Increase Sales Tax By or Decrease Sales
Tax By) and enter the adjustment amount into the Amount box.
To print one of the sales tax reports, simply select the command that corre-
sponds with the report. For example, to print the Sales Tax Liability report,
choose the Vendors➪Sales Tax➪Sales Tax Liability command.
The Manage Sales Tax command displays a window with buttons and click-
able hyperlinks that you can use to get sales tax information and perform
some of the tasks described in the preceding paragraphs.
Inventory Activities
The Inventory Activities menu displays a submenu of commands you use to
work with QuickBooks inventory features and with the related Item list. I am
not going to discuss this stuff here. Not because I’m lazy, but because I dis-
cuss inventory and the item list in Book III, Chapter 3.

Reviewing the Other Vendor Menu Commands
186
Print 1099s/1096
The Print 1099s command displays the Printing 1099-MISC and 1096 Forms
dialog box, which lets you print 1099-MISC forms for a selected calendar
year. You can select the year for which you need to print 1099 forms by
selecting a date range description from the drop-down list box. Initially, for
example, the drop-down list box shows Last Calendar Year. Alternatively, you
can use the From and To boxes to specify the starting and ending point for
the year. After you identify the year for which you want to print 1099 forms,
click OK. QuickBooks then creates 1099 forms for any vendors who need
them, provided that your 1099 preferences are set up correctly and the
vendor is marked as a 1099 recipient in the Vendor List.
You typically send 1099 forms to vendors to whom you pay more than $600
in a year. You can control the actual threshold amount — it varies from year
to year because of inflation and type of payment — by choosing the Edit➪
Preferences command, clicking the Tax: 1099 icon, and then clicking the
Company Preferences tab. For more information about how to set tax 1099
preferences, refer to Book II, Chapter 3.
Item List
The Vendors➪Item command displays the Item List window. You can read
more about the Item List window in Book III, Chapter 3.

I
f you’ve worked with QuickBooks, you won’t be surprised to hear that the
Item list is a key piece of your QuickBooks accounting system. The Item
list identifies each of the things that you sell. The Item list also identifies
other things that appear on your invoices and — if you use them — on your
purchase orders.
In this chapter, I talk about how you work with the QuickBooks Item list:
more specifically, how you look at and use the information on the Item list.
I explain how to add information to the list and how to edit information
already on the list. What’s more, I talk about three accounting tasks that are
related to your Item list: adjusting physical inventory accounts for inven-
tory shrinkage or spoilage; adjusting price levels of your inventory items;
and if you manufacture inventory, how the new version of QuickBooks han-
dles manufactured goods.
Looking at Your Item List
QuickBooks provides a bunch of different ways to see the information that
you’ve stored in your Item list. You may already know some of this stuff if
you’ve worked with QuickBooks a bit. Some of it may be new to you. In any
case, the next sections review the half-dozen ways that you can see the
items on your Item list.

Looking at Your Item List
188
Using the Item column
The Item column that appears in many of the windows in QuickBooks lets
you see a drop-down list of items. Figure 3-1, for example, shows the Item
drop-down list box in the Create Invoices window. You use the Item column
and the individual rows of the Item column to identify the items that appear
on an invoice.
One important point to consider as you look at the Item column and Item
drop-down list box in Figure 3-1 is space. Note that the Item drop-down list
box is pretty narrow. Note also that the Item drop-down list box in Figure 3-1
provides two pieces of information: the item code (the left column) and the
item description. The item description — if the description is lengthy — is
cut off. You’ll want to remember this seemingly trivial but important point as
you work with your Item file. You want descriptive item codes and if possi-
ble, brief descriptions.
I’m using pretty self-explanatory item codes in this reference, as you can see
from Figure 3-1. In real life, your codes may be far more cryptic.

Chapter 3

and Items
Looking at Your Item List
189
Using the Item List window
If you choose the Lists➪Item List command, QuickBooks displays the Item
List window, as shown in Figure 3-2. The Item List window identifies the item
code or name, the description, the type of item (I talk more about this in the
next section of the chapter), the account that gets credited when you sell
some of the items, and inventory stocking and pricing information (if you
supply that).
The Item list provides a good way to quickly see what items you can put on
invoices and purchase orders. The Item list also provides a quick and con-
venient way to see the stocking levels and prices.
If you want more information about an item shown in the Item List window,
you can double-click the item. When you double-click the item, QuickBooks
displays the Edit Item window, as shown in Figure 3-3. Essentially, the Edit
Item window displays all the information available about a particular item.
You can use the Edit Item window to change bits of item information. Later
in this chapter in the section, “Editing Items,” I describe how to do this.
Figure 3-2:
The Item
List window.

Adding Items to the Item List

Using the inventory reports
I mention one other thing because it’s so darn useful. As you would expect,
QuickBooks supplies several interesting, useful inventory reports. If you
choose the Reports➪Inventory command, for example, QuickBooks displays a
submenu of inventory reports. The submenu provides reports that give inven-
tory valuations, inventory stock levels, and a work sheet that you can use to go
out and physically count the inventory on store shelves or in the warehouse.
Book IV, Chapter 2 describes how you produce reports in QuickBooks and
how you customize those reports. If you want to find out more about reports
and report customization, refer there.
Adding Items to the Item List
You can add a bunch of different types of items to the Item list. Remember
that, as noted in the early paragraphs of this chapter, the Item list stores
descriptions of anything that you stick on an invoice or purchase order.
If you think about this for a minute, you realize that you have different types
of items. For example, if you are a retailer, the inventory that you sell may
appear on an invoice. If you provide discounts to different sorts of cus-
tomers, discounts may appear on an invoice as a line item. If you are in a
state that taxes sales, sales tax appears as a line item on an invoice.
Figure 3-3:
The Edit
Item
window.

Chapter 3

Adding Items to the Item List
191
You describe different items in different ways. You describe an inventory
item that may appear on an invoice differently from a sales tax that you are
required to charge.
Given this disparity, I first describe the general process for adding an item to
the Item list. After you know the big picture stuff, I talk about each of the
items that appear on the Item list individually. Sound okay? I’ll get started.
Basic steps for adding an item
To add an item to your Item list, follow these steps:
1. Choose the Lists➪Item List command.
QuickBooks displays the Item List window (an example of which
appears in Figure 3-2).
2. To display the Item menu, click the Item button, which appears in the
lower-left corner of the Item List window.
QuickBooks displays the Item menu.
3. Choose the New command.
This tells QuickBooks to display the New Item window, as shown in
Figure 3-4.
Figure 3-4:
The New
Item
window.

Adding Items to the Item List
192
4. Use the boxes of the New Item window to describe the item that you
want to add.
Your first step is to identify the type of item that you want to add. Based
on the type of item, QuickBooks supplies other boxes that you use to
describe the item. (I go into more detail about this in the following para-
graphs, so don’t get freaked out — yet.)
5. Save the item.
After you use the boxes in the New Item window to describe the item
that you want to add, click OK. QuickBooks adds the item that you just
described in the Item list.
The step-by-step approach described in the preceding paragraphs is the
conventional way to add an item, but you can also add items on the fly.
For example, if you are in the Create Invoices window or in the Create
Purchase Orders window, you can open the Item drop-down list box and
select Add New Entry from the list. When you do this, QuickBooks dis-
plays the New Item window, as shown in Figure 3-4. You then use the
New Item window to add the item in the same manner as discussed here.
Adding a service item
You use service items to purchase or bill for items that represent service.
For example, I am a CPA in Redmond, Washington. One of the things that I do
is prepare tax returns for individuals and businesses. When I bill a client for
preparing his or her tax return, the line item that appears on the invoice for
Tax Return Preparation is a service item.
In your business, you probably have service items, too. For example, a health
care provider, such as a dentist or doctor, provides treatment or performs
procedures. These activities represent services.
Even retailers and contractors — businesses that you typically think of as
selling tangible physical goods — often sell services. For example, a retailer
may gift-wrap a purchase, which is a service. A contractor may provide serv-
ices such as painting or cleanup.
To add a service item, display the New Item window (refer to Figure 3-4).
When QuickBooks displays the New Item window, select Service from the
Type drop-down list box. Then use the Item Name/Number box to give the
service a brief code or name. If the service is a subitem, select the Subitem
Of check box and identify the parent item.
Select the This Service Is Used in Assemblies or Is Performed by a
Subcontractor or Partner check box if the service is provided by, as the
window suggests, a subcontractor, owner, or partner. You indicate which
services are performed by subcontractors, owners, and partners because
these parties are subject to different tax accounting rules.

Book III
Chapter 3
Tracking Inventory
and Items
Adding Items to the Item List
193
Finally, use the Description box to describe the service. Your description
appears on invoices and purchase orders, so you want to be thoughtful here.
Use the Rate box to describe the price or rate per unit of service. Use the
Tax Code box to indicate whether the service is taxable. Finally, use the
Account box to identify which Income account should be credited when the
item is sold to some customer, client, or patient.
Adding an inventory item
Inventory items are those items that appear on invoices and purchase orders
and represent physical goods that you buy, hold, and sell. For example, if
you are a retailer, all that stuff that is sitting out on the shelves of your store
represents inventory. If you are a manufacturer, the raw materials that you
buy and then use to assemble your products represent inventory.
To set up an inventory part, display the New Item window. When QuickBooks
displays the window, select Inventory Part from the Type drop-down list
box. QuickBooks then displays the Inventory Part version of the New Item
window, as shown in Figure 3-5.
Use the Item Name/Number box to provide a descriptive but brief code or
name for the item. If the item is a subitem of some other parent item, select
the Subitem Of check box and then identify the parent item by using the
Subitem Of text box.
Figure 3-5:
The
Inventory
Part version
of the
New Item
window.

Adding Items to the Item List
194
The Purchase Information and Sales Information boxes let you determine the
information that appears on purchase orders and invoices. The Description
On Purchase Transactions box in the Purchase Information area, for exam-
ple, lets you provide the text that QuickBooks writes on purchase orders.
You can also guess at the purchase cost by using the Cost text box. Specify
the Cost of Goods Sold account that should be debited when this item is
sold by using the COGS Account drop-down list box and identify the pre-
ferred vendor for purchases of this item by using the Preferred Vendor box.
The Sales Information boxes provide the information that QuickBooks
needs to correctly include the item on an invoice. The Description On Sales
Transactions box provides a space that you can use to supply the descrip-
tion that QuickBooks should use for this item on your invoice. The Sales
Price box enables you to provide your price for the item. If you’re subject
to sales tax, you see (and should use!) the Tax Code drop-down list box to
specify whether the item is taxable or non-taxable for sales tax purposes.
Finally, the Income Account drop-down list box lets you specify which
income account should be credited when this item is sold.
If you’re confused about seeing two Account drop-down list boxes on the
Inventory Part version of the New Item window, keep in mind that when you
sell an item, you track the income by crediting an income account and the
cost of goods sold by debiting the Cost of Goods Sold account.
Use the Inventory Information boxes to describe how QuickBooks should
handle inventory tracking for the item. For example, use the Asset Account
drop-down list box to specify which account QuickBooks should use to track
the dollar investment in this item. Typically, you use the Inventory Asset
account. However, you can conceivably use some other asset account. Use
the Reorder Point box to identify the inventory stocking level at which you
want QuickBooks to alert you to reorder the item. If you have inventory on
hand for this item, enter the quantity that you have on hand and the value
that you have on hand by using the On Hand box and the Total Value boxes.
You also specify the date as of which your quantity and value information is
correct by using the As Of box.
You really shouldn’t be entering inventory balances for an inventory item
when you set it up on the Item list. You should be entering or changing
inventory quantities and values when you purchase the inventory (recorded
with the Create Purchase Orders window or the Write Checks window)
and when you sell the inventory (typically recorded with the Create
Invoices window or the Sales Receipts window). If you enter a quantity
other than zero or a total value other than zero when using the New Item
window, you also need to make a journal entry to record the other half of the
transaction. If this “other half” business sounds complicated, just trust me:
You should not be entering quantity or value information in this window.
If you do understand this “other half” business that I’m referring to, you

Book III

should know better than to enter quantity or value information in the New
Item window!
You can click the Spelling button to check the spelling of words and phrases
that you’ve entered in the New Item window. You can also click the Next
button to save the information that you’ve entered for an item and redisplay
the New Item window so you can add another item.
Adding a non-inventory part
To add a non-inventory part — which is a tangible good that you sell but
for which you don’t track inventory — display the New Item window and
select Non-Inventory Part in the Type drop-down list box. When
QuickBooks displays the Non-Inventory Part version of the New Item
window, as shown in Figure 3-6, give the non-inventory part a name or code
by using the Item Name/Number box. If the new item is a subitem, select
the Subitem Of check box. Then identify the parent item by using the
Subitem Of text box. Use the Description box to provide the description that
should go on invoices that bill for this non-inventory part. Obviously, you
enter the price into the Price box. Use the Tax Code box to identify whether
the item is subject to sales tax. Finally, use the Account drop-down list box
to identify the income account that should be credited for sales of this non-
inventory part.

Note the check box labeled This Item Is Purchased for and Sold to a Specific
Customer:Job. If you select that check box, QuickBooks displays a slightly
different version of the Non-Inventory Part window, as shown in Figure 3-7.
This version of the Non-Inventory Part New Item window includes Purchase
Information and Sales Information areas that work the same way as the
Purchase Information and Sales Information areas supplied by the regular
Inventory Part version of the New Item window. (Refer to Figure 3-5 and the
discussion of Figure 3-5 earlier in the chapter.)
Adding an other charge item
An other charge item is an item that you use to purchase or bill for things
such as miscellaneous labor or services, materials that you aren’t track-
ing as inventory, and special charges, such as for delivery or setup or
rush jobs.
To set up an other charge item, display the New Item window and select
Other Charge from the Type drop-down list box. When you do, QuickBooks
displays the Other Charge version of the New Item window, as shown in
Figure 3-8. To finish setting up your other charge item, give the charge
a name or code or abbreviation by using the Item Name/Number box. 
If the other charge item is a subitem, select the Subitem Of check box
and then identify the parent item by using the Subitem Of text box.
Obviously, you use the Description box to provide a description of the
charge (remember that this description appears on your invoices). Then use
the Amount or % box to identify how the charge gets calculated or billed.
Use the Tax Code drop-down list box to identify the charge as subject to
sales tax — or not subject to sales tax. Use the Account drop-down list box
to identify the income account that should be credited when you bill for this
other charge.
If you select the This Item Is Used in Assemblies or Is a Reimbursable Charge
check box, QuickBooks adds a second set of boxes to the New Item window.
One set of boxes is labeled Purchase Information and provides information
that goes on purchase orders or is used to record purchases and purchase
orders. The other set of boxes is labeled Sales Information and goes on
invoices and sales receipts to record the actual sale or billing for the other
charge.
If you want to enter an other charge that should be calculated as a percent-
age, you must enter the % symbol in the Amount or % box. For example,
if you want to include an other charge item on invoices that equals 
25 percent of the previous item on the invoice, enter 25% in the Amount
or % box.

Adding a subtotal item
If your purchase order, sales receipt, or invoice includes a subtotal line item,
you create a subtotal item in your Item list. To do this, display the New Item
window and select Subtotal from the drop-down list box. Next, give the subto-
tal item a name or abbreviation and use the Description box to describe the
subtotal. Figure 3-9 shows the Subtotal version of the New Item window.
If you’re using other charge items that are calculated as a percentage or dis-
count items that are calculated as a percentage, you almost certainly need a
subtotal item. An other charge that is calculated as a percentage would typi-
cally be calculated as a percentage of a subtotal item. Similarly, a discount
item that’s calculated as a percentage is calculated as a percentage of a
subtotal item.
Adding a group item
A group item lets you more easily invoice customers when, from the customer’s
perspective, he or she is buying a single item, but from your perspective,
you are actually selling several items. This definition sounds curious at first,
but let me give you a quick example. Suppose that you are a florist and do a
booming business on Valentine’s Day. Your best-selling items may be red
roses and pretty crystal vases. But you probably don’t sell individual roses
and individual vases. What you actually sell is a dozen roses and a single
vase. Although you want to individually track purchases of dozens of red
roses and individual crystal vases on your purchase orders, on your invoices
to customers, you want to bill for “a dozen red roses and a crystal vase.”
At the end of the chapter, I describe another item type, inventory assembly,
that works similarly to the group item type. The inventory assembly item
type is for manufacturers.
If that example doesn’t make sense, imagine a more complex floral arrange-
ment including the dozen red roses, a crystal vase, baby’s breath, flower pre-
servative, tissue paper wrapping, ribbon, a box, and so forth. In this case, do
you really want an invoice that shows perhaps twenty different items? Or do
you want an invoice that shows a single item: a dozen red roses and a crystal
vase? This is why you create group items. A group item lets you create a single
item that you use on invoices. However, this group item actually combines a
bunch of individual items that you are probably using on your purchase orders.
To create a group item, display the New Item window and select Group from
the Type drop-down list box. When QuickBooks displays the group version
of the New Item window, use the Group Name/Number box to give the group
item a name or code, as shown in Figure 3-10. Use the Description box to give
the group item an appropriate description. Use the Item, Description, and
Qty columns at the bottom of the Group version of the New Item window to
identify the individual items and item quantities that combine to make a group.

Adding a discount item
A discount item subtracts either a fixed amount or a percentage from a subto-
tal. To set up a discount item, display the New Item window. Next, select the
Discount entry from the Type drop-down list box. When you do, QuickBooks
displays the Discount version of the New Item window, as shown in Figure 3-11.
To set up your discount item, enter a name or abbreviation for the discount
into the Item Name/Number box. If the discount item is a subitem, select the
Subitem Of check box and then identify the parent item by using the Subitem
Of text box. Typically, you describe the discount by using the Description box.
Enter the amount of the discount into the Amount or % box as either a dollar
amount or as a percentage. If you do enter the discount as a percentage, be
sure to include the percentage symbol. Use the Account drop-down list box to
specify which account gets debited for the discount. Finally, use the Tax Code
drop-down list box to indicate whether the discount is applied before sales
tax. (In other words, indicate whether the discount is subject to sales tax.)
If you set up a discount item that calculates the discount as a percentage,
you probably also need a subtotal item. Then, on your invoices, follow the
subtotal item with the discount item. In this manner, you can easily calculate
the discount percentage by looking at the subtotal amount.

Adding a payment item
If you sometimes accept payments when you invoice a customer, you can
create a payment item and then add the payment item to the bottom of the
invoice. If you do this, the invoice, the payment amount, and the net amount
due all show on the same document. That’s pretty cool.
To set up a payment item, display the New Item window and select Payment
from the drop-down list box. Use the Item Name/Number box to give the 
payment item a code or name such as “payment.” Use the Description 
box to provide a nice description for the payment. (No kidding, you may
want to include the phrase “thank you” as part of the payment description.
For example, how about something such as “Payment . . . thank you!”)
Use the Payment Method drop-down list box to identify the method of 
payment: American Express, check, cash, Discover, Master Card, or Visa —
if that’s appropriate. Finally, use the radio buttons — Group with Other
Undeposited Funds and Deposit To — to identify what happens to the
money received as part of the payment. If you indicate that the money is
deposited, you also select the correct bank account from the Deposit To
drop-down list box. Figure 3-12 shows an example of a Payment version of
the New Item window.

Adding Items to the Item List
202
Adding a sales tax item
If you sell items that are subject to sales tax, you also include line items on your
invoices that charge for and track these sales taxes. To do this, you create sales
tax items. To create a sales tax item, display the New Item window and select
Sales Tax Item from the Type drop-down list box. When you do, QuickBooks
displays the Sales Tax version of the New Item window, shown in Figure 3-13.
Use the Tax Name box to identify or provide an abbreviation for the sales
tax. Use the Description box to give the sales tax a description. Finally, use
the Tax Rate (%) box to identify the sales tax rate and the Tax Agency box to
identify the tax agency that you will pay. For example, Figure 3-13 shows how
to set up the Washington state sales tax. This sales tax is 8.8 percent. The tax
agency to which sales tax receipts are remitted is the Department of Revenue.
Setting up a sales tax group
In many jurisdictions, although businesses may charge a single sales tax on
sales, the sales tax actually gets distributed to several different tax agencies.
For example, a firm may be required to charge a 9 percent sales tax. But per-
haps 1 percent goes to the local city government. Perhaps another 2 percent
goes to the county government. And maybe the remaining 6 percent goes to
the state government. In this case, you can set up a sales tax group, which
appears as a single line item invoice. However, the sales tax group is actually
made up of individual tax items.
Figure 3-13:

203
To add a sales tax group, display the New Item window and select Sales Tax
Group from the Type drop-down list box, as shown in Figure 3-14. Enter a
name or an abbreviation for the sales tax into the Group Name/Number box.
Provide an appropriate description by using the Description box. Then, use
the Tax Item column to identify the individual tax items that comprise the
sales tax group. Note that you should have already set up the tax items that
you want to add to the sales tax group.
Adding custom fields to items
If you’ve worked much with the New Item window or if you’ve paid par-
ticularly close attention to the figures shown in the last few pages of this
chapter, you may have noticed the Custom Fields command button
that appears on many (although not all) of the New Item windows. (See
Figure 3-12.)
The Custom Fields button enables you to add your own custom fields to the
Item list. To add a custom field, click the Custom Fields button. When you
do, QuickBooks displays a Message box and then a small dialog box labeled
Custom Fields for {Item}, where {item} actually names the item.
Figure 3-14:
The Sales
Tax Group
Item version
of the New

Editing Items
204
When QuickBooks displays the Custom Fields for {Item} dialog box, click the
Define Fields button. QuickBooks then displays the Define Custom Fields for
Items dialog box, as shown in Figure 3-15. To add a custom field for the item,
select the Use check box and then use the Label box to give a name to the
field. For example, if you want to add a custom field for Insured Value, you
can select the Use check box and then enter the label Insured Value.
When you click OK, QuickBooks redisplays the Custom Fields for {Item}
dialog box, as shown in Figure 3-16. The Custom Fields for {Item} dialog box
now shows the new custom field — in this example, Insured Value.
Note that custom fields are available for all items. Also note that you see
custom fields for items by displaying the item’s information in the New Item
window or the Edit Item window and then clicking the Custom Fields button.
Editing Items
You can change item information. To do so, display the Item List window
and then double-click the item. When you do this, QuickBooks displays the
Edit Item window. The Edit Item window resembles the New Item window.
The difference is that the Edit Item window is already filled in with the item
information. To change some bit of item information, edit the contents of the
field with the information to be updated. Click OK to save your changes.

Adjusting Physical Counts and Inventory Values
205
Adjusting Physical Counts and Inventory Values
Inventory shrinkage, spoilage, and, unfortunately, theft all combine to
reduce the inventory that you physically have. In order to record these
inventory reductions, you periodically physically count your inventory and
then update your QuickBooks records with the results of your physical
counts.
I don’t spend any time in this book talking about approaches to providing
physical counts; you probably have better ideas than I do about how to do
that. You presumably know what works best in your business. However, I can
tell you that in order to record your physical count information in QuickBooks,
you use a special tool. Specifically, you use the Adjust Quantity/Value on
Hand command. This command is available to you in two different places.
If you display the Item list, click the Activities button (which appears at the
bottom of the Item List window) and choose the Adjust Quantity/Value on
Hand command. You can also choose the Vendors➪Inventory Activities➪
Adjust Quantity/Value on Hand command. Choosing either command dis-
plays the Adjust Quantity/Value on Hand window, shown in Figure 3-17.
Figure 3-17:
The Adjust
Quantity/
Value on
Hand
window.

Adjusting Physical Counts and Inventory Values
206
To use the Adjust Quantity/Value on Hand window, follow these steps:
1. Use the Adjustment Date box to record the date of your physical
count.
In other words, you want to adjust your quantities as of the day you
took or completed the physical inventory count.
2. Use the Adjustment Account drop-down list box to identify the
expense account that you want to use to track your inventory shrink-
age expense.
3. (Optional) Identify the customer:job and class.
If it’s appropriate, and in many cases it won’t be, use the Customer:Job
box to identify the customer:job associated with this inventory shrink-
age. In a similar fashion, if appropriate, use the Class box to identify the
class that you want to use for tracking this inventory shrinkage.
4. Supply the correct inventory quantities.
The Item, Description, and Current Qty columns of the Adjust Quantities/
Value On Hand window identify the inventory items that you are holding
and the current quantity counts. Use the New Qty column to provide the
correct physical count quantity of the item. After you’ve entered the
new quantity, QuickBooks calculates the quantity difference and shows
this value in the Qty Difference column.
You can actually enter a value into either the New Qty column or the Qty
Difference column. QuickBooks calculates the other quantity by using
the current quantity information that you supply. For example, if you
enter the new quantity, QuickBooks calculates the quantity difference by
subtracting the new quantity from the current quantity. If you enter the
quantity difference, QuickBooks calculates the new quantity by adjust-
ing the current quantity for the quantity difference.
5. Adjust the value.
If you select the Value Adjustment check box, QuickBooks displays an
expanded version of the Adjust Quantity/Value on Hand window, as shown
in Figure 3-18. This window lets you enter both the correct physical
count quantity and the updated value for the inventory item. You enter
the physical count quantity, obviously, in the New Qty column. You enter
the new updated value in the New Value column. You probably use this
version of the Adjust Quantity/Value on Hand window only if you’re
using a lower-of-cost or market inventory valuation method. For exam-
ple, both financial accounting standards and tax accounting rules allow
you to mark down your inventory to the lower of its original cost or its
fair market value. If you are doing this — and how you do this is beyond
the scope of this book — you enter the new inventory value in the New
Value column.

Book III
Chapter 3
Tracking Inventory
and Items
Adjusting Physical Counts and Inventory Values
207
Essentially, using the lower-of-cost or market inventory evaluation
method just means you do what it says. You keep your inventory valued
at either its original cost or, if its value is less than its original cost, at its
new value. Obviously, assessing the value of your inventory is a little
tricky. But if you have questions, you can ask your CPA for help. One
thing to keep in mind, however, is that you can’t go changing your
accounting methods willy-nilly without permission from the Internal
Revenue Service. And changing your inventory valuation method from
cost, say, to lower-of-cost or market is a change in accounting method.
6. Provide a memo description.
If you want to further describe the quantity or value adjustment, use the
Memo box for this purpose. For example, you may want to reference the
physical count worksheets, the people performing the physical count, or
the documentation that explains the valuation adjustment.
7. Save the adjustment.
After you have used the Adjust Quantity/Value on Hand window to
describe the quantity changes or value changes in your inventory, click
either the Save & Close button or the Save & New button to save the
adjustment transaction. As you probably know at this point in your life,
Save & Close saves the transaction and closes the window. Save & New
saves the transaction but leaves the window open in case you want to
make additional changes.

Adjusting Prices and Price Levels
208
Adjusting Prices and Price Levels
QuickBooks provides a couple of handy commands and tools that you can
use to change the prices that you charge customers for your products and
services. In the following sections, I describe both of these handy aids.
Using the Change Item Prices command
The Change Item Prices command, which appears on the Customers menu,
displays the Change Item Prices window, as shown in Figure 3-19. This window
lets you change prices of a bunch of different items at one time by an amount
or percentage. To use the Change Item Prices command, first mark the items
whose prices you want to change. Do this by clicking the Check Mark column.
Next use the Adjust Price Of Marked Items By (Amount or %) box to specify
the dollar amount or the percentage amount by which you want to change
the price. For example, if you want to change the price of selected items by
$2.00, enter $2 into the box. If you want to change the price of selected items
by 5 percent, enter 5% into the box. Use the Based On drop-down list box to
indicate the base to which you want to add the amount of percentage. After
you identify the items that you want to reprice and the way that you want to
reprice them, click the Adjust button. QuickBooks recalculates the prices
and displays this information in the New Price column. If you want to change
the prices for the items selected, click OK.
Figure 3-19:
The Change
Item Prices
window.

Book III
Chapter 3
Tracking Inventory
and Items
Adjusting Prices and Price Levels
209
If you don’t like the prices listed in the New Price column, you can just keep
tinkering with the value in the By (Amount or %) box, clicking the Adjust
button to refresh the numbers in the New Price column and clicking OK only
when you’re satisfied.
Using price levels
Price levels are kind of weird; they let you individually adjust the price of an
item up or down. For example, if you have agreed to discount items by 10 per-
cent for a certain customer, you can easily do this by using a price level to
knock the price down by 10 percent whenever you’re invoicing that customer.
To use price levels, you first have to set up the price levels by using the
Price Level list command on the Lists menu. After you set up your price
levels, you adjust prices by using price levels when you create an invoice.
I describe how both tasks work.
Creating a price level
To create a price level, choose the Lists➪Price Level List command. When
you do, QuickBooks displays the Price Level List window. To create a price
level, click the Price Level button and then choose the New command on the
Price Level menu. QuickBooks displays the New Price Level window, shown
in Figure 3-20. Name the price level change by using the Price Level box.
Select the items to which you want to apply the price level by clicking them.
(QuickBooks marks selected items with a check.) Then use the Adjust Price
Of Marked Items To Be boxes to indicate that this price level increases or
decreases the sales price some percentage higher or lower than the stan-
dard price. Finally, use the Round Up To Nearest drop-down list box to spec-
ify if and how QuickBooks should round off its calculations. Figure 3-20, for
example, shows a price level change that decreases the sales price by 10 per-
cent. If you click the Adjust command button, QuickBooks shows the adjusted
price in the Custom Price column.
Using a price level
To use a price level, you create an invoice in the usual way. However, click
the Price Each column for the item that you want to reprice by using the
price level. When you do, QuickBooks turns the Price Each column into a
drop-down list box. If you click the arrow button that opens the drop-down
list box, QuickBooks displays both the base rate price and any price levels.
If you choose a price level, QuickBooks adjusts the price for the price level
change. For example, in Figure 3-21, selecting the 10 percent price level
change bumps the price from $3.00 to $2.70. In other words, the “ten %
down” price level change decreases the default price by 10 percent, from
$3.00 to $2.70.

Tracking Inventory
and Items
Inventory in a Manufacturing Firm
211
Inventory in a Manufacturing Firm
Tracking inventory in a manufacturing firm is more difficult than in other
types of businesses. When you boil everything down to its essence, the
problem stems from a couple tricky accounting requirements:
✦In a manufacturing environment, the manufacturer combines raw
materials items into finished goods items. This means — and this is the
challenging part — that the manufacturing process reduces the inventory
count and value for some items (the raw materials or the components)
while at the same time it increases the count and value of the other, fin-
ished goods items.
✦In a manufacturing environment, the rules say that you don’t just
count the value of items in the finished goods item inventory values.
You also count the cost of labor and factory overhead used in manufac-
turing the items.
QuickBooks solves the first problem related to manufacturing inventory;
however, QuickBooks doesn’t solve or address the second problem.
Fortunately, as long as you’re a small manufacturer, you probably don’t need
to worry too much about the second problem. You should ask your CPA
about this. But don’t worry — Congress and the Internal Revenue Service
have provided a bunch of loopholes for making the accounting easier for the
small guys.
Manufactured inventory the simple way
If you’re using QuickBooks Pro or some earlier versions of QuickBooks
Premier, you don’t have the capability to account for the manufacture of
inventory in QuickBooks. The best that you can do is to use group items
to combine into individual items on a customer’s invoice. This approach
sounds sloppy, but it isn’t quite as bad as you may think at first blush. You can
choose to show only the group item on a customer invoice. This means —
getting back to the example of the florist selling red roses and vases — that
the florist can “manufacture” a crystal vase of a dozen red roses and then
show the manufactured item as a group item on the customer’s invoice.
The one thing that is problematic about the “just use a group item” approach
is that it doesn’t give you a way to track the finished goods’ inventory
values.
Inventory accounting in QuickBooks Premier
To account for the manufacture of inventory in QuickBooks Premier, you add
inventory assembly items to the Item list for those items that you manufacture.
You also record the manufacture of items as you, well, manufacture them.

Inventory in a Manufacturing Firm
212
For example, suppose that Pine Lake Porcelain mostly just buys and resells
coffee mugs and other porcelain doodads. But also suppose that once a year,
Pine Lake Porcelain assembles a collection of red coffee mugs into a boxed
St. Valentine’s Day gift set. In this case, QuickBooks can record the assembly
of a boxed gift set that combines, for example, four red coffee mugs, a card-
board box, and some tissue wrapping paper.
Adding inventory assembly items
To describe manufactured items, follow these steps:
1. Choose Lists➪Item List.
QuickBooks displays the Item List window.
2. Click the Item button in the Item List window and select New from the
drop-down list.
QuickBooks displays the New Item window.
3. Select the Inventory Assembly item from the Type drop-down list box.
QuickBooks displays the Inventory Assembly version of the New Item
window, as shown in Figure 3-22.
4. Specify the account to use for tracking this item’s cost when you sell it.

and Items
Inventory in a Manufacturing Firm
213
QuickBooks suggests the Cost of Goods Sold account. If you’ve created
other accounts for your COGS, however, select the other appropriate
account.
5. Describe the manufactured item.
Type in a description of the item that you want to appear on documents,
such as invoices and so on, that your customers see. (QuickBooks sug-
gests the same description that you used in the Description on Purchase
Transactions text box as a default.)
6. Enter the amount that you charge for the item into the Sales Price box.
7. Indicate whether the manufactured item is subject to sales tax using
the Tax Code box.
8. Use the Income Account box to specify the account that you want
QuickBooks to use for tracking the income from the sale of the item.
9. Identify the components that go into the finished item.
Use the Components Needed list box to identify the individual compo-
nent items and the quantities needed to make the inventory assembly.
Each component item goes on a separate line in the list box. Not to be
too redundant, but do note that you both identify the component item
and the number of component items needed.
10. Identify the Asset Account.
Specify the other current asset account that you want QuickBooks to
use for tracking this inventory item’s value.
11. Select a Build Point.
Use the Build Point box to specify the lowest inventory quantity of this
item that can remain before you manufacture more. When the inventory
level drops to this quantity, QuickBooks adds a Reminder to the
Reminders list, notifying you that you need to make more of the item.
12. Ignore the On Hand and the Total Value boxes.
See that On Hand box? Leave it set to zero. To enter a number now is to
record an uncategorized transaction, and you don’t want to do that. Go
ahead and leave the Total Value field set to zero, too. You can also leave the
As Of box empty, or you can enter the current date here. It doesn’t matter.
Recording manufacture or assembly of items
To build some assembly, choose the Vendors➪Inventory Activities➪Build
Assemblies command. QuickBooks displays the Build Assemblies window, as
shown in Figure 3-23. All you do is select the thing that you want to build
from the Assembly Item drop-down list box and then the quantity that you
(or some hapless co-worker) have built in the Quantity to Build box. Then you
click either the Build & Close or Build & New button. (Click the Build & New
button if you want to record the assembly of some other items.)

Inventory in a Manufacturing Firm
214
While I’m on the subject, let me make a handful of observations about the
Build Assemblies window and the Build Assemblies command:
✦In the top-right corner of the window, QuickBooks shows the quantities
of the assembly that you have on hand and for which customers have
placed orders. That’s pretty useful information to have, so, hey, remem-
ber that it’s there.
✦The main part of the Build Assemblies window shows you what goes
into your product. Not that you care, but this is called a bill of materials.
✦At the bottom of the bill of materials list, QuickBooks shows you the
maximum number of assemblies that you can make, given your current
inventory holdings.
✦When you build an item, QuickBooks adjusts the inventory item counts.
For example, in the case where you make boxed gift sets, each with four
red coffee mugs and two wrapping tissues, QuickBooks reduces the item
counts of red coffee mugs and wrapping tissues and increases the item
counts of the boxed gift sets when you record building the assembly.
Some of the components used in an assembly may not be inventory items.
You can use non-inventory parts in an assembly.

Chapter 4: Managing Cash 
and Bank Accounts
In This Chapter
 Writing checks
 Making deposits
 Transferring money
 Working with the register
 Reconciling accounts
 Reviewing the other banking tools
QuickBooks provides several tools that make working with your bank
accounts easier. For example, QuickBooks gives you a special window
for recording the checks you’ve written. QuickBooks also lets you easily
record deposits into accounts. Additionally, QuickBooks includes tools for
easily recording transfers between accounts, for reconciling bank accounts,
and for performing online banking transactions.
This chapter talks about all these features. Note that if you’ve used
QuickBooks’ little brother product, Quicken, much of the information that
you see here will be familiar. The QuickBooks banking tools look like the
popular Quicken checkbook program. (This is good news for the ten million
or so Quicken users.)
Writing Checks
Obviously, any business writes checks — to pay bills and to pay employees.
QuickBooks includes a command and a window specifically for the purpose
of recording and possibly printing checks.
Recording and printing a check
To record or print checks, choose the Banking➪Write Checks command.
When QuickBooks displays the Write Checks window, as shown in Figure 4-1,
take the following steps to write a check:

Writing Checks
216
1. Use the Bank Account drop-down list box to select the correct account
on which to write a check.
2. Use the No. (check number), field to identify the check number.
If you don’t know the check number yet because you haven’t printed the
check, leave the No. field blank. Then select the To Be Printed check
box, which appears in roughly the middle of the Write Checks window.
When you select the To Be Printed check box, QuickBooks displays the
phrase To Print in the No. field.
3. Use the Date field to record the date that the check is written or will
be written.
You can enter the check date in mm/dd/yyyy format. You can also enter
dates as simply mmdd or m/dd, and QuickBooks transforms them to
mm/dd/yyyy. Thus 3/17, 0317, and 03/17/2007 are all valid ways to enter
the same date, if the current year is 2007.
Alternatively, you can click the small calendar button that appears
to the right of the Date field. When you click the calendar button,
QuickBooks displays a pop-up calendar. To select a day shown on the
calendar, click the day. The pop-up calendar also includes a pair of but-
tons that you can click to scroll back and forth through the months.

4. Use the Pay to the Order Of field to identify the individual or business
that you are paying with the check.
If the check that you are recording is the first check that you’ve ever
made out to the payee, you must type the payee’s name in the Pay to the
Order Of field. If you have previously paid the payee, you can click the
arrow button at the right end of the Pay to the Order of field. When you
do, QuickBooks displays a list of previous payees. You can select a
payee from this list by clicking the name.
5. Move the selection cursor to the $ (or amount) field and type the
check amount.
QuickBooks writes out the check amount on the line beneath the Pay to
the Order Of field.
6. (Optional) Provide an address.
If you want, you can use the address block to provide the payee’s
address. Note that QuickBooks writes the payee name on the first line of
the address block when you fill in the Pay to the Order Of field. You can
add the other lines to the address block manually. Note, though, that if
you’ve previously entered an address for a payee (such as when you last
recorded a check to the payee), QuickBooks reuses this address infor-
mation for subsequent checks.
You can edit the address information shown in the Write Checks window.
You need to record the address only if you are going to print the check
and the address will show through the address window, or when you
are creating an online payment — something I talk about later in this
chapter.
7. (Optional) Provide a memo description.
You can use the Memo field to provide or record additional information.
If you’re going to print the check, for example, you can use the Memo
field to identify your account number or the invoice number that the
check pays. If you’re simply recording checks and won’t be printing
checks, you can use the Memo field to record more proprietary or confi-
dential information.
8. (Optional) Select the Online Payment check box.
So here’s the deal. If you’ve told your bank that you want to do the
online banking thing and have followed its instructions for setup, you
can select the Online Payment check box. This tells QuickBooks to later
transmit this check information to your bank along with instructions
that the bank make the payment.
More information on setting up online banking is available later in this
chapter.

Writing Checks
218
To later transmit the payment instructions to the bank, choose Banking➪
Online Banking, click Send, and then enter your PIN (personal identifica-
tion number) when QuickBooks asks for it.
9. Distribute the check amount to the appropriate expense or asset
accounts.
If the check pays for a particular expense or purchases a particular
asset, click the Expenses tab. Then use the lines or rows of the Expenses
tab to identify the account and the amount that the check pays. For exam-
ple, to record a $50 check that pays supplies expense, use the Account
column of the Expenses tab to select the office supplies expense
account. Then use the Amount column to identify the amount of the
office supplies. Optionally, use the Memo column to provide a memo
description of that line of expense detail. And, equally optional, use the
Customer:Job column and the Class column to further describe and cat-
egorize the line of account detail information. If you do categorize the
expense as one incurred for a particular customer or job, you can use
the Billable column (marked by an icon) to indicate whether this item
should be later billed to the customer (see Figure 4-2).
Figure 4-2:

Checks

Book III
Chapter 4
Managing Cash and
Bank Accounts
Writing Checks
219
If a check pays for several different types of expenses, the Expenses tab
should show several different lines.
If you write a check to purchase an asset, the Expenses tab doesn’t show
an expense account; instead, the Expenses tab shows an asset account.
For example, if you buy a $5,000 piece of machinery, you may distribute, or
categorize, that $5,000 check to an asset account. In this case, the Account
column of the Expenses tab shows the asset account name. The Amount
column of the Expenses tab shows the amount of the asset purchased.
10. Describe the items that the check purchases.
Figure 4-3 shows the Items tab of the Write Checks window. You use the
Items tab when you write a check to purchase items shown and described
on your Item list. For example, if you write a $1,000 check to buy 1,000
$1 items for inventory, you use the Items tab. To use the Items tab, iden-
tify the item being purchased by entering the item code or name into
the Item column. Optionally, edit the item description shown in the
Description column. Then use the Qty, Cost, and Amount columns to
describe the number of items and the total cost of the items purchased.
As with the Expenses tab, QuickBooks gives you the option of further
classifying an item by using the Customer:Job, Billing, and Class columns.
Figure 4-3:
The Write
Checks
window
displaying
the Items
tab.

Writing Checks
220
Book III, Chapter 3 describes how items and the Item list work in
QuickBooks. If you are unsure how to work with items, refer to that
chapter.
11. After you describe the check and the reasons for writing the check,
click either the Save & Close or the Save & New button.
The Save & Close button saves the check and also closes the Write
Checks window. Click the Save & New button to save the check and then
redisplay the Write Checks window so that you can record another
check. If you don’t want to save the check, click the Clear button.
The Write Checks window provides several buttons along its top edge:
Previous, Next, Print, and Find. I describe the Print button in the next
step, but let me note here that the Previous and Next buttons page back
and forth to the checks that you’ve already written. The Find button dis-
plays the Find Checks dialog box, which you can use to describe a check
similar to the one you’re looking for. After you describe the check you’re
looking for, click the Find button in the Find Checks dialog box.
12. To print a check, click the Print button.
Alternatively, if you want to print checks in a batch, after you’ve
recorded the very last check that you want to print, click the down
arrow to the right of the Print button. When QuickBooks displays the
Print menu, choose its Print Batch command. QuickBooks displays the
Select Checks to Print dialog box, as shown in Figure 4-4. Select the
checks that you want to print by clicking them. Use the First Check
Number box to identify the number of the first check form to use for
printing. Then click OK. When QuickBooks displays the Print Checks
dialog box, as shown in Figure 4-5, use the Check Style area to identify
the type of check forms on which you are printing. If you’re using stan-
dard or wallet-style checks, you also need to indicate the number of
checks. Then click the Print button.
Figure 4-4:
The Select
Checks
to Print
dialog box.

Book III
Chapter 4
Managing Cash and
Bank Accounts

221
You can also print check forms in a batch by choosing the File➪Print
Forms➪Checks command. When you choose this command, QuickBooks
displays the Select Checks to Print dialog box. You then identify which
checks that you want to print, click OK, and use the Print Checks dialog
box to finish printing your checks.
Customizing the check form
While I’m on the subject of printing check forms, let me make a couple of
quick observations. If you click the Fonts tab in the Print Checks dialog box,
QuickBooks displays a couple of buttons you can click to specify what fonts
QuickBooks should use for printing check forms (see Figure 4-6).
Figure 4-6:
The Fonts
tab of the
Print Checks
dialog box.
Figure 4-5:
The Print
Checks
dialog box.

Writing Checks
222
If you click the Font button, for example, QuickBooks displays the Select
Font dialog box, shown in Figure 4-7. You select the font you want from the
Font list box, any special type style such as bold or italic from the Font Style
list box, and the point size from the Size list box. You can experiment with
different font settings and see the combined effect in the Sample box.
If you click the Partial Page tab, QuickBooks displays the dialog box tab
shown in Figure 4-8. Use this tab’s buttons to tell QuickBooks how you feed
a partial page of check forms through your printer.
One final tidbit about customizing check forms. If you click the Logo button
(available in the Print Checks dialog box as shown in Figure 4-8), QuickBooks
displays a little dialog box that lets you tell QuickBooks it should print a
logo on your checks. To print a logo, you need an image file for the logo (per-
haps something you’ve created in Paint or another image editing program).
This little dialog box just lets you tell QuickBooks where this logo image file
is located.

Making Bank Deposits
223
Making Bank Deposits
QuickBooks also supplies a command and window for recording bank
deposits. To record bank deposits, follow these steps:
1. Choose the Banking➪Make Deposits command.
QuickBooks displays the Payments to Deposit window, shown in
Figure 4-9. (Note that QuickBooks goes right to the Make Deposits
window, shown in Figure 4-10, and skips the Payments to Deposit
window if there are no pending deposits to make.)
2. Use the Payments to Deposit window to select the payments you want
to deposit.
You can select all the payments listed by clicking the Select All button.
You can select individual payments by clicking them. QuickBooks marks
selected payments with a check mark.
3. Click OK.
QuickBooks displays the Make Deposits window, shown in Figure 4-10.
4. In the Make Deposits window, use the Deposit To box to identify the
bank account into which you are depositing the funds.
Figure 4-9:
The
Payments to
Deposit
window.

Making Bank Deposits
224
5. Use the Date box to identify the deposit date.
You can enter the date in mm/dd/yyyy fashion or you can click the small
calendar button to the right of the Date field. On the calendar that
appears, click the day that you want the Date field to show.
6. (Optional) Provide a memo description.
Initially, QuickBooks uses the Memo field to describe the transaction as
a deposit. This is obviously a pretty good description of a deposit trans-
action. If you want to change the memo description to something else
even more useful — such as daily cash sales or something like that —
replace the contents of the Memo box.
Perhaps the best use for the box was suggested by the accountant who
reviewed this manuscript: You can use this field to further describe any
unusual transactions, such as refunds of expenses, rebates, asset sale
proceeds, and so forth.
As you may remember from either working with QuickBooks or from the
discussion of making sales in Book III, Chapter 1, you have the option of
telling QuickBooks (whenever you receive a payment) that the payment
be directly deposited to the bank account or lumped with other pay-
ments into an undeposited funds bucket.
Not all customer payments appear in the Make Deposits window. As dis-
cussed in Book III, Chapter 1, you can also indicate that a customer pay-
ment should be deposited into a bank account directly from the Receive
Payments window and directly from the Enter Sales Receipts window.
Figure 4-10:
The Make
Deposits
window.

Book III
Chapter 4
Managing Cash and
Bank Accounts
Making Bank Deposits
225
These direct-into-the-account payments don’t appear in the Make
Payments window. You actually record these bank account deposits at the
same time that you record the customer payment or the sales receipt.
7. Record any additional deposit amounts.
If you also want to include as part of the deposit some other payment
that’s not listed initially in the Make Deposits window, you can use the
next empty row of the list to describe this payment. To describe the pay-
ment, use the Received From column to identify the customer, vendor, or
other individual or business making the payment. Use the From Account
column to identify the account that should be credited for this payment.
In the case of a customer payment that’s a sale, for example, your sales
revenue account should be the one recorded in the From Account
column. Use the other columns of the Make Deposits window — Memo,
Chk No., Pmt Meth., Class, and Amount — to provide the other details of
the payment.
8. Identify any cash back amount.
If you’re making a $1,000 deposit but want to hold $100 of the deposit
back as cash, you record a cash back amount. To record a cash back
amount, use the Cash Back Goes To box to identify the account that
should be adjusted for the cash back. Use the Cash Back Memo field to
describe the reason for the cash back transaction. Finally, enter the cash
back amount into the cleverly titled Cash Back Amount box. For exam-
ple, if you wanted to hold $100 of cash back for employee bonuses, you
may enter employee bonuses (pretend this is an expense account) into
the Cash Back Goes To box. Then you may use the Cash Back Memo field
to describe the occasion for these employee bonuses. Finally, you would
enter the cash back amount, $100, into the Cash Back Amount box.
9. Save the deposit transaction.
As is the case with other QuickBooks transaction-entry windows, click
either the Save & Close or the Save & New button to save your deposit
transaction. Note that after you’ve saved the deposit transaction,
QuickBooks records the deposit into the appropriate bank account.
This deposit transaction total — which shows at the bottom of the
window in the Deposit Total field — is the amount that appears on your
bank statement. It is also the amount that appears on the bank account
register. (I talk about bank account registers a little later in the chapter.)
The Make Deposits window also provides Previous and Next buttons that
enable you to page back and forth through your deposit transactions.
The Print button in the Make Deposits window lets you print a deposit
list. The Payments button lets you redisplay the Payments to Deposit
dialog box.

Transferring Money between Bank Accounts
226
Transferring Money between Bank Accounts
The Banking menu supplies a useful command for transferring money
between funds. To transfer money between funds, you can choose the
Banking➪Transfer Funds command. When you do so, QuickBooks displays
the Transfer Funds Between Accounts window, as shown in Figure 4-11.
To use the Transfer Funds Between Accounts window, follow these steps:
1. Use the Date field to identify the transfer date.
You can enter the date in mm/dd/yyyy format, or you can click the
small calendar button that appears to the right of the Date field. When
QuickBooks displays the calendar, click the day that corresponds to the
date you want to enter into the Date field.
2. Use the Transfer Funds From drop-down list box to select the bank
account from which you are moving funds.
You can enter the bank account name into the box or you can click the
drop-down arrow at the right end of the box and select a bank account
from the list that QuickBooks supplies.
3. Use the Transfer Funds To drop-down list box to identify the bank
account that receives the transferred funds.
The Transfer Funds To box works like the Transfer Funds From box.
4. Use the Transfer Amount box to identify the amount of the transfer.
For example, if you transfer $100 from your checking to your savings
account, the transfer amount is $100.
Figure 4-11:
The Transfer
Funds
Between
Accounts
window.

Book III
Chapter 4
Managing Cash and
Bank Accounts
Working with the Register
227
5. (Optional) Provide a memo description for the transfer transaction.
If you want (and this is no big deal), you can use the Memo box to pro-
vide some brief memo description of the funds transfer.
6. Save the transfer transaction.
To save your transfer transaction, click either the Save & Close or the
Save & New button. Alternatively, if you don’t want to save the transfer
transaction, click the Clear button.
Working with the Register
You can record checks, deposits, and account transfers by using the com-
mands described in the preceding paragraphs of this chapter, but you have
another method available, too. You can also use the Register window. The
Register window looks like the regular paper register that you use to keep
track of transactions or a bank account. QuickBooks allows you to enter
transactions directly into an account register.
Recording register transactions
To enter a bank account transaction directly into an account register, follow
these steps:
1. To display an account register, choose the Banking➪Use Register 
command.
Sometimes, when you choose the Banking➪Use Register command,
QuickBooks displays the Use Register dialog box (see Figure 4-12).
Sometimes it displays the actual register (see Figure 4-13). The Use
Register dialog box asks you to select the bank account that you want to
display in a register. To select the account that you want to use, open
the Select Account drop-down list box and select the bank account.
QuickBooks then displays the Register window, shown in Figure 4-13.
If QuickBooks shows the register of an account other than what you
want to see, choose Banking➪Use Register again. The Use Register
dialog box in Figure 4-12 should appear.
Figure 4-12:
The Use
Register
window.

Working with the Register
228
The Use Register dialog box actually lets you select any account. You
can select a non-bank account, too.
2. Use the Date column of the register to record the date of the deposit,
payment, or transfer.
You can enter a date by using the mm/dd/yyyy date format. Or you can
click the small calendar button at the right end of the Date field to dis-
play the month that shows the date and then click the day button that
corresponds to the date you want to enter.
3. (Optional) Assign a transaction number.
Use the Number column to uniquely identify the transaction. In the case
of check transactions, for example, use the Number field to record the
check number. For transfers and deposits, you may not need to record a
number.
4. Use the Payee field to record the payee for a check, the customer
paying a deposit, or some other bit of information in the case of a
transfer transaction.
Note that you can select an existing customer, vendor, or a name from
one of the QuickBooks lists by clicking the down-arrow button at the
Figure 4-13:
The Register
window
showing
transactions
that affect
the bank
account.

Book III
Chapter 4
Managing Cash and
Bank Accounts
Working with the Register
229
right end of the Payee field. When you do this, QuickBooks displays a
list of names. Click the one that you want to select.
5. Provide the transaction amount.
Use the Payment column if you are describing a check transaction or a
transfer that moves money from the account. Use the Deposit column
if you are describing a deposit into the account or transfer into the
account. Enter the amount of the transaction into the appropriate
column — Payment or Deposit — by using dollars and cents.
6. Identify the account.
For check transactions, you use the Account field to identify the expense
that a check pays or the asset that a check purchases. For deposit trans-
actions, you use the Account field to identify the sales revenue account
that the deposit represents. For Transfer transactions, use the Account
field to identify the other bank account involved in the transaction. You
can enter the Account name into the Account box or you can open the
Account drop-down list box and choose the account that you want by
clicking it.
7. (Optional) Provide a memo description.
If you want, use the Memo field to provide a brief description of the pay-
ment, deposit, or transfer transaction.
8. (Optional) Split the transaction.
If a transaction needs to be assigned to more than one account, click the
Splits button. QuickBooks then displays the Splits area in the register
window, shown in Figure 4-14. The Splits area lets you split a transaction
among several accounts. For example, a check that pays both office sup-
plies and entertainment expenses can be split between these two
expense accounts. Similarly, a deposit transaction that represents both
product revenue and service revenue can be split between these two
accounts. After you finish with the Splits area, click its Close button.
You can erase the Splits detail by clicking the Clear button. You can also
tell QuickBooks to recalculate the payment or deposit amount by using
the split transaction data simply by clicking the Recalc button.
The Splits area also lets you do something that isn’t possible inside the
regular register: You can use the Splits area to record customer:job infor-
mation, class information, and billing information. To do this, use the
Customer:Job column, the Billing column, and the Class column.
9. To record a transaction into the register, click the Record button.
QuickBooks recalculates the account balance and adjusts the ending
balance for the new transaction.

Working with the Register
230
Using Register window commands and buttons
The Register window provides several buttons and boxes to enable you to
more easily work with the Register window and control the way it looks.
The Go To button
Clicking the Go To button displays the Go To dialog box, as shown in Figure
4-15. The Go To dialog box lets you search for a transaction in the Register
window. For example, you can look for a transaction where the Payee/Name
uses some name. You can click the Back and Next buttons to move to the
previous or next transactions that also match the search criteria. To remove
the Go To dialog box from the QuickBooks program window, of course, click
Cancel.

The Print button
The Print button, when clicked, displays the Print Register dialog box (see
Figure 4-16). The Print Register dialog box lets you print a copy of the regis-
ter for the account. The Print Register dialog box provides Date Range From
and Date Range Through boxes, where you specify the range of dates you
want on the printed register. The Print Register dialog box also provides a
Print Splits Detail check box, which you can select to tell QuickBooks that
you want to see the split transaction detail.
The Edit Transaction button
The Edit Transaction button, when clicked, tells QuickBooks to display 
whatever window you used to originally record the selected transaction.
Remember that the Register window shows all the transactions for the bank
account. These transactions include, for example, checking account transac-
tions that you recorded when using the Write Checks window. If you click
the Edit Transaction button when the selected transaction is one that you
originally recorded in the Write Checks window, QuickBooks displays that
transaction again in the Write Checks window. You then edit the transaction
by using the Write Checks window and click either Save & Close or Save &
New to save your changes.
The QuickReport button
Click the QuickReport button to display a report that summarizes register
information for the payee or name in the selected transaction. For example,
if the selected transaction is a check written to Little Bertha’s Workshop,
clicking QuickReport builds a quick-and-dirty report that summarizes all the
transactions for Little Bertha’s Workshop (see Figure 4-17).
The 1-Line check box
QuickBooks lets you display either a one-line version of the register or a 
two-line version of the register (see Figure 4-18). By default, QuickBooks
assumes that you want the two-line version of the register. However, you
can display a more compact, one-line version of the register by selecting the
1-Line check box.

The Sort By box
The Sort By drop-down list box lets you choose how QuickBooks arranges
register information. QuickBooks lets you arrange register information by
date, by amount, by order entry date, and several other sorting methods as
well. To change the way that QuickBooks orders or organizes the informa-
tion in the register, open the Sort By drop-down list box and choose the
ordering sequence that you want.
Using Edit Menu Commands
In the preceding paragraphs of this chapter, I describe how to record check
transactions, deposit transactions, transfers between accounts, and how to
use the register. You often don’t need to know any more than I’ve already
described in order to use the windows discussed and in order to record the
transactions described. However, know that the Edit menu (which appears
when the Register window is open and active, as shown in Figure 4-19) pro-
vides several other useful commands for entering new transactions, editing
existing transactions, and for reusing transaction information:
Figure 4-19:
The Edit
menu
available for
Register
window.

Using Edit Menu Commands
234
✦Edit Check/Deposit: This command is equivalent to the Edit Transaction
button (which appears in the Register window). If you choose the Edit
Check/Deposit command, QuickBooks displays the Write Checks window
so that you can edit the transaction using that tool.
The command name changes depending on the selected transaction. You
see the Edit Check command if the selected transaction is a check. You see
the Edit Deposit command if the selected transaction is a deposit.
✦New Bill Pmt–Check: This command displays the Write Checks window
so that you can record a new check transaction and record it into the
register.
✦Delete Bill Pmt–Check: The Delete Check command deletes the selected
transaction from the register. (The name of this command changes
depending on the transaction selected in the register.)
✦Memorize Check: This command, which appears when appropriate,
memorizes the selected transaction, adds the check information to
the memorized transaction list, and thereby allows you to reuse the
check information at some point in the future. (If you have a transaction
that you record frequently — for example, every month — memorizing
the transaction and then reusing it often saves you data entry time.)
✦Void Check: This command, which also appears when appropriate, lets
you void the selected check transaction.
✦Go To Transfer: This command goes to the other side of a transfer
transaction. The Go To Transfer command, obviously, makes sense and
only works only if the selected transaction is a transfer.
✦Transaction History: This command displays a window that lists all the
transactions related to the current selected transaction. Typically, you
use this Transaction History command when the selected transaction is
a customer payment. The Transaction History window would, in this
case, list all the transactions related to the customer payment transac-
tion. You can use the Transaction History window to go quickly to one of
the related transactions. Simply click the transaction listed. You can also
edit transactions shown in the Transaction History window. Click the
transaction and then the Edit Payment button to do this.
✦Notepad: This command displays the Notepad window for the selected
customer or vendor. Figure 4-20 shows the Notepad window. To enter a
note, simply type whatever you want to document. You can click the
Date Stamp button to stamp a note or part of a note with the current
system date. To print the Notepad, click the Print button. You can also
click the New To Do button to display the New To Do dialog box. The
New To Do dialog box lets you keep a To Do list for a particular cus-
tomer or vendor. Figure 4-21 shows the New To Do dialog box.

Book III
Chapter 4
Managing Cash and
Bank Accounts
Using Edit Menu Commands
235
✦Use Register: This command displays the Use Register dialog box. The
Use Register dialog box lets you select the account that you want to dis-
play in a register.
✦Change Account Color: This command displays the Change Account
Color dialog box. The Change Account Color dialog box lets you choose
another color to use as the color of the striping shown in the Register
window. To select another color, click the color square that shows the
color that you want and then click OK.
✦Use Calculator: This command predictably displays the Windows
Calculator. If you have questions about how to work with the Windows
Calculator, refer to the Windows documentation, the Window’s Help
File, or a book such as Windows XP For Dummies by Andy Rathbone
(Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
✦Simple Find: Typically, this command displays the Simple tab of the Find
window, as shown in Figure 4-22, which you can use to find transactions.
To use the Simple tab, use the Transaction Type, Customer:Job, Date,
Figure 4-21:
The New To
Do window.

Using Edit Menu Commands
236
Invoice #, and Amount boxes to describe the transaction you want.
Enter as much information as you can, but note that if you enter incor-
rect information, QuickBooks (obviously) won’t be able to find the 
transaction you’re looking for. After you describe the transaction in as
much detail as you can, click the Find button. QuickBooks displays a
list of transactions that match your search criteria (see Figure 4-23).
To go to a particular transaction, click the transaction in the list and
then click the Go To button.
✦Advanced Find: This command displays the Advanced tab of the Find
window, as shown in Figure 4-24. The Advanced tab lets you describe a
much more precise and complex set of search criteria. Essentially, you
can describe in painful detail a filter that QuickBooks should apply to
each field that’s recorded for a transaction. For example, if you want to
filter based on the account, select the account entry from the filter list.
Then open the Account drop-down list box and select one of the account
groupings that QuickBooks displays. Alternatively, you can click the
Select Accounts entry. This displays a dialog box that you can use to
select individually the accounts you want to look for. The Include Split
Detail button lets you indicate whether you want split detail information.
After you describe the filter or filters you want to use, click the Find
button. As with the Simple tab of the Find window, QuickBooks displays
a list of all the transactions that match your filter. To go to one of the
transactions listed, click it, and then click the Go To button.

Reconciling the Bank Account
238
The Report button that appears both on the Simple tab and the Advanced
tab creates a report of all the transactions that the Find command has
found. You can print this report — QuickBooks displays the report in a
regular report window — by choosing the File➪Report command or by
clicking the Print button that appears at the top of the Report window.
The Simple and the Advanced tabs of the Find window also include a
Reset button. I should say someplace that if you want to start your
search over by using a new set of search criteria or filtering criteria,
you simply click the Reset button.
✦Preferences: This command enables you to change the way that
QuickBooks works so that it best matches your firm’s accounting require-
ments. Book II, Chapter 3 discusses in detail the Preferences command.
Reconciling the Bank Account
You can reconcile a bank account with surprising speed in QuickBooks.
To reconcile the bank account, choose the Banking➪Reconcile command.
QuickBooks displays the Begin Reconciliation dialog box, shown in Figure 4-25.
To begin reconciling your account, follow these steps:
1. Select the account that you want to reconcile from the Account drop-
down list box.
2. Use the Statement Date box to identify the ending date of the bank
statement that you are using in your reconciliation.
As is always the case with date fields in QuickBooks, you enter the date
in the mm/dd/yyyy date format or you click the calendar button and use
it to select the correct date.
3. Enter the ending balance shown on your bank account statement in
the Ending Balance box.
Figure 4-25:

Reconcilia-
tion dialog
box.

4. Use the Service Charge boxes and the Interest Earned boxes to identify
the amount of any service charge or of any interest, the date of any
such transaction, and the account that you use to track those charges.
For example, if your bank statement shows a service charge, enter the
service charge amount into the first Service Charge box. Enter the date
of the service charge transaction into the Service Charge Date box.
Finally, enter an appropriate expense account for tracking service
charges into the Service Charge Account drop-down list box. (Bank
charges, for example, is a good account to track service charges.)
In a similar fashion, use the Interest Earned boxes to describe any inter-
est earned on a business account.
5. Review the statement information.
After you enter information about the bank account, the statement date,
the ending balance, and any service charge or interest earned informa-
tion, take a moment to review the information and confirm that it is cor-
rect. You’ll have a whale of a time reconciling an account if the amount
that you’re trying to reconcile to is incorrect.
6. After you make sure that everything is hunky-dory, click the Continue
button.
QuickBooks displays the Reconcile window, as shown in Figure 4-26.
Figure 4-26:
The
Reconcile
window.

7. To identify checks and payments transactions that have cleared your
bank account, click the transactions that have cleared.
The Reconcile window displays two lists of transactions: a list of checks
and payments, which appears on the left, and a list of deposits and
other credits, which appears on the right. When you click a transaction,
QuickBooks marks the transaction with a check mark. The check mark
indicates that a transaction has cleared. You can mark all the transac-
tions on a list as cleared by clicking the Mark All button. You can unmark
all the transactions on a list as uncleared by clicking the Unmark All
button.
Use the Deposits and Other Credits list to identify those deposit transac-
tions that have cleared the bank account. You identify a cleared deposit
transaction in the same way that you identify a cleared check or pay-
ment transaction. You can click a transaction, which causes QuickBooks
to mark the transaction as cleared. You can also use the Mark All and
Unmark All buttons to mark or unmark all the deposits and other credit
transactions at one time.
If you realize that, as part of the reconciliation, you’ve incorrectly
entered the service charge, interest earned, ending balance, or any
other information, click the Modify button. QuickBooks redisplays the
Begin Reconciliation dialog box (refer to Figure 4-25). Make the neces-
sary changes and click Continue to return to the Reconcile window.
8. Verify that the cleared balance equals the ending balance.
If you have provided correct information in the Begin Reconciliation
dialog box (refer to Figure 4-25) and you correctly identified all the 
transactions that have cleared your account, the ending balance should
equal the cleared balance, as shown in Figure 4-27.
9. When the ending balance equals the cleared balance, click the
Reconcile Now button.
QuickBooks permanently records your cleared transactions as cleared
and redisplays the Register window. If you can’t reconcile an account, you
can click the Leave button. QuickBooks then saves your half-completed
reconciliation so that you can come back later and finish it.
Can I interject a couple of tangential comments here? Good. If you want, you
can print a little report that summarizes your reconciliation after you click
the Reconcile Now button. (QuickBooks gives you this option in a dialog box
that it displays.) You can also click the Previous Reports button to display a
dialog box that lets you print other old reconciliation reports. While I’m on the
subject of reconciliation reports, I should also mention that you can click the
Discrepancy Report button to produce a report that lists transactions that
have been edited since you last reconciled the account.

Reviewing the Other Banking Commands
Earlier in this chapter, I describe the most common and useful banking 
commands. You may not need to use the other commands provided by the
Banking menu. Nevertheless, my compulsive personality requires that I
describe these other commands.
Order Checks & Envelopes command
The Order Checks & Envelopes command displays a submenu of commands
you use to order QuickBooks checks and envelopes or to get information
about ordering QuickBooks checks and envelopes.
Enter Credit Card Charges command
If you set up a credit card account — this is a credit card account that you
or your business would use to charge transactions — you can choose the
Banking➪Record Credit Card Charges command to display a submenu of
credit-card-related commands: Enter Credit Card Charges and Download
Credit Card Charges.
Figure 4-27:
The
Reconcile
window
after the rec-
onciliation is
complete.

Reviewing the Other Banking Commands
242
If you choose the Enter Credit Card Charges command, the Enter Credit Card
Charges window appears (see Figure 4-28). You can figure out how this
window works without my help, I’m sure. You identify the credit card
account for which you want to record transactions, and you describe the
credit card purchase by using the field at the top of the screen. You then use
the Expenses and Items tabs — these tabs work the same way as the similar
tabs in the Write Checks window — to detail the reasons and the accounts
affected by your charge.
If you choose the Download Credit Card Charges command — assuming
you’ve set up credit card accounts that allow for online services —
QuickBooks downloads recent credit card transactions directly into the
credit card register. Perhaps obviously, for this command to work, several
prerequisites must be met:
1. You need a credit card account already set up.
2. You need to have set up the credit card account for online services.
3. You need an Internet connection so QuickBooks can go grab the
credit card transactions from the credit card company.

243
Online Banking command
The Online Banking command displays a submenu of commands that you use
to apply for online banking and to see which financial institutions (banks,
savings and loans, and credit unions) let you do online banking. If you want to
do online banking — this can save businesses a ton of time — call your exist-
ing bank and ask whether it provides the service. If it does, ask for a sign-up
packet and for specific instructions on how to get going with online banking.
If you don’t like the idea of calling your bank directly, choose the Set Up
Account for Online Access command from the Online Banking submenu.
This command walks you through the process for applying for and setting
up online financial services.
When your account won’t balance
If your account won’t reconcile, the problem
stems from one of several conditions. None of
the conditions is hard to describe, but they can
be pretty hard to fix. Here’s a quick overview of
what may be causing you trouble and what may
be preventing you from reconciling your account:
 Are you working with the right account?
That sounds pretty dumb, doesn’t it? But if
you have several bank accounts, you may
be trying to reconcile the wrong account or
using the wrong statement to reconcile
your account.
 Are you missing any transactions? If the
bank has recorded transactions that you
haven’t, this causes your ending balance to
not equal your cleared balance. Look on
your statement for any transactions that you
are missing or forgot to record, and then
record these and mark them as cleared.
 Have you correctly recorded transactions?
This may also sound silly, but if you
recorded the transaction and you are a few
pennies off or a few dollars off — perhaps
you’ve transposed a couple of numbers —
you won’t be able to reconcile your
account. I commonly find that I’ve entered
a transaction or two wrong per month.
(Maybe this is because my fingers are too
arthritic to correctly record amounts.) But
it’s probably very common when you are
entering dozens and dozens of transactions
to occasionally record a transaction
wrong. The occasional errors need to be
fixed before you can reconcile an account.
Note that it’s quite likely — especially as you
are getting started — that you won’t be able to
successfully reconcile an account because of
multiple errors. If you do something like record
a transaction erroneously and then forget to
record a couple of transactions, you’ll need to
fix each of these errors in order to reconcile
your account.
One final tip: Reconciling an account is much
easier if you are using online banking. I talk
about how online banking works a little later in
this chapter.

Reviewing the Other Banking Commands
244
Can I close with an editorial comment? Online banking is a real time-saver
for business owners. If you’re not using online banking, you really should
have a pretty darn good reason for not doing so.
Online Banking Center command
Available only when you’ve setup online banking, the Online Banking Center
command displays the Online Banking Center window. You display the
Online Banking Center window to transmit online payments and online trans-
actions to your bank. How you use this window is described in the online
banking instructions that you get from your bank. In a nutshell, you display
the window by choosing a command. You click the Send/Update Account,
you provide a PIN, and then you simply watch in admiration as QuickBooks
and your bank’s computer exchange information. That’s really all there is to it.
You can use the Online Banking Center window to record online payments
(you can also record online payments by using the Write Checks window
described earlier in the chapter), to record online transfers between accounts
(you can also use the Transfer Money Between Accounts command described
earlier in the chapter), and to send messages. Because you have other ways
to do these things, I don’t show you how to accomplish these same tasks
with the Online Banking Center window. If you do want to use the Online
Banking Center window, you can refer to the earlier discussions of the Write
Checks window and the Transfer Money Between Accounts window for help
about what information goes into what fields and boxes.
Loan Manager
The Loan Manager command displays a window that lists loan accounts
you’ve sent up. This isn’t all that special, but the Loan Manager window
does do something else that is special. If you click the Add a Loan button,
QuickBooks collects loan information from you so that it can break loan pay-
ments into principal and interest.
Other Names list
The Other Names list displays a window that lists all the other names you’ve
used to record transactions. Individuals and businesses that appear on your
Other Names list are not customers, vendors, or employees. In other words,
the Other Names list includes names that don’t neatly fit into one of the stan-
dard categories.

Chapter 5: Paying Employees
In This Chapter
 Setting up do-it-yourself or Standard Payroll
 Paying employees
 Editing and voiding checks
 Paying payroll liabilities
QuickBooks provides three options for paying employees: do-it-yourself
Standard Payroll, Enhanced Payroll, and Assisted Payroll. This chapter
describes the do-it-yourself or Standard Payroll option. With the Standard
Payroll option, you do most of the work yourself, but you don’t pay very
much for your payroll processing.
As noted, QuickBooks also supplies an Enhanced Payroll option and an
Assisted Payroll option. With Enhanced Payroll, Intuit (the maker of
QuickBooks) does payroll for you and then supplies that information to
your QuickBooks data file over an Internet connection. The Assisted Payroll
option is Intuit’s alternative to outside payroll services, such as ADP or
Paychex. I don’t talk about the Enhanced Payroll option or the Assisted
Payroll option in this chapter for a simple reason: If you use either of these
options, the QuickBooks folks help you through the setup process and the
payroll processing. You don’t need my help. You’ll get their help.
Would you be terribly offended if I offered you a bit of friendly advice? If
you’re not an accountant, spend the money on Intuit’s Assisted Payroll serv-
ice or on one of the equivalent full-service payroll providers such as ADP or
Paychex. Having Intuit or ADP or Paychex do your payroll greatly simplifies
your payroll accounting work and — in my experience — saves you money
over time.
Setting Up Do-It-Yourself (Standard) Payroll
To set up do-it-yourself payroll, you step through a Web-based interview. To
start this interview, choose the Employees➪Payroll➪Order Payroll Service
command. QuickBooks displays the Payroll Setup Web page, shown in
Figure 5-1. As this Web page indicates, to set up QuickBooks payroll, the
first step is choosing a payroll option.

Setting Up Do-It-Yourself (Standard) Payroll
246
Even though you have three QuickBooks payroll options, in this chapter,
I assume that you want to use the Standard Payroll option. The Standard
Payroll option is truly a do-it-yourself solution. You do the work. You need to
understand federal and state payroll tax rules. However, you don’t have to
pay much; in fact, you can do your first payroll for free. After that, you keep
your payroll tax information up to date by subscribing to a payroll tax serv-
ice, such as the one that QuickBooks sells.
To choose the Standard Payroll option, you click the Standard Payroll’s Buy
Now hyperlink.
Signing up for a payroll service
To sign up for the payroll service after you’ve selected a particular option,
you fill in the Web page shown in Figure 5-2. You enter your business name
and address, give your firm’s employer identification number, or EIN, and
also provide credit card information so Intuit can bill you for its service.
Then you click Place My Order (which isn’t visible in Figure 5-2 but is avail-
able at the button of the Web page). QuickBooks then steps you through the
process for signup. Simply follow the on-screen instructions to describe how
your company processes payroll.

When you set up your company information for payroll, QuickBooks asks for
a bunch of information. I won’t repeat the instructions that the Web pages
provide, but essentially, you just describe how you pay your employees, to
whom you remit deductions, and other stuff like that. Read the instructions
that QuickBooks provides carefully. This takes some time. If you get into
trouble, you may want to get an outside accountant’s help to set up the
Standard Payroll Service.
Setting up employees
After you set up your company information for payroll, you’re ready to set
up employees for payroll. As part of the Standard Payroll setup, QuickBooks
displays a Web page where you may add your employees. You may also add
employees by displaying the Employees Center. (Choose the Employees➪
Employee Center command and click the New Employee button.) When you
choose the New Employee button, QuickBooks displays the New Employee
window, as shown in Figure 5-3.

Describing an employee
To describe an employee, you complete the fields supplied on the Personal
tab. All this stuff is self-explanatory; you enter the person’s first name into the
First Name box, the person’s middle initial goes into the M.I. box, and so forth.
If you want to collect and store additional information for an employee
(such as his bank account number for direct deposit), you click the
Additional Info tab. This tab provides a Define Field button that you can use
to collect custom bits of information about an employee. To use the Custom
Field option, click the Define Field button, and then use the Define Field
dialog box to define the fields that you want to add.
Providing payroll and tax information
Use the Payroll and Compensation Info tab to describe how an employee’s
salary or wages are calculated, as shown in Figure 5-4. You enter the payroll
item into the Earnings area. For example, if an employee earns an annual
salary of $30,000, you enter the salary payroll item into the Item Name
column. Then you enter the annual salary of $30,000 into the Hourly/Annual
Rate column. Use the Pay Period drop-down list box to identify the pay
period. Optionally, use the Class drop-down list box to classify payments
to this employee.

To describe which taxes an employee pays, click the Taxes button.
QuickBooks displays the Taxes dialog box, shown in Figure 5-5. Use the
Federal tab to identify the employee’s filing status, number of allowances
claimed, and any extra withholding specified. In addition, use the Subject
To check boxes to indicate whether this employee is subject to Medicare,
Social Security, or federal unemployment tax, or if the employee is eligible for
an earned income credit. Note that not all employees are subject to Medicare
and Social Security taxes. Consult your tax advisor for more information.

The State tab supplies boxes that you can use to describe state taxes, obvi-
ously. I don’t show the State tax tab here because the State tax tab varies
depending on the state you’re in.
The Other tab lets you describe and store any local tax information, such as
a city income tax. Again, what you see on the Other tab depends on your
locality. For this reason, I don’t show it here.
The Sick/Vacation button displays the Sick & Vacation dialog box, shown in
Figure 5-6. This dialog box lets you specify how sick or vacation pay or per-
sonal leave time is accrued payroll period by payroll period. You can specify
the number of sick or vacation leave hours at the time you are setting up pay-
roll in the Hours Available As Of text box. You can use the Accrual Period
drop-down list box to specify how often sick or vacation pay should be
accrued. If sick or vacation pay is accrued, use the Hour Accrued Per box to
identify how many hours of sick or vacation time an employee earns each
paycheck, hour, or at the beginning of the year. If you have set a maximum
number of sick hours or vacation hours that an employee can accumulate,
enter this value into the Maximum Number of Hours box. If you want to reset
the sick hours and vacation hours to zero at the beginning of each year,
select the Reset Hours Each New Year? check box.
The Vacation area of the Sick & Vacation dialog box works the same way as
the Sick area. For example, enter the number of vacation hours available in the
Hours Available As Of box. Use the Accrual drop-down list box to specify
how often employees earn vacation time. Use the Hours Accrued Per Paycheck
and the Maximum Number of Hours boxes to control how vacation time
accrual calculations work. Finally, select the Reset Hours Each New Year?
check box to zero out vacation time at the beginning of each new year.

If you’ve chosen to use the Direct Deposit option — you do this when you
set up the Standard Payroll Service — click the Direct Deposit button on the
Payroll Info tab. QuickBooks then prompts you to supply the direct deposit
information necessary to directly deposit checks for employees.
Providing other employment-related information
If you select the Employment Info option from the Change Tabs drop-down
list box, QuickBooks displays the Employment tab. The Employment tab lets
you store the hire date, fire date, and other similar bits of employment data.
Setting up year-to-date amounts
If you’re setting up the Standard Payroll Service at the very beginning of the
business’s operation or at the beginning of the year, you don’t have to set up
any year-to-date amounts (because the year-to-date amounts all equal zero).
If you’re switching to the Standard Payroll Service sometime in mid-year,
however, you do need to set up year-to-date amounts. For this reason, the
QuickBooks Standard Payroll setup process wizard walks you through the
process for recording year-to-date amounts.
If an outside service bureau such as ADP or Paychex has been doing your pay-
roll processing, the final payroll report from this outside service bureau
probably supplies all the information that you need to set up the Standard
Payroll Service. If you’ve been working with a bookkeeper or accountant to
get payroll done, you should be able to get this person’s help to describe
year-to-date payroll amounts.
Checking your payroll setup data
As part of the Standard Payroll setup process, QuickBooks (or you) may
identify suspicious payroll data that doesn’t seem right — perhaps an
employee that you know you’ve paid shows no year-to-date wages. In this
case, you correct the incorrect data by following the on-screen instructions.
Note, however, that QuickBooks Standard Payroll setup process may also
identify suspicious payroll data that is, in fact, correct. For example, in the
state of Washington (where I live), officers are not subject to state unemploy-
ment insurance if they so elect. QuickBooks, however, doesn’t know this, so
it flags officers who are not marked as subject to state unemployment insur-
ance as possible errors.
Again, if you don’t feel comfortable answering some of these payroll setup
questions, get an accountant’s help. Quite frankly, when you have an outside
service bureau prepare your payroll checks, what you’re really paying for is
the expertise and knowledge about how all this payroll processing stuff
works. You’re not really paying for the computer time and the paper on
which the checks are written.

Scheduling Payroll Runs
252
Scheduling Payroll Runs
The Standard Payroll setup process also steps you through the work of
scheduling your payroll runs. In other words, if you will run your payroll
every week or twice a month or whatever, the setup process asks you to
describe the schedule. Again, as with the other tasks the Standard Payroll
setup process helps you with, all you need to do is provide a few bits and
pieces of information.
Paying Employees
After you go through the steps required to set up the QuickBooks payroll
processing capability, paying employees — thank goodness — is pretty easy.
To pay employees, follow these steps:
1. Choose Employees➪Pay Employees➪Scheduled Payroll.
QuickBooks displays the Employees Center window.
2. Start the Scheduled Payroll you want to run.
To start the scheduled payroll run you want to run, click the scheduled
payroll shown in the list box that appears at the top of the Employee
Center window. Then choose the Start Scheduled Payroll button.
3. Use the Check Date box to supply the date that you want to appear on
payroll checks.
Identify the date on which the payroll period ends in the Pay Period
Ends box.
4. Use the Bank Account drop-down list box to identify the bank account
on which you want to write checks.
5. Verify the employees whom you want to pay.
QuickBooks lists the active employees included in the scheduled pay-
roll. You want to make sure that the list of selected employees is right.
You can click listed employees to select and unselect them.
6. Click Continue.
QuickBooks calculates the payroll checks and payroll deduction
amounts for each of the employees selected. To accept the previewed
paycheck described or shown in the dialog box, click its Create
Paychecks button.
7. Click the Print Paychecks or Print Pay Stubs button.

Book III
Chapter 5
Paying Employees
Editing and Voiding Paychecks
253
After you click the Create Paychecks button, QuickBooks displays a dialog
box that lets you either print paychecks or pay stubs for direct deposit.
Click the appropriate button and follow the on-screen instructions. When
you click either button, QuickBooks displays the Select Paychecks/Pay
Stubs to Print dialog box. You should confirm the bank account from which
you want to write the checks. If you’re printing checks, you should also use
the First Check Number box to supply the preprinted form number shown
on the first payroll check that you’ll print. You should also confirm that
the employee paychecks listed in the dialog box are those that you want to
print. After you confirm that the paycheck printing information is correct,
click OK. QuickBooks displays the Print Checks dialog box (the same one
you use to print any check). You then print checks in the usual fashion.
If you want to deselect a paycheck for printing, click the check column
to remove the check mark and, thereby, deselect the paycheck.
8. Distribute the paychecks or pay stubs.
Obviously, after you print the checks, you sign and then distribute them.
I’ll leave you to your own devices here. I am sure you know how to find
employees whom you need to pay, and furthermore, how to hand them
their paychecks. Heck, they’re probably standing beside your desk right
now waiting for you to finish the payroll checks anyway.
Editing and Voiding Paychecks
Be careful when you want to change payroll check information. Payroll
checks are a little trickier than regular checks because the information from
the payroll checks affects a bunch of different payroll counters. For example,
payroll checks bump up someone’s gross wages for the year. Payroll checks
also affect the deduction amounts. For this reason, when you want to make
a change or void a paycheck that you previously created, you choose the
Employees➪Edit/Void Paychecks command. When you do this, QuickBooks
displays the Edit/Void Paychecks window. This window lists paychecks that
you’ve previously created and printed. To change one of the paychecks listed,
double-click the paycheck. When QuickBooks displays the Paychecks window,
click the Paycheck Detail button. When QuickBooks displays the Review
Paychecks window, use it to make the appropriate change to the paycheck.
Note that you can also make changes to other details, such as the name or
address, by using the Paycheck window.
To void the paycheck shown in the Paycheck window, choose the Edit➪Void
Paycheck command.
After you edit or void a check, you click the Save & Close or the Save & New
button to save your changes to the paycheck.

Paying Payroll Liabilities
254
Paying Payroll Liabilities
Amounts that you withhold from employees’ paychecks become liabilities
that you later need to pay. For example, if you withhold federal income tax
deductions, you need to remit those to the Internal Revenue Service.
To pay payroll tax liabilities, choose the Employees➪Payroll Taxes and
Liabilities➪Pay Scheduled Liabilities command. QuickBooks displays the
Employee Center window. It lets you select which payroll liabilities you want
to pay. Click the liability you want to pay and then click the View/Pay button.
QuickBooks writes a check to pay the selected liability. You would print this
check in the usual way.

 Reviewing the Expert Analysis reports
 Using the Decision Tools command
 Creating an accountant’s copy of the QuickBooks data file
I
n this short chapter, I want to quickly go over stuff that accountants need
or want to know. Because I assume you are an accountant, I go a little
faster here than I have in other chapters of this book. I also don’t provide
blow-by-blow instructions for working with the windows and dialog boxes
that this chapter discusses.
If you find yourself just a wee bit frustrated with me at this point, go ahead
and peruse the paragraphs of this chapter — keeping in mind that what I
discuss in this chapter is pretty advanced accounting stuff. You don’t want
to do the things that this chapter talks about unless you really know your
debits and credits. And if you do know your debits and credits, you should
find the information I provide here to be all that you need.
Working with QuickBooks Journal Entries
QuickBooks makes it easy for you — an accountant — to record journal
entries. If you’ve spent any time working with QuickBooks, you may know
that most of the journal entries that get recorded into the QuickBooks data
file are recorded automatically. If somebody writes a check, for example,
QuickBooks records the journal entry for that. When somebody creates an
invoice, again, QuickBooks records the journal entry for that.
In some cases, however, somebody — probably you — needs to record a jour-
nal entry to get some transaction into the QuickBooks data file. For example,
you use journal entries to record depreciation, to accrue liabilities, and to
record the disposal of assets.

Working with QuickBooks Journal Entries
258
Recording a journal entry
To record a journal entry, choose Company➪Make Journal Entries.
QuickBooks displays the General Journal Entries window, as shown in
Figure 1-1.
You can probably figure out how to use the Make General Journal Entries
window yourself. You enter the general journal entry date into the Date box.
You use the Entry No. box to number journal entries or to assign them some
meaningful code. After you provide this basic information, you use the
columns of the General Journal Entries window to record the journal entry.
You don’t need me to tell you that the general ledger account number or
name goes into the Account column, the debit amount into the Debit
column, and the credit amount into the Credit column. You may find it
useful, though, to be reminded that you can use the Memo column to enter
some description of the debit or credit; you can use the Name column to
identify the customer, vendor, employee or other name associated with
the credit or debit; and you can use the Class column to classify the debit
or credit.

Reversing a journal entry
To reverse a journal entry, first display the General Journal Entries window
by choosing the Company➪Make Journal Entries command. QuickBooks then
displays the Make General Journal Entries window, as shown in Figure 1-1.
Use the Previous and Next buttons to page through general journal entries
that you’ve already entered. Found it? Good. How you reverse this entry
depends on which version of QuickBooks you’re using.
✦If you’re using QuickBooks Pro: Print the general journal entry by click-
ing the Print button. Then, using the printed journal entry as a reference
source, enter a new journal except with the debits and credits reversed.
In other words, if the to-be-reversed journal entry debits cash for $500
and credits interest income for $500, you enter a journal entry that cred-
its cash for $500 and debits interest income for $500.
✦If you’re using QuickBooks Premier or QuickBooks Enterprise
Solutions: When you find the journal entry that you want to reverse,
click the Reverse button. The Reverse button appears along the top
edge of the General Journal Entries window. QuickBooks reverses the 
general journal entry by entering a transaction into the next accounting
month with the debits and credits flip-flopped.
Book I, Chapter 1 discusses the basics of accounting. Chapter 2 in that book
describes basic bookkeeping, including how debits and credits work.
Chapter 3 (also in Book I) describes how to do special accounting magic
tricks, including how to and why to enter reversing journal entries. If you
find yourself in this chapter even though you’re not a degreed accountant,
you may want to peruse the information from Chapters 1, 2, and 3 of Book I
in order to understand what journal entries are and why in the world one
would want to reverse one.
Editing journal entries
Typically, you won’t want to fool around and later change the journal entries.
However, if you do feel the need to make changes, QuickBooks provides an
Edit menu with commands that you can use for just this purpose. For exam-
ple, QuickBooks supplies a Delete General Journal command that you can
use to delete the journal entry shown in the Make General Journal Entries
window. QuickBooks also supplies a Void General Journal command that you
can use to void the general journal entry shown in the window. Typically —
and again you already know this — you don’t want to delete general journal
entries. Instead, you want to void them. Enough said.

Updating Company Information
260
Updating Company Information
The Company menu supplies a bunch of other commands in addition to the
Make Journal Entry command. Accountants may have occasion to use the
Company Information command. The Company Information command
enables you to update company name and address information, fiscal and
tax year settings, the tax form used to report profits, and taxpayer identifica-
tion numbers.
Working with the Memorized Transactions
A quick tip: Most of the transactions that people enter into QuickBooks can
be memorized by choosing the Edit➪Memorize command when the transac-
tion shows in the open window. You (or someone else) can later reuse a
memorized transaction. You choose the Lists➪Memorized Transaction List
command and then, when QuickBooks displays the list of memorized trans-
actions (shown in Figure 1-2), you double-click the transaction that you want
to enter again.

Reviewing the Accountant & Taxes Reports
The Accountant & Taxes menu appears when you choose the Reports➪
Accountant & Taxes command. Although I don’t show pictures of each
report that gets displayed by choosing a command from the Accountant &
Taxes menu (I do show the Trial Balance report in Figure 1-3), I want to point
out that hidden on this submenu are more than a dozen menu commands
and reports that are particularly interesting and useful to accountants.
The following list identifies these reports:
✦Adjusted Trial Balance: The Adjusted Trial Balance menu command
produces, of course, a Trial Balance Report as of a particular date.
What’s unique about this version of the trial balance report (as com-
pared to the one described next) is that adjusting journal entries are
clearly highlighted. (Adjusting journal entries are those that were
marked as such when made. Look back at Figure 1-1 if you’re interested
in this. See that Adjusting Journal Entry check box? You check that box
to indicate an adjusting journal entry.)
Figure 1-3:

report.

Reviewing the Accountant & Taxes Reports
262
✦Trial Balance: The Trial Balance menu command produces, of course, a
Trial Balance Report as of a particular date (refer to Figure 1-3).
✦General Ledger: The General Ledger menu command produces a report
that simply lists the accounts in your Chart of Accounts and then
changes the account for the month or year or whatever accounting
period that you specify.
✦Transaction Detail by Account: This menu command produces the
report that you would expect: a list of the transactions that affect a 
particular account.
✦Adjusting Journal Entries: The Adjusting Journal Entries command pro-
duces a list of the journal entries that you or someone else marked as
being adjusting journal entries.
✦Journal: The Journal menu command produces a report that lists trans-
actions by transaction type and number.
✦Audit Trail: The Audit Trail Report is pretty important for accountants —
particularly for accountants who are concerned or worried that transac-
tions have changed when they should not have changed. The Audit Trail
Report lists transactions by the person entering the transactions. The
Audit Trail Report also lists changes to transactions and identifies who
made the changes. You turn on the Audit Trail feature as described in
Book II, Chapter 3. If it’s important for you to know who is doing what,
the Audit Trail Report provides the answer.
✦Closing Date Exception Report: If you finalize the accounting data for
the year (referred to as “closing the books”) — and you should — the
Closing Date Exception Report identifies changes to closed transactions.
Closing the QuickBooks data file is described in Book VII, Chapter 3.
✦Voided/Deleted Transactions Summary: The Voided/Deleted Transactions
Summary command produces a summary report of voided transactions
and deleted transactions.
✦Voided/Deleted Transactions Detail: The Voided/Deleted Transactions
Detail command produces a detailed listing of all voided transactions
and all deleted transactions.
✦Transaction List By Date: The Transaction List By Date Report lists
transactions in order of date of entry.
✦Account Listing: The Account Listing Report lists all the accounts on
your Chart of Accounts. The report also gives the account balance and
indicates the line on the tax return where the account is reported.
✦Fixed Asset Listing: The Fixed Asset Listing report lists all the fixed
assets on your Fixed Assets List.
✦Income Tax Preparation: The Income Tax Preparation Report shows on
which lines of which tax forms account balances are reported.

Book IV
Chapter 1
For Accountants
Only
A Few Words about the Decision Tools
263
✦Income Tax Summary: The Income Tax Summary Report uses your
income tax preparation data to show what amounts should be reported
on what lines of your tax forms. For example, if you are a sole proprietor
filing a Schedule C tax form, QuickBooks looks at all the accounts that
you use to track gross receipts or sales. Then it totals the balances in
those accounts and shows the actual value that should be reported on
the gross receipts or sales line of your Schedule C tax form.
✦Income Tax Detail: The Income Tax Detail Report gives the same infor-
mation as the Income Tax Summary Report — except that this report
shows the individual accounts that get bunched together to produce the
tax line total.
Reviewing the Expert Analysis Reports
While I’m on the subject of the Accountant & Taxes Report, I should also
mention that some versions of QuickBooks, such as QuickBooks Premier
include a Reports➪Expert Analysis command. If you choose the Reports➪
Expert Analysis command, QuickBooks displays the Expert Analysis submenu.
The Expert Analysis submenu provides another set of menu commands that
let you display income statements and balance sheets that compare one
month’s data to the previous month’s data, or one quarter’s data to the 
previous quarter’s data, or one year’s data to the previous year’s data.
I don’t discuss the individual Expert Analysis reports here because the menu
commands that appear on this submenu are very self-explanatory. However,
you should know that these useful reports are there. If you have time and
you’ve already accumulated several months or several years’ worth of data,
use these reports to make period-to-period comparisons.
A Few Words about the Decision Tools
If you are a professional accountant, you probably don’t use the Decision
Tools command. However, you should know that if you or one of your clients
or co-workers chooses the Company➪Planning & Budgeting➪Decision Tools
command, QuickBooks displays a submenu that includes commands that
start little tutorials of how to manage the finances of a small firm. For example,
if someone chooses the Measure Profitability command from the Decision
Tools submenu, he sees first the window shown in Figure 1-4. This Measure
Profitability window enables someone to step through a pretty darn cool
tutorial about how firms can look at their profit margins and use profit
margin data to make better decisions.

Creating an Accountant’s Copy of the QuickBooks Data File
264
Other Decision Tools submenu commands enable a business owner or man-
ager to analyze the financial strength of the firm; compare debt and ownership
percentages; learn how to depreciate assets; manage the firm’s receivables;
figure out whether someone is an employee, an independent contractor, or a
temporary employee; and even improve cash flow. All this stuff is pretty cool.
If you know of a business owner who wants to use QuickBooks for more than
just producing forms or getting data ready to file a tax return, be sure that
this person knows that the Decision tools are there. Also be sure that he or
she knows that the Decision tools are written not for accountants — not for
people like you and me — but for regular folk who need practical, easy-to-
understand discussions of business accounting and financial management.
Creating an Accountant’s Copy 
of the QuickBooks Data File
QuickBooks makes it easier for accountants to work with client data files.
Consider this scenario: You have a client who needs help finishing up the
year’s accounting period. You have two choices. First, you can drive over
to his or her shop, probably getting stuck in traffic along the way, and
find yourself wondering if you can bill the client $150 for your travel time.
Second, you can have the client use the Create Accountant’s Copy feature in
Figure 1-4:
The
Measure
Profitability
window.

Book IV
Chapter 1
For Accountants
Only
Creating an Accountant’s Copy of the QuickBooks Data File
265
QuickBooks and simply e-mail you or snail-mail you a copy of the QuickBooks
data file. You can then review this accountant’s copy of the data file, make
whatever fixes or changes are appropriate, and then send the changes to be
made back to the client. The client can then easily import these changes into
his or her existing QuickBooks file and go off on his or her merry way. Pretty
neat, right? This is exactly what the accountant’s copy lets you do.
Creating an accountant’s copy
Your client creates the accountant’s copy of the QuickBooks data file by
using his or her version of QuickBooks and the real data file. Fortunately, the
process is very straightforward. Here’s what your client needs to do:
1. Choose the File➪Accountant’s Copy➪Create Accountant’s Copy 
command.
QuickBooks first displays a message telling the client how the accoun-
tant’s copy works. This is the same information that I provide in the
opening paragraph of this discussion about the accountant’s copy, so
I won’t repeat myself here. The client clicks Next to continue.
2. Specify a dividing date.
When he clicks the Next button to continue with the creation of an
accountant’s copy, QuickBooks asks the client for the dividing date.
Transactions falling before this date can be edited only inside the
accountant’s copy. Transactions falling after this data can be edited
inside both the accountant’s copy and the client’s copy. When the client
clicks Next to continue, another message appears telling him that
QuickBooks must close all the windows to create an accountant’s copy.
QuickBooks may also tell the client to insert a disk. When the client
clicks OK and inserts the disk (if necessary), QuickBooks displays the
Save Accountant’s Copy To dialog box, shown in Figure 1-5.
Figure 1-5:
The Save
Accountant’s
Copy To
dialog box.

Creating an Accountant’s Copy of the QuickBooks Data File
266
3. Name the accountant’s copy.
Use the File Name box of the Save Accountant’s Copy to dialog box to
name the accountant’s copy of the QuickBooks data file. If necessary,
the client can also use the Save In drop-down list box to specify where
the accountant’s copy of the QuickBooks data file should be saved.
The client needs to remember where the accountant’s copy of the file
gets saved. This file is given to the accountant — via e-mail, snail-mail,
or saved onto a disk — in order for the accountant to be able to use it.
4. Create the file.
After the client names the accountant’s copy of the data file and indi-
cates, if necessary, where the accountant’s copy should be saved, the
client clicks Save. QuickBooks then saves an accountant’s copy of the
QuickBooks data file.
This data file is then transmitted to the accountant.
Accountant copies make use of three file types. The Accountant Transfer
File (with the .qbx file extension) is what a client creates and gives to the
accountant. The actual Accountant’s Copy (with the .qba file extension)
is what the accountant works with after he or she opens the Accountant
Transfer File. And finally, there’s the Accountant Export File (with the .aif
file extension), which is discussed later.
Obviously, it may not actually be your client who takes these steps; you may
have to do the dirty work. In either case, however, that’s how the process
works. Note, however, that the real time savings for the accountant and the
cost savings to the client occur when you can get the client to choose the
command and work with the dialog box. You can then charge billable time for
actually working with QuickBooks data rather than fiddle-faddling with the file.
Using an accountant’s copy
You use the accountant’s copy by choosing the File➪Accountant’s Copy➪
Convert Accountant’s Copy Transfer File command. When you choose this
command, QuickBooks displays a series of message boxes explaining how
you work with the accountant’s copy. To move back and forth through the
message boxes, click Next and Back. After you click Next on the last message
box, QuickBooks displays the Open Accountant’s Copy dialog box, shown in
Figure 1-6.
Use the Look In drop-down list box to identify the location of the accoun-
tant’s copy. If necessary, enter the accountant’s copy filename into the File
Name box. When you click Open, QuickBooks prompts you to name the
accountant’s copy and then opens the accountant’s copy. Note that you
won’t be able to make the same changes to an accountant’s copy that you
can make to a regular QuickBooks data file. QuickBooks limits the sort of
changes that you can make in an accountant’s copy.

267
Reusing an accountant’s copy
If you’ve already opened an accountant’s copy file once, you can reuse the
accountant’s copy by choosing the File➪Open Previous Company command.
When you do this, QuickBooks displays a list of the previous company files
(including accountant’s copy files) that you’ve worked with. When you click
the accountant’s copy you want to work with, QuickBooks opens the data
file so that you can continue your magic
Exporting client changes
After you have used an accountant’s copy to correct transactions or to enter
new transactions, you export the changes so that they can later be imported
into the client’s data file. To do this, choose the File➪Accountant’s Copy➪
View/Export Changes for Client command. QuickBooks first displays a
window that lists the changes you made to the accountant’s copy, shown in
Figure 1-7. Note that you can print this list or create a .pdf of it by clicking
the Print or Save As PDF button.
If you click the Export button, QuickBooks displays the Save Accountant’s
Export to dialog box (not shown). This dialog box works like a standard
Windows dialog box for saving a file or document. You use the Save In drop-
down list box to identify the location of the changes file. Then use the File
Name box to give the file a unique name. When you click Save, QuickBooks
saves the changes that you’ve made into a file. You later import this file, or
have the client import this file, into the QuickBooks data file.
Figure 1-6:
The Open
Accountant’s
Copy
Transfer File
dialog box.

Creating an Accountant’s Copy of the QuickBooks Data File
268
You don’t keep your accountant’s copy of the data file. In other words, the
accountant’s copy is just a temporary copy of the data file that you use to
identify and create a set of changes necessary to update or correct client’s
records. After you make the changes, you export the changes to a changes
file. Then the client imports those changes (as discussed in the next sec-
tion). If you make changes again some time in the near future, you have the
client create a new — a brand new — accountant’s copy.
To identify when you are working with an accountant’s copy, QuickBooks
displays the parenthetical phrase (Accountant’s Copy) along the top of the
QuickBooks program window. QuickBooks also identifies regular QuickBooks
data files for which accountant’s copies have been created by adding the
parenthetical phrase (Accountant’s Copy Exists). This phrase appears only on
the QuickBooks program window title bar from the point that the client cre-
ates the accountant’s copy to the point that the client imports changes from
the accountant’s copy.

Importing accountant’s changes
Your clients import the changes that you’ve made in the accountant’s copy
of the data file into their working copy of the data file. In order to do this,
the client chooses the File➪Accountant’s Copy➪Client Activities➪Import
Accountant’s Changes command.
QuickBooks displays the Import Accountant’s Changes dialog box, as shown
in Figure 1-8. To use the Import Accountant’s Changes dialog box, the client
uses the Look In drop-down list box to identify the location of the changes
file. After the client identifies the location — this may be the disk with the
changes file on it — the client should be able to see the changes file in the
middle of the Import Accountant’s Changes dialog box. The accountant can
double-click the changes file in order to import the changes into his or her
QuickBooks data file. QuickBooks, by the way, displays a window similar to
the one shown in Figure 1-7 to highlight the accountant’s changes to the file
for the client.
QuickBooks prompts the client to back up the QuickBooks data file. I don’t
describe that process here, but I go into a lot of detail about how to back up
a data file in Book VII, Chapter 3.
After the client imports the changes, QuickBooks removes the parenthetical
phrase (Accountant’s Copy Exists) from the QuickBooks program window
title bar.

Canceling accountant’s changes
Here’s a little question for you: What happens if the client gives you an
accountant’s copy of the QuickBooks data file and then realizes that either
you won’t be making changes or the client doesn’t want to accept the
changes? Bummer, right? Well, not really.
When a client creates an accountant’s copy of the QuickBooks data file,
QuickBooks marks the client’s data file as one that can be modified through
the accountant’s changes. QuickBooks does this in order to later allow the
accountant’s changes. But if those changes won’t be made, the client
unmarks the data file as available for changes. To do this, the client chooses
the File➪Accountant’s Copy➪Client Activities➪Cancel Accountant’s Changes
command. When the client chooses this command, QuickBooks displays a
message indicating that the client is choosing to cancel out of accountant’s
copy mode. After the client chooses this command, the client won’t be able
to import any changes created by using the canceled accountant’s copy.

Chapter 2: Preparing Financial
Statements and Reports
In This Chapter
 Producing a report
 Working with the Report window
 Modifying a report
 Processing multiple reports
QuickBooks produces — oh, I don’t know — about 100 different financial
statements and reports. I tried to count them for purposes of writing
this chapter, but lost track after I had counted 90-some reports. I figured
that was close enough for my purposes here.
Because QuickBooks contains so many reports, I don’t provide individual-
ized descriptions of each report in this chapter. Rather, I talk about some
of the stuff that you need to do before you prepare financial statements.
Then, after covering those basics, I talk about how you produce and modify
reports, and about some of the useful tools that QuickBooks supplies for
working with reports.
Some Wise Words Up Front
This is an obvious point, but you should note that the reports you produce in
QuickBooks are only as good as the data file. If you have good, rich information
in your QuickBooks data file, if it doesn’t contain too many mistakes, and if
all the transactions are entered, your reports should be pretty darn good.
This simple observation has one important ramification: Often, the first step
in preparing good financial statements and useful reports is collecting all
the data. In other words, you want to make sure that you’ve entered all the
invoices, purchase orders, checks, and so forth. You also want to make sure
that any special accounting transactions, such as for depreciation or asset
sales or accruals, have been entered. (Perhaps you need your accountant’s
help for this.)
The other chapters of this book talk about how to collect and record all
sorts of information, so there’s no need to talk more about that here. But
just to beat this thing to death, the first step in producing a good financial
statement or a good report is to collect the right information.

Producing a Report
272
Producing a Report
As I mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, QuickBooks provides
roughly 100 different financial statements and accounting reports. You get
to these reports by opening the Reports menu. The Reports menu, shown in
Figure 2-1, arranges reports into roughly a dozen different categories, includ-
ing Company & Financial, Customers & Receivables, Sales, Jobs & Time, and
so forth.
To produce just about any of the reports available through the Reports
menu, you first select the Report category. For example, if you want to pro-
duce a standard financial statement, such as a profit & loss statement, you
choose the Reports➪Company & Financial command. QuickBooks displays
the Company & Financial submenu, as shown in Figure 2-2. This submenu
lists the various types of financial statements available.
You pick the submenu command that describes the financial statement that
you want. For example, if you want a standard profit & loss financial state-
ment, you choose the Profit & Loss Standard command. After you choose
the submenu command, QuickBooks displays the Report window for the
report that you selected, as shown in Figure 2-3.

Working with the Report Window
274
Working with the Report Window
If you are comfortable working with Microsoft Windows, working with the
QuickBooks Report window should be a snap. Typically, a report won’t fit
within a window because it contains too much data. In this case, however,
QuickBooks adds scroll bars, both vertical and horizontal, that you can use
to scroll the window around. Pretty straightforward, right?
Along the top edge of the window, QuickBooks displays both buttons and
boxes. You use these buttons and boxes to change the display of the Report
window and to control the information shown in the Report window. In the
next section, I describe each of these buttons and boxes.
Working with Report window buttons
The Report window typically provides eight different buttons: Modify
Report, Memorize, Print, Email, Excel, Hide Header, Collapse, and Refresh.
You can find out what these command buttons do by experimentation. 
Or, if you don’t have time for that, read through the following sections.
Modify Report
The Modify Report button displays the Modify Report dialog box. I won’t go
into any detail about this command button here because a later section of
this chapter, “Modifying a Report,” talks in gritty detail about how you use
this command button to customize a report.
Memorize
The Memorize button displays the Memorize Report dialog box, shown in
Figure 2-4. The Memorize Report dialog box lets you memorize, or perma-
nently save, a particular set of report creation settings. After you memorize
these settings, you can later produce the exact same report by choosing the
memorized report from the Reports➪Memorized Reports submenu.
You can not only save a memorized report in the Memorized Report Group,
but also save it in a memorized report group. To do this, select the Save in
Memorized Report Group check box. Then use the Save in Memorized
Report Group drop-down list box to select the report group in which the
memorized report should be saved.

Print
The Print command button enables you to print the report. When you click
Print, QuickBooks (sometimes after a bit of annoyance) displays the Print
Reports dialog box, as shown in Figure 2-5. The Print Reports dialog box lets
you choose how the report should print and where it should print. For exam-
ple, the Settings tab lets you choose the printer, select a page orientation
(either portrait or landscape), specify that you only want to print a range of
the report’s pages, and control page breaking.
The Margins tab of the Print Reports menu, shown in Figure 2-6, lets you
specify the margins that QuickBooks should use on the printed report pages.
You specify the top, right, bottom, and left margins in inches.

276
Click the Preview button, provided on the Print Reports dialog box, to dis-
play the Preview window. The Preview window shows what your printed
report pages look like. The Preview window also includes buttons to page to
the previous and next pages of the report, to zoom in and out on the report,
and to print the report to paper.
After you’ve used the Settings tab and the Margins tab to specify how
QuickBooks should print a report, click Print. QuickBooks sends the
report to your printer.
Email
The Email command button lets you e-mail a copy of the report as an attach-
ment. When you click Email, QuickBooks starts your e-mail program for you.
Export
If you click the Export button, QuickBooks displays the Basic tab of the
Export Report dialog box, as shown in Figure 2-7. The Export Report dialog
box lets you take the information in a report and copy it to a file that a
spreadsheet program such as Microsoft Excel can easily open. You can send
the copy to a new Excel spreadsheet, to an existing Excel spreadsheet, or to
a .CSV (comma separated values) file, which can be opened by just about
any spreadsheet or database program. If you want to copy the report to a
new spreadsheet, select the new Excel workbook option.
If you want to copy the report to an existing Excel spreadsheet, select the
existing Excel workbook option. Then you click the Browse button. When Excel
displays the Open Microsoft Excel File dialog box, you use it to identify the
specific Excel workbook that you want to open.

Preparing Financial

Reports
Working with the Report Window
277
If you click the Advanced button in the Export Report dialog box,
QuickBooks displays the Advanced tab of the Export Report dialog box,
shown in Figure 2-8. This dialog box allows you to control what formatting
QuickBooks copies to Excel (do this with the Formatting Options check
boxes), to turn on or turn off certain Excel formatting features (do this with
the Excel Features check boxes), and to set up some preliminary workbook
printing information in Excel (do this with the Printing Options radio but-
tons). This stuff all relates to how Excel works. If you’re comfortable working
with Excel, go ahead and make the changes that you want. If you aren’t com-
fortable working with Excel, go ahead and accept QuickBooks’ default sug-
gestions. You can change all this stuff later, rather easily, in Excel.
If you’re working with QuickBooks, know that Excel is a wonderful tool for
digging deeper into your data. In fact, in several chapters of this book, I
assume that you are going to exchange information between Excel and
QuickBooks. If you’ve never done this, or if you haven’t yet read those chap-
ters, consider acquiring Excel and then taking the time to learn that powerful
spreadsheet product. Also note that next time you buy a PC, you may have
the option of getting Microsoft Excel as part of the purchase price. Microsoft
Excel comes with Microsoft Office.
Hide Header
The Hide Header button and the Collapse button change the way the report
appears in the Report window and, if printed, on the page.
You click the Hide Header button to remove the header information, such as
the company name. If you hide the header, you can click the Hide Header
button again to replace the header.
Figure 2-8:

Advanced
tab of the

Working with the Report Window
278
Collapse
The Collapse button collapses detail on a report. QuickBooks doesn’t show
subaccounts on a collapsed report — only accounts.
To uncollapse a report that you previously collapsed, click the Expand
button. QuickBooks replaces the Collapse button with the Expand button
when the Report window shows a collapsed report.
Don’t spend any time trying to figure out what the Hide Header or Collapse/
Expand buttons do. If you have a question, simply display a report in the
Report window and choose the command button about which you have a
question. The changes in the Report window show you what the command
button does.
Refresh
The Refresh button tells QuickBooks to update a report’s information for
changes in the QuickBooks data file. This sounds crazy at first, but you can
actually leave report windows open. This means that a report window may
show a profit & loss statement, for example, from a week ago. If you’ve
entered several transactions in the last week, the report data may no longer
be correct. By clicking the Refresh button, QuickBooks knows it should
update the report for the most recent changes.
QuickBooks typically prompts you to update a report for changes to the
QuickBooks data file. If you don’t follow QuickBooks’ suggestion to update,
however, you can later click Refresh to update.
Using the Report window boxes
The Report window provides five boxes: Dates, From, To, Columns, and Sort
By. These boxes also enable you to control the information shown in the
Report window and the appearance of the information.
Date boxes
The Dates, From, and To boxes, for example, let you tell QuickBooks what
reporting interval you want to show in the report. In other words, you use
these boxes to tell QuickBooks for what month, quarter, year, or whatever,
that you want the report prepared.
Columns box
The Columns drop-down list box displays a set of column choices. Initially,
QuickBooks displays a single total column for a report. However, if you pro-
duce, for example, a report that summarizes annual income and expense

Book IV
Chapter 2
Preparing Financial
Statements and
Reports
Working with the Report Window
279
data, you can use the Columns drop-down list box to tell QuickBooks that
you want to see monthly columns. In this situation, QuickBooks shows an
annual income statement, but it also shows columns for January, February,
March, and so forth. To see how this works, take a look at Figure 2-9. The
profit & loss statement in the window is composed of only a Total column.
Now take a look at Figure 2-10; it shows the same profit & loss statement,
except this time, the Columns box shows Customer:Job. In this case,
QuickBooks shows you a breakdown of your income and expenses by
Customer and Job, as well as the total. The Columns drop-down list box
gives you a bunch of different column options. Typically, some make sense
for the report that you’re working on; others won’t. Nevertheless, you should
occasionally experiment with this tool. The Columns box often gives you a
neat way to further segregate and refine your data.
Sort By box
The Sort By drop-down list box enables you to choose how information
should be ordered on a report. For many types of reports, the Sort By drop-
down list box doesn’t provide any meaningful options. For some types of
reports, however, the Sort By drop-down list box provides handy ways to
organize report information.

Modifying a Report
If you click the Modify Report button, QuickBooks displays the Modify Report
dialog box, which you can use to customize a report. When you customize a
report, you change the report’s appearance, layout, and the information that
it summarizes.
The Modify Report dialog box looks different for different report types.
Nevertheless, if you look past the cosmetic differences, the dialog boxes
pretty much all look and work the same way.
Using the Display tab
The Display tab of the Modify Report dialog box lets you control the report
interval date, the report basis, the columns, and some other formatting.
The Report Date Range boxes — Dates, From, and To — do the same thing as
the Dates, From, and To boxes on the Report window. These boxes let you
control the reporting interval or accounting period. You can choose one of
the date descriptions from the Dates box, or you can use the From and
To boxes to specify a particular range of dates. The From and To boxes,
as shown in Figure 2-11, accept dates in the mm/dd/yyyy format.

The Report Basis option buttons — accrual and cash — let you specify
whether you want QuickBooks to prepare a report on a cash basis or on an
accrual basis. Now, quite honestly, you can’t simply convert between cash-
basis accounting and accrual-basis accounting by clicking these buttons.
Cash-basis accounting and accrual-basis accounting are too complicated for
QuickBooks to figure out on its own. If you use accrual-basis accounting, for
example, you must use QuickBooks Accounts Payable feature and you must
recode revenue and expense transactions when you earn revenue and incur
expenses. Nevertheless, these Report Basis buttons enable you to quickly
flip between cash-centric profit statements and accrual-like financial state-
ments. And that’s pretty handy.
In a nutshell, cash-basis accounting counts income and expense when cash
moves into and out of a business. Accrual-basis accounting counts income
when it is earned and counts expense when it is incurred. Book I, Chapter 1
talks in more detail about accounting and the differences between cash-basis
accounting and accrual-basis accounting.
The Columns area enables you to control or specify how many columns a
report should display. The Display Columns By box is analogous to the
Columns box on the Report window. The Columns area also lets you choose
a Sort By option. Again, this is analogous to the Sort By drop-down list box
in the Report window.
In addition, the Columns area allows you to add subcolumns (you do this
with the Previous Period, Previous Year, and Year-to-Date check boxes) and
allows you to add percentages. The neat thing about these percentages is
that you are actually adding financial ratios to your financial statement when
you do this. I don’t talk about financial ratios in this chapter, but I do go into

great detail in Book V, Chapter 1 about what financial ratios are and about
how they can become powerful tools for assessing and monitoring your
financial condition and your financial performance.
To show each line item on an income statement as a percentage of total
income, select the % of Income check box.
For more report formatting options, click the Advanced button. QuickBooks
displays the Advanced Options dialog box, as shown in Figure 2-12. Use the
Display Rows radio buttons to tell QuickBooks when it should or shouldn’t
display rows of information in a report. Similarly, use the Display Columns
radio buttons to tell QuickBooks when it should or shouldn’t display columns
in a report. You can use the Reporting Calendar radio buttons to select the
default annual reporting period. The Default year can be a fiscal year (you
set this option when setting up QuickBooks), a calendar year, or an income
tax year. Click OK to activate these selections.
To revert to the Default Display settings, click the Revert button on the
Display tab.
Using the Filters tab
The Filters tab is probably the most interesting and useful tab provided by
the Modify Report dialog box. The Filters tab enables you to set up filters
that you can use to specify what information gets summarized in the report.
To use the Filters tab, shown in Figure 2-13, you first select the field on
which you want to base a filter from the Filter list box. For example, if you
want to filter information based on the account, select Account from the
Filter list box.
After you identify the piece of data on which you want to base your filter,
open the drop-down list box next to the filter. If you selected an account
filter, for example, QuickBooks names this drop-down list box the Account
box. When you open the drop-down list box, QuickBooks displays a set of fil-
tering choices. For example, Figure 2-14 shows common filtering choices avail-
able when you are creating an account filter: All Income/Expense Accounts,
All Ordinary Income/Expense, All Ordinary Income/COGS, and so forth. You
can pick a standard account filter from this list.
Figure 2-12:
The
Advanced
Options
dialog box.

283
Alternatively, you can pick, for example, the multiple accounts entry from
the drop-down list box. In this case, QuickBooks displays the Select Account
dialog box, as shown in Figure 2-15. This dialog box lets you select, on an
individual basis, which accounts you want to appear on the report. For exam-
ple, if you want to create a report based purely on a checking account, an
accounts receivable account, and an inventory asset account, you use the
Select Account box to select these accounts. To select the accounts that you
want, click them. QuickBooks identifies selected accounts with a check mark.

284
Other fields and boxes on the Filters tab are probably pretty self-explanatory.
The Include Split Detail option buttons, available for account-based filters,
let you tell QuickBooks whether it should include split transaction informa-
tion. The Current Filter Choices box identifies what report filters are used
for the report. You can remove a filter by selecting it from the Current Filter
Choices list and then clicking the Remove Selected Filter button. You can
also revert to the default filter by clicking the Revert button. Note that differ-
ent boxes appear on the Filters tab for different filters.
Using the Header/Footer tab
The Header/Footer tab, as shown in Figure 2-16, controls what header and
footer information appears on your report. You use the Show Header
Information boxes to control the report header. For example, if you want your
company name to appear at the top of the report, select the Company Name
check box. And if you want to change the company name that appears at the
top of the report, edit the contents of the company name text box. The other
Show Header Information boxes work in the same way. For example, to
remove the report title from the report, deselect the Report Title check box.
To use a different report title, edit the contents of the Report Title text box.

Use the Page Layout area — this provides a single Alignment drop-down list
box — to choose a layout for your report. By default, QuickBooks uses a
standard alignment. You can also choose a left alignment, right alignment, or
a centered alignment. QuickBooks shows you how the report layout changes
depending on the alignment selected.
As is the case with the other tabs of the Modify Report dialog box, you can
click the Revert button to change back to the default header/footer settings.
Formatting fonts and numbers
The Fonts & Numbers tab, as shown in Figure 2-17, lets you change the font
for selected pieces of report information. Use the Change Font For list box to
select the bit of report information that you want to change. After this selec-
tion, click the Change Font button to display a dialog box like the one shown
in Figure 2-18. The Column Labels dialog box appears, for example, when you
indicate that you want to change the font for column labels. Use the Font box
to select the font for the column labels. Use the Font Style box to select the
font style for the column labels. Use the Size box to select the point size for
the column labels. Optionally, use the Effects check boxes to add or remove
special effects. Or, get really crazy and use the Color box to select the color
for the piece of report data. When you’re finished, verify that your font for-
matting choices look right by using the Sample box — and then click OK.
When you click OK to close the dialog box used to change a font (refer to
Figure 2-18), QuickBooks displays a message box, asking if you want to
change all the related fonts. If you do want to change the fonts — and you
probably do — click Yes. Note that if you make some change that later turns
out to be wrong, you can click the Revert button, which also appears on
the Fonts & Numbers tab, to return to the default formatting for fonts and
numbers.
Figure 2-17:
The Fonts &
Numbers
tab of the
Modify
Report
dialog box.

Processing Multiple Reports
286
The Show Negative Numbers area provides radio buttons and a check box
that you can use to instruct QuickBooks to provide special formatting for
negative values. Typically, QuickBooks shows negative values with a minus
sign in front of the value. Alternatively, you can tell QuickBooks to place
parentheses around the negative values (select the In Parentheses radio
button) or to display them with a trailing minus sign (select the With a
Trailing Minus radio button). You can also use color to flag negative num-
bers (select the In Bright Red check box).
The Show All Numbers area provides three check boxes that you can use to
clean up and simplify your report. If your business is large enough that your
report values are very large, select the Divided By 1,000 check box. In that
case, QuickBooks divides all the report values by 1,000 to make them easier
to read. If you select the Except Zero Amounts check box, QuickBooks sim-
plifies your report by not showing zero values. Finally, if you select the
Without Cents check box, QuickBooks only shows dollars and not cents.
If you find yourself becoming overwhelmed with the amount of data being
presented in a report, the Show All Numbers check boxes provide a handy
way to get a somewhat clearer view of the big picture.
Processing Multiple Reports
If you choose the Reports➪Process Multiple Reports command, QuickBooks
displays the Process Multiple Reports dialog box, as shown in Figure 2-19.
This dialog box enables you to request a bunch of different previously mem-
orized reports at one time. To use the Process Multiple Reports dialog box,
first select a report group from the Select Memorized Reports From box.
Next, select the reports within the report group that you want and check
them off the list. If QuickBooks shows a report as selected (indicated with a
check mark) that you don’t want, click the check mark to remove it. Next, for
those reports that you have selected, verify that the From and To boxes
show the correct report interval.

A Few Words about Document Retention
287
After you’ve selected the reports and provided the report interval dates, you
can click the Display button to have QuickBooks display the report windows
for each of the reports that you’ve selected. Alternatively, you can click the
Print button to have QuickBooks print paper versions of each of the reports
that you selected.
A Few Words about Document Retention
People sometimes ask me how long they should keep old reports, copies of
invoices, and other bits of accounting information. Unfortunately, I don’t
really have a one-size-fits-all answer to this. However, I can give you some
things to think about.
✦Consider whether the other party to a transaction is ever going to
want the information. For example, if you are chronically arguing with a
vendor about whether you have paid some bill, it makes sense to hang
on to those vendor bills and any records of your payment for as long as
the argument may go on. This means that any paperwork that documents
vendor bills and payments doesn’t necessarily have to be retained if you
don’t have a problem.
✦Consider tax accounting requirements. By law (a lot of people don’t
realize this), a business is required to maintain accounting records in
order to report its profits, losses, income, and deductions to the Internal
Revenue Service. This means that anything that you need to calculate
your profits or substantiate elements of your calculations should be
maintained. However, a statute of limitations exists that typically runs
three years from the date you last filed the return. This means that, in
most cases, you don’t need to keep paperwork that’s any older than
three years past the return that it relates to. In other words, if you have
data from the year 2003 and you filed the year 2003 tax return on March
15, 2004, by March 16, 2007, you shouldn’t (in most cases) need to keep
Figure 2-19:
The Process
Multiple
Reports
dialog box.

A Few Words about Document Retention
288
all that old paperwork. The statute of limitations dictates that you should
be able to discard the old stuff. A word of caution is in order because a
couple of exceptions exist to this three-year statute of limitations:
• If you’ve been really sloppy and through your sloppiness omitted
gross income in excess of 25 percent of what your return shows, the
statute of limitations equals six years.
• If no return is filed or a fraudulent return is filed, no statute of limita-
tions exists.
✦Consider the old records that you may need in the future in order
to calculate an item for your tax return. These need to be retained.
For example, if you bought a factory 60 years ago, keep those purchase
records until after you sell the factory.
✦Consider that in some industries, other document retention rules or
regulations exist. For example, if you’re a physician, you keep your old
patient records — and this may include patient accounting information —
for longer than just three years. These other document retention rules
vary by industry. Find out what the rules are for your industry.
How do you make sense of these vague suggestions? Come up with a rough
guess as to how long you think you should hang on to stuff. In my business,
subject to the qualifications listed previously, I hang on to stuff for five years.
I’m not doing anything criminal or fraudulent or sloppy, so anything that is over
five years old I just toss. By the way, I’m also careful to segregate documents
I can throw out by year into boxes. I label the boxes with the year number. I
also label the boxes with the note “discard in 2007” just so I know I can toss
that stuff out.
You may want to think twice about simply tossing out financial records.
(I am a little anal about this because I am a CPA.) I actually don’t toss out
my personal records: I shred the documents first. You may want to do the
same thing.

udgets provide business owners and managers with powerful tools for
better managing a firm’s operation. A budget can give the business
owner or manager a way to more easily and more quantifiably manage the
people working for the business. A budget can often identify problems or
opportunities early. Finally, a budget truly gives the owner or manager a way
to plan out the year’s operation, think about what’s most important, and
quantify what the firm should achieve over the year.
For these reasons, this chapter discusses some practical, common-sense
approaches to budgeting within QuickBooks. I think you’ll be surprised that
this process is as straightforward as it is.
Reviewing Common Budgeting Tactics
Before I get into a detailed discussion of how you create a budget and use
that budget within QuickBooks, I want to briefly identify and describe three
very useful and common budgeting tactics: top-line budgeting, zero-based
budgeting, and benchmarking. None of these three tactics is complicated.
You probably know of and understand at least two of them already. You should
consider all these tactics, however, as you construct formal or informal
budgets for your business.
Top-line budgeting
A top-line budget is the simplest budget technique available. A top-line
budget takes last year’s numbers or last month’s numbers and uses them
for this year’s budget. Of course, if inflation has occurred, a top-line budget
may inflate last year’s or last month’s numbers by using an inflation factor.
Or, conversely, if the business has shrunk a bit or fallen on hard times, the
previous year’s or month’s numbers may be decreased by some amount.

Reviewing Common Budgeting Tactics
290
Although top-line budgeting often receives a bad rap from people who don’t
like the way it perpetuates the past, top-line budgeting has at least a couple
of arguments in its favor.
✦Top-line budgeting is easy. This is something big in its favor. Other
budgeting techniques are often much more work.
✦Top-line budgeting is based on reality. The numbers from last year or
last month are real. This fact is a unique benefit to top-line budgeting
that other budgeting tactics (which I describe in the following para-
graphs) don’t offer. If you know, for example, that last month you spent
$2,000 on rent, the reality of that true, actual number is a very useful
starting point for thinking about what you will spend this month.
Top-line budgeting, however, possesses a well-known weakness. Top-line
budgeting tends to perpetuate previous bad budgeting decisions. For exam-
ple, if someone long ago decided to spend $10,000 on an advertisement on
some special industry magazine, top-line budgeting may continue to budget
that $10,000 annual expense even though it no longer makes sense or never
made sense.
Zero-based budgeting
Zero-based budgeting is the opposite of top-line budgeting. A zero-based
budget works from the bottom up. A zero-based budget starts with individual
revenue, expense, asset, liability, and owner’s equity accounts. It examines a
specific account — postage expense, for example — and then tries to apply
common sense and logic for coming up with a good postage expense budget
amount. For example, the budgeter may guess that the firm will send out
1,000 letters over the year and that the average postage per letter will equal
$0.50. In this case, the zero-based budgeting approach determines that postage
expense for the coming year will probably equal $500. The zero-based budg-
eter calculates this amount by taking 1,000 letters and multiplying this
amount by $0.50 postage cost per letter.
The advantage of zero-based budgeting is that it tends to fix poorly figured,
previously budgeted amounts. It doesn’t simply perpetuate bad budgeting
decisions of the past. New budgeted amounts are based on the application of
common sense and simple arithmetic; the combination of these two items
often produces pretty good numbers. That’s really cool.
Another neat feature of zero-based budgeting is that it makes people who
benefit from or use some budgeted amount responsible for that budgeted
amount. For example, if some manager spent $50,000 on travel expense last
year, top-line budgeting states that he or she gets to spend $50,000 this year.
Zero-line budgeting, in contrast, makes the manager prove through the appli-
cation of common sense and simple arithmetic that $50,000 of travel expense
is reasonable for this year.

Book IV
Chapter 3
Preparing a Budget
Reviewing Common Budgeting Tactics
291
However, zero-based budgeting isn’t perfect; it possesses a weakness in
that it’s easy for budgeters to forget numbers or make calculation errors.
Previously, I used the example of a budgeter guessing that postage expense
for the coming year will be $500. That estimate comes from a guess about
the number of letters sent for a year (1,000) and an estimate of the average
postage expense spent on each letter ($0.50). If either of those numbers is
wrong, or if (heaven forbid) the budgeter incorrectly multiplies the one
number by the other, the postage expense budget number is wrong. If the
budgeter is budgeting hundreds or even thousands of budgeted amounts,
he or she will undoubtedly make a few errors in the process. And he or she
probably won’t be able to fix or find those errors because of the volume of
budgeted amounts.
Benchmarking
One very powerful but unfortunately infrequently used technique is 
benchmarking. Benchmarking compares your actual or your preliminary budg-
eted numbers to the same numbers of similarly sized businesses in your
industry. For example, CPA firms spend money on a tax library. Annual fees for
a tax library can run from as little as $100 or $200 a year to roughly $30,000 a
year (these amounts are fees for a sole proprietor, by the way). How do you
know what number is an appropriate budgeted amount? Well, if you know
what other CPA firms or other sole proprietor CPAs are spending on their tax
libraries, that information can probably help you to budget what you should
or can spend. The challenge, of course, is getting that comparable information.
Fortunately, getting comparable information is easier than most people real-
ize. You can usually get information about the financial statistics of compara-
ble firms in two different ways:
✦Your local library: You can usually find several good sources of general
financial statistical information about businesses of varying sizes and in
varying industries. For example, Dun & Bradstreet, the Risk Management
Association, Robert Morris & Associates, and a fellow named Troy all
publish annual summaries of financial ratios and financial statistics
based on several sources. If you trot down to the library and visit the
reference desk, you can get the librarian’s help in locating one or more
of these reference sources. Suddenly, you have a wealth of information
at your fingertips. You can see how much the average tavern spends on
beer and peanuts, for example. You can see how much the average
restaurant spends on advertising. In other words, you can see detailed
financial information on a business exactly like yours!
✦Industry associations: In addition to the general information available from
reference sources commonly stocked at your local library, many industry
associations and professional groups collect and publish industry-specific
financial information. For example, one of the first jobs I had early in my
career was working as the controller of an electronics manufacturing

Practical Approaches to Budgeting
292
firm. Our firm was a member of the American Electronics Association.
That membership meant that we participated in a survey of financial
information of member firms in the association. That survey gave us
(and other AEA members) good statistics about average salaries spent
for different positions, inventory investment, certain administrative
expenses, and so forth. Continuing with my example of CPAs buying tax
libraries, I should mention that two industry associations — the Texas
Society of Certified Public Accountants and the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants — publish statistics for CPA firms. These
publications identify what the average sole proprietor spends on his or
her tax library. I’ll bet you a dill pickle that your industry association —
whatever it is — has similar information available.
Putting it all together
Just for the record — you probably already guessed this — you shouldn’t
use just one approach to build your budget. You may use top-line budgeting
for some of your numbers, and you may use zero-based budgeting for other
numbers. And for really important or key numbers in your budget, you may
take the time and effort to benchmark your numbers against those of simi-
larly sized firms in your industry. Good budgeting, then, combines the budg-
eting tactics described in this chapter to come up with a budget that makes
sense and lets you plan your firm’s finances for the year.
Practical Approaches to Budgeting
Business budgeting, unfortunately, isn’t simply a matter of listing expected
revenue and expense amounts. You also typically create a balance sheet.
Balance sheet budgeting is too complicated to do on the back of a napkin
or sitting at the breakfast table in the morning before the kids get up.
Therefore, to create budgeted numbers for a balance sheet, you use a tool and
an approach like the one described (in some detail) in Book VI, Chapter 2.
If all that you want to budget are revenue amounts and expense amounts,
you can do that in a very simple, crude fashion. For example, you can just
list expected revenue amounts by account on the back of a cocktail napkin.
Using the Set Up Budgets Window
After you’ve come up with a budget — presumably by using a tool like the
one described in Book VI, Chapter 2, and by employing the sorts of budget-
ing tactics described previously in this chapter — you record your budget in
QuickBooks.

Creating a new budget
To create a new budget in QuickBooks, follow these steps:
1. Choose the Company➪Planning and Budgeting➪Set Up Budgets 
command.
QuickBooks displays the Create New Budget window, shown in Figure 3-1.
You use this window to record the amount that you expect for each rev-
enue and expense account for each month during the year in which you
are budgeting.
2. Click the Create New Budget button to create a new budget.
This opens the Create New Budget dialog box, which you use to create a
new budget (bet you wouldn’t have guessed that).
3. Select the fiscal year period.
Identify the fiscal year you’re budgeting for. To do that, enter the fiscal
year in the provided text box, as shown in Figure 3-1. If you are budget-
ing for fiscal year 2007, for example, you use those buttons to change
the year to 2007.
4. Select the Profit and Loss radio button or the Balance Sheet radio
button, depending on what type of budget you want to create.
If you’re creating a profit and loss budget, click Next. If you’re creating a
balance sheet budget, click Finish to complete the budget.
Note that you use a different approach for profit and loss budgets and
balance sheet budgets. For profit and loss budgets, you budget the
amount of revenue or expense expected for the account for the month.
For balance sheet budgets, you budget the ending account balance —
that’s the ending account balance expected for the asset, liability, or
owner’s equity account at month’s end.

New Budget
window.

5. Specify additional profit and loss budget criteria and click Next.
If you chose to create a profit and loss budget, select the Customer:Job
radio button to further extend your budget to include Job details, or
select the Class radio button to include classes in your budget (see
Figure 3-2). Or simply select the No Additional Criteria radio button.
6. Choose whether to create the budget from scratch or previous data.
To create a budget from scratch and start with a clean slate, select the
Create Budget from Scratch radio button, shown in Figure 3-3. To create
a budget based on your actual data from last year, select the Create
Budget from Previous Year’s Actual Data radio button. Click Finish
when you’re done. QuickBooks displays the Set Up Budgets window
(see Figure 3-4).

Working with an existing budget
To edit an existing budget in QuickBooks, follow these steps:
1. Choose the Company➪Planning & Budgeting➪Set Up Budgets 
command.
QuickBooks displays the Set Up Budgets window — the same one shown
in Figure 3-4. You use this window to record the amount that you expect
for each revenue and expense for each month during the year in which
you are budgeting.
2. Select a budget or create a new one.
Select the budget you want to work with from the Budget box at the top
of the window. To create a new budget (you can have as many budgets
as you want), click the Create New Budget button. For help with creating
a new budget, see the previous section.
Figure 3-4:
The Set Up
Budgets
window.

Using the Set Up Budgets Window
296
3. (Optional) Choose a Customer.
You typically budget by account. However, if you want to budget in finer
detail by also estimating amounts for customers, jobs, or classes, you can
use the Current Customer:Job drop-down list box to identify specific cus-
tomers from which you expect revenue or for whom you expend costs.
4. Record the budgeted amounts for each month of the fiscal year.
Type the amounts you want to budget for each account in the appr
opriate month columns. Again, remember that revenue and expense
accounts are budgeted as the amount expected for the month. Asset, lia-
bility, and owner’s equity amounts are budgeted as the ending account
balance expected for the month.
To copy the budgeted amount for one month into the text boxes for the
succeeding months, click the Copy Across button.
5. (Optional) Adjust row amounts.
If you find that the yearly total for an account isn’t what you want it to be,
you can go back and change the amounts for each month so that they
add up to the correct total. Or, you can click the Adjust Row Amounts
button. Clicking this button displays the Adjust Row Amounts dialog
box, shown in Figure 3-5. Use the Start At drop-down list box to select
which month you want to start with (either the first month or the cur-
rently selected month), and then choose whether you want to increase
or decrease the amounts budgeted, and by how much (enter either a
dollar amount or a percentage).
6. Repeat as necessary.
Repeat Steps 3 through 5 for each of the accounts for which you want to
record budgeted amounts.
Yes, I know, this is a lot of work. Just so you know, in large companies with
hundreds of employees, two or three people spend their entire year working
with the budgeted data.

Managing with a Budget
After you record your budget in QuickBooks (as described in the earlier sec-
tion “Using the Set Up Budgets Window”), you can compare your actual
financial results to budgeted amounts by choosing commands from the
Budget submenu that QuickBooks displays. When you choose the Reports➪
Budget command, QuickBooks provides several budgeting reports, described
in the following list:
✦Budget Overview: This report summarizes your budgeted amounts.
You can use it to look at and error-check your budget.
✦Budget vs. Actual: This report lets you compare budgeted income state-
ment information to actual income statement information. The report,
therefore, lets you compare your expected revenue and expenses to the
actual revenue and expenses.
✦Budget by Job Overview: This report lets you look at your budget by
job. You can use this to compare and review your job budgets.
✦Budget vs. Actual by Job: This report lets you look at expected and
actual revenue and expense amounts by job.
✦Budget vs. Actual Graph: This graph isn’t a report. It’s a chart that
shows budgeted and actual information.
✦Balance Sheet Budget Overview: This report shows budgeted amounts
for balance sheet accounts: assets, liabilities, and owner’s equity accounts.
✦Balance Sheet Budget vs. Actual: This report shows expected and
actual account balances for assets, liabilities, and owner’s equity.
The way that you use a budgeting report’s information is key — and it’s
also the secret to getting value from your budgeting efforts. With a well-
constructed, common-sense budget, you can look for variances between
your budget and your actual financial results. You want to use your budget
to spot situations in which, for example, an expense item is too low, an asset
item is too high, or some revenue number is trailing behind what you expect.
Variances between expected results and actual results indicate unexpected
results. Unexpected results often suggest either problems . . . or opportuni-
ties. Think about the following examples of variance and what the variances
may indicate:
✦Monthly revenue is $40,000 instead of $50,000. Monthly revenue that’s
20 percent less than expected may indicate problems with your product,
problems with your sales force, or problems with your customers. In any
case, if sales represent only 80 percent of what you expect, you probably
need to implement immediate corrective action.

✦Inventory balances are averaging $50,000 at month’s end rather than
$100,000 at month’s end. Having a lower-than-expected inventory bal-
ance may be either good or bad. The ending inventory balance that is
half of what you expect may indicate that you are selling products
much faster than you expected (and, therefore, you should increase
your inventory investment and purchasing of inventory). Having a low
inventory investment may also mean, however, that you’re simply not
getting materials from your vendors as fast as you need them and, as a
result, you’re at great risk of losing sales because of inadequate stock
levels.
✦Research and development expenses equal $50,000 a year instead of
$25,000 a year. Research and development expenses that are twice what
you expect seem bad. How can it be good to spend twice as much on an
expense as you expect? However, doubling your research and develop-
ment expenditures may be good if you are unexpectedly investing in
some promising new product, idea, or technology.
✦Sales to a particular class of customer are 50 percent higher. Suppose
that you used classes to track sales to customers inside the country and
outside the country. If you see that, quite unexpectedly, sales to customers
outside the country are 50 percent above what you expect, that variance
may indicate an opportunity to sell even more outside the country.
Maybe with more effort and energy, outside-the-country customers
can become an even larger part of your business. Sometimes variances
identify opportunities that you would otherwise miss.
Some Wrap-Up Comments on Budgeting
Before I leave the subject of budgeting, however, I want to share a handful of
final comments:
✦Budgeting is an example of the old phrase, “Plan your work, and
then work your plan.” Budgets are not handcuffs. Budgets are not
straitjackets. Budgets are simply planning tools that you use to 
thoughtfully make decisions about your firm’s financial affairs for the
coming year.
✦If you aren’t getting value from the budgeting process, you shouldn’t
do it. Or, at the very least, change the way you’re doing it. No kidding,
I won’t argue that you should budget if you don’t get value from the
process. I think, however, that most businesses do get value. If you can
manage your business without a budget — and I mention an approach
that works for doing this in a tip at the end of this chapter — I don’t
think you should budget. You use those tools that deliver the most value
to you in managing your firm. For many people, budgeting does just that.
If it doesn’t for you, skip the work. Time is often the scarcest resource
for business owners and managers.

Chapter 3
Preparing a Budget
Some Wrap-Up Comments on Budgeting

✦Budgets can be essential tools for managing people with financially
quantifiable responsibilities. Okay, I know budgets have a bad rap and
they aren’t perfect, but you know what? If you have people working for
you who have responsibilities that you can financially quantify, you can
use a budget to manage those people. For example, suppose that you
have sales people who should individually sell $25,000 worth of stuff
each month. If you budget by sales person (you probably need to set up
a class for each sales person or a revenue account for each sales
person), you can use a budget to compare actual sales generated by
each person to the budgeted sales expected for him or her. If you look at
Joe every month and see that he has $30,000 in sales predictably, you
can use that information in your management of Joe. Probably, Joe’s
overproducing means he’s doing a good job. If you look at Joe’s brother
Bob and see that he is doing $20,000 in sales every month when you
expect him to do $25,000 in sales, you can probably see a problem and
an opportunity for improvement. This all makes sense, right?
✦People who like to budget tend to (in my experience) focus on unfa-
vorable variances. I mention this because, although unfavorable vari-
ances often identify problems that need to be corrected, sometimes
favorable variances are more interesting and more useful to dissect.
Suppose that you have a business in which you expect sales people to
generate $25,000 in sales a month. If Julia is generating $75,000 a month
in sales, that’s pretty darn interesting. Probably, Julia knows something
or has skills or an approach that the other sales people don’t have.
Perhaps, with just a little bit of luck, you can figure out why Julia does so
well — and then use this new knowledge to get your other sales people
to sell more stuff each month.
✦The key budgeting numbers to watch are often a pretty small set.
Although a budget according to QuickBooks (and, I guess, Steve Nelson)
may have hundreds of numbers, you may be able to manage your business
just fine by looking at just a handful of numbers. For example, maybe in
your business it all gets down to sales. If sales really drive everything
else — your expenses and, of course, all your profit — you may not have
much reason to track the amount that you’re spending each month on
your telephone bill or postage expense. If you can distill your financial
plan down to a few numbers that you need to watch, you can make your
budgeting and your financial analyses much simpler. All you do is identify
the key financial statistics to watch — and then regularly watch them.
Financial ratios are often very useful tools for monitoring a firm’s financial
performance. I know several business owners who successfully manage their
businesses without a formal budget by looking at two or three items, includ-
ing cost of goods sold and gross margin percentages. The cost of goods sold
includes the cost of the products or items being sold. A gross margin percentage
is the percentage of sales that are left over after paying for the cost of goods
sold. To dig into these terms and find out about working with financial ratios,
refer to Book V, Chapter 1.

A
ctivity-based costing (or, ABC for short) may be the best new account-
ing idea in the last two decades. No, I must amend that. Activity-based
costing is the best new idea in accounting in the last two decades.
ABC gives businesses a better way to estimate the profits of products and
services, which is more important than you may think. The problem in
many businesses is that overhead expenses or operating expenses don’t
cleanly tie to products or services. Without good allocation of overhead or
operating expenses, businesses can’t accurately determine which products
make money and which don’t.
ABC addresses this problem by using the power of the computer
(QuickBooks in this example) to directly trace overhead costs to products
and services. Surprisingly, ABC accomplishes this task in a pretty straight-
forward, simple fashion. In this chapter, I show you what I mean.
Revealing Traditional Overhead Allocation
To really understand the contribution that ABC makes, you need to under-
stand how overhead allocation traditionally works. To give you an example,
take a look at Table 4-1. This is the same simple income statement that I
show in several chapters throughout the book.

As you may recall, this simple income statement shows the profit for an
imaginary hot dog stand business that you operate on opening day of 
baseball season in your city.
Suppose that in this imaginary business, you sell two different products: a
regular hot dog for $2.50, and a super-duper chilidog for $4.00. Suppose also
that you sell an even number of both of these products. Therefore, the
$13,000 of revenue shown in Table 4-1 actually represents $5,000 in sales of
regular hot dogs and $8,000 in sales of chilidogs.
Further suppose that you can break down the cost of goods sold as follows:
✦Buns: Each bun cost you $0.15. This means that you spent $300 on buns
for regular dogs and $300 on buns for the chilidogs.
✦Dogs: Each hot dog cost you $0.40. This means that you spent $800 on
hot dogs for the regular hot dog product line and another $800 on hot
dogs for the chilidog product line.
✦Chili: Each serving of chili for the chilidogs costs you $0.40 (a serving is
three heaping tablespoons of chili, as you enjoy telling customers). This
means that you spent another $800 on chili for the chilidog product line.
Given this information, you can create an income statement that shows 
revenues, cost of goods sold, and gross margin by product line, as shown in
Table 4-2. Furthermore, note that Table 4-2 does something very traditional —
it allocates operating expenses using a simple rule. In Table 4-2, I’ve simply
split the operating expenses right down the middle — allocating $3,000 of
operating expenses to the regular hot dog product line and $3,000 of operat-
ing expenses to the chilidog product line.

Stop for a minute and look at the information shown in Table 4-2. When you
consider and make decisions based on this information, it becomes much
easier to understand traditional overhead allocations.
If you examine the income statement shown in Table 4-2, several pieces of
data suggest that there’s money in them there chilidogs. For example, look at
the sales revenue. The income statement shows that chilidogs generate
$8,000 of sales revenue, whereas regular hot dogs only generate $5,000 of
sales revenue. Now look at the gross margin. The income statement shows
that chilidogs generate $6,100 of gross margin, whereas regular hot dogs gen-
erate only $3,900 of gross margin. Finally, look at the net profit. Based on a
simple split of overhead or operating expenses, the net profit from the regu-
lar hot dog line equals a measly $900 while the net profit from the chilidog
product line equals a whopping $3,100.
After reviewing the information shown in Table 4-2, what is your conclusion?
It seems pretty clear that you should sell more chilidogs and fewer hot dogs.
In fact, you may want to give up on selling regular hot dogs and concentrate
on chilidogs. You may also decide that your chilidogs are priced too high —
perhaps you could shave the cost a bit on these. You may also decide that
the regular hot dogs are priced too low — perhaps the price on these should
be bumped up a bit.

How ABC Works
304
Indeed, you can make all sorts of decisions from the collective set of data
shown in Table 4-2. You may not realize that the overhead allocation plays an
important part in all this. Unfortunately, the overhead allocation shown in
Table 4-2 and any of the conclusions I’ve suggested in the preceding para-
graphs are wrong. This error, however, doesn’t show up until you use activity-
based costing, and that’s why ABC is cool.
How ABC Works
In this section, I tell you how, with ABC, you can create an equivalent income
statement for product line profitability. After that, I generalize about the
ABC process and define the ABC buzzwords that people usually use to talk
about ABC.
The ABC product line income statement
To create an ABC product line income statement, you attempt to trace the
overhead cost directly to products or services. For example, suppose that in
the case of the imaginary hot dog stand business, the rent expense is neces-
sary because you need an electrical hookup to keep the pot of chili heated.
Perhaps you also need an electrical hookup to run the can opener that
you use (surreptitiously) to open the cans of chili needed to refill the pot.
This means, then, that the rent expense really can’t be split between regular
hot dogs and chilidogs. It needs to be allocated to chilidogs.
You can treat the supplies expense in a very similar way. For example, sup-
pose that the $1,000 of supplies is really just napkins. Suppose also that,
based on your observations, a regular hot dog customer grabs two napkins
for his hot dog, whereas a chilidog customer grabs eight napkins for his
chilidog. (You know, to clean up the mess on the front of his shirt when the
chili spills.) In this case, you can use this information to better allocate the
$1,000 of supplies expense. Consider that this information means that regular
hot dog customers use roughly 4,000 napkins. (I calculated this by multiply-
ing the 2,000 hot dogs you’ve sold by the two napkins used for each regular
hot dog customer.) And chilidog customers use 16,000 napkins. (I calculated
this by multiplying the 2,000 chilidogs that you’ve sold by the eight napkins
used by each chilidog customer.)
Using this napkin usage information, you can calculate which percentage
of the supplies expense is used by regular hot dog customers and chilidog
customers. If regular hot dog customers use 4,000 out of a total of 20,000
napkins, 20 percent of the napkins are going to regular hot dog customers
(20 percent of the $1,000 of supplies expense equals $200). Therefore, the
correct allocation of supplies expense to the regular hot dog line is $200.

Book IV
Chapter 4
Using Activity-
Based Costing
How ABC Works
305
You can allocate a portion of the supplies expense for chilidogs by using 
similar math. If 16,000 of the 20,000 napkins go to chilidog customers, that’s
80 percent of the napkins (80 percent of the $1,000 of supplies expense
equals $800). Therefore, logically, $800 out of $1,000 of supplies expense
should be allocated, or traced, to the chilidog product line.
This all makes sense, right? All you are trying to do is trace overhead costs,
or operating expenses, to product lines.
The wages expense of $4,000 probably works in a very similar fashion.
Before going further, though, I have to delve into some of the ABC buzzwords.
Suppose that all the $4,000 of wages expense goes to serving customers hot
dogs. Furthermore, suppose that the process of serving a regular hot dog to
a customer requires two steps:
1. Grab hot dog bun.
2. Place a hot-off-the-grill frankfurter into the bun.
In comparison, the process of serving a chilidog requires five steps:
1. Grab a hot dog bun.
2. Slide a hot-off-the-grill frankfurter into the bun.
3. Ladle a heaping tablespoon of chili into the bun.
4. Ladle another heaping tablespoon of chili into the bun.
5. Ladle a third heaping tablespoon of chili into the bun (yes, you read that
correctly).
You may see where I’m going with this. I’ve actually done something very
special — something that business school professors would dress up with a
bunch of fancy words in academic business journals. In this example, I’ve
stated that the wages expense actually gets used in an activity called serving
or serving customers. I also noted in this example that the process of serving
a regular hot dog customer requires two steps, but the process of serving a
chilidog customer actually requires five steps.
These steps are known as cost drivers. That sounds like something you may
not understand right away, but, in fact, the notion of cost drivers is simple
common sense. The term cost drivers simply suggests that the number of
steps an employee takes to serve a customer is a good base on which to 
allocate the wages expense that comprises the activity of serving.
You may have already guessed how to do this, but I’ll tell you anyway. By look-
ing at the total number of steps required to serve regular hot dogs and the
total number of steps required to serve chilidogs, you can trace the wages
expense to the regular hot dog and chilidog product lines.

How ABC Works
306
For example, if you sell 2,000 regular hot dogs and each hot dog requires two
steps, regular hot dogs require 4,000 steps in total. If you sell 2,000 chilidogs
and each chilidog requires five steps, the chilidog product line requires
10,000 steps.
You can use these two values — the number of steps for the regular hot dog
line and the number of steps for the chilidog line — to allocate the wages
expense. For example, to calculate the percentage of the wages expense that
goes into preparing regular hot dogs, you make the following calculation:
4,000 (the number of steps required for regular hot dogs) / 14,000
(the total number of steps) × $4,000
This calculation returns the value $1,143.00.
In a similar fashion, you can use the steps information to allocate wages
expense to the chilidog product line. Here’s how that calculation may work:
10,000 (the number of steps to prepare chilidogs) / 14,000 (the total steps)
× $4,000
This calculation returns the value $2,857.00.
Now take a look at Table 4-3, which summarizes all this ABC analysis that I
have discussed over the past few paragraphs. The most noteworthy item —
and the first item to observe about ABC analysis — is that an ABC approach
to product-line profitability often produces surprising results.

307
If you think back to the impressions you had after looking at the income
statement shown in Table 4-2, you may have concluded that chilidogs are
really a much better product to sell. However, as Table 4-3 shows when you
look at the net profit number, regular hot dogs make twice as much profit as
chilidogs — even though they sell for less money and even though they pro-
duce much less gross margin. Only a fair and accurate tracing of overhead
expenses shows this fact. Wow. Pass the mustard.
This is all pretty neat, isn’t it? If you step away from your imaginary hot dog
stand business and look at your real business, you may find yourself asking
new and awkward questions, such as “That product generates all that revenue?
Maybe a fair accounting of overhead would show it actually loses money . . . ”
Remember that cheapo product or cheapo service that you never spend
much money on — you know the one — and that doesn’t generate much
gross margin? Well, you may be making a lot more money on it than you
thought. Scary, isn’t it?
ABC in a small firm
I want to make three important observations about ABC in a small firm.
Some of this stuff is obvious, and some of it is redundant. However, I think
it’s important enough that you hear it at least one more time:
✦ABC is most useful when you have lots of overhead and a bunch of dif-
ferent products. In any environment that doesn’t have a lot of overhead,
ABC isn’t worth the work and won’t deliver insights. Likewise, ABC doesn’t
make sense in any business that sells a single product or that provides a
single service, which is usually the case in a small firm. (Keep reading,
though, because analysis of cost drivers can provide one unique insight.)
✦ABC may not make sense for custom manufacturing environments. In
a custom manufacturing environment — this is any business where you
make specific things for specific customers — you can often use job
costing to provide good product or service profitability measures. For
example, in the case of a single-family home builder, the builder can use
job costing to track revenues and expenses by job (single family home).
And that job costing may provide the detailed profitability-by-product-
line information that is the big benefit of ABC. Remember, ABC is first
and foremost a tool for better allocating overhead costs.
✦Cost drivers “drive” costs. For example, in the discussion of the hot dog
stand business and the activity labeled serving a customer, the serving
steps were the cost drivers. The number of steps required to serve a cus-
tomer drove the costs of serving the customer. That may sound really
dumb, but sometimes one of the benefits that ABC provides is an insight
into how changing the number of cost drivers changes your costs. For
example, suppose that instead of spooning three heaping tablespoons of
chili onto a chilidog, you purchase one spoon equivalent to three table-
spoons; this would change the number of steps from five to three. Recall
the original, five-step approach to serving the chilidog customer:

Implementing a Simple ABC System
308
1. Grab a hot dog bun.
2. Slide a hot-off-the-grill frankfurter into the bun.
3. Ladle a heaping tablespoon of chili into the bun.
4. Ladle another heaping tablespoon of chili into the bun.
5. Ladle a third heaping tablespoon of chili into the bun.
This sounds so obvious as to not being worthy of inclusion in this book.
However, if you get a three-tablespoon spoon, you can simplify the serv-
ing of a chilidog into three steps:
1. Grab a bun.
2. Slide a hot dog into the bun.
3. Heap a three-tablespoon serving of chili on the hot dog.
Changing the number of steps required to serve a customer a chilidog
changes the cost of the serving activity for a chilidog. And changing
the cost of serving a chilidog changes the profitability (potentially) of
serving a chilidog. I say “potentially” because you may not actually be
able to reduce your wages expense by buying a three-tablespoon spoon
for lathering up your chilidogs with chili, but you get the idea. Note:
To really save money by reducing the number of steps, you need to be
able to cut your wages expense.
The bottom line concerning ABC is this: ABC lets you better allocate over-
head costs and, as an added bonus, ABC also often gives you unique insights
into what “drives” your overhead costs. With this information in hand, you
can make better decisions about your product and service lines, and some-
times you can even change your business operations in a way that reduces
your costs.
Implementing a Simple ABC System
I’ll admit this right up front: You can make ABC very complicated. Furthermore,
if you go out and hire an outside consultant — somebody who wants to charge
you thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars to set up one of these
systems — you may end up with something that is very, very powerful —
and very, very complicated.
That being said, however, ABC systems don’t have to be that complicated,
particularly if you just want better allocation of your overhead costs rather
than a system to look at the cost drivers or the activities that comprise your
overhead costs. ABC can be pretty straightforward. This is especially true in
a small- or medium-sized firm. In fact, I think you can probably implement a
good, first-rate ABC system by taking the following four steps:

Book IV
Chapter 4
Using Activity-
Based Costing
Implementing a Simple ABC System
309
1. Look at your overhead costs.
Verify that you have enough overhead to be worrying about. If you are in
a business with big fat margins and very low overhead, ABC may not
make any sense for you. The incremental value that you achieve by
more precisely allocating overhead may be simply a manifestation of an
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder rather than good accounting.
2. Identify the big overhead cost.
You must do this if you decide that you want to allocate some or a
bunch of your overhead via an ABC approach. Don’t spend time trying
to accurately allocate some penny-ante amounts (unless they are simple-
to-allocate ones that can be done at the same time as the bigger project).
Go for the biggest bang you can get for your buck. Create an ABC system
that allocates, with a minimal amount of effort, a large chunk of your
overhead. Don’t get too pedantic.
3. Identify the principal activities that use up the overhead costs.
In the simple example of the imaginary hot dog stand business, you had
only a single activity — serving a customer. You are certainly going to
have more activities than that. However, you don’t need to create a list
of 80 activities. Identify the big activities that enable you to allocate your
overhead. The fewer the activities you can use to do this, the easier your
accounting will be. Find a handful of activities that let you fairly and
accurately allocate overhead to produce lines. That’s the big picture.
4. Trace the activities to products by using the appropriate measures.
After you’ve identified the handful of activities that let you connect over-
head expenses to products, be sure to use the appropriate measure — also
known as a cost driver — to tie the overhead expenses to the product
lines or service lines. In the example of the hot dog stand business, one
overhead cost — rent — didn’t even need a cost driver. The supplies
expense also didn’t need a cost driver because you were able to allocate
that cost through simple observation. The wages expense required a
more sophisticated textbook approach to allocation. To allocate the
wages expense, you created an activity called serving the customer, and
then allocated that activity’s cost based on the number of steps that
each product line required.
An ABC system is a tool that you can use to manage your overhead costs
and the profitability of the products or services that you sell. Practically, you
want to focus on the big overhead costs, and, in the end, all you really want
is an ABC system that produces useful numbers — numbers that help you
more clearly and creatively think about your business.

How QuickBooks Supports ABC

How QuickBooks Supports ABC
Okay, you are probably saying to yourself, “Steve, this all sounds pretty
good. But you’re a little short on specifics and a little long on theory.
Where’s the beef, buddy?”
Oh, that’s right. I do need to tell you how an ABC system works in QuickBooks,
don’t I? No problem, the approach is actually really straightforward if you’ve
already been using QuickBooks. In short, all you do to implement a simple
ABC system in QuickBooks is to do what you are doing right now. In other
words, just keep on tracking your operating expenses by using a good,
decent chart of accounts. That’s 90 percent of the battle.
You also need to take care of just one or two minor additional items. First, you
turn on the QuickBooks Class Tracking feature. Class Tracking lets you cate-
gorize income and expense transactions as falling not just into income and
expense accounts — but also as falling into particular classes.
Second, when you record an expense, you also identify the class into which
the expense falls. By using classes that correspond to your activities — well,
you can see that’s all it takes, right?
Turning On Class Tracking
To turn on Class Tracking in QuickBooks, follow these steps:
1. Choose the Edit menu’s Preferences command.
QuickBooks displays the Preferences dialog box.
2. Tell QuickBooks you want to work with the accounting preferences.
To tell QuickBooks that you want to change one of its accounting 
preferences — Class Tracking, in this case — click the Accounting icon,
which appears in the list box along the left edge of the Preferences
dialog box. Figure 4-1 shows the Company Preferences tab for the
accounting preferences. (If the Company Preferences tab doesn’t appear
on your screen, simply click the tab.)
3. Select the Use Class Tracking check box to turn on Class Tracking.
You may as well also select the Prompt to Assign Classes box so
QuickBooks reminds you to use the classes.
4. Click OK.
From this point forward, QuickBooks adds a Class drop-down list box to
the Windows dialog box that you use to record revenues and expenses
(such as the Create Invoices window, the Write Checks window, the
Enter Bills window, and so on). All you do is tag transactions as they fit
into a particular class.

Book IV
Chapter 4
Using Activity-
Based Costing
Using Classes for ABC
311
Using Classes for ABC
After you turn on Class Tracking, using classes is really straightforward. You
set up classes for the product lines or service lines for which you want to
measure profitability. You classify transactions as fitting into a particular
class either as they’re recorded (if you can) or after the fact (if you need to
fiddle with the activity and cost driver math).
Setting up your classes
You set up a class for each product or service for which you want to meas-
ure profitability. In the imaginary hot dog stand business, for example, you
set up two classes: one for regular hot dogs and one for chilidogs.
To set up a class, you can just enter the class name into the class box that
appears on the window that you use to record invoices, write checks, and
make journal entries (these windows are shown later in this section).
Alternatively, you can choose the Lists menu’s Class List command. When
QuickBooks displays the Class List window, click the Class button shown at
the bottom of the window and choose New from the menu that QuickBooks
displays. Use the New Class window that appears, as shown in Figure 4-2, to
describe the new class.
Classifying revenue amounts
To classify revenue as fitting into a particular class, use the Class box that
appears on the Create Invoice window and on the Enter Sales Receipt window.
(These are the two windows that you use to record sales.) If an invoice
records sales of a hot dog, for example, you may record the class as Regular.
If a sales receipt records sales of a chilidog, you may record the class as
Chilidog. Figure 4-3 shows the Create Invoices window filled out to record
the day’s regular hot dog sales.

The Class box is in the upper-left corner of the window close to the
Customer:Job box.
Classifying expense amounts
To record a check that pays some expense that fits into a particular activity,
you also use the Class column — this appears on the Expenses tab as shown
in Figure 4-4 — to identify the product line or service into which the expense
fits. Figure 4-4 shows how the Write Checks window may appear to record
$1,000 of rent expense allocated to the chilidog product line.
The Class column is located along the right edge of the Expense tab.
After-the-fact classifications
In some cases, you won’t be able to classify an expense or revenue amount
at the time the initial transaction is recorded. For example, in the hot dog
stand example, you probably won’t be able to figure out how to split the
wages expense between regular hot dogs and chilidogs until after you pay
the employees. The same thing is true of the supplies expense. In both
cases, you need to know how many regular hot dogs and how many chili-
dogs you sell before you can allocate, or trace, supplies and wages.
Figure 4-4:
The Write
Checks
window.

Using Classes for ABC
314
In these sorts of cases, you use the Make General Journal Entries window to
classify previously unclassified expenses. Figure 4-5, for example, shows you
how to take $4,000 of previously unclassified wages expense and allocate the
amount to the regular and chilidog product lines.
The Class column is located along the right edge of the General Journal
Entry window.
Producing ABC reports
After you allocate as much overhead as you can to the product or service
lines, you can prepare a profit and loss statement by class that shows the
profitability-by-product-line data. Book IV, Chapter 2 explains and discusses
QuickBooks reports. Note that if you used the example data discussed in this
chapter, you could produce a QuickBooks report that looked almost identi-
cal to the income statement shown previously in this chapter, in Table 4-3.
To produce a profit and loss statement by class, choose the Reports➪
Company & Financial➪Profit & Loss by Class command.

any businesses work on projects or jobs. For example, one way to
look at a home builder’s business is as a series of home construction
projects. A manufacturer, such as a commercial printer, may print books,
brochures, or posters for their customers. Each of those items represents
jobs that are performed for specific customers.
Accounting works a bit differently when a firm organizes its work into projects
or jobs. Essentially, a firm needs to track revenues and expenses — not just
by a standard chart of accounts — but also by jobs or projects. Fortunately,
QuickBooks makes job costing, or project costing, pretty darn easy. In this
chapter, I talk about the tools that QuickBooks provides.
Setting Up a QuickBooks Job
To set up a QuickBooks job, choose the Customers➪Customer Center 
command. QuickBooks displays the Customer Center window, shown in
Figure 5-1.
To set up a job for a particular customer, right-click the customer, and
choose the Add Job menu command. When you do so, QuickBooks displays
the New Job window, shown in Figure 5-2.

Setting Up a QuickBooks Job
316
To set up a job for a customer, use the Job Name box to give the job or proj-
ect a name. For example, a home builder may use the address of the home as
the job (perhaps just the street address would suffice).

Optionally, you can also use the Address Info, Additional Info, Payment Info
(shown in Figure 5-3), and Job Info tabs to provide additional information about
the job. Figure 5-4 shows the Job Info tab of the New Job window. This tab
provides drop-down list boxes that you can use to identify the job status or
the job type. The tab also provides text boxes that you can use to enter the
job start date, projected end date, and actual end date. If a job is inactive
and you no longer want it to appear in the Customer Center window’s list,
you can also select the Job Is Inactive check box.
And that, my friend, is that. Essentially, all you do to begin tracking jobs is to
add jobs to the Customer Center window’s Customer:Job List. Sweet, right?

Tracking Job or Project Costs
318
Tracking Job or Project Costs
After you set up a job on the Customer:Job List, you track the income and
expenses associated with the job. To do this, you enter the customer and job
name (rather than just the customer) in the Customer:Job box. For example,
if you take a quick look at Figure 5-5, you can see the Create Invoices window
(I go into more detail about the Create Invoices window in Book III, Chapter 1).
Note that the Customer:Job box can show both the customer and job name.
If an invoice is associated with a particular job, you want to identify both the
customer and the job by using the Customer:Job box. (You can’t see the full
Customer:Job name combination, unfortunately, but it is there.) And that’s
really all it takes.
Alternatives to traditional job costing
Because QuickBooks’ job-costing approach
may not work for everybody — and may even
be more than some users need — let me point
out that you can do some simple job costing or
project costing without using the Customer:Job
box. Here are two options:
 You can use classes to segregate costs.
Classes work as a very reasonable way to
track income and expense transactions for
particular jobs if they are associated. I think
that the traditional Customer:Job box pro-
vides a more convenient way to do this.
But, if you have your heart set on it, you can
also use the Class box. The Class box or
Class column typically appears next to the
Customer:Job box or the Customer:Job
column. You work with the Class box in the
same way that you work with the
Customer:Job box. Note that the Class box
or column appears only if you enable class
tracking using the Preferences dialog box.
 You can also construct a very detailed
chart of accounts, including accounts, sub-
accounts, and sub-subaccounts. With a
very detailed chart of accounts, you can
use collections of accounts to track
expenses that are associated with particu-
lar projects or jobs. If jobs take a very long
time to complete and you’re only working
on a few jobs, for example, the chart of
accounts approach works just fine.
If you use an alternative job costing approach
with QuickBooks, unfortunately, you won’t be
able to rely on QuickBooks’ job costing reports.
QuickBooks provides, as I discuss in the next
section, a bunch of handy job costing reports.
QuickBooks expects that you use the Customer:
Job box to collect job cost information. If you
don’t use the Customer:Job box, make sure that
you have a good way to track the costs associ-
ated with a particular job or customer.
Another problem with both alternative
approaches to job costing — classes or lots of
subaccounts — is that you may later want to
use classes and subaccounts in some way
that’s incompatible with using them for job
costing. Jobs are, very frankly, best accounted
for by using the QuickBooks’ job feature.

Chapter 5

319
Other windows that you use to record income and expenses also provide
Customer:Job boxes. For example, if you look at the Time/Enter Single
Activity window, shown in Figure 5-6, you can see that QuickBooks supplies
the Customer:Job box for recording the time that you’ve worked on a partic-
ular customer’s project or job. (Book III, Chapter 1 also talks about billing for
time.) Again, all you do to track the time associated with a particular job is
to identify both the customer and the job by using the Customer:Job box.
Just because I have a compulsive personality, I need to point out one more
example of the Customer:Job box. If you take a look at the Write Checks
window, shown in Figure 5-7, you see that one of the columns shown on the
Expenses tab is the Customer:Job column. This column lets you tag any
expense amount as being associated with a particular customer’s job. All
you do is identify both the customer and the job by using the Customer:Job
column. You won’t be surprised to hear that if you happen to click the Items
tab, it also supplies a Customer:Job column.
To summarize, in order to track income and expense by job, you must identify
not only the account that some income transaction or expense transaction
falls into, you also need to identify the customer and job associated with the
income or expense transaction. You do this by entering the customer name
and job name into the Customer:Job box. And that’s all you have to do. Just
remember to fill in that box.

Job Cost Reporting
Other chapters in other books of this reference talk about QuickBooks
reports. For example, Book IV, Chapter 2 talks about how you can easily pre-
pare QuickBooks financial statements and reports. Because I have already
talked about QuickBooks reports in some detail, including how you print and
customize reports, I don’t talk about that stuff here. However, I do want to
point out that if you choose the Reports➪Jobs, Time & Mileage command,
QuickBooks displays a submenu, shown in Figure 5-8, of almost two dozen
different reports that supply job costing information. The report titles are
pretty self-explanatory. Some reports give job profitability, such as the Job
Profitability Summary report, shown in Figure 5-9. Some reports identify the
estimates associated with a particular job. Other reports compare job esti-
mates with actual job costs. You get the picture.
Obviously, you want to experiment with these reports if you do begin to use
job costing. These reports let you slice and dice your job accounting data in
a bunch of different ways. You should be able to use these reports (albeit
with perhaps some modifications) to supply most of the information that
you need to make good job costing decisions and to manage job costs.
Figure 5-8:

command.

Using Job Estimates
322
Using Job Estimates
If you’ve told QuickBooks that you want to create estimates — you do this
during the QuickBooks setup — you can create job estimates of amounts
you later invoice.
To create a job estimate, choose the Customers➪Create Estimates com-
mand. QuickBooks displays the Create Estimates window, as shown in
Figure 5-10. I don’t describe how to fill in the fields of this window because
this window mirrors the Create Invoices window, which is described in
detail in Book III, Chapter 1. In a nutshell, you fill out the Create Estimates
window the same way you fill out the Create Invoices window. This makes
sense. An estimate is just an example or guess at the future invoice for a job.
Predictably, you collect and supply the same information, and you fill the
fields in the same way.
If you have questions about how to work with a particular field or box on the
Create Estimates window, refer to Book III, Chapter 1. Find the description of
the related field on the Create Invoices window. Whatever you do with that
field in the Create Invoices window is the same thing you do in the Create
Estimates window.

If you didn’t originally turn on Estimates when you set up QuickBooks, you can
do so after the fact. Choose the Edit➪Preferences command, click the Jobs &
Estimates icon, click the Company Preferences tab, shown in Figure 5-11, and
then select the Yes radio button next to Do You Create Estimates?. You may
also want to select the Yes radio button next to Do You Do Progress Invoicing?,
if you do progress invoicing. (I talk about progress invoicing or progress
billing in the next section of this chapter.)

dialog box.
Figure 5-10:

Progress Billing
324
If you use estimates to create invoices, you actually create another way to
track job costs. You can ask QuickBooks to prepare reports that compare,
item by item, the estimated amounts for a job with the invoiced amounts for
job. To produce this report, you choose the Item Estimates vs. Actual com-
mand from the Jobs, Time & Mileage submenu.
Progress Billing
Progress billing occurs when you actually invoice, or bill, a customer for a
portion of an amount that you’ve previously estimated. For example, take a
peek at the Create Estimates window shown in Figure 5-10. Suppose that this
window records an estimate that a client has asked you to supply. Further
suppose, just for purposes of this discussion, that the estimate is for a con-
sulting job that you are doing.
If you want to later bill the consulting client for the actual work, you click the
Create Invoice button that appears along the top edge of the Create Estimates
window. QuickBooks displays the Create Progress Invoice Based On Estimate
dialog box, as shown in Figure 5-12. This dialog box lets you create an invoice
by using the estimate information.
If you select Create an Invoice for the Entire Estimate, QuickBooks creates
one invoice that uses all the information from the Create Estimates window.
Alternatively, you can select one of the other option buttons to bill only a
portion of the estimate. For example, you can select the Create Invoice for a
Percentage of the Entire Estimate radio button and then enter the percent-
age into the % of Estimate box. In this case, QuickBooks bills the customer
for some specified percentage of the estimate. Alternatively, you can also
select the Create Invoice for Selected Items or for Different Percentages of
Each Item radio button. In this case, QuickBooks lets you specify that differ-
ent percentages of the items shown on the estimate should be billed.
Figure 5-12:

Chapter 5

When you click OK, QuickBooks either creates the invoice by using the esti-
mate information, or, if you indicated that you wanted to specify different
percentages for different items on the invoice, QuickBooks displays the
Specify Invoice Amounts for Items on Estimate dialog box, as shown in
Figure 5-13. You use the Amount column to specify a portion of the estimated
amount that you want to bill on the progress invoice.
If you select the Show Quantity and Rate check box on the Specify Invoice
Amounts for Items on Estimate dialog box, QuickBooks adds columns to the
dialog box that let you see quantity and rate information. Similarly, if you
select the Show Percentage check box, QuickBooks adds columns to the
dialog box that show percentages. You probably don’t need this extra infor-
mation, but if it’s important to be very precise on your invoice, you may
want to experiment with these additional columns of information.

umbers from your financial statements make more sense when you
can compare them to other numbers and external benchmarks. In this
chapter, I talk about how you can perform this sort of analysis, which is
called ratio analysis. Even if you’re not a numbers person, you can use ratio
analysis to your benefit. Ratio analysis is easy to apply, and it enables even
the non-quantitative type of person who uses it to better understand the
information in financial statements.
Let me give you a quick example of ratio analysis. One particularly useful
ratio is the gross margin percentage, which is your gross margin divided by
your total sales. Although this ratio may not seem useful at first blush, it can
be very valuable.
For example, if you compare your gross margin percentage for this year with
last year and see a decline, you know that this isn’t good. Less gross margin
means less money for operating expenses, interest expenses, and profits. On
the other hand, if you compare your declining gross margin percentage with
a competitor and see that your competitor’s gross margin percentage is
declining even more rapidly than yours, well, you know that’s good. This
comparison shows that you may actually be in pretty good shape: At least
you aren’t hurting like your competitor.
These are the sorts of insights that ratio analysis can provide. They enable
you to put numbers from your income statement and balance sheet into
context.
This chapter steps through the formulas, provides examples, and gives
useful guidelines for 16 common financial ratios. I group the ratios into four

Some Caveats about Ratio Analysis

categories: liquidity ratios, leverage (or debt) ratios, activity ratios, and prof-
itability ratios.
Some Caveats about Ratio Analysis
Before you go any further in using ratio analysis to draw conclusions, con-
sider these two warnings about it:
✦The ratios are only as good as your inputs. Obviously, the more accu-
rate your QuickBooks accounting records, the more accurate any ratios
that you calculate by using the numbers from your QuickBooks financial
statements will be. This makes sense, right? Garbage in — garbage out.
Even if your financial records are garbage free, if they contain something
just slightly wacky, such as an unusually large transaction that skews all
the numbers, your financial ratios aren’t as good as they might be.
✦Ratios become relevant through comparison. Your financial ratios
become most relevant — I already hinted at this — by comparing your
numbers with those of your competitors, the numbers that you had a
year ago, and the numbers that a bank loan agreement specifies are nec-
essary for you to continue achieving in order to be in the good graces of
the bank. A comparison with other ratios is crucial because your num-
bers are often only just numbers if they can’t be compared with external
benchmarks.
Industries commonly prepare reports that summarize financial ratio informa-
tion of other firms in the industry. For example, early in my career, I was the
controller of an electronics manufacturing firm. Our industry group, the
American Electronics Association, prepared a financial ratio survey. With
this financial ratio survey, I was able to easily compare the financial ratios of
the firm I worked at with the financial ratios of other firms. Currently, as a
CPA, I find it very useful that the Texas Society of CPAs prepares an annual
financial study that shows financial ratios for CPA firms around the United
States. You probably also operate in an industry that has a professional asso-
ciation. Keep your eyes and ears open to the possibility that this group or
association prepares and distributes reports that include financial ratios.
Such a report can be a useful tool to you as you manage your firm.
Note: When you compare yourself with other firms by using financial ratios,
you compare yourself with firms of a similar size. It usually doesn’t make
sense to compare, for example, a million-dollar business with a billion-dollar
business.
Some of the QuickBooks financial statements provide simple financial ratios
automatically. For example, you can add the gross margin percentage (and
other percentage measures) to the standard income statement and to the

Book V
Chapter 1
Ratio Analysis
Liquidity Ratios
331
standard balance sheet. For more information about how to work with any of
these simple financial ratios, refer to Book V, Chapter 1.
Liquidity Ratios
Liquidity ratios measure how easily and comfortably a firm can pay its imme-
diate financial obligations and exploit immediate short-term financial oppor-
tunities. For example, everything else being equal, the firm that is sitting on
a large hoard of cash can more easily pay its bills and can take advantage of
great opportunities that pop up. (For example, if a competitor gets into trou-
ble and wants to sell valuable assets at fire sale prices, a very liquid firm
with great gobs of cash can more easily exploit such an opportunity.)
Current ratio
The current ratio liquidity measure compares a firm’s current assets with its
current liabilities. A firm’s current assets include cash, inventory, accounts
receivable, and any other asset that can or will be quickly turned into cash.
Most small businesses don’t have much in the way of other current assets,
although they may have some, such as short-term investments. Current lia-
bilities include bills that must be paid in the coming year: accounts payable,
wages payable, taxes payable, and — if you are borrowing money on a long-
term basis (such as through bank loans) — the principal portions of the
coming year’s payment on a loan.
The following is the exact formula used to calculate the current ratio:
current assets/current liabilities
The simple balance sheet shown in Table 1-1 gives you an example of how
this current ratio formula works. As Table 1-1 shows, this firm’s current
assets equal $50,000. The firm’s only current liability is $20,000 of accounts
payable. (For purposes of this discussion, I’m assuming that this firm has no
other current liabilities.)
To calculate the current ratio of the firm described by the balance sheet in
Table 1-1, you use the following formula:
$50,000/$20,000
This formula returns the value 2.5. Therefore, the value 2.5 is this firm’s cur-
rent ratio.
Here is a general guideline concerning current ratios: A firm’s current ratio
should be a value of 2 or higher. In other words, the firm’s current assets
should be double or more than double the firm’s current liabilities.

Acid test ratio
Also known as the quick ratio, the acid test ratio is a more severe measure of
a firm’s liquidity. However, it serves the same general purpose as the current
ratio. The acid test ratio indicates how easily a firm can meet its current
financial obligations and exploit any financial opportunities that pop up.
The following formula is used for calculating the acid test ratio:
(current assets – inventory)/current liabilities
For example, in the case of the business described by the balance sheet shown
in Table 1-1, you use the following formula to calculate the acid test ratio:
$25,000/$20,000
This formula returns the value 1.25. Therefore, the value of 1.25 is this firm’s
acid test ratio.
Here is a guideline for acid test ratio: A firm’s acid test ratio should be a
value of 1 or higher. In other words, the current assets after you subtract the
inventory should provide enough money to pay the current liabilities.

Book V
Chapter 1
Ratio Analysis
Leverage Ratios
333
Leverage Ratios
Leverage ratios measure how much debt a firm carries and how easily a firm
pays the interest expenses of carrying that debt. Leverage ratios are important
for an obvious reason. Typically, a firm mostly financed with debt needs to
continue to borrow in order to stay in business. (If this doesn’t make sense,
think about what happens if a bank won’t extend a loan or won’t refinance a
mortgage to a firm that’s heavily dependent on debt!)
What’s more, a firm that carries a lot of debt typically also spends a lot of
money on interest expense. The heavy interest expense means that it is
especially important for such a firm to have adequate operating income.
Operating income is the income available to pay interest and other profits. A
firm with a lot of operating income, relative to its interest expense, doesn’t
really have much of a problem paying the interest — and this is true even if
operating income declines or decreases. In contrast, a firm with only very
modest operating income relative to its interest expense quickly gets into
trouble if the operating income decreases.
Debt ratio
The debt ratio simply shows the firm’s debt as a percentage of its capital
structure. The term capital structure refers to the total liabilities and owner’s
equity amount. For example, in the case of the balance sheet shown in Table
1-1, the capital structure totals $320,000. Not coincidentally, the total liability
and owner’s equity amount, $320,000, equals the total assets amount,
$320,000. This makes sense if you think about it a bit. A firm funds its assets
with its capital. Therefore, the total assets always equal the total capital
structure.
The formula for calculating the debt ratio is a simple one:
total debt/total assets
Using numbers from the simple balance sheet shown in Table 1-1, for exam-
ple, the debt ratio can be calculated as follows:
$120,000/$320,000
This formula returns the debt ratio of 0.375. This indicates that 37.5 percent
of the firm’s capital comes from debt.
No guideline exists for debt ratio. Appropriate debt ratios vary by industry
and by the size of the firm in an industry. In general, small firms that use
QuickBooks probably want to show lower debt ratios than larger firms. Small

Leverage Ratios
334
firms, in my experience, see their operating income fluctuate more wildly
than large firms. Because of that fluctuation, carrying and servicing such
debt is more problematic. Lower debt, therefore, is probably better. This
makes sense, of course, so I’m not telling you anything that you don’t
already know.
Debt equity ratio
A debt equity ratio compares a firm’s long-term debt with a stockholder’s
equity or owner’s equity. Essentially, the debt equity ratio expresses a firm’s
long-term debt as a percentage of its owner’s equity.
Stockholder’s equity is synonymous with owner’s equity and, in the case of a
sole proprietorship, with a sole proprietor’s capital account.
The following is the formula used to calculate a debt equity ratio:
long-term debt/stockholder’s equity
By using the example balance sheet shown in Table 1-1, you can calculate
the debt equity ratio by using this formula:
$100,000/$200,000
This formula returns the debt equity ratio of 0.5. Therefore, this firm’s long-
term debt equals 0.5, or 50 percent of its owner’s equity.
I can’t really give you a guideline for a debt equity ratio. You simply compare
your debt equity ratio with the debt equity ratios of other, similar-sized firms
in your industry. As is the case with the debt ratio previously described, the
less long-term debt you carry, the better — all other things being equal.
Times interest earned ratio
The times interest earned ratio indicates how easily a firm pays interest
expenses incurred on its debt. In order to calculate the times interest earned
ratio, you need an income statement that shows both operating income and
interest expense. Table 1-2 provides this information.

The following formula is used for calculating the times interest earned ratio:
operating income/interest expense
If you look at the income statement shown in Table 1-2, you see that operat-
ing income, which is the income that a firm has before paying its interest
expense, equals $60,000. Interest expense shows up as $10,000. Therefore,
you calculate the times interest earned ratio by using this formula:
$60,000/$10,000
This formula returns the times interest earned ratio of 6. Therefore, the
firm’s operating profits pay the interest expense six times over.
No standard guideline exists for the times interest earned ratio. Obviously,
however, the times interest earned ratio should indicate that a firm can easily
pay its interest expense. It would be sort of scary, if you think about it, for
the operating income to only be a little bit greater than the firm’s interest
expense. Such a situation would indicate that a modest drop in operating
income would make paying interest expense impossible.
Fixed-charges coverage ratio
The fixed-charges coverage ratio resembles the times interest earned ratio.
The fixed-charges coverage ratio calculates how easily a firm pays not only
its interest expenses but also any principal payments on loans and any other
obligations for which a firm is legally obligated to pay.
The fixed-charges coverage ratio uses the following formula:
income available for fixed charges/fixed charges
Returning to the example business described by the balance sheet shown in
Table 1-1 and the income statement shown in Table 1-2, suppose that the
$5,000 of rent shown in the income statement is actually a fixed charge
because the firm is renting space on a long-term lease. Further suppose that,
for the purpose of this ratio, although it doesn’t show up on the income

statement, the $100,000 loan that shows up on the balance sheet requires
annual $5,000 in principal payments.
In this case, this firm is obligated to pay fixed charges as summarized in
Table 1-3. In total, then, fixed charges for this firm equal $20,000 a year.

The other input needed to calculate the fixed-charges coverage ratio is the
income available for these fixed charges. Table 1-4 shows you how to calcu-
late the income available for fixed charges. You start with the operating
income, which equals $60,000, as shown in Table 1-2. (Remember that the
operating income is the income before paying interest expense.) You must
add to the operating income any fixed charges included in the income state-
ment. In this case, the rent turns out to be a fixed charge. Therefore, the
$5,000 of rent needs to be added to the operating income in order to get
income available for fixed charges. As Table 1-4 shows, the income available
for fixed charges equals $65,000.
Table 1-4

With the two needed inputs, you can calculate the fixed-charges coverage
ratio by using this formula:
$65,000/$20,000
This formula returns a fixed-charges coverage ratio of 3.25, which indicates
that the firm generates slightly more than three times as much income as
needed to pay its fixed charges.
No guideline exists to specify what your fixed-charges coverage ratio should
be. In fact, it is particularly difficult to get the information necessary to think
about fixed-charge coverage ratios because fixed charges don’t clearly appear

Book V
Chapter 1

in the standard set of simple financial statements. One of the things that
make financial statements (that are prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles) so useful is that the fixed-charges informa-
tion is usually disclosed in little footnotes that appear at the end of the finan-
cial statements.
Activity Ratios
Activity ratios provide an indication of how efficiently a firm runs its opera-
tions. For example (all other factors being equal), a firm that keeps a very
modest amount of inventory is in better shape than a firm that has to keep
(store, manage, warehouse, insure, and so forth) a bunch of inventory. That
makes sense, right?
Dell Computer, as you may know, keeps only a few days’ worth of inventory
on hand. In other words, it sells out its current inventory holdings every few
days. Other computer manufacturers — especially in the past — kept weeks
and even months worth of inventory. Comparing the two examples, which 
is more efficiently and more leanly managing its inventory? Which has the
minimal investment tied up? Which isn’t suffering or paying the price of
warehousing all that extra, quickly obsolete inventory? The answer is Dell,
obviously. So, predictably, Dell’s activity ratios look really good compared
with its competitors.
Activity ratios, in essence, measure how well a firm uses its assets. If a firm
makes super-efficient use of its factory, for example, that efficiency shows up
in its activity ratios. And if a firm runs lean and mean, that leanness and
meanness shows up in its activity ratios.
Inventory turnover ratio
The inventory turnover ratio measures how many times in an accounting
period the inventory balance sells out. The formula is as follows:
cost of goods sold/average inventory
In the example business described by the balance sheet in Table 1-1 and the
income statement in Table 1-2, you can use the following formula to calculate
the inventory turnover:
$30,000/$25,000
This formula returns the inventory turnover ratio of 1.2.

Activity Ratios
338
Technically, you shouldn’t use just an ending inventory balance, which is
what appears in Table 1-1. You should use an average inventory balance. You
can calculate an average inventory balance in all the usual, common-sense
ways. For example, you can use the inventory balance both from this year’s
balance sheet and the previous year’s balance sheet and then average them.
The inventory turnover period, as you may have noticed, depends on the
period measured in the income statement. If the income statement is an
annual statement and, therefore, the cost of goods sold amount is an annual
cost of goods sold amount, an inventory turnover ratio of 1.2 means that a
firm sells 120 percent of its inventory balance in a year. If the inventory
turnover ratio uses the cost of goods sold amount reported in a monthly
income statement, then the inventory turnover period is a month. For exam-
ple, with a monthly cost of goods sold amount, a firm with a 1.2 inventory
ratio sells 120 percent of its inventory in a month.
No guideline exists for inventory turnover ratios. A good inventory turnover
ratio depends on what your competitors are doing within your industry. If
you want to stay competitive, you want an inventory turnover ratio that at
least comes close to your competitor’s ratio. Dell’s competitors, to make a
long, sad story short, found out the hard way not to compete with someone
who turns around inventory much more quickly than they could. (Imagine
soft, sad violin music playing in the background. . . .)
Days of inventory ratio
The days of inventory ratio resembles the inventory turnover financial ratio;
it estimates how many days of inventory a firm is storing. The ratio uses the
following formula:
average inventory/(annual cost of goods sold/365)
For example, the simple balance sheet shown in Table 1-1 shows inventory
equal to $25,000. Assume that this also equals the average inventory that the
firm carries. In order to calculate the daily sales, you take the cost of goods
sold number reported in the annual income statement shown in Table 1-2
and divide it by 365 (the number of days in a year). Putting these numbers
together in the formula just introduced, the math looks like this:
$25,000/($30,000/365)
This formula returns the value 304 (roughly). This value means that this firm
is carrying roughly 304 days of inventory. Stated another way, this firm
would require 304 days of sales to sell its entire inventory.

Book V
Chapter 1
Ratio Analysis
Activity Ratios
339
As is the case with the inventory turnover ratio, you don’t see generalized
rules for what is an acceptable number for days of inventory. The general
rule is that you turn around your inventory just as quickly as your competi-
tor does.
I return to the case of Dell Computer because it’s so instructive — even if
scary — to most of us. Dell sells out its inventory in a few days. Dell’s com-
petitors were taking months to sell out their inventory. In an industry where
inventory was quickly becoming obsolete and was very expensive to start
with, think of the competitive disadvantage that Dell’s competitors suffered
by having to carry inventory for months longer than Dell did. Is it any wonder
that many of Dell’s competitors got into trouble? The lesson of Dell applies
to many of us who run or advise businesses that carry inventory. Inventory
turnover and days of inventory ratios need to be watched carefully and be
compared to other firms of the same size in the same industry.
Average collection period ratio
The average collection period ratio shows how long it takes for a firm to 
collect on its receivables. You can think about this ratio as a measure of the
quality of a firm’s credit and collection procedures. In other words, this ratio
shows how smart a firm is at deciding to whom to extend credit. This ratio
also shows how effective a firm is in collecting from customers.
The average collection period ratio formula looks like this:
average accounts receivable/average credit sales per day
The balance sheet shown in Table 1-1 doesn’t show an average accounts
receivable balance. The income statement shown in Table 1-2 also doesn’t
break out sales into credit and cash components. Therefore, let me intro-
duce another example into the text. Suppose that in the business you run,
the average accounts receivable is $60,000. Further suppose that your aver-
age credit daily sales equal $1,000. Using the formula just given, you can cal-
culate the average collection period as follows:
$60,000/$1,000
This formula returns the value 60. In this case, your business has 60 days of
sales in accounts receivable.
The guideline about the average collection period is that it should tie to your
payment terms. If your average number of days of credit sales in accounts
receivable equals 60, for example, your payment terms should probably be

Activity Ratios
340
something like net 60 days (which means customers are supposed to pay
you in 60 days or less). Your average collection period, in other words,
should show that most of your customers are paying on time. Remember
that some of your customers will pay early, and obviously, some of your cus-
tomers will pay a bit late. You hope that, on average, customers pay on time.
Fixed asset turnover ratio
The fixed asset turnover ratio quantifies how efficiently a firm employs its
fixed assets. Predictably, this financial ratio is most useful when a firm has a
lot of fixed assets: real estate, equipment, and so forth.
The fixed asset turnover ratio uses the following formula:
sales/fixed assets
Based on the numbers supplied by the balance sheet shown in Table 1-1 and
the income statement shown in Table 1-2, you can calculate the following
fixed asset turnover ratio:
$150,000/$270,000
This formula returns the value of 0.556. In a nutshell, this ratio says that this
firm requires $270,000 of fixed assets to produce $150,000 of sales or, more
specifically, that the firm produces sales equal to roughly 56 percent of its
fixed assets.
As is the case with many of these financial ratios, no guideline exists that
you can use to determine a good fixed asset turnover ratio. You compare
your fixed asset turnover ratio with firms of a similar size in your industry.
Total assets turnover ratio
The total assets turnover ratio also measures how efficiently you’re employing
your assets. This ratio is probably more appropriate in the situation where a
firm doesn’t have a lot of fixed assets, but the firm still wins or loses at the
game of business based on how well the firm manages its assets.
The total assets turnover ratio formula is as follows:
sales/total assets
Here’s the formula that calculates the ratio by using the financial data from
Tables 1-1 and 1-2. If the total sales equal $150,000 and the total assets equal
$320,000, the following formula makes the calculation:
$150,000/$320,000

Book V
Chapter 1
Ratio Analysis
Profitability Ratios
341
This formula returns the ratio of 0.469, which means that the firm generates
sales equal to roughly 47 percent of its total assets.
The total assets turnover ratio that you calculate for your business can’t be
compared with some external benchmark or standardized rule. You compare
your ratio with the same ratio of similarly sized businesses in your industry.
Obviously, your main consideration is whether you’re efficiently using your
assets to produce sales relative to your competitors. The more sales you can
produce with a given level of assets, the better off your business is.
Profitability Ratios
The profitability ratios analyze a firm’s profitability. In a sense, these profitabil-
ity ratios are the most important ratios that you can calculate. They typically
provide terribly useful insights into how profitable a firm is and why.
For example, one particularly important profitability ratio is the gross
margin percentage, which expresses gross margin as a percent of sales. As
discussed in Book VI, Chapter 1, you can calculate a firm’s break-even point
by simply dividing the firm’s fixed costs by its gross margin percentage.
Gross margin percentage
Also known as the gross profit margin ratio, the gross margin percentage
shows how much a firm has left over after paying its cost of goods sold. The
gross margin is what pays the operating expenses, financing expenses (inter-
est), and, of course, the profits.
The gross margin percentage ratio uses the following formula:
gross margin/sales
For example, using the data from Table 1-2, you can calculate gross margin
percentage as follows:
$120,000/$150,000
This formula returns the value of 0.8, meaning that gross margin equals 80
percent of the firm’s sales.
No guideline exists for what a gross margin percentage should be. Some
firms enjoy very high gross margins. Other firms make good money even
though the gross margin percentages are very low. In general, of course, the
higher the gross margin percentage, the better.

Profitability Ratios
342
I need to make one cautionary statement here: In my humble opinion, small
businesses should enjoy high gross margin percentages. I think it is common
to assume that a small business can get away with a lower gross margin per-
centage than some large competitors can. However, in my experience, that
isn’t really true. Gross margin percentages should be higher for small busi-
nesses because small businesses often can’t get the economies of scale that
large businesses can get. A low gross margin percentage may work just fine
for a Wal-Mart, for example. However, it’s tough for a small retailer to work
with such a small gross margin percentage.
Operating income/sales
In the case of the business shown in Table 1-2, where operating income equals
$60,000 and sales equal $150,000, you calculate the net operating margin per-
centage by using this formula:
$60,000/$150,000
This formula returns the value 0.4. A 0.4 operating margin percentage, which
is equivalent to 40 percent, indicates that a firm’s operating income equals
40 percent of its sales.
No guideline exists for what a net operating margin percentage should be.
Your main consideration, which you will probably find yourself repeating in
your sleep after hearing me say it so much, is that you want to be
competitive. You want your operating margin percentage to be close to or
better than those of your competitors’ net operating margin percentages.
That parity (or superiority) enables you to stay competitive.
Profit margin percentage
The profit margin percentage works like the net operating margin percentage;
it expresses the firm’s net income as a percentage of sales, as shown in the
following formula:
net income/sales
In the case of the business described by the income statement shown in
Table 1-2, the net income equals $50,000, and sales equal $150,000. This
firm’s profit margin percentage, therefore, can be calculated with the follow-
ing formula:
$50,000/$150,000
This formula returns a financial ratio of 0.33. This indicates that the firm’s
net income equals roughly 33 percent of its sales.

Book V
Chapter 1
Ratio Analysis
Profitability Ratios
343
Return on assets
The return on assets shows the return that the firm delivers to stockholders
and the interest that the firm pays to lenders as the percentage of the firm’s
assets. Some businesses use return on assets to evaluate the business’s prof-
itability. (Banks do this, for example.)
The actual formula is
(net income + interest)/total assets
In the case of the example business described in Tables 1-1 and 1-2, the net
income equals $50,000. Interest expense equals $10,000. Total assets equal
$320,000. The formula to calculate this firm’s return on assets is
($50,000 + $10,000)/$320,000
This formula returns the value 0.188. This value indicates that the firm’s
return (including both net income and interest) on its assets is roughly 19
percent.
No guideline exists for what a return on assets ratio should be. The main
consideration is, predictably, that the return on assets must exceed the capi-
tal charges on the assets.
In Book V, Chapter 2, I talk more about capital charges and how they relate
to something called economic value added analysis. Capital charges aren’t
complicated to understand. The bottom line is that a firm needs to deliver a
return on its assets that exceeds the funding sources cost for those assets.
In other words, if (on average) the creditor and shareholders providing
money to a firm want something less than, for example, 19 percent and the
firm can earn 19 percent as its return on assets, that’s really good. If, on the
other hand, the return on assets percentage is 18.8 percent, but the funding
sources for those assets cost 20 percent, well, that’s not so good. That firm
is in trouble.
The term capital charge just equals the sum of the minimum profit that
shareholders require to invest their money in a firm and the interest charges
that lenders require for the money that they’ve loaned to the firm.
Return on equity
The return on equity financial ratio expresses a firm’s net income as a per-
centage of its owner’s equity or shareholders’ equity (shareholder’s and
owner’s equity are the same thing).

Profitability Ratios
344
The formula, which is deceptively simple, is as follows:
net income/owner’s equity
In the case of the example business described in Tables 1-1 and 1-2, the net
income equals $50,000, and the owner’s equity equals $200,000. This firm’s
return on equity, therefore, can be calculated by using the following formula:
$50,000/$200,000
This formula returns the value of 0.25, which means that this firm’s return on
equity is 25 percent — a number that’s probably pretty good.
No guideline exists for what is and is not an acceptable return on equity.
However, I can make two useful observations about how you should inter-
pret the return on equity ratio that you calculate:
✦The return on equity ratio that you calculate needs to be at least as
good as you deserve. Okay, that sounds circular. So think about it this
way: If you are investing money in your business, you deserve a return
on that money. And that return needs to be reasonable compared with
your other alternatives. If you can go out and invest money in a stock
market mutual fund and get 10 percent, you shouldn’t be investing in
things that deliver a return of less than 10 percent. That makes sense,
right? Therefore, if you want to earn a 20 percent return on the money
that you’ve invested in your own firm (by the way, a 20 percent return is
a very reasonable return for a small business), you want to make sure
that your return on equity (after you get going) exceeds this minimum
return.
✦The return on equity ratio hints at the sustainable growth rate that
your firm can manage. This sounds complicated. However, you need to
understand what sustainable growth is and how it ties back to the return
on equity ratio. Sustainable growth is the growth rate that your business
can sustain over a long period of time: three years, five years, ten years,
and so on. If you don’t take money out of the business (other than your
salary) and you reinvest the return on equity that the business gener-
ates, the return on equity ratio equals your sustainable growth. In other
words, the example business described in Tables 1-1 and 1-2 can grow
on a sustained basis as fast as 25 percent.
Alternatively, suppose that the owners of the imaginary firm previously
described in the financial statements take half of the equity money out of the
business. Perhaps half of the $50,000 net income is distributed as a dividend
to shareholders, for example. In this case, because only half of the return on
equity is reinvested, sustainable growth only equals half of the return on

Book V
Chapter 1
Ratio Analysis
Profitability Ratios
345
equity percentage. If the return on equity percentage equals 25 percent but
the owners withdraw half of the return (12.5 percent), the reinvested half of
the return on equity percentage (12.5 percent) equals the sustainable growth
rate. In other words, this business can grow on a sustained basis at 12.5 per-
cent annually.
In my experience, this sustainable growth business makes intuitive sense to
some people, but it just leads to head-scratching for other people. In case
you’re in the head-scratching group, consider a couple more comments:
✦Growing sales and profits also requires growing your capital struc-
ture. The idea of a sustainable growth rate (which was pioneered by
Hewlett-Packard, interestingly enough) is based on an intuitively under-
standable proposition: To grow your sales and your profits over the long
run, you need to grow your assets. If you’re going to double your sales
and your profits, for example, you’re probably going to have to double
your assets. And if you double your assets, you must double your fund-
ing of those assets. Doubled funding of your assets means that you
double your borrowing and your owner’s equity. Assuming that you can
get creditors to loan you more money — that should be possible if
you’re growing not only sales but profits — you still need to double your
owner’s equity. And the way that you usually double or grow your
owner’s equity in a small business is by reinvesting the return on the
equity.
Large businesses also have another way to grow owner’s equity. A large
business, such as Hewlett-Packard, can go out into the capital markets
and raise money by issuing stock. In fact, the real reason for making a
company public isn’t to make the owners rich but to access the public’s
capital markets. Those markets provide a firm with access to almost
unlimited amounts of capital. (That is, unless you pull an Enron or
WorldCom by proving that you don’t really deserve access to the capital
markets.) In the case where a firm can tap these capital markets for cash
or funding, the sustainable growth rate formula gets more complicated.
These capital markets provide another way to grow owner’s equity.
✦If you don’t grow owner’s equity as your business grows, watch out.
You’ll have big problems if you ignore the sustainable growth rate if your
business grows fast. If you don’t grow your owner’s equity at least as
fast as your business grows, your debt percentage ratio skyrockets (per-
haps) without you even realizing it. Just think about this logically: If your
sales double, your assets probably double. And if your owner’s equity
doesn’t double, creditors have to make up the difference. Exploding
debt means that it becomes all the more important for you to refinance
that debt and refinance even larger amounts of that debt. And exploding
debt means that your interest expense is growing all the time because
your debt levels are rising.

Profitability Ratios
346
I’ve seen more businesses fail because they ignored the sustainable growth
concept than for any other reason. In the case where a successful business —
defined as one that has been making a reasonable profit and is chugging
along merrily — gets into trouble as the firm grows, the problem almost
invariably is that the firm has grown too fast. The firm has grown faster than
its capital base can grow. And that only leads to trouble. The symptoms
often make the situation look like something other than a problem of grow-
ing too fast. However, when you boil everything down to its essence, in my
experience, the successful business that fails or gets into trouble as it grows
has simply ignored the realities of sustainable growth.

H
ere’s a curious fact: Even if your QuickBooks income statement shows
a profit, you may not actually be making any money. How can this be?
Ah, to really answer this question you need to use a tool called Economic
Value Added analysis (EVA), which was developed by (and is a trademark of)
Stern Stewart & Co., a management consulting firm.
In this chapter, I discuss what Economic Value Added analysis does and how
you can use the information that you create with QuickBooks to perform the
EVA analysis. This is neat stuff but a bit theoretical. Fortunately, when you
boil EVA down to its very essence, it’s quite practical.
Introducing the Logic of EVA
Economic Value Added analysis states in a formula something you already
know in your gut: If you are a business owner and you can make more money
by selling your business and reinvesting the proceeds, then hey — you’re
not doing yourself or your family any favors by running your own business.
Let me walk you through an example to show you mathematically why this
is the case. Suppose that after paying yourself a fair salary, your firm makes
$20,000 in additional profits. Further suppose that you can sell your firm to
a competitor for $200,000. If you did, you could probably invest the money
in a stock mutual fund and earn about $20,000 a year in profits, right? (And
yes, I know that the stock market doesn’t promise 10 percent annual returns,

EVA in Action
348
but neither does your business. So just suppose that these numbers are
right for the purposes of this discussion.)
In this simple example, running your own business doesn’t really make
sense. Sure, you’re making a salary. And, sure, you’re earning a return on the
money that you and your family have invested. But you aren’t getting any-
thing more than that. You may as well just sell your firm, reinvest the money
in the stock market (just one option), and get a job working for the phone
company.
Don’t get all bummed out on me here — I’m not trying to talk you into selling
your business. I just want to explain how to use a powerful tool, EVA, to
better manage your business.
EVA in Action
EVA analysis has two variations; I explain the simple version first. If I start
with the simple version, you may better understand all the little nuances and
subtleties of the EVA model from the very start. After you’re finished with
the simple version of EVA analysis — called an equity-based EVA — you are
ready to move on to the more complicated EVA model.
In order to proceed with this discussion, take a gander at a couple of financial
statements. Table 2-1 shows a simple income statement, and Table 2-2 shows
a simple balance sheet. These two financial statements provide much — and
maybe most — of the information that you need to perform EVA analysis for
your business. In fact, just go ahead and suppose that these two financial
statements describe your business.

If you’re uncomfortable interpreting either income statements or balance
sheet financial statements, you may want to review the material covered in
Book I, Chapter 1. In that chapter, I describe how financial statements work.
If you’re not sure how to produce a financial statement by using QuickBooks,
refer to Book IV, Chapter 2. In that chapter, I describe how to prepare
QuickBooks financial statements, including income statements (also known
as profit & loss statements) and balance sheets.
Essentially, EVA includes a charge for the capital that you’ve invested in a
business. To see whether you are actually making money, you deduct this
charge from your net income. A positive EVA amount indicates that your
business truly produces an economic profit; in other words, a positive EVA
amount indicates that even after your firm pays wages to employees, inter-
est to lenders, and a return to shareholders, some money is left over. This
leftover money is the economic profit.
The capital charge equals the cost of the capital (specified as an interest rate
or annual return percentage) multiplied by the capital invested in the busi-
ness period. The capital invested in your business equals, essentially, your
owner’s equity. The cost of capital return percentage equals the return that
you could earn in a similarly risky investment in something else.
An example of EVA
From the example data in Tables 2-1 and 2-2, calculate each of these amounts
by using the following steps:

EVA in Action
350
1. Calculate the capital charge.
For the sake of illustration, suppose that you earn a 20 percent return on
the money that you have invested in the business described in Tables 2-1
and 2-2. To calculate an EVA in this situation, use the following formula:
capital charge = 20% × $200,000 (of owner’s equity)
The result of this formula is a capital charge of $40,000. That’s the amount
that should be returned to the shareholder. (In the case of a small busi-
ness owned and operated by an entrepreneur, the shareholder is the
owner/entrepreneur.)
2. Subtract the capital charge from the net income.
In Table 2-1, the net income equals $50,000. To calculate the EVA, use the
following formula:
net income ($50,000) – capital charge ($40,000) = EVA
The result — $10,000 — equals the EVA.
Therefore, by using the data from the example business detailed in Tables
2-1 and 2-2 and assuming a 20 percent cost of capital, this business delivers
an economic profit. After paying each stakeholder his or her fair share, the
firm also has leftover money — an economic profit — of $10,000.
Another example of EVA
To continue this example, suppose that the capital charge is really $50,000
(calculated by multiplying a 25 percent cost of capital percentage by the
$200,000 of capital or owner’s equity). In this case, what does the EVA equal?
The answer is zero. In other words, if the business makes $50,000 of profit
(refer to Table 2-1) but the shareholders require a $50,000 return on their
investment (calculated as 25 percent multiplied by $200,000), the business
produces no EVA.
Does the preceding scenario make sense to you? The math may seem a little
unwieldy, but don’t get too tangled up in the computations. My guess is that
you understand in your gut what EVA analysis does. If you really did own a
business like the one summarized in Table 2-1 and Table 2-2, you know that
you should be earning a fair return on the money that you and your family
have invested. And if you’re only earning the same amount of money that
you could earn in any other business — say a stock mutual fund — you’re
not really getting ahead.
That’s all EVA analysis really does. It makes sure that you’re getting at least a
fair return (or, ideally, more than that) on your investment.

Some Important Points about EVA
The purpose of EVA analysis is simple: You want to see whether you’re earn-
ing an economic profit by owning your own business.
To make sure that you’re on track with your analysis, you typically want to
consider several things:
✦How good are the numbers? This is an important point. Do your
income statement and balance sheet values really describe your profit
(one of the numbers used in your calculation) and the value that you
may be able to sell for and then reinvest (another important value used
in your calculation)? You are always going to have to accept some impre-
cision in your numbers. That’s a fact of life. But a lot of imprecision in
those two numbers corrupts the results.
You should compare your owner’s equity value with what you think you
would get if you sold your business. If your owner’s equity value (the
amount shown on your balance sheet) is wildly different from the cash-
out value, you should probably use the cash-out value in your EVA analy-
sis rather than the owner’s equity value.
✦How good is the cost of capital percentage? The capital charge calcula-
tion relies heavily on the cost of capital value. This is a tough number to
come up with, quite frankly. If you owned a billion-dollar business, you
would probably need a team of Ph.D.s to come up with a number for you
(and clearly this isn’t feasible for a small business). Therefore, I recom-
mend that you use a range of values. Many people think that a small
business (any business with sales less than, say, $50 million) should pro-
duce returns annually of 20 to 25 percent. That seems to be a good range
of values to use in EVA analysis. You may also be interested to know that
for a large company, the cost of capital rates run from approximately 
10 to 12 percent. So you clearly don’t want to be that low. Finally, note
that venture capital returns — those returns delivered by the most suc-
cessful, fastest growing small businesses — often run 35 to 45 percent
annually. It seems, therefore, that cost of capital rates used in your EVA
analysis should be considerably less than this. Or at least for most busi-
nesses, the cost of capital rates should be considerably less than 35 to
45 percent.
Try a range of rates when you perform EVA analysis. For example, try 15
percent as your cost of capital, then 20 percent, 25 percent, and 30 per-
cent. The calculations, after you have the profit number and the owner’s
equity number, are pretty simple after all. It’s not really difficult to calcu-
late several estimates of EVA.

Using EVA When Your Business Has Debt
352
✦What about psychological income? In the case of an owner-managed
business, I think it’s okay to factor in psychological income. You can’t
ignore the economy. A viable healthy business — especially if it’s yours —
should deliver a nice profit over time and pay for the capital that it uses.
Having said that, however, if you really love your work, I’m the last guy
to say that you should sell your winery and go to work for the local big
box retailer. (Not that there’s anything wrong with wearing an orange vest
and spending all day on concrete floors.) My point is that, in my opinion,
owning your own business is about more than just an economic profit.
✦Have fluctuations occurred? Another important point is that in many
small businesses (and in all the small businesses that I’ve owned and
managed), profits fluctuate. You can’t, therefore, look at just a single,
perhaps terribly bad year and decide it’s time to pack up. Similarly, you
also shouldn’t look at just a single blowout year and decide it’s time to
buy the villa in the south of France. EVA analysis works when the inputs
reflect the general condition of the business — the general level of prof-
its, the general amount for which you could cash out, the general cost 
of capital estimate, and so on. If something screwy happens one year to
push one of these inputs way out of whack, the results returned by your
EVA analysis become pretty undependable, in my opinion.
✦Is your business in a special situation? Everybody admits that EVA
analysis is really tricky and may be impossible in certain situations. For
example, most people who love EVA analysis readily admit that EVA
analysis doesn’t work very well in a start-up business situation. Most of
these people also admit that EVA analysis doesn’t work very well when a
firm is growing very quickly. In both of these cases, the problem is that
the income statement just doesn’t produce an accurate measure of the
value being created by the company. As a result, it’s impossible to really
figure out what sort of economic profit the business has created. Again,
this should make intuitive sense. You may very well expect that in the
first year or two, the business produces a loss or very meager profits.
And that is totally okay.
Your EVA calculation is only as good as your inputs and assumptions. The
trend or pattern in EVA values is probably more important than a particular
value. And that’s especially true for business owners. In the end, you can’t
lose sight of the big picture, which is answering the question, “Am I really
making money by running my own business?”
Using EVA When Your Business Has Debt
In very large businesses, EVA analysis gets really computationally burden-
some. Although I don’t go into great detail about potential problems in this
chapter, you should be familiar with one common complication: debt.

Book V
Chapter 2
Economic Value
Added Analysis
Using EVA When Your Business Has Debt
353
Here’s the deal. If a business can restructure its debt, bank loans, credit lines,
mortgages, and so forth, borrowing can be used to boost EVA. Accordingly,
and quite helpfully, another EVA model, which is slightly more complicated,
enables you to recognize this extra wrinkle. In this section, I provide a couple
of examples of how this slightly more sophisticated EVA model works.
The first example of the modified EVA formula
If your firm can freely restructure its debts, you may want to make two adjust-
ments to the EVA analysis. First, you may need to use an all-encompassing
cost of capital. An all-encompassing cost of capital considers both the cost of
equity (this is what I did earlier in the first part of this chapter) and the cost
of any debt. Second, you use an adjusted net income number that includes
not only the amounts paid to the shareholders but also the amounts paid to
lenders.
Calculating an all-encompassing cost of capital is the first step. For the sake
of illustration, suppose that a business uses capital from three sources: trade
vendors, a bank (which loans money at 10 percent), and the owner’s equity.
Table 2-3 shows an approach to estimating the capital charge that needs to
be compared with the net income when this other debt is considered.
Table 2-3
Estimating the All-Encompassing Capital Charge
Trade vendors ($20,000 @ 0 percent)
$0
Bank loan ($100,000 @ 10 percent)
10,000
Owner’s equity ($200,000 @ 20 percent)
40,000
Adjusted capital charge
$50,000
Let me walk you through the numbers in Table 2-3, although none of them is
difficult to figure out:
✦Trade vendors: The trade vendors provide debt — $20,000 in the bal-
ance sheet shown in Table 2-2 — but the firm doesn’t have to pay a
charge to those creditors. In effect, any implicit charge that the firm
pays to trade vendors is already counted in the amount that you pay
those vendors for the products or services that they supply. So, that
portion of the capital charge is zero.
✦Bank loan: This $100,000 bank loan charges 10 percent. That bank loan,
then, carries a $10,000 capital charge. In other words, in order to use the
bank’s capital, the business pays $10,000 a year.
✦Owner’s equity: This final component of the capital charge is what the
business owes the owners. In Table 2-3, the owner’s equity capital

Using EVA When Your Business Has Debt
354
charge is shown as $40,000. (This is the same $40,000 capital charge dis-
cussed earlier in the chapter.) This capital charge is calculated by multi-
plying a cost of capital percentage, 20 percent, times the owner’s equity
(20 percent of $200,000 equals $40,000). The adjusted capital charge,
therefore, equals $50,000.
Okay. So far, so good. The second step in working with this slightly more com-
plicated EVA model is to add back the interest charges paid to lenders in
order to achieve an adjusted income number. Think about this for a minute.
The business made $50,000 in income (as shown in Table 2-1), but this amount
has already been adjusted for $10,000 of interest expense. Therefore, if you
want to compare the funds that the business generated and that are available
to pay capital sources, you need to add back the $10,000 of interest expense.
In other words, when you are looking at paying all the capital sources of
return (whether in the form of interest or dividends), you not only have the
$50,000 of net income, you also have the $10,000 of interest expense. Does
that make sense?
Finally, there’s a pot of money left over at the end to pay creditors and
owners. And the pot of money, as shown on the income statement in Table
2-1, includes both the $10,000 of interest expense and the $50,000 of net
income.
After you’ve figured out an all-encompassing cost of capital and an adjusted
income amount, you can calculate the EVA in the usual way. In this example,
you use the following formula:
adjusted income ($60,000) – the weighted cost of capital
charge ($50,000)
The result equals $10,000, which is the EVA amount.
It’s no coincidence that the simple EVA formula and the more complicated
EVA formula return the same result. EVA shouldn’t change because you use a
more complicated formula — as long as both the simple and complicated
formulas are correct. (They are.) So what’s up? The more complicated for-
mula lets you see how changes in your debt affect the EVA.
Another EVA with debt example
Here’s another example of the modified EVA approach. Suppose that you, the
business owner, go down to the bank and take out another $100,000 loan.
Then suppose that the business pays this amount out to the business owner
(you) in the form of a dividend. If this were done at the beginning of the year,
you get the income statement and balance sheet shown in Table 2-4 and
Table 2-5 (reflecting the additional loan).

In other words, the only difference between the description of the business
in Tables 2-1 and 2-2 and its description in these two tables is that the firm
has $100,000 more debt and $100,000 less owner’s equity, and the extra debt
produces another $10,000 a year of interest expense. That’s pretty straight-
forward, right? All I’ve really talked about is using more debt and less
owner’s equity.
Table 2-6 estimates the capital charge for this new, more highly leveraged firm.
Once again, let me walk you through the components of the capital charge.
The trade vendors, who supply $20,000 of trade credit in the form of accounts

payable, don’t really charge anything, so there is no capital charge for their
contribution to the firm’s capital structure. In the new, more highly lever-
aged firm, the bank loan charge has gone way up. Now the firm is carrying a
$200,000 loan. With 10 percent interest, the capital charge on the loan rises
to $20,000 annually.

20,000
Owner’s equity ($100,000 @ 20 percent)

Adjusted capital charge
$40,000
The final owner’s equity capital charge also changes — it drops. With the
decrease in owner’s equity to just $100,000, the 20 percent capital charge
decreases to $20,000 a year.
When you add up all the bits and pieces, you come up with an adjusted capi-
tal charge of $40,000. Remember that this is the capital charge for the new,
more highly leveraged business.
For this new, more highly leveraged business, the EVA changes. The adjusted
income for the business is $60,000 (calculated as the $40,000 of net income
plus $20,000 of interest expense). You can calculate the EVA by subtracting
the $40,000 capital charge from the $60,000 of adjusted income. The result
equals $20,000 of EVA. The EVA doubles, obviously, by more highly leverag-
ing the business.
This second example shows why the more complicated EVA formula can be
useful. The example recognizes more explicitly how EVA results when a firm
produces income in excess of the capital charges.
Two Final Pointers
I want to share two final pointers with business owners who may want to 
use EVA analysis to think about the economics of their businesses. (My first
point is pretty basic, but I think it’s probably the most important thing to
take away from this chapter.)
✦EVA analysis is most useful to business owners and managers — or at
least to small- and medium-sized firms — as a thinking tool. In other
words, even if you don’t scratch out the numbers on the back of an enve-
lope, EVA makes sense as a way to think about how you should run your
business and whether it makes sense to make changes. Comparing your

Book V

357
firm’s net income with the amount that you could earn by selling and
then reinvesting the capital elsewhere is a useful concept.
I have a literary agent friend who likes to say, “Listen to the universe.” I
think that his suggestion, especially as it relates to the economics of run-
ning a business, is pretty darn good. You should listen to the economy
when you think about your business, and EVA provides a tool for you to
do that. In order for a business to make sense, it needs to return a fair
share to each of its stakeholders: wages to employees, interest and debt
service payments to lenders, a return to shareholders who invested cap-
ital, and then, as a practical matter, a little something left over for you,
the owner. Indeed, in order for a business to make sense, it needs to pay
more than just its capital charge.
✦Although you can use EVA analysis to evaluate a business in its
entirety, EVA analysis isn’t limited to that application. You can use EVA
analysis, with a little bit of fiddle-faddling, to evaluate a business unit, a
particular product line, your managers, and so forth.
This is really neat if you think about it. You can use EVA analysis to break
down your business into different profit activities. By using EVA analysis to
look at the economic profit of these different profit activities, you can prob-
ably find those activities that should be emphasized because they produce
an economic profit, and you can identify those activities that should be dis-
continued (perhaps) because they don’t produce an economic profit. You
can also evaluate customers and managers in the same way.
If you want to do this more granular EVA analysis, work with a chart of
accounts that supports more detailed income statements and balance
sheets. In other words, if you’re going to break down your business into
two different business units, use a chart of accounts that lets you easily
see the income statement for each business unit. In a similar fashion,
use a chart of accounts for your balance sheet that lets you see the capi-
tal investment for both business units. Remember that any line item that
you want to appear on an income statement or balance sheet needs its
own account in the chart of accounts. Book II, Chapter 1 describes how to
create your QuickBooks Chart of Accounts. This chapter can also address
any questions that you may have about how to set up additional income
statement accounts and balance sheet accounts.
And Now a Word to My Critics
I may as well admit something here: Some people, I hope only a few, aren’t
going to like my simplistic approach to EVA.
The following are the points that I simplified, but you can take this informa-
tion and delve deeper into EVA analysis:

And Now a Word to My Critics
358
✦More work is involved in this process, per the textbook theory of EVA,
than what I’ve described here. In a perfect world, you should take the net
income number off the QuickBooks income statement and fiddle-faddle
with it so that you get a better, more accurate, more cash-flow-centric
measure of income.
✦Owner’s equity isn’t the world’s greatest measure of the fair market
value of the capital invested in a firm. It would be great if a firm could
follow the textbook approach described by the creators of EVA analysis
(Stern Stewart & Co.) and work with good estimates of the market values
of a firm’s equity and debt. But you know what? That’s a lot of work for
an often-modest increase in precision, especially if you are paying some
consultant the big bucks to come up with better market values for your
equity and debt.
✦My rough-and-tumble approach to the capital charge of the owner’s
equity (my suggestion that you simply use a range of values from 15 to
30 percent) is sort of financial heresy. M.B.A.s and Ph.D.s would proba-
bly be much more comfortable using something complicated, such as the
capital asset pricing model. Unfortunately, that’s a complicated statistical
model that, quite truthfully, scares me half to death. And yes, you proba-
bly could come up with a more precise rate of return percentage — if you
put in a lot more effort.
So, I’m guilty. I admit that I’ve made several simplifications to the EVA model.
Before the judge passes sentence, however, I want to suggest two extenuat-
ing circumstances that the judge should consider:
✦Small business EVA works differently from big business EVA. Remem-
ber that EVA is a tool to help managers think like shareholders. However,
in the case of a small business owner using QuickBooks, the manager
and the shareholder are one person. The dual role implies that this
person can more loosely apply the EVA model — and still get the bene-
fits of EVA-type thinking. Some of the machinations involved in very
sophisticated EVA analysis stem from the fact that management is inde-
pendent of shareholders. This is simply not the case with a $1,000,000
manufacturing business or a $10,000,000 distribution business.
✦Precision costs money. Employing someone who’s very sophisticated in
the wizardry of finance may not be worth the additional cost. Think
about the typical small business owner using QuickBooks as his or her
accounting tool. For example, a firm that produces $10,000 of EVA (as in
the examples used in this chapter) shouldn’t spend $10,000 or $20,000
on consultants to get a super-precise measure of income or the perfect
cost of capital measurement. In my opinion, a firm that produces
$100,000 in EVA also shouldn’t have this expenditure.
I rest my case and throw myself on the mercy of the court.

 Relating capital budgeting to QuickBooks
T
he challenge for any business is allocating capital, or money. Although
you have limited amounts of capital, your ideas and opportunities are
often unlimited.
Capital budgeting, in a nutshell, helps you to sift through all these ideas and
opportunities. Capital budgeting lets you answer questions like the follow-
ing: Should I replace that key piece of machinery that we use in the factory
or get a new delivery truck? Should we buy the building our offices are in?
Or should we purchase that competitor’s operation because it’s for sale?
Introducing the Theory of Capital Budgeting
Capital budgeting boils down to the idea that you should look at capital
investments (machinery, vehicles, real estate, entire businesses, yard art,
and so on) just as you look at the CDs (certificates of deposits) that a bank
offers.
Don’t worry — you actually already know how to do this. When you buy a
bank CD, you essentially look at one big thing and then a couple of small
things in order to decide whether a CD makes sense. The big thing is the
interest rate. The two small things are the CD maturity and the risk. In the
next couple of sections, I talk a bit about all three things because they apply
so neatly to the problem and challenge of capital budgeting.

Introducing the Theory of Capital Budgeting
360
The big thing is the return
The big thing, as I just mentioned, is the interest rate that a CD pays. You want
to earn the highest return possible on your money. Therefore, you want a CD
that pays a high interest rate! An 8 percent interest rate is better than a 6 per-
cent interest rate. And a 12 percent interest rate is way better than a 6 percent
interest rate.
You can also look at the interest rates earned on capital investments. Before
I go any further, though, you should know that interest rates don’t typically
go by that name in capital investing. For some strange reason, the interest
rate that a capital investment (like a piece of machinery, vehicle, or real
estate) earns is called a return on investment, or a rate of return. But it’s the
same thing. The rate of return or return on investment (or ROI) is really just
the interest rate that a capital investment or capital expenditure pays.
The return is important because it shows the profitability of the investment,
albeit as a percentage of the investment. The first thing that you need to
know about the theory of capital budgeting is that the big thing that matters
is the return.
One little thing is maturity
The first little thing that you also look at in the case of a certificate of deposit
is the maturity. The maturity simply refers to the amount of time that your
money gets tied up in the investment. For example, you may not want a one-
month CD. That short maturity means you have to roll over or reinvest the
CD at a new, perhaps lower, rate of return in a month. On the other hand, you
may also want to avoid tying up your money for a long period, such as 40
years. Tying up your money for a very long time period means that you won’t
be able to get to the money if a new, better opportunity comes along. You
probably see very few opportunities that are so good, so surefire, so long
term that they warrant tying up your money for decades and decades, right?
In the case of capital investments, you don’t actually use the word maturity
in most situations. Instead, you should use a term called liquidity, which
simply means how close an investment is to cash or how quickly an invest-
ment returns or pays back the cash that you’ve invested.
You can measure liquidity in a bunch of different ways. A little later in the
chapter, I talk about one simple approach to measuring liquidity — the pay-
back period. The key thing to remember about liquidity is this: Liquidity isn’t
as important as the return on investment. Remember, the return shows prof-
itability. Nevertheless, you do want to think about the liquidity of a capital

Book V
Chapter 3
Capital Budgeting 
in a Nutshell
Putting It All Together
361
investment. What you think depends on your circumstances. In different cir-
cumstances, you prefer capital investments with different degrees of liquidity.
Another little thing is risk
With CDs, government insurance programs such as the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (FDIC) reduce the risk of investing. But the risks still
matter, right? If you are over the limits of insurance coverage, you don’t put
all your money in the same bank. Even if you are under the FDIC insurance
limits, you don’t put money into a bank that is at risk of going under. Do that
and you’ll have the hassle of getting your money back.
Typically, you also carefully select CD-like investments, such as debentures,
which some finance companies offer to CD investors. Again, that makes
sense. Risk — the chance that maybe you won’t be repaid, or maybe not all
your interest will be repaid — is one of the things that you want to consider
when you talk about CDs.
In the same way that risk matters to CDs, risk matters to capital investments.
In fact, risk probably matters more in the latter case. No government agency
guarantees that some capital investment will deliver the returns that you
plan on. For this reason, you must consider the risk of capital investments.
You can consider risk both quantitatively (which means using measurements
that produce values that measure the risk) and qualitatively (which means
relying on your gut).
Putting It All Together
The bottom line is this: You actually already know the theory of capital 
budgeting — that it works like picking a CD down at the local bank. You want
to look at the profitability of the investment by somehow measuring the
return on the investment, or the interest rate. However, profitability isn’t the
only consideration. If you look at a capital expenditure, you also consider
the liquidity of the investment. Likewise, you also take into account the risk
of the investment.
Stated in a slightly different way, when you make capital investments, you
want to invest in things that pay the highest return. But you also want to rec-
ognize the importance of liquidity, not to mention the risk. You get the
theory, now, right?
The difference with capital budgeting, then, is that you (rather than the bank
issuing the CD) need to calculate the return, quantify or measure the liquidity,

Calculating the Rate of Return on Capital
362
and think carefully about the risks. That’s really it. You just do those three
additional things, which — surprise, surprise — I discuss next in this chapter.
Calculating the Rate of Return on Capital
I can tell you right up front that calculating the rate of return on a capital
investment is a little bit tricky. In almost every case, you need either a finan-
cial calculator (a good one) or a spreadsheet program, such as Microsoft
Excel. For the purpose of this discussion, I assume that you have (or have
access to) Microsoft Excel. If you don’t have Excel, you should still be able to
read through almost all the following discussion and then translate what I
talk about into the instructions that you need in order to use a financial cal-
culator or some other spreadsheet program. Note that the spreadsheet
mechanics that I describe aren’t very difficult.
If you aren’t all that comfortable with the notion of using Microsoft Excel —
even though it’s already installed on your computer — you may want to
think about getting a copy of Excel For Dummies, by Greg Harvey (Wiley
Publishing, Inc.). Just make sure you pick up the edition that talks about
your specific version of Excel. For example, if you’re running Excel 2003,
make sure that you get Excel 2003 For Dummies.
Calculating a rate of return on a capital expenditure requires three steps:
1. Calculate the investment amount.
2. Estimate the net cash flows paid by the investment.
3. Use either a financial calculator, such as one of those fancy Hewlett-
Packard calculators, or a spreadsheet program, such as Microsoft
Excel, to calculate the rate of return measure.
In the next sections, I explain each of these steps.
If you can, use a spreadsheet program rather than going the fancy-calculator
route — such calculators can be less than user-friendly. Twenty years ago,
when I was graduating with an M.B.A. in Finance from the University of
Washington, the joke among many young M.B.A.s was that the ability to cal-
culate the rate of return measures on a Hewlett-Packard 12C calculator was
worth $40,000 a year. The slogan, in fact, was “40G for a 12C.”
Calculate the investment amount
The first step in calculating a return is estimating the amount that you need
to invest. This is the amount that’s similar to the check you write to a bank
in order to buy a CD.

Book V
Chapter 3
Capital Budgeting 
in a Nutshell
Calculating the Rate of Return on Capital
363
For example, suppose that you are considering the purchase of a new office
building. Just to keep everything really simple, suppose that you can buy a
building that would house your offices for $350,000. Further suppose that
you can finance $300,000 of this purchase with a mortgage from your friendly
local bank. However, you also need to pay closing costs that equal $15,000.
Table 3-1 shows the initial investment that you must make in order to invest
in a new office building. The bottom line amount is $65,000. The table shows
how this amount gets calculated. The formula is pretty simple: The building
costs $350,000, and you must pay $15,000 in closing costs. That totals
$365,000. The bank, however, will finance $300,000 of this amount. This
means that you need to come up with $65,000 out of your own pocket.

Make sure that you understand why the initial investment, or the first check
that you need to write, is $65,000. This is the investment that you make in
the building.
Estimate the net cash flows
The process of estimating the net cash flows from the investment requires a
bit more work than the previous exercise did. Sit down and think carefully
about any additional revenues and any additional costs that the investment
produces. Obviously, you hope that the net effect of the investment will save
you cash. However, certain amounts of the investment will cost you. On the
other hand, you also receive savings that the investment returns.
You want to construct a little schedule — this can be written on the back of
a cocktail napkin or typed into a spreadsheet program like Excel — and use
it to carefully estimate and calculate cash flows.
Suppose, in the case of the office building, that the following two items
determine the net cash flows.
✦The new mortgage requires an annual $21,000 interest payment. To
keep things simple (don’t worry about principal amortization just yet),
suppose that this is an interest-only mortgage. Further suppose that you

Calculating the Rate of Return on Capital
364
need to pay the entire mortgage balance in 20 years as part of a balloon
payment. In the meantime, however, you’ll pay $21,000 at the end of
every year.
✦Because you own your own building, you save $20,000 in rent the first
year. This amount, however, increases every year. If the rent that you’ve
been paying has increased every year by 3 percent because of inflation,
you may want to assume that your rent savings, in order to be accu-
rately forecasted, should be inflated by 3 percent every year as well. For
example, you may want to assume that in the second year, your rent sav-
ings equal 103 percent of $20,000. In the third year, your rent savings
equal 103 percent of $20,600 (which is the second year’s rent savings).
Does this business of rent savings make sense? With capital expenditure
investment, the capital investment often saves you money in some way.
Therefore, you need to estimate those savings over the years that you will
use the capital investment. In this case, the rent savings should be equal to
the current rent savings plus inflation for each year. Another way to look at
the rent savings amount is to say that the rent savings equals the rent that
you won’t have to pay if you own the building.
Table 3-2 summarizes the cash flows that you enjoy by investing in this
building. The table has a column for each year number (the schedule shows
20 years of rent savings and mortgage payments). The schedule also
includes three columns, which report on the rent savings, the annual mort-
gage interest payment, and the net cash flow amount. The net cash flow
amount equals the rent savings minus the mortgage interest payment.
Notice that in the first two years, the mortgage interest payment exceeds the
rent savings. However, in year 3 and beyond, the rent savings exceeds the
mortgage payment.

Just to make sure you understand the information shown in Table 3-2, take a
peek at the information estimated for year 17. What does it mean? For year
17, the schedule shows that the rent savings equal $32,095. In other words,
this schedule estimates that in year 17 of building ownership, you save
$32,095 by owning the building. This is the amount that you are guessing you
would have had to pay in rent to a landlord had you not purchased the build-
ing. You also have to pay $21,000 in interest on that $300,000 mortgage in
year 17. The net savings that you accrue, which is the net cash flow in year
17, equals $11,095. This is simply the net amount left over from the rent sav-
ings after paying the mortgage interest.
I need to add one other important wrinkle to the information shown in Table
3-2. When you look at the cash flows that stem from a capital investment,
you need to make some assumption about what happens at the end of the
investment’s life. In the case of the building investment, for example, you
probably need to show that the mortgage is paid off. You also may want to
show the sale of the building at some point.
To show you how this works, suppose that at the end of year 20, you pay off
the mortgage (which will still be $300,000 because you have only been paying
interest) and suppose that you sell the building for $630,000 — this amount
is an estimate. To come up with this estimate, I took the original $350,000
purchase price and then annually inflated that amount by 3 percent over 20
years. Doing so produces an estimated sale price in year 20 of $630,000.
You’ll also pay selling costs that total $30,000.
Table 3-3 shows how these numbers produce a final, liquidation cash flow.
The gross sales price equals $630,000, as mentioned earlier. Then you have
to pay the $300,000 mortgage. Then you also have $30,000 of selling costs. 

Calculating the Rate of Return on Capital
366
If you subtract the mortgage and the selling costs from the gross sales price,
the final cash flow, then, equals $300,000. This makes sense, right? The gross
sales price of $630,000 minus $300,000 for the mortgage payment minus
$30,000 for selling costs equals $300,000.

The final step is to combine the information shown in Tables 3-2 and 3-3.
Table 3-4 does this. The net cash flows column summarizes the net cash flows
from Table 3-2. The liquidation cash flow column shows 0 during the first 19
years. Then in year 20, however, the liquidation cash flow shows as $300,000.
The real deal combines the net cash flows and the liquidation cash flow.

Just to make sure that you understand the real deal column’s numbers, I will
go into detail about a couple of them. Start by looking at year 5. For year 5,
the table shows a net cash flow of $1,511, no liquidation cash flow, and an
actual cash flow to you, the business owner, of $1,511. If this building weren’t
a building but was really a CD, this is the amount of interest that the CD
would pay you for year 5.
In year 20, things look a bit different. The net cash flow equals $14,072 when
you combine both the rent savings and the mortgage interest. The sale of
the building at the end of the year also produces a $300,000 cash flow. This is
actually the amount that you would receive from the escrow company after
the sale of the building closed. The net or final cash flow that you receive,
then, combines these two amounts: the $14,072 of net cash flow and the
$300,000 of liquidation cash flow. This cash flow is like the accrued interest
being paid back by the bank on a CD.
And now the hard part is done. You essentially turned your building invest-
ment into just another set of cash flows. These cash flows look to a financial
calculator or spreadsheet program like just another investment. In fact, these
cash flows could describe some crazy 20-year CD investment. In this case, of
course, they describe an imaginary building investment. But they could be
the cash flows from any investment — a new piece of machinery, a corporate
jet, or a new delivery truck.
Calculating the return
As I mention previously in this chapter, I’m going to show you the two basic
ways that you can calculate a return by using Microsoft Excel. (I use Excel
because it’s so ubiquitous.) You can, however, use another spreadsheet pro-
gram, such as Lotus 1-2-3, or any high-powered financial business calculator.
Basically, if you understand the logic of the stuff described here, you should
be able to translate what I say into Lotus-1-2-3-speak, or Hewlett-Packard-
Business-Calculator-speak.
In order to calculate a rate of return with Microsoft Excel, you first enter the
cash flows produced by the investment. In Figure 3-1, I’ve created a simple
Excel worksheet that does just this. Even if you’ve never used Excel before,
you may be able to construct this — all you have to do is start Excel (the
same way you start any other Windows program). Then you enter the cash
flows shown for the building investment. Actually, you only enter the values
shown in cells B2, B3, B4, B5, and so on, through cell B22. These values are
the cash flow numbers calculated and summarized in Table 3-4. (Flip back
and look at Table 3-4 if you don’t see this clearly.)
By the way, in case you are new to Excel, all you do to enter one of these
values is click the box (technically called a cell) and then type the value. For
example, to enter the initial investment required to buy the building —
$65,000 — you click the B2 cell and then type 65000. After you type this

Calculating the Rate of Return on Capital
368
number, press Enter. You enter each of the other net cash flow values in the
same manner in order to make the rate of return calculations.
I also put in values to label the years and then added a little bit of text in A1
and B1 to identify what the labels are. However, you don’t have to enter
those extraneous bits of information.
After you provide the cash flow values of the investment, you tell Excel the
rate of return that you want calculated. In Figure 3-1, I actually calculate two
rates of return. In Cell G4, for example, I calculate an internal rate of return.
An internal rate of return is the interest rate that the investment delivers. For
example, a CD that pays an 11 percent interest rate pays an 11 percent inter-
nal rate of return. To calculate an internal rate of return, you enter an inter-
nal rate of return function formula into a worksheet cell. In the case of the
worksheet shown in Figure 3-1, for example, you click cell G4 and then type
the following:
=IRR(B2:B22)
Figure 3-1:

Chapter 3
Capital Budgeting

Calculating the Rate of Return on Capital
369
If you’ve never seen an Excel function before, this probably looks like Greek.
But all this function does is tell Excel to calculate the internal rate of return
for the cash flows stored in the range, or block of cells, that goes from cell 
B2 to cell B22. The office building cash flows, it turns out, produce an inter-
nal rate of return equal to 11 percent. This means that, essentially, the office
building delivers an 11 percent interest rate annually on the amounts
invested in the office building.
Some problems with the IRR measurement
I kind of like the internal rate of return (IRR)
measurement because it makes a lot of intuitive
sense. Capital budgeting is burdensome
enough without being weighed down further by
some tricky, abstract, theoretical capital budg-
eting tool such as the net present value.
You should know, however, that the internal
rate of return has some practical weaknesses,
which is why people with M.B.A.s and Ph.D.s in
business and finance greatly prefer the net
present value measure. In this sidebar, I iden-
tify these weaknesses for you. Knowing about
the weaknesses enables you to more safely
use the IRR tool. On the other hand, knowing
about the weaknesses may also make you
choose to just bear with the abstractness of the
net present value model and use it instead.
Anyway, here are the weaknesses:
 The IRR measure doesn’t always identify
the best investment. In other words, you
sometimes can’t pick the investment with
the highest IRR and get the most profitable
investment. As an extreme example of this,
suppose that you have $100,000 to invest.
Would you rather invest only $10,000 of
your money in something earning 20 percent
annually or look at something earning 18 per-
cent annually but in which you can invest
the entire $100,000? Do you see the differ-
ence? Twenty percent of $10,000 isn’t going
to be as good as 18 percent of $100,000.
Unfortunately, the IRR measure — by
focusing on the percentage return —
sometimes causes people to lose sight of
the dollars of profit, which is obviously
what you really want to maximize. In com-
parison, the net present value does calcu-
late a straight dollar profit amount. By pick-
ing an investment with the highest net
present value, you’re picking the invest-
ment that delivers the most dollars and
profits.
 The IRR measure doesn’t recognize rein-
vestment risk very well. This sounds like
another mumble-jumble problem, but it’s
actually a pretty important one. For exam-
ple, suppose that you have a million dollars
to invest. Would you rather pick a 1-year
investment (Option A) that earns 30 percent
or a 20-year investment (Option B) that
earns 20 percent? At first blush, a 30 per-
cent investment seems like a pretty good
one. Obviously, 30 percent is a lot more
than 20 percent. However, here’s what you
have to consider: Where are you going to
invest the money from Option A one year
(continued)

Calculating the Rate of Return on Capital
370
Another common rate of return measure is something called a net present
value, which essentially specifies by what dollar amount the rate of return
on a business exceeds a benchmark rate of return. For example, the work-
sheet shown in Figure 3-1 shows the net present value equal to $9,821.71. In
other words, this investment exceeds a benchmark rate of return by $9,821.71.
You can’t see it — it’s buried in the formula — but the benchmark rate of
return equals 10 percent. So, this rate of return essentially is $9,821.71 better
than a 10 percent rate of return.
To calculate the net present value by using Excel, you use another function.
In the case of the worksheet shown in Figure 3-1, for example, you click cell
G6 and type the following formula:
=NPV(0.1,B3:B22)+B2
from now when that investment liquidates?
The key is that you have to be able to invest
the 1.3 million dollars (this is what you get
from Option A one year from now) in some-
thing that beats the Option B investment. In
other words, you have to think about that
reinvestment risk for your investments. The
IRR doesn’t really do this. In comparison,
the net present value does. Implicitly, the
net present value assumes that you can
reinvest money at the discount rate used in
the calculation. In essence, the discount
rate is the going rate that you can earn on
your other capital investments, so it auto-
matically factors in reinvestment.
 The IRR measure doesn’t always produce
a solution (that is, a unique solution). The
IRR formula isn’t solvable, for example,
when the cash flows don’t really look 
like investment cash flows. If you have 
an investment that only generates cash
because there is no initial cash outlay, you
can’t calculate an internal rate of return.
But such an investment, obviously, is a very
good deal and should be selected. Another
related problem is that sometimes the IRR
formula can’t be uniquely solved. This busi-
ness about no unique solution stems from
a little bit of mathematical weirdness. (The
problem is that technically, an IRR formula
is an nth root polynomial equation with up
to nth possible solutions!) This multiple
solutions weirdness pops up when you
have the cash flow signs changing over the
years that the investment is held. In the
case of the office building investment, only
one sign change exists. In year 2, the cash
flow is negative. And in year 3, the cash
flow becomes positive and stays positive.
This means that the building has only one
single internal rate of return. If in some
years, the cash flow were positive and in
some years, the cash flow were negative,
however, each of these flips from negative
to positive cash value or vice versa indi-
cates another solution to the IRR formula. I
won’t go into any more detail, but the
important point is that, using the net pres-
ent value formula, you always know that a
solution exists and that it is the single unique
solution, given a particular discount rate.
(continued)

Measuring Liquidity
371
This formula looks at the cash flows for years 1 through 20, discounts these
cash flows by using a 10 percent rate of return, and then compares these dis-
counted cash flows with the initial investment amount, which is the value
stored in cell B2.
This all may sound a bit tricky, but essentially, this is what’s going on: The
net present value formula looks at the cash flows stored in the worksheet
and calculates the present value amount by which these cash flows exceed a
10 percent rate of return.
The discount rate equals the rate of return that you expect on your capital
investments. I should also note that the discount rate is the rate at which
you can reinvest any money you get from the capital investment’s cash flows.
One final comment about the information shown in Figure 3-1 (this is also
true of the information from Table 3-4): In this figure, I’ve described how to
calculate pre-tax cash flows and, therefore, how to calculate a pre-tax rate of
return measure. In some situations, however, you may want to calculate an
after-tax set of cash flows and an after-tax rate of return. If taxes are a signifi-
cant factor and if you are considering alternative capital investments that
deliver different tax benefits, you can get more precise and sometimes differ-
ent results by looking at after-tax cash flows and after-tax rates of return. If
you do want to look at after-tax cash flows and profitability measures, you
probably need the help of your tax advisor.
An important thing to know about pre-tax cash flows and returns versus
after-tax cash flows and returns: Make sure that you’re using apples-to-apples
comparisons. It’s often fine to work with pre-tax cash flows; just make sure
that you’re comparing pre-tax cash flows with other pre-tax cash flows. You
don’t want to compare pre-tax returns with after-tax returns. That’s an
apples-to-oranges comparison. Predictably, it doesn’t work.
Measuring Liquidity
In large businesses, people don’t worry or talk as much about liquidity — at
least when it comes to capital investments. Liquidity as a criterion for look-
ing at capital investments is downplayed. The logic behind this is that, in most
cases, very large firms have almost unlimited access to capital through the
capital markets (either the stock markets, the debt markets, or even just big-
time borrowing from enormous banks). For many smaller businesses, how-
ever, liquidity is important. You have only a limited number of investments
that you can make. Additionally, you have a limited amount of capital — less
than you like, almost always. New opportunities and ways to invest your
money continually arrive. For these reasons, you typically want to look at
the liquidity of your capital investments.

Thinking about Risk
372
One easy way to measure liquidity is with a payback period, which measures
what it takes for an investment to pay back its original investment. The office
building example doesn’t work very well for this sort of calculation, so to
make things a little easier, suppose that you are considering a $10,000 invest-
ment that produces $2,000 a year in net cash flows. In this case, you can cal-
culate the payback period with the following formula:
Payback period = initial investment/annual cash flow
In the case of the $10,000 investment described here, the actual formula is
$10,000/$2,000 = 5
This means that the $10,000 investment, through its $2,000 per year cash
flows, takes five years to pay back.
Again, you don’t want to focus on liquidity. Liquidity is almost never as
important as profitability. But even though profitability is paramount, liquid-
ity is often something that you want to consider. At times, you are going to
want investments that pay back more quickly rather than those that pay
back less quickly. When the investments do pay off, you’ll have other good
reinvestment opportunities.
Thinking about Risk
Obviously, risk matters. Risk is an issue even with simple investments like
bank CDs. But with capital investments, no government agency is looking
out for your interest and picking up the pieces if things do a Humpty Dumpty
and come crashing down.
So think for a minute about risk management and assessment in the case of
capital expenditures. Here are three important comments that I can share:
✦Be very careful and thoughtful in coming up with cash flows. The
better job that you do thinking about and estimating the cash flows from
a capital expenditure, the more reliable and useful your results are.
Good cash flow estimates produce good rate of return measurements.
Look back to the examples shown in Tables 3-1, 3-2, 3-3, and 3-4.
✦Experiment. You absolutely need to experiment with your assumptions.
Make changes and see how those changes impact both the cash flow
and rate of return measurements. Looking back at the cash flow informa-
tion shown in Tables 3-3 and 3-4, for example, you can see that the single
biggest cash flow in the building investment is the resale amount in year
20. It would be very interesting to see what effect a lower inflation, or

373
appreciation, rate has on the ultimate rate of return. A 2 percent inflation
rate would dramatically change the cash flows and the rate of return
measurement for this investment. Similarly, an inflation rate of 5 percent
or 6 percent over those 20 years would also dramatically change things.
In the former case, things get ugly, quickly. In the latter case, well, we all
remember how good a leveraged real estate investment can be when
given high, continued inflation rates, right?
✦Think about the discount rate that you use. I didn’t spend a lot of time
talking about the discount rate, but it should implicitly take into consid-
eration the risk that an investment makes you face. My finance professor
always said, “Your discount rate should equal the rate of return that sim-
ilarly risky investments produce.” There is tremendous wisdom in this
simple guideline. (Thanks, Professor Schall!) In other words, if you’re
looking at a very risky investment, that investment should be compared
with the hoped-for higher rates of return that other similarly risky invest-
ments deliver. You would never pick an investment that, given its risk
level, delivers an inferior rate of return. At the same time, if you’re look-
ing at lower risk investments, you want to use a lower discount rate. A
relatively low risk investment in something like an office building, for
example, shouldn’t be evaluated with a discount rate that’s maybe appro-
priate to some super-risky investment in some new bit of leading-edge
technology. Another related point is that maybe you want to try some
different discount rates. By experimenting not only with your cash flow
numbers but also with your discount rates, you can see how the quality
of an investment changes when you use different discount rates (and
implicitly make different assumptions about the investment’s risk).
What Does All This Have to Do with QuickBooks?
So here’s a question: What does all this capital budgeting stuff have to do
with QuickBooks?
Well, quite honestly, capital budgeting doesn’t really directly relate to using
QuickBooks. In some ways, capital budgeting is about a financial manage-
ment task that is critically important and that you need to think about . . .
but a task that QuickBooks doesn’t directly support.
That said, do note that much of the data that you’ve collected with QuickBooks
is often extremely useful in getting good estimates of the savings and costs
associated with some capital expenditure.
In looking at the example of investing in an office building, for example,
knowing what you have been paying in rent and what you may be able to
save by buying your own building is exactly the sort of information that you

What Does All This Have to Do with QuickBooks?
374
need — and exactly the sort of information that the rich financial database
of QuickBooks supplies. In truth, your estimates of cash flows will typically
be much more involved than what I’ve shown in this chapter. If you do have
a building investment under consideration, you should consider all sorts of
expenses related to repairing and maintaining the building. If you’ve been
leasing space in someone else’s building, you have to consider all sorts of
expenses associated with that, including special insurance that the landlord
makes you buy, special amounts that you spend because the space doesn’t
quite meet your requirements, and so on. QuickBooks helps you with this
type of information.

rofit-volume-cost analysis is a powerful tool that estimates how a 
business’s profits change as the sales volumes change as well as
breakeven points. (A breakeven point is the sales revenue level that pro-
duces zero profits.)
Profit-volume-cost analysis often produces surprising results. Typically, the
analysis shows that small changes in a business’s sales volume produce big
changes in profits.
Hotels and airlines are types of businesses that often see surprising fluctua-
tions in their profits based on relatively modest changes in their sales revenue.
Indeed, now that you know this, you’ll probably notice that investment ana-
lysts often use small changes in hotel occupancy and in airline load factors
(the percentage of seats filled on a plane) to explain big changes in profits.
The first part of this chapter talks about the theory of profit-volume-cost
analysis. Understanding the theory may be all you need in order to apply
this tool to your specific setting. At the end of the chapter, I describe an
Excel workbook that you can use for more sophisticated profit-volume-cost
analysis. That workbook is available to download from my Web site at
www.stephenlnelson.com/pvc.xls. (You can also visit my Web site;

How Profit-Volume-Cost Analysis Works

How Profit-Volume-Cost Analysis Works
Profit-volume-cost analysis uses three pieces of information to show how
your profits change as sales revenues change: estimates of your sales rev-
enue, your gross margin percentage, and your fixed costs. Usually, all three
items of data are easy to come by.
For example, suppose that you are a builder of high-end racing sailboats that
sell for $100,000 each. Further suppose that each boat costs you $40,000 in
labor and material and that your shop costs $160,000 a year to keep open.
You can calculate your gross margin percentage by using the following formula:
(boat sales price – direct labor and material costs) ÷ (boat
sales cost)
Or you can use the actual numbers from my example:
($100,000 – $40,000) ÷ ($100,000)
This formula returns the result 0.6, or 60 percent. In this case, your fixed
cost amount equals $160,000.
With the fixed cost and gross margin percentage information, you can calcu-
late the profits that different sales revenues produce. To make this calcula-
tion, you use the following formula:
profits = (sales × gross margin percentage) – fixed cost
Table 1-1 shows some examples of how you can use this formula to estimate
the profits at different sales volume levels. At $200,000 in annual sales, for
example, the business suffers a $40,000 loss. At $300,000 in sales, the busi-
ness earns a $20,000 profit. At $400,000 in sales, the business earns an
$80,000 profit. Table 1-1 also shows the formula used to estimate profits.

($400,000 × 0.60) – $160,000
$80,000; a nice profit
The really interesting thing about the information shown in Table 1-1 — and 
I don’t want to beat a dead horse here — is that profits often change more
significantly than revenues change. Look at Table 1-1 and examine what 

Book VI

happens when revenues increase from $300,000 to $400,000 — roughly a 33
percent increase. You see that profits quadruple from $20,000 to $80,000.
Here’s another way to look at the estimated profits at the $300,000 and
$400,000 sales levels: If sales drop by 25 percent from $400,000 to $300,000,
profits decrease by 75 percent from $80,000 to $20,000.
Table 1-1 illustrates a common experience of businesses. Relatively modest
changes in sales revenue produce large — sometimes stunningly large —
changes in profits. The reason that you perform profit-volume-cost analysis,
therefore, is to understand how sensitive your business profits are to changes
in sales volume. With this information, you can understand how important 
it is to prevent decreases in sales, and you can reap the rewards of increas-
ing sales.
I need to make one final point about the information shown in Table 1-1: You
can calculate this same information, almost in a longhand fashion, by using
miniature income statements. Table 1-2, for example, shows some miniature
income statements that calculate profits at various sales levels.

It’s no coincidence that the miniature income statements shown in Table 1-2
produce the same estimates of profit as the formulas shown in Table 1-1. The
difference — and the advantage of the approach to information illustrated in
Table 1-1 — is that the formula makes it possible to quickly calculate esti-
mates of profits at any sales level. Constructing even a miniature income
statement like the one shown in Table 1-2 is typically more work than using
the approach shown in Table 1-1.
Calculating Breakeven Points
Here’s another important piece of information that belongs between your
ears: A common application of the formula used in Table 1-1 is to calculate a
breakeven point. A breakeven point, as noted previously, shows the sales
revenue volume that produces zero profit and zero loss.

Calculating Breakeven Points
380
Remember the formula for performing profit-volume-cost analysis? It goes
like this:
profits = (sales revenue × gross margin percentage) – fixed
costs
Rather than calculate profits based on the other three variables (sales rev-
enue, gross margin percentage, and fixed costs), you can calculate a sales
revenue amount based on the other three variables (profits, gross margin
percentage, and fixed costs).
The formula for making such a breakeven calculation, based on algebraic
manipulation of the profit-volume-cost analysis formula, looks like this:
breakeven point (in sales revenue) = fixed costs ÷ gross
margin percentage
To calculate the breakeven point in sales revenue for the example boat-building
business, you make the following calculation:
$160,000 ÷ 40 percent
Confused about the breakeven point formula?
The formula for calculating the breakeven point
seems pretty different from the formula for cal-
culating profit-volume-cost information — or at
least it does at first blush. However, the second
formula is derived from the first. Because some
compulsive readers may want to know how this
variation works, I show it to you in this section.
Here’s the fixed base formula:
profits = (sales revenue ×
gross margin percentage) –
fixed costs
If I subtract the fixed costs from both sides of
the formula, I get the following:
profits – fixed costs = sales
revenue × gross margin per-
centage
Because profits equal zero at the breakeven
point, I can simplify this formula further by just
scratching out the profits variable, as shown
here:
–fixed costs = sales revenue ×
gross margin percentage
If I divide both sides of the equation by the
gross margin percentage, I get the basic
breakeven point formula, as shown here:
–fixed costs × gross margin
percentage = sales revenue
And that’s the way the formula gets created.
Essentially, all you have to do is divide the fixed
costs amount by the gross margin percentage.
The result shows the sales revenue at which a
firm breaks even.

Chapter 1

which produces the result:
$266,667
Accordingly, the boat-building business needs $266,667 of revenue to 
break even.
The breakeven point formula described in the preceding paragraphs estimates
a breakeven point in revenue. However, such a revenue-based breakeven
point often doesn’t make complete sense. For example, in the case of the
boat-building business in which you sell boats for $100,000 each, there’s no
practical way to get $266,667 of revenue. You can’t sell two-thirds of a boat.
The correct way to interpret a breakeven point in revenue in this example,
then, is to interpret it as a rough breakeven point. As a practical matter in
the boat-building business, the breakeven point is slightly less than three
boats per year.
If, in this example, you were working with boats that cost $1,000 each or $100
each, the precision of the breakeven point would be much greater. For exam-
ple, if you manufactured day sailor boats that were $1,000 apiece, you would
know that the breakeven point is somewhere between 266 and 267 boats
(calculated by dividing the $266,667 of revenue by $1,000). If the boats cost
$100 each — perhaps they are model boats — you know that the breakeven
point is between 2,666 model boats and 2,667 model boats (calculated by
dividing the revenue amount by $100).
In either case, you see that the smaller the revenue per unit, the more preci-
sion you get in the breakeven point in units.
You can also see from this example that the process of converting a
breakeven point in revenue to a breakeven point in units is simply a matter
of dividing the breakeven point in revenue by the unit price.
Using Real QuickBooks Data for 
Profit-Volume-Cost Analysis
As noted previously, you need three items of data in order to perform profit-
volume-cost analysis: sales revenue, gross margin percentage, and fixed
cost. Typically, these items of data aren’t difficult to find if you have been
using QuickBooks. Nevertheless, this data doesn’t map perfectly to line
items that appear on a QuickBooks income statement. For this reason, I
briefly discuss how you come up with these pieces of information.

Using Real QuickBooks Data for Profit-Volume-Cost Analysis
382
Sales revenue
The sales revenue levels that you use in the formula are the sales revenue
levels that you want to experiment with. They probably represent possible or
maybe even likely sales revenue levels for your business. Accordingly, the sales
revenue levels don’t really come from QuickBooks. Of course, you may want
to look at past income statements in order to determine reasonable or likely
sales revenue levels. However, the formula inputs are probably just rough
estimates; they don’t actually come from a QuickBooks income statement.
Gross margin percentage
The gross margin percentage, as illustrated previously, is calculated by sub-
tracting your variable costs from your sales revenue and then by dividing
that result (which is the gross margin) by the sales revenue. The variable
costs include the costs of the items that you sell: inventory, commissions,
shipping, and similar costs.
Because calculating the gross margin percentage can be a little bit confusing
the first few times you use it, here are a couple of examples to review:
✦If you sell $100,000 boats, but the material, labor, and commission
expenses for those boats total $40,000, you can calculate the gross
margin percentage by using the formula: ($100,000 – $40,000) ÷ $100,000.
That formula returns 0.6, or 60 percent, which is the gross margin per-
centage of the boat-building business.
✦For another example, assume that you are running a personal service
business in which you prepare tax returns for a living. Further assume
that you charge $200 for a small business tax return and that the only
variable cost is a $40 fee that you have to pay to the tax software com-
pany for the return. In this case, you calculate the gross margin percent-
age by using the formula ($200 – $40) ÷ $200. This formula returns the
value 0.8, or 80 percent. In this case, 80 percent is the gross margin per-
centage for your tax return preparation business.
The key point is that variable costs vary with the sales revenue. If a sale
occurs, the sale produces variable costs. If no sale occurs, no variable costs
are incurred.
So what does all this mean? Well, typically, the variable costs equal the cost
of goods sold number that’s shown on your QuickBooks income statement.
This cost of goods sold number probably includes the inventory items that
you sell (if you are in a business in which you resell inventory) and other
items, such as freight and sales commissions. You can, therefore, get most or
all the variable cost information right off the QuickBooks income statement.

Book VI
Chapter 1
Profit-Volume-Cost
Analysis
The Downside of the Profit-Volume-Cost Model
383
You may need to fiddle with the cost of goods sold amount reported on the
QuickBooks income statement. Remember that variable costs are those
costs that vary with sales, and, as a result, some of the costs that you’ve
included in the cost of goods sold section of your income statement may not
be variable. Some of the costs reported in the regular operating expenses
portion of your income statement are actually variable.
Therefore, you may want to think about the costs reported in the cost of
goods sold section and in the operating expenses section of your income
statement. If you realize that the cost of goods sold value isn’t a good esti-
mate of variable costs, make some adjustments. A fixed cost that’s included
in the cost of goods sold number should be subtracted, obviously. And a
variable cost that is included with the other operating expenses may need to
be added to the cost of goods sold.
Fixed costs
Fixed costs include all your other non-variable costs. In a nutshell, fixed
costs are fixed because they don’t change with sales volume. Fixed costs
include items such as rent paid on an office or factory, salaries paid to per-
manent employees, overhead for insurance, and so forth.
To see how fixed costs work and get calculated, return to the examples of
the boat-building business and the tax return preparation service:
✦In the boat-building business, the firm carries an overhead of over
$160,000. This amount may include $80,000 for the shop in which you
build your boats and $80,000 for the salaries that you pay to two crafts-
men whom you continue to employ whether or not you have boats to
build. In this case, then, these overhead costs constitute your $160,000
of fixed costs. These fixed costs don’t change based on changes in sales
volume.
✦In the tax return service, your only fixed expenses are $100 a month for
Yellow Pages advertisements and $700 a month to rent a small office. In
this case, then, your fixed costs equal $800 a month. Again, these fixed
costs don’t change based on changes in sales volume.
The Downside of the Profit-Volume-Cost Model
Okay, this stuff all sounds fine and good, but what happens when little reser-
vations start to pop up? Annoying little problems? Minor weaknesses that
turn into irritations?

The Downside of the Profit-Volume-Cost Model
384
Here’s the problem: Like any abstract explanation of reality, the profit-
volume-cost model isn’t perfect. If you want to get nit-picky — and you
should for a moment — several practical problems creep into the calcula-
tions of the profit-volume-cost formula and its application to your real-life
business affairs. I discuss these problems in the following list, but I don’t
think that having such problems means that you shouldn’t use the model.
They only change the way that you work with the model.
✦Any assumptions that you make about variable costs and fixed costs
typically apply only over a range of sales revenues. In the boat-building
business, for example, the numbers used in the preceding sections don’t
apply if the boat builder scales up and builds 500 boats a year. That’s
obvious, right? It may be that the range of sales revenues valid for a 60
percent gross margin percentage — and therefore, $160,000 of fixed
costs — are really somewhere between zero boats per year and eight
boats per year. Move to a sales revenue level above eight boats a year
and, very likely, either the gross margin percentage or the fixed cost
amount changes.
✦In the super-long run, as a practical matter, there is no such thing as a
fixed cost. Essentially, every cost is variable. In the boat-building busi-
ness, for example, you could — in the long run — lay off two craftsmen
and move to a smaller shop. Perhaps you could even build boats in your
back yard. Fixed costs, in other words, are fixed only for a particular
period of time. If you move beyond that period of time, the fixed costs
are no longer fixed. This seems like an obvious point, but it is important
to recognize.
✦In the super-short term, there is no such thing as a variable cost. (Or
at least there aren’t very many variable costs.) For example, in the boat-
building business, even if you pay your laborers an hourly wage for
building the boats, you probably can’t send the laborers home early 
just because work for the day is done. You can’t tell your laborers at the
end of Tuesday not to come in for Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday just
because you have no work for them. Other variable costs may work the
same way — not always, but sometimes. In any case, recognize that
some costs may vary over a month or year but not over a day or a week.
In other words, in the super-short term, variable costs often aren’t very
variable.
The three preceding conundrums indicate that profit-volume-cost analysis
suffers from some limits. You can’t use a gross margin percentage and a 
fixed cost amount for just any sales revenue estimates — you use those two
items of data for a carefully considered range of sales revenue volumes.
Furthermore, you can’t use profit-volume-cost analysis for super-short time

385
frames. Variable costs in that case aren’t really variable. And you can’t use
profit-volume-cost analysis for super-long time frames because in the long
run, no fixed cost stays fixed.
To generalize, the profit-volume-cost analysis tool provides rough measure-
ments. These rough measurements can be very useful to you, but they are
still really just rough measurements. Always apply common sense when
using profit-volume-cost analysis.
Maybe it’s only a little game I play with myself, but sometimes I don’t think
about fixed costs and variable costs. Instead, I think about sort-of fixed costs
and sort-of variable costs. By admitting up front that the fixed costs are not
always solidly fixed and that the variable costs are not always solidly vari-
able, I find myself more comfortable with the profit-volume-cost analysis for-
mula. I remind myself that the model isn’t perfect but only a rough tool to
estimate profit and breakeven points.
Using the Profit-Volume-Cost Analysis Workbook
I’ve created a Profit-Volume-Cost Analysis workbook for those readers who
want to perform more sophisticated profit-volume-cost analysis. This work-
book is available on my Web site at www.stephenlnelson.com/pvc.xls.
The Profit-Volume-Cost Analysis workbook enables you to estimate profits at
a variety of sales revenue volumes, to estimate breakeven points, and to chart
breakeven and profit-volume-cost data. Some of the calculations are a little
bit cumbersome, but almost every calculation is simply an extension of what
has already been discussed in the preceding paragraphs of this chapter.
In the remaining pages of this chapter, I describe how to use the Profit-
Volume-Cost Analysis workbook and how to understand and interpret both
the breakeven analysis and the profit-volume-cost analysis performed by the
workbook I also share a few words about the charts that graphically depict
the profit-volume-cost analysis results.
Collecting your inputs
Figure 1-1 shows the worksheet range into which you enter the raw data
required for the profit-volume-cost analysis. The workbook collects more
data points than you may expect. Most of this information, however, is
simply a slightly more granular approach to collecting the three basic inputs
that any profit-volume-cost analysis depends upon: sales revenue estimates,
gross margin percentage, and fixed costs.

Using the Profit-Volume-Cost Analysis Workbook

You don’t need to be an Excel expert to use the Profit-Volume-Cost Analysis
workbook described in this chapter. However, you do need to know how to
start and stop Excel and how to enter values into worksheet cells. If you don’t
possess these Excel skills, you may want to consider buying and reading
Excel For Dummies by Greg Harvey, also published by Wiley Publishing, Inc.
To use the Profit-Volume-Cost Analysis workbook, follow these steps:
1. Open the Profit-Volume-Cost Analysis workbook.
a. Point your browser to www.stephenlnelson.com/pvc.xls.
b. When your browser asks whether you want to open the file or save
the file, indicate that you want to save the file to your hard drive.
c. Open the file by starting Microsoft Excel and choosing the File
menu’s Open command.
d. When Excel displays the Open dialog box, open the folder with the
pvc.xls file and then double-click the file.
2. Describe the sales revenue that you want to test.
To do this, you must provide three pieces of information: the unit sales
price, the low unit sales volume, and the high unit sales volume.
Figure 1-1:

the Profit-
Volume-
Cost

workbook.

Analysis
Using the Profit-Volume-Cost Analysis Workbook

Enter the unit sales price into cell B4. For example, if you sell an item
that costs $1,500, you enter $1,500 into cell B4. Use the low unit volume
tested and high unit volume tested inputs shown in cells B5 and B6
(respectively) to identify the range of sales volumes that you want to
test. The low unit volume tested value multiplied by the unit sales price
equals the lowest revenue volume that the worksheet tests. The high
unit volume tested multiplied by the unit sales price amount equals the
largest sales revenue volume tested.
The three revenue inputs that you collect and input into cells B4, B5,
and B6 tell the workbook which sales revenue volumes that you want to
analyze.
If you wanted to use the Profit-Volume-Cost Analysis workbook to test
sales volumes for the boat-building business that I describe earlier in 
the chapter, the unit sales price would equal $100,000, so the low unit
volume tested may equal 2, and the high unit volume may equal 5. These
inputs, then, would test sales volumes of between $100,000 and
$500,000, based on a $100,000 price for a boat.
3. Describe the variable costs.
When you do real-life profit-volume-cost analysis, you find that your 
variable costs fall into one of two categories: variable costs that can be
expressed as an amount per unit, and variable costs that can be expressed
as a percentage of the sales price. The worksheet range B10:B17 collects
the information needed to describe these sorts of variable costs.
The first set of variable costs, which I call vary-with-unit costs, go into
cells B10, B11, B12, and B13. For example, any direct labor costs associ-
ated with the item that you’re selling go into cell B10. Direct material
costs go into B11. Factory overhead costs, which are variable and based
on units sold, go into cell B12. If you have any other vary-with-unit costs,
you enter the amount per unit for these costs into cell B13.
The example vary-with-unit cost values shown in Figure 1-1 mean that
for each unit sold, the assumption is that the business pays $75 per unit
in direct labor, $40 per unit in direct materials, $400 per unit in factory
overhead, and another $40 per unit for other vary-with-unit costs. If you
add up these amounts, you see that vary-with-unit costs equal $555 per
unit sold.
In addition to vary-with-unit costs, firms also often pay variable costs that
are best expressed as a percentage of the revenue. In the Profit-Volume-
Cost Analysis workbook, the worksheet range B15:B17 supplies space to
describe and record these variable costs, which I call vary-with-revenue
costs. The workbook, for example, shows a 5 percent sales commission
in cell B15. The workbook shows an 8 percent sales tax in cell B16. And
just to provide a catchall category for other vary-with-revenue costs, the
workbook includes (and I show for purposes of this example) another
vary-with-revenue costs value in cell B17.

Using the Profit-Volume-Cost Analysis Workbook
388
In the case of the sample data set shown in Figure 1-1, for example, vary-
with-revenue costs equal 14.5 percent of sales.
4. Record your fixed costs.
To record or estimate your fixed costs, enter the fixed costs amount into
cell B19. In Figure 1-1, for example, fixed costs show as $150,000.
5. Estimate any variable costs that vary with profits.
Here’s one other wrinkle that you may often encounter with real-life
profit-volume-cost analysis: variable costs that don’t vary from changes
in sales revenue but from changes in profits. For example, some busi-
nesses have profit-sharing plans. Those profits represent variable costs
because they vary with changes in sales revenue — sort of. In order to
estimate the profit-sharing costs, you really need to first calculate profits
and then apply the profit-sharing percentage to those profits. Income
taxes — federal, state, and local income taxes — also fall into the cate-
gory of variable costs that don’t vary with changes in sales revenue but
with changes in profit.
In the workbook shown in Figure 1-1, I’ve provided three cells, B22, B23,
and B24, that let you recognize these variable costs. I call this category
of variable costs vary-with-profit costs. You can enter the state income
tax percentage into cell B22. You can enter the federal income tax per-
centage into cell B23. And if you have any other vary-with-profit costs,
you can enter the sum of these costs as a percentage into cell B24.
I should tell you that vary-with-profit costs are tricky to estimate pre-
cisely. The trickiness stems from a couple of factors:
• Many vary-with-profit costs aren’t simply calculated as percentages
of profit. The cost calculations are considerably more complicated.
Income tax costs, for example, don’t use a single percentage. They
often use a schedule of progressive percentages.
• Vary-with-profit costs often interrelate. For example, state income
taxes affect federal income taxes. Other vary-with-profit costs may
interrelate, too. For example, a profit-sharing percentage may be
applied on an after-tax basis. The workbook formulas don’t explicitly
recognize any interrelationship between these variables. Therefore,
in order to precisely model these vary-with-profit costs, you must enter
percentages that have been fiddled with a bit, as described in the side-
bar elsewhere in this chapter, “Dealing with vary-with-profit costs.”
After you collect the needed inputs for the Profit-Volume-Cost Analysis
workbook, the workbook estimates a breakeven point and prepares a
profit volume forecast. The workbook also supplies a couple of useful
charts that graphically show the breakeven and the profit-volume analy-
sis data. The next paragraphs of this chapter describe these analysis
results.

Understanding the breakeven analysis
The breakeven analysis that the workbook makes based on the inputs that
you enter is shown in Figure 1-2. The breakeven analysis shows the number
of units required to break even in cell G3 and the sales revenue required to
break even in cell G4. You calculate the total sales revenue required to break
even by using the same basic formula described earlier in the chapter. You
calculate the volume in units breakeven point by dividing the sales revenue
breakeven point by the unit sales price.
The variable costs portion of the breakeven analysis shows the amount
spent on each of the costs. Cell G7 shows the amount that will be spent on
direct labor.
The contribution margin, which is the same thing as gross margin, appears
in cell G15. This shows the amount left over from sales revenue after paying
the variable costs.
A fixed cost appears in cell G17. By subtracting the fixed costs from the con-
tribution margin, the workbook calculates the breakeven point, which
should be zero but may not be because of a rounding error. In Figure 1-2, for
example, the profit before vary-with-profit costs value equals –$135.
Figure 1-2:

Although the information shown in Figure 1-2 may seem voluminous, you
conceptually understand all this data. A little forecast worksheet simply
shows the sales revenue and the sales units that produce the breakeven
point. This worksheet also shows the amounts that you’ll spend on variable
costs and fixed costs. Profits equal zero at the breakeven point, so there
aren’t any vary-with-profit costs.
Understanding the profit-volume-cost forecast
Figure 1-3 shows the miniature income statement at various sales volume
levels. Figure 1-4 shows the same information presented not in dollars but in
percentages of total sales.
The Profit Volume Forecast worksheet in Figure 1-3 shows the range of sales
volume both in revenues and in units that the worksheet calculates. The
lowest sales revenue volume and the highest sales revenue volume are set
by your input for the low unit volume tested value and the high unit volume
tested value. (See the numbers entered into cells B5 and B6 of Figure 1-1.)

The miniature income statements in the Profit Volume Forecast look very
similar to a typical QuickBooks income statement. The variable costs por-
tion of the miniature income statement reports on the cost of goods sold.
The contribution margin is equivalent to the gross margin reported on a
QuickBooks income statement. A fixed cost amount summarizes the operat-
ing expenses. The vary-with-profit costs, essentially, summarize income
taxes and other profit-based expenses, such as a profit-sharing plan. Profits
equate to the net income.
Figure 1-3 shows a case in which modest changes in sales revenue can often
produce huge changes in profits. In Figure 1-3, column D in the worksheet
shows the profit-volume-cost forecast at the sales level equal to $315,000.
Column E shows the sales revenue and cost forecast at a sales revenue level
of $360,000. As the firm increases its profits by roughly 15 percent (this
increase shows in cells D28 and E28), profits increase by almost 900 percent
from $1,804 to $15,990 (the change from the values in cells D49 to E49).
You may not be interested in the common-size profit volume forecast shown
in Figure 1-4 because this income statement shows percentages based on
sales rather than dollar amounts. This figure lets you see what percent of

total sales a cost item represents. Sometimes this information is useful, and
sometimes it isn’t. If you aren’t interested in the information, simply select
rows 53–78 and then delete them from your workbook.
Looking at the profit-volume-cost charts
For fun, I included a couple of simple charts that show results from the
profit-volume-cost analysis. Figure 1-5, for example, shows the Breakeven
line chart. This line chart plots the total fixed costs, the total variable costs,
and then the total sales. The intersection of the total sales line and the total
fixed costs line shows the breakeven point. By comparing the slopes of the
total sales and the variable costs line, you can also get an idea of how sensi-
tive the profits are to changes in sales revenue. If you have a good eye, you
can also even use the Breakeven line chart to roughly estimate the profit at
various revenue levels. To do this, find the point on the total sales line equal
to the sales revenue level for which you want to guesstimate profits. Then
use the value axis (the vertical axis on the left side of the chart) to calibrate
the difference between the total sales line and the total variable costs line.
The difference between these two lines shows your profit or loss.

The total variable costs line actually shows the total variable costs plus the
total fixed costs because it’s stacked on top of the fixed costs line.
Figure 1-6 shows the profit-volume-cost data from the worksheet. This analy-
sis is more complicated, so the chart is a bit trickier to interpret. Nevertheless,
the chart resembles the Breakeven line chart. Fixed costs appear as a solid
band equal to $150,000 at the bottom of the graph. Variable costs appear as
a sort of trapezoidal shape on top of the fixed costs. Above those costs appear
the costs that vary with profits and the actual profit. Note that profits only
occur after the firm exceeds the breakeven point. (The data labels on the
horizontal axis represent the different volumes being tested.)
The costs varying with profits area of the graph is light blue, and the profits
area is black. Because these colors are difficult to distinguish in this black-
and-white book, you may want to open up the actual workbook and look at
the colored charts on the screen rather than in the book.

Dealing with vary-with-profit costs
If your profit-volume-cost analysis includes
more than a single vary-with-profit cost, you
must deal with the possibility that your vary-
with-profit costs are interrelated. In fact, 
vary-with-profit costs can have one of three
relationships: independent-independent, inde-
pendent-dependent, or dependent-dependent.
The independent-independent relationship is
the easiest to deal with. If two vary-with-profit
costs are independent of each other, you can
just enter the percentages into the appropriate
workbook cells and not worry about them. An
independent-independent relationship exists
when vary-with-profit costs have no effect on
each other. For example, a partnership may
have two profit-sharing plans — one for part-
ners and one for employees — that aren’t
related.
A slightly more complicated relationship
between vary-with-profit costs is the case of 
an independent-dependent relationship. A good
example of an independent-dependent relation-
ship is the relationship of state and federal
income taxes. Because federal income taxes
allow for a deduction based on state income
taxes, the federal income tax expense depends
on the state income tax expense. If the federal
income tax percent equals 20 percent and the
state income tax percent equals 10 percent, you
can’t simply enter the state income tax as 10 per-
cent and the federal income tax as 20 percent.
You need to adjust the federal income tax per-
centage for the effect of the state income tax.
For example, suppose that the state income tax
rate is 10 percent of the pre-tax profits and that
after deducting the state income tax from the
pre-tax profits, the federal income tax rate is 20
percent of what’s left over. The correct input
percentage for the state income tax rate is 10
percent because 10 percent of the pre-tax prof-
its calculates the correct state income tax cost
as follows:
State income tax = 10 percent × pre-tax
profits
However, the federal income tax percentage
must recognize the state income tax costs:
Federal income tax = 20 percent × (pre-
tax profits – (10 percent ×
pretax profits))
This formula can be further modified to express
the federal income tax rate as a percentage of
the pre-tax profits and, therefore, you input the
following into the Profit-Volume-Cost Analysis
workbook:
Federal income tax = 18 percent × pre-tax
profits
A third type of relationship is the dependent-
dependent relationship. This relationship
occurs when one vary-with-profit cost affects
another vary-with-profit cost. For example, in
the case of a typical employee profit-sharing
plan where profits are based on after-tax prof-
its, you need to know the profit-sharing plan
expense in order to calculate the federal
income taxes. The profit-sharing plan expense
is deductible for purposes of calculating 
federal income taxes. However, you must know
the federal income tax expense in order to 
calculate the after-tax profits upon which 
the profit-sharing plan is based. In cases of
dependent-dependent relationships among
vary-with-profit costs, you can calculate per-
centages that, in effect, adjust for the depend-
ency. To do this, you need to employ a fair
amount of high school algebra.

P
ro forma financial statements — which are income statements, balance
sheets, and cash flow statements — constitute an integral part of busi-
ness planning and the overall budgeting process. For that reason, I want to
provide you with a bit of information about how you create such pro forma
(or as if) statements.
From the very start, however, I need to warn you that in order to create
such statements, you need another tool in addition to QuickBooks.
Specifically, you need a spreadsheet program such as Microsoft Excel.
Assuming that you do have something like Microsoft Excel, you can use it
and the example workbook that this chapter describes to create a simple,
yet sophisticated, financial forecast for your business. To download the
workbook, go to my Web site, www.stephenlnelson.com, click the
Business Consulting link, and then double-click the BIZPLAN.XLS link. 
If your fingers are up to it, you can also just type www.stephenlnelson.
com/bizplan.xls into your Web browser’s Address box.
Reviewing Financial Statements and Ratios
Before I get into the nitty-gritty details of creating a business forecast, I 
need to briefly discuss what financial statements and ratios are and how to
use financial statements and ratios to describe either the past or the future
financial condition and performance of a business.

Reviewing Financial Statements and Ratios
398
The term financial statement can refer to one of several types of schedules
and summaries of economic information. Typically, however, the term
describes a set of documents that include an income statement (also called
a statement of operations), a balance sheet (also called a statement of finan-
cial condition), and a cash flow statement.
An income statement details the profits and losses of a business for a specific
period. For example, you may want to know the profits or losses of your
business over the past month. Therefore, you prepare an income statement
that lists your revenues and expenses and calculates the profits or losses for
the month.
A balance sheet identifies and lists the assets and liabilities of a business as
of a specific time. It paints a clear picture of what the business owns, what
the business owes, and the difference between the two (often called the net
worth or owner equity). Typically, you prepare a balance sheet as of the end
of the period that an income statement covers. For example, if you prepare
an income statement for a month, you may also want to prepare a balance
sheet on the last day of the month.
A cash flow statement outlines the cash inflows and outflows of a business for
a specific period. Generally, you prepare a cash flow statement for the same
period for which you prepare an income statement.
The cash flow statements that large companies use for their investors are
quite complicated. They show lots of numbers arranged in a very Rube
Goldberg-esque fashion. For this reason, I use the simpler cash flow state-
ment format that accountants once used.
Financial ratios, as I describe in some detail in Book V, Chapter 1, express
relationships among the amounts reported in the financial statements. The
ratios can offer insights into the economic health of a business. The ratios
can also indicate how reasonable the implicit assumptions are in a forecast.
For example, by comparing the ratios of your business with the ratios of sim-
ilar businesses, you can compare the financial characteristics of your busi-
ness with those of other businesses. By comparing the ratios in your pro
forma model with industry averages and standards, you also test your mod-
eling assumptions for reasonableness.
Two general categories of financial ratios exist: common size ratios and
intrastatement or interstatement ratios. Common size ratios convert a finan-
cial statement — usually a balance sheet or an income statement — from
dollars to percentages. Common size ratios allow for comparisons of the
assets, liabilities, revenues, owner equity, and expenses of businesses of var-
ious sizes. The comparison can be either at a point in time or as a trend over
time. Intrastatement or interstatement ratios quantify relationships among

Book VI
Chapter 2
Creating a Business
Plan Forecast
Using the Business Plan Workbook
399
amounts from different financial statements or from different parts of the
same financial statement, respectively. Intrastatement and interstatement
ratios are an attempt to account for the fact that amounts usually can’t be
interpreted alone but must be viewed in the context of other key financial
factors and events. In general, both categories of ratios are most valuable
when compared with industry averages and trends.
This financial ratio business is really cool. If you have time, I heartily recom-
mend that you peruse the greater coverage of the topic provided in Book V,
Chapter 1.
Using the Business Plan Workbook
Unfortunately, it really isn’t very practical to create an example set of finan-
cial statements on, say, the back of a cocktail napkin or a set of sticky notes.
You need to get the computer’s help.
I suggest that you use Microsoft Excel and a workbook like the one shown 
in Figures 2-1 through 2-5. With this workbook, which is available at www.
stephenlnelson.com, you can construct pro forma financial statements
that enable you to forecast profits and losses, financial condition, and cash
flows for a business or organization.
To use the workbook, you develop and then enter information about the 
following:
✦Assets
✦Creditor and owner equities at the start of the forecasting horizon
✦Expected changes in the assets and equities over the forecasting horizon
✦Revenues and expenses for each period on the forecasting horizon
You’re probably wondering how this baby works. Well, the workbook does a
lot, but it’s actually pretty straightforward in its operation. When you input
data that includes your starting assets, liabilities, owner equity balances,
and expected changes in these amounts for the forecasting horizon, the
workbook constructs a balance sheet. The workbook constructs an income
statement when you input data that includes sales and costs of sales, operat-
ing expenses, interest income and expenses, and marginal income tax rates.
Then, from the balance sheet and income statement, the workbook con-
structs a cash flow statement.
To enter your own data in the business planning starter workbook, use the
following steps. Enter positive balances or increases as positive amounts,
and enter negative balances or decreases as negative amounts.

1. Open the business plan workbook, bizplan.xls, from my Web site by
pointing your browser to www.stephenlnelson.com/bizplan.xls.
The starter workbook initially contains the default inputs shown in
Figure 2-1. Note that you can see only about the first 25 rows and the
first 6 or so columns of the inputs area. Sorry — I didn’t have room to
show everything. If you want to see what you’re missing, grab the work-
book from the Web site.
2. Enter the Cash & Equivalents balance for the start of the forecasting
horizon.
The value that you enter for Cash & Equivalents is the dollar total of all
the cash held at the beginning of the forecasting period.
You can get the Cash & Equivalents value from QuickBooks if you’re fore-
casting from the present forward. The cash that you start with, obvi-
ously, is the cash that you’re holding today.
3. Enter the forecasted period yield that you expect the cash and equiva-
lents to deliver.
Figure 2-1:

The model estimates the period interest income by multiplying the cash
and equivalents balance by the yield on cash and equivalents.
4. Enter the Accounts Receivable balance for the start of the forecasting
horizon.
The value that you enter for Accounts Receivable (A/R) is the starting
accounts receivable balance, which is the balance at the beginning of
the forecasting horizon excluding any allowance for uncollectible
amounts.
5. Enter the number of periods of sales in accounts receivable.
The value that you enter for # Periods of Sales in A/R, or number of 
periods of sales in accounts receivable, is the number of periods or the
fraction of a period for which sales are held in accounts receivable. If
accounts receivable typically amount to about 30 days of sales and 
you use months as your forecasting periods, you hold one period (one
month) of sales in accounts receivable. Alternatively, if accounts receiv-
able typically amount to about 30 days of sales and you use years as
your forecasting periods, you hold one-twelfth of a period of sales in
accounts receivable.
6. Enter the dollar amount of the inventory held at the start of the fore-
casting horizon.
The Inventory value is the starting inventory balance, which is the total
dollar amount of the inventory purchased for resale or manufactured for
resale and held at the beginning of the forecasting horizon.
7. Enter the forecasted dollar amount of inventory purchased or pro-
duced for each period of the forecasting horizon.
The Inventory Purchased/Produced value is the dollar total of items pur-
chased or produced over the period.
8. Enter the amount of the other current assets held at the start of the
forecasting horizon.
The Other Current Assets starting balance is the dollar total of any other
current assets with which you begin the forecasting horizon. These
other current assets may include prepaid expenses, short-term invest-
ments, and deposits made with vendors.
9. Enter the amount of the change in the other current assets for each
period in the forecasting horizon.
The value for Chgs in Other Current Assets, or changes in other current
assets for the period, is the dollar total of increases or decreases in the
accounts included in the starting Other Current Assets balance.

Using the Business Plan Workbook
402
10. Enter the amount of the plant, property, and equipment at the start of
the forecasting horizon.
The starting Plant, Property, & Equipment balance is the dollar total of
the fixed assets. This amount includes such items as real estate, manu-
facturing equipment, furniture, and the Lear jet.
11. Enter the amount of the change in the plant, property, and equipment
(P, P, & E) for each period of the forecasting horizon.
The Chgs in P, P, & E value is the dollar total of decreases or increases in
the plant, property, and equipment accounts for the period. Increases in
these accounts probably stem from purchases of additional fixed assets.
Decreases in these accounts probably stem from disposal of assets.
12. Enter the amount of the accumulated depreciation on the plant, prop-
erty, and equipment at the start of the forecasting horizon.
The starting Accumulated Depreciation balance represents the deprecia-
tion expenses charged to date on the assets identified in the starting P, P,
& E balance.
13. Enter the amount of the change in the accumulated depreciation for
each period of the forecasting horizon.
The Chgs in Accum. Depreciation value is the dollar total of increases
and decreases in the accumulated depreciation account for the period.
Increases in the accumulated depreciation balance probably stem from
the current period depreciation expense. Decreases in the accumulated
depreciation balance probably stem from removing the accumulated
depreciation attributed to a fixed asset that you disposed of.
14. Enter the amount of the other noncurrent assets at the start of the
period.
The starting Other Noncurrent Assets balance is the dollar total of all
other noncurrent assets held at the start of the forecasting period. Other
noncurrent assets may include copyrights, patents, and goodwill.
15. Enter the amount of the change in the other noncurrent assets for
each period of the forecasting horizon.
The Chgs in Other Noncurrent Assets value is the dollar total increase or
decrease for the period in the accounts included in the starting Other
Noncurrent Assets balance.
16. Enter the amount of the accounts payable balance at the start of the
forecasting horizon.
The starting Accounts Payable (A/P) balance is the dollar total of
amounts owed vendors for inventory at the start of the forecasting hori-
zon. This starter workbook calculates future Accounts Payable balances

based on the cost of sales volumes. To add precision to the forecasts of
accounts payable, the model assumes that accounts payable represent
debt incurred for the cost of sales.
17. Enter the number of periods of the cost of sales in accounts payable.
The # Periods Cost of Sales in A/P is the number of periods or the frac-
tion of a period for which the cost of sales is held in accounts payable. If
accounts payable typically amount to about 30 days of cost of sales and
you use months as your forecasting periods, you hold one period (one
month) of cost of sales in accounts payable. Alternatively, if accounts
payable typically amount to about 30 days of cost of sales and you use
years as your forecasting periods, you hold one-twelfth of a period of
cost of sales in accounts payable.
18. Enter the amount of the accrued expenses balance at the start of the
forecasting horizon.
The starting Accrued Expenses (A/E) balance is the dollar total of
amounts owed vendors for operating expenses at the start of the fore-
cast horizon. This starter workbook calculates future Accrued Expenses
balances based on the operating expenses levels. To add precision to
the forecasts of accrued expenses, the model assumes that accrued
expenses represent debt incurred for operating expenses.
19. Enter the number of periods of operating expenses in accrued
expenses.
The # Periods Operating Expenses in A/E value is the number of periods
or the fraction of a period for which operating expenses are held in
accrued expenses. If accrued expenses typically amount to 30 days of
operating expenses and you use months as your forecasting periods,
you hold one period of operating expenses in accrued expenses. Alter-
natively, if accrued expenses typically amount to about 30 days of oper-
ating expenses and you use years as your forecasting periods, you hold
one-twelfth of a period of operating expenses in accrued expenses.
20. Enter the amount of the other current liabilities at the start of the
forecasting period.
The Other Current Liabilities starting balance is the dollar total of all
other current liabilities held at the start of the forecasting period. Other
current liabilities may include income tax payable, product warranty lia-
bility, and the current portion of a long-term liability.
21. Enter the amount of the change in the other current liabilities for
each period of the forecasting horizon.
The Chgs in Other Current Liabilities value is the dollar total of increases
or decreases for the period in the accounts included in the starting
Other Current Liabilities balance.

Using the Business Plan Workbook
404
22. Enter the amount of the long-term liabilities balance at the start of the
forecasting horizon.
The starting Long-Term Liabilities balance is the dollar total of debt that
will be paid back sometime after the next year.
23. Enter the amount of the change in the long-term liabilities for each
period of the forecasting horizon.
The Chgs in Long-Term Liabilities value is the increase or decrease for
the period in the outstanding long-term debt. These changes may include
decreases stemming from the amortization of principal through debt
service payments and increases stemming from additional funds pro-
vided by creditors. You need to include the principal component of debt
service payments as negative amounts because they decrease the
amount of long-term liability.
24. Enter the amount of the other noncurrent liabilities at the start of the
forecasting horizon.
The Other Noncurrent Liabilities starting balance is the dollar total of 
all other noncurrent liabilities held at the start of the forecasting period.
These may include deferred income tax, employee pension plan liabili-
ties, and capitalized lease obligations.
25. Enter the amount of the change in the other noncurrent liabilities for
each period of the forecasting horizon.
The Chgs in Other Noncurrent Liabilities value is the dollar total of
increases or decreases for the period in the accounts included in the
starting Other Noncurrent Liabilities balance. These changes may
include decreases stemming from the amortization of principal through
debt service payments and increases stemming from additional funds
provided by creditors.
26. Enter the amount of the owner equity balance at the start of the fore-
casting horizon.
The Owner Equity starting balance is the dollar total of the capital origi-
nally contributed by owners and the earnings retained by the business
at the start of the forecasting horizon.
27. Enter the amount of the change in the owner equity balance for each
period of the forecasting horizon stemming from additional capital
contributions, dividends, and other special distributions to owners.
The Chgs in Owner Equity value is the dollar total of increases for the
period in owner equity, other than those stemming from the profits of a
business and all decreases in owner equity. For example, increases in
the Owner Equity balance may result from additional offerings of common
or preferred stock and treasury stock transactions; decreases in the
Owner Equity balance may result from dividends and other distributions
to stockholders.

Book VI
Chapter 2

Using the Business Plan Workbook
405
Changes to the owner equity balance resulting from the profit or loss for
the period are calculated on the income statement; they are not entered.
28. Enter the sales revenue forecasted for each period of the forecasting
horizon.
The Sales Revenue values represent the forecasted sales revenues gener-
ated by the business over each period of the forecasting horizon.
29. Enter the cost of sales forecasted for each period of the forecasting
horizon.
The Cost of Sales values represent the forecasted costs of the inventory
sold for the forecasting horizon.
30. Enter those costs that fall into the first, second, and third operating
expense classifications or categories for each period of the forecasting
horizon.
The operating expenses for Cost Centers 1, 2, and 3 represent the oper-
ating expenses for the forecasting horizon. These figures may be three
expense classifications related to operating the business, or they may be
the total expenses for three groups of expenses.
Typically, you would use one cost center to track your general and
administrative expenses, another cost center to track your sales and
marketing expenses, and yet another cost center to track your research
and development expenses. If you do this, consider replacing the labels
Cost Center 1, Cost Center 2, and Cost Center 3 with more descriptive and
meaningful labels, such as General & Admin, Sales & Marketing, and
Research & Development.
31. Enter the interest expense of carrying any debt used to fund opera-
tions or asset purchases.
The Interest Expense values represent the period interest expenses of
carrying any debt related to the business.
32. Enter the income tax rate that, when multiplied against the profit or
loss for the period, calculates the income tax expense (or savings).
The Income Tax Rate value is the percentage that, when multiplied by
the operating profit (or loss), calculates the income tax expense (or sav-
ings). This can be a little tricky because business income taxes are pro-
gressive. For example, a sole proprietor’s tax rates go from 0 to roughly
35 percent, depending on the level of income. A regular corporation’s
income tax rates go from 15 to 34 percent (with some bounces up and
down along the way). This may mean that you need your tax advisor’s
help to come up with a good number for this input. On the other hand,
you may just decide to only calculate pretax profits and losses. To do
this, enter this amount as 0.

Understanding the Workbook Calculations
406
After you enter the required inputs, the starter workbook makes the calcula-
tions necessary to construct pro forma financial statements and to calculate
a set of rather standard financial ratios.
Understanding the Workbook Calculations
The business plan workbook has seven parts: the inputs forecast, Balance
Sheet, Common Size Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Common Size Income
Statement, Cash Flow Statement, and Financial Ratios Table. I want to briefly
describe the Excel calculations that occur within each of these parts so that,
in case you have questions about them or you want to make modifications,
you can customize the starter workbook to perform better for your specific
situation.
If you don’t know Excel and don’t want to learn it, don’t worry. You can just
skip this discussion. I provide it for the benefit of those readers who want to
understand the inner workings of the workbook and may need or want to
customize the workbook’s calculations.
Forecasting inputs
The inputs area of the business planning starter workbook contains one set
of formulas. The second row identifies the period for which the results are
calculated. The period identifier numbers the periods for which values are
entered. The start of the first period is stored in cell B2 as the integer 0.
Periods that follow are stored as the previous period plus 1.
The period identifiers in the Balance Sheet, Common Size Balance Sheet,
Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement, and Financial Ratios Table sched-
ules use similar formulas.
The cells that hold the period identifiers use a custom number format that
precedes each period with the word Period. To remove this, simply reformat
the cells by using another number format. You can most easily do this by
selecting a cell and then clicking a formatting button on the Excel toolbar,
such as the Currency or Percent Style button.
Balance Sheet
The Balance Sheet schedule has 20 rows with calculated data, but the first
row contains only the text label Period, shown in Figure 2-2. (As in the inputs
area of the business planning starter workbook, the period identifier num-
bers the periods for which values are forecasted.) The rest of the Balance
Sheet’s values are described in the following paragraphs.

Cash & Equivalents
The Cash & Equivalents figures show the projected cash on hand at the end
of each of the forecasting periods. The starting balance is the value you
enter in the inputs area of the business planning starter workbook. The bal-
ance for the first and subsequent periods is pulled from the Cash Flow
Statement schedule, where it is calculated.
Accounts Receivable
The Accounts Receivable (A/R) figures show the net receivables held as of
the end of each forecasting period. The starting balance is the value that you
enter in the inputs planning area of the business starter worksheet. The bal-
ance for the first and subsequent periods is based on the Sales Revenue and
the # Periods of Sales in A/R values that you enter in the inputs area of the
business planning starter workbook. For example, the formula for the first
period is
=C7*C31
Figure 2-2:

408
The formula for the second period is
=D7*D31
and so on.
Inventory
The Inventory values show the dollar total of the inventory held at the end
of each forecasting period. The starting balance is the value that you enter in
the inputs area of the business planning starter workbook. The balance for
the first and subsequent periods is the previous period balance plus any
inventory purchases or production costs minus any cost of sales. For exam-
ple, the formula for the first period is
=B45+C9–C32
The formula for the second period is
=C45+D9–D32
and so on.
Other Current Assets
The Other Current Assets figures show the dollar total of the other current
assets held at the end of each forecasting period. The starting balance for
Other Current Assets is the value that you enter in the inputs area of the
business planning starter workbook. The balance for the first and subse-
quent periods is the previous balance plus the change in the balance. For
example, the formula for the first period is
=B46+C11
The formula for the second period is
=C46+D11
and so on.
Total Current Assets
The Total Current Assets figures show the dollar total of the current assets
at the end of each of the forecasting horizons. The balance at any time is the
sum of Cash & Equivalents, Accounts Receivable, Inventory, and Other

Book VI
Chapter 2

409
Current Assets. For example, the formula for the starting Total Current
Assets balance is
=SUM(B43:B46)
The formula for the first period is
=SUM(C43:C46)
and so on.
Plant, Property, & Equipment
The Plant, Property, & Equipment figures show the original dollar cost of the
plant, property, and equipment at the end of each forecasting horizon. The
starting Plant, Property, & Equipment balance is the value that you enter in
the inputs area of the business planning starter workbook. The balance for
the first and subsequent periods is the previous balance plus any additions
to the plant, property, and equipment accounts. For example, the formula for
the first period is
=B48+C13
The formula for the second period is
=C48+D13
and so on.
Less: Accumulated Depreciation
The Accumulated Depreciation figures show the cumulative depreciation
expenses charged through the current period for the plant, property, and
equipment. The starting balance is the value that you enter in the inputs
area of the business planning starter workbook. The balance for the first 
and subsequent periods is the previous balance minus the current period’s
changes in accumulated depreciation. For example, the formula for the first
period is
=B49–C15
The formula for the second period is
=C49–D15
and so on. Because the accumulated depreciation is shown as a negative
amount, you subtract the positive number pulled from the forecasting
inputs.

Understanding the Workbook Calculations
410
Net Plant, Property, & Equipment
The Net Plant, Property, & Equipment figures show the difference between
Plant, Property, & Equipment and Accumulated Depreciation at the end of
each of the forecasting horizons. For example, the formula for the starting
balance is
=B48+B49
The formula for the first period is
=C48+C49
and so on. Because the Accumulated Depreciation balance is shown as a
negative amount, you simply add these two amounts in the formula for the
Net Plant, Property, & Equipment amount.
Other Noncurrent Assets
The Other Noncurrent Assets figures show the dollar total of any other non-
current assets held at the end of each forecasting period. The starting bal-
ance is the value that you enter in the inputs area of the business planning
starter workbook. The balance for the first and subsequent periods is the
previous period balance plus the change in the account in the current
period. For example, the formula for the first period is
=B51+C17
The formula for the second period is
=C51+D17
and so on.
Total Assets
The Total Assets figures show the dollar total of all the assets held at the end
of the forecasting periods. The balance at any time is the sum of: Current
Assets; Net Plant, Property, & Equipment; and Other Noncurrent Assets. For
example, the formula for the starting balance is
=B47+B50+B51
The formula for the first period is
=C47+C50+C51
and so on.

The Accounts Payable figures show the debt that is related to the cost of
sales outstanding at the end of each forecasting period. The starting balance
is the value that you enter in the inputs area of the business planning starter
workbook. The balance for the first and subsequent periods is Cost Of Sales
for the period times # Periods Cost of Sales In A/P. For example, the formula
for the first period is
=C19*C32
The formula for the second period is
=D19*D32
and so on.
Accrued Expenses
The Accrued Expenses figures show the debt that is related to the operating
expenses outstanding at the end of each forecasting period. The starting bal-
ance is the value that you enter in the inputs area of the business planning
starter workbook. The balance for the first and subsequent periods is the
operating expenses times # Periods Operating Expenses in A/E. For example,
the formula for the first period is
=C21*SUM(C33:C35)
The formula for the second period is
=D21*SUM(D33:D35)
and so on.
Other Current Liabilities
The Other Current Liabilities figures show the dollar total of other debts out-
standing at the end of the forecasting periods that will be paid within the
current year or business cycle. The starting balance is the value that you
enter in the inputs area of the business planning starter workbook. The bal-
ance for the first and subsequent periods is the previous balance plus the
change in the current period. For example, the formula for the first period is
=B59+C23

Understanding the Workbook Calculations
412
The formula for the second period is
=C59+D23
and so on.
Total Current Liabilities
The Total Current Liabilities figures show the dollar total of all the current lia-
bilities at the end of each forecasting period. The balance at any time is the
sum of Accounts Payable, Accrued Expenses, and Other Current Liabilities.
For example, the formula for the starting balance is
=SUM(B57:B59)
The formula for the first period is
=SUM(C57:C59)
and so on.
Long-Term Liabilities
The Long-Term Liabilities figures show the dollar total of the long-term out-
standing debt at the end of each forecasting period. The starting balance is
the value that you enter in the inputs area of the business planning starter
workbook. The balance for the first and subsequent periods is the previous
balance plus any changes in the Long-Term Liabilities balance in the current
period. For example, the formula for the first period is
=B62+C25
The formula for the second period is
=C62+D25
and so on.
Other Noncurrent Liabilities
The Other Noncurrent Liabilities figures show the dollar total of any other
noncurrent outstanding debt at the end of each forecasting period. The
starting balance is the value that you enter in the inputs area of the business
planning starter workbook. The balance for the first and subsequent periods
is the previous period balance plus the change in the current period. For
example, the formula for the first period is
=B63+C27

413
The formula for the second period is
=C63+D27
and so on.
Total Noncurrent Liabilities
The Total Noncurrent Liabilities figures show the dollar totals of the long-
term debt and the other noncurrent outstanding debt at the end of each fore-
casting period. The balance at any time is the sum of Long-Term Liabilities
and Other Noncurrent Liabilities. For example, the formula for the starting
balance is
=B62+B63
The formula for the first period is
=C62+C63
and so on.
Owner Equity
The Owner Equity figures show the dollar totals of the owner equity accounts
at the end of each forecasting period. The starting balance is the value that
you enter in the inputs area of the business planning starter workbook. The
balance for the first and subsequent periods is the previous period balance
plus Net Income After Taxes for the period plus other adjustments, such as
additional capital contributions and dividends. For example, the formula for
the first period is
=B65+C29+C116
The formula for the second period is
=C65+D29+D116
and so on.
Total Liabilities and Owner Equity
The Total Liabilities and Owner Equity figures show the dollar totals of
Current Liabilities, Noncurrent Liabilities, and Owner Equity at the end of
each forecasting period. For example, the formula for the starting balance is
=B60+B64+B65

Understanding the Workbook Calculations
414
The formula for the first period is
=C60+C64+C65
and so on.
The Total Assets value should equal the Total Liabilities and Owner Equity
value. If they differ, your model contains an error.
Common Size Balance Sheet
The Common Size Balance Sheet schedule lists — in the balance sheet
format — what percentage of the total assets each individual asset repre-
sents and what percentage of the total liabilities and owner equity each indi-
vidual liability and the owner equity represents, as shown in Figure 2-3.
When you compare these percentages with those of business peers, you can
see the relative financial strength or weakness of your business. Trends in
the percentages over time can indicate improvement or deterioration in the
overall financial condition of your business.

The Common Size Balance Sheet schedule has 20 rows with calculated data
that express line-item amounts as percentages of the total. For the asset side
of the Balance Sheet, assets are expressed as a percentage of the total assets.
For the creditor and owner equity side of the Balance Sheet, equities are
expressed as a percentage of the total liabilities and owner equity. The for-
mulas for all rows except Total Assets and Total Liabilities and Owner Equity
simply convert the Balance Sheet values to percentages. For example, the
Cash & Equivalents formula for the first period is
=B43/B$52
The formula for the second period is
=C43/C$52
and so on. All asset percentages are derived from dividing by Total Assets,
which explains why the absolute reference to row $52 is used in all asset for-
mulas. Similarly, the absolute reference to row $66 appears in all formulas in
the liabilities and equity formulas.
The formula for the Total Assets percentage at any time is the sum of the
Current Assets, the Net Plant, Property & Equipment, and the Other
Noncurrent Assets percentages. The result always equals 100 percent.
Similarly, the formula for the Total Liabilities and Owner Equity percentage
at any time is the sum of the Current Liabilities, the Noncurrent Liabilities,
and Owner Equity percentages. The result is always 100 percent.
Income Statement
The Income Statement schedule has 12 rows of calculated data, as shown in
Figure 2-4. As in other schedules, the period identifier simply numbers the
periods for which values are calculated. The first period is stored in cell C99
as the integer 1, and the periods that follow are stored as the previous
period plus 1. The other values in the Income Statement are calculated as
described in the following paragraphs.
Sales Revenue
The Sales Revenue figures are the estimates that you enter in the inputs 
area of the business planning starter workbook. The amount for the period
is the value that you enter in the inputs area of the business planning starter
workbook.
Less: Cost of Sales
The Cost Of Sales figures are the Cost of Sales estimates that you enter in the
inputs area of the business planning starter workbook.

Understanding the Workbook Calculations
416
Gross Margin
The Gross Margin figures show the amounts left over from the sales pro-
ceeds after subtracting Cost of Sales. Subtracting your other expenses from
the Gross Margin amount gives you your profit figure. The Gross Margin for-
mula is Sales Revenue for the period minus Cost of Sales. For example, the
formula for the first period is
=C100+C101
The formula for the second period is
=D100+D101
and so on. Notice that because the Cost of Sales figures are pulled into the
Income Statement schedule as negative amounts, the Gross Margin formula
simply adds the Sales Revenue figure to the negative Cost of Sales figure.
Operating Expenses — Cost Centers 1, 2, and 3
The Operating Expenses figures for Cost Centers 1, 2, and 3 show the amount
for each operating expense classification or category that you enter in the
inputs area of the business planning starter workbook.

417
Total Operating Expenses
The Total Operating Expenses figures show the sums of the operating
expenses that you enter in the inputs area of the business planning starter
workbook for these three operating expense categories or classifications.
The total for each period is the sum of the operating expenses for Cost
Centers 1, 2, and 3. For example, the formula for the first period is
=SUM(C105:C107)
The formula for the second period is
=SUM(D105:D107)
and so on.
Operating Income
The Operating Income figures show the sales dollar amounts left after paying
the Cost of Sales and the Operating Expenses. The Operating Income figures
represent the amounts that go toward paying your financing expenses and
income tax as well as the amount that constitutes your profits. The amount
for each period is the Gross Margin figure for the period minus the Total
Operating Expenses figure. For example, the formula for the first period is
=C102–C108
The formula for the second period is
=D102–D108
and so on.
Interest Income
The Interest Income figures show the earnings from investing the cash of the
business. The amount for each period is the beginning Cash & Equivalents
balance from the inputs area of the business planning starter workbook mul-
tiplied by the period yield on Cash & Equivalents. For example, the formula
for the first period is
=B43*C5
The formula for the second period is
=C43*D5
and so on.

Understanding the Workbook Calculations
418
Interest Expense
The Interest Expense figures show the costs of using borrowed funds for
operations and asset purchases. The amount for each period is the value
that you enter in the inputs area of the business planning starter workbook.
Net Income (Loss) Before Taxes
The Net Income (Loss) Before Taxes figures show the amount of operating
income left after receiving any interest income and paying any interest
expense. The amount for each period is the Operating Income figure for the
period, plus the Interest Income figure for the period, minus the Interest
Expense figure for the period. For example, the formula for the first period is
=C109+C111–C112
The formula for the second period is
=D109+D111–D112
and so on.
Income Tax Expenses (Savings)
The Income Tax Expenses (Savings) figures show the income tax expenses
(or savings) that use the calculated Net Income (Loss) Before Taxes figures
and the Marginal Income Tax Rate figures that you forecasted in the inputs
area of the business planning starter workbook. Notice that the model calcu-
lates a current period savings in income taxes when there is a net loss before
taxes. This may be the case when a current period loss is carried back to a
prior period or when the current period loss is consolidated with the cur-
rent period income of related businesses. Basically, then, the model assumes
that a net loss before income taxes results in a current period tax refund —
that is, an overall tax savings — because you can deduct a loss in one busi-
ness from the profits of another business. However, if a current period loss
doesn’t result in a current period income tax savings, you modify the for-
mula, as described in the section “Customizing the Starter Workbook,” later
in this chapter.
The amount for each period is the Net Income (Loss) Before Taxes multi-
plied by the Marginal Income Tax Rate figure. For example, the formula for
the first period is
=C37*C113

Book VI
Chapter 2
Creating a Business

Understanding the Workbook Calculations
419
The formula for the second period is
=D37*D113
and so on.
Net Income (Loss) After Taxes
The Net Income (Loss) After Taxes figures calculate the after-tax profits of
operating the business. The amount for each period is the Net Income (Loss)
Before Taxes figure minus the Income Tax Expenses (Savings) figure. For
example, the formula for the first period is
=C113–C115
The formula for the second period is
=D113–D115
and so on.
Common Size Income Statement
The Common Size Income Statement schedule lists, in income statement
format, what percentage of the total sales revenue each income statement
line item represents (refer to Figure 2-4). When you compare these percent-
ages with those of business peers, you can see the relative financial perform-
ance of your business. Trends in the percentages over the forecasting horizon
can indicate improvement or deterioration in the financial performance of
your business.
The Common Size Income Statement schedule has 13 rows of calculated data
that express the component line-item amount for each period as a percent-
age of the sales revenue figure for the period. The formulas for all rows except
Sales Revenue simply convert the Income Statement values to percentages.
The Sales Revenue figures add the Cost of Sales, Total Operating Expenses,
Interest Income, Interest Expense, Income Tax Expenses (Savings), and 
Net Income (Loss) After Taxes percentages. The results always equal 100
percent.
The Sales Revenue percentage calculations add the expense and profit 
percentages. Those expenses shown as negative amounts, therefore, are 
subtracted.

Understanding the Workbook Calculations
420
Cash Flow Statement
The Cash Flow Statement schedule has 16 rows of calculated data, shown in
Figure 2-5. Like in other schedules, a period identifier numbers the periods
for which values are calculated. The first period is stored in cell C141 as inte-
ger 1. Periods that follow are stored as the previous period plus 1. Other
Cash Flow Statement values are calculated as described in the following
paragraphs.
Beginning Cash Balance
The Beginning Cash Balance figures show the forecasted cash and equiva-
lents balance at the start of each forecasting period. The starting balance is
the value that you enter in the inputs area of the business planning starter
workbook. For subsequent periods, the Beginning Cash Balance is the previ-
ous period’s Ending Cash Balance.
Net Income After Taxes
The Net Income After Taxes figures show the amounts calculated in the
Income Statement schedule as the business profits for each forecasting
period.

Addback of Depreciation
The Addback of Depreciation figures show the change in the accumulated
depreciation balance for each forecasting period. Normally, this change
stems from the period depreciation expense; it must be added back into the
Net Income After Taxes figure because the depreciation expense uses no
cash. The depreciation added back for each period is the value that you
enter in the inputs area of the business planning starter workbook as the
change in accumulated depreciation.
Accounts Payable Financing
The Accounts Payable Financing figures show the change in the Accounts
Payable balance for the period. Increases in this balance result when the
cost of sales expense paid during the period is lower than the expense
incurred. Decreases in this balance result when the cost of sales expense
paid is higher than the expense incurred. By recognizing the changes in this
account balance, the model adjusts for differences between the Income
Statement’s accrual-based accounting of cost of sales expenses and the
actual cash disbursements for cost of sales expenses.
The Accounts Payable Financing figure for each period is the difference
between the Accounts Payable balance at the end of the previous period and
the balance at the end of the current period. For example, the formula for
the first period is
=C57–B57
The formula for the second period is
=D57–C57
and so on.
Accrued Expenses Financing
The Accrued Expenses Financing figures show the change in the accrued
expenses balance for the period. Increases in this balance result when the
operating expense paid during the period is lower than the expense incurred.
Decreases in this balance result when the operating expense paid during the
period is higher than the expense incurred. By recognizing the changes in
this account balance, the model adjusts for differences between the Income
Statement’s accrual-based accounting expenses and the actual cash dis-
bursements for operating expenses.
The Accrued Expenses Financing figure for each period is the difference
between the Accrued Expenses balance at the end of the previous period

422
and the balance at the end of the current period. For example, the formula
for the first period is
=C58–B58
The formula for the second period is
=D58–C58
and so on.
Other Current Liabilities Financing
The Other Current Liabilities Financing figures show the change in the Other
Current Liabilities balance for the period. This amount increases when,
either directly or indirectly, cash is generated by borrowing. This amount
decreases when, either directly or indirectly, cash is used to pay off short-
term borrowing.
The Other Current Liabilities Financing figure for each period is the differ-
ence between the Other Current Liabilities balance at the end of the previ-
ous period and the balance at the end of the current period. For example,
the formula for the first period is
=C59–B59
The formula for the second period is
=D59–C59
and so on.
Long-Term Liabilities Financing
The Long-Term Liabilities Financing figures show the changes in the long-
term liabilities amount for the period. This balance increases when, either
directly or indirectly, cash is generated by long-term borrowing. This amount
decreases when, either directly or indirectly, cash is used to pay off long-
term borrowing.
The Long-Term Liabilities Financing figure for each period is the difference
between the Long-Term Liabilities balance at the end of the previous period
and the balance at the end of the current period. For example, the formula
for the first period is
=C62–B62

Book VI
Chapter 2

423
The formula for the second period is
=D62–C62
and so on.
Other Noncurrent Liabilities Financing
The Other Noncurrent Liabilities Financing figures show the changes in the
Other Noncurrent Liabilities balance for the period. This amount increases
when, either directly or indirectly, cash is generated by other long-term bor-
rowing. This amount decreases when, either directly or indirectly, cash is
used to pay off other long-term borrowing.
The Other Noncurrent Liabilities Financing figure for each period is the dif-
ference between the Other Noncurrent Liabilities balance at the end of the
previous period and the balance at the end of the current period. For exam-
ple, the formula for the first period is
=C63–B63
The formula for the second period is
=D63–C63
and so on.
Accounts Receivable Investments
The Accounts Receivable Investments figures show the change in the
Accounts Receivable balance for each forecasting period. This amount
increases when the sales revenue collected during the period is less than the
revenue recorded. This amount decreases when the sales revenue collected
during the period is more than recorded. By recognizing the changes in the
account balance, the model adjusts for differences between the income
statement’s accrual-based accounting of sales revenues and the actual 
cash collections for sales.
The Accounts Receivable Investments figure for each period is the difference
between the Accounts Receivable balance at the end of the previous period
and the balance at the end of the current period. For example, the formula
for the first period is
=C44–B44

Understanding the Workbook Calculations
424
The formula for the second period is
=D44–C44
and so on.
Inventory Investments
The Inventory Investments figures show the change in the inventory balance
for each forecasting period. This amount increases when the inventory sold
is less than the inventory acquired. This amount decreases when the inven-
tory sold is more than the inventory acquired. By recognizing the changes in
this account balance, the model recognizes the cash effects of changing
inventory balances.
The Inventory Investments figure for each period is the difference between
the Inventory balance at the end of the previous period and the balance at
the end of the current period. For example, the formula for the first period is
=C45–B45
The formula for the second period is
=D45–C45
and so on.
Other Current Assets Investments
The Other Current Assets Investments figures show the changes in the Other
Current Assets balance for the period. This amount increases when, either
directly or indirectly, cash is used to acquire current assets. This amount
decreases when, either directly or indirectly, cash is generated by convert-
ing current assets to cash.
The Other Current Assets Investments figure for each period is the difference
between the Other Current Assets balance at the end of the previous period
and the balance at the end of the current period. For example, the formula
for the first period is
=C46-B46
The formula for the second period is
=D46–C46
and so on.

Plant, Property, & Equip Investments
The Plant, Property, & Equip Investments figures show the change in the
Plant, Property, & Equipment balance for the period. This amount increases
when, either directly or indirectly, cash is used to acquire plants, property,
and equipment. This amount decreases when, either directly or indirectly,
cash is generated by converting plants, property, and equipment to cash.
The Plant, Property, & Equip Investments figure for each period is the differ-
ence between the Plant, Property, & Equipment balance at the end of the
previous period and the balance at the end of the current period. For exam-
ple, the formula for the first period is
=C48–B48
The formula for the second period is
=D48–C48
and so on.
Other Noncurrent Assets Investments
The Other Noncurrent Assets Investments figures show the changes in the
Other Noncurrent Assets balance for the period. This amount increases
when, either directly or indirectly, cash is used to acquire other noncurrent
assets. This amount decreases when, either directly or indirectly, cash is
generated by converting other noncurrent assets to cash.
The Other Noncurrent Assets Investments figure for each period is the differ-
ence between the Other Noncurrent Assets balance at the end of the previ-
ous period and the balance at the end of the current period. For example,
the formula for the first period is
=C51–B51
The formula for the second period is
=D51–C51
and so on.
Other Owner Equity Changes
The Other Owner Equity Changes figures show the cash flows stemming
from any additional capital contributions made by the owners to the busi-
ness or from dividends and other distributions made by the business to the

Understanding the Workbook Calculations
426
owners. The Other Owner Equity Changes figure for each period is the value
that you enter in the inputs area of the business planning starter workbook.
The Other Owner Equity Changes figures are pulled into the Uses Of Cash
section as negative values because of the following: A positive change in the
owner equity, such as an additional capital contribution (from a stock offer-
ing, for example), doesn’t use cash but provides cash.
Net Cash Generated (Used)
The Net Cash Generated (Used) figures show the total cash flow for each
period of the forecasting horizon, based on the listed sources and uses of
cash. The amount for each period is the sources of cash for the period less
the uses of cash for the period. For example, the formula for the first period is
=SUM(C145:C151)–SUM(C154:C159)
The formula for the second period is
=SUM(D145:D151)–SUM(D154:D159)
and so on.
Ending Cash Balance
The Ending Cash Balance figures show the forecasted cash and equivalents
balance at the end of each period. The balance is the Beginning Cash Balance
figure for the period plus the Net Cash Generated (Used) figure for the period.
For example, the formula for the first period is
=C142+C160
The formula for the second period is
=D142+D160
and so on.
Financial Ratios Table
The Financial Ratios Table has 11 rows of calculated data, as shown in 
Figure 2-6. As in other schedules, the period identifier numbers the periods
for which values are calculated. The first period is stored in cell C165 as the
integer 1, and periods that follow are stored as the previous period plus 1.
The other values in the Financial Ratios Table are calculated as described in
the following paragraphs.

Book VI
Chapter 2

Current Ratio
The Current Ratio figures show the ratio of current assets to current liabili-
ties. The current ratio provides one measure of a business’s ability to meet its
short-term obligations. The Current Ratio figure for each period is the Total
Current Assets figure from the Balance Sheet schedule divided by the Total
Current Liabilities figure. For example, the formula for the first period is
=C47/C60
The formula for the second period is
=D47/D60
and so on.
Quick Ratio
The Quick Ratio figures show the ratio of the sum of the cash and equiva-
lents plus the accounts receivable to the current liabilities. The quick ratio
provides a more stringent measure of a business’s ability to meet its short-
term financial obligations than other ratios. The Quick Ratio figure for each
Figure 2-6:

428
period is the sum of the Cash & Equivalents figure and the Accounts Receiv-
able figure divided by the Total Current Liabilities figure. For example, the
formula for the first period is
=(C43+C44)/C60
The formula for the second period is
=(D43+D44)/D60
and so on.
Working Capital to Total Assets
The Working Capital to Total Assets figures show the ratio of working capital
(the current assets minus the current liabilities) to the total assets. The
Working Capital to Total Assets ratio is another measure of a firm’s ability to
meet its financial obligations and gives an indication as to the distribution of
a business’s assets into liquid and nonliquid resources. The Working Capital
to Total Assets ratio for each period is calculated by dividing the difference
between the Current Assets and Current Liabilities figures by the Total
Assets figure. For example, the formula for the first period is
=(C47–C60)/C52
The formula for the second period is
=(D47–D60)/D52
and so on.
Receivables Turnover
The Receivables Turnover figures show the ratio of sales to the accounts
receivable balance. The Receivables Turnover ratio indicates the efficiency
of sales collections. One problem with the measure as it’s usually applied is
that both credit and cash sales may be included in the ratio denominator.
Two potential shortcomings exist with this approach. First, the presence of
the cash sales may make the receivables collections appear more efficient
than is the case. Also, mere changes in the mix of credit and cash sales may
affect the ratio, even though the efficiency of the receivables collections
process has not changed.
The Receivables Turnover figure for each period is calculated by dividing
the Sales Revenue figure for the period by the Accounts Receivable balance

outstanding at the end of the period. For example, the formula for the first
period is
=C100/C44
The formula for the second period is
=D100/D44
and so on.
Inventory Turnover
The Inventory Turnover row shows the ratio of the cost of sales to the inven-
tory balance. The Inventory Turnover ratio calculates how long inventory is
held. It can indicate depleted or excessive inventory balances. The Inventory
Turnover ratio for each period is calculated by dividing the Cost of Sales
figure for the period by the inventory held at the end of the period. For
example, the formula for the first period is
=–C101/C45
The formula for the second period is
=–D101/D45
and so on.
Times Interest Earned
The Times Interest Earned row shows the ratio of the sum of the net income
after taxes plus the interest income to the interest expense. The ratio indi-
cates the relative ease with which the business is paying its financing costs.
The Times Interest Earned ratio for each period is calculated by dividing the
sum of the Operating Income and Interest Income figures from the Income
Statement schedule by the Interest Expense figure. For example, the formula
for the first period is
=(C109+C111)/C112
The formula for the second period is
=(D109+D111)/D112
and so on.

Understanding the Workbook Calculations
430
Sales to Operational Assets
The Sales to Operational Assets row shows the ratio of sales revenue to net
plant, property, and equipment. The ratio indicates the efficiency with which
a business uses its operational assets to generate sales revenue. The Sales to
Operational Assets ratio for each period is the Sales Revenue figure that you
enter in the inputs area of the business planning starter workbook divided by
the Net Plant, Property, & Equipment figure from the Balance Sheet schedule.
For example, the formula for the first period is
=C100/C50
The formula for the second period is
=D100/D50
and so on.
Return on Total Assets
The Return on Total Assets row shows the ratio of the sum of the net income
after taxes plus the interest expense to the total assets for each period. The
ratio indicates the overall operating profitability of the business, expressed
as a rate of return on the business assets. The formula for the first period is
=(C16+C112)/C52
The formula for the second period is
=(D116+D112)/D52
and so on.
Return on Equity
The Return on Equity row shows the ratio of the net income after taxes to
the owner equity for each period. The ratio indicates the profitability of the
business as an investment of the owners. The Return on Equity ratio for
each period is the Net Income (Loss) After Taxes figure from the Income
Statement schedule divided by the Owner Equity figure from the Balance
Sheet schedule. For example, the formula for the first period is
=C116/C65
The formula for the second period is
=D116/D65
and so on.

Investment Turnover
The Investment Turnover row shows the ratio of the sales revenue to the
total assets. The ratio, like the Sales to Operational Assets ratio, indicates
the efficiency with which a business uses its assets (in this case, its total
assets) to generate sales. The Investment Turnover ratio for each period is
the Sales Revenue figure that you enter in the inputs area of the business
planning starter workbook divided by the Total Assets figure from the
Balance Sheet schedule. For example, the formula for the first period is
=C100/C52
The formula for the second period is
=D100/D52
and so on.
Financial Leverage
The Financial Leverage row shows the difference between the return on 
the owner equity and the return on the total assets. The ratio indicates the
increase or decrease in an equity return as a result of borrowing. A positive
value indicates an improvement in the return on owner equity by using
financial leverage; a negative value indicates deterioration in the return on
owner equity. The Financial Leverage figure for each period is the Return on
Total Assets figure minus the Return on Equity figure. For example, the for-
mula for the first period is
=C176–C175
The formula for the second period is
=D176–D175
and so on.
Customizing the Starter Workbook

However, you may want to change the starter workbook so that it more
closely matches your requirements. For example, you can add text that
describes your business and the forecasting horizon. You can also increase
or decrease the number of periods; for example, you can increase the number
of periods to 12 if your periods are months and you want to forecast an
entire year.

Customizing the Starter Workbook
432
Before you change anything on the starter workbook other than the forecast-
ing inputs, unprotect the document. To do this, choose the Tools➪Protection➪
Unprotect Worksheet command.
Unless you turn off cell protection, input cells in the inputs area of the 
business planning starter workbook are the only cells into which you can
enter data.
Changing the number of periods
You can easily increase or decrease the number of forecasting periods.
To increase the number of periods, remove the borders from the last column
and then copy the current last column to the right as needed.
To decrease the number of periods, simply delete any unnecessary columns
from the right side of the schedule. (To delete a column, highlight the entire
column by clicking at the top of that column, right-click to bring up Excel’s
context menu, and then choose Delete.) After you finish these steps, you can
replace the borders on the right and reinstate cell protection as needed.
Ratio analysis on existing financial statements
If you want to perform financial ratio analysis on a set of existing financial
statements, copy the contents of column C from the row in the inputs area of
the business plan workbook that contains the sales revenue forecast (row 31)
through the last row of the ratios table into column B. Then remove the
columns for periods 1 through 10 (columns C through L) by following the
steps described in the preceding section, “Changing the number of periods.”
Optionally, you can delete the Cash Flow Statement and add appropriate
column headings as needed.
To use the modified starter workbook, enter the necessary Balance Sheet
and Income Statement data in each of the unshaded cells in column B of the
inputs area of the business planning starter workbook. (Typically, the As Of
date of the Balance Sheet and the ending date of the Income Statement
period are the same.)
Calculating taxes for a current net loss before taxes
To calculate the income tax expense as 0 when there is a current period net
loss before income taxes, you edit the formula in the cell that calculates the
income tax expense (or savings) for the first period (cell C115) so that it
takes the maximum of the calculated expense amount or 0 by using the MAX
function:
=MAX(C37*C113,0)

Plan Forecast
Customizing the Starter Workbook
433
After you’ve done this, you can copy the formula into the rest of the cells in
the forecasting horizon that calculate the income tax expense (or savings).
To do this, select the cell with the formula you want to copy, choose Edit➪
Copy, select the range of cells into which you want to copy the formula, and
choose Edit➪Paste.
Combining this workbook with other workbooks
A quick and perhaps obvious point: You may want to construct other work-
books to supply numbers to the business plan workbook discussed in this
chapter. For example, you can construct an asset depreciation schedule that
uses the straight-line depreciation convention for a $25,000 asset represent-
ing your entire plant, property, and equipment investment and then use this
data in the business plan workbook.
If you start doing more Excel work and you’re not all that comfortable with
Excel, consider picking up a recent edition of Excel For Dummies, by Greg
Harvey (Wiley Publishing, Inc.). It’s a great tutorial on the basics. Also, if you
want more information about constructing supporting financial workbooks
(like an asset depreciation schedule, for example), you may want to visit my
Web site, www.stephenlnelson.com. On my free stuff page, I provide a
freebie PDF version of another book I’ve written, the MBA’s Guide to Microsoft
Excel (Redmond Technology Press). It describes how to do tasks like these.
If you want to use workbooks together in this manner, you should probably
combine the workbooks into a single workbook. The easiest way to copy one
of the workbooks is to copy the workbook’s worksheet to a blank worksheet
in the other workbook. (Each of the starter workbooks uses only a single
worksheet to make this process both easy and possible.)
If you want to combine an asset depreciation workbook with the business
planning workbook, for example, you can open both workbooks, copy the
asset depreciation worksheet to the Clipboard, add a new sheet to the busi-
ness planning starter workbook (by choosing the Insert menu’s Worksheet
command, for example), and then paste the asset depreciation worksheet
into the newly added, blank worksheet in the business plan workbook.

n Book VI, Chapter 2, I describe how to create a pro forma plan of busi-

create a forecast, you probably also want to create a companion business
plan. For this reason, you also need to know about writing such a plan. I
don’t go into tedious detail about how to do this; I just provide you with
some useful information about business plans — and I give you some tips
about how to more easily write a workable business plan.
What the Term Business Plan Means
In truth, the term business plan actually refers to three separate things:
✦A strategic plan: A discussion or description of a firm’s overall strategy
✦A new venture plan: The fund-raising document that entrepreneurs use
to promote a new venture to investors
✦A white paper plan: The 50-page or even 100-page document that a
business owner uses to describe in detail a new business opportunity,
including its risks, its opportunities, and anything else that’s germane
I talk a little bit about each of these plans — some more than others — in
the following pages.

A Few Words about Strategic Plans
436
A Few Words about Strategic Plans
Unfortunately, I’m not really equipped to provide you with detailed informa-
tion about how to construct a strategic plan. Of course, neither are most of
the other people who willingly offer advice. That said, however, I can provide
you with some useful starting points when constructing your strategic plan.
First off, the way that you’re using the word strategy is very likely wrong
because you aren’t talking about strategy at all. For my source on this per-
spective, I rely on what Michael E. Porter, a Harvard Business School profes-
sor, said in his strategy classic, Competitive Strategy: Techniques for Analyzing
Industries and Competitors (published by Free Press).
The really interesting thing that Porter says in his book — and something
that is worth repeating over and over again — is that, practically speaking,
only three basic business strategies exist:
✦A cost strategy
✦A differentiated product or service strategy
✦A focus on a niche strategy
Because understanding these strategies is critical to writing a good strategic
plan (and to correctly using the term strategy), in the following section, I
briefly discuss in my own words what Porter means by limiting possible
strategies to only three. I demonstrate each of these strategies by using
example firms in an industry that we’re all pretty familiar with — retailing.
Cost strategies
Successful retailers rely on a cost strategy. Firms such as Wal-Mart and
Costco excel at economically providing products to their customers. They
pass along a lot of the benefits of this economy to their customers in the
form of lower prices. Not all the cost savings get passed along to the con-
sumers, however. A significant portion of the cost savings, achieved through
incredibly efficient operations, are retained by the business and, therefore,
become profits.
Such cost leadership or low-cost operation is one of the three basic strate-
gies. And it is a strategy available to any business — and particularly those
businesses that have achieved economies to scale.
The key thing to note about a low-cost strategy, however, is that the firm
needs to retain some of the cost savings in order to earn a higher profit level
than its competitors. Thus, simply being a low-cost producer isn’t enough. A

Book VI
Chapter 3
Writing a 
Business Plan
Look, Ma: No Strategy
437
firm needs to be a low-cost producer and still be able to price products and
services at a level high enough that some of the cost savings are retained as
profits.
Differentiated products and services strategies
The second basic strategy is product differentiation. Product differentiators
often sell a very unusual product or service. The Nordstrom department
store chain is a good example of this because it offers unsurpassed service,
and often (although not always), it offers a great and high-quality selection
of items. However, Nordstrom goods cost more. But consumers happily pay
the extra amount. Why? Because they get so much more for their money.
A firm that relies on a differentiation strategy competes on the basis of the
special features of their products or services. The key to making this strat-
egy work is being able to charge your customers more for those special fea-
tures than the special features cost you. Differentiation needs to produce
increased revenues in excess of increased costs.
Focus strategies
The focus strategy is really a hybrid of the cost and differentiation strate-
gies. This strategy states that in some ways, a firm is really good about man-
aging costs; and in other ways, this firm is really good about differentiating
products or services. A firm may choose to take this hybrid approach because
it understands a particular audience or niche of customers or category of
products; in other words, the firm can, through this focused approach, serve
a particular market better than anybody else. This firm is going to be the
best at serving a particular niche. Again, as is the case with other strategies,
the focus strategy must produce increased revenues that are greater than
the increased cost of the strategy or cost savings (to the business) that are
greater than the lower prices passed along to customers.
So, who’s a focus strategy retailer? I would say that Target is. Target, in my
opinion, focuses on suburban, middle-class customers by offering those con-
sumers almost the perfect combination of cost savings and differentiated
products.
Look, Ma: No Strategy
This all probably sounds like gobbledygook if you haven’t been exposed to
much strategic thinking before. However, the strategies and their strengths
become very clear when you compare firms that have these strategies —
cost leaders such as Wal-Mart and Costco, differentiation leaders such as
Nordstrom, and focus leaders such as Target — to firms that lack a clear
strategic focus.

Look Ma: No Strategy
438
Perhaps the best-known, current example of the retailer that, in my opinion,
lacks a clear-cut strategy is Kmart. This becomes very clear when you start
comparing Kmart with the leaders in each of the three strategies. Consider
the following three problems that Kmart is plagued by:
✦Kmart can’t compete on cost. If you are really concerned about cost, 
you can go someplace like Wal-Mart or Costco and get a better price
than you can get at Kmart. So Kmart loses cost-conscious customers 
to Wal-Mart and Costco.
✦Kmart can’t compete with differentiation. Sure, Kmart offers Martha
Stewart products, which sounds like differentiation, right? But face it: If
you really want a highly differential product — the best in the class —
you aren’t going to go to Kmart. Here, Kmart loses out to stores like Nord-
strom, which charge higher prices but offer a wider range of differenti-
ated products. If you want the best in class, you won’t end up at Kmart —
you’ll go to a firm that’s emphasizing and excelling at this strategy.
✦Kmart doesn’t have a particular focus. Does Kmart serve a particular
niche better than anybody else? I don’t know. But at least in the category
of suburban middle-class consumers, Target probably does a much better
job. If you’re really looking for clothes or household items appropriate in
a middle-class suburb, is there any question that Target beats the pants
off of Kmart? I don’t think so.
So now you can see how the word strategy is misunderstood and used incor-
rectly. Strategy isn’t a way to refer to some idea you have; strategy, in busi-
ness, refers to one of three approaches toward beating your competition:
cost, differentiation (probably in terms of product excellence), or focus.
And here’s the key: If you can do a strategy better than anybody else can,
you win. If you try to do a little bit of this or a little bit of that, or if you
ignore or can’t bring yourself to pick a particular strategy, you’re going to be
continually beaten up by firms that have picked a strategy. You lose the cost
game to the cost leaders. You lose the differentiation game to the differentia-
tors. And you lose out at competing in particular niches to those firms that
focus on those niches.
Two comments about tactics
I won’t talk anymore about this strategy business, but I have a couple of
comments about tactics. Most of the time when you hear people talk about
strategy, they’re not really talking about strategy; they’re usually talking
about tactics.

Book VI
Chapter 3
Writing a 
Business Plan
Look, Ma: No Strategy
439
Tactics refers to choices that firms make in an attempt to successfully exe-
cute strategy. The irony is that the people who misuse the word strategy (by
referring to tactics as strategy) often don’t really have a strategy. This is my
first comment.
My second comment is that tactics, predictably, don’t work and don’t make
sense except as support for a particular strategy. For example, to pursue a
strategy of cost leadership, all your tactics need to support that strategy.
You undermine your success in executing that strategy if some tactics sup-
port a cost strategy, some tactics support a differentiation strategy, and
some tactics support a focus strategy. This makes sense, right? In this situa-
tion, you become a jack-of-all-trades but a master of none.
Six final strategy pointers
Before you move on to the next topic, be sure you understand these key
points:
✦A firm can only have one of three business strategies:
• Cost-based strategy
• Differentiation-based strategy
• Focus-based strategy
✦The only appropriate tactics are those that support one of these 
strategies.
✦The first step — the step that you take before you can select appropriate
tactics — is picking a strategy. From the strategy decision, all other tacti-
cal decisions follow.
✦A strategic plan, therefore, must have a clearly defined strategy. It must
then identify, or enumerate, the tactics that support the strategy. It’s
really as simple as that.
✦The hard part of writing a strategic plan is to discipline yourself (or the
firm) to pick a strategy and then stick with it. Few firms want to be disci-
plined to stick with a hard-core strategy of cost, product differentiation,
or focus. It’s all too easy to slip-slide your way into a situation where you
are trying to be a little of this or a little of that. Picking a particular strat-
egy means that you forgo certain kinds of opportunities and that you say
no to some customers and certain kinds of products.
✦It’s a difficult book to read, and much of the material is a couple of
decades old, but Michael Porter’s book on competitive strategy is worth-
while reading for any business owner. It won’t be much fun, but I feel
very confident that the 15 or 20 hours necessary for reading the book
constitute an enormously useful investment of your time.

Writing a White Paper Business Plan
440
Writing a White Paper Business Plan
People often write a white paper business plan when they know that they
need a strategic plan but don’t really want to make the hard decisions neces-
sary for a strategic plan. The person in this conundrum writes a lengthy
white paper business plan to camouflage the absent strategic plan.
I guess it’s obvious from the preceding paragraph, but you really should write
a strategic plan before you write a white paper business plan. A strategic plan,
by the way, doesn’t need to be more than a page or two in length. In fact, the
hard part of a strategic plan isn’t in the writing; it’s in the sacrifice — the
giving up of certain categories of opportunities, certain markets, and certain
tactical approaches that may be comfortable or familiar. Obviously, you can’t
write a good white paper business plan — or at least one that’s based on a
sound strategy — until you first have a strategic plan in place.
Perhaps the most important thing to know when you write a white paper
business plan is this: This process is well-documented in a bunch of other
places. If you have QuickBooks Premier 2007, you can choose the Company➪
Planning & Budgeting➪Use Business Plan Tool command to start a wizard
that steps you through the process of writing a white paper business plan
(see Figure 3-1).

I’m not going to show more of this wizard here or talk more about the
wizard. (You can use the wizard to see what it does.)
You can also get detailed information on writing a business plan in both
English and Spanish from the United States Federal Government Small
Business Administration’s Web site at
www.sba.gov/starting_business/planning/basic.html
Figure 3-2 shows the Startup Basics page of the Small Business Administra-
tion’s Web site. Figure 3-3 shows the first page of information that the Small
Business Administration’s Web site provides about the process of writing a
business plan.
The Small Business Administration’s Web site changes, predictably, but you
should be able to hunt down its links to relevant business planning topics,
such as “business plan basics,” “writing the plan,” and “using the plan.”

I should also point out that Microsoft PowerPoint (which many computer
users own because PowerPoint is a component in just about every version of
Microsoft Office) supplies a detailed outline for creating a white paper busi-
ness plan. Figure 3-4 shows the AutoContent Wizard dialog box, which you
use to indicate how you want to create a business plan presentation. Figure
3-5 shows, in the form of a Word document, what PowerPoint suggests for
white paper business plans. This is a very good outline, so don’t be misled
into thinking that something that Microsoft has provided for free to Power-
Point users is in some way inferior to what real businesses use. Microsoft
has done an excellent job in showing what information belongs in a white
paper business plan.
Most white paper business plans and new venture business plans (which I
define in the next section) require a business pro forma financial forecast.
Book VI, Chapter 2 describes how to do this. Typically, in a hard-copy
printed business plan, you include such a forecast as an appendix.
After you create a good solid strategy and, at least, a rough white paper busi-
ness plan, you may also want to create a new venture plan. The next section
describes how to do this.

Writing a New Venture Plan
To write a new venture plan, you take a different approach than you do when
writing a white paper plan. New venture plans answer five basic questions,
which provide prospective investors with the necessary information to
determine whether they should further investigate your venture as a possi-
ble investment. The next sections detail these five questions.
Is the new venture’s product or service feasible?
In some cases, this question is unnecessary to ask. However, it’s important
to consider in any case where a firm may invest in a new, unproven idea.
This situation is most clearly illustrated in the case of a firm that plans to
build and then market some newfangled technology. For example, if you’re
thinking of starting a firm that will produce a better mousetrap, a key ques-
tion to ask is whether you really can build a better mousetrap. You can
answer this question in a couple of ways, practically speaking. Obviously,
the best way to answer this question about feasibility is to build the better
mousetrap first. Having built the better mousetrap, you’ll find it easy to
prove to prospective investors that, yes, the product is feasible. You can set
your mousetrap on the desk and demonstrate how it works. Perhaps on
some . . . no, no, let’s not go there.
Figure 3-4:

tation.

Writing a New Venture Plan
444
If a product hasn’t already been built or a service hasn’t already been proven
to be deliverable, the next best approach — and the one commonly used by
technology startups — is to assemble a team of people who’ve built similar
products in the past. The logic of this approach is that if you have a team
that has built similar technologies in the past, investors can probably rely on
this team’s track record of success. For example, if a team of talented engi-
neers has built new and improved mousetraps, it’s very easy for investors to
prudently believe that this team may be able to build a better mousetrap in
the future. The team understands the technology. They understand the prob-
lem. They’re experienced in creating new solutions to address the problem.
You see how easy it is to buy into the possibility.
Does the market want the product or service?
Assuming that you do have a firm with a practical, feasible product or serv-
ice, you need to ask another big question right up front: Do people really,
truly want the product or service? Is there public demand for the firm’s
offering? This business about demand seems kind of tricky to ascertain.
Ideally, a new venture proves that demand exists by already having cus-
tomers buying the product. If a new venture hasn’t yet finished the product
or service, such hard-and-fast proof of demand is impossible to come by. In
Figure 3-5:
The
PowerPoint

template.

Book VI
Chapter 3
Writing a 
Business Plan
Writing a New Venture Plan
445
this case, you have another option: You can prove market demand by run-
ning independent market research studies to say, “Yes, we’ve run several
focus groups, and people say they’ll buy a better mousetrap.”
Sometimes, you can also prove market demand by showing that consumers
or businesses already purchase a similar product or service and would, logi-
cally, purchase a clearly improved version of the product or service. For
example, in the case of the better mousetrap, people are already buying a lot
of mousetraps. So if you truly did build better mousetraps, you could pretty
much prove market demand by demonstrating the new product’s superiority.
However, let me encourage you to take a big bite of the reality sandwich if
you’re thinking this way. You need to be very careful about this issue of
market demand because it’s all too easy for entrepreneurs and inventors
who are excited about some new technology, or some new product or serv-
ice, to assume that consumers really will want the new thing that is being
built or offered. Consumers are notoriously fickle. What seems like a wonder-
ful innovation to the entrepreneur or inventor often isn’t so wonderful in the
eyes of the consumer.
Can the product or service be profitably sold?
Okay, so the first two questions ask whether a product or service is feasible
and whether people want the product. Is that enough? No, actually it isn’t.
The third, critically important question is whether the product that you’re
selling can profitably be sold. You must run rough numbers to prove that
products or services revenue less the cost of goods sold produces a gross
margin that is adequate not just to pay the operating expenses of the firm
but to retain something for profit. This proof that the firm can profitably sell
its product or service is really achieved by the business pro forma financial
forecast (as described in Book VI, Chapter 2). This forecast proves that the
firm can be profitable by selling the product or service.
I won’t say a lot more about this profitability issue, but basically, all the
accounting stuff discussed throughout this book comes into play here. In
order to do a decent new venture plan, you need to understand enough
accounting in order to produce a set of forward-looking financial statements
that persuasively argue a profitable venture.
Is the return on the venture adequate 
for prospective investors?
Curiously, simply proving that a firm’s venture will be profitable often isn’t
enough. A firm also needs to deliver profits at least equal to and, ideally, in
excess of the return on investment that the investors desire. In the case of a

Writing a New Venture Plan
446
new venture, investors have pretty firm expectations of what a risky invest-
ment should deliver. Angel investors commonly require rates of return in the
neighborhood of 20 to 25 percent annually. Small business entrepreneurs
and business owners, similarly, often require similar rates of return. Institu-
tional and professional venture capital investors (the sort of people that 
you read about in The Wall Street Journal and in Inc magazine) often require
annual rates of return of 45 percent to 55 percent — or even 65 percent
annually.
If you think about what all this means, you can quickly see that even a pretty
darn good business that delivers the 30 to 35 percent annual rate of return —
and that’s really good if you think about it — won’t be enough for some
investors. An institutional venture capital investor who needs, for example, 
a 50 percent annual return on his investment, isn’t going to look seriously 
at anything that produces only a meager 30 percent annual return.
Essentially, in a new venture plan, you provide information that lets the
prospective investor figure out the rate of return. The prospective investor
can then compare this return with his or her requirements.
It’s not a bad idea to look at the returns that you are implicitly suggesting via
your new venture plan. Make sure that you are not trying to sell a 25 percent
annual return investment to investors who require a 50 percent annual return.
Similarly, you may not need to offer investors who will be happy with a 25
percent annual return a deal that pays a 50 percent annual return. Book V,
Chapter 2 offers a discussion of economic value-added analysis that details
how you can compare the return delivered by a firm to investors with the
return on investment that those investors expect.
Can existing management run the business?
Even if you have a venture based on a feasible product or technology, even if
you have customers who are hysterically excited to purchase your product,
even if you have a product or service that will bring in a massive profit, and
even if your investors will be able to earn a wonderful return on their invest-
ment, that’s still not enough. A new venture plan still must ask and answer
one other critical question.
Any new venture plan needs to sell prospective investors on the idea that
the existing management team — which includes the founder or president
and his or her lieutenants or vice presidents — can successfully operate the
business. In other words, even a great business opportunity requires a good
management team in place (or almost in place), ready to execute the busi-
ness plan.

Book VI
Chapter 3
Writing a 
Business Plan
Writing a New Venture Plan
447
Here are a couple of ways that you can prove that the management team
isn’t going to be a problem:
✦Have a management team in place that has already successfully exe-
cuted a venture similar to the new venture. If you’re trying to sell
prospective investors on the idea that the management team can create
a $25,000,000 business selling a better mousetrap, your task will be much
easier if the same management team at some point in the past created a
$25,000,000 business selling a better mousetrap.
✦Show that the management team — or at least most of its members —
are successful people. A team of people who have succeeded at big
things in the past suggests to investors that the management team
knows how to win. I’m not talking about an Eagle Scout designation; I’m
thinking more on the line of an M.B.A. from Stanford. If some members of
your team have created a new cool technology or successfully managed
an important division in another business, in a nutshell, you’re saying to
prospective investors, “Hey, this management team will bring home a
win for us.”
Some final thoughts
Okay, I have a handful of final comments to make about new venture busi-
ness planning:
✦Although new venture business plans really serve a different purpose
than white paper business plans, you use the same sort of general out-
line for both. In other words, even though a new venture business plan
has as its primary purpose answering the five questions discussed in the
previous section, you follow an outline like the one provided by
Microsoft PowerPoint (refer to Figure 3-4).
✦Although you definitely want to make sure that your new venture busi-
ness plan answers the five questions, keep in mind the following caveats:
• Don’t lay it on too thick. You want to write something that looks like a
white paper business plan but edit it well in order to both minimize
the amount of super-detailed information and to clearly and boldly
answer the five questions that the new venture investor needs to ask
and have answered.
• Remember that a new venture investor is typically not going to write
you a check based on what he or she sees in a new venture business
plan. What you put into a new venture business plan is simply infor-
mation that will tickle the new venture investor’s fancy. The informa-
tion should be just enough to make him or her think, “This sounds
pretty cool. I’ll take a closer look.”

Writing a New Venture Plan
448
• It’s very unlikely that any entrepreneur or business owner can honestly
answer all five questions with a “Yes.” Some people will say that you
need to offer a dynamite, ironclad, super deal that nobody could
refuse. However, in my opinion, any sophisticated new venture
investor who expects you to be able to answer with a 100-percent-
guaranteed “Yes” to every question is probably pretty naive. Anybody
who has half a clue knows that risk exists in any business venture.
Even if you have a great technology that’s already built, customers
clamoring with orders in the reception area of your office, and a great
management team in place — even if everything seems perfect —
stuff still goes wrong.
Having said that, however, note that answering any of the five ques-
tions with a definite “No” means that the new venture won’t work —
or at least it won’t work for you as the business owner or as the man-
ager. Each of the five questions is a link in the chain of success. Break
any link — regardless of which one — and the chain breaks.
All business advisors, entrepreneurs, and business owners need to admit that
the hysteria and bubble thinking of the 1990s was not at all representative 
of the way business planning is supposed to work. Many dot-com ventures
were funded with enormous amounts of money even though the entrepre-
neurs and new venture investors could only answer a single question — if
that — with a “Yes” answer. But that was a different time (a crazy time), and
the rules during those few turbulent years were different. Prudently starting
any new venture requires answering “Yes” to most of the five questions dis-
cussed here. And in the end, the bursting of the dot-com bubble only goes to
prove that.

T
he subject of setting up a peer-to-peer network may seem off-point. Isn’t
this book supposed to be about QuickBooks? Well, my friend, you’re
right on both accounts. Networking is a little off-point, and this book is
about QuickBooks.
However, I want to provide you with this quick overview of setting up your
network anyway. For one thing, in many small business settings, you’ll find it
extremely useful to set up a network. (A network is simply a group of com-
puters that are connected and that can communicate and share resources.)
For another thing, if you want to let more than one person work with the
QuickBooks data file, you can do so simply by setting up a network and then
installing QuickBooks on each computer.
Therefore, in this chapter, I explain how to set up a small Windows XP 
network — just the kind that you may want to use in a business with a 
handful of computer users working in the office. In Book VII, Chapter 2, I
explain how to administer a QuickBooks accounting system — including the
stuff that you need to do in order to have several different people working
on different computers on a network and with the same QuickBooks data.
Can I share an opinion? These days, a computer network in a business is not
just something that’s nice to have; it’s a necessity if you have more than one
computer. A network will save you time and, therefore, save you money. No
kidding.

What Is a Peer-to-Peer Network?
452
Can Your Business Benefit from a Network?
Should you set up your own network? How do you know if a network can
benefit your business? To consider this question, take a look at some of the
things that even a small network makes possible:
✦You can open files, folders, and applications on one computer while
you’re sitting at another computer.
✦You can share a single printer among several computers.
✦You can share an Internet connection.
✦You can back up important files and folders to another computer.
✦You can communicate with other users on the network via e-mail and
conferencing applications.
Not to beat a dead horse, but truly, after you set up your network, you’ll
wonder how you ever got along without it.
What Is a Peer-to-Peer Network?
Networks are of two basic types: client/server and peer-to-peer. In a
client/server network, one (or more) computer stores resources and sup-
plies; it serves those resources to the other computers. All the other comput-
ers are connected to this central computer(s), which manages applications,
files, printers, and so on. In general, big monster corporate networks are
client/server networks and are managed by a system administrator.
In a peer-to-peer network, all computers are equals. Each computer has its
own hard drive and can see and talk to all the other computers on the net-
work. In addition, each computer can share its resources, such as a CD-ROM
drive, a printer, files, folders, applications, and so on. A peer-to-peer network
is ideal if you have no more than, say, ten people in the office working on a
computer. On a peer-to-peer network, all users decide which of their files
and folders they want to share and with whom.
You can connect the computers in a peer-to-peer network in several ways:
✦Use the electrical or telephone wiring already installed in your office.
✦Install a wireless system.
✦Connect each computer on the network to a central hub.
Connecting to a central hub is the easiest configuration, and it’s also 
inexpensive. In this chapter, therefore, I walk you through the process of

Book VII
Chapter 1
Setting Up a Peer-
to-Peer Network
Hardware Requirements
453
connecting a network of computers to a central hub. The process consists of
three basic steps:
✦Connecting all the necessary hardware
✦Configuring your host computer
✦Configuring all the other computers on your network
Throughout this chapter, I show you how.
Just for the sake of thoroughness, let me also say that you can create a simple
wireless peer-to-peer network, too. With a wireless network, you don’t cable
your computers together using wires and a central hub. Instead, the comput-
ers on the network communicate through a hub (actually called a wireless
router, but who cares) using radio waves. In fact, in a wireless network, no kid-
ding, little radio antennas often stick out the back of computers and the hub! 
A wireless network is very convenient in a peer-to-peer setting because you
don’t have to worry about tripping over network cabling. However, a wireless
network requires a bit more fiddling in order to get your network secure. (If
you’re not careful, anyone else with one of those little antennas on the back of
his computer can sneak into your network.) For this reason, I’m not going to
discuss the wireless option here. If you’re interested in going wireless, find a
local networking consultant and ask her to make your network wireless.
Hardware Requirements
You need three essential components to set up your wired network:
✦The hub or a router
✦Some cable
✦A network interface card (NIC) in each computer
A hub is the central device that connects all the computers on the network,
and it is slightly smaller than the size of this book. The hub itself doesn’t
require any software or configuration; it is simply the device that allows all
the computers to communicate. The number of connections on the hub —
or the number of places to which you can connect — determines the number
of computers that can be on the network. Be sure to buy a hub that has
enough connections for the number of computers that you want to connect.
Cables are the physical connection between the computers on the network
and the hub. The cable, or more specifically Ethernet cable, attaches to the
network hardware with RJ-45 jacks, which are snap connectors that look like
a wider version of the plastic jacks used by your landline phone system.
Cables are commonly available in lengths of 10, 15, 20, 25, and 50 feet.

Connecting Your Network Hardware
454
A NIC goes into each computer on the network and connects to one of the
slots on the computer’s motherboard. (The motherboard is the main printed
circuit board in a computer.) Most computers on the market today come
with NICs already installed, but if you are networking older computers, you
will probably need to buy NICs.
If you have older computers that you want to network, be sure to check
them for two things before you purchase any NICs. First, verify that the
motherboard has an empty slot, and second, verify that the slots are of the
Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) type. Some older computers use
Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) slots, and it’s just about impossible to
find an ISA NIC these days.
You can shop for these items at your local electronics store or on the
Internet. Another option is to buy a starter kit that contains everything that
you need to connect a couple of computers — NICs, cable, and a hub — from
companies such as Intel (www.intel.com), Linksys (www.linksys.com/
products), 3Com (www.3com.com), or Netgear (www.netgear.com). If you
need to connect more than two computers, however, you’ll probably save
money if you buy the parts separately rather than buying multiple kits.
Before you buy your NICs and hub, be sure that the packaging explicitly
states that the hardware has been certified by Microsoft as being suitable for
Windows XP. If you are in doubt, check Microsoft’s Hardware Compatibility
List at www.microsoft.com/whdc/hcl.
Connecting Your Network Hardware
Setting up your network hardware is easy. Get yourself the appropriate
screwdriver, and follow these steps:
1. Turn off all computers and peripherals and unplug them.
2. For each computer, open the case (this is likely to be the most difficult
step), remove the slot cover from a free expansion slot, and insert the
NIC in the empty slot, according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Would it be terribly redundant if I repeated that last bit of information?
You need to follow the manufacturer’s instructions. Seriously. Also, be
sure that the card bracket is sitting snugly in the case and secure it with
the screw that originally held the slot cover.
3. Replace the case.
4. Find a good central location for the hub and plug the power adapter
into a power socket.

Book VII
Chapter 1
Setting Up a Peer-
to-Peer Network
Configuring Your Host Computer
455
A central location helps to keep cable lengths short, and most of the
time, you won’t need access to the hub unless you experience a problem
with the network. Most hubs have small LEDs on the front of the case
that indicate network activity, and it can be comforting to glance across
at them to see that the network is still running.
5. Connect one end of the cable to the NIC and connect the other end of
the cable to the hub, starting with the first connection.
Do this for each computer on the network. Both ends of the cable are
identical, so it doesn’t matter which end you connect to the computer or
the hub.
6. Turn on the hub and all connected computers.
You’ll see a light or LED on the hub for each connected computer.
That’s it. Now you’re ready to configure your network software.
Honestly, just between you, me, and the piano, connecting the hardware isn’t
that tough. I’m with you. Networking computer hardware just ain’t that tough
any more.
Configuring Your Host Computer
After you connect all your hardware, you need to give Windows XP some
information about the network that you’ve just set up. Before you start,
though, you need to decide which of the computers on your network will
host Internet Connection Sharing (ICS). With ICS turned on, all the computers
on the network can access the Internet even though they don’t have direct
connections. The host computer must meet the following requirements:
✦Run Windows XP
✦Be turned on at all times so that the other computers on the network
can access the Internet
If one of your networked computers has an existing DSL hookup or a cable
modem, that computer is an excellent choice to be the ICS host.
To configure your network, be sure that you’re logged on as Computer
Administrator and then, at the computer that will host ICS, follow these
steps:
1. Choose Start➪All Programs➪Accessories➪Communications➪Network
Setup Wizard to start the Network Setup Wizard.
The Welcome screen appears.
2. Click Next.

3. Click Checklist for Creating a Network to display a help page summa-
rizing the steps in network planning that I discuss earlier in this chap-
ter, or click Next.
The Select Connection Method screen appears (see Figure 1-1).
4. Select This Computer Connects Directly to the Internet, and then 
click Next.
The Select Your Internet Connection screen appears.
5. Select the connection that you want to use when you connect to the
Internet (modem, local area connection, and so on) and click Next.
The dialog box lists connections that are already set up, so what you see
here will make sense to you when you do this.
6. In the Give This Computer a Description and Name screen (see 
Figure 1-2), enter a short text description for the computer in the
Computer Description field and then click Next.
The Name Your Network screen appears.
(The Computer Name box holds the name that you gave to this com-
puter when you installed Windows XP. It’s best to retain this name.)
7. Enter a Workgroup name, and then click Next.
The Ready to Apply Network Settings screen appears, as shown in 
Figure 1-3.

8. Review the selections that you have made and click Next if those set-
tings are correct.
The wizard will apply these settings when you click Next. After the
process starts, don’t interrupt it. You’ll see a progress indicator.
If you need to change any settings, click Back to return to the screen
that you want to change. After the wizard has done its work, the You’re
Almost Done screen appears (see Figure 1-4).
9. (Optional) In the You’re Almost Done screen (see Figure 1-4), you can
create a Network Setup Disk with which to configure the other com-
puters on your network.

Configuring Other Windows Computers on the Network
458
If the other computers that you are networking are running a version of
Windows earlier than XP, you’ll need the setup disk. If the other comput-
ers are running Windows XP, you won’t need the setup disk. If you choose
the Create a Network Setup Disk option, follow the instructions on the
screen and click Next.
10. Close the Network Setup Wizard by clicking Finish.
After you’ve configured your host computer, you’re ready to configure the
rest of the computers on your network.
Configuring Other Windows Computers on the Network
You can use the Network Setup Wizard to configure other computers on the
network if they are running any of the following:
✦Windows XP
✦Windows 98
✦Windows 98 Second Edition
✦Windows 2000
✦Windows Millennium Edition
On other computers running Windows XP, configure the network connection
by running the Network Setup Wizard as directed in the previous section,
“Configuring Your Host Computer.” On computers running the other versions
of Windows listed here, you also use the Network Setup Wizard, but you
have to first insert the Network Setup Disk. Follow these steps:

Installing and Using a Networked Printer
459
1. Insert the Network Setup Disk in the floppy drive.
2. Open Windows Explorer to the floppy drive, and double-click the
Netsetup (or Netsetup.exe) file.
This launches the Network Setup Wizard.
3. In the first screen of the wizard, click Yes when asked if you want to
install network support files on your system.
4. At the next screen, remove the floppy disk and click OK.
5. The next screen asks if you want to restart your computer. Click Yes.
6. After the restart, the wizard displays the Welcome to the Network
Setup Wizard screen. Follow the instructions in the wizard.
Installing and Using a Networked Printer
One of the most common reasons for setting up a network is to share a
printer. You can physically connect a printer to your network in a couple 
of ways:
✦If your printer doesn’t have a NIC in it, connect the printer to one of the
computers on the network and turn on the printer. (This is more common
in a small network and is the kind of printer described in this section.)
✦If your printer has a NIC in it, you can connect it directly by running a
cable to the network hub. (This configuration is found more commonly
in a corporate environment. This section doesn’t cover this kind of
setup.)
Before you can set up a shared printer, you must install it as a local printer. If
you’ve already installed a local printer, skip to the section “Sharing Resources
on the Network,” later in this chapter. If you haven’t set up a local printer,
connect the printer to the computer, turn it on, log on to that computer as
Computer Administrator, and then follow these steps:
1. Choose Start➪Control Panel➪Printers and Faxes to open the Printers
and Faxes folder.
2. Click the Add a Printer button to start the Add Printer Wizard.
The Welcome screen appears.
3. Click Next.
4. In the next Add Printer Wizard screen, select Local Printer Attached
To This Computer and click Next.

Sharing Resources on the Network
460
5. In the next Add Printer Wizard screen that appears, enter a name for
the printer, and click Next.
6. Click Yes if you want this printer set as the default.
7. Click Next, review your choices, and then click Finish to close the
wizard.
Now you are ready to share this printer with other users on the network.
Follow these steps:
1. In the Printers and Faxes folder (accessed by choosing Start➪Control
Panel➪Printers and Faxes), right-click the icon for your printer, and
choose Sharing from the shortcut menu.
This opens the Properties dialog box at the Sharing tab for that printer.
If you will be sharing a printer with users who are running a different
version of Windows, click the Additional Drivers button on the Sharing
tab to open the Additional Drivers dialog box. Select the check boxes for
all the versions of Windows that will be sharing this printer, and then
click OK.
2. Accept the name that is generated in the Share Name field, or enter a
new name, and then click OK.
Click the General tab if you want to enter a description of this printer in
the Comment field. Sometimes you use this field to describe the printer’s
location. Click Apply.
You now see a hand under the icon for this printer in the Printer and
Faxes folder, indicating that this printer is shared.
One final task remains, and that is to run the Add Printer Wizard on the
other computers on the network so that each can access the shared printer.
In the Local or Network Printer screen, select the A Network Printer or A
Printer Attached To Another Computer radio button, click Next, and then
follow the remainder of the wizard’s instructions.
Sharing Resources on the Network
Before users on your network can share resources — drives, files, folders,
applications, and so on — the resources must be enabled for sharing. Each
user at each workstation must specifically share the resources on that com-
puter. To mark resources as shared, follow these steps:
1. Right-click the Start button, and then click Explore to open Explorer.

Book VII
Chapter 1
Setting Up a Peer-
to-Peer Network
Sharing Resources on the Network
461
2. Navigate to the resource that you want to share, right-click it, and
choose Sharing from the shortcut menu to open a Properties dialog
box at the Sharing tab (see Figure 1-5).
3. Select the Share This Folder radio button.
In the Share Name box, accept the name that Windows suggests or enter
another name.
This name must be unique on this computer, and it is the name that
others on the network will see when they browse this computer.
4. Enter a comment by briefly describing the share in the Comment box.
Users will also use this information when browsing the network.
5. In the User Limit area, select either the Maximum Allowed or Allow
This Number of Users radio button to specify the maximum number of
simultaneous users.
Windows allows a maximum of ten users. When the eleventh user tries
to log on, she will see this message: “No more connections can be made
to this remote computer at this time because there are already as many
connections as the computer allows.”
6. To specify the kind of access that users have to this resource, click 
the Permissions button to open the Permissions dialog box for this
resource. To set a permission, select its check box. After you’re fin-
ished, click OK.
Figure 1-5:

Sharing tab.

Accessing Shared Resources
462
For an explanation of the types of permissions, see the Help and Support
Center. Note that you can set permissions for a resource only if you are
using the NTFS file system, which is Windows’ high security file system.
Note that you can check whether your disk uses NTFS by clicking on the
General tab and looking at the description.
7. Close the Properties dialog box by clicking OK.
Accessing Shared Resources
To access a shared resource on the network, open Explorer, and click the plus
sign next to My Network Places to display a list of all the shared computers,
hard drives, and folders. Simply navigate to the resource that you want to
access and open it as you would any resource on your own computer.
If you frequently use a particular network resource, you can access it quickly
by mapping a network drive to it. That resource then appears in Explorer as
though it were a drive on your own computer. To map a drive, follow these
steps:
1. Click the Start button, right-click My Network Places, and choose Map
Network Drive from the shortcut menu to open the Map Network Drive
dialog box.
2. In the Drive drop-down list box, click the down arrow, and select an
unused letter.
The default is the next drive in sequence.
3. Tell Windows whether you want to map to this drive whenever you
log on.
4. Windows automatically remaps drives for you each time you log on. 
If you don’t want to reconnect to this drive the next time you log on,
deselect the Reconnect at Logon check box.
5. In the Folder drop-down list, enter the path to the share, or click
Browse to locate it.
6. Click Finish.
Now, the mapped drive appears just like any other drive in Explorer.
You can use the Windows Troubleshooters to track down problems with
your network. Click the Start button, and open Help and Support. Click
Fixing a Problem, and then choose Networking Problems. You’ll find the
usual question-and-answer screens.

Chapter 2: Administering
QuickBooks
In This Chapter
 Keeping your data confidential
 Using QuickBooks in a multi-user environment
 Closing QuickBooks
 Using QuickBooks for simultaneous multi-user access
 Maintaining good accounting controls
QuickBooks does something that is critically important to the success of
your business: It collects and supplies financial information. For this
reason, you want to have a firm understanding of how you can protect both
the data that QuickBooks collects and stores and the assets that
QuickBooks tracks. This chapter describes all this.
Keeping Your Data Confidential
Accounting data is often confidential information. Your QuickBooks data
shows how much money you have in the bank, what you owe creditors, and
how much (or how little!) profit your firm produces. Because this informa-
tion is private, your first concern in administering a QuickBooks accounting
system is to keep your data confidential.
You have two complementary methods for keeping your QuickBooks data
confidential. The first method for maintaining confidentiality relies on the
security features built into Microsoft Windows. The other method relies on
QuickBooks security features.
Using Windows security
You can use the security provided by Microsoft Windows 2000 or Microsoft
Windows XP to restrict access to a file — either a program file or a data 
file — to specific users. This means that you can use Windows-level security
to say who can and can’t use the QuickBooks program or access the Quick-
Books data file.

Keeping Your Data Confidential
464
I don’t describe how Windows-level security works in this book. If you are
already employing Windows-level security, you (or someone in your office)
know how to use that tool to prevent unauthorized access to (or the use of)
program files and data files. To use Windows-level security for QuickBooks,
you can simply apply your existing general knowledge to the QuickBooks
program file or the QuickBooks data file.
If you aren’t already using the Windows-level security, you don’t need to go
to the trouble of learning Windows’ complicated security system. You can
use the simpler QuickBooks security.
Using QuickBooks security
You can protect the confidentiality of your QuickBooks data by assigning a
password to a QuickBooks company data file. You can do this during the
QuickBooks setup process. You can also set up a password by choosing the
Company menu’s Change Your Password command. When you choose this
command, QuickBooks displays the Change Password dialog box, which (I’m
not kidding) QuickBooks doesn’t want people to take a picture of, for secu-
rity reasons. To set up a password, you simply enter the same password into
both the New Password text box and the Confirm New Password text box.
Note that your password is associated with the username Admin (which
stands for administrator). Leave the Enter Old Password box empty. If you
haven’t yet set up a password, you don’t have an old password.
Obviously, you want to set your password so that no one (not even a com-
puter) can possibly guess it. This means that your password shouldn’t be a
word in a dictionary. Your password also shouldn’t be a number. And your
password especially shouldn’t be a word, phrase, or name that some co-
worker can easily figure out. The best passwords (from a security point of
view) are nonsensical combinations of letters and numbers, such as f34t5s 
or s3df43x2.
After you set your password, you should periodically change it. To change
your password, you also choose the Company menu’s Change Your Password
command. QuickBooks again displays the Change Password dialog box. This
time you must enter your old password into the Enter Old Password text box.
Then, you need to enter your new password into both the New Password
text box and the Confirm New Password text box.
QuickBooks requires a username and password before it will open the 
company data file. For example, if you assign a password to your company
data file, whenever QuickBooks starts, it displays the QuickBooks Login
dialog box, where you enter your username and password and then click 
OK. QuickBooks then opens the data file. If you can’t supply the password,
QuickBooks doesn’t open the data file.

Chapter 2

QuickBooks

465
QuickBooks in a Multi-User Environment
You aren’t limited to using just one password to control access to your
QuickBooks data file. QuickBooks allows you to set up several passwords for
the QuickBooks data file. What’s really neat about this is that you can tell
QuickBooks to limit certain users and passwords to do only certain things.
This sounds complicated, but it’s really not. The business owner, for exam-
ple, may have a password that allows him or her to do anything. But a new
accounting clerk, for example, may only have a password that allows him to
record bills into the system.
Setting up additional QuickBooks users
If more than one person will be using QuickBooks, you want to set up addi-
tional passwords. To do this, follow these steps:
1. Choose the Company menu’s Set Up Users command.
QuickBooks displays the User List dialog box, as shown in Figure 2-1.
The User List dialog box identifies any users for whom QuickBooks
access has been set up. The User List dialog box also identifies who is
currently logged on to the system. In Figure 2-1, the administrator is
logged on.
2. Tell QuickBooks that you want to add a user by clicking the Add User
button.
When you click this button, QuickBooks displays the first Set Up User
Password and Access dialog box, as shown in Figure 2-2.
3. Identify the user and supply a password.
You need to give each user for whom you are setting up a password a
username. You do this by entering a short name — perhaps the user’s
first name — into the User Name box. After you identify the user, you
enter the user’s password into both the Password text box and the
Confirm Password text box. After you do this, click Next to continue.
Figure 2-1:
The User List
dialog box.

QuickBooks in a Multi-User Environment
466
4. Indicate whether you want to limit access for the new user.
When QuickBooks displays the second Set Up User Password and Access
dialog box, as shown in Figure 2-3, indicate whether you want to limit
access and rights for the user. If you do want to limit access and rights
(rights are simply the things that the user can do), select the Selected
Areas of QuickBooks radio button. If you want the user to be able to do
anything, select the All Areas of QuickBooks option button. After you
make your decision, click Next to continue.
If you indicate that the new user should have access to all areas of
QuickBooks, you are done setting up the user password. You can skip
the remaining steps.
5. Describe access to sales and accounts receivable information and
tasks.

467
After you complete Step 4, QuickBooks displays the third Set Up User
Password and Access dialog box, shown in Figure 2-4. This is the first of
ten dialog boxes that walk you through an interview asking detailed
questions about what kind of access each user should have to a particu-
lar area. In Figure 2-4, QuickBooks asks about access to sales transac-
tions (such as invoices and credit memos and accounts receivable
information). You can indicate that the user should have no access by
selecting the No Access radio button. You can indicate that the user
should have full access by selecting the Full Access radio button. If the
user should have partial access, you select the Selective Access radio
button and then select one of the Selective Access subsidiary buttons:
Create Transactions Only, Create and Print Transactions, or Create
Transactions and Create Reports.
As a general rule, when it comes to accounting controls, you want to
provide the minimal amount of access. If someone doesn’t need access
to the QuickBooks data file for their day-to-day duties, you should select
the No Access button. If someone needs a little bit of access — perhaps
they need to prepare job estimates or invoices — you give them just
that access, and nothing more. A little bit later in this chapter, in the sec-
tion “Maintaining Good Accounting Controls,” I talk about why minimiz-
ing user rights and access is so important. But the bottom line is this:
The more ability you give employees or subcontractors or accountants
to noodle around in your accounting system, the greater the risk that
someone can either inadvertently or intentionally introduce errors into
the system. Also, the greater the rights and access you give, the easier
you make it for someone to steal from you.
After you describe the rights that you want the user to have in the sales
and accounts receivable area, click Next.
Figure 2-4:
The third

6. Describe the purchases and accounts payable rights.
After you complete Step 5 by clicking Next, QuickBooks displays the
fourth Set Up User Password And Access dialog box, as shown in 
Figure 2-5. This dialog box resembles the one shown in Figure 2-3. Like
that dialog box, the fourth Set Up User Password And Access dialog box
allows you to specify what access this new user has in the purchases
and accounts payable areas. You can select the No Access radio button.
You can select the Full Access radio button. Or you can select some
middle ground by selecting the Selective Access radio button and one 
of the Selective Access subsidiary buttons. The same rules for setting
rights and access that apply to the purchases and accounts payable area
also apply to the sales and accounts receivable area.
After you finish specifying the appropriate purchases and accounts
payable rights and access to the user, click the Next button.
7. Describe the remaining user rights and access.
As you click the Next button shown on the bottom of each version of the
Set Up User Password and Access dialog box, QuickBooks displays sev-
eral other versions of the dialog box that QuickBooks uses to query you
about user rights and access. For example, after you describe what rights
are appropriate for the user in the purchases and accounts payable area,
QuickBooks asks about the checking and credit card area. Then, it asks
about the inventory area. Next, it asks about payroll. And then, it asks
about general, sensitive accounting activities. Finally, QuickBooks asks
about access to the financial reporting capabilities.
You limit rights in each of these other areas in the same way that you 
do for the sales and accounts receivable and purchases and accounts
payable areas. I am not, therefore, going to describe how you select the
Figure 2-5:
The fourth
Set Up User
Password

dialog box.

No Access option button, the Full Access option button, or the Selective
Access button over and over again. Just be thoughtful as you go through
and limit the capability of the user. You want someone to have the rights
necessary to do their job, but you don’t want to give them any more
rights than they need.
8. Specify where the user can change or delete transactions.
After you’ve stepped through roughly a half-dozen versions of the Set Up
User Password and Access dialog boxes that ask about specific areas of
accounting, QuickBooks displays the Set Up User Password and Access
dialog box shown in Figure 2-6. The Changing or Deleting Transactions
version of the Set Up User Password and Access dialog box lets you indi-
cate that a user can or can’t change transactions recorded before the
closing date. In general, you want to limit a user’s capabilities to change
or delete transactions.
One of the problems with QuickBooks is that it doesn’t limit in any other
way the capability of someone — perhaps someone who is well-meaning
but lacks knowledge — to muck up your accounting records by noodling
around with old transactions. You want to restrict the capability to
change or delete transactions to a very small group of users. And those
users must be people who understand either accounting or the impor-
tance of not going in and mucking up old accounting records that have
already been used to report finances to the bank or to taxing authorities.
You indicate whether a user can change or delete transactions by select-
ing the Yes or No option buttons shown in Figure 2-6.
After you finish indicating whether a user should be able to change or
delete transactions, click Next.

9. Review your rights decisions.
After you complete Step 8, QuickBooks displays the final version of the
Set Up User Password and Access dialog box, shown in Figure 2-7. It
identifies the user rights that you assigned or allowed. You can use this
dialog box to review the rights that someone has. If you realize you’ve
incorrectly assigned rights, click the Prev button to move back through
the dialog boxes to where you made a mistake. Then change the assign-
ment of rights and click the Next button to return to the final version of
the Set Up User Password and Access dialog box.
After you finish with the review of user rights and access, you can click
Finish. From this point forward, the new user will be able to use Quick-
Books; however, her rights are limited to what you specified.
Accountants often want to see the rights that particular users have. This
is especially true if you’re audited by your CPA as part of annual closings.
(You may be audited if the bank wants audited financial statements, for
example.) QuickBooks doesn’t provide a way for you to print the infor-
mation shown in the Set Up User Password and Access dialog box
shown in Figure 2-7. However, Windows allows you to use the Print
Screen button to capture a screen shot of the QuickBooks program
window and the Set Up User Password and Access dialog box.
Press Alt+Print Scrn to shoot a screen shot of the dialog box. This copies
an image of your screen to the Windows Clipboard. Next open Paint by
selecting Start➪Programs➪Accessories➪Paint. Paste the image into
Paint by pressing Ctrl+V. You may see an error message that says The
image in the Clipboard is larger than the bitmap. Would
you like the bitmap enlarged? Click Yes. Save the screen shot
using File➪Save As. (This is the same basic technique that I use, for
Figure 2-7:

Password
and Access
dialog box.

example, to show you pictures of the QuickBooks window in the pages
of this book.) You may want to capture a screen shot image in this way
in order to record the user access and rights for employees.
Changing user rights
You can also modify the rights that you assign to a user. To do this, choose
the Company menu’s Set Up Users command to display the User List dialog
box, as shown in Figure 2-8. This is the same User List dialog box shown ear-
lier in the chapter.
To look at the rights that a particular user has, click the user in the list and
then the View User button. When you do, QuickBooks displays the View User
Access dialog box, as shown in Figure 2-9. This dialog box shows the same
information as the final version of the Set Up User Access and Password
dialog box, which is the dialog box that you use to initially specify what
rights a user should have. Click the Leave button, obviously, to close the
View User Access dialog box.
Figure 2-9:
The View
User
Access
dialog box.
Figure 2-8:
The User
List dialog
box.

Using Audit Trails
472
To change a user’s rights after reviewing them, select the user and click the
Edit User button. This tells QuickBooks to step through the same set of
dialog boxes that you used to originally set up the user and describe his
rights. You use the Next and Prev buttons to do things such as change the
username or password, specify whether the user should be limited in his or
her access, and — if necessary — to specifically limit the user’s access to a
particular activity within QuickBooks.
To remove a user, you also use the User List dialog box. Simply select the
user and then click the Delete User button. QuickBooks asks you to confirm
your deletion. When you click the Yes button for confirmation, QuickBooks
removes the user.
A Few Words about Closing
Because I mentioned closing in the earlier paragraphs of this chapter and
because the User List dialog box that includes a Closing Date button has
been shown twice already in figures in this chapter, perhaps it’s time to dis-
cuss just a point or two about closing in QuickBooks.
If you take a “Principles of Accounting” course, you’ll learn that closing
means a set of bookkeeping procedures somebody goes through to zero out
revenue and expense accounts so that, starting in the new year, revenues
and expenses can be easily calculated. In QuickBooks, closing means some-
thing different. In QuickBooks, to close the accounting records, you supply a
closing date (see Figure 2-9). After you supply this closing date, QuickBooks
either prohibits users or limits users from changing transactions dated
before the closing date.
To close the QuickBooks data file to transactions that occur before a particu-
lar date, you simply enter the date into the Closing Date box.
Using Audit Trails
If you decide to allow multiple users access to the QuickBooks data file, you
will appreciate the QuickBooks Audit Trail feature. The Audit Trail feature
keeps a record of who makes what changes to the QuickBooks data file.
You can’t remove transactions from the Audit Trail list or history except by
archiving and condensing data. Archiving and condensing data is described
in Book VII, Chapter 3.

Turning on Audit Trail Tracking
In previous versions of QuickBooks, you had to turn on the audit trail fea-
ture. In QuickBooks 2007, however, the QuickBooks Audit Trail feature is
“always on.” You don’t need to do anything to begin using it.
Producing an Audit Trail Report
To produce an Audit Trail report, simply choose the Reports menu’s
Accountant and Taxes command and then select the Audit Trail command
from the submenu. Figure 2-10 shows a QuickBooks Audit Trail report in a
window. Note that the report identifies both the type of change made and
the person who made the change to the QuickBooks data file.
Figure 2-10:

Trail report.

Simultaneous Multi-User Access
474
Simultaneous Multi-User Access
Sometimes, you only need a single computer and a single copy of Quick-
Books even though you have several employees using QuickBooks. For
example, if a small business has only an administrative assistant and the
owner accessing a QuickBooks data file, one copy of QuickBooks running on
a single personal computer may be all that is required. However, QuickBooks
does allow for simultaneous use of the QuickBooks data file by multiple
users. To do this, predictably, you first need to set up the multiple users as
described in the preceding paragraphs of this chapter.
After you have set up the multiple users, however, you can install the Quick-
Books program on other personal computers and then — assuming that
these personal computers all connect to a Windows network — use those
other copies of QuickBooks to access the QuickBooks data file stored on the
first or principal computer. (Book VII, Chapter 1 describes how to build a
simple Windows peer-to-peer network.)
To use QuickBooks in an environment of simultaneous use by multiple users,
you also need to tell QuickBooks that this simultaneous use is okay. To do
this, choose the File➪Switch to Multi-User Mode command. If you later want
to turn off this Multi-User Mode, you choose the File➪Switch to Single User
Mode command.
QuickBooks supports simultaneous use by multiple users through a technol-
ogy called record locking, which locks all the records that you’re working
with but not the entire QuickBooks data file. For example, if you want to
work with company A and some other user wants to work with company B,
that’s okay. QuickBooks allows that. What you can’t do, however, is work on
both company A or company B at the same time. This would mean that
you’re working with the same customer record.
You can’t install the same copy of QuickBooks on multiple machines and
legally have a multiple user QuickBooks system. You must purchase a copy
of QuickBooks for each machine on which QuickBooks is installed. Note,
however, that Intuit does sell some multiple versions of QuickBooks where
you actually buy five licenses in one box of QuickBooks. (QuickBooks sup-
ports multiple user networks with up to five simultaneous users.)
A common setting in which you may want to have several QuickBooks users
is for sales representatives in your firm who prepare invoices or prepare
bids for customers. In this case, you may want to have each salesperson set
up on QuickBooks. Note, however, that these sales people should only have
the capability to create an invoice or perhaps create and print an invoice
estimate. For reasons discussed more fully in the next section of this chap-
ter, you want to be very careful about allowing inexperienced accounting
users full access to the accounting system.

Maintaining Good Accounting Controls

Maintaining Good Accounting Controls
In the preceding paragraphs of this chapter, I talk about how QuickBooks
allows for multiple users. Many businesses, after they grow to a certain size,
do need to support multiple users with access to accounting information
and the capability, in some cases, to create accounting transactions. Unfor-
tunately, multiple accounting system users create risk for the business
owner. By having access to the accounting system, users can either inadver-
tently introduce errors into the accounting system, or, unfortunately, some
users may intentionally defraud a business. For these reasons, I want to
briefly list some QuickBooks control techniques that a business owner or
business manager can use to minimize unintentional errors and minimize 
the opportunity for theft. Here are my best ideas:
✦Regularly compare physical inventory counts with inventory account-
ing records. Inventory, unfortunately, shrinks. People — sometimes
employees, but often pseudo-customers such as shoplifters — will steal
inventory. Therefore, one of the things that you need to do both to mini-
mize your inventory losses and to maintain accurate accounting records
is to regularly compare physical counts of your inventory with what
your accounting records show. A small convenience store, for example,
may want to compare tobacco inventory on a daily basis, beer and wine
inventory on a weekly basis, and all other grocery inventory items on a
monthly or annual basis. This approach to frequently counting the most
valuable and easiest-to-steal items accomplishes two things:
• Inventory shrinkage is quickly identified.
• The business owner can minimize inventory shrinkage by identifying
the type of inventory that is most often stolen or even when inven-
tory is most often stolen.
✦Reconcile bank accounts. One thing that business owners should do, in
my opinion, is reconcile their own bank accounts. Often, employee theft
by accounting personnel occurs as employees figure out how to write
checks on the company’s bank account that the owner doesn’t see. One
sure way to find a fictitious and fraudulent transaction is to have the
owner reconcile the bank statement. If the owner reconciles the bank
statement, she can compare the bank’s accounting for the account with
the company’s QuickBooks accounting records. Any obvious discrepan-
cies can be fixed — which means that the QuickBooks accounting records
are more accurate. Additionally, any flaky, suspicious transactions tend
to become obvious when the business owner looks closely at checks.
The first employee I ever hired was a check forger. He began forging
checks on one of my businesses’ checking accounts two or three weeks
after he started working for me. I caught him only because I was regu-
larly reconciling the checking account. (He was convicted of a felony a
few months later.)

Maintaining Good Accounting Controls
476
✦Segregate accounting from physical custody where possible. In a small
business, it’s difficult to always separate the accounting for some activ-
ity from the physical custody or physical responsibility for that activity.
For example, it’s tough to segregate the inventory accounting from phys-
ical custody or access to that inventory. A store clerk, for example, may
easily be able to steal cigarettes and also adjust inventory records
through cash register sales for cigarettes. Nevertheless, wherever you
can segregate physical custody from accounting, a built-in error check-
ing occurs. The person doing the accounting indirectly checks on the
physical custodians’ caretaking of the asset. If the physical custodian is
stealing cartons of cigarettes, for example, that will show up when the
accountant compares the accounting records to the physical accounts
of inventory. Similarly, someone without access to the cash and the bank
account can’t actually easily steal cash even if they have complete access
to cash accounting records. You can ask your CPA for help in devising
ways to segregate physical custody of assets from accounting and book-
keeping duties. And you really, really should do this. Unfortunately,
employee theft is very common.
✦Train employees in the use of QuickBooks. You should train employees
to use QuickBooks if you have a business of any size for two basic 
reasons:
• Someone who knows how to use QuickBooks is less likely to make
inadvertent errors. QuickBooks isn’t difficult to use, but neither is
QuickBooks something that you can learn willy-nilly with no help.
Some transactions are pretty tricky, particularly for certain busi-
nesses. So, if you can, it makes good sense to provide some employ-
ees with help or training or both. Those resources let people more
comfortably and more accurately use QuickBooks features to build
financial information that lets you better manage your business.
• Messy accounting records camouflage employee theft. Often, one of the
things you see when employee theft happens is really messed-up
accounting records. For that reason, you can find yourself in a situa-
tion where poorly trained employees create a messy accounting
system that enables theft by perhaps one of those employees or
some other employee. So training not only means more accurate
accounting records, but also that you are less likely to have an 
environment conducive to theft or embezzlement.
✦Manage your QuickBooks accounting system. I am sorry to report that
many business owners don’t view the accounting system as anything
more than a tool to produce invoices and paychecks and information
required for the annual tax return. Unfortunately, that distant relation-
ship with the accounting system means that business owners often
don’t feel much need to actively manage what happens with the
accounting system.

Book VII
Chapter 2
Administering
QuickBooks
Maintaining Good Accounting Controls
477
In my opinion, this attitude is wrong. An accounting system should be a
tool that you use to better manage your business. And it can be that. But
if it’s going to be a tool for better managing your business, you need to
manage the system. In other words, I respectfully suggest that you take
responsibility for ensuring that employees are trained to do the things
that protect your accounting system (such as backing up the data file)
and that you ensure that they complete appropriate accounting proce-
dures on a monthly and annual basis (such as sending out all invoices,
reconciling bank accounts, cleaning up messy transactions, and so forth).
I don’t think this management responsibility needs to be a heavy one.
You can rather easily make sure that people are doing the sorts of things
they are supposed to be doing by creating some simple checklists. Table
2-1 shows a sample monthly accounting to-do list. Table 2-2 shows a
sample annual accounting to-do list. You can use these as starting points
for constructing your own list of things that the accounting clerk or
office manager must do every month or at the end of every year.

Chapter 3: Protecting Your Data
In This Chapter
 Backing up the QuickBooks data file
 Restoring the QuickBooks data file
 Archiving and condensing QuickBooks data
I
n this chapter, I tell you how to protect your QuickBooks data. Principally,
protecting your data requires that you back up the data. If you back up
your data, you have a second copy available in case the original data file
goes bad or becomes corrupted. Because archiving and data file compres-
sion are related to backing up and restoring QuickBooks data files, I also talk
about archiving in this chapter. When you archive QuickBooks data files,
you create a permanent record of the data files. You also have the option of
condensing the current working data file.
Backing Up the QuickBooks Data File
A critically important task that either you or some co-worker need to com-
plete is to back up the QuickBooks data file. I respectfully suggest that few
items stored on your computer’s hard drive deserve as much caretaking as
the QuickBooks data file. Quite literally, the QuickBooks data file describes
your business’s financial affairs. You absolutely don’t want to lose the data
file. Losing the data file, for example, might mean that you don’t know how
much money you have, you don’t know whether you’re making or losing
money, and you won’t be able to easily or accurately prepare your annual
tax returns.
Backing up basics
Fortunately, backing up the QuickBooks data file is rather straightforward.
You need to complete only three steps:
1. Choose the File➪Save Copy or Back Up command.
QuickBooks displays the Save Copy: Type dialog box, which provides
two options: the option to save a backup copy of your QuickBooks file
and the option to create a portable company file.

Backing Up the QuickBooks Data File
480
2. You want to save a backup copy, so click the Backup Copy option
button. Then click Next to continue.
You can create either a full backup file or a portable company file when
you backup. A portable company file is smaller than a backup file, so it’s
more convenient to move around. For example, you can more easily
e-mail a portable company file. The rub with portable company files is
this: QuickBooks must work hard to scrunch the portable company file
to small size. QuickBooks also has more work to un-scrunch the file later
on when you want to work with it.
After you click Next, the Save Backup: Method dialog box, shown in
Figure 3-1, appears.
3. Indicate whether you want to save your QuickBooks backup file onto
your local company or QuickBooks offsite data center.
Click Local Backup to indicate you want to store the backup copy of
your file onto your computer’s hard disk.
4. Click the Options button to choose a backup location.
QuickBooks displays the Save Back Up Copy: Options dialog box, as
shown in Figure 3-2.
5. Specify to which folder or disk location the company file should be
backed up.
You just enter a pathname directly into the Folder box.
Figure 3-1:
The Save
Backup:

dialog box.

Book VII
Chapter 3
Protecting Your

481
If you don’t know how to enter a pathname, click the Browse button.
When QuickBooks displays the Browse for Folder dialog box, use its
folder list to select the disk or folder you want to use for QuickBooks
backups.
6. (Optional) Select your backup options.
You can also use the Save Backup Copy: Options dialog box shown in
Figure 3-2 to specify when QuickBooks should remind you to backup and
how QuickBooks should backup:
• Backup reminders: Check the Remind Me to Back Up When I Close
My Company File box and the adjoining text box to specify that you
want to be reminded to back up the QuickBooks file every time,
every other time, every third time, and so forth, that you close
QuickBooks.
• Data verification: Use the Verification buttons to tell QuickBooks
that it should check for data integrity when it backs up your data.
Mark the Complete Verification button for QuickBooks’ best and
most comprehensive verification. Alternatively, if you’re someone
who doesn’t have time for the extra few seconds of double-checking
that data verification takes, sure, mark the Quick Verification button.
Or better yet, throw caution completely to the wind — caution is for
babies anyway — and mark the No Verification button.
• Timestamps: To add the date and time of the backup operation to
the backup file’s name, check the Add the Date and Time of the
Backup to the File Name box.
• Limiting backup copies: To tell QuickBooks it should get rid of old
backup copies, check the Limit the Number of Your Saved Backup
Copies box and then specify how many backup copies you want to
keep by using the adjoining text box.
Figure 3-2:
The Save

482
7. When you finish specifying the backup location and options, click OK.
8. Click Finish to close the Save Backup: Method dialog box.
After you’ve specified how the backup operation should work, click
Finish. QuickBooks backs up (or creates a copy of) the current Quick-
Books company file and stores that new file copy at the backup location.
What about online backup?
If you were observant, you may have noticed that the Save Backup Copy:
Method dialog box shown in Figure 3-1 includes an Online option button. If
you want to find out more about backing up the QuickBooks company data
file online — which means using Intuit’s computer network rather than your
computer or some removable disk to store the backup — you can select the
Online radio button or click the Tell Me More button.
For what it’s worth, I strongly recommend that you consider using the online
backup method for two reasons:
✦Online backup is extremely reasonable with prices that run (at the time
of this writing) from about $5 to $12 a month. (You pay the higher end
figure if you backup all your computer’s files!)
✦Online backup can make the task of backing up less work and more regu-
lar as long as you have a reliable Internet connection. You don’t need to
remember to backup and then remember to bring the backup disk home.
Some backup tactics
Backing up is, mostly, just a matter of common sense. That being said, how-
ever, let me give you some ideas about how and when and maybe why you
should back up:
✦Make it easy.
I already mentioned this in my recommendation concerning the online
backup option. But the point deserves mentioning again. The most
important thing you can do regarding QuickBooks data file backup is
this: Make backing up easy. This probably means that you consider the
online option, but if you do go local, you want to have a high-density,
removable storage device that you can use with the computer you use
to run QuickBooks. I used to use an Iomega Zip drive that stores 100
megabytes of data. Now I use those stick-of-gum sized memory sticks.
You choose what device works best for you, but you definitely want
some similar, easy-to-employ storage device. In this case, “easy” means
that backing up is more likely to occur.

Book VII
Chapter 3
Protecting Your
Data
Restoring a QuickBooks Data File
483
✦Back up regularly.
I recommend that you back up every time you enter transactions into
the QuickBooks data file. Obviously, if backing up represents a lot of
work, you won’t want to do it. But if you have an easy way to back up
and a convenient storage device, you can and should back up regularly.
Daily backups are not too often.
✦Store a backup copy of the QuickBooks data file offsite.
One final important point worth mentioning: Many of the events that
may destroy or corrupt your data file are specific to your computer — 
a hard drive failure, a virus, a user accident, and so forth. Some of the
events that may corrupt or destroy your QuickBooks data file, however,
are location-specific. Fire, flood, or theft can cause you to lose the Quick-
Books data file and its backup. For this reason, you want to store a copy
of the backup offsite. At the end of the week, for example, you may want
to pop the Zip disk in your shirt pocket and bring it home. Make sure
that if something corrupts or destroys the QuickBooks data file that that
same something also doesn’t destroy the backup QuickBooks data file.
Restoring a QuickBooks Data File
If you find that the working copy of the QuickBooks data file becomes cor-
rupted or gets destroyed, you need to restore the QuickBooks data file so
you can again begin using QuickBooks. Restoring the QuickBooks data file is
easy if you’ve recently backed up the QuickBooks data file.
If you haven’t recently (or ever) backed up the QuickBooks data file, you’ll
have to restore the QuickBooks data file, which means starting over from
scratch. This means, for example, that you rerun the QuickBooks Installation
and Setup. You’ll need to re-enter all the old data. In short, restoring without
a backup copy of the QuickBooks data file means that you start over at
square one.
To restore the QuickBooks data file from the backup copy of the file, put the
backup disk into the drive and then follow these steps:
1. Launch QuickBooks and choose the File➪Open or Restore Company
command.
QuickBooks displays the Open Company: Type dialog box, as shown in
Figure 3-3.
2. Indicate what type of file you want to restore.
You can use the Open Company: Type dialog box to open a regular
QuickBooks data file, a backup copy of the QuickBooks file, or a portable

Restoring a QuickBooks Data File
484
file. If you want to restore a backup copy, predictably, you click the button
labeled Restore A Backup Copy.
3. Click Next.
QuickBooks displays the Restore Backup: Method dialog box, as shown
in Figure 3-4.
4. Tell QuickBooks whether the backup copy is stored on your company
or at QuickBooks’ offsite data center.
To do this, you just click the button that labels your backup copy file’s
location.
5. Click Next.
QuickBooks displays the Open dialog box, as shown in Figure 3-5.
Figure 3-4:

dialog box.
Figure 3-3:

box.

Book VII
Chapter 3

6. Identify the backup file that you will use for the restoration.
Use the Open dialog box to specify the location of and then the specific
backup file that you’ll use for the restoration. You can use the Look In
box to identify the disk and folder storing the backup file. After you iden-
tify the location of the backup file, double-click the file.
7. Verify the backup and the to-be-restored company filename and loca-
tion information.
When you restore the company data file by using the backup copy, you
destroy the current working version of the file. In other words, Quick-
Books takes the backup copy and copies it over the to-be-restored com-
pany data file. Therefore, before you restore company data files, make
sure that you’re using the right backup copy and that you’re overwriting
the corrupted, to-be-restored company file.
8. Click Open.
QuickBooks displays the Restore Backup: To Location dialog box. It
simply tells you that QuickBooks is about to ask you where you want to
store the newly restored file. (Er, that QuickBooks needs to tell you it’s
about to ask a question seems a little strange, but let’s not get bogged
down with that . . . .)
9. Click Next.
QuickBooks displays the Restore To dialog box, as shown in Figure 3-6.
Figure 3-5:
The Open
dialog box.

Cleaning Up the QuickBooks Company Files
486
10. Tell QuickBooks where it should restore the backup copy and then
click Save.
Use the Restore To dialog box to pick a location for the backed up file.
You’ll probably pick the same location as the existing file. And if you do
this, QuickBooks displays a message asking you to confirm that you
want to overwrite the existing file. You click Yes. After you click Yes,
QuickBooks displays another message box entitled Delete Entire File.
Confirm that you want to delete the existing (and presumably corrupt)
company data file by typing the word yes into the message box. Then
click OK. QuickBooks uses the backup copy to overwrite the to-be-
restored company file.
11. Enter any transactions that took place since your last backup.
If you entered transactions after you last backed up the QuickBooks
company file, you now re-enter those transactions into QuickBooks. For
example, if you last backed up QuickBooks on Friday of last week, you
need to enter any transactions that you’ve created since last Friday.
Cleaning Up the QuickBooks Company Files
The QuickBooks file clean-up process does two things:
✦The QuickBooks cleanup creates a permanent copy of the QuickBooks
data file. (This is called an archival copy of the file.) An archival copy of
the company file amounts to a snapshot of the company file as it exists
at a particular point in time. If somebody later has a question — perhaps
Figure 3-6:
The Restore
To dialog
box.

Book VII
Chapter 3
Protecting Your
Data
Cleaning Up the QuickBooks Company Files
487
your accountant, or a federal or state auditor — you can use the archival
copy of the data file to show what the company file looked like at a par-
ticular point in time.
✦The file clean-up process makes the data file smaller by summarizing
many old detail transactions using big monster journal entries.
Because this cleanup and archiving can be a little bit confusing, let me
quickly summarize exactly what happens when you clean up the QuickBooks
company file. Here’s what QuickBooks does during the clean-up process:
✦Saves an archive copy of your company files: When you clean up 
the QuickBooks company file, QuickBooks saves an archival copy of 
that file.
✦Removes old transactions: As part of the clean-up process, QuickBooks
gives you the opportunity to remove old, closed transactions from the
current, working version of the QuickBooks company file. Remember
that archiving creates an archival copy of the QuickBooks company file.
You still, however, have the working version of the QuickBooks company
file. It is this current, working version of the QuickBooks company file
that gets condensed, or cleaned up, by the removal of old, closed 
transactions.
Closed transactions are transactions that QuickBooks no longer needs to
track in detail. For example, an old customer invoice — after it’s been
paid — is a closed transaction. An old check written to some vendor —
after it’s cleared the bank — is a closed transaction.
✦Summarizes old, closed transactions: Because the old, closed transac-
tions are removed from the QuickBooks data file, cleanup creates sum-
mary monthly journal entries for the old, closed transactions and places
these summary transactions in the current, working version of the Quick-
Books data file. These summary monthly journal entries allow you to
continue to prepare monthly financial statements. For example, even
though archiving removes all the old, closed transactions from, for exam-
ple, January of 1995, you can still produce monthly financial statements
for January of 1995 in 2007. To produce monthly financial statements for
January of 1995, QuickBooks uses the summary monthly journal entries.
✦Clears the audit trail: As I mention in Book VII, Chapter 2, QuickBooks
maintains an audit trail of who has entered what transactions. One
almost hidden effect of the cleanup of the QuickBooks data files con-
cerns the audit trail. If you clean up a company file and indicate that the
company file should be condensed, QuickBooks clears the audit trail
before the “removed closed transactions on or before” date. In other
words, for the period of time in which QuickBooks removes old, closed
transactions, it also removes the audit trail of those transactions.

Cleaning Up the QuickBooks Company Files
488
The clean-up file process typically means creating a copy of the QuickBooks
data file that you save and put away someplace, and creating a scaled-down
version of the working company file. The command that you use to clean up
the QuickBooks company file, however, also allows you to create almost-
empty company files. Most people would never need to use this option. I can
only think of one category of QuickBooks users who may want to create
almost-empty company files. CPAs and consultants (who want to reuse a
company file for another business unit or client) may want to use this com-
mand to create company data files that have many of the lists set up already.
I don’t go any further into detailing the option of creating an almost-empty
company file by using the archiving command, but you should know that it
is there.
Clean-up basics
After you understand what archiving is all about, it is quite straightforward.
To archive the QuickBooks company file, follow these steps:
1. Choose the File➪Utilities➪Clean Up Company Data command.
QuickBooks displays the Clean Up Company Data dialog box, as shown
in Figure 3-7.
2. Select the Remove Transactions as of a Specific Date radio button.
This option tells QuickBooks that you want to do two things: Create an
archival copy of the QuickBooks data file and skinny down the size of
the working company file so that it isn’t so big. QuickBooks reduces the
size of the working version of the company data file by removing old,
closed transactions.

3. Specify the Remove Closed Transactions On or Before date.
To specify the date before which closed transactions should be removed,
enter the date into the date box provided. If you want to condense the
file by removing transactions on or before December 31, 2005, for exam-
ple, enter 12/31/2005 into the date box. Note, however, that you don’t
need to feel compulsive about removing a bunch of closed transactions.
You only remove closed transactions if your QuickBooks company file is
getting too big. You can easily work with a QuickBooks company file that
is 25, 50, or even 100MB (megabytes) in size.
Therefore, in the case where you find yourself with a company file that 
is only 8MB in size, you may want to archive the company file but not
condense it. If the company file has grown too large, you may want 
to condense the data file by removing old transactions. However, this
doesn’t mean that you would want to remove old closed transactions
from last year. You may, instead, choose to remove old transactions 
from three years ago or five years ago.
4. Click Next.
When you click Next, QuickBooks displays the second page of the Clean
Up Company Data dialog box, as shown in Figure 3-8.
5. Specify any additional criteria that you want QuickBooks to apply for
removing transactions.
As the dialog box shown in Figure 3-8 indicates, QuickBooks won’t
remove an old, closed transaction if it is an uncleared bank or credit
card transaction, if a transaction is marked to be printed, if a transaction
is an invoice or estimate marked to be sent, or if a transaction contains
unbilled or unreimbursed costs. Nevertheless, even those sorts of old,
closed transactions may still be transactions that you should remove.
Figure 3-8:

Company
Data dialog
box.

You may have transactions that will never clear or never be printed or
sent, for example. To indicate that some of these old transactions should
also be removed, select the check box that corresponds to the removal
criteria. To remove old invoices and estimates that are still marked as to
be sent, select the Remove Invoices and Estimates Marked ‘To Be Sent’
check box.
6. Click Next.
When you click Next, QuickBooks displays the third Clean Up Company
Data dialog box, as shown in Figure 3-9.
7. Specify any list cleanup that should occur.
Use the third Clean Up Company Data dialog box to tell QuickBooks that
in addition to removing old closed transactions, it should also clean up
some of the lists. You can select check boxes on the Clean Up Company
Data dialog box, for example, that tell QuickBooks to remove unused
accounts, unused customers, unused vendors, and so forth. By cleaning
up your list through the removal of unused list items, you not only
reduce the size of the company file, you also make it easier for people to
work with the list.
8. Click Next.
QuickBooks displays the fourth page of the Clean Up Company Data
dialog box, as shown in Figure 3-10.
9. Confirm your clean-up and archiving operation.
After you describe how you want QuickBooks to archive and condense
the company file, QuickBooks displays the fourth Clean Up Company
Data dialog box, as shown in Figure 3-10. This dialog box asks you to
confirm your decision to archive and condense the data file. The dialog
Figure 3-9:
The third

Data dialog
box.

Book VII
Chapter 3
Protecting Your

box also tells you that the archival process begins with QuickBooks
backing up the data file and then may take several minutes or several
hours to complete. Use this dialog box to confirm the fact that you want
to archive and condense the data.
10. Click Begin Cleanup.
QuickBooks begins the process of archiving and cleaning up the data file.
11. Back up the data file when prompted.
At the very beginning of the clean-up process, QuickBooks prompts you
to back up the QuickBooks company file. Backing up the QuickBooks
company file as part of a clean up operation works the same as backing
up the QuickBooks company file at any other time. If you have questions
about how to back up the QuickBooks company file, refer to the earlier
section “Backing up basics.”
After you back up the QuickBooks company file, QuickBooks saves an
archive copy of the company file and then cleans up the working version
of the company file by using your instructions. Again, as noted in the ear-
lier steps, the clean up process may take only a few minutes or it may
take several hours if your file is very large.
Some clean-up and archiving strategies
Deciding when and how you want to clean up or archive your QuickBooks
company file is mostly a matter of common sense. Your first consideration
should be whether you need to condense the company file at all. If Quick-
Books still runs at a reasonable speed, if you don’t find yourself going crazy
because of many unused items on lists, or if the data file hasn’t grown mon-
strously large (larger than 100MB or so in size), you may not need to condense.
Figure 3-10:

You achieve no benefit, in many cases, by cleaning up. And by not cleaning
up, you still have complete detailed financial records at your fingertips.
The other part about cleanup and archiving the QuickBooks company files 
is another common-sense notion: You should create an archival copy of the
QuickBooks data file. In fact, I recommend that you create an archival copy of
the QuickBooks data file at the end of the year after you or your CPA has made
any final adjustments to the year. It’s a great idea to create an archival copy 
of the QuickBooks data file that’s used to prepare your tax return and any
financial statements because you can always later explain some number on a
return or financial statement by looking at the archival copy of the data file.
Throughout this book — and most recently in the previous chapter on
administering QuickBooks — I mention that one of the problems of using
QuickBooks is that people can intentionally or inadvertently change old
transactions. This means that someone can, unfortunately, change transac-
tions in a QuickBooks data file in a previous year. When that change occurs,
someone later looking at the QuickBooks data file may not be able to explain
a number on a tax return or a financial statement. For example, if someone
later goes back and changes a transaction in a previous year, and that trans-
action is used to calculate total revenues for the year, you can no longer use
the QuickBooks data to explain numbers on your tax return and your finan-
cial statements for total revenue. That makes sense, right?
Fortunately, by having an archival copy of the QuickBooks data file — the
QuickBooks data file that supplied numbers to your tax return and the finan-
cial statements — you can always see which QuickBooks transactions sup-
port a particular tax return number or financial statement number. If you’re
still confused about this point — and it is a little bit tricky — ask your tax
advisor or your CPA about the problem. He can explain to you the danger of
having a change in QuickBooks data that has been used to prepare a return
or a financial statement after that return has been prepared or after those
financial statements have been published and distributed.

A
fter writing about QuickBooks for more than ten years, I’ve had a reve-
lation of sorts. People not only want specific, step-by-step information
about how to use the program, they also want troubleshooting advice. They
want techniques and tactics that they can use to solve the inevitable prob-
lems that they encounter while using QuickBooks in real-life settings. What
follows is my list of the best troubleshooting techniques.
Using the QuickBooks Help File and This Book
I know what you may be thinking: You’ve got some problem that you can’t
solve by using Help, and it’s either a bug or some glaring error in the Quick-
Books documentation. Of course, you’ve looked through this book and it says
nothing — absolutely nothing — about your question. In fact, upon further
reflection, you may be thinking that you’ve encountered some problem that
you can’t possibly solve by consulting the QuickBooks Help file or this book.
Maybe you’re right.
In my experience (gleaned from talking with people who have problems),
however, about half the time, the problem is lack of knowledge about Quick-
Books. These users may simply be experiencing a mechanical problem.
They can’t make the program work because they haven’t used QuickBooks
enough to it figure out. Therefore, the right way to solve this sort of problem
is to find out more about QuickBooks and try again. For example, if you’re
having problems printing a report, just finding out more about both printing
and reports may enable you to solve the problem.
In most cases, you should be able to find the information in this book by
using either the Index or the Table of Contents.

Browsing Intuit’s Product-Support Web Site
494
Also, you should usually be able to find the information (perhaps in a slightly
less-friendly form) in the QuickBooks Help file. To find information in the
QuickBooks Help file, choose Help➪QuickBooks Help to display the Quick-
Books Help window as shown in Figure 4-1. Click the Search tab and then
enter the word or phrase that you want to look up.
Browsing Intuit’s Product-Support Web Site
Another really good resource for troubleshooting is Intuit’s product-support
Web site for QuickBooks. This Web site, available at www.quickbooks.com/
support/, supplies a rich database of troubleshooting information, as
shown in Figure 4-2.
To make the most of the Web site, scroll down the page to its drop-down list
boxes (not visible in Figure 4-2) and identify the version of QuickBooks
you’re using. After you identify your version, you see a Web page that lists
common categories of problems or questions. Select a category, and you’re
on your way. The product-support Web site then displays a list of trouble-
shooting articles that may help solve your problem.

Checking Another Vendor’s Product-Support Web Site
Keep in mind that your problem may not be a problem with QuickBooks 
at all, but rather a problem with your computer and its hardware or with
Microsoft Windows. The Microsoft product-support Web site, which is phe-
nomenally rich in information, is available at support.microsoft.com, as
shown in Figure 4-3.
If your problem stems from the hardware or the operating system, you can
consult the hardware or software maker’s product-support Web site for trou-
bleshooting information. You can usually find the hardware maker’s product-
support Web site easily by using a good Internet search engine. For example,
to locate Dell Computer’s product-support Web site, type something like Dell
Computer product support into a search engine such as www.google.com.
When the search engine searches on the phrase “Dell Computer product
support,” it almost inevitably finds the URL (the address) of the vendor’s
product-support Web page.
Figure 4-2:

Web page.

Tapping into Intuit’s Product-Support System
496
You can find troubleshooting information about Intuit products at the Micro-
soft product-support Web site. If the solutions that the site offers aren’t very
reassuring, at least you can find out whether others have experienced the
same problem. Microsoft may simply suggest that you contact the vendor
(Intuit, in this case) or that you upgrade to a newer version of the Quick-
Books software. However, simply knowing that the problem you’ve encoun-
tered is a real problem that Microsoft has logged into its product-support
Knowledge Base and described in some technical detail is often useful.
Tapping into Intuit’s Product-Support System
In addition to the option of using the Intuit product-support Web site, you
can also get direct product support in a variety of ways:
✦You can call a real person at Intuit and get personalized help. Intuit
offers several different support plans, and the cost varies depending 
on the plan you choose. The number you call depends on which version
of QuickBooks you’re using. To see an overview of the different Quick-
Books support plans, as well as their prices and phone numbers, poke
around the QuickBooks Web site. (Unfortunately, I can’t give you a good
URL to enter into your Web browser’s address box. The URL address
changes too frequently.)

Trying an Internet Newsgroup
497
The QuickBooks phone support may be free if you call with an installa-
tion problem, an upgrade problem, or a software bug. In my experience,
however, Intuit defines the term software bug very narrowly. What you
and I may think of as software bugs may not be software bugs to the
Intuit support person.
✦You can sign up for a premium support plan that gives you unlimited
phone support for about $300 a year — and then call a real person at
Intuit. (This annual fee changes, so check the Web site for up-to-date
pricing information rather than relying on my perhaps out-of-date infor-
mation.) Premium support represents a pretty good investment, in my
opinion. If you make more than one phone support call a year, you can
probably save money with the premium support plan because a single
support call can easily last an hour and can become very pricey.
✦You can contact a QuickBooks professional advisor via the QuickBooks
Web site. In a nutshell, QuickBooks professional advisors are just people
(often accountants and consultants) who pay Intuit to be listed on the
QuickBooks product-support Web site. (Some of these people also take a
test and pay extra money to be listed as “certified” advisors.) You pay
these professional advisors their usual consulting fees. I’m probably
prejudiced here because although I haven’t signed up (yet?) to be a pro-
fessional advisor, I do QuickBooks consulting for businesses and CPA
firms in the Seattle area. With that disclosure given, however, let me sug-
gest that this support option can be very useful when your problem isn’t
so much a technical problem with QuickBooks as a problem with how 
to use QuickBooks to solve some accounting issue. To contact a Quick-
Books professional advisor, visit the QuickBooks Web site.
Trying an Internet Newsgroup
If your problem with QuickBooks isn’t really a program bug or can’t be easily
solved by finding out more, you can sometimes find an answer by consulting
other QuickBooks users. One of the easiest ways to do this is by browsing
the Quicken newsgroup (yes, that’s right, the Quicken newsgroup) or the
QuickBooks newsgroup at the following addresses:
alt.comp.software.financial.Quicken
alt.comp.software.financial.QuickBooks
To browse the Quicken newsgroup or the QuickBooks newsgroup — note
that the Quicken newsgroup contains both Quicken and QuickBooks infor-
mation — you use an Internet service provider that supports newsgroups
and a newsgroup reader (such as Outlook Express). Assuming that you have
these things, you can subscribe to the QuickBooks newsgroup and talk with
other QuickBooks users about the problems that you’re encountering.

When All Else Fails . . .
498
You may not need this background information, but I want to point out a few
important things about newsgroups. A specific organization doesn’t typically
support or police newsgroups. For example, Intuit doesn’t maintain or sup-
port the Quicken or the QuickBooks newsgroup. Newsgroups, including the
Quicken and QuickBooks newsgroups, really amount to freeform — and
sometimes unruly — discussions among users. You can’t always expect to
have your question answered. Additionally, good newsgroup etiquette sug-
gests that if you ask questions, you should also try to answer questions.
When All Else Fails . . .
If you try at least a few of the preceding troubleshooting tactics and can’t get
an answer, I have one other suggestion: Bite the bullet, call your CPA, and get
him or her to help you through the rough patches.
I know. You’re going to pay $100 or $200 an hour or whatever. And you paid,
what, only a few hundred bucks for QuickBooks in the first place? But here’s
the deal. Your accounting system is an essential business tool. It must work
smoothly and correctly to get the information you need to successfully oper-
ate your business. Paying for an hour or two of expert, on-site, personalized
accounting expertise can be a great investment.
And what if your accountant doesn’t or can’t provide this sort of assistance?
Well, shoot, I think you should find somebody who does.
As a special favor to all of the busy accountants out there, I should also 
say that from January through almost the end of April and then again in
September and October, your accountant is probably just crazy-busy doing
the tax returns of businesses and individuals. I bring up this seasonal spike of
activity in his or her schedule to point out that you (unfortunately) shouldn’t
expect any quick answers from your CPA during tax season. Sorry. I don’t like
it any better than you do. But that’s just the way it is.

n this appendix, I review the basic Excel skills that you may need in order
to get the most benefit from some chapters in this book. If you plan to
download and work with the sample workbooks from my Web site, www.
stephenlnelson.com, you need some of the skills that this primer covers.
Note: Excel 2007, which will be released sometime during 2007, works a little
differently from what I describe here.
If you’ve used Excel much — even for just a few weeks — you probably
already possess all these skills. Nevertheless, if you are even a teensy bit
concerned about whether you have the right skills, take the time to quickly
read through this chapter.
Starting Excel
You can start Excel in two ways, neither of which requires a Ph.D. in physics.
You can use the Start button or you can open an Excel workbook.
If you are going to use the Start button, you click Start (as you can guess if
you have worked with other Windows programs), you click All Programs,
and then you choose Microsoft Excel from the All Programs menu.

Stopping Excel
502
To start Excel by opening an Excel workbook, you either select the work-
book from a menu or you select the workbook in a folder window. You com-
monly see documents, including Excel workbooks, listed on menus — both
Windows menus and Program menus. For example, if you click the Start
button and choose the My Recent Documents command, Windows displays
the list of documents that you recently saved. If you see an Excel workbook
listed, you can open the workbook by choosing it from the menu. When you
open an Excel workbook, Windows starts Excel and tells Excel to open the
workbook.
You can also open Excel files from within My Computer, Windows Explorer, or
My Documents. Simply open a folder containing one or more Excel workbooks,
such as the folder shown in Figure A-1, and then double-click the file that you
want to open. Voilà! Excel starts and displays the file that you wanted.
Stopping Excel
To stop Excel, you choose the File➪Exit command. When you stop Excel,
Excel closes any of the open Excel workbooks. And then Excel stops.

503
You can also stop Excel by clicking the Excel Program window’s Close box.
The Close box is the button marked with an X that appears in the upper-
right corner of the Excel Program window.
Explaining Excel’s Workbooks
After you start Excel, Excel displays an empty Excel workbook in its docu-
ment window. Figure A-2 shows a picture of this empty workbook.
An Excel workbook is just a spreadsheet. A spreadsheet is comprised of num-
bered rows and lettered columns. You see these numbers along the left edge
of the spreadsheet. You see the lettered columns along the top edge of the
spreadsheet. For example, the first row is numbered 1, the second is num-
bered 2, and so on. The first column is labeled with the letter A. The second
column is labeled with the letter B, and so on.
The intersections of rows and columns are called cells. A cell location is
described by using the column letter and row number. For example, the cell
in the upper-left corner of the workbook is labeled A1.

Putting Text, Numbers, and Formulas into Cells
504
Putting Text, Numbers, and Formulas into Cells
You build a workbook, or spreadsheet, by entering text labels, numbers, and
formulas into the cells that comprise a workbook. The following list details
these items:
✦Text labels include letters and numbers that you don’t want to use in
calculations. For example, your name, some budget expense description,
and a telephone number are all examples of text labels. None of these
pieces of information is used in calculations.
✦Numbers, or values, are bits of data that you may want to later use in a
calculation. For example, the actual amount that you budgeted for some
expense will always be a number or value.
✦Formulas are also entered into worksheet cells. For example, if you
enter =2+2 into a cell, Excel doesn’t display the formula. Rather, it calcu-
lates the formula result and displays that. The formula is what is actually
stored in the cell, but the formula result is displayed.
This business about formulas going into workbook cells is, essentially,
the heart of Excel. Even if an Excel workbook did nothing else, it would
still be an extremely valuable tool. In fact, the first spreadsheet programs
did little more than calculate cell formulas.
To enter a text label, a value, or a formula into a cell, all you do is click the
cell by using the mouse and then type the text label, value, or formula. When
you press Enter or click another cell, Excel enters your label, value, or for-
mula into the cell. That’s all it takes.
Writing Formulas
In the preceding section, I told you about formulas — and even showed you
a simple formula example. But in order to practically use formulas, you need
to possess several other pieces of knowledge.
Specifically, you need to remember several things about entering formulas
into the cells of a workbook:
✦Formulas should begin with the equal sign (=). The equal sign tells
Excel that what follows is a formula that it should calculate.
✦You can use any of the standard arithmetic operators in your formu-
las. For example, to add numbers, use the addition sign (+). To subtract
numbers, use the subtraction operator (-). To multiply numbers, use the
multiplication operator (*). To divide numbers, use the division opera-
tor (/). You can also perform exponential operations by using the expo-
nential operator (^).

Appendix A

in Excel
Scrolling through Big Workbooks
505
✦You aren’t limited to using values in your formulas. You can also use 
cell addresses. When you use a cell address in a formula, Excel uses the
value or formula result from that cell in the calculation. For example, if 
cell A1 holds the value 2 and cell B1 holds the value 2, the formula =A1+B1
returns the value 4. In other words, this formula is equivalent to =2+2.
✦Remember standard rules of operator precedence when you build
complicated formulas. As you may remember from junior high math,
exponential operations are performed first. Multiplication and division
operations are performed second. Addition and subtraction operations
are performed third. To override these standard rules of operator prece-
dence, you include the operations that you want performed first inside
parentheses. Table A-1 shows some example formulas and the formula
results to illustrate these rules of precedence. If you get it wrong, you’ll
have to stay after class.

Equals 4 if cells A1 and B1 both hold the value 2.
Scrolling through Big Workbooks
The cells that you see inside the Excel program window represent only a
small portion of the Excel workbook. An Excel workbook actually provides
65,536 rows and 256 columns.
Because the alphabet only provides 26 letters, a new naming scheme is
needed, starting in column 27. Excel labels the 27th and subsequent 
columns using two letters. The 27th column is labeled AA, for example. 
The 28th column is labeled AB. The 29th is labeled AC and so on. The last, 
or rightmost, column in an Excel workbook is labeled IV.
You can scroll the viewable portion of the Excel workbook in several ways:
✦Use the horizontal and vertical scroll bars that appear along the
bottom edge and at the right edge of the workbook window. For exam-
ple, you can click on the scroll bar, you can drag the scroll marker, and
you can click on the scroll bar arrow buttons that appear on either end
of the scroll bar. If you’re not already familiar with how scroll bars work,
take the time to experiment and see what they do.

Copying and Cutting Cell Contents
506
✦Scroll the viewable portion of the Excel workbook by moving the cell
selector. This is the dark rectangular border that Excel uses to mark the
active cell. The active cell is the cell into which whatever you type gets
placed. You can move the cell selector by pressing the arrow keys —
Excel moves the cell selector in the direction of the arrow. If you aren’t
sure what the cell selector is, press the arrow keys a bunch of times. See
that rectangle that jumps around? That’s the cell selector.
✦Move the viewable portion of the workbook up and down by pressing
the Page Up and Page Down keys.
You can use several other ways to scroll within a workbook. If you are really
interested, you may want to look up the other scrolling methods in the Excel
online Help, or get a good book like a recent edition of Excel For Dummies, by
Greg Harvey (Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
Copying and Cutting Cell Contents
You can easily copy and paste contents of workbook cells, and you will want
to do both of these things because workbook construction becomes much
easier when you use these skills.
Copying cell contents
To copy cell contents, you follow these steps:
1. Select the cells that you want to copy.
To select a single cell, click that cell. To select a range of cells — a range
is just a group of contiguous cells — click the cell in the upper-left corner
and then drag the mouse to the cell in the lower-right corner of the range.
2. Copy the selection by choosing the Edit➪Copy command.
Alternatively, you can click the Copy button that appears on the toolbar.
When you do either, Excel places a copy of the contents of the selection
on the Office Clipboard, which is a temporary storage area.
3. Select the location where want to place the copied data.
To tell Excel where you want to put the selection, click the cell in the
upper-left corner of the range into which you want to copy the data.
4. Paste the copied range selection by choosing Edit➪Paste.
Alternatively, you can click the Paste toolbar button. When you do
either, Excel copies the previously copied range selection from the
Office Clipboard to the workbook location that you identify in Step 3.

Copying and Cutting Cell Contents
507
Moving cell contents
You can move, or cut, the contents of cells and ranges by following these
steps:
1. Select the cells that you want to move.
To select a single cell, click that cell. To select a range of cells, click the
cell in the upper-left corner and then drag the mouse to the cell in the
lower-right corner.
2. Choose the Cut command.
You tell Excel that you want to cut your selection either by choosing the
Edit➪Cut command or by clicking the Cut button that appears on the
toolbar. When you choose the Cut command, Excel moves the contents
of the selection onto the Office Clipboard.
3. Select the location where you want to place the data you are moving.
To tell Excel where to move the selection, click the cell in the upper-left
corner of the range into which you want to move the data.
4. Paste the data by choosing the Edit➪Paste command.
Alternatively, you can click the Paste toolbar button. When you do, Excel
copies the previously copied range selection from the Office Clipboard
to the workbook location that you identify in Step 3.
Moving and copying formulas
You can move and copy formulas in the same way that you move and copy
other stuff stored in cells. However, you need to know something really
important about copying formulas: Excel adjusts the cell addresses used in a
formula when you copy the cell or cells that store the formula.
This sounds very strange, but let me show you a quick example of how this
adjustment occurs. You will see immediately why the adjustment is useful.
Take a look at the simple budgeting workbook shown in Figure A-3. As you
can see, this simple spreadsheet calculates totals for a budget. The totals
appear in row 6. Because Excel adjusts cell addresses when it copies them, if
you copy the formula in cell B6 to cells C6 and D6, Excel ends up placing the
correct formula into cells C6 and D6.
In cell B6, the formula is =B2+B3+B4+B5. This formula sums the values for
the first month. Obviously, you don’t want to use this formula in cell C6,
however. Excel guesses that this is the case when it copies the formula from
B6. What Excel places into cell C6, therefore, is the formula =C2+C3+C4+C5.
What Excel places into cell D6 is the formula =D2+D3+D4+D5.

Formatting Cell Contents
508
Excel doesn’t adjust the cell addresses in formulas in a range selection when
you move cell contents. The adjustment of cell addresses and formulas
occurs only when you copy formulas.
You can flag, or mark, those cell addresses that you don’t want adjusted
when they are copied. To do this, you precede the column letter and row
number with a dollar sign ($) to tell Excel that the address should not be
adjusted. For example, if the cell address $A$1 is used in a formula, Excel
won’t adjust the column letter or row number if it copies the formula. Excel
calls these fixed cell addresses absolute references. You can also tell Excel to
adjust only one portion of the cell address by using the dollar sign ($) in
front of only the column letter or the row number. For example, if the cell
address A$1 is used in a formula, Excel will adjust the column letter but not
the row number.
Formatting Cell Contents
Excel allows you to format the contents of the cells in a workbook. For exam-
ple, you can choose the font, the point size, and special effects, such as bold
facing, underlining, or italics for a workbook or a range.

509
For values and formula results, you can also add standard punctuation,
including dollar signs, percentage symbols, decimal points, and commas for
separating thousands.
In general, you format a cell or range by selecting the range and then using
either the Formatting toolbar buttons or commands from the Format menu.
The Formatting toolbar, for example, provides a font box that you can use to
select the font for the selected range. The Formatting toolbar also provides a
Font Size box for specifying the point size of text and numbers in the selected
range.
The Format menu provides commands for formatting the contents of cells
and for changing the size of rows and columns. You can learn how to use the
Format menu commands by experimentation. For example, if you want to
change the font used in a range selection, choose the Format➪Cells com-
mand. Click the Font tab, and then use the tab’s boxes and buttons to make
your changes. Figure A-4 shows the Font tab.
Functions Are Simply Formulas
Here’s another important tidbit to know about Excel: Although you can con-
struct very complicated formulas by using the standard arithmetic opera-
tors, Excel provides prefabricated formulas called functions that make it easy
to calculate standard measurements. For example, Excel provides a function
to easily calculate an arithmetic mean, or average. And Excel provides a
function to calculate the payment on a car loan.
Figure A-4:
The Font 
tab of the
Format Cells
dialog box.

Functions Are Simply Formulas
510
A simple example demonstrates how this works. If you look back at the
worksheet shown in Figure A-3, you can see (or guess) that the formula in
cell B6 adds the values in B2, B3, B4, and B5. With what you already know
about Excel formulas, you can construct a total formula that adds these
values. For example, you can enter the formula =B2+B3+B4+B5 into cell B6.
If you look closely at the area that’s just beneath the Excel menu bar and
toolbar, you can see what’s known as the formula bar. The formula bar
shows you the contents of the selected cell. In Figure A-3, the selected cell is
B6, so the formula bar shows you the contents of cell B6, which happens to
be the formula that adds the values in cells B2, B3, B4, and B5.
You can also use a function to make this same calculation. To add a series of
values, you use the SUM function. Then you include as function arguments,
or function inputs, either the individual values, individual cell addresses, or
range selections. For example, to show you how this works in the case of the
worksheet shown in Figure A-5, you can enter the formula =SUM(B2:B5) into
cell B6.

Function formulas use a standard set of conventions:
✦The first part of this formula is the equal sign (=). Because functions are
formulas, you begin a function with an equal sign.
✦The next part of the function formula gives the function name. In the
case of the SUM function, the function name is SUM.
✦The third part of the formula function includes the function inputs, or
arguments, inside parentheses. In the worksheet shown in Figure A-5,
the inputs are included as a range reference B2:B5.
Sometimes functions are so simple that you won’t need any help remember-
ing how the arguments should appear or what arguments the function needs.
The SUM function, for example, is one that spreadsheet users construct so
frequently they usually memorize its syntax after only a few uses.
Other functions, however, such as the functions to calculate a loan payment,
require several arguments in a particular order. For more complicated func-
tions, you typically want to use the Insert Function command. To use the
Insert Function command, choose Insert➪Function. Excel displays the Insert
Function dialog box, as shown in Figure A-6.
If you don’t know what function you want, you can type a brief description of
whatever you want to calculate in the Search For A Function text box, shown
at the top of the dialog box, and click Go. Alternatively, you can select a cate-
gory of functions from the Or Select A Category drop-down list box. This list
box provides several categories of functions, including financial functions,
date and time functions, mathematical and trigonometric functions, statisti-
cal functions, text functions, and so on.
Figure A-6:
The first

Function
dialog box.

Saving and Opening Workbooks
512
Based on what you type in the first text box or based on the category that
you select from the drop-down list box, Excel displays a list of possible func-
tions in the bottom portion of the Insert Function dialog box. You search
through this list to find the function that you want. If you click a function in
the list, Excel displays a brief description of the function and shows the
arguments needed for the function to calculate.
After you find the function that you want to use, click OK. Excel then displays
the Function Arguments dialog box, as shown in Figure A-7. The Function
Arguments dialog box provides text boxes that you use to supply the argu-
ments, or inputs, to the function. Function arguments can be values or cell
addresses.
After you supply the needed function arguments, click OK. Excel enters a for-
mula function into the active cell by using the function name and function
arguments that you’ve provided.
As mentioned earlier, after you know a function’s arguments, you can type
the function directly into cells. To do this, click the cell, type the equal sign,
the function name, and then the beginning parenthesis — (. Excel displays a
pop-up box that names the arguments (just to remind you of their order).
You enter each of the arguments, separating individual arguments with
commas. After you type the last argument, you type the ending parenthesis
[)] and press Enter.
Saving and Opening Workbooks
As you may expect if you’ve worked with other Microsoft applications such
as Microsoft Word, Excel saves and opens its workbook documents in a pre-
dictable way.
Figure A-7:

Saving and Opening Workbooks
513
Saving a workbook
To save a workbook, choose the File➪Save command. The first time that you
want to save a workbook, you choose either the Save or Save As command.
Excel displays the Save As dialog box, as shown in Figure A-8.
To save the workbook, you use the Save In box to select the folder in which
the workbook document should be saved. Then, you enter a name for the
workbook by using the File Name box. Typically, you don’t have to worry
about any of the other buttons or boxes on the Save As dialog box. You
simply click the Save button. Excel saves your workbook in a specified loca-
tion by using the specified name.
After you save a workbook for the first time, you can save the workbook
again by choosing the File➪Save command or by clicking the Save toolbar
button. When you choose File➪Save, or click the Save button, Excel saves
the workbook, using the same name and the same location.
If you want to save a copy of the workbook in a new location or use a new
name, you choose the File➪Save As command. Excel then displays the Save
As dialog box, as shown in Figure A-8. Just as you do the first time you save a
workbook, you use the Save In drop-down list box to choose a folder loca-
tion for the workbook and the File Name text box to name the file.
Opening a workbook
To open an existing workbook, you can either display the contents of the
folder storing the workbook by using the Windows Explorer or the My
Computer window, or you can open Excel and then choose the File➪Open
command.
Figure A-8:
The Save As
dialog box.

Printing Excel Workbooks
514
If you want to open Excel workbook documents directly from Windows, first
display the folder’s window by using either Windows Explorer or the My
Computer window. When Windows shows the Excel workbook document
that you want to open in a folder window, simply double-click the workbook.
Windows starts Excel and tells Excel to open the workbook.
You can also open workbook documents by choosing the File➪Open com-
mand. When you do, Excel displays the Open dialog box, as shown in Figure
A-9. To use the Open dialog box, use the Look In drop-down list box to spec-
ify the folder in which the workbook should be stored. Then, after Excel lists
the workbooks in the folder, select the workbook that you want to open and
click Open.
Printing Excel Workbooks
You print Excel workbooks in roughly the same manner as you print other
documents. First, you start Excel and open the document — in the case of
Excel, a workbook — that you want to print.
After Excel opens the workbook, you choose the File➪Print command. Excel
displays the Print dialog box, as shown in Figure A-10. After Excel displays
the Print dialog box, select the printer on which you want to print the docu-
ment from the Name list box. Use the Print Range buttons and boxes to spec-
ify what part of the workbook you want to print. Use the Number of Copies
box to specify how many copies of the workbook you want to print. Then
click OK.

One Other Thing to Know
515
If you have a question about one of the buttons or boxes in the Print dialog
box, click the ? button, located in the upper-right corner of the dialog box,
and then click on the button or box that you don’t understand. A text box
offering context-sensitive help appears.
You can click the Preview command button shown in the lower-left corner of
the Print dialog box to see a preview of the printed page. Figure A-11 shows a
previewed printed document. You can click the document with the mouse to
alternatively magnify and reduce the size of the document shown. You can
use the Next and Previous buttons to page through your document. When
you want to finally print the document, you click the Print button (duh).
Often you’ll have a workbook that looks perfect on-screen (and it is), only to
realize that it was just a little bit too wide to fit on a single sheet of paper.
When this happens, Excel prints two pages for every page that you think
you’re printing, thus leaving you to reprint — or tape all those sheets
together in a haphazard banner. A quick preview would save you all this grief
(not to mention time, ink, and paper).
One Other Thing to Know
The preceding list of skills doesn’t cover every feature or function of Excel.
However, with the skills that I just described, you can do most of the things
that people do with Excel.
Figure A-10:
The Print

One Other Thing to Know
516
If you have been working with other Windows applications — particularly
Microsoft applications — you can see that none of what you are going to do
with Excel is all that complicated. Mostly, it all comes down to entering text
labels, values, and simple formulas into worksheet cells. And although your
formulas may become very complicated, the mechanics of using Excel to
build those formulas isn’t particularly difficult.
If you’ve read the preceding paragraphs of this appendix and find yourself
scratching your head, you probably need to learn more about Excel from
some other learning resource. You may be able to get the skills that you
need simply by experimenting with Excel. You may also want to pick up a
good tutorial on Excel, such as a recent version of Excel For Dummies, by
Greg Harvey (Wiley Publishing, Inc.).

any business people think that when it comes to running a business,
the government is there to get in the way by creating complicated tax
codes, requiring various licenses, making long lists of things that businesses
must and must not do, and so on. Well, okay, this is all true. However, ironi-
cally enough, the government also has a bunch of Web sites that can be an
enormous help to people who run a business. Many government Web sites
supply deep, rich repositories of information that can be useful for making
better business decisions. This appendix, therefore, discusses and describes
some of the most useful government Web resources, including the Bureau 
of Economic Analysis, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Census Bureau,
EDGAR (the Web site for the Security and Exchange Commission), the Web
site for the Federal Reserve, the access database of the Government Printing
Office, and the Web site for the Internal Revenue Service.
Bureau of Economic Analysis
As noted at the BEA Web site (www.bea.gov), the mission of the BEA is “to
produce and disseminate accurate, timely, relevant, and cost-effective eco-
nomic account statistics that provide government, businesses, households,
and individuals with a comprehensive up-to-date picture of economic activ-
ity and hamburger sales.” (Okay, I slipped in the part about the hamburgers.)
Not surprisingly then, the Bureau of Economic Analysis gives business
people lots of information about U.S. economic growth, regional economic

518
development, and the nation’s position in the world economy. The Bureau of
Economic Analysis Web site (see Figure B-1) provides Internet users with
fast and easy access to most of the BEA’s publications.
Information available at the BEA Web site
Much of the information available at the BEA Web site is available for 
downloading. One minor problem exists with regard to downloading this
information, unfortunately. The volume of information available at the BEA is
overwhelming. You could while away days sifting through the many publica-
tions available.
To explore what’s available, just click various hyperlinks. For example, to see
the data related to the United States’ gross domestic product, you click the
Gross Domestic Product link, which appears (roughly speaking) in the
middle of the Web page

Downloading a BEA publication
To download a BEA publication, follow these steps:
1. Find the file or publication that you want to download.
Web pages, typically, include brief descriptions of what publications
contain. But you may do some head-scratching before you learn which
publications are most valuable.
2. To save the publication file on your local computer, right-click the
publication’s hyperlink and then click Save Target As.
3. When your Web browser displays the Save As dialog box (see Figure
B-2), use the Save In drop-down list box to pick the folder location that
you want to use.
You should leave the default contents of the File Name box alone. This is
the actual name of the publication file.
4. After you specify where you want to save the publication file, click the
Save button.
Uncompressing a BEA publication
Your Web browser sometimes downloads a compressed file when you
retrieve a BEA publication. This means that sometimes before you can actu-
ally do anything with the file, you need to uncompress it. To uncompress a
publication file, follow these steps:
Figure B-2:
The Save As
dialog box.

Bureau of Labor Statistics
520
1. Open the folder holding the publication.
In order to unzip the compressed publication file, you need to open the
file. This means that the first thing you do is display the folder that holds
the file. If you’re using a Microsoft Windows operating system, you use
either the My Computer window or the Windows Explorer browser to
display the contents of the folder where you stored the compressed
publication file.
2. Right-click the compressed publication folder to open it.
Windows displays a shortcut menu of commands.
3. Select the Unzip or Extract command.
Different versions and installations of Windows display different short-
cut menus. One of the commands you see, however, unzips the zipped,
or compressed, folder. Select this command and follow its instructions.
Using the BEA publication
Textual portions of the publication are often in a word processing document.
You can easily open this document by using almost any word processor.
Tabular data, however, is often stored in a spreadsheet file format. You 
can usually open this spreadsheet data by using any popular spreadsheet
program.
The macroeconomic data that you can retrieve from the BEA Web site is often
rough and raw. Nevertheless, this information can be very interesting to busi-
ness professionals. For example, being able to view overall growth in your
industry over the last ten years gives you a useful backdrop for considering
both your own growth and future growth prospects. Looking at the absolute
size of your industry, of course, also gives you ideas as to how large you can
grow. Finally, looking at other related industries outside of your industry may
spur useful discussions about opportunities for growth elsewhere.
Bureau of Labor Statistics
As described in its mission statement, the Bureau of Labor Statistics is the
“principal fact-finding agency for the federal government in the broad field of
labor economics and statistics. The BLS is an independent, national statisti-
cal agency that collects, processes, analyzes, and disseminates essential sta-
tistical data to the American public, the U.S. Congress, other federal agencies,
state and local governments, business and labor. The BLS also serves as 
the statistical resource to the Department of Labor.” The Bureau of Labor
Statistics Web site (stats.bls.gov), not surprisingly, provides a whole
bucketload of information related to labor economics (see Figure B-3).

Information available at the BLS Web site
The BLS Web site contains a ton of useful information for business users.
Web site designs change frequently, so I’m not going to tell you exactly what
hyperlinks to click to get what, but I will tell you about a couple useful tid-
bits (or shark-sized bites, actually) of information available here. The BLS
Web site contains statistics covering the following broad topics:
✦Inflation and consumer spending
✦Wages, earnings, and benefits
✦Employment and unemployment
✦Productivity
✦Safety and health
✦Business costs
✦Demographics
✦Occupations
✦Industries
✦Geography
✦International statistics

522
The other useful area of the BLS Web site is its Publications and Research
Papers areas, which lets you view online versions of most of the Bureau of
Labor Statistics publications.
The Career Guide to Industries hyperlink leads to an interesting book that
describes the jobs available in different industries and the average wages
paid. This may be useful for employers, obviously, but it may also be an
interesting tool for students and young people planning careers (there’s also
a separate Kid’s Page).
Using Bureau of Labor Statistics information
To view information in a particular area, such as employment and unemploy-
ment, you scroll down to that portion of the Web page. Then you click on the
hyperlink that names the BLS survey or program about which you want to
get more information. For example, looking back at Figure B-3, you can see
one of the first hyperlinks listed is Consumer Price Index. If you click this
hyperlink, the BLS Web site displays a list of publications related to con-
sumer price index statistics (see Figure B-4).

Some of the publications and documents available from the Bureau of Labor
Statistics Web site are simple text files, which you can read with your Web
browser (see Figure B-5).
You can easily import tabular data from text publications into a spreadsheet
program, such as Microsoft Excel. To do this, use your Web browser to save
the Web page as a text document. Then open the text file by using your spread-
sheet program. Microsoft Excel automatically starts an import wizard that
asks how the text file information should be arranged into rows and columns
of table data.
Some of the Bureau of Labor Statistics publications are also available as .pdf
files. The .pdf file format preserves the formatting of printed publications. 
To view and to print .pdf documents, such as the publication in Figure B-6,
you need a .pdf reader such as Adobe Acrobat Reader (which can be down-
loaded for free from www.adobe.com).

Assuming that you have a .pdf reader, when you click on a hyperlink that
points to a .pdf file, your Web browser downloads the .pdf file and then tells
your operating system to open the newly downloaded file using Adobe
Acrobat Reader. To read this document, simply scroll through the article. To
move through the pages of a .pdf document, you can also click the Previous
Page, Next Page, First Page, and Last Page buttons. (These buttons are the
arrow buttons on the toolbar just beneath the address box.) To print the
document, click the Print button. To save a copy of the .pdf document, click
the Save tool. Adobe Acrobat Reader also provides other tools for navigating
a .pdf document, including Zoom tools and even a Find tool for locating text
within the .pdf document.
Census Bureau
The Census Bureau, as many of us know, collects and provides demographic
data about people and the economy of the United States. The Census Bureau
Web site, at www.census.gov, provides links to much of the data that the
Census Bureau collects and disseminates. Figure B-7 shows the U.S. Census
Bureau home page.

Information available at the 
Census Bureau Web site
The Census Bureau Web site provides two categories of information that are
interesting to business users: the People & Households area that you can
reach (unsurprisingly) by clicking the People & Households hyperlink on the
home page, and the Business & Industry area that you reach by clicking the
Business & Industry hyperlink on the home page.
If you click the People & Households hyperlink, the Census Bureau Web site
displays the Population and Household Economic Topics Web page (see
Figure B-8). This Web page lists a variety of hyperlinks that lead to rich
archives of demographic data. For example, you can click the Computer
Ownership and Use hyperlink to see a Web page that describes computer use
and ownership in the United States and provides hyperlinks that you can click
in order to download documents that give more information on this topic.
If you click on the Business & Industry hyperlink provided on the Census
Bureau home page, the Census Bureau Web site displays the Census Bureau
Economic Programs Web page (see Figure B-9). This Web page also provides a
link to the Economic Briefing Room, which lists press releases and census
bureau reports on topics such as manufacturing, shipments and orders, home
ownership, housing starts, and international trading goods and services.

The Census Bureau Economic Programs Web page also displays hyperlinks
to numerous areas of interest to business managers and professionals. Your
best bet is to simply explore these hyperlinks.
Using the Census Bureau’s publications
To read a report, simply click the report’s hyperlink. If you click the Housing
hyperlink on the Census Bureau’s home page and then the Home Ownership
hyperlink on the Housing Web page, for example, you see the housing Vacan-
cies and Home Ownership Web page, which amounts to a table of Web pages
and downloadable documents. To see a particular Web page or document,
predictably, you click the hyperlink.
Many of the documents provided by the U.S. Census Bureau Web site use the
.pdf file format. To print, save, or read a document stored in the .pdf format,
you need Adobe Acrobat Reader, available for free at www.adobe.com.
Using the Census Bureau search engine
If you click on the Search hyperlink, the Census Bureau Web site provides 
a handy search form (see Figure B-10) that lets you search on words and
phrases. If the search engine finds documents that meet your search criteria,
it displays a document list Web page from which you can view matching doc-
uments or Web pages.
Using the Census Bureau site index
The Subjects Index, available whenever you click the Subjects A-Z hyperlink,
displays an index of all the documents and resources available on the U.S.
Census Bureau Web site. This useful tool is another way to track down or
search for publications or resources for useful information.
SEC EDGAR
EDGAR, an acronym for Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval
system (www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml), performs automated collection, val-
idation, indexing, acceptance, and forwarding of submissions by companies
and others who are required by law to file forms with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission (see Figure B-11).

Filing companies and individuals may choose to submit their documents to
EDGAR by using either plain text or .html. Documents submitted in either
plain text or .html formats are official filings. However, many companies also
supply .pdf versions of their documents, just for kicks (.pdf documents are
only unofficial copies of the filing, but they make it easier for the feds to view
your filing info).
Information available through EDGAR
EDGAR doesn’t give you access to all publicly filed documents — only those
that are filed electronically. Companies were phased into EDGAR filing over a
three-year period ending May 6, 1996. After that date, all public domestic
companies have been required to file their quarterly, annual, and other
public statements using EDGAR.
The Descriptions of SEC forms hyperlinks at the EDGAR Web site point to a
.pdf document that provides descriptions of the most common filings made
with the SEC. If you have a question about what document you want, your
best bet is to start with this Web page.
Searching the EDGAR database
To use EDGAR to look up publicly filed information on a publicly held com-
pany, first display the EDGAR database home page by clicking the Search for
Company Filings hyperlink. This Web page doesn’t actually let you begin a
search, but it lets you choose what type of search you want to perform (see
Figure B-12):
✦Search Companies and Filings
✦Latest Filings
✦Historical EDGAR Archives
✦CIK (Central Index Key) Lookup

The Search the EDGAR Archives search form allows you to include Boolean
operators in your search argument. The Boolean operators are AND, OR, NOT,
and ADJ. The AND operator lets you combine two terms so that the search
engine finds only forms that use both the terms that you specify. The OR oper-
ator lets you join two terms so that the search engine finds forms that use one
or both words. The NOT operator lets you specify that forms using a particular
term should be excluded. The ADJ operator lets you ensure that your search
only finds forms in which the one word follows the other word — in other
words, the second argument that you enter is adjacent to the first argument.
The Federal Reserve Web Site
The U.S. Federal Reserve System Web site (www.federalreserve.gov)
provides information about the activities of the Federal Reserve System
(“the Fed,” not to be confused with “the Feds,” who like to show up at your
door wearing unfashionable suits and packing heat). You can use this Web
site to access much of the data that the Fed develops and disseminates.
Figure B-14 shows the Federal Reserve System home page. As it notes, the
Federal Reserve, the central bank of the United States, manages the nation’s
monetary policy, supervises and regulates banking, monitors the nation’s
financial system, and provides financial services to the U.S. government and
other public agencies.
Figure B-14:

The Federal Reserve Web Site
532
Information available at the 
Federal Reserve Web site
The list of hyperlinks along the left edge of the home page summarizes the
information available at the Federal Reserve Web site. Many of these hyper-
links are self-explanatory, single-page discussions, or single-page tables of
contents. The New and Events hyperlink, for example, links to a list of press
releases, and this list provides another set of hyperlinks that you use to get
actual press releases.
Obviously, a business person’s interest in the information provided by the
Federal Reserve Web site depends on what industry you are in and the respon-
sibilities that you have. That said, however, much of the macroeconomic 
information provided at the Federal Reserve Web site is very interesting —
especially to anybody involved in the banking industry.
✦The News and Events hyperlink, for example, leads to a Web page that
provides a list of hyperlinks to testimony and speeches by people like
the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Ben S. Bernanke. The News
and Events Web page also provides hyperlinks to Federal Reserve press
releases.
✦The Monetary Policy hyperlink leads to the Monetary Policy Web page,
which lists, describes, and provides hyperlinks to Federal Reserve Board
monetary policy reports, including the Beige Book.
✦The Banking Information and Regulation hyperlink leads to the Banking
Information and Regulation Web page, which provides hyperlinks to
detailed information about financial holding companies, large commer-

Using the Government Printing Office Access Site
One relatively unknown government Web site that is extremely valuable is
the Government Printing Office’s Web site (www.gpoaccess.gov), shown in
Figure B-15.
Information available at the GPO Access site
The Government Printing Office Web site gives you online access to proba-
bly every government publication that is actively being printed and is avail-
able online. This means that you can use the GPO Web site to get publica-
tions from any of the other Web sites discussed in this chapter, such as the
Bureau of Economic Analysis, the Census Department, or the Internal
Revenue Service — as well as documents published by other government
agencies.
Searching the GPO Access database
To use the GPO Access database, you click the Federal Resources by Topic
hyperlink, which is just barely visible in Figure B-15. (The hyperlink is visible at
the bottom of the screen in the figure.). When the Federal Resources Organized
by Topic Web page appears, you use its boxes to select the general category in
which you want to look for documents and click Go.

When the GPO Access search engine finds government publications that
match your search terms, it lists them in a Search Results Web page.
You may need to click around a bit to find what you’re looking for, but the
GPO Access database is truly mind-boggling in its breadth and depth. Get
crazy. Dude. Seriously. Explore this online document treasure.
Using the Internal Revenue Web Site
I know that you probably get goosebumps just reading this heading, but the
Web site of the IRS (www.irs.gov) shown in Figure B-16, deserves mention-
ing. Although the Web site is tailored for consumers, and not businesses, it is
still incredibly useful to anybody in business. From this Web site, you can
retrieve printable versions of nearly all the Internal Revenue Service’s publi-
cations and forms.
Before you go stampeding off to print those forms, click the Businesses hyper-
link (or something similar; these Web sites are notorious for changing things
on you). Here you’ll find all sorts of information applicable to businesses.

Okay, now that you’ve gone to the Business page, I’ll show you how to get
your forms. From the Businesses Web page, click the Forms and Publications
hyperlink. When you do, the IRS Web site displays a bunch of different
hyperlinks to help you locate the form you need, as shown in Figure B-17.
Click the Forms and Instructions link to display another Web form (see
Figure B-18) that provides a list box of forms, instructions, and publications
that you can download. To choose a form for downloading, click it. You can
download multiple forms by holding down the Ctrl key as you click. After
you click or select the forms that you want to retrieve, click the Review
Selected Files button. The IRS Web site displays a Web page that lists the
forms that you selected. To download one of these forms, right-click the
Forms hyperlink and choose either the Save Target As command to save the
document onto your local computer, or the Print Target command to print
the document.
The IRS provides three file formats: .pdf, xml, and .sgml text. .Pdf is probably
the most common format and the one you’ll want to use if you have a copy
of a .pdf reader like Adobe Acrobat Reader. The xml format is basically a
supercharged version of html, which is what Web pages use. You can also
use the .sgml text file format if you want to print just the textual portion of
the instructions or forms. The .sgml text format doesn’t provide the nice
clean formatting of a form, however. It only provides the textual instructions.

Appendix C: Glossary of
Accounting and Financial Terms
ABA transit number: The number that identifies the bank against which a
check is drawn. Every check has an ABA (American Bankers Association)
transit number, usually located in the upper-right corner. The number —
actually two numbers separated by a hyphen — identifies the bank’s loca-
tion and the bank’s name.
ABC (activity-based costing) management: An approach to cost accounting
that tries to more accurately assign overhead costs and more precisely
measure the profits of a firm’s products, services, and business units. Refer

earned (typically, when you prepare an invoice) and expenses are recorded
as they occur (typically, when you receive an invoice).
accrued interest: Interest earned on a bond or certificate of deposit, but
paid at some future date — such as when the bond or certificate of deposit
is sold.
ad valorem: Latin for to the value. Sales and property taxes are calculated
ad valorem, as a percentage of the property value or the thing being sold.
adjuster: The insurance company representative who decides how much
insurance settlements should be.
affidavit: A signed statement promising that you will fulfill an obligation.
Affidavit means has pledged his faith in Latin.

amortization schedule: A schedule for making payments on a mortgage. 
The schedule shows the number of payments, when payments are due, 
how much of each payment goes toward the principal and how much goes

a court of law. If the arbitration is binding, the parties involved are required
to agree to the settlement.
arm’s-length transaction: A transaction made between a buyer and seller
who have no relationship to one another. Transactions made between sub-
sidiary companies of the same parent company are not arm’s-length transac-
tions because the companies may not be acting in their own self-interest but

assessed valuation: For tax purposes, the value of a property. Usually, prop-
erty taxes are paid as a percentage of the assessed valuation of the property.
assessment: The amount charged, such as for property taxes.
