Ratios Overview
The ratios in this book are tools. They are primarily tools for turning the 
data contained in financial statements into information used by managers and 
executives to better understand what is happening in a company. Like all tools, 
they can be used for things other than their original design, such as evaluating 
an acquisition, creating pro-forma statements related to potential courses of 
action, or figuring out which stock to buy.
Financial ratios can typically be grouped into one of the following ratio types:
Market value ratios
• 
Liquidity ratios
• 
Performance ratios
• 
Cash flow ratios
• 
Profitability ratios
• 
Debt ratios
• 
There are a small number of ratios that do not fit into any of these categories. 
However, we have included them as we have found them very useful ourselves 
and believe that they make for a more complete book.

Chapter 1 | Ratios Overview
2
Once a company has had several years of financial ratios, these can then be 
compared across these years to see if there is a positive or negative develop-
ment. There are many ratios and all are great to use when a development is 
to be analyzed.
The following sections provide a short overview of each of the above ratio 
types along with a list of common examples, all of which will be defined and 
discussed in subsequent chapters.
Market value ratios
Market value ratios measure how cheap or expensive the company’s stock 
is based on some measure of profit or value. Market value ratios can assist 
management or an investor in assessing the market’s opinion of the company’s 
value. Generally, the higher the market value ratio, the higher the company’s 
stock price will be because the market thinks growth prospects are good and/
or they believe the company to be less risky as an investment.
Common market value ratios include the following:
Dividend payout ratio
• 
Dividend yield
• 
Earnings per share (EPS)
• 
Enterprise value
• 
Price to book value ratio
• 
Price to earnings ratio (P/E ratio)
•

Liquidity ratios
Liquidity ratios measure the company's ability to pay off short-term debt 
­obligations. Most obviously, they can be used to see if a company is in ­trouble 
and evaluate their ability to make loan payments or pay suppliers. Less 
­obviously, they can be used to judge a company’s ability to take on more debt, 
or spend more cash, to explore new means for growth through innovation or 
acquisition.
Common liquidity ratios include the following:
Acid test
• 
Cash conversion cycle
• 
Cash ratio
• 
Current ratio
• 
Operating cash flow
• 
Quick ratio
• 
Working capital
• 
Performance ratios
Performance ratios (also known as activity ratios) measure a company’s ability 
to generate sales and derive profit from its resources. Performance ratios are 
used to measure the relative efficiency of a company based on the use of its 
assets, leverage, or other such balance sheet items.
Companies must often strike a balance between the inefficiencies of having 
too few or too many assets. For example, in the case of too little inventory, 
you may risk disruption to production and loss of sales. However, sitting on 
inventory that does not move is a very inefficient use of cash.

Chapter 1 | Ratios Overview

Common performance ratios include the following:
Average collection period
• 
Fixed assets turnover
• 
Gross profit margin
• 
Inventory turnover
• 
Receivable turnover
• 
Total assets turnover
• 
Cash flow ratios
Cash flow ratios measure how much cash is generated and the safety net that 
cash provides to the company to finance debt or grow the business. Cash flow 
ratios provide an additional way of looking at a company’s financial health and 
performance. Many use the term “cash is king” because it is so vital to the 
health of an organization.
Common cash flow ratios include the following:
Cash flow coverage
• 
Dividend payout ratio
• 
Free cash flow
• 
Operating cash flow
• 
Profitability ratios
Profitability ratios can be thought of as the combination of many of the other 
more specific ratios to show a more complete picture of a company’s ­ability 
to generate profits. The king of all ratios, return on equity (ROE), can be 
­broken down by the DuPont formula in simple terms as ROE = Margin x Turn 
x Leverage. You can see how this takes into account other operating ratios. 
Many of the ratios in this section follow the same concept.
Common profitability ratios include the following:
Current yield
• 
Profit margin
• 
Return on assets (ROA)
• 
Return on net assets (RONA)
• 
Return on equity (ROE)
• 
Return on investment (ROI)

Debt ratios
Debt ratios measure the company’s overall debt load and the mix of equity 
and debt. Debt ratios give us a look at the company’s leverage situation.  
Debt ratios can be good, bad, or indifferent, depending on a host of factors 
including who is asking. For example, a high total debt ratio may be good for 
stockholders not wanting to dilute their shares but bad for the creditors of 
the company.
Common debt ratios include the following:
Asset to equity
• 
Asset turnover
• 
Cash flow to debt ratio
• 
Debt ratio
• 
Debt to equity
• 
Equity multiplier
• 
Interest coverage
•

Most ratio calculations are based on data from the hypothetical ABC 
Company, whose financial data are listed in that company’s income statement, 
balance sheet, cash flow statement, and additional company information given 
in Chapter 3.
Where the ABC Company data are not applicable to certain ratio calcula-
tions, we use data from the hypothetical XYZ Company.

Acid test (Quick ratio)
Type: Liquidity measure
Formula
Acid test
Current assets
Inventory
Current liabilities
=
-
Description
The acid test ratio shows whether a company has enough short-term assets 
to cover its immediate liabilities without selling inventory. The higher the acid 
test ratio, the safer a position the company is in.
Example
ABC Company has currents assets in the amount of $69,765, inventory in the 
amount of $24,875, and current liabilities in the amount of $28,500. This gives 
an acid test of 1.58. An acid test of 1.58 indicates that the company has suf-
ficient current assets to cover its current liabilities more than one and a half 
times over without selling inventory.

The acid test is very similar to the current ratio except that it excludes inven-
tory because inventory is often illiquid. The nature of the inventory and the 
industry in which the company operates will determine if the acid test or the 
current ratio is more applicable.
Note
The acid test is also known as the quick ratio.

Account receivable turnover  
(Receivable turnover)
Type: Performance measure
Formula
Accounts receivable turnover
Sales
Receivables
=
Description
The accounts receivable turnover measures the number of times receivables 
are converted into cash in a given period. This is different from the average 
collection period, which shows the number of days it takes to collect the 
receivables.
Ideally, credit sales should be used in the numerator and average receivables 
in the denominator. However, these are most often not easily available in the 
financial statements.
Example
ABC Company has sales in the amount of $210,000 and accounts receivable 
in the amount of $28,030. This gives an accounts receivable turnover ratio 
of 7.49. The higher the accounts receivable turnover ratio, the better the 
company is at converting receivables into cash. A decline in the turnover ratio 
could mean either a decline in sales or an indication that the customers are 
taking a longer time to pay for their purchases.

The company can improve the turnover ratio by many methods; the most 
popular is by offering a discount if the customers pay their outstanding  
balance earlier; for example, within 30 days of the sale.
Note
Accounts receivable turnover is also known as receivable turnover.

Description
The additional funds needed (AFN) is an approximation tool to determine how 
much external funding a company would require in order to increase sales (if 
the company is operating at full capacity), given the amount of assets needed to 
generate those sales. AFN tells you how much outside cash a company needs 
to support linear growth. Because many of the factors used in AFN require 
estimation, you can see that AFN really only provides a ballpark figure.
Example
The AFN equation can be written as follows:
AFN = (Ao/So) DS - (Lo/So) DS – M (S1) ´ (1 - POR)

Altman’s Z-Score
Type: Other
Formula
Z-Score = 1.2A + 1.4B + 3.3C + 0.6D + 1.0E
A = Working capital/Total assets
B  = Retained earnings/Total assets
C = Earnings before interest & tax/Total assets
D = Market value of equity/Total liabilities
E  = Sales/Total assets
Description
The Altman’s Z-Score was developed to predict the probability that a company 
will go into bankruptcy within two years. The lower the Z-Score, the greater 
the probability the company will go into bankruptcy within the next two years. 
A score less than 1.8 indicates that the company is likely headed for bank-
ruptcy, whereas a score above 3.0 indicates that the company has a low risk 
of bankruptcy.
Example
ABC Company has a Z-Score of 5.49. This means that there is a very low 
probability of the company going into bankruptcy within the next two years.
Z-Score = 1.2(1.29) + 1.4(0.36) + 3.3(0.42) + 0.6(0.77) + 1.0(1.59)

Asset to equity
Type: Debt measure
Formula
Asset

equity = 
Total assets
Shareholder equity
-
-
Description
The asset-to-equity ratio (also known as the equity multiplier) gives a sense of 
how much of the total assets of a company are really owned by shareholders 
as compared to those that are financed by debt. Some businesses thrive more 
on borrowing money (leverage) than other companies.
High assets-to-equity may be good for them. However, there is always some 
point for any company at which their assets are overleveraged. That can be 
dangerous to the shareholders and their investment in the company (e.g., 
Lehman Brothers was so overleveraged in 2007 that their asset-to-equity was 
31! Calls on their debt in 2008 more than wiped out the company).
Example
ABC Company has total assets in the amount of $132,000 and shareholder 
equity in the amount of $52,070. This gives an asset-to-equity ratio of 2.54. 
Thus, the business has about $2.54 of assets for every dollar of shareholder 
equity.

Debt financing typically offers a lower rate compared to equity. However, too 
much debt financing is rarely the optimal structure because debt has to be 
paid back even when the company is going through troubled times.

Asset turnover
Type: Performance measure
Formula
Asset turnover
Sales
Assets
=
Description
The asset turnover ratio measures the sales generated per dollar of assets and 
is an indication of how efficient the company is in utilizing assets to generate 
sales.
Asset-intensive companies such as mining, manufacturing, and so on will gen-
erally have lower asset turnover ratios compared to companies that have 
fewer assets, such as consulting and service companies.
Example
ABC Company has sales in the amount of $210,000 and total assets in the 
amount of $132,000. This gives an asset turnover ratio of 1.59.

This means that for every dollar invested in assets, the company generates 
$1.59 of sales. This number should be compared to the industry average for 
companies in the same industry.

Audit ratio
Type: Other
Formula
Audit ratio
Annual audit fee
Sales
=
Description
The audit ratio measures the cost of an audit in relation to the sales of the 
company. An increase in the audit ratio could indicate that additional audit 
procedures were required because of problems with the company’s account-
ing records or control procedures. It could also indicate additional procedures 
were needed because of a change in legislation. When the Sarbanes-Oxley 
Act was written into law, it resulted in significant increases in audit fees as a 
result of additional testing and control procedures.
Example
ABC Company has sales in the amount of $210,000 and annual audit fees in 
the amount of $200. This results in an audit ratio of 0.095%.

Description
The average collection period indicates the amount of time (in days) it takes a 
company to convert its receivables into cash.
Example
ABC Company has accounts receivable in the amount of $28,030 and credit 
sales in the amount of $210,000. In this example, credit sales and total sales are 
identical. This gives an average collection period of 48.72 days, which means 
that it takes a little over one and a half months for the company to convert 
credit sales into cash.

The company’s credit terms will have a significant impact on the average col-
lection period: the better the credit terms, the higher the average collec-
tion period. An increase in the average collection period could indicate an 
increased risk of the company’s customers not being able to pay for their 
purchases. A possible result is that the company will have to hold greater 
levels of current assets as a reserve for potential losses or bad debt expense. 
Most large companies (nonretail) do not handle many cash sales. Therefore, 
when looking at financial statements, it can be assumed that total sales do not 
include any cash sales. However, in smaller companies and in retail businesses, 
cash sales can be a significant part of the total sales.
Note
The average collection period is also known as days sales outstanding.

Basic earning power (BEP)
Type: Profitability measure
Formula
Basic earnings power
EBIT

=
Description
The basic earning power (BEP) shows the earning power of the company’s 
assets before taxes and debt service. It is useful for comparing companies 
that otherwise could not be compared because of different tax situations and 
different degrees of financial leverage. This ratio is often used as a measure of 
the effectiveness of operations.
Example
ABC Company has earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) in the amount of 
$13,525 and total assets in the amount of $132,500. This gives a basic earnings 
power ratio (BEP) of 0.10.

Formula

Description
The book value per share measures common stockholders’ equity determined 
on a per-share basis and is an indication of how the investors view the value 
of the company’s assets. If the market value per share is higher than the book 
value per share, then the investor is willing to pay a premium over the book 
value to acquire the company’s assets.
Example
ABC Company has common equity in the amount of $52,070 and a total 
of 10,000 shares outstanding. This gives a book value per share of $5.20 at 
December 31, 2013.

ABC Company has a market value per share of $6.15. The reason could be 
that there are certain intangibles assets within the company such as customer 
list, distribution channels, or know-how, and so on, which the company can-
not record as an asset under U.S. or international accounting standards. As 
a result of this, the investor is willing to pay a premium over book value to 
acquire the assets of the company.

Description
The breakeven point, often used in cost accounting, is the point at which the 
company breaks even on a given product and neither incurs a profit nor a loss. 
The breakeven point shows the minimum amount of sales required for the 
company to begin making a profit.
Example
XYZ Company is considering investing in a new production unit that costs 
$1,000,000 to support the increased demands in sales. The fixed cost for 
the new unit once installed is $200,000 annually. The company has calculated 
a contribution margin of 68%. This gives a breakeven point of $292,306, or 
61,538 units.

´
(
)
Description
The capital asset pricing model (CAPM) is a theoretical model used to deter-
mine the required rate of return for an investor when considering a particular 
stock to purchase. The stock’s required rate of return is equal to the risk-free 
rate of return plus a risk premium reflecting only the risk remaining after 
diversification.
Investors most often use 10-year U.S. treasury bill or bond rate as a proxy for 
the risk-free rate. Beta is most often calculated by a third party and is avail-
able online. Market risk premium is the market rate of return less the risk-free 
rate. The market rate of return can be based on past returns. The economist 
Peter Bernstein calculated the average rate of return to be 9.6% over the past 
200 years. This rate of return is often applied by investors when using the 
capital asset pricing model.
Example
An investor could use CAPM to determine the required rate of return to 
invest in ABC Company. If we assume that the rate of a 10-year U.S. treasury 
bill is 2%, the Beta for ABC Company is 0.9, and the market rate of return is 
9.6%, we can calculate CAPM as follows:

By using CAPM, an investor can compare the required rate of return to an 
expected rate of return for the company over the investment horizon. If the 
investor does not think that the stock will yield a return of 8.84% over the 
investment period, he should not buy the stock.

The amount of leverage that is right for the company varies based on the 
industry in which the company operates and the maturity of the company as 
well as other factors. What is optimal for one company might not be right for 
another. However, low debt and high equity levels in the capitalization ratio 
generally indicate lower risk for investors.

Description
The cash flow per share ratio is very similar to earnings per share, but this ratio 
uses cash instead of earnings. Earnings can theoretically be manipulated from 
quarter to quarter more easily than cash can. Thus, tracking cash flow per 
share can show a better picture of what is going on with the company.
Some financial analysts place more emphasis on cash flow than earnings as a 
measure of the company’s financial situation.
Example
ABC Company has operating cash flow in the amount of $8,145. There are no 
preferred shares in ABC Company; thus, there is no preferred dividend. Total 
number of shares outstanding amounts to 10,000. This gives a cash flow per 
share of $0.81 as of December 31, 2013.

The cash flow to debt ratio indicates the company’s ability to cover total debt 
with its annual cash flow from operations. A high cash flow to debt ratio puts 
the company in a strong position to cover its total debt.
Example
ABC Company has cash flow from operations in the amount of $8,145 and 
total debt (short term and long term) in the amount of $22,005. This gives a

Example
ABC Company has accounts receivable in the amount of $28,030 and credit 
sales in the amount of $210,000. In this example, credit sales and total sales 
are identical. This gives a collection period of 48.72 days, which means that it

The company’s credit terms will have a significant impact on the average col-
lection period: the better the credit terms, the higher the average collection 
period. An increase in the collection period could indicate increased risk of 
the company’s customers not being able to pay for their purchases. A possible 
result is that the company will have to hold greater levels of current assets 
as a reserve for potential losses or bad debt expense. Most large companies 
(nonretail) do not handle many cash sales. Therefore, when looking at financial 
statements; it can be assumed that total sales do not include any cash sales. 
However, in smaller companies and in retail businesses, cash sales can be a 
significant part of the total sales.

Collection period is also known as the average collection period or as days

CAGR also eliminates spikes and drops (especially for companies that are 
very seasonal in nature) during the selected period and a good tool when 
comparing different companies growth rates.
Example
ABC Company has the following annual sales between 2011 and 2013, which 
means that there are two growth periods e.g., 2011 to 2012 is one growth 
period and 2012 to 2013 is another growth period:

Example
XYZ Company is considering investing in a new production unit that costs 
$1,000,000 to support increased demands in sales. The fixed cost for the new 
unit is $200,000 annually. The new production unit can produce 240,000 units  
annually. The company expects to sell 135,000 units the first year at a sales 
price of 4.75 per unit, generating total sales of $641,250. The variable cost 
of each unit is $1.50 amounting to $202,500 in annual variable cost. This 
results in a contribution margin of $438,750 and a contribution margin ratio

Description
The cost of capital, also known as weighted average cost of capital or WACC, 
measures the company’s average costs of financing. Companies have many 
sources of capital, mostly debt and equity.
WACC measures the weighted average cost of these two sources. This rate is 
most often used in capital allocation for evaluating future projects. In general, 
all projects that the company takes on should yield a return greater that the 
weighted average cost of capital.
Example
ABC Company has total debt in the amount of $79,930. The weight of the 
company’s financing is 61% debt and 39% equity, the rate of which is financed 
at 7% and 13%, respectively. The company’s effective tax rate is 22%. Tax rate 
used in the calculation should be the company’s effective tax rate and not the 
statutory rate.
This gives a weighted average cost of capital in the amount of 8.40%. Projects 
that are not expected to return greater than 8.40% would generally be declined 
unless they show some other noneconomic benefit to the company.

The current ratio indicates the extent to which current liabilities can be “cov-

cash, and securities. Current liabilities include accounts payable, short-term 
notes, current portion of long term debt, and accrued expenses.
Example
ABC Company has currents assets in the amount of $69,765 and current 
liabilities in the amount of $28,500. This gives a current ratio of 2.45.

Thus, the company has almost two and a half times more current assets than 
current liabilities. This number is useful for comparison with industry trends 
but includes so many items from the financial statements that a deeper dive is 
often required to determine if a ratio is “good.”
For example, a company using a just-in-time inventory system may have low 
inventory, making their current ratio lower but not necessarily indicating that 
there is a problem with meeting short-term obligations. Likewise, a company 
with bloated inventory may have a high current ratio and still have problems 
meeting short-term obligations.

The current yield, also known as dividend yield, is a measure of an investment’s 
return. The higher the current yield, the higher the return on the investment.
Typically, only profitable companies pay out dividends; therefore, investors 
often view companies that have paid out significant dividends for an extended 
period of time as a less risky investment.
Example
ABC Company has paid out dividend per share in the amount of $0.30 and 
has a share price at the end of the year in the amount of $6.15 per share. This 
gives a current yield in the amount of 4.87%, which means that the investor 
has earned 4.87% return if he has paid $6.15 for each share purchased.

company to pay its suppliers.
Example

Days payable ratio of 41.33 means that the company pays its suppliers 41.33 days  
after receiving the products. The days payable period is a reflection of the 
credit terms that are extended to the company by its supplier. In general, a 
ratio much higher than the industry average could mean that the company has 
liquidity problems and that the company is not paying its suppliers in a timely 
manner.
A decline in the payable period could be an indication of change in credit 
terms or an indication that the company has issues with its cash management. 
This number can be compared to the industry average, to other companies, or 
trended over time to see how a company is doing with payables. This number 
can also be compared to known payment terms to see if the company is pay-

Companies with lower debt to equity ratios are generally less risky than those 
with higher debt to equity ratios.

much debt financing is rarely the optimal structure, as debt has to be paid back

Description
The dividend payout ratio shows the percentage of earnings paid to sharehold-
ers in dividends and how well earnings support the dividend payments. More 
mature companies tend to have a higher payout ratio compared to growth 
companies. This is because growth companies can provide a higher return 
on investment by using the cash (dividend) to invest in the growth of the 
company.
Example
ABC Company has a dividend per share in the amount of $0.30 and earnings 
per share in the amount of $0.95. This gives a dividend payout ratio of 31.57%, 
which means that ABC Company paid 31.57% of its net income to its share-

payout policy; however, not all companies pay out an annual dividend. Growth 
companies would typically not pay out any dividend early on, whereas more 
mature companies typically pay out dividends. This is because growth compa-
nies can provide a higher return on investment, by using the cash (dividend) to 
invest in the growth of the company.
Example
ABC Company has paid out dividend in the amount of $3,000 based on a 
total number of outstanding shares of 10.000. This gives a dividend per share 
of 0.30 dollars.

A company with a year over year growth in the dividend per share is a posi-
tive sign that the company believes that the growth can be sustained. The 
growth in the dividend payout will also reflect positively on the company’s 
share price.
This number can be compared to the industry average or to other companies 
to evaluate potential investments.

Dividend yield (Current yield)

Description
The dividend yield, also known as current yield, is a measure of an invest-
ment’s return. The higher the dividend yield, the higher the return on the 
investment.
Typically, only profitable companies pay out dividends; therefore, investors 
often view companies that have paid out significant dividends for an extended 
period of time as a less risky investment.
Example
ABC Company has paid out dividend per share in the amount of $0.30 and 
has a share price at the end of the year in the amount of $6.15 per share. This 
gives a dividend yield in the amount of 4.87%, which means that the investor 
has earned 4.87% return if he has paid $6.15 for each share purchased.

Description
The DuPont ratio is an expression that breaks return on equity (ROE) into its 
three components to give a total picture of how the company is performing. In 
the DuPont formula, ROE is defined as profit margin multiplied by total asset 
turnover and the equity multiplier. When someone says “DuPont ratio” and 
you instantly think “margin-turn-leverage,” you are doing pretty well. What is 
important are the components, not necessarily the final number. Two com-
panies might have the exact same ROE, but their components could be very 
different, showing you different business strategies.

EBIT is an indicator of the company’s financial performance and provide inves-
tors useful information for evaluating different companies without regard to 
interest expenses or tax rates. By dropping interest and taxes from earnings, 
you normalize for companies with different capital structure and tax rates 
resulting in “apples-to-apples” comparisons.
Example
ABC Company has sales in the amount of $210,000 and operating expenses 
in the amount of $196,475. This amounts to $13,525 of EBIT.

for companies by eliminating capital structure, taxes, and depreciation and 
amortization schedule differences.
Example
ABC Company has EBIT in the amount of $13,525 and depreciation and amor-

The EBITDA to interest coverage ratio this ratio gives a measure of how much

amortization expenses, it gives a truer sense of how much cash the company 
will have to cover interest payments. The lower the ratio, the higher the like-
lihood that the company will not be able to service their debts, that is, pay 
interest expenses on its debt.
Example
ABC Company has EBITDA in the amount of $14,000 and interest expenses 
in the amount of $1,190. This gives an EBITDA to interest coverage ratio in 
the amount of 11.76, which means that the company has earnings more than 
11 times its interest expense.

The earnings per share ratio shows the portion of a company’s profit allocated

indicator of a company’s profitability.
Example
In 2013, ABC Company had net income in the amount of $9,475 and total 
number of outstanding shares of 10,000. This gives earnings per share of 
$0.95, which means that the company generates net income of $0.95 for each

Generally, the higher the earnings per share the better a company is doing 
for the shareholders. An increase in EPS year over year is typically a sign of a 
growth or a mature company. Some companies buy back shares to improve 
earnings per share without necessarily increasing net income. It is therefore 
important to not only look at EPS in isolation but to compare EPS to the total 
number of shares outstanding.

Example
ABC Company has total net operating capital in the amount of $99,605, return 
on invested capital of 12.44% and WACC of 8.40%. This gives economic value

The effective tax rate explains the various rates at which a company’s income 
is taxed as a result of different tax jurisdictions both domestically and inter-
nationally. Companies also employ strategies to minimize tax. To compute 
the effective (or average for the year) tax rate, total tax expense is divided by 
earnings before tax.
Example
ABC Company has total tax expenses for the year in the amount of $2,970 
and earnings before tax in the amount of $12,445. This gives an effective tax 
rate of 23.86%.

Note
Companies with significant lower than average tax rate compared to other 
companies in its industry might be very aggressive on their tax strategies. 
This could pose a risk of tax exposure in the form of a tax audit with reversal  
of the chosen tax treatment and could also result in tax penalties and  
other fees.

The enterprise value is a measure of a company’s value as a functioning entity,

were to purchase (buy out) a firm, you would start with its enterprise value 
and work from there to determine your offer. Thus, you can see why cash is 
subtracted because you would get that cash in the deal to offset what you are 
buying, debt and equity.
Example
ABC Company has a market cap of $61,500, debt in the amount of $22,005, 
and cash and cash equivalents amounting to $16,450. The company does not 
have any minority interest or any preferred shares. This gives an enterprise

is publicly available. Calculating the enterprise value for private companies 
are for the same reason not that easy as there is no public market for the 
company’s stock. A common approach to valuing equity of a private company 
is to compare the entity to similar companies, that is, industry, debt structure, 
results, and growth opportunities, which are public traded.

Description
The equity multiplier, also known as assets to equity ratio, gives a sense of how 
much of the total assets of a company are really owned by shareholders as 
compared to those that are financed by debt. Some businesses thrive more on 
borrowing money (leverage) than other companies. High assets to equity may 
be good for them. However, there is always some point for any company for 
which their assets are overleveraged. That can be dangerous to the sharehold-
ers and their equity (e.g., Lehman Brothers was so overleveraged in 2007 that 
their assets to equity was 31! Calls on their debt in 2008 more than wiped 
out the shareholders).
Example
ABC Company has total assets in the amount of $132,000 and shareholder 
equity in the amount of $52,070. This gives an equity multiplier of 2.54. Thus, 
the business has $2.54 of assets for every dollar of shareholder equity.

Formula

Description
The fixed assets turnover measures how effectively the company uses its assets 
to generate sales. The higher the ratio, the better the company is at generating 
sales from its assets.
The fixed assets typically include property, plant, and equipment. Other assets 
such as goodwill, deferred taxes, and other nonproperty, plant, and equipment 
items are typically excluded to provide a more meaningful and comparative 
ratio. In most cases, these assets are not directly involved in generating sales 
and are therefore excluded.
Example
ABC Company has sales in the amount of $210,000 and total fixed assets in 
the amount of $32,620, which gives a fixed asset turnover ratio of 6.44. This 
means that for each dollar invested in fixed assets the company is generating 
$6.44 of sales.

Fixed asset turnover varies significantly from industry to industry. For exam-
ple, a manufacturing company will have a much lower fixed asset turnover 
compared to a service company with little to no assets. It is therefore impor-
tant to compare the ratio with comparable companies. A sudden decline in 
the fixed asset turnover ratio could be an indication that that the company 
has recently invested significantly in fixed assets. A decline could also indicate 
that the company has sold fixed assets or fully depreciated assets without 
acquiring new assets.

capital.
Example
ABC Company has NOPAT in the amount of $10,298 and capital expenditure

One of the most common debt ratios is gearing. This ratio measures how

ers and it is another measure of financial health. A company with a large 
amount of debt will have a very gearing ratio, whereas one with little debt will 
have a low gearing ratio. Companies with lower gearing ratios are generally 
less risky than those with higher gearing ratios.
Example
ABC Company has total liabilities in the amount of $51,430 and equity in the 
amount of $52,070 this give a debt to equity ratio of 0.98.

A Gearing ratio of 0.98 is not uncommon. However, there is no specific opti-

debt (including short- and long-term debt) and equity financing. Debt financing 
typically offers the lowest rate because of its tax deductibility. However, too 
much debt financing is rarely the optimal structure as debt has to be paid back 
even when the company is going through troubled times.

The gross profit margin measures how much gross profit is generated for each

depreciation and amortization, finance cost, and taxes.
Gross profit margin will vary significantly between companies in different 
industries. For example, companies with significant fixed assets will typically 
have a higher gross profit margin than companies with low fixed assets such 
as service companies.
Example
ABC Company has sales in the amount of $210,000 and cost of sales in the 
amount of $163,000, which gives a gross profit margin of 22.38%. A gross 
profit margin of 22.38% means that for each $100 of sales generated by the 
company, $22.38 is gross profit to cover the company’s operating costs.

A change in the company’s gross profit margin could be a result of price 
pressure from competitors, meaning that the company maintains the current 
cost structure while lowering sales prices. It could also be a result of higher 
cost of sales. This could be true if goods are imported, which typically adds 
another layer of expenses to the cost of sales, that is, fluctuations in foreign 
currents. Often, it can also be explained with a shift in product mix. It is 
therefore important to look at the gross profit margin on each product or  
product line.

which you don’t have specific financial data but expect the company to grow 
at some constant rate.
Example

The interest coverage, also known as times interest earned (TIE), indicates the 
company’s ability to pay interest on its outstanding debt and to what extent 
operating income can decline before the company is unable to meet its annual 
interest expenses.
The lower the ratio, the higher the likelihood that the company will not be 
able to service its debt (pay interest expenses on its debt). If the interest 
coverage ratio gets below 1, the company is not generating enough earnings 
to service its debt.
Example
ABC Company has earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) in the amount of 
$13,525 and interest expenses in the amount of $1,190. This gives an interest 
coverage ratio in the amount of 11.37, which means that the company has 
earnings more than 11 times its interest expense.

calculated as cost of goods sold over ending inventory for that period.
Example
ABC Company has sales in the amount of $210,000 and inventory in the 
amount of $24,875; this gives an inventory turnover ratio of 8.44.

COGS can also be used here to give a more accurate number but most indus-
try publications use sales (which is inflated by the difference between retail 
price and COGS).
Using the inventory at a specific time may make the ratio less accurate. For 
the sake of comparison, it is better to use an average inventory, especially if 
the business is seasonal in nature.

Leverage
Type: Debt measure

Description
The most well-known financial leverage ratio is the debt to equity ratio. This 
leverage ratio measures how much of the company is financed by its debt 
holders compared with its owners and it is another measure of financial 
health. A company with a large amount of debt will have a very high debt to 
equity ratio, whereas one with little debt will have a low debt to equity ratio. 
Companies with lower leverage are generally less risky than those with higher 
debt to equity ratios.
Example
ABC Company has total liabilities in the amount of $51,430 and equity in the 
amount of $52,070; this gives a debt to equity ratio of 0.98.

A debt to equity ratio of 0.98 is not uncommon. However, there is no spe-
cific optimal capital structure for a company. There needs to be a balance 
between debt and equity financing. Debt financing typically offers the lowest 
rate. However, too much debt financing it is rarely the optimal structure as 
debt has to be paid back even when the company is going through troubled 
times.

Description
The market capitalization (market cap), also known as market value of equity, 
is the total market value of all of a company’s outstanding shares. Market cap 
is calculated by multiplying the company’s shares outstanding by the current 
share price. Investors often use market cap to determine a company’s size, as 
opposed to sales or total asset figures.
Example
ABC Company has a stock price of $6.15 per share at December 31, 2013 
and 10,000 of shares outstanding. This gives a market cap of $61,500.

Description
The market to book ratio, also known as price to book ratio, measures the 
relative value of a company compared to its share price. The ratio can also be 
calculated as total market value over total book value as the “per share” part 
of the equation cancels out.
Market to book ratio is a great tool to quickly determine whether a company is 
under or overvalued. If the company has a low market to book ratio, it is most 
likely undervalued and could be considered a good investment opportunity.
Example
ABC Company has a share price of $6.15 at the end of the year and a book 
value per share of $5.20 also at the end of the year. This gives a market to 
book ratio of 1.18. This means that the company is overvalued and that the 
investors are willing to pay a premium to purchase the shares. A market to 
book ratio of less than 1 could indicate that the company is undervalued.

The market value added shows the difference between the market value (mar-

equity). The higher the market value added, the more value a company has 
created for shareholders. Should this number be negative, it means that inves-
tor capital has been destroyed.
Example
ABC Company has a market cap of $61,000 and invested capital in the amount 
of $52,070. This gives a market value added of $9,430.

Description
The operating profit margin is a measurement of what proportion of a com-
pany’s revenue is left over after paying for variable costs of production such 
as wages, raw materials, and so on. A healthy operating margin is required 
for a company to be able to cover other costs such as depreciation, inter-
est expenses, profit to shareholders, and profit to invest in the growth of 
the company. Another way to look at it is that operating profit margin tells 
you how good the company is at generating profits from its core business, as 
opposed to all other aspects of the company.
Example
ABC Company has earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) in the amount 
of $13,525 and sales in the amount of $210,000. This gives an operating profit 
margin of 6.44%.

their core business, instead of other means, and how much of the operating

the company to pay its suppliers.
Example
ABC Company has accounts payable in the amount of $18,460 and credit 
purchase per day in the amount of $163,000. This gives a payable period of 
41.33 days.

Payable period ratio of 41.33 means that the company pays its suppliers 41.33 days 
after receiving the products. The payable period is a reflection of the credit 
terms that are extended to the company by its supplier. In general, a ratio 
much higher than the industry average could mean that the company has 
liquidity problems and that the company is not paying its suppliers in a timely 
manner.
A decline in the payable period could be an indication of change in credit 
terms or an indication that the company has issues with its cash management. 
This number can be compared to the industry average, to other companies, or 
trended over time to see how a company is doing with payables. This number 
can also be compared to known payment terms to see if the company is pay-

you are really buying the future earnings of that company. By dividing the price 
by the earnings gives you some sense of the value of the stock in comparable 
terms.
Example

The receivable turnover measures the number of times receivables are con-

period which shows the number of days it takes to collect the receivables.
Ideally, credit sales should be used in the numerator and average receivables 
in the denominator. However, these figures are often not readily available in 
the financial statements.
Example
ABC Company has sales in the amount of $210,000 and receivable in the 
amount of $28,030. This gives a receivable turnover ratio of 7.49. The higher 
the receivable turnover ratio is, the better the company is at converting 
receivables into cash. A decline in the turnover ratio could mean either a 
decline in sales or an indication that the customers are taking a longer time 
to pay for their purchases.

The company’s credit terms will have a significant impact on the average col-

period. An increase in the receivable collection period could indicate increased 
risk of the company’s customers not being able to pay for their purchases. A 
possible result is that the company will have to reserve for potential losses or 
expense bad debt. Most large companies (nonretail) do not handle many cash 
sales. Therefore, when looking at financial statements, it can be assumed that 
total sales do not include any cash sales. However, in smaller companies and in 
retail businesses, cash sales can be a significant part of the total sales.

ROE is a valuable number both on its own and compared to other compa-
nies. Ideally, you will invest in companies with the highest ROE. All companies 
strive to make ROE higher. See the DuPont formula for a breakdown of ROE 
into its component to better understand the full picture of how a company 
generates ROE.

Description
The return on assets shows how profitable a company’s assets are in generat-
ing revenue, that is, a ratio of 25% means that for every $100 of investment in 
assets, net income of $25 is generated.
Example
ABC Company has net income in the amount of $9,475 and total assets in the 
amount of $132,000. This gives an ROA of 7.18%. This means that for every 
$100 of investment in assets the company generates $7.18 of net income.

Description
The return on capital, also known as return on invested capital (ROIC), mea-
sures a company’s efficiency in allocating capital under its control to profitable 
investments.
When the ROC is greater than the cost of capital (WACC), the company is 
creating shareholder value; when it is less than the cost of capital, shareholder 
value is destroyed as the company grows. This is one case in which sales 
growth is not always desirable!
Example
ABC Company has net income in the amount of $9,475, dividend payout in 
the amount of $3,000, and total invested capital in the amount of $52,070. 
This gives an ROC in the amount of 12.44%.

Description
The return on net assets is a measure of the financial performance of the com-
pany that relates earnings to the company’s assets that generate earnings; 
fixed assets such as equipment and property, and working capital. The higher 
the ratio, the better the company is at efficiently using its assets.
Example
ABC Company has net income in the amount of $9,475 and fixed assets plus 
working capital in the amount of $73,885. This gives a RONA of 12.83%. This 
means that for every $100 of investment in net assets the company generates 
$12.83 of net income.

The return on sales shows the company’s operational efficiency. ROS is also 
known as the company’s operating profit margin or the margin before interest 
(which can vary by company based on capitalization) and taxes (which also 
vary by company).
Example
ABC Company has earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) in the amount of 
$13,525 and net sales in the amount of $210,000. This gives a return of sales 
(ROS) of 6.44%. This means that for every $100 of sales, the company gener-
ates $6.44 of EBIT.

Description
The revenue per employee shows the company’s sales in relation to its number 
of employees.
Example
ABC Company has sales in the amount of $210,000 and the total number of 
employees of 875. This gives revenue per employee in the amount of $240. 
This means that on average each employee generates $240 of sales.

A company can use this ratio to compare itself to other companies in the 
same industry. A company wants the highest revenue per employee possible, 
everything else equal, as it denotes higher productivity.
Note
Comparing one company’s revenue per employee to another usually tells you 
as much about their industries as it tells you about the specific companies. 
The revenue per employee ratios generally tend to be lower in consulting and 
services companies compared to manufacturing companies in other industries 
that have invested significantly in fixed assets.
Pipeline, mining, and energy are some of the industries with the highest rev-
enue per employee. At the other end of the spectrum are companies in the 
consulting and food and service industry.

The rule of 72 shows the approximate number of years that it takes to double 
an investment at a given interest rate, by dividing the interest rate into 72.
Example
ABC Company has an investment in the amount of $100,000 that yields 12%

Description
The sustainable growth rate measures the maximum growth rate the com-
pany can sustain without changing its capital structure, for example, having to 
increase its financial leverage or issuing equity. In this case, the terminology 
should really be “self-sustainable” as the sustainable growth rate is the maxi-
mum rate a company can grow without going to outside sources for capital.
Example
ABC Company has a return on equity of 18% and a dividend payout ratio of 
31.57%. Using the SGR, this gives a sustainable growth rate of 12.32%.

in which the company expects a constant growth rate in perpetuity. Terminal 
value is often used in valuation models for the period beyond which you don’t 
have specific financial data but expect the company to grow at some constant 
rate.
Example
ABC Company has free cash flow in the amount of $5,360, WACC in the 
amount of 8.4%, and an assumed constant growth rate of 3%. This gives a 
terminal value in the amount of $102,237.

Times interest earned (TIE)
Type: Debt measure
Formula

=
Description
The times interest earned, also known as interest coverage, measures a com-
pany’s ability to pay interest on its outstanding debt and to what extent oper-
ating income can decline before the company is unable to meet its annual 
interest expenses.
The lower the ratio, the higher the likelihood that the company will not be 
able to service its debt (pay interest expenses on its debt). If the TIE ratio 
goes below 1, the company is not generating enough earnings to service its 
debt.
Example
ABC Company has earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) in the amount of 
$13,525 and interest expenses in the amount of $1,190. This gives a TIE ratio 
in the amount of 11.37, which means that the company has earnings more 
than 11 times its interest expense.

The total assets turnover ratio measures the sales generated per dollar of assets 
and is an indication of how efficient the company is in utilizing their assets to 
generate sales.
Asset-intensive companies such as mining, manufacturing, and so on will gen-
erally have lower asset turnover ratios compared to companies that have 
fewer assets such as consulting and service companies.
Example
ABC Company has sales in the amount of $210,000 and total assets in the 
amount of $132,000. This gives a total asset turnover ratio of 1.59.

WACC means weighted average cost of capital, also known as cost of capital, 
and measures the company’s average costs of financing. Most companies are 
financed by both debt and equity.
WACC measures the weighted average cost of these two sources of capital. 
This rate is most often used in capital allocation for evaluating future projects. 
In general, all projects that the company takes on should yield a return greater 
that the weighted average cost of capital.
Example
ABC Company has total debt in the amount of $79,930. The weight of the 
company’s financing is 61% debt and 39% equity, the rate of which is financed 
with 7% and 13%, respectively. The company’s effective tax rate is 22%. Tax 
rate used in the calculation should be the company’s effective tax rate and not 
the statutory rate.
This gives a weighted average cost of capital in the amount of 8.40%. Projects 
that are not expected to return greater than 8.40% would generally be declined 
unless they show some other noneconomic benefit to the company.

Working capital ratio

Formula
Working capital ratio

Description
The working capital is the capital that a company has for day-to-day opera-
tions. The working capital ratio indicates whether the company has enough 
short-term assets (current assets) to cover its short-term liabilities (current 
liabilities) and thus leave the company with “working capital” to support its 
current operations. A ratio below 1 is an indication of negative working capi-
tal, meaning that the company will most likely not be able to cover its current 
short-term obligations.
Example
ABC Company has current assets in the amount of $67,765 and current lia-
bilities in the amount of $28,500. This provides the company with a working 
capital ratio in the amount of $41,265 and a working capital ratio of 2.44.

This means that the company can cover its short-term liabilities almost

capital ratio they need to meet in order to get funding from lenders.
Working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities.
Working capital = Current assets – Current liabilities
Working capital = 69,765 – 28,500 = 41,265

Capital 
Allocation
Capital allocation is the process used to analyze projects and decide which ones 
should or should not be included in the company’s capital budget (plan for 
spending money on growth and sustaining current operations). This chapter 
gives you the tools to make these decisions based upon potential growth and 
profitability. After the analysis has been performed, the capital budget itself out-
lines the planned expenditures on capital assets. The capital allocation process 
is important as it outlines the long-term investment strategy of the company.
The tools that we will describe in this chapter are:
Net present value (NPV)
• 
Internal rate of return (IRR)
• 
Modified internal rate of return (MIRR)
• 
Payback method
• 
Discounted payback method
• 
Profitability index (PI)
• 
Total cost of ownership (TCO)
• 

Chapter 4 | Capital Allocation
116
Large projects with high risk require more analysis. Smaller projects or 
replacement projects can often be analyzed by simply looking at the payback 
method or the internal rate of return.
These tools provide a variety of information to the key decision makers. By 
using Microsoft Excel it is very easy to set up the various formulas and com-
pare each project’s costs, benefits, and rates of return against those of others.

Net present value (NPV)
Description
The net present value (NPV) of a project is the present value of the future cash 
inflows less the present value of the future cash outflows discounted at the 
cost of capital (WACC). The higher the net present value, the more desirable 
it is to undertake the project.
Example
ABC Company considers investing in one additional production unit. The cost 
of the new unit is $4,650 and is estimated to produce net cash inflows in the 
amount of $5,520 over a three-year period. At the end of year three, the value 
of the production unit will be equal to zero.
The easiest way to calculate a projects NPV  is to set up the year over year 
cash flows in Excel and use the Excel “=NPV” function to calculate the return 
as illustrated here:

Based on the initial investment, the expected cash inflows, and the cost of 
capital of 5%, the new production unit will have an NPV of $296. This number 
can be compared to other projects to help determine a course of action with 
regard to capital allocation. At the very least, this number is positive and indi-
cates that it is a worthwhile investment by itself, but perhaps not when com-
pared to others or when considering the capital constrains of the company.

Chapter 4 | Capital Allocation
118
Internal rate of return (IRR)
Description
A project’s internal rate of return (IRR) indicates the discount rate that makes 
the net present value of all cash in and out flows from the specific project 
equal zero under the assumption that the return can be reinvested at the 
same rate (the IRR rate). This number is not necessarily helpful to managers 
by itself, but only when compared to the IRR of other projects and to the 
company’s WACC. The higher a project's internal rate of return, the more 
desirable it is to undertake the project.
Example
ABC Company considers investing in one additional production unit. The cost 
of the new unit is $4,650 and is estimated to produce net cash inflows in the 
amount of $5,520 over a three year period as laid out in the spreadsheet 
shown here. At the end of year three, the value of the production unit will be 
equal to zero. The easiest way to calculate a project’s IRR is to set up the year 
over year cash flows in Excel and use the Excel “=IRR” function to calculate 
the return as illustrated here:

Based on the expected cash flows, the new production unit will have an inter-
nal rate of return (IRR) of 7.94%. Again, this IRR alone tells you very little; it 
needs to be compared to other projects’ IRRs and to the company’s WACC 
in order to determine if the project should be pursued or not.

119
Modified internal rate of return (MIRR)
Description
Modified internal rate of return (MIRR) is no different than the internal rate of 
return (IRR) except that is assumes that the cash flows from the project are 
reinvested at the company’s cost of capital (WACC) instead of the IRR. This 
makes MIRR a better indicator of the project’s true benefit to the organiza-
tion. The higher a project's modified internal rate of return, the more desir-
able it is to undertake the project.
Example
ABC Company considers investing in one additional production unit. The cost 
of the new unit is $4,650 and is estimated to produce net cash inflows in the 
amount of $5,520 over a three-year period as shown below. At the end of 
year three, the value of the production unit will be equal to zero.

in order to determine if the project should be pursued or not.

Payback method
Description
The payback method measures the time it takes for a company to recover the 
capital invested in the project. The model does not consider the time value 
of money, nor does it consider the cash flows beyond the payback period. In 
general, the shorter the payback period, the more desirable it is to undertake 
the project. The payback method is usually considered a “quick and dirty” 
capital allocation tool given these simplifying assumptions.
Example
ABC Company considers investing in one additional production unit that costs 
$7,540 and is estimated to produce net cash inflows in the amount of $9,200 
over a six-year period. Excel does not have a payback function but it can be 
calculated manually, by looking at the year where the cumulative cash flow 
becomes positive and dividing the cash flow from that year by the amount 
needed to become positive and adding it to that year.

Discounted Payback method
Description
The discounted payback method measures the time it takes for a company to 
recover the capital invested in the project. The discounted payback model 
takes into consideration the time value of money by discounting the cash 
flows at the cost of capital (WACC). This makes it a better indicator when 
compared to the regular payback method. In general, the shorter the dis-
counted payback period, the more desirable it is to undertake the project.
Example
ABC Company considers investing in one additional production unit. The cost 
of the new unit is $7,540 and is estimated to produce cash inflows in the 
amount of $9,200 over a six-year period. There is no specific function in excel 
to calculate the discounted payback period. However, it can be calculated 
manually as outlined below, where the payback period is the period in which 
the cumulative cash flow becomes positive.

Profitability index
Description
The profitability index measures the relative profitability of a project calculated 
by dividing the present value of future cash flows of a project by the initial 
investment required for the project. The higher the profitability index, the 
more desirable it is to undertake the project. A value less than one indicate 
that the present value of the project is less that the initial investment and is 
therefore a bad investment.
ABC Company considers investing in one additional production unit. The cost 
of the new unit is $4,650 and is estimated to produce cash inflows in the 
amount of $5,520 over a three-year period. At the end of year three, the 
value of the production unit will be equal to zero. Discounting the future cash 
inflows at a discount rate of 5% (WACC) gives a present value of $4,946.

Total cost of ownership (TCO)
Description
The tools discussed previously in this section are used to determine which 
projects should and should not be included in the capital budget. These tools 
often only highlight the direct benefits of the specific project under consider-
ation. Good managers know that most projects do not exist in a vacuum and 
that there are often intangible benefits and drawbacks associated with new 
projects that modeling does not always include.
A total-cost of ownership (TCO) analysis can be used to measure the current 
and future contribution that a projects implementation adds to the company. 
Its focus is not solely on quantitative measures but also qualitative measures 
that include direct and indirect benefits.
Direct benefits are cash flows directly associated with the project. Indirect 
benefits include items such as overhead, operating and maintenance, produc-
tivity improvement, and so on.
Measuring qualitative benefits can be much harder as these are softer benefits, 
such as employee satisfaction, better work environment, resulting in less sick 
days, and so on. Some economists call these social benefits.
TCO analyses are typically done with large projects, such as a new ERP imple-
mentation or a new office building, to afford management an overview of all 
the costs and benefits associated with this new initiative before allocating 
capital to the specific project.
Completing a TCO analysis is quite comprehensive and time-consuming. The 
main reason is that qualitative data is not easy to quantify as is often generated 
by interviews, observations and comparison to similar projects either within 
the company or with similar companies in the industry. Total cost of own-
ership should therefore mainly be considered with larger projects or when 
qualitative benefits are significant to the quantities ones.

Preface
We wrote this book specifically for today’s global financial and nonfinancial 
executives who are looking for an easy-to-use reference book on financial 
ratios and capital allocation to assist them in operational and strategic 
decision making. Our aim is to make financial ratios simple and intuitive for 
everyone to understand.
This book contains over one hundred financial ratios and other calculations 
commonly used in businesses around the world—including return on investment 
(ROI), return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE), economic value added 
(EVA), and debt ratio just to name a few.
We have also included a section on what financial and nonfinancial executives 
need to understand about capital allocation before entering the annual budget 
meeting or any other business meeting in which capital allocation is discussed. 
This section describes tools such as net present value (NPV), internal rate of 
return (IRR), the payback method, and total cost of ownership. 
Given that a good understanding of financial ratios, valuation tools, and 
return on investment calculations are important components of any business 
system, we set out to create a simplified handbook with short descriptions, 
calculations, and examples for each of the ratios.
It is important to note that financial analysis is not always black and white. 
Two experienced finance people can sit down with identical financial 
information for a company, come up with different ratios, and both be right. 
Often, financial analysis is more of an art than a science. Accounting and 
business have their own language and, as with any language, sometimes the 
same words can have different meanings to different people. Always bear in 
mind that the particular meaning of a general ratio depends on context.
Consistency is key. Sometimes certain adjustments, such as non-recurring 
items, are made to specific line items, so as long as you are consistent in doing 
the same calculation year over year or when comparing companies against 
each other, your comparisons still have meaning. It may not matter if another 
accountant, colleague, or business manager gets a different answer; it is the 
internally consistent comparison and the underlying analysis that matter.

Preface 
xii
Microsoft Excel has built-in functions for some of the calculations in this 
book, such as IRR and NPV. The built-in functions may calculate ratios 
slightly different than the mathematical formulas do. Again, however, as long 
as you consistently use the same tool, any disparity between tools may not 
be analytically significant.
Some ratios are known by multiple names (e.g., the acid test is also known as 
the quick ratio). For completeness and easy reference, all ratios are duplicated 
under each name so no back-and-forth page turning is required. 
In some of the examples we have also given our readers a sense of the 
normal ranges of values for specific ratios in various industries.
Remember, the tools described in this book are just that—tools. Whether 
one carpenter uses a hammer slightly differently than the next carpenter 
does not matter as long as the job gets done properly. Provided you use the 
tools in this book consistently and with good business judgment, they can 
help you make good business decisions.
