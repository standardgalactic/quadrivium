Preface
In 1981, under the direction of the great scientist Xuesen Qian, an integrated
frontier science—Man–Machine–Environment System Engineering (MMESE)—
came into being in China. Xuesen Qian gave high praise to this emerging science.
In the letter to Shengzhao Long, he pointed out, “You are creating this very
important modern science and technology in China!” in October 22, 1993.
In the congratulation letter to the commemoration meeting of 20th anniversary of
establishing the Man–Machine–Environment System Engineering, the great sci-
entist Xuesen Qian stated, “You have made active development and exploration in
this new emerging science of MMESE, and obtained encouraging achievements.
I am sincerely pleased and hope you can do even more to make prosper devel-
opment in the theory and application of MMESE, and make positive contribution
to the progress of science and technology in China, and even in the whole
world” in June 26, 2001.
October 22, which is the day that the great scientist Xuesen Qian gave high
praise to MMESE, was determined to be Foundation Commemoration Day of
MMESE by the 2nd conference of the 5th MMESE Committee on October 22,
2010. On this very special day, the great scientist Xuesen Qian pointed out in the
letter to Shengzhao Long, “You are creating this very important modern science
and technology in China!” And the conference also determined that the Annual
Conference on MMESE would be held from October 21–23 to cherish the memory
of the great contributions that the great scientist Xuesen Qian had made to the
MMESE!
The 17th International Conference on MMESE will be held in Jinggangshan,
China, on October 21–23 of this year; hence, we will dedicate Man–Machine–
Environment
System
Engineering:
Proceedings
of
the
17th
International
Conference on MMESE to our readers.
Man–Machine–Environment System Engineering: Proceedings of the 17th
International Conference on MMESE is the academic showcases of the 17th
International Conference on MMESE joint held by MMESE Committee of China
and Beijing KeCui Academe of MMESE in Jinggangshan, China. The Man–
Machine–Environment System Engineering: Proceedings of the 17th International
ix

Conference on MMESE is consisted of 99 more excellent papers selected from more
than 500 papers. Due to limitations on space, some excellent papers have been left
out, and we feel deeply sorry for that. Crudeness in contents and possible incor-
rectness are inevitable due to the somewhat pressing editing time and we hope you
kindly point them out promptly, and your valuable comments and suggestions are
also welcomed.
Man–Machine–Environment System Engineering: Proceedings of the 17th
International Conference on MMESE will be published by Springer-Verlag,
Germany. Springer-Verlag is also responsible for the related matters on index of
Index to EI, so that the world can know the research quality and development trend
of MMESE theory and application. Therefore, the publication of Man–Machine–
Environment

Abstract A comparative survey was conducted with 163 Chinese male pilots to
build an anthropometric method based on computer graphics. 10 human body
dimensions of point-to-point distance were gathered by extracted measurement
based on computer graphic and traditional measurement in ISO7250 techniques. It
was found that the extracted measurements were homogeneous with the traditional
measurements in standardized Z scores, but there were systematic errors in raw data
of the anthropometric method based on computer graphics. It suggested that the
methodology based on computer graphics was well acceptable in views of
ISO20685 because all mean differences were less than ±1.0 mm in 95% conﬁdence
interval after data correction by linear equation. Some factors were also discussed.

Introduction
There were 172 basic human body measurements for technological design in
GB/T5703 [1] and totally 305 measurements which included 141 fundamental items
and 164 recommended items in GJB4856 [2]. All data of human body measurements
were collected by traditional methods with instruments such as the anthropometer,
callipers or tape speciﬁed in ISO7250-1 [3]; therefore, more than 1.0–1.5 h was
spent for every pilot’s survey on working ﬁeld and the duration of data collection
was about two years for the databank of GJB4856. In fact, these measures can be
gathered using a variety of instruments. For example, 3-D scanners could be used in

Method
2.1
Selection of Measurements
There were 10 dimensions of anthropometry drawn from integration of GJB4856,
GB/T5703 and ISO7250-1 which is deﬁned as point-to-point distance in Annex A
of ISO20685 [4]. The measurements listed in Table 1 could be representative of
201 linear items in GJB4856.
2.2
Methodologies of Data Collection
2.2.1
Extracted Measurement Based on Computer Graphics
Three classes of pictures were designed according to small, medium or large scale

The pictures were photographed on grid in centimeters as close to participant as
possible and stored in PC after digitalization as shown in Fig. 2.
An algorithm of computer graphics was programed to identify the anthropo-
metric landmark on the surface of human body in digital picture as a point to be
highlighted with jump in gray scale of image. The point-to-point distance could be
computed as raw data of extracted measurement mentioned above in Table 1.
2.2.2
Traditional Measurement with Traditional Instruments
The traditional measurer was an expert trained and experienced in ISO 7250
techniques. All data were collected by direct measurement with traditional instru-
ment precision of 1.0 mm in accordance with ISO7250-1 and GJB4856.

Discussions
4.1
Homogeneity of Two Subsamples of Data
All raw data were transformed into the standardized Z scores. It was suggested that
the extracted measurements based on computer graphics were homogeneous with
the traditional measurement in Table 2 by Levene’s test of equality of error vari-
ances in SPSS repeated measures(F(1324) = 0.00–0.42, P = 0.58–0.99). The
anthropometric method of extracted measurement on computer graphics was same
as the traditional anthropometric method in statistics.
4.2
Accuracy of Extracted Measurements
4.2.1
Systematic Error in Methodology
The analysis of mean difference was tested taking traditional measurement as norm
in the light of ISO20685. It was found that there were systematic errors in the
anthropometric method based on computer graphics as shown in Table 3.
4.2.2
Data Correction by Linear Equation
The correction of raw data was made by linear regression from extracted mea-
surement to traditional measurement. All corrected mean differences were less than

±1.0 mm in 95% conﬁdence interval (Table 4), which was near to the precision of
traditional instruments and presented the anthropometric method based on computer
graphics same as the traditional methods in this paper.
4.3
Some Considerations in Methodology Developing
An accurate and fast method of anthropometry was desired in recent decades
especially for human head and face, but results of studies were controversial. It was
demonstrated that 3D anthropometry can be replaced with manual methods in South
Korea with 10 hand measurements of 1700 teenager students [5], while it was found
in USA that the mean aberration was 7.96 mm between 3D photography to tradi-
tional method (P < 0.05) although the mean diversity could be reduced to 1.33 mm
after a cutoff of 10% extrema for calliper measurement data [6].
In China, Fang and Fang (7) revealed that the average error, maximum error and
standard deviations are 1.70, 5.63 and 1.47 mm comparing computerized anthro-
pometry to traditional method with 17 length measurements on head and face [7],
which went beyond the maximum allowable error in ISO20685. Wu et al. [8]
reported that the extracted measurements from 3D imagines were 1.9–8.0 mm more
than traditional measurements in average with 14 linear dimensions (P < 0.01 or
0.05) except of mouth breadth, nose height, and nose breadth for 150 male pilots
[8], which was partially acceptable by ISO20685.

Some factors should be emphasized in administration of comparative study for
anthropometric methodology in consideration of inﬂuences such as:
• The trained and experienced measurer in both methodologies;
• The smallest and visible landmarks on surface of human body;
• Homogeneity test of errors between methodologies; and
• Accurate algorithm of computer graphics to identify the landmarks and correct
raw data by regression versus traditional measurement.
It was also said that the skill of operators and the accurate positioning of
landmarks would greatly inﬂuence the measurement [8].
The nonlinear dimensions could be curved by computerized algorithm or pre-
dicted by basic measurement in GJB4856 [9].

Conclusions
A total of 163 male pilots participated in a comparative study to set up an
anthropometric method based on computer graphics. There were 10 items of
point-to-point distance to be surveyed with extracted measurement based on
computer graphic as well as traditional measurement with instruments such as
anthropometer, callipers and so on. The results were found that the extracted
measurements were homogeneous with the traditional measurements in standard-
ized Z scores, but there were systematic errors in the anthropometric method based
on computer graphics. All mean differences were less than ±1.0 mm in 95%
conﬁdence interval after raw data correction by linear equation which revealed that
the methodology based on computer graphics was well acceptable in views of
ISO20685.

Effects of Driving Experience and Hazard
Type on Young Drivers’ Hazard
Perception
Long Sun, Ruosong Chang and Shuang Li
Abstract Young novice drivers are found to be poor at detecting and responding to
hazards on the road. In this study, three groups of young drivers with 6, 12 and
18 month driving experience were asked to complete a hazard perception task and
their eye movements were recorded using Tobbi T120 eye tracker. The task con-
tained 20 video clips, and hazards in the clips were classiﬁed into overt hazard
(continuous visibility) and covert hazard (interrupted visibility) according to their
visibility of materialization. Results revealed that drivers reacted to overt hazards
faster than covert hazards. The experience-related differences in reaction time of the
three driver groups were due to the faster processing after the initial ﬁxation.
Drivers’ mean ﬁxation duration was inﬂuenced by hazard type, but not by driving
experience. These ﬁndings suggested that hazard type was a key factor when it
comes to hazard perception testing and training for young drivers.

Introduction
Crash rates are particularly higher during the ﬁrst month of licensure and decline
rapidly for about six months and then much more slowly for at least two years [1].
Among the factors that accounted for young drivers’ crash involvement, hazard
perception (HP) skill was a key factor. For example, young novice drivers’ scores
on a video-based HP test could predict their crash involvement in the next year
following the test [2].

When facing a speciﬁc hazardous situation, drivers are expected to detect the
potential hazard earlier, and then, they evaluate the hazardous level of the hazard
and decide whether a response is needed to avoid a collision [3]. This skill, naming
hazard perception, was a multi-component driving skill that can be improved
through training. However, some studies failed to ﬁnd the differences of HP per-
formance between young novice drivers and young experienced drivers [4, 5]. This
may partially due to the hazard type used in the HP studies. Another reason was the
experience-related differences in HP reaction time may derive from later detection
of hazard or/and the longer processing time after the initial ﬁxation [6].
Although many studies demonstrated that experienced drivers reacted to hazards
faster than novice drivers, little was known about the inﬂuencing mechanism of
hazard type on young drivers’ different HP processes. Thus, in this study, three
groups of young drivers with 6, 12 and 18 month driving experience were recruited.
And their HP performance under two types of hazard was examined using a
video-based HP task.

Methods
2.1
Participants
Forty-ﬁve young drivers agreed to participate in this study. Participants’ ages
ranged from 18 to 27 (mean = 23.20, SD = 2.18), and they have 6-, 12- and
18-month driving experience, respectively. Participants were classiﬁed into three
groups (labeled as 6-month, 12-month and 18-month drivers) according to their
driving experience since they obtained a valid driving license (see Table 1).
The three groups of drivers were signiﬁcantly different in their total driving
mileage. They were not signiﬁcantly different in their male-to-female ratio, age and
years of education. Participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. Each
participant received Ұ50 after he/she completed the HP task.

Materials
A hazard perception task was used in this study. The task contained 20 dynamic
video clips (lengths ranged from 9 to 20 s), and its discrimination validity was good
[7]. All video clips were shot from drivers’ perspective around Dalian urban area
under ﬁne weather. Each video clip showed a trafﬁc situation where a potential
hazard was developing slowly as the camera car was approaching. During the
experiment, participants could see the front part (hood) of the camera car.
Hazards in the clips were split into two types according to the visibility of their
materialization. Overt hazards were totally visible in the process of materialization
in front of the camera car (e.g., a car was signaling to turn right on the next
intersection). Covert hazards were partially or totally blocked during the process of
materialization, and these hazards became visible at the very moment when a
maneuver was needed to avoid a collision (e.g., a pedestrian was walking into the
road from the other side, but he was blocked by a bus moving in the opposite
direction with the camera car).
Ten video clips contained overt hazards, and ten video clips contained covert
hazards. The ten hazards in the clips were triggered by cars (ﬁve clips), pedestrians
(three clips) or riders (two clips). The clip length of videos that contained overt and
covert hazards wasn’t signiﬁcant, t = 1.12, p > 0.05. The road types were
counter-balanced under each hazard type to minimize the effect of local familiarity.
The onset time and the location of hazards were also different from one clip to
another. All the hazards contained a hazard window, which began at the earliest
point where a hazard was detectable and ended at the point where drivers’ avoid-
ance response would no longer prevent a collision [5, 8].
2.3
Design
A 3  2 mixed design was employed. The between-groups factor was driving
experience (6-month drivers, 12-month drivers vs. 18-month drivers). The
within-groups factor was hazard type (overt hazard vs. covert hazard).
The dependent variables were response latency (RL), time to ﬁrst ﬁxation (TFF),
reaction time (RT) and mean ﬁxation duration (MFD). RL was divided into TFF
and RT according to participants’ ﬁrst ﬁxation on the hazard [4, 6]. RL was cal-
culated as the time from the onset of the hazard to the moment when a maneuver
was needed to avoid a collision. TFF was calculated as the time from the onset of
the hazard to the moment when participants ﬁrst ﬁxated on the hazard. RT was
calculated as the time from when participants ﬁrst ﬁxated on the hazard to the
moment when they reacted to it. MFD was the mean amount of time in which
participants ﬁxated on the hazard.

Procedure
Participants ﬁrst ﬁnished a demographic questionnaire, and then, they were ﬁtted
with the Tobbi T120 eye tracker, which samples at 120 Hz. The viewing distance
was 65 cm from the screen. After calibrating their gaze points, participants took
three practice clips. They were instructed to click the left mouse button quickly
when they detected a potential hazard that forced them to slow down or change
their driving course. Finally, 20 video clips were randomly assigned to each par-
ticipant on a 17-inch monitor at a resolution of 1280  720. The experiment lasted
about 15 min.

Results
3.1
Response Latency
A 3  2 analysis of variance (ANOVA) compared the mean RL of the three driver
groups. The main effect of driving experience was signiﬁcant (F (2, 42) = 13.42,
p < 0.01, ŋ2 = 0.390). Post hoc revealed that 6-month drivers (M = 3.05,
SD = 0.22) responded to hazards slower than 12-month drivers (M = 2.79,
SD = 0.29) (p < 0.05) and 18-month drivers (M = 2.48, SD = 0.39) (p < 0.01).
The main effect of hazard type was signiﬁcant (F (1, 42) = 50.32, p < 0.01,
ŋ2 = 0.545); drivers responded to overt hazards (M = 2.56, SD = 0.47) faster than
covert hazards (M = 2.99, SD = 0.39). The interaction between the two factors
wasn’t signiﬁcant (F < 1, p > 0.05).
3.2
Time to First Fixation
A 3  2 analysis of variance (ANOVA) compared the mean TFF of the three driver
groups. The main effect of hazard type was signiﬁcant (F (1, 42) = 36.25, p < 0.01,
ŋ2 = 0.463); drivers detected overt hazards (M = 0.21, SD = 0.17) faster than
covert hazards (M = 0.40, SD = 0.25). No effect of driving experience and its
interaction with hazard type were found (Fs < 1, ps > 0.05).
3.3
Reaction Time
A 3  2 analysis of variance (ANOVA) compared the mean RT of the three driver
groups. The main effect of driving experience was signiﬁcant (F (2, 42) = 7.72,
p < 0.01, ŋ2 = 0.269). Post hoc revealed that 6-month drivers (M = 2.69,
14

SD = 0.26) and 12-month drivers (M = 2.52, SD = 0.32) reacted to hazards slower
than 18-month drivers (M = 2.20, SD = 0.44) (ps < 0.05). The main effect of
hazard type was signiﬁcant (F (1, 42) = 8.47, p < 0.01, ŋ2 = 0.168); drivers reacted
to overt hazards (M = 2.36, SD = 0.49) faster than covert hazards (M = 2.58,
SD = 0.46). The interaction between the two factors wasn’t signiﬁcant (F < 1,
p > 0.05).
3.4
Mean Fixation Duration
A 3  2 analysis of variance (ANOVA) compared the mean MFD of the three
driver groups. The main effect of hazard type was signiﬁcant (F (1, 42) = 24.64,
p < 0.01, ŋ2 = 0.370); drivers ﬁxated overt hazards (M = 0.44, SD = 0.24) longer
than covert hazards (M = 0.37, SD = 0.19). The main effect of driving experience
wasn’t signiﬁcant (F (2, 42) = 1.16, p > 0.05). The interaction between the two
factors was signiﬁcant (F (2, 42) = 3.43, p < 0.05, ŋ2 = 0.140). However, simple
effect test showed that the three groups’ MFD on covert hazards (F < 1, p > 0.05)
and overt hazards (F (2, 42) = 1.67, p > 0.05) weren’t signiﬁcant.

Discussion
The present study examined the effects of driving experience and hazard type on
young drivers’ hazard perception performance. First, the three driver groups were
only different in their total driving mileage. Thus, the relationship between young
drivers’ driving experience and their hazard perception performance could be better
understood when the other demographic factors are well controlled.
Second, we found driving experience did affect drivers’ response latency to
hazards. The more driving experience a driver had, the faster he or she reacted to
hazards. The experience-related differences in response latency were due to the
faster processing time after the initial ﬁxation. The three driver groups were not
signiﬁcantly different in the time to spot a potential hazard. One possible expla-
nation for this was that participants haven’t driven long enough to form ﬂexible
visual strategies. In addition, young drivers reacted to overt hazard faster than
covert hazards. This indicated that how fast a young driver could react to the
hazard, to some degree, depended on the salient nature of the hazard. Although
drivers’ HP processing mechanism on covert and overt hazards was similar, our
data suggested that overt hazards were more effective in distinguishing the three
driver groups than covert hazards. Overall, these ﬁndings provided some insight
into why young novice drivers had poorer ability to address particular hazards.
Finally, no effect of driving experience on mean ﬁxation duration was found in
this study. Although the mean ﬁxation duration of the three groups was similar, the
reaction time of the two groups of less experienced driver was slower than drivers

who had 18-month driving experience. This indicated that compared to more
experienced drivers, when the similar amount of attention was given to a speciﬁc
hazard, the two groups of less experienced drivers could not extract sufﬁcient
information from the stimuli, or at least, the efﬁciency of their information-to-action
translation was worse [3].
Nonetheless, we found overt hazards were ﬁxated more time than covert haz-
ards. Due to the nature of covert hazards, it could be more beneﬁcial for young
novice drivers if their visual strategies on covert hazards get well trained. However,
covert hazards used in the training should not be too difﬁcult to detect because the
task may require more attentional resources that young drivers may not have,
especially when the training was conducted on a driving simulator.

Abstract In order to meet the need of modern army and war, the new recruits
should pass systematic psychological selection and mental disorder assessment.
Combined application of response time and relative mental tests could solve the
problem of false psychological test results, validate the authenticity of the results,
and strengthen the reliability and validity. This could be applied as efﬁcient tests for
new recruits of high stress condition during military training, and mostly abandon
recruitments of mental disorders.

Introduction
Mental health work in the military has been considered to be of great importance [1,
2]. In order to maintain the stability of the military, the staff working on military
psychology must effectively conduct mental health work [3, 4]. For mental health of
military personnel plays an important role in maintenance of military strength,
prevention of mental disorders must be adopted by their early detection and
treatment [5]. So development and promotion of efﬁcient psychological evaluation
is an important part of military mental work [6, 7].
This study aimed to explore the effect of words count of each question, per-
sonality factors, sexuality and majors on responding time of participants. Through
these methods, we hoped to identify false results of personality tests.

Participants and Methods
2.1
Participants
All 778 recruits were enrolled from some military colleges between September,
2004 and March, 2009. The participants provided permission to publish these
features of their cases. And all subjects agreed to participate in the study.
2.2
DXC-6 Wireless Multiterm Group Psychological Testing
Station (WMGPTS)
All participants were evaluated with the DXC-6 Wireless Multiterm Group
Psychological Testing Station (WMGPTS) that was developed by the Fourth
Military Medical University. This machine could evaluate basic ability and per-
sonality by series of scales. The instrument has been used in psychological eval-
uation of astronauts, pilots and new recruits, etc.
2.3
Cattell 16 Personality Factors Test
Cattell 16 Personality Factor Test (16PF) [8, 9] was carried out among military
college students. WMGPTS automatically recorded four parameters for each
question answered by the subject: the time to press key, the time to release key (the
completion time), modiﬁcations of answers and the ﬁnal answer, to analyze the
relationship between the answer time and test results.
2.4
Statistical Analysis
Data were presented as mean ± standard deviation, and the responding time of
participants among different sexual groups and majors was compared by Student’s
t test. And Pearson correlation and multiple liner regression were applied to analyze
the relationship between average response time and personality factors. All analyses
were performed with SPSS 21 (IBM Corp., US). Statistical probability (P) was
determined based on hypothesis testing, with the level of statistical signiﬁcance set
at P < 0.05.

Participants’ Characteristics
In all 778 participants, 404 were men and 374 were female; 322 majored in
humanities and 456 in natural science; their ages ranged from l7 to 25 with an
average of (18.91 ± 1.08). To explore the sensitivity of time variables to indi-
viduals who pretend to be healthy or ill, the answer time of participants in the 16PF
test was analyzed.
3.2
Results of Cattell 16 Personality Factors Test
Signiﬁcant differences existed in the answer time of college students among the 16
factors (P < 0.01), of which factor B took the longest time, and factor G the
shortest.
There was a signiﬁcant positive correlation (r = 0.522, P < 0.01) between the
average answer time for each question (n = 778) and the number of words
(Table 1);
the
regression
equation
was:
Y = 0.325 + 0.193 X1 + 6.209 X2
(Table 2). Y is the average response time of each question (in seconds), X1 the
word count of the question, and X2 the proportion of factor B.
The total answer time of male students was 1464.51 ± 251.51 s and that of
female students was 1396.43 ± 240.78 s. The independent sample test result of
3.86 (P < 0.01) suggested that there was a signiﬁcant difference (Fig. 1). The total

was
1512.11 ± 250.11 s and 1375.05 ± 231.53 s, respectively, which showed that
natural science students answered signiﬁcantly faster than humanities students
(P < 0.01) (Fig. 2). The answer time reﬂected the performance of subjects to some
extent, which would contribute to checking the authenticity of the test results.

Discussions
It was showed that mental illnesses primarily damages “sustained attention,” then
verbal and working memory, and seldom inﬂuences other abilities [10, 11]. The
subject who performed poorly in all three of the abilities above would be in the
high-risk group. In terms of personality and mental health tests, results vary greatly
as the motivation of subjects is different, so we developed the WMGPTS that can
effectively identify pretend health or illness. Because of a different motivation,
voluntary soldiers would hide or exaggerate their suffering. Combining authorita-
tive psychology scales and recording of answer time for each question, this new
technology was developed to identify the seriousness of the subjects through time
analysis.

Research on Pilot’s Intention Reasoning
Method Based on D–S Evidence Theory
Zhili Tang, Shan Li and Yanglong Dou
Abstract In order to improve the efﬁciency and accuracy of pilot decision-making
in battleﬁeld environment, a pilot intention reasoning method based on Dempster–
Shafer evidence theory is proposed. Firstly, the D–S evidence theory is used to
associate the pilot’s action with the intention in the expert system database, and the
credibility of the evidence is fused through the Dempster synthesis rule. The cockpit
man–machine interface is dynamically changed according to the pilot intention.
And then an example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the
proposed method, which provides a theoretical basis for the optimization of man–
machine interface of ﬁghter cockpit.

Introduction
The operational intent of the pilot is that the pilot desires to achieve a certain state
or purpose through a series of operations that most directly reﬂect of the pilot’s
tactical purpose, but the operational intent is difﬁcult to measure directly or perceive
by the device. In this paper, it is assumed that when the pilot’s brain produces some
operational intent, it requires a series of operational actions on the ﬁghter, which are
detected or collected by the airborne sensor.
Therefore, the cockpit man–machine interface can quickly and accurately show
the pilot’s intention, thus improve the decision-making efﬁciency of the pilot, by
reversing the operator’s action to indirectly infer the pilot’s intention.
Intention reasoning includes strategic intention reasoning and tactical intention
reasoning. By contrast, the judgment and decision made by the pilot in the bat-
tleﬁeld environment are mostly speciﬁc, targeted and highly real-time, most of

Pilot Intention Reasoning Model
At some point, through the pilot operation by the collected sensor data as input
information, this information and expert system database associate, match, and
screen through a certain rule of the model reasoning out of one or several pilot
intentions that the expert system thinks that the most likely to occur. In this paper,
the reasoning model and the matching method are combined with the expert system
database and the intention of the pilot behavior prediction [5]. This combination
method is helpful to optimize the ﬁghter cockpit man–machine interface design to
achieve the purpose of reasoning the operational intention through the pilot
behavior.
3.1
Pilot Operation Intention Reasoning Model Structure
In order to facilitate the expert system to reason the pilot’s intention, we must
combine the operation of the pilot into a high-level combination of the sequence.
The association of the pilot operations can effectively reduce the number and
frequency of comparing with the expert knowledge database and improve the
reasoning speed [6, 7]. At the same time, it is possible to increase the effective
information of the operation sequence and make the connection between the
operation and action more closely, and the associated operation intention is clearer.
For the type of association, it can be deﬁned according to the speciﬁc need. This
paper only gives the deﬁnition of the operation event cleanup, repetitive action
event compression, and operational intent to logical association.
3.1.1
The Operation Action Event Cleanup: [a, p(a)  H] ! [nil]
a for a certain action, pðaÞ for a property value of the action a, H is a valid value.
Operation action event cleanup is the most widely used, and its role is to reduce the
number of operational events to reduce the number of matching. If the value pðaÞ of
the attribute, such as the reliability, urgency, etc., by described in the operation
action a is less than the system-deﬁned valid value H, then this action will not
produce an association effect or be temporarily stored in a log ﬁle. In the case of
high complexity of the battleﬁeld, you can also design a dynamic range
H depending on the pilot and situation.
3.1.2
Repetitive Action Event Compression: [a, a, …, a] ! [a]
The repetitive action event compression is a combination of operations that are
repeated in a short period of time with a high number of operations, and only
Research on Pilot’s Intention Reasoning Method …
25

consider the intention of generating the single operation. The compressed operation
is basically the same as the effect of a single operation. However, in a short time,
the operation information will be repeatedly written on the log ﬁle.
3.1.3
Operational Intent Logic/Match Association:
[a, b, …, and, or, not] ! [c]
a for the operation of action, and, or, not for the logical relationship, c for the result
of reasoning. Operational intent logic/matching association is a more complex way
of matching by using Boolean operations. Through a large number of original
simple operational action or sequences that are matched to the expert system
database to be associated with operational intent. Since the previous database is
represented by the frame structure, then the intention it should also have is the
corresponding structure. The intention frame structure of this paper is as follows
(Fig. 1).
For Fig. 1, it is worth noting that the reservation slot contains the relationship
value among the different intentional identiﬁcation frameworks, which indicates the
relationship among the different intentions; the serial slot is the intent number of the
intentions in the entire expert system database; operation–intention association slot
is the focus of this framework, it directly describes the degree of operation asso-
ciated with this intention, its side 1, side 2 that is the name of each different
operation, value 11 and value 21 correspond to the credibility of the operation; the
threshold slot is the degree of association between the operation and the intention,
and the value is the discriminant threshold, which is the ﬁxed value by given
directly by the expert system.

The pilot operation intention reasoning process is divided into ﬁve steps, as
shown in Fig. 2.
Assuming that the current sensor input pilot action has 11, respectively, for the
push throttle stick, sharp turn, roll, rollback, dive, quickly pull up, separate S
maneuver, into the helmet ﬂight mode, weapons online preparation, radio silence,
and infrared interference bomb preparation [8, 9]. The property slot of each action
of the framework has three attribute values which can determine the authenticity of
the action and repeat or not. After action cleaning and compression, eleven actions
are combined into seven actions, respectively, action 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11. And actions
4, 6, 8, 10 are merged or cleared temporarily. The seven effective actions are input
expert system to match to operate intended, ﬁnding that ﬁve operation intentions
intend to be associated with the above seven actions, respectively, ﬁve intentions to
match and compare. It can be seen that the operational actions 1, 2, 5 are associated
with intent 1. Operational actions 2, 3, 9 are associated with intent 2. Operational
actions 5, 7 are associated with intent 3. Operational actions 1, 9, 11 are associated
with intent 4. Operational actions 2, 5, 9 are associated with intention 5. Through
the conﬁdence value of the operation–intention, the corresponding slot is calculated
and then compared with the discrimination value of the discrimination threshold
slot; we can get the possibility of occurrence. Finally, the possible intention is
pooled into the intent concentration to carry out the collision detection. If the
conﬂict is found, the intention will be synthesized. Otherwise, the result of intention
reasoning will be stored in the expert system combined with the method of the
pilot’s online modiﬁcation [10]. Meanwhile, the cockpit man–machine interface
displays information corresponding to the current intention. The pilot reasoning
model is shown in Fig. 3.
The following gives a detailed reasoning process based on the expert system of
the pilot operating intention reasoning model in the ﬁghter cockpit:
1)
According to the distributed sensor to detect the operation of the pilot, enter the
Ei; i ¼ 1; 2; . . .; k operation action. Clean up, compress and integrate the pilot
operation, and construct the recognition frame H : H ¼ E1; E2; . . .; EK

2)
According to the operator’s current operation to compare the intention set of the
expert system database and intention In; n ¼ 1; 2; . . .; N which is able to match
as a focal element, to associate with the operation-intention, and construct the
same basic allocation function mkðAnÞ; k ¼ 1; 2; . . .; K; n ¼ 1; 2; . . .; N
as
structure of the database. The basic trust allocation function is determined by the
following formula: mkðAnÞ ¼ CFK  WK, where CFk is the trust value of
operation Ek and match intention An, and Wk is the corresponding weight.

operation corresponds to intention In and dynamically changes the man–ma-
chine interface. Otherwise, the current interface doesn’t change or asks the pilot
to make assistance changes.

Case Analysis
In this paper, it is assumed that the current sensor has received three effective
actions A, B, C. Action A means that the pilot increases throttle. Action B means
that the pilot frequently increases the turning angle for emergency maneuvers and
into the helmet ﬂight state. Action C means that the main channel of active phased
array radar has detected the enemy’s proximity information and tracks the target.
Through the above three actions compared to the intention of the expert system set,
it is associated with two different intentions I1; I2, I1 on behalf of my ﬁghter into a
positive defense of the maneuver ﬂight mode, I2 on behalf of being ready to ﬁght
back air and air missile ﬁlling information tips. The above three movements are in
line with the framework of the expert system structure which has three sides, three
actions, and two intentions. The credibility and weight are as follows.
For I1 there are: EA1ðCFA1ð0:2; 0:6; 0:2ÞÞ; WA1 ¼ 0:4
In the formula, EA1 represents the degree of correlation between the operational
action A and the intention I1; CFA1 is the reliability of the three sides of the oper-
ational action A, and WA1 represents the relevant weight of the operational action
A and intention I1 : mA1 ¼ ð0:08; 0:24; 0:08Þ; mA1 indicates that the operational

there are three values in mA1; mB1; mC1, mA2; mB2; mC2, which can be understood as
the three different sides to the three basic trust assignments of intention, for

the man–machine interface should display the information of the air-to-air missile
ﬁlling information. The helmet display is the received signal, immediately trans-
ferred to the launch state screen.
When the conﬂict is detected, the two intentions I1; I2 are likely to occur. At this
time, BelðI1Þ\BelðI2Þ, the display of the man–machine interface should be mainly
the intention I2, and the relevant screen of the intention I1 should be small screen
display or aid tips display. Similarly, when multiple intentions are likely to occur,
they should also follow the display mode where the most likely intention is the
main screen.

Conclusion
In this paper, the problem of pilot intention reasoning is described systematically.
The pilot reasoning is divided into three levels: intention, operation, and state level,
and then the method of intention reasoning based on pilot action is put forward. The
D–S evidence theory is chosen as the algorithm in the reasoning model. The
algorithm validates the rationality of the expert model recognition framework of
operation-intention matching, and provides the theoretical basis for the optimization
of the man–machine interface of the cockpit.

Pressure Effects of Compression Garment
on Muscle Fatigue in Upper Limb
in Men’s Basketball
Yuxiu Yan, Jiahong Wu, Lin Zhang, Zimin Jin and Jianwei Tao
Abstract The purpose of this study was to investigate compression garments’
pressure effects on muscle fatigue in upper limb in men’s basketball. Twenty male
college basketball players, wearing compression garment of different pressures,
completed dribbling, layups, and shooting with surface EMG signals measured
during exercise. After data processing by MATLAB 7.0, correlation analysis and
multiple comparisons were conducted. The properties of sEMG signal were sig-
niﬁcantly related to muscle fatigue in upper limb, especially in biceps and bra-
chioradialis. The result showed pressure effects of compression garment on muscle
fatigue in upper limb, which appeared mainly on the middle and later stages of
exercise. Moderate pressure was able to relieve muscle effectively and consecu-
tively, while high or low pressure could not help drop fatigue but accelerating tired
feeling. The research ﬁnding of this paper could be taken as a reference for the
development of compression garment of basketball players.

Introduction
Basketball is now very popular for its function of body-building and pleasure in
watching. After one hundred years of development, the intensity and antagonism of
game have been improved a lot. This may cause muscle fatigue and damage easily
in high-intensity exercise [1]. In basketball, actions, such as steals, stops, jump
shots, dunk, and blocked shots, are all mainly completed by upper limb. The muscle
of upper limb enables it to move by contraction and relaxation. Of all the ball games
by touching hands directly, basketball has the most strongly dependence on upper
limb [2].

The purpose of wearing clothes is to package body, protect body from injury,
meet the needs of physiology and security of human body, and adapt to the sur-
roundings [2, 3]. Sports compression garments can be comfortable to wear [4], and
help to decrease sports injuries [5], protect muscles, delay muscle fatigue. They are
now very popular in basketball games [6]. World sports brands (e.g., CYCFIT,
Adidas) have already developed compression garment for basketball for a time, and
now lining begins to dip into this area. However, both at homeland and abroad, the
mechanism research and experimental analysis of muscle fatigue during basketball
exercise are still inadequate. The aim of this paper was to investigate compression
effects of sports garment on muscle fatigue of upper limb and ﬁnd the proper
compression that could ease muscle fatigue, combined with the subjective
evaluation.

Methods
2.1
Participants and Garment Information
Twenty athletes were recruited from basketball teams of ﬁve universities in
Hangzhou for this study [mean (SD) age, 22 (3) years; height 1.75 m; upper arm
girth 32(33) cm]. All participants were healthy and recreationally trained for a week
before taking part. Before the experiment, all athletes were trained for standardized
actions required.
Upper body seamless compression garment was used in this study. The garments
were knitted by 85% nylon and 15% elastane. The illustration of garment is given in
Fig. 1.
Each participant was allocated three sizes of garments—170/88A, 175/92A, and
180/96A, which will compress upper limb tightly, moderately, and loosely. These
three sizes were numbered as 1, 2, and 3, and the speciﬁcations are given in
Table 1.

Experimental Procedures and Measurement
Upper limb muscles include shoulder, arm, forearm, and hand muscles. Shoulder
muscle mainly includes deltoid muscle. Bicipital muscle is the strongest among arm
muscles. Forearm muscle includes brachioradialis, palmaris longus muscle, which
control the contraction of joints of upper limb. Based on the research of muscle
fatigue [7] in basketball [8], take three test points represented as M1, M2, and M3,
respectively—the most raised points in the central section of deltoid muscle,
bicipital muscle, and brachioradialis, which were shown in Fig. 2. The speciﬁc
locations of three points were given in Table 2.
And based on the research of muscle fatigue test by Karthick and Ramakrishnan
[9], Bueno et al. [10], and Naeem [11], this experiment took three indicators to
evaluate muscle fatigue—two of time-domain analyses: RMS (root-mean square
amplitude) and iEMG (integrated electromyography), one of frequency-domain
analysis: MPF (mean power frequency). The evaluation criteria were given in
Table 3.

Experimental trials were conducted in an environmental chamber under the
controlled conditions of 24 (2) °C and 68 (5)% RH, wind speed under 1 m/s.
Participants were asked to wear compression garment and enter the laboratory to sit
quietly for 30 min until physical condition became stable. Three test points were
disinfected by medicinal alcohol with EMG sensors attached. Participants started to
make basketball actions for 120 s, including dribbling, shooting, layup. The total
time was equally divided into 8 time periods—each 15 s, represented by T1, T2,
T3, T4, T5, T6, T7, and T8. After changing into another garment, participants
would rest for an hour. The ﬁnal test result was the average value of 20 participants.
In each session of experiment, participants were asked to score the feeling of
muscle fatigue, and the criteria were as follows: not tired at all scored 1, slightly
tired scored 2, tired scored 3, very tired scored 4, and exhausted scored 5.

Results and Discussion
3.1
Correlation Between sEMG Signal and Muscle Fatigue
The values of RMS, iEMG, and MPF were calculated by MATLAB 7.0, according
to surface EMG signals via smooth denoising. Correlation analysis was conducted,
and the result in Table 4 indicated that in moderate pressure garment, sEMG signals
of all three muscles showed a signiﬁcant correlation with subjective feelings of
muscle fatigue, M2 and M3 at the 0.01 signiﬁcant level and M1 at the 0.05 sig-
niﬁcant level. In high-pressure garment, signals of M2 and M3 showed correlation,
but M1 did not. In low-pressure garment, RMS and iEMG of sEMG signals of all

three muscles showed signiﬁcant correlation and as for MPF, M2, and M3 showed
correlation at the 0.05 signiﬁcant level, while M1 did not.
The analysis results indicated that RMS, iEMG, and MPF of sEMG signals were
all able to reﬂect the extent of muscle fatigue, especially for bicipital muscle and
brachioradialis. In basketball exercise, bending arms mainly depend on bicipital
muscle, and actions, like shooting and passing, are completed mainly by contraction
of brachioradialis. Meanwhile, deltoid muscle only plays a secondary role.
3.2
Correlation Between Compression Garment Pressure
and Muscle Fatigue
Consistency test was conducted to measure the features of sEMG signals change in
M1, M2, and M3 during eight intervals—rs > 0.8 means strong positive correla-
tion. The result showed that sEMG signals of all three test points had strong
positive correlations, which meant that all three sEMG indicators had a high con-
cordance with each other. So considering sEMG indicators of all three points in
each interval as dependent variable, comparison test of one-way ANOVA was
conducted.
The result indicated, in Table 5, that in garment 1, mean value of RMS started to
show signiﬁcant difference from T6. In all three garments, the value of iEMG
started to show signiﬁcant difference from T4, and the value of MPF started to show
signiﬁcant difference from T6. All the results suggested that the pressure effects on
muscle fatigue were improved as garment pressure increased, which mainly
appeared in the middle and later stages of exercise, and the signiﬁcant level of the
effects decreased from garment 1 to 3.
For intervals with great pressure effects of compression garment, the increasing
and decreasing rates of sEMG indicators change were drawn in histograms, which
were shown in Fig. 3. In garment 1, the rate of RMS and iEMG increased steadily
as time went by, while MPF decreased. In garment 2, the increasing rate of RMS

and iEMG, as well as the decreasing rate of MPF, went down gradually as time
went on. In garment 3, the rate of RMS and iEMG increased with slight ﬂuctuations
as time went by, while MPF decreased.
In the middle and later stages of exercise, comparison of sEMG signal indicators
among all three garments showed that garment 2 brought increasing and decreasing
rates of indicators down, garment 1 raised rate of indicators, and garment 3 did not
perform well but in a trend of rising overall. Combining the results in Table 5, it
suggested that moderate pressure was able to relieve muscle effectively and con-
secutively, high pressure could not help drop fatigue but accelerating tired feeling,
and low pressure did not have the function of easing muscle fatigue.
The reason why pressure effects appeared was that compression could help
support body to make movement, but impose restrictions on body as well, which
decreased energy consumption of muscles [12]. Moderate pressure was able to
stimulate nerve cells and promote proprioceptive sensation, which helped improve
athletes’ attention and therefore made the body adjusted to the environment [13].

was over-high, blood ﬂow might get blocked and human body would raise oxygen
consumption to maintain sports intensity. And this could cause muscle fatigue

immediately. Over-high pressure would also restrict microcirculation of blood
capillary partly, which might lead to the anoxia of muscle, accumulation of
metabolic waste, such as lactic acid, and accelerate the process of muscle fatigue
[13]. Meanwhile, low pressure was not able to reduce the vibration of muscle due to
lack of compression with energy consumption. In order to output the same amount
of energy, muscle would increase discharge capacity and get tired quicker.

Conclusions
In basketball exercise, indicators of sEMG signals and muscle had signiﬁcant
correlation, which could help evaluate muscle fatigue. And, pressure effects were
more efﬁcient for bicipital muscle and brachioradialis than deltoid muscle, and
mainly appeared in the middle and later stages of exercise. Moderate pressure was
able to relieve muscle effectively and consecutively, while high or low pressure
could not help drop fatigue but accelerating tired feeling. The research ﬁnding of
this paper could be taken as a reference for the development of compression gar-
ment of basketball players.

Measurement of a Walker’s Movement
Parameters by a Monocular Camera
Yang Shang
Abstract This article elaborates on the theory of monocular measurement for a
walker and uses experiments to validate this approach. This new monocular
approach for measuring the movement parameters of a walker allows for the 3-D
pose and position of the walker to be obtained using at least two endpoints on the
target, the walker’s vertex and heel, and then other point’s position on the walker
can be calculated. If the walker’s stature is not known, there is a coefﬁcient of
proportionality between the measured result and the true result. When the walker’s
stature is known, the movement parameters of the walker can be measured in this
way by a monocular camera, which can be used to study a person’s movement or to
monitor person’s action in public places by monitor video.

Introduction
One of the tasks of human engineering is to measure the structure or movement of a
person. To measure an object’s structure or movement parameters is important work
in computer vision and photogrammetry. When the measurement system is made up
of many cameras, the three-dimensional stance and position can be obtained by
having the cameras intersect at no fewer than three characteristic points on the target’s
surface [1, 2]. The three-dimensional stance and position can be calculated when at
least three characteristic points in the body’s coordinate system are known.
Three-dimensional structure and movement can be rebuilt on the basis of single
camera sequence images when the target has more disoperative characteristic points

[3–5]. Many methods have been applied to measure the three-dimensional stance of
targets such as missiles, including the axis method, the ellipticity method, the length–
width ratio method, and the spiral method [6, 7].
This article elaborates on a method of monocular measurement for a walker,
which is a translation-only one-dimensional target. The approach can be used to
measure the 3-D pose and position parameters of the walker by using two end-
points. Then, any other point’s position on the target can be calculated. If there is no
known distance between any two endpoints, a coefﬁcient of proportionality will be
left for the results. The movement parameters of the walker can be measured in this
way when the distance between two points, the walker’s vertex and heel, is known,
and thus, the true result is obtained.

When the exact distance between A and B is known, the positions of A and B at
any point in time can be solved with precision (that is, the initial position and the
translation vector at every time).
However, if the distance between A and B is not known, a coefﬁcient of pro-
portionality will exist between the measured result and the true result. In practice, if
the distance between each target point and the camera is known, the true result can
also be calculated. The pose of one-dimensional target can be solved if the char-
acteristic points target coordinates are known [8]. When, we need not to know the
scale information.

Experimental Validation
The target to be measured is a person walking steadily in front of the camera about
100 m. The medial axes of the person are taken as the one-dimensional target. The
calvarias and the intersect point of the medial axes with the two touchdown points
connect line are chosen as the starting point and the end point. The camera remains
stationary on the ﬂoor and takes images, some of which are shown in Fig. 2. The
small circle points are the projection on the image plane of position’s result of the
end characteristic point of the walker. The big circle points are the current result.
All of the results at different time are ﬁgured in every image. The triangle is the
calculated result of pate and projects it to image plane. All the result’s projection
can accordant with the current target’s pose and position.
Let the person stays at every measured position. At the same time of taking
images, getting the 3-D coordinates depending on geosystems. On the reference
coordinate’s XZ, the true trajectory and calculated trajectory are shown in Fig. 3, in
which the real line represents the true trajectory and the broken line represents
calculated trajectory.

Conclusion
This article elaborates on the theory of monocular measurement for a walker, a
translation-only one-dimensional target, and uses practical experiments to validate
this approach. By this approach, a single camera is employed to take at least two
images and make use of at least two characteristic points on the target to measure
the walker’s movement parameters. Provided the distance or another measurement
between two characteristic points is known, the three-dimensional position and
stance can be calculated. Except the two characteristic points, other point’s position
on the target can also be calculated. If no measurement information is available,
there will be a coefﬁcient of proportionality between the measured result and the
true result.

Evaluation on Crew’s Information
Processing Capability Based on Grey
Relational Analysis
Binhe Fu, Weiping Liu, Yi Jin and Bo Yang
Abstract With the improvement of informative level of special vehicles, the pri-
mary operation type of special vehicle crews has been turned into knowledge-based
operations, which sets a high demand on crew’s information processing capability.
Based on grey relational theory, an evaluation model of crew’s information pro-
cessing capability was established and an evaluation method of crew’s information
processing capability was presented. First, evaluation indicators of crew’s infor-
mation processing capability were presented. Then, the crew’s information pro-
cessing capability was evaluated and ranked with the calculation of the degree of
grey correction. The evaluation result of one example is in good agreement with
that of expert discussion, which proves the feasibility and validity of this method
and provides guidance and reference for crew’s selection and training.

Introduction
Crews acquire information by the sense of sights, and then, brain makes a judgment
promptly during the process of information processing operations. If a crew cannot
distinguish information in time, or reacts falsely, the situation would turn out to be
disadvantageous rapidly. The higher the speed of analysing information and making
judgments is, the higher the odds of accomplishing tasks successfully would be.
Special vehicle crews are required to perform tasks both accurately and quickly,
which sets a high demand on crew’s information processing capability.
The current study on special vehicle crew’s information processing capability
remains in its early stage and lacks effective evaluation methods at present.

Therefore, based on grey relational theory (GRT), an evaluation model of crew’s
information processing capability was established and an evaluation method of that
was presented in this paper to evaluate and compare information processing
capability of different crews.

Features of Information Processing Operations and Its
Evaluation Indicators
2.1
Analysis of Operation Features
Special vehicle crews have to complete a series of operations about information
processing when performing tasks: situation observing and information inputting,
instruction receiving and equipment manipulating. By analysing the process of
information processing operations of special vehicle crews, the feathers of it are
concluded as follows.
(1) Signiﬁcant increment of knowledge-based operations
Information processing operations of special vehicle crews are involved with
varieties of tasks, such as message preparation, map recognition, equipment
manipulation, which are of informative content and complicated manipulation.
Concrete manipulation coming from random combination of different functions
would be even more complicated. Compared with the physical labour, infor-
mation processing operations are embodied in basic manipulation, such as
selecting, inputting and identifying, and knowledge-based operations are taken
the principal position.
(2) Strong randomness of tasks
Rapid reaction after receiving information is very important for task perfor-
mance because every single second is precious for crews. The large amount of
real-time interaction and the high speed of information update lead to the strong
randomness of information processing tasks, which demands crews recognize
and react promptly to carry out relevant functions immediately. Information
processing operations set a high demand on crew’s speed of reaction and
manipulation.
(3) Large amount of information monitoring
Task situation varies from minute to minute, so special vehicle crews need to
concentrate on operations in hand to guarantee the speed and accuracy of task
performance. Crews have to deal with multitask, which means that while
processing information, crews are supposed to observe the change of real-time
information update at the same time. The amount of information crews have to
monitor is so large that they should allocate attention to multiple tasks properly
during task performing to make sure all aspects of information accepted.

2.2
Presenting Evaluation Indicators
Information processing capability is a comprehensive reﬂection of several types of
basic capability without effective evaluation method. It cannot be measured or
evaluated with one single index quantitatively, so it needs several indicators to
evaluate comprehensively. Evaluation indicators selected should be able to evaluate
information processing capability comprehensively and accurately, and help anal-
yse the reason for the performance difference of crews [1].
Based on human information processing model and the feathers of information
processing operations of special vehicle crews, the evaluation index system of
information processing capability can be concluded as ﬁve aspects of basic capa-
bility,

Evaluation Model of Information Processing Capability
Based on Grey Relational Analysis
Grey system theory (GST) is a new method of study on uncertainty in less data and
incomplete information with the uncertain system as the object of study in which
part of the information is unknown. By studying the known part of the information,
valuable information is obtained to describe and monitor the operating process and
the changing rule of the whole system accurately and effectively [2].
The basic method of grey relational analysis (GRA) is to convert the observed
value of discrete behaviours of system objectives into piecewise continuous func-
tion by linear interpolation to build models of the relational grade of measure based
on the geometrical characteristics of functions. The closer the geometrical shape of
functions appears, the higher the relational grade between sequences would be [3].
Grey relational analysis (GRA) method was employed to establish an evaluation
model of information processing capability of special vehicle crews in this paper.
The basic procedure includes selecting and preprocessing indicators, building
analysis matrix, calculating grey relational coefﬁcient and grey relational grade,
analysing the evaluation result.

Preprocessing Indicators

should be preprocessed with dimensionless method to construct membership
functions for each indicator. Indicators are divided into two types, “the smaller, the
better” and “the larger, the better”. Dimensionless method of two types of indicators
is given as follows [4].

where xi refers to actual value of indicators, M and m refer to maximum and

After preprocessing, performance data is turned to membership ranging from 0
to 1 according to membership functions. All the indicators are turned into “the
larger, the better” type.

Analysing the Evaluation Result
In common analysis of grey relational grade, either the optimal or the worst
sequence is employed to calculate the relational grade. However, sorted results of
the relational grade from two methods may not reach a consensus, which could
cause errors of evaluation result. Therefore, combined the optimal with the worst
relational grade comprehensively, the error problem can be solved by calculating
comprehensive relational grade [5].
Comprehensive relational grade can be calculated as follows.
ui ¼

1 þ c0imax=c0imin
ð
Þ2
ð13Þ
where c0imax, called the optimal relational grade, is the relational grade between Xi
and the optimal sequence, while c0imin, called the worst relational grade, is the
relational grade between Xi and the worst sequence. The ﬁnal evaluation result is
u ¼ u1; u2; . . .; un
ð
Þ.
At last, the rank of comprehensive relational grade can be obtained. The larger
the comprehensive relational grade ui is, the better information processing capa-
bility the corresponding crew would have.

Example Analysis
Ten participants were selected to complete ﬁve aspects of experiments including
DR capability, CR capability, STM capability, SPM capability and WM capability.
The performance result of crew’s information processing operations as Table 1 was
analysed to evaluate crew’s information processing capability.
The performance data was preprocessed with the dimensionless method. The DR
time, CR time and WM error rate were “the smaller, the better” type of indicators,
while the STM range and SPM range, “the larger, the better” type. The membership
result of each basic capability performance after preprocessing is shown in Table 2.
The larger the membership is, the better the corresponding basic capability appears.

So, if the optimal or worst relational grade is employed to compare crew’s

which will bring problems to the evaluation. The comprehensive relational grade
combined with the optimal and worst relational grade could help solve this prob-
lem. It is concluded that the rank of information processing capability of the ten
crews is 2 > 1 > 3 > 7 > 4 > 9 > 8 > 5 > 6 > 10, which is consistent with panel’s
perspective.

Computer-Aided Visual Function
Assessment Using Subjective Image
Quality Evaluation Metrics
Haoting Liu, Beibei Yan, Ming Lv, Junlong Wang, Xuefeng Wang
and Wei Wang
Abstract A new computer-aided visual function assessment method is proposed.
In contrast to the traditional methods, our method can realize an elaborated sub-
jective state analysis of visual function. The subjective image quality evaluation
metrics (IQEMs) are utilized to implement the visual function assessment, and they
include the image brightness, the image brightness uniformity, the colour image
contrast, the image edge blur, the image colour difference, the image noise, the
image saturation, and the integrated evaluation. An ergonomic experimental soft-
ware is developed, and the typical experimental datasets are also built. After the
implementation of the visual function assessment experiment, some statistic fea-
tures of IQEMs can be calculated. By developing the proposed visual function
evaluation technique, it can be used for the disease diagnosis and healing.

Introduction
The visual function [1] can not only reﬂect the healthy state of ocular system but
also indicate the development states of other diseases in human body [2], such as
the brain disease, the nerves disorder, the diabetes, or even the tumour growing.
Currently, the diagnosis of visual function uses the standard visual chart, the colour
blindness chart, and other visual ﬁeld measurement device to evaluate the visual
function state of patient. The patient is asked to observe the typical images or
graphs and speak out his or her subjective cognition states of them when using these
methods above. Traditionally, the diagnoses of each vision function index are

independent to each other. The integrated analyses of them are only performed by
the individual experiences of doctor. These methods above have been utilized
extensively in past, because the applications of them are convenient, cheap, and
ﬂexible.
Many related works have been done in the visual function assessment research
ﬁelds in recent years. In [3], the authors presented a system which used the camera,
the image processing module, and the neural electrical stimulator to assist patient to
realize the visual function loss restoration. In [4], a method for generating obser-
vation target of contrast sensitivity and colour difference inspection was proposed.
In [5], an autostereoscopic display was developed to recover the binocular vision
performance of strabismus or amblyopia patients. After an extensive comparison of
these evaluation methods, it can be found these methods still have some short-
comings: ﬁrst, the investigated data are limited which means they cannot reﬂect the
integrated performance of ocular character of human eyes. Second, the data pro-
cessing and analysis of them are also oversimple.
In this paper, a new computer-aided visual function assessment method is pro-
posed. In contrast to the traditional methods, we use the colour image, which has
the abundant detail information as the evaluation target [6], and employ the image
quality evaluation metrics (IQEMs) to denote the visual function characters of
human eyes [7]. The IQEMs include the image brightness, the image brightness
uniformity, the colour image contrast, the image edge blur, the image colour dif-
ference, the image noise, the image saturation, and the integrated evaluation. To
verify the correctness and the effectiveness of proposed method, the typical image
datasets are built, a series of human-involved experiments are carried out, and the
corresponding data features are computed. The primary experiment results have
shown the proposed method can represent the visual function of subjects; and the
evaluation method also behaves better than some traditional ones.

Proposed Visual Function Assessment System
and Method
The proposed visual function assessment system and method is shown in Fig. 1.
Figure 1a shows the proposed assessment system, and Fig. 1b shows the experi-
ment ﬂow chart of proposed method. From Fig. 1a, it can be seen the visual
function evaluation system includes the typical image dataset, the image display
and subjective score software, the PC, and the projector. The image display and
subjective score software are installed in the PC, and it also can play the typical
image dataset in screen. The projector plays the image in a wall, and then the
subject can watch the corresponding images. From Fig. 1b, the experiment ﬂow
chart can be described as follows: ﬁrst, the experiment designer selects the typical
image dataset according to the corresponding experiment purposes. Second, after a
primary training of subjects, the experiment designer announces the start of the
58

experiment and runs the software. Third, the software plays each image in series
and keeps it still for 3 s on the wall. Fourth, the subject gives the subjective score to
these images according to some typical evaluation metrics, such as image illumi-
nance or image contrast. Finally, if all the images are displayed, the experiment will
be over.

Visual Function Evaluation Indexes
Eight subjective IQEMs are utilized to evaluate the visual function in this paper,
and their deﬁnitions and descriptions are shown in Table 1. From Table 1, it can be
seen these indexes can reﬂect the visual function of human completely comparing
with the traditional measurements; they cover lots of visual function information
including the image colour, the image detail, and the image difference. A kind of
10-degree score method is employed to classify the visual function. Here, the score
“1” means the weakest evaluation result, while the score “10” means the strongest
assessment result. For example, regarding the image brightness index, the score “1”
means the image brightness is low, while the score “10” indicates the image
brightness is high; regarding the image colour difference index, the score “1” means
the colour distortion is low, while the score “10” manifests the colour distortion is
high; and regarding the integrated evaluation result, the score “1” means the worst
evaluation result, while the score “10” is the best evaluation result of the integrated
imaging quality.

After the implementation of the visual function evaluation experiment, some
statistic features can be computed. In this paper, the following statistic features are
utilized: the arithmetic mean, the median, the mode, the variance, the range, and the
variation coefﬁcient. The statistic feature can reﬂect the change laws of visual
character if the experiment times are large enough. Among these features, the
arithmetic mean, the median, and the mode can reﬂect the concentration of
observed data, while the variance, the range, and the variation coefﬁcient can
represent the discreteness of data. In future, other data feature analysis techniques
can be used, such as the k-means method, the balanced iterative reducing and
clustering using hierarchies method, or the density-based spatial clustering of
applications with noise method.

Experiment Data and Subjects
Lots of typical image datasets are built for the visual function assessment experi-
ment in this paper. Figure 2 shows the related image samples. From Fig. 2, it can be
seen the typical image datasets include the images captured from nature scene and
the images captured under different indoor lighting conditions. The ﬁrst dataset can
be downloaded from the website: http://www.vcl.fer.hr/quality/vclfer.html. And the
second dataset is made by us. This dataset is captured in a darkroom of the visual
function laboratory in the Astronaut Research & Training Center of China.
Eight subjects (male, ages from 25 to 35; heights from 165 to 175 cm; weights
from 60 to 75 kg) participate in the visual function evaluation experiment. This
experiment is implemented in the darkroom of the department of ophthalmology of
the General Hospital of the Chinese People’s Armed Police Forces. After a primary

ocular examination, none of the subjects have any ophthalmopathies; their uncor-
rected eyesight are better than 0.8. Before the subjects participated in this evaluation
experiments, the entire experiment procedures should be declared to them clearly.
After the authorization by the Ethics Committee of the General Hospital of the
Chinese People’s Armed Police Forces, this experiment can be carried out.
4.2
Experiment Software
A visual function evaluation software is developed in this paper. It is written by C++
and MATLAB. The basic software interfaces are shown in Fig. 3: Fig. 3a is its
function region partition and Fig. 3b shows its application case. Regarding the visual
function evaluation task, this software has ﬁve functions: ﬁrst, it can select the image
dataset and display them in its image display region. Second, it can select the
subjective image quality evaluation index; the indexes are shown in Table 1. Third,
it can set the evaluation response time of subject. The response time is the maximum
evaluation time of each image. Fourth, it can score the subjective evaluation result.
The maximum evaluation degree is 10. The user can also use it with a small eval-
uation degree, such as 5 or 3. Fifth, it can record the assessment details and results in
a text ﬁle. The storage path can be set by the user. If the user misses to assess some
images during experiment, this software can reset a new experiment for these missed
images.

Experiment Results
Figure 4 shows the image quality evaluation result samples of the experimental
dataset in Fig. 2. In this experiment, the 10-degree evaluation method is utilized.
Figure 4a shows the evaluation result sample of the ﬁrst image in Fig. 2a, while
Fig. 2b shows the assessment result sample of the ﬁrst image in Fig. 2b; the hor-
izontal coordinate in Fig. 4 is the subject’s ID and the vertical coordinate is the
subjective evaluation results of different IQEMs. From Fig. 4, it can be seen that the
evaluation results of different subjects approximately have the distribution consis-
tency; in addition, these results can cover the subjective cognition of subject after
using a subjective questionnaire; as a result, the subjective visual function can be
described quantitatively by this experiment.
Table 2 gives out some statistic computation results of the subjective image
quality evaluation in Fig. 4a. Eight subjects are asked to perform the evaluation
experiment for 12 times in different days; thus for each image, we can get 12  8
evaluation results. In Fig. 2, the degraded images are created by the digital image
processing techniques or by the environment lighting setting of camera. That means

the experiment designers have the primary knowledge about these results. For
example, if the original high-quality image is processed by the image deﬁnition
degeneration technique, the experiment designer will know the subject will give a
low score when they assess the image edge blur index. From Table 2, we can ﬁnd
the corresponding calculated results have the distribution consistency with the
experiment designer’s prior knowledge; thus, it indicates these results should be
correct.
4.4
Discussions
The visual function assessment has extensive application needs for both the sci-
entiﬁc research purpose and the clinic diagnosis purpose. As we have stated above,
the visual function can not only reﬂect the ocular state of subject but also indicate
other disease-caused lesion of human eyes. Thus, it can be a kind of direct or
indirect medical processing measurement for many diseases. In future, the visual
function assessment can be both a kind of disease diagnoses measurement and a
rehabilitation evaluation method for the typical disease if the corresponding
experiences are accumulated elaborately.
Comparing with the traditional visual function assessment technique, the
advantages of proposed method are apparent. First, the proposed method can reﬂect
the integrated healthy state of patient. Second, the automation capture and pro-
cessing ability of the proposed method are good. That means the accumulated data
can be stored and analysed by a computer system effectively. Third, many data
processing methods can be used to analyse the features of these high-dimensional
data. The correlativity analysis or the association analysis can be performed by
using these data in future.
The proposed method also has some shortcomings. For example, comparing
with the standard visual chart-based method, the proposed method does not have
any medical standard currently which can limit its implementation in practice.
Another shortcoming is the experiment processing costs too much time comparing
with the traditional method. The patients still do not admit this method as the
diagnosis measurement in some cases. In future, with the accumulation of the
experiment data and data distribution laws, the proposed technique can become
enforceable deﬁnitely.

Conclusion
A computer-aided visual function assessment system and method is proposed. The
typical image datasets are used as the observation target; some IQEMs are
employed to assess the visual function of subject. After the application of proposed
system and method, the visual function change laws of typical image dataset can be

accumulated by the IQEMs and their statistic features. In future, the proposed
method can be regarded as a kind of supplemental measurement of the traditional
visual function assessment method to realize the precise analysis of human visual
function or other corresponding diseases.

of Handsaw Handle
Xiaohu Xu, Siyong Guo, Ran Yan, Haifeng Zhang and Ping Zhang
Abstract Using the basic theory of human factors engineering, the author dis-
cusses whether various handles affect the human arm and shoulder muscles or not,
while observing the work efﬁciency and accuracy by designing controlled experi-
ment. According to Man-machine analysis of the hand tools, the paper studies on
handle tool usage method, and creates a kinds of Z-shaped handle handsaw. The
control experiments of new handle were conducted by sEMG measurement, and the
author tries to understand and evaluate the effect on efﬁciency and accuracy. This
study ﬁnds that fatigue degree is different between I-shaped and Z-shaped to arms
and shoulders. Z-shaped handle handsaw is slightly better than I-shaped handsaw
on the working efﬁciency, but Z-shaped has obvious advantages in accuracy which
has an important enlightening effect on designing the tool handle.

Introduction
Recently, although automation technology develops rapidly [1], human manual
operation has not been completely replaced by automation. For example, handsaws
are characterized by simple and easy application and low price. So there is still vast
development space about the traditional handsaw. The application or design of hand
tools without considering the human body conditions or human operation state may
cause inappropriate exertion or poor working posture and lead to low efﬁciency,
even an accident or the occurrence of musculoskeletal injuries [2].

The present paper we studied is mainly concentrated on the effect of handle
modeling on hand muscles, hand load, etc. Without involving arms and shoulders.
The effect of the shape on efﬁciency and accuracy was not studied. According to the
ergonomic design and evaluation of handsaw (Pao-Hung Cheng from National
Yunlin University of Science & Technology), in order to improve the load and
action of hands while using traditional handsaws, the author applies ergonomics,
considering aesthetic and convenience, and discusses the important factors of
handsaws such as size, material, angle, handle shape, point of application. Through
analyzing the structure and biomechanics of the palm, the handle is designed to
meet the human palm size and surface, and the thrust experiment of various new
handle as well as sEMG measurement was conducted to put forward the design
principle of hand tools. The ergonomics research on hand tools mainly focused on
hand position, but did not involve the impact on the forearm and shoulder.
This paper is aimed at creating a Z-shaped handle by studying anthropometry
and biomechanics of hands and arms. By sEMG measurement on the I-shaped and
Z-shaped handles, the author discusses whether various handles affect the human
arm and shoulder muscles or not, while observing the work efﬁciency and accuracy.
In order to improve the operation posture of the handsaw, decrease the load of the
arm and shoulder. Finally, based on the study, the designer may develop some
kinds of handsaw with higher efﬁciency and accuracy.

Form Design of Handsaw Handle Based on Ergonomics
2.1
Analysis of the Hand Tools on Ergonomics
The tool must meet the following basic requirements to ensure efﬁciency and
health: achieving the function of hand tools, in addition to improving work efﬁ-
ciency; the size of the hand tool must take into account the size and structure of the
hand [3]; it should be natural, comfortable, and keep your wrist straight when using
tools [4]; reducing muscle static load; avoiding repeated bending of the ﬁngers and
excessive fatigue.
In terms of anatomy, the wrist has more than ten muscles and this part of the
muscle can provide many operating states by changing postures [5]. Human arm

muscles affected in the operation of hand tools include deltoid, triceps, brachialis,
biceps, brachioradial muscle, brachial carpal muscle ﬂexor [6]. This part of muscle
fatigue degree will affect the work efﬁciency and accuracy (Fig. 1).
2.2
Analysis of Application of Handsaws
When operating the handsaws, the operator may meet such problems: break blades
or askew saw kerf. There are several reasons for the saws broken.
1. The workpiece clamping position is unreasonable or the clip is too loose. As a
result, there is not enough support at the sawing spot.
2. Sawing too fast or heavily.
3. After the sawing slanting, the force is adjusted to make the blade side and
workpiece change to produce pressure.
4. When the saw blade is locked in the workpiece, the operators do not lift it while
continuing to pull.
5. When the blade is nearly broken, the operator did not try to relieve pressure,
which leads to the impact on the workbench.
The reasons of the saw kerf skewing are as follows:
1. The operator saw the workpiece in a skew way at the beginning.
2. The blade is not clipped tightly, swaying around, or the nuts are loosening.
3. When using the handsaw, the operator’s posture is incorrect and the work piece
is not aligned with the workpiece.
4. The frequency of the handsaw operation is so fast that the saw kerf is narrow
and skewed.
5. The operator’s sawing amplitude is too large.
2.3
Designing of the Handsaw Handle
1. The side of the handsaw handle is like Z-shaped. The angle between the handle
and the saw blade plane is 10°. When a right-handed user saws a piece of wood
up and down with a handsaw, his arm moves to the outside of the body
involuntarily and the handsaw tilts to the right which could lead to a skew kerf.
If forced to correct at this time, it may cause dorsal ﬂexure, hand fatigue, and an
uneven kerf. Therefore, designing a Z-shaped handle by clockwise tilting the
existing I-shaped handle 10°to compensate for the deviation of the saws from
the outside of the arm (Figs. 2, 3, and 4).

2. There is a bulge in the lower side of handle to give the thenar muscles upward
support force. The upper part is sag, and the thumb can hold the handle natu-
rally. Between the palm and the handle, there is a little gap, so that the pressure
of the ﬁrst webspace (the space between the thumb and the index ﬁnger) is right.
3. The cross section of handle is designed into curve which can be effortless and
comfortable. The bending angle of ﬁnger joints is moderate about 45°. That
means it is easy to grasp and reduce the extrusion.
4. Composite: The handle is made by engineering plastics covered with rubber
pad. The rubber pad could relieve the pressure at the position of hypothenar
muscles and ﬁnger dorsal interosseous muscles (Fig. 5).

Experimental Evaluation of Handsaw
In order to examine whether the handsaw shape has an effect on the degree of
muscle fatigue in the arm and shoulder. The paper conducts sEMG experiments and
contrast experiments on the I-shaped handle and the Z-shaped handle. Exploring the
impact of fatigue on the arm and shoulder, which differ from the I-shaped handle to
Z-shaped handle, and observing the operation process and results to compare the
working efﬁciency and accuracy between the two handsaws.
Experiment 1: Handsaw measurement by sEMG
1. Facilities: stopwatch; 60 mm * 8 mm batten; I-shaped handsaw; Z-shaped
handsaw
2. Process: A subject uses one I-shaped and Z-shaped handsaws to saw a piece of
batten within 120 s, respectively, and the experimenters collect the sEMG data
of post-deltoid, triceps, biceps, and brachioradial of the right arms (Figs. 6 and
7).
3. Data analysis
Studies show that the sEMG signal frequency characteristic can be changed with
the change of the muscle functional status in the process of muscles work. The
Fig. 5 Physical models

frequency characteristics of the sEMG signal are the mean power frequency
(MPF) and the center frequency (FC). The fatigue value of the muscle is obtained
from frequency domain analysis of the EMG data. Using the time domain diagram
mean frequency of muscles to make a comparative analysis of the operation of the
different handsaws. During the study of muscle continuous working to fatigue, the
spectrum of the electromotor signals shifts to the left as the degree of fatigue
deepens, which means the mean power frequency reduces. The conclusion can be
reﬂected from the curve which the smaller the intercept of the curve is relatively
labor-saving action and the smaller the slope means uneasy fatigue. The ﬁg. 7
shows the time domain diagram mean frequency of the post deltoid. The ﬁgure
shows the I-shaped handle is recorded as a green curve and the Z-shaped handle is
recorded as a black curve. The former intercept is slightly smaller than the latter,
and the absolute slope is slightly smaller than the latter either. It means that the
post-deltoid feels more labor-saving and tireless when operator is using the
Z-shaped handle handsaw. Table 1 is the intercept and slope of the curve which
represent the subjects’ four groups of muscles, and the results show the fatigue
degree of the other three muscles.
Analyzing the mean power frequency (MPF) chart of the muscle with different
handsaw. The conclusion is shown in Tables 2 and 3.

4. Conclusions: According to the sEMG table, the effect of different handsaws on
muscle fatigue is not signiﬁcant. And there is not signiﬁcant correlation between
the type of handsaws and the fatigue of the muscles. The reason may be the
limits of uncontrollable factors. Such as the limitations of number of subjects
and sawblade inconsistency.
Experiment 2: Testing of sawing efﬁciency of handsaws
1. Facilities: Stopwatch; 120 mm * 30 mm batten; I-shaped handsaw; Z-shaped
handsaw
2. Process: A subject uses I-shaped or Z-shaped handsaw to saw two same pieces
of batten within 120 s, respectively, and we record the number of sawed batten
pieces. After having ﬁnished, the subjects have a 20-min rest. The experimental
data of 10 groups are recorded, respectively.
3. Records (Table 4):
4. Discussions:
The I-shaped average number of batten: I = 6.65 pieces
The Z-shaped average number of batten: Z = 7.05 pieces
The Z-shaped working efﬁciency is slightly higher than the I-shaped.

Conclusions
Through making comparison between the I-shaped handle and the Z-shaped handle
in the aspects of work effectiveness, cutting accuracy, and the fatigue degree with
the sEMG experiment, the paper comes to the following conclusions: During the
process of handsaw operation, different handle shapes have an impact on the fatigue
degree of brachioradial, and the handle with Z-shaped side can alleviate the fatigue
of this part muscle; the Z-shaped handle’s cutting efﬁciency is more efﬁcient than
the I-shaped handle’s cutting efﬁciency; in most cases, the saw kerf has a tendency
shifting to the right during the process of using handsaw with right hand, and the
sawing accuracy of the Z-shaped handsaw is more than twice that of the I-shaped
handsaw in the case of vertically sawing wood, so the tilt angle of the Z-shaped saw
kerf can be designed slightly bigger, which contributes to the accuracy. In repeated
mechanical movement conditions, Z-shaped handle applications can be extended to
many other tools. A small inclination can bring great progress.

Abstract Mental ability will decline by ageing while the experience accumulating.
It is important to study the mental attributes of aged test pilots in order to maximum
professional span and ensure ﬂight safety. Methods A total of 35 experts including
test pilots and aircraft design engineers were interviewed on the issues of the mental
ability of aged test pilots through completing a questionnaire about the issue.
A battery of mental ability test and 16PF were used to examine 37 test pilots who
were divided into three age groups (age above 45 year, n = 16) and control group
(age below 45 year, n = 21). Results Most important mental attributes of older test
pilots were related to professional spirits, ﬂying expertise (judgment) and person-
ality. The ﬁrstly aging abilities were cognition and psychomotor ones. Scores of
Detecting special graph, Distinguishing direction and Distracted listening were
lower than those of control group (P < 0.05), which were negatively correlated to
age (r = −0.335, −0.411, −0.409, P < 0.05). Conclusion Mental abilities related to
reaction speed decline earlier. Although the expertise may compensate for the
decline, routine aptitude test will beneﬁt the increasing need for test pilot and
aviation safety.

Introduction
Mental ability and human performance will decline after the peak age, but the
change pattern of different type ability varies. In aviation occupation, an air carrier
ﬂight pilot must retire from pilot job upon reaching their 60th birthday, commonly
referred to as the Age 60 Rule [1], which was implemented by the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) in 1959. Since then, the relationship between pilot age,
piloting performance, and safety has inspired much debate and many questions.
Pilot incapacitation and performance factor are the most important concerns.
Age-related decline in the pilot ability includes rapidly reaction, resisting fatigue,
applying experience and judgement in emergency situations [2]. But in November,
2006, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) revised the maximum
age for pilots from age 60 to age 65, and the United States followed in December
13, 2007 [3]. This may spire the concerns of aviation safety and expertise com-
pensation in aged pilots. Although retired age of test pilot for ﬁghter is far lower
than 65, it is important to study the mental attributes of them because the high
demand of ﬁghter ﬂying.
According to ﬂuid and crystallized intelligence theory, originally identiﬁed by
Cattell [4], ﬂuid intelligence is the capacity to reason and solve problems, inde-
pendent of any knowledge from the past. It typically peaks in young adulthood and
then steadily declines. This decline may be related to local atrophy of the brain in
the right cerebellum [5]. Crystallized intelligence is the ability to use skills,
knowledge, and experience. This improves gradually with age, and stays relatively
stable across most of adulthood, and then begins to decline after age 60, even age
80 [6].
Many researcher concerns about aged pilots ability since it is a high cognition
demand job. Wu et al. [7] used seven cognitive test to investigate the age difference
in the basic cognitive ability of ﬁghter pilots and its inﬂuence upon ﬂying training.
The results show that pilot cognitive ability of the age 26–28 was higher than
younger and older age groups. The age difference were signiﬁcant between age
groups, but did not inﬂuence upon ﬂying performance. Hardy [8] also pointed out
that there was only weak evidence that age-related differences in cognition inﬂu-
ence pilot performance. But Yesavage [9] revealed that pilot performance on
several ﬂight tasks declined signiﬁcantly with age. Quinn Kennedy [10] also found
that older pilots’ (41+ year) decision making ability and ﬂight control performance
were lower than younger pilots, but expertise could attenuated an age-related
decline in ﬂight control.
Flight skills, expertise and, special knowledge are essential to test pilots. Most
test pilots became mature after their age 40. So it is important to study the age effect
on their cognition. In this study, subject matter experts (SMEs) and psychological
test were combined to study mental attributes among aged test pilots.

Discussion
The essential mental attributes of pilots including excellent ability of perception,
memory, thinking, attention, psychomotor and personality character. With the
development of aviation technology, automation gradually replaced many tradi-
tional piloting skills such as stick and rudder control. But test pilots still need the
skills since the automation is not always on work. They must understand the inner
work of the increasingly complicated aviation system besides piloting. The occu-
pation character distinguish the mental attribute from traditional pilot [12].
The USAF have set the special TP requirement of ﬂying ability, technical ability
and professional competence [13]. But the study on mental attributes of test pilots is
rare.
In our survey, the most important mental attributes of older test pilots are related
to professional spirits, ﬂying expertise (judgment) and personality. The psy-
chomotor abilities which rely on neural system function, are less important and
would decline early with aging.
The psychological test results is accordance with the survey results. The older
test pilots’ cognition and perception ability decline as aging since three sub test
scores are lower than younger group. There are no signiﬁcant difference between
two group in personality test. Dual task test is more complex than other tests, and is

Study on Mental Attributes of Aged Test Pilots

done on a simulated radar interface which is similar to pilot work activity, so is not
sensitive to aging effect and can compensated by expertise.
Many studies [14] on general pilots aging and cognition ability or simulation
ﬂight performance found that the relationship between increased age and decreased
ﬂight performance was signiﬁcant. But other factors are also important for the older
pilots performance [15]. Expertise may attenuate an age-related ﬂight control
decline [16] and that expertise effects were most evident in the accuracy of exe-
cuting aviation communications [17], but many performance may not beneﬁt from
experience.
In our study, many test pilots’ cognition and psychomotor ability is above the
average level of younger groups. The individual difference is evident. Many older
test pilot between 45 and 56 years feels the cognition ability decline themselves.
Although they thought that can be compensate by expertise and have no crisis for
safety, it is never too enough to be careful. David [18] examined the effect of age on
aircraft pilots’ cognition with a variety of neuropsychological tests. The results
show that age was signiﬁcantly related to test performance except immediate verbal
recall or recognition. 95% scores lower than 2SD occurred in pilots over age 40
which may also mean a gradual cognition decline. Individual difference was an
importance factor for ﬂying requirement of aged pilots. Tsang [19] reviewed psy-
chological literature about age effects on four cognitive abilities essential to pilot
performance and also concluded that 40 is the declining age. Pilots over age 40
should be evaluated by ability test annually.
With the development of aviation industry, there are increasing demand for test
pilots, either in general or military aviation. The occupation character determines
that the test ﬂying expertise is important to be a qualiﬁed test pilot. Routine aptitude
test will beneﬁt the need for test pilot and aviation safety.

Eye Movement Characteristics Research
on Pilots of Different Experience
Background During Aircraft Cockpit
Display Image Visual Search Task

Abstract The purpose of the study was to ﬁnd visual search characteristics on
cockpit man–machine interface by the pilots with different ﬂight experiences and
different ages. Methods Test objects were 44 men; they were divided into three
groups according to different aircraft cockpit experiences with large screen display
or different age groups. The completely randomized block test was used. The
instrument for recording eye movement was adopted in the process of eye-target
search. Results Among 14 parameters for eye movement, 13 parameters were sta-
tistically signiﬁcant (P < 0.05). Signiﬁcant differences existed between groups of
different experience background. There were seven indicators showed that the
novice group was more than the expert group, the expert pilot group was greater
than the mature group. The results of different age groups were as follows:
Signiﬁcant differences existed among three groups of different ages. Eight eye
movement indicators showed that the values of 40–45-year-old group were more
than that of 25–35-year-old group; the values of 25–35-year-old group were more
than that of 35–40-year-old group. Conclusion The novice group was least familiar
with screen layout and therefore search target took longer time and more ﬁxation
points. The expert pilot group is the most experienced in three groups, but they took
more time to search targets than the mature group. The reason might be that “no
error” thought forced them to conﬁrm on the same issue repeatedly, resulting that
the search efﬁciency was lower. Data of different age groups showed that the older
the ages were the worse eye movement data were. This shows that as the increase of
age the eye’s capture and search ability fall. But for some other indicators, 35–
40-year-old group was better than that of 25–35-year-old group, indicating that

were more novice pilots in 25–35-year-old group, familiarity of the picture can

Introduction
As the direct media of pilot controlling aircraft, human–machine ergonomics of
cockpit display interface directly affect the aircraft controlling effect, the outcome
will directly decide the ﬂight performance. Abroad in the 1960s, researchers began
to study the scanning mode of pilot, many research models are based on eye
movement data or search for support of eye movement data. Using the eye move-
ment data to evaluate instrument scanning behavior of the pilot, in the
three-dimensional space understand the process of the pilot controlling aircraft
posture, location and movement rate and information was obtained from the meter.
After entering the 1980s scanning analysis has been developing rapidly, the analysis
technology and control technology together with aircraft ﬂight parameters evaluate
display design. Bellenkes et al. [1] found difference lies in each phase of the ﬂight
scanning mode. Schriver et al. [2] by verifying relationship of attention and action
(attention-action) to examine the differences in making decision skilled personnel
and ﬂight trainees. Previous research is basically done in actual ﬂight of simulator,
there are few research comparing different experience background of pilots when in
observation of design elements of cockpit display interface, Guo et al. [3] did not use
eye tracking technology during his ergonomic experiment of cockpit display inter-
face such as HUD speed, altitude and heading, ﬂight instruction format. Therefore, it
is necessary to compare visual search characteristics of pilot groups with different
ﬂight experiences and ages using ﬂight cockpit man-machine interface so as to
provide the crucial information for the design of man-machine interface.

Methods
2.1
Test Object
Subjects were a total of 44 people aged between 26 and 49, (average age 36,
SD = 6), ﬂight hours 221–7455.20 h, (average 2142, SD = 1723). According to
different experiences for the aircraft cockpit large screen display, three groups are
divided: novice group, mature, the experts. The novice group consists of 23 people,
86
Y. Wang et al.

aged 26–46 years old, (average age 33, SD = 5), ﬂight hours 221–4580 h, (1282 on
average, SD = 980). Mature group has 7 people, aged between 35 and 43, (aver-
ages age 38, SD = 3), all ﬂight hours 1338–3366 h, 2169 on average, SD = 777).
Expert group has 14 people, aged 34–49 years old, 40 on average, standard devi-
ation 5), ﬂight hours 1772–7455 h, (3541 on average, SD = 2121). Experiment
scheme has gone through the review by the ethics committee; the participants
signed informed consent before test.

Test Conditions
2.2.1
Test Environment
Illumination: intensity daylight saving mode illumination intensity since 8:00–
17:00 of the day (20–220 lx)
2.2.2
Equipment
The instrument used in this experiment is Model D6 Eye View Monitoring Systems
by Applied Science Laboratory. Sampling rate of the equipment is 60 Hz. Record
the participants: eye movement trajectory diagram, eye movement time (including
ﬁxation time, regression time, DE time, saccadic distance, the pupil diameter, etc.).
2.3
Test Design
Test use completely randomized block test paradigm. Test program used is
self-programming, participants were asked to found position in the original
accordingly in the fastest time according to the given target images. The test pro-
gramming was self-compiling. The design elements were extracted from ARJ-21
and seven aircraft cockpit typical images were used. The “target pictures” with
signiﬁcance was intercepted from the pictures for searching. The typical picture
were divided artiﬁcially into twelve quadrants, each quadrant can involve a target.
In the test , “target ﬁgure” appeared ﬁrstly, and then “target ﬁgure” disappeared,
then a with “target ﬁgure” appeared, the participant was asked to locate the “target
ﬁgure” in the larger ﬁgure as fastest as he could. Each image rendering time is
200 ms. Eye movement data accuracy and reaction time are recorded in back-
ground. Questions compiled are randomly appeared. Because given “target” used,
thus problems of different participants experience background are eliminated.

Test Procedure
The participants were told of test purpose and matters needed attention before the test.
Trial begins:
(1) The participants adjust sitting position, the program uses eye movement
apparatus to scale for the participants. Double-click to start testing.
(2) “Instructions” appeared; click “next” into practice after understand.
(3) Exercises are a total of three, if all right formal test can be started.
(4) The ofﬁcial start, the “target” to be tried to ﬁnd appeared ﬁrst, the participants
remember it and then click the blank space key to continue.
(5) A larger ﬁgure with target appears.
(6) After the participants have moved eyes to search the location of the target ﬁgure
in the larger image, click the mouse button to conﬁrm.
(7) Then a calibration image(red “+”) is inserted and the eye tracker calibrates
automatically (see Fig. 1). After the calibration the next trail will begin. Loops
(4)–(6) step until the end of the test.
2.5
Data Statistics
The use of SPSS statistical software package for data processing, all test data are
expressed with mean +/−standard deviation ðx  s). Fourteen of eye movement
indices from the ASL-D6 eye movement apparatus were analyzed, and the set
P < 0.05 for the threshold with difference signiﬁcance in statistic. After inspection,
14 of eye movement data variance are uneven; therefore, multiple independent
samples nonparametric test was adopted (k independent samples test).

Discussions
From the data results it can be seen that different groups of eye movement data
generally show novice and expert groups take longer time, get more ﬁxation points
and lower search efﬁciency when searching target. Analysis reason is that the
novice group was less familiar with screen layout and lead to low search efﬁciency.
Though expert group was the most experienced in three groups, the searching time
was longer than mature group, the reason was that “no error” thought forced them
to conﬁrm on the same issue repeatedly, resulting that the search efﬁciency was
lower. This phenomenon was convinced by the eye movement data. “AOI ﬁrst
processing time”, “AOI ﬁxation time” of expert group were the longest in the three
groups and “AOI regression times” was the most, which indicated that the experts
have done more conﬁrmation after they have found the target. Sibert [4] argues that
regressive number is associated with signiﬁcant number of clues, but it must rule
out experience factors, this study due to the same search target, clues meaning is the
same, so the number of regression should come from the subjects, and its search
decision strategy differences in the test. Expert and novice AOI ﬁrst ﬁxation time is
better than that of mature group, but the ﬁrst processing time is than mature team,
proving that expert and novice have fast recognition to perception characteristics
search target. But for the target to conﬁrm taking is a long time. Analysis reason, for
newcomers, uses a “bottom-up” mode of perception, perception characteristics of
concrete are the ﬁrst focus, and consolidation process (pattern recognition) is easy
to be inﬂuenced by experience, thus slower. But experts always are based on careful
characteristic in the process of task; therefore, they are inclined to integrated
application of perceptual characteristics and pattern recognition, conﬁrming the
target is beneﬁcial to feature recognition, but hindered the graphics integrated
identiﬁcation process.
Pupil size is associated with mood changes [5], to be able to response effort level
and work load of the participants in the test [6], the previous research results show
that in the same task the pupil diameter of specialist subjects on average is the
smallest, and the pupil diameter of the novice group is the biggest, tension, load,
etc., causes pupil diameter increasing of the novice group participants [7]. The
results are consistent with this, it also indicates that the search performance of
92
Y. Wang et al.

expert group is lower than the mature performance; the reason for this is not a big
task load, but need to reconﬁrm the result repeat for cautious decision making.
In dynamic task, eye scanning characteristic and the static image search task
showed different characteristics in the subjects of different experience background,
Kasarkis and Stehwien [8] found that in the process of the plane’s landing simu-
lation, visual scanning rules of different experience pilots are quite different.
Experts watch frequently than novice, residence time is shorter, total ﬁxation point
number is more. Experts have a clear scanning mode, and ﬁxation point total
number of pilots of precise landing is more, watching residence time is shorter.
Jacob and Karn [9] study found that in the static image search task, more ﬁxation
point number shows lower search efﬁciency, the target is not conﬁrmed; this is the
same with the results of this study.
With the increase of age, adult visual system function and visual search ability
decline, visual perceptual speed and eye movement speed is reduced; many studies
are focused on this problem. Results conﬁrmed are, Abel [10] study found that with
increasing age, saccadic incubation period increases, Ross [11] study found that
smooth tracking ability is reduced, In the three groups in the study, 40–45-year-old
group visual search efﬁciency is lower than the other two groups, showed by the
ﬁxation point quantity and ﬁxation time increased, consistent with previous results.
But in processing efﬁciency in stimulating target, 35–40-year-old group is better
than the other two groups, showed by short processing time in the interest area.
There may be two reasons for analysis: One is the cognitive abilities gradually
decline with age, different cognitive abilities have different rates of cognitive
declining, David [12] studied 220 pilots aged 28–62 years old, showing that, most
of the cognitive performance has negative correlation with age, but the correlation
coefﬁcient is low; but the individual of single poor cognitive performance is gen-
erally between the ages of 43–62. Another reason is, the vast majority of 25–
35-years-old group are novice, using a bottom-up mode of perception, familiarity of
target is low, leading to low machining efﬁciency, and 35–40-year-old group per-
ception ability has yet to reach down a turning point, and has relatively rich
experience using a top-down mode of perception for target, so the machining
efﬁciency is high. Also show that interaction between age and experience back-
ground, because 25–35-year-old group has more novice participants, familiarity of
images can make up for the lack of physical reaction speed.

Visual Characteristics Study
of Traditional Round-Backed
Armchair Based on Eye-Tracking
Yun Liu, Yi Zhou, Hanzhou Qiu and Liming Shen
Abstract With the pictures of the traditional round-backed armchairs being the
sample, TOBII Eye-Tracker is adopted for the eye-tracking experiments, followed
by the study of several key issues based on the Semantic Differential Five-Level
Quantitative Scale surveys. The results suggest: the visual highlight of the
round-backed armchair lies in the upper part of the chair. The arch enclosure virtual
plane enhances the layering of the furniture, but lowers the visual stability. A proper
supplement of embellishment and supports (Ya Tou) with classic pictures could
cultivate users’ recognition for the traditional round-backed armchair and elevate
the overall preference and intent to purchase the round-backed armchairs.

Introduction
As an important category of the Chinese traditional chairs, the round-backed chair
has formed unique characteristics along its long-term development. With the major
feature of lines, the overall shape is simple, elegant and full of dynamics, combined
with its profound cultural intension, explaining its popularity in the furniture market
[1]. Whether the aesthetics of traditional round-backed chairs could be accepted by
consumers depends on whether they could obtain the aesthetical recognition from
the visual features of the product, which could inﬂuence their perception for the
product and the intent to buy [2]. It is revealed in a study that 80–90% of the

external information is received by human through eyes [3]. Therefore, this study
adopts the eye-tracking experiment and the semantic differential method (SD
method) scale survey to study the visual characteristics of traditional round-backed
chairs and the possibility of purchase.

Method
2.1
Testee
Twelve volunteers, all teachers and students, were recruited from the Nanjing
Forestry University, including six males and six females, and all aged between 22
and 35. The health condition was found normal without the symptom of colour
blindness or weakness. The naked or corrected visual acuity was all above 1.0. No
expose to the television or the computer was ensured within the 6 h before the test.
No discomfort occurred to the eyes. Females were required to remove the eye
make-up.
2.2
Experiment Instruments and Materials
Based on the ClearView 2.7.0 software system, the Sweden TOBII Eye-Tracker
was used to record the eye tracks of the testees. The test was located in the
perceptual engineering laboratory in the Shaw’s Building of the Nanjing Forestry
University.
Two
classic
round-backed
armchairs
were
chosen
in
the
test
[4]:
Chrysanthemum pear round-backed armchair and rosewood Ruyi round-backed
armchair, the experimental images as shown in Figs. 1 and 2. The discoloration
mode and the size remained consistent, and the background adopted 35% grey, to
avoid the visual fatigue of testees.
2.3
Experimental Indicator Selection
The experiment purpose is to explore the visual effects of the traditional
round-backed armchairs, namely the testees’ sight distribution and the attention
mode of different parts. The round-backed armchair was separated into three areas
of interest (AOI): backboard, back-hoop and legs. The total ﬁxation duration, ﬁx-
ation points, average ﬁxation duration and combined heat map of each AOI were
adopted as the eye-tracking indicators.

Experiment Flow and Methodology
After explaining the tasks to testees, they were placed about 600 mm away from the
screen to follow the eye calibration procedure. Then each testee would watch the
pictures of the round-backed armchairs, where each picture would be shown for
10 s [5]. Subjective reviews were completed right after watching, including sta-
bility, sense of fashion, decoration level, sense of layering, overall appearance
rating and intent to purchase. The ﬁnal form is presented with the semantic dif-
ferential ﬁve-level scale.

Results and Discussion
3.1
Results and Analysis of the Eye-Tracking Data
3.1.1
Charts and Analysis of the Eye-Tracking Data
Table 2 and Fig. 4 show that the total ﬁxation points of the two round-backed
armchairs are approaching the same. But compared to the legs, the back of the chair
with more designing elements receives more attention, revealing a ﬁnding that the
visual highlight of the round-backed armchair lies in the upper part of the chair. As
shown in Tables 1 and 3, the attention values of the back-hoop and legs do not vary
a lot between the two types of round-backed armchair. But the legs with the arch
enclosure apparently receive longer ﬁxation duration than QuanKou. Moreover, the
standard deviation of the Chrysanthemum pear round-backed armchair is obviously
higher than that of the other, suggesting a larger dispersion of the ﬁxation times of
testees. For the back of the chair, due to the hollowed-out embellishment on the
backboard, the rosewood Ruyi round-backed armchair earns a noticeably larger
ﬁxation duration. The slopes of the two lines in Figs. 3 and 5 have indicated that a
longer ﬁxation duration is distributed to the back rather than legs for rosewood Ruyi
round-backed armchair compared with the Chrysanthemum pear round-backed
armchair, with the visual highlight moving up.

3.1.2
Analysis of the Combined Heat Map
It could be inferred from Figs. 6 and 7 that the attention of the testees is distributed
along the linear components of the armchair and focused on the joints and deco-
rations of the components. By comparing the heat maps of the chairs, the hot areas
(red zone) of the rosewood Ruyi round-backed armchair are larger but fewer in
amount and more concentrated on the upper part, while the hot areas of the
Chrysanthemum pear round-backed armchair are smaller, more in amount and more
evenly distributed, indicating that testees need more ﬁxation points to look for the
interesting targets.
3.2
Analysis of Subjective Reviews
The subjective reviews respond to the “aesthetic recognition” and “intent to pur-
chase” of testees. The results are shown below.

Table 4 and Fig. 8 show that: (1) in terms of the visual stability, the linear
components like the arch enclosure and Ai Lao on the legs of the Chrysanthemum
pear round-backed armchair have formed multiple virtual planes, which seem more
empty compared with the other type of chair, leading to a lower visual stability;
(2) as regards the sense of fashion, the traditional taste delivered by the two is at the
same level; (3) by the decoration level, the backboard of the rosewood Ruyi
round-backed armchair adopts the Ruyi pattern cavity. Both sides of the upper
back-legs are decorated with long supports. QuanKou surrounds the space below
the chair-board on three sides. The overall decoration level is obviously higher than
the Chrysanthemum pear round-backed armchair; (4) by the sense of layering, there
are multiple virtual planes overlapping on the Chrysanthemum pear round-backed

armchair, whose sense of layering is higher than the other; (5) the aesthetic per-
ception of the two chairs is basically on the same level, but testees apparently prefer
the rosewood Ruyi round-backed armchair considering the intent to purchase.
To explore the relationship between the aesthetic indicators, overall appearance
perception and the intent to purchase, the follow correlation analysis is conducted.
Table 5 demonstrates that the maximum correlation coefﬁcient of the stability
and overall appearance perception of the Chrysanthemum pear round-backed
armchair is 0.665, as the uncorrelated probability remains smaller than 0.05. The
appearance with a strong sense of layering arrests testees’ attention on the stability,
which is the consideration for the functionality. The maximum correlation

coefﬁcient of the decoration level and the overall appearance perception of the
rosewood Ruyi round-backed arm chair is 0.90, with the uncorrelated probability
remaining smaller than 0.01, representing that the hollowed-out Ruyi embellish-
ment in the traditional Chinese culture has the largest inﬂuence on the overall
appearance perception. The correlation coefﬁcient of the intent to purchase with
stability, sense of fashion, decoration level and sense of layering remains all low,
but is large when it comes to the overall appearance perception, showing a positive
correlation.

Conclusion
(1) Users distribute more attention on the upper part of the traditional round-backed
armchairs than on the lower part. The distribution is along the “linear” com-
ponents of the hair, which also reﬂects the leading effect of the “lines”.
Meanwhile, lines creating many enclosed virtual planes might lead to users’
consideration for the stability.
(2) Users’ attention would be focused on the joints of “lines” and the embellish-
ment of “points” when watching the traditional round-backed armchairs. So, the
location of “point” embellishment matters a lot to the visual highlight. Using
the classic embellishment, image could extend the universality of user per-
ception. Meanwhile, it could be learnt from the subjective surveys that the
location of visual highlight and the perception of the visual stability leave no
inﬂuence.
(3) For traditional round-backed armchairs, the intent to purchase is strongly cor-
related with the overall appearance perception. The better the appearance
perception, the higher the intention to purchase.

and operation procedure increased the workload signiﬁcantly, which will put for-
ward higher requirements on the long-haul ﬂight endurance, anti-G, space orien-
tation, and cognitive and decision-making ability. In addition to strict physical
examination, aeromedical selection for high-performance ﬁghter pilot will focus on
physiological and psychological ability. The evaluation indexes of traditional
selection method for ﬁghter pilot can hardly meet the requirements for
high-performance ﬁghter pilot selection.
The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) [1] is a kind of multi-index comprehensive
evaluation method based on the theory of the operational research, with a relatively
stronger theoretical basis and objective analysis. With the advantages of being
concise and efﬁcient, AHP was widely used and extensively researched. Based on
the

for
high-performance ﬁghter pilot, this paper aims to construct an evaluation model of
physiological and psychological selection for high-performance ﬁghter pilot based
on AHP. And the evaluation model was preliminarily applied in ﬁghter pilot
selection.

Method
2.1
Subjects
Physiological and psychological indexes were examined on 16 male ﬁghter pilots
(age 27.5±4.2 years) whose clinical physical examination results meets the relevant
pilot physical examination standards.

Analytic Hierarchy Process Model
2.2.1
Construction of the Hierarchical Structure Model
Based on extensive literature and documents investigation, we studied the
requirements for the physical and mental diatheses of high-performance ﬁghter
pilot. As shown in Table 1 an evaluation index system including 5 ﬁrst level and 23
second level indexes was developed. According to the general approach on the
construction of the hierarchical structure model, the ﬁrst step was to set the goal for
solving the question, that was to select the suitable pilots. Then, all the relating
aspects or factors of the goal were classiﬁed, i.e., all the evaluation indexes were
classiﬁed hierarchically. The last step was to set the alternatives, i.e., the candidate
pilots under selection.

2.2.2
Construction of the Judgment Matrix
To construct the judgment matrix, questionnaires were distributed to some experts
of aviation medicine. The experts would make decisions on the relative importance
between indexes of one level to an upper level index with 1–9 scale (Table 2).
According to the experts’ judgment results, the judgment matrix could be
constructed.
To ensure the logical rationality of judgment matrix and avoid the error of
experts, we need to check the consistency of the judgment matrix and calculate the
consistency ratio C.R. (consistency ratio).

Among them, C.I. is the consistency index. R.I. is the mean random consistency
index, kmax is the maximum eigenvalue of judgment matrix. n is the order of the
matrix. R.I. is shown in Table 3, depending on the order of the judgment matrix.
When C.R. <0.1, it is considered that the consistency of the judgment matrix is
acceptable. When C.R. >0.1, it is considered that the judgment matrix does not meet
the requirement of consistency, and the expert is required to revise the judgment
matrix.
2.2.3
Calculation of the Index Weights
After the construction of the judgment matrix and the veriﬁcation of its consistency,
hierarchical single-level sorting and hierarchical total-level sorting were calculated.
The relative weights of the second-level indexes for pilot physiological and psy-
chological selection were obtained.
Hierarchical single sorting was to calculate the relative weights of indexes in
each judgment matrix. The eigenvector for the maximum eigenvalue kmax of
judgment matrix was normalized (the sum of each element in the vector was equal
to 1) to get the weight vector of the all the indexes in the judgment matrix.
Hierarchical total sorting was to calculate the relative weight of each index in a
certain criteria level for the goal level. The weight was calculated from top to
bottom and synthesized level by level.
Assuming that the relative weight of index m indexes in k−1 level to the goal
level was w(k−1), then

Physiological and Psychological Selection …
109

Clinical physical examinations were carried out before the above physiological
and psychological examinations. The clinical physical examination results of all the
pilots meet the relevant pilot physical examination standards. The relevant instru-
ments and equipment used in the examination of physiological and psychological
indexes are approved by the state or the army.
2.4
Evaluation on the Indexes
To make the AHP model for pilot selection more objective and minimize the
inﬂuence of human factors, questionnaires were distributed to 20 aeromedical
experts. Each expert made his decision or judgment on the relative importance of
various indexes, basing on their knowledge and experience. Since professional
knowledge, experience, and motivation preferences of the experts were different,
the judgment matrix was not necessarily the same. Therefore, we used the group
decision-making method to solve this problem. We used the expert self-assessment
score (1–5) on familiarity and professional expertise in the questionnaires to
determine the expert weights. The modiﬁed weights of all the indexes were
obtained by expert weighting and averaging on the ranking vector. Final scores can
be calculated by weighting on the physiological and psychological examination
results of the pilots. By ranking of the ﬁnal scores, we could select the most suitable
high-performance ﬁghter pilots.

Results
3.1
Analytic Hierarchy Structure Model
Hierarchical structure model was composed of three levels:
1. The goal level, which refers to goal to solve the problem, which was to select the
most suitable high-performance ﬁghter pilot.
2. The criteria level, which refers to indexes needed consider as decision criterion
to achieve the goal. Here was the pilot physiological and psychological selection
index system, which consists of two levels.
3. The alternative level, which refers to the alternatives to achieve the goal,
namely, the candidate pilots to be selected.
The hierarchy structure model is shown in Fig. 1.

3.2
Judgment Matrix
Aviation medicine experts made their decision or judgments on the relative
importance between every two index, either in the ﬁve ﬁrst-level indexes or in the
second-level indexes related to one upper level index, according to their knowledge
and experience. The relative importance between indexes to an upper level index
was marked with 1–9 scale.
The judgment matrix of one expert was constructed and is shown as an example
in Table 4.
The consistency ratio was 0.0001, 0.0273, 0.0039, 0.0088, 0.0116, and 0.0088,
respectively, which were less than 0.1. Therefore, the judgment matrix passed the
consistency check.

Index Weights
First of all, the expert weights were determined by normalization of the expert
self-assessment score on familiarity and professional expertise. The weights of all
the indexes were modiﬁed by weighting and averaging with the expert weights.
By calculation, the relative weights of the ﬁve ﬁrst-level indexes were: 0.1728,
0.2241, 0.1785, 0.2891, and 0.1355, respectively.
For the second-level indexes, the weights of 6 second level indexes related to
basic physiological function were 0.1839, 0.1201, 0.2083, 0.1968, 0.1600, and
0.1308; the relative weights of 4 second level indexes related to physiological
endurance were 0.3240, 0.2611, 0.2049, and 0.2100; the relative weights of 3
second level indexes related to the psychological basis were 0.3089, 0.3417, and
0.3494; the relative weights of 4 second level indexes related to mental ability were
0.1253, 0.2233, 0.2635, and 0.3879; the relative weights of 6 second level indexes
related to ﬁtness and ergonomics were 0.1283, 0.2102, 0.2041, 0.1831, 0.1031, and
0.1712. The relative weight of each individual index of second level was calculated
by Eq. (4).
3.4
Comprehensive Evaluation
Assuming Si was the comprehensive evaluation result for the ith pilot, [A1i A2i …
E6i] was the physiological and psychological indexes evaluation score vector of the
ith pilot, where i = 1, 2, … 16. wj was the relative weight of jth single index, where
j = 1, 2, … 23. Comprehensive evaluation results vector of 16 pilots was calculated
with Eq. (5).

Conclusion
Super maneuverability of the high-performance ﬁghter makes pilots have to with-
stand higher acceleration and acceleration growth, facing more frequent accelera-
tion stimulation and push–pull effect. The big amount of the data information and
processing demands increase
the decision-making and cognitive workload

signiﬁcantly. All these put forward higher and special requirements for the physi-
ological function, mental ability and physical ability. As Linder and Tielemans [2]
had suggested, in addition to the existing selection criteria, a new generation of
super agility aircraft pilot selection should focus on the visual and vestibular,
hearing, respiratory, cardiovascular, skeletal muscle, cognitive, and neural system.
Lafortune [3] indicated that the major issues for the F35 pilots will be information
management, sensor fusion and management, ﬂying with might-aided visual sys-
tems, and the safety in high G-force ﬂight.
As for the comprehensive evaluation method for pilot selection, multivariate
statistical methods [4] were often used by the US and European countries [5, 6].
The US air force is using the PCSM (Pilot Candidate Selection Method) system in
pilot selection [7] since 1993. And the PCSM uses the comprehensive evaluation
model based on multiple regression analysis [8].
To improve the objectivity of multi-index comprehensive evaluation method for
high-performance ﬁghter pilot selection, this paper constructed a comprehensive
evaluation model basing on the group decision AHP method and preliminary
applied it in a high-performance ﬁghter pilot psychological selection and assess-
ment task. AHP makes the thinking process of expert decision hierarchically and
quantitatively and provides quantitative and mathematical basis to analysis, deci-
sion, forecast, or control. The analysis on the nature of the problem, factors
involved in the problems, and the internal relation of AHP was thorough and clear.
AHP is also very simple and easy to use. The weights of the 23 selection indexes
well reﬂected the relative importance of the physiological and psychological
indexes on high-performance ﬁghter pilot selection.
In this paper, a more objective comprehensive evaluation method for
high-performance ﬁghter pilot selection was tested. The correlation of the physi-
ological and psychological indexes and the prediction efﬁciency of current AHP
evaluation model still need to be studied and optimized basing on the real pilot
training result. In this research work, a large amount of physiological and psy-
chological examination data were also accumulated. Basis and reference were
provided for future research on the high-performance ﬁghter pilot selection.

of Shoulder-Mounted Equipment

Abstract The purpose of this paper is to increase the scientiﬁcalness of
shoulder-mounted equipment operator’s training. A research on shoulder-mounted
equipment operator’s body force stress in standing and kneeling positions quali-
tatively points out that operator should strengthen the training of some body parts.
Training these relative parts is of much pertinence to improve the training effect.
Based on the simpliﬁed model of human body and static analysis method, the main
stressed parts in two different training states are found—in standing position and in
kneeling position. In this way, the methods of how to strengthen the training after
conﬁrmed the main stressed parts of operator in different training states are pointed
out. The main stressed parts of shoulder-mounted equipment operator in standing
and kneeling positions are presented, and corresponding training methods provide
strong support for operator’s scientiﬁc training.

Signiﬁcance of Research
For operator’s training, we use the feeling of fatigue after static training to get the
purpose of standard training generally, because muscle can “remember” the oper-
ating posture due to this kind of fatigue. In practice, we ﬁnd that some operators
may feel overtired easily if we only increase the amount of time spent on training,
and this may cause a deviation of posture and harm operator’s health. So we want to
make a preliminary research on operator’s body force stress in different postures
through stress analysis and provide the theoretical support to enhance the level of
training. There are three signiﬁcances.

1.1
To Enhance the Scientiﬁcity of Training
More stressed body parts in different positions by the operating posture static
analysis method are found out. The pertinence of the training of these body parts in
preparatory phase is enhanced to lay a foundation of formal training. We expect the
training will be more scientiﬁc.
1.2
To Prepare for the Quantitative Analysis
Qualitatively point out the main stressed body parts of shoulder-mounted equip-
ment operator in different positions can make preparation for the future research and
training. Then analyze quantitatively through data collection and grouping com-
parison to make the more accurate research on operating posture.
1.3
To Promote the Study of Human
Posture and action are at the center of the study of human; through analysis we can
obtain the operator’s body force stress of main stressed parts in different positions
and present the key stressed parts of shoulder-mounted equipment operator in
different positions qualitatively. It is based on quality development, aimed at
enhancing the man–machine integration and to promote the in-depth study of
human [1].
2
Analysis of Operating Posture
For the shoulder-mounted equipment, the fatigue and stressed body parts of
operator are so many. Through questionnaire and statistic methods [2], we ﬁnd out
these parts. There are more than 20 parts such as neck, shoulders, the right hand,
and waist. There exist obvious differences in different operating posture. Hereby,
this paper made an analysis on two typical postures.
2.1
Standing Position
Standing position means that when people is standing on his feet the angle of upper
body ﬂexion is smaller than 30° [3], as shown in Fig. 1. Standing posture has some
advantages such as wide range of ﬁeld of vision, big space for operating and full
118

power output. But its disadvantages are also obvious: Muscle needs the stronger
power output to support the weight, operator may feel tired easily, and especially
when standing for a long time, the fatigue may cause broken veins.
From
the
article
Experimental
Research
of
Shoulder-mounted
Portable
Equipment Operator’s Foot Spacing in Standing Position [4], we can ﬁnd the
analysis of operator’s body force stress in standing position [5, 6], and this article
focused on the variable part—the beneﬁt of changing foot space on operating
stability.
After analyzed the foot, we can ﬁnd out the other main stressed parts through
transmission law of force: They are neck, right shoulder, waist, both legs and both
feet. Because the equipment is handheld portable equipment, and operator’s left big
arm, right-hand palm, right forearm and right big arm exceed the comfortable
operating area when operating the equipment, these parts may feel uncomfortable

easily. The operating has very high demands for eye and ear also. Above all, the
main stressed parts are (1) eye, (2) ear, (3) neck, (4) right shoulder, (5) arm,
(6) palm, (7) waist, (8) leg, (9) foot.
(1)
The eye should have fast vision response speed and sensitive visual ori-
entation ability except the good congenital vision.
(2)
The ear should have auditory localization ability and auditory response
speed.
(3)
Neck should be kept straight and curved properly with ﬂexible movement
which means that neck should be kept straight ﬁrstly to ensure the normal
operating but neck also should be curved properly so that different operator
can adapt to the equipment. Keeping proper curve can maintain the sta-
bility of man–machine integration. “Flexible movement” means that neck
can rotate ﬂexibly.
(4)
Right shoulder should have certain endurance and support force to keep
steady and square. “Steady” means that operator should keep two shoul-
ders relatively stable without swing and moving; “square” means that
operator should keep two shoulders relatively horizontal to realize the
exact operating.
(5)
Arms and hands should have endurance and push–pull effort. If it is not
necessary to operate the equipment during operating, operator should use
the endurance of arms and hands to support the front of the equipment and
keep the stability of equipment; if operator needs to operate the equipment,
he should use the push–pull effort of arms and hands to do the action
rapidly and accurately.
(6)
Palm should provide steady support to operating, so the operating has very
high demands for the endurance of palm and ﬂexibility of ﬁngers.
(7)
Waist should meet the requirements of “stand up straight and upright” and
“rotate smoothly and steady.” “Stand up straight and upright” means that
when operator is standing, his waist is straight, and his upper body is
upright; “rotate smoothly and steady” means that waist should cooperate
with feet to move during operating.
(8), (9)
Legs and feet should have endurance and push–pull effort to support and
assist the rotary movement of waist. Especially in standing position, the
stable support of legs and feet is the base for operating.
2.2
Kneeling Position
Kneeling position means that the operator kneels down on his right knee, the angle
between right calf and right thigh is about 90°, body center of gravity is on right
leg, left leg is in front of body, and the angle between left calf and left thigh is about
90°. Posture of upper body in kneeling position is same as that in standing position.
120
Z. Luo et al.

Kneeling position has advantage of good stability. But compared with standing
position, it has more disadvantages: Field of vision is not wide enough, space for
operating is small, and operator is not able to play a full strength. In kneeling
position, operator may feel tired easily because huge portions of weight all press on
right knee, even pain and numb. In kneeling position, the main stressed part is right
knee, as shown in Fig. 2.
In kneeling position, the posture is relatively ﬁxed. We can ﬁnd out the other
main stressed parts through transmission law of force: They are neck, right
shoulder, waist, right knee, right thigh and both feet. In operating, operator’s left
big arm, right-hand palm, right forearm and right big arm are dangling so these
parts may feel uncomfortable easily. Above all, the main stressed parts are (1) eye,
(2) ear, (3) neck, (4) right shoulder, (5) arm, (6) palm, (7) waist, (8) right thigh,
(9) right knee, (10) foot.
The requirements for main stressed parts (1)–(8) in kneeling position are same as
those in standing position.

operating in kneeling position

(9)
The function of right knee is to support the weight, so requirements for this
part are higher. It should have a stable and enduring endurance to support the
weight, especially when operating time is long.
(10)
During operating, forefoot and heel of left foot and right knee are three points
which can maintain the stability of operator’s body. So, left foot is required
to provide enough endurance.
3
Pertinence Training
Based on the questionnaire and force analysis result, we should do pertinence and
adaptive training for key parts so that operators can master standard action. The
training time and training content are shown as follows:
3.1
Training Opportunity
Before training, preparation is an effective method to reduce fatigue, so operators
should do proper warm-up. Warm-up can promote blood circulation, each organ of
human body can change from rest state to motion state due to warm-up, and
temperature of muscle, ligament and joint also can be increased. For some key
parts, physical vitality will be improved.
During training, operators should keep moderate relaxation after one set of
training to relief training fatigue and prepare for the next set of training.
After training, operators should do some relaxation exercises to eliminate
tiredness.
3.2
Training Content
To determine pertinence training content according to main stressed parts, the two
operating postures are needed.
(1) With computer simulation technology, we can improve vision response speed
and sensitive visual orientation ability through virtual training. (2) Auditory
localization ability and auditory response speed of ear can be trained by auditory
orientation training system. (3) Neck can be trained by stretching exercises and
rotation motion. (4) Before operating, operator can make preparation for muscle,
ligament and joint of shoulder through circle annulus movement. (5), (6) Dumbbell
can be used to do some training for improving the endurance of arm muscle.
(7) Sandbags carrying exercise and sit-ups can be used for improving waist and
abdominal muscle strength. (8) For training of legs, long-distance running and
122
Z. Luo et al.

high-step stretch of legs are good methods to improve the endurance and strength of
legs. (9), (10) Squat thrust exercise is a good training way to develop endurance and
support strength of knee and feet.
Besides, armor can be used for shoulder and knee to avoid injuries in training
because shoulder and knee have less muscle, and this can also provide favorable
conditions for continued training.
4
Conclusion
Stress demands in different positions of shoulder-mounted equipment operator
through statistic analysis are found, the main stressed parts through force analysis
are pointed out, the corresponding training content and training time are presented,
basis for experimental research is provided, and the foundation for improving
training quality and future research is laid.

Introduction
Published in May 2015 white paper on “China’s military strategy” clearly pointed
out: The world revolution in military affairs (RMA) is proceeding to a new stage.
Long-range, precise, smart, stealthy and unmanned weapons and equipment are
becoming increasingly sophisticated. Outer space and cyber space have become
new commanding heights in strategic competition among all parties. The form of
war is accelerating its evolution to informationization [1]. This is the forecast and
basic assessment of the development characteristic of weapon equipment of world
in current and future certain time. With the development of weapons and equipment

that presents a new trend, the quality of military personnel also put forward new
requirements. The cultivation of new military talents should focus on enhancing
physical ability, improving skills and developing intelligence.

New Tendency of Development of the Weapons
and Equipment
2.1
Informationization
With the application of information technology in weapons and equipment, its high
degree of integration and extensive penetration of the characteristics of weapons
and equipment increase the tactical technical performance and combat effectiveness
unprecedented, resulting in the improvement and research of weapons and equip-
ment use information technology increasingly, and the development of weapons
and equipment has shown a general tendency of information.
Modern main battle platform, precision-guided weapons, space warfare weapons
and other equipment have been equipped with a large number of information
technology devices, such as satellite positioning navigation equipment, ﬁre control
systems and electronic countermeasure devices. And with the development and
application of cloud computing and Internet of Things and other emerging infor-
mation technology, combat equipment or support equipment will further improve
its tactical technical performance, making weapons and equipment more and more
information, so that make big inﬂuence on the future war.
2.2
Unmanned
With the rapid development of military high-tech, on the one hand makes the war
attack more accurate, the war conditions more cruel, the combat operations more
dangerous, on the other hand also strongly promote the development of unmanned
combat platform, may say that the unmanned combat platform conform to the need
of development of future war.
In the future high-tech battleﬁeld, with the gradual improvement in the ability of
the precise strike, long-range engagement and mass destruction, there will be more
and more professional soldiers, especially those who bear the dangerous and heavy,
complicated and hard mission and will shift from the combat to the front of
computer terminal; in some cases, the traditional task completed by the warﬁghters
can be borne by the unmanned system, the needs of the development of war form,
and support provided by scientiﬁc basis is bound to keep this trend becoming a
reality rapidly [2]. At the same time, unmanned combat platform without casualties,
a high degree of integration of technology, low life-cycle cost and other advantages,
as well as the fast-growing strong driving force and inner drive.

2.3
Intelligent
With the use of information technology as the core of high-tech applications in the
military ﬁeld, weapons and equipment have gradually become the agent which, as a
core of artiﬁcial intelligence, can automatically search, identify, track, judge and
destroy the target, and present the intelligent trend gradually.
Intellectualization of weapons and equipment through the weapons system with
those who have a similar person’s senses organ (various sensors), the central ner-
vous (information data transmission equipment), the brain (automatic command and
control system) and limbs (in a variety of missile-borne, vehicle-mounted, airborne,
shipboard man–machine combination structure of precision strike weapon) and
other components of the multi-integrated weapons system to achieve [3]. Intelligent
embodied in three aspects: the battleﬁeld perception, intelligent decision-making
and precision strike of the weapons and equipment. Intelligent precision-guided
weapons can carry out their own combat mission planning, automatic discovery and
identiﬁcation of targets and automatically select the attack path and implement
combat.
2.4
Stealth
Due to the development of radar technology, the battleﬁeld transparency enhances
unprecedentedly, the penetration and attack are even more difﬁcult, and therefore
the weaponry stealth technology obtains development unprecedentedly. As an
effective means to improve the survival, penetration, especially the deep strike
capability of the weapon system, it has become the most important and effective
tactical technique in the six-dimensional modern warfare of land, sea, air, sky,
electricity and magnetism [4].
In recent years, infrared stealth, radar stealth, visible stealth and other stealth
technology have been widely used in aircraft, missiles, ships and other existing
weapons and equipment improvements and the development of new weapons. At
the same time, low RCS shape technology, radar absorbing materials, plasma
technology and other modern stealth means develop rapidly toward the “thin, wide,
light, strong” direction [5]. New stealth mechanism and technical means and the
development of new stealth materials will bring a breakthrough in the development
of stealth technology.

New Requirement of the Quality of Military Talents
Modern war shows not only the material force confrontation, but also a contest of
human physical ability, skills and intelligence.
The New Requirement of the Development of Weapons …
127

3.1
Enhance Physical Ability and Lay the Foundation
of Talent Quality
Physical ability is the general level of physical quality, is the basic support of
military combat winning mechanism and is the basis of modern military quality [6].
Physical ability has six elements, including cardiovascular endurance, muscle
strength and endurance, ﬂexibility, agility, strength and balance. For the military,
the physical ability combine with combat missions, tactical background and bat-
tleﬁeld environment, enhancing the military physical ability should highlight the
speciﬁc on the basis of the six elements, and carry out closely with actual combat.
Looking back on the history of human war, physical ability has always played a
vital role as a constant component of combat effectiveness. In cold weapons era,
physical ability is the core elements of combat effectiveness, the way of transfor-
mation from physical ability to combat effectiveness is direct, the process is simple,
the effect is obvious, and physical ability determines the operational capacity of an
army. Under the condition of modern information warfare, with the increase in
heavy load of individual soldier, expansion of battleﬁeld space, upgrade of ﬁghting
and killing, increase of war rhythm, reﬁned division of labor of the arm of the
services, the requirements of military physical ability get higher and higher, the
physical ability is still the important basis essential factor of combat effectiveness
[7].
3.2
Improve the Skills and Consolidate the Quality of Talent
Military skills are the main body of overall development of modern military
comprehensive quality, are the necessary skills and ability of serviceman who apply
knowledge and experience to complete a task in the military activities and are a
comprehensive embodiment of mental skills and action skills [6, p 238].
Military skills consist of two parts, the tactical and technical skill. Tactics
include tactical thinking and tactical implementation. Technology includes the
theoretical knowledge and operation of weapons and equipment.
With the rapid development of information technology and artiﬁcial intelligence,
the trend of weapon equipment development is more obvious, but the master of
these weapons is always people, and people in the modern war still plays a key role
about the success or failure of the war. Even if the weapons and equipment how
advanced, if we want to control high-tech war, the key and fundamental is improve
the operation and command skills of military and the ability to adapt to weapons
and equipment.

3.3
Develop Intelligence and Strengthen the Core
of the Quality of Talent
Intelligence is relative to the physical ability and skills and refers to learning,
memory, thinking, understanding of objective things and the ability to solve
practical problems [8]. Intelligence is the integrated embodiment of its knowledge,
intelligence and talent and is the core of modern military qualities.
Intelligent military professional has the following several essential factors:
courageous judgment ability, scientiﬁc thinking ability, keen insight, clever strategy
ability, strong cohesion, nimble handling ability, fast adaptiveness, excellent
operational command capability, decisive decision-making ability, super foresight
ability, strong communication ability, wise coordination ability, exuberant inno-
vation capabilities as well as the highly effective memory.
Future high-tech war is a war that the knowledgeable serviceman uses weapons
and equipment and network command and control means, and one of the important
characteristics is intelligence against becoming an operational style that relates to
success or failure of war [6, p 238]. The traditional wisdom must combine with the
new technology, promote each other and give each other new vitality, only then
achieve the organic combination of both, can shorten the technical gap between the
enemy and achieve the purpose of victory.

Conclusions
In short, in order to adapt to the needs of the future high-tech local war and to meet
the challenge of the informationization, unmanned, intelligent, stealth military
weapons and equipment, we must create a new type of integrated military per-
sonnel. In the integration of development, physical ability is the foundation, skills
are the main body, intellectual is the core, the three have different contents and
interaction and complement each other. The coordinated development of physical
ability, skill and intelligence is the direction of our military’s high-quality personnel
training. It is consistent with the development of the whole national education in the
direction of totalization and integration. Only by cultivating such integrated military
personnel can we adapt to the national and military modernization construction and
future war’s need [6, p 239–240].

A Study on the Method of Human
Observation and Software Design
Jiang Wu, Qiqing Su, Hongyan Ou, Honglei Li, Chuanyin Ji
and Chenhui Li
Abstract The observational test of human is to quantify human’s observation by
certain means. It is based on the existing theories. With the advancement of science
and technology, the method of observational test is changing every day. Through
compiling the software of human’s observation and the existing observational test
theories, we can develop software of human’s observational test, which is based on
the data base. This testing method written in the software not just puts the tradi-
tional paper testing in the computer, but also adds new testing means based on
theory. If a lot of people use this observational testing software, then we can build a
data base of different human observation levels for the next statistical analysis.
Meantime, we tried to add the training module in the software to improve the
observers’ level of testing.

Introduction to Observation and Testing Status
Observation is a combination of multiple senses. There are individual differences in
human observation, and these differences with the innate quality and acquired
practice and training are closely related. There are three important indicators of
observation, namely breadth: refers to a person in the acquisition of speciﬁc
external information and the amount of data can be extracted in the scope, type,
quantity, etc.; precision: that people can get the accuracy and precision of infor-
mation; speed: refers to the speed of access to information the extent of people [1].
Human observation as an important psychological indicator can be judged by
some methods, such as by the quantitative things to respond to determine the time,

through the identiﬁcation of things to determine the degree of property and other
methods. People have also made a number of test functions with the system, and
methods to determine the quality of human observation are mainly divided into two
types: the ﬁrst is more in the laboratory of professional testing system, mainly used
in scientiﬁc research. This system is relatively accurate test results, but the system is
huge, expensive, and difﬁcult to debug operation; the second method is constantly
in the process of practice to explore the universality of some of the test means and
the application of these tools is simple, Interference by the external environment is
small, but the accuracy is not very high.
Now many social positions in the selection of human observation have certain
requirements, but due to the lack of compliance with the requirements of the
observation test method, the more choice is through the second method of some
simple means to select the qualiﬁed personnel; however, this method is usually
based on paper media as the carrier, and the test process that is not tightly organized
will lead to inaccurate test results. The computer software with its irreplaceable
superiority and its powerful data analysis and processing power can make up for
these shortcomings, so the design of observation test software is very important.
People’s observation is not innate, but in the latter part of learning and training in
practice, the late learning and practice often take a long process and sometimes have
to pay some unnecessary costs. On the other hand, the observation of the test itself
is a training to improve the process, therefore, in the same system will combine
testing and training, can greatly enhance the efﬁciency of the system and practical
performance.

The Typical Method of Observational Testing
Through the analysis of the deﬁnition of observing power and its determinants, as
well as combining the existing test methods, we selected four relatively wide ranges
of methods as software testing and training methods.
2.1
Bai li tiao yi
A ﬁxed interface is randomly divided into 100 randomly shaped small pieces; each
set a small range of 1–100 random numbers, by detecting the number of subjects
used to ﬁnd the time to determine the quality of its observation.
The speciﬁc situation is shown in Fig. 1. This method focuses on the observation
of the speed and breadth of the observed two qualities, the use of subjects on the
understanding of the laws of digital logic and observes the speed and breadth of
things to be tested.
132
J. Wu et al.

2.2
Huo yan jin jing
The subjects observed a number of test images within a certain range to ﬁnd a
different picture of all the test pictures that were slightly different from the others.
By calculating the subjects completed a series of reactions to determine the time
spent watching its good or bad, the speciﬁc situation shown in Fig. 2. This method
focuses on the observation of the speed and breadth of the observed two qualities,
the use of the color and line combination of the differences in understanding to
observe the picture, and to respond. We can use the reaction time to quantify the
level of observation of the subject.
2.3
The Public to Find Him
Set the two batches of pictures, the second batch of pictures in the ﬁrst batch of
pictures on the basis of some minor adjustments (for example, the picture on the
1–3 picture content replaced with other forms), so that subjects observed a picture

of the ﬁrst picture Time, and then converted into the second batch of pictures. By
calculating the accuracy of the subjects to adjust the identiﬁcation and completion
of a series of reactions to determine the time required for observation of good or
bad. The speciﬁc situation is shown in Figs. 3 and 4. This method on the subjects
observed the speed, breadth and accuracy of the three qualities are reﬂected, the
main use of people to observe the degree of sophistication, comprehensiveness and
speed to be measured.

Excellence
Set up a complex pattern composed of triangles, and let the subjects count the
number of all the triangles, and according to the number of triangles and the
reaction time to measure the level of their observation, the speciﬁc situation is
shown in Fig. 5/RTI & gt; This method focuses on the quality of observation
accuracy, but also reﬂects the speed of this quality. The use of people in the
observation of things when the degree of sophistication and the speed of conversion
between different objects to be intuitive to quantify.

If the above method is realized by software, it not only can improve the efﬁciency
of testing and training, but also can effectively avoid the waste of resources. For the
design of software, we have the spirit of science, practical, broad principles, as well
as multi-functional, modular requirements, and strive to comprehensive and
focused. Software design process is shown in Fig. 5.

Research on the Test of Human Attention
Hongyan Ou, Guopeng Xiao, Zhibing Pang, Hui Gu, Runfeng Hou
and Genhua Qi
Abstract Attention is an important psychological index of human; it can affect
people’s work, life and so on. The present analysis of attention test is mainly in
various laboratories, and the testing equipment is so expensive and complex that it
cannot be commonly used. Analyzing the attention theory and exploring a simple
method can effectively ﬁx this kind of circumstance. This paper was written from
the basic concept of attention, analyzed the developing bottleneck of attention
testing and combined the methods of digital newspaper reading and ﬁnding the little
balls. It can scientiﬁcally test the attention and also improve the testing measure-
ments. The principles and measurements in this paper have positive meanings of the
development of attention testing.

Introduction to Attention
Attention refers to the person’s mental activity on a certain object orientation and
concentration and is accompanied by a sense of perception, memory, thinking,
imagination and other psychological processes of common psychological charac-
teristics. There are two basic characteristics of attention, one is directed, refers to
the psychological activities of a selective reﬂection of some phenomena and leaves
the rest of the object, and the second is the concentration of mental activity, to
remain in the selected object on the intensity or tension. Directivity manifests itself
as the choice of multiple stimuli that occur at the same time. Concentration
manifests itself as suppression of interference stimuli [1]. Usually stability, breadth,
distribution, transfers of these four qualities as a measure of a person’s attention to
good or bad signs.

141

1.1
The Stability of Attention
People in a certain period of time, relatively stable, focus on a particular object and
the ability of activities. Usually people with good attention are less susceptible to
external environmental stimuli.
1.2
The Breadth of Attention
The size of the range of attention to which the person is aware of, or the number of
objects perceived by [2], an instant in time. Studies have shown that within a
second, the average person can notice four to six letters, ﬁve to seven unconnected
numbers and three to four unconnected geometries.
1.3
Attentions to the Distribution
The ability of an individual is to distribute his or her attention evenly across
activities in a variety of activities. For example, people can work while chatting,
while listening to music, while writing and so on. In the case where the type of the
target of interest is not very complex, it is possible to do so while paying attention
to a plurality of objects.
1.4
The Transfer of Attention
The ability of a person is to be proactive, purposeful and timely adjust attention
from one activity or object to another activity or object. For example, students with
good attention transfer can quickly adjust from the entertainment state to the
learning state. The speed of attention transfer is a ﬂexible expression of thinking
and the basic guarantee for the judgment of rapid processing information formation.

The Impact of Enhancing Human Attention
in the Testing Software
With the development of society and the continuous improvement of the level of
productivity, as well as a variety of high-tech content and the introduction of
high-precision productivity tools, job skills and career adaptability has now become
social workers in the entry into the post began to focus on two aspect. Such as
142
H. Ou et al.

telephone dispatcher, precision instrument operator, simultaneous interpretation,
etc., need to focus on the work of a high degree of concentration, therefore, such
personnel in the job selection and distribution, only the attention of good or bad
included in the selection or Is the selection criteria to reduce unnecessary trouble in
the future. However, attention to the selection of this one, whether it is the degree of
emphasis or test methods are very lacking, therefore, to strengthen the attention of
the software test is very important.
2.1
Solve the Problem of Difﬁcult Scientiﬁc Personnel
Selection Test
In the past, people in the need for attention to a high degree of concentration of
work to choose and allocate, more of their own preferences, ﬁrst impressions,
experience as the basis, very little attention through the test to aid selection and
selection, but also due to The limitations of the traditional concept, the test useless
and the additional burden of the point of view of the implementation of the attention
test, as the early development of psychological tests encountered obstacles. This is
the root cause of the inability to test. On the other hand, with the cultural level of
managers at all levels to improve, part of the business unit or individual depart-
ments of the army has begun to focus and related capabilities into the selection of
special post selection process. However, the existing professional test system is
bulky, expensive, debugging and maintenance is also very difﬁcult, only suitable
for scientiﬁc research, for factories and enterprises, as well as military grass-roots
units such as job selection is clearly inappropriate. Which has become the main
reason why the test selection cannot be carried out? Therefore, the scientiﬁc
attention to solve the problem of selection is particularly important.
2.2
To Solve the Problem of Attention Training
Attention as a psychological indicator can be improved by the late exercise [3].
Some of the speciﬁc positions of staff in the long-term work, the level of their
attention will be increased, in their positions due to inattention caused by a
corresponding reduction in accidents; in fact, the workload of these personnel in the
accumulation process, Attention has also been tempered. However, in the
post-exercise, if the error is bound to pay more or less the price, or even a mistake is
likely to cause a major accident, this accumulation of experience through mistakes,
although effective, but the cost of higher costs. Assuming that we include the
attention test in the selection process and then focus on the speciﬁc attention of such
personnel training, through training so that their attention can be improved, which
to some extent, reduce the incidence of their entry just when In addition, for those
Research on the Test of Human Attention
143

who have been in such positions, can still be trained to further improve their
attention and reduce the incidence of accidents. When we do the attention test, it is
an attention exercise. Therefore, while studying the methods and means of the
attention test, the training method of attention also comes into being, only need to
make some changes in the pattern can be.
2.3
To Solve the Problem of Low Efﬁciency of Staff
Evaluation
In the past a long time, various research team or the need for such attention testing
units in the continuous exploration of the creative way to put forward some of the
attention of the test method, in the way of carding demonstration process, We found
some common problems: First, a considerable part of the lack of test methods of
experimental demonstration, more common in some practical application units;
Second, the vast majority of tests are written in the face of the measured staff,
organizational procedures cumbersome, content information Small amount, high
repetition rate, the effect is not obvious; Third, in the ﬁnal score statistics and
standard-setting process, the lack of a complete system and theoretical basis.
To solve these problems, we will simplify the authority of the test means, and
then obtained through the demonstration for the public after the test method,
through the test sampling to develop more scientiﬁc evaluation criteria. Combined
with the development of current technology, we design test software. The use of
computer software information capacity and functional integration of the charac-
teristics of the test, training, performance statistics and other functions together to
effectively avoid too much manpower and material waste, to achieve safe, efﬁcient,
economic and scientiﬁc testing purposes.
2.4
For the Follow-up Study to Provide Data Support
“Big Data” era, information as a basis for data analysis is extremely important, is a
potential, considerable wealth, therefore, everyone, every test is a collection of
information, when this amount of information is large enough for the analyst of the
attention of the psychological indicators of great signiﬁcance.
In addition, there are many psychological indicators, including reaction, obser-
vation, memory, etc., therefore, attention to the methods and software architecture
also applies to other aspects of the study. 3 Attention test method.
After combing and demonstrating the current professional and popular attention
methods, we selected two simple methods of attention testing, which are suitable
for the needs of the general public, and expanded and innovated on the original
basis, which increased the difﬁculty of testing. The level of testing.

Digital Enrollment
This method is based on our reference Schulte grid. Schulte grid is the world’s most
simple, most effective and most scientiﬁc attention training method. Is a square card
drawn on the 1 cm  1 cm of the 25 squares, each box has a different number from
1 to 25, training, asked the subjects with their ﬁngers in order of 1–25 in order to
point out its Position [4], the number of ﬁnished 25 number of the shorter time, the
higher the level of attention. The details are shown in Fig. 1.
In order to distinguish between levels, we set three different test difﬁculties: The
ﬁrst level, by a simple one digit into three digits, increasing the difﬁculty of this
method on the attention of the four qualities is reﬂected. The speciﬁc situation is
shown in Fig. 2.
The second level is based on the ﬁrst level to increase visual interference, by
changing the background to increase the interference. Focusing on attention to the
stability and distribution. The speciﬁc situation is shown in Fig. 3.
The third level is to increase the auditory disturbance, that is, on the basis of the
second level through the headset on the number of air intelligence reading, in the
ﬁnal test time and ﬁll out the accuracy of the ﬁgures to judge.
In the selection of training mode, the staff can freely choose the difﬁculty; you
can also adjust the number of squares.
2.6
Find the Ball
This method uses three cups of the same shape and a ball; ﬁrst let the subjects noted
that the ball into one cup, and then continue to change the location of paper cups,
and ﬁnally by the subjects pointed out that the location of the ball. And the
judgment was made by ﬁve times of accuracy and time. This is a simple but very

After a series of tests, we need to count the data and then through the organization
of a large number of personnel to carry out tests to develop the corresponding
criteria for the analysis in order to facilitate the latter and set the necessary training
cycle quantiﬁcation table.
3.1
Data Statistics
The statistical data include the personal information of testers and the data of test
and training. The personal information of the subjects includes age, place of origin,
length of service; test and training data include time, accuracy, error rate. For the
results obtained through system testing or training, use the database for storage,
easy to use later.
3.2
Standard-Setting
The development of standards requires some data support. By testing some of the
sampled personnel, using the principle of statistics, the original results into a status
of magnitude [5], which reﬂects the measured results of a test staff in the position of
all the measured results. The development of standards is conducive to more
accurate selection of personnel.
3.3
Quantiﬁcation of Training Results
Personnel in the training of the results obtained is not useless, by the staff within a
cycle of training to quantify the results, and then use the intuitive statistical chart,
you can clearly see the effectiveness of personnel training in a certain stage.

Conclusions
Our research on people’s attention testing aims to solve the scientiﬁc and complete
set of systems applicable to the needs of the general public. The method is simple
and versatile and provides the import and export of data and provides an important
data for future research. Source. However, we also have some shortcomings in the
research process, such as the standard formulation is not very strict, the function of

of Psychological Personality
Test in Our Army
Chenhui Li, Junyin Zhang, Zhengxiong Hu, Xiaofei Zhai,
Hualiang Xu and Zhibing Pang
Abstract As a necessary and important mean of the psychological research, psy-
chological test is valued by more and more people. As one important item in it,
psychological personality test also be highly valued. During the modernization of
our army, the psychological personality test attracts great attention. Meanwhile, the
relative system and institution are being well developed, some part of which even
made gratifying achievements. But compared with foreign and civilian, gaps still
exist. The thesis illustrates and discusses the application of psychological person-
ality test and some existing problems. Finally the thesis expounds some of my
suggestions towards these existing problems. Hope our psychological personality
test related construction can be more formal, more orderly, and play a bigger role in
raising combat effectiveness.
Keywords Psychological personality test  Military training  Current situation
As a necessary and important means of the psychological research, psychological
test is valued by more and more people [1]. Through the psychological science
method and means, psychological test focus on the psychological characteristics
reﬂected in the people’s activity, giving reference, quantitative analysis and cor-
responding guidance, which is based on the relative principles. Since the psycho-
logical test pioneer, British biologist and psychologists Galton, Psychological test
have been in a constant development and progress. Until now, it has played a
guiding and objective role in talents selecting, post ofﬁce and mental health edu-
cation. The army is a special group because of its high stress in management, urgent
time schedule, heavy tasks and great psychological pressure, which make it more
urgent for soldiers to take the psychological test [2]. With the development of these
years, the psychological test in our army made gratifying achievements under the
enormous demand. Personality test is an important content of psychological test,

and here I will research application status and problems of the psychological per-
sonality test in our army, comparing with the foreign study. Then analyze and
explore on these questions and put forward my personal points.

The Application Overview of Psychological Personality
Test in Our Army
Now, psychological problems also has been increasing gradually. Our army
advocate putting people ﬁrst, paying attention to the training and use of people,
carrying forward humanistic spirit, and keeping close to the mental health of sol-
diers, which give rise to the sound development of our psychological test.
1.1
Preliminary Establish the Psychological Selection
System of Soldier
To promote our army transform from the mechanization to informatization, the
most fundamental and urgent way is to improve the quality of ofﬁcers and soldiers,
including the psychological quality. The good psychological quality is one of the
most important aspects of the battle effectiveness, and is the necessary quality to
transforming soldier in the new development stage of the new century. Since the
1980s, our leaders have encouraged scientiﬁc research institutes to establish a set of
military psychological selection standard in order to improve the scientiﬁc level of
soldier selecting and appointment [3]. Our army have preliminary established
psychological selection system of military, which made the re-inspection qualiﬁed
rate of our recruits jumped to 99%. What’s more, it makes psychological quality
test results become a part of the comprehensive evaluation, and a factor of talent
selection and appointment for the ofﬁcers and soldiers.
1.2
The General Use of the International Mainstream
Inventory
Psychology has been developed for more than a century since the nineteenth
century. During these time, there appeared many masters of psychology and the
corresponding psychological theory and works, as well as different kinds of the
psychological test. Through the practice and the selection, there comes out some
psychological test, being the international general inventory.

1.2.1
The Cattell’s 16 Personality Factor
16PF, called the Cattell’s 16 personality factor, is one of the most perfect psy-
chological test tool in the world. The scale is founded by professor Cattell, based on
his 16 kinds of personality theory. Because of its good reliability and validity and
result, this scale is admired throughout the world. Now the scale has developed into
ﬁve versions: A, B, C, D, E. Among them, A and B version are the completed
version, including 187 projects; C and D are the parted version, each including 106
projects; E version is adjusted to the starters, who have a low level of culture,
including 128 projects. At present, the applicant in this aspect of our country is the
Chinese version and the normal model of Liao Ning Province revised in 1981 by
S. Li of the Liao Ning Province Training section. As for our army, there are also
some regions using the Chinese soldier normal model formulated in 2007 by
G. Yang of the Third Military Medical University.
1.2.2
The Evaluation Questionnaire of the Cattell’s 16 Personality
Factor
The 15FQ+ ﬁrstly published by the British PSYTECH international Ltd is similar to
the16PF, both of which are based on the theory of professor carter’s 16 personality
factors. The main difference between 15FQ+ and 16PF is that the latter takes the
“intelligent” intelligence factors as one of 16 basic personality traits in question-
naire. The former consider that there should be time limit in the standard intelli-
gence tests, otherwise the result would not be accurate. Contrary, the 16PF test
doesn’t have time limit, so it is changed to “metacognitive personality variables”,
namely the individual mastery of their intelligence and trust degree, called “intel-
lectual assessment”. In 2015, Z. Yang of the Fourth Military Medical University
take it as his master’s research, carrying out a deeply upgraded research based on
the previous effort.
1.2.3
Eysenck’s Personality Questionnaire
The questionnaire is designed by the British psychologist, H.J Eysenck, based on
his theory of the personality dimensions and is a self-report questionnaire. Because
of its high reliability and validity, it received a high praise in the world from its
establishment in 1975, and at present it becomes one of the most widely used
questionnaire in the area of judiciary, medicine, education, and counseling.
Meanwhile Eysenck professor also constantly improve and upgrade it, and in 1985
complete the adult version of the revised Eysenck’s personality questionnaire scale
(EPQ-RS).

The Professional Psychological Workers in the Service
of Grassroots Increase Gradually
At present a lot of military colleges and universities have opened the professional
courses such as soldier’s psychology, soldier’s psychological counseling, soldiers
psychological services. And many universities, including the Fourth Military
Medical University, have a lot of psychology graduated students or even doctoral
students. Usually they undertake the responsibility of cultivating psychological
service personnel at the grass-roots level. In addition, we also actively communicate
with the civilian, and invite the psychological experts and professors to guide, and
ask civil professional institutions help to implement psychological test. Besides, our
army also organize the backbone to study in civil professional institution. In this
way, our army colleges cultivate more professional talents and master more
resources to communicate with civil.

The Application Problems of Psychological Test in Our
Military System
The integrated construction of psychological test system in our army has experi-
enced great changes and has initially formed the relevant institutional mechanisms.
2.1
The System Is not Complete, Lack of Supporting
Facilities
Our psychological test and ﬁle based system development imbalance, construction
is not comprehensive. For pilots, ping jockey, drivers, other special post personnel
test and archives management are relatively mature, but for other creatures as well
as military ofﬁcers is still in the exploratory stage, the relevant system construction
is not perfect. In U.S. military, for example, in “the classiﬁcation of the military
professional” according to the behavior characteristics of the army divide into 276
jobs [4], every job has set speciﬁc psychological requirements. Equipped with
advanced psychological evaluation electronic platform, established the perfect
soldier psychological archives. Implements the psychological test for the devel-
opment of the ofﬁcers and soldiers. And our psychological test results comparing
with the post title, post didn’t establish correct contact and leaves a psychological
test as the skeleton, formalism. Second psychological test related supporting
facilities is not complete, no computer unit can only use print, no software unit has
a computer, a software unit has no professional operation, even if have a profes-
sional operation, psychological ﬁles establish dragged on, update slowly. And the
test results are on the shelf, as no basis, did not play its proper role.
152
C. Li et al.

2.2
Psychological Research is Insufﬁcient, the Inefﬁciency
of Test
At present, psychological test in current research level and scale is relatively lack,
the existing number of psychological tests available, the category is not complete,
and the lack of originality and aboriginality, more copy and improvement on other
countries’ scholars research results, the lack of internationally renowned psychol-
ogy, famous psychologists. On average every 130,000 people in China have a
psychology researchers “for imbalances in” is more awkward, for our army situa-
tion is more worse, China’s ﬁve major psychology department no one in our
colleges and universities, and even if a unit or organization is studied, the results of
the study will not be immediately applied to the troops. As a result, our troops today
even with conditions of psychological test forces use test version of questionnaire
was at least ten years ago, the fruits of the reform and opening in China shocked the
world, the change of the domestic, natural psychological change is huge, and so the
test can’t meet the requirements of due.
2.3
Aimed at the Lack of Test Characteristics of Soldier
In the case of 16PF including our army in our country now is being used in 1981
revised edition. This version is based on the national people’s revised for measuring
object, norm is established for Liao Ning province people’s sampling [5]. But the
truth is, no matter the frontier, island, plateau, south, north, west, our country
territory is broad, how can the result of only one province on behalf of the nation,
moreover, in addition to the region, and in the same area in different units, different
positions, different responsibilities of psychological characteristics is different. Our
army for this “a medicine to cure all ills” needs to develop diverse “drug” to “suit
the remedy to the case”. In addition, our army in psychological research has focused
on the civilian, including college students, civil servants, employees, etc., but for a
speciﬁc group of soldier special research is not enough, so the questionnaire of
military feature is not clear, lack of pertinence.

Some Suggestions for the Practical Application
of Psychological Test of Our Army
3.1
Consummating the Psychological Selection of Military
System
According to the current development and the situation of the military psycho-
logical selection system now use effect, improve the military psychological

selection system plays an important role in the optimization of the combat effec-
tiveness of the armed forces division and enhance of ﬁghting capacity. I think we
should do this for improving the psychological selection of military system.
3.1.1
Optimization of Selection Methods to Ensure the Measurement
Science
Psychological results on the basis of psychological test is the beginning of the
psychological selection of military system and foundation, decided the following
implementation process. So must be scientiﬁc, careful and accurate. Requires each
scientiﬁc research unit, institute to study earnestly, careful summary, took out a set
of suitable for China’s national conditions, the condition of the people, its scientiﬁc
selection method.
3.1.2
Determine the Selection Standard, Reasonable Sorting
The psychological selection system of U.S. military in the army according to the
behavior characteristic has carried on the careful classiﬁcation for the professional
positions, which is divided into 276 jobs, and psychological selection have clear
standards in each position. We should learn from American practice, and all the
four armed services, including a number of units. Each has different tasks, features,
and different psychological characteristics. So we need to have a detailed analysis
of each position, and strict classiﬁcation, and serious conclusion, and lay down
appropriate psychological selection criteria for different positions.
3.1.3
Clear the Selection System, Achieves “Follow Law”
Based on the above, the military psychological selection system must be in our
army’s ofﬁcial rules, and even doctrine regulation. Must let the system to implement
in the army to make psychological test work earnestly and be institutionalized.
3.2
Optimization of Cooperation and Exchange System
Our psychological test has two important defects now. First, psychological test
scale of old, poor adaptability, and test effect is poor; Second, psychological
archives management is” ﬁghting the enemy separately”, the lack of sharing,
consistency and continuity. To solve these two problems have to strengthen the
cooperation and communication [6]. First of all to improve scale, should strengthen
the communication among authoritative research unit and research units at the
grass-roots level and grassroots units. Authoritative research unit that can improve
154
C. Li et al.

existent scale is less, but each basic unit is complex, and has different character-
istics, for different units need to be improved accordingly, so the scale improved
workload is so big that it’s not feasible to depend on a handful of authority unit, and
we need to communicate actively with grassroots research unit. In addition, it is
necessary to strengthen the communication between the basic research units and the
grassroots units, especially the communication between professional psychology
workers and basic unit of psychological backbone. In this way can help the research
unit at the grass-roots level grasp the need and the feature of the grassroots units,
and then do concrete operation. Besides we need record the usage of the grassroots
units and communicate with authority and form the feedback mechanism of psy-
chological research. So that can we form a closed loop of study.
3.3
Complete Professionals Gap
3.3.1
Widen the Talent Cultivate Path
According to the goal of psychological service talented person troop construction,
we must stick to the civil-military integration and open channels, and take many
kinds of ways and measures to make full use of various advantageous resources,
optimizing cultivation, and strive to build the psychological service personnel
training pattern, combined with forces training, military and local introduction of
complementary. Military colleges should play a master role in talent training. Also,
it must complete task of talent training according to concrete training, teaching, and
teachers of different type of military colleges and the different needs of psycho-
logical services; each unit should make good use of the unit’s psychological service
human resources, and also use the professional strength of other units through the
way of explaining and giving a lesson by professional psychologist or psychiatrist
for satisfactory completion of psychological backbones in basic unit; With the help
of social forces, it’s a powerful measure to increase the introduction of local pro-
fessionals for strengthening the construction of military psychological service
personnel. Through the civil-military integration mechanism at all levels and social
forces to aid, to do a good job of the introduction of local professionals.
3.3.2
To Perfect Management and Use
People is the basis of all activities, but must not only quantity over quality, for
personnel management and use must be regular and orderly. First of all, through the
personnel qualiﬁcation, increase the degree of talent specialization; Secondly, by
the clear responsibility, ensure all kinds of people do their own job; Finally, take
incentive measures to improve the efﬁcient use of talent management. Our psy-
chology talents team will be a normal and orderly, capable team, and play the
proper even extraordinary effect.

Conclusion
According to the report, the most important factor in the war is the soldiers, which
attaches great signiﬁcance to psychological test. The psychological test system still
has many problems, but there is no denying that the construction of psychological
system of our country has underwent considerable development, including the
medical ﬁeld, education, business, organization department and the justice
department. I am sure that with the quick development of the psychological test, the
construction of psychological test of military system will achieve a higher level and
beneﬁts the military ofﬁcers and soldiers as soon as possible.

Design of Human Reaction Time
Testing System
Honglei Li, Yibo Zhang, Hui Gu, Zhibing Pang, Hongyan Ou
and Cheng Jin
Abstract To solve the existing reaction time test tools’ problems that the test kind
and test scheme is single, the stimulus signal is inﬂexible, and the evaluation
method is not reasonable, and meet the reaction time data collection needs of
different personnel selection, a general test system for human reaction time is
proposed. Considering synthetically the characteristic that the reaction time data
collection needs of different personnel selection is different, this test system pro-
vides the custom function of the test scheme and the stimulus signal based on
modular software design ideas. The human reaction time test system which is
proposed in this paper is able to offer the reaction time data collection tool support
for different personnel selection and is versatile and universal for different personnel
selection.

Instruction
Reaction time means the temporal duration between stimulus and response, also
called response latency. The traditional reaction time test systems are always the
hardware platforms based on the single-chip microcomputer [1, 2]. Because the test
equipment is expensive, the process of operating and supporting is complex, and
the time of testing is long, so reaction time testing is always used in the kinematics
experiment [3] and the elite selection [4]. With the development of computer
technology, many reaction time test software gradually appears on the market [5].
Due to the features of reliable method, stable result and good reproducibility, the
reaction time test system based on computer technology shows a bright application
prospect. The existing reaction time test tools have some problems, such as the test
kind and test scheme is single, the stimulus signal is inﬂexible, and the evaluation

method is not reasonable, especially the tools could only have a simple reaction
time test on auditory reaction time. The existing tools are not convenient for dif-
ferent
professional
application.
Therefore,
developing
a
full-function
and
easy-using reaction time computer comprehensive test system has practical sig-
niﬁcance. A reaction time comprehensive test system applying to all kinds of
personnel selection for different features of different personnel selection needs is
proposed in this paper.

Overall Design of System
2.1
System Requirements Analysis
Reaction time includes simple reaction time and complex reaction time, and
complex reaction time includes discrimination reaction time and choice reaction
time. Simple reaction time is the minimum interval between the presence of a single
stimulus and the single responses of a testee. Discrimination reaction time is that
there are two or more different stimulus displays, and the testee only gives a
response for the appointed stimulus display and without response for the others.
Choice reaction time tasks require distinct responses for each possible class of
stimulus.
Different professionals have different working environment and operation
speciﬁcation, so they have different needs of reaction time. For example, the simple
auditory reaction time of gunshot of an outstanding race athlete must meet a certain
standard to ensure he can fast breaking, and the discrimination reaction time and
choice reaction time of a driver must meet a certain standard to ensure he can do
appropriate reactions when something (man, animal, etc.) suddenly appears.
Therefore, a general human reaction time test system must have following
functions: First, it can measure both simple reaction time and complex reaction time
and offer the customization function of random combination testing program
according to the demand of users. Second, stimulus signals should contain light,
sound and pattern, and the test system should offer the edition and customization
function of stimulus signals according to the demand of users. Finally, it should
have the function of performance statistical analysis.
2.2
Overall Structure of a Human Reaction Time
Test System
Test system contains simple reaction time testing, discrimination reaction time
testing, choice reaction time testing and management and maintenance module, as
shown in Fig. 1.
158
H. Li et al.

Design of Function Module
3.1
Simple Reaction Time Test
The testee must hold the mouse by dominant hand, wear headphones and look at the
screen horizontally before a test. And the test procedure is as follows:
Step one: Click the start button by left mouse button to start a test. According to
the test scheme setting, the system will produce the occurrence time of
the ﬁrst stimulus signal randomly. Turn to Step two.
Step two: The stimulus signal (light, sound and pattern) is showed, and when
testee receives it, he clicks the left mouse button immediately to ﬁnish
one time test. The testee’s reaction time will be recorded, and the
occurrence time of the next stimulus signal will be produced by the test
system. Turn to Step three.
Step three: Repeat Step two, until testee has ﬁnished the setting test number of
times. Turn to Step four.
Step four: Finish the whole test. The system calculates and shows the testee’s score.
3.2
Discrimination Reaction Time Test
The testee must hold the mouse by dominant hand, wear headphones and look at the
screen horizontally before a test. And the test procedure is as follows:

Step one: Click the start button by left mouse button to start a test. According to
the test scheme setting, the system will produce a group (two or more)
stimulus signals and the occurrence time of the ﬁrst stimulus signal
randomly. Turn to Step two.
Step two: The stimulus signal is showed. The testee judges immediately whether
it is the signal of response when he receives the stimulus signal. If yes,
the testee clicks the left mouse button immediately to ﬁnish one time
test, otherwise no response. The testee’s reaction time will be recorded,
and the occurrence time of the next stimulus signal will be produced.
Turn to Step three.
Step three: Repeat Step two, until testee has ﬁnished the setting test number of
times. Turn to Step four.
Step four: Finish the whole test. The system calculates and shows the testee’s score.
3.3
Choice Reaction Time Test
The testee must put three ﬁngers (right hand: index ﬁnger, middle ﬁnger and ring
ﬁnger. Left hand: ring ﬁnger, middle ﬁnger and index ﬁnger) on the “left,” “up” and
“right” three direction keys, wear headphones and look at the screen horizontally
before a test. And the test procedure is as follows:
Step one: Click the start button by left mouse button to start a test. According to
the test scheme setting, the system will produce a group of three
stimulus signals and the occurrence time of the ﬁrst stimulus signal
randomly. Turn to Step two.
Step two: The stimulus signal is showed, and when testee receives stimulus
signal, he clicks appropriate key (the relationship between keys and
stimulation has been explained in the test instruction) to ﬁnish one time
test. The testee’s reaction time will be recorded, and the occurrence
time of the next stimulus signal will be produced. Turn to Step three.
Step three: Repeat Step two, until testee has ﬁnished the setting test number of
times. Turn to Step four.
Step four: Finish the whole test. The system calculates and shows the testee’s score.
3.4
Process of Preemptive Response and Wrong Response
Only the correct operation’s response time could show the test’s true procedures, and
the reaction time data can be valid [6]. So, to ensure the correctness of testee’s
response and avoid preemptive response and other wrong responses, some measures
are implemented as follows: First, the stimulus signal’s occurrence time of temporal
160
H. Li et al.

duration is produced randomly to avoid the stimulate signal’s occurrence time is
predicted by the testee. Second, once testee has preemptive response or wrong
response, the whole test must be done again in order to make testee pay more attention.
3.5
Management and Maintenance
3.5.1
Management of Stimulus Signal
The stimulus signal which is saved in the database can be customized and edited by
users according to their test needs. The management of stimulus signal has two
functions: First, the stimulus signal can be choose freely by users from the database.
Second, the stimulus signal can be edited or updated by users according to the
users’ needs.
3.5.2
Management of Testing Scores
Method of Score Calculation
Jinzhou Yuan [7] had a ﬁnding: The best test time for reaction time test is 20–30,
and the reaction time’s reliability can reach 0.97 which is be calculated by get the
average value of the remainder data by removing 5 maximum values and 5 mini-
mum values. It is perfect for athletes and other elites’ selection. However, from the
perspective of economy, it is deﬁcient if used on the large-scale testing like national
physique monitoring, because of too many testing times, too much time consuming
and too much resource. Xuemei Sun [8] had a ﬁnding: A rather better
cost-effectiveness test times is 10 for the large-scale testing, and the reaction time’s
reliability can reach 0.93 which is calculated by getting the average value of the
remainder data by removing 3 maximum values and 3 minimum values.
Therefore, considering generality, the system proposed in this paper adopts the
method of self-setting testing times and sampling data to calculate testing scores.
Output Scores
Considering the usability of system, the system which has the scores display
function, the scores statistical analysis and the function of scores export to Excel is
convenient for different staff types.
3.5.3
Management of Staff Information
The system offers two staff basic information input ways: One is foreground single
importing; another is background bulk importing by Excel.

Conclusion
For the situation of different demands of different professionals’ reaction time,
designing and developing a general reaction time test system based on the computer
technology, this test system has following features except the function of traditional
reaction time test equipment: First, stimulus signal, which suits different profes-
sionals to have a reaction time test, contains light, sound and pattern and can be
customized according to the demand of users, and the testing results are more
objective. Second, testing program which can test simple reaction time and also
complex reaction time can be customized according to the demand. It solves the
problems such as the lack of present reaction time test tools and the lack of no
customization of stimulus signal and offers tool support for different professional
reaction time test.

Research on National Defense Students’
Frustration Psychology and Its
Management in Pre-service Training
Peng Gong, Zhenguo Mei, Yunqiang Xiang, Chang Mei and Guiqi Liu
Abstract During pre-service training period, since the national defense students
have heavy learning and training tasks, high management standards, and heavy
work and living pressures, they are facing various physical and psychological
challenges. Most of them often feel frustrated, which severely inﬂuences their
working determination and conﬁdence. Therefore, it is of great signiﬁcance to study
the frustration psychology and its management of national defense students in
pre-service training period. After carrying out questionnaire survey and symposia
for some national defense students who are taking pre-service training, this paper
analyzes the concrete manifestation and main causes of their frustration and puts
forward basic solutions from aspects such as educational guidance, psychological
training, and atmosphere construction. The results provide important foundation for
military academies to strengthen the psychological management of national defense
students.

With the accelerating of military talent project, more and more national defense
students join the army and become the new force [1]. Pre-service training is a
critical stage for these students to become qualiﬁed ofﬁcers and plays an important
role in the formation and improvement in their ability. During this period, students
have heavy learning and training tasks, high management standards, and heavy
working and living pressures. They are facing various physical and psychological
challenges, which requires them to have strong anti-frustration ability and good
psychological quality to adapt to the study and life in military academies.

According to our survey on national defense students who have graduated in the
recent ﬁve years, about 82% of them have weak psychological quality and
anti-frustration ability. When they face difﬁculties and challenges in work, they
easily become frustrated, which to some extent affects the completion of their tasks
and future progress. Therefore, in the pre-service training period, it is important for
ofﬁcers at all levels in military academies to pay great attention on students’ psy-
chology, adopt practical measures to help students build good psychological con-
dition and anti-frustration ability, and make students qualiﬁed for military jobs.
1
Manifestations of National Defense Students’
Frustration Psychology
Frustration psychology refers to the psychological condition of people when they
meet obstacles or interference in purposeful activities, and their motivation cannot
be met [2]. The frustration psychology of national defense students in pre-service
training refers to the state of unhappiness and anguish experienced by students, for
they meet obstacles or interference when achieving their motivation [3]. This
unpleasant and depressed inner state will directly produce negative emotional
experience. Some students will have secondary psychological and behavioral
changes, such as retreat, imbalance, or radical behavior, which leads to deviation
and lost in the development of students. If this state is brought to work and life, a
series of chain reactions will appear, which has a direct impact on quality and
efﬁciency of work and the internal harmony and stability in army.
The manifestations of frustration psychology of national defense students in
pre-service training are mainly as follows.
1.1
Antagonistic Psychology for Strict Management
Although national defense students receive paramilitary management in local uni-
versities, their management modes are still largely different from the strict and formal
management in armies. During pre-service training period, every day students need
to have a drill, tide up the dorm, have routine roll call, listen to ofﬁcer’s comments,
and ask for permission every time when they leave the barrack. Strict management
places many restrictions on these students and deprives them of much personal time,
which sets physical and psychological challenges for them. In addition, students
cannot use mobile phones and the Internet as they like and have to deal with many
interpersonal relationships in the army. A few students cannot bear all these
restrictions, and some even have antagonistic psychology instead of their original
excitement and pride feelings. They are frustrated, have no spirit and motivation for
study and training, and may even feel bewildered with their future life in army.
166
P. Gong et al.

1.2
Anxiety for Strict Training
National defense students are both college students and reserve military ofﬁcers.
They study in universities like normal students, but they also need to receive special
military trainings. Take Guizhou University as an example; national defense stu-
dents participate in physical ﬁtness training every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday
evening. They also have 10 days of training in winter holiday and real army
experience in summer holiday, yet these are only practices. The competitive and
high-intensity training during pre-service period make students realize the gap
between qualiﬁed soldiers and themselves. They very much lack military skills,
cannot perform standardized tactical actions, and have poor combat skills, and some
even fail to follow the basic commands. Students are not clear about the require-
ments for military positions and tasks and thus may become anxious. They are
spiritless and depressed, and some even feel hopeless and act recklessly. Such
anxiety appears because students feel that their abilities cannot meet the demands of
future positions.
1.3
Escape Psychology for Hard to Achieve Goals
Most students can successfully switch their roles from students to reserve military
ofﬁcers and have clear cognitions about themselves. They can adapt to pre-service
training and are eager to exploit their own advantages in the army. But a few students
are too optimistic and idealistic about army life. Some want to perform excellent in
study, some want to join the party, some want to win more merit and praise, while
some want to fully show their abilities and get good positions after graduation. Their
expectations are good, yet competition is ﬁerce, and students may not always get
what they want. There are always some people that cannot achieve their goals. This
makes many students dispirited, and there appears escape psychology.
2
Analysis on the Causes of Frustration Psychology
Analyzing students’ psychological condition, we can see that both objective and
subjective factors cause their frustration psychology.
2.1
Particular Personal Development Experience
Individual psychological factor has the main inﬂuence on a person’s psychology.
Under the same circumstance and facing the same difﬁculty, different people have
Research on National Defense Students’ Frustration Psychology …
167

different reactions, for their characteristics directly affect their behaviors [4]. People
build their personalities during their long-term development. Most national defense
students now are the only child in their families. They are used to the care and love
of others and regard themselves as the most important ones. If they can achieve
their goals or meet their demands, they feel happy and spirited; if not, they easily
become frustrated, blaming the environment or rebelling against the leaders’
command. In one word, this self-centered psychology is one of their common
characteristics.
2.2
Poor Connection Between Local Universities
and Military Academies
After four years of quality education in local universities and since national defense
students get special concern of colleges and armies, most students gain certain skills
when graduating, such as ball games, art performances, news writing, calligraphy,
painting or computer skills. But because they get much attention of others, some
students have weak sense of organization. They are self-centered, have poor
managing ability, value their own interests too much, and cannot bear losses or
criticism. These features are unfavorable for them to become good commanders and
ofﬁcers. After they start to work in military academies, facing the high working
demands, strict managements and ﬁerce competition, their simple life experience
will affect their psychology. They cannot meet their goals; thus, they become
frustrated, self-condemned, and even hopeless. Such a condition will only widen
the gap between the army and students.
2.3
Improper Managing Method of Grass-Roots Ofﬁcers
The improper managing method of ofﬁcers in military academies is also an
important cause for students’ frustration. Some ofﬁcers are used to commanding
and criticizing students and fail to create a fair, interactive atmosphere in man-
agement. Their managing method is too rigid, strict, and punish-centered. Some
ofﬁcers have little patience on students who do not perform well. They hold the idea
that “criticism is the best education,” acting too strict on students, which makes
students feel frustrated and self-abased, losing the conﬁdence and energy to
improve themselves. What is more, some ofﬁcers have poor knowledge about
students’ characteristics, thinking that they are not qualiﬁed enough comparing with
soldiers and ofﬁcers in the army. Some ofﬁcers even have prejudice on students
who are not well adapted to army life or have contradicted them. Their opinions
virtually put heavy pressure on students. Some ofﬁcers are still not familiar with
frustration psychology and the law of students’ psychological activities; thus, they
168
P. Gong et al.

cannot scientiﬁcally explain students’ behaviors led by frustration. They are not
able to stimulate students’ potential or solve students’ psychological problems, so
their management is not targeted and efﬁcient.
3
Solutions to Frustration Management
Having analyzed the main manifestations and causes of frustration psychology,
military academies need to ﬁnd solutions from aspects such as educational guid-
ance, psychological training, and atmosphere construction. Academies should adopt
comprehensive measures to build students’ anti-frustration and psychological
endurance abilities. In this way, students can enjoy a harmonious inner environment
in their development.
3.1
Strengthening Guidance and Building Good
Psychological Quality
National defense students appear to have strong and changeable emotions in
pre-service training. They often go to extremes, get into dead ends in work, and
tend to be depressed, anxious, and unsociable. In this way, we must strengthen
psychological guidance to help students get rid of their negative emotions and
maintain a healthy state of mind. First, we should see to it that our psychological
counseling work can embrace all the aspects in students’ life. We should implement
the instructions in Essentials of Basic Military Construction and carry out the “Two
Advanced” activity (strive to be an advanced party organization and an advanced
party member), guiding students to regulate their moods and keep a balance in mind
when participating in competitions. Second, we should establish and improve our
psychological counseling rooms, making sure the psychological counseling and
testing systems are carried out. When students are facing circumstances such as
enrollment, comprehensive exercise, major task conversion, evaluation awards and
graduation, we need to test their mental conditions and psychological problems in
time, so as to guide them to regulate emotions, overcome psychological barriers,
and gradually eliminate frustration.
3.2
Strengthening Psychological Practices
and Improving Endurance
Psychological endurance refers to the ability of a person to bravely accept the
challenge and be free from behavioral and psychological disorders under pressure
Research on National Defense Students’ Frustration Psychology …
169

[5]. Therefore, it is important to strengthen students’ psychological endurance.
First, we should put psychological training into our teaching and training system.
We need to have scientiﬁc plans and proper arrangements. Students’ psychological
qualities can be cultivated through a series of urgent, difﬁcult, dangerous and heavy
tasks. They can learn to gradually eliminate psychological obstacles and gain
courage and conﬁdence to overcome frustration. Second, through the simulation of
battleﬁeld environment, we reasonably enhance students’ psychological load and
help them build good psychological adaptability, endurance, and ﬁghting and
regulating abilities. Third, grass-roots ofﬁcers should learn to set various psycho-
logical barriers for students and improve the standards and requirements of their
tasks, so as to ensure that all students will face setbacks and difﬁculties. After that,
ofﬁcers should offer guidance in psychological adjustment according to students’
individual responses, efﬁciently helping them overcome frustration and improve
psychological endurance.
3.3
Holding “People-Oriented” Education and Creating
Harmonious Atmosphere
“People-oriented” education means not only caring for, understanding, and
respecting students, but also cultivating their sound personalities, helping them
overcome difﬁculties, and guaranteeing their development. If our students feel they
are respected, they can give full play to their subjective initiatives and work with
good mood. This gives them a sense of achievement and helps avoid frustration
psychology. In this way, armies and military academies should work together to
create a united, harmonious, sound and positive inner atmosphere. Ofﬁcers should
treat each student equally, adhere to lawful and scientiﬁc managing methods,
respect students’ reasonable requirements, enrich their daily life, and try to meet
their demands to pursue advanced culture. At the same time, ofﬁcers need to be fair
in rewards and sanctions, stimulating students’ working and studying enthusiasm.
Only in this way can these students keep good moods, strive for progress in work,
face challenges positively, and minimize the bad inﬂuences of frustration
psychology.
Compliance with Ethical Standards The study was approved by the Logistics Department for
Civilian Ethics Committee of Air Defense Forces Academy. All subjects who participated in the
experiment were provided with and signed an informed consent form. All relevant ethical safe-
guards have been met with regard to subject protection.

Vocational Education on MOOC Platform
Ye Tao, Wenying Xing, Chang Mei, Peng Gong and Leiming Yao
Abstract In recent years, MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) sweeps the world
and becomes a booster for military vocational education which effectively enhance
the education quality. Following the trend, China has established a MOOC platform
called “Dream Course” for military ofﬁcers and soldiers. Analyzing the charac-
teristics of learning behavior of military vocational education on MOOC platform
and giving corresponding suggestions are of great signiﬁcance to promote our
military education. This thesis will ﬁrst elaborate MOOC characteristics and
learning behavior, and then analyze the learning behavior of professional military
study on “Dream Course” from three aspects: users, course learning, and com-
munication and interaction. The thesis also gives suggestions on how to create
quality online courses, improve encouraging mechanism and utilize the platform
innovatively.

Since 2012, with the guidance of Harvard, Stanford and MIT, MOOC (Massive
Open Online Course) has developed rapidly and swept the world. After that, many
universities in China have introduced MOOC platforms [1]. At the same time,
military vocational education, as the continuing education for military ofﬁcers and
soldiers, should follow the world trend of online education and provide practical
courses for students [2]. In this way, being a new educational pattern, MOOC will

become the booster of our military vocational education and effectively enhance our
education quality. Analyzing the characteristics of learning behavior of military
vocational education on MOOC platform and giving corresponding suggestions are
of great signiﬁcance to promote our military education.
1
MOOC Characteristics and Learning Behavior
MOOC is an online teaching model for the public, including children, the elderly,
and people from all walks of life. The core features of MOOC are “mass, online and
open”. “Mass” is reﬂected in two aspects: mass learners and mass courses. More
than tens of thousands of people can log in and study on a MOOC platform at the
same time, and they can choose lots of courses. “Online” means that all the study
activities are held entirely online, and people are free from time and place con-
straints. “Open” means that the course resources are free and open. The public can
easily get access to them [3].
MOOC is quite different from traditional online courses. From the aspect of
production, online open classes and resource sharing classes are actually “class-
room moving” (recording videos of classes), while MOOC is “course moving”. For
example, if traditional online courses can be compared to dramas, they are like
recording the dramas and then play them out. Although certain post-production
work is needed, it is quite simple (editing some pictures, adding subtitles, etc.).
MOOC is like making movies and TV series. Producers need to shoot from dif-
ferent angles and use different shots to show the teaching contents. From the aspect
of learning function, MOOC is not a simple video presentation, but also includes
modules of teaching, learning, training, testing and evaluation. Students learn,
discuss, do homework, have examinations on the platform and ﬁnally get a
certiﬁcate, thus it is a complete learning process [4].
Through distributed online platforms, MOOC is able to carry out teaching,
organization and management in a uniﬁed way, which extends learning space,
enriches learning resources and promotes knowledge sharing and innovation. It
therefore enjoys widespread recognition and praises from both domestic and
international educational organizations.

Analysis of Learning Behavior of Military Vocational
Education on MOOC Platform
The military vocational education can carry out on the basis of domestic, foreign
and intra-army MOOC platforms. At present, there are dozens of MOOC platforms
in all. Udacity, Coursera and EdX are the three most popular foreign MOOC
platforms. “Xuetangx” is the biggest Chinese platform, having 5 military courses,
174
Y. Tao et al.

such as “Introduction of China’s Surrounding 14 Land Neighboring Countries”,
“Military Theory” and “High-tech and Modern Local Area War”. The only
intra-army platform in China is “Dream Course”. By February 2017, the platform
has more than 120 courses. 32,900 people have registered, and nearly 3100 online
examinations have been attended by 36,000 students [5]. Therefore, Dream Course
is the main MOOC platform for military vocational education, and we will take it as
our research object.
The learning behaviors on Dream Course include login, course learning, and
communication and interaction. See Table 1.
2.1
Analysis on the Characteristics of MOOC Users
Viewed from the educational background, 51% users have graduated from “high
schools” and “junior vocational academies”; 19% have graduated from “vocational
colleges; 30% have received bachelor or higher degrees.
Viewed from ages, “post-80s and 90s” have become the main users, accounting
for a total of 84%. Among them, soldiers and noncommissioned ofﬁcers account for
77%.
Viewed from the analysis of user behavior, students are obviously organized to
learn on the platform. We can see the features from the following three aspects:
relatively concentrated registration time; quite concentrated active time, and highly
concentrated course selecting. Users’ active periods often follows their registration
time, and decline rapidly after the courses end. What’s more, most users learn
online from 9:00 to 10:00 am, 3:00 to 4:00 pm, and 7:00 to 8:30 pm. They usually
log in from Monday to Friday during their training time, and few will study online
during weekends.
2.2
Analysis on the Characteristics of Course Learning
Viewed from course selecting situation, the selections are highly concentrated. By
February 2017, the three most selected courses are “Introduction to Multimedia

“Basic

Network
Security
and
Conﬁdentiality” and “Military Physical Fitness”. We can see that users have great
demand on courses about software using, safety regulations and military training.
Viewed from learning duration, few students have ﬁnished the courses. We
divide their studies into four levels by their learning time. If they only ﬁnish 10% of
the course, they have just “experienced the course”; if they ﬁnish 10–50%, they are
called “giving up halfway”; if they ﬁnish 50–90%, they have experienced “selective
study”; only if they ﬁnish more than 90% can they be regarded as “ﬁnishing the
course”. According to our statistics, only 14.8% users have “ﬁnished the course”.
This requires our concerns.
Viewed from ways of participation, most users both watch the videos and upload
their homework. These are the two basic activities on MOOC platform. The pro-
portion they account for can reﬂect users’ participating situation. We will choose
the most popular course “Introduction to Multimedia Design and Production” as an
example and carry out statistical analysis. About 39,000 people take this course. We
use “a” to represent how many times every user has uploaded his or her homework,
and “c” to represent how many times the user has watched the course videos. In this
way “a/a + c” stands for the proportion that the activity of uploading homework
accounts for. If the value of “a/a + c” is 0, it means the user only watches videos; if
the value is c, it means the user only uploads homework. From Fig. 1 we can see
that most users’ (36.4%) values are 0.5, meaning that they both watch videos and
upload homework. The number of users whose values are higher or lower than 0.5
are similar, meaning that their proportions are close.
2.3
Analysis on the Characteristics of Communication
and Interaction
Mass, timely and efﬁcient interaction is a signiﬁcant feature and requirement of
MOOC. Through our analysis on the big data of Dream Course, after the course
questions are released, nearly half of the users will give their ﬁrst response within
5 min, which fully reﬂected the learning enthusiasm of users. The teachers’ ﬁrst

reply usually occurs after 3 h. On the one hand, teachers have many teaching and
research tasks, thus they do not have enough time to respond online. On the other
hand, at present teachers mainly reply by themselves, but many students will ask
questions, and there are no professional teams to support teachers. Therefore, it is
quite difﬁcult for them to reply in time. In addition, some students chat freely or
repeat their questions many times in the Discussion Zone, which affect their
learning effect. We need to ﬁnd some countermeasures to this issue.
3
Suggestions on Improving the Learning Behavior
of Military Vocational Education on MOOC Platform
3.1
Creating Quality Online Courses
The core task now for military vocational education is to develop quality online
courses. To fulﬁll this expectation, we need to change traditional teaching methods,
give full play to “Military Internet +”, and improve the course creating, releasing,
maintenance and upgrading.
First of all, we need to improve our work on course creating and releasing. We
should perfect the micro-course production process and strengthen our overall
design and layout. We also need to communicate with the production team about
the form of teaching and the presentation of micro-course. The whole editing and
releasing process should be ﬁnished on time, so that the online course can meet the
demand of our schedule.
Second, we need to improve course maintenance and upgrades. Teaching staff
should communicate regularly with students through the platform to strengthen the
learning interaction. Network management staff should check the website and
hardware environment. Technical professionals should analyze the learning and
operating situation of courses through data accumulation and statistical analysis.
Third, improve the skill training for online courses. We can consult the staff of
teaching ability development center in professional normal universities, or invite
teachers who have lots of experiences in military vocational teaching to give our
teachers some training, or visit famous universities and military academies and
learn from them.
3.2
Improving Encouraging System
The encouraging system include encouragement to both course producers and
learners.
(1) Encouraging course producers. First, we should to offer material, fund and
technical support to the teaching units which set up military vocational courses,
Analysis of Learning Behavior of Military Vocational Education …
177

and adopt the learning condition of military vocational courses as one of the
requirements in the evaluation of advanced Party branches and teaching units
and the rating of training grade in armies. Second, we should recognize and
reward teachers’ efforts. When Tsinghua University was carrying out MOOC
project, they stipulated that the class hour of MOOC equaled to three times of
their ordinary courses in teachers’ annual evaluation. They also offered special
funds to teams that participated in MOOC for the ﬁrst time and ﬁnancial
support to teams that carried out relevant researches. Once the courses were
successfully released, the university provided three assistants for the team and
gave assistants working subsidies. Third, we should strengthen the exchanges
between teachers and MOOC teams, including seminars, training, teacher’s
salon, special course exchanges, assistant training, teachers’ (assistants’)
Wechat groups, and MOOC competitions. Fourth, we can evaluate and select
the outstanding teachers in military vocational education every year. The
candidates should have good management methods, advanced teaching ideas
and rich experiences. We set them as models of the whole army, and reward
them by promotions and granting higher academic titles.
(2) Encouraging the learners. First, we should ensure the study can be recognized.
Now the National University of Defense Technology gives certiﬁcates to
MOOC learners, but few units give recognition to this certiﬁcates, thus we ned
to solve this problem in future MOOC projects. Second, we should ensure
online discussion is efﬁcient and in time. According to the big data of Tsinghua
University’s “Xuetangx” platform, the number of assistants needed is inversely
proportional to the number of learners, which means fewer assistants are nee-
ded when more students select the course. This is because students mainly learn
from discussion and interaction, and if they cannot get response after 24 h, their
learning initiative will decline. The assistants just help students to continue the
discussion. Therefore, on the one hand, we can place communication and
interaction as a vital part in learning evaluation, and note down users’ interests,
concerns and learning habits through big data as the evidence of evaluation. On
the other hand, we should build an “honesty management system” to avoid
invalid discussion and spams. We can refer to the solutions of foreign platform
Coursera, identifying and supervising users’ behaviors.
3.3
Using the Platform Creatively
In order to improve the effect of education and quality of talents, we give full play
to online platforms by using them innovatively. Through data analysis system, we
can investigate a student’s every click, every learning time and every interaction,
and use big data to analyze students’ learning habits, concerns and common
problems. Through remote video surveillance system and assessment system, we
can build a uniﬁed educational system combining military vocational education,
178
Y. Tao et al.

examination and military training. Through building distributed platform teaching
pattern, we can carry out two-way Q & A discussions, and adopt practices, quizzes,
homework and other activities. We will pay attention to the differences in educa-
tional background between users, and try to meet every user’s individual demand.
Through the course releasing platform we divide users into various learning teams,
asking each team to build an online discussion group, and let users take turns to
upload the discussion result of their team. In this way we can enhance their
cooperation and interaction in learning.

The Inﬂuence of Demographic Variables
on the Emotional Intelligence
and the Mental Elasticity
of Undergraduates
Yu Luo, Xin Peng, Kai Wu, Benjun Liu, Peihua Xu and Yunde Sun
Abstract This article is to ﬁgure out the relationship between the emotional
intelligence and the mental elasticity. Method Three ways are applied to this
research, that is, an online survey using sojump.com, random sampling survey on
undergraduates as well as the SPSS, a software to analyze the relevant ﬁgures.
Result There is an obvious relationship between the emotional intelligence and the
mental elasticity. Conclusion The higher the emotional intelligence is, the better the
mental elasticity is. The nationality, the interpersonal relationship and the partici-
pation of the undergraduates are obviously related to their emotional intelligence
and mental elasticity. The better of their interpersonal relationship is, the higher
their emotional intelligence and the mental elasticity are. The stronger their par-
ticipation is, the higher their emotional intelligence and the mental elasticity are.
Their award-winning experience is related to their optimism. Their tenacity is much
better if they have once took major charge of activities (p = 0.05). The better they
get along well with the opposite sex, the higher their emotional intelligence and the
mental elasticity are.
Keywords Undergraduate  Demographic variables  Emotional intelligence 
Mental elasticity
At present, the research about the emotional intelligence and the mental elasticity of
undergraduates gradually becomes a really hot issue for all walks of life as well as
psychology.
One’s success depends not only on intelligence but also on the inﬂuence of
emotion and mental elasticity [1]. Individuality, family as well as society has a clear
impact on the contemporary undergraduates.
This article focuses mainly on the inﬂuence of every aspect of the demographic

Research Object and Method
1.1
Research Object
The questionnaire is conducted among the undergraduates randomly. A total of 127
completed questionnaires are collected, cutting out the unqualiﬁed ones (for
example, the vacancy of questionnaire is over 10%), and there are 92 valid ques-
tionnaires remaining. In the valid questionnaires, 44 of the participants are males,
while 48 are females; 11 of them are over 25 years old, 74 of them are between 22
and 25 years old, and 7 of them are under 22 years old; 39 of them are single child,
while the number of non-single child is 53.
1.2
Research Method
This study applies EIS [3] (the emotional intelligence scale) and CD-RISC [4] (the
mental elasticity scale of Schuttle, an American psychologist are applied to this
study). The study is conducted in 6 universities of Henan, using sojump.com, an
online questionnaire app and random sampling method. The information of the
demography variables is the most important part of this study, including their age,
gender, politics status, single parent, the schooling of their parents, the income of
the family, the sum of consumption per month, the award-winning experience in the
university, the relationship with the opposite sex and the question whether they took
charge of any important events.
This scale has a very good effect and reliability among the college and secondary
school students and the juvenile offenders.
1.3
Statistic Analysis
All the ﬁgures are analyzed and disposed by SPSS (a statistical analysis software)
and the multiple regression. This study ﬁlls the ﬁgures that are left out in the
emotional intelligence variable. The expectation maximization in the SPSS is used
in the results of all the variables including their average, covariance and the cor-
relation index.

2.3
The Inﬂuence of Personal Factors on the Emotional
Intelligence and the Mental Elasticity
By analyzing the personal factors such as whether they are key staffs, the inter-
personal condition, the award-winning experiences, whether they took charge of
any important events, the relationship with the opposite sex, whether they have a
sweetheart friend, whether they have joined the students union or some organiza-
tions like that, the results of the inﬂuence on the emotional intelligence and mental
elasticity are shown in Table 4.

Conclusion
According to the survey, there is a correlation and signiﬁcance between the every
aspect of the demographic variables and the emotional intelligence and the mental
elasticity. The exact ﬁgures are shown in Table 5.
Above 0.001, there is a clear correlation between the emotional intelligence and
the mental elasticity [5]. The higher the emotional intelligence is, the better the
mental elasticity is. Those who have a higher emotional intelligence are more likely
to have the ability to control and adjust their self mood and have a stronger
endurance capability and frustration resistance. The two aspects have a mutual
impact on one another. Therefore, the conclusion is that the higher they have the
emotional intelligence, the better their mental elasticity is.
The nationality, the interpersonal relationship and the extent of participation of
undergraduates are obviously related to their emotional intelligence and the mental
elasticity. The better their interpersonal relationship is, the higher their emotional
intelligence and the mental elasticity are. No one can live without others. Only by
communicating with others better can one develop a stronger viability. Those with
autism have a bad interpersonal relationship and have a lower frustration resistance.
They cannot deal with the external stimulation, so their emotional intelligence and
the mental elasticity are lower. On the contrary, those with a better interpersonal
relationship have a higher intelligence and mental elasticity.
The more active their participation is, the higher their emotional intelligence and
the mental elasticity are [6]. The experience of having once took charge of some
important events is clearly related to their tenacity (p = 0.05). The better they
get along well with the opposite sex, the higher their emotional intelligence and the
mental elasticity are. Their award-winning experience is related to their optimism. It
is an effective way to develop their ability to adapt to society and to improve
themselves by the participation. The more they took part in the activities, the more
they got in touch with others, the higher their emotional intelligence and the mental
elasticity are.

The Effects of the Micro-Expression
Training on Empathy in Patients
with Schizophrenia

and Xunbing Shen
Abstract Object Studies have shown that patients with schizophrenia had impaired
in empathy, which is important during social interaction. How to improve the
empathy of schizophrenia patients was of practical signiﬁcance. This study used
micro-expression
training
tool
to
improve
the
empathy
in
patients
with
schizophrenia. Methods Experimental group consisted of 24 patients (10 females),
who accepted a completely micro-expression training for 4 times, once a week,
each training last for 1–1.5 h, and the control group consisted of 22 patients (10
females), who merely watched the teaching videos about facial expression for 4
times, each time last for half an hour; and the third group, acted as a baseline,
consisted of 22 patients (10 females), who were not given any intervention. The
scores of empathy at pre-training and post-training were measured by Interpersonal
Reactivity Index (IRI). Results The empathy of experimental group and control
group I had improved, which suggested the training of micro-expression recogni-
tion could improve empathy in patients with schizophrenia.

Introduction
Empathy is the understanding and sharing of emotions of others, which is important
during social interaction and is closely related to social function [1]. Empathy
defects can result in impaired interpersonal and social function in patients. Cohen
et al. [2] proposed that empathy consisted of two aspects, i.e., cognitive empathy
and affective empathy. Accordingly, to improve empathy means to improve the
recognition and understanding of emotions of others.
Bora et al. [3] found that patients with schizophrenia have deﬁcits in empathy.
Montg et al. [4] also found that the cognitive empathy in schizophrenic patients was

signiﬁcantly worse than that of normal subjects, and the emotional empathy,
however, was equal to that of normal subjects. Dirndl et al. [5] proposed that the
both emotional empathy and cognitive empathy in schizophrenic patients had
impaired. Meanwhile, the impaired empathy resulted in the defects in facial
expression recognition [6–8].
Ekman et al. [9] discovered the ﬂeeting micro-expression and developed a
Micro-expression Training Tool (METT) in 2002. Russell et al. [10] used this tool
to investigate the effects of training on the ability of emotion recognition in patients
with
schizophrenia.
The
result
showed
that
the
ability
to
recognize
micro-expression in both schizophrenic patients and normal control group
improved after training.
Based on the aforementioned studies, we hypothesize that the micro-expression
training can improve the empathy for schizophrenic patients. The current study
aimed to test the effectiveness of METT for improving the empathy of patients with
schizophrenia.

Materials and Methods
Patients during the recovery period in Jiangxi Mental Hospital participated in the
experiment, and the inclusion criteria were: (1) Who met the diagnostic standard of
schizophrenia of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth
Edition (DSM-V); (2) who was in the period of recovering, had good compre-
hension, and could perform related tests; and (3) who volunteered to participate in
and signed the informed consent with the family members accompanying. The
exclusion criteria were: (1) The patients’ condition was not stable and who was in
the acute period; (2) those had severe visual or hearing impairment; and (3) who
could not complete the experiment. A total of 68 patients were selected.
2.1
Participants
Sixty-eight patients were randomly divided into experimental group 24 (male 14,
female 10, age 29.50 ± 11.67 year), who accepted a complete training by using
Micro-expression training tool, total 4 times, once a week, each time last for
1–1.5 h; the control group I consisted of 22 patients (male 12, female 10, age
28.09 ± 7.53 year), who merely watched the teaching videos of facial expression
recognition, total 4 times, each time last half an hour; and control group II consisted
of 22 patients (male 12, female 10, age 27.36 ± 9.53 year), who did not accept any
intervention.

2.2
Training Tool
The Chinese version of Micro-expression Training Tool (MEET) was used, which
is based on the Ekman’s METT. The Chinese version METT is divided into 5 parts:
the pretest (used to measure the baseline of ability to recognize facial expressions),
training (teaching videos of facial expression recognition), practice (exercise of
micro-expression recognition with feedback), review (more detailed teaching
videos of facial expression recognition), and posttest (used to measure the
micro-expression recognition ability after the training). There were eight labels of
options: anger, disgust, fear, surprise, happiness, sadness, neutral, and other (not in
the options). There were 3 sub-parts in the pretest: recognizing static facial
expression,
recognizing
artiﬁcial
micro-expression,
and
recognizing
micro-expression videos. There were 2 sub-parts in the posttest, namely recognizing
artiﬁcial micro-expression and recognizing micro-expression videos (the pictures of
facial expression and videos were totally different from those in pretest). The
accuracies were reported by the software at the end of each sub-part.
2.3
Measurement Tool
The Chinese version of Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) was used, which
compiled by Davis [11]. IRI had 28 items which included four factors: perspective
taking (PT), personal distress (PD), empathy concern (EC), and fantasy (FS). The
perspective taking was designed to measure cognitive empathy, and the other three
factors were used to measure emotional empathy. The scale had high reliability and
validity, the internal consistency of the sub-scales was between 0.71 and 0.77, and
the test–retest reliability was between 0.62 and 0.80. The scale also had ideal
discriminant and convergent validity. The score of empathy at pre-training and
post-training was measured by IRI.
2.4
Procedure
With the permit of the director of the department, the participants had been
debriefed by the experimenter. The participants of experimental group indepen-
dently accomplished METT training on a computer. There was a break of 5 min
after each part. IRI was ﬁrstly carried out before the training and was re-tested after
training for 4 times. The participants of control group I merely watched the teaching
videos of expression recognition which were played by the experimenter. Empathy
score was measured by IRI at the beginning and end of video watching. The
participants of control group II got no intervention, and the IRI carried out at the
same time of experimental (only took the IRI test, but did nothing).

The In-group Changes of Empathy
The paired sample t test was used to analyze the gain scores of empathy for each
group. The results showed that there was no signiﬁcant difference in the experi-
mental group. There was, however, a signiﬁcant difference in the control group I

The Inter-group Changes of Empathy
The gains in empathy scores were subjected to a one-way ANOVA. The result
showed that there was a signiﬁcant difference (F = 4.878, p = 0.011, see Fig. 1).
A post hoc analysis of the means of three groups found that there was no signiﬁcant
difference in the paired comparison of experimental group and the control group II,
However, there was a signiﬁcant difference in the paired comparison of experi-
mental group and the control group I (p = 0.015).

results showed there was no difference between pre- and post-training for the
experimental group. There was, however, a signiﬁcant difference in the gain score
of pre- and posttest for the control group I. As shown in Fig. 1, the empathy of both
experimental group and control group 1 was improved (although the gain score of
the experimental group was not signiﬁcant). The results of inter-group comparison
found there was a signiﬁcant difference in the paired comparison of experimental
group and the control group I.
The results suggested that Micro-expression training tool could improve
empathy for patients with schizophrenia. The signiﬁcant difference in the control
group 1 implied that simple facial expression recognition training could improve
empathy of schizophrenia. The cause of the nonsigniﬁcant result in the gain score of
the experimental group needed to be explored further. The sample size might play a
role in explaining these results.

Conclusions
In summary, the current study had used Micro-expression training tool to improve
the empathy of schizophrenia patient. The results showed that the micro-expression
training could enhance empathy. The research provided insights about how to
improve the empathy and social function for patients with schizophrenia.

The Mechanism of Human Error
and Defense Strategies of Astronaut
Manual Rendezvous and Docking
Jiayi Cai, Weifen Huang, Jie Li, Liping Tian, Yanlei Wang
and Zhi Yao
Abstract Astronaut manual rendezvous and docking mission is a complicated
systematic project, the astronauts undergo cognitive, decision-making, and imple-
mentation stages while on duty. According to the theory of human error, three
cognitive stages will be a corresponding error mode. By analyzing the astronaut
manual rendezvous and docking mechanism of human error, the current astronaut’s
errors were classiﬁed in manual rendezvous and docking. The barrier levels were
analyzed, and multiple human errors’ defense strategy of astronaut manual ren-
dezvous and docking was proposed.

Preface
With the development of technology, human needs the help and cooperation from
the machine to solve many engineering problems, design problems, and even sci-
ence problems. Human, machine, and environment form a complicated system. As
the behavior subject in the system, human is the key factor deciding mission
success. Reported by relevant data, about 85% of the accidents in the industrial
enterprises in the present world were directly or indirectly caused by human errors
[1]; thus, the subject of human error became one of the key problems researched by
people.
Experts gave different deﬁnitions from various aspects for the human error. From
the psychological view, Jam Reason, the psychologist of University of Manchester

of UK deﬁned the human error as the phenomena that although a series of planned
psychology or body activities were made by people, the anticipated result was not
achieved, and the failure was not caused by the interference of some external
reasons [2]. From the engineering view, Swain, the cognitive scientist, deﬁned the
human error as any human behavior or action exceeding a certain acceptance
criterion or the acceptance criterion ruled by normal work or the allowable range
[3].
Chinese scholar Li Zhang deﬁned human error as the failure of the planned
action carried out by people to complete the mission under the condition that not
exceed the design function of the human–machine system, it includes the error of
individual, group, and organization [4]. Indicated by the above deﬁnitions, the
human error composed of the following three factors: human action, it is not carried
out as planned during action, and the result of the action exceeded the speciﬁed
criteria or requirement.
During the process of the astronaut manual rendezvous and docking process, the
astronaut was in two airship systems, and it needed the camera installed outside
the airship to take photographs to judge the corresponding positions and postures of
the two spacecraft, and operate the manual controller for controlling the rendezvous
and docking. In this way, the manual rendezvous and docking formed a typical
human-in-the-loop complicated control system, as shown in Fig. 1 [5]. During
these operating processes, the astronaut’s psychological and physical factors and
operating strategy, etc., would cause a series of human errors which then failed the
mission.
The study showed that the human error could not be completely eliminated; we
could only try to minimize it in maximum. To effectively reduce the probability of
the human errors during the astronaut manual rendezvous and docking, the human
errors must be classiﬁed to analyze the different mechanisms and then propose the
corresponding prevention measures.

Study and Classiﬁcation Method of Human Error
According to the viewpoints of the behavioristic psychology, the human behavior
patterns could be expressed as S-O-R (stimulation–organism–reaction) [6], which
was a continuous circulating process. If the three stages were successfully carried
out, the individual could completely perceive the outside information and make a
right decision and take reasonable action to complete the mission, or else, if
wrongly perceiving the outside information, failing in thinking judgment or the
action was blocked, the mission might be caused to fail.
To the three aspects, Whitson boiled the reasons for human error down to
overload, wrong decision, and ergonomics. Overload meant the bearing ability of
people under a psychological status was not adaptive to the load which included the
physical load and psychological load. The human ability meant the body. Physical
and psychological bearing abilities (the human’s natural quality), the current psy-
chological status, the knowledge and technology level relevant to the current work,
and the temporary ability decrease caused by taking medicine or alcohol, pressure,
or fatigue. The wrong decision meant under some conditions, the unsafe behavior
chosen by the executor was more logical than choosing the safe behavior. The
ergonomics mainly comprised of two aspects: The current work condition and his
physique were not matched, and the work platform was designed to easily cause
people’s error [7].
It was a qualitative study method in the human error study by carrying out
classiﬁcation analysis to the human error in the system, and during the analysis, the
retrospective classiﬁcation analysis means were used to get the processing and
avoiding measures of human error, which were more speciﬁc and targeted. The
current classiﬁcation theory for human error mainly composed of four models, i.e.,
Swain’s classiﬁcation method [3], Norman’s classiﬁcation method, Rasmussen’s
classiﬁcation method, and Reason’s classiﬁcation method [8–12].
The Swain classiﬁcation method was the early classiﬁcation method as well as
the one proposed for people’s execution results. He believed the human error
behavior might have the following conditions: incorrectly doing something; failing
in completing a mission (failing in execution); or not doing something in time, etc.
Based on above, he further divided human error into the error of carrying out
(EOC) and the error of omission (EOO). Currently, the classiﬁcation method was
widely applied for the reliability analysis of people in the nuclear industry ﬁeld, but
the key focus point was EOO. The classiﬁcation method did not study the error
mechanism but was only used for the preliminary classiﬁcation of the error.
The Norman classiﬁcation method believed the error or the action error might
occur at any stage. It tended to study the psychological factor hidden behind the
error behavior. Targeting to the human behavior and the psychological factor
behind during the human–machine interaction process, Norman divided it into
seven stages: (1) establishing the target, (2) form the intention, (3) action
description, (4) action execution, (5) understanding of system status, (6) explaining
the system status, and (7) assess the system status according to the target and

intention. Norman divided speciﬁc speech error into three classes according to the
psychological factor for generation: (1) formation error of intention, (2) the schema
structure was falsely activated, and (3) improper false triggering and confusion was
generated to the schema structure in the activation status. Based on the schema
psychological model, Norman explained the speech error by the activation trigger
schema system (ATS) model and pointed out the classiﬁcation theory could be
applied to the other ﬁelds.
The Rasmussen classiﬁcation method was mainly used for describing the
human’s cognitive behavior process. According to the cognitive psychology theory,
Jens Rasmussen (Risoe-National Laboratory, Denmark) classiﬁed human’s cogni-
tive behaviors, and with the three information input ways of signal, sign, and
symbol, he characterized human’s cognitive activities into the skill-based type, the
rule-based type, and the knowledge-based type. The skill-based cognitive behavior
mode was the one that the operator could react almost without any thinking, and the
mode was approximate to human’s instinct. The rule-based cognitive behavior was
the one that the operator had to choose a certain rule and carry out the mission as
required by the rule. The knowledge-based cognitive behavior was the one that the
operator needed to analyze, decide, and execute by depending on the operator’s
knowledge and experience. The human error was inﬂuenced by the operator’s
technology level, experience, and familiarity to the working environment. The
classes of human errors generated on every cognitive behavior level were different.
Rasmussen deeply discussed the human error and formed the error classiﬁcation
method based on the SRK model.
The error classiﬁcation method based on psychology mainly considered the
relationship between human behavior and intention. Based on Rasmussen’s SRK
model, Reason proposed a concept classiﬁcation method which divided human
error into slip, lapse, and mistake.
Reason’s human error theory divided people’s cognition of mission into three
stages which mainly comprised of planning, storage, and execution. Planning meant
the target was clear and a series of action sequences had been selected for realizing
the target. Storage meant the selected plan was stored in the memory until executed
at the proper time. Execution meant the plan was executed by executing the
behavior process ruled by the plan. There were corresponding error modes in the
three cognitive stages. Generally, slip occurred in execution, and was the error in
execution of the formed plan. Lapse occurred in storage and was the omission or
error occurred in the plan or plan storage. The mistake occurred in the planned
process and the designated plan was not proper for completing the target mission
[13, 14].
The slip and lapse often occurred in the execution of the skill operation of the
SRK model and were mainly caused by people’s loss of attention or the high
automatic nature of the working environment. The mistake was often hidden and
could not be discovered easily or restored within a short time. When encountering
the information which was not compatible with the formed judgment or concept,
people often would refuse and insist on the former opinion or decision; thus, the
restoration way of the mistake was hard, and efforts should be given for prevention.
198
J. Cai et al.

To further analyze the mechanism of error, based on the SRK model, Reason
established the GEMS (Generic Error-Modeling System) model. Same as the SRK
model, the GEMS model divided human’s cognitive level into the skill-based
(SB) type, the rule-based (RB) type, and the knowledge-based (KB) type. The error
might occur at any stage, and slip and lapse often occurred in the execution of the
skill-based action and were mainly caused by people’s loss of attention or the high
automatic nature of the working environment. The mistake was often hidden and
could not be discovered easily. Selecting improper rule was the main reason
causing the mistake of the rule-based cognitive level. The mistake of the
knowledge-based cognitive level was mainly caused by inaccurate or uncompleted
understanding of the system, deviation conﬁrmation, overconﬁdence, mental fati-
gue, etc. [15].
The frequencies of the errors of the three types (SB, RB, and KB) were generally
as follows: SB  RB > KB. The probability of SB error was about 67% as well as
27 and 11%, respectively, for RB and KB. The statistic result was mainly generated
by people executed more SB missions than RB and KB missions, but when indi-
vidually executing the KB mission, the people’s error probability was higher than
those of SB and RB [15].
With the comparison of the above four classiﬁcation methods, we could clearly
ﬁnd out the study on the classiﬁcation method for human error was gradually
developed from the simple execution behavior classiﬁcation to the classiﬁcation of
the cognitive process analysis and focused on extending to the generation mecha-
nism of human error.

Classiﬁcation and Analysis of Human Errors
of Astronaut Manual Rendezvous and Docking
Currently, the astronaut mainly executed the manual rendezvous and docking
mission on the near-earth orbit and compared with the ground engineering mission,
the requirements for the safety and success of mission completion were higher.
Before the astronaut’s ﬂight, ﬂight manuals were made for all items to be operated
and speciﬁed the ﬂow for executing the rendezvous and docking ﬂow, etc., the
group and organization error occurred in the astronaut’s manual rendezvous and
docking were not the key study points of the paper, we mainly analyzed the
classiﬁcation of the human error from the astronaut’s individual angle.
The manual rendezvous and docking mission executed by the astronaut was same
as the other targeted production activities carried out by human and often needed to
experience three stages as follows: (1) perceiving stage, (2) decision stage, and
(3) execution stage. The image recognition, human decision, and operation handle
work were carried out. Combined with Rasmussen’s and Reason’s classiﬁcation
methods, the main errors occurred in perceiving, decision, and operation processes
of the astronaut’s manual rendezvous and docking were analyzed.

During the perceiving process, the astronaut might easily have slip and lapse
which were mainly caused the information loss or omission generated by the loss of
attention in the image information input process. Most of the astronaut’s errors
generated in the manual decision process were mistakes. The decision error was
mainly caused the astronaut selected wrong rules in image identiﬁcation and
operation decision processes. The decision error mainly comprised of the space
direction judgment error and the rule application error. In the process of operating
the handle, the main errors generated by the astronaut were slip and lapse. The
handle operation error meant the astronaut had made the corrective decision in
the manual decision process, however, errors occurred in the process of executing
the formed plan, and then, the operation error was caused. The handle operation
error mainly comprised of the errors of operating direction, operating amount, and
selection of operation handle, etc. The classiﬁcation diagram of the errors of the
astronaut’s manual rendezvous and docking is shown in Fig. 2.

Indicated by Fig. 2, it belonged to the error type of the human error when the
decision error was caused by rule application error and space and direction judg-
ment error, which was the key point of our study. The decision error was further
analyzed.
In the manual rendezvous and docking mission, the astronaut mainly realized the
manual rendezvous and docking of the two airships by a plurality of times of handle
operation. Every operation included the processes of cognition, decision, and
operation, i.e., judgment of the relative space and direction relationship of two
airships, decision of handle operation, and implementation of the actual operating
action; thus, the mission type was mainly between the RB and KB mission types.
The mission ﬁrstly perceived the image information, which belonged to the skill
mission, and the main errors were slip and lapse. There were two ways for further
processing the image information, one could be completed in the rule-based cog-
nitive level, such as the behavior of switching the ﬁeld of view, when it was judged
that the distance between the targeted aerocraft to the airship was smaller than a
certain distance, the narrow ﬁeld of view was switched, and the other one was
completed under the knowledge-based cognitive level, it needed the astronaut to
judge the space position relationship by images, carry out the decision of the
required operation, rapidly form the operation plan in brain, then combine with the
operation rules saved in brain by training, and then form the actual handle control
operation. Based on Reason’s error mechanism model, we analyzed the classiﬁ-
cation of the human error of the astronaut manual rendezvous and docking was
shown as Fig. 3. The analysis and classiﬁcation of the human error of the manual
rendezvous and docking could be the basis for us to make the corresponding barrier
and prevention measures.

Barrier Analysis and Prevention Measures of Astronaut
Manual Rendezvous and Docking [16]
Must disastrous consequence occur once there was human error in the system? No,
because there were many barriers set in the modern great system to prevent the
harms caused by human error. The barrier was the means for protecting the
equipment performance and improving people’s safety and could be physical or
administrative. The barrier was set to prevent human error or relieving the conse-
quence caused by human error. The barrier analysis was mainly used for us to know
how to analyze the barrier and ﬁnd out which barrier was not useful and why the
problem occurred when the human error occurred.
The modern defense technology needed the barrier running experience for
feedback so as to provide useful information or suggestion for reinforcing the
defense. Not all human errors would cause the disastrous consequence, because
multiple barriers were set on the key parts of many systems. The failure of one
barrier generally would not cause the severe consequence. The disastrous conse-
quence was often caused by multiple barriers of the accident chain that were
invalid. Suppose only one barrier was effective, the barrier would prevent the error
or relieve the consequence caused by the error. The defect or bug of the safety
barrier could be found out through the barrier analysis so as to provide an effective
improvement method, and the system safety performance could be improved by
adding a new barrier or modifying the original barrier.
The typical barriers were the physical type and the administrative type, wherein
the physical barrier mainly composed of all types of sound or optical alarming
signals, safety protection equipment, etc., and the administrative barrier mainly
composed of personnel training and education, qualiﬁcation and personnel
appointment, management rules, communication way of working staff, personnel
authorization, personnel mutual monitoring, etc.
The astronaut manual rendezvous and docking was an extremely big system
behavior and depended on not only the astronaut’s personal psychological and
physical qualities and personal technology and cognitive level but also the whole
astronaut selecting and training system, and the astronaut on-orbit risk and safety
assessment system were running. The following was the barrier analysis ﬁgure
carried out according to the astronaut’s actual running mode (Fig. 4).

Prevention Strategy for the Human Error During
Astronaut Manual Rendezvous and Docking [6]
After the above analysis, to reduce the human error accidents of the astronaut
on-orbit manual rendezvous and docking and improve human reliability, the fol-
lowing measures could be taken to reduce the astronaut’s unsafe behaviors and
decrease the error rate.

1. Perfect the human–machine interaction system. The human–machine–environ-
ment was a completed system, and its whole reliability was very closely relevant
to the optimization condition of their mutual intersection. Started by taking
people as the center and from the human’s physical, psychological, and spiritual
characteristics, the safety level and operability of the system were examined
from the system height. The docking safety facilities, such as the warning lamps,

safety lock, could be improved and added to improve the human–machine
interface status and environmental factor so as to improve the system reliability.
2. Perfect the astronaut’s selecting system. Carried out personality test, psycho-
logical quality test, cognition test, physical test, etc., to the astronaut to ensure
the selected astronaut could meet the requirements on successfully completing
the rendezvous and docking mission in the spatial speciﬁc environmental factor.
3. Perfect the astronaut’s training system. The effect of the training on the astronaut
manual rendezvous and docking was directly relevant to the astronaut’s ability
for executing the mission. The training system of the astronaut ground manual
rendezvous and docking and the training method should be studied, and the
training efﬁciency should be increased by the means of teaching, practice,
training, etc., so as to relieve the inﬂuence of the spatial overload on the
astronaut and lower the human error rate. The astronaut’s abilities for judging,
predicting, and processing in the accident and emergency should be improved so
as to essentially reduce the human unsafe behaviors and reduce or avoid human
error events and safety accidents.
4. Perfect the astronaut’s work load design. Inﬂuenced by space weightlessness,
radiation, and other factors, the astronaut had high space work load. The
astronaut’s work mission ﬂow and load condition should be reasonably arranged
in every mission period as well as the astronaut’s time table so as to ensure the
astronaut’s work ability for completing the mission.
5. Perfect the space and ground cooperation system. The success ratio on the
astronaut for completing the on-orbit rendezvous and docking mission was
required to be 100%. When the astronaut was in the ground experiment and
on-orbit mission period, the perfected communication and feedback mechanism
should be established. Errors should be analyzed and classiﬁed, and corrective
actions should be taken to prevent the similar events from repeatedly occurring.
In addition, the perfect astronaut on-orbit risk and safety assessment system
should be established to combine the technology means, organization means,
and standard culture means so as to construct the active human error accident
defense system in depth from the processes and aspects of management deci-
sion, organization, technology, accident analysis and reduction, feedback, etc.,
actively discover and identify the possible human error accidents, and take
effective measures to reduce and prevent. Because of the human complexity and
our cognition limit, there were many difﬁculties to be emergently solved for
analyzing the human error reliability, and further study was needed.

Human-Perceived Quality in Rail
Transit Vehicles
Haiyan Ding, Weibing Bao and Xiangfei Yu
Abstract Interior design for rail transit vehicles shall not only focus on the structure
of components but also consider the ergonomic performance settling the organic
connection of harmonic human–machine–environment system, to make the interior
design satisfy the human physical and psychological needs, so that the environment
for passengers and crew is safer and more comfortable. Ergonomic design begins
with studies on drivers’ and passengers’ psychology, covering the sense of vision,
hearing, smell and touch and combination thereof, which allows passengers to have
great ride experience in a tidy, comfortable and wonderful environment inside the car.

Foreword
With the development of the railway industry in China, a new round of market
competition will focus on speed to comfort. The design for rail transit vehicle shall
not only be limited to the appearance and decoration of components, but also
consider human perception, and the driving and riding environment, and study by
focusing on users including passengers and crew members. Of course, studies shall
examine people’s response and adaptation to the physical factors in the environ-
ment, analyze the effects of light, sound, heat, vibration, dust and smell on human
physiology, psychology and efﬁciency, and determine comfort and safety when
passengers are staying and crew members are working onboard a vehicle.

Comfort
2.1
Operating Comfort
From the point of people’s subjective perception, the design inside the train shall
ensure that components are operated in a comfortable manner by considering
following:
(1) Whether the components are properly located and easily found;
(2) Whether the components are easily accessible and operating them is restricted
or prevented;
(3) Whether markings of components are easily understood and seen clearly,
quickly and easily; and
(4) Whether the space for operation is sufﬁcient and the feedback of force is
reasonable.
3D prototypes may be used during the design to deﬁne the reach of ﬁngers,
hands and arms for designers’ reference. Some famous companies have established
a driver simulation system by using motion capture software for animation design,
so that engineers could capture people’s motion more accurately and make virtual
simulation design before developing more rational and ergonomic vehicles [1].
2.2
Riding Comfort
Components direct or indirect contact with human body, e.g., passengers’ seats,
driver’s seat, driver’s console and baggage holder, shall be assessed, including their
static and dynamic operation and adjustment. The current analysis methods include
some subjectivity assessments, such as CAE analysis (RAMSIS and comfort sim-
ulation software), pressure distribution testing and track testing. Based on the
parameters from design experience, CAE computer analysis, repeated professional
veriﬁcation and third-party evaluation during development, a rational layout of
luggage storage space shall be designed, tested and adjusted according to the
seating capacity and the operating zone in order to develop comfortable seats and
armrests, driver’s control devices that can alleviate driving fatigue, passengers’
comfortable zone with privacy being highlighted, and holders that allow luggage to
be placed easily and securely.

Human Perception System
Ergonomics study means the design is done by considering human physiology,
psychology and feeling, including vision, touch, hearing, facility comfortable and
subjective perception. In order to distinguish it from the traditional factors, we call
it “perceived quality” for the time being, as shown in Table 1.
3.1
Visual Perception
In order to observe, human eyes always sweep objects horizontally ﬁrst and then
vertically. The eyes are not likely fatigue when sweeping horizontally, which is also
faster than sweeping vertically. Meanwhile, the dimensional estimate is far more
accurate when they sweep horizontally other than vertically. Therefore, the sight
window of electric instruments always makes a horizontal rectangle and instrument
panels rotate clockwise [2]. All major display instruments are located within 3°
from the center of vision, general ones within 20°–40° and minor ones within 40°–
60°. Usually, instruments are not located beyond 80°, where human reading is very
poor by eye. The color of data and diagrams shown on instruments shall be clear
and noticeable with dark background in order to highlight the indication [2].
Human eyes are stimulated to sense different colors. Colors are matched for
internal tone, information indication and marking indication by considering color
deviation and visibility [3]: highly pure white for wallboard and ceiling, which
looks neat and bright; highly saturate colors for fabrics, ornaments and markings,
which highlight color layers, light up the in-car atmosphere, ease the longitudinal
feeling, and increase the enjoyment.

Seats are arranged longitudinally under the principle of “laid against the win-
dows.” Decelerating glass is used for windows to avoid the sense of spinning.
Hidden curtain is made rolling and pervious to light, which is small in size and
resistant to pollution.
Spot, line and area lightings are all used in cars with different meaning: spot
lighting guides the ﬂow of passengers; line lighting is the major lighting; and area
lighting works to create in-car atmosphere. This is true of Shinkansen, inside which
different layers of lighting are created and the melody and order of ceiling patterns
are added [4]. See Fig. 1.
3.2
Auditory Perception
Hearing is stimulated by sound waves. The range of frequency that can be heard by
human ears is 20 Hz–20 kHz. Any sound more than 30 dB may disturb the
sleeping brain wave, thus lowering the sleep quality; that more than 50 dB may
affect people’s working efﬁciency; that more than 70 dB may disturb speech,
making people upset and distracted, thus affecting their efﬁciency and in some
cases, which may cause accidents; that more than 90 dB for a long time may affect
hearing and even cause illnesses [5]. See Fig. 2.

Unbearable noise is inevitably produced when the vehicle body contacts the air,
the wheels contact the rails, and the pantograph contacts the lines during the train
travels at a high speed [6]. The following measures are taken to reduce noise:
(1) Noise from the understructure of cars is reduced by employing light-weight
body, elastic wheels and shockproof rubber mats;
(2) Noise from the superstructure of the vehicles is reduced by streamlining both
front and rear, employing a drum shape, optimizing the shape of car bottom and
bogie, improving the structure of pantograph and adding external windshields;
(3) Injecting foaming and loose materials, e.g., polyethylene and asbestos, into the
materials of vehicle body to noise-proof, making car body air-tighter and
maintaining temperature to reduce noise transmittance [7];
(4) Vibration-damping measures are taken for some components to prevent reso-
nance or reserve some space to prevent noise produced by collision.
Apart from noise, alarming sound may be given when the train is traveling.
Audible alarms are usually used together with visual signs, e.g., signal device and
warning device [2]. Red spots ﬂash on the display when the speakers give alarming
sound to remind the driver.
3.3
Smelling Perception
Human beings have very good sensibility to smell and are able to identify even
2000–4000 different substances by smelling. As a means of public transport, the
population density inside rail cars is always on the high side, so cars when in
operation are always full of different odors, e.g., sweaty odor of passengers, odor
from toilets and smell from food carried by passengers. It constitutes a great
challenge for the central ventilation system in cars. Fresh air is drawn into the cars
from the outside. As airﬂow is very weak and transverse diffusion of pollutants is
very slow in cars, such pollutants are lifted by up ﬂow into the overhead zone and
ﬁnally emitted from the outlet on the ceiling, so that the air inside cars may keep
clean all the time (as shown in Fig. 3). Airline meal shall be used for long distance
trains, where cold food is heated to reduce emission of food smell. Smoking is
prohibited in cars. Human perception of ambient air quality is usually measured
according to the concentration of CO2. The higher such concentration is, the more
fatigue passengers may feel. See Table 2.
3.4
Touch Perception
The sense of touch is the same as that of vision. It is a main channel from which
people have spatial information. The perception of touch in cars involves all
Human-Perceived Quality in Rail Transit Vehicles

accessible components, e.g., hardness, temperature, viscosity, smoothness and
roughness of surface; trimming, parting line and sharp chamfer; response, feedback
time, operating force and smoothness of buttons; and response of functional parts.
The data for design are acquired by measuring frictional force, roughness, ﬂexibility
and temperature of in-car components with touch robot and comparing the mea-
surement with feedback from passengers. Compared with human body, the reso-
lution of a robot’s perception is higher, so it can more accurately measure
components’ surface sense of touch to ensure materials are as expected by people.
Comfortable feeling when touching materials can provide favorable psychological
suggestion and convey some information of products in use, so they can improve
usability and comfort of products to people.

Conclusions
With the development of rail transit in China becoming more and more mature, the
global market competition becomes more competitive and design plays an
increasingly important role. We do not only focus on the structure of components
but also consider the ergonomic performance settling the organic connection of
harmonic human–machine–environment system, to make the interior design satisfy
the human physical and psychological needs, so that the environment for passen-
gers and crew is safer and more comfortable. Ergonomic design begins with studies
on drivers’ and passengers’ psychology, covering the sense of vision, hearing, smell
and touch and combination thereof, which allows passengers to have great ride
experience in the tidy, comfortable and wonderful environment inside the car.

Occipital Alpha Waves Advantage Activity
Deqian Zhang, Wenjiao Cheng and Hezhi Yang
Abstract Monitoring work performance declined has become need solution of
important security problem, to prevent operator monitoring performance decline.
This research based on simulated monitoring task collected 16 scalp sites EEG
signal, by bands ﬁlter and wavelet analysis. We found that, in the site of central
lobe, parietal lobe, occipital lobe, alpha wave advantage activities (cosine similarity
of alpha wave and original waveform) associated with monitoring performance (hit
rate). Alpha wave activity increases leading to reduced monitor performance. Alpha
wave activity increases as monitor’s performance decline. While uses the
curve-estimate for the regression analysis we found that quadratic function and
cubic function more than the linear function could reﬂect the relevance of the
advantage of alpha wave activity and monitor performance. On the right brain scalp
occipital site (O2), the quadratic function model reﬂects best correlation between
the advantage of alpha waves activities and the monitoring performance, and it will
ﬁt the helmet acquisition of EEG electrodes placement in actual vigilance work.

monitoring work, the study tries to explore the early warning model of the variation of
the brain wave spectrum as vigilance decrease.
The previous study ﬁnds the advantageous activities of different frequency
ranges of the brain wave reﬂecting different physical status and different psycho-
logical processing states. The advantageous activities of a wave [4] correlates to
fatigue, relaxation, rest and conscious activity weakening [5]. The advantageous
activities of a wave [4], the study uses the cosine similarity index of a wave [6] and
the original waveform [7]. The higher the similarity of a wave is, the stronger the
advantage of a wave activity is [8].

Methods
2.1
Participants
After undertaking the subject, ten healthy right-handed college students (male 8,
female 2) are given the informed consent. Their average age is 19, and their ages
range from 18 to 20 years. All participants say their vision is normal or corrected to
be normal, and they do not have any problem in the nervous system. They are not
trained before, and they sign the informed consent which meets Chinese ethical
norms before the experiment.
2.2
Material and Designs
The alertness mission aims to let the participates monitor the movement of the
second hand by simulating the clock test of Mackworth’s radar task [9] on the basis
of the signal detection theory. The second hand moves clockwise for one space
every time. When the second hand moves for two spaces at one time, it is used as a
signal. The participator is required to click the left key of the mouse. Then, the
software automatically generates a new random sequence signal (between 8 and
52 s). The experiment lasts for 80 min. The participators are required to continue
the movement of the second hand. The computer program automatically follows
and records the hit reaction, reaction time, detection leakage and false alarm. The
experiment software synchronously and automatically records the EEG data.

2.3
EEG Data Extraction
The 16-channel EEG records are from the scalp frontal lobe, parietal lobe, center
and occipital lobe (FP1, FP2, F3, F4, C3, C4, P3, P4, O1, O2, F7, F8, T3, T4, T5 和
T6, Fig. 1) areas. All electrodes are connected to the ear electrodes as the ground
reference [10]. The 200-Hz sampling rate is used for collecting the data of the
frequency range records from 0.03 to 30 Hz. The total value of the recorded
electrode impedance is lower than 5 kx. After the EEG is preprocessed, the
Butterworth band-pass ﬁlter is used [11], and then, the functional EEG signal which
is then extracted and screened is used for postmortem analysis.
2.4
Data Analysis
To the monitoring alertness performance (behavior index), we use the average
detection rate of signal detection (the hit rate) and the hit reaction time (RT) for
calculation.
The EEG signal for analysis collects a segment of 1.28s (256 points)
wave-longth of original EEG before 2s of the stimulus appearing to be used as the
psychological preparation status of the brain activity of the monitoring work, and
the 1.28s wave-longth EEG original signal while the stimulus signal appears to be
used as the responded status of stimulus. After the band-pass ﬁlter is used for
ﬁltration, 8 frequency ranges are divided as follows: d(0.01–4 Hz), h(4.01-8 Hz),
a1(8.01–10 Hz), a2(10.01–13 Hz), b1(13.0.01–20 Hz), b2(20.01–30 Hz), a(8.01–
13 Hz), b(13.01–30 Hz). Calculate the cosine similarity of the waveform of all
frequency ranges (such as a wave) and the original waveform [7].

The two subjects’ federated data are used for analysis. Then, it is found the EEG a
wave similarity in the occipital visuo-area is most signiﬁcantly relevant to the
monitoring performance, and the EEG a wave similarity in the O2 occipital
visuo-area at the right side is more signiﬁcantly relevant to the monitoring per-
formance than that of the left side.
The SPSS statistic software is used for the parameter estimation of the model
curve ﬁtting of polynomial of one indeterminate of the preprocessed data as shown
in Table 1. The ﬁtting curve is shown in Fig. 2.
Figure 2 clearly displays the curve relationship between the hitting rate of the
monitoring performance and a wave similarity of the occipital region at the right
side. The implemented curve ﬁtting shows that the relationship of the linear
function is not signiﬁcant, and the quadratic function and the cubic function have
signiﬁcant ﬁtting effect as shown in Table 1.

The curve ﬁtting analysis is carried out [12], as shown in Table 1. It is indicated
that in the curve model of the quadratic function, R2 = 0.036, F(2,264) = 4.880,
p = 0.008 < 0.01). The ﬁtting superiority of the curve model of the quadratic
function is the best ﬁtting model. The implemented curve ﬁtting shows the rela-
tionship of the linear function is not signiﬁcant, and the quadratic function and the
cubic function have signiﬁcant ﬁtting effects. Shown in Table 1.

3.2
Check of Parameter Estimation Model of Curve Fitting
To check the application effectiveness of the model, the absolute value of a wave
similarity is used for the extensive estimation. The gradual check from the vertex
of the origin curve is carried out. When |X| is ampliﬁed to 0.16, the double-layer
performance Y is signiﬁcantly differed which is shown in Table 2.
When the absolute value |X| of a wave similarity of the occipital region (O2) at
the right brain side is 0.16 (threshold value), the double-layer performance sig-
niﬁcantly differed, F = 11.065, p < 0.01, t = −2.128, p < 0.01. When the absolute
value |X| of a wave similarity is  0.16 (threshold value), the performance of the
hitting rate of the monitoring work signiﬁcantly decreased.
Thus, the absolute value 0.16 of a wave similarity can be used as the early
warning threshold.
4
Discussion and Conclusions
In the study, a wave similarity (the cosine similarity of a wave and the original
waveform) can reﬂect the advantageous activity of a wave. The absolute value of a
wave similarity and the monitoring performance are in a negative direction rele-
vance. With the increase in the advantageous activity of a wave, the monitoring
performance tends to decrease. The phenomenon is clear in the brain center region,
parietal region and occipital region, and it is the clearest in the occipital region
(visuo-area) at the right side. To consider the real situation, combining with the
monitoring of the actual central or double-layer monitoring on the monitoring
operator, using the scalp occipital regions are more convenient for placing the
helmet-type electrodes which is used for collecting EEG signals, and can be
practically applied. Thus, selecting the O2 area of the occipital region for modeling
has practical application value.
The parameter model of the quadratic function established by the study result
has the reference value for actual application.

Since New China was founded, physical training is listed into the training outline of
our army, and the Physical Teaching Norms is issued, in which the physical training
is listed as the formal training subject and examination assessment item. It rein-
forces the ofﬁcers and soldiers’ physique, trains their brave and tough spirits,
improves the army’s combat effectiveness and promotes our army’s revolutionized,
modern and regularized construction. The military sports is the basic training for
improving the soldier’s physique. The strong body is the excellent foundation for
military training as well as one of the important factors forming the combat
effectiveness. During the combat, the best weapon and the soldier’s tenacious spirit
are the important factors for winning. Sufﬁciently displaying the combat effec-
tiveness is based on the strong physical ﬁtness in a certain degree. Under the
modern war condition, no matter how advanced the weapon is, people still decide

the result of the war and is the key element for military occupation. Thus, the people
factor is the most important factor for winning the war, and to the people factor, the
strong physical ﬁtness is the important material basis for the combat effectiveness.
The consolidation, improvement and displaying of the military skill and tactical
level depend on the base of the strong physical ﬁtness reserve; thus, the military
sports training has a close connection with the military skill training, tactical
training and application. Without the strong body and vigorous energy, people
cannot be adapted to the military work demand which is intensive and difﬁcult.
Generally, there are two types of physical ﬁtness examinations in the US army,
in which it is ruled the soldier passing the assessment gets the certiﬁcate of military
physical training and the one who is graded A for physical ﬁtness will be rewarded
spiritually and materially. The one who fails the examination will also be strictly
punished. Rule by the US land army is that the one who fails in body weight
standard and physical ﬁtness examination cannot be promoted, and the one whose
body weight cannot meet the standard within 2 moths will be dismissed. Rule by
the US navy [1] is that the ofﬁcer or soldier who fails in the physical ﬁtness
examination will not be promoted and the one who fails for three times in the last
four years will be dismissed. In 2003, there were more than 3000 personnel dis-
missed from US army because of the body weight issue. Arthur who is the former
vice chief of naval operations as well as the four-star general ever nominated as the
commander of the Paciﬁc Ocean headquarter of US army, but he failed because of
he is too fat and also he was commanded for early retirement.
The soldier’s somatotype is one of the important parts forming the soldier’s
physical ﬁtness. The change in the soldier’s height and somatotype also reﬂects the
signiﬁcant change in our army construction idea and the ofﬁcers and soldiers’
concepts. The most prominent characteristic of the Soldier Military Physical Fitness
Standard (issued in 2006) which is being implemented by us is that the somatotype
standard is listed into the soldier examination. After the development about ten
years, how does the soldier’s somatotype assessment inﬂuence the generation of the
army combat effectiveness is the purpose and signiﬁcance of the paper.
1
Study Object and Method
The paper studies on the basis of the data from documents. For the Outline pro-
poses, the soldier’s body weight standard is forced to be satisﬁed, using the
international general indicator—BMI index (body mass index) can better accurately
reﬂect if the somatotype meets the standard and also it is the index adopted by
Chinese National Health Standards for Students. With CNKI, the paper named as
Investigation and Study of the Conditions of Somatotype and Physical Fitness of
the Ofﬁcers of the Armed Police College, which is published by Hongjun [2] on the
Journal of Chinese people’s Liberation Army Special Warfare School (volume 31,
fourth issue, October, 2012) is found.

The somatotype and physical ﬁtness qualities of the ofﬁcers from four armed
police colleges are tested and analyzed, and the conclusion is the somatotype
conditions of the college ofﬁcers are worrying, and the cardio-pulmonary function
and waist and abdomen strength are their main weakness, and the somatotype has a
close relationship with the body quality. We think the study result analysis is not
deep enough; thus, it is necessary to deeply analyze these data, but we only take
male soldiers as the study subject for analysis.

Study Result and Discussion
As required by the Soldier Military Physical Fitness Standard [3], the basic
physical ﬁtness items are tested, which include somatotype, push-up, sit-up,
10 m  5 shuttle run and 3000-m run. BMI is the derivative index.
BMI (body mass index) is the index which is closely relevant to the in vivo fat
total amount and is the current international common standard for measuring the
somatotype and health condition. According to the Judgment Standards for Adult
Body Weight (WS/T 428-2013) issued by National Health and Family Planning
Commission of PRC in April, 2013, the BMI standard is [4]:
BMI  18.5 kg/m2 underweight
18.5 kg/m2 < BMI  24.0 kg/m2 normal
24.0 kg/m2 < BMI  28.0 kg/m2 too fat
BMI > 28.0 kg/m2 obesity
The BMI assessment standard of the study is classiﬁed according to the clas-
siﬁcation standard. The test results of the items of the somatotype and basic
physical ﬁtness items of the male soldiers of the four age sections are shown in
Table 1. For direct expression, we also make the series statistic chart for expression.
Shown by the analysis of the test data of the physical ﬁtness of different BMI
groups of different ages, there is a close relationship between the somatotype and
physical ﬁtness quality of the male ofﬁcers of the armed police colleges (shown in
Table 1).
2.1
Analysis of Soldier’s Strength Quality
The strength quality is mainly represented by the push-up and sit-up items of the
basic physical ﬁtness. In a direct comparison of the test data for analysis, the
average times of the push-up ranked from more to less are, respectively:
underweight group > normal group > too fat group > obesity group, and the
average times of the sit-ups ranked from more to less are, respectively: normal
group > too fat group > obesity group > underweight group. It is apparently not

comprehensive, and we shall also consider it according to ages and, respectively,
make the assumption tests for the reasonable judgment. Take the push-up as the
example, there is only one person in the too fat group lower than 25 years old as
well as only one people in the one from 35 to 44 years old; thus, it can be,
respectively, merged into the normal group but not for comparison. To the other
groups of all ages, the independent mean value t-check of two samples is,
respectively, carried out with the normal group.
The results show that there is no signiﬁcant meaning in the push-up and sit-up of
people of age older than 35 years, who are the ofﬁcers of the command organi-
zations, and the people of the age from 25 to 34 years who are just the main force of
the ofﬁcers for the battalion, company and platoon units; the deviations of the too
fat group and the obesity group from the normal group both have the signiﬁcant
meaning, which proves the somatotype is one of the important factors inﬂuencing
the strength quality (Refer to Fig. 1).

2.2
Analysis of Soldier’s Agility and Harmony Qualities
The agility and harmony qualities are mainly represented by the 10*5 shuttle run of
the basic physical ﬁtness. If directly compared the test data for analysis, the average
time consumption of the 10*5 shuttle run ranked from short to long is, respectively:
underweight group < normal group < too fat group < obesity group. It is appar-
ently not comprehensive, and we shall also consider it according to ages and,
respectively, make the assumption tests for the reasonable judgment. There is only
one person in the too fat group lower than 25 years old as well as only one person
in the one from 35 to 44 years old; thus, it can be, respectively, merged into the
normal group but not for comparison. To the other groups of all ages, the inde-
pendent mean value t-check of two samples is, respectively, carried out with the
normal group.
The results show that there is no signiﬁcant meaning in the 10*5 shuttle run of
the age range from 35 to 44 years old, who are the ofﬁcers of the command
organizations. The deviation of the too fat group and the obesity group and the

normal group from 25 to 44 years old and the age higher than 45 years old has the
signiﬁcant meaning, which proves the somatotype is one of the important factors
inﬂuencing the agility and harmony qualities. Particularly to the command ofﬁcers
who are older than 45 years, their body weights continuously increase but the time
for and the strength of physical ﬁtness training are continuously decreased, and the
inﬂuence from the somatotype is more (Refer to Fig. 2).
2.3
Analysis of Soldier’s Endurance Quality
The endurance quality is mainly represented by the 3000-m running of the basic
physical ﬁtness. In a direct comparison of the test data for analysis, the average time
consumption of the 3000-m running is, respectively, ranked from short to long as
normal group < too fat group < obesity group. It is apparently not comprehensive,
and we shall also consider it according to ages and, respectively, make the
assumption tests for the reasonable judgment. There is only one person in the too fat

group lower than 25 years old as well as only one people in the one from 35 to
44 years old; thus, it can be, respectively, merged into the normal group but not for
comparison. To the other groups of all ages, the independent mean value t-check of
two samples is, respectively, carried out with the normal group. The results show
that there is no signiﬁcant meaning in the 3000-m running of the ages older than
45 years, who are the ofﬁcers of the command organizations, and it proves although
the body weights of the command ofﬁcers who are older than 45 years increase
continuously, their endurance quality is kept well in general. The deviation of the
obesity group and the normal group from 35 to 44 years old has the signiﬁcant
meaning. The deviation of the too fat group and the obesity group and the normal
group from 25 to 34 years old has the signiﬁcant meaning, which proves the
somatotype is one of the important factors inﬂuencing the endurance quality (Refer
to Fig. 3).
3
Conclusion and Recommendations
3:1 The study results indicate the male soldier’s somatotype is one of the
important factors inﬂuencing the physical ﬁtness and has a close relationship
with the physical ﬁtness. The physical ﬁtness of the ofﬁcers who are
35–44 years old and whose somatotype is in the normal range is clearly better
than the one whose somatotype is not standard.
3:2 All ages have a certain advantage for the push-up ability which reﬂects the
upper limb strength, and their overall level difference is little. All ages under
44 years old show high levels for the sit-up ability which reﬂects the waist and
abdomen strength, but the ages after 45 years old show clear decrease in the
waist and abdomen strength.
3:3 Keeping the qualiﬁed somatotype is one of the methods for improving the
combat effectiveness. On February 13, 2015, report by PLA Daily [5], the four
headquarters together issued Outline of Reform and Development of Military
Physical Training (from 2015 to 2020) (hereinafter refer to as the outline),
which requires the soldier’s body weight to be forced to be standard and links
up with promotion.
3:4 The footstone for reinforcing military can only be ﬁrmed by controlling the
solder’s body weight. For more than one year, the few fat men in the barracks
start their plans for losing weight. To the whole Chinese army, it is the battle
in which the combat effectiveness is asked from the physical ﬁtness—scien-
tiﬁc plan for losing weight. To completely implement the outline, all depart-
ments shall cooperate. It shall rule that the people whose body weight is not
standard cannot be promoted or undertake the relevant duty so as to promote
the soldier to meet all items of physical ﬁtness.

Discussion on Approaches and Method
of Cultivation of Talents in Military
Big Data
Weiming Deng
Abstract Military postgraduate education is an important propeller of the trans-
formation of combat power generation model. It is the cornerstone of the army’s
innovation system and innovation ability. It is the main basis for the construction of
the high-level military talent. It plays a basic and leading role during constructing
an information-based army and wining the information war. Facing the challenges
of the big data time and the lack of talent in the military data, the paper proposes
adding new data-related majors and courses in the military postgraduate education.
From the basic level of big data management, the level of joint operational data
security and the level of military decision-making command, the author makes
demonstration to explore the approaches and methods to cultivate the talents in the
military big data.

Military postgraduate education is an important part of the military academy edu-
cation, with both academic and professional dual attributes. It faces not only the
military teaching and research positions, to cultivate and explore scientiﬁc laws and
pay attention to knowledge innovation of high-level academic talents, but also
special positions in the army to cultivate high-level applicable talents adaptable to
the actual needs of the work, with strong practical ability and the ability to ﬁnd and
solve the problems.
Postgraduate students as a force of the military research team will not only
undertake the task of innovation and development of military theory and military
science and technology, but also have the mission to settle the key and difﬁcult
issues in building and combat training and directly improve the combat effective-
ness. Military postgraduate education is an important propeller of the transforma-

innovation system and innovation ability. It is the main basis for the construction of
the high-level military talent. It plays a basic and leading role during constructing
an information-based army and wining the information war.
On March 29, 2012, US President Barack Obama announced the launch of the
Big Data Research and Development Program to improve the ability to acquire
knowledge and ideas from massive digital data, thereby accelerating the science and
engineering discovery, strengthening US national security and achieving education
and learning change. In order to ﬁll in the gap between big data-related talent and
the lack of relevant skills, IBM is cooperating with more than a thousand univer-
sities in the world in big data and analysis. According to incomplete statistics, there
are nearly 170 universities around the world which have set up big data-related
specialties, of which about 150 universities have opened courses for master or
higher degree.
The Standing Committee of the State Council, held on August 19, 2015, adopted
the “Outlines for Action of Promoting the Development of Big Data.” In China’s
big data development, we ﬁnally had a guide to promote the government infor-
mation system and public data sharing and eliminate the information island. The
adoption of the outlines means that top design is available for China’s big data
development. From the data sovereignty, industrial chain covering the industry and
other key elements, the government will assess the revolutionary inﬂuence of the
big data on the government, economic and social operation. The scale of the local
data center construction should be oriented by industrial demand so as to realize
ﬁne design and promote the formation of a good and sustainable ecological envi-
ronment for development of the big data. Therefore, the release of the outlines will
certainly have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on national defense and army building.

Requirements of the Time of the Big Data on Cultivation
of Military Talents
Big data age has come and talent demand is more vigorous. The use of data to make
decisions has become a consensus among managers. The surveys of SAS and
Harvard Business Review show that 75% of the 700 senior managers surveyed
believe that their management decisions are actually dependent on data analysis,
and 40% of have noticed that they make decisions using the results of data analysis
to enhance the importance of their work and the status of the enterprise [1].
Similarly, big data changes the mode of future warfare and also alters the basic
outlook of world military change. Big data is also changing the form and model of
information warfare with deep inﬂuence on the contrast and balance of the world’s
strategic forces.
The military big data has changed the command process of future operations.
The

military big data and the R&D of data visualization, it will greatly improve the
ability to dig out useful intelligence information, visualize the display from massive
intelligence data, realize real-time awareness and sharing of the battleﬁeld situations
of the joint combat, shorten the link cycle of the “sensor–command post–weapon
platform” link and then conduct seamless connection with the real-time perceptive,
cognitive and decision support system so as to establish a real automated infor-
mation system which can complete control independently and make decision,
greatly shorten the cycle from decision and command to the implementation of the
ﬁghting action, improve the rapid response to combat and achieve the integration of
investigation and operation.
Military data security will be the core of future military decision-making oper-
ations. From the recent large-scale exercises on the battleﬁeld home and abroad, we
can see that the information collected from real-time information exchange and
various reconnaissance platforms (such as aerospace reconnaissance, unmanned
aerial vehicle reconnaissance, radar reconnaissance and photoelectric equipment
reconnaissance) and the decisions and instructions of the command center exist and
play the role in the form of data. If we grasp these ever-changing, structural and
non-structural massive data, we grasp the most comprehensive, the core of the
battleﬁeld situation and offensive and defensive focus, and further take the
initiatives.
Military big data speeds up the course of information development of weapons
and equipment. We always stressed that our army was still in the transition period
of mechanization and information, and now we ﬁnd that we have no time to wait,
that future battleﬁeld environment is complex far beyond our imagination, and that
intelligent weapons and equipment have become the mainstream of the develop-
ment trend of equipment. Big data is committed to innovative use of massive data
by using artiﬁcial intelligence to deal with a variety of unstructured data to replace
the traditional information processing method relying on experts and technical staff.
So, with the application of big data technology, weapon and equipment information
system will be upgraded to a highly intelligent and autonomous system from
information user on the battleﬁeld.
Therefore, the requirements of the time of big data on military talents should be
analyzed from the following three levels.
1.1
Basic Level Big Data Management
The professionals of big data theory are called data analysis engineer sometime.
Internationally, it is generally believed that [2] big data talent is scientist and
engineer with a big data processing capacity. At present, overseas universities or
research institutions have set up a large number of theoretical courses on data
science, set the degree of data science and held a variety of short-term training in
data science. From the setting of talent training program, big data talent should
systematically master the skills related to data analysis, including machine learning,
Discussion on Approaches and Method of Cultivation of Talents …
235

probability theory, statistics, artiﬁcial neural network, data mining business analysis
and natural language processing among extensive knowledge, able to independently
access to knowledge and make applications, with team spirit.
1.2
Joint Operation Data Security Level
It is reported that [3] the day of the outbreak of the Iraq War, the US military
headquarters in Qatar and Kuwait were forced to shut down the system due to the
failure to deal with massive comprehensive protection data, resulting in loss of
contact with some of the front-line combat units. It can be seen that the time of big
data has higher requirement on data processing capability. Joint operations focus on
data, and the data are the key to the result. Without data, information warfare is also
out of the question. Data are the core basis of a variety of command information
systems and equipment, a main form constituting information ﬂow of the joint
battleﬁeld and a link connecting all arms of service and all battleﬁeld spaces. So we
must establish a sense of joint operations and stress big data security work. We will
have no data of joint operations without sense of joint operations. As a data staff,
we shall master the data technology, take the initiative to bring data demand in the
joint operations, identify the key issues of joint operational data security and pro-
vide effective security for the decisions made by the commander.
1.3
Military Decision Making and Command Level
We should vigorously cultivate professionals in other ﬁelds that are good at
applying the results of big data, such as talents in intelligence security and military
decision making and command of joint operations. In the past, military decision
making had being mainly based on the experience, intuition, military intelligence
and thinking strategy and data had been deemed as a auxiliary tool for decision
making, while in the time of big data, the data have been updated to support the
decision making. Military decision making must be made based on data analysis.
Relying on big data and cloud computing platform, pre-war simulation, from the
use of weapons to command and control means, can be clearly seen, as the basis for
military decision making. Once the operation plan is found to have problems or
there are unexpected situations, the deployment of operations can be adjusted to
ensure the actual victory and minimize casualties.

Approaches and Methods of Cultivating Military
Talents in Big Data
Headquarters’ “Opinions on In-depth Facilitation of Scientiﬁc Development of
Military Postgraduate Education” [4] points out that the mission of military post-
graduate education is both academic and professional. The main problems include
the imbalance between the academic degree and professional degree, lag of
high-level application-oriented training and the failure of the military postgraduate
education to meet the demand of the construction of the command ofﬁcer team.
“Opinions” points out that the main objective of the cultivation of the military
postgraduate students is special degree. By 2020, the varieties of military post-
graduate students will increase from the current XXX varieties to XXX varieties.
According to this, combined with the above analysis of the needs of military talents
in big data, the author puts forward some approaches or methods of cultivating
high-level application-oriented military talents in big data to meet the needs of
future wars.
2.1
Basic Level of Big Data Management—Set
Authorization Point for the Degree Related to Data
Science
This means cultivation of professionals mastering theory of the big data. According
to the “Opinions” [4], in some military academies or research institutes, we may set
more data science degree granting points under overall management and classiﬁed
deployment within the entire PLA. The objectives of the military talents in big data
should be making such talents systematically mastering the skills related to the
military data analysis, such as distributed ﬁle system (HDFS), redundant and efﬁ-
cient low-cost big data storage technology, new database technology (key database,
column database, diagram database and ﬁle database, etc.), heterogeneous data
fusion technology, distribution non-relational big data theory and processing
technology, big data indexing technology and big data movement, backup, copy
and other technologies. The talents should be big data management engineer able to
complete the big data management of the platforms from the civil database to the
military database, from the data collected individually to space data. Big data
analysis techniques include data mining, machine learning and other artiﬁcial
intelligence technologies, including association rule mining, neural network,
genetic algorithm, pattern recognition, regression prediction model, time series
analysis and cluster analysis.

2.2
Joint Operational Data Security Level—Set a Joint
Operation Data Crew
Joint operations focus on data, while operational data are the basis of operations and
decision making and the blood of the system. The joint operations depend on data.
Without data, information-based operations are empty talks only. Data are “blood”
of a variety of command information systems and equipment, a main form con-
stituting information ﬂow of the joint battleﬁeld and a “bond” for all arms and
battleﬁeld spaces. So, the importance of the data is self-evident. The President Xi
has issued a data engineering construction plan to make clear the overall planning
and development thinking in the next step. The combat data project has been
developed for over 20 years with certain degree of basic data scale, but with the
in-depth understanding on joint operations, current combat data are far from
meeting the needs of joint operations and there is a long way to go for cultivating
operational data staff.
2.3
Military Decision Making and Command Level—Set
Big Data Application Courses for Postgraduate Students
for Special Degree
The future war will be the global multi-dimensional joint operations featuring a
system against another system, and the entire army will face the problem of
transformation and upgrading. The degree of the master in the information of the
battleﬁeld environment, enemy, friend and our army decides the result of a war. The
data come from the army, and the army uses the data, so the army needs data more
urgently. Today, in the peacetime, the PLA produces massive data everyday and the
volume of the data will become larger in the future wars. How to grasp these
massive data and how to analyze, extract and understand the valuable information
are the cores to win an information war. In order to quickly cultivate high-level,
compound military command talent and keep up with the trend of the times, it is
recommended that the big data theory and application courses should be set for
military postgraduate education (covering four respects: military command, military
political work, military logistics and military equipment).
In the talent cultivation program, big data application courses can be set as
public basic courses or elective courses with 2–3 credits in 30–50 h each. The
course content is divided into two parts: theoretical part and practice part.

2.3.1
Contents of Theory
(1) Concept of big data: the concept of the big data is inevitable historically, 4-V
characteristics of big data, relationship between big data and cloud computing/
internet of things and difference between big data and large-scale/massive data.
(2) Applications of big data: Baidu search, real-time hot spots of navigation,
“November 11” shopping festival of Taobao, full-process interpretation of
killing Osama bin Laden, etc.
(3) Big data analysis technology: a technology of ﬁnding rules from the big data,
usually composed of three links: data preparation, regular exploration and
visual representation [5]. The core of the rule is data mining technology,
including clustering analysis, correlation analysis, prediction model, timing
model and abnormal trend discovery, which may be analyzed with a variety of
statistical analysis software such as SAS, SPSS and Statistica.
2.3.2
Contents of Practice
(1) Determine the topic: clear demand and write the task book.
(2) Data collection and preprocessing: according to the topic, collect high-quality
data and conduct data processing and sorting.
(3) Exploratory data analysis: big data analysis of the data usually reaches PB level
or above, so it is hard to reach the goal and ﬁnd the role of the data by a selected
model. Generally, we can ﬁnd the possible rule only if we use the amount of
features and other methods through description statistics, statistical graphics
rendering, a variety of forms of ﬁtting and a variety of pattern associations and
some other means.
(4) Veriﬁcation of model: make veriﬁcation and analysis on the selected model and
the results; generally statistical inference is made for reliability and accuracy of
the selected model through the mathematical statistics on the basis of the
speciﬁc knowledge to test whether the decision information from the model is
sufﬁcient and credible.

Abstract Because of the special life experience, the ex-servicemen are important
human resources. The perfect archives management of the ex-serviceman archives
is essential to the use of talents and the protection of rights and interests. Combined
with the survey of ex-servicemen archives management in some region, to analyze
the status of ex-serviceman at the present stage of China’s archives management,
put forward to establish and perfect the ex-servicemen archives management reg-
ulations, management system will be included in the National Archives of
ex-servicemen archives management according to law and legal system and the use
of the channel, a clear management subject, clear responsibilities and other related
rights the strategy, in order to provide reference for the improvement in China’s
demobilized military personnel archives management.

Introduction
In any country with military force in the world, there are a large number of
ex-servicemen. Because they have been exercising, studying, working and living in
the army for many years with special experience, their personal qualities in all
aspects are at a higher level and they are rare important human resources and an
important force in national construction. The archives of the ex-servicemen are the
historical records that reﬂect the thoughts, work and abilities of the ex-servicemen
in the service of the army. It is the important basis for the local government and
relevant authorities to examine, understand, resettle and manage the ex-servicemen.
It is the basic certiﬁcate of the vital interests of the ex-servicemen and an important
part of the national archives. The quality of the management and use is an important
factor for social harmony and stability. Therefore, the ex-serviceman archives with

complete management and use mechanism in line with social demands are
undoubtedly a valuable asset of our country.
With the development of the national economy the need for national defense
construction in the time of the information, Chinese government still implements
compulsory military service system, but the source structure, job requirements and
some other conditions have undergone great changes and the situation of
ex-servicemen becomes more complicated and diverse than ever. These persons
contribute their own youth and strength to national defense, while the army also
provides them with the opportunity to exercise, learn and improve, and takes high
cost for cultivating talents for some technical positions or special jobs. After
retirement, the ex-serviceman archives are important basic references and certiﬁ-
cates for them to ﬁnd the right positions, enjoy the beneﬁts, maximize their
potential and enhance their ability to continue contributing to the country.
Therefore, a perfect ex-serviceman archives management mechanism is essential.
2
Status Quo of Archives Management of Ex-servicemen
in China
China’s ex-serviceman archives management should be an important part of our
archives works. However, in the CNKI database, if we search the keywords
“ex-servicemen” and “archives management,” we cannot ﬁnd relevant theoretic
studies from 1994 until 2016 and most of the contents we ﬁnd will be limited to the
issues when using the archives of ex-servicemen, such as how to ﬁnd archives to
help solve the requirements of ex-servicemen with the archives; there is no relevant
published special work in this ﬁeld, and there is no clear regulation on the China’s
ex-serviceman archives management in China. From the conditions in different
cities, in most of the cities, the ex-serviceman archives are basically scattered in a
variety of management units or authorities at all levels and managed with traditional
manual physical methods so as to cause extreme inconvenience in the use of
ex-serviceman archives.
2.1
Incomplete Regulations and System
The regulations and system for ex-serviceman archives management need to be
further improved. That is the major reason for unclear duty division of archives
management of a large number of ex-servicemen.
Article 14 of the “Regulations on the Arrangement of Retired Soldiers” pro-
mulgated in China in 2011 stipulates that “the troops of the ex-serviceman shall
transfer their archives to the resettling place’s government at the county level or
above at the time of retiring in accordance with the relevant national provisions of
242
C. Zhang

the archives management.” Article 15 also points out that, “the archives of the
ofﬁcers self-employed and those arranged shall b handled by the ex-serviceman
authority at the resettling place g in accordance with the relevant national provisions
of the archives management, and the archives of the retired and supported soldiers
shall be handed over to the service management unit from the ex-serviceman set-
tlement authority at resettling place.” There is also a clause in current regulations of
management of archives of ofﬁcers of the PLA: “Once an ofﬁcer is decided to be
retired, his archives will be transferred to the ex-serviceman ofﬁcer work ofﬁce of
provincial military region (garrison area) at the resettling place” and then to
employer or talent communication center for keeping and other matters. This is a
root cause for the diversiﬁcation and uncertainty of management authority of
ex-serviceman archives! This means that the ex-serviceman archives will go
through two transfers and be handled by two units at least. Let alone rare
ex-servicemen arranged by the government, the years of experience has proved that
the loss or damage of archives always appears in the transfer link and most of the
ex-servicemen cannot meet conduits for work arrangement, especially for those
from rural areas whose archives will be distributed to street ofﬁces and township
governments mostly and rarely managed according to regulations strictly.
Due to the imperfect laws and regulations, the uncertainty of management
authority, there is no principle to implement or track to follow for ex-serviceman
archives management. First, due to the lack of legal support for the security of
archival entities, the authenticity, reliability and uniqueness of the contents of the
archives cannot be effectively guaranteed. Secondly, there are no institutional
regulations and constraints for the collection, custody, protection, use, transfer and
other archives management behaviors. According to the research, if the leaders of
the local authority attach importance to this matter and are willing to spend money,
the ex-serviceman archives are managed well and valuable here; otherwise, the
ex-serviceman archives may be cannot be searched. As to the ofﬁcial document
released to third party, there are different understandings and practices. Some
documents are released in the name of People’s Armed Force Department, some in
the name of Military Department, some in the name of Conﬁdentiality Room and
some in the name of Archives Room; some is conﬁrmed by seal and some by
signature of relevant leader [1].
2.2
Prominent Conﬂict Between Distributive Management
Model and the Service for Utilization
At present, China’s ex-serviceman archives generally are transferred and ﬁled with
the ex-servicemen. In most of the districts/counties, the ex-serviceman archives are
reviewed by the ex-serviceman resettlement ofﬁce of Civil Affairs Bureau. If the
conditions for resettlement are met, the ex-serviceman archives are transferred to
the receiving unit; if the ex-servicemen choose self-employment, the ex-serviceman
Research on the Status Quo of Archives Management of …
243

archives are handed over to Human Resources and Social Security Bureau; if the
ex-servicemen came from rural areas, the ex-serviceman archives will be handed to
the People’s Armed Force Department of different levels after kept by the Civil
Affairs Bureau for one year; after the ex-serviceman ofﬁcer archives have been
transferred to local ex-serviceman ofﬁcer work ofﬁce, the ex-serviceman archives
for these ofﬁcers arranged by the government will ﬂow the employers and the
ex-serviceman archives of those self-employed will be managed by the third party
or local talent exchange and service center [2]. This decentralized management is
easy to cause the prevarication at the time of search for unspeciﬁed management
authority and diverse management authorities and links. As a consequence, many
ex-servicemen cannot ﬁnd their archives and the authorities in charge when needing
the archives.
With the national economic development, the gradual enhancement of national
defense construction, the environment and conditions of resettlement and
employment of ex-servicemen have been improved gradually and the preferential
policies and measures have been perfected step by step. The volume of query,
consultation and transfer of ex-serviceman archives increases by years; there are
many changes of local administrative zoning and the management authorities of the
ex-serviceman archives; the ex-serviceman archives managed by relevant authori-
ties of all levels involve a large time span, the number of ex-serviceman archives
are increasing year by year and the search and use of ex-serviceman archives
become more frequent than before. All these will affect the success rate of archives
search, and the pressure on the archives managers of authorities of different levels is
also obvious.
2.3
Big Gap of Management Levels
There is not an express regulation for management and the management authority is
not clear, there is special sustainable fund or capital, the construction of archives
management team is absent and lagging behind other ﬁelds, and more conditions
like professional management personnel and technical standards need to be met. For
instance, at the keeping place, there is no clear construction standard; there is no a
uniﬁed standard format for archives boxes and bags; the repair of damaged archives
needs a technical reference; the archives protection measures are not uniform;
archives storage period is not clear and so on. Disordered management and non-
standard and nonmatching software and hardware cause the complicated and slow
search and even result in the damage, missing or loss of ex-serviceman archives
sometimes. For example, some policies granted by the government cannot be
implemented for the absence of evidence of archives sometimes. This not only
brings extreme negative impact on the harmony and stability of the society, but also
affects the social contribution and social status (such as reliability and authentica-
tion) of ex-serviceman archives.
244
C. Zhang

2.4
High Risk of Archival Information Security
The contents of the archives of the ex-servicemen involve a lot of respects, related
to the conﬁdential matters of the country and the army sometimes. The regulations
on the military archives management have expressly stipulated that the relevant
materials involved in military secrecy cannot be included into personal archives, but
the retired soldiers came from different positions in different services in different
periods; there are still some conﬁdential matters related to the country and the army.
Therefore, the problems like decentralized and disorderly management of physical

may
cause

3
Strategy for Development of Ex-serviceman Archive
Management in the New Period
Currently, Chinese government is comprehensively promoting the construction of
urbanization, facilitation of overall urban and rural planning and implementation of
various livelihood policies so as to cause the surge in the demand for ex-serviceman
archives. Satisfaction of growing needs of using different archives is not only the
requirements of national economic construction and an important content of peo-
ple’s livelihood construction, but also a way to solve social contradictions and
safeguard the social stability.
3.1
Establish and Improve the Regulations
on the Ex-servicemen Archives Management
To establish and improve the regulations on the ex-servicemen archives manage-
ment are a basic condition for ex-servicemen archives management.
We should actively make centralized management of ex-serviceman archives in
accordance with the regulations of “Archives Law of the People’s Republic of
China” on centralized management of national archives.
The relevant work cannot be facilitated without speciﬁc management authority
and fund provider (or duty and interest). We can ﬁnd in the practices in many areas;
the uniﬁed handover of ex-serviceman archives for centralized management shows
a well effect [3] which not only makes the ex-serviceman archives resorted, kept
and used at professional level, but also enhances the authentication of the
ex-serviceman archives use. The ex-serviceman archives must be handed by Civil
Affairs Bureau of the city/county to local archives ofﬁce with relevant handover
procedure; the archives ofﬁce will not accept any ex-serviceman archives submitted
by the ex-serviceman himself or in other circumstances. Once the ex-serviceman
Research on the Status Quo of Archives Management of …
245

archives have been handed over to the archives ofﬁce, the use may be according to
relevant provisions of “Archives Law” and the “Regulations on the Implementation
of the Archives Law.”
In contrast, you can also refer to some other countries on the ex-servicemen
archives management approaches. In the USA, the ex-serviceman archives are
permanently preserved in the national archives, free of charge for the involved
persons and their families [4]; on the one hand, the archives are not easy to lose and
conﬁdential contents are safe and easy to ﬁnd when the government needs to use
(especially for the reserve of some special talents); the Ministry of Defense Civil
Affairs Department, through the establishment of an automatic archives system with
the National Personnel Management Ofﬁce, introduces the personal situations of the
ex-servicemen to national government departments or private companies. This is
conducive to the use of talent [5].
3.2
Establish and Improve the Standard System
of Ex-serviceman Archives Management
The ex-serviceman archives are the predecessor of the ex-serviceman archives,
which are formed based on the recruits’ materials submitted at the time of joining
the army. Therefore, we may complete the ex-serviceman archives management by
taking the reference of method of service archives management.
According to China’s “Military Service Law,” the annual conscription is one of
the important tasks of local governments. For the selection of recruits, the estab-
lishment of strict, high standards of recruit archives is one of the important and
necessary links. Local governments may establish a corresponding recruits archives
system, strictly according to the requirements of standardization and digitalization
for future reference and conscription work performance evaluation; most of the
soldiers will return to the original places when they leave the army, so the
ex-serviceman archives taken over maybe match the recruit archives.
With the help of information technology, we should establish a sound electronic
archives team, to achieve a seamless delivery and operation system of physical
archives
and
electronic
archives:
recruit’s
materials ! serviceman
archives ! ex-serviceman archives.

Conclusion
In China, the ex-servicemen are a large group with high comprehensive quality as a
whole. In particular, those people who just left the army are in the prime of life as
the backbone in the national construction. Inclusion of ex-serviceman archives in
the legal management and legal use channel, clear management authority and
246
C. Zhang

positive push for ex-serviceman archives management help standardized profes-
sional management of ex-serviceman archives, ensure the security of the physical
archives and information contained therein, make search and use easy and reﬂect
the value of archives. All these are signiﬁcant for effective protection of legal
interest of ex-servicemen, well grasp of national defense potential, pertinent social
defense mobilization and educational activities, enhancement of social recognition
of archival work, etc.

The Research on Task Unit Workload
of Civil Aircraft Flight Operation
Xueli He, Lin Ding, Chongchong Miao and Lijing Wang
Abstract The paper aimed at studying the unit workload of civil aircraft ﬂight
operation task, and studying and analyzing the inﬂuence of the ﬂight experience and
ﬂight stage on the single-task workload. Firstly, the less experienced and experi-
enced pilots were chosen as the assessment objects to get the single-task workload
so as to analyze the inﬂuence of the ﬂight experience on the task workload. Then,
the pilots were used as the assessment objects, and the objective assessment method
was used for assessing the operation single-task workloads under different ﬂight
phases so as to analyze the inﬂuence of the ﬂight phase on the operation single task.
The results indicated the ﬂight experience didn’t inﬂuence the task workload, and
the task workload values under different ﬂight phases were greatly differed, and the
workload values were ranked from high to low as follows: approach stage, takeoff
stage, climb stage and cruise stage. The analysis results of the inﬂuences of the
operation task unit workload, ﬂight experience and ﬂight stage on the task unit load
value could provide basis for studying the pilot’s workload.

Introduction
The workload is deﬁned as the work amount undertaken in a unit time. The heavier
the work amount is, the higher the workload will be. Lysaght et al. [1] proposed in
1989 that the workload comprises of three aspects, i.e., work amount, time con-
sumption and operator’s subjective psychological experience. Hart [2] proposed in
1991 that the workload comprises of the combination of some speciﬁc operators

and different designed missions. Differed by work natures, the workload can be
classiﬁed as the physical workload and the mental workload [3]. The task demand
(task load) is determined by the task quantity to be executed, the necessary attention
and the time for use [4]. Hilburn and Jorna [5] described the relationship between
the task load and the mental load as follows: The task load is the requirement on the
operator proposed by the task itself, and the mental load is the operator’s objective
experience to the task requirement.
Because the periods and application ﬁelds studied by the work prediction model
are different, a plurality of workload prediction models based on task are proposed.
To carry out the workload prediction model based on task, the task unit attributes
(task load value and operation time) have to be conﬁrmed at ﬁrst.
The methods for conﬁrming the task unit load values are also differed in different
prediction models. In the task analysis/work load model [6], the expert assessment
method is used and the assessment of the task unit load value is carried out by using
the objective assessment tables from 1 to 7, but indicated by the load value data, the
objective assessment value is secondarily processed, and the load value is relative.
In the calculation model for the multi-source task load [7], to the single-task
demanding unit, the load of each task is evaluated as automatic (D = 0), simple
(D = 1) and difﬁcult (D = 2). In the task load model of the human–machine
interactive design and analysis system [8], the demand value of every attribute
under the task unit is evaluated as 0 or 1 to represent the task unit demand. The load
values of the CMRM and TLM (the task loading model) are obtained by the direct
evaluation method and are also relative. The comparison analysis of the absolute
values cannot be carried out between the relative value and the actual value, but
only the relativity analysis can be carried out. The paper aims at getting the absolute
value of the task unit workload. Thus, the operation task unit load value of the paper
uses the expert assessment method proposed by TAWL (Task Analysis/Workload
methodology) and assesses the task unit load with the objective assessment table of
0–10 marks. No secondary processing is given to the assessment results which are
directly used as the database of the task unit load values.
With the objective assessment method, the paper gets the task unit workload
value of the civil aircraft ﬂight operation and studies and analyzes the inﬂuences of
the ﬂight experience and ﬂight stage on the single-task load.

Task Unit Load Value
2.1
Assessment Method
The classiﬁcation of the ﬂight operation task units is obtained by combining with the
human attributes and task attributes. The objective assessment method is used for the
task load assessment to the task unit (Table 1) obtained by classiﬁcation. The mark
from 1 to 10 of the task load is given according to the task difﬁculty [9]. 1 mark means
the task load is very low, and 10 mark means the task load is very high.

2.2
Subject
The subjects for the experiment are divided into two groups: One group comprises
of 18 students who are just graduated from the ﬂight colleges, and the plane for the
ﬂight training is Cessna 172, and their average ﬂight time is about 250 h, and the
other group comprises of 15 experienced pilots, and their planes are A320 and
B737, and their average ﬂight time is about 12,000 h.
2.3
Data Processing
At ﬁrst, the results of the objective assessment of the operation single-task workload
values obtained by the objective assessment of the pilots of different experience are
averaged, and also the operation single-task load values under different ﬂight stages
are also averaged, and then, the Pearson relativity is used for carrying out the
relativity analysis to the single-task load under different ﬂight experience, and at
last, the linear regression analysis method is used for the regression analysis of the
two sets of data, and then, the coefﬁcient relationship between different ﬂight
experience is obtained.
2.4
Result Analysis
The averaged operation single-task load values obtained by the objective assess-
ment of the 18 less experienced pilots and the 15 experienced pilots are used as the
database of the single-task load values of the study, which is shown in Table 2, and
then, the Pearson relativity is used for analyzing the relativity of the two sets of
data, and the analysis results show the relativity of the ﬂight task load obtained by
the assessment of different ﬂight experience is not high, and the relevant coefﬁcient
is 0.942 (p < 0.05). Indicated by the regression coefﬁcient table shown in Table 3,
because the constant is 0.264, thus, it can be believed that their coefﬁcient rela-
tionship directly is 1.002, i.e., there is no deviation in value; thus, the inﬂuence of
the ﬂight experience on the ﬂight task load is little.

At ﬁrst, the pilots of same experience level are chosen, and then, the objective
assessment of the operation single-task load under different ﬂight stages is carried
out, and then, the obtained results are averaged; then, the Pearson relativity is used
for the relativity analysis to the single-task load under different ﬂight stages, and
then, the linear regression analysis method is used for the regression analysis to the
obtained data, and the coefﬁcient relationship under different ﬂight stages is
obtained.
3.4
Result Analysis
The single-task load values of the operation under different ﬂight stages obtained by
the pilots’ objective assessment are shown in Table 4.
The relativity analysis results of the single-task load of unit under different ﬂight
stages and the comprehensive objective assessment are shown in Table 5. The
relativity results show there are the high relativity (P < 0.05) of the single-task load
of operation and the comprehensive objective assessment under the ﬂight stages.
Indicated by the regression analysis results in Table 6, the single-task loads under
different ﬂight stages and the constants under the single-task load regression are all
lower than 0.5; thus, it is believed that the factors of the inﬂuences of the ﬂight
stages on the single-task load of ﬂight are as follows: takeoff coefﬁcient 0.834,

Discussion
All of the prediction models are required and introduced in the study of the task unit
attributes. Because the task unit attributes include the task load value and the task
operation time, not all models study the two aspects, such as SPOM (simulation to
predict operator workload in a command system) which only analyzes the operation
time of the task unit, because the method only predicts the workload by time
relationship. The conﬁrmation methods of the task unit load values are also differed
in different prediction models, e.g., the load values of CMRM and TLM are only
relative values and cannot carry out the comparison analysis of absolute values with
the actual value; thus, the paper aims at getting the absolute value of the task unit
load value, and the task unit load value of the operation of the paper uses the expert
assessment method proposed by TAWL and doesn’t secondarily process the
assessment results which are directly used as the database of the task unit load
values. Indicated by data in Table 2, the load values of the pilots of different
experience are basically same, and the load deviation generated by experience
under the normal ﬂight status can be neglected. Indicated by the results in Table 4,
the obtained loads are not high in general, and the pilots’ load in the normal ﬂight
status is proper, but the loads are high in the takeoff stage and the approach and
landing stages; thus, particular attention shall be paid when driving in the takeoff
stage and the approach and landing stage.

Conclusion
Targeting to the A320 operation program and combining with the human’s infor-
mation processing channel analysis and operator’s human–machine interface
analysis, the paper gets the classiﬁcation of the operation task units applicable for
the civil aircraft under sensing, cognition and response. Based on the obtained
results of task classiﬁcation, and according to the 33 pilots’ objective assessment,
the paper analyzes the inﬂuence of the ﬂight experience on the single-task load, and
on the other hand, combining with the 18 pilots’ assessment results, the paper
analyzes and studies the inﬂuences of different ﬂight stages on the single-task load.
Results indicate the inﬂuence of the ﬂight experience on the ﬂight load is little, and
the inﬂuences of different ﬂight stages on the single-task load of operation are high
and the high relativity exists. Also the paper gives out the coefﬁcients of the
inﬂuences of different ﬂight stages on the single-task load of ﬂight.
The results obtained by the paper can provide basis for further studying the
pilots’ workload; however, the objective assessment of the paper depends on the
pilots’ objective experience and knowledge; thus, it is inﬂuenced by the pilots’
personal factor. To solve the problem, the quantity of the pilots is increased in the
paper to ensure the accuracy of the result in a certain degree, but how to further
improve the model accuracy is still to be deeply studied.

Classiﬁcation and Cause Analysis
of Human Errors in the Flight Accidents
of International Modern Fighter Planes
Yan Lyu, Yi Xiao and Qianxiang Zhou
Abstract Most of the current aviation accidents are caused by human errors.
Analyzing the types of human errors, causes, etc. is the important basis for ﬁnding
out the defects in the system and making the prevention measures. The prior
classiﬁcation generally classiﬁes the human errors or analyzes the causes from the
engineering or human ability and status, and has big defect and difﬁculty for the
active identiﬁcation of the errors in human’s cognition process stage. Based on
the HFACS error analysis model and CREAM reliability analysis method and
combining with a great amount of ﬂight accident data of the international modern
ﬁghter planes, the paper analyzes the human error causes in the ﬂight accidents of
the ﬁghter planes and proposes the relevant measures for reducing human errors
according to the analysis results. The method can be used for directing the moni-
toring and analysis of the human error events in the daily ﬂight of the air force and
improving the safety level of the ﬂight stage.

Introduction
The statistic data prove that 70–80% aviation accidents are related to human errors.
Most of the researchers analyze according to the human errors in the ﬂight accidents
or accident symptoms and cannot ensure the results to be comprehensive and
consistent. The analysis method for the pilot’s human errors is still in the devel-
opment stage at present. Based on the statistic data of the ﬂight accidents caused by
human errors in the ﬂight activities of the international modern ﬁghter planes [1],
the paper carries out the classiﬁcation of human error types, analysis of human
errors, and cause sourcing so as to provide reference for preventing ﬂight accidents
and improving ﬂight safety as well as the basis for making the prevention measures.
It hopes that the paper can be used for directing the monitoring and analysis of the
human error events in daily ﬂight, and improving the safety level of the ﬂight
activity.

Classiﬁcation Method for Human Errors of Aviation
The study of the aviation industry for human errors is started from the 1940s. With
the development of the study of human error reliability, the researchers make a
series of mature theory models from the aviation physiology and psychology,
system engineering, etc., and by combining with human’s cognition psychological
process and accident causation theory. The paper introduces the following two
classiﬁcation methods which, respectively, are the Cognitive Reliability and Error
Analysis Method (CREAM) [2] and the Human Factors Analysis and Classiﬁcation
System (HFACS) [3].
The CREAM [2] divides the human’s cognition process into the four stages of
observation, explanation, plan, and execution so as to analyze the possible corre-
sponding human errors of different cognition stages; however, the human error
mode given by the method in every stage totally depends on the designer’s personal
experience and knowledge level. The detailed causes are insufﬁcient; thus, the error
mode cannot be said to be comprehensive.
HFACS model [3] encodes the human errors of the ﬂight activity in detail and is
widely applied in the aviation accident analysis, but when the HFACS model is
used for analysis, only the ratios of all types of errors can be counted, but the deep
causes cannot be explored, which is not very meaningful for error prevention.
Thus, on the basis of considering the HFACS model and combing with the
opinions of the cognition psychology, the identiﬁcation of human errors in the ﬂight
accidents of the ﬁghter planes is carried out. In addition, combining with the
CREAM tracing analysis method, the tracing analysis is carried out to the root
causes of the ﬂight human error events of the international ﬁghter planes.

Human Error Cause Analysis and Root Cause Tracing
Method Based on Cognition Opinions
3.1
Classiﬁcation of Cognition Process
Based on the encoding of the HAFCS model to the ﬂight human errors, combining
with the four function stages of the cognition process in the CREAM and inte-
grating with the actual condition in the ﬂight activity of the ﬁghter planes, the paper
deeply analyzes the generation mechanism and psychological causes for the human
error events in the ﬂight activity of the ﬁghter planes, the results are in Table 1.
3.2
CREAM Tracing Analysis Method
Firstly, the method decomposes the events and establishes the event sequence;
secondly, according to the CREAM expansion analysis method [4], the paper
identiﬁes and analyzes the human’s cognition function sections and corresponding
invalid modes involved in each sub-event; and at last, the CREAM tracing method
[5] is used for the tracing analysis of the root cause of each sub-event to determine
the error mode of each sub-event. The tracing analysis is carried out according to
the error mode and the corresponding former cause tracing table until the root cause
of the event is found.
According to the current ﬂight human error code table and combining with
accident statistics, Huang et al. [6] reﬁned the former cause class of human errors in
the takeoff stage of the aviation ﬂight and concluded the basic factors of the
accidents into the 6 aspects including hardware information, software information,
environment, organization management, crew management, and personal status.
The former causes of the ﬂight human error event can also be correspondingly
divided into six types which become the classiﬁcation groups and are represented
by letters. Each group is further reﬁned into a plurality of former causes and differed
by numbers. The names and codes of the former types are shown in Table 2.
Every human error event can be corresponded to a stage of cognition. The error
cause corresponding to the stage is looked up according to Table 1. If the cause is
the root cause already, continuous tracing is not required; if not, the other former
causes can be continuously looked up from Table 2.

of International Modern Fighter Planes
Table 3 is based on the behaviors which directly cause the accident, and carries out
sub-event activity decomposition to the accidents relevant to human errors in the
book named as the Flight Accidents of International Modern Fighter Planes [1].
The error section (Table 1) of each event is analyzed on the basis of the cognition
reason, and the CREAM consequence former cause tracing table (Table 2) is used
for the tracing analysis of the accidents and exploring the root cause of the accident
(Table 3 selects some events for exhibition).

Analysis of Human Error Types
Based on the 138 human-error-relevant accidents of 13 models of ﬁghter planes,
which are provided by Flight accidents of international Modern Fighter Planes, the
statistic data indicate that there are 60 observation errors, which is 43.4%; 10
explanation errors, which is 7.2%; 41 plan errors, which is 29.7%; and 27 execution
errors, which is 19.6%.
Indicated by above, the observation stage owns the most cognition sections
corresponding to the human error accidents. The observation error not only relates
to the perception ability but is also inﬂuenced by environment and task. When all
factors are integrated together, the attention load is increased, and then, the error
probability increases. The pilot has sufﬁciently understood and been trained for the
task, and the errors caused by memory are few. The plan errors are mainly caused
by overload information. Most of the accidents caused by execution errors are
emergent accidents, and the causes comprise of unreasonable design, mistakes of
the ground service personnel or air management personnel, etc.
4.3
CREAM Tracing Analysis
To ﬁnd out the essential cause of the accident, the CREAM former cause-type table
(Table 2) is used for the root cause tracing analysis of 138 accidents, and some
results are exhibited in Table 3. Then, the accident root cause types are counted,
and the results are in Table 4.

Indicated by the statistics of the above table, the errors caused by personal status
is 65.2%; the errors caused by the crew resource management is 15.9%; the errors
caused by organization management is 14.5%; the errors caused by environment is
11.5%; the errors caused by hardware is 5.6%; and the errors caused by
software/information is 2.9%.
The statistic results indicate the errors caused by the software/hardware facilities
are few, which means the human errors purely caused by the mechanical failure are
gradually decreased with the development of the industrial technology, and the
errors caused by personal status are the most, wherein the pilot’s personal quality
and professional quality are the top factors, and also being inﬂuenced by the
environment, the pilot may have vertigo, blackout, spatial disorientation, etc., and
then, the human error operation is caused.
4.4
Root Cause Analysis Based on the Cognition Stage
Based on the former CREAM consequence and cause tracing table (Table 2), the
root causes causing the accidents are, respectively, counted and analyzed according
to the four stages of cognition, and the results are shown in Table 5.
Combining with the analysis of Tables 1, 2, and 5, the human errors of the
cognition section are induced together by a plurality of root causes. To the four
stages of cognition, the pilot’s personal knowledge and insufﬁcient skill are both the
primary causes for human errors. Accurate perception to the visual information is
the precondition for the pilot to execute the task. The over-high cognition load,
insufﬁcient spatial ability, unfamiliar utilization of regulations, and insufﬁcient task
training can all cause the human errors of the explanation and plan stages, and in the
execution stage, besides the heavy task information, the pilot’s overconﬁdence
inexperienced cooperation with the crew, insufﬁcient experience for emergencies,
etc. also cause the human error.
To the observation stage, the crew resource management is the secondary reason
causing the human error, e.g., the navigator does not report the radar position to the
pilot, and then, two planes are collided, etc.; thus, in the daily training, the cross-
check in the crew, team atmosphere, crew communication, etc. shall be reinforced.
To the explanation stage, the ratios of the human errors caused by the pilot
himself/herself, the personal ability of the ﬂight crew and team cooperation are
basically the same; thus, the organization management errors cannot be neglected,

and during the ﬂight task, the task content shall be clearly speciﬁed, the excellent
communication between aviation management systems shall be ensured, the ground
service and maintenance personnel shall perfect the check regulations, etc.
To the plan stage, the crew resource management is the secondary factor causing
the human error. Besides making the right decision, the crew shall also reinforce the
cooperation with ATC, e.g., the ﬁghter planes lacking of the air anti-collision
warning system shall keep well communication with ATC to make the right
decision in time.
To the execution stage, the bad physical environment or work environment can
easily cause human errors. To the inﬂuence of the environmental emergency,
besides the task regulations of the pilot training, the pilot shall also be trained for
skills and emotion control by combining with the environmental factors, and the
measures for all possible emergent conditions shall be made.

Conclusion

Experiment Study of Weight-Bearing
Walking Fatigue of Human Body Based
on ECG Signal Characteristics
Xiuyun Hao, Qianxiang Zhou and Zhongqi Liu
Abstract To discuss the judgment for the variation of the human body fatigue
under the weight-bearing walking condition and based on the characteristics of the
indexes of heart rate, heart rate variability, etc., the paper uses the LabVIEW
software to realize the preprocessing of ECG signals, detection of R wave, and
HRV analysis, which is based on conﬁrming the relativity of the ECG signal index
and human body weight-bearing fatigue. Results indicate through the analysis of
ECG characteristic indexes, with the increase of the weight-bearing walking time
and the increase of the human body fatigue, HRmean, RMSSD, HFnorm, LF/HF,
and sample entropies clearly change, wherein HRmean, HFnorm, LF/HF, and
sample entropies are sensitive to the fatigue variation, and then does the RMSSD.
The principal component analysis (PCA) method is used for establishing the ECG
comprehensive index which is the basis for judging that under the condition of the
weight-bearing walking experiment of the paper, the volunteers are clearly fatigue
in stage 3, and the fatigue is signiﬁcantly increased in stage 5.

Introduction
The human body weight-bearing walking is closely relevant to people’s life, such as
military march, worker’s weight-bearing labor work, wild survival, labor trans-
portation. People often feel fatigue because of the big load, long walking time, etc.

As the way causing human body fatigue, the weight-bearing walking can be studied
from the aspect of fatigue. There is a close relationship between the human body’s
physical fatigue and the electro-physical signals (EEG, ECG, EMG, etc.). To
walling fatigue, the ECG variation is direct; particularly, the heart rate variability
(HRV) can reﬂect the activity of the autonomic nervous system and quantitatively
assess the tension and the balance of the cardiac sympathetic nerve and pneumo-
gastric nerve. Thus, it can reﬂect the inﬂuences of the physical fatigue and mental
fatigue on the human body at the same time, and in general, the study analysis
methods are divided into four types, i.e., the time domain analysis method, the
frequency domain analysis method, the time and frequency domain analysis, and
the nonlinear analysis method, wherein the time domain analysis method and the
frequency domain analysis method are often used, and their analysis theory systems
are relatively mature.
Thus, based on the heart rate and heart rate variability, the paper discusses the
generation and variation mechanisms of the fatigue in the weight-bearing walking
process as well as the relationship between the indexes of heart rate and heart rate
variability and the fatigue of the weight-bearing walking movement through the
method of combining objective and subjective ways so as to establish the objective
judgment method for the weight-bearing walking fatigue and provide reference for
further studying the weight-bearing walking fatigue.

and do not have any anamnesis. Their physical parameters such as the resting heart
rate are not signiﬁcantly differed, and they have high understanding and coopera-
tion abilities for the experiment and can accurately express their fatigue feeling.
(2) Experiment equipment
One treadmill, one MP150 multi-conductive physical recorder, one laptop, one
bag, a plurality of weights, and a plurality of wires are used for the experiment.
(3) Setting of walking conditions
The group slope is 0o, the weight is 30% of the body weight, and the walking
speed is 7 km/h.
(4) Weight-bearing way
Backpack weight bearing.

(5) Procedures
a. The experiment purpose, ﬂow, and relevant notices of the experiment are told to
the volunteers by the work staff before the experiment. The objective fatigue
assessment table, i.e., the improved Borg measurement table (Table 1), is dis-
tributed, and the volunteers understand and are familiar with the content of the
assessment table and then ﬁll the personal information.
b. When the experiment starts, the volunteers hand their objective fatigue assess-
ment table to the work staff. The experiment is divided into seven stages of
which the time durations are, respectively, 0–1, 4–5, 8–9, 12–13, 16–17, 20–21,
and 24–25 min. Before the weight-bearing walking, the volunteers rest for
1 min, and the work staff ask the volunteers for their objective fatigue marks at
this time and record, and then collect and save 1 min of ECG data at every
3 min, and the work staff also ask the volunteers for their objective fatigue
marks at this time and record. During the whole experiment, the ECG data of 7
sections of each volunteer are collected and recorded.
(6) Data analysis method
The paper is mainly based on LabVIEW for processing and analyzing the col-
lected ECG data, including ECG signal processing, R wave detection [1, 2], and
HRV analysis [3, 4].
a. Data collection
The MP150 multi-conductive physical recorder of USA Biopac Company is
used for sampling the ECG signals at the speed of 1000 Hz. The collection time is
1 min, the collection time interval is 3 min, 7 sections of data are collected, and the
collected ECG signals are stored in the computer.
b. Signal preprocessing
The work frequency interference and the baseline drift are the most common
external interference of the ECG signals. The paper uses the method of small wave
change to ﬁlter out the baseline drift [5, 6], and the ﬁlter with resistance is designed
to ﬁlter out the 50 Hz work frequency interference [7, 8].
c. R wave detection
HRV is the little ﬂuctuation of the R wave intervals between successive beats;
thus, accurately detecting the R wave and measuring the time when the R wave
peak occurs are the key points for collecting the HRV signals. The paper uses the
method of combining the threshold and inclination rate to detect the R wave.

Result and Analysis
3.1
Objective Assessment of Fatigue
of Weight-Bearing Motion
The Borg measurement table is a method for speculating the motion strength and
has been widely applied in foreign countries for many years. The experiment uses
the modiﬁed Borg measurement table and makes detailed explanation for the
volunteers before the experiment is carried out. Figure 1 shows the objective
fatigue average evaluation condition of the volunteers in the seven experiment
stages. Indicated by Fig. 1, with the increase of time, the objective fatigue gradually
increases in the tendency of fast ﬁrst and slow second. The curve increases rapidly
from 0 to 12 in., which means the fatigue accumulation is fast, and then, the fatigue
accumulation is slow. Indicated by questionnaires, most volunteers feel breathing
quickly in the third stage (8–9 min) and feel a little fatigue; in the ﬁfth stage, most
volunteers feel very fatigue and run with sweat, and some volunteers’ electrode
plates even disconnect because of the sweat. After the end of the experiment, most
volunteers feel very fatigue.

3.2
Analysis of Heart Rate and Heart Rate Variability
The results of the time domain, frequency domain, and nonlinear index of the heart
rate and the heart rate variability are as follows (as in Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6).
Indicated by the above ﬁgures, with the increase of fatigue, the indexes of
HRmean and LF/HF tend to increase, and the indexes of RMSSD, HFnorm, and
sample entropies tend to decrease. The variation in amplitudes of the indexes of
HFmean, RMSSD, and sample entropy curves are big in the early stage of the
weight-bearing motion, which is caused because the volunteers’ bodies are in the
stage of being adaptive to the whole experiment weight-bearing condition and
motion rates and rhymes in the early stage; thus, the variations of all indexes are
high (indicated by the volunteers’ objective fatigue scoring condition), and then
with the weight-bearing motion time goes by, the motion condition is gradually
adapted, and the curve ﬂuctuation is decreased.
The relativity analysis is carried out to all indexes and the objective fatigue
degrees of the HRV experiment stage. The SPSS19 software is used for calculating
the Spearman correlation coefﬁcients, and then, the Spearman correlation coefﬁ-
cients and signiﬁcance levels of all indexes and the objective fatigue are obtained.
The results are given in Table 2.
Indicated by Table 2, the signiﬁcance levels of all indexes and the objective
fatigue are all lower than 0.05, which means there is a signiﬁcant linear relationship
among all indexes and the objective fatigue; thus, in the process of the
weight-bearing walking motion, the indexes of HRmean, RMSSD, HFnorm,
LF/HF, and sample entropies of the HRV sequence can all reﬂect the volunteers’
fatigue degree, wherein the signiﬁcance levels of the HRmean, HFnorm, LF/HF,
and sample entropies are all lower than 0.01, and the signiﬁcance levels of RMSSD
and the objective fatigue are between 0.01 and 0.03.
Thus, it can be indicated that in the processing of weight-bearing walking, the
HRmean, HFnorm, LF/HF, sample entropies, and the objective fatigue have high
relativity and are more sensitive to fatigue, and then is the sensitivity of RMSSD to
fatigue.

Because the HRmean, RMSSD, HFnorm, LF/HF, and sample entropy indexes
clearly change with the prolongation of the weight-bearing walking, based on the
ﬁve indexes, the principal component analysis method is used for establishing the
comprehensive assessment indexes.
The SPSS19 software is used for principal component analysis of the ECG
signals, and after being analyzed by the main ingredient analysis method, the

accumulated contribution rate of the ﬁrst main ingredient reaches 87.87%; thus, the
ﬁrst main ingredient is taken as the target index of characteristic extraction. The
comprehensive index is:
Y ¼ 0:97367 HRmean þ 0:939548 RMSSD þ 0:959978 HFnorm
 0:825 LF=HF þ 0:980062 SampEn
ð1Þ
The values of HRmean, RMSSD, HFnorm, LF/HF, and sample entropies are
substituted into formula (1), and then, the physical comprehensive index curve of
the weight-bearing walking shown in Fig. 7 is obtained. Indicated by the ﬁgure, the
change of the initial ECG comprehensive index value is big, which is caused by the

volunteers’ bodies that are in the stage of being adaptive to the whole experiment
weight-bearing condition and motion rate and rhyme in the early stage; thus, the
change is big. From the third time section, the value of the ECG comprehensive
index is signiﬁcantly changed, and from the third time section, the values of the
ECG comprehensive index are lower, which reﬂects that the volunteers begin to feel
fatigue. Since the ﬁfth time section, the value of the ECG comprehensive index is
signiﬁcantly changed again, which reﬂects that the volunteers’ fatigue is increased.

Conclusions
(1) After the analysis based on the heart rate and heart rate variability, when the
volunteers are in the weight-bearing walking motion, the indexes of HRmean
and LF/HF tend to increase and the indexes of RMSSD, HFnorm, and sample
entropies tend to decrease.
(2) The indexes of HRmean, RMSSD, HFnorm, LF/HF, sample entropies, and the
objective fatigue are in linear relativity, which reﬂects the weight-bearing
motion fatigue; in the weight-bearing walking process, the indexes of HRmean,
HFnorm, LF/HF, and sample entropies are relatively sensitive to fatigue, and
then is the sensitivity of RMSSD to fatigue. Thus, the paper provides index
reference basis for further studying the weight-bearing walking fatigue.
(3) The method of principal component analysis is used for establishing the ECG
comprehensive index which is used for judging that in the weight-bearing
walking experiment condition of the paper, the volunteers are clearly fatigue in
the third stage (8–9 min), and their fatigue is increased in the ﬁfth stage (16–
17 min).
In summary, under the weight-bearing environment, the paper discusses the
variation in tendencies of the time domain, frequency domain, and nonlinear
indexes of the ECG signals during the weight-bearing walking process. The
experiment results indicate when people walk in the weight-bearing way, with the
increase of the fatigue, sometime, frequency and nonlinear indexes show the clear
variation tendencies. Through the signiﬁcance analysis to all indexes and the
objective fatigue, the study preliminarily conﬁrms the ECG signal index which can
effectively characterize the fatigue process and degree. Combined with the method
of principal component analysis, the paper establishes the ECG comprehensive
index and judges the fatigue variation with the ECG comprehensive index, which
more subjectively reﬂects the generation and deepening time sections of the
weight-bearing walking fatigue and more effectively analyzes and assesses the
variation rule of the weight-bearing walking fatigue; thus, the paper provides rel-
evant basis for the work efﬁciency design of the weight-bearing walking system.

Based on EEG Signal
Haiyan Niu, Shunwang Xiao, Qianxiang Zhou and Yaofeng He
Abstract The degree of special vehicle’s automation and intelligent is getting
higher and higher. The efﬁcient integration of operator and vehicle will become the
fundamental guarantee of full efﬁciency. The operator’s ability is the core element
of the special vehicle capacity, but the operator’s ability is limited. The subjective
evaluation and objective physiological evaluation are combined in this paper. The
operator gives the degree of mental fatigue through the narration after completing
the task; at the same time, the operator’s EEG signal is got. The mapping relation of
EEG signal and mental fatigue degree is set up, and then the evaluation mathe-
matical model of operator’s workload based on EEG is built. This evaluation model
can provide technical support for the new style special vehicles’ design and
development.

special vehicles, and information perception and control ability are limited, and are
the fundamental basis of design. Mental load of personnel is forecasted and eval-
uated. On the one hand, the constraintswere put forward on the usability from the
angle of personnel ability. On the other hand, in the design process, the implicit

The Evaluation Method of Mental Load
The mental load refers to the workload of mental activity that is borne by personnel
in unit time and is mainly shown as information acquisition, tracking, decision,
memory, and other workloads without the obvious physical power. Evaluate the
personnel mental load of special vehicles, make their mental load in a better state in
operation process in order to provide the basis for design of intelligent manipulation
interface of special vehicle. The mental load evaluation is not general method of
direct measurement, and only adopts the indirect method. According to the work-
load, evaluate the internal characteristics and applicable range, and generally divide
into four categories: subjective evaluation method, elevation method of main task,
evaluation method of auxiliary task, and evaluation method of physiological index.
The subjective evaluation method refers to the subjective statement mode after the
operating experience of personnel, including Cooper-Harper evaluation method,
NASA-TLX subjective evaluation method; the elevation method of main task refers
to calculate in turn the mental load through evaluating the performance indexes of
personnel operation, including the single indicator evaluation method and the
multi-criterion evaluation method. The evaluation method of auxiliary task means
that personnel uses the remaining resources to complete the auxiliary task and to
express the main task mental load, and the design of auxiliary task is based on the
characteristics of main task. The evaluation method of physiological index mainly
includes the heart rate variation, electroencephalogram, breath, blood pressure,
human body temperature [1, 2].
For electroencephalogram (event-related potential), the change of electroen-
cephalogram is sensitive to the mental load. It means that a series of transient brain
potential change can be recorded in scalp when a brain conducts the information
processing for a discrete event. For example, P300 is regarded as the sensitive and
meaningful index that can reﬂect the information processing activities and refers to
a positive potential that is recorded in about 300 ms after a stimulus event. This can
reﬂect the utilization degree of information processing resources. According to its
change, quantitatively evaluate the workload of main operation [3].
This paper adopts the combination of subjective evaluation and evaluation
method of objective physiological index, provides the mental fatigue degree
through a topic comment after the personnel completes the operation task, extracts
the personnel electroencephalogram, and establishes the model of the mapping
relationship between electroencephalogram change features and mental fatigue
degree. Its purpose is to express the people’s subjective fatigue feelings in an
objective way, to further establish the evaluation model of mental load based on
electroencephalogram, and to provide the technical support for mental load eval-
uation in the design and development course of a new generation of special
vehicles.
Overall plan: Test the person’s electrooculogram in the course of a person
observation and targeting, record the people’s fatigue degree of attention, according
to the score value of subjective evaluation scale on the fatigue degree and to the
280

theory of physiological signal processing, establish a scatter-fatigue scores drawing
of continuous signal, adopt the data ﬁtting and other modeling approach, establish
the model of the mapping relationship between electroencephalogram change fea-
tures and mental fatigue degree, and put forward the threshold value of brain wave
fatigue.

Test Schematic Design
The selection of tested people: Select 40 operators of a special vehicle, with good
eyesight, without fatigue in body and mind.
The selection of test task: Rely on a certain type of training simulation equip-
ment, and set 4 items of people’s daily training tasks as the test task.
The selection of test equipment: Adopt Neuroscan electroencephalogram record
equipment, with the sampling frequency of 256 Hz, conduct 32-lead record, and
adopt the standard record of 10–20 electrode lead positioning that is calibrated by
the International Electroencephalogram Society.
The design of test steps: ①Test training, through pre-experiment adaption and
familiar with testing procedures; ②Conduct the resting evaluation of tested people,
record 5 min electroencephalogram as a state before mental load producing; ③The
tested people complete the speciﬁed operation tasks are subject to a subjective
fatigue inquiry every 2 min; the test task is over in 30 min, and electroen-
cephalogram is recorded in the meanwhile.
Test data record: When people’s mental state changes, the recorded electroen-
cephalogram mode will change accordingly, so people’s fatigue degree can be
estimated through recording and analyzing the electroencephalogram in the course
of performing a task. In general, in the course of change from the normal state to the
fatigue state, the slow wave increases, and the fast wave reduces. Four frequency
bands that are the most commonly used are recorded in test, namely, d(0.5–4 Hz),
h(4–8 Hz), a(8–13 Hz), b(13–25 Hz) [4].
Four kinds of waveforms are recorded in the test:
(1) a-wave frequency 8–13 Hz, wave amplitude 20–100 lV. It is formed because
the excitement and inhibition of nonspeciﬁc subthalamic nucleus under the
cerebral cortex start the synchronism of electric activity of a large number of
nerve cells in cortex. a-wave is more in the condition of closing eyes in quiet,
and is the most in occipital region, but it disappears in the condition of emo-
tional tension, thinking about a problem, or opening eyes.
(2) b-wave frequency 14–30 Hz, wave amplitude 5–20 lV. Its frequency is more
than the frequency of a-wave, so it is called the fast wave. It is signiﬁcant at
frontal lobe and parietal lobe. When the emotional tension b-wave increases,
wave amplitude rises. b-wave amplitude is higher than a normal value, which is
an expression of cortical excitability rising.

281

(3) h-wave frequency 4–7 Hz, wave amplitude 100–150 lV. This is an expression
of inhibition state of central nervous system. When an adult is sleepy, h-wave is
visible generally.
(4) d-wave frequency is less than 4 Hz, and wave amplitude is more than 200 lV.
The frequency of h-wave and d-wave is lower than the frequency of a-wave, so
they are called the slow wave.
According to the characteristics of four kinds of waveforms, it can be found that
b-wave mainly participates in people’s thinking activity and is closely relevant with
people’s cognition, memory, and attention. In this article, the brain fatigue and
mental load are researched through the change of b-wave.

Data Processing and Analysis
(1) Test data preprocessing: Electroencephalogram preprocessing mainly refers to
artifact processing. Directly delete the signal spectrum with a great ﬂuctuation,
remove the power frequency interference, etc., through band-pass ﬁltering,
keep the useful signal spectrum, and use the independent component analysis to
remove the vertical electrooculogram and the horizontal electrooculogram.
(2) Fatigue energy calculation: Intercept the b-wave signal before fatigue (resting)
and in the course of fatigue, as shown in Fig. 1. According to the method of
signal processing, calculate its energy. After normalization processing on
energy, gain the fatigue energy points. According to the fatigue evaluation
results, gain the evaluation results of mental load. Calculation process is as
follows:
①According to 1/3 frequency octave method, calculate the octave spec-
trum. According to the frequency domain characteristics of b-wave
signal, select the octave analytical method as the processing method of
b-wave frequency domain analysis. According to the formula (1), cal-
culate b-wave energy spectrum after preprocessing and Fourier trans-
form, namely, octave spectrum.

④Record and sort out the questionnaire results of subjective fatigue feel-
ing, and record the Borg scale value of the subjective fatigue evaluation
index of each tested people in the course of test.

(3) Eliminating the invalid data: Calculate the fatigue energy of each testee in a
resting state and in the course of performing a task, normalize it (energy in the
course of performing a task/energy in resting state), at the same time get the
energy values of different frequency bands to obtain the ratio, and inspect and
eliminate the data, mainly including the following methods:
①Electrooculogram data with the bigger span of subjective score value
should be eliminated directly. It is the result of testees’ not serious
attitude and lying about the fatigue score value in the course of test,
②Use the Pauta criterion method to eliminate too big or too small energy
values that are obtained after calculating.
4
The Establishment for Evaluation Model
Eliminate the abnormal data and retain the effective data, combine with Borg value
to obtain a average normalized energy values E that are corresponding to 1–10
scores, respectively, conduct the curve ﬁtting of fatigue energy and subjective
feeling result, and select the optimal fatigue evaluation model according to the
related coefﬁcient. Researches show that the energy contrast between different
rhythms of electrooculogram before the mental fatigue and after the mental fatigue,
the energy percentage of low-frequency stage (h + a) increases, and the energy
percentage of high-frequency stage reduces. The combination of these character-
istics can be used in the monitoring of mental fatigue. The energy ratio of two

An Improved Clone Selection Algorithm
for Set Optimization
Liguan Pei, Kehai Dong, Yanhui Tang, Bo Zhang and Chang Yu
Abstract An improved CSA is put forward based on the shortcomings of tradi-
tional CSA which cannot meliorate set well. First, antibody cleaning is added, and
antibody selection is improved. This step is very important for the process of set
optimization, and antibody cleaning’s aim is to delete the similar antibody.
Antibody selection is to perform the local search to cleaned antibody set, and the
process of total optimal solution searching is deleted. Then, the objective function
of the antibody set is made to judge set’s quality which does not exist in the
traditional method. Each time the local search is completed, the afﬁnity of antibody
set needs to be calculated, and the several times iterative calculations need to be
compared. In addition, the process of best individual selection is cut out, and the
quality of analysis is increased. At last, the experiment and simulation prove that
the improved CSA is effective.

Introduction
The optimization problems can be classiﬁed as the optimal solution and the optimal
set from the aspect of analysis result. Many optimization methods have been pro-
posed, such as the simulated annealing algorithm, the particle swarm optimization,
and the clone selection algorithm (CSA). CSA which can do a good full-scale
search, keeps population diversity, and has great interaction between antibodies, has
been developing rapidly [1, 2]. Thus, CSA is necessary to be analyzed to exploit
more of its performance.
CSA which ﬂourishes on the basis of the clonal selection theory which is put
forward by Burnet in 1959 is analyzed from two aspects by scholars [3]. On the one

hand, CSA is combined with other theories or systems to better solve problems. For
example, Niu [4] proposed land use zoning system on the basis of GIS and CSA,
and Zhang [5] did an association between Gaussian mixture model and CSA. On
the other hand, some detailed procedures of CSA have been improved to realize
more satisfying performance. For example, Gao [6] adopted differential evolution
algorithm to avoid prematurity phenomenon of CSA, Yet the past researches are
focused on the optimal solution, and there are few researches which are aimed to
seek the optimal set [7].
Thus, an improved CSA is put forward by adding antibody cleaning, the
objective function of the antibody set in the paper. The process of best individual
selection is cut out, and the quality of analysis is increased.

Traditional Clone Selection Algorithm
2.1
Analysis Process of Traditional CSA
The traditional CSA is the simulation of immune responses. The cells which could
detect more antigen would be cloned the greater the number, and they will produce
antibodies and memory cells through mutation operation. The objective function is
regarded as antigen, and the candidate solution is considered as antibody in the
analysis of practical engineering problems. The antibody population fosters com-
petition through the calculation of afﬁnity of antibody, and the cutthroat competi-
tion is avoided by clone and mutation. The algorithm convergence is ensured by the
process of antibody memory.
2.2
Problem Analysis of Traditional CSA
There are some inappropriate processes in the traditional CSA while calculating the
optimal set, because the initial goal of this algorithm is seeking optimal solution.
The major problems are included as follows:
(1) The existence of redundant steps. The competition systems of initial population
and muted antibody are a critical process of seeking optimal solution. The
systems will delete some local optimal solution when looking for the optimal
set, because its main aim is to seek antibody population with whole perfor-
mance. It will reduce the total antibody population’s quality.
(2) The potential repeatability of antibody. The antibody population may have
some repeatability, because the initial antibody population is generated ran-
domly and there is mutation. The potential repeatability will not affect the
process of seeking optimal solution, but will affect the optimal set’s seeking.
290
L. Pei et al.

(3) The lack of judgment standard. The afﬁnity of single antibody is the judgment
of optimal solution in the traditional CSA. Yet there are no criteria for the
seeking of optimal set.

Modeling of the Improved CSA
An improved CSA is put forward based on the shortcomings of traditional CSA.
First, antibody cleaning is added, and antibody selection is improved, which are to
eliminate duplicate individuals in the set. Then, the objective function of the
antibody set is made to judge set’s quality which is non-existing in the traditional
method. In addition, the process of best individual selection is cut out, and the
quality of analysis is increased.
(1) The initialization of antibody population. Deﬁne the number of iteration times
as 0, i.e., i ¼ 0. The number of antibody population (recording A) which is
produced randomly is N.

(3) Antibody cleaning and selection. This step is very important for the process of
set optimization, and antibody cleaning’s aim is to delete the similar antibody in
the j  1 local optimal antibodies. Antibody selection is to perform the local
search to clean antibody set Aj, and the process of total optimal solution
searching is deleted, as shown in Table 1.
(4) Calculating afﬁnity of antibody set and judging. Each time the local search is
completed, the afﬁnity of antibody set needs to be calculated, and the several
times iterative calculations need to be compared. The optimal set is the anti-
body set which corresponds to the largest value of function.

Experiment and Simulation
In order to test the effectiveness of the improved CSA, this article optimizes the rule
sets in the FCREAM by the simpliﬁed CSA (denoted Method 1), which is proposed
by Wang An-si, and the improved CSA (denoted Method 2), and the solutions are
compared and analyzed. FCREAM is an improved CREAM basic method which
belongs to the second-generation human reliability analysis method and could make
human cognitive reliability quantitative prediction through the method combining
quantitative and qualitative analysis.

In order to enhance the credibility of the comparison of results, do the following:
(1) The initial population used by Method 1 and Method 2 should be similar.
(2) The basic coefﬁcients setting: the number of initial population is 20,000,
denoted N ¼ 20;000; the time of iteration is 50, denoted as n ¼ 50.
b ¼ 10  N ¼ 200;000; The mutation rate is 0.5, denoted as pm ¼ 0:5.

Case Analysis
Optimize the rule sets in the FCREAM by Method 1 and Method 2 through
MATLAB algorithm. Set 4 conditions, which are analyzed by FCREAM, Method
1, Method 2, and their solutions are deﬁned as HEP0, HEP1, HEP2. HEP3 rep-
resents the solution which is obtained by CREAM basic method. The solutions are
shown in Table 2.
4.3
Effective Analysis of Methods
As shown in Table 2, the result obtained by FCREAN cannot correspond to the
result obtained by the basic method, and it is not effective because HEP is 0.265 in
the condition 4. When using Method 2, the higher the level of the condition, the
smaller the HEP2. Comparing HEP2 with HEP3, HEP2 is within limits of HEP3 no
matter what the condition is, which proves Method 2 is effective. Thus the
improved CSA is effective.
4.4
Analysis of Method’s Characteristic
As shown in Fig. 1, the continuity of the rule surf obtained by the improved CSA is
great, and it proves the method preserve set’s diversity. When observing the
changes of the optimal set’s afﬁnities, Method 2 can obtain the optimal result faster

than Method 1 if two methods use the same initial population, and they both have
good stability. But the afﬁnities obtained by Method 2 are more small in the
process. There is a difference of 1237 at last, and it proves the repeatability of
Method 1 has great effectiveness to result, and Method 2 avoids this problem well.

Kun Yu, Ying Zhang, Wanyuan Nie and Jun Zeng
Abstract The decision-making methods were widely used in complex system
involving human subjective factors. In this research, a group feedback mechanism
was constructed based on grey similarity degree, and the divergence degree indi-
cator was established based on grey similarity degree to determine divergence
degree between individual decision-making vectors and mean vector. In group
feedback mechanism, an improved scale model was constructed based on
Weber-Fechner law to increase closeness between scale model and subjective
judgments for analytic hierarchy process method. And the validation method for
scale model was proposed to verify the advantage of the scale model. The proposed
method can more truly reﬂect the decision makers’ decision-making intention and
improve the accuracy of decision-making results for complex system.

impact on the results for system decision-making. But researches showed that the
traditional decision-making methods with using AHP method cannot accurately
determine the ﬁnal decision-making results. The individual decision-making
opinions were used to construct the comparison judgment matrices, but the indi-
vidual

decision-making. The (1/9, 9) scale model was widely used to construct the com-
parison judgment matrices in AHP method [1]. Zhang [2] indicated that scale values
of (1/9, 9) scale model were different from cognitive value of subjective judgment
group. For this problem, (9/9–9/1) scale model and (9(0/9)–9(9/9)) scale model were
developed to solve the reasonable matching problem between physical stimuli
decision-making objects and psychological feelings of decision makers. The results
showed that the newly proposed scale models had been optimized to ensure the
thinking consistency of judgment. But the scale system uniformity and perceiv-
ability of scale models were signiﬁcantly lower than (1/9, 9) scale model.
In this research, an improved decision-making method based on group feedback
mechanism and scaling method were proposed, in order to ensure the accuracy of
ﬁnal judgment vector for decision-making.

The
decision-making method based on group feedback mechanism could improve the
diversity, extensiveness and representation of decision-making opinions by
increasing the number of independent samples. The method could effectively
coordinate the contradiction between the individuals’ subject opinions. The
advantage of this method was the feedback and correction for decision-making
opinions in group.

Improved Scale Model for Comparison Judgment
Matrix
The principle of Weber-Fechner law expounded the different threshold of human
perception with a change in the original stimulation, as DU=U ¼ X. In which, U
was original stimulate variable; DU was difference threshold; C was a constant, as
Weber ratio [3]. According to Weber-Fechner law, the human subjective judgment
variable could be determined through measuring the amount changing of external
stimulation intensity. The amount of external stimulation intensity usually increased
298
K. Yu et al.

geometrically, while the amount of human subjective feeling increased linearly. The
relationship between human psychological variable and external physical variable
strictly followed Weber-Fechner law as in (1).
S ¼ K log R
ð1Þ
In which, S was the variable of human subjective feeling; R was variable of
objective stimulation; K was a constant. Weber-Fechner law was the relationship
between psychological variable and physical variable [4]. The scale value of scale
model should have actual physical meaning to ensure that the difference between
scale values can reﬂect the quantitative concept of human subjective feeling. The
new scale model MðSÞ of paired comparison judgment was constructed based on
Weber-Fechner law, as in (2).
MðSÞ ¼ xS=K
ð2Þ
In which, S was the subjective scale levels of scale model; K was the smallest
discernible difference number, K ¼ 5 [5]; MðSÞ was the variables of objective
stimulation. The scale model MðSÞ for AHP method was shown in (3).

Through the quadratic interpolation ﬁtting calculation, when x ¼ 3:326, MðSÞ
and DðSÞ could get a excellent ﬁtting degree, and the ﬁtting function value was
0.6288. Therefore, x ¼ 3:3263 was used in MðSÞ model. Then, the meaning of
improved degree number and the detailed data for comparison judgment matrix for
AHP method based on MðSÞ was shown in Fig. 2.
The ranking preservation indicator, consistency indicator, uniformity indicator,
scale uniformity indicator [7], perceivability indicator could be used as the avail-
ability criteria to verify effectiveness of the MðSÞ scale model. The ranking
preservation indicator meant the performance of scale model to ensure the proper
ranking among different attributes in AHP method. The consistency indicator of the
random consistency rate was CR ¼ CI=RI. If CR\0:10, the judgment matrix
satisﬁed the consistency requirement. The scale uniformity indicator was the uni-
form degree of numerical changing of the adjacent scale values. The uniformity
indicator was used to describe the uniformity between vector elements of judgment
result [8]. These validation indicators were used to verify the advantages of MðSÞ
scale model in the typical 9 order uniform matrix. Establishing the typical 9 order
uniform matrix A. First, (1/9,9) scale model is used to construct the paired com-
parison judgment matrix; constructed the speciﬁc new MðSÞ scale model; lastly,

Conclusion
The decision-making method based on group feedback mechanism can improve the
diversity, extensiveness and representation of decision-making opinions by
increasing the number of independent samples. The method can effectively coor-
dinate the contradiction between the individuals’ subject opinions. The improved
scale model based on Weber-Fechner law can more truly map the relationship
between human psychological variable and external physical variable in subjective
decision-making. The improved scale model can ensure the accuracy of judgment
vectors for subjective decision-making. The improved method can be used in
subjective decision-making for complex system engineering. And more practical
applications will be carried out in further research.

Simulation and Evaluation Prototype
of Intelligent Lower Limb Prosthesis
Based on Function Requirements
of Human–Machine System
Wujing Cao, Hongliu Yu, Weiliang Zhao, Qiaoling Meng
and Xiaodong Wei
Abstract Robotic testing can facilitate the development of new concepts, designs
and control systems for prosthetic limbs. Human subject test clearances, safety and
the lack of repeatability associated with human trials can be reduced or eliminated
with automated testing, and test modalities are possible which are dangerous or
inconvenient to attempt with patients. In order to make evaluation of the function of
the intelligent lower limb prosthesis, according to the requirements of main function
of the human–machine system of prosthetic leg, the simulation and evaluation
system of above-knee prosthesis function was designed. The control system was
designed on the basis of overall design. A set of evaluation method was proposed,
and the gait symmetry was measured by the designed evaluation system. The
experimental results showed that the symmetry of the swing gait velocity was
96.5% and gait tracking effect was good. Therefore, the system had a good effect on
the function simulation and evaluation of the prosthesis.

Introduction
According to the data calculation of the second national handicapped person
sampling survey, the sum of disabled people in China was 82.96 million, 6.34% of
the total population, including 24.12 million physical disabilities and 2.26 million
amputees. The amputee number was far more than that in the last few years [1]. The
residual limb regeneration cannot be reached in the current medical treatment level.
The recovery of motor function of patients with amputation can only give priority to
install artiﬁcial limb. Lower limb prosthesis for amputees plays an important role to
restore self-care ability in a degree. In order to test the performance of the pros-
thesis, function simulation and evaluation system of the lower limb prosthesis is
particularly important [2].
At present, there is not a set of mature evaluation standard or system of the
performance evaluation of the lower limb prosthesis. International standard or
national standard only rules the structure strength and fatigue strength of the
prosthesis joint [3]. However, the main evaluation indexes stability, gait symmetry,
function compensation and energy consumption which inﬂuence the performance
of the lower limb prosthesis are not established [4–7]. This ﬁeld of research is
mainly to characterize the lower limb prosthesis; then, the prosthesis can be eval-
uated with the gait. For example, the Dingwell et al. [8] have set up a system for
real-time evaluation and providing gait symmetry information which can show
symmetry conditions in the process of walking of two feet; Richter et al. [9]
describe the development, modeling, parameter estimation and control of a robot
capable of reproducing two degree-of-freedom hip motion in the sagittal plane. Hip
vertical displacement and thigh angle motion proﬁles are applied to a transfemoral
prosthesis attached to the robot. A treadmill is used as walking surface. Aside from
tracking hip motion trajectories, the control system can be used to regulate the
contact force between the treadmill and the prosthesis. With the use of gait analysis
data of healthy people and patients, Wang and Zhang [10] calculated the phase
symmetry index, symmetry and asymmetry indicators based on Fitts law and
comparative analysis, ﬁnding that the score of different evaluation index was var-
ied; Pitkin [11] designed a cycloid to fake ankle joint institution, its purpose is to
provide a more natural damping torque of ankle with dorsiﬂexion movement.
For the function simulation and evaluation of the lower limb prosthesis,
according to the requirements of main function of the man-machine system of the
lower limb prosthesis, the designed system used synchronous belt to simulate level
walking of the prosthesis and lift air cylinder to simulate the human body’s gravity
shift. Intelligent lower limb prosthesis connected with the simulator by a special
joint and realized the function simulation. Applying microcomputer control struc-
ture to simulate the damper control of the lower limb prosthesis, gait symmetry
performance of the lower limb prosthesis was evaluated.

The Main Function Requirements
of the Man–Machine System
According to ergonomics and mechanism of leg prosthesis bionics design, the main
function requirements of the prosthetic leg include the comfort of swing phase, the
stability of supporting phase, the self-adaptability of working modes and the
verisimilitude of shape [12]. The core of these requirements constitutes the targets
of the availability of prosthetic leg product through different forms.
The comfort of swing phase is concerned with gait symmetry and rangeability of
the center of gravity. Gait symmetry of swing phase refers to two legs of the normal
body have the phase symmetry in a gait cycle. A large study showed that gait phase
symmetry is the core requirement of the prosthetic leg [13–15]. If the human body
is regarded as the multi-rigid-body system by muscle involvement and innervation,
adjusting their gait parameters to achieve the best condition in order to save energy
consumption [16]. The research results of Liu et al. [17] showed that each lower
limb can appear abnormal gait when different degree damage of movement sym-
metry happened in the process of walking, thus putting forward the concept
bilateral symmetry as an evaluation index of walking function to measure ampu-
tation patients after wearing leg prosthesis. Gait symmetry index can be calculated
by the following formula:
Sr ¼
Tz
T

0:5
 Zr 0:62 þ Mr 0:38
ð
Þ
Among them, Sr is the gait symmetry index, Tz is a normal gait cycle, T is the
gait cycle, Zr is the support phase ratio (small/large), Mr is the step phase ratio
(small/large).
In the process of walking forward of normal people, hip moves up and down
with rhythm, its trajectory is very smooth and has no sudden change in the
direction, its amplitude is about 6 cm. In order to make the prosthesis not touch the
ground in the middle of the swing phase, the center of gravity of leg prosthesis
wearer moves larger than normal people, the total displacement is nearly 8 cm
which increases energy consumption [18]. Therefore, knee prosthesis should be
designed to simulate the variable rotation instantaneous center of normal people,
reducing variations in the center of gravity of human walking [19].

Design of Function Simulation and Evaluation System
In order to simulate and evaluate the gait following performance of the micro-
computer controlled knee prosthesis, the design objective of the experimental
apparatus is for the realization of the three main functions: (1) simulation of
velocity changes of normal knee joint and the real-time detection of angular

velocity; (2) simulate the hip drive of the prosthetic leg and drive the prosthetic
knee joint to swing to evaluate the gait following performance and security; and
(3) control the damping of the prosthetic knee joint by program and assessment
tracking results of step speeds by changing the prosthetic foot or other
counterweight.
To achieve this target, the article designed the performance evaluation system.
The composition and working principle of the device is shown in Fig. 1. The whole
control circuit included four control modules:
1. Cylinder control module of the prosthetic leg height adjustment. Height
adjustment cylinder was controlled by a logic circuit board. Self-locking
cylinder which was controlled by integrated circuit 4013 CMOS was also used
to prevent the prosthetic leg to fall into the ground and improve the location
accuracy.
2. Control transformation module of manual automatic switch. Manual button
buffers the switch signal by a piece of integrated circuit ULN2803 and sent it to
the step motor driver.
3. Starting module of step motor driver and brushless electric machine driver. The
circuit board module adopted the AD654 integrated circuit to produce the drive
signal of step motor in the case of manual control.

signal detection and automatic control. Simulators communicated with desktop
computer, microcomputer control and detection were achieved directly.

Test Evaluation of Gait Symmetry of the Intelligent
Lower Limb Prosthesis
A set of function simulation and performance evaluation system of intelligent lower
limb prosthesis was made (see Fig. 2). In the simulation and measurement system,
testing data of the healthy leg and values of the needle valve opening obtained
through computer simulation to conduct swing speed test of the intelligent lower
limb prosthesis. Experimental procedures were as follows:
1. The intelligent lower limb prosthesis was installed on the simulation hip joint.
2. Angle sensors of the healthy leg and false leg were connected with computer
through data collector.
3. Manual mode drives the motors of the hip joints swing. The largest drive pulse
frequency was 500 Hz, the step angle was 1.8°, so the drive speed of the hip
joint was 225°/s.

4. The knee joint completed one swing cycle was about 12 sampling interval, so
the oscillation cycle was: Th = 12.0  50 = 600 (ms) = 0.6 (s). The peak of
swing angle was about 1.50 v. As the range of the precision potentiometer was

intelligent lower limb prosthesis was also approximately 12 sampling interval.
The oscillation cycle was: Tp = 12.0  50 = 600 (ms) = 0.6 (s). Swing angle

Conclusion
The designed function simulation and evaluation system could not only simulate the
microcomputer control of the damper, but also realize the measurement and eval-
uation of gait following symmetry. Test results showed that the needle valve opening
was set according to the theoretical analysis value; the intelligent lower limb pros-
thesis tracked the swing speed of healthy leg commendably. The experimental
results were well consistent with theoretical analysis results. The symmetry of swing
speed was as high as 96.5%. Gait tracking effect was good. This measurement
system can also make test and evaluation of real-time gait tracking control, automatic
safety lock in support phase after further improving the software system.

Introduction
Physiological signals in the body contain a wealth of human health information,
such as ECG, respiration and body movements [1]. Continuous monitoring of
physiological parameters provides the information of the human physiology and
pathological conditions, and the collaborative monitoring of multiple physiological
parameters will provide a richer data [2–4]. It is necessary to study these physio-
logical signals whether it is a single-phenomenon study or a comprehensive human
body system. However, the traditional equipment is difﬁcult to achieve a long-term
work and continuous monitoring of multiple parameters in the condition of daily
life [5, 6]. In this study, multiple physiological parameters acquisition technology
and daily clothing are combined, which can detect the body’s ECG, respiration,
body movements and other parameters in the form of clothes and chest belt. The
system meets the needs of different test conditions and provides a technical platform
for dangerous environment operations, sports training, medical rehabilitation and
other related personnel [7].

Technical Methods
ECG measurement: ECG is measured by using the potential measurement on the
body surface skin. The method uses fabric electrode sensing measurement unit, by
measuring the surface potential, to achieve ECG signal detection. According to the
RR interval within the time of ECG signal, the heart rate test is completed.
Respiratory rate measurement: Select an appropriate position of the chest and
then
measure
the
physical
changes
in
the
chest
respiration
through the
fabric-respiration sensor. So the respiratory signal detection and respiratory rate
measurement are ﬁnished.
Position measurement: Detect position changes by the three-axis acceleration
sensor, and the three-axis acceleration of human movement is calculated through
the measurement compensation algorithm.
Communication method: Bluetooth communication protocol and hardware
interface are used in communication. The terminal will upload the detected phys-
iological data and measured environmental perception parameters to the host
computer. After that, the abnormalities of subject’s physical and psychological
stress and the abnormal warning and prejudgment of environmental parameters will
be obtained through the algorithm analysis.

System Design
3.1
ECG
The measurement of ECG signal uses fabric electrode sensor. The fabric electrode
belongs to the dry electrode, and it is in direct contact with the body surface.
Compared with the medical AgCl viscous electrode, the measurement signal has
nothing to do with other conductive media, and it does not change with the change
in detection time. As a result, it is suitable for dynamic and long-term ECG signal
detection. In addition, the fabric electrode is comfortable and reusable, and it can be
washed several times. Conductive textile fabric is the basic material of the fabric
ECG sensor, which is the fore end of the ECG measurement. The conductive textile
fabric is based on the ﬁbre cloth, which is covered by electroplated metal coating
after the pre-treatment to have a metal characteristic. Taking the comfort and cost of
the measurement into account, silver-plated conductive textile fabric is chosen to be
ECG sensor material. And the ECG test signal is shown in Fig. 1.
The heart rate is calculated based on the number of R waves in a cycle time
(1 min) of the ECG signal. The differential threshold method is used to achieve
heart rate detection and calculation for technical system.

3.2
Respiration
According to the Cole–Cole theory of biological tissue impedance, the impedance
characteristics of human is determined by the resistance and capacitance, and the
impedance will show different characteristics with the changes in the frequency of
the loaded electrical signal. Based on the regularity of the modulus value of the
human impedance and the phase changes with the frequency, the 100 kHz
high-frequency signal is selected to measure the impedance changes in the chest,
which can achieve the measurement of the human respiratory movement and the
respiratory signal. Fabric electrode is selected to be the measuring sensor in the
chest resistance measurement, and it is a conductive fabric-ﬁlled sponge ﬂexible.
The fabric electrode is ﬁxed on the elastic fabric belt to form the respiratory signal
measuring and sensing device. The position where the elastic fabric placed in the
human chest is shown in Fig. 2.
100 kHz signal, which is generated from the high-frequency signal source, is
loaded into the human body through the fabric electrode, and the chest impedance
will produce modulation of this high-frequency signal when the body breathes.
Then the fabric electrodes collect the modulated signal, and the original signal turns
to an analogy signal with high SNR through the follow-up circuit ampliﬁcation,
ﬁltering and other processing, which will be sent to the ADC sampling. The DFT
algorithm is used to return the real and imaginary data of the measured frequency
point, and the measured impedance value is obtained by mathematical calculation.
The ﬂow of the algorithm is shown in Fig. 3, and the test curve is shown in Fig. 4.
In calculation process of the respiratory rate, due to external disturbances and
other factors, the noise jamming signals often appear in the respiratory signal,
affecting the accuracy of the calculation. The respiratory rate is calculated by the
peak threshold method. After the respiratory signal is ampliﬁed, shaped and digi-
tized, the microcomputer calculates the peak values of the respiratory signal in the
ﬁrst eight cycles and takes the average of the peak values as the comparison
threshold. Then calculate the difference between the peak values and threshold. If
the difference is greater than 1/2 of the peak value, the point is called the deliberate

interference point. As shown in Fig. 5, A point is the suspicious interference point.
Then calculate the sum of the second and third peak points on both sides of A, take
the average and compare the average with the peak value of A point. If the peak of
A point is greater than 1/2 of the average, the point A is an interference point.
Remove the A point when calculate the respiratory rate in unit time.

Body Movement
The MPU6050 (six-axis motion detection integrated chip) is used in the signal
acquisition and processing circuit. The MPU6050 can measure the three-axis
acceleration and three-axis angular velocity signals in real time and can output the
fusion calculus data with the format of six-axis or nine-axis rotation matrix, the
quaternion, Euler angle in digital form. The circuit of signal acquisition in body
movement is shown in Fig. 6.

Introduction
Flexibility plays a very important role in the process of movement. Flexibility refers
to the ability to quickly change the position and transform the action and the
contingency during the movement [1, 2]. It is a physical quality of the compre-
hensive manifestation of the movement and a quality that cannot be covered by
other special qualities. It relates to the spatial positioning and the ability to predict
and react to the feeling of time. For athletes, in the fast-changing and complex
game, if they want to determine the ﬁeld changes accurately and use the technology

ﬂexibly according to the situation on the ﬁeld, they need to have a high degree of
ﬂexibility [3–5]. For the soldiers, with greater ﬂexibility, in the ever-changing
battleﬁeld, they can effectively protect themselves against the enemy. Therefore, the
ﬂexibility of the test and training in the process of low-load movement has a very
important signiﬁcance. At present, the training methods for ﬂexibility are mainly
qualitative acceleration, deceleration and change training, and it cannot quantify the
ﬂexibility [6–8]. This system measures the reaction time by using an infrared
sensor, which can reﬂect the ﬂexibility of a person during the movement. The
record of the reaction time, and the movement frequency and movement trajectory
will be returned to the tablet computer. The system is ﬂexible, convenient and
accurate measurement of the ﬂexibility of different sports state, and it has a broad
application prospect in the movement to change agility training and rehabilitation
training for athletes or soldiers.

Design of Hardware
There are 16 light nodes in the hardware part of this system. Each node contains a
NodeMCU, two infrared sensors, a lithium battery and LED dot matrix, which is
shown in Fig. 1.
NodeMCU is an open-source hardware prototype platform with ﬁrmware and
development board, which is interactive, programmable, low cost, simple, and so
on. NodeMCU provides a high-level hardware interface to avoid complex hardware
conﬁguration and register operations. And interactive Lua script is used, which
makes the preparation of hardware code simple. At the same time, NodeMCU has
ultra-low-cost WIFI module and occupies a huge advantage in cost. In this system,
NodeMCU is used as the main controller, including WIFI, ADC, UART, I2C and
many GPIOs.
There are two different infrared sensors in the system: sharp 2–15 cm infrared
sensor module and 10–80 cm infrared sensor module. Taking into account the
thickness of the light node, the test distance will be 0–80 cm. The accuracy of the
infrared sensor is 0.001 s. When working, the two modules are connected to the
same ADC pin, and when the data of one module are speciﬁed by the server task
mode, the other module is disconnected.
Fig. 1 Composition of the node

7  7 LED dot matrix is used to display the letter number, which is speciﬁed by
the server. When the cluster mode is used, the nodes are assigned to the corre-
sponding cluster at the server, such as A, B and C. If the nodes belong to the A
cluster, they all display “A.” When the node is blocked, it will send back the signal
with the light off. The display of LED dot matrix is shown in Fig. 2.
Lithium battery with 1000 mAh capacity can be repeated charge and discharge,
and its output is 5 V.

Design of Software
The software part is mainly designing an App in the smart phone or Tablet PC,
which can achieve the setting and control of the light nodes, and store the data from
the sensor. Huawei M3 is selected for its Android system as the mobile terminal,
and the App is designed by Eclipse.
The communication between App and the light nodes is TCP protocol for data
transmission, while the use of high-power routers is used to ensure the signal
coverage of 50 m. The communication process between App and the light nodes is
shown in Fig. 3.
The initialization process includes the following two aspects:
(1) Open the router, App, server and nodes.
(2) The nodes connect to the server, and the server shows the nodes connection
(Fig. 4).

There are two modes of this system: random mode and custom mode. For
random mode, the random sequence is generated by the system automatically,
which determines the order of the lights. For the custom mode, the order of the
lights is controlled by users based on the test results. After the mode selection, the
parameters of the nodes need to be set, including the sensing distance (the maxi-
mum distance at which the light node senses to block and extinguishes), the timeout
time (if the time sensor does not sense the occlusion, it is time-out and recorded),
sound (buzz) reminder and interval time (the interval between two lights). When the
App receives the data from the nodes, save it and generate the corresponding curve.
The processes of two modes are as follows:
For random mode,
(1) Set the generation range of the random number, and the time interval between
two random numbers.
(2) Send the mode code and the relevant setting information and wait for the nodes
to respond.
(3) The nodes send a response data frame, indicating that the setting is completed.
(4) App generates a random number, lights the corresponding node, and waits for
the nodes to return time information. If the timeout occurs, record the infor-
mation and proceed to the next step.
(5) Repeat (4) until the end.
For custom mode,
(1) Set the node sequence, and the time interval between two consecutive nodes.
(2) Send the mode code and the relevant setting information, and wait for the nodes
to respond.
(3) The nodes send a response data frame, indicating that the setting is completed.
(4) Light the corresponding node as the node sequence, and wait for the nodes to
return time information. If the timeout occurs, record the information and
proceed to the next step.

Conclusions
An App is designed by Eclipse in Huawei M3 in the system, and the App sets the
parameters to control the order of the light nodes. The time from lighting to
lighting-off measured by infrared sensors can assess the ﬂexibility of people in the
process of movement. Through the comparative experiment, low-load human
ﬂexibility test system is a ﬂexible and stable method to simulate different types
of training and analysis, and it has a broad prospect in the agile training and
rehabilitation training for athletes and soldiers.

Study on the Design of Healthy Learning
Chair Based on the Physiological
Characteristics of Teenagers
Ping Zhang, Sanren Jin, Fengyi Liu, Ya Wen and Quan Yuan
Abstract The spine bending deformation is a serious problem for teenagers
because of working longtime behind desk, which even affects their growth
healthfully. So it is important to design a scientiﬁc, healthy, comfortable learning
chair for the teenagers. Through analyzing and synthesizing students’ learning
posture, physiological characteristics and psychological characteristics, this project
obtains abundant data and creates a new-style chair by combining the theory of
ergonomics to the chair that can adjust the position and shape of cushion and
backrest to ﬁt the posture of the user. By adjusting dynamically the physiological
features of teenagers, it can help teenagers develop good learning habits and
improve learning efﬁciency.

Introduction
Most of the teenagers in China study for more than 12 h behind the desk every day.
From primary school to high school, parents try to choose suitable learning chair for
their children constantly, but there is often no better choice. 12–18 years old is an
important growth period for teenagers, and it is also an important period of spine
growth, but also a crucial stage of learning. After investigation, we found that many
students bore the spine bending deformation because of learning longtime and
uncomfortable sitting posture. At present, some domestic study institutes and chair
production plants were in a low level in researching and developing teenagers’
chair. Some imitated foreign chairs, and some modiﬁed simply from adult chairs.

Not only the chair size cannot meet the requirements of Chinese teenagers, but also
the chair cannot meet other needs, such as physiological characteristics, etc.
At present, the study of teenagers’ healthy chairs mainly focuses on ergonomics
study of static chairs and sitting posture correction of teenagers, and there is no
research on intelligent or dynamic function to make teenagers more comfortably
when they keep sitting for a longtime. The paper named “The inﬂuence of chair
design on teenagers scoliosis” (Wang Fen, Feng Xi) according to the difference
body size between teenagers and adults, as well as the inﬂuence of action ﬁelds on
daily behavior and daily sitting posture, got the design of the chair suitable for
teenagers in this age. And then, by virtual simulation technology, to determine
whether the shape of seat is ﬁtting the human sitting posture or not, we ﬁnally
obtained the most effective data about the sitting posture. The study named “Design
study and practice of primary and secondary school desks and chairs” (Xu Danni)
discussed on the shortcomings of the use of desks and chairs in primary and middle
school students, summarized the design key points of desks and chairs for primary
and middle school students according to the functional needs of theirs, and pro-
posed the solutions to meet the physiological and psychological needs. The paper
named “Seat comfort study with the consideration of body pressure distribution of
boundary manikins” (Zhang Xiaoyi) discussed the goal of improving the static chair
comfort and the means of pressure distribution, and focused on the inﬂuence factors
of different ﬁgure drivers and lumbar support by combining the study of subjective
evaluation test and simulation test.
Through analyzing and synthesizing learning posture, physiological character-
istics and psychological characteristics of students, this project obtained rich data
and then combined the theory of ergonomics to create a kind of chair which can
adjust automatically to adjust the posture of the user. By adjusting dynamically the
physiological features of teenagers, it can help teenagers develop good learning
habits and improve learning efﬁciency.

Physiological Characteristics Analysis
of Teenagers Sitting Posture
2.1
Structure of Spine
When sitting, the main structures that support the human body are spine, pelvis,
legs and feet. The spine is an important physiological structure of the human body,
located in the midline of the back, consisting of 33 pieces of short cylindrical
vertebrae, 7 pieces of cervical vertebrae, 12 pieces of thoracic vertebrae, 5 pieces of
lumbar vertebrae, 5 pieces of sacrum vertebrae and 4 pieces of tail bones. They are
connected with each other with the tendon and cartilage (Fig. 1). In normal posture,
the lumbar part of the spine is convex forward, while the sacral spine is concave
backward. Sitting a well posture, the pressure distributed properly on each
332
P. Zhang et al.

intervertebral disk and the muscle tissues stand even static load. When keeping
off-normal position, pressure distribution is not normal within the intervertebral
disks, leading to lumbar pain, fatigue and discomfort [1].
2.2
Analysis of Correct Sitting Posture
In resent research, there are more than 100 kinds of diseases related to the spine and
spinal disease shows the tendency of the young. Because students need to do
homework for a longtime daily, all sorts of bad posture are easy to keep the spine in
the ﬂexion position or in some speciﬁc positions for a longtime, which not only
Fig. 1 Shape of the human
spine
Study on the Design of Healthy …
333

makes the spinal intervertebral pressure increase, but also make the spinal muscle
ligament in non-coordinated stress state, and ﬁnally leads to lateral bending. The
physiological study of sitting posture shows that the normal shape of the lumber
curve is the point to get comfortable sitting position. Because the normal lumber
curve has a slight protrusion, in order to keep a minimum deformation, the chair
should provide two supports behind the part of lumbar spine.
When teenagers learning, the correct sitting posture should be: keeping head,
neck and trunk straightly, holding two shoulders evenly and the keeping head
forward slightly; keeping back straightly, lifting breast and keeping breast away
from the edge of table for a distance of a ﬁst, putting two feet on the ﬂoor with the
width of shoulders; holding arms on the table, and keeping one foot distance from
the eyes to desk. The dotted line shows the correct writing posture, and the solid
line shows the reading or resting posture. At this time, the chair can provide support
on the lumbar (Fig. 2).
2.3
Biomechanical Analysis of Sitting Posture
The vertebrae are connected by nearby muscles and tendons. Vertebrae ﬁx position
by the force of muscle tendon. Once the spine deviates from its natural state, the
muscle tendon will be subjected to mutual pressure (tension or compression), which
will increase the muscle activity, resulting in fatigue. When tendon tissues are
stressed, tan active potential will be produced. According to the results of EMG
recording, we can see that the muscle activity of the lumbar spine is high when
sitting upright, because of the muscle tension pulling forward. But the activity of
the lumbar spine reduces signiﬁcantly after the lumbar spine being supported by the
backrest. When the trunk leans forward, the activity of muscles of upper back and
shoulders is high and it cannot be reduced by supporting on the desktop by arms.
Meanwhile, the uneven distribution pressures of the chair cushion tell us that the
cushion pressures should be designed in accordance with the principle that the
different parts of buttocks stand different pressures. That is, the pressure value is
maximum at the ﬁeld of ischium and reduces gradually to the periphery areas, until
to a minimum value at the thigh position. Figure 3 (left) shows the pressure dis-
tribution curve of the chair back and the conception design of the back shape
according to the curve. Figure 3 (right) is the pressure distribution curve of hip and
the conception design of the chair’s cushion shape according to the curve.
Through the study of the relationship between human and the chair, we can ﬁnd
that the most comfortable way is to sit down and get up slowly instead of a state of
stress while the chair dumps and bounces up suddenly when sitting down and
getting up (Fig. 4), so it requires that chair cushion and chair back keep movement
in nonlinear way [2].

Dynamically
After investigating and analyzing, the design target mainly focuses on domestic
teenagers. By the theory of ergonomics, the healthy learning chair, which embodies
physical characteristics and psychological characteristics of teenagers, is suitable
for teenagers to keep learning posture well. This chair is intelligent, in some degree,
to achieve automatic adjustment to match the posture of the user, and to help

parents give the healthy guidance to teenagers, and to help them improve learning
efﬁciency [3].
3.1
Adjustment Design of Chair
As we know, students’ body sizes and learning postures are different from different
ages, so according to the physiological characteristics of them, we plan to choose
adjustable dimensions for the chair, such as the height, the depth and the backrest
(Fig. 5).

At the same time, the height data of 12–18-year-old teenagers can be obtained
from relevant data (Table 1).
The range of female’s height can be included in the data of male, and the data
changes from 1.381 to 1.839 m. According to the ergonomics standard, chair height
should be between 300 and 480 mm; adjustment range is 180 mm [4].
At the same time, as the height increases, the chair depth should be increased
accordingly; similarly, the chair depth can be adjusted in 150 mm. The height of the
lumbar pad affects the comfort of the user directly; depending on the deferent
heights, the lumbar pad height adjustment range is 80 mm [5].

Back Design of Chair
By the structure of human spine, spine bending range is limited greatly. In fact, the
adjacent two pieces of vertebrae can only change a small angle and must change
smoothly. They can be approximated as discrete points of a continuous function.
However, there is not a public “spine curve” which is suitable to all, because the
curve of the spine is different from the posture changing of the people, while the
dimensions are not the same by people. Through researching a large number of
documents, ﬁnally the Bezier curve is selected to match the design requirements
(Fig. 6).
Figure 7 shows the chair back which simulates the human body curve by using
the Bezier curve to ﬁt and transit smoothly. The back of chair ﬁts body structure of
oriental teenagers, it can provide convenient lumbar support, make the spine to
maintain coordination, avoid back pain, and reduce fatigue when students are
working, reading, writing or resting.

Chair Design of Multi-module Cushion and Backrest
This chair cushion can provide multi-point movable supporting. The main parts of
chair cushion and backrest are made of modular structure. The cushion is divided
into 6 modules and 3 modules in the lumbar pad. The connection between the
modules is ﬁlled with springs and some materials which neither too hard, nor too
soft. Each module is equipped with automatic driving device that can adjust the
angle and position of the module at any time to realize the transformation of
different forms of cushion, in order to ﬁt the users’ back and buttocks perfectly. By
the control system, the position and the shape of the cushions are automatically
adjusted, similarly to the lumbar pads. So as to realize the function that the chair can
adjust the posture of the user actively, see Figs. 8, 9 and 10.

In the process of application, the chair cushions and the lumbar pads are set in
two modes:
1. Manual mode
After selecting this mode, the user can adjust the height and position of each
module through the control buttons, until making themselves comfortable.
2. Auto-cycle mode
The system presets three forms of chair cushion. After selecting this mode, the
control system will adjust cushion shape to the next state automatically every
certain period of time, to make people change a posture unconsciously. By
changing the center of gravity of the human body, it can reduce fatigue when
teenagers are working for a longtime [6].

Conclusion
Through the research on the students’ working posture, physical characteristics,
psychological characteristics and comprehensive analysis, we create a healthy
learning chair which can adjust the physiological characteristics of teenagers
dynamically based on ergonomics. The chair has the characteristics of intelligence,
and the control system can adjust the position and shape of the cushion and the
backrest automatically to realize the function of adjusting the chair position. Health
and growth is an eternal topic accompanied with teenagers, so it is important to
provide teenagers with a healthy and comfortable working environment for them
growing healthily [7].

Haoting Liu, Beibei Yan, Ming Lv, Junlong Wang, Xuefeng Wang
and Wei Wang
Abstract A novel Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE)
image enhancement method which uses the environment self-perception mecha-
nism is proposed. First, the typical degraded image datasets are collected. Second,
several Image Quality (IQ) evaluation metrics are used to assess the imaging effect
of these datasets above. Third, a BP network is employed to build the connection
between the IQ evaluation results above and the optimal control parameters tuning
results of the classic CLAHE. The optimal control parameters tuning results are
gotten by the subjective evaluation and the setting of the control parameters of the
classic CLAHE. The expert experiences of the optimal enhancement are used as the
evaluation benchmark. Finally, when a new degraded image is captured, its IQ
evaluation metrics will be computed and its optimal control parameters will be
forecasted by the BP network and the computed IQ evaluation metrics. Many
experiment results have shown the effectiveness of proposed method.

Introduction
The image enhancement technique [1] can be utilized to improve the output quality
of the degraded images. The image degraded reasons derive from many factors,
such as the atmosphere, the optic system or the electronic system of camera, or the
improper strong light source, etc. In general, a good output effect means the
abundant image detail, the correct image color, and no geometric distortion. In this

paper, the image enhancement for the atmosphere-caused image degeneration is
discussed. That means it is supposed the working state and the ﬁxation position of
camera are proper; no strong light source exists and the optic or the electronic
system will not inﬂuence the imaging quality of camera seriously.
Many research works have been done to improve the imaging effect. In [2], the
related enhancement techniques of fog removal were reviewed. The state-of-the-art
techniques were analyzed and the development trend was provided. In [3], a kind of
single image dehazing method was proposed. The optimal transmission map with
scene priors was considered in that model. After an extensive research of the image
enhancement methods, it can be found that the current methods still have short-
coming: the adaptive processing abilities of these methods are limited; once the
imaging environment changes, the related algorithm may become invalided.
A new Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) method [4]
is proposed. First, the typical degraded image datasets are collected. Second, some
Image Quality (IQ) evaluation metrics [5, 6] are computed. The metrics include: the
image brightness, the image region contrast, the image edge blur, the image color
quality, and the image noise. Third, a BP network [7] is used to build the con-
nection between the IQ evaluation metrics above and the CLAHE optimal control
parameters. The CLAHE optimal control parameters are tuned by the subjective
experiences of experts. Finally, once a new image is captured, its IQ evaluation
metrics will be computed and its optimal control parameters will be forecasted by
the BP network. Then a kind of optimal enhancement can be realized.

Proposed Computational Framework
The proposed computational framework is shown in Fig. 1. The corresponding
processing steps have been addressed in Sect. 1. Regarding Fig. 1, in contrast to the
traditional method, this method has two characters. The ﬁrst one is it uses the blind
IQ evaluation metrics to percept the imaging environment. Because the blind IQ
evaluation metrics are independent to the image content, the processing effect of
them will be acceptable. The second one is this method uses the BP network to
forecast the proper optimal control parameters of CLAHE. The training of BP

network can be carried out before the application of the image enhancement system.
Obviously, the BP network can encapsulate the visual experiences of human.

Adaptive CLAHE Image Enhancement Method
3.1
Environment Self-perception Method
The blind IQ evaluation metrics are utilized to percept the imaging environment.
Table 1 shows the computation methods of these metrics. From Table 1 it can be
seen that the IQ evaluation can represent the image environment in the full scale;
the image luminance, the image details, the image saliency, and the image color can
all be described quantitatively. The computations of the corresponding IQ evalu-
ation metrics do not have any optimization processing which guarantees its
real-time application character for the outdoor enhancement in future. Here the
outdoor enhancement indicates the inﬂuence of complex atmosphere.

The Classic CLAHE Enhancement Method
The classic CLAHE limits the enhancement intensity of local histogram by the
control of local histogram height; then, the over enhancement of local contrast can
be avoided. Its computation steps include: ﬁrst, the original image will be separated
into several tiles. The tiles will not overlap to each other. Second, the local his-
togram of each tile will be computed and a clip limit will be estimated. The clip
limit will restrict the local histogram in the way that the height of local histogram
will not beyond the clip limit. One of the computation methods of the clip limit b is
shown in (1). Then a new local histogram will be calculated. Third, the histogram
equalization will be applied to the new local histogram. Finally, a linear interpo-
lation will be implemented to update the intensity value of each pixel.

The Improved CLAHE Method Using Environment
Perception
When carrying out the improved CLAHE, ﬁrst the image data will be transformed
from the RGB color space into the HSV color space. The HSV color space is used
here comes from the fact that it accords with the human ocular characters. The
improved CLAHE will be carried out only in the V component of HSV space. The
computation ﬂow chart of improved CLAHE is shown in Fig. 1. The control
parameters of improved CLAHE include the tile size parameters (height and width),
the clip limit, or the distribution parameters, etc. For the sake of simpleness, only
the clip limit is regarded as the main control parameter of the improved CLAHE,
i.e., the parameters a and smax are tuned when implementing the enhancement
computation. Thus, regarding the BP network, its input training data is [MIBD
MIRCD MIEBD MICQD MIND] and its supervising data is [a smax].

Experiments and Discussions
4.1
Experiment Data
The long-range outdoor surveillance data of the visible light CCD camera are used
to test the validity of proposed method. Obviously, the long-range surveillance data
suffer from the degraded inﬂuence of the atmosphere easily. Figure 2 shows the
346
H. Liu et al.

image samples captured between 7:20 and 12:20 of a winter day in north China.
The surveillance distance is about 2000 m. The sample frequency of this dataset is
one image per minute.
4.2
Subjective Evaluation Experiment
The subjective evaluation of IQ and the hand-tuning of CLAHE optimal control
parameters play the important roles when implementing the improved computation
of CLAHE in this paper. Figure 3 shows the hand-tuning results of Fig. 2.
Obviously, to get these results the subjective evaluation of IQ and the hand-tuning
of optimal control parameters should be carried out in parallel. Table 2 gives out its
corresponding tuning results of the optimal control parameters. From Fig. 3, it can
be seen the subjective tuning of CLAHE algorithm can get a comparable good
processing effect. The subjective evaluation and tuning are the time-consuming
tasks. After some experiment investigations, the ergonomics experiment method
can be used to get these optimal enhancement results.
When implementing the optimal evaluation and tuning of image enhancement
effect, three subjects and an experiment designer will participate in this experiment.
First, the experiment designer will tune the control parameters of the proposed
algorithm to generate the enhanced images. For each degraded image, the designer
will try his best to create at least 3 enhanced image candidates. The enhanced image
candidates should have a good imaging effect. Second, the subjects will perform a

subjective image quality evaluation experiment to select only one image as the ﬁnal
data from the candidates above. A subjective image quality evaluation software in
Fig. 4 is utilized to guide the evaluation and selection of image data. Finally, by
traversing all these degraded images, the optimal evaluation and tuning of image
results can be gotten.

(g) and (h) are the results of proposed method. From Fig. 5, it can be seen that the
proposed method can get a similar processing effect like the hand-tuning-based
method and it can improve the image detail, image luminance, and the image color;
while the classic CLAHE cannot get that calculation effect. Table 3 shows the
comparison between the hand-tuning optimal control parameters and the BP net-
work forecast control parameters. From Table 3, it can be seen that the proposed
method can get the similar processing result of CLAHE optimal control parameters
like the hand-tuning results.
The proposed method is also effective to the images captured by a dynamic
camera. Figure 6 shows the corresponding processing results. In Fig. 6, the images
(a)-1 to (a)-6 are the original degraded images. They are suffered by the environ-
ment light, the fog, or the mist. The images (b)-1 to (b)-6 are the results which are
processed by the classic CLAHE method. The images (c)-1 to (c)-6 are the results
which are computed by the improved CLAHE. From Fig. 6, it can be seen the
proposed method can get a better processing effect because the over enhancement
problem can be avoided while the image details still can be kept. The reasons the

proposed algorithm has a better processing effect come from two facts: the ﬁrst one
is the IQ evaluation metrics are used to represent the imaging effect under complex
atmosphere quantitatively; the second reason is the BP network encapsulates the
visual experience of human eyes. The proposed method also has some shortcom-
ings; for example, it depends on the hand-tuning degraded dataset. With the
accumulation of dataset, its processing effect will be improved deﬁnitely.

Conclusion
A new CLAHE enhancement algorithm which uses the blind IQ evaluation metrics
as the environment perception feedback is proposed. Five blind IQ evaluation
metrics are computed to describe the imaging environment. The BP network is used
to build the connection between the blind IQ evaluation metrics and the optimal
control parameters of CLAHE. The expert experiences of the optimal image
enhancement are encapsulated in this algorithm. In future, other blind IQ evaluation
metrics and the machine learning technique can be used to improve the computa-
tional effect of proposed method.

Risk Analysis of Subway Stampede
on Grey Clustering Method
Qiquan Wang, Songli Yang and Jiaxin Wu
Abstract To analyse the risk of subway stampede and determine the main factors
that induced the stampede accident, a grey clustering method was used to establish
an evaluation model by combining the whitening weight function obtained from
dangerous states. After collecting the information of a Beijing subway, the data
were applied to access. The result showed that grey clustering method was a
process that could not only analyse the intrinsic relations among the inﬂuencing
indexes, but also provide a directive function on how to reduce the risk of subway
stampede events.

Introduction
With the increasing population of China’s cities, the growing contradiction between
the increasing trafﬁc volume and the limited public transport space is becoming
more and more prominent. In subway, because of its underground closed envi-
ronment, the crowd’s evacuation is limited, crowded stampede events are particu-
larly serious [1].
In the research of subway crowd and stampede, D. Helbing and other researchers
focused on the panic-stricken people who have caused stampede and put forward a
mode named “social force” in Germany; Canadian scholars C.M. Henein and T.
White improved Kirchner cells automata model to analyse the behaviour of people
in the evacuation process using the computer model based on multi-agent tech-
nology in their study [2]. On the domestic, Kou Liping of the People’s Public
Security University of China has analysed the causes of the group stampede in
detail and raised the corresponding measures to avoid the occurrence of similar
events [3]. Hu Zhiying, in Tongji University, concluded that the main cause of

crowded accidents is large-scale social activities and proposed a large-scale activ-
ities crowded accident prevention system based on the whole process of centralized
management [4].
As for the assessment of subway congestion and stampede, HuoYumang, Song
Shouxin and so on, using analytic hierarchy process and entropy method to
determine the weight to get conclusion that the density of crowd and the ratio of the
number of people who walks on opponent way are the two most important factors
of subway congestion and stampede [5]. After the statistical analysis of the
domestic typical subway crowded stampede accident, QiuZhida, Song Rui, etc.,
established index system by using accident tree. What’s more, they also came up
with a subway congestion stampede evaluation method under the combination of
data envelopment analysis method [6]. Wang Yan found out the character of the
ﬂow in the subway in different times and its factors of inﬂuence. On this basis, she
analysed the evolution mechanism of the stampede [7]. In general, most of the
domestic and foreign research focuses on crowded stampede accidents of large
public places, and these places have the highly crowded characteristic. Foreign
research more focuses on crowd dynamics and the domestic research of subway
crowded stampede is in the development stage.
In order to analyse the risk of overcrowding accident in the subway accurately,
based on the grey weight whitening right function, this paper establishes the grey
clustering evaluation model of the congestion risk of the subway station. Select
some Beijing subway as sample stations, deeply analyze the impact of various
factors on the sample station crowded stampede the risk, in order to further reduce
the risk of crowded stampede and provide guidance information.

Construction of Grey Clustering Model for Risk
Assessment of Subway Stampede Event
Grey clustering is one of the contents of grey system theory, and it is a method
based on the production of grey whitening function [8]. Grey clustering analysis is a
systematic analysis method of clustering objects to summarize the whitening values
owned by different clustering indexes and according to K grey categories, so as to
judge the categories of clustering objects. The grey clustering method is particularly
suitable for complex environments with multiple input and multiple outputs. In the
application of the risk assessment of the crowded trampling accident in the subway
station, the risk factors of the crowded stampede events can be considered as the
input vector, the risk of the crowded stampede event can be treated as the output
vector. And then establish a planning model to achieve the purpose of evaluation
for the decision-making unit..

2.1
Establishment of Evaluation Index System
Referring to the article Research on Crowded Stampede Accident Risk at Subway
Based on Empowering Related Degree Method [9] written by Wang Qiquan, and
with the idea of system safety engineering, delimiting the main induce factors to the
subway crowded stampede of four aspects, which are identiﬁed as human, equip-
ment, environment and management, known as the primary indicators. The four
ﬁrst-level indicators are subdivided into 13 secondary indicators as crowd crowded,
alarmed, retrograde, falls and collisions, quarreling; elevator malfunction, road
slippery, power off; lighting defects, bad weather; emergency management defects,
error information and carry place excessive items, respectively. Speciﬁc evaluation
index system is shown in Table 1.
2.2
Determine Grey Class and Whitening Function
of Indicators
According to people’s acceptance of risk, we divided the risk state into four states—
the higher the risk the higher the level. There are four classes of grey, namely
k(k = 1, 2, 3, 4), and the value 0–10 indicating the score of each index. Considering
security is a relative state, in other words, there is no absolute safety in the world.
Combined with the requirements of the speciﬁc classiﬁcation of grey, point the
degree of =0, =3, =6, =9 to value the whitening weight function in its value area

Determine the Weight of Evaluation Factor
In Research on Crowded Stampede Accident Risk at Subway Based on
Empowering Related Degree Method [9], under the statistical results of subway
crowded stampede events, taking the number of accidents’ casualties and the main
inﬂuencing factors into account, the risk state of various factors score was given.
The higher the score is, the higher the degree of danger. As the score was aimed at
the high incidence of accidents in subway, the conclusions had no representation.
The author summed up the risk factors and then overall values to make the out-
comes normalized. Finally, we got the weight of each layer of indicators as pre-
sented in Table 2.
nij is the weights of the degree of inﬂuence of crowded stampede events. Among
them, human factors are crowd crowded (20.7%), alarmed (7.0%), retrograde
(13.0%), falls and collisions (22.4%), and quarreling (1.7%). Environmental factors
are lighting defects (2.2%) and bad weather (4.0%). Equipment and facility factors
are made of elevator failure (4.7%), road slippery (6.9%) and power off (2.0%). For
management, there are emergency management deﬁciencies (10.6%), incorrect
information transmission (3.7%) and carry/placing overweight items (6.3%). The
percentage in parentheses refers to the number of factors contributing to the for-
mation of the subway congestion.

Q. Wang et al.

Combining weights (xij) is a weight of each two indexes of crowded and
stampede events(x) to evaluate their possession of weight (such as the combination
weights for x11 equal to its weight 24.4% divided by all secondary indicators and
then sum up), The hierarchical weight for x11 came out with its combined weights
to divide by each secondary indicator on the lifestyle layer then summed up, as
presented in Table 3.

Calculate the Whitening Weights of Each Indicator
The paper, ‘Research on Crowded Stamped Accident Risk at Subway Based on
Empowering Related Degree Method’ [9], chose the transfer station of Beijing
subway as the research object. The station is located in the junction between urban

ﬂow peaks are at a high level in the morning and evening, so inside station was
swarmed. During the early peak period, the ﬂows which come from the suburb lines
to their work places which lie in the centre of the city become the main force. And
because the station is surrounded by technology companies, therefore, the trafﬁc

Grey Clustering Analysis on the Factors Affecting
the Subway Stampede
The author chooses the transfer station of Beijing subway as the research object.
The site is located in the junction between urban and rural areas, which is the only
transfer station between ex-urban country subway lines and the city subway. The
station has two exits, two entrances, six escalators, four transfer stairs to the station.
In 2015, the station is on the list of the top 10 in and out of the station of Beijing
metro trafﬁc station and 10 interchange stations. The site has the obvious charac-
teristics of tidal ﬂow. In and out of trafﬁc and interchange ﬂow is very big in
morning and evening rush, and the station is more crowded. During the morning
rush, passengers go to work from ex-urban country metro line transfer to the city
subway constitute a morning rush “mainstay”. Due to the science and technology
enterprise around the site is relatively intensive, in and out of the station trafﬁc are
also considerable.
(1) Grey Analysis in Human Factors
Combined with Tables 6 and 7, in horizontal comparison, we can see the human
factors have values in all four grey classes and has the highest score of 0.503 in
third grey. With the risk level increased, the score value rises ﬁrst and then falls.
The third grey class is in more dangerous level, and the consequences of accident
are uncontrollable and accompanied with death. This just matches with the large
trafﬁc ﬂow, the concentration of travel time and the complex passenger type in this
subway. Vertical contrast, the proportion of human factors is lower in the ﬁrst and
second grey, so the risk level is smaller. There comes a conclusion that once the
person’s behaviour is no longer subject to or slightly affected by equipment,
facilities and environmental and management constraints, the risk level will be
greatly enhanced.

(2) Grey analysis in Equipment and Environment Factors
Equipment and environmental factors get the same clustering scores in the ﬁrst and
second grey, for the third and fourth clusters are both zero, due to its nature. As can
be seen from Table 4, scores given by experts share the low weight. Considering
the actual situation, the facilities and equipment is relatively perfect in the subway.
The elevators guided signs and ﬂow control facilities operating in a reasonable and
efﬁcient way. In addition to extreme weather, the impact by the environment is
weak. And most equipment is equipped with alarm devices and emergency stop
devices; the event can be found and controlled by taking measures immediately. So
that the scope of the accident will not expand. From the view of safety, equipment
and environment is taken into second grey.
(3) Grey Analysis in Management Factors
Management Factors values zero in the forth grey, but get scores in the other grey
classes and has the highest scored in the second grey. In general, management
factors and human factors have the same trend in the fourth grey (ﬁrst rise and then
decline). In the ﬁrst grey, the proportion of management is not great. As the
proportion of human factors increased, the management raised in the same time in
the second grey. Due to the environment and equipment factors disappear in third
and fourth grey, management factors are gradually reduced to 0.
After comprehensive analysis, put the subway station-crowded stampede risk
into the level two.
3.2
Recommendations for Control Measures
(1) For Human
The human factor has always changed its risk level as its weight changes. If you
want to reduce the risk level of crowded stampede events, it is necessary to reduce
the proportion of people to precede. Seen from the Whitening Rights Function
Table, once the environmental factors and equipment factor fail, the proportion of
crowded crowds will be greatly increased and the risk level will be increased. To
reduce
the
risk,
humanized
management
system
and
equipment
is
vital.
A comfortable environment can prevent passenger from quarreling, getting scared
and other bad emotions, while reducing passengers who retrogrades, falls and the
occurring of other accidents.
(2) For Equipment and Environment
Passenger’s travel can be facilitated by reasonable equipment. But in the subway,
the large ﬂow, complex passenger composition, long time and high audit operation
of facilities, hard not to lead to malfunctions. In this case, under the premise of
safety, devices can be chosen for its efﬁciency. And regular maintenance of the

equipment to ensure that alarm device and emergency stop system is working. For
weak parts of the fault, it should be subjected to real-time monitoring. Affected by
rain and snow weather, due to the characteristics of the stampede, the road slippery
becomes a big cause of stampede. Rain intrusion and water seepage and other
phenomena are prone to happen in subway for its special geographical location,
intelligent facilities should be equipped to prevent the occurrence of such bad
weather.
(3) For Management
Management factors works are closely related to human factors. According to the
score in 6, comparing the human factors and management factors, draw the Fig. 1.
Although the management and human have the same trend, the management factor
score peaks before human. This indicates the advance of management, thus reaction
should be taken before human changes. At the same time, management works rely
on facilities, institutional and rules in a speciﬁc environment of speciﬁc objects.
When an accident occurs, what the manager need to do is quickly respond to the
emergency accident, understand the location of the accident, the scene and the
scope of the situation and convey the situation to the location of the subway to
stabilize the mood of passengers and to prevent the expand of personal factors.

Conclusions
(1) A grey clustering model for the risk analysis of subway crowded stampede was
established. The analysis overcomes the limitations and solves the problem of
cannot calculate the connotation between the various factors. The model con-
nects various factors into linkage and provides a new method for the crowded
stampede risk assessment of subway stations.
(2) The grey clustering model is applied to a number of sample stations in Beijing
subway, and the evaluation results are basically consistent with the actual

situation. This model can not only evaluate the overall risk of crowded stam-
pede accident, but also get the root cause and failure of the accident according
to the evaluation result. For the other subway stations, according to the actual
targeted to modify the evaluation index, the cause of the subway crowded
stampede can be found and targeted measures can be put forward.
(3) The analysis of the risk of subway crowding accident is complex system
engineering. The indicators and weights of grey clustering evaluation should be
further adjusted and revised to ensure results of the subway crowded stampede
accident risk analysis is scientiﬁc and reliability.

Risk Assessment Research Used in Subway
Crowded Stampede with Grey Analytic
Hierarchy Process (AHP)
Qiquan Wang
Abstract In this paper, mathematical model is considered to be used. Evaluation
index system is constructed on the basis of analyzing the subway crowded stam-
pede from the people and things, environment and management factors in a large
number of objective classiﬁcations. The subway crowded stampede modeling
analysis and assessment are quantiﬁed with grey hierarchical analysis method,
concluding that the evaluation results of assessment instance of crowded stampede
risk are in intermediate levels. During the process of evaluation instances actual
operation, trafﬁc in commuting is huge and passenger transfers of stairs and ele-
vators are very crowded, which has high risk of stampede and need to strengthen
the control to prevent crowded stampede. The safety evaluation results are funda-
mental identical to the actual state. Evaluation analysis results show that grey
hierarchical analysis method has certain practicability, which is worth to promoting.

Introduction
As a modern means of transport, subway trafﬁc has the advantages of convenient,
fast, stable and large volume. Around the world in the modern city, the subway
trafﬁc has been more and more widely used, bearing the more and more important
passenger transport tasks. The low cost of subway attracted to more and more
people, making the subway appeared unprecedented “crowded.” According to the
statistical data of Chinese urban rail transit association in the end of 2014, 95
subway stations in 22 cities have been built with 2900 km operation mileage.

Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou have entered the rail transit network. Expanding
subway network, the number of passenger is rising at the same time. On March
2013, Beijing subway trafﬁc breaks through 10 million person-times, becoming the
world’s busiest subway.
Every line of subway tunnels is such crowded in the morning and evening rush
hour. A huge passenger ﬂow gathering to the platform and channel of the narrow
space, once affected by accidental factors, which is likely to cause safety accidents
such as trample. Therefore, research on the risk assessment of subway crowded
stamped effectively prevents crowded stampede and has great signiﬁcance
improving the level of the subway operation safety management.
Foreign researches on crowded stampede mainly include R.S.C. Lee and R.L.
Hughesin Australian, introducing the continuous lines of trafﬁc model and quan-
titative analyzing crowded and trampled by instances, respectively, and then predict
the behavior of the crowd. Researchers L. Heibing of German are analyzed the
stampede crowds in panic, putting forward the “social force” model [1]. C.M.
Henein and T. White in Canadian proved Kirchner cellular automata model in the
study, based on the analysis of crowd evacuation behavior with multi-agent tech-
nology by computer model. L.H. Eigeas and other scholars in French propose two
crowds gathered phenomenon in the study, setting up a relevant model and ana-
lyzing the crowded stampede predisposing factors [2]. Domestic researches on
subway crisis management and safety management theories mainly include Zhang
et al. [3] and Jiao and Song [4] who analyzed the crowded stampede risk control
efﬁciency by using data envelopment method (DEA) to establish evaluation model
from the aspects of technical efﬁciency, scale efﬁciency and the comprehensive
efﬁciency. Wang [5] analyzed the evolution mechanism and rot holes of the subway
stampede and proposed preventive and emergency measurements. Huo et al. [6]
used the entropy weight method to determine the combination of subjective and
objective factors weight of the subway crowded stampede. Peng and Jiang [7]
studied warning and challenges of crowded stampede in urban rail transit station.
The above studies focused on crowded stampede behavior mechanism of the
research or predisposing factors, evolution mechanism and risk control efﬁciency of
subway crowded stampede, and quantitative analysis of the subway crowded
stampede risk is not deep. With the increasing degree in the subway trafﬁc crowded
degrees, needs to be carried out the analysis and study of risk assessment method
speciﬁcally for the subway crowded stampede.

The Risk Assessment Index System of Subway Crowded
Stampede
On the basis of the survey analysis, the subway typical crowded stampede accidents
for nearly ten years were statistically analyzed, and the crowded stampede main
reasons as shown in Fig. 1.
364
Q. Wang

According to statistics analysis with historical data, the subway crowded
stampede mainly occurred in intensive period of time such as commuting time and
holidays. Accident place areas mainly include the escalators, transfers, up and
downstairs and the boarding gates. The factors induced subway crowded stampede
are mainly about four aspects which are human, objective, environment and
management including crowd, stampede, retrograde reﬂux, fall down, collision,
elevator fault, stair and road slip, quarrel, electric short/circuit, lighting defect, bad
weather, emergency management defect, error in information transmission and
carrying excess placing items [8]. Subway crowded stampede incentive is complex.
It is a multifactor, multivariable and multi-level man–machine–environment sys-
tem. On the basis of lots of researches and historical accidents statistics and
experience summaries, using the idea of safety system engineering, four levels of
evaluation indexes and 13 secondary safety evaluation index systems are set con-
sidering with the human factors, objective factors, environmental factors and
management factors [8]. Risk assessment index systems of factors are shown in
Table 1. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is used for distribution of the weight
in the table, and the DPS systems are used for calculation [9].

The Model of Subway Crowded Stampede with AHP
Assessment Analysis
According to the grey analytic hierarchy process (AHP), the inﬂuence factors of the
subway crowded stampede are divided into three levels. According to the principle
of analytic hierarchy process (AHP), Table 1 shows multiple evaluation indexes
with the different grouping attributes. Each group set as a level, aligning the

(Ui; i ¼ 1; 2; 3; 4Þ and index layer (Vij, i ¼ 1; 2; 3; 4; j ¼ 1; 2; . . .; ni). S is on behalf
of comprehensive evaluation value of evaluation object. U is on behalf of the set of
Ui as U ¼ U1; U2; U3; U4

Vi ¼ Vi1; Vi2; . . .; Vim
f
g. Constructing evaluation mode program is as follows [10,
11]:
(1) Determine the rating criteria of evaluation index Vij. While evaluating the
subway crowded stampede, because of the qualitative indicators of Vij, a
uniﬁed evaluation criterion has not formed yet. Therefore, to transfer index Vij
into quantitative index and to divide quality grade of assessment index to
excellent, good, medium and poor level, corresponding as 4, 3, 2, 1 points.
The index levels are between two adjacent levels as 3.5, 2.5 and 1.5 points.
Speciﬁc grade standard depends on the experiences of experts.
(2) Determine the weight of assessment index Ui and Uij. According to the
standard of evaluating index system, the degree of importance of the index
W in target layer the index Ui in standard layer and index Vij in target layer are
different, the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) can be used to determine
weights of factors.
(3) Organize the experts to evaluate. Set serial numbers of evaluation experts as
m; m ¼ 1; 2; . . .; p; which means to grade each evaluation level with p experts
as index measured values and expert experiences and ﬁll in evaluation expert’s
evaluation table.
(4) To evaluate sample matrix. According to assessment result of evaluation
experts, index Vij is valued dijm, and the evaluation matrix D of the sample
object are obtained.
(5) Determine evaluation grey classes. That is to determine the grey class, grey
numbers and white functions of the grey classes. According to actual analysis,
evaluation index levels adopt four evaluation grey classes. Grey class serial
numbers are e, e ¼ 1; 2; 3; 4, presented as excellent, good, medium and poor in
which grey number and white function are shown as follows:

Risk Assessment Instance Analysis of Subway Crowded
Stampede
Based on the analysis of the subway crowded stampede AHP assessment model, the
transfer station of Beijing subway is selected as the research object. The station is
located in the junction between urban and rural areas, which has two exports, two
entrances, six escalators and four transfer to the stairs. The site has the obvious
characteristics of tidal ﬂow. Morning and evening rush transfer trafﬁc and passenger
ﬂow are very big and crowded. During the morning rush, passengers from exurban
county metro line transfer to the city subway constitute a “mainstay” morning rush
to work. Due to the relatively intensive site around science and technology enter-
prise, the station trafﬁc is also considerably huge [12].
(1) To determine the evaluation for the object class
According to Table 1, determine the evaluation for the object class.
(2) To determine the structure of the underlying element combination weight

The evaluation result of the subway crowded stampede risk is S= 2.7154, which
is between medium level and good level. The subway crowded stampede
possibility is not high, but crowded stampede has great randomness and easily
sudden happen. It is recommended that the subway escalator, transfers to the
up- and downstairs and boarding gates are relatively densely populated places
in the early rush hour and strengthen the control, preventing crowded stampede.

Conclusions
The paper uses the grey analytic hierarchy process (AHP), building a grey hier-
archical analysis model for the evaluation of subway crowded stampede and taking
the evaluation and validation of instance analysis conclusion in the subway station.
Conclusions are as follows:
(1) The subway crowded stampede factors involve human, objective, human,
management factors and so on, and statistical analysis of the subway typical
crowded stampede for nearly ten years is made, which summarizes the subway
crowded stampede predisposing factors. On the basis above, the crowded
stampede risk assessment index system is used with the grey analytic hierarchy
process (AHP) to construct and determine the weight.
(2) Using the grey analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to evaluate risk of subway
crowded stampede, the result value of analysis instances is 2.7154, which lies
between medium and good level. In the process of actual operation of evalu-
ation instances, tidal trafﬁc during commuting is huge. Passenger transfer of
elevators and stair is very crowded, and the risk of stampede is quite high. The
evaluation results are basically identical with the actual state of safety. This
method is certain practical, which is worth using in the risk assessment of
subway crowded stampede.
(3) The grey analytic hierarchy process (AHP) combines qualitative and quanti-
tative analysis of the assessment, which can be implemented through the
computer programmed with the DPS data computing systems. It can rapidly
calculate the assessment results of evaluation factors, laying a certain founda-
tion of the popularization and application of this method.

Harmonic Detection Method of Electric
Equipment Malfunction
Wen Zhang and Biaocan Ling
Abstract In modern mass production, the safe and normal use of electrical
equipment is the necessary condition to ensure the stable operation of production
line. Electrical equipment is the basic unit of the power system. Conventional
methods of stopping, splitting, touching and maintaining electrical equipment on a
regular basis have some drawbacks. So a new non-contact electrical fault detection
method—harmonic detection method is adopted. We can as far as possible to avoid
accidents and economic losses due to electrical equipment failures, If we use
high-order harmonics to carry out electrical equipment fault diagnosis. This tech-
nique can be used for non-contact detection of remote equipment, occlusion
equipment, underwater equipment and so on.

Introduction
With the continuous development of science and technology, the level of
automation of industrial production continues to increase, the role of electrical
equipment in modern production and the impact is growing. Take the necessary
detection measures of equipment running state and advance detection safety hazards
of equipment. These are essential to correct diagnosis of equipment failure and
timely troubleshooting [1]. Failure or failure in the operation of electrical equipment
not only results in signiﬁcant economic loss, but may even lead to catastrophic
casualties and adverse social impacts. So the security and reliability of equipment or
system are extremely important. In the actual production, in order to ensure stable
operation of electrical equipment. As a new type of fault diagnosis technology,
harmonic diagnosis is of great signiﬁcance to reduce the cost, reduce the outage
time and reduce the maintenance cost by diagnosing the deterioration state of the

motor and frequency inverter by using the current harmonics [2]. This method can
greatly satisfy the electrical equipment does not have to stop, split and contact the
equipment for fault diagnosis. The diagnostic method can quantify the degradation
degree and performance of the equipment and diagnose and predict the reliability of
the equipment [3, 4], which is the biggest difference from the traditional detection
method. ZKLK energy technology companies to introduce Japan’s invention patent
in China, “for electrical equipment, harmonic diagnostic methods,” and its whole
machine ATC-KS series of electrical equipment fault harmonic detector [5].

Electrical Equipment and Harmonic
In principle, Harmonics can occur through the spatial harmonics in the rotating
machine such as generators and motors, while in a stationary device such as a
transformer, the nonlinearity of the core occurs. Stress aging caused by abnormal
operation of the equipment is the main cause of harmonic generation. Stress aging
mainly includes thermal aging, voltage stress aging, mechanical stress aging,
environmental stress aging and composite stress aging, so harmonic technology is
used to diagnose the aging of electrical equipment.
Internationally recognized deﬁnition of the harmonic is the sinusoidal compo-
nent of a periodic electric quantity, and the frequency is an integral multiple of the
fundamental frequency. In the generator, motor, frequency converter and other
electrical equipment used in the process, will inevitably produce harmonics. These
current waveforms, including harmonics, are called distortion wave [2].
According to the Fourier series expansion of distortion wave, you can decom-
pose into a number of different frequency sine wave, which can be decomposed into
various harmonics. Usually the distortion wave of the electrical circuit is sym-
metrical. And it is an odd function (odd function: the parity of mathematical
function). That is, only odd harmonics occur in most normal electrical circuits as
shown in Fig. 1.
The even-order harmonic currents shown in Fig. 2 are limited in the present
situation. The harmonics present in the electrical circuit are all odd times. Electrical

equipment is composed of electrical parts of the coil (conductor is covered by
insulation) and as the core of the magnetic circuit or rotary shaft and bearings and
other mechanical parts [3].

Detection Methods and Technical Characteristics
The dynamic harmonic detection method of the electric power equipment is to use
the harmonic sensor to carry on the signal acquisition to the equipment power bus.
ATC-KS series of electrical equipment fault harmonic detector will automatically
record and analyze the collected harmonic signal, compared with the expert data-
base, and the user can automatically obtain the device status report [5]. The sample
of experts database has more than 32,000. The main technical features are as
follows:
(1) No downtime, no need to crack the equipment, detection of production
equipment completely intact, no impact on the production process.
(2) Real-time collection of harmonic signal of equipment in operation, get the most
intuitive equipment running state.
(3) Expert database automatically generates equipment status report, without
complex manual analysis, the user access to ATC-KS nearly 50 years of
electrical equipment failure harmonic detection experience.
(4) Generate trend management report automatically, accurate tracking the bad
installation, aging and fault status of equipment.
(5) Can accurately analyze the motor and its primary load, frequency converter and
inverter, transformers, generators, industrial capacitors, UPS, high-power bat-
tery packs and industrial transmission cables aging and fault status.

The Difference Between Harmonic Detection, Vibration
Method and Infrared Method for Drive Electrical
Equipment
Compared with the vibration method, the high-order harmonic method has wider
applicability and can accurately judge the electrical deterioration of the equipment.
Compared with the infrared method, the high-order harmonic method can detect the
signs of potential deterioration of the motor and the generator earlier, and it is easy
to prevent and adjust the maintenance plan at the early stage, and the diagnosis is
more accurate [5]. The ATC-KS system uses expert libraries to quickly generate
reports that provide trend management and adapt to modern industry trends in
equipment trend management (Table 9).

Conclusion
Electrical equipment such as electric motors, frequency converters, transformers,
generators, in different states of deterioration and different working conditions, will
produce different high-order harmonics. After careful attention and detailed analysis
of the harmonics generated by various. And found that the electrical equipment
generated by the higher harmonics and equipment state has a direct correspondence.
It can provide the basis for maintenance. According to the diagnosis time given by
the harmonic diagnosis technology, it can realize the targeted maintenance and
repair, greatly reduce the abnormal downtime of the production equipment and
reduce unnecessary waste of time and spare parts. This method is mainly used for
various electric drive equipments online condition monitoring and can be widely
used in electric power, chemical industry, machinery transportation and rail
transportation and other ﬁelds.

The Feasibility Study of Airborne Image
Recordings for Aircraft Accident
Investigation
Lin Yang
Abstract Several safety recommendations in the Final Report of aircraft accident
investigation recommend that provisions for the availability of image recordings be
included in International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) document Annex 6.
The issues leading to these recommendations vary from a lack of data not available
on the ﬂight recorders to analyse human performance, to the accident aircraft was
not equipped with a ﬂight recorder, or where it was unclear what was displayed to
the ﬂight crew during the occurrence. Meanwhile, it was concerned that the pro-
tection for image recordings was not adequate and agreed to postpone discussions
of these proposals until the conclusion of the work of the safety information pro-
tection. In the light of the progress made with the provisions for the protection of
accident and incident records, these issues were again discussed the need including
recordings of information displayed to the ﬂight crew and bulk erase function for
both CVRs and airborne image recordings. The discussion on the technical and
social aspects related implementation of airborne image recording is still existed.

Introduction
On 29 November 2013 at 09:26 UTC, an Embraer ERJ 190-100 IGW/C9-EMC
conducted a ﬂight from Maputo airport to Luanda, Angola [1]. The ﬂight operations
were normal until the Namibian radar data revealed that the aircraft commenced a

sudden descent from the normal cruising level of FL 380. Radar contact and voice
contact were lost with Air Trafﬁc Services (ATS). The investigation found that the
inputs to the control panels by the captain, who remained alone in the cockpit when
the ﬁrst ofﬁcer went out to the restroom, caused this Embraer ERJ 190-100 IGW to
depart from FL 380 and subsequent collision with the terrain. A contributing factor
is the deviation to airlines standard operating procedures as a result of a single pilot
living in the cockpit. One of the safety recommendations is that “ICAO” should
review the feasibility of installing image recorder inside and outside the ﬂight
cockpit. The image recorder inside should capture the information on who was
ﬂying the airplane when the event occurred, the image recorder outside should
provide what happened within the cabin and whether these actions were in relation
to the plane’s normal operations.
On 23 August 2013 at 17:17 UTC, a Eurocopter AS332L2 Super Puma heli-
copter G-WNSB with 16 passengers and 2 crews onboard crashed during
approaching to Sumburgh airport, Shetland Islands [2]. Pilots unnoticed the
decreasing airspeed until the helicopter engine power insufﬁcient and lose of control
in-ﬂight. The pilots performed an unsuccessful recovery. Finally, the helicopter
struck the water approximately 1.72 nm to airport. Four passengers were fatally
injured. Pilots could not situate their recollection of the accident, and recorded data
from combination recorders did not deliver the information of the cockpit. One of
the safety recommendations has reiterated the need for airborne image recordings to
record pilot conducts during ﬂying within the ﬂight compartment, in aircraft that
shall have ﬂight recorders.
On 2 September 1998, a MD-11/HB-IWF conducted Swissair Flight 111 from
JFK, New York, to Geneva, Switzerland [3]. Because of smoke and ﬁre in the ﬂight
compartment after take-off, the pilots decided to divert to alternative airport in
Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. Before landing to this alternative airport, it crashed
in the sea. The investigators found that the ﬁre and smoke from ceiling, forward and
rear of bulkhead in the cockpit lead to lose of control. It took 4 years and over
50 million Canadian dollars [4] to carry out a search and rescue, and investigation.
The accident investigation authority believes that airborne image recording would
largely help this accident investigation. They would determine promptly what
happened by means of this information.
This article discusses the feasibility study on airborne image recordings and
aimed to objectively and rationally uncover the strengths and weaknesses of air-
borne image recordings.

Additional Tools for the Investigation
2.1
Assessment of Airborne Image Recordings
Flight recorders have helped determine the reason of an accident or incident. Yet,
certain categories of aircraft are still not equipped with these critical technologies.
In other cases, ﬂight data and/or cockpit voice recorders may have been present, but
some information could only have been provided from an image recorder. Image
recordings can help to ﬁll in the gaps by providing ﬁrst-hand knowledge of crew
activities.
Airborne image recordings can signiﬁcantly contribute to the analysis of the
behaviour of crew with regard to the conditions encountered, the actions taken and
the results obtained during the ﬂight. Though it does not make it possible to directly
understand natural mental processes, such as instinctive, emotional or cognitive
processes, image recording gives access to the observable part of the crew inter-
actions, i.e. actions and communications. Some markers of these interactions
(pointing to an object with the ﬁnger, thumb up to acknowledge, manipulation,
actions through human–machine interface (HMI), etc.) are not easily accessible or
are inaccessible through FDR and CVR recordings.
An image recording can help the type of actions being recorded and record those
that are not followed by effects on aircraft systems. In the light of the investigation
on the AF447 accident in 2009 [5], it is stated that review of the information
stemmed from ﬂight recorders is challenging to establish the displays that were
available to the ﬂight crew on their control panel and instrument at that time,
especially the directives from the Flight Director when they appear again. It is also
incapable to know if ﬂight crew had made any endeavour to start again the auto
pilot. Airborne image recordings would help clearly identify the actions performed
on the aircraft selectors, the result of these actions on the aircraft and the crew
performing the action, especially in the absence of verbalization from the crew.
In addition, ﬂight crews may be required to manipulate data carriers that are not
integrated into the aircraft and whose elements are inaccessible via the FDR. The
use of Electronic Flight Bag (EFB), iPADs or paper documentation is difﬁcult to
analyse via existing recorders. The information collected from image recordings
could also help operators improve operational and safety oversight.
2.2
Airborne Image Recordings Solutions
Airborne image recording of the ﬂight compartment is a technology that is
approaching fully developed. Appareo Vision 1000 is a self-contained ﬂight
recording solution that records ﬂight data, cockpit voice and airborne images in one
box. It is small and light, assisted by the ALERTS ground support software, which
can be used to readout and analyse the ﬂight operations and identify operational

deviations. If the deviation or unsafe events were to occur, the recorded information
is a priceless investigation resources, giving the investigator the information on
what happened and largely reduce the investigation duration and cost. It has Type
Certiﬁcates (TCs) on the aircraft of Airbus Helicopters, AgustaWestland and Piper.
Also, it has FAA Supplemental Type Certiﬁcates (STCs) on the aircraft of Bell 206,
Airbus Helicopters, AgustaWestland, Diamond and Cessna.
Another product is Sentinel Crash Survivable Memory Unit (CSMU) series
manufactured by ETEP Company, which is fully integrated solution for ﬂight data,
airborne image, cockpit voice communications and storage on various military or
ﬂight test applications. The Sentinel CSMU ED-112 series is lightweight which is
following the ARINC 767 speciﬁcation.
2.3
Standards on Airborne Image Recordings
ICAO has developed policies regarding the applicability and operation of 3 types of
airborne image recordings. A Class C AIR or Airborne Image Recording Systems
(AIRS) which is able to record ﬂight data on instruments and control panels
exhibited to the pilot(s) has been accepted as an option for the installation in
turbine-powered aircraft to capture ﬂight data and has been incorporated into Annex
6, Parts I, II and III [6]. Class B catches data-link communication. Also, the current
speciﬁcation in Annex 6 for Class A airborne image recording is to capture the
cockpit environment and provide information additional to ﬂight recorders. To
consider pilots privacy issue, the recording of such images shall not capture some
parts of pilot body, such as their upper torso, while they sat in the pilot seats.
Currently, provisions for the carriage of Class A are not included in Annex 6.
The current speciﬁcation in the European regulations ED-112A [7] and ED-155
classiﬁed airborne image recorders into 6 classes from Class A to Class F based on
the purpose of the image recording system. It requires Class A airborne image
recorder to capture information additional to ﬂight recorders, such as human fac-
tors; Class B records data-link communication. Class C records ﬂight data on
instruments and control panels. Class D captures the head-up display, and Class E
captures other camera images beyond the cockpit, such as cargo or cabin com-
partment images; Class F provides external view, for example, to capture forward
view or aircraft parts such as landing gear.
Several States has been closely monitoring this regulation development and will
keep working with ICAO and industry to guarantee the conformity of ground rule
being introduced when appropriate. Civil aviation authorities of States will deliver
formally a regulatory amendment of the requirement to equip airborne imaging
recorders in cockpits of airplane.

2.4
Response to Airborne Image Recordings
Although it has been debated more than a decade between investigators and reg-
ulatory agencies, the regulators continue unchanged the position which is not
convinced by the new improvements that airborne image recordings would beneﬁt
to air safety. ICAO Annex 13 Aircraft Accident and Incident Investigation has been
revised to give the protection and non-disclosure to the image recordings, oppo-
sition against legislation still exist.
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the USA also appears reluctant to
respond. They consider that there is no conclusive conﬁrmation to mandate airborne
image recording installation. The deﬁciency ﬁle is assigned a dormant status.
Also, the multi-national Airline Pilots Association has their own position on
airborne image recording. While the International Federation of Air Line Pilots’
Associations (IFALPA) strongly supports initiatives to improve safety, it believes
that the use of airborne image recordings would not provide signiﬁcant value to an
accident investigation. Visual data are also subject to misinterpretation, which can
lead the investigation astray and use for purposes beyond the investigation activi-
ties. Considering extremely low rate of accidents in commercial aviation, the
information provided by airborne image recordings in an accident investigation
would be minimal and has not been proven to enhance safety, but the massive
infringement of privacy represented by video recordings, as well as the fundamental
personal rights of the ﬂight crews.
Therefore, until the recordings and transcripts have been effectively protected,
IFALPA will remain strongly opposed to any image recorders which capture any
part of the crew. The Federation supports taking advantage of the existing tech-
nology of the aviation recorder to provide a better understanding of the environment
of the aircraft and believes that safety management is the most effective way ahead
for proactive safety improvement.
2.5
Efforts on the Proposals
In Europe, the protection of CVRs from exposure in an accident or incident
investigation is stipulated in Regulation (EU) No 996/2010. With the implemen-
tation of safety management among airlines, it is realized that CVR recordings have
the possibility to replay and analyse beyond investigation activities in order to
maintain or improve air safety. Consequently, Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 has
been revised in order to strengthen the effectively protection and prevent the
unsuitable use and exposure of CVR recordings. The levels of protection existing
for CVRs shall be broadened to airborne image recorders.
On 1 April 2016, ICAO issued a State letter (AN 6/1.1-16/20) on the adoption of
Amendment 15 to Annex 13. Some of the key elements and considerations of the
amendment include: enhancement of the protection of investigation records in

Annex 13, while balancing the objectives of the investigation and other public
interests; effective means to protect records in the custody of or under the control of
the accident investigation authority; support to States in the administration of the
“balancing test” by the designated competent authority; recognition that different
circumstances require different protective safeguards and that full protection may be
counter-productive; accommodation of different legal systems and States’ practices
in implementing effective protection of investigation records.

Conclusion
Critical changes need to reduce transportation accidents and save lives and expand
use of recorders to enhance air safety. Under the global CVR/FDR rulemaking
initiative, both civil aviation authorities and the industry develop requirements to
supported the accident investigation authorities’ safety recommendation to reach a
proposal and to supplement the current ﬂight recording requirements, that is, to
provide provisions for the recording of control panels exhibited to the pilots, as well
as operation of switches and selectors by the pilots. The proposal includes a pro-
vision for a bulk erase function for both CVRs and AIRs.
The applicability of airborne image recorder is limited to the aeroplanes with a
maximum take-off mass of above 27,000 kg, and the application for type certiﬁ-
cation put forward to a Contracting State not before 2023. The aeroplane that meets
both requirements shall have a crash-protected ﬂight recorder which shall record
images of the ﬂight deck exhibited to the pilots, as well as operation of switches and
selectors by the pilots as deﬁned.
Meanwhile, on or after 1 January 2023, a ﬂight crew-operated bulk erase
function shall be provided on the ﬂight deck which, when activated, modiﬁes the
recording of a CVR and AIR, while this recording is not able to be download or
readout by general methods. The installation shall be designed to prevent activation
during ﬂight. Furthermore, the bulk erase function shall not be active when an
accident or incident occurred.
The operation of switches and selectors and the images displayed to the ﬂight
crew from electronic displays shall be captured by image sensors or other electronic
means. The recording of operation of switches and selectors by the ﬂight crew shall
include any switch or selector that will affect the operation and the navigation of the
aircraft; selection of normal and alternate systems. The images displayed to the
pilots shall include the primary ﬂight and navigation displays; aircraft system
monitoring displays; engine indication displays; trafﬁc, terrain, and weather dis-
plays; crew alerting systems displays; stand-by instruments; and installed EFB.
At the same time, the recording of such images shall not capture some parts of
pilot body, such as their upper torso, while they sat in the pilot seats.

Introduction
As one of the most important weaponries of the electronic countermeasure force,
Radar Jamming Equipment (RJE) can weaken the operational effectiveness of the
enemy’s radar through interfering and deceiving all kinds of their radars so that
friendly forces, weapons and important targets can be well protected [1]. Regarded
as the generic term of various kinds of radars that are used in air defense combats,
the Air Defense Radar (ADR) is one of the most crucial equipments which provide
air information and control other weapons. In the process of joint operations of air

defense force and electronic countermeasure force, the electromagnetic space in the
battle ﬁeld congests with various radar signals and electromagnetic interference
signals, making the electromagnetic environment quite complicated [2]. Under such
circumstances, this essay adopts coordinated methods to analyze how to bring the
combat capability of the RJE and the ADR into full play without affecting each
other’s operation so as to achieve electromagnetic compatibility.

The Coordinated Method Based on Frequency Domain,
Time Domain and Space Domain
Frequency domain, time domain and space domain are three fundamental elements
to the joint operations of the RJE and the ADR. In the process of joint operation, the
RJE and the ADR will interfere with each other only when frequency domain, time
domain and space domain meet relevant conditions. The operational control
authority should adopt different measures based on these elements to achieve
effective joint operation.
2.1
Coordinated Method Based on Frequency Domain
This method means that in order to secure different equipments’ frequency chan-
nels, the operational commander should give managerial control on frequency of
the RJE and the ADR to avoid the disturbance from relevant equipments.
Frequency domain overlapping is the precondition of disturbance. The RJE covers a
wide range of frequency spectrums, among which many frequency bands are used
in ADR. Therefore, coordinated method based on frequency domain is the most
commonly used and fundamental method.
(1) Informing frequency information
Air defense force and electronic countermeasure force should cooperate and get
familiar with the speciﬁc information of the ADR and the RJE, such as radar
frequency range, frequency hopping modes and jamming patterns. The electronic
countermeasure force also needs to report enemy’s frequency list to the command
which has frequency spectrum administration authority and to provide the basis to
adjust the frequency for the command [3].
(2) Conﬁrming the protected frequency
US military regulations: Joint Restricted Frequency is a function, network and
frequency list which is geographically structured, time sensitive and protective. To
ensure that friendly forces achieve their goals, the required frequency should be
conﬁned within its minimum number [4]. The protective frequency of the ADR
392
K. Li et al.

should be part of the Joint Restricted Frequency. It can be determined by the air
defense forces and implemented after it has been approved by the command of the
spectrum management authority. These frequencies are crucial for the work of the
radar. The disturbance from electronic countermeasure force should be banned
unless it is absolutely necessary, and under the circumstances, it must be approved
by the headquarters to interfere. It must be noted that the protective frequency is
usually time sensitive and should be updated regularly.
(3) Strengthening frequency management
Air defense force needs to develop a strict frequency plan, clarify the right
timing for the use of protective frequency and the relevant approval authority, and
notify this information to the electronic countermeasure force. The equipment
operators are strictly forbidden to use the protective frequency without approval. At
present, the radar working frequency can be directly managed or set in the operating
system of some new Air Defense Radar equipment, which is quite convenient to
operate. But operators need to be very cautious to prevent operational mistakes.
2.2
Coordinated Method Based on Time Domain
This method means that the RJE and ADR have joint operation in combat timing,
duration and sequence, so that the overall air defense operation is uniﬁed and well
organized. With the improvement in the performance of modern weapons, the
reaction time left to the air defense system in the war is declining, requiring the air
defense force and the electronic countermeasure force to cooperate with each other
with higher accuracy and efﬁciency.
(1) Having consistent combat time
Consistent combat time is the basis of time domain coordination, which is
directly related to the accuracy of the air defense force and the electronic coun-
termeasure force. Current RJE and ADR have their own local clock. Crystal
oscillator frequency of different equipments may have some deviation because of
the temperature and electromagnetic interference. RJE and ADR can draw support
from BeiDou Navigation System, BPM timing system and other methods to cali-
brate their own clock, keeping high-precision synchronization in time.
(2) Planning precise collaboration time
Relevant personnel can plan precise collaboration time according to the air raid
target situation, RJE and technical performance of ADR. First, set up a speciﬁc time
to unify the action of the time point, that is, with a clear point of time to unify the
different directions of RJE and ADR in different positions or make them attack the
same target. Second, divide an operation into different stages and make different
operation plans for RJE and ADR in different stages.
Research on the Joint Operation of the Radar Jamming Equipment …
393

(3) Adjusting the coordination time promptly
Air raid and anti-air combat battleﬁeld environment is not static, and relevant
personnel should keep obtaining combat information, analyzing and calculating key
time nodes of the next action. They should control air defense combat coordination
time in accordance with the overall combat plan and time node, timely detect time
deviation and make it back on track so that the plan can proceed strictly in
accordance with order and time.
2.3
Coordinated Method Based on Space Domain
This method means that the combat conﬁguration, the zone of action, the direction
and the height of the RJE and the ADR are reasonably stipulated, so that the radar
power range and the disturbance zone are reasonably overlapping, closely con-
nected and supporting, and at the same time, ensure electromagnetic compatibility
between them. Yet, because of different operational mission and equipments’
performance, the speciﬁc requirements toward the RJE and the ADR are also
different. The operators need to be ﬂexible. Here the author will only discuss the
conﬁguration which ensures the electromagnetic compatibility.
(1) The bit error ratio of the ADR
When receiving noise interference from the RJE, the bit error ratio that the ADR
receive is [5]:

¼ PjGj
PtGt
 4pcj
r
 G0
t
Gt
 R4
t
R2
j
 Dfr
Dfj
:
ð1Þ
In the formula, Pj refers to the launching power of the RJE; Gj refers to the gain
of the RJE’s antenna in radar’s direction; cj refers to the interference signal to the
polarization coefﬁcient of radar’s antenna for the, generally cj ¼ 0:5; Rj refers to the
distance between the RJE and the radar; Dfj refers to disturbance bandwidth; Pt
refers to the launching power of radar; Gt refers to the gain in the direction of the
main lobe of the radar antenna; r refers to effective reﬂection area of the target; Rt
refers to the distance between the target and the radar; Dfr refers to the bandwidth of
the radar receiver; and G0
t refers to the gain of the radar antenna in the direction of
the RJE.
What is different from the confrontation between air jammer and ground radar is
that the targets of the RJE and the ADR combat targets are both air targets. Since it
is rare to have the situation when the main lobe of the RJE interferes with the main
lobe of the radar, the major consideration should be the interference of the RJE to
side lobe of the radar. It can be calculated in three ways: The ﬁrst way is to calculate
according to the antenna direction pattern of the radar and the RJE; considering that
the direction patterns are different and the expressions are complicated, the second
394
K. Li et al.

way is to calculate according to simpliﬁed antenna pattern [5]; the third way is to
divide the relative position of the RJE and the radar into four situations: the main
lobe of the RJE to the main lobe of the radar, the main lobe of the RJE to side lobe
of the radar, the side lobe of the RJE to the side lobe of the radar and the side lobe
of the RJE to the main lobe of the radar [6]. When the side lobe interference occurs,
it should be calculated by taking a gain interval of the side lobe or taking the
average gain of the side lobe. When it comes to the main lobe of the RJE to the
main lobe of the radar situation or the side lobe of the RJE to the main lobe of the
radar, then in formula (1), G0
t ¼ Gt.
If the interference is valid, the bit error ratio should be greater than or equal to
the pressing factor Kj, which is
Prj

 Kj:
ð2Þ
The suppression coefﬁcient is the ratio of the minimum interference signal
required by the input end of radar receiver to the radar echo signal power, when the
radar detection probability drops to 0.1 [7]. It is
Kj ¼ Pj=Pr Pd¼0:1
j
:
ð3Þ
The suppression coefﬁcient is a comprehensive function which is composed of
the modulation pattern of the interference signal, the interference signal quality,
response characteristic of the receiver and the signal processing method. In docu-
ment 7, the suppression coefﬁcient values of the automatic radar and the radar
which uses wide-angle or distance monitor as the terminal device is analyzed. In
document 8, the noise interference suppression coefﬁcient with different modulation
styles is calculated. In document 9, it is pointed out that for conventional pulsed
radar, agile frequency radar and frequency diversity radar, interference suppression
coefﬁcient is normally 3 dB.
(2) The modiﬁcation to the model based on non-ideal interference signal
In the calculation of formula (1), the interference signal input by radar receiver is
Gaussian noise. In terms of information theory, the best interference wave is the one
with the largest entropy, which is uncertain. Under circumstances of ﬁxed average
power, Gaussian noise will reach its top entropy in random wave, which makes
Gaussian noise the ideal interference wave. But in practice, it cannot be achieved
because the amplitude of the random variable of Gaussian noise distribution is
inﬁnitely great [7]. Document 10 suggests that noise quality can be used to measure
the quality of the actual interference signal. The noise quality factor represents the
ratio of the power Pj0 required for the ideal interfering signal and the interference
power Pj required for the actual interference signal under the same masking effect,
which means

ð4Þ
Usually, the noise quality factor is 1 [7]. The results of the jammers in service
or being tested show that the noise quality of the actually interference signal has a
loss of 17 dB compared to the ideal Gaussian noise [8], which is g ¼ 0:02.
(3) Modiﬁcation of the model from pulse compression technique
When all other conditions are the same, the results of the suppression coefﬁcient
will increase B times when adopting pulse compression technology because the
matching ﬁlter will have ﬁltering effect on broad pulse [9]:
B ¼

In this formula, ss refers to the width of the pulse signal at the input end of the
receiver; ssc is the width of the pulse signal after pulse compression; and Ko is a
coefﬁcient which results in changes in rectangular parameter when the width of
radar transmitting pulse is widened.

Case Study
In joint operations of the RJE and the ADR, the commander should analyze pos-
sible frequency conﬂict according to the performance parameters of the RJE and the
ADR. Take a certain type of RJE and short-range surface-to-air missile guidance
radar as an example. The RJE completely covers the frequency range of the
guidance radar. Guidance radar parameters are Pt ¼ 10 kw and Dfr ¼ 3 MHz. For
r ¼ 1 m2, the farthest valid distance to the target is 25 km. The pulse width can be
reduced from 6 to 0.3 ls by adopting pulse compression technology. The main lobe
gain is 37 dB. When the side lobe is interfered, the side lobe gain of the guidance
radar will be −10 dB. The parameters of the RJE are set to Pj ¼ 1000 kw; the noise
interference bandwidth is Dfj ¼ 1000 MHz; the main lobe gain of the RJE is 14 dB;
and the side lobe gain is set to −6 dB. The interference suppression coefﬁcient is set
to 3 dB. The relative positions of the RJE and the radar can be divided into four
situations: the main lobe of the RJE to the main lobe of the radar, the main lobe of
the RJE to side lobe of the radar, the side lobe of the RJE to the side lobe of the
radar and the side lobe of the RJE to the main lobe of the radar. When the 1 m2
targets are 25 km from the guidance radar and when the spacing of the RJE and the
radar is between 100 and 10000 m, the results of bit error ratio are shown in Fig. 1.
The results show that when relative positions between the RJE and the radar are
the main lobe of the RJE to the main lobe of the radar and the side lobe of the RJE
to the main lobe of the radar, the RJE will have great impact on radar, making radar
lose its ability to work. In these situations, the spacing between the RJE and the
396
K. Li et al.

radar is meaningless in real combat. When deciding other joint operational meth-
ods, commanders need to take frequency domain and time domain into consider-
ation. When relative positions between the RJE and the radar is the main lobe of the
RJE to the side lobe of the radar and the distance between them is above 7500 m,
the interference from the RJE will be very small. When relative position between
the RJE and the radar is the side lobe of the RJE to the side lobe of the radar and the
distance between them is above 750 m, the interference from the RJE is very small.
Therefore, as the distance decreases, the impact from the RJE increases rapidly.
Therefore, in joint air defense operations, commanders should avoid some sit-
uations such as the main lobe of the RJE to the main lobe of the radar, the main lobe
of the RJE to the side lobe of the radar and the side lobe of the RJE to the main lobe
of the radar. In other words, the main lobe of the RJE’s antenna cannot point to the
radar and the main lobe of radar’s antenna cannot point to the RJE. However, in real
battle, it is impossible to avoid the above situations because the antenna of the radar
or the RJE will do circular searches. But the interference time is short, the scope is
limited, and the interference angle is conﬁned within the scope of both the RJE and
the radar’s main lobe. Commanders can use other coordinated method such as
frequency domain method and time domain method as a supplement to reduce those
impacts. Under normal circumstances, the side lobe of the RJE and the side lobe of
the radar point to each other. In this situation, according to the speciﬁc technical
performance of these equipments, commanders need to keep the distance between
the RJE and the radar above the required level to guarantee their electromagnetic
compatibility.

Conclusion
Frequency domain, time domain and the space domain are indispensable factors
when it comes to the joint operations of the RJE and the ADR. They relate to each
other closely. Operators shall never use any one of those three methods alone.
Instead, they should use one of them as the main method and take the other two as
auxiliary methods. Only in this way, the joint operations of air defense force and
electronic countermeasure force can be better achieved, and a high degree of
integration of electronic air defense and ﬁrepower air defense can be realized.

Abstract To solve the existing human memory test tools’ problems that the test
subjects is not comprehensive enough and the test scheme is not ﬂexible enough,
and meet the memory data collection needs of different personnel selection, an
integrated test system for human memory is proposed from the system overall
structure, function module implementation path, and the option of development
platform. The test subjects of this system include words short-term memory, digital
short-term memory, image short-term memory, orientation short-term memory and
working memory. The test system proposed in this paper considers synthetically the
characteristic that the memory data collection needs of different personnel selection
is different, provides the custom function of the test scheme and the score calcu-
lation, is able to meet the memory data collection needs of different personnel
selection, and has the characteristics of versatility and universality.

Introduction
As a basic psychological process, memory plays an important role in guaranteeing
human’s normal work and life. According to the length of information retention,
memory includes three types: instantaneous memory, short-term memory and
long-term memory [1]. Research ﬁnds that the short-term memory span is related to
many complex cognitive activities, and can predict the performance of complex
cognitive tasks. Therefore, short-term memory has attracted much attention forming
a lot of research productions that are widely used in selection, recruitment, as well
as education and clinical diagnosis [2–4]. In 1974, Baddeley and Hitch, two British
psychologists, proposed the concept of “working memory” on the basis of the
experiment of simulating short-term memory impairment [5]. Many studies have

shown that working memory span can better predict the performance of complex
cognitive tasks than short-term memory span.
In the test of short-term memory span and working memory span, the traditional
methods used “human to human dialogue” of “experimenter-testee” with memory
scale that one of the most famous is the Wechsler Memory scale [6]. Because there
are many shortages of manual mode such as large subjectivity, non-standardization
and large labor intensity, a large number of specialized memory test equipments and
computer-aided test systems have been constantly emerging [3, 4]. However, most
of the equipments or software systems conduct the research focusing on one certain
side of short-term memory or working memory, and the comprehensive test
equipments or systems are relatively rare. The traditional test tools make incon-
venience for the different occupation users. Therefore, it is of practical signiﬁcance
to develop a relatively complete universal memory test system. In view of the
deﬁciency of the existing memory test tools, this paper proposed a relatively
complete memory integrated test software system programme in order to meet the
needs of different professional users.

Overall Structure of Memory Test System
The test system consists of three modules: test, training and background manage-
ment. Among these, the test and training module consists of ﬁve functional
sub-modules: words memory, digital memory, image memory, orientation memory
and working memory. Background management consists of three functional
sub-modules: personnel information management, performance analysis, data base
management. The system overall structure is shown in Fig. 1.

Implementation Path of Function Module
3.1
Digital Memory Sub-module
There are a series of numbers showing on the screen randomly (it shows one
number each time for 0.5 s, and the interval between two number is 1 s). After the
present, testee is asked to key in the numbers on the designated area of screen in
accordance with the original number order. The test starts with the length of the
number 2, every length of number has three times to try to key in. When three times
all failed, the test is over. The longest number series length is 12. After the test, the
system calculates the scores of the testee.

corresponding input box in accordance with the original words right order. The test
starts with the length of the two words series, every length of words series has three
times to try to key in. When three times all failed, the test is over. The longest words
series length is 12. After the test, the system calculates the scores of the testee.
3.3
Orientation Memory Sub-module
There are nine (three in row and three in line) squares on the computer screen,
representing nine orientations: East, South, West, North, Centre, Northeast,
Southeast, Southwest, and Northwest. Some square ﬂashes 0.5 s indicating some
orientation. After the different squares ﬂash constantly and randomly, the testee is
asked to tunk the 3  3 numeric keyboard in the same position of the key. The
number of consecutive ﬂashes is the number of orientation changing which is from
2 orientations to 9 orientations so that the breadth of orientation memory can
gradually improve. The test starts with the length of two orientations, each orien-
tation has three times. When three times on one orientation all failed, the test is
over. After the test, the system calculates the scores of the testee.
3.4
Image Memory Sub-module
There are a series of images showing on the screen (it shows one image each time
for 0.5 s, and the interval between two images is 1 s). After the present, the image
series are shown in a row in accordance with the random order on the center of
screen completely and there’s an input box below every image. The testee is asked
to key in the numbers of images into the corresponding input box in accordance
with the original and right images order. The test starts with the length of the two
image series, every length of image series has three times. When three times all
failed, the test is over. The longest images series length is 12. After the test, the
system calculates the scores of the testee.
3.5
Working Memory Sub-module
There are a simple arithmetic problem (two positive integers add or subtract, and
the answer is one positive integer, for instance, 5 + 3, 7 −2, etc.) and a box with
black spots in the 3  3 grid showing on the computer screen. The testee is asked
to key in the answer, meanwhile, he need remember the position where the black
spots are in the grid. After answering, the testee need press the Enter key, then the
arithmetic problem and the grid with black spot disappear, and there will be next
arithmetic problem and grid with black spot on the screen. The interval between the
402
H. Gu et al.

arithmetic problem and the grid with black spot showing on the screen and the
testee pressing the Enter key is 5 s. If the time is out, it will shows the next
arithmetic problem and grid with black spot. During the whole test, half of the
arithmetic problems are the additive formula, the other half are subtraction. When
each group of test ﬁnishes, there is a 3  3 grid on the screen, and the testee is
asked to click out the position where the black spot appeared just now with mouse
in the blank grid (the testee can click out the position without their original order,
and the black spots’ positions will not repeat in a group of arithmetic problems).
The test start with two arithmetic problems (the degree of difﬁculty is Level 2)
(Fig. 2), then the degree of difﬁculty increases gradually until the testee has made
two mistakes in a certain degree of difﬁculty. The highest level is Level 7. After the
test, the system calculates the scores of the testee.
3.6
Background Management Module
Background management module consists of three sub-modules: personnel infor-
mation
management,
performance
analysis,
data
base
management.
The
sub-module of personnel information management enables the addition, modiﬁca-
tion, and deletion functions for personnel information of those who participate in
the test. The sub-module of performance analysis enables the functions of the basic

analysis for the test performance and showing the test results. And it has the
function to export the test scores as Excel, which can lay the data foundation to the
further analysis. The sub-module of data base management enables the functions of
modifying the test items as well as adding and deleting the stimulus materials. For
purpose of image data storage, the system adopts the method of converting the
image into binary data stream writing into the data base so that the bearing capacity
of data base decreases and the operating efﬁciency of software increases.

Development Platform
VS2010, an integrated development environment launched by Microsoft Corp, is
currently the most popular integrated development environment for Windows
platform application, adopting the way of click-and-drag to complete the interface
design and supporting C#, C++, VB. It is suitable for medium and small software
development and has the characteristics of easy to learn and package. The Microsoft
Ofﬁce Access database is a relational database management system issued by the
Microsoft Corp with the simple structure as well as the good compatibility and
permeability as VS2010, which has accelerated the development efﬁciency of
software thus ensuring the system’s progressiveness and scalability. Therefore, this
paper chooses VS2010 as the programming tool to realize the software program of
human memory test system.

Risk Identiﬁcation of Motorized
Marching’s Vehicle Safety
Leiming Yao, Chang Mei, Lili Wang, Weifei Wu and Zhenguo Mei
Abstract Vehicle safety guarantees the success of military motorized marching,
and it also contributes a lot to military training practice and combat power gener-
ation. In the recent years, since the power of armies is gradually strengthened and
competitive training is extensively adopted, motorized marching in armies is seen
more and more frequently, and we face increasing risks in the vehicle safety of
military motorized marching. Carrying out risk identiﬁcation and strengthening risk
management are quite signiﬁcant. Based on the risk management theory and the
characteristics of motorized marching’s vehicle safety, this thesis starts from the
basic risk factors and focuses on the work ﬂow and speciﬁc implementation of risk
identiﬁcation, so as to provide guidelines and practices for armies.

Motorized marching is an important way to deliver troops. It plays an important role
in ﬁeld training competitive maneuvre and other major activities. Vehicle is the
important carrier in motorized marching. Vehicle safety determines whether
marching tasks can be successfully completed and whether military activities can be
carried out on time [1]. Therefore, it is very signiﬁcant to strengthen the risk

identiﬁcation research in motorized marching’s vehicle safety and to scientiﬁcally
investigate the risk factors. In this way we can further provide basis for risk
assessment and management and guarantee the success of both marching and
training.
1
Risk Factors
According to the basic characteristics of risk and the occurrence law of vehicle
safety accidents, the basic risk factors of motorized marching’s vehicle safety are
mainly as follows.
1.1
Personnel Factor
The personnel risk in motorized marching mainly refers to the risk caused by
vehicle driver, cadres on the vehicle and passengers. In this factor, driver’s unsafe
operation accounts for a large proportion. People in the trafﬁc environment and
other drivers are also important aspects. Personnel factor is mainly affected by a
person’s age, driving age, thoughts, body, personal habits, education, driving skills,
knowledge of trafﬁc rules, sense of responsibility, safety awareness, knowledge of
laws, etc.
1.2
Vehicle Factor
Vehicle risk mainly refers to the risk caused by military motor vehicles, tractors,
equipment vehicles and other equipment. This factor is mainly affected by vehicle’s
model, service life, condition, active safety and passive safety. Active safety
includes vehicle’s power, braking, handling stability and tire performance; passive
safety includes vehicle’s safety body design, ﬁre safety measures, member restraints
and other security settings. In addition, the over-height, over-length and overweight
of some vehicles cannot be ignored [2].
1.3
Road Environment Factor
Road environment risk mainly refers to the risk caused by road condition, natural
conditions and other driving environment. Road condition is mainly affected by
408
L. Yao et al.

road’s nature, width, steepness, curvature and other personnel activities (such as
illegal road operations, stall selling, sitting in the shade on the road, drying grain,
etc.); natural condition is mainly affected by adverse climatic conditions (snow,
wind, fog, sun, etc.) and natural disasters (landslide, tsunami, debris ﬂow, typhoon,
volcano, etc.); other driving environment mainly refers to the condition of local
vehicles and trafﬁc, such as overloading and speeding.
1.4
Organization and Management Factor
Organization and management risk mainly refers to the risk caused by driver
management, vehicle management and marching organization. Driver management
includes driver selection, technical training, safety education, driving discipline and
security awareness; vehicle management includes vehicle maintenance, use of
vehicle, operation management, safety inspection and service life management;
marching organization includes marching program design, route selection, sorting,
adjusting post-arrangement, rest planning and safety inspection.
2
The Steps of Risk Identiﬁcation
Risk identiﬁcation is constituted by a series of activities and can be divided into ﬁve
steps.
2.1
Determining the Object of Identiﬁcation
Determining the object of identiﬁcation is the ﬁrst step. Based on the marching
program, related task arrangement and the occurrence law of risks, we can deter-
mine the units, vehicles and people involved. Then we analyze the distribution of
risk factors and ﬁnd the key point in risk identiﬁcation.
2.2
Collecting Data
Collecting data is a necessary process for risk identiﬁcation. In order to better
identify the risks, we need to master the related data of military motorized
marching. First we need to pay attention to the parts where risks used to lie in, the
Risk Identiﬁcation of Motorized Marching’s Vehicle Safety
409

time, every steps of the marching, the occurrence law of accidents and managing
experience. Second we mind the task arrangements and possible road environment.
2.3
Choosing a Method of Identiﬁcation
An
appropriate
identiﬁcation
method
can
ensure
the
result
is
scientiﬁc.
Identiﬁcation methods that are commonly used include checklist method, ﬂowchart
method, ﬁeld survey method and expert method. Checklist method requires us to
make a risk checklist according to the characteristics of risks and check the risks on
the list one-by-one. Flowchart method requires us to draw the task ﬂowchart and
interpret the risks according to the chart. Field investigation method means to make
ﬁeld check for the risk condition. Expert method means to invite experienced and
professional experts in the related ﬁelds to meet and discuss, and then analyze the
risks. Different types of risks need different methods, we need to grab the char-
acteristics of the risks in motorized marching, make sure the method is simple,
practical and easy to operate, and comprehensively use these methods [3].
2.4
Making in-Depth Investigation and Analysis
In-depth investigation and analysis is the key to derive risk identiﬁcation results. It
is necessary to carry out detailed inspection on relevant people, vehicles and
marching plans. We need to conduct comprehensive investigation and analysis on
safety problems that are likely to cause risks and check the existence, occurrence
and extension data of different risks in time. In this way we can provide sufﬁcient
data support for the ﬁnal result.
2.5
Getting the Result
The result of the study is the ﬁnal part of risk identiﬁcation. Data got from survey
and analysis are sometimes too general, not precise enough, and have few focuses.
This requires further research and conﬁrmation. We can invite experts in related
ﬁelds, professional and technical personnel and backbone ofﬁcers to participate in
this step, having brainstorming, in-depth discussion, analysis and estimation to
conﬁrm the ﬁnal result.

The Implementation of Risk Identiﬁcation
The implementation of risk identiﬁcation is based on the basic process of risk
identiﬁcation, and uses various scientiﬁc risk identiﬁcation methods to analyze and
identify the risk factors of vehicle safety in military motorized marching, and ﬁnally
ﬁnd out the potential risk [4]. We will combine the real condition of the motorized
marching in an air defense force (Army A) to identify the single and multifactor
risks.
3.1
Identifying the Single-Factor Risks
Single-factor risks refer to the static risks that the risk points are relatively simple
and stable. If factors like people, vehicles, environment, organization and man-
agement are separate, then they all belong to single-factor risks. For this type of
risks we can use checklist method to identify them. We make a risk checklist
according to the possible risk points and identify the risks through survey, ques-
tionnaire analysis and expert meeting. The results are shown in Table 1.
Single-factor risk identiﬁcation for motorized marching’s vehicle safety is in fact
a careful security check for relevant preparations. The identiﬁcation process serves
also as the safety education for ofﬁcers and soldiers, and as the rectiﬁcation of risk
problems. Single-factor risk identiﬁcation must be comprehensive. Since the
workload is heavy, we need the support of organizations at all levels and the
participation of ofﬁcers and soldiers. At the same time they are required to provide
objective and accurate data [5].
3.2
Identifying the Multi-factor Risks
Multifactor risks refer to the risks caused by the combination of two or more risk
factors, and they are instable and dynamic. For these risks, we can adopt ﬂowchart
method to identify them. After analyzing what accidents may happen, what the
consequences are, what impacts we will see, what causes lead to these accidents, we
can ﬁnally identify the risks. The results are shown in Table 2.
We can see from Table 2 that multifactor risk identiﬁcation is related to many
uncertain factors. In the process of identiﬁcation, we need to not only use the
extensive historical data, but also ﬂexibly combine ﬂowchart method, expert
method and survey method to deeply analyze these factors.

A Collision Warning Device Based
on the Emergency Braking
Behavior Prediction
Shaobin Wu, Wenhao Wang, Zhiwei Li and Li Gao
Abstract Rear-end collisions are the most common type of car accidents. In this
paper, the anti-rear-end collision warning device based on emergency braking
behavior prediction was designed to reduce the occurrence of rear-end collision.
Through analyzing drivers’ braking behaviors in the car-following process, the
anti-rear-end collision method based on emergency braking behavior prediction was
proposed. The emergency braking model was established based on the change rate
of acceleration pedal’s and clutch pedal’s displacement. The anti-rear-end collision
warning device consisting of the sensors on the pedals, capture card, IPC and
emergency brake lamps was developed. The rear-end collision warning device was
tested on the roads. The road test results show that the emergency brake lamps are
lighted in advance about 0.1–0.3 s compared with the conventional brake lamps
and warn the drivers to brake earlier. The device could reduce the incidence of
rear-end collisions effectively and improve road safety.

Introduction
Trafﬁc accidents have become a global harm. About 1.24 million people were killed
on the world’s roads in 2010 [1]. It is expected that road trafﬁc deaths will increase
to 240 million in 2030, which will become the ﬁfth leading cause of death unless
urgent actions are taken. There are many factors inﬂuencing road trafﬁc safety;
among them, the reaction time and processing of the emergency situation are two of
the important factors [2, 3]. The statistics data show that rear-end crashes account
for approximately 33.4% of all highway accidents in China and 40% of economic
losses.

Anti-rear-end collision systems are divided into two types: active collision
avoidance and passive collision avoidance. Active collision avoidance system needs
sensors to measure the distance between leading vehicle and following vehicle,
which are relatively expensive [4]. Passive collision avoidance system includes
conventional brake lamps and new type brake lamps based on the switch control of
the acceleration pedal [5, 6]. The drivers take appropriate measures to avoid
rear-end crashes after seeing the front brake lamps lighting. The new type brake
lamps are controlled according to whether the driver steps on the acceleration pedal.
If the driver does not step on the acceleration pedal, the new type brake lamps will
light. In this paper, an anti-rear-end collision warning device based on emergency
braking behavior prediction was designed to predict emergency brake intentions in
advance and could prevent or reduce the occurrence of rear-end collisions.

Braking Process Analysis
In the car-following process, the emergency braking process of the adjacent vehi-
cles is shown in Fig. 1. Emergency braking process could be divided into four
stages: driver’s response action to the onset of brake lamp, braking action, con-
tinuous braking and braking release [7].

According to the analysis of braking process, after the following car driver sees
the emergency braking of the front vehicle, the moving distance in the free running
stage S1 is as follows:

The braking distance in braking action stage S2 is as follows:

where t1 is driver’s response time, a1 is maximum brake deceleration, V0 is initial
braking speed, t2 is build-up time of braking force. Equation (4) shows that four
main factors determine the braking distance and affect the occurrence of rear-end
collision, namely driver’s response time t1, braking action time t2, maximum brake
deceleration a1 and initial braking speed V0. Maximum brake deceleration, initial
speed and braking action time are related to vehicle performance, but it will not be
considered temporarily in this paper.
The driver’s response time t1, namely brake lag time, includes the time of
identiﬁcation, response, decision judging and shifting the feet after the driver
realizes the emergency situation(usually 0.3–1.0 s). After the brake lag time, the
vehicle starts braking process and the brake lamp is lighted to remind the following
vehicle driver to take appropriate measures at the same time. If the two vehicles are
too close, rear-end collision accident is possible to happen.
Therefore, if the driver’s emergency brake intention can be predicted, and the
brake lamp will be lighted in advance, and then the time that the following vehicle
driver sees lamps lighting will also advance, then time difference between the
braking behavior of the two vehicles will reduce. So the vehicles can still keep a
certain distance even in emergency braking condition, and ﬁnally, rear-end collision
accident is prevented effectively.

2.2
Emergency Brake Model
The data on emergency braking, conventional braking and accelerating shifting
behaviors on roads were collected including the displacement of acceleration pedal,
brake pedal and clutch pedal etc. The change rate of acceleration pedal displace-
ment of emergency braking and accelerating shifting behaviors was much larger
than that of conventional braking behavior, and both acceleration pedal and clutch
pedal were engaged for accelerating shifting behavior, while clutch pedal was
seldom engaged for emergency braking behavior (Fig. 2); thus, emergency braking
behavior could be predicted by the change rate of acceleration pedal displacement
and the displacement of clutch pedal.
Table 1 shows the displacement rate of acceleration pedal on emergency braking
and conventional braking processes. For different initial acceleration pedal opening,
the mean rate is 6.597 and 0.61 V/s for emergency and conventional braking
processes. Although the change rate of acceleration pedal will rise to mean value of
7.462 V/s on acceleration shifting process, the displacement of clutch pedal will
remain unchanged. The emergency brake model was introduced by the sequence of
change rate of the pedals’ displacement as follows:
K1  6:5 V=s:
ð5Þ
DK2  0:15 V=s
ð6Þ
where K1 is the change rate of the acceleration pedal’s displacement, DK2 is the
change rate of the clutch pedal’s displacement. For the vehicle with manual
transmission, if Eqs. (5) and (6) are satisﬁed at the same time, the emergency
braking behavior can be predicted. For the vehicle with automatic transmission, the
emergency braking behavior can be predicted if Eq. (5) is satisﬁed.

Design
3.1
Working Principle
According to the emergency braking behavior prediction model, the driver’s
emergency braking intention could be predicted by the change rate of the dis-
placement of accelerator pedal, brake pedal and the clutch pedal (Fig. 3). Only
when the change rate of the displacement of accelerator pedal exceeds a certain
threshold and the displacement of the clutch pedal does not change, the emergency
braking behavior will be predicted to conduct and the emergency brake lamps will
be lighted. If the emergency braking behavior prediction is wrong, emergency brake
lamps will be put out after lighting for 1 s.
3.2
Hardware
The collision warning device consisted of driving behavior sensors, industrial
personal computer (IPC), PCI1711 data acquisition (DAS) card and emergency
brake lamps (as shown in Fig. 4). IPC was chosen as the central control unit.
Driving behavior sensors included the sensors on the acceleration pedal, brake
pedal and clutch pedal, which were used to measure the displacement of the
acceleration pedal, brake pedal and clutch pedal. Emergency brake lamps were
activated by DC 12 V.
3.3
Design of Software
The software of the device was designed with Visual Basic. In consideration of the
programming and the maintenance, the whole program was written by the modu-
larization mode, including A/D transformation capture module, emergency braking
calculate module and D/A control output module. The A/D transformation capture

Braking calculate module was used to analyze the rate of the change of displacement
data. The D/A control output module was used to control the emergency brake lamp.

Test
The rear-end collision warning device was tested on roads. The data of emergency
braking, conventional braking and acceleration shifting behaviors and the status of
brake lamps were collected. Results show that the rear-end collision warning device
can accurately distinguish acceleration shifting, conventional braking and emer-
gency braking behaviors, and the emergency brake lamps were lighted in advance
about 162.5 ms to compare with the conventional brake lamp (Fig. 5).

Conclusion
In this paper, through the analysis of emergency braking process, the method of
anti-rear-end collision based on the emergency braking intention prediction was
proposed, and the emergency braking model considering the change rate of accel-
erator pedal displacement and clutch pedal displacement was developed. The rear-end
collision warning device consisting of driving control sensors, capture card, IPC and
emergency brake lamps was developed. The road tests veriﬁed that the effectiveness
of the anti-rear-end collision method and emergency braking model, and the rear-end
collision warning device can predict driver’s emergency brake intentions and light the
brake lamps about 0.1–0.3 s in advance, thus reduces the incidence of rear-end
collisions effectively and improve the road safety.

Abstract Followed by the continuous growing of computer technology and
computer network technology, the data formation and management were used the
previously complicated method. But the data management had a common issue,
which became completely relied on computer network technology. Additionally,
because of the signiﬁcant speciﬁcity of military data, the security of data man-
agement became a main issue that needs to be solved. Therefore, more study carried
out on the security management of military data systems may provide signiﬁcant
practical understanding and direction on manipulating and managing the military
electronic ﬁle data systems securely and accurately. This paper covered all the
disadvantages and security risks of controlling the military ﬁle data system via
computer network technology currently. Moreover, the paper focused on the
practical application of the information security encryption technology in managing
the military ﬁle data. This paper may provide a further step on protecting the
security of military data and promoting progress of computer scientiﬁc knowledge.

System and Characteristics of Electronic File
1.1
Defects of Military File Information Management
System
Military ﬁle information management system, by computer technology and com-
munication technology, through the computer network is used for classiﬁcation,
entry and management of ﬁle information. All the ﬁle information is in the form of
electronic documents in the network system; electronic document is a kind of
electronic ﬁle sorted and converted from paper ﬁle in a certain way, while electronic
document is recorded tape, disk, CD and other carriers in the form of coding and
can be accessed in the computer network system and transmitted on the commu-
nication network information. The transmission path of the electronic ﬁle infor-
mation is uncertain, and there are many transmission paths from one computer to
another. The information, from the sending node to the destination node, is going
through a number of nodes. This information transmission mode cannot guarantee
the security and conﬁdentiality of archival information in the transmission among
nodes. Additionally, hackers and viruses are present everywhere and it will attack
into the computer with weak defense system and result in lacking security.
1.2
Basic Characteristics of Electronic File
1. Big storage capacity and extensive records
A small DVD disk has storage capacity of up to 10G. In daily business, user can
use the computer ofﬁce software Word or Excel and other formats to form a text
ﬁle or spreadsheet or other electronic ﬁle stored in the computer or make a
document in the form of video, photographs and others saved on the CD.
2. Easily saving and accessibility at any time
The required documents in the business are available and checkable at any time,
and user can also use the computer to export the data and burn the document
into a CD.
3. Important ﬁle’s retention period is not subject to time limit
With the extensive use of paperless ofﬁce systems, the use of electronic ﬁles and
documents through the computer network becomes more convenient and

practical. Once the ﬁle is lost, you may query through electronic documents and
electronic ﬁles, without time limit.

Security Threats Faced by Military Electronic File
Information Management
The military electronic ﬁle is created in the electronic document management
system, and the information content it records can be separated from the carrier and
dependent on the document (e.g., application of database technology). The contents
of the electronic ﬁle information can easily be copied, deleted and stolen, and
tampering and stealing will not leave traces [2]. In addition, the information in the
electronic ﬁle during the computer network transmission process may be illegal
tampered or intercepted [3]. This poses a signiﬁcant threat to the management of
electronic ﬁle information, and such threat can be divided into internal leak and
external leak.
2.1
Internal Leak
Internal leak is divided into unintentional leak and intentional leak. Unintentional
leak means that insiders will disclose conﬁdential electronic documents in their own
circumstances, and the most common cases include the internal computer and the
Internet illegal outreach, and installation of software unauthorized by the security
department and cross-use of mobile storage media. In such cases, hackers have the
opportunity to intercept the ﬁle, restore secret ﬁle and thus steal conﬁdential content
and information of electronic ﬁle.
Intentional leak refers that internal staff through a variety of ways obtains secret
electronic documents and takes the initiative to pass out. For example, they may
directly copy secret ﬁle to the U disk, CD and other media or disclose to others by
downloading through the network, screenshots, pictures, etc.
2.2
Leak to External Environment
The network attack is the major form of the external leak including network hacker
and malicious code.

Application of Information Security and Conﬁdentiality
Technology in Military File Management
3.1
Create a File Information Generation Control System
The ﬁle information generation control system is the technology of application of
data encryption, identity authentication, digital signature, information hiding and
ﬁrewall; database security management technology, information leak prevention
technology and anti-credit technology can ensure that the contents of the ﬁle
information are of authenticity, authenticity and security. Information encryption
technology is to protect the network of data and ﬁle password in the transmission
process effectively; in other words, it helps convert the common text into a
ciphertext before the use of information encryption algorithm and encryption key
and then encapsulate the ciphertext data into data packet for transmission on the
network so that the receiver can decrypt the algorithm and decryption key to restore
the ciphertext into the original data. The encrypted data in the transmission process
are safe and reliable to ensure that the information system cannot be tampered or
stolen. If there is no decryption key, even if a ﬁle is copied, the stealer will see
messy codes.
Information authentication is the effective identiﬁcation of electronic documents
received digital signature through the identiﬁcation to ensure the integrity and
authenticity of electronic ﬁles.
At the same time, user can also install a network security ﬁlter to block those
malicious programs and information in the system, improve the security of trans-
mission and enhance the level of network operation and management.
3.2
Establish File Information Security Testing and Audit
System
The user shall establish a adaptive security defense system for complete ﬁle gen-
eration, transfer, collection, collation and storage, use system security detection
technology for the operation log, damage prevention technology for the operation
system and the effective backup technology and disaster recovery technology for
system information. In the ﬁle information management system, user shall conduct
multiple protection for the ﬁle resource database ﬁle and data, install anti-virus
software and anti-Trojan program, update the latest patch to reduce bugs and repair
the bugs in timely to prevent the loss and deletion of electronic ﬁle information.
At the same time, user shall strengthen the internal network audit, take the means
of network audit in accordance with regulatory requirements, conduct real-time
monitor and audit for the operation of electronic ﬁle and timely block and alarm for
a variety of illegal operations in time.
426

3.3
Establish a File Information Use Control System
User shall use “File information use control system” to control user rights. In the
server, the administrator can set the management strategy and the readable, writable
and operable permissions of the U disk and CD, and dynamically adjust the security
level of the protected object. In the client, the user can encrypt the ﬁle through a key
encryption function or enter into client’s advanced encryption interface to set the
ﬁle modiﬁcation, copy, print and other permissions and ﬂexibly adjust the life cycle
of the ﬁle level of conﬁdentiality.
3.4
Establish a File Information Security Evaluation System
Electronic ﬁles are usually stored in the dedicated data hard drive, and the computer
itself can ensure the physical storage of data security only if it has achieved a
certain security requirement. The data on the computer are vulnerable to external
attacks, and illegal user can log the internet network through the ﬁre to copy and
modify the relevant data, resulting in data leakage, damage and tampering. In such
cases, software security cannot be under real-time monitoring and management;
therefore, user must establish a ﬁle security assessment system [4, 5].
The ﬁle information security evaluation system includes evaluations on physical
security, software security and data security. The purpose is to prevent the elec-
tronic ﬁle in the data host transmission process from being attacked or blocked so as
to effectively solve the information channel congestion, while preventing the
occurrence of fraud and other issues for tampering of IP address and improving the
security level of the system user.
3.5
Establish a File Information Management Software
Upgrade System
In the military ﬁle information management, the software upgrade has gradually
become a key link. Electronic ﬁle management software upgrade is subject to two
basic requirements. The ﬁrst is certain compatibility to make the management
software of the electronic ﬁle compatible with its equipment and operating platform
of each system and usable. The second is certain degree of unity. After software
upgrade, it shall have a relatively complete electronic ﬁle information security
management system, and among different regions and different units, the system
shall prevent differences in information security management of the electronic ﬁles
so as to achieve the sharing of all electronic documents in the electronic ﬁle.

Conclusions
To sum up, the security and authenticity of information management of military
electronic ﬁles are directly related to the healthy development of military ﬁles. As
the information security of electronic ﬁle is restricted by various factors such as
network environment, physical conditions, management system and security tech-
nology, during the process of military electronic ﬁle information management, we
will strengthen the management of military ﬁle information security and establish a
perfect network security prevention system and promote the software upgrade of
electronic ﬁles. This should be an effective measure and means to ensure the
security of military electronic ﬁle information.

An ECG-Derived Respiration Method
Based on Signal Reconstruction of R, S
Amplitudes and Filtering
Yue Gao, Hong Yan, Zhi Xu, Lin Zhang and Meng Xiao
Abstract An ECG-derived respiration (EDR) algorithm based on signal recon-
struction and ﬁltering is presented and applied to derive the respiratory signals from
single-lead ECG. The ECG features, R-peak amplitude, S-peak amplitude, and
R-peak position are used to reconstruct the signal by cubic spline interpolation.
The EDR signal is obtained by applying a Kaiser ﬁlter to the reconstructed signal at
last. The method is evaluated on data from the MIT-BIH polysomnographic data-
base and validated against a “gold-standard” respiratory obtained from simultane-
ously recorded respiration data. Correlation coefﬁcient (C) and magnitude-squared
coherence coefﬁcient (MSC) are used to assess the performance of the methods.
The statistical difference is signiﬁcant among the method presented in this study
and the EDR methods based on wavelet and empirical mode decomposition (EMD),
proving that the algorithm introduced in this article outperforms the others in the
extraction of respiratory signals from single-lead ECGs.

Introduction
Respiration signal is an important physiological signal, it plays an important role
in
diagnosis and treatment of many
diseases.
The traditional
respiratory
signal-recording methods are unmanageable in certain applications such as stress
testing, ambulatory monitoring, and sleep studies due to the use of some cumber-
some devices that may interfere with natural breath [1]. Compared with the tradi-
tional methods, the EDR (ECG-derived respiration) method extracts the respiratory

wave through ECG, and the ECG signal has the advantages of being convenient in
collection and having little interference to normal respiration, etc. Thus, the EDR
method is very much applicable for home monitoring and ambulatory monitoring.
As an advanced human body measurement technology, the EDR method has a wide
application prospect in the man–machine–environment system engineering ﬁeld.
The theories of the EDR method are as follows: (1) The motion of the electrodes
relative to the heart during the respiratory cycle. (2) The thoracic impedance
variations caused by the volume changes in the lungs. (3) Respiratory sinus
arrhythmia (RSA). The heart rate increases in inspiration and decreases in expira-
tion [1].
Due to these factors, many scholars proposed a series of EDR algorithms. The
ﬁrst EDR algorithm based on morphology variation information is proposed by
Wang et al. [5]; they used the vectorcardiogram (VCG) to detect the respiratory rate
and respiratory depth. Then many EDR algorithms based on the amplitude of the
ECG features were proposed, including the methods for restoring the respiratory
wave based on R wave peak amplitudes, RS amplitudes, QRS area [3], etc. Some
scholars used RSA to get the EDR signal by combining with the methods of
S-transform [4], etc. It is commonly believed that the EDR method based on ECG
ﬁlter is the simplest way to get the respiratory wave through ECG. Yi et al. [6]
extracted the ingredients of which the frequency was between 0.2 and 0.4 Hz in
ECG by wavelet, and took them as the respiratory wave. The EDR signal obtained
by this method had extremely high similarity with the actual respiratory wave
through experiments. However, because of the complexity of the ECG, the ingre-
dients of 0.2–0.4 Hz obtained by wavelet may also contain the other ingredients
besides the respiratory signals, which causes big errors between the EDR signal and
the actual respiratory wave. To overcome the above defect and get the EDR signal
which is more similar to the actual respiratory wave, this paper proposed an EDR
method based on signal reconstruction of R and S amplitudes and ﬁlter.

Method
2.1
Database
The MIT-BIH Polysomnographic Database includes 18 continuous records which
come from 16 male subjects who suffer from sleep apnea. The records are digitized
at 250 Hz with 12-bit resolution and continue between 2 and 7 h. Because the 16
subjects all have the sleep apnea diseases of different degrees, there are abnormal
data caused by apnea and respiratory disorder in parts of the ECG and respiratory
wave. In these data, the relationship between ECG and the respiratory wave is not
clear, and thus, the EDR algorithm is not applicable. Therefore, this article took
advantage of the data without apnea or respiratory disorder all of records for
algorithm comparison.

2.2
EDR Methods
As mentioned above, the ECG signals were inﬂuenced by the respiration, and the
inﬂuences on the R wave and S wave were the most signiﬁcant. Thus, this paper
chooses the information of the R and S wave amplitudes and the R wave peak
position as the basis for signal reconstruction, and then uses the Kaiser low-pass
ﬁlter for ﬁltering the reconstruction signal to get the EDR signal. The detail of the
algorithm is given as follows.
2.2.1
EDR Method Proposed in this Article
(a) Data preprocessing
The method of this paper needs to use the information of the R wave peak
amplitude, S wave peak amplitude, and the transverse coordinate positions of the R
wave peak, and thus, it ﬁrstly needs to detect the features of ECG. The algorithm for
feature points detection of the paper is the ECG feature points detection algorithm
based on wavelet proposed by Yang et al. [7]. The algorithm is outstanding in time
consumption, detection precision, etc., and is very much applicable to this paper.
(b) Signal reconstruction
The R wave peak amplitude (RA), S wave peak amplitude (SA), and the transverse
coordinate of R wave peak (RP) are expressed by the following formula:

The signal sig is interpolated to 250 Hz by spline interpolation. The transverse

which is expressed as S.

For explanation, Fig. 1 shows the reconstruction signal S which is not processed
by formulas (7) and (8). The Discussion will introduce the reason why the data
processing of formulas (7) and (8) is needed in detail.
(c) Filter
At last, the EDR signal can be obtained by applying Kaiser low-pass ﬁlter to the
reconstructed signal S. Generally, it is believed the respiratory wave frequency is
0.2–0.4 Hz [6], and thus, the cutoff frequency of passband of the Kaiser low-pass
ﬁlter is set as 0.4 Hz, the stop band starting frequency is 0.6 Hz, and the passband
ﬂuctuation and the stop band attenuation are, respectively, set as 0.01 and 0.001.
The processing effect is shown as Fig. 2.
As shown in Fig. 2, the EDR signal and the reference respiratory signal are in the
anti-phase relationship of which the detailed reason is explained in the paper [8].
This anti-phase relationship does not inﬂuence the acquiring of the EDR signal and
the assessment of the algorithm effect, and thus, it is not deeply studied. However, it
shall mention that not all of the other data in the database have the anti-phase
relationship as shown in the ﬁgure.

2.2.2
EDR Methods for Comparison
The method of the paper will be compared with the EDR method based on wavelet
and the EDR method based on experience mode decomposition (EMD). The former
decomposes ECG through the wavelet and extracts the ingredients for which the
frequency is between 0.2 and 0.4 Hz [6], which are used as the respiratory wave.
The db6 mother wavelet is chosen as wavelet basis function [6].
The EDR method based on EMD does not need to choose the wavelet basis
function in advance, and thus, its application is wider than the EDR method based
on wavelet. The EDR method based on EMD proposed by Labate et al. [2] ﬁrstly
decomposes ECG into a set of intrinsic mode functions (IMF) and then visually
screens out one IMF or the sum of a plurality of IMFs which are closest to the
respiratory wave to be used as the EDR signal.
2.3
Assessment Indexes of Algorithm
The assessment indexes of EDR algorithms used by the paper are the correlation
coefﬁcients (C) and the magnitude-squared coherence (MSC). To avoid the possible
time delay, we choose the maximum absolute correlation of which the time window
is within 10s as the value of correlation coefﬁcient (C). The reason for choosing 10s
as the time window is that normal human’s lowest respiratory frequency is about
0.1 Hz [6].
MSC is the index for calculating the coherence of signal in frequency domain
and can be calculated by the following formula.
Cxyðf Þ ¼
Pxyðf Þ
j
j2
Pxxðf ÞPyyðf Þ
ð10Þ
The Pxxðf Þ and Pyyðf Þ are the power spectrum densities of the reference res-
piratory wave and the EDR signal, and Pxyðf Þ is the cross-power spectrum density.
The spectra are calculated using Welch’s method using a 1024-point fast Fourier
transform. The periodic Hamming window is used whose length was chosen to
obtain eight sections of input signal. The overlap is 50%.

Result
Figure 3 shows the comparison of the results for the same ECG among the method
proposed in this article and the other two methods. To be convenient for com-
parison, the EDR signal’s amplitudes are normalized. As shown in Fig. 3, all of the
434
Y. Gao et al.

three methods can obtain the surrogate respiratory wave, but the respiration
obtained by the method in this paper is more stable, and the appearance of the wave
is more close to the reference respiratory wave.
Table 1 shows the quantitative comparison of the three EDR methods for all
records in the database. The two-tailed t test is used to test for signiﬁcant differ-
ences. The result proves that the method proposed in this article is better than the
other two methods in the correlation coefﬁcient and magnitude-squared coherence,
and the difference is signiﬁcant. At the same time, the EDR method based on
wavelet is signiﬁcantly better than the EDR method based on EMD.

Discussion
The respiratory signal extracted by the method of the paper is signiﬁcantly better
than the other two methods not only in wave shape but also in the quantitative
comparison including correlation coefﬁcients and MSC through experiments. The
wavelet EDR method has the disadvantage that because of the complexity of the
ECG, the 0.2–0.4 Hz component extracted by the wavelet may also contain the other
information in the ECG besides the respiration information, and thus, the surrogate
respiration obtained by the method may have big errors in many details. The EDR
method based on EMD does not need to set the wavelet basis function in advance,
and thus, it can be more widely applied. However, limited by the algorithm itself, the
IMFs obtained by decomposition does not have speciﬁc frequency meaning, and at
current, we can only select one IMF or the sum of some IMFs manually to construct
the EDR. The method of the paper removes the interference of the other information
in ECG by signal reconstruction. The reconstructed signal only contains the infor-
mation of the respiration and the high-frequency information generated by inter-
polation which is similar to the modulation wave. Thus, the respiratory wave with
excellent performance can be obtained by only using ﬁlter. In addition, no manual
intervention is required for the method, and the automation is good.
As mentioned above, formulas (7) and (8) shall be used for processing the RA′
and SA′ sequences because of the following reasons: As shown in Fig. 4, in the
spectrum of the reconstructed signal S, the power of the respiration is centrally
distributed in the part of 0.2–0.5 Hz, and the part of 1–2 Hz is the high-frequency
part generated by the interpolation which is similar to the modulation wave. In the
spectrum of S after being processed by formulas (7) and (8), the low-frequency part
expressing the respiration is not changed, the power of high-frequency part is
reduced, and the ratio of the power of the respiration to the total power is increased,
which provides convenience for identifying the respiration power spectrum and
designing the ﬁlter. In addition, the EDR signals obtained before and after the
processing of formulas (7) and (8) are not varied signiﬁcantly, and thus, the pro-
cessing of this step is practical and reasonable.

Conclusion
This article proposes an EDR method based on signal reconstruction and ﬁlter,
which ﬁrstly uses the amplitudes of R and S waves and the position of the R wave
peak for signal reconstruction, and then the EDR signal is obtained by the Kaiser
low-pass ﬁlter. In the comparison with the EDR method based on wavelet and the
EDR method based on experience mode decomposition, the algorithm of the paper
restores the respiratory wave whose shape is more similar to the actual respiratory
wave. And the algorithm proposed in this article outperforms the other two methods
in the quantitative comparison. The method of the paper is very much applicable for
the home monitoring and ambulatory monitoring with the advantages of simplicity
for calculation, convenience in application, and having no use for any additional
sensor. As an advanced human body signal measurement technology, the EDR
method has a wide application in the man–machine–environment system engi-
neering ﬁeld.

Abstract The PCG Mine #8 already practice methane drainage are considered to
drain their seam gases and reduce atmospheric emissions of methane, After
studying the methane drainage system and Visualisation and analysing of mine
ventilation data.real-time monitoring of ventilation and methane drainage at the
longwall face B15-13330. Analysis have shown that gas drainage in this face
accounts for 38.3% of the total gas release and the ventilation air methane takes up
61.7%. On the other hand, ventilation air methane from the longwall face B15-
13330 represents 72.2% of methane in the whole district. Sealing and design of the
drainage wells used can improve this efﬁciency as will be discussed. The dynamic
information of mine gas geology is obtained, and how to improve this efﬁciency is
also discussed. Finally, the implementation of coal mine drainage system is
optimised.

the East and South of mine ﬁeld is an open alluvial–diluvial plain; ground elevation
generally is around +75 to +80 m. To the north of the coalﬁeld is Mapeng
Mountain and Jiaozhan Zhai Mountain mostly of amaranthine Shiqianfeng sand-
stone and Pingdingshan sandstone. Elevation is generally around +360 to +460 m.
The mine began development in 1966 and became operational in 1981; it has a
design capacity of 3 Mtpa and life of 65 years.

The main coal-bearing strata in the Pingdingshan coalﬁeld are the Lower Permian
Shanxi Formation and the Lower Shihezi Formation. The thickness of main
coal-bearing strata is about 400 m, and the average total thickness of the coal seams
is about 14.7–18 m. There are 4 minable coal seams (B16–17, B15, C9–10, and D5–6) at
#8 mine, average thickness is 11–17 m, and the dip angle is 8°–22°. Being more
gassy and outburst prone, and also based on the production schedule of the mines,
longwall districts in seams B15 and B16–17 were selected as the mining districts to
concentrate upon for the purpose of the tasks covered which underpresents a rep-
resentative stratigraphic column from two longwall districts at Mine #8 [1–4].

Performance Assessment of the Drainage
System at PCG Mines
Longwall operations at Mine #8 were carried out in order to select the pilot methane
drainage performance monitoring longwall face. Based on the data available, the
longwall face LW13330, which already had horizontal pre-drainage boreholes
installed from November 2011, was selected as the methane drainage-monitoring
face in the project. This longwall has not beneﬁtted from protection seam mining
and therefore has not been pre-drained by being overmined. The in-seam boreholes
are drilled and spaced 3 m apart, at 113 mm diameter and approximately 80–100 m
length (Figs. 1 and 2).
Figure 2 above presents the details of long-hole drainage system installed at the
Top Gallery at LW 13330. Here, the boreholes are drilled 1.5 m apart, and after
6 months of drainage the concentration of CH4 in the drained gas ranged between
11 and 16% at 1.00 m3/min. The boreholes used a standpipe length of 15 m, with
1-m foam at both ends and 10-m cement pumped between the foam. This roadway
was ventilated separately to the longwall face.

Figure 3 presents a detailed design of the LW13330 ﬂoorgate drainage operation
and its interaction with the ventilation system. When LW reaches “A,” the pipe
range is broken at “B” and both ends are sealed; then, a wall is built at “C.”
Ventilation stops ﬂowing through ventilation cut-through No. 1 and ﬂows through
cut-through No. 2, and this sequence continues along the ﬂoorgate length. As LW
approaches each 500-mm pipe, the face-side valve is opened. The measurements
have shown that the average methane concentration in the pipe is 1.5%, and the
system does not have the advantages of conventional 3-gate ventilation system.
Figure 4 presents a set of readings of average daily methane concentrations from
the mine electronic monitors at LW13330 in Mine #8 detailing methane emission
contributions to the mine ventilation air from different gate roads.

Visualisation and Analysis of Mine Ventilation Data at
PCG Mine #8
Mine ventilation system is a dynamic system composed of the main fan unit and
underground mine ventilation network. To ensure production safety and reduce
costs, this dynamic system should maintain optimal operating conditions. However,
constant evolution of the mine production layout is bound to affect the operational
state of the dynamic system, leading to situations unfavourable for production
safety and technical economics. This is a common situation in mine ventilation
system in China; therefore, optimisation and transformation of mine ventilation
system is of considerable importance [5, 6].
Based on the analysis of the ventilation systems in Mine #8, combined with the
measurement data, the visualisation system of mine ventilation and ﬁre prevention
in Mine #8 was completed. The operational interface is presented in Fig. 5, which
displays the measured ventilation parameters of the whole mine into the
three-dimensional visualisation system and enables real-time calculation and dis-
play of mine ventilation.

Real-Time Monitoring Data Display
Seamless connection with the mine monitoring system is achieved. The main
monitoring sensors have been labelled in the three-dimensional system. And then
through layered management, the system realises the layout and display manage-
ment of the sensor.
Using the mouse to click the icon of the corresponding sensor, the relevant
information is displayed. Figure 6 presents the 24-h gas sensor history of total

Gas Analysis at the Project Monitoring Longwall Face
B15-13330 and the East Air Shaft
Measurements of airﬂow and gas concentrations at longwall face B15-13330 on 6
July 2013 were 2190 m3/min and 0.24%, respectively. Therefore, the face VAM was
about 5.256 m3/min. The total return air volume in the B3 mining area extension
was 3688 m3/min, gas concentration was 0.32% and the cumulative gas emission
was 11.80 m3/min. This suggests that gas drainage volume of B3 mining area
extension accounts for 38.3% of the total volume and the VAM accounts for 61.7%,
of which 5.256 m3/min is from longwall face B15-13330, accounting for 72.2% of
the gas in the whole district. Gas emission from other regions takes up 27.8%.

The total return air volume in the East air shaft is 7656 m3/min, gas concen-
tration is 0.2% and the gas volume is 15.31 m3/min. Thus, gas in this area is mainly
from the B3 mining area extension accounting for 77.1%, the remainder coming
from the B3 mining area.

The Efﬁciency of Methane Drainage Capture System
An automated continuous methane drainage-monitoring system was installed at a
pilot longwall face at PCG mines, which monitored and transmitted performance
data from an in-seam pre-drainage system for the entire longwall extraction period.
Manual monitoring of individual in-seam boreholes was also carried out for per-
formance assessment of the drainage installations [7].
Figure 6 presents the analysis of the whole mine drainage capture efﬁciency at
Mine #8. Drainage efﬁciency at Mine #8 was in the region of 16–20% in the short
and long term. This is consistent with the observations from the project monitoring
longwall LW13330, and it is believed that better sealing and design of the drainage
wells used can improve this efﬁciency as will be discussed.

Conclusions
Field monitoring of methane drainage performance at the pilot longwall face
LW13330 at Mine #8 and the overall methane drainage capture efﬁciencies of both
Mines #8 have shown that the captured gas purity was rather low, and a typical of
most Chinese coal mines. Capture efﬁciency on an individual face basis was also
noted as being low. This is believed to be caused by less-than-effective stand-piping
and borehole sealing, as well as the in-seam pre-drainage boreholes being very
closely spaced, besides the low permeability of the PCG coal seams.
This research has conducted real-time monitoring of ventilation and methane
drainage at the longwall face B15-13330. Analysis has shown that gas drainage in
this face accounts for 38.3% of the total gas release, and the ventilation air methane
takes up 61.7%. On the other hand, ventilation air methane from the longwall face
B15-13330 represents 72.2% of methane in the whole district.

and Tingting Zhang
Abstract The calculation model of uniform air supply square hood was drawn
using Gambit, and the boundary conditions of numerical simulation for calculation
model were determined combined with the actual situation. The uniform air supply
of square hood was simulated for different velocity at hood by Fluent software. The
air distributions of the uniform air supply square hood and the air distributions of
the hood in the center line were put forward, and the change of the velocity with the
distance from the hood face has better change regular, which was found. The hood
size and the supply air velocity were non-qualiﬁed in order to eliminate the
inﬂuence of different hood size and supply air velocity. At last, the change regular
of supply air velocity with the distance from the hood face was put forward for the
uniform air supply square hood.

on the formation mechanism of uniform air supply, but the characteristics of the
uniform air supply have not been studied. Therefore, it is necessary to study the air

supply characteristics of the uniform air supply hood, which can provide the basic
theory support for the application of the uniform air supply hood.

Research Methods
2.1
Overview
According to the actual situation, the 0.5 m  0.5 m square uniform air supply
hood is determined as the main research object and 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8 m/s is,
respectively, set as wind speed of this square hood. After using Gambit to draw the
mathematical model, the numerical simulation is carried out by Fluent and the
results are analyzed by Excel. The inﬂuence of the hood size is eliminated by using
the dimensionless method.
2.2
Establishment of Mathematical Model
In order to avoid the inﬂuence of space on the air supply characteristics, a
25-m-long, 4-m-wide and 4-m-high calculation ﬁeld is set up. The air supply hood
is located on the left wall, and the center of the air supply hood is 2 m high which
also coincides with the center of the wall.
The 0.5 m  0.5 m square uniform air supply hood model is drawn by Gambit
and meshed by TGrid, as shown in Fig. 1. The air supply characteristics of 0.5, 0.6,
0.7, 0.8 m/s are simulated and calculated by Fluent.
2.3
Boundary Condition Setting
According to the actual situation, combined with the mathematical model and
Fluent simulation method, the main parameters and boundary conditions of
numerical simulation are determined as shown in Table 1.

Research Results
3.1
Air Supply Characteristics of the Uniform Airﬂow Hood
in Different Wind Speed
The contours of velocity magnitude of different wind speed (0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8 m/s)
are calculated by Fluent numerical simulation, as shown in Fig. 2.
As can be seen from Fig. 2, the wind speed decreases with the increase in the
distance and the air supply has little inﬂuence on the ﬂow ﬁeld of the surrounding
space. It is difﬁcult to distinguish the inﬂuence of different wind speed on the air
supply characteristics; therefore, when the wind speed is at different speed (0.5, 0.6,
0.7, 0.8 m/s), the wind speed on the center line of the hood is drawn, respectively,
as shown in Fig. 3.
As can be seen from Fig. 3, the wind speed of the air supply hood in the range of
1.25 m is almost invariable, after 14 m it decreases to 0 m/s, between 1.25 and
14 m, and the wind speed decreases rapidly with the increase in distance. The
greater the wind speed, the greater the rate of reduction.
3.2
Dimensionless Air Supply Characteristics of the Square
Uniform Airﬂow Hood
In order to eliminate the inﬂuence of the hood size and air supply speed, the size of
hood and air supply speed are dimensionless. That is, the ratio of the distance from
air supply hood (L) and the hood side length (a) is x, and the ratio of the simulation
values of wind speed (V) and the central wind speed (V0) is y. The results which
have been simulated and calculated by Fluent are processed, and then we get the
data as shown in Table 2.

As we can see in Fig. 4, ﬁrstly, after the dimensionless processing, the variation
law between V/V0 and L/a is almost unchanged when the wind speed of air supply
hood is at different value and this variation law shows a good linear
relationship. The results show that the variation law between wind speed of air
supply hood and the distance from hood can be well reﬂected after the wind speed
and distance are dimensionless. Secondly, the wind speed becomes 90% of the
wind speed in hood mouth at the distance of about 5.8 times the length of the hood,
the wind speed decreases by only 10%, and it can be considered that the wind speed
in the range of 5.8 times the length of the hood is basically unchanged. At the
distance of 24.6 times the length of the hood, the wind speed becomes 10% of the
wind speed in hood mouth and decreases by 90%, and it indicates that the wind of
the uniform air supply hood can blow up to 24.6 times the length of the square
hood.
In order to eliminate the simulation errors and value errors and obtain the
variation law of wind speed after 5.8 times the length of hood, the L/a is taken as
x axis, the V/V0 is taken as y axis, and the wind speed variation with distance is
shown in Fig. 5.
Using Excel to add the trend line, the linear relationship between the V/V0 and
L/a is obtained, as shown in Eq. 1.
y ¼ 1:8678x þ 4:5117
ð1Þ
Among them, y is V/V0, x is L/a.
Its R2 = 0.9982, indicating that Formula 1 has good reliability.

Conclusions
When the wind speed of the air supply hood is at different value, the variation law
between wind speed and distance from hood is obviously clear. After the dimen-
sionless processing, the variation law between the wind speed of uniform air supply

hood and the distance from hood conforms to the linear relationship, that is
V/V0 = 1.8678 L/a + 4.5117.

Method of Reliability Test Based
on Random Forest
Ke Li, Ruicong Ran, Shimin Song, Jun Wang and Lijing Wang
Abstract The spacecraft electrical signal characteristic data exist a large amount of
data, high dimension features, computational complexity degree and low rate of
identiﬁcation problems. This paper proposes the feature extraction method based on
wavelet de-noising and the classiﬁcation method based on random forest
(RF) algorithm. Considering the time complexity, the method of wavelet de-noising
is used to compress the data and reduce the dimension and then applied to clas-
siﬁcation. The random forest algorithm has superior performance in dealing with
the large amount of data. The experimental results show that compared with other
algorithms, the proposed method shows excellent performance in accuracy, com-
putational efﬁciency, stability in dealing with spacecraft electrical signal data.

Introduction
After the spacecraft step into the orbit ﬂight phase, fully working in high vacuum,
cold black and strong solar radiation environment. When a spacecraft launch, we
can impossible do a maintenance in orbit, so we need to make diagnosis and
forecast for possible fault [1] Spacecraft electronic load systems are typically
non-linear time-dependent systems, the coupling of internal components is highly
nonlinear, which are complex and uncertain. The mutations of internal load signal
occur frequently, and when the fault occurs in the system, the cause of the accident
will be intertwined. If there is no reliable source of information and analysis

methods, just relying on assumptions and speculation, it is difﬁcult to determine the
exact cause of the fault [2–4]. There are some problems that needed to be solved
urgently such as large amount of testing data, high feature dimension, high com-
putational complexity and low recognition rate in the identiﬁcation process of
spacecraft electrical characteristics monitoring system.
In the previous study, for example, Liu Y uses off-line fuzzy clustering and
online support vector machine to recognize the spacecraft electrical data, and uses
the weighted proximal support vector machine on the classiﬁcation and recognition
of the electrical data. In the process of recognition, the wavelet de-noising feature
method is used to reduce the dimension of the data, and the results of classiﬁcation
are better. However, the sample set type is less, the amount of the data is small, and
the classiﬁcation accuracy is low [5–8].
Relative to other algorithms, the random forest algorithm has a great advantage
in many data set. It can deal with high dimensional data, with good ability to learn
for large amount data, and it can realize the learning and classiﬁcation for nonlinear
sample data. It has unique advantage in the identiﬁcation of electrical characteristic
signals. In actual diagnosis process, if the input of electrical characteristic data is
too much, the training complexity will greatly increase. For the complex and high
dimensional feature system, a large amount of data will affect the training and
classiﬁcation efﬁciency, and leads to the decline of recognition accuracy rate. How
to obtain the sensitive features from the high dimension characteristics becomes one
of the bottlenecks for the fast and accurate identiﬁcation of electrical signals [9–13].

The Identiﬁcation System
In this paper, the process of algorithm model consists of three parts: data acqui-
sition, feature extraction, signal recognition. After collecting and preprocessing the
data, using deep neural network to extract the feature vectors from training set and
testing set. Then the random forest algorithm classiﬁcation model is trained by
training set, which means we can use the testing set for validation. And ﬁnally get
the classiﬁcation results. Speciﬁcally, the spacecraft is detected a total of
50-channel data and data from each channel is collected at rate of more than
30 MB/S. The ﬂow chart of the algorithm is shown in Fig. 1.

Feature Extraction and Classiﬁcation Algorithm
In the engineering application, the DNN system can be used on PHM spacecraft
data for classifying fault signals and normal signals for which the class label has
actual physical meaning. The basic network structure, the initialization of network
parameters and the ﬁne-tuning training are discussed in detail in the following
section.

Wavelet de-Noising
In the process of signal recognition and classiﬁcation, the collected data may
contain a lot of noise, in order to improve the accuracy of classiﬁcation and
recognition, digital ﬁlter is essential.
In this paper, the wavelet threshold de-noising method is used for data pro-
cessing [14–16]. Wavelet threshold de-noising method is a process of using wavelet
decomposition which make the separation of the original signal of high frequency
and low frequency and then taken on the reconstruction process, has a better effect
of the mutant noise. The ﬂow chart of wavelet de-noising is shown in Fig. 2

In this paper, the threshold de-noising method is used to deal with the noise
signal. The principle is that the wavelet coefﬁcients of the original signal are
processed by using the threshold value function. Threshold function reﬂects the
above and below the threshold of wavelet coefﬁcients from different processing
strategies, according to different spacecraft electrical characteristic data, using hard
threshold function or soft threshold function, so as to get a better ﬁltering
de-noising effect.

optimal classiﬁcation result [17–19].Steps to generate random forest are as follows:
1. From the original electrical signal training data, using the method of bootstrap,
selecting K new independent sample set randomly, and constructing K decision
tree. The sample comprise K out-of-bag data which is not selected

Given a set of classiﬁer h1ðXÞ; h2ðXÞ; . . .; hkðXÞ, the training set of each clas-

The margin function is used to measure the degree of the average correct
classiﬁcation and the average error classiﬁcation. The greater the margin value, the
more reliable the classiﬁcation prediction.
The generalization error is deﬁned as:
PE ¼ PX;YðmgðX; YÞ\0Þ

In the formula: subscript X, Y represent that the probability P covering X,

With the increase of the number of decision trees in random forest, all sequences

variable) converge to:

The formula indicates that the random forest will not produce the over ﬁtting

of generalization error [20, 21].

Experimental Results
4.1
Experiment Data Presentation
The experimental data comes from the typical electrical characteristics data of
spacecraft electronic load system. In the process of spacecraft load test, the elec-
tronic load bus of the spacecraft is monitored by the electric characteristic moni-
toring platform, and record the original data. 6 different kinds of signals and sample
label from the 13 mode of the spacecraft ﬂying data are presented in this study.
22,800 samples are acquired, where each sample is containing 1000 features.
Particularly, the physical meaning of the data is shown in Fig. 3.
The data set are ﬁrstly divided into two different sets that referred as the training
set and the test set before classiﬁcation. Namely, 12,800 original signals of total
56% used for model training and 10,000 original signals of total 44% used for
testing the performance of the training model. The original data were normalized

before training model. The classiﬁcation model is then trained by using the training
data set, and the testing data set is applied for model validation.
4.2
Number of Decision Trees Selection
In Fig. 4, we can see that the classiﬁcation error rate decreases with the increase of
the number of decision trees. After reaching the 100 trees, the classiﬁcation error
trends to be stable (about 0.01). However, the training time of the model will
increase with the increase of the number of decision tree. Therefore, considering the
problem of time complexity, select 100 decision trees consisting of random forest,
classify and predict the electrical signal sample sets. It not only ensures the accu-
racy of classiﬁcation, but also shortens the time needed for training and
classiﬁcation.
4.3
Number of Decision Trees Selection
Classiﬁcation accuracy and classiﬁcation time are the important symbols of eval-
uation algorithm. In this paper, we use the algorithms include Naive Bayesian
Model, K-Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machine, and random forest to clas-
sify the spacecraft electrical signal data, and get the classiﬁcation results of different
algorithms. At the same time, wavelet de-noising is used for feature extraction, and

then classify and recognize the electrical data. Comparing different algorithms’
performance before and after the data by feature extraction. When the feature
dimension of samples is too large, the classiﬁcation accuracy will be low due to the
dimension disaster. The dimension reduction of samples can not only improve the
computational speed but also improve the classiﬁcation accuracy. Table 1 shows
the recognition results of different algorithms in this paper. The ﬁrst column of the
table is different algorithms, second is accuracy of corresponding to each algorithm,
third is training time of each algorithm. RF, our algorithm, is random forest, and
Wavelet-RF is wavelet random forest.
From Table 1, we can see that, before feature extraction, the classiﬁcation
accuracy of the NBM algorithm and KNN algorithm are 79.02 and 85% respec-
tively. The classiﬁcation accuracy of SVM algorithm is slightly higher. The random

forest algorithm has highest accuracy rate of 98.9%, has better performance com-
pared to other algorithms, which is also fast. After feature extraction, the data
dimension and computational complexity is reduced, which makes the calculation
speed and accuracy are improved signiﬁcantly. Before and after the feature
extraction, random forest algorithm both show excellent classiﬁcation performance.
The train time is short and the accuracy is guaranteed.
Principal component analysis is widely used for pre-processing the engineering
data, but it is not good for processing the dimension reduction of nonlinear sepa-
rable samples. We can see that for the methods we use, the data has better sepa-
rability and faster computing speed, which is reduced dimension by Wavelet. The
comprehensive algorithm operating results show that the random forest algorithm
has the optimal performance in this multi class electrical characteristics in signal
recognition.

Conclusions
In this paper, a combination of random forest algorithm and data reduction method
is proposed, which can identify and classify the multi-class electrical signals of
spacecraft well. The dimension reduction of spacecraft electrical characteristic data
which has high dimension is realized. Then using random forest algorithm to
recognize the spacecraft electrical characteristic data. It not only reduces the time
needed for the computation, and further enhance the performance of the classiﬁer.
The algorithm is a simulation experiment of the original data of a certain spacecraft,
which can be directly applied to the classiﬁcation and identiﬁcation of the space-
craft electrical signals. The experimental results show that the recognition method
based on RF has higher classiﬁcation accuracy and better recognition efﬁciency.
Random forest algorithm has many advantages in dealing with the data, and it is
very ﬂexible and adaptive to deal with the fuzzy data which is speciﬁc rules.
According to the algorithm of the model, which calculated complexity is still large.
In future research, we can combine with other dimension reduction methods, test
effectiveness of the test methods on different data sets, carry out further opti-
mization in order to construct a better performance of the classiﬁer.

Cladding material of fuel element of fast
neutron reactor
Fei Li, Lei Peng and Chuan Wang
Abstract Feasibility and beneﬁts of applying grain boundary engineering
(GBE) to the fuel cladding material 316 or 15-15Ti austenitic stainless steels of
sodium-cooled fast reactor for reducing void swelling and creep are discussed. GBE
can be used to greatly enhance the proportion of low R coincidence site lattice
(CSL) grain boundaries that are mainly of annealing twins and its variants. The
cladding pipes are normally subjected to 20% cooled working after solution
annealing before using, which by virtue of providing a dislocation strewn matrix
microscopic structure, contributes to the annihilations of irradiation-induced point
defects. If the proportion of low RCSL grain boundaries are greatly enhanced prior
to the cooled working, transfer of slip across the special-structured grain boundaries
or pileup against them during deformation may alter the distribution of dislocations
of the microscopic structure, which may accommodate more defects generated
during being irradiated.

fuel. The uranium source of the type is limited and generates the nuclear waste of
which the half life is long after ﬁssion combustion. Compared with the nuclear
power technology of the third generation, the nuclear power technology of the
fourth generation is more economic and safer, and the amount of the nuclear waste
is little, the nuclear proliferation can be controlled, and the uranium utilization
efﬁciency is high. The six types of rectors which are believed most to be used for
the fourth generation are as follows: sodium-cooled fast neutron multiplication
reactor (called as the fast reactor for short), lead-cooled fast reactor, gas-cooled fast
reactor, super-high-temperature reactor, molten salt reactor and supercritical water
reactor [1]. The independent research and development for the key material used for
the nuclear power of the fourth generation will greatly support the nuclear power
technology of next generation.
Three reactors in the six types of reactors of the fourth generation are fast
reactors which cannot only use the nuclear energy for power generation but also can
multiply the nuclear fuel and convert the uranium-238 which can generate nuclear
ﬁssion into plutonium-239 which can generate nuclear ﬁssion, and also transmutes
the nuclear waste of long half time generated by thermal reactor running, which is
the necessary development process of the three steps (thermal reactor, fast reactor
and fusion reactor) for using nuclear energy as well as the extremely signiﬁcant
step.

Fast Neutron Reactor Fuel Element Cladding Material
Austenite stainless steel has excellent high-temperature mechanical property,
antioxidization performance and welding performance as well as outstanding
compatibility with liquid metal sodium; thus, it is chosen as the fuel element
cladding material of the fast reactor 930. When the fuel element cladding material
works under the high-energy neutron radiation environment, the material perfor-
mance will decrease, such as hardened material, decreased plasticity, increase of
creep rate, etc., which is caused as follows: the vacancy concentration increases
because of the radiation and then the vacancies mutually gather to form voids, and
then macroscopic volume expansion, density decrease and radiation swelling are
shown.
The fuel element cladding also contacts the liquid sodium of the cooling agent
and the ﬁssion products (such as Cs, I, Te, Se, etc.,) and then is corroded and bears
the stress generated by fuel swelling and ﬁssion gas expansion; thus, the
anti-high-temperature creep performance of the cladding material is very important
[2]. Under the high ﬂuence rate fast neutron radiation environment, the main issue
limiting the wide application of the Austenite stainless steel is its poor performance
for resisting neutron radiation swelling. On the basis of the understanding of the
468
F. Li et al.

radiation swelling phenomenon, some alloy design methods can be used for
improving the neutron radiation swelling resistance of the Austenite stainless steel,
including: (1) a little increase the nickel/chrome ratio, and simultaneously control
the adding of trace alloy elements such as silicon which can limit the void and
foreign matter compounds; (2) promote the precipitation caused by radiation and
change the migration characteristic of the point defect; (3) add a little amount of
titanium (mass fraction is lower than 1%), control the Ti/C ratio and increase the
amount of the ﬁne TiC precipitates because the interface between the ﬁne TiC
precipitates and the matrix can be the traps of the defect generated by radiation;
(4) carry out a certain amount of cold processing deformation after the solution
annealing treatment. Introduce dislocation into the microscopic structure to absorb
the point defect generated by radiation and increase the traps absorbing the ﬁssion
products; (5) add a little amount of phosphor to form the interface of the
plate-shaped phosphide and the fcc Austenite matrix to be helpful for the nucleation
of helium bubbles; thus, the voids caused by radiation can be absorbed. Indicated
by above, the design idea of using one or a plurality types of alloy can improve the
performance of the fast reactor fuel element cladding stainless steel material. As
demanded by the fast reactor development, the fuel element cladding material is
developed from 316 stainless steel to 15-15Ti stainless steel (15Cr-15Ni-Mo-Ti
Austenite stainless steel, which is also called as D9 alloy). Based on 316 stainless
steel, to the 15-15Ti stainless steel, the contents of titanium and silicon are con-
trolled to be added, and also the chrome content is decreased, and the nickel content
is increased [3]. Compared with the 316 stainless steel, the 15-15Ti stainless steel
owns better resistance of neutron radiation swelling and creeping resistance (refer to
Fig. 1, wherein dpa means the mean displacement times of each atom under the
given ﬂuence, i.e., displacement per atom) [4].

Introduction of Grain Boundary Engineering
(GBE) Technology
The grain boundary engineering (GBE) technology [5] may further improve the
radiation swelling resistance of the Austenite stainless steel material on the basis of
optimizing the material chemical ingredients, etc. Currently, in the fault energy
face-centered cubic metal material (such as Austenite stainless steel, nickel-base
alloy, etc.,) at the middle and lower layers, the study work on the GBE technology
makes a great progress, and the mass production of the grain boundary of the low
coincidence site lattice (CSL) in the crystallization process can be controlled and
promoted by the deformation and thermal processing technology, wherein most of
them are the crystal boundaries of the type of R3n (n = 1, 2, 3, …) of R3, R9 and
R27 [6]. It needs to be explained that the low RCSL boundary means the CSL
crystal boundary of R  29. It is the reciprocal of the density of the grain lattice
coincidence sites at both sides of the grain boundary.
Lin et al. [7] from Canada processed the nickel-base 600 alloy, and increased the
low RCSL grain boundary from 37 to 71%, and decreased the corrosion rate of the
material in the experiment of immersion corrosion of boiling ferric sulfate for
30–60%. The Canada company owning the technology patent has registered the
GBE technology as the trademark GBETM. Lehockey et al. [8] carried out GBE
processing to the lead alloy electrode plate of the lead acid battery, which increases
the low ratio of theRCSL grain boundary to be higher than 70%, and also the
corrosion resistance is signiﬁcantly improved, and the charging and discharging
circulation times of the battery are increased for 13 times. The study results of
Lehockey et al. [9] indicate after greatly increasing the low RCSL grain boundary
ratio of the metal nickel, the stable creeping rate of the material is greatly decreased.
Shimada et al. [10] from Japan increased the low RCSL grain boundary ratio of 304
stainless steel to be higher than 80%, and the intergranular corrosion rate is
decreased for about 75%. Kumar et al. [10] from the USA established the method
which predicts the material macro-performance by analyzing the grain boundary
network microscopic structure, and formed patent technology. Indicated by the
study results of Duh et al. [10] from Taiwan, China, to the 304 stainless steel after
proton radiation, the lower the R value is, the less the chromium-depleted phe-
nomenon at the CSL grain boundary will be. Sumantra et al. [10] from India studied
the inﬂuence of the processing technology on the ratio and distribution of the
special structure grain boundary of the 15-15Ti alloy. Besides, the data obtained in
many laboratories also indicate the GBE technology can signiﬁcantly increase
performance between multiple low-layer fault enegery face-centered cubic metal
material and the grain boundary.

Feasibility of Using GBE Technology for Further
Improving the Resistance of Fast Reactor Fuel Cladding
Material for Radiation Swelling, Etc.
To the fast reactor fuel cladding pipe, about 20% of cold working deformation
needs to be carried out after solution annealing processing no matter it is the 316 or
15-15Ti stainless steel pipe so as to introduce a great amount of dislocations in the
microscopic structure to absorb the point defects generated by radiation and
increase the traps for absorbing the ﬁssion products [11]. There is a special ori-
entation relationship among the grains at both sides of the low RCSL grain
boundary, when the material has plasticity deformation, the transmission of the
slippage among grains and the accumulation of the dislocations at the grain
boundary will be changed because of the special orientation relationship of the
grain [12]. After the 20% cold working deformation, the arrangement and distri-
bution of the dislocation of the material after GBE processing will be different from
the material without GBE processing, and the characteristics of radiation swelling
resistance will also be varied. Sekine et al. [13] studied the inﬂuence of the
advanced GBE processing on the electron radiation swelling resistance of the 316
stainless steel after cold working (the experiment temperature is 550 °C). As shown
in Fig. 2, the transverse coordinates are the electron radiation ﬂuence, and the
longitudinal coordinates are the swelling amount corresponding to the radiation.
The sample GBEM means the material after GBE processing, the sample AS means
the material without GBE technology processing but after the 20% cold working
deformation, and the sample GBEM20%CW means after GBE technology pro-
cessing and 20% cold working. The results show compared with the 316 stainless
steel sample after the same 20% cold working but without GBE processing, the 316
stainless steel after GBE processing and 20% cold working has lower swelling rate
after electron radiation. These studies show that the electron radiation and neutron
radiation have good corresponding relationships with the inﬂuence on the material;
thus, it is possible of using GBE technology for improving the neutron radiation
swelling resistance of the Austenite stainless steel after cold working.
These studies indicate that compared with the common large-angle grain
boundary, the size of the carbide precipitated from the low RCSL grain boundary is
more ﬁner and its distribution is more regular [14]. The interface between these
precipitants and the matrix material is also the position absorbing the radiation
defect; thus, the precipitation pattern, size and distribution of the second phase of
the grain boundary can be inﬂuenced by increasing the low ratio of the RCSL grain
boundary in the material, and also it inﬂuences the improvement of the radiation
swelling resistance of the material.
When the sodium-cooled fast reactor fuel cladding runs at the higher temperature
for a long time, the material generates creeping and radiation creeping under the
together action of fuel swelling and the stress generated by the release of the gas
ﬁssion products [2], the creeping resistance of the fuel element cladding material is
also very crucial. To the Austenite stainless steel and the nickel-base alloy used in
Cladding material of fuel element of fast neutron reactor
471

the non-radiation environment, increasing the low RCSL grain boundary ratio of
the material can effectively improve the high-temperature creeping resistance [9],
which is mainly caused by follows: the orderliness of the low RCSL grain boundary
structure increases its strength under the high temperature, the relative slippage
tendency of the grains at both sides of the grain boundary is less, and the dislocation
absorbs the point defect generated by the dislocation and then climb motion is
generated; thus, the radiation creeping is generated. Because the layer fault energy
of the Austenite stainless steel is low, and the dislocation climb motion is not easy,
if the GBE technology processing is used for changing the dislocation distribution
status to increase the capability for absorbing the void defects generated by radi-
ation, then the radiation creeping resistance may also be increased.
Although the metal material in the body-centered cubic structure (such as
the Martensite stainless steel) has better radiation swelling resistance than that of the
Austenite stainless steel in the face-centered cubic structure, the strength of the
metal material in the body-centered cubic structure at the high temperature is far
lower than the metal material in the face-centered cubic structure. The nanometer
oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) steel has excellent stability and creeping
resistance under the radiation environment, but its preparation technology is
complex and there is still a long distance to actual application [15]. Thus, at present,
it shall consider the GBE technology as follows: on the basis of the Austenite
stainless steel used by the current fuel element cladding, the grain boundary in the
special structure of the material and the dislocation distribution after deformation
can be controlled to further improve the radiation swelling resistance and creeping
resistance of the fast reactor fuel element cladding. The GBE technology does not
need to adjust the chemical ingredients of the material; thus, there is no difference
between the capability of the Austenite stainless steel after GBE technology pro-
cessing with the high-temperature liquid sodium and ﬁssion products and the one of
the Austenite stainless steel without GBE technology processing; thus, additional

consideration can be saved. In addition, the intergranular corrosion resistance of the
low RCSL grain boundary is better than that of the common large-angle grain
boundary; thus, the intergranular corrosion of the inner wall of the fuel element
cladding pipe caused by ﬁssion products can be signiﬁcantly improved by
increasing the low ratio of the RCSL grain boundary.
As discussed above, it is necessary of studying the GBE technology of the
Austenite stainless steel (such as 316, 15-15Ti) pipe material for fast reactor fuel
element cladding, and shall make the cladding pipe after GBE technology pro-
cessing and 20% cold working deformation into fuel rods for the neutron radiation
test to get the preparation technology of the Austenite stainless steel pipe for fast
reactor fuel cladding with the independent intellectual properties.

Preliminary Results of Applying GBE Technology
in the Fast Reactor Fuel Element Cladding Pipe
The study of GBE technology mainly focuses in the face-centered cubic metal
material of the low-layer fault energy, and the low ratio of the RCSL grain
boundary of the material is increased on the basis of forming the annealing crystal
twin. Currently, there are mainly three technical lines as follows for the thin plate or
the thin-wall pipe: (1) after the cold working deformation of 3–8%, anneal for a
long time (10–100 h) under the condition of being close to the recrystallization
temperature of the material [10]; (2) after the cold working deformation lower than
30%, anneal for a short time (3–60 min) under the condition of being higher than
the recrystallization temperature of the material, and repeate the technology for 3 to
times [10]; (3) carry out short time recrystallization and annealing after the cold
working deformation of 5–10% at a relatively high temperature (it is equal to the
solution processing temperature to the nickel-base alloy and Austenite stainless
steel) [16]. These technologies have the advantage that the ratio of the RCSL grain
boundary of the material can be greatly increased and multiple types of performance
of the material relevant to the grain boundary can be improved by only adjusting the
cold working deformation and thermal processing way without changing the
material ingredients; however, the ﬁrst technology needs the annealing of a long
time, which is not helpful for the cost control of industrial production; the second
technology needs repeated cold working and annealing, the technology is complex
and cannot be easily controlled in industrial production; but the third technology is
not only simple and can be easily realized, but also its annealing temperature is
consistent with the solution processing temperature, and it can be linked up with the
solution processing technology used in the current production of the nickel-base
alloy and the Austenite stainless steel.
The third technology is used for GBE processing to 15-15 Ti Austenite stainless
steel, and the grain boundary distribution graphs of different types are obtained by
using the test of the electron backscatter diffraction technology. The material after
Cladding material of fuel element of fast neutron reactor

GBE processing contains many annealing crystal twins (R3 grain boundary) and its
derivative multiple crystal twins (R9 and R27 grain boundaries), and they are
connected mutually to form a great quantity of R3n type triple junction grain
boundaries (such as R3-R3-R9 and R3-R9-R27 grain boundary) and also the grain
boundary network distribution which is characterized in the large-size microscopic
structure with clusters of grains with mutual R3n orientation relationship [17]. All
grains have the R3 orientation difference relationship no matter they are adjacent or
not, and the grain clusters are basically composed of random grain boundaries. The
general low ratio of the RCSL grain boundary can be higher than 70% (72.3%). The
mean grain size obtained by the equivalent circle diameter method is about 9 lm;
thus, GBE processing can be carried out on the 15-15Ti Austenite stainless steel
material.
The processing of GBE technology can be realized by only a little adjusting the
technology ﬂow for producing the nickel-base alloy and the Austenite stainless
steel, and the low ratio of the RCSL grain boundary of the Austenite stainless steel
can be greatly increased. In the process of combining with the actual industrialized
production, it needs to consider if the selected technical parameters match the actual
production condition and the requirement of the ﬁnished material, and also the grain
size, the second phase precipitates of the carbide, the material structure status and
other original microscopic structure of the material before GBE processing shall
also be considered [18]. These original microscopic structure statuses not only
inﬂuence the network distribution, grain size, etc., after GBE processing, but also
can control the ﬁnal distribution of the grain boundary characteristics, the grain size
and other microscopic structure characteristics of the material by adjusting the
original microscopic structure status to match the technical parameters of GBE
processing.

Research on Detection of Environmental
Factors Based on IOT Technology
Qing Liu, Pinggen Wang and Jiatai Chen
Abstract The “man,” “machine,” and “environment” can be seen as the three
elements of the man-machine-environment system engineering (MMESE). And the
“environment” refers to the special conditions of people and machines (or com-
puters), which includes both physical and social factors. The man-machine-
environment system constitutes a very complex super giant system through the
information transmission, information processing, and information control between
three elements above. Consequently, the detection of environmental parameter plays
a critical role in MMESE; in particular, the emergence of the Internet of things
(IOT) technology makes the environmental factor detection development intelligent
and quantitative. In our paper, we propose a design scheme of intelligent detection of
environmental factors based on the IOT technology and embedded computer tech-
nology. The design of hardware circuit is integrated by the Cortex A8 chip module
equipped with CC2530 wireless sensor module and the corresponding peripheral
circuits, which also comprises 5 sensor nodes used to sensing environment param-
eters. The terminal node makes up the Zigbee wireless sensor network with coor-
dinator node by means of star topology. And the collected data are transformed to
central control gateway. Debugging through the integrated editing software IAR and
visual interface designing by QT creator software within virtual machine VMware,
ﬁnally we achieve intelligent detection and control of environmental factors.

Introduction
The man-machine-environment system engineering (MMESE) [1, 2] is a technique
of system science and system engineering and is an academic discipline of com-
prehensive study on the optimal combination of man-machine-environment system,
which can correctly handle the relationship between three elements human, machine,
and environment. Under the guidance of the famous scientist and academician Qian
Xuesen at 1981, the man-machine-environment system engineering was emerged in
China and it was a comprehensive science of boundary technology. The so-called
environment, which includes the inﬂuence of both physical and social factors, refers
to the special conditions of people and machines (or computers). The MMESE
regards the “man,” “machine,” and “environment” as the three main elements of the
system, which forms a very complex super giant system by means of information
transmission, information processing, and information control between the three
factors above. Obviously, for any system, the total performance of the system
depends not only on the individual performance of each component but also mostly
on the correlation format of the three elements of the system that is on the means of
information transmission, information processing, and information control.
Consequently, “environment” refers to the speciﬁc production or working con-
ditions (such as temperature, humidity, noise, smoke, gas concentration, and
vibration), which affects the management objectives of system “safe, efﬁcient, and
economic.”
In recent years, many scholars have devoted a lot of work to the monitoring of
environmental factors. Especially, the emergence of the IOT technology leads to the
trend of automation and intelligent coming about the environmental parameter
detection. For examples, the author HE [3] designed a distributed environment
monitoring system, which based on STM32 and CAN to solve the problems about
the environmental management system of coal mine, but that system was complex
and the monitoring points were scattered. Ji [4] used MCU ATmage16L and RF
module XBee to establish a kind of design proposal for agricultural environment
remote monitoring of wireless star-shaped sensor network based on ZigBee tech-
nology. And the system was implemented to meet the demand of real-time moni-
toring system of crop planting environment by monitoring temperature, humidity,
illumination, and other information. Gao [5] proposed the design of environment
monitoring system based on ZigBee wireless sensor networks to monitor the
environment temperature and gas smoke, which consists of a sensor node and a
coordinator node. The result is displayed by the coordinator transmitted to a PC. Cai
[6] discussed the wireless sensor network nodes used low-power processors, Atmel
ATmega1281 and AT86RF231 RF chip, eventually achieving a low cost, low
complexity detection system, which can real-time detect environmental factors such
as temperature and humidity. Dong [7] combined the IOT and environmental
monitoring closely to construct a comprehensive, multi-level, and intelligent
monitoring system based on the all-weather coverage. That system can monitor the
main environmental factors, the main areas, key watersheds, and water quality
478

standards for pollutants and so master the environmental quality status and trends.
Wang [8] designed the wireless sensor network system for data acquisition with
ultralow-power ATmega8 and SZOS wireless communication module as well as
some environmental factor detection sensors. The network collected temperature,
humidity, illumination, carbon dioxide, and acoustic emission (AE), which reﬂect
the disease status of the crops, and transmitted through wireless way to the PC
monitoring center on time. Liu [9] relied on the embedded Linux, ZigBee
short-range communication, WEB server, RFID, and other related technologies,
which realizes the remote monitoring and centralized management for the under-
ground environment data. Then, the system can complete the positioning and
tracking of the underground staff through the RFID technology.
The above studies have achieved certain results, but the numbers of sensor nodes
are less; at the same time, the software system for analysis is few. Therefore, this
paper puts forward research and design of real-time environmental factor moni-
toring system based on IOT and embedded system technology to solve the problem
of environmental information. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In
Sect. 2, we provide a brief review of IOT and embedded system technology in the
information domain. In Sect. 3, we propose a novel environment factors detection
system using embedded system technology and IOT technologies. Section 4 pre-
sents our conclusion and analysis.

special computer system that can meet the requirements of application system, such
as function, reliability, cost, volume, and power consumption. The core of
embedded system consists of hardware layer, middle layer, system software layer,
and application software layer. With the improvement of real-time requirements and
software scale rising, real-time kernel has been developed into a real-time
multi-task operating system (RTOS). As a software platform, it has gradually
become the mainstream of the international embedded system.

Environmental Factor Detection System Architecture
3.1
Environment Factor Detection Hardware System
This paper studies the construction of the system to complete the temperature and
humidity, light, smoke, ﬂame, combustible gas, and other environmental parameters
monitoring. The collected data are uploaded to the central monitoring center
through wireless sensor nodes and then provided an effective basis for intelligent
security decisions. The system is an integrated system, which integrates the tech-
nology of IOT, embedded system, sensor, computer, and so on. Figure 1 shows the
hardware architecture of the system.

Q. Liu et al.

As shown in Fig. 1, the system is composed of central control module, Zigbee
coordinator, 5 terminal nodes, and remote control module. Inside the central control
system is the core control system, which mainly composed of Cortex-A8 embedded
gateway, Zigbee Coordinator, and whose function is data processing and
controlling.
The physical structure of the control system is shown in Fig. 2, and A8
embedded gateway is the control center of the whole environment parameter
detection system. It is equipped with 7-in. resistive touch display integrated screen,
through which can control all the devices of the whole system. It has a friendly
man–machine interface UI, and it is the information convergence center of all
Zigbee nodes and the forwarding center of Internet data, in whose interior a small
Web server was built, and enabling which supports the remote internet access.
The Zigbee coordinator connects with the A8 embedded gateway through the
USB interface to realize data communication. Its function is to build Zigbee net-
work and combine all the Zigbee nodes in the home together. It will forward the
data uploaded to each node to the A8 embedded gateway; at the same time, all the
instructions are received by the embedded gateway and forwarded to the corre-
sponding Zigbee node, and ﬁnally completed the data transmission of Zigbee data
layer.
There are 5 kinds of environmental factor detection sensors in our system, that is
ambient temperature and humidity sensor, light sensor, smoke sensor, ﬂame sensor,

and combustible gas sensor. It is equipped with 5 wireless sensor modules or 5
terminal nodes, which collected, respectively, indoor illumination, temperature and
humidity, smoke information, combustible gas information, and ﬂame information.
The information collection node can be set to the two state of arm or disarm; in the
arm state, the central controller would send alarm information to the preset alarm
user and the control node sends out alarm sound simultaneously when abnormal
information was detected. Thereby the system achieved the functions of security
monitoring as shown in Fig. 3.
The wireless sensor module used by the coordination node and terminal node is
CC2530, which was the second-generation production of the 802.15.4/Zigbee in the
2.4 GHz band to support the IEEE chip system by TI company. As shown in Fig. 4,

there is a data communication link between terminal sensor node and coordinator
node, ZigBee network, which can be made up of three network topologies: star,
tree, and mesh type. Because of the advantages of simple and convenient structure
about star type, that is, it does not need routing, it can realize the independent power
supply on the terminal node and realize the complete wireless network. Therefore,
this paper studies the environmental parameters detection system to select the star
WSN network topology.
3.2
Environment Factor Detection Software Design Flow
The software design mainly includes three parts: software design of embedded
gateway system, coordinator node, and terminal sensor node. The hardware circuit
of the embedded gateway connected USB port and PC through the CAN port, and
the required application code was edited and debugged in the VMware player
environment of the host computer after the system was written on the tablet and
then through the serial port to download and run the code. Visual operation code
was edited and debugged by QT creator software.

In fact, the core of the Zigbee node is a 8051 core microcontroller, whose
software development environment was IAR Embedded Workbench. Of course,
IAR Embedded Workbench also needs to cooperate with the ZigBee node debugger
to complete the program download, debugging, etc. Figure 5 represents, respec-
tively, the software design ﬂow chart of the coordinator node and sensor node.
As shown in Fig. 6, the visual interactive interface of the gateway mainly
composed of sensor data processing and display, node management, security

utility model can realize the functions of temperature and humidity, illumination,
ﬁre, combustible gas and smoke data display, processing and preservation; in
addition, voice alarm settings can also be set when the environment factor exceeds
the preset value.

Conclusions
In this paper, the environmental factor detection system is based on Cortex-A8,
CC2530 chip, design of ZigBee wireless network, which complete the wireless
monitoring of the temperature and humidity, combustible gas, smoke concentration,
ﬂame, and light in the environment. This system can provide a viable solution for
remote monitoring and control of the environment. The next step will be to study
the multi-node network mode in order to ﬁnd an effective way of data transmission
in wireless sensor networks.

Technology in a Washing Board Room
Based on Numerical Simulation
Shasha Liang, Jianwu Chen, Bin Yang, Menglu Lin, Lindong Liu
and Tingting Zhang
Abstract The concentration of toxic substances in the electronics industry washing
board room exceeds the standard seriously, and it is due to the lack of effective
ventilation protection technology. This article takes one electronics industry
washing board room as the research object, and based on the software such as
FLUENT, the problems existing in the original ventilation facilities are simulated
and analyzed. This paper presents a method of calculating the airﬂow uniform
ventilation type and the existing problems. The inﬂuence of K value on the push–
pull ventilating system and the effect of toluene protection were studied by using
simulation method, and when the K value is 2.5, the protection effect is the best and
the electronics industry washing board room that has the effective toxic hazards
protection has a good guiding signiﬁcance.

Introduction
Screen printing is an important process of the current electronic components pro-
duction. Normally, the printing baseplates need to be washed by manual cleaning
with plate washing water [1]. As the plate washing water contains a large amount of
organic solvents, workers are exposed to toxic concentration far above the national

limit in a short period, increasing the risk of occupational diseases and acute poi-
soning. But nowadays, the bad inﬂuence of plate washing water on workers’
occupational health has not yet attracted enough attention [2].
As the scrubbing space is small, the printing baseplate is large and some other
problems also exist in manual washing; these all make it difﬁcult to protect from the
toxic hazards in washing plate effectively. This paper uses simulation analysis
technology and puts forward the effective antivirus ventilation technology on the
basis of analyzing the ventilation and antivirus facilities in the washing plate room.

Numerical Simulation and Analysis of the Existing
Antivirus Ventilation Facilities in a Washing Plate
Room
2.1
The Present Situation of Antivirus Ventilation Facilities
in a Washing Plate Room
This washing plate room is equipped with upper air supply and axial ﬂow fan
exhaust ventilation system, as shown in Fig. 1.
2.2
Numerical Simulation Analysis of the Existing Antivirus
Ventilation Facilities
Ignoring the airﬂow’s interference in washing plate room, according to the actual
size of washing plate room and the sizes of air supply and exhaust facilities, this
paper uses GAMBIT to build the mathematical model. The airﬂow in washing plate
room is turbulence, the wind speed in air supply outlet is 3.75 m/s, and the diameter
Fig. 1 Local ventilation system
488
S. Liang et al.

of the air supply duct is 300 mm. The diameter of the air exhaust outlet is 3.53 m/s,
and the diameter of the air exhaust duct is 400 m. According to the turbulence
model (k −e double equation model), contours of velocity magnitude of different
interface (as shown in Fig. 2) are simulated and calculated by using FLUENT; the
wind speed unit is m/s.
It can be seen from Fig. 2 that the air supply effect of existing antivirus venti-
lation facilities is markedly strong, the airﬂow hits the left bottom corner and the
wall and then rebound to the top of workshop area, and part of the airﬂow exhausts
from outlet. Vortex regions are formed at the top and right area in workshop area.
The airﬂow in the whole washing plate room is comparatively disordered.
In order to make further research on the problems of the existing antivirus
ventilation facilities, based on the above model, a toluene source is added on the
print baseplate. The diffusion rate of toluene is set to 0.5 m/s, and the mass fraction
of toluene is calculated by FLUENT, as shown in Fig. 3.

c y=1.7m, 2.2m

Figures 2 and 3 show that toluene is blown away by wind. There is high toluene
concentration in the top and left of washing plate because of the vortex, which leads
the concentration of toluene to exceed the standard seriously. This illustrates that
the existing antivirus ventilation facilities in washing plate room cannot achieve the
desired effect and cannot meet the demand for toluene protection.

Study on Antivirus Ventilation Technology in Washing
Plate Room
3.1
The Selection of Antivirus Ventilation Mode
and Calculation Model
The working space of this washing plate room is narrow (the length, width and
height are, respectively, 2.5, 1.5 and 2.5 m.), and the workpiece is large (both the
length and width of printing baseplate are 0.8 m) which block the airﬂow move-
ment. The airﬂow is inﬂuenced strongly in washing process, and ventilation
facilities cannot make differences when workers are operating [3]. Due to the above
reasons, this washing plate room is suitable for horizontal uniform airﬂow blowing–
suction ventilation system. Because the air supply outlet and exhaust outlet of this
blowing–suction ventilation should not be less than the size of workpiece, the size
of air supply outlet and exhaust outlet is set to 0.95 m long  0.95 m wide.
Referring to the size of printing baseplate and washing plate room, the table size is
set to 3.5 m long  0.95 m wide. The size of toluene source on the printing
baseplate is set to 0.7 m long  0.7 m wide, and the toluene diffusion rate is set to
0.5 m/s. The calculation model of the blowing–suction ventilation system is shown
in Fig. 4.

3.2
Calculation Method of Blowing–Suction
Ventilation System
The uniform airﬂow blowing–suction ventilation system is calculated by the ﬂow
ratio method which is proposed by Japanese Bayashi Taro [4]. In this calculation
method, the wind speed coming out from the uniform airﬂow hood is usually set to
0.5 m/s, so the wind speed of air hood in this washing plate is also set to 0.5 m/s.
Air supply volume = V  A = 0.5  A
Among them, Q1 is the air volume of air supply hood and the unit is m3/s;
A is the area of air supply hood and the unit is m2.
Air exhaust volume = Q2 = K  Q1
Among them, Q1 is the air volume of air supply hood and the unit is m3/s;
Q2 is the air volume of air exhaust hood and the unit is m3/s;
K air supply volume/air exhaust volume and that is ﬂow ratio.
The size of both air supply hood and air exhaust hood is 0.7 m  0.7 m. The
Design Standard and Management Manual for Local Exhaust and Blowing-Suction
Ventilation Device, written by Iwasaki, puts forward the ﬂowing standards [5].
(1) When the distance between blowing hood and suction hood is less than 4–5
times the short edge or diameter of air supply hood, K = 1–3.
(2) When the distance between blowing hood and suction hood is more than 4–5
times the short edge or diameter of air supply hood, K = 2–5.
It is difﬁcult to select the appropriate K value according to experience when the
distance between blowing hood and suction hood is 5 times longer than air supply
hood length. Therefore, this paper uses FLUENT to simulate the antivirus venti-
lation effect in washing plate with different K values.

3.3
Effect of K Value on Airﬂow
In this paper, we simulate and analyze the airﬂow organization and poison control in
this washing plate room when K takes different values (1.7, 1.9, 2.1, 2.3, 2.5, 2.7).
In the case of no pollution source, the wind speed distribution is simulated when
K takes different values, and the wind speed distribution of the blowing–suction
ventilation system in this washing plate room is shown in Fig. 5.
It can be seen from Fig. 5 that the wind speed of the exhaust hood increases
gradually with the increase in the K value, the suction velocity is faster, and the
airﬂow between blowing hood and suction hood is more uniform. The appropriate
K value means when K takes this value, the concentration of toluene in respiratory

zone is the lowest, but it is difﬁcult to determine it just according to the counters of
velocity magnitude. Therefore, a toluene pollution source is added in the blowing–
suction ventilation system. The appropriate K value can be determined by com-
paring the toluene concentration.
3.4
Effect of K Value on Toluene Concentration
In combination with the above models, a 0.7-m-long  0.7-m-wide toluene source
is set on the printing baseplate and FLUENT software is used for the simulation
analysis. When K takes different values, the volume fraction distribution of toluene
on the exhaust hood centerline at 1.5 m height (human respiratory band position) is
shown in Fig. 6.
It can be seen from Fig. 6 that when K < 2.5, the volume fraction of toluene
decreases with the increase in K value and the volume fraction decreases to a
minimum at K = 2.5, while the volume fraction of toluene increases when K = 2.7.
Then, simulation results show that when K = 2.5, the toluene can be controlled
effectively. That is, the appropriate K value of washing plate room is 2.5.
4
Conclusions
This paper carries out numerical simulation analysis on the existing antivirus
ventilation facilities of washing plate room and puts forward the problems of the
existing ventilation system about toxic hazards protection. Then, a horizontal
uniform airﬂow blowing–suction ventilation system is designed and a mathematical

model is established. By using the numerical simulation, it is determined that when
the K value is 2.5, the protective effect is the best. This paper provides an intro-
duction for the electronics industry washing plate room on toxic hazard protection.

Discussion
When the environment temperature is 12.2 °C, starting the temperature-controlled
seat, it tends to balance within about 8 min, and as time prolongs, the temperature
still goes up, the backrest temperature of the temperature-controlled seat goes up to
about 27.5 °C maximum, and cushion temperature of temperature-controlled seat
goes up to about 26.6 °C maximum. When the environment temperature is 15.9 °C,
starting the temperature-controlled seat, the backrest of temperature-controlled seat
tends to balance within about 19 min, goes down to about 17.0 °C maximum, and
the cushion of temperature-controlled seat tends to balance within about 27 min and
goes down to about 18.4 °C maximum.
Due to the constraint of test condition, the environment temperature is not very
ideal, and the performance of the temperature-controlled seat is not completely
shown. However, viewing from the test results, the temperature rise/drop effect of
the temperature-controlled seat is very obvious. In addition, compared with air
conditioner and liquid cooling suit, the temperature-controlled seat features low
power, no occupation vehicle space, and without wearing, and boasts very good
value in promotion and application [3–5].

Conclusion
After the actual vehicle test, the temperature-controlled seat features very good
effect and is capable of perfectly meeting the demands of using under
high-temperature and extremely cold conditions of special vehicle and can effec-
tively improve the continuous working capability of crews.

The Measurement and Analysis
of the Inside Noise Field Formed
by a Special Vehicle
Yuping Luo, Ruiping Niu, Yajuan Bai, Yaofeng He, Qingchang Chen
and Longtang Xu
Abstract Noise is one of the basic characteristic signals of vehicle. When the
vehicle works, the noise forms two noise ﬁelds which are inside or outside of
vehicle. The analysis of noise ﬁeld has very important realistic meaning to vehicle.
The noise inside the vehicle is an important realm content that inﬂuences personnel.
In the noise reduction design, noise source identiﬁcation is the primary work of
noise control. Now the experimental data of special vehicle noise synthesizing ﬁeld
are very limited. According to this, in this paper, the typical special vehicle is taken
as the object of study, and the spectrum characteristics of the noise inside the
vehicle are analyzed by experiments. The results show that the noise inside comes
from motive and activity.

Preface
In accordance with the requirements listed in relevant standards [1], the allowed
noise level of daily continuous exposure 8 h is 85 dB(A), which can protect over
90% personnel from hearing damage. It will cause organic disease of hearing organ
and result in hearing damage after long-term exposure in the environment with
noise over 85 dB(A) [2]. When driving the special vehicle, the noise intensity
inside vehicle is about 110 dB(A), which exceeds the allowed noise standard.
Therefore, measures shall be taken to drop the noise level inside vehicle. The reason
for the high noise inside vehicle is because vehicle is one complicated structure
with several noise sources and complicated sound transmission route. When the
doors and windows are closed, the inside vehicle forms one closed cavity and sound
reﬂects repeatedly in the vehicle and forms the reverberation sound ﬁeld, which

increases the sound pressure level inside vehicle [3, 4]. The sound ﬁeld charac-
teristic has close relation with the vehicle structure, working state and working
environment. Taking the working state as an example, the gear, rotating speed of
engine and driving speed may directly inﬂuence the sound ﬁeld. In order to research
the inﬂuence of the above factors on the vehicle sound ﬁeld, a typical special
vehicle is taken as the object of study, and the spectrum characteristics of the noise
inside the vehicle are analyzed by experiments.
1
Tested Object
The tested object is a certain model of special vehicle, engine compartment is at the
right front part of the vehicle body, the driving cabin is at the left side of the engine
compartment, and the working cabin is at middle of the vehicle body.
2
Test Site
The straightaway is selected as the actual test road. The length is about 1000 m.
The pavement is the smooth, straight, dry and clean gravel road with longitudinal
gradient <l%. There is no reﬂecting object within 30-m range on both sides of the
road central line.
3
Environment Conditions
The test day has sunny weather, relative humidity is 48%, and air temperature is
22.5 °C with calm wind.
Strong background noise will cause relatively big error for noise test. Therefore,
during test, in order to ensure the data objective, the background noise is measured
continuously for 30 s, and the average value is 42.0 dB(A). When the engine works
idling, the average noise of this point is 67 dB(A). According to the requirement,
when the tested noise level is over 10 dB higher than the background noise, the
inﬂuence of background noise is negligible. Therefore, it does not need to correct
the background noise for this test.

Test Method
Under full load of the vehicle, the noise is measured at 4 operator positions.
Microphones are set according to requirements [5], since the inside space of vehicle
is narrow; during test, according to the actual conditions of the vehicle, the
microphones are set nearest to the regulated measure point, where measure point 1
is at the driving cabin, 800 mm above the driver seat surface, 50 mm to the engine
bulkhead; measure point 2 is at the center of the working cabin, 800 mm above the
seat surface; measure point 3 is at the right and rear side of the vehicle, 800 mm
above the seat surface; and measure point 4 is at the left rear side of the vehicle,
800 mm above the seat surface.
The test is conducted in two kinds of conditions: starting in place and vehicle
driving.
(1) Noise inside vehicle measurement under engine idling
The vehicle keeps at the test site, doors and windows are closed, at neutral,
engine is started, the rotating speed increases from 800 rpm (holding for 30 s) to
1500 rpm by quickly stepping the throttle.
(2) Noise inside vehicle measurement under driving at uniform speed
The doors and windows of vehicle are closed, the engine works at the upper limit
of the rotating speed, and vehicle drives at the uniform speed of 10, 20, 30 km/h
with windows closed (holding time shall not <1 min).

Test Results and Analysis
Figure 1 is the noise change conditions inside vehicle at measure points under
engine idling.
It is shown from Fig. 1, after increasing the rotating speed, the noise at the
measure points in the vehicle increases accordingly. The A sound level of the
measure points when engine idling, from high to low, is “engine compartment
bulkhead-right rear part-left rear part-working cabin”, which means that the engine
noise is the main noise source. Additionally, vehicle rear part may easily radiate out

relatively big noise due to the vibrational excitation of engine compartment since
the vehicle body wall is thin. The noise in the working cabin is relatively low since
its position is relatively high. However, because the working cabin is close to the
engine compartment, after increasing the rotating speed, the noise increase range is
relatively big. The rear parts on both sides are relatively far to the engine com-
partment, and the noise increase range is relatively small as the increase in rotating
speed.
Figure 2 is the noise change conditions at measure points inside vehicle under
uniform speed.
It is shown from Fig. 2, as the increase in vehicle speed, the noise inside vehicle
increases obviously. When the vehicle speed is 10 km/h, the noise is 85–90 dB(A),
95–100 dB(A) at 20 km/h and 98–104 dB(A) at 30 km/h. The A sound level of the
measure points when the vehicle travels at the uniform speed, from high to low,is
“engine compartment bulkhead-right rear part working cabin-left rear part”, com-
paring with the starting in place state, the noise at the right rear part (the side near
the engine compartment) is obviously higher than the left side. When driving at
high speed, the noise in the working cabin is slightly higher than the left side, which
shows the obvious excitation effect of the engine compartment to the noise inside
vehicle.
Figure 3 is the noise frequency spectrum at the measure points in the vehicle
under different working conditions.
It is shown from Fig. 3 the frequency components of the noise at measure points
are mainly 20–8 kHz, where the sound pressure in 20–160-Hz frequency range (1/3
octave center frequency, the same for below) is relatively high, and then the sound
pressure in the 160–800-Hz frequency range and the sound pressure in 800–
Fig. 2 A-weighed SPL (uniform speed)

8000-Hz frequency range are relatively low. Under starting in place and low
rotating speed, the sound pressure in the 40–63-Hz frequency range at rear part of
both sides is obviously higher than other measure points. Increasing the rotating
speed and vehicle speed, the noise of different frequency ranges in the vehicle
increases obviously. Additionally, when the vehicle keeps at the driving state, as the
increase in vehicle speed, the noise of 5–20-kHz high frequency range increases
obviously. This frequency range shall be the higher harmonic of varied fundamental
frequencies and the high-frequency excitation of the pavement. Therefore, under the
driving state, the noise inside vehicle is mainly from the higher harmonic of dif-
ferent parts under complicated excitation.

Conclusion
The main noise source of sound ﬁeld inside vehicle is the engine compartment
bulkhead caused by compartment and moving part, housing vibration and excita-
tion. Under the starting in place state, the change of rotating speed mainly inﬂu-
ences

Experimental Study on Display Format
of Target Range for HUD of Aircraft
Xiaochao Guo, Duanqin Xiong, Qingfeng Liu, Jian Du
and Yanyan Wang
Abstract An experiment was conducted to explore the optimal display format of
target range for HUD of aircraft. An integrated display format with trigon attached
to the target designator was deﬁned and compared with a separable display format
of ﬁxed scale with level linear indicator. The cognitive tasks were of extractive task
versus integrative task in simulated ﬂight with 2  2 within-subject experiment
design. There were 151 Chinese male pilots participating in the human factor test.
Results were found that the integrated display format of target range was recognized
much better and faster in performance of 7.61% increments in correct reaction and
1.16s decrements in correct reaction time compared with the separable format and
approved by 90.76% of the pilots. The conclusion was made that the integrated
display format of target range could improve cognitive performance of target range
information in HUD of aircraft on the basis of discussion.

Introduction
Display formats of data impacted on interpretations of coming information and
cognitive performance [1, 2], even situation awareness. The optimal format of
display was therefore pursued with head-up display (HUD) or helmet-mounted
displays (HMD) especially in aircraft cockpit for pilots [3, 4]. For example, GJB300
speciﬁed that the target range should be a range scale with an horizontal indicator in
mode of missile attack presented on bottom of HUD ﬁeld of view (FOV) [5], but
MIL-STD-1787B required to display missile aiming reticle in which target range

presented as circular bar around the inside perimeter of the aiming reticle as well as
a ﬁxed radar range scale with a moving caret to indicate target range [6]. A human
factor experiment was conducted to choose a better display format of target range
for HUD of aircraft in present paper.

Method
2.1
Display Formats of Target Range
There were 2 display formats of target rang as shown in Fig. 1. They were pre-
sented to participants of pilots dynamically in HUD pictures, which were deﬁned as
integrated format or separable format relative to target designator.
In Fig. 1, the Rmax denoted the maximum launch range which included two
different situations, the Rmin indicated the minimum time of ﬂight required for
usage, and the closure rate shall be the departing from (+) or approaching to (−) a
target which was deﬁned in GJB300 or MIL-STD-1787B.
2.2
Cognitive Tasks in Simulated Flight
2.2.1
Experimental Design
Within-subject design was adopted with 2  2 treatments in which there were 2
display formats of target range mentioned above and 2 cognitive tasks to be tested.
One extractive task was to declare the value of target range on real time, and
another integrative task was to validate the state of mission with more parameters
except target range after HUD watching by break-in technique.

Discussions
4.1
Integrated Format of Target Range with Higher
Rate of CR
It was suggested that the main effect of display formats was signiﬁcant in statistics
(F(1,150) = 6.15, P < 0.05), and no other differences were found for the index of
rate of CR (Fig. 2a), which meant integrated format of target range have a higher
rate of CR than separable format, i.e. 86.42 versus 78.81% in average.
The rates of CR were 81.79 versus 83.44% undifferentiated for extractive task
and integrative task generally in cognition.
4.2
Integrated Format of Target Range with Shorter CRT
For the index of CRT (Fig. 2b), it was found that the main effects were signiﬁcant
for
display
formats
(F(1,74) = 29.94,
P < 0.001)
and
cognitive
tasks
(F
(1,74) = 4.76, P < 0.05); the interaction effect between the two factors was also
signiﬁcant (F(1,74)=7.11, P<0.01). The integrated format of target range had a
shorter CRT than the separable format (3288 vs. 4450 ms) for the sample in present
paper.
For the cognitive tasks, the extractive task revealed some difﬁculties with longer
CRT than the integrative task (4085 vs. 3654 ms).
It was very interesting that the cognitive tasks accomplished with similar CRT in
integrated format (3283 vs. 3743 ms) (F(1,113) = 2.71, P = 0.10), but dissimilar in
separable format (5158 ms vs. 3799 ms) (F(1,95) = 26.76, P < 0.001). If the
integrated format of target range was applied in HUD information design, pilots
could cognize the cues faster for both of extractive and integrative task with
superiority to the separable format as shown in Fig. 1.

pilots on different display
formats after the test

4.3
Integrated Format of Target Range Chosen by Pilots
For the subjective ratings of usability (Fig. 3), it was found that the distributions of
pilot’s scores about integrated format were different from that of separable format
signiﬁcantly in statistics (Pearson v2 = 51.34, P < 0.001). Totally 90.76% of pilots
rated integrated format as excellent or good, while there only were 45.33% of pilots
said yes for separable format.
The pilots chose the integrated format other than the separable format as shown
in Fig. 1 as the optimal design for target range in HUD maybe because of better
performances, i.e. higher rate of CR and shorter CRT in general.
The results were supported by other’s ﬁnding of improved performance with
integrated displays compared with separated displays [7, 8].
5
Conclusions
A display format of target range was designed for HUD of aircraft by attaching a
trigon to the target designator in MIL-STD-1787B and GJB300 in which 3 of
vertices in the square box denoted Rmax1, Rmax2, and Rmin, and the moving trigon
denoted the changing target range.
An experiment was carried out to select better one from 2 display formats of
target range for HUD pictures. 2  2 within-subject experiment design was cited
with integrated format as mentioned above versus separable format of ﬁxed scale
with indicator, and extractive task versus integrative task in simulated ﬂight cog-
nitive tasks. The indices of CR and CRT were recorded in test and subjective rating
of display formats after test. Results were found that the integrated format of target
range was recognized much better and faster by 151 male pilots in performance
compared with the separable format and approved by 90.76% of participant pilots.
The integrated format of target range with trigon attached to target designator could
improve cognitive performances of target range information in HUD of aircraft in
present study.

Introduction
Now, the pursuit of fast pace and high efﬁciency in the study and work has become
an inevitable trend. Therefore, the study on the impact of efﬁciency has become a
hot research topic. The purpose of this study was to do research on the effect of
mechanical drawings’ different marked way on browse and search efﬁciency.
Many studies have explored factors that affect the efﬁciency of visual search.

Location layout has an impact on search efﬁciency. Simonin et al. [1] studied the
effects of different layouts on search efﬁciency and found that the elliptical layout
scan path was the shortest. Song [2] studied the impact of web page information
types and location on visual search. The results showed page information of ﬁgure
type had higher search efﬁciency than text type.
Information and information density have an impact on search efﬁciency.
Halverson et al. [3] found search time increased while search efﬁciency reduced
when the user searched web page with large information density. Lu [4] studied the
inﬂuence of web page information overload on visual search. It was found that the
information overload reduced user’s visual search efﬁciency, and user was more
concerned with the upper area of the page under this condition.
Information presentation has an impact on search efﬁciency. Sheng et al. [5]
found that graded presentation information can effectively improve the efﬁciency of
information search. Zhao et al. [6] found that participants can respond more quickly
and improve their search efﬁciency when the same scene layout was repeated and
the target position was ﬁxed.
The size of the information element has an impact on the search efﬁciency. Tseng
et al. [7] considered screen size, icon size, and background complexity as inde-
pendent variables to study search efﬁciency and found that large-size screens, icons,
and a simple background can improve search efﬁciency.
In the above study, the experimental materials are mainly based on web pages
and software interfaces, while existing researches lack study which uses profes-
sional drawings as stimulus object. Cheng et al. [8] have studied the impact of
articles with or without illustrations and black and white illustrations and color
illustrations on reading, but did not involve the study of pattern. Mechanical
drawings are the most widely used in drawings. Therefore, this paper chooses the
mechanical drawing as the research object and explores the effect of mechanical
drawing marked by text and digital on learning and search efﬁciency, which is
instructive for professionals to design drawings.

Experiment
2.1
Participants
Forty students (aged from 22 to 30), 28 males and 12 females, whose binocular
corrected vision or naked eyesight was normal, did not have color blind, weak
color, or other eye diseases, participated in this experiment. The participants were
randomly divided into two groups, each group of 20.

2.2
Equipment
Tobii X120 desktop eye tracker whose sampling frequency is 120 Hz was used
as laboratory apparatus, and a 23-in. LCD monitor with a refresh rate of 60 Hz and
a resolution of 1920  1080 pixels was used as the monitor in this part.
2.3
Experiment Materials
The study was designed by two factors: 2 (mechanical drawings marked by digital
and text) * 2 (two observation modes: purposeless browse and purposeful search).
A total of 20 mechanical drawings of the same level of complexity were selected
and processed into 20 * 2 illustrations with two marked ways, which ensures that
the same drawings of different styles have the same ﬁgure ontology, marked text
font, size, and word spacing, and the numbers of marked parts are all 12. Two
examples of mechanical drawings that are marked by digital and text are shown in
Fig. 1.
2.4
Experiment Design
The experiment was divided into two parts, eye-tracking experiment and the sub-
jective satisfaction test after the experiment.
Participants were divided into two groups, and each group has twenty experi-
mental materials including 6 drawings for purposeless browse experiment and 14

drawings for purposeful search experiment. Purposeless browse requires that par-
ticipants should browse the full drawing with their own reading habits and continue
to browse by pressing the space bar. In a purposeful search process, a prompt
appears on the previous page of the drawing to inform that participants should ﬁnd
the name of parts and then press the space bar to continue the experiment. Through
comparative analysis of eye-tracking data of two drawings, the effect and regularity
of them for observation and search can be obtained.
After the eye-tracking experiment, the subjective satisfaction of users was tested
by a questionnaire which was presented in a 5-point isometric form.
2.5
Data Processing
There were totally 34 effective participants, 17 in each group. The dependent
variables were the total length of ﬁxation, the total number of ﬁxation points, the
time of entering ROI for the ﬁrst time, and the number of ﬁxation points before
entering the ﬁrst time. The experiment programming and data recording were
completed by Tobii Studio Software. Eye-tracking data analysis was completed by
SPSS 19, and the satisfaction test data were analyzed by EXCEL 2007.

under the condition of digital annotation and text annotation is 32.86 and 21.63 s,
respectively. The conclusion is drawn as F = 59.698 and p < 0.05. The browse
time in the form of text direct annotation is shorter than that of digital annotation.

Discussion
4.1
The Effect of Different Marked Ways on Browse
and Search Efﬁciency
This study found the browse efﬁciency and search efﬁciency of mechanical draw-
ings that are marked by text are higher.
The results can be explained from the following two aspects: information density
and cognitive load. Halverson et al. [3] found that the search time signiﬁcantly
increased when users search for a web page with a high density of information in
the study of web page visual design, and Liu et al. [9] have veriﬁed this view. In
this study, independent variable is marked way only. The information density of
digital annotation is greater than that of text annotation. The experimental results
show that the search time of digital annotation is longer than that of text annotation.
Cognitive psychology believes that the level of cognitive load determines the
efﬁciency of the user to complete the task. The intrinsic cognitive load is caused by
the complex interaction between elements, and reducing the interaction can reduce the
intrinsic cognitive load and improve efﬁciency [10]. In this study, there are three
interactive processes during participants browse and search drawings marked by
digital while there are two interactive processes during participants browse and search
drawings marked by text. As a result, users have fewer interactive activities with
drawings marked by text and have low cognitive load and high search efﬁciency.
The questionnaire showed that participants generally felt that drawings marked
by digital were more clear, beautiful, neat, and orderly. The ﬁxation track chart
showed that participants generally chose from number 1 to start browsing drawings
marked by digital, while they had no speciﬁc browse tracks and rules when
browsing drawings marked by text, as shown in Fig. 2.

The Effect of Different Marked Ways
on Eye-Tracking Index
In view of the number of ﬁxation points, each part needs at least three ﬁxation
points: ﬁgure, digital, and text in drawings marked by digital, and each part needs at
least two ﬁxation points: ﬁgure and text in drawings marked by text. The more
ﬁxation points are needed, the longer the browse time is required.
In view of ﬁxation track, in the purposeless browse experiment, participants
generally choose from number 1 to start browsing when browsing drawings marked
by digital, with long and regular track, but participants have different habits when
browsing drawings marked by text, with short and irregular track.
In view of the hot map, the distribution area of hot spot in drawings marked by
digital is obvious, and text area is obviously larger than ﬁgure area. The distribution
of hot spot in drawings marked by text is uniform. This shows that participants pay
more attention to the key information such as text than ﬁgure (Fig. 3).

The Effect of Cognitive Load on Reading Model
The purposeful search experiment has a total of two ROIs: the text area and ﬁgure
area of the target part. The time of entering ROI for the ﬁrst time was compared.
The data totaled 280 groups. There are 154 groups of data corresponding to ﬁgure
after text having been searched, which accounts for 55%. Further analysis ﬁnds that
most participants are not familiar with mechanical drawings, and the average search
time is 3.60 s. There are 12 groups of data conﬁrming text after ﬁgure having been

searched, which accounts for 4.29%. Further analysis ﬁnds that the vast majority of
participants are familiar with mechanical drawings, and the average search time is
3.18 s. There are 47 groups of data searching ﬁgures only, which accounts for
16.79%. Further analysis ﬁnds that two of the participants are mechanical profes-
sionals after in-depth interviews. The average search time is 1.59 s. There are 67
groups of data entering no RIO, which accounts for 23.93%.
The reason for this phenomenon is that with the improvement of professional
level of learners, the intrinsic cognitive load will be reduced and the search efﬁ-
ciency will be improved.

Conclusions
Under the experimental conditions of this study, following conclusions are drawn.
Firstly, browse efﬁciency of mechanical drawings that are marked by text is higher
than marked by digital. Secondly, search efﬁciency of mechanical drawings that are
marked by text is higher than marked by digital. Thirdly, satisfaction of mechanical
drawings that are marked by digital is higher than marked by text.
There are some shortcomings and improvements of this paper. Firstly, when the
satisfaction evaluation model is established, less indicators cannot fully reﬂect the
satisfaction of participants on drawings marked by two different ways. Secondly, in
this experiment, the number of marked icons of drawings is 12, and then, we can
consider the number of marked icons as independent variables for further study.
Thirdly, in this study, text annotation is placed on the right side of the page from top
to bottom in a row in the drawings marked by digital, which is bound to have an
impact on the experimental results.

Abstract Based on self-developed information processing operation simulation
and performance test system of armored vehicle, the inﬂuences of information
perceptive modes, i.e., visual, auditory, and visual–auditory, on crew’s information
processing operation performance are analyzed by taking task completion time and
error rate as evaluation indicators. The results show that the inﬂuences of different
information perceptive modes on crew’s information processing operation perfor-
mance could be effectively discriminated by using the proposed method, and the
visual–auditory mode should be used in actual operational environment. The results

Introduction
With the wide application of vehicle-mounted display and control system in
armored vehicles, the operation type of armored vehicle crew is changed from
traditional manual work to information processing task [1]. Armored vehicle crew’s
information processing operation performance is directly related to the completion
of task and even affects the success or failure of mission. The information pro-
cessing operation performance is not only related to the cognitive ability of the
crew, but also has a close relationship to the information perception mode.
Therefore, it is necessary to study the relationship between perception mode and
information processing operation performance.

At present, scholars at home and abroad have carried out a series of researches
on the information perception mode and found that different information perception
mode will affect the operation performance. Kahneman ﬁrst proposed the
single-resource theory that when an information channel is stimulated, the infor-
mation processing resources will change accordingly. It will affect the operation
performance [2]. Zhuang established the visual information ﬂow intensity model
based on the mechanism of visual perception and analyzed the inﬂuence of visual
information quantity on the operation performance by the method of variance
analysis [3]. Wickens proposed the multiple-resource theory, which divides the
information processing resources into several channels [4]. Karen found that the
speciﬁc attention resources can be effectively activated when monitoring multiple
channels in the experiment [5]. Guo compared the operation performance of 3
perception modes and found that auditory processing perception mode has more
advantages than the other two modes.
To sum up, although the study of information perception mode has made some
achievements, it has not given a uniﬁed deﬁnition of the relationship between
perception mode and operation performance. Moreover, the existing research object
is mainly aimed at the pilot, but the research on the armored vehicle crew is rare. In
view of these, the author intends to adopt the ergonomics experiment method on the
effect of perception mode on operation performance, avoids the negative effects of
inappropriate perception mode brought on armored vehicle operation performance,
provides reference for improving the combat effectiveness of the man–machine
system.

Method
2.1
Participants
20 professional-grade tank commanders were recruited for the study (male, age
range 20–26, mean age 24). All the participants were right-handed and healthy
(without any movement disorders, normal vision or corrected vision, normal
hearing) and in a good mental state. Before the experiment, all the participants were
informed and agreed to participate in the experiment.
2.2
Experimental Setup and Equipment
The experimental system is a self-developed information processing operation
simulation and performance test system of armored vehicle. Its main function is to
provide a typical information processing simulation test environment for the crew,
and to record the crew’s operation performance (response time, error rate). The
526

system is portable and modular. The utility model can be installed on a simulation
experiment platform or a real vehicle. The system is mainly composed of the main
control terminal, the display and control terminal, the visual display, the headset,
and the simulation software, as shown in Fig. 1.
The basic hardware conﬁguration is shown in Table 1.
The simulation software is developed based on Labview 2011, which consists of
main control module, information terminal module, visual module, and data storage
module. The information terminal module interface is designed reference of a main
battle tank commander terminal interface. Visual module is created based on
Creator. The data storage module uses MySQL 2008 database management soft-
ware and Matlab R2009 to store and analyze the performance data. The modules are
connected by TCP/IP protocol.

information processing task. The task includes 4 basic operation units: type
selection, attribute judgment, target information input, and information transmis-
sion. The basic parameter settings are shown in Table 2.
In Table 2, the text presentation mode corresponds to the visual perception
mode, the speech presentation corresponds to the auditory perception mode, and the
text–speech presentation mode corresponds to the visual–auditory perception mode.
The contents of the target information are the target type (Armored transporter), the
number of targets (3), the target position (North), and the target speed (28 km/h).
The experimental scenario is shown in Fig. 2.
2.4
Experimental Process
The experimental process is divided into 2 stages. The ﬁrst stage is the training
phase. First to explain the purpose of the experiment, the basic steps and matters
need attention. In addition, participants in the system for about 5 min of task
training should be familiar with the work content. The second stage is the formal
experimental stage. First, set the condition parameters. Then, begin the formal
experiment, each mode 5 times. Finally, ﬁll in the NASA-TLX evaluation scale.

As shown in Fig. 4 and Table 3, the data obey the normal distribution
(P > 0.05). And the task completion time was increased according to the order of
auditory perception, visual–auditory perception, and visual perception. In order to
make a further analysis of the main effect of perception on task completion time,
one-way ANOVA method was used. Results showed that auditory, visual, and
visual–auditory tasks were signiﬁcantly different (P = 0.000 < 0.05). However,
there was no signiﬁcant difference between auditory and visual–auditory task
completion time (P = 0.069 > 0.05).
Figure 5 shows the operation error rate of different perceptive information

The Kolmogorov–Smirnov normal test was performed on the operation error rate
of 3 perception modes, as shown in Table 4.
As shown in Fig. 5 and Table 4, the data do not obey the normal distribution
(P < 0.05). And the operation error rate was increased according to the order of
visual–auditory perception, auditory perception, and visual perception. In order to
make a further analysis of the main effect of perception on operation error rate,
one-way ANOVA method was used. Results showed that there was no signiﬁcant
effect on the operation error rate (P = 0.105 > 0.05).

NASA-TLX Data Analysis
In this paper, the NASA-TLX scale was used to investigate the subjective feelings
of each participant under different conditions. The statistical results are shown in
Fig. 6, the average scores were 53.455, 48.124, and 45.234, and this shows that
single-channel perception needs more mental workload than multichannel.

Discussion
When the target information is presented in a text mode, the participant perceives it
with visual perception. When the text appears, the participant’s attention has been
placed on the visual display screen and then transferred to the keys. When the target
information is presented in a speech mode, the participant perceives it with auditory
perception mode. When the voice appears, the participant’s attention has been stuck
on the keys, direct operated keys. As a result, the task completion time of visual
perception mode is more than that of auditory perception mode. The error rate is
basically the same.
As the speech presentation mode has certain hysteresis, when the information is
presented in a text–speech mode, the information perception is according to the
order of visual perception mode and auditory perception mode. When text and
voice appear, participant focuses on the visual display. With the development of
speech presentation, participant will quickly shift attention to the keys, direct
operated key. Although the task completion time of visual–auditory perception
mode is the same as that of auditory perception mode theoretically, the cognitive
process will include the choice of perceptual mode. Therefore, the task completion
time is slightly longer than that of auditory perception mode, but the task com-
pletion time is much shorter than that of visual perception mode. However, due to
the multichannel, the channel will complement each other, and the operation error
rate of visual–auditory perception mode will be greatly reduced.

Conclusions
This paper makes an experimental study on the relationship between perception
mode and operation performance. The main conclusions are as follows:
• From the perspective of realizing system function, the effect of the 3 perception
modes is consistent. But from the perspective of actual combating, the auditory
perception single-channel mode is not reasonable, because the actual battleﬁeld
environment with a large number of random voice information will produce
information loss phenomenon.
• In view of the signiﬁcant differences in the task completion time and the error
rate analysis, in the actual combat environment, we should adopt the text–
speech mode to present the target information. The information should be dis-
tributed in several channels so as to avoid the superposition in the same channel.
This can improve man–machine’s work efﬁciency and reliability.
Compliance with Ethical Standards The study was approved by the Logistics Department for

and Youjun Chang
Abstract Lower extremity exoskeleton is to support the body of human and
strengthen its users exercise ability. In recent years, the safety, the comfort, and
efﬁciency to the lower extremity exoskeleton become an issue of increasing con-
cern. In order to form a better view of the evaluation of the human exoskeleton
system, not only the clinical data but also the analysis of the human gait is needed.
In this paper, we give a more complete evaluation of the AIDER (AssIstive, DEvice
for paRaplegic patient) exoskeleton based on the human gait analysis and the
subjective questionnaires.

Introduction
Lower extremity exoskeleton is a wearable mechanical device, which integrated
several sensor techniques, control techniques, information coupling techniques,
human–machine interaction technique, etc. [1]. Lower extremity exoskeleton can
support the human body and strengthen the exercise ability of its user. As research
on robotic exoskeletons has rapidly expanded over the previous decade, the com-
fort, safety, and efﬁciency of the human exoskeleton system become an important
issue. As Andre Schiele mentioned [2], one of the key problems of the exoskeleton
is lacking design requirements, guidelines, and performance analysis tools for
exoskeleton. Young and Ferris [3] also pointed that the preponderance of published
literature lacks rigorous quantitative evaluations of exoskeleton performance. In this
respect, Zeilig et al. [4] and Stephanie et al. [5] have evaluated safety and feasibility
of the exoskeleton based on clinical evaluation and questionnaire. However, in
order to form a better view of the evaluation of the human exoskeleton system, not

only the clinical evaluation but also the analysis of the human gait is needed.
Although many studies have been carried out to design control systems able to
achieve static and dynamic balance for humanoid-legged robots, the implications of
these two different modalities on kinematic and kinetic aspects have often been
overlooked [6]. In order to remedy this vacancy, this paper tries to give a more
complete evaluation of the exoskeleton. Our experiment used the AIDER(AssIstive,
DEvice for paRaplegic patient) systems and to analyze the human-machine systems
of gait parameters and the subjective questionnaires.
2
Method
2.1
Subjects
Our proposed method was based on the experiment recruited 20 volunteer partic-
ipants from a high-educated university. All participants were physically and men-
tally healthy with an average age of 22, 174 cm mean height, and an average weight
of 62 kg. These participants were grouped into two: group A, 10 people with
walking test wearing the lower extremity exoskeleton; and group B, 10 people with
walking test without wearing the lower extremity exoskeleton device. This study
has been approved by Sichuan Province 81 Rehabilitation Center Medical Ethics
Committee. All subjects have signed the informed consent.
2.2
Experiment Equipment and Material
The human movement data were captured by a Vicon motion capture system. Two
force plates (BP400600 AMTI) measured the ground reaction force. The VICON
system consists of 8 cameras and is designed to track and reconstruct these markers
in 3-dimensional space. The experiment environment consists of 8 Vantage 5
camera and 2 force plates, shown in Fig. 1.
2.3
Procedure
2.3.1
The Device (AIDER 3.2)
The AIDER 3.2 (AssIstive, DEvice for paRaplegic patient) comprised a motorized
exoskeleton, a battery unit, and a computer-based controller contained in a back-
pack, wireless crutches, and an array of sensors that measure upper-body tilt angle,
536
X. Zheng et al.

joint angles, and ground contact. The exoskeleton contains bilateral lateral uprights
for the thigh and leg and the footplate. It uses a closed-loop algorithm software
control. The motors control the movements at the hip and knee joints, but not the
ankles that are articulated using a mechanical joint with spring-assisted dorsiﬂexion.
Software design prevents rapid hip and knee ﬂexion as may occur in a fall, and
provides a controlled speed stand to sit. The suitable user of the ADIER is from 155
to 190 cm height and under 100 kg.
2.3.2
Training
The participants of group A with wearing the device were initially trained with four
actions: stand up, walking, turn to left or right, and sit down. All the 10 tested
people were trained 4 days with an average training time of 20 min a day. After the
four days’ training, every participant had used the device skillfully and can ﬁnished
the walking test easily.
2.3.3
Experiment
The experiment was divided into two groups as aforementioned. First, as for group
A, we measured the basic physical parameters, such as weight, height, length of the
leg. Then, the experimental suit was put on the experimenter and pasted some
motion capture markers, respectively. The experimenters need to ﬁnish a 40-m
(40MWT) walk test in the constructed experiment environment. The markers
position and the walking test were shown in Fig. 2. After ﬁnishing the walking test,
the experimenters were invited to ﬁnish the NASA-TLX questionnaire [7, 8].
For group B, experimenters wear the experiment suit and ﬁnish the 6-meter walk
test (6MWT) in the same experiment environment, but without the exoskeleton.

2.4
Data Collection and Analysis
The data collected in this experiment include height, weight, length of leg, sub-
jective questionnaire, movement of the markers, and the ground reaction force.
By importing the markers motion trail data and the ground reaction force data
into OpenSim3.3 to establish a human–machine model, kinematics analysis
includes gait parameters and gait cycle has been measured in the experiment. In
addition, the differences of the gait feature between two groups have been calcu-
lated by SPSS software. The t-test was used to check for signiﬁcant differences in
the gait parameters and the heart rate between two groups with the signiﬁcance
level set to 0.05.
A subjective workload was attained from the NASA-TLX questionnaire, which
has been used as a tool for workload assessment. The content of the NASA-TLX
questionnaire used in the present study includes mental demand, physical demand,
temporal demand, performance, efforts, and frustration.

Results
For group A, nine subjects ﬁnished the 40MWT with ADIER exoskeleton. Except
two subjects were skilled user of the ADIER, seven subjects ﬁnished the training
with the exoskeleton. One subject quit the test because of the personal reason. For
group B, 10 subjects ﬁnished the 6MWT.

is millimeter (mm), and the unit of the walk speed is mm/s.
From the result, the values of the gait parameters in with-exoskeleton group are
obviously lower than without-exoskeleton group. For single step length, the values
of the gait parameters with-exoskeleton or without-exoskeleton group have sig-
niﬁcant differences (t(9) = −14.745, p < 0.01). For the walk speed, the values of the
gait parameters with-exoskeleton or without-exoskeleton group have signiﬁcant
differences (t(9) = −12.138, p < 0.01); For the step width, the values of the gait
parameters with-exoskeleton or without-exoskeleton group have signiﬁcant differ-
ences (t(9) = −2.718, p < 0.05). In addition, the mean step width of the group with
exoskeleton is 159 mm, lower than the mean step width of the group without
exoskeleton (191 mm). In the gait analysis respect, lower step width means poor
stability.
3.1.2
Gait Cycle Analysis
In the normal human gait cycle, stance phase occupies 60% of the whole cycle,
swing phase occupies 40% of the cycle, and the ﬁrst double support and the second
double support occupy 20% of the whole cycle. In the human with exoskeleton gait
cycle, stance phase occupies 75% of the whole cycle, swing phase occupies 46 of

the cycle, and the ﬁrst double support and the second double support occupy 25%
of the whole cycle, as shown in Fig. 4.
From Fig. 4, we could see that when subject performing a complete gait cycle
with exoskeleton, the time of stance phase is longer; especially for the double-support
phase, it needs two times time of the subject without exoskeleton. During the
double-support phase, there are four points contact the ground when subject moving
with the exoskeleton, including left crutch, right crutch, left foot, and right foot.
During the single-limb stance phase, there are only three points contacting the ground
because one of the crutches needs to move forward. In order to maintain a balanced
position, the user intends to decrease the time of single-limb stance.

dimensions have signiﬁcant differences. In addition, the value of physical demand
is greater than other dimension of the workload.

Conclusions
In this study, the gait parameters of exoskeleton users were calculated. The users’
physiological data and the subjective assessment were quantitatively analyzed. And
all these factors were compared to the subjects walked without exoskeleton. When
walking with the exoskeleton, the values of gait parameters (single step length, step
width, and walk speed) are lower compared with the normal human without the
exoskeleton. Moreover, improving the stability of the exoskeleton is a challenge as
the step width is narrow. Based on the subjective assessment, the physical demand
of the users is high. In future, the gait features and the mechanical structure of the
AIDER need to be ameliorated to overcome the gait controlling and the high

Effects of Usability Problems on User
Emotions in Human–Computer
Interaction
Xiaojun Li, Zhongdong Xiao and Binbin Cao
Abstract A two-factor mixed design with usability problem type and severity
rating as experimental factors was conducted to examine the effects of usability
problems on user emotions. The usability problem type was varied from full
classiﬁcation (FC) in artifact component to FC in task component, and severity
rating of usability problem was varied from low to high. Difference in emotional
dimensions, valence, arousal, and dominance were realized as dependent variables.
Results showed that effects of usability problems on user emotions differed by type
and severity rating. Usability problems classiﬁed into FC in task component or with
higher severity rating led to more negative and less dominance subjective feelings.
Effect of type of usability problems on emotional valence was stronger when their
severity rating was relatively low. These investigations suggest that usability
problems classiﬁed into FC in task component or with higher severity rating should
be assigned to higher priority in usability test and be eliminated as far as possible in
the development process. Further studies may address the issue from different
construct of emotion, e.g., physiological changes.

Introduction
Emotion plays an important role and has been paid more and more attention in
human–computer interaction (HCI). The previous studies investigated the rela-
tionships between users’ emotional responses and system usability in HCI.
However, the issue still needs to be addressed, mainly due to the following reasons:

1. These studies mostly focused on the effects of perceived usability on users’
emotional responses in HCI. However, there are obvious differences between
perceived usability and situational usability employed in our study. According
to Hertzum [1], the former concerns the user’s subjective experience of a system
and the latter focuses on the quality in use of a system.
2. To our knowledge, previous research rather paid limited attention to the effects
on users’ emotional responses of usability problems in terms of types and
severity, even though investigations revealed that types and severity of usability
problems were crucial for improvement of system usability [2].
To provide further insights into the relationships between users’ emotional
responses and usability problems in terms of type and severity rating in HCI, the
present study designs two-factorial experiments to examine the effects of type and
severity rating of usability problems on different user emotional dimensions, that is,
valence, arousal, and dominance; especially, the issue is addressed in the concept
framework of situational usability rather than perceived usability.

Background and Related Work
2.1
Usability Problems
Usability is deﬁned as the quality in use of a system in a speciﬁc context of use and
can be measured in terms of effectiveness, efﬁciency, and satisfaction [3, 4]. Given
the deﬁnition of usability, usability problems are aspects of a system that may cause
weak performance, increased costs, or decreased satisfaction during HCI in a
speciﬁc context of use.
To support identifying usability problems and diagnosing the causes, various
classiﬁcation schemes of usability problems were provided. In usability problem
taxonomy [5], usability problems can be classiﬁed from the following two aspects:
artifact and task. Any problem can be classiﬁed into one of the following outcomes
along a component.
1. Full classiﬁcation (FC), it implies that a problem is classiﬁed in a subcategory in
the deepest level.
2. Partial classiﬁcation (PC), it implies that a problem is classiﬁed in either a
primary category or a non-rightmost subcategory.
3. Null classiﬁcation (NC), it implies that a problem cannot be classiﬁed in any
primary category or subcategory along a given component.
Therefore, the ﬁnal result of classiﬁcation for a problem is a pair of outcomes
that are composed of outcomes in the artifact component and task component
separately.
Besides classiﬁcation, severity rating is another important characteristic to
describe a usability problem. In sum, two types of approaches were developed to
544
X. Li et al.

estimate the severity: approaches based on data about the impact of a speciﬁc
usability problem and approaches based on judgments of stakeholders, especially
the
users
[2].
In
the
former
approaches,
measures
of
severity
include
problem-handling time, number of human errors, occurrence frequency of a
usability problem, and so on. In the latter approaches, Nielsen’s rating scale [6] is
commonly accepted in related studies. The scale is an overall assessment of each
usability problem and regards the judgment as integrated ratings on occurrence
frequency, impact, and persistence of a usability problem.
2.2
User Emotions in HCI
Emotions are conceptualized as reactions to events and resulted in the extent to
which the user’s goals or needs are facilitated or hampered by the system in HCI
[7]. And they are considered to be a multi-modal construct on the levels of phys-
iological changes and subjective evaluations [8]. So information of users’ emotional
changes in HCI can support judging whether the user’s goals are being satisﬁed and
improving the relationship between human and computer.
Besides features of design, almost all of the aspects of HCI events, i.e. the
characteristics of human, task, and environment may elicit emotional change in HCI
[9–12]. Based on the above investigations, tightly controlled conditions are nec-
essary in experiment design for related studies in HCI.
3
Methods
Two-factorial experiments were applied in our studies. Four ofﬁce information
systems were selected as tested objects. To control the effects of other HCI factors
on the dependent variables, all the tests did take place in the same laboratory under
same environmental conditions.
3.1
Participants
Forty-three individuals (all of them male, age from 21 to 23 years with a mean of
22.7 years) participated in the experiments. These participants were senior students
in Xi’an Research Inst. of Hi-Tech, China. And they were skilled in computer
applications.

Stimuli
Through application of the four systems in our design, we intend to induce different
usability problems in terms of types and severity ratings. The tested applications
and details of usability problems are shown in Table 1. And the classiﬁcations and
severity ratings of each usability problem are given by ﬁve usability experts
according to usability problem taxonomy and Nielsen’s rating scale.

3.3
Design
A two-factor mixed design with usability problem type and severity rating as
experimental factors was applied. The usability problem type, realized as the
within-subjects independent variable, was varied on two levels, either as FC in
artifact component or FC in task component. The severity rating of usability
problem, realized as the between-subjects independent variable, was also varied on
two levels, that is the rating was either low (Mean of subjective rating  2.0) or it
was relatively high (Mean of subjective rating > 2.0).
All the participants were divided into two groups randomly: 19 individuals in
group A and 24 individuals in group B. For each group, every individual was asked
to complete two tasks, that is, applications 3 and 4 (Table 1) were assigned to
individuals in group A and applications 1 and 2 (Table 1) were assigned to indi-
viduals in group B. The schema of the trial procedure for each participant is
described in Fig. 1.
To balance the potential learning effect during HCI, the order of tasks was dif-
ferent from adjacent individuals for each participant in the same group. For example,
if the order of tasks for a participant in group A is application 3 to application 4, then
the order of tasks for adjacent ones is application 4 to application 3.
3.4
Measures
Emotion measures were obtained using the Self-assessment Manikin (SAM) scale
[13]. The SAM, as a nine-point rating scale, can measure three emotional dimen-
sions: valence, arousal, and dominance (0 represents happy, high arousal, and low
dominance; 8 represents unhappy, low arousal, and high dominance). As a
non-verbal pictorial assessment technique, its reliability and validity were veriﬁed
by studies [8, 14] in the HCI domain.

Severity rating of usability problems were obtained using Nielsen’s rating scale
[6]. In the ﬁve-point rating scale, 0 shows that there was no problem and 4 shows
that there was usability catastrophe.
Considering the complexity of usability problem taxonomy, the results of
usability problem classiﬁcation directly adopted experts’ judgments as shown in
Table 1.
3.5
Procedure
The experiment was conducted separately for every participant. After the individual
arrived at the laboratory, he was informed about the contents of the experiment
brieﬂy and instructed to sign the informed consent voluntarily. And then he was
seated in front of the computer and tasked to complete the questionnaire about
emotion. The result was considered as the emotional baseline to assess whether he
was within the abnormal emotion or otherwise.
He was informed the details of application for the ﬁrst task and conﬁrmed
whether he got the instructions clearly. When these conditions were veriﬁed, the
participant was asked to complete the task in 3 min. If the duration was longer than
3 min, he was considered to have failed and asked to give up the task. So when he
completed the task or the duration exceeded 3 min, the participant was asked to
complete the Nielsen’s rating scale and the Self-assessment Manikin (SAM) scale
in turn. For the second task, the participant followed the same schema described as
above.

Results
One-way ANOVA with repeated measurements shows that the difference between
severity ratings of usability problems in applications 1 and 2 is not signiﬁcant
(p = 0.526 > 0.05). The difference between applications 3 and 4 is also not sig-
niﬁcant (p = 0.747 > 0.05). One-way ANOVA shows that the difference between
severity ratings of usability problems in applications 1 and 3 (belongs to the same
type: FC in artifact component) is signiﬁcant (p = 0.000 < 0.05). And the differ-
ence between applications 2 and 4 (belongs to the same type: FC in task compo-
nent) is also signiﬁcant (p = 0.000 < 0.05). In summary, the stimuli were effective
in the experiments.
The results show that the emotional baselines of all the participants were normal,
that is, valence < 6, arousal > 2, and 1 < dominance < 7.

Conclusion and Discussion
The outcomes of the study indicate that effects of usability problems on user
emotions differed by type and severity rating. Concretely, usability problems that
were classiﬁed into FC in task component led to more negative and less dominance
subjective feelings. Also, usability problems with higher severity ratings also
resulted in the same user emotional responses; especially, the effect of type of
usability problems on emotional valence was stronger when their severity rating
was relatively low.
On the one hand, according to Bradley and Lang [13], valence rating reﬂects
participant’s tendency to approach a HCI event, whereas unhappy reﬂects a ten-
dency to withdraw, escape, or terminate the encounter. So the results suggest that
users may be more inclined to give up the present task when usability problem of
the design belongs to FC in task component or shows more severity rating. The
interaction effect between type and severity rating of usability problems on valence
ratings suggests that the difference of user tendency to escape corresponding to
different types of usability problems may be more signiﬁcant when severity rating is
low. On the other hand, Bradley and Lang [13] deemed that high dominance was
associated with the one holding maximum control in HCI. So the results also
suggest that when a user is confronted with usability problem belonging to FC in
task component or showing higher severity rating, his/her control in the situation
may decrease. However, the present study showed that the type and severity rating
of usability problem do not affect user emotional arousal signiﬁcantly. Considering
the relationship between judgments of arousal and stimulus intensity, it seems that
the above factors do not change the intensity of usability problem as stimulus in
HCI. The features of participants would contribute to lack of statistical signiﬁcance
in the emotional arousal. Thus, all of them were skilled in computer operation and
experienced to deal with system faults or breakdowns. So they were able to calm
confronting with usability problems in HCI.
Compared with previous studies, we argue that usability problem in the concept
framework of situational usability rather than perceived usability and pay more
attention to quality in use of a system. This means, the corresponding results may
be more valuable for system design and usability improvement. However, it should
be noted that this study has examined only the effect of usability problems on user
emotions from the aspect of subjective evaluations. Notwithstanding its limitation,
this study does suggest that future investigations should pay attentions to the
relationships between usability problems and physiological changes of user
emotions.
Compliance with Ethical Standards The study was approved by the ethics committee of Xi’an
Research Institute of Hi-Tech and was carried out in accordance with the approved guidelines and
regulations. All subjects who participated in the experiment were provided with and signed an
informed consent form.

system shall pose immediate inﬂuence upon the safe and efﬁcient operation.
Scientiﬁc and reasonable MMI design may promote the operating efﬁciency, and
bring the performance of weapon system into full display. On the basis of analyzing
the type, quantity, and key contents of man–machine interaction of the air defense
ﬁre control system, and from the angle of operator’s strength, accessible ﬁeld,
visible range, and information-processing capability, this research deliberates on the
design principles of the MMI manipulator and displayer of air defense ﬁre control
system, in order to provide reliable designing standards for the industrial sector.

Use and Composition of Air Defense Fire Control
System
As the command and control center of air defense weapon system, the ﬁre control
system is employed to search and track aerial targets, resolve ﬁring data, and
control the ﬁrepower system to intercept hostile targets, which generally comprises
of radar system, photoelectric system, computer system, servo system, power
supply, communication system, hydraulic system, and control panel [1]. Operators
fulﬁll their air defense tasks by operating and controlling the aforementioned sys-
tems through the MMI of control panel.

1.2
MMI of Air Defense Fire Control System
The MMI refers to the entire interfacial environment of the operator’s working
space, namely, the control panel of the air defense ﬁre control system, mainly
including the manipulator and the displayer [2].
1.2.1
Manipulator
The manipulator refers to the device with which operators control the status of
weapon and equipment by their hands or other parts of their body. As the air
defense operation is noticeably featured by very short opportunity for combat,
manipulation of ﬁre control system ought to quick and precise, and such
hand-operated manipulators should, therefore, be prioritized as hand wheels, joy-
sticks, tracking balls, push buttons, band switches, and toggle switches and so on.
1.2.2
Displayer
The displayer is a device that transmits the information of weapon and equipment to
operators through their sense organ, which falls into 2 categories—displayer for
visual sense and displayer for audio sense.
The displayer for visual sense refers to the interface with which operators obtain
machine information through their visual sense. It is suitable for complex infor-
mation and ﬁgure or graph signals transmission, and the transmitted information is
timely and may remain as long time as needed, which is convenient obtain.
Displayer for visual sense of the air defense ﬁre control system includes PPI, TV,
meter, and indicator of various kinds.
The displayer for audio sense transmits information fast. It is comparatively
more cautionary and is suitable for information transmission when visual sense is
blocked as it may immediately arouse the attention of operators. Displayer for audio
sense includes alarming device and voice transmission device.

target searching period, operators focus on how many batches of targets there are in
554
H. Chang et al.

the operational airﬁeld, what azimuth and range are regarding each target, and
which target poses greatest threat; in target tracking period, such information as the
target’s slant range, azimuth and elevation, altitude and speed, as well as the
preparation of ﬁrepower units should be paid enough attention to, since they are
relevant with the selection of the moment to ﬁre.
2.1.2
Equipment Status Information
Equipment status information includes the information of equipment operation and
that of equipment failure. Information of equipment operation includes voltage,
current intensity, and system working mode, which should be monitored by
operators at any time so as to ensure the correct operation on the ﬁre control system.
There should be necessary information when the ﬁre control system malfunctions in
order that operators locate the trouble as soon as possible.
2.1.3
Equipment Parameters Information
Operators ought to conﬁgure the parameters of the ﬁre control system according to
the battle space environment so that the ﬁre control system search and track targets
precisely, such as STC, CFAR, working frequency, and repetition frequency. The
ﬁre control system needs as well to input such information as meteorological
parameters, gun baseline, and ﬁrepower system parameters.
2.2
Operation Procedure
2.2.1
Combat Preparation Stage
After booting up, the air defense ﬁre control system automatically undertakes
computer self-checking and completes the computer initiation. With the testing
program, operators determine the working status of the system, and send various
operation directives to the system and complete the initiation of the parameters of
the ﬁre control system through man–machine interaction.
2.2.2
Target Searching Period
When fulﬁlling air defense combat tasks, the air defense weapon system needs
beforehand to conduct air search. The ﬁre control system is usually equipped with
various sensors, and operators may realize target searching through radar system,
photoelectric system, and intelligence command system. The aforementioned
operations must be done via the radar displayer or photoelectric displayer on the
control panel.

2.2.3
Target Tracking Period and Firing Period
Upon ﬁnding aerial targets, operators need to select target/targets in accordance
with the threat of the target/targets, or directives from higher echelon. When the ﬁre
control system has spotted aerial targets, operators need to judge friends from foes:
If the target is a friendly aircraft, the FRIEND indicator shall be on and operators
are reminded not to open ﬁre. During the process of tracking, operators may adopt
various countermeasures against enemy electronic jamming and switch tracking
modes amongst radar, TV, and joystick tracking so as to ensure the stability of
target tracking. Operators may press the button to open ﬁre and control guns to ﬁre
at corresponding target when the OPEN FIRE indicator is on.

Principles of Air Defense Fire Control
System MMI Design
The basic principle of air defense ﬁre control system MMI design is the adaptability
for operators and operation tasks. The design should not exceed the strength,
accessible ﬁeld, visible range, and information-processing capability of operators,
and at the same time, safety and maintainability should be taken into account as
well [3]. There are usually 2 operators for the control panel of air defense ﬁre
control system, so enough attention should be paid to the grouping of manipulators
and displayers in order to improve the operation efﬁciency.
3.1
Design of Manipulators
3.1.1
Designing Principles
• Comfortable body gesture to lessen operators’ fatigue. For instance, important
manipulators should be mounted at such suitable position as the horizontal
surface so that operators’ arms are properly supported.
• Different shape, size, color, and position for different manipulators. Operation of
manipulators should be coordinated with corresponding displayers.
• Suitable force, direction, speed, travel, and accuracy of manipulators operation
adapted to human force and motion output characteristics.
• Multi-function manipulator with indicator so that manipulation and display
could be integrated.
556
H. Chang et al.

3.1.2
Conﬁguration Requirement
• Manipulators should be conﬁgured in accordance with the importance, fre-
quency of use, and manipulation sequence [4].
• Manipulators should be arranged within the reach of upper limbs of operators;
those important and often-used should be there easy to reach; those frequently
used should be in the best area, i.e., on the lower side and right side of the
displayer, so as to prevent operators’ arms from blocking their sight. For
example, arrange the joystick on the lower side of the TV, buttons for other
tracking modes on the right side of the joystick. Since air defense ﬁre control
system currently adopts a search-track-integration mode, a tracking ball has
taken the place of hand wheels of azimuth, elevation, and range. Based on the
fact the ﬁre control system intercepts targets by means of radar allocation, the
RADAR ALLOCATION button shall obviously be arranged on the left side of
the tracking ball.
• Manipulators of related functions should be arranged together, and sequential
buttons should be arranged from left to right or from top to bottom. Frame them
if manipulators are arranged in group for the convenience of recognition.
• Manipulators should be arranged in the sagittal plane, not excess 40 mm on the
left and right sides.
3.2
Design of Displayers
3.2.1
Designing Principles
• Type and amount of signal and displayer should comply with the characteristics
of information.
• Signal should be distinct and easy to recognize.
• Use digital displayer for quantitative information to avoid error of analog
display.
3.2.2
Conﬁguration Requirement
• PPI and TV are the main displayers of air defense ﬁre control system. In order
that operators recognize information clearly, PPI and TV should be conﬁgured
around the center of their LOS, while keeping the screen slightly upward,
leaving the included angle between the axis of the screen and the horizontal line
at about 15°–20°.
Research of the Air Defense Fire Control System …
557

• Arrange the indicators for important information in the upper left periphery of
vision of operators. The motion of human eyesight is of regular pattern, namely,
from left to right and from top to bottom, the observation effect of the upper left
area is, therefore, the best, if given equal deﬂection distance, when the eyes
diverges from the center of FOV [5].
• Distinguish indicators with various colors to reduce operation mistakes, promote
the competency of information acquisition, and improve operators’ working
efﬁciency. For example, use red color for such important indicators as FIRE and
FRIEND, not only to increase the attention of operators, but to be easily
recognized.
• Audio sense is faster in receiving and processing information than visual sense.
Audio signal may transmit information no matter what operators are monitoring,
and it can thus be employed as alarm. For instance, use both indicator and alarm
to remind operators of anti-radiation missile detection so that corresponding
measures could be taken as quickly as possible.

Conclusions
With the development of science and technology, the air defense ﬁre control system
is evolving rapidly, and the optimization of its MMI design becomes increasingly
important. In order to improve the combat efﬁciency of air defense ﬁre control
system, this paper employs the thoughts and methods of man–machine–environ-
ment engineering theory to analyze the man–machine interfaces and puts forward
scientiﬁc principles of air defense ﬁre control system MMI design on the basis of
grasping the characteristics and summarizing previous experiences and lessons.

Subjective Evaluation Index for MMI as a Whole
The function realization of air defense weapon system is related not only to com-
ponent design, but also to the congruence between the arrangement and combi-
nation of displayers and manipulators and the operators’ anticipation. The
subjective evaluation index for MMI as a whole refers to the overall evaluation of
the combination effect of displayer and manipulators as well as the control panel, as
is shown in Table 4.

Analytic Hierarchy Process Method
The analytic hierarchy process method is mainly adopted to solve multi-attribute
and multi-index decision-making problems, which divides complex problems into
several hierarchies, introduces a scale of importance from 1 to 9, and quantiﬁes the
judgment of importance of various inﬂuencing factors through pairwise compari-
son. The AHP method ensures the continuance and consistence of judgment process
by means of consistency check of judgment matrix, therefore preventing illogical
judgment and realizing objective description of the weight of evaluation items [5].

Human–Machine Interface Design
of Metal Detector Based on SPI
Jun Shen, Rui Yan and Chuan Wang
Abstract According to the problem of the human–machine interface design from
metal detector, human machine interface display system of metal detector has been
designed in this paper, which uses SPI communication protocol as the core. Point of
this paper is the study of the communication protocol SPI between metal locator
DSP and MCU. Hardware circuit and software design of the human machine
interface system have been studied. In the existence of mineral, the system circuit is
veriﬁed. The experiment indicates that the MCU can accurately read data which are
sent from DSP by SPI protocol, meanwhile turn the data into Chinese characters,
thus displaying them on the LCD screen when the DSP is running at high speed;
besides, it is also proved that the system can not only detect percent of metal in the
mineral, the accurateness and the anti-interference performance is also high, the
result reach the expected goals.

Preface
In the mining industry, metal detector works in a bad environment. In addition to
the existence of large power consumption, inconvenient installation, and low sen-
sitivity of the shortcomings, the man–machine interface is also a very signiﬁcant
issue [1]. An excellent man–machine interface can prevent the false warning of
detector and improve the efﬁciency of metal detector [2]. The traditional mining
metal detector’s man–machine interface directly transmits data to each display chip
through the DSP, not considered as a separate system. Therefore, it is easy to be
affected by DSP, with shortcomings like poor anti-interference ability and possible

malfunction [3]. Metal detector’s man–machine interface is an area of mutual
inﬂuence between people and detector, and the information communications
between nature and metal detector are in the scope of human–machine interface [4].
At present, the demand of metal detector’s man–machine interface in China is
indeed very huge. However, China is not the market with the highest sales of man–
machine interface products, because the low-end intelligent man–machine interface
is becoming the mainstream of society and occupying a considerable share in the
market. Non-intelligent metal detector’s man–machine interface does not have a
strong advantage.
In this paper, the author has designed a man–machine interface control system
for metal detectors suitable for Industrial and mining industry. The hardware and
software of the system are designed with the serial peripheral interface
(SPI) protocol and single-chip control. The system can not only detect the existence
of metal and improve the anti-interference ability without false warning, but also to
a large extent reduce the complexity of the design and reduce the number of
peripheral devices used.

Metal Detector System
1.1
System Block Diagram
The metal detector is used to detect the waste metal present in the bulk material
conveyed on the conveyor belt. The discarded metal detected can be mechanically
or automatically removed from the process ﬂow by mechanical means [5]. Metal
detector device consists of two parts: a bracket and a controller. The bracket is used
to install the receiving coil and the transmitting coil, while the controller is the core
part of the whole device, and the microcontroller is the single chip and DSP. The
system of metal detector is shown in Fig. 1.
1.2
SPI Protocol
SPI is a synchronous serial interface technology that works in master-slave mode.
The core of the system of a metal detector includes two parts: a DSP and a
microcontroller, DSP and microcontroller SPI protocol to rely on communication.
The DSP acts as a host, and the microcontroller acts as a slave. SPI’s master device
DSP controls data transmission by providing a clock signal with enable strobe
signals, and the system can directly pull the enable strobe signal into low level. The
communication between the DSP and the microcontroller is determined by the
clock signal SCLK, so the microcontroller remains active. The hardware wiring of
SPI protocol DSP and microcontroller between is shown in Fig. 2.

J. Shen et al.

Work process of metal detector system SPI: The host DSP write the information
to be sent to SPI-sent data register DXR through the MOSI pin while starting the
sending process of the DSP host and transferring the information to be sent under
the control of the synchronic clock SCLK to the receiving pin RXD of the
microcontroller one by one. When the RXD transfer is completed, an interrupt ﬂag
is set to notify the DSP of completion of information sending.
With the beat of synchronous clock SCLK, the slave microcontroller will
transfer the data received by the displacement register SBUF to receiving buffer
register one by one to move and copy the data to the receiving buffer register. When
a complete data block is received, an interrupt ﬂag is set to inform the slave
microcontroller of the completion of receiving of the information block.

SPI Protocol Flowchart
The microprocessor in the metal detector system is a slave of host computer DSP,
receiving data from DSP through the SPI. The data receiving process of SPI in
interruption model are shown in Fig. 3.

Man–Machine Interface System Software Flowchart
During the design of metal detector man–machine interface system, the use of
modular design is conducive to development and clear programming thinking. The
system development software is keil uVision4, and programming language is C
language. DSP controls LCD and LEP indicator by data transmission by SPI to the
man–machine interface controller. Metal detector man–machine interface system
software ﬂowchart is shown in Fig. 4.

Experimental Results
The results show that the SPI communication protocol enables the DSP to be well
integrated with the microcontroller and the metal detector man–machine interface
system can accurately detect the presence of two metal impurities in the ore when
the metal detector device is in operation.

Contrastive Veriﬁcation
In practices, the detection precision of the metal detector does not have to reach the
millimeter level and centimeter level is okay. Iron ore is used as background in the
actual applications, so the metal impurities to be detected are simulated with small
metal balls. The distance between the launch panel and the receiving panel is
adjustable (40–80 cm), so the distance between them is 50, 60, 70 cm, respectively,
and the sensitivity of the metal detector is 5 here.
When using a small iron ball with radius of 1.5, 2.0, or 3.0 cm goes through the
central of the detection area at even speed (which shall be consistent with the
numerical value set for the detector), the highest of iron ball from the receiving
panel is 15 cm. 50 tests are made in each case.
(1) With less interference in the outside (without iron ore background and con-
veyor belt), Table 1 is the conditions of omission of the system designed in this
paper and the conditions of omission of the traditional man–machine interface
system.
Table 1 shows, in the case of minor external interference (without iron ore
background and conveyor belt), there is no omission of system designed herein,
while there is 1 omission for the traditional man–machine interface system.

The experiments made in the two phases show man–machine interface system
designed in this paper is able to not only detect the number of metal items, but also
resist interference. There is no omission of system designed herein regardless of the
existence of metal ore.

Conclusion
The metal detector man–machine interface system designed in this paper takes the
STC12C5A60S2 chip of the microcontroller as the controlling chip and uses a
128  64 LCD screen as display chip so as to design a fully functional man–
machine interface system.
(1) SPI protocol communications are adopted between the microcontroller and
DSP. When DSP is in high-speed operation, the microcontroller can accurately
read the data sent by the host DSP through the SPI protocol and translate the
data into Chinese information displayed in the man–machine interface of the
metal detector in a very short period.
(2) The metal detector device can detect the metal balls with diameter no less than
1.5 cm with the man–machine interface system designed herein, and in the case
of strong interference, the system will not have omission or false warning. This
system is veriﬁed for its high precision, stability, and reliability during the
detection process.

Abstract Objective To study the color coding requirements of displayed infor-
mation in see-through displays during aeromarine ﬁght. Methods One hundred and
ﬁfteen ﬁghter pilots participated in the experiment. In virtue of color coding
experimental procedure for see-through displays information in ﬁghters, pilots
selected colors for the display elements in the route and combat ﬂight menu. Results
(1) The pilots’ color coding requirements of ﬂight course menu were that green was
the main color, longtime displayed and normal information was inclined to be
green, dangerous and overrun information was inclined to be red, and latent dan-
gerous and needing pilots’ attention information was inclined to be yellow. (2) The
pilots’ color coding requirements of combat menu were that green was the main
color, longtime displayed and attackable information was inclined to be green, and
unattackable and overrun information was inclined to be red. Conclusions The
pilots’ color coding requirements for see-through displays in aeromarine ﬂight were
that green was the main color; longtime displayed and normal and attackable
information was inclined to be green; dangerous, overrun, and unattackable
information was inclined to be red; latent dangerous and needing pilots’ attention
information was inclined to be yellow. Above conclusions were only primary, and
subjective and objective researches should be conducted later, so as to deeply verify
the rationality of pilots’ requirements.

Introduction
With the development and progress of display control technology, see-through
displays (such as head-up display and helmet-mounted display) get more and more
applications in aircraft. The pilot obtains various information contents from these
displays to complete various operation and training tasks. Due to the display ability
of images, the traditional see-through display is mainly for the monochrome (green)
display, on which all information is displayed as the same color, while the colorful
display can effectively improve the performance of search and recognition tasks;
when a kind of information needs to be quickly located, the color is effective more
than the shape, size, letter or number [1] so as to minimize cognitive load and
response time of the display [2]. Some scholars have found that the weapons
symbol with color coding in the lmet-mounted display has obvious advantages [3].
Therefore, the colorization of information on the see-through display will be a
major design trend after the technological progress of the display.
Flying over the sea is the inevitable environment for a pilot to complete aero-
marine missions. Through the study of the experience in using traditional head-up
display, pilots generally complain that, due to the special color of the seawater, it is
difﬁcult to identify the pure green information in a head-up display, especially for
warning and threatening information which more need color coding. In the infor-
mation display of future of new see-through displays, it is possible to achieve color
coding, which will be able to overcome the monochrome display which can be
limited to using the shape, size, location, and other coding methods [4], and it will
improve the pilots’ ability to obtain information. There have been studies found that
weapons symbols using color coding make the pilot’s combat performance sig-
niﬁcantly enhanced [3]. But for a new type of see-through display with color coded
display capability, for the special ﬂight environment on the sea, with regard to
which information needs color display and what kind of color coding is used, there
are no relevant standards and norms. To this end, this study carries out color coding
study for the see-through display over the sea to learn about the speciﬁc
Requirements of pilots and provide reference of color design of information of
see-through display in the future.

Method
2.1
Test Devices and Method
2.1.1
Task Design
In this study, two typical display menus of aircraft information were the experi-
mental materials—route ﬂight menu and combat menu. The route ﬂight menu
included nine categories of display elements and the combat one included ten
576
D. Xiong et al.

categories of display elements by taking sea simulation image as the background.
The pilot experimental procedure was programed. The pilots were required to use
their own ﬂight experience to designate the best color for various display elements
of the two display menus including seven ﬁxed colors and custom colors. The seven
colors included red, green, blue, white, amber, magenta, cyan, and yellow; the
custom color is freely selected by the pilot when the pilot thought that the display
elements could not be displayed with these ﬁxed colors.
2.1.2
Test Materials and Devices
2:1:2:1
A set of see-through display information color coding experimental pro-
cedure was used. The procedure included four modules: ①background
information module, collecting the subject background information; ②
practice module, providing subjects with similar exercise tasks to the
formal test to enable them to be familiar with the test tasks and the entire
test process; ③test module, containing route ﬂight menu (nine categories
of display elements) and combat menu (ten categories of display elements)
dynamic simulation procedure; and ④data management module which
will record, store, and export the test data.
2:1:2:2
Three sets of notebook computers (one of which is the server of the
experimental procedure and two for the pilot experiment ﬂats) and 3
mouses.
2.2
Experiment Methods and Steps
The experiment form is man–machine dialogue. Subjects ﬁrst ﬁll in the background
information in the experimental procedure and then enter the exercise to be familiar
with the entire experimental method, the form of tasks and precautions. After the
completion of the exercise, they would enter the formal experiment phase to achieve
the mission of selecting color for each display element in two dynamic menus.
The experimental procedure automatically recorded the values of the colors R,
G, and B selected by each subject for each type of display element.
2.3
Experimental Subjects
The subjects included 115 male ﬁghter pilots within 32.09 ± 5.72 years old with
eyesight better than 0.8 and without color blindness.

Statistical Analysis
SPSS16.0 software was used to statistically analyze the experimental data. The
values of the R, G, and B of each display element were identiﬁed as a certain color
as a whole. The number of pilots who had selected certain color for every element
was a statistical indicator of the experimental results.

Results and Analysis
3.1
Results of Color Selection for Various Categories
of Display Elements of Route Flight Menu
For the route ﬂight menu, according to the statistics of the number of the pilots who
selected the best color for each category of display element, the results were shown
in Table 1.
Among the nine categories of display elements in Table 1, categories 1–6
and 8–9 belonged to longtime displayed information, and only category 7 belonged
to unlong-time displayed information that appeared in route ﬂight. For those who
have longtime displayed normal information, the number of pilots choosing green
was clearly dominant; with regard to the dangerous and over-limit information, the
number of pilots choosing red was clearly dominant; as to the information between
normal display and over-limit display with the potential danger which requires the
pilots to pay attention, the number of pilots choosing yellow was clearly dominant.
In above table, in addition to the green as the ﬁrst choice of most of pilots in
displayed information, there were several colors favored and chosen by a large
proportion of pilots.
According to this, it could be initially considered in the sea background and
conditions, and the pilot group had such requirements on the color coding of route
ﬂight menu elements of the see-through display: Green was the main color and
favored for longtime displayed normal information, red for over-limit information,
and yellow for information with the potential danger which required the pilots to
pay attention.

Among the ten categories of display elements in Table 2, categories 1–6 and 9–
10 belonged to longtime displayed information, and only categories 7–8 belonged
to unlong-time displayed information that appeared in combat conditions. For
normal information and attackable information, the number of pilots choosing green
was clearly dominant; with regard to unattackable information 1 and over-limit
information, the number of pilots choosing red was clearly dominant; as to the
unattackable information, the number of pilots choosing red or green equaled to the
number choosing yellow.
In above table, in addition to the green as the ﬁrst choice of most of pilots in
displayed information, there were several colors favored and chosen by a large
proportion of pilots.
According to this, it could be initially considered in the sea background and
conditions, and the pilot group had such requirements on the color coding of
combat menu elements of the see-through display: Green was the main color and
favored for longtime displayed normal and attackable information and red for
unattackable and over-limit information.

Conclusion
This study mainly investigated in the color coding requirements of the pilots on
the color coding of typical display elements of the see-through display based on the
background of the sea ﬂight, to provide reference for the color design of the
information. The route ﬂight menu and the combat menu, which are dynamically
displayed in the simulated sea background, had been designed in the experiment,
and the subjects are required to choose the best coding color for each category of
display elements in the menu.
The results of the experimental study may draw following conclusions: In sea
background conditions, green should be main color of the menu, and green is
preferred for longtime displayed normal information and attackable information;
red for the unlong displayed speciﬁc information with danger, unattackable infor-
mation, and over-limit information; and yellow for the information with the
potential danger, which requires the pilots to pay attention.
It should be noted that this study used only the subjective color selection by the
pilots and does not consider the objective effect of the color arrangement of the
menu, so above conclusion is only a preliminary one. Subsequent studies will be
carried out by combination of objective method and subjective method to further
validate the rationality of the requirements of the pilots as a whole.
Compliance with Ethical Standards The study had obtained approval from the State Key
Laboratory of NBC Protection for Civilian Ethics Committee.
Each pilot was briefed on the aims of the study, and his consent was obtained. All pilots were
paid ¥100/hr. for their participation.
All relevant ethical safeguards had been met in relation to subject protection.

Experimental Research on the Effects
of Noise on the Crew’s Reliability
in Information Processing
Weiping Liu, Bo Yang and Zheng Zhang
Abstract To explore the relationship between noise and the reliability of crew’s
work, a two-task experiment was conducted, based on the theory of Irrelevant
Sound Effect (ISE), in which 40 participants (classiﬁed into three noise groups and
one control group) performed representative information processing tasks in dif-
ferent noise environments. The time to complete tasks and the error rates of every
participant in different groups were evaluated, respectively. In the experiments, the
time and error rates of subjects’ tasks in the three noise groups are higher than those
of the control group. The result indicated that noise affected the reliability of crew’
work obviously. As noise loudness increased, there was an increase in time and
error rate completing tasks and they are also higher than those of the subjects’ tasks
in the control group, which could provide a reference for further human reliability
study.

Introduction
Human reliability refers to a manipulator’s capability of completing given tasks in
the set condition and the shortest time [1]. It is rapidly becoming essential for man–
machine systems. Due to the complexity of armored vehicle system, the inﬂuencing
factors of the Crew’s reliability are various. Noise as one of the signiﬁcant envi-
ronmental factors tends to be the focus of ergonomic study.
More than a hundred studies have shown the relationship between noise and
human performance; methodology in fuzzy mathematics can be used to deﬁne
manipulator’s annoyance of noise [2]. An ergonomic study of industrial noise

illustrates that noise has an obvious effect on human work efﬁciency and memory
[3]. However, there are researches differed from former studies [4, 5].
The purpose of this research was to investigate the effect of noise in armored
vehicle cockpit on crew’s reliability of information processing. Results from this
study will provide a reference for further improving crew’s reliability.

Method
2.1
Participants
Forty male students (age range 20–25, mean age = 21.4, S.D. = 1.9 years) were
selected from a military college. All participants were right-handed and passed the
physical examination. They did not have the experience of in-vehicle information
terminal manipulating. Before the experiment, there was a 1-hour training to enable
them to manipulate the terminal. Then, they were classiﬁed into three noise groups
[namely, 70 dB(A), 80 dB(A) and 90 dB(A)] and a control group randomly and
equally.
2.2
Experimental Setup and Equipment
The experiment was performed in a simulating armored vehicle cockpit where the
background noise ranged from 37 dB(A) to 41 dB(A). The experimental platform
was the ergonomic Experiment Platform of Armored Information System, which
had the functions from subject registration to task selection to parameter setting to
data storage. The equipment of noise storage and noise output were a laptop
computer (ENOVO S41-70) and a headphones (EDIFIER K800). Before the
experiment, noise from one type of armored vehicle was collected and stored into
the laptop computer as a wav. Auto ﬁle. During the experiment, participants from
three noise groups and the control group were asked to wear headphones playing
either 70 dB(A) noise, 80 dB(A) noise, 90 dB(A) noise, or nothing at all.
2.3
Procedure
Prior to the experiment, subjects were trained to use the platform to perform two
experimental tasks until their error rate and time to complete tasks were steady.
During the experiment, the subjects in three noise groups and the control group
were exposed to the 70 dB(A), 80 dB(A), 90 dB(A) noise environment and natural
background condition. After the experimental parameters were set and the noise
586

signals were adjusted already, subjects had to perform 10 times of the information
entering task and 10 times of the message transmittal task, respectively. After
conducted the experimental task, subjects were asked to complete a questionnaire,
which included the effect of noise on the individual’s information perception,
attention requirements, manipulation speed, manipulation accuracy, and degree of
fatigue.
2.4
Variables
Independent variables were noise loudness [70 dB(A) noise, 80 dB(A) noise,
90 dB(A) noise and a control group]. Dependent variables included the time to
complete two tasks and the error rate.
2.4.1
Time to Complete Tasks
The amount of time a subject used to complete each task was collected. A task
started when the subject hit the “F1” or “F2” button after he or she saw the
prompting information and ended when the subject hit the “Done” button; time to
complete a task can be deﬁned as follows:
T ¼

In the above formula, Tj represents the mean of time the jth subject used to
complete two tasks, respectively; n represents the total number of subjects.

Results
Prior to statistical analyses, data from four subjects were removed because they did
not perform tasks completely. Variance analysis was used to examine the signiﬁcant
difference of experimental data among subjects’ indifferent groups. The signiﬁcance
level was set at p < 0.05 for all statistical tests.
3.1
Time to Complete Tasks
Time to complete two tasks of subjects in three noise groups and the control group
was signiﬁcantly different (Table 1, Fig. 1).

Time to complete two tasks of subjects in three noise groups was signiﬁcantly
higher than that of subjects in the control group. Also subjects in noise group 1
spent less time to complete tasks compared with subjects in noise group 2 and noise
group 3. The results of variance analysis indicated that time to complete tasks was
signiﬁcantly affected by noise loudness (P = 0.010 < 0.05) and task type
(P = 0.000 < 0.05), while there was no remarkable interaction between noise
loudness and task type (P = 0.63 > 0.05).

Discussion
The main source of noise in armored vehicle cockpit is from engines. During
information processing, noise could affect the physical health of crew and cause
weariness. By analyzing the feature of two representative information processing
tasks, It could be concluded that both of the information entering task and message
transmittal task included a series of cognitive process, which meant a large amount
of attention, memory, and reaction capacity were needed. The results of objective
experiment and subjective assessment indicated that subjects’ ability of judgment,
veracity, and speed of manipulating would decrease in noise condition, which
worsened the reliability of man–machine systems. The present experimental results
are consistent with Saeki’s study [6].
5
Conclusion
With this experiment, we were able to show that classifying subjects into different
groups and conducting representative tasks were valid methodology to explore the
effects of noise on the crew’s reliability. The results indicated that the error rate and
time to complete tasks of subjects appeared to have an upward trend with the
increase in noise loudness, which reduced crew’s reliability of in In-vehicle
information terminal manipulating. Thus, it is essential to focus on the improve-
ment in armored vehicle engines and noise precaution for armored vehicle crew
during information processing.
Compliance with Ethical Standards The study was approved by the Logistics Department for
Civilian Ethics Committee of AAFE.
All subjects who participated in the experiment were provided with and signed an informed
consent form.
All relevant ethical safeguards have been met with regard to subject protection.

Effects of Transcranial Micro-electric
Current Physiological Training
on Polysonograme Under Altitude
Hypoxia
Yongsheng Chen and Dawei Tian
Abstract Objective To investigate the effects of transcranial micro-electric current
physiological training (TMCPT) on polysomnograme (PSG) in order to provide
technology and methods for maintaining and training cerebral function (CF) under
altitude hypoxia. Methods Forty healthy volunteers served as subjects, who trained
by TMCPT in the condition of altitude hypoxia (3700 m above sea level). Current
intensity of TMCPT was limited within safety physiological band. Subjects were
trained 1 times per day (before going to bed) and lasted 5 min. PSG were observed
in resident phase (time lasted 3 month at least) Pittsburgh sleep quality index were
investigated to evaluate the sleep quality. Results Compare to the results of
pre-TMCPT, actual sleep time of PSG increased, sleep latency decreased, sleep
efﬁciency improved signiﬁcantly (F = 15.43–34.75, P < 0.05). S2%, S3+4% and
REM% of sleep construction in PSG increased but S1% decreased (F = 12.59–
14.57, P < 0.05). Subjects’ sleep quality indexes had signiﬁcant reduction as
compared with those in pre-resident phase. Conclusions TMCPT can improve sleep
quality under altitude hypoxia.

Introduction
The adverse inﬂuence of hypoxia on the brain function was very signiﬁcant, such as
headache, insomnia, etc. Oxygen inhalation or taking the medicine improving the
oxygen metabolic capability of brain cells could resist the inﬂuence of these adverse
factors, but were proven to display the function indirectly. The transcranial
micro-electric current physiological training (TMCPT) directly introduced the
micro-electric current (the strength was the microampere level, lV) into the brain

through the scalp surface electrode in the simulated brain wave way so as to
physically interfere and adjust the central nervous system. The adjustment function
could improve sleep [1–13]. The study observed the characteristics of the inﬂuence
of TMCPT on the altitude permanent residents’ EEG during sleep so as to provide
technical means for guaranteeing the altitude encamping training.

Subject and Method
2.1
Subject
40 health volunteers who were 18–40 years old and the average age was
(28.5 ± 10.4) years old. They were healthy and passed the physical examination,
and didn’t have the medical or drug history of the neuropsychiatry system. They
worked and rested according to the army schedule, slept regularly and didn’t have
abnormal sleep or altitude living history.
2.2
Method
2.2.1
Equipment for Brain Function Training
The medical electronic stimulator (BT701 type, Shanghai Huayi Medical
Instrument Co., Ltd) was used for TMCPT. The stimulator could output the
asymmetric bidirectional pulse continuous wave, and had the simulated full-brain
wave frequency. Four brain wave frequency band were included as follows:
d frequency band 1–3.8 Hz, h frequency band 4–7.8 Hz, a frequency band
8–12.8 Hz (slow a1 frequency band 8–9.8 Hz, fast a2 frequency band 10–12.8 Hz)
and b frequency band 14–30 Hz. The stimulator frequency band was 0–40 Hz, and
it could be continuously adjusted [14–16].
2.2.2
EEG Monitoring
2:2:2:1
Sleep EEG monitoring assessment system [17]: the AponeScreen-type
sleep EEG monitor was used for the all-night-long sleep monitoring of the
volunteers after TMCPT training. Sleep progress indexes: wakefulness
time, sleep latent time, actual sleep and sleep efﬁciency. Sleep structure
indexes: sleep percentage of the ﬁrst stage (S1%), sleep percentage of the
second stage (S2%), sleep percentages of the third and fourth stages
(S3+4%), and REM sleep percentage (REM%).

2:2:2:2
Assessment for sleep quality: the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI)
was used for assessing the sleep quality of the altitude permanent residents
after TMCPT training. It included subjective sleep quality, (SSQ), sleep
latency (SL), sleep duration (SDu), sleep efﬁciency (SE), sleep difﬁculty
(SDi), using of sleep medicine (USM) and disfunction in day (DD). Each
item was marked as 0, 1, 2 and 3, and the total point band was 0–21 marks.
The higher the score was, the lower the sleep quality was [1].
2.2.3
Training Method
Based on the principle that the brain waves were mainly in the a frequency band
after the brain went into the sleep status, the simulated a frequency band was at
night for training [16], and the stimulation of the micro-electronic current was
extremely low (<1 mA physical safety band, the general safety requirements of
medical appliance equipment was carried out [18]). The double-channel electrode
(each channel included one positive electrode and one negative electrode) was used
for the physical training to the frontal part (Fp1, Fp2) and occipitalia (01, 02) of the
brain. The training was carried out on 22:30 every night and lasted for 5 min. The
all-night-long sleep EEG monitoring was carried out at the night after training, and
one time of sleep quality assessment was carried out respectively before and after
the training.

Statistics Processing
SPSS 14.0 statistics software was used for data analysis. The test data were shown
by (x ± s) for the variance analysis of self-control and repeated measurement. The
scheffe method was used for checking in different stages, and the statistics signif-
icance was available when P < 0.05 was the difference.

Discussion
TMCPT introduced the simulated brain waves into the brain according to the
principle of the micro-electronic current stimulation technology so as to reinforce
and keep the brain function, promote the sleep and improve the cognitive ability.
The instrument adjusted the brain function status by simulating the brain waves of
different frequencies, e.g., the brain wave frequency in the completely awakening
status was >13 Hz (b frequency band) as well as 8–9.8 Hz spindle wave (slow a
frequency band) or 4–7.8 Hz (h frequency band) and 1–3.8 Hz slow wave
(d frequency band) after entering the sleep status. the EEG biological feedback
training had more than 30 years of application history in the neuropsychiatric ﬁeld
and the neuropsychology ﬁeld, and was mainly used for the EEG feedback therapy
of anxiety, nervous and children attention deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder.
5.1
The a Frequency Band Brain Wave Feedback Training
Promoted Sleep
Indicated by the sleep medical study, when people was sleepy or felt asleep, the a
frequency would be slower, and converted to the slow wave (h frequency band
4–7.8 Hz), and after falling asleep, the slower rhymes (d frequency band 1–3.8 Hz)

dominated. The study trained the volunteers under the training condition of the
simulated a frequency and the duration of 5 min everyday, and used the TMCPT
for adjusting the intracranial sleep regulating center to improve the sleep. Study
indicated the low-frequency alternating electric ﬁeld acted on the speciﬁc part of
the brain and comprehensively adjusted the exciting and inhibition process of the
cerebral cortex by inﬂuencing the bioelectricity activities of the nerve cells in the
corresponding brain function area or indirectly improved the brain sleep by
inﬂuencing the blood ﬂow of the brain [12–14, 19].
Currently in general it was believed the low-frequency alternating electric ﬁeld
might act on the cell membrane of the organism and inﬂuence its ionic permeability
to change the micro-environment of the cell and inﬂuence the metabolic activity of
the cell and then the excitability of the nerve cell was changed, which indicated
TMCT could also well adjust sleep and provided a study means for studying the
biological effect of TMCPT on the brain function in future.
5.2
Signiﬁcance of Brain Function Keeping Training
for Altitude Flight to Sleep Guarantee
The altitude hypoxia environment was the main reason causing dyssomnia.
Indicated by the altitude medical study, all altitude permanent residents’ sleep
quality was decreased. It was the clearest in the early stage, which was charac-
terized in headache and insomnia. With the prolongation of the living time, some
person’s conditions might be recovered or improved because of the variation of
individual adaptabilities, however the hypoxia environment always existed, the
signiﬁcance difference between the sleep quality and the basic sleep (in the low
altitude area or plain area) didn’t disappear [1]. Continuous oxygen inhalation was
proven to be the effective way for improving the altitude hypoxia and improving the
sleep quality, but it was not practical of supplying oxygen in 24 h, and the poor
sleep quality would always exist in the altitude hypoxia environment but could not
be avoided. Ensuring the high-efﬁciency brain function was the necessary condition
for the pilot to operate the advanced and complicated electronic cabin, thus, the
external intervention and training for brain function was one of the effective
practical means which could be taken for improving the sleep in the altitude
hypoxia condition.
Compliance with Ethical Standards The study was approved by the Logistics Department for
Civilian Ethics Committee of institute of aviation medicine. All subjects who participated in the
experiment were provided with and signed an informed consent form. All relevant ethical safe-
guards have been met with regard to subject protection.

Abstract This paper tested and analyzed the vibration of a special vehicle’s crew
seat, collected the vehicle cabin vibration signal under different road environment,
and at certain speed, it studied the effect of vehicle vibration on crew, and as the
basis of vehicle seat retroﬁt design. The analysis results show that the maximum
vibration acceleration value was on the longitudinal of the driver and other crew’s
position, and in the later, design improvements should mainly focus on the lon-
gitudinal vibration reduction. At the same time in the process of vehicle test under
different grade road crew’s comfort, all performed well; this shows that design in a
certain velocity of anti-vibration meets the requirements of ergonomics. This paper
provides suitable personnel vibration fatigue monitoring test method for special
vehicle crew; the data obtained from this method are signiﬁcant and can be
effectively applied to the practical test, and it has important reference value on the
seat of the vehicle vibration reduction design and the crew comfort evaluation.

Introduction
The safe and comfortable working environment can guarantee the special vehicle
crew’s work efﬁciency and the effective displaying of the equipment performance.
As required by mission, besides working on the roads of low grade and even in the
severe environment, the special vehicle also needs to do some special work [1], and
cabin vibration environment generated during work severely inﬂuences the crew’s
work efﬁciency. The comfortability in the vehicle can be assessed by collecting and
analyzing the cabin vibration signals. Based on the inﬂuence and assessment of the

vibration environment of the vehicle cabin and its inﬂuence on the crew’s work
efﬁciency, basis can be provided for controlling the vibration of the vehicle cabin
and the crew’s individual protection, which is signiﬁcant for ensuring the crew’s
work efﬁciency, increasing the crew’s work ability, and displaying the technical
performance of the equipment of the special vehicle [2]. The paper collects and
analyzes the vibration signals of the cabin seat of a special vehicle and mainly
collects the relevant information about the inﬂuence of the vehicle vibration on the
crew and is signiﬁcant for improving the driving environment of the vehicle.
2
Analysis of Vibration Characteristics of Vehicle Cabin
The vibration characteristics can be summarized as the direction, strength, and
frequency of the vibration. The vibration of the cabin of the special vehicle is the
whole-body vibration in three axial directions which are respectively in the X-axis
(from back to chest), Y-axis (from right side to left side), and Z-axis (from foot or
hip to head). The excitation of the body caused by road unevenness is the main
reason causing the vibration of the cabin of the special vehicle. Most of the
vibration of the vehicle cabin is the low-frequency great-amplitude vibration, and
the vibration strength in the Z direction is commonly larger than those of X and
Y and is the main factor inﬂuencing the crew’s work efﬁciency. Also, there are test
results that show the spectrum range at the driver position is wide, and many signals
have the uneven energy distribution at the range of 1–80 Hz to which the human
body is most sensitive, and also the low-frequency ingredients are rich while the
vibration frequency range of most crew positions is relatively narrow and is mainly
distributed at 20–50 Hz [3]. Because the driver position is close to the engine
compartment, and also the space of the driving cabin is narrow, the driver’s seat is
designed to be different from the passenger’s seat in structure, size, and vibration
reduction, which causes the comfortability of the driver’s seat not as good as the
passenger’s seat while the vibration strength is higher than the that of the pas-
senger’s position. Thus, the low-frequency vibration in the Z-axis direction of the
driver is the key point for the vibration control and protection design of the special
vehicle.

Vibration Test
3.1
Test Scheme
The test is carried out strictly according to GJB59.15 ﬁeld vibration test regulations
[4]. Three sampling points together are set as follows: the ﬁrst sampling point is set
inside the driving cabin and near the driver’s seat so as to collect the vibration
602

signals in three directions of the driver’s seat, whereas in the X-axis direction, it
points from back to chest; in the Y-axis direction, it points from the left side to the
right side; and in the longitudinal direction of Z-axis, it points from foot to head.
The inﬂuence of vehicle vibration on the driver is obtained by analyzing the 3D
vibration signals at the seat of the driving cabin. The second sampling point is set at
the copilot site to collect the vibration signals of the copilot site when the vehicle
runs, and the inﬂuence of vehicle vibration on the copilot is obtained by analyzing
the 3D vibration signals at the copilot seat of the driving cabin. The three sampling
point is set at the back passenger site to collect the vibration signals of the passenger
site when the vehicle runs, and the inﬂuence of vehicle vibration on the back
passenger is obtained by analyzing the 3D vibration signals at the back passenger
seat of the passenger cabin.
The cement road, gravel road, and rough road are used for the test, and two times
of test are respectively carried out to each type of road. The speeds for each test on
the cement and gravel roads are all 40 km/h, and the speed on the rough road is
30 km/h.
3.2
Test System
The test system comprises the following parts as shown in Fig. 1. The acceleration
sensor, the charge ampliﬁer, and the portable data collector form the system for
collecting the vibration signals. According to the test regulations, the acceleration
sensor and charge ampliﬁer from the PCB company are used for the test. The
portable data collector comprises of a signal processor and some peripheral
components.
The measurement of the vibration signals at the seat position belongs to the
low-frequency vibration measurement, and also the seat surface is uneven when it is
used by the passenger and cannot be drilled, either; thus, the best installing way is
installed in the cushion.
Because the responses of all points of the vibration structure are greatly different,
the proper position for installing the sensor is very important. Generally, the sensor
shall not be installed on the node or nodal line of the structure vibration but the
position with high structure response signals so as to increase the signal-to-noise
ratio as well as the test precision. The seat test aims to monitor the vibration source
of the seat structure, and the position for installing the sensor shall be as close as to
the direct transmission path of the vibration source, and the installing direction must
reﬂect the vibration direction of the vibration source.

Processing and Analysis of Test Data
4.1
Processing Method for Vibration Data
The key point for processing the test data is to conﬁrm the driver’s allowable
exposure time according to the limit curve of work efﬁciency reduced by fatigue,
which is given by X-, Y-, and Z-axis according to the regulations of the vibration
test, so as to conﬁrm the driver’s safe driving hours, and also the total assessment
for the driver’s comfortability is qualitatively given according to ISO2631 [1]. At
ﬁrst, spectral value of one-third of octave of the corresponding vibration signals of
each coordinate axis is calculated out at ﬁrst, and then, the corresponding weighting
acceleration root-mean-square (RMS) value can be conﬁrmed according to the
spectral value of one-third of octave. The formula is as follows:
awj ¼ aj  wj
ð1Þ
wherein: aj is 1/3 of the central frequency fj and the spectral values of octave are
j = 1, 2, … 20, and wj is the weighing factors relevant to the vibration direction and
central frequencies. Then, the maximum value of awj is used for ﬁnding out the
allowable exposure time according to the limit of the work efﬁciency reduced by
fatigue in the corresponding direction in Table 2. At last, the minimum allowable
exposure times in the X-, Y-, and Z-axis are used for conﬁrming the driver’s
allowable exposure time.
4.2
Analysis of 3D Vibration Data at the Crew’s Seats
The weighting acceleration root-mean-square values corresponding to each axis of
each crew is calculated out as shown in Figs. 2, 3, and 4 according to Formula (1):
According to the analysis based on the calculation results, the weighing accel-
eration root-mean-square value in the transverse Y direction of the driver’s position
is minimum. According to Table 1 fatigue-work efﬁciency exposure time, it can be
obtained that the allowable exposure times of the driver’s position on three types of
road are respectively as follows: On the cement road when the speed is 40 km/h, it
is 16 h; on the gravel road when the speed is 40 km/h, it is 7.8 h; and on the rough
road when the speed is 30 km/h, it is 19.6 h, and so on. The allowable exposure
times of the copilot and back passenger positions under the three types of roads are
shown in Table 2.
Indicated by Figs. 2, 3, and 4, the longitudinal weighing acceleration
root-mean-square values of the three positions are maximum, and generate the
highest inﬂuences on the crew, which will cause the crew to feel uncomfortable,
wherein the uncomfortable seats play 80% inﬂuence on the crew’s comfortability
[5]. After comprehensively analyzing the 3D vibration test data of the seats, when

the vehicle runs at a certain speed on every type of the road, the comprehensive
assessment of all positions of the passenger is obtained. Wherein, the weighting
acceleration values of the three passengers on the three types of roads are shown in
Table 3. Indicated by the relationship between the acceleration values and people’s

positions is good.

Discussion and Conclusion
(1) The difference of the seat vibration system of each position after vibration
reduction is mainly caused by the different structure design and layout of the
whole body. The analysis of the vehicle vibration test is the important way for
assessing the vehicle body vibration environment. The data obtained by mea-
surement can be analyzed to provide data support for designing the seat and the
whole vehicle vibration systems. The vibration reduction efﬁciency of the seat
system can be improved for absorbing the vibration energy, wherein the
vibration reduction material of the seat and the contact part of the seat and the
vehicle body can be improved. Because the vibration conditions of different
positions are different, the vibration reduction requirements on different posi-
tions cannot be satisﬁed if only one type of vibration reduction is used.
Indicated by the test, the vibration statuses of the vehicle on different types of
roads are not same, but in general, the longitudinal vibration acceleration value
is the highest, and it shall focus on improving the design of the longitudinal
vibration reduction. Also, it indicates the crew’s comfortabilities on different
types of roads in the test process are good, which means the vibration reduction
design of the vehicle at a certain speed meets the requirement of work
efﬁciency.
(2) Limited by the actual test ﬁeld, the test does not cover all of the tests on all
types of roads and at high speeds, and it will be supplemented and completed in
future tests.
(3) The paper provides a test method applicable for the special vehicle crew’s
vibration fatigue monitoring. The data obtained by the method are signiﬁcant,
can be effectively applied to the actual ﬁeld test, and play an important refer-
ence value for the vibration reduction design of the vehicle seat and the
assessment of the crew’s comfortability.

Introduction
As an important component of air defense forces (ADF) weapon system, the
ﬁre-control radar (FCR) is employed to search, detect, intercept, and track aerial
targets. The electromagnetic environment is nowadays getting more and more
complex, which brings about greater and greater adverse inﬂuences upon ADF FCRs
and increasing difﬁculties in quantitative assessment of their performances. Various
standards are adopted by researchers to assess the anti-jamming performances of
such complicated equipment from different angles or emphasis [1–4]; therefore, it is
hard to reach a consensus in the assessment of FCR anti-jamming performances.
Limited by conditions of this kind and that sort, obtaining the actual data of FCR
anti-jamming performances through a number of confrontational tests is of com-

plicated implementation, high expenses, and long-time consumption. In addition,
many a jamming method exists in complex electromagnetic circumstances, whose
effect shall undoubtedly be differed either with regard to one anti-jamming measure
or with regard to anti-jamming measures of different kinds, resulting in the absence
of a mathematical model to precisely assess the anti-jamming performances of
FCRs. It is therefore an issue worthy of researching to carry out comprehensive
assessment of FCR anti-jamming performances with proper methods.
2
Analysis of the Assessment Standard of FCR
Anti-jamming Performances
2.1
The Standard of Information Losses
Jamming functions to suppress or destroy the FCR’s capabilities to detect or obtain
target information. The FCR detects aerial targets in the background of random
noise and is featured by the attribute of uncertainty. According to the theory of
information, ENTROPY [5] is the value to weigh the uncertainty of random vari-
ables, and it is usually adopted to evaluate the FCR anti-jamming performances and
the optimum jamming wave pattern. This standard is characterized by clear con-
ception, strict theory but complicated calculation, and is yet to be broadly applied.
2.2
The Standard of Power
It means to assess the FCR anti-jamming performances by researching the variation
of the ratio between the power of signal and that of jamming, and usually adopts the
FCR self-defense range and suppression coefﬁcient as the evaluation index. This
standard shows the fact that radar confrontation is the confrontation of power,
reﬂecting the traditional thoughts of anti-jamming performance assessment, and is
most widely and frequently adopted.
2.3
The Standard of Tactical Application
This standard falls into 2 categories: one is to link FCR and relevant weapons and
assess the anti-jamming performances according to how much air defense operation
is completed with the support of the FCR, and the overall confrontation effect is
assessed with the probability of penetration and damage as the index; the other is to
take the variation of such tactical parameters as FCR working range, measuring
accuracy and tracking accuracy as the index while avoiding possible changes when
FCR is equipped with different weapons.
612
W. Yu et al.

2.4
The Standard of Probability
This standard is to measure the anti-jamming performance in accordance with the
probability of FCR’s completion of given tasks, with the probability of FCR
deception jamming, false alarm, and detection as the index. It accents the FCR
capability of battle space information obtaining and is of good intuition and con-
venience, but this standard is built upon large quantities of statistical data based on
real combat or tests and is therefore difﬁcult to obtain and compute.
2.5
The Standard of Time
In given conditions, it takes a component of a weapon system a certain period of
time to complete a certain task, namely, the FCR needs time to detect, indentify,
intercept, and track a target. Response time may immediately reﬂect the perfor-
mance of a weapon, so the standard of time is an intuitional and effective standard
of assessment. Detecting time ratio, tracking time ratio, and ﬂight path starting time
difference are usually adopted as the index.
2.6
The Standard of Display
It means to destroy some display features of echo waves so as to adversely inﬂuence
or reduce the visibility of target signal and increase the difﬁculty to ﬁnd the target, or
even leave nothing but only the scanning line on the radar display, making it
impossible to search, intercept, or track aerial targets. Such jamming may as well
generate a number of dummy targets so that FCR operator cannot identify and judge
aerial targets, resulting in false or lost air situation and leading to hindrance of air
defense operations. Jamming strength is often adopted as the index in level I, II and III.

Modeling of FCR Anti-jamming Capability
In complex electromagnetic circumstances, an individual assessment standard may
not be suitable to measure the FCR’s overall anti-jamming capability when con-
fronted with various jamming or passive jamming. In accordance with the FCR
technical characteristics, this paper adopts a multi-attribute decision-making
method which categorizes the FCR anti-jamming capability into several attri-
butes, assesses each one with suitable standard, and integrates the results by proper
means. This method may, on the one hand, deduce quantitative factors by strict
Modeling and Analyzing of Fire-Control Radar Anti-jamming …
613

theoretical calculation, and on the other hand, combine qualitative factors, expe-
rience data, and expert opinions, and it is therefore a reasonable and applicable
assessment method.
3.1
To Determine the Set of Assessment Schemes
The set of assessment scheme, represented by V, refers to 3 types of FCR, namely
V = {V1, V2, V3}. It is required to conduct comprehensive analyses on the 6 attri-
butes of the assessment scheme in one jamming environment in order to obtain the
value of each scheme.
3.2
To Determine the Primary Attributes
3.2.1
The Attribute of Resolution
Use the factor of Resolution, E1, to assess the comprehensive resolution [2] as
follows:
E1 ¼ ToBsGA
ð1Þ
In this equation, TO represents the time of duration of radar signal; BS represents
the instant bandwidth of the radar system; GA represents the radar antenna gain.
High radar resolution may not only project more transmitting power onto target but
reduce the jamming power of antenna input.
3.2.2
The Attribute of Power
Use the factor of power, E2, to assess the inﬂuence of receiver SINR upon radar
anti-jamming capability as follows:
E2 ¼

Prj=Prs  2Kj

W. Yu et al.

In this equation, Prj represents the power of jamming signal received by radar;
Prs represents the power of target echo; Kj represents the SINR needed by radar
when working normally. Greater value of E2 stands for better radar anti-jamming
capability. SINR Prj/Prs may be computed as follows:
Prj

In this equation, Pj represents the power of jammer; Ps represents the power of
radar; R represents the distance; Gj represents the gain of jammer; r represents RCS
of the aircraft; FA represents the equivalent loss.
3.2.3
The Attribute of Frequency
Use the factor of Frequency, E3, to assess the matching frequency of radar and
jamming. The frequency range of radar is [fr1, fr2], the frequency range of jammer is
[fj1, fj2], and length of intersection of the two ranges is d

3.2.4
The Attribute of Angular Tracking Mechanism
The angular tracking mechanism is the core part of an FCR, and the main part is
subject to exterior jamming. Use the factor of angular tracking mechanism, E4, to
assess the anti-jamming capability against various jamming pattern. Generally, it is
hard to express E4 with a given value, and there exists no mathematical formula to
obtain E4. It is required to study the matching extent of jamming pattern and
tracking mechanism and give a value between 0 and 1 as E4. The document [2]
adopts a half-qualitative half-quantitative method to estimate the probability of
counter angular deception jamming of different tracking mechanism and takes the
average probability of counter angular deception jamming of various tracking
mechanisms as shown in Table 1.

The Attribute of Technical Measures
According to the inherent features of FCRs, this paper lists 16 anti-jamming
measures and their inﬂuence upon anti-jamming capability as shown in Table 2.
In practical use, the value of the factor of radar attribute is the sum of each
anti-jamming capability.
3.2.6
The Attribute of Optoelectronic Devices
Many such optoelectronic devices have nowadays been equipped to the FCR as an
important auxiliary and anti-jamming measure as optical director, remote command
telescope, laser ranger ﬁnder, IR tracking system, and TV tracking system. These
devices, free of microwave jamming and passive jamming, are not only able to
measure angle and range independently but work together with radar to measure
angle and range. Table 3 lists out the value for the anti-jamming capability of
various optoelectronic devices. If more than one device is adopted, the value is the
sum of all corresponding factors.
3.3
To Determine the Weight Coefﬁcient
of the Primary Attributes
Based on experts’ opinions, this paper adopts the 1–9 scale AHP method to
establish the comparison matrix of importance for the primary attributes as follows:

This matrix is proved to be satisfactorily consistent,which adopts characteristic

weight coefﬁcient of the primary attributes is (0.05, 0.05, 0.09, 0.22, 0.37, 0.22).

Case Study
Take the self-defense jamming against FCR by the built-in jammer AN/ALQ-171
equipped to USAF ﬁghters as the example, and apply the model to assess the
anti-jamming capability of various types of radar. The frequency range of
AN/ALQ-171 jammer is 2.0–16.0 GHz; the frequency density of its noise barrage
jamming is 20–30 W/MHz and take the median in calculation; take the radar
cross-sect. 2 m2 and the slant range 50 km; radar technical and tactical perfor-
mances are omitted. Normalize E1, E5, and E6, set 1 as the maximum value, and the
other normalized value is the actual value divided by the maximum value and
obtain such results as is shown in Table 4.
Conduct comprehensive calculation with the decision-making model and obtain
the anti-jamming capability value of the assessment schemes V = {V1, V2,
V3} = {0.66, 0.49, 0.78}. The anti-jamming capability of the 3 types of radar can be
ranked as V3 > V1 > V2.

Conclusions
This paper studies on the anti-jamming capability of FCR in complex electro-
magnetic circumstances. As various attributes, including those qualitative ones in
particular, which may probably inﬂuence the anti-jamming capability, are taken into
consideration, and large quantities of experience data and expert opinions are
incorporated, this paper reaches a precise and true result. The assessment model is
reasonable, simple, and effective, and it is of a certain practical value. Further study
needs to be done in determining the weight of each attribute, as well as the dynamic

for Nuclear Power Control Room
Kun Yu
Abstract The layout of human–machine interface equipments in the nuclear power
control room has an important inﬂuence on the efﬁciency of human–machine
interaction and the operation safety. The layout virtual veriﬁcation method based on
human factors engineering was studied. The clustering method based on grey
theory was established to aggregate the veriﬁcation information of human–machine
system. The human factors layout virtual veriﬁcation platform was developed based
on the simulation system, and the feasibility and visibility of the layout of control
room, the work attitude and the rationality of the work space were realized with
using the proposed virtual human model. The proposed virtual veriﬁcation method
can complete the human factors layout veriﬁcation and improve the nuclear power
control room design during the virtual design phase.

Introduction
The nuclear power control room was the monitoring and control centre for the
nuclear power system both in normal operation and accident status. The nuclear
power plant accidents investigation of USA, France and other 6 countries showed
that the average ratio of human-related events over 60%, up to 85% [1]. The human
factors had become the main inﬂuencing factors for the nuclear power system
safety. The rationality of human factors engineering design of control room directly
affected the efﬁciency and safety of nuclear power system. There were many
researches on the virtual veriﬁcation for nuclear power plants in foreign. Isaac José
had done researches on virtual veriﬁcation of human–machine system of Argonauta
nuclear power plant reactor consoles [2]. Carlos had developed the virtual console

models of nuclear power plant for the operators training, and human–machine
system veriﬁcation [3]. Leandro had developed the operators’ human body and the
virtual environment model of main control room to test the operation time of critical
safety systems for nuclear power plants. The operators could perform active nav-
igation and interaction in the virtual control room [4]. Virtual veriﬁcation tech-
nology had become an important design veriﬁcation method in nuclear power
system. In this paper, the virtual veriﬁcation of human factors layout for the nuclear
power control room was studied, and the veriﬁcation technique based on Delmia
simulation platform was constructed. To realize the virtual veriﬁcation of the lay-
out, accessibility,visibility and comfort of human body in the nuclear power control
room through study of layout method.

Veriﬁcation Indexes for Control Room Layout
In the human engineering review program NUREG-711 of U.S. nuclear regulatory
commission USNRC, veriﬁcation and validation of human factors design was
prescribed as an important and necessary part of a nuclear power plant design [5].
There were design requirements for main control room, remote shutdown station
layout, the backup panel layout, including the large screen system, backup panels,
operator stations, and so on. In the human–system interface design review guide-
lines NUREG-700, there were the design requirements for human–machine inter-
face of nuclear power plant [6]. The basic requirements for human factors layout of
nuclear power control room were constructed, and layout veriﬁcation indexes
system of nuclear power control room was established, as shown in Table 1.

Visibility Veriﬁcation Method
The visibility of equipments layout in control room required that the operators
could observe the human–machine interface equipments conveniently and clearly
while keeping normal operating position, including the layout visual ﬁeld of dis-
plays, visual angle of characters and symbols in human–machine interface.
The VDU displays, large screen displays, the displays and indicators in backup
panels should be arranged in the view of operators, and the frequently used or
continuous monitoring or important displays should been arranged within the
operators’ best or comfortable vision. The height of the labels in backup panel was
not less than 15 arcmin, and the best visual angle was about 20 arcmin. The height
of the character in large screen display should be greater than 15 arcmin. The
operator human body model was distributed to the 3D environment model of the

Overall Veriﬁcation Method of Layout
The general principle of working space layout was to improve the overall move-
ment efﬁciency and reduce the overall movement distance, to minimize the total
amount of movement of each part of body [7]. Dynamic human-machine interaction
based on human body model was driven by HTS module. The HTS module had the
ability to edit human actions, such as walking, crawling, placing, head rotation,
body bending, rotation, to simulate dynamic task process. First, operating model of
operator’s human body in different position and time in control room was created
and virtual human operating postures were connected in time order; then, the key
frame fusion technology was used to combine and connect all the actions to achieve
a coherent simulation process. Indexes of overall layout veriﬁcation [8]: ①oper-
ating time: the time required to complete the tasks; ②moving distance of body
gravity centre: the total distance of human body in the 3D space during tasks, it
indicated whether the operators body need to move too long, or frequently move
body, and the degree of match; ③body rotation angle: body axis rotation angle of
human body model during tasks, it explained whether operators need to move
frequently in control room; ④total hand moving distance: hand moving distance of
human body during tasks, it reﬂected the rationality of the controllers layout.

Veriﬁcation Method Based on Grey Clustering
The grey whitening weight function theory had an advantage in solving the
uncertainty information value clustering [9]. The researches showed that the Gauss
distribution was feasible to construct the information cognition degree distribution
function. It was universal and effective in expressing the universal distribution of
linguistic value system uncertainty. While X ¼ ½a; d; a  b  c  d, constructed
the whitening weight function model f ðxÞ for veriﬁcation index uncertainty infor-
mation cognitive degree based on the Gauss distribution. As shown in (1.1).

In practical application, it was meaningful to truncate the x value range as [a, b].
f ðxÞ ranged from [0, 1] to ½e; 1; 0\e\1. Coefﬁcient r determined the linear
distribution amplitude: when 1=r was smaller, the distribution was more concen-
trated; on the contrary, the distribution tended to disperse. The coefﬁcient r value
was related to the length of the distribution interval and the u of the intersection
point of the adjacent whitening groups. It was determined r by distribution interval
length and e value.

layout veriﬁcation, and the whitening weight function model based on Gauss dis-
tribution were established. The determination of the distribution amplitude and the

and Evaluation System and Its Application
Chenming Li, Yuhong Shen and Yichao Du
Abstract Objective To evaluate the efﬁciency of carrying load scientiﬁcally and
effectively and reduce human damage through the research of carrying load test and
evaluation system. At the same time, the research can guide the design and
development of carrying equipment, which will improve the adaptability between
the equipment and the human body. Methods The carrying load test and evaluation
system is composed of simulation model of human, sensing and acquisition device
of information, simulation platform of motion, force efﬁciency evaluation model of
human, software platform of test, and evaluation and so on. Three kinds of outdoor
backpack were tested under four different load weights to evaluate the backpack
performance through the system. Results The force, the resultant force, and the
resultant moment of the sample A are better than those of the sample B and the
sample C. Conclusions Different carrying load conditions are reﬂected by the
standard model of human body and precisely controllable simulation of movement
state, which solves the large individual differences of real tests, long test period, and
other issues. Based on the biomechanical test, the evaluation model of human body
force was established. The results show that the system can effectively carry out
scientiﬁc prediction and evaluation of the load carrying state through the testing of
different types of backpack.

Introduction
Walking with weights is a situation that outdoor enthusiasts, troops, and others
often encounter. In the process of carrying the load, due to the role of load gravity,
the relative movement between the load and the human and the bending of the body
to balance the weight will lead to fatigue, pain, and other symptoms [1, 2]. If the
load is too heavy, and the walking time is too long, it may cause foot soles, back
pain, even muscle strain, fracture, and other injuries [3, 4]. Scientiﬁc and effective
assessment of the carrying load efﬁciency can improve the adaptability between
equipment and human, which helps to reduce human injuries, protect the human
body, improve the operational efﬁciency, and guide the design and development of
carrying equipment [5–7].
At present, the research on the efﬁciency of carrying load mainly adopts the
subjective inquiry and the individual physiological experiment with carrying load
[8, 9]. The shortcomings of the method are its high cost and long experiment
period, and the deviation of the experimental result is big due to the individual
difference. This paper introduces an evaluation system of carrying load test, which
uses 50% of the male manikin model, and simulates walking, running, and other
sports through the movement simulation platform. Manikin and carrying equipment
installed on a variety of sensors, measuring the surface force of the manikin, the
force and torque of the torso, the tension equivalent of the shoulder strap, and the
force of the human can be predicted to evaluate the system of carrying load.

Carrying Load Test and Evaluation System
The carrying load test and evaluation system are composed of simulation model of
human, sensing and acquisition device of information, simulation platform of
motion, force efﬁciency evaluation model of human, software platform of test and
evaluation, and so on.

Simulation Model of Human
Simulation model of human meets the size of 50% of young men characteristics,
and the hardness of the shoulder, waist, back, and other key force parts is similar to
the young soldiers. In addition, the centroid of the internal skeleton and the segment
is close to the human body.
The shape of the simulated human body is based on the analysis of the size of
male young people. The body size of 12 young middle-size male soldiers is
measured by three-dimensional scanner, and the collected data are analyzed sta-
tistically. The average and standard deviation of the above data determine the size

of the key parts. The centroid of the model is measured by the human centroid
measuring instrument through the above 12 subjects. The centroid position of each
segment is calculated according to GB/T17245-2004, and the data were analyzed
and processed by statistical method to determine the centroid position and mass
distribution of each segment. For simulation model of human, two-component
vulcanized silicone rubber is used as the base material, while silica gel as the
reinforcing agent, silicon powder as ﬁller, methyl silicone oil as diluent, and dialkyl
dicarboxylic acid as catalyst. Based on the body size and skeletal CT scan data,
three-dimensional CAD software is used to simulate the skeletal structure of the
manikin by using the torso load simulation. The internal skeletal structure of the
simulation model is developed by using CNC machine tools and 45 steel.
2.2
Sensing and Acquisition Device of Information
The signal collected by the system mainly includes the pressure signal on the back,
waist, and shoulder, the tension signal of the shoulder strap, the force and torque on
the spine, and the tracking of the movement waveform.
Pressure measurement selects the 9801 thin-ﬁlm pressure sensor produced by the
United States Tekscan. The pressure sensor is mainly located in the shoulder, waist,
and back. The tension sensor is mainly used to measure the tension of the shoulder
strap. SMRT-P-200 micro-tension sensor is selected, which installs in the con-
nection of backpack and lower part of the shoulder strap. Motion signal is measured
by the PATRIOT WIRELESS system produced by the United States POLHEMUS
company, which uses the wireless electromagnetic tracking method for motion
signal acquisition. Force and torque sensors are selected by the German GTM’s
MKA-1K six-dimensional force and torque sensors. The sensor is installed between
the human simulation model and the motion simulation platform, and it can mea-
sure the force and torque of X, Y, and Z in three axial directions at the same time.
2.3
Simulation Platform of Motion
Simulation platform of motion is mainly used for simulation of walking, running,
jumping, and other motor functions. The time-domain signal on six degrees of
freedom, which is collected by the human body attitude measurement sensor, is
converted into vibration displacement and vibration velocity signal by the low-pass
ﬁlter
and
the
digital
signal.
And
the
signal
is
the
drive
signal
for
a
six-degree-of-freedom low-frequency simulation platform of man’s motion to
achieve the simulation of the action.
The motion simulation platform is mainly composed of upper platform, lower
platform, six electric cylinders, ball hinges, universal joints, electronic control
system, and control computer. The motion of the platform is realized by the
Research on Carrying Load Test and Evaluation System and Its …

coordinated movement of six electric cylinders, which is three-degree-of-freedom
translation motion and rotary motion around the X-, Y-, Z-axis direction.
2.4
Force Efﬁciency Evaluation Model of Human
Conduct the experiment in the condition of different loads, different kinds of car-
rying equipment, and the actual walking test. Then measure the pressure of the
shoulder, back, and waist and the tension of the shoulder strap, and score the sense
of force according to the evaluation scale. Next, power spectrum and 1/3 octave
method are used to normalize the test data. The mixed-effect regression analysis
method is used to establish the evaluation model of the force for scientiﬁc evalu-
ation of the shoulder and body force. Establish a body force model, and the formula
is as shown in Formula 1:

Software Platform of Test and Evaluation
The software of test and evaluation is the control center of the whole system. The
main control program adopts the Labview with advanced computer bus technology
and virtual instrument programming technology and MATLAB, which is a pow-
erful data analysis and engineering computing language. The C language pro-
gramming is used in the Field DSP control for its high reliability and the
characteristic of easy to write. Based on the above technologies, the user-friendly,
easy-to-operate, and strong-extension software is designed, which is an application
software with a fast and efﬁcient data acquisition, model operation, force prediction,

Experiments
3.1
Test Information
The object is three kinds of backpack produced by Shanghai Paijian Industry and
Trade Co., Ltd. (as shown in Fig. 1), and the simulation mode of the human motion
(speed: 5 km/h, slope: 0°) is selected. Four load weights (25, 29, 34, and 37 kg) in
each backpack were tested three times. Measure the pressure of the shoulder, waist
and back of the simulation model, the tension of the shoulder strap, and the force
and torque of the model spine. Then, the force of the human body will be predicted.
3.2
Test Results
The test results are shown in Table 1.
It can be seen from Fig. 1 a 2-cm-thick ﬁller is ﬁlled at the overall position
between sample A and the human back, while the ﬁller of sample B and sample C
mainly concentrated in the back of the human on both sides. At the same time, for
sample A, metal bracket structure is used between the ﬁller and the backpack. At
the bottom of the metal bracket, the curved protrusions (Fig. 2) make the backpack
and the human body is more closely ﬁt, which will help rational distribution of the
weight on back, shoulder, and waist, and protect the human body from carrying
load. Therefore, the force, the resultant, and the resultant moment of the sample A is
better than that of the other two backpacks.
The size of the shoulder strap and belt of three kinds of backpack is shown in
Table 2.
As can be seen from Table 2, compared sample A and sample C, the width of the
shoulder strap is close, but the shoulder strap of sample A is signiﬁcantly thicker,

which plays a better cushioning effect, so the shoulder force is less. Although the
sample B’s shoulder strap and belt are narrower and thinner than the sample C, the
softness is signiﬁcantly better than that of the sample C, resulting in a more uniform
force across the shoulder and waist. Therefore, the sense of force has no big
difference between sample B and sample C.

Conclusions
Carrying load test and evaluation system use the standard human simulation model,
precise control of the movement state to simulate different carrying load conditions,
which solves the large individual differences, long test cycle, and other issues.
Based on the biomechanical test, the evaluation model of human force is estab-
lished. The test of different types of backpack shows that the system can effectively
predict and evaluate the load carrying state.

Abstract Objective To investigate workload changes of subjects during simulated
long-haul ﬂights at daytime and nighttime. Methods Eight volunteers were com-
pleted the simulated long-haul ﬂight experiments at the same time periods of day
and night. The parameters of measurements included ﬂight simulation performance,
additional task performance, ratings of perceived exertion scale (RPE), Stanford
Sleepiness Scale (SSS), and critical ﬂicker fusion frequency (CFF). Results There
were no signiﬁcant changes of the simulated ﬂight performance between daytime
group and nighttime group. The achievement of additional task was signiﬁcantly
lower than that of the same time period in daytime group. RPE and SSS scores in
nighttime group were increased and CFF decreased. Conclusions Simulated
long-haul ﬂight at nighttime could aggravate the ﬂight workload and reduce the
reserved operating capacity.

named “Operation Enduring Freedom,” came from Missouri Whiteman air base
kept sustained ﬂight up to 44 h of the longest record [1]. Because of the unpre-
dictable working hours, long duty periods, circadian disruptions, and insufﬁcient
sleep in military ﬂight operations, pilots’ fatigue is a signiﬁcant problem in
long-haul ﬂight missions. To evaluate the workload of Air Force pilots in long-haul
ﬂight missions and develop effective health safeguard measures was an important
way to improve combat capability of military pilots.

Methods
2.1
Subjects
Eight healthy young male volunteers, age 20.5 ± 1.2 years, self-reported no sleep
disorders, were participated the experiments. Using a self-repeated measurements
design, the subjects were divided for into two groups according to the experiment
period of day and night: daytime group, 12:45–17:00, and nighttime group,
0:45–5:00.
2.2
Parameters and Equipment
(1) Flight performance score and additional task performance.
The ﬂight performance score and additional task performance can be automatically
generated and evaluated by simulated long-haul ﬂight workload evaluation system.
The evaluation quality standard was set to “high.” The additional task performance
parameters include task quantity, accuracy rate, and reaction time (RT).
(2) Critical ﬂicker fusion frequency
Window ﬂicker meter (BD-II-118) was used. Yellow spot was selected, light
intensity was 1/16, bright black ratio was 1:1, and the background light intensity
was 1/16. According to the order of “raise, raise, cut, cut,” recording a total of four
frequency values, take the arithmetic mean as the results.
(3) Standford Sleepiness Scale (SSS) and Ratings of Perceived Exertion Scale
(RPE)
SSS is divided into seven grades, from “awake and alert” for 1 scores to “almost fall
to sleep” for 7 scores. RPE is also divided into seven levels, from “very, very light”
for 6 scores to “very, very heavy” for 19–20 scores.

2.3
Experimental Procedure
The subjects were trained for simulated ﬂight operation for 2 weeks at least. Each
scoring period was set to 1-h period, of which the simulated long-haul ﬂight time
accounts for about 45 min. The parameter measurements accounted for about
15 min. A total of scoring periods were ﬁve phase (0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 h).
2.4
Statistical Analysis
SAS statistical software was used for multivariate repeated-measures analysis of
variance.
The

were
arcsine-square-root-transformed,
and
non-normal distribution data were logarithmic-transformed.

Results
(1) The performance of simulated ﬂight and additional task
As shown in Fig. 1, the quantity of additional task ﬁnished at the 3rd h and the 4th h
in nighttime group was signiﬁcantly lower than that of the same time period in
daytime group (p < 0.05, p < 0.01), in which the quantity of additional task ﬁnished
at the 4th h was even lower than that of the same ﬂight at the 1st h period (p < 0.01).
Compared with daytime group, the accuracy rates of additional task in nighttime
group decreased signiﬁcantly and the RT prolonged at the 4th h, which was even
longer than that of the same ﬂight at the 1st h (p < 0.01), as shown in Fig. 2.

As shown in Fig. 3, RPE scores in nighttime group were increased from the 2nd h
and remained high constantly (p < 0.01), and was higher than daytime group at the
4th h (p < 0.01). According to the RPE score judgment, the scores were between
“lighter” (11–12) and “a little bit heavy” (13–14). SSS scores in nighttime group
were increased from the 3rd h (p < 0.05).
As shown in Fig. 4, CFF in nighttime group decreased from the 2nd h (p < 0.05,

Discussion
Workload evaluation is an important tool to improve operational efﬁciency, prevent
fatigue, and maintain physical and mental health of workers. Due to long duty
periods, circadian disruptions, insufﬁcient sleep, acute or cumulative ﬂight fatigue,
a decline in spatial orientation ability occurs, and thus seriously affects ﬂight safety
[2]. It was found that not only sleep/awakening is associated with biological clock,
but also working capability changes as the core body temperature ﬂuctuates. For
example, during the lowest core body temperature at 3:00 AM–5:00 AM, the
alertness, RT, accuracy, and physical force would all be reduced [3]. Therefore, to
research workload changes in different time intervals of daytime and nighttime
ﬂight is of special military signiﬁcance.
Based on different aircrafts, a variety of ﬂight simulators have been developed,
such as UH-60 helicopter simulator, Boeing 737 simulator, F-117 ﬁghter simulator,
as well as F-7E simulator. The additional task performance efﬁciency can indirectly
reﬂect the workload by main task. Common contents of additional tasks include
memory ability, digital computing, RT, time estimation, target tracking, etc. [4].
The study results showed that the performance in simulated long-haul ﬂight did not
noticeably affected by nighttime period of the experiments. But the quantity of
additional task completed by the subjects was reducing with low accuracy rates, and
RT prolongation, indicating that the operational workloads in nighttime were
increased and the reserved workload capacity was declined.
People have a certain self-perception on workload. Therefore, subjective scales
can be used to judge subjective workload. Ratings of Perceived Exertion Scale
(RPE) and Stanford Sleepiness Scale (SSS) are often used to evaluate the workload
[5]. Our results showed that both daytime and nighttime simulated ﬂights would all
induce the subjects’ subjective fatigue, signiﬁcantly increased sleepiness, but

judging from the speciﬁc scores, RPE scores were in between “lighter” and “a little
bit heavy,” and SSS scores were in between “alertness and responsiveness bad” and
“minds not quite awake, bad energy,” which were within the best of labor load
range [6].
CFF, an indicator for assessing nervous fatigue, is often used to measure and
determine the workload of nervous system. This study results showed that the CFF
was decreased in the subjects in nighttime simulated long-haul ﬂight operations,
suggesting that the workload of simulated long-haul ﬂight during night was sig-
niﬁcantly heavier than that during daytime.

Conclusion
In conclusion, simulated long-haul ﬂight at nighttime could aggravate the ﬂight
workload and reduce the reserved operating capacity in subjects. Above all results,
this study provides a theoretical basis for the development of targeted health
safeguard strategy in future.
Compliance with Ethical Standards The study was approved by the State Key Laboratory of
NBC Protection for Civilian Ethics Committee.

teristics of the simulation test platform for university laboratory, and it can meet
ergonomics requirements in terms of vehicle driving comfort. It can play an
important role in design practice for teaching. In order to help students understand

Introduction
Nowadays, automobile design follows some principles of user-centered, safety,
comfort, and convenience. The vehicle driving simulator can simulate the state of
the vehicle driving and research on the integration of the man–machine interface, to
verify and optimize the automobile ergonomics design [1].
It is found that the vehicle driving test platform is mainly used in the automotive
industry, and it is very hard to apply to ergonomics in universities laboratory. Those
have been referred in some relevant theoretical researches. One of the researches was
conducted by Yin Mengjie. She used the virtual human body model to study the
interface of the car seat, control interface, and display device interface in
the “Research on human machine interface design for automobile cab”; According to

the experimental platform of biomechanics behavior of drivers, Zhang E, Hong Jun,
Wu Wenwu, Liang Jian thought they can simulate and analyze people’s behavior in
different driving environments and discuss how to match to the interface in the paper
of “Design and analysis of a test stand for biomechanics of man-machine interface in
automobile driving.” Yuan Dongmei, Li Yahui, Zheng Xiaomei designed a strength
test platform for automobile seat in the paper of “Design on strength test bed of
automobile seat,” and it was little complex and could do many kinds of strength test,
such as the backrest test, headrest strength test, and seat static performance test.
Currently, most of the vehicle driving simulation test platforms are complex,
multifunctional, and expensive; but they are not suitable to university laboratory.
Therefore, this paper will introduce the design and manufacture of a vehicle sim-
ulation test platform. The beneﬁts are low cost, easy assembling, wide universality,
which meet the needs of experimental teaching well. With the help of the ergo-
nomic evaluation system of automobile driving, the ergonomics design of the
vehicle can be veriﬁed and optimized.

Analyzing of Human Comfort in Automobile Driving
This paper is based on the theory of ergonomics, in order to optimize the comfort of
driving. While driving in well posture, people feel tireless and energy consumption
is low. So the efﬁciency of the equipment in the laboratory is very important for the
drivers. Not only it can help the operator to take a stable posture to perform more
ﬁne motor, but also it is good to operate the pedal control devices [2]. Standard car
seat driving postures are presented in Fig. 1. The position of the human body on the
car seat is determined by the visual ﬁelds, and the comfort range of various parts of
the human body is shown in Fig. 1. The most comfortable vertical distance from
ischium to heel is 250–405 mm [3].

Design and Assemble of Vehicle Simulation Driving Test
Platform
3.1
Design Principles of Vehicle Driving Simulator
The target user of the vehicle simulation driving test platform is the faculty in
university laboratory. The main purposes are inexpensive, easy to install, and
convenient to operate. By the test platform to achieve ergonomics experiments, it
will improve the level of combination of theoretical teaching and practical opera-
tion. Finally, it will be helpful for students to understand relevant knowledge of
vehicle driving.
Vehicle driving simulation test platform should have some parts of function
structures, support structures, installation, and adjustment mechanism. First of all,
the functional structure includes car seat assembly, steering wheel assembly, and
driving pedal assembly. This professional independent equipment, including seat,
steering wheel and pedals, are custom-made subject to manufacture requirements.
Then, the supporting structure is the whole framework of the test platform,
including the bearing frame of vehicle seat, the bracket of steering wheel, and the
position reference of car pedal. To be ensured the reliability of the test operation,
the reasonable installation methods, positions, and quantities can be set up by the
stress analysis of the functional structure. The same installation forms are shared by
different types of the same components, which is easy to replace during the test.
Finally, the regulators should be set up on the basis of the following parameters: the
height of the seat; the height, the angle, and the distance of the steering wheel; the
angle and the distance of the automobile pedal.
In order to meet those requirements mentioned above, the projects of the pro-
totype of the vehicle simulation test platform are demonstrated in Fig. 2.
3.2
The Assembly of Vehicle Simulation Driving Test
Platform
1. Building the support structures
We choose aluminum sections which label is 4040L as main elements to
building the test platform. Aluminum proﬁle has light mass and is easy
to operate, which may ensure the whole structure stable, reliable, and easy to
disassemble (Fig. 3). Some joint elements were chosen to fastening the struc-
ture, like the corner ﬁttings, T bolts, and ﬂange nuts.
2. Manufacturing the functional structures
In fact, to functional structure, the material selecting and the production pro-
cessing will affect the reliability of the experimental results. Hence, it should be
developed in cooperation with professional manufacturers, aimed to achieve
mass production with low cost and high generality. The test platform includes
Research on Design and Application of Vehicle Simulation …

several functional structures, which were chosen from different types of car
seats, steering wheel assembly, and car pedals.
3. Setting up adjustment structures
There are three kinds of adjustment mechanisms in the automobile seat test
platform (Fig. 2). ①shows a high degree of adjustments, and ②and ③show
the position adjustments.
4. Setting up the installation method
In order to ensure those different functional structures can be exchanged each
other in the test platform, the same installation methods are adopted. For the test
platform, the cushion assembly and the backrest assembly are ﬁxed by bolt
connection on to the supporting structure. In addition, the car seat has been set
with two proﬁles, and each section is ﬁxed by two bolts. The steering wheel and
pedals are ﬁxed directly on the ground by the customized pipe. Figure 4 shows
the ﬁnal equipment.

Application of the Driving Simulation Test Platform
Due to the advantage of stimulation driving test platform, students will use ergo-
nomic knowledge, such as human body static size, sitting physiology, and
mechanics, to adjust the height, depth, scale parameters, angle position of seat back,
and other operating equipment. Simultaneously, it can combine with the body
pressure distribution test and SEMG testing to give evaluation to the ergonomics
interaction [4]. Then, in the perspectives of convenience and comfort of operation,
the test object will be created by the experimental data.

It is the key factor that whether driver’s motion is comfortable in the design of
human–machine interface. The aim of this experiment is to study relevant
knowledge of seat comfort requirements for drivers and to understand the
inﬂuencing factors about human body size for product design, so as to guide the
practical design.

Application of Fault Tree Analysis
for Safety Evaluation About Coal Dust
Explosion in Coal Mine
Yan Li, Sen Yang and Jianping Jiang
Abstract The aim was to abate the casualty, wealth loss, and frequency of coal
mine accident and to understand the pathogenesis, inﬂuencing factor, and the
hazard of coal dust explosion, which is one of the major accidents in coal mine.
Take Shen Bao surface coal mine for example. Fault tree analysis is used to make
the careful analysis of the basic events leading to the accident under the production
system and the hazard of the coal mine production system. On the basis of it, we put
forward the classiﬁcation of the coal dust explosion hazard and construct mathe-
matical functions, and calculating the occurring probability of the top event and
coal dust explosion data of minimum cut sets, minimum path sets. After all the
analyses, the results show that the more the basic events, the lower the probability
of their simultaneous occurrence in minimum cut sets, which means the lower
possibility of coal mine accident. Also we give the safety recommendations on the
basis of conclusion that the hazard is mainly on coal mine gas explosion, sponta-
neous combustion of coal, and high concentration of oxygen.

from nearly 7000 people to less than a thousand people today, but there are still
some major coal mine accidents.
Not only the production of coal has been restricted, but also heavy casualties and
huge economic losses have been caused by the coal dust explosion. Therefore, the
coal dust explosion accident is still the focus areas of accident control. Based on
this, take Shen Bao surface coal mine for example; using fault tree analysis method,
this paper analyzes the hazard of coal dust explosion accidents in coal mines.
There are some articles about using the fault tree analysis method to evaluate the
enterprise security in the world. K. Brik investigated the fault tree analysis in
theory; he believes that the fault tree analysis method provides a framework that can
analysis all the accident event combination cause the occurrence of accidents
deductively [1]. Ibrahim Akgün studied the application of fault tree analysis in
disaster management, and he thinks that the fault tree analysis can signiﬁcantly
divide hazard into different levels of risk [2]. Lindhe Andreas reckons that by the
results of fault tree analysis, we can compare performance goal with acceptable
level of risk effectively [3].
Fault tree analysis method has gone through a great development in the theory
and application level in China. Bu Quanmin thinks that the fault tree analysis
method can determine the order of measures to control each basic event and can
contribute to formulate a targeted and practical safety control plan [4]. Wang
Houjun’s study on the coal mine ﬂood obtain that there are 35 basic events in
minimum set that can prevent the coal mine ﬂood from occurring, and put forward
the best approach to eliminate coal mine ﬂood according to the results of the
analysis [5]. Xu Jiangtao combined the fault tree analysis method and qualitative
analysis and quantitative analysis based on computer programming and research on
application of fault tree analysis in coal mine ﬂood prevention, and put forward
effective advice about the prevention of coal mine ﬂood [6].
Although the number of literature for colliery enterprises safety evaluation is
currently large, most scholars used experimental measurement method to do
research on the coal mine dust explosion. Yang Shuzhao systematically studied coal
dust explosion in conﬁned space propagation rules and accident damage charac-
teristics by experimental testing, theoretical analysis, and numerical simulation
methods [7]. Based on this, take Shen Bao surface coal mine for example, and this
paper measures the probability of top event in coal dust explosion, minimum cut
sets, and the minimal path sets and provides suggestions and countermeasures for
coal enterprises’ safety evaluation.

The Construction of Fault Tree
2.1
General Overview of Shen Bao Surface Coal Mine
Shen Bao Energy Co., Ltd, main mine, is located between the State Road 301 and
Hailahei provincial road. The company has 23 tons of resources, and the
state-approved productivity is 35 million tons per year. The company owns two sets
of ground production system currently, and its coal crushing productivity is 5000
tons per hour. In terms of transport, it has 23 km private railway line.
2.2
The Construction of Fault Tree
Coal mine dust is mainly from the following several ways: (1) transport operations,
(2) blasting operation, (3) mining equipment operation, (4) the process of drilling
dust, and (5) dump and slope cleaning dust.
From ﬁeld investigation, we can know the risk sources of Shen Bao coal mine
are car dust, road dust deposition, dust generated from coal mining process, blasting
dust and drilling perforating, and so on.

Fault Tree Analysis
3.1
Calculation of Minimum Cut Set
A cut set is a set of events that can make a top event happen. If all of the basic
events included happen, then the top event is bound to occur. The minimal cut set is
deﬁned as the set of minimum probability events that cause the occurrence of top
event of the fault tree.
With a simpliﬁed fault tree, the minimum cut sets can be obtained after the fault
tree structure is simpliﬁed. With a non-simpliﬁed fault tree, the Boolean algebra
method is used to simplify the fault tree to obtain the structure function formula.
In this case, the minimal cut sets of the fault tree are as follows:

The minimum cut set group number is 150, and the equivalent fault tree
expressed by the minimum cut set is shown in Fig. 2.
From the minimum cut sets, 150 cut sets represent the coal dust explosion in 150
ways and represent the probability of occurrence of the top event.
3.2
Calculation of Minimum Path Set
When the basic events in the minimum path set obtained by calculation are all in
non-fault state, then the minimum path set is in non-fault state and the state of the
basic events in minimum path set can directly determine the state of the minimum
path set. A success tree is a fault tree consisting of all the minimum path set. As

659

long as the “AND” and “OR” logic gates in the fault tree get mutual exchanged, we
can achieve the transformation of a success tree and a fault tree.
The solution of the minimum path set is as follows:
T00 ¼ X10 þ X20 þ M10 þ M20
¼ X10 þ X20 þ ðM30  M50  M40Þ þ ½ðX180  X190  X200  X210Þ þ M90 þ M100
¼ X10 þ X20
Thus, we can obtain 2 sets of minimum path sets:
P1 ¼ X1
f
g;
P2 ¼ X2
f
g
P1 and P2 represent the basic event X1 and basic event X2 that cannot cause the
occurrence of the top events in fault tree.
3.3
Structural Importance Analysis
The processing method of structural importance is varied, and the approximate
judgment method is used in this paper,
The results are listed as follows:
Iuð1Þ ¼ Iuð2Þ [ Iuð18Þ ¼ Iuð19Þ ¼ Iuð20Þ ¼ Iuð21Þ ¼ Iuð22Þ [ Iuð23Þ ¼ Iuð24Þ
¼ Iuð25Þ ¼ Iuð26Þ ¼ Iuð27Þ [ Iuð8Þ [ Iuð3Þ ¼ Iuð4Þ ¼ Iuð5Þ ¼ Iuð6Þ ¼ Iuð7Þ
¼ Iuð8Þ [ Iuð9Þ ¼ Iuð10Þ ¼ Iuð11Þ ¼ Iuð12Þ ¼ Iuð13Þ ¼ Iuð14Þ
¼ Iuð15Þ ¼ Iuð16Þ ¼ Iuð17Þ

Conclusion
1. From the fault tree in Fig. 1, we can see that the proportion of “OR” logic gates
is more than 90%. Thus, most of the basic events will lead to a upper event. For
example, insufﬁcient water injection time (X11) or insufﬁcient water injection
pressure (X10) will lead to coal seam water injection which has no effect (M6).
Compared with the “OR” logic gates, the proportion of “AND” logic gates is
only 10%, and only occurrence of every event will lead to a upper event. From
the proportion of the “AND” and “OR” gate, we can know the coal dust
explosion has a great probability of occurrence.
2. From Fig. 2, under the circumstances of all events in a cut path Ki that occurs
simultaneously, the dust explosion will happen. For example, in Ki, when the
coal spontaneous combustion (X20) basic event occurs, then detonate ﬁre source
660
Y. Li et al.

(M2) will happen, and when the dustproof facilities failure (X16) occurred, there
will be dust removal failure (M4) event. If X1 (coal dust is explosive) also
occurs at the same time with the above events, which is bound to happen, and
with X2 (oxygen) basic events, then it will eventually lead to the occurrence of
coal dust explosion (T0). In minimum cut set Ki, the more the basic events, the
less the probability that they occur simultaneously, which means a lower chance
to lead to a top event. In contrast, the probability of the occurrence of the top
event will be greater.
3. Through the structural importance analysis, we can see that basic events X1, X2,
X18, X19, X20, X21, and X22 have a relatively larger degree of structural
importance; thus, we can obtain that the main hazard of Shen Bao coal mine is
mine gas explosion, coal spontaneous combustion, and high concentration
of oxygen. Therefore, effective approach to prevent coal dust explosion of Shen
Bao coal mine is to reduce the sparks generated by impact friction of various
machinery and equipment, use of machinery and equipment according to reg-
ulations, and avoid detonate ﬁre source.

Network and Cooperation Performance
Yan Li, Jinhui Yu and Jianping Jiang
Abstract In order to reduce the coal mine accidents. From the point of scientiﬁc
cooperation, based on the social network theory, we explore the relationship
between the mine safety expert cooperation network and the cooperation perfor-
mance. Using the method of questionnaire investigation, we take the enterprise
security management specialist as issue objects. SPSS19.0 software is used to make
the reliability and validity .On the basis of it,we use multiple-stepwise regression
analysis method to study the effect of the expert cooperation network on cooper-
ation performance. After all the analyses, the results show that network centrality,
network density, structural holes, ties trength are negatively correlated with coop-
eration performance. Results show that network cooperation, network centrality,
network density, structural holes, and relationship strength were negatively corre-
lated with cooperation performance.

Introduction
The coal mine safety accident is highly dangerous and uncontrollable and has
brought great difﬁculty to the national control and the government regulation [1].
Effective cooperation between coal mine safety experts can help solve the above
coal mine safety issues [2]. Coal mine safety expert network belongs to the ﬁeld of
safety science and technology experts in the form of a social network [3]. Luis
de-Marcos [4], using social network theory, found that social network facilitates

communication and cooperation among students and facilitates the improvement of
academic achievement. Dao Cheng-hong, Shen Liang [5] have found that applying
social networks to the ﬁeld of knowledge cooperation can help improve the overall
performance level and maximize cooperation outcomes. Militano [6] deﬁnes the
meaning of network centrality in social network structure and proposes that the
degree of network centralization can improve the team’s creativity.
This paper uses the social network analysis method, taking the social network as
the independent variable, and the cooperation performance as the dependent vari-
able, so as to systematically analyze and verify how the coal mine safety experts
interact with each other and enhance the cooperative performance of the coopera-
tive network.

Research Assumptions
2.1
Social Networks and Collaboration Performance
Li Mengnan, Jia Zhenquan (2014) think that the social network is a relatively stable
contact system, which is made up of the population, also it is a kind of social
capital. From the social network theory, from weak to strong connection process is
the process of social capital development. Based on scholars’ research on social
networks, this paper divides social networks into four dimensions: network cen-
trality, network density, structural holes, and relationship strength.
This paper uses Ganesan’s view to deﬁne cooperative performance as follows:
Since the establishment and continuous development of cooperative relations,
experts tend to inject more costs to achieve the desired objectives and get more
comprehensive beneﬁts.
2.2
Relationship Between Social Network and Cooperative
Performance
1. Network centricity and cooperative performance
The degree of network centrality represents the level of convergence or cen-
tralization of the entire network. The higher the network centricity of a network, the
stronger the degree of its concentration and the more frequent the interaction
between members. If more experts are in a central position in social network, it is
conducive to the improvement of cooperative performance. Based on this, the
following assumption is made:
664
Y. Li et al.

H1: The degree of network centricity in the coal mine expert network has a positive
effect on the cooperative performance
2. Network density and cooperative performance
Network density is used to represent the level of interconnection between nodes
in the network [7]. Coal mine safety experts cooperative network can help experts
connect. The more intimate the relation is, the more communication among experts,
it can make more effective resources, which more likely to improve the perfor-
mance. Therefore, the following assumption is made:
H2: The network density has a positive effect on the cooperative performance in the
coal mine expert network
3. Structural holes and cooperative performance
The structural holes refer to a gap between two nodes in the network. The greater
the number of structural holes, the less repetitive of resources. The experts in the
structural holes position in the network control the ﬂow of resources of other nodes
and also help to improve the utilization of resources, and ultimately improve the
performance of coal mine experts. Thus, the following assumption is made:
H3: The structural holes in the coal mine expert cooperation network has a positive
effect on the cooperative performance
4. Relationship strength and cooperation performance
Relationship strength refers to the frequency of communication between experts,
generally through the length of time between each other communication, network
density, emotional afﬁnity, mutual trust, and interaction dimensions. Therefore,
Strong tie has reﬂects the characteristics of the-network to a certain extent. The
experts relationship become more and more close, and at the same time, the
cooperation to be strengthened day by day. Thus, the following assumption is
made:
H4: The intensity of relationship in coal mine expert cooperation network has a
positive effect on cooperative performance

Reliability and Validity Analysis of Questionnaire
This study needed to analyze the reliability and validity of the social network scale
and cooperative performance scale.
Research on the Relationship Between Coal Mine …
665

3.1
Social Network Scale
The reliability of social network scale was tested. The overall reliability of the scale
was 0.829. The reliability of the four dimensions network centrality, network
density, structural holes, and relationship strength was 0.781, 0.747, 0.733, and
0.775, respectively, which means the social network scale has a better internal
consistency of the data; and the CITC value of the items was greater than 0.4,
indicating that the scale has a good reliability.
The KMO coefﬁcient was 0.755 and the Bartlett sphere test had a p value of
0.000, which is signiﬁcant to indicate that it is appropriate to do the factor analysis,
in order to judge the KMO sample value and the Bartlett sphere test value. Then,
principal component analysis and maximum variance rotation were used to analyze
the data. The results show that the total variation is 70.361%, the network centrality,
network density, structural holes, ties-trength explained 69.597%, 66.437%,
65.298% and 69.847% of the total variation [8].
3.2
Cooperative Performance Scale
The reliability of the performance scale was analyzed. The total reliability of the
scale was 0.824, which was higher than 0.7, which indicates that the cooperative
performance scale has a good reliability. The results of KMO and the Bartlett
sphere test showed that the KMO value of the cooperative performance scale was
0.738, greater than 0.7, and the signiﬁcance level of Bartlett’s sphere test was 0.000,
indicating that the test passed. There is a strong correlation between the data of the
cooperative performance scale, so the cooperative performance scale is effective.

Data Analysis
4.1
Correlation Analysis of Social Network and Cooperation
Performance
There is a signiﬁcant positive correlation between social network and cooperative
performance, which the signiﬁcance level less 0.01, and the correlation coefﬁcient
was 0.621. The relative deviation greater than 0.5 and less 0.8. It shows that the
level of social network has a signiﬁcant impact on the cooperative performance.
The signiﬁcant positive correlation between network centricity and cooperative
performance, the coefﬁcient was 0.642, so the study conﬁrmed H1. Also the net-
work density, structural holes, ties trength all have signiﬁcant positive correlation
between cooperative performance, the coefﬁcient respectively was 0.691, 0.954,
0.611, the results supported the hypothesis H2, H3, H4 (Table 1).
666
Y. Li et al.

4.2
Regression Analysis of Social Network and Cooperative
Performance
The independent variable and dependent variable were used to carry out linear
regression of the network centrality. The multiple stepwise regression results are
shown in Table 2.
It can be seen from Table 2 that the adjusted coefﬁcient of determination (ad-
justed R2) was 0.753, indicating that 75.3% of the explanatory variables can be
explained by the model. The observed value of F test statistic is 45.271. The linear
relationship between explanatory variables cooperative performance and network
centrality, network density, structural holes, and relationship strength is signiﬁcant.
A linear model can be used to describe and reﬂect on the relationship between them.
It can be seen from Table 3 that (1) the explanatory variables network center
degree, network density, structural holes, and relationship strength have a signiﬁ-

Results and Discussion
1. The network center degree of coal mine safety expert cooperation network has a
signiﬁcant positive effect on cooperative performance. This shows that in sci-
entiﬁc collaboration, security experts have to be very high social status, they
enjoy more network relations and social resource, others are willing to meet the
demands of cooperation. This cooperation is also a process of network learning
among experts.
2. The network density of coal mine safety expert network has a signiﬁcant pos-
itive effect on cooperative performance. Frequent network connection is to the
optimal allocation of resources, it promotes dissemination of information and
resource ﬂow, which can makes the relationship of experts become harmonious
by communicating frequently. Fom another angle, it more conducive to coop-
eration efﬁciency.
3. The structural holes of coal mine safety expert network has a signiﬁcant positive
effect on cooperative performance. Coal mine safety expert has more structural
holes, and the ability to absorb, utilize, share, and innovate is more stronger.
Only experts in structural holes can ensure resources and information in the
cooperation network; in order to ensure the healthy development of the entire
cooperative network, network cooperation in the performance of experts can be
improved. Therefore, increasing the number of structural holes has a signiﬁcant
positive effect on improving the efﬁciency of coal mine safety expert coopera-
tion network.
4. The relationship strength of coal mine safety expert network has a signiﬁcant
positive effect on cooperative performance. This shows that the longer inter-
action time, the more emotional intimately. It gets more opportunities for
cooperation. This relationship can help each other, it is important to enhance the
efﬁciency of network cooperation.

Introduction
In the new situation, the rapid formation of combat effectiveness of people and
equipment is the most important task; it can directly affect the outcome of future war,
whose role is critical. Military training is a normalized work and training effect
directly affects the familiarity and ability of people and equipment, leading the speed
of formation of combat effectiveness; thus, a reasonable assessment of training
effectiveness is very important [1]. Assessment is an important system in the military
training work. It is a very direct and effective means to evaluate the effect of the
training, because it can understand the situation, check the effect, summarize the
experience, and promote the training. The development of assessment standards

helps to uniform the training standards and measure the individual and unit level to
master skills comprehensively, so as to enhance the overall combat effectiveness.
This paper focuses on the study of basic requirements for the development of
assessment standards and the relevant provisions, to lay the theoretical basis for the
development of assessment standards of speciﬁc subjects.
2
The Purpose and Basic Requirements
for the Development of Assessment Standards
2.1
The Purpose
Military training assessment standards are formulated based on military training
syllabus, regulations, and the relevant provisions of the tutorial, in accordance with
actual combat requirements; combined with the actual development of military
training, it is the basic basis of grass-roots units and institutions to assess military
training performance.
The purpose of the assessment standards is to unify the army’s training quality
standards, to examine the degree that trainees master the subject accurately, to
measure individuals and units’ total score of a period of training comprehensively,
to promote comprehensive training to guide the training to the good development,
to enhance the ability of people and equipment, to improve the overall combat
capability, and to strengthen the grass-roots units of regular construction.
2.2
Basic Requirements
Development of assessment criteria should not be blind, subjective, and should
comply with certain requirements, so as to measure performance and check the
effect of the effect. The basic requirements for the development of assessment
standards are as follows:
First, implement the rules and regulations, orders, tutorials, and training pro-
grams’ standards strictly;
Second, start from the actual combat and depend on the situation, such as combat
missions and combat targets, combat missions in the region, so as to give promi-
nence to importance;
Third, insist on the rules strictly and difﬁcultly, make requirements reasonably,
make a comprehensive consideration of the tactical, technical, and other aspects;
Fourth, seek for truth based on facts scientiﬁcally and reasonably; the standard
should be able to effectively reﬂect the level of training and play an evaluation role.

3
Principles to Develop Assessment Standards
3.1
The Systematic Principle
Assessment standards should be able to reﬂect the overall assessment and evalu-
ation of the overall level of training. From the horizontal point of view, the
assessment criteria should reﬂect the assessment of the subject time, accuracy,
proﬁciency, action of the normative, rapid, and security; from the vertical point of
view, assessment standards should be sufﬁcient to reﬂect the dynamic development
of training process, Evaluation of the performance and effectiveness can not only
reﬂect the previous training, but also be able to guide and improve the future
training, so as to make the training meaningful and effective [2].
3.2
The Guiding Principle
To ensure that the assessment results are scientiﬁc and effective, the development of
assessment standards should have a strong orientation role. Assessment standards
should be as simple and clear as possible with a small amount of indicators and
concise language summary to reﬂect the purpose of the assessment and enhance the
orientation, making the assessment of the subject and object easy to understand and
accept, to ensure that the examination standards can check the pre-training effect
and guide the latter part of the training methods, to enhance the practicality of
overall assessment standards.
3.3
The Theoretical Principle
The development of assessment standards should be guided by the scientiﬁc the-
oretical basis. For the grass-roots units of equipment training, assessment standards
must be closely integrated with the characteristics of equipment, so as to study
in-depth; the development should refer to the manufacturer’s engineers’ technical
advice, combined with the unit training, combat, and other applications of tactical
requirements, on this basis to develop rigorously and scientiﬁcally after the com-
prehensive measurement.
3.4
The Practical Principle
Assessment criteria should be based on a solid foundation for practice. The ﬁnal
purpose of the development of assessment standards for the grass-roots units
Study on the Standard of Military Training Examination
673

training and institutions of teaching services, and the development of standards
must be prior to the assessment of the equipment in a large number of practical
applications, to conduct a large number of experiments to training data and actual
training data as the basis for scientiﬁc development.
3.5
The Operational Principle
Assessment standards should be developed with a strong maneuverability as the
goal. Assessment criteria should have a strong maneuverability and strive to
achieve the assessment criteria to be comparable and reﬂect the common attributes
of different assessment objects once enacted, to enhance the practical value of the
standard. And resolutely put an end to the phenomenon such as that the assessment
criteria lack of strong operability, deﬁned fuzzy, and unclear expression [3].
4
Performance Evaluation in the Assessment Standards
Performance evaluation in the assessment standards takes the ﬁve-point system
generally, with four levels of assessment; the overall score takes the average score,
4.5–5 points means excellent, 3.8–4.4 points means good, 3–3.7 points means
passing, and below 3 points means not passing. Speciﬁc grading standards for each
level should be further analysis and research due to the different assessment subjects
and different job requirements.
In military training, a single examination subject generally according to time and
accuracy to make a comprehensive assessment results. The criteria are as follows:
If there are three grade standards (excellent, good, pass) according to the
accuracy and time, then take the average score of the two results, but the result is
not allowed to be higher than the accuracy grade.
If there is only one grade standard according to the accuracy (time) and there are
three grade standards according to the time (accuracy), then we evaluate perfor-
mance according to time (accuracy) on the basis that the accuracy (time) is up to
standard, and if the accuracy (time) is not up to standard, then the result is not
passing.
If there is only one grade standard according to both the accuracy and time, then
we claim it passing when both are up to standard.
If the number of not passing is more than half, then we claim it not passing in
comprehensive performance.

Conception to Develop Assessment Criteria
In order to effectively enhance the scientiﬁc and targeted assessment criteria, an
appropriate assessment system should be established, to rich assessment methods
and improve the assessment results, to make plans and design for speciﬁc criteria of
the assessment [4].
5.1
Establishing Assessment System, Making Records
for the Examination Results Systematically
First is to inspect the effectiveness of military training comprehensively, make the
assessment throughout the military training and the whole process of military
training; second, we must systematically record the results of the assessment, to
make a comparative analysis of the previous assessment results and assessment
criteria, so as to comprehensively grasp of the situation; third, we must play a
guiding role, using the examination system to urge the promotion of military
training to improve combat effectiveness.
5.2
Enriching Assessment Methods, Scientiﬁcally
Improving the Assessment Process
There is some specialty, complexity in some subjects in military training, which
requires the use of a variety of means, comprehensive training on the compre-
hensive assessment. First, we must play an important role in professional assess-
ment, and assessment for complex subjects must increase the intensity of positive
assessment; second, we must play a supplementary role of periodic random
assessment to see the natural training performance of trainees in the case of no
preparation, to see whether there is the existence of slack off behavior, to increase
the intensity of reverse assessment [5]; third, we must use assessment tools rea-
sonably to identify obstacles to enhance the training level of deep-seated reasons, to
increase technical assessment efforts, so that we can make the assessment criteria
purposeful.
5.3
Make the Assessment Effective, Improve
the Mechanism of the Use of Results
To make the assessment standards play its role effectively, so that the results of the
assessment program can be the primary basis to adjust the training as well as the
Study on the Standard of Military Training Examination
675

important means of measuring the effectiveness of training. First, we should expand
the scope of the use of assessment results appropriately in order to better play an
active role in the assessment criteria; second, the assessment results should be a
feedback to the relevant departments in an appropriate form, to improve the unit and
personnel awareness, make the trainees themselves have objective evaluation on
their own performance and existent problems. Thus, they form a catch-up atmo-
sphere where they promote each other and improve together to further improve the
ability of people and equipment integration, so as to form combat effectiveness.

Introduction
The future warfare is an informationized one as well as a confrontation between
systems. Such confrontation gives not only test on weapons and equipment and
combatants but also the maximization of the efﬁciency of the whole system
involving the combat environment. First, the theoretical development needs to be
proved by practice. The system engineering theory is one of the core theories to
promote the system efﬁciency. Secondly, the development of weapons and equip-
ment needs to be examined by practice. With the application of science and tech-

nology in military ﬁeld, the weapons and equipment develop dramatically. Whether
the weapons and equipment achieve the goal or not needs practical test. Finally, the
new technology, new craft, and new method should be applied in practice. The
training ground and military exercise area are the optimal site for practical exam-
ination. A large amount of data pertaining man, machine, and environment should
be collected to forecast every possible change in the future battleﬁeld, which
provides reliable theoretical and data support for future warfare. Therefore, the
construction of ﬁeld Man-Machine-Environment monitoring cabin is advanced in
this paper.

Realistic Signiﬁcance
2.1
Practical Need for Man-Machine-Environment
System Engineering
Man-Machine-Environment system engineering is an engineering technology,
which reveals the relationship between man, machine, and environment by use of
system engineering ideas and methods and ensures an optimal combination of
Man-Machine-Environment system engineering [1]. The study of Man-Machine-
Environment system makes a qualitative description of the mutual effects between
man, machine, and environment as well as the quantitative analysis of the exact
relationship between the three. Since each one of the three has its own character-
istics and assessment criteria, a portable and integrated equipment is thus needed to
measure man, machine, and environment, respectively, for supporting the com-
prehensive assessment system. An integrated ﬁeld Man-Machine-Environment
cabin can be taken as an helpful approach.
2.2
Practical Need for Military Ergonomics
Military Ergonomics is the speciﬁc application of ergonomics in military. It adopts
the theory of systems science and the method of system engineering to design and
research the optimum combination option of Man-Machine-Environment system in
consideration
of
interaction
of
man,
machine,
and
environment
in
Man-Machine-Environment system. With the modernization of national defense,
the weapons and equipment become more and more informationized, digitized,
automated, and complicated. “Serviceman-Weaponry-Military activity environ-
ment” system turns to be more complex [2]. The construction of the integrated ﬁeld
Man-Machine-Environment cabin is the application of Military Ergonomics as well
as its practical need.
678
Z. Pang et al.

2.3
Need for Full Service Life Study of Weaponry
The life cycle of weaponry includes the whole process of argumentation, research
and development, manufacturing, experiment, employment, storage, scrapping, etc.
[3]. The weaponry varies in life cycle due to their different nature, function, and
complexity. Just like human life, it could be divided into the ﬁrst half and the latter
half of its life.
The ﬁrst half of its life is given to conduct argumentation of the program,
engineering research, and manufacturing. In this phase, man-oriented idea should
be stressed as human property, human cognition, human training level, and skill
criteria in various operating environments, that is, “machine adapting to man and
environment” [4].
The latter half of his life is used for employment, support, and decommission. In
this phase, machine-oriented idea should be stressed as machine’s property, tech-
nical and tactical performance, conﬁguration, and adaption to the environment, that
is, “man adapting to machine and environment” [4].
In these two phases, the measurement and assessment of man, machine, and
environment are the basic starting point. Furthermore, the individual weapons
and equipment are located at different places during research, development, and
employment. A single measuring equipment could not satisfy the requirement of
the whole weapon system. To construct an integrated ﬁeld, Man-Machine-
Environment cabin will bring convenience for study of the two adaptations.
2.4
Need for Upgrading Combat Effectiveness
At present, the forces are required to ﬁrmly establish combat effectiveness as the
sole fundamental criterion [5]. Thus, the training is oriented to the combat. The
combat effectiveness is cultivated from the initial training on training ground, then
the rehearsal at military exercise site, and is ﬁnally presented in the future battleﬁeld
through operations with live ammunition. From the training ground to the future
battleﬁeld, the combatants, weapon system, and combat environment undergo great
change and bear close connection among them. The upgrading of the combat
effectiveness depends on both hard and scientiﬁc training. The training process
should be elaborated for qualitative and quantitative research and planning. The
combatants, weapon system, and combat environment should be closely monitored
to obtain the effects of the three factors on the combat effectiveness so as to provide
strong support for effectively and comprehensively upgrading the combat
effectiveness.

Basic Function
How to enhance the organic integration of man, machine, and environment and to
fully improve the whole combat effectiveness has become the focus of military
research around the world. Man-Machine-Environment monitoring cabin is mainly
used to monitor and analyze the adaptation of man to equipment, of man to
environment, of equipment to environment as well as degree of fatigue and combat
performance during training. The monitoring cabin consists of human life
data-monitoring subsystem, weaponry running data-monitoring subsystem, combat
environment data-monitoring subsystem, comprehensive data processing and ana-
lyzing
subsystem,
information
communication
subsystem,
auxiliary
decision-making and decision-supporting subsystem.
3.1
Human Life Data-Monitoring Function
Human life data cover a wide range and their data-collecting and data-monitoring
methods are diversiﬁed. Therefore, the data will be focused on pulse, heart rate,
breath, body temperature, oxyhemoglobin saturation, posture, time, and geo-
graphical data according to combat conditions and requirements. These data will be
collected to analyze the vital signs and current posture of servicemen and assess
their vitality. The variation of spatial position of the sensors is used to analyze the
labor intensity and infer the degree of fatigue and working performance.
Meanwhile, the human life data are collected by contacting the measured man. The
miniaturization of sensors and data remote transmission should be taken into
consideration during research. In connection with microsensors and Internet of
Things, all the instrument and devices to be used should be thoroughly analyzed
and optimized in accordance with the operational requirement of the military forces.
3.2
Weaponry Running Data-Monitoring Function
Themodernweaponsandequipment areofhighlevelofintegrationwithperfectcombat
function. Yet, the complicated operation of weapons makes high demand on the
adaptability of man to weapons and of weapons to environment. As a result, the forces
could not bring weaponry into full play. In order to improve the utilization efﬁciency of
weaponry, it is necessary to monitor its running data. The quantitative statistic analysis
may draw scientiﬁc basis to guide forces’ combat and training. The weaponry running
data to be monitored involve the basic performance data of weaponry, operations data,
weaponryoperatingdata,weaponry’srunningdatainvariousenvironment,etc.Bysuch
data collection and analysis, abstract regularity from mass data and work out the rele-
vance index so as to serve the weaponry in combat and training.
680
Z. Pang et al.

3.3
Combat Environment Data-Monitoring Function
The complicated modern battleﬁeld environment, esp. severe weather, and elec-
tromagnetic environment affect the informationized weaponry seriously. How to
enhance the environment adaptability of weaponry as well as how to guide its
employment becomes a hard nut to crack. The environment data to be monitored
involve air temperature, wind speed, rain and snow, sunlight, altitude, oxygen
content, salinity–alkalinity, dust, geomorphology, surface features, terrain, elec-
tromagnetic density and power, and civil considerations. By such data collection
and analysis, work out topography in area of operations so that data support is
provided for forces deployment and weaponry employment.
3.4
Synthetic Data Processing and Analyzing Function
Each subsystem of the cabin collects a diversiﬁed and large number of data. They
may be structured data or unstructured data. In order to increase data statistical and
analytical efﬁciency, an intelligentized data mining method has to be adopted. At
the same time, synthesize data processing and analyzing function of subsystems
according to requirements of modularized design. It may intensify cohesiveness on
the one hand and enhance data analyzing efﬁciency on the other hand.
3.5
Auxiliary Decision-Making and Decision-Supporting
Function
After collection, processing, and analysis of relevant data concerning man,
machine, and environment, this part is used to realize dynamic presentation so as to
make commanding ofﬁcers easily grasp the battleﬁeld situation in real time and
acquaint with the change of man, weaponry, and combat environment. It provides
strong data support for commanding ofﬁcers at each echelon to make a decision in a
scientiﬁc way.
3.6
Information Communicating Function
The data collected by each subsystem, after being preprocessed, are transmitted to
synthetic data processing and analyzing subsystem through corresponding infor-
mation transmission modules. The information communicating technology varies
depending on different monitoring objects. The vital signs data of human life are
transmitted by means of bluetooth or ZigBee technology, the weaponry data by
A Study on Field Man-Machine-Environment Monitoring Cabin
681

means of wiﬁor high-speed bus, and environment data by various communication
technologies according to different monitoring locations. Each monitoring sensors
apply terrestrial reference and time scale to the datum collected by use of BeiDou
navigation system, and then carry out data gathering by existing or military com-
munication means. In designing information communication subsystem, electro-
magnetic jamming and information countermeasures should be taken into
consideration. Small-power and close-range communication technology is recom-
mended in each local area network of sensors. In implementation of distant
transmission of data, the subsystem compatibility with current military communi-
cation technology has to be taken into account; especially, it could not jam the
military communication system and avoid self interference and mutual interference.
4
Conclusion
In accordance with Military Ergonomics, macrolevel, intermediate level, and
microlevel should be integrated [6]. In accordance with Man-Machine-Environment
system engineering theory, man, machine, and environment should be integrated.
Thus, a scientiﬁc and reasonable weapon system can be constructed, which meets
the need of future information warfare.
The ﬁeld Man-Machine-Environment monitoring cabin put forward in this paper
characteristic of information integration, small size, convenience, quickness, and
accuracy. It may achieve quick collection of Man-Machine-Environment data,
accurate and efﬁcient analysis, and judgment, which provide a scientiﬁc basis for
commanding
and
decision-making.

The performance assessment refers to the organization that will assess someone’s
capacity for work and his job performance in a scientiﬁc way regularly and irregularly,
according to the standard and the procedure, which has been drawn up in advance [2].
As a kind of management thought which emerges in recent years, it has a positive
effect in the military training management. The performance assessment can evaluate
the soldier’s service performance in a comprehensive way and provides the reference
for the work allocation and the position change. It can evaluate the whole process of
the speciﬁc training program, which can provide a basis for the improvement of the
training quality. As far as the individual is concerned, the training process can be

recorded in scientiﬁc way, which can help the trainee get aware of the weakness and
the mistake of the operation. The record can provide the data support for the devel-
opment of the accuracy and speed of the operation [3].

The Main Problems in the Training Assessment
As a special group, the military has used a traditional way to assess the military
training for a long time. But with the arrival of new military revolution, the military
has a huge change by means of the warfare operations, the military hardware, and
the ﬁghting operation, which has a new request for the purpose and ways of the
assessment and challenges the traditional military training assessment.
2.1
The Difference Between the Syllabus and Objective
Reality
At present, with the development of the new equipment performance, the equipment
requires a higher ability of operation and the weapon system needs more and more
indexes to evaluate. So the traditional index, which is relatively simple, cannot meet
the selected requirement. Meanwhile, the different index has the different proportion
in the weapon system. If the indexes are made equally, the assessment will lose the
objectivity. For example, in the process of the operation, there is a conﬂict between
the precision standard and the speed standard, but the syllabus does not explicitly
show the judgment basis of this situation, which has troubles in judging the situation.
In the view of the military reality, it is difﬁcult to set up the proportion objectively
and scientiﬁcally. The standard of the selection mostly depends on the personal
experience of the interviewer, which is not judged comprehensively and objectively.
And the assessment result is affected by the personal will, which has an inﬂuence on
the objectivity of the assessment in some extent.
2.2
The Difference Between the Assessment Procedure
and the Practice
With the development of the new equipment, the operator must meet the require-
ments of the different equipment and the different position. But the most syllabuses
are classiﬁed into four types, such as excellent, good, pass, fail. The syllabus is
classiﬁed in a careless way, which makes a difference between the four types and
cannot show the ﬁnal results of the assessment. When the difference reaches a level
which makes peoples in a low spirit, it will weaken the motivation of the training [4].
684
X. Li et al.

2.3
The Difference Between the Training Methods
and the Progressive Ideas
The traditional training ways came from the training and wars, which concord with
the actual situation and the background in our army. As time goes, the battleﬁeld
environment has changed a lot than ever before and the military ideas have renewed
constantly and require the new challenges and methods for the military training.
The traditional training aimed to improve the ability of human being, and then
performed the task after adjusting the environment. But so far, all kinds of the
equipment are developed, especially the complex weapon system displayed, whose
adaptabilities vary with all kinds of complicated environments. If the training
practices in a relatively peaceful environment, the disadvantages are obviously
shown and it is not good for the training. At the same time, in the process of
training, the operator always considers how to improve the quality of the training
and the weapons and the environments in which the weapons are practiced are
neglected. The simple and necessary renovation of the weapons and the operational
environments will make the training get twice the result with half the effort. Thus,
in order to improve the training efﬁciency, the operator, the weapon equipment, and
the operational environment should be taken into comprehensive consideration.
2.4
The Difference Between the Assessment Results
and the Assessment Progress
At present, the results lead to the assessment of the weapon operation, and what the
assessment needs is the operation meets the standard. The trainer thinks highly of
the results and neglects the process, which will cause the operator to pay more
attention to the results when they operate the weapon. This will make the operator
pursue the speed without goals, act and operate against the procedure, which is
harm to the weapons, and deviate the original purpose.
3
The Characteristic of the Performance Assessment
With the arrival of the new military revolution, the huge changes occur to the means
of the military battle, the weapons, and the way of the military battle. There need to
be a lot of improvement in setting up the system of the training performance
assessment. So how to adapt to the various military task and to practice the efﬁcient
training of the equipment operation still need to be completed in drawing up the
standard of the training assessment. According to the quality principle of the army
building, it is of great practical signiﬁcance to establish a scientiﬁc and reasonable
The Study of the Performance Assessment in Military Training
685

evaluation system, to measure the equipment training, and to evaluate the sus-
tainable development ability of the equipment [5].
3.1
The Standardization of the Performance Assessment
The ﬁrst step is to make the assessment procedure and to introduce the operational
factor. In order to assess the performance, the organizers must design a set of
procedures to achieve the goals. In other words, this set of procedures is regarded as
the standard of the assessment performance, so that the difference in different times
can be assessed in a scientiﬁc way.
3.2
The Speciﬁcation of the Assessment
The second step is to assess scientiﬁcally and to reﬂect the results of the task. The
performance assessment is an evaluation process, which instructs whether and how
to achieve a goal. The information that is from the operator’s operation shows the
performance assessment of the operator’s. The performance assessment is used at
the results of the task operation.
3.3
The Scientiﬁc Management
The last step is the quantitative management. The present performance should be
managed in a scientiﬁc and quantitative way. The performance assessment need
continues to test, to record, and to analyze, which are the basis for the improvement
of the performance assessment and the selection of the operator. At the same time,
the present data can predict the operator’s operation in other situation and the
results of the performance assessment.
4
The Application of the Performance Assessment
The performance assessment is used as the main idea, which is applied in the
military training and can play a positive and useful role.
686
X. Li et al.

4.1
Improve the Methods and the Quality of the Training
Drawn up scientiﬁcally, the standard of the performance assessment is not only the
performance assessment of the operation, but also the standard of the assessment,
which can instruct the standard of training. And the methods of the training based
on the performance assessment will come into being. The effective way to improve
the quality of the training is to transfer the single subject based on the result control
into the combination of the result control and the process control. In the whole
process, the operator’s operation and the quality of the team training can be
instructed at present. The various problems can be coordinated and solved timely in
the process of the training. Meanwhile, the weakness has been recorded by the
video and the corresponding training will be applied, which not only quantiﬁes the
operation result, but also speciﬁes the process of the operation. This can provide
the basis for the improvement of the manipulator operation, and calculate and
record the team and the operator’s performance assessment. Compared horizontally
and vertically, this also can show the status of the mastery of the operator. The
analysis of the situation is beneﬁcial to improve the overall standard of the operator
and the military team training.
4.2
Control the Training Process and Balance
the Development of the Whole
In the course of the process, the assessment promotes the training because the
subject will be assessed after one subject and the team will be trained after one
team. This ensures that the training quality of the single subject and the single team
is in accordance with the performance standards. At the same time, the army
adheres to the traction of the goal and tries the best to improve the quality of the
training. The high quality standard of the soldiers and the high ambition of the
soldiers can make the soldiers compare, learn, catch up with and help each other
during the new equipment training to make sure that the new equipment can be able
to move to a regular basis quickly and become the military hardware.
4.3
Achieve the Performance Management Select
the Operator
The main idea of the performance assessment is to improve the operation standard
of the operator by quantizing the training process so as to improve the performance
assessment of the organization and the team. It provides a simple and standard
platform for the scientiﬁc management. The various models of the operation per-
formance assessment are studied in a scientiﬁc way, which can make the

management of the operation skill scientiﬁc, timely, and accurately. This also can
make the management of the military training scientiﬁc, timely, and accurately. The
selection of the operator and the excellent team building depend on the results of the
performance assessment.
5
Conclusion
In the process of the military assessment, the application of the performance
assessment can make commander pay more attention to the purpose and the pro-
gress of the training. By tracking the training progress, the army can take advan-
tages of the daily performance assessment timely to inspire, instruct, and help the
soldiers to improve the operation procedure and develop the ability of the operation,
which will contribute to improve the military battle capacity. Meanwhile, the
performance assessment can provide the objective training and the assessment
atmosphere, which play an important and positive role in developing the trainee’s
training.

Introduction
With the rapid development of equipment science, high-tech weapons have been
widely used in modern warfare. In order to comply with the trend of the times, a
series of new equipment, typically characterized by a high degree of information
and automation, began to gradually use in troops in a wide range of applications.
Most of these new equipment apply the modular design, so that a single equipment
is able to combine with many combat functions, which changes the situation that
usually a single operator operating into a new situation that an operational team
made of multi-people operate the equipment. How to scientiﬁcally train and assess

such complex weapon systems is an urgent problem. Performance evaluation, as a
management method, and its basic ideas can be applied to the training and
assessment of the troops. It can more objectively reﬂect the effectiveness of the
entire weapon system, including the effectiveness of the operator. Above all,
building the relevant model by the use of performance ideas is the core content of
the model [1].
2
Characteristics and Improvement of Existing
Performance Model
The existing performance model is based on the performance model of single
person operating one machine and records the actions “h” (number), the time “t”
(second), and the action error rate (percentage) when the operators complete an
operation, then according to the “accuracy/speed” weight given by relevant experts,
and the analysis of the error actions in operation, and ﬁnally get the performance of
the operation. The ﬁnal performance “E” of the team is as follows [2]:
E = PzmPrj 
X
N
n¼1
Wn
R 1  pn
ð
Þ
hntb


ð1Þ
The variables are as follows:
Pzm
In operation, if any of the operators in the team make mistake in key steps of
operation and cause the operation fail, the value is 0, if not, then the value is
1;
Prj
In operation, if the general errors made by operators exceed a certain degree
and cause the operation fail, the value is 0, if not, the value is 1;
N
The number of involved operators in the operation;
Wn
In operation, the n-th operator occupies the weight of the entire cooperative
operation;
R
The weight ratio between the operating accuracy and the operating speed;
pn
The failure rate of the n-th operator in operation;
hn
The time the n-th operator use to complete the operation;
tn
The number of actions the n-th operator have made.
2.1
Disadvantages of Existing Models
Because the factors in the model are not comprehensive, in the process of practical
application, there are more and more limitations, which are mainly shown as: The
existing model records the environmental conditions that the operators live in and
690
H. Zhao et al.

calculate the effects of environmental factors on the operator. The disadvantage is
that it is not proper to position the environmental impact of the operation perfor-
mance on the precision of operation. The reason is that the environment not only
has an impact on people, but also has an impact on the equipment, so the impact of
the environment should affect the overall performance of the operation [3].
2.2
The Idea of Improving the Model
In addition to increasing the environmental impact factors in the job performance
model, more comprehensive consideration should be given to operator. The fol-
lowing will improve the model in terms of the present problems from two aspects:
The ﬁrst is adding real-time monitoring to the heart rate of the operator. The
original model is one-sided to reﬂect the environmental impact from the errors on
operation. The effect of human adaptation to the environment can be used as an
effect on environmental impacts. In the future battleﬁeld, a variety of environmental
factors would change dramatically, so the physiological indexes can reﬂect the
inﬂuence of natural and social environment. Therefore, in the new model, the
real-time heart rate data are added to the operator, and compared to the calm heart
rate value [4], so as to get the effect of environmental factors.
The second is adding the inﬂuence of the operator’s knowledge assessment. New
equipment integration technology is more intensive; if the operator is just familiar
with the process of operation, and know nothing about the principle of operation,
then the fault possibly appeared will be difﬁcult for him to dispose of. Meanwhile,
due to the emphasis on the speed of operating, the operator may appear substandard
“barbaric operating.” Therefore, it will make the assessment more comprehensive to
add the inﬂuence of the knowledge assessment, which includes the assessment to
the operator’s familiarity with the operation standard [5], the equipment structure
and the monomer structure knowledge, etc.

The Construction of the Model for Multi-people
Operating One Machine
Construct the new model for multi-people operating one machine according to the
above idea of improvement.
The Construction of Performance Evaluation Model …
691

3.1
The Assumptions for Model
The assumptions for constructing a model for multi-people operating one machine
are as follows:
(1) Assuming that the operation errors of an operator cannot be remedied by
another operator;
(2) Assuming that the operator’s body is in good condition;
(3) Assuming that the operations performed are normative operations, and the
numbers of operations as well as the actions that different operators have made
keep in step;
(4) Assuming that the operator’s heart rate is higher than that of the calm during the
operation.
3.2
The New Variables
There are two new variables added in new model according to the idea of
improvement.
3.2.1
The Effect of Environmental Inﬂuence
The effectiveness of environmental inﬂuence is mainly calculated by the change of
the operator heart rate. The operator will have different physiological responses due
to different operating conditions. More positive the operator mood is, more strong
the body adaption to the environment is, more stable his body is, smaller the change
of heart rate in the numerical value is, and higher the relative value of performance
is. The method of calculation is:
XH ¼ bc
bzc
ð2Þ
Among it:
XH
The effectiveness of environmental inﬂuence;
bc
The average heart rate of the operator during operation;
bzc
The heart rate of the operator in the normal state before operation.
692
H. Zhao et al.

3.2.2
The Familiarity with Theoretical Knowledge
Before the operation, the operator need to attend an examination of theory ﬁrstly
and ﬁnish the subjects given by specialist. There are subjects (the same as the
number of actions), corresponding to each action. If error occurs, the deﬁnition of
the degree of familiarity with theoretical knowledge is:
LT ¼ a
h
ð3Þ
3.3
The Construction of the Model
According to the characteristics of multi-people operating one machine, the value of
the performance is inversely proportional to the environmental effect and is pro-
portional to the level of theoretical knowledge. The improved performance of the
model for single person operating one machine is:

Model Checking
Refer to a certain weapon system, the model is checked by using the data of the
ammunition loading in the ﬁring preparation. In the course of the experiment, some
parameters are collected in the actual operation, such as operating time, heart rate,
wrong movements, theoretical test scores.
4.1
The Introduction of Operation
The operation has three operators A, B, C. In the process of loading ammunition,
the process of operation is as follows: When operator B enters the cabin, then select
the appropriate time to start the electric machine after the completion of power;
operator A arranges the bullets chain and sets the sensor in the last bullet, then, with
the hook, pull the top of the chain from the position 1 to the position 2; At the same

time, the operator C timely adjusts the v and locks the structures 1 and 2 to prevent
the chain from slipping.
After analyzing the speciﬁc action of three operators, the expert scores. The ratio
of working accuracy and speed is 0.5, and the weight of the moves in operation is
shown in Table 1.

measured and recorded. The results are shown in Table 2.
According to the model, the results are shown in Table 3.
In this test, the ﬁrst group and the second group of operators are the old students
and new students, respectively, and the third group of operators is the professional
operator. Through the calculation and analysis of the data given by the model, the
ﬁnal performance results show that the new model can objectively reﬂect the
operating level differences of different operators.

Conclusion
Based on the performance model of the original multi-people operating one
machine, the paper analyzes the problems in the practical work, ensembles the
related theory of performance, and constructs the performance evaluation model for
multi-people operating one machine which can fully reﬂect the operating level of
different operation teams. And the model is checked by further practical exami-
nations for its practicality. It also provides the basis for the evaluation of the team
operation and facilitates for the selection of the operator.
Due to the limitation of the experimental conditions, the model is not tested in
the veriﬁcation, and the practicality of the model needs further examination and
improvement. There are still some subjective effects on some of the methods in the
model, which is the direction of next step to research.

Introduction
Man–machine integration throughout the life cycle of weapons and equipments
means adaptation in two facets: in the process of access, research, development,
manufacturing, and experimenting, to insist on human-oriented principal, with
consideration on basic human characteristics, cognition, and proﬁciency, and
consideration on standard for the representation of skill in different operating
situation, which simply means machine adapts itself to human; while after weapons
and equipments were deployed to units for training, employment, maintenance,
sustainment, repair, and retirement, to insist on machine-oriented principal, with
consideration on the basic characteristics, tactic and technical features, layout and
structure of the machine, which simply means human adapts itself to machine [1].

This paper explores how to exploit and maintain the capability of weapons and
equipments when they are deployed to unit, or in their latter half of life, and as
operators or maintainers how to realize human adaption to machine with
well-directed effort.

The Signiﬁcance of Man–Machine Integration Method
Research
2.1
Enable Weapons and Equipments with Operational
Capability Rapidly
Research on method of man–machine integration adopted systematic engineering
philosophy, with overall thinking and coordinated development, will fully exploit
the man–machine system capability and will facilitate the perfect integration of the
system, to enable weapons and equipments with operational capability rapidly.
2.2
Improve Reliability of Weapons and Equipments
Reliability requires no or few malfunctioning occurred in the employment of
equipment, and with long operational time [2]. Research on method of man–ma-
chine integration will help achieve best effectiveness of both man and machine
factors, to decrease the failure rate of weapon system, increase operational time, and
fully enhance reliability of the system.
2.3
Decrease the Expense on Weapons and Equipments
Throughout Their Lifecycle
Lifecycle expense refers to the overall cost on the whole process including access,
research, development, manufacture, employment, maintenance, and retirement of
equipment. Research on man–machine integration method will reduce the cost on
the process of equipment employment and maintenance, which results in reduce on
its life cycle expense.

2.4
Enhance Operational Capability of Military Forces
With man–machine integration method, misoperation accident can be reduced, and
personnel can be allocated properly as modern hi-tech warfare requires.
3
Speciﬁc Methods Adopted in Research
3.1
Select Operators in a Scientiﬁc Way
The employment and maintenance of equipment requires qualiﬁed operators, and
selection of operators is a prerequisite for training them to be highly qualiﬁed. With
excellent crewmen of appropriate capacity as different equipment post requires for
further training, multifold effects will be achieved with half the effort.
3.1.1
Clarify the Connotation of Operator Selection
Different types of equipment, and different posts of same equipment, require that
different operation action and embody different operation characteristics, and their
requirements on operator’s physical and mental status are differentiated [3]. The
connotation of operator selection is two-way selection, which means select the most
qualiﬁed personnel as operator, and assign operator the post that best for them, to
make full use of personnel and their capacity.
3.1.2
Construct a Mathematical Model for Operator Selection
Once the weapon design was approved, as different posts embody pertinency
requirements, it is necessary to establish mathematical model for operator selection
as per post characteristics and requirements. To construct the model, factor set,
weighted criteria set, and evaluation set need to be established as per post char-
acteristics require crewmen of their physical, mental, and intellectual status, and
change it from qualitative to quantitative, to facilitate the selection effort with more
operability.
3.1.3
Organize the Selection in a Scientiﬁc Way
The effort to select operators in a scientiﬁc way is to measure and evaluate the
physical and mental strength of the candidates and obtain the speciﬁc condition of

operator selection, perfect man–machine integration can be achieved, the system’s
efﬁciency and reliability can be increased, and the system’s best performance can be
expected.
3.2
Optimized Training of Operator
Optimized training of operator means optimizing the man–machine operating
procedure of the weapon system. To optimize the man–machine integration oper-
ating, multiple principals should be followed such as paralleled operating, econo-
mization of activity amount, simpliﬁcation of steps, comfortable posture of action,
best efﬁciency of whole operating action; gradually progress the effort in such facets
as subject activity analysis, action analysis, and timing; optimize operating method,
shorten operating time, and improve operating efﬁciency; formulate a scientiﬁc and
practical operating procedure for the weapon system [4].
3.2.1
Principal Line of Effort Analysis
The ﬁrst objective is to clarify those items as operation content, phases, connection
among phases, starting, ending, sequence, and principal line of effort. First, in view
of the content and purpose of the operating, analyze the operating procedure of the
vehicle units of the a new type of weapon system in its deployment phase to
determine the sequence of operating; second, differentiate the temporal and spatial
phases of the weapon system’s operating procedure, clarify the starting and ending
of phases, and create condition for the determination of the principal line of effort in
the whole process; third, in view of the system efﬁciency, choose the principal
vehicle unit deployment operation as the principal line of effort in the operating
process, and simply the operating procedure accordingly, to obtain the preliminary
outlook of the optimizing; fourth, based on the operator’s actions and their con-
nections, eliminate unnecessary connections with analysis, and prioritize the prin-
cipal line of effort for operators, preparing for the action analysis.
3.2.2
Action Analysis
Usually, with principal line of effort analysis to be conducted, on purpose of saving
time and manpower and safety in operating, action analysis is to ﬁnd out the right
operating actions, to eliminate inappropriate and unnecessary actions as per
machine structure and function, and human action characteristics. First, based on
the operating procedure of the principal vehicle unit crewmen of a new type of
weapon system, observe and record in detail, with the effort to coordinate operators’
timeline, and combine them together as a man–machine operating analysis chart
[5]. Second, according to principals in optimizing man–machine operating, the
700

possibility to improve the procedure depends on such three facets as follows:
paralleled operating of all operators; elimination of unnecessary running actions;
simpliﬁcation of command actions. Third, draft a improvement plan, illustrate the
plan with a man–machine analysis chart for comparative analysis, and formulate the
optimized plan with a optimized ﬂowchart.
3.2.3
Timing
Usually, timing will be conducted after operating sequence has been veriﬁed, and
operating method has been standardized. Timing without standardized operating
and action units will be invalid. The appropriateness, effectiveness, and reliability
of the operating procedure are the foundation of timing. Testers in timing usually
are operators of medium proﬁciency scale, to ensure timing results are practical [6].
Human mentality and operating performance are not be affected by experimental
factors if possible.
Overall, to optimize weapons and equipments man–machine integrated operat-
ing, to coordinate human and machine, and to achieve appropriate cooperation
among crewmen, it is necessary to put assorted factors, which affect the optimizing
of man–machine operating, optimize operating procedure, improve operating
method, shorten operating time, increase operating efﬁciency, and formulate sci-
entiﬁc and practical operating procedure of weapons and equipments.
3.3
Effective Examination of the Trainee
Effective examination of the trainee means formulating scientiﬁc test standard and
conducting accurate examination.
3.3.1
Formulate Scientiﬁc Standard
Training standard should be scientiﬁcally formulated in accordance with Military
Training and Examination Syllabus, and the standard should be conformed to the
training level of different trainees in different training stages. Unpractical standard
provides positive results for training—excessively high standard results in lack of
conﬁdence in training, while excessively low standard constrains the training to stay
at a low level. Hence, as the training principal of approaching step by step requires,
training standard is dynamically formulated in different training stages to keep a
spiral rise, and eventually rise up to the standard required by Military Training and
Examination Syllabus.

3.3.2
Conducting Accurate Examination
The accurate training examination provides principal gauge of armed forces training
status and an effective mean to spot weaknesses in military training. Therefore,
conducting accurate examination is not only to require the comprehensiveness of
examination content, and the authenticity of examination result, but also the
accuracy of examination occasion, in order to exploit the evaluation effect of
examination, and exploit the encouraging and reforming effect, improving the
evaluation, training and reforming.

Points to Emphasize in Weapons and Equipments
Man–Machine Integration Method Research
4.1
Improve Human Characteristics Research
Improving human characteristics research is to explore the anatomical, physical,
and psychological features of military personnel, to understand the activity capacity
and limit of military personnel, and to improve research on how to conform
weapons and equipments function to human physical function.
4.2
Improve Machine Characteristics Research
Improving machine characteristics research is to research into the technical function
and operating characteristics of weapons and equipments. According to charac-
teristics in man–machine integration, via questionnaire, consulting experts analyze
the capacity requirements for operators from weapon system, and the weaknesses in
weapon system that affects man–machine integration.
5
Conclusions
Weapons and equipments man–machine integration research is to study and test in
physical and mental aspects; in view of the inherent characteristics of weapons and
equipments, to formulate man–machine integration standard, operators in a scien-
tiﬁc way, optimize operating procedure and examine effectively; and to improve
operating efﬁciency, enhance reliability, and achieve best performance of the
system.

Analysis on the Effect of Culture
Constructional Factors in Military
Academies
Zhenguo Mei, Shu Jia, Peng Gong, Ye Tao and Wenying Xing
Abstract For military academies, to draft and employ the cultural construction and
management strategies, it is fundamental to locate the cultural factors embedded in
the academies’ management practices, and meanwhile to reveal the relationship and
inﬂuence between cultural and constructional factors. On the basis of mass data,
this thesis uses factor analysis and SEM to build the factor model for military
academies’ cultural construction. Cultural and constructional factors are extracted,
the relationship and inﬂuence between the two are analyzed, and the constructional
factors which have signiﬁcant inﬂuence on military culture are found. This research
provides important suggestions for the cultural construction in military academies.

theoretical achievements in discussing the contents, factors, and construction
methods of culture, yet they lack scientiﬁc quantitative studies. Based on SEM, this
thesis constructs the structural equation model for military academies’ culture
construction by combining qualitative and quantitative researches. This thesis also
analyzes the relationship and inﬂuence between cultural and constructional factors,
and provides scientiﬁc guidelines for cultural construction in military academies.

A Brief Introduction on SEM
SEM (structural equation modeling) is a statistical method based on covariance
matrix to analyze the relationship between variables. SEM combines factor analysis
and path analysis, and tests the relationship between observable variable, latent
variable, disturbance or error variable in the model, and then receives the inﬂuence
of independent variable on the dependent variable.
SEM basically includes two types of variables, observable variable and latent
variable; two models, measuring model and structural model; and two paths, the
path between observable and latent variables and the path within latent variables.
SEM analysis examines the variance and covariance structures of variables or the
correlation between them [3].

Obtaining Research Data
2.1
Designing Questionnaire
When designing the questionnaire, we considered both theoretical researches and
practices in military academies and distinguished the constituent and inﬂuential
elements in military culture. We consulted experts in military academy management
through symposia, online surveys, and questionnaires, and raised 95 questions on
military academy’s culture. After further classiﬁcation and consolidation, we ﬁnally
picked 75 questions. The questionnaire contained two parts. Part I had 32 questions
about fundamental elements of military academy’s culture and measured its internal
constituent factors; part II had 43 questions about the driving elements in cultural
construction and measured the external inﬂuential factors.
2.2
The Process of Questionnaire Survey
In this study, three surveys were conducted during May to June in 2015; 768
respondents were selected from three different types of academies, including an
706
Z. Mei et al.

intermediate commanders’ academy, a junior commanding academy, and a com-
prehensive military academy. Respondents contained ofﬁcials, cadres, teachers,
graduate students, and serving cadre students. Twenty-eight invalid questionnaires
were removed, and thus, 740 valid questionnaires were obtained.
2.3
Analysis on the Reliability and Validity of Questionnaire
Reliability refers to the consistency of measurement, reﬂecting the consistency or
stability of the result got by test tool. It indicates the ﬁdelity of the measured
characteristics of an object. Validity evaluates whether the test tool can measure an
object accurately. It reﬂects how the result reﬂects the measure goal. Using
SPSS15.0, we found that the reliability coefﬁcients of the two parts of our ques-
tionnaire were both higher than 0.90, showing that the internal reliability of the
questionnaire was high. A questionnaire’s high reliability does not necessarily lead
to high validity, yet high validity is always related to high reliability. Using the
KMO statistics and Bartlett’s test of SPSS 15.0 to measure the structural validity of
our questionnaire, we found that the KMO statistic values of both parts of our
questionnaire were higher than 0.90, showing that the questionnaire’s validity in
analysis was good. The result of Bartlett’s test reached a signiﬁcant level, and
shared information existed between different variables, indicating that the ques-
tionnaire had good structural validity [4].

Extracting Culture Constructional Factors in Military
Academies
We used SPSS 15.0 to do factor analysis. Through principal components analysis
(PCA) and varimax orthogonal rotation, we listed the factors by their contribution
rates and loading values, and extracted the factors whose eigenvalues were higher
than 1. These were the internal constituent and external inﬂuential factors of cul-
tural construction in military academies.
3.1
Extracting Internal Constituent Factors
Through factor analysis, we received the independent dimensions of the internal
constituent factors based on our 740 samples. According to the result, the eigen-
values of 6 principal components were higher than 1, and their accumulative
contribution rate reached 71.434%. We named the 6 factors as core spirit (S1),

educational and teaching concept (S2), rules and regulations (S3), facility condi-
tions (S4), organization behavior (S5), and personnel behavior (S6) [5]. See
Table 1.
3.2
Extracting External Inﬂuential Factors
Through factor analysis, we received the independent dimensions of the external
inﬂuential factors based on our 740 samples. According to the result, the eigen-
values of 8 principal components were higher than 1, and their accumulative
contribution rate reached 72.983%. We named the 8 factors as historical tradition
(S7), initiative of the academy president (S8), request of the superiors (S9), organ’s
working style (S10), model units and people (S11), personnel practice (S12),
general custom and tendency (S13), and social inﬂuence (S14) [5]. See Table 2.

Quantitative Analysis on the Effect of Culture
Constructional Factors
To draw the order of the effects of different culture constructional factors, we used
SEM to build a model for the 6 internal constituent factors and 8 external inﬂuential
factors and then analyzed the effect of the latter on the former.
4.1
Analysis on the Model Fitness Rate
We built the structural equation model for cultural construction in military acade-
mies with our related theories and experiences. We then used AMOS 7.0 to test the
ﬁtness rate of the model. See Table 3 for the result. According to the result, the
ﬁtness rate was good, which meant the model ﬁtted for practical data, and thus, our
model was satisfactory for following analysis.
4.2
Analysis on the Effect of Culture Constructional Factors
We used AMOS 7.0 to carry out the parameter estimation for our model, and we got
the effect of internal constituent factors on external inﬂuential factors through path
analysis. See Table 4.

From Table 4, we could receive the following conclusions:
(1) The factors inﬂuencing core spirit (S1) were historical tradition (S7), initiative
of the academy president (S8), personnel practice (S12), and organ’s working
style (S10). S7 had the greatest inﬂuence.
(2) The factors inﬂuencing educational and teaching concept (S2) were initiative of
the academy president (S8), historical tradition (S7), request of the superiors
(S9), and organ’s working style (S10). S8 had the greatest inﬂuence.
(3) The factors inﬂuencing rules and regulations (S3) were historical tradition (S7),
general custom and tendency (S13), and initiative of the academy president
(S8). S7 had the greatest inﬂuence.
(4) The factors inﬂuencing facility conditions (S4) were historical tradition (S7),
request of the superiors (S9), and initiative of the academy president (S8). S7
had the greatest inﬂuence.
(5) The factors inﬂuencing organization behavior (S5) were personnel practice
(S12), initiative of the academy president (S8), and general custom and ten-
dency (S13). S12 had the greatest inﬂuence.
(6) The factors inﬂuencing personnel behavior (S6) were general custom and
tendency (S13), social inﬂuence (S14), and initiative of the academy president
(S8). S13 had the greatest inﬂuence.

Conclusions and Suggestions
Based on factor analysis and SEM, the thesis takes the 740 valid questionnaires on
cultural construction in military academies as initial data and extracts 6 cultural
factors and 8 constructional actors through statistical software. The cultural factors
include core spirit, educational and teaching concept, rules and regulations, facility
conditions, organization behavior, personnel behavior, etc. The constructional
factors include historical tradition, initiative of the academy president, request of
the superiors, organ’s working style, model units and people, personnel practice,
general custom and tendency, social inﬂuence, etc. We also analyzed the inﬂuence
of constructional factors on cultural factors. The result shows that historical

tradition, initiative of the academy president, personnel practice, and general cus-
tom and tendency have signiﬁcant inﬂuence on military academy’s culture. This
provides a clear direction for cultural construction in military academies.
To strengthen the cultural construction, we not only need to construct compre-
hensively, but also need to construct with highlights. In this way, our cultural
construction will be more targeted and effective. We have four speciﬁc strategies.
Firstly, we should attach great importance to the historical and cultural heritage of
academies, maintaining our ﬁne customs and selecting cultural essentials. Secondly,
academy presidents should proactively call for development in academy culture.
They need to use their own inﬂuences and devote to this undertaking. Thirdly, we
must strive to create a good atmosphere in the academy. Organizations can unite
together to promote good customs and tendencies. Finally, all the staff should
contribute to the academy culture. We must work jointly for the full implementation
of cultural construction [5].
Compliance with Ethical Standards The study was approved by the Logistics Department for
Civilian Ethics Committee of Air Defense Forces Academy. All subjects who participated in the
experiment were provided with and signed an informed consent form. All relevant ethical safe-
guards have been met with regard to subject protection.

Analysis on Risk Identiﬁcation of Railway
Transportation in Air Defense Force’s
Trans-regional Training
Weifei Wu, Chang Mei, Zhenguo Mei, Leiming Yao and Ye Tao
Abstract Railway transportation has the advantages of large carrying capacity,
strong continuous ability, high speed, and efﬁciency and is rarely inﬂuenced by
weather conditions. It now becomes the main mean of transport for armies to carry
out long-distance troop delivery and plays an important role in trans-regional
training and performing emergency tasks. In recent years, when air defense forces
organize trans-regional trainings, many troops are involved, the maneuvering dis-
tance is long, and lots of equipment is required. All these increase the security
threats in training. In this way, it is of great importance to carry out risk identiﬁ-
cation of railway transportation in trans-regional training and strengthen our
security management. Based on risk management theory and according to the
characteristics of railway transportation in training, this thesis concludes risk cau-
ses, summarizes risk identiﬁcation methods, and then analyzes the implementation
of risk identiﬁcation. The ﬁndings provide basic guidance and methods for air
defense forces in their future risk identiﬁcations and management.

training, ﬁnd risk causes, summarize risk identiﬁcation methods, and analyze the
measures to implement risk identiﬁcation. Our efforts can offer a solid foundation
for risk control and contribute to the success of military training.
1
Risk Causes
According to the characteristics and occurrence mechanism of risks in railway
transportation in trans-regional training, we can sum up the basic causes into four
aspects: personnel, equipment vehicles, transportation environment, and organiza-
tion and management [2].
1.1
Personnel Factor
Personnel risk mainly refers to the risk caused by drivers, vehicle guides, and
passengers. Among them, drivers are the main source of risks, and they are gen-
erally affected by their driving ages, driving skills, driving experiences, and safety
awareness. Vehicle guides often cause risks when loading and unloading the
equipment vehicles and are affected by guidance skills, experiences, sense of
responsibility, and safety awareness. Passengers may also cause risks, and they are
affected by their concepts of organization disciplines, safety awareness, safety
education, etc.
1.2
Equipment Vehicle Factor
Equipment vehicle risk mainly refers to the risk caused by military passenger cars,
tractors, equipment vehicles, and other equipment. Among them, vehicles of dif-
ferent types are the major cause. They are affected by their models, service life,
vehicle condition, active safety, and passive safety. Active safety includes a vehi-
cle’s power, braking, handling stability, and tire performance; passive safety
includes a vehicle’s safety design, ﬁre prevention measures, and restraint devices.
1.3
Transportation Environment Factor
Transportation environment risk mainly refers to the risk caused by train’s ﬂatcars,
railways, and natural factors. Flatcars are limited by their lengths and widths and
may have imperfect reinforcement facilities, and thus they can cause risks. Railway
risks are caused by electrical equipment and the speeding up and down of trains.
714
W. Wu et al.

Natural risk is caused by bad weather conditions (such as snow and ice, wind and
rain, heavy fog, burning sun) and natural disasters (such as landslides, tsunamis,
debris ﬂow).
1.4
Organization and Management Factor
Organization and management risk refers to the risk caused by unscientiﬁc plans,
imprecise organization, and careless checking. These risks include personnel
management risk, equipment management risk, and activity organization risk.
Personnel management risk is caused by careless personnel management, and thus
people may fall down, get electric shocks, be squeezed, or get lost. Equipment
management risk is caused by imperfect reinforcement facilities and delayed
checking, and thus equipment may get loosened, collapsed, be collided, and fall
down. Activity organization risk is the risk caused by ill-considered plans, unsci-
entiﬁc commands, and careless supervision.
2
Risk Identiﬁcation Methods
The main risk identiﬁcation methods for railway transportation include risk
checklist, expert evaluation, and ﬁeld survey.
2.1
Risk Checklist
Risk checklist method is the basic method for risk identiﬁcation of railway trans-
portation. In this method, we need to ﬁrst design a questionnaire or chart to list all
the possible risks in railway transportation in detail. Then, staff will hold this
checklist and investigate the parts involved, and gradually get the identiﬁcation
results, which is also called the risk framework.
The main forms of risk checklist include loss checklist, responsibility checklist,
and problem checklist, and corresponding analyzing methods include loss
checklist method, systematic risk analysis questionnaire method, and list checking
method [3].
2.2
Expert Evaluation
Expert evaluation method is a common method in risk identiﬁcation. In this
method, we need to invite relevant staff and experienced safety experts in railway
Analysis on Risk Identiﬁcation of Railway Transportation …

transportation ﬁeld to meet and discuss in symposia. In the end, they will have a
consensus, which is the result of risk identiﬁcation [4].
2.3
Field Survey
Field survey method is very important in risk identiﬁcation, and it often acts as the
supplement of other methods. When we fail to fully and clearly identify the risks
through the other methods, we need to send some staff to take investigation and
accumulate evidences on the spot. Staff should try to ﬁnd the risk condition and
underlying problems of different parts and ﬁnally identify the risks. This method
requires us to design a ﬁeld survey questionnaire and invite relevant technicians to
assist us.
When identifying the risks in railway transportation in air defense force’s
trans-regional training, we often use these methods comprehensively to ensure our
work is scientiﬁc and covers all aspects.
3
The Implementation of Risk Identiﬁcation
To implement the risk identiﬁcation, we need to comprehensively use various
methods, analyze the risk factors and links in railway transportation, and ﬁnd the
potential risks.
We take Army A’s trans-regional training in 2016 as an example and analyze the
single- and multi-factor risks in this activity.
3.1
Identifying the Single-Factor Risks
Personnel, equipment vehicles, transportation environment, and organization and
management are all independent risk causes. They have different features, mani-
festations, and inﬂuences, yet if we consider them separately, they all belong to
single-factor risks. We usually take ﬁeld survey and expert evaluation methods to
identify them. According to the characteristics and conditions of risk factors, we
analyze potential risks and their inﬂuences and then get the identiﬁcation results.
Since the manifestations of single-factor risks in railway transportation are quite
complicated, we need the support from organizations of all levels and the active
participation of ofﬁcers and soldiers, so as to get precise data.
The identiﬁcation results of single-factor risks are shown in Table 1.

3.2
Identifying Multi-factor Risks
The accidents in railway transportation are often caused by many factors, which
mean they are comprehensive and dynamic. We need to carry out multi-factor risk
identiﬁcation on the basis of single-factor risk identiﬁcation to ﬁnd out the risk links
and points [5]. To identify multi-factor risks, we can divide the railway trans-
portation process into several stages: loading, running, stopover, and unloading. We
analyze these stages one by one, and then make a risk checklist, carry out expert
evaluation, and implement ﬁeld investigation to ﬁnd out underlying accidents, their
causes and possible losses, and ﬁnally get the risk identiﬁcation results.
The identiﬁcation results of multi-factor risks are shown in Table 2.

Design Evaluation Method to HHIPS
Based on Ergonomics Analysis
Min Gao, Zhen Liu and Renhe Zhou
Abstract Hand-held industrial products (HHIPS) can reduce human labour
intensity and physiological burden. These kinds of products are very important part
of product design ﬁeld. This paper introduces the characteristics and different ways
for classiﬁcation of HHIPS. It also parses the ergonomics analysis method and some
points in the process of design evaluation based on the ergonomics. The instance of
hand-held electric sharpener is listed. To design more HHIPS accorded with the
physiological and psychological needs for reducing the use of fatigue and
enhancing use of comfort HHIPS, the man–machine-engineering-related knowl-
edge is needed in the process of design for HHIPS to achieve the goal of opti-
mization through the actual operation of measurement data analysis evaluation.

Introduction
Physiological load refers to the combination of external physical or information
burden (pressure) to have function on a living organism in the body. The function is
to maintain body’s internal stability or affect the outside of body. A human is under
a lot of physiological load in his daily life. The physiological load can lead to
discomfort and fatigue [1]. The generation of ergonomics is based on the aim of

solving such problems. By the study of the factors such as anatomy, physiology,
psychology in a work environment and human–machine, environment interaction,
fatigue and physiological, psychological burden of the body are reduced. An
important problem with ergonomic product design is to determine the cause of
comfort and discomfort factors. Hands are the parts of a human body used in high
frequency [2]. Human actions like mobility and manipulation make the use of hand
diverse [3]. Some operations even need the human body to use the hand to the
extreme state [4]. Ergonomics designed HHIPS reduces the human labour intensity
and physiological burden. It also reduces the negative effect of the hand tools on the
human body [5]. So it becomes one of the hottest design propositions today because
of its close nature with human’s daily life.
2
The Characteristics and Classiﬁcation of HHIPS
Hand-held products should be designed in different shape, size, weight and struc-
ture according to different purposes and functions to make the hand-held industrial
products be used more convenient. The applied ergonomics principle of HHIPS can
be found in some data and literature. Some basic principles for hand-held products
are listed.
1. Avoid static muscle load. Static muscle load of the lifting arm can be reduced
when the HHIPS design makes the operating position of arms in natural
prolapse.
2. Keep the operation state of the wrist in straight status. So the wrist is relaxed in
the middle position, operating fatigue is reduced and comfort is enhanced.
3. Avoid high pressure to the palm of hand through product design.
4. Pay attention to measurement of the handgrip strength.
Development and progress of science and technology make the structure and the
operating interface of HHIPS more and more humanized and easy to use. It is also
more and more accurate, reliable and safe. The ergonomics design to HHIPS can
make it more suitable for operation and make the product to be the extension of
human body. The man–machine engineering characteristics of hand-held product
design mainly include the following items.
1. Reduce the fatigue and improve use comfort of operator with HHIPS.
2. Increase the service efﬁciency of HHIPS.
3. Apply psychological theory in HHIPS design as modelling and colour design to
get the best effect of human–computer interaction.
4. Reduce the mis-operation possibility.
5. Improve safe and reliable performance when using HHIPS.
6. Make it easier to repair and maintain.
7. Make the product easy to recognize.
720
M. Gao et al.

The main research methods associated with human factors’ research include
anthropometry, biomechanics, human psychology, product modelling theory,
cognitive science. According to the power source, HHIPS can be divided into two
kinds as power hand-held products and non-power hand-held products. Referring to
the contact position of the hand and product, HHIPS can be divided into two kinds
as ﬁnger-held products and palm-held products.
3
Ergonomics Analysis Method of HHIPS
Hand-held products are closely linked with the hands. The analysis of the structure
of skeletal muscle to hand, arm, sometimes including shoulder part of human being
can be used in the ﬁeld of hand-held products’ design and research. The skeletal
muscle of hand includes thumb from the roots of skeletal muscle (CMC), hand–
ﬁnger joint (MCP), internode joints between ﬁngers (IP), internode joint of prox-
imal ﬁnger (PIP), internode joint of distant ﬁnger (DIP).
Kinetics of hand analyses the strength, operating time and torque to ﬁnger and
muscle tendon. Thus, it can apply physical science theory instruction to HHIPS
design study. The instance of analysis research with the reliability of hand-held
products shows that composite reliability of HHIPS depends on the result that
reliability of human body multiplies by reliability of HHIPS. Human reliability can
be improved by according guidance to operator. The improvement of product
reliability needs reasonable and effective design.
Repeated use of hand-held products which is not in conformity with the ergo-
nomics design for a long time may cause the cumulative damage or other syndrome
to the operator. The design can be optimized through the analysis of hand muscle.
Such optimization is made as some modiﬁed model lines in the hand-held products.
Changing the linear type to streamlining type can increase grasp power for
hand-held products, so as to achieve the design target of reducing the control force
and the operating fatigue.
In design for HHIPS, psychology and physiology both provide theoretical basis
for research related to hand-held products. Psychology is the science to study
psychological activity and behaviour of human and animal. In the early nineteenth
century, the German philosopher and education expert, J.F. Herbart, ﬁrst proposed
psychology is a science. Model and colour should accord to the operating envi-
ronment and operating requirements in HHIPS design. More emphasis should be
put to the effects on the person’s psychology. The modelling aesthetic rule should
be carried on the corresponding design. Then, the product can reach a certain visual
effect from the perspective of scale, symmetrical balance, stability and lightness.

Design Evaluation Based on Ergonomics to HHIPS
4.1
Establishment and Evaluation of the Model
Through the simulation, modelling and entity model make feedback and design
integrate closely in the process of development. Static two-dimensional plane ﬁg-
ure, three-dimensional digital model and physical model can help the user to get
design preview and timely evaluation. The cost evaluation is lowed, and design
optimization is achieved before the ﬁnal testing.
4.2
Example of Hand-held Electric Sharpener Design
Product introduction: The development of sharpener began in foreign countries, and
the history of sharpener research in our country only lasted a decade or so. The
current brands include Zhongshan Ditai, Zhejiang Wantong. Electric sharpener
generally has a build-in small direct current or alternating current motor. The motor
isinstalled around knife material named knife head to make the internal rotation.
According to the different requirements of knife, electric sharpener can also be
divided into one knife head design and many sections’ knife head design. Many
sections’ knife head design often include two parts with coarse grinding and ﬁne
grinding. The service life of electric sharpener mainly depends on the quality of the
motor and the abrasive resistance of the knife head.
Performance program: Turn on the power of the electric sharpener and switch.
Knife head begins to spin. Put the knife head into the knife mouth. Let the head
contact with knife tablets. Pull along the curve back to the knife blade angle with
uniform velocity and constant efforts about 3–8 s (ordinary steel knife 3–6 s,
ceramic knife 4–8 s). Achieve the goal of grinding knife sharp through repeated
pressure and before and after movement (Fig. 1).

M. Gao et al.

Design points are as follows:
1. Sharpener design should comply with the hand-held product design character-
istics. Fully man–machine analysis must be conducted before design, especially
reducing the use fatigue of the operator and improving the use of comfort. The
analysis makes the product conform to the operation habit of most consumers
and improves the use safety.
2. The design breaks the traditional model of straight line machinery and applies
more rounded edge model. This makes the product create the visual effect of
easy communication. At the respect of colour, it is designed to be in harmony
with the use of environment. The style is deﬁned as concise and modern to
reﬂect science and technology feeling.
Design evaluation: This design is made into the mould production with plank
through rapid prototyping technology. The subjects operate the electric knife
sharpener plank with hand and the usage of data of hands and arms is measured.
Then, the data is compared with the data of similar products on the market. Man–
machine parameter is extracted by surface muscle testing machine. It measures
physiological reaction signals to the product. The information of operation comfort
can be obtained by the analysis equipment of grasping movement from psycho-
logical stress data. Detailed analysis is carried on for the design requirement.
Eventually it is proved by human–machine experiments that the new design can
meet the requirements of the operator’s hand operation, reduce the fatigue of
operators and improve comfort experience. Model sense design and technical sense
color satisfy the psychological needs of users.
5
Conclusions
Hands no doubt play an important role in the human’s daily life to change the
world. Hand-held product is just the product type closely related to the operator’s
hand. In order to reduce the user’s physiological and psychological fatigue, achieve
the ultimate goal of comfort usage, design for HHIPS should have different
structure and model to conform to the requirements of the man–machine engi-
neering according to the function and the environment. Even though the sort of
HHIPS is diverse and the function of it is various in life and work, there are some
common principles and basic theories in the aspect of man–machine and envi-
ronment to assist the related design research.

The Proﬁle of Common Physical Tasks
Determination in Foreign Armies and Its
Enlightenment on Formulation of Military
Physical Training Plans
Weizhong Liu
Abstract The foreign army researchers analyzed all working classiﬁcation of
hundreds of combat missions and carried out assessments on the traditional physical
test standards to determine the abilities such as “lifting and handling, digging,
walking and running,” as common tasks. Based on the above research from several
countries, common military tasks were identiﬁed that provided the preference
physical ﬁtness in general goals set of the training program. The enlightenment to
our army’s military training scheme is as follows: (1) Should follow the military
training policy and directives; (2) Should be combined with the platform for
development and reform, and the requirements of military physical training pro-
gram; (3) Post the actual analysis of physical quality of common needs, develop
optimal military physical training plans. In particular grassroots units, units engaged
in combat missions for physical task analysis are relatively easy to operate, can
fully demonstrate the common physical tasks, according to the physical needs, take
the appropriate military physical education courses as a means of training, so as to
improve the ﬁtness level for army, and meet the needs to carry out combat missions.

In the army investigation, when we asked how military physical training plan was
developed, we usually heard three answering. Answer 1 is “do not know how to
draw up training plan but according to the previous plan”, answer 2 is “don’t
understand, according to supervisor training program, we have slightly reﬁned”;
answer 3 is “in accordance with the program, combined with military training

on the basis of the unit plan.” Clearly, answer 3 is more accurate, but only a few
units can correctly formulate military physical training program.

Proﬁle of Common Physical Tasks Determination
in Foreign Armies
Through the literature reports of foreign military forces [1], determination of the
basic military joint physical tasks in foreign armies is as follows.
2.1
Canada
As early as 1983, Canadian army began to study for the arms (null, San Diego, sea,
and land) setting minimum physical ﬁtness standard. In 1985, the research conﬁrms
ability to dig foxholes, overland escape capability, and low/CoGi creeping ability to
escape, carrying sandbags, and the land is all soldiers must master common military
tasks to deal with any emergency situation. In 1996, Canadian army undertook
argumentation about the relevant documents on military and military exercises of
the cold war. Table 1 describes the common military tasks required to perform
urgent tasks. Results show that initially established ﬁve common military tasks are
representative of the beginning in the late 1990 of the twentieth to twenty-ﬁrst
century basic military skills. Also found oil drum (weight) is also a major joint
military task, and ultimately this skill was also included in a standard.
2.2
Netherlands
In 2004, researchers performed six tasks based on units (including peacekeeping
operations and various other tasks), listed the speciﬁc skills required for the forces:
observation posts, checkpoints and patrols were the most common tasks. Four
experts of the Netherlands with 5 different types of combat troops (airmobile
Brigade, and commando armored) described the most common skills were needed,
regardless of offense or defense requires these skills. And weight-bearing walk is
part of the most important. In addition, the “shooting and moving”, alternately
kneeling, digging, lifting and handling were identiﬁed as abilities that combat
troops must-have.
726

2.3
British
The Royal Navy has re evaluated traditional body testing standards and identiﬁed
“broadside ﬁring, wounded delivery, and ﬂeeing ships in various ways” as their
common task. The typical common task of naval ﬁre ﬁghting skills are “ﬁre circle
condensation cooling, rolling drums, carrying ﬁre extinguishers, carrying hose
running, climbing ladder”. In 2003, the British army conﬁrmed the contents of the
14 core combat tasks and formulated the corresponding physical ﬁtness standards.
The skills of “digging or shoveling, lifting and carrying” are identiﬁed as a common
task of air force enforcement. In order to meet the minimum requirements in the
physical quality level of combat missions, ﬁghting quality evaluation system
revised by the British Royal Air Force in 2005 also identiﬁed four common rep-
resentative tasks. they are “Lifting the ammo box continuously, carrying 2–20 water
tanks continuously, lift and carrying the ammunition box repeatedly within 10
meters, and Marching for 12.8 kilometers”. It meets the basic physique require-
ments of the air force’s 14 core operations.
In 2004, researchers perform six tasks based on units (including peacekeeping
operations and various other tasks) and list the speciﬁc skills required for the forces:
observation posts, and checkpoints, and patrols were team to perform the most.

American
As early as 1984, experts analyzed all working classiﬁcation of 1999 combat
missions. Table 2 describes the most common order of skills.
As early as 1984, the US military Ordinance 611–201 contained six of the most
important categories: lifting and carrying, lifting aloft, lowering, climbing, digging,
walking, marching and running, pushing and pulling”. These were carefully
selected by US military experts after analyzing the 1999 operational tasks required
by all categories of military work in the United States. Among them, lifting and
conveying are recognized as the most versatile skills, representing 232 tasks for 172
types of professionals. The second is “high and low”, which represents the 92 tasks
of the 75 types of professionals; Excavation represents 18 tasks for 18 types of
professionals; Walking, marching, and running represent 22 tasks for 18 types of
professionals. Whether it’s a long walk, a long march or a long run. Long marches
are considered to be especially important for combat units.
Based on the above research from several countries, common military tasks were
identiﬁed that provided the preference physical ﬁtness in general goals set of the
training program.

The Enlightenment to Our Army’s Military Training
Scheme
3.1
Should Follow the Military Training Policy
and Directives
“The military physical education” pointed out: “the military sports training plan is
purposeful, organized, step by step, the scientiﬁc arrangement of military sports
training and guidance documents successfully completed the indispensable military
physical training tasks [1].” Military physical training plan is an important part of
military training program, “the military physical training” proposed military training
plan refers to the organization, implementation, coordination, monitoring and pro-
tection of military sports training schedule [2] 61”. On the basis of the “Forewarned
is forearmed.” In the theory of military sports, it is considered that the military sports
training program is the pre arrangement for organizing and implementing military
sports activities, and is the basic basis for clear goals and uniﬁed action [3] 248. On
how to develop training programs, military sports theory points out “We should
carefully understand the purpose and guiding ideology of our army’s military
physical training, as well as the content, time, requirements and assessment stan-
dards prescribed by the higher authorities for military sports training. According to
the characteristics of services and arms, for the troops of soldiers in different tasks,
the speciﬁc circumstances and geographical environment and other objective con-
ditions, formulate feasible plan of military training.” Military expert Li Zhiwen
believes that the formulation of military sports training plan should be based on the
military training program, higher training instructions, the head of the intention, the
actual situation of the army, the principles of military sports training and other
factors [3] 250. In formulating military sports training programs, grass-roots units
are in accordance with the plan of the higher authorities and in accordance with the
actual situation of this department. Starting from the grass-roots level and platoon
training programmes, the source will be traced back. In the end, it will naturally be
the headquarters, and the ﬁnal basis for the training plan of the organs at all levels
must be the training program formulated by the headquarters.
3.2
On Military Physical Training Should Be Combined
with the Platform for Development and Reform,
and the Requirements of Military Physical Training
Program
On December 31, 2014, the four General Headquarters/departments jointly issued a
circular on military physical training development and reform platform, portrays the
grand blueprint for military sports training, 2015 the military physical training
program introduced for comment. Due to tight schedule the task for various rea-
sons, such as, military physical training program is not as good as foreign armies, in

the wide range of positions in army common tasks of data collection and research,
and use other methods to determine all the arms of military physical training based
on common projects. The height and width of the outline from the army, on the
arms of military training and evaluation for the speciﬁcation, in order to prevent the
army exam training, also adds a large number of training courses and quizzes. In the
development of military physical training plans, must be closely combined with the
platform and the syllabus requirements and guarantees stipulated in the outline
curricula train ﬁrst, taking care to avoid the simplistic idea of what training, and
strive to combine jobs the job actually, targeted training positions physical tasks
require physical ﬁtness, to ensure “training for war.”
3.3
Post the Actual Analysis of Physical Quality of Common
Needs, Develop Optimal Military Physical Training
Plans
In view of the actual physical ﬁtness of the common requirements, the Canadian
military’s military sports training program implements this principle. That is, all
soldiers must master the joint military task to deal with any emergency. The
Holland army has worked out speciﬁc tasks for the speciﬁc tasks of the detachment,
including observation posts, checkpoints, patrols, and weight-bearing walking,
shooting and moving, alternately standing, kneeling, digging, lifting and carrying.
When the British Army formulated the corresponding standard of physical ﬁtness
for the implementation of the combat mission, 14 core joint ﬁghting tasks were
identiﬁed. US military experts screened out 6 of the 1999 missions. Therefore, our
army should learn from foreign experience in the development of military sports
training plan. Especially at the grassroots level, developing military physical
training plan is according to the actual demand analysis of common physical
quality, taking the corresponding military sports training courses, in order to meet
the need to carry out a speciﬁc task. The means used in class training process should

Information Security Impacts Future
Trafﬁc Safety of Intelligent Vehicle
Quan Yuan, Haojie Yang and Yang Liu
Abstract As the development of intelligent vehicle technology, the road trafﬁc
system will become more complex, and the degree of internet application will be
higher. These result in that information security problems are also changing to be
more prominent. So it is necessary to keep abreast of the future development of
transport system and the possible risks. This paper analyzes the mechanism of some
new technologies (such as cloud storage and cloud computing) used in the future
trafﬁc system and summarizes the potential risks of future trafﬁc system, especially
the risks of information security. The related issues include the possible fault in the
information processing system, hacker attack, the risk of information disclosure in
the cloud storage center, and the physical damage to the future trafﬁc system itself.
Furthermore, this paper tries to provide a preliminary and effective solution, as far
as possible to enhance the stability of the future trafﬁc system. By using physical
isolation and other effective methods, related agencies can avoid hacker intrusion
and protect the information security of the system users so as to ensure the future
trafﬁc safety.

Introduction
Due to the rapid development of intelligent vehicle technologies, especially
self-driving and Internet of vehicles, the existing transport system is undergoing an
unprecedented change, and the blueprint for the future road trafﬁc system has
appeared. However, when the trafﬁc becomes more and more intelligent, we should
perform in-depth study to explore if the trafﬁc system can keep drivers and

passengers safe throughout. From the initial trafﬁc accidents involving intelligent
vehicles, we can get a glimpse of the risks of future trafﬁc systems. But it is
undeniable that this transform will not stop because of these temporary problems.
What we can do is to promote this transform, pay attention to the risks and prepare
related solutions.
The type of vehicle is becoming increasingly innovative, while the road trafﬁc
system is becoming more and more complex. It is impossible to summarize all
possible patterns and features of trafﬁc accidents. In this paper, through investi-
gating possible situation and trends of the future trafﬁc system, and analyzing
emergency incidents caused by intelligent vehicles, we suppose several possible
forms of trafﬁc accidents and suggest some preliminary solutions.

Background
2.1
Current Situation of Self-driving Vehicles
If a driver wants to control a normal vehicle safely, he should receive outside
information ﬁrst, then process information by the brain and make a decision, ﬁnally
give an order from the brain to body to carry out the order. Therefore, there are
several aspects to design self-driving vehicle at present.
First of all, it is necessary to liberate the sensory organs including eyes, ears, skin
from driving. And various sensors are used to receive complex information from
outside instead of the driver. At present, most of the sensors are radar including
laser, microwave and sound waves, and vision including single vision, double
visions, and night vision.
Then liberating the brain of the driver is also important. In the self-driving
vehicle, the chips with powerful computing power have replaced the brain of
mankind. As present situation, server-level processing chip is sufﬁcient for this
function.
Finally, since the CPU of computer system can give an instruction to the vehicle
directly, current mechanical control system should be adjusted in order to adapt the
self-driving situation.
The above aspects are all the requirement of self-driving vehicles. Considering
the possible system failure and other risks, it is necessary to reserve normal driving
system in self-driving vehicle to prevent possible emergency incidents.
2.2
Outlook of Future Trafﬁc System
At present, many companies and institutions which develop self-driving vehicle
have completed the above aspects. And several kinds of self-driving vehicles which
732
Q. Yuan et al.

are tested have been able to travel on the road. However, only self-driving vehicle is
not enough. People can not only design intelligent and self-driving vehicles, but
also put all self-driving vehicle as well as the trafﬁc environment into a common
network which is called vehicle networking.
Vehicle networking can also be called intelligent trafﬁc system, which is a
real-time, accurate, efﬁcient transportation management system acting on wide
range and all directions. The system integrates information technology, data com-
munication technology, electronic sensing technology, control technology, com-
puter technology, and other advanced technologies. In the vehicle networking, there
are not only exchange between human and vehicle, vehicle and trafﬁc environment,
but also between vehicle and vehicle, vehicle and database. Because of this, the
Bluetooth, CAN bus of vehicle, and GPS which are installed in normal vehicle can
be connected with vehicle networking.
In the vehicle networking, self-driving system collects information from the
surroundings to control the vehicles. At the same time, the system can communicate
with other vehicles directly, and receive environmental information from other
vehicles. As a result, the system can get more useful information to make a better
decision to control the vehicles safely by the CPU.
Above all vehicles that access the network, there is a database, or a cloud
storage-computing center. All of the information collected by the vehicles will be
uploaded to the cloud storage-computing center (CSCC). In normal conditions, the
vehicle’s own CPU can process the information by itself. But when the information
is too complex to be processed independently by the CPU, the CSCC can help the
vehicles process the information, and feed back the results to the vehicles in order
to improve the operation efﬁciency of vehicles.
In addition, the CSCC can collect environmental information from all vehicles in
the world. Therefore, one vehicle’s decisions don’t need to be conﬁned in 10 m.
According to the plan that vehicles upload, and the information 10 km or further
around the vehicle, the CSCC can help the vehicle make the best decision. For
example, if a road is crowded now, or there is a trafﬁc accident, the center can feed
back to the vehicle in advance. Then, the vehicle can choose other routes to save
driver’s time, and improve trafﬁc efﬁciency.

Risks of Future Trafﬁc System
3.1
Hacking Attack
As mentioned earlier, GPS, Bluetooth, CAN bus will still appear in the automatic
driving system in the next period of time because of their own characteristics. But
these technologies are currently or will be attacked by the hacker [1]. It can be seen
that self-driving vehicles face the same threat of hacking in the future.
Information Security Impacts Future Trafﬁc …
733

On the afternoon of March 30th, well-known bug reporting platform “WooYun”
exposes a serious bug in BYD intelligent vehicle, which maybe lead to a complete
control of the vehicle by the hacker. This bug is related to cloud service, which can
help the hacker write program to get any drivers’ information (name, license plate
number, vehicle frame number, ID number, contact name, mobile phone number,
and so on) and the control code to get the control of the vehicle and the owner’s
privacy. Thus, in the future, when the vehicle has been highly electronic and
become the center of information exchange, to prevent the invasion from hackers,
this risk must be taken seriously. If a vehicle can exchange information by the
network, it must face the threat of hacking. And once the hackers intrude, they will
completely control the vehicle. At that time, the harm to vehicle owner is
self-evident.
3.2
Risks of Cloud Mode
In the future, all autopilot, unmanned, and intelligent trafﬁc need trafﬁc informa-
tion’s real-time collection and analysis, and they also need a system to predict the
trafﬁc dynamics. Facing of such a huge amount of trafﬁc information, that we only
rely on the car terminal to collect and analyze the information is far from enough.
Relying on cloud storage and cloud computing collection and analysis the infor-
mation is more likely [2].
At present, Ford company is providing information services based on cloud
storage [3], and Ford can update its automotive infotainment systems by using
Microsoft’s Azure’s cloud services [4]. But some of the recent cases about leakage
of information show some drawbacks of cloud storage. As reported, in the case of
stealing and selling citizen’s information that was cracked by Ministry of Public
Security, 5 billion pieces of citizen’s information were leaked. Someone familiar
with the matter said the information belongs to some users from Internet companies.
The information uploaded to these companies’ cloud storage was stolen by the
administrators. That shows cloud storage’s shortcomings (information access per-
missions may be out of control, so there is the risk of information leakage. The
stored data from the vehicle interior are placed outside of the vehicle, so the security
of data is questionable. It is difﬁcult to restore the information that is attacked
seriously, and it is difﬁcult to compare the excellent algorithm for the processing
system because of the suddenness of the unexpected situation.). Even these
shortcomings of cloud storage mean that there will be serious risks in the future
trafﬁc system.
In addition, the cloud model itself also has the possibility of going wrong. On
March 15, 2017, Microsoft disclosed that the storage tier from its Azure public
cloud is facing issues in data center regions across the globe. Out of 28 data center
regions, 26 were having storage issues, according to the status page [5]. And the
cloud model needs to set up a permission to update the trafﬁc information, coor-
dinate the trafﬁc ﬂow, and shut down itself when it goes wrong. Then when there is
734
Q. Yuan et al.

the abuse of authority, the drivers’ information of residential, work place, and
driving routes will be leaked out, even the system will be shut down and countless
unmanned and automatic cars may lose control.
3.3
Fault Tolerance
Fault tolerance is the property that enables a system to continue operating properly
in the event that some of its components go wrong (or one or more faults within).
Because autopilot, unmanned, and intelligent transportation systems are also con-
cerned with the safety of passengers and must not be interrupted; strong fault
tolerance is very necessary for these systems to deal with their huge ﬂow of
information. However, taking into the processing system’s mode of all-weather
working and that trafﬁc information changes happen in the moment and unex-
pected, such strong fault tolerance maybe also not enough. How to solve the
problem of the handling system’s reliability will be the key of the health of trafﬁc
system in the future.
3.4
Physical Damage
The physical damage to the trafﬁc system is also a serious issue. Whether it is GPS
satellite, cloud storage, cloud computing center, or information relay-stations will
probably cause the breakdown of intelligent trafﬁc, and automatic car will be out of
control due to natural physical damage. The paralysis of a trafﬁc system with
hundreds of millions of people is extremely destructive, and the most possible
enforcers are the terrorists.
4
Discussion
As the stability of the trafﬁc handling system is linked to its fault tolerant, we need
to enhance its fault-tolerant performance to improve the stability of the system
according to the formed and perfect computer system. At present, the fault-tolerant
technologies used in computer are structural redundancy, information redundancy,
time redundancy (it takes a long time), spatial redundancy, and redundant additional
technology which is required for space redundancy (it is suitable for improving the
future trafﬁc system where time’s requirements are extremely strict). In addition,
lockstep can also improve fault tolerance by running the same set of operations at
the same time in parallel [6]. The redundancy allows error detection and error
correction: the output from lockstep operations can be compared to determine if

there has been a fault when there are at least two systems (dual modular redun-
dancy). This technology requires the system to run its memory doubled that will be
bound to lead to increasing costs for cloud storage and cloud computing. It is worth
for the huge staff of the transport system.
At present, government and society mainly concern about the network’s infor-
mation security, and many countries have issued some guidelines about it. China
issued a “Opinions of the National Informatization Leading Group on strengthening
the work of information security” called as “No. 27” containing information
security level protection (ISLP) and building network trust system based on the
password-based information protection on August 26, 2003. It can be seen that its
main strategy is to encrypt the key information for information security. Taking into
account, the amount of information that the future trafﬁc system needs to collect and
encrypt information is time-consuming. This shows that encryption is not suitable
for this system. How about network ﬁrewall? Theoretically that any network ﬁre-
wall is not absolutely safe, only the real physical isolation can maximize the pro-
tection of information security. Figure 1 shows a new concept design for trafﬁc
safety system in the future to ensure the information security of the system. There is
currently a scheme of internal and external network isolation which can achieve this
physical isolation where only the credit terminal (e.g., the smart car) can access the
processing system [7].
As shown in Fig. 1, the ﬁrewall isolates the cloud system from the outside
world,and only trafﬁc information can pass through the ﬁrewall. The public ter-
minal includes the mechanical operating system and the various ports. The safety
terminal is the intelligent driving brain connected with the cloud system. The safety
terminal transmits the data to the public terminal to manipulate the vehicle.

736
Q. Yuan et al.

This new design can isolate the trafﬁc processing system and the illegal terminal.
In addition, in order to prevent hackers from using the trusted terminal to attack the
processing system, we can build a system which is similar to the physical isolation
system with single hard disk. The system can be divided into two virtual mobile
terminals (security terminals and public terminals) to achieve the physical isolation
and to create a one-way security channel where data can only be transferred from
the public terminal to the security terminal so as to prevent hackers from using the
trusted terminal (their cars) to attack the trafﬁc processing system [8].

Conclusion
Considering the existing issues of trafﬁc system, this article examines several
possible risks of future trafﬁc systems including intelligent vehicles, such as
hacking attack, risks of cloud mode, fault tolerance, and physical damage of system.
And some related solutions are discussed. In order to protect the transmission of
information ﬂowing to be secure in the cloud mode, this paper designs an internal
and external network system which can achieve the physical isolation to prevent
hacker from attacking the system and stealing information. However, the vital
problem is how to establish and protect that big ﬁrewall between Internet and
intelligent transport system.
Concerning the high-speed development of relevant technologies, there will be
more new applications in the future trafﬁc system. And there will be some other
potential risks outside of this paper. Therefore, the researchers still need actively
explore the risks and offer the solution to avoid them.

Hierarchy Process
Haiwei Peng, Xiaohui Peng and Xiaogao Wang
Abstract This article takes the evaluation of Party building work in higher
vocational colleges as the research purpose. Through the access to information, the
establishment of mathematical models and other research methods,ﬁrstly, it intro-
duces the status quo of the Party building in higher vocational colleges and the
importance and necessity of the evaluation of the Party building work. Secondly, it
constructs the index system which inﬂuences the evaluation of the Party building
work in higher vocational colleges and establishes the evaluation model of the Party
building work in higher vocational colleges based on the analytic hierarchy process.
Finally, the feasibility of the model is veriﬁed by taking the grassroots Party
organization of a vocational college as an example. The results show that the
comprehensive weight of the indicators is basically consistent with the actual sit-
uation. The evaluation results have certain reference function for the managers to
formulate the Party building measures and the scientiﬁc development of the
grassroots Party organizations.

Introduction
The Eighteenth National Congress of the Communist Party of China proposed to
build a learning, service, and innovative Marxist ruling Party. Party building in
higher vocational colleges is an important part of the construction of the new great
project of the Party, and it is an important content to consolidate the ruling foun-
dation of the higher vocational colleges. In recent years, the colleges and univer-
sities have attached great importance to Party building work and take effective

measures to strengthen student Party building work, but also achieved certain
results. However, there are many problems, such as the emphasis on process
management, ignoring the results management, and evaluation management [1].
With the transition from scale to quality, the Party building in higher vocational
colleges is developing from extensive to ﬁne. To explore the evaluation of voca-
tional college students’ Party building work model, can promote the scientiﬁc and
advanced building work, conducive to innovation and development of grassroots
Party organization in higher vocational colleges, to urge all Party cadres to work
hard, wholehearted devotion to public duty, construction, and management of cadre
team of our Party is more scientiﬁc, fair, and transparent [2].

Construction of Evaluation Index System of Party
Building in Higher Vocational Colleges
The factors that affect the quality of students’ Party building work are multi-faceted
and multi-level. As shown in Fig. 1, based on the principle of orientation, com-
prehensiveness and feasibility, four factors, such as the construction mechanism of
the Party building, the performance of the Party building, the quality and function
of the Party members, and the masses evaluation, are selected as the ﬁrst-level
indicators of the evaluation of Party building work in higher vocational colleges [3].
In order to increase the measurement of the index and the accuracy of the
evaluation, the ﬁrst-level index is divided into many more speciﬁc two indicators,
as shown in Table 1.
Party building work mechanism: refers to the work of the Party system and plans
to complete the work. This paper mainly studies four aspects: development
mechanism, learning mechanism, activity mechanism, and supervision mechanism.
The performance of the Party building work: refers to the main tasks of the Party
organizations at the basic level and the achievements obtained. This paper mainly

studies four aspects: recognition, typical promotion, task completion, and the
development of Party members.
The quality and effect of the Party member: Party member quality refers to the
intrinsic quality reﬂected a Party member or Party members in nature from other
people, other organizations, the role of Party members refers to Party members
through their subject status, inﬂuence, and lead the masses around the utility
generated. This paper mainly studies three aspects: political thought, work ability,
and demonstration function.
Mass evaluation: refers to the teachers and students of the basic organization of
the students of the system of normative, scientiﬁc decision-making, management
transparency, the method of reasonable content, and recognition. This paper mainly
studies two aspects, which are organization evaluation and individual evaluation.

Establishment and Solution of the Evaluation Model
of Party Construction in Higher Vocational Colleges
Based on Analytic Hierarchy Process
At present, the evaluation of Party building work in higher vocational colleges
mainly from the perspective of qualitative analysis, lack of quantitative methods,
and the evaluation model of the operability is not strong, AHP is a combination of
qualitative and quantitative analysis method, and it has the advantage of systematic,
hierarchical, etc. [4].
3.1
Coefﬁcient of Determination
The determination of the weight coefﬁcient is the key to the quantitative research on
the quality of student Party construction. Whether the setting of the weight coef-
ﬁcient is reasonable and accurate will directly affect the scientiﬁc, reliability, and
accuracy of the evaluation results. The main steps are as follows:

seen from Table 2, three indicators of the grassroots Party organization supervision
mechanism, typical promotion, and exemplary role of the lower scores, learning
mechanism, mechanism, task and political thought of four indicators score higher,
indicating that the grassroots Party the organization construction of basic require-
ments, but because of the comprehensive scoring low, there is still much room for
improvement.

Conclusions
The evaluation of Party construction in higher vocational colleges is complex system
engineering, it is difﬁcult to use a simple deterministic analysis tools to quantify. In
this paper, the evaluation index system of Party building in higher vocational colleges
is established, and the evaluation model based on AHP is established. The results
show that the comprehensive weight of the index is consistent with the actual situ-
ation, and the evaluation results have a certain reference value for the evaluation of
the grassroots Party building work in higher vocational colleges.

Integrated Usability Evaluation Method
for Cockpit of Civil Aircraft
Hongjun Xue, Tao Li, Xiaoyan Zhang and Rong Wang
Abstract Cockpit of civil aircraft is the only most important cabin that pilots
executing tasks. The usability of a cockpit has been identiﬁed broadly as associating
with the pilot–cockpit interaction efﬁciency and ﬂight safety. However, usability
has been paid limited attention by researchers from aviation industry. The current
evaluation method may not be consummate enough, and the indicators are less
targeted for cockpit. Therefore, the paper aimed to put forward an evaluation
method taken into consideration comprehensive factors. The integrated usability
evaluation model built included product attribute, performance attribute and
impression attribute. The three attributes were then further developed as seven
indicators such as error, satisfaction. The second problem solved in this paper was
to calculate usability evaluation result accurately. The calculation method integrated
grey statistical evaluation method and DEA method to solve the multi-objects
decision. The method considers different groups which would lead to the evaluation
difference. The integrated usability method proposed in this paper has practical
implications for improving ﬂight safety.

Introduction
As a complicated system, cockpit’s ergonomics design is essential for ﬂight efﬁ-
ciency and safety [1–3]. According to the statistical summary of commercial jet
airplane accidents reported by Boeing, nearly 90% aviation accidents could be
attributed to human errors [4]. Improper ergonomic design may be the primary
factor that has direct effects on human error. Thus, ergonomic design and evaluation
in aviation become important for safe ﬂight. Flight efﬁciency, crew workload and
comfort evaluation have been focused on recently [5–7]. However, the indicators
mentioned above are targeted, and the ergonomic evaluation should be executed
comprehensively. The single indicator is not adequate enough to evaluate the
ergonomics design. Therefore, the paper aimed to introduce usability evaluation to
solve this problem. Usability has been broadly used to evaluate the users’ experi-
ence in web page, mobile phone, and so on. Usability in aviation has been used to
evaluate the human–machine interface such as communication system, monitoring
system, and GPS, multi-function control display unit (MCDU) [8–18]. While, as for
cockpit, the whole complicated system, the interface evaluation is not enough and
could induce the evaluation results one-sided. In order to better evaluate cockpit
usability, there is a need to propose an effective usability evaluation model to
evaluate the whole cockpit usability effectively and accurately. Therefore, the
objective of the present study was to establish an integrated usability evaluation
model to give the cockpit a comprehensive and reasonable usability evaluation.

Integrated Usability Evaluation Method for Cockpit
2.1
The Integrated Usability Evaluation Model
Usability was introduced ﬁrst by Shackel [19], and the four indicators included in
the usability model have been broadly used. Nielsen is another researcher putting
forward a usability model from sociology. The two models have some characters in
common such as error and learnability. Although the two general models are
broadly used, as for cockpit, the task executed there is always time and physical
consuming and highly attentive; thus, the indicators in the model are inadequate. To
conclude the cockpit’s particular product performance and the pilots’ experience,
the model built has three attributes, that is, product performance, impression per-
formance and pilot performance. The architecture has been further developed as
seven indicators, that is, operation quality, learnability, and error, cognition
workload, satisfaction of the human–machine interface, and operation comfortable,
inner microenvironment comfortable. The seven indicators are capable of evalu-
ating the cockpit usability and can avoid duplication of too many indicators. The
integrated usability evaluation model of cockpit is shown in Fig. 1.

2.2
Evaluators
The traditional methods always singled out experts to evaluate the objects. The
experts do have more experience, but the users may conclude novice pilots. The
designers to the good of better design should also be considered, so is the ﬂight
cadets. Therefore, the method recommends ﬁve groups participants concluding
designers, evaluators, and experienced pilots, novice pilots and ﬂight cadets. In the
model, the ﬁve groups are represented by I–V, and the number of ﬁve groups is
represented by N1, N2, N3, N4, N5. The average score for an indicator of speciﬁed
group serves as the score of the group for this indicator.

Calculation Method of Weight Coefﬁcient Matrix
2.3.1
The Method to Calculate Weight Coefﬁcient Matrix Based
on Grey Statistical Method
The weight coefﬁcient matrix was calculated by grey statistical method. Whitening
function was used to process the evaluation coefﬁcient of different indicators from
multi-groups. In the model, we hypothesise that there are ﬁve evaluation ranks, that
is, excellent, good and general, bad, too bad, respectively. Evaluation ranks are ﬁve
evaluation grey groups. We assign the serial number of the ﬁve grey groups as
k (k = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The score of evaluation result is represented by matrix D, and
the element dij means the score of indicator i from group j. The whitening coefﬁ-
cient function of number k evaluation grey group is deﬁned as fk dij

Preface
The inside environment of military equipment and the pavement make the working
microenvironment of operators very bad. The strong vibration, impact, deafening
noise, high, and low temperature result in serious physical and mental inﬂuence on
the operators, which will drop the continuous combat capability and efﬁciency of
operators. Therefore, comprehensive evaluation is necessary to the inﬂuence of
military equipment microenvironment on the operators with research on the man–
machine adaptability. In the aspect of comprehensive evaluation on the military
equipment microenvironment, since the characteristic and physical quantity of the
indices are not accordant, it is difﬁcult for uniﬁed quantitative evaluation, and such
parameters mostly deal with fuzzy measure, and then evaluation is made with the

methods are difﬁcult to directly link these parameters with the working efﬁciency of
operators for objective and scientiﬁc quantitative evaluation. This paper has made
research on the microenvironment parameters of the military equipment which
inﬂuence the operators, established the military equipment cabin environment

Research on the Establishment of Military Equipment
Cabin Environment Evaluation System
It is shown from the analysis on the typical equipment working task proﬁle and
features of military equipment, the microenvironment in the vehicle is bad caused
by vehicle vibration, impact, noise, high and low temperature, high humidity, noise,
dust, and harmful gas, which are the factors with relatively high inﬂuence on the
human–machine task performance of the military equipment [1].
The vibrations tested and evaluated in military equipment include the sitting
posture vibration of operators, hand and foot vibration, and prone position vibration
[2]. The noises main compose of the steady state noise in the vehicle when the
vehicle is driving and pulse noise produced during artillery ﬁring. The test and
evaluation of steady state noise focus on the A weighed 1/3 octave noise level, and
the test and evaluation of pulse noise focus on the decibel level of sound pressure
and the duration of pulse peak. The test and evaluation factors of microclimate
environment in the vehicle main compose of the temperature, humidity, and wind
speed near the operators. The evaluation method shall combine the task perfor-
mance of operators and temperature and humidity limit such as isothermal degra-
dation. The harmful gases in the military equipment main compose of inorganic
harmful gas and organics such as carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and oxynitride.
When testing in the vehicle, special attention should be paid to the indices of the
main instrument such as luminance, uniformity, and brightness. The evaluation
index of dust in the vehicle is main the dust concentration.
As a summary, the cabin environment parameters indices system which is shown
as below is established. The vibration, noise, microclimate, harmful gas, dust, and
illumination are selected as the environment inﬂuencing Level-1 indices, where,
vibration includes hand and foot vibration, prone position vibration, sitting posture
vibration are three Level-3 indices; impact includes two Level-3 indices such as
prone position impact, sitting posture impact; noise includes two Level-3 indices
such as steady state noise and pulse noise; microclimate includes Level-3 indices
such as temperature, humidity, and ventilation. Harmful gas includes four Level-3
indices such as carbon monoxide, ammonia, sulfureted hydrogen, and oxynitride;
intensity of illumination includes three Level-3 indices such as luminance,
brightness, and contrast [3]. Please see Table 1 for the speciﬁc indices level.

Basic Model of Environment Parameters Single Factor
Evaluation
It is found after analyzing the environment parameters evaluation standard of the
military equipment that the evaluation of environment parameters main has two
basic types. The ﬁrst one is the parameters adopting limit evaluation, for example,
the environment parameters such as impact, noise, electromagnetic radiation,
ventilation, dust, and harmful gas; the second one is the non-limit evaluation
parameters, for example, environment parameters such as vibration, temperature,
humidity, and illumination; the following two categories of single factor evaluation
models are proposed basing on the above analysis. Category 1: environment
parameters evaluation model based on limit evaluation.
When evaluating this kind of parameters, ﬁrst, limit inspection shall be con-
ducted: if it is lower than the limit, then quantitative analysis shall be taken for the
measured value according to the demands of evaluation; then, the weight coefﬁcient
is given for comprehensive evaluation. The ﬂow is shown in Fig. 1. What should be
described is that not all limit evaluation parameters, after exceeding the limit, will
immediate threat to life safety. This kind of parameter shall be directly given the

worst evaluation results when it exceeds the limit, and then the comprehensive
evaluation of other parameters and cabin environment shall be continued.
Category 2: Environment parameters evaluation model based on non-limit
evaluation.
When evaluating this kind of parameters, quantitative analysis and normalization
are conducted directly according to the demands of evaluation, the key is the
quantitative method; then, the weight coefﬁcient shall be given for comprehensive
evaluation. The ﬂow is shown in Fig. 2.

Conﬁrmation of Weight Coefﬁcient of Single Factor
Comprehensive Evaluation of Environment Parameters
The subjective weighting method is adopted for the single parameter comprehen-
sive evaluation of the whole vehicle. Both the level analysis method and the
optimum order method are applicable. Two methods differentiate the weight
through multiple comparison, but the level analysis method is used for multi-level
analysis with obvious advantage, however, the calculation quantity of it is relatively

big. Optimum order method has relatively less calculation quantity and is applicable
to the distribution of multidimensional weight of the same level. Since the single
factor evaluation of whole vehicle has less level, with consideration on the actual
operation, it is suggested to distribute the weight with optimum order method.
Multiple comparison is adopted for n factors, if index i is important than index
K, then index i is 1, equal importance is 0.5, otherwise, it shall be 0, the score is aik

Algorithm
Due to the importance of weight coefﬁcient, the method of conﬁrming weight
coefﬁcient has earned high emphasis from people. The common methods for
conﬁrming weight main include Delphi method, expert investigation method, and
judgment matrix analysis method. Delphi algorithm is optimized in this research.
The optimized Delphi algorithm calculation steps are shown as below: the evalu-
ation of the investigated personnel on the factor ui is used as evaluation matrix. The
evaluation score of digit k given by the investigated personnel on factor ui is
recorded as Sik, (i-factor ui, i = 1, 2, …, m; k-investigated personnel of digit k;
S—score), and Si value evaluation table of each investigated personnel is listed out.
On the assumption that there’re n investigated personnel, the investigation results of
all investigated personnel are combined to form one evaluation matrix with n lines
and m rows (Table 2).
The above-mentioned evaluation matrix is calculated as below:
if Sik [ Sjk, Pijk ¼ Sik  Sjk; otherwise, Pijk ¼ 0. Pijk means the rela-
tively important score of evaluation factor ui to evaluation factor uj in the opinion of
digit k investigated personnel, which is named as the priority score of evaluation
factor ui compared with evaluation factor uj. All Pijk values are added to produce:

The Comparison Study of Usability Test
Methodology Based on Eye-Tracking
Technology
Zengyao Yang, Yu Zhang, Meng Li and Tianning Chen
Abstract Eye-tracking technology, as an objective-recording method of user’s eye
movement data, has widely been applied in human–computer interface usability
test. The quantitative analysis of eye movement data is good at comparing different
UI designs; however, it can hardly probe the inﬂuential factors of usability issues
from a UCD perspective. This research aimed at improving the validity of usability
test, and tried to ﬁll in the gap of merely applying eye movement data in usability
test. In this paper, we compared the characteristics and differences of concurrent
and retrospective think-aloud on UI usability evaluation, which were combined
with eye-tracking system. We found that concurrent think-aloud would interfere
users during the tests, thus increased their mental stress and cognitive workload,
which suits assessing simple-operation and low-cognitive-workload tasks; the ret-
rospective think-aloud enables user to operate more naturally, thus is proper for
more complex task chain testing. Moreover, the retrospective think-aloud is more
efﬁcient for analyzing the cognitive factors of usability issues in-depth.

Introduction
In the assessment of the human–computer interface design, generally, the traditional
usability test methods for the user interface are that the participants operate the
interfaces, and the main testers record the user’s operation behaviors and analyze
the user’s operation characteristics, etc. These methods can provide suggestions and
help for improving the human–computer interface design in different degrees, but
the traditional usability test methods have some problems in practical application,

such as the operation of participants may be inﬂuenced by the main tester’s speech
and acts, the record of the result data is inﬂuenced by the main tester’s preference
and not very objective, the analysis of the test data mainly depends the main testers’
knowledge and experience and is too subjective, etc. The eye-tracking technology
can accurately record the objective eye movement information when users operate
so as to improve the validity of the usability test. Goldberg and Wichansky dis-
cussed the application ﬁelds of the eye-tracking technology [1], and the product
usability test is one of them. Goldberg believed the eye-tracking technology has
been successfully applied to the usability test and can provide design guidance [2],
e.g., when the user gazes at the interface element for an overlong time, it means the
user has a cognitive difﬁculty, while the user’s cognitive change can be extracted by
scanning data.
In the usability test combining with the eye-tracking technology, the eye
movement data themselves recorded by the eye movement system cannot disclose
the user’s operation, motivation, intention, understood meanings, etc. Thus, the user
data recorded by the eye-tracking technology shall be explained further by the user
[3]. In the usability test, the explanatory information of the data is mainly obtained
by the think-aloud method [4–6]. The think-aloud can be classiﬁed as concurrency
think-aloud and retrospective think-aloud according to different test methods,
wherein the concurrency think-aloud requires the user to continuously express
his/her thinking, expectation, decision, etc., during test, therefor it inﬂuences the
user’s actual operation; while the retrospective think-aloud requires the user to
recall his/her operation process after a silent operation, and when recalling, the user
will add or delete some information, which decreases the data accuracy. Pointed out
by Guan et al., using the video playing with the eye movement gazing path for
stimulating the retrospective think-aloud is effective and reliable, and using the
video playing with the eye movement gazing path for stimulating the retrospective
report is helpful for retrieving the information from the longtime memory [7]. But
he doesn’t compare the characteristics of the two test methods and the inﬂuences on
the user’s psychological properties. Found out by Bowers and Snyder, when the
common screen recording is used for stimulating the user’s think-aloud, the word
quantities generated by the user during the concurrency think-aloud and the ret-
rospective think-aloud are different, and also the contents expressed by the users are
differed [8]. In the usability test, the user’s operation ﬂow can be observed directly
during the test process while the user’s cognitive data has to be obtained by
think-aloud. The paper proposes to study and compare the difference of the user’s
output language types between the two test methods, and compare the inﬂuences of
the test methods on the usability problem analysis.
From a perspective of the improvement of the usability assessment validity, the
paper combines the eye-tracking technology with the think-aloud test and applies
the theories of design psychology, the human–computer interface, and user model,
to establish the user-centered usability test method and process based on the eye-
tracking system, to build the experiment platform, to compare the user’s subjective
data and physical data during the concurrency think-aloud and the retrospective
think-aloud by experiments, to point out the characteristics and difference of the
764

inﬂuences of the two test methods on the user’s psychology and cognition of the
two test methods, and to propose the applicability suggestions of the two methods.

Construction of Test Platform and Implementation
of the Experiment
According to the user-centered usability test method, the authors designed and
constructed the think-aloud test experiment platform equipped with SMI RED 250
eye-tracking system; we set a CTA (Concurrency Think-Aloud for short) control
group and a RTA (Retrospective Think-Aloud for short) experiment group
according to the two think-aloud modes, and analyzed the difference and charac-
teristics of the two test methods.
2.1
Construction of the Experiment Test Platform
The test object was the Word from Microsoft Ofﬁce which is widely used in daily
work. During the experiment, the tester asked the user to complete ten typical tasks
with difﬁculty gradient, such as amplifying the font size as “small one,” text format
combining two rows as one, and quoting caption in a crossway.
The experiment equipment used by the test is the RED remote desktop eye-
tracking system from SMI Ltd. The experiment platform was built in the
Experiment Center software system, and comprised of one calibration, one vali-
dation, 11 pictorial stimulations (used for showing the user’s goal task), 11 screen
recording stimulations (used for recording the user’s operating process), and 24 text
stimulations, and there are 45 trials together. The experiment also uses the
Affectiva Q Sensor 2.0 emotion measurer which was wore by the user on
the forearm wrist during the test for collecting the tested user’ EDA variation during
the operation tasks.
The test was conducted in the human factors human engineering lab, Mechanical
Engineering School, Xi’an Jiaotong University. The uniﬁed light source is set in the
laboratory so as to avoid the interference to the test results caused by visual fatigue
and illumination difference.
2.2
Experiment Process and Data Collection
Two test groups are set in the experiment, i.e., RTA as experiment group and CTA
as control group. During the experiment, the CTA group uses the concurrency
think-aloud to complete the operation content, and the users are required to operate
The Comparison Study of Usability …
765

and describe the operation process and thinking process while operating the tasks,
and the users are encouraged to TALK more. The RTA group applies the retro-
spective think-aloud to complete the experiment content, and the users are required
to be silent during operation (the user is allowed to speak to himself/herself). After
the two groups complete the operation, the video with the eye movement gazing
paths is displayed for stimulation and letting the users to recall their thinking and
operating processes. During the pretest phrase, the participants wear the Affectiva Q
Sensor 2.0, get familiar with the laboratory environment, and receive basic training
and psychological instruction for at least 30 min. Each test lasts for about 70–
80 min in total. There are 20 users from 19 to 27 years old who have attended the
experiment. These users are the average users of the Ofﬁce software. During the
test, the 20 persons are randomly allocated to the CTA group or the RTA group,
and the ratio of male to female in every group is 1:1.
During the test, four types of data are collected: (1) the conventional usability
problem data recorded by the main tester; (2) the user’s think-aloud vocal recording
data; (3) the EDA data collected by the Q Sensor wore by the users; and (4) the
objective users’ eye movement data collected by the SMI RED 250.

Experiment Data Analysis and Discussion
3.1
Inﬂuence of the Two Test Methods on the User’s
Psychological Tension
During the experiment, the Affectiva Q Sensor 2.0 is used for collecting the user’s
EDA data of which the unit is microsiemens (lS). When the user feels nervous,
anxious, or excited during the experimental operation, the EDA level will increase,
and when the user feels relaxed and calms down, the EDA level will decrease.
Three users are, respectively, extracted from the two groups for comparing the user’
EDA level variation tendency during the test, as shown in Fig. 1. At the same time,
indicated by the EDA mean value and standard deviation of the two groups
(as shown in Table 1), in the operation phrase, the user’s EDA data deviation is
clear, and the mean values are, respectively, 0.88 and 0.25 lS. The deviation in the
retrospective stage is not clear. It proves the user’s psychological tension in the
concurrency think-aloud stage is higher than that of the silent operation which is
more helpful for the user to relax.
In the concurrency think-aloud, the user is required to complete the operation
mission and describe their behavior and psychological states at the same time,
which clearly increases the user’s mental tension, and thus, when completing the
test mission, the EDA level of the CTA group is clearly higher. RTA group is not
required to operate and talk at the same time when implementing the test tasks;
thus, their mental status is relaxed, so the EDA level is relatively lower. During the
766
Z. Yang et al.

retrospective stage, both of the CTA group and the RTA group are required to recall
their operation processes, and at this time, their EDA data is not signiﬁcantly
differed.
3.2
Comparison of the User’s Cognitive Workload Under
the Two Test Methods
The cognitive workload is deﬁned as the total amount of the human cognitive
sources required for the information processing during task completion. The user’s
time spent for the cognitive activity can be approximately observed by the duration
of gazing at the screen when the user is operating a computer, and then his/her
cognitive workload during computer operation can be approximately estimated. It is
equal to the ratio of the think time (the duration of eye gazing or pausing) to the
total operation time [9]. The paper adopts the direct objective measurement method
to estimate the user’s cognitive workload.

The formula for estimating the user’s cognitive workload is as follows:
C ¼ T1=T2
ð1Þ
where
C
cognitive workload;
T1
total eye gazing time (ms);
T2
total operation time (ms)
The total gazing time of the eye and the total operation time are both recorded by
the SMI eye tracker, and after the data is exported, the mean values of the users’
cognitive workload of the two groups for completing the ten tasks are calculated
according to the formula (1). The average value of the users’ cognitive workload in
the CTA group is 0.79, which is higher than 0.69 of the RTA group. Indicated by
the data of Fig. 2, under the condition of completing the same task, generally the
CTA group is higher than the RTA group, wherein the biggest one is from task 4 of
which the difference is 0.35, and to task 2 and task 10, the users’ cognitive
workload of the CTA group is smaller than that of the RTA group.
The longer the gazing lasting time is, the more difﬁcult the user will be to extract
the information and then the higher the cognitive workload will be. Because the test
methods of the two groups are different, compared with the operation of RTA, the
user’s processing quantity is increased for the CTA group during task completion,
namely the brain needs the additional cognitive processing for TALK; thus, the
user’s cognitive workload is increased.

3.3
Comparison of Language Types of the Two
Think-Aloud Methods
The analytical key point of the think-aloud is the user’s subjective language
description. Hansen proposes the three types of retrospective language marks for
the eye movement records [10] as follows: manipulative operation, visual operation,
and cognitive operation. However, the cognitive operation framework proposed by
Hansen is oversimpliﬁed. In fact, the cognition relevant to the user’s action psy-
chology includes ﬁve dimensions, i.e., intention, understanding, expectation,
judgment, and memory. Moreover, Hansen only compares the user language data
under the two types of RTA modes (playing back the video with the eye movement
path and the common video).
During the experiment, by comparing the language data types of the CTA stage
of Group CTA, the RTA stage of Group CTA, and the RTA stage of Group RTA,
the extended language type framework is to compare three main factors—manip-
ulative operation, visual operation, and cognition operation—and the secondary
frame under the cognition operation comprises of intention, understanding,
expectation, judgment, and memory.
The experiment collects the vocal recording samples about 11 h, and on the
basis of counting the data types of the samples, the user’s think-aloud language data
types under three modes are compared, and then we ﬁnd out the user’s language
types in the CTA group in the CTA stage and the RTA stage have signiﬁcant
differences: The ratio of manipulative operation in the CTA stage is 53.4 and 35.9%
of the cognition operation, while the ratio of manipulative operation in the RTA
stage is 16.8 and 72.7% of the cognition operation. The total language amount
described in the RTA stage of the RTA group is higher than the one of the CTA
group in the CTA stage. The differences of the three language ratios in the
manipulative operation, visual operation, and cognitive operation of the CTA group
and the RTA group in the RTA stage are small. The ratios of the visual operation
data under the three modes is slightly differed and are, respectively, 10.7, 10.5, and
9.6%. The statistic ratios of the language types are shown in Fig. 3.
In general, in the CTA stage, the users describe their manipulative operation
most, which is relevant to human thinking characteristic, i.e., the human thinking
speed is far more higher than human speaking speed. When the users operate and
describe at the same time, the users’ key thinking point is for how to OPERATE;
thus, the language description is generated with the manipulative action. In the RTA
stage, the users describe their cognition most, and at the same time, the users watch
the screen recording playback video with the gazing path and do not need the
manipulative operation but only WATCH and THINK; thus, the users pay more
attention on describing their cognition operation.
Among the cognition operation data, the users’ language amount of the inten-
tion, understanding, expectation, judgment, and memory in the three modes are
counted, and then, we get the total quantity of the cognition languages in the CTA
stage are 127, which is far more less than that of the RTA stage. Among the users’

769

mean ratio of the cognition operation, the memory is 7.9%, which is the lowest, and
the judgment is 27.6, which is the highest. The intention, understanding, and
expectation are basically the same. The ratios of the users’ cognition data in the
three modes are shown in Table 2.
Among the data collected via the UI usability test, the users’ manipulative data
can be directly observed and judged during the users’ operation. The users’ eye
movement data can be recorded by the eye-tracking system. The users’ cognition
data can help signiﬁcantly to probe the cognition usability problem. In the retro-
spective think-aloud test, the quantity of the users’ cognition operation languages is

much higher than that of the concurrency think-aloud; thus, the retrospective
think-aloud is more effective for analyzing and assessing the cognition usability
problem.

Conclusion
The study of the paper ﬁnds out that when the eye-tracking equipment is used for
the usability test, the concurrency think-aloud test method increases the users’
psychological tension and cognitive workload, then inﬂuences the accuracy of the
test result, so it is suite to the simple tasks. The retrospective think-aloud is closer to
the user’s operation in a natural status and is better for the complex tasks or the task
chain test. The language description types of the concurrency think-aloud and the
retrospective think-aloud are differed in a certain degree, i.e., the CTA users pay
more attention to describing their manipulative action while the RTA users pay
more attention to describing their cognition. The ratios of three types of language
for the two groups in the retrospective stage are not signiﬁcantly differed. Among
the mean ratios of the cognition operation language, the memory is the lowest
(7.9%), and the judgment is the highest (27.6). In brief, the RTA is more effective
for intensively evaluating the usability problem of the cognition.
The study of the paper can provide a theoretical and methodology reference for
the studies on the similar topic, e.g., conducting a study of eye movement of
reading or visual searching state, in the psychological study ﬁeld; studying the
consumer’s visual psychology to evaluate the design and effects of advertisements
in the commercial ﬁeld; analyzing the driver’s driving psychology in the trafﬁc ﬁeld
so as to provide theoretical benchmarks for designing the control panel and the
cabin environment; assessing the pilot’s ﬂight cognition test in the aviation ﬁeld;
and analyzing people’s motivation, intention in social science. In the above ﬁelds, if
the think-aloud can be applied in study, richer test data can be generated by the
participants, and the validity of the eye movement study can be improved.

Construction of Backup System
and Operating Mechanism for Military
Archives
Shisheng Cheng, Yongqing Zhang, Qianqian Wu and Rong Liu
Abstract The military archives are a valuable cultural asset of the CPC, the
country and the army, and also very important information resources. Once the
archives are damaged, irreparable damage will be caused. Therefore, the estab-
lishment of military archive security system is the fundamental guarantee of
military archives work. Information security is both the ﬁrst task of the archives
administrator and the lifeline and bottom line of archival work. Based on the actual
needs and development of the military archives, we should use innovative means
and technology and focus on the military archive backup system and operational
mechanism. The only purpose of this paper is to scientiﬁcally build up a backup
system and a ﬂexible and reliable operating mechanism archive with the charac-
teristics of the PLA and provide a strong service guarantee for winning the wars.

Introduction
Archival data security is a key component of archival security architecture. At the
national level, archival data security has been incorporated into the “three systems”
(i.e., archives resource system, archival use system and archival security system),
which also show the importance of archival security system. At the military level,
with the in-depth development of information-based archives management, the
archives-related departments in the PLA has started the primary study on the off-site
heterogeneous studies of archives step by step since the second ﬁve-year plan

period but at a pace slower than local relevant authorities, not to mention overseas
relevant authorities. Anyway, no matter for local relevant authorities or for military
relevant departments, systematic and in-depth study on archive backup system
construction and operating mechanism is still needed. Presently it is difﬁcult to
ensure the safety of archival data or “win” the wars.
Especially in today’s information technology conditions, it is imminent to sci-
entiﬁcally construct military archives backup system and operational mechanism.
Combined with the military system reform, it is time to design this work from upper
level in a long run.

Security Threats to Archival Data
The archives department, like other departments, may also face various emergen-
cies and unexpected events such as earthquakes, ﬂoods, ﬁres, and mass incidents.
A considerable proportion of the archive departments have no prospective con-
tingency plans, or their contingency plans do not meet the actual work so that these
departments cannot play an effective role. As a consequence, before unexpected
events, they have no idea to do something useful, resulting in loss or damage of a
large number of archive data and e irreparable huge losses to the archival under-
taking of the CPC, the country and the army.
Especially in the information conditions, the security of archival data is even
more important. Whether there is threat of natural disasters, or the subjective factor
of the disaster, once the preserved archived data are destroyed, tampered or lost, the
consequences will be disastrous.
The factors that threaten the security of archive data generally include the
following:
(1) Natural factors: ﬁre, earthquake, hurricane, lightning, ﬂood, strong convective
extreme weather, industrial accidents, etc.;
(2) Human factors: reselling, deliberate destruction, theft, computer viruses,
operation error for violation of procedures or lack of experience, accidental
deletion and modiﬁcation caused by pressure and panic, etc.;
(3) Hardware failure: damage of media and hard disk, server downtime, equipment
power failure, memory failure, etc.;
(4) Software failure: database design ﬂaws, application software failure, operating
system failure, etc.;
(5) Network failure: failure of network connection, failure of network card and
driver, etc. and
(6) Wars and conﬂicts;
So, it is urgent and vital to effectively deal with the above-mentioned accidents,
to ensure the security of archival data and truly prospective scientiﬁc build an
archive backup system and its operating mechanism.

Main Links and Contents Involved in Archive Backup
System
To meet the integration requirements of the armed forces, ensure the permanent
security of military archives and scientiﬁcally construct military archives backup
system and its operating mechanism, following major links and contents are
important [1].
(1) To complete information works (including paper archives, photo archives,
audio and video archives, physical archives and special carrier archives, etc.) of
archives on all kinds of carriers in the PLA in accordance with the uniﬁed
requirements of the PLA;
(2) To research and develop new storage technologies, including advanced
large-capacity storage media and storage technology overseas, focus the study
on advantages of cloud storage technology application and fully discuss large
data in the context of storage technology while objectively analyzing the risks
of cloud storage technology to archives heterogeneous backup and ﬁnding
effective preventive measures;
(3) To study archive data remote heterogeneous backup, including selection of
off-site heterogeneous backup environment, off-site heterogeneous backup,
off-site heterogeneous backup media, location of off –site heterogeneous
backup (center), etc. [2];
(4) To study archival data backup technology and focusing the advantages and
disadvantages of several common backup technologies and the backup tech-
nology meeting the intelligent demand of user at the time of service [3];
(5) To study archival data disaster recovery technology, including the construction
of archival data recovery system and linkage mechanism, focusing on the
absolute security of data sources;
(6) To build up archival data backup mode and system, focusing on the combi-
nation of characteristics of archival data and user orientation and make study
and deployment for the PLA as a whole [4];
(7) To study the operating mechanism of archive data backup system,, unify stan-
dards combined with the actual needs of the army and use stable linkage
mechanism from the actual situation of the combination of peace and war to
ensure that the archive data backup system is in normal operation free of risk [5];
(8) To study and explore the relevant laws and regulation on the construction and
operating mechanism of archive backup system and establish the relevant
system in the form of legislation. To solve out the problem that different
authorities handle current archive backup works in different ways for absence
of relevant regulations institutionally by revising the “Archives Law”,
“Measures of Implementation of Archives Law” and “Regulations for Archives
of Chinese People’s Liberation Army”, study the relevant business standards
and management measures and deal with the issues like ownership, standard
and duty of archive backup works by law to ensure that the archive backup
works are conducted in order in a scientiﬁc backup mechanism by laws and
rules [6].

Basic Conditions and Signiﬁcance of Construction
of an Archive Backup System
Combined with the characteristics of archive works of the PLA, status of archives
management and construction of archives laws and regulations, starting from the
technical and basic guarantee of archive backup and other relevant works, we
should organizationally plan and scientiﬁcally build up an archive backup system
and an operational mechanism of the PLA.
4.1
Existing Conditions
With the promulgation of National Archives Bureau’s “Guide to Prevention and
Control of Disasters in Archives”, there are existing guiding principles for relevant
archive backup studies. At present, the archive backup studies mainly discuss from
aspects of strategy, principle, method and backup of digital archive carriers. The
study results have laid a theoretical foundation for the construction of the archives
backup system in the PLA [7].
At the same time, the archives administrations of some provinces and munici-
palities have deployed and implemented off-site heterogeneous archives back-
ground in accordance with the requirements of “Guide to Prevention and Control of
Disasters in Archives”. In the process of building up an archives backup system in
the PLA, the practical results of these archives backup can be used as references of
practical experience of the archives backup work in the PLA and the optimal
scheme for military archives backup may be summarized from the practices.
Considering from the existing conditions of the archives of the PLA, it is proved
that the archives backup work of the PLA has certain substantial basis and facility
and equipment conditions and fully equipped with the practical basis for this job.
For example, each archives department of the PLA has built important place
keeping archives in 1950s. When we talk these archive backup problems once again
today, these resources can be re-planned into the archive backup system with new
mission and role of the time [8].
4.2
Foreseeable Guiding Role
The archives backup work of the PLA is not an item of works of a local archives
department. It is a major subject to resist the sudden natural disasters, war and
human factors and to protect the military archives information resources. Therefore
the further promotion and application of archive backup work are impossible
without the deployment and study of the archive backup system starting from the
archive works of the whole PLA.
776
S. Cheng et al.

The military archives backup system should be discussed from the overall and
local aspects of the archives backup work of the PLA, which includes not only the
macro environment, technical condition and legal protection of the archives backup
system of the PLA, but also the design of speciﬁc implementation plan of the
archives backup work and making the military archive backup study more overall,
normative, coordinated and uniﬁed theoretically and practically in combination
with characteristics of archives of each military region and each service for future
implementation and mobilization of archive backup work in the future.
In the time of digitalization, information security is facing more threats from the
carrier, equipment, technology and personnel management and other aspects so as
to make the archive backup work more complex and uncertain. With the knowledge
of applications of keeping and backup of digital archives home and abroad, we
should standardize and study the best common format and path for the military
digital archive backup to provide a more standardized way of keeping the backup
and ensure the long-term preservation of digital archive information [9].
To sum up, the scientiﬁc construction of the army archive backup system and
operating mechanism is guided by basic principles of archives work of the PLA,
which may be used as a theoretic and practical reference in developing the military
archive backup standards and unifying military archive backup strategies and plans
in the future.

Qun Wang and Ruqiang Li
Abstract The paper selects the maintenance personnel of an engineering vehicle as
the tested object. Using the motion capture system, we can collect and handle the
various data of the maintenance. Finally, it makes up the dedicated motion library
and is easy to use. This avoids the handling and correcting problems, raising the
work efﬁciency signiﬁcantly. And, we extract the body appearance and the
anthropometric measures and record the basic postures of the maintenance person-
nel. Finally, it makes up the dedicated virtual human body. On this basis, the action
library was integrated into the DELMIA software, simulated analysis and evaluated
the visual ability, reachability and human body comfort with the DELMIA.

Introduction
In recent years, with the rapid development of the VR technology, the research
institutes at home and abroad make a great amount of exploration and application for
the important application of the virtual maintenance in the maintenance ﬁeld of the
VR technology. In the military equipment ﬁeld, the virtual maintenance technology
is applied to the Lockheed Martin tactics plane system and the F-35 plane. The virtual
maintenance training system is also constructed in the M1A1 tank and M1A2 mil-
itary vehicles of US army. The study of the virtual maintenance in China is mainly
concentrated on a few colleges and research institutes. Just as the other emerging
technologies, the virtual maintenance is also the product of the multidisciplinary
cross and integration and is mainly characterized in the following four parts:
(1) Full digitalization of model: The virtual maintenance belongs to the emulation
technology and depends on the model, such as the product geometric model,

assemblage model, reliability and maintenance model, and maintenance
resource model.
(2) Information integration of model: Solving the maintenance runs through the
whole service life of the product and relates to many subjects and professional
ﬁelds, which makes its dependent models various. The description models
include the maintenance process model, the activity model, and the resource
model. The reasonable integration among models is the signiﬁcant base for the
successful virtual maintenance.
(3) High ﬁdelity of maintenance emulation: The high ﬁdelity owns two types of
meanings: One is the high reliability of the emulation result, and the other is the
high natural degree of the interaction between human and the virtual mainte-
nance environment.
(4) Naturalization of human–machine interaction: The product maintenance relates
to various mutual actions of human–product–tool. The virtual maintenance
emulation can only accurately master the essence of the maintenance process by
naturally and realistically displaying these interactions so as to accurately ﬁnd
out the problem.
2
Virtual Maintenance
The virtual maintenance is the natural realization of the actual maintenance process
in the computer. It adopts the computer emulation and VR technologies and realizes
the natural processes of the product maintenance such as the design analysis of
product maintenance, planning and veriﬁcation of the maintenance process,
maintenance operation training and maintenance support, and management and
control of various levels of maintenance organizations, through the mode of col-
laborative work so as to reinforce the decision and control abilities of all stages of
the service life and all levels of the whole system.
The virtual maintenance is a new maintenance technology. It is supported by
information technology, emulation technology, and VR technology and enables
people to feel the product performance relevant to maintenance and the reason-
ability of the maintenance process of the product in future before the product design
or maintenance guarantee system is physically realized; thus, the prospective
decision and optimized implementation scheme can be made [1].

Motion Capture System
With the fast development of the computer software and hardware technology and
the emulation technology, the motion capture system in the developed countries has
been in the practical stage. With the VR technology becoming more and more

mature day by day, the researchers pay more and more attention to the ﬁdelity and
natural interaction of the emulation process. The motion capture system can restore
the human behavior and physical characteristics in maximum; thus, more and more
scientiﬁc research colleges have purchased the motion capture system which is used
for simulating the high-ﬁdelity emulation of the maintenance process.
The motion capture system of the paper is used for collecting the maintenance
personnel’s various maintenance gestures, motions, time, and other data in the
maintenance work environment.
3.1
Xsens MVN Inertia Motion Capture System
The Xsens MVN is a portable whole-body motion capture solution which can
capture the human motions without a camera and will not limit any motion of the
tested personnel, is characterized in high ﬂexibility, and can be used indoor or
outdoor. The Xsens MVN avoids the problems of signal blockage or marker loss
and saves the time spent for the captured data cleaning work. The Xsens MVN
adopts the advanced micro-type inertia sensor and the biomechanics model as well
as the sensor fusion algorithm. The collected data are recorded by MVN Studio
professional software and can be seamlessly integrated with the Autodesk
MotionBuilder plug-in unit [2].
3.2
Vicon Optical Motion Capture System
The Vicon optical motion capture system is the capture system based on reﬂection
and needs to attach delicate reﬂection balls (hereinafter referred to as the marker) on
all parts of the passenger. When the red light (or visual light or visual red light)
generated by the LED around the optical camera is shot on the surface of the maker
point, the marker point reﬂects the red light of the same wavelength to the optical
camera so as to conﬁrm the 2D coordinate of each marker point, and then after
being processed by the analysis software of the Vicon capture system, the 3D
coordinate of each marker point can be obtained. The human rigid body model can
be generated after recording the motion tracks of all marker points [3].
3.3
Software Environment
The Autodesk MotionBuilder is an important 3D motion software of the
AUTODESK company and can be combined with the motion capture system to
record the live actor’s motion. The Autodesk MotionBuilder is the world leading
3D role animation software which is used for making games, ﬁlms, radio and

television, and multimedia. It uses the real-time and role-centered tool integration
to capture all missions in the edition range from the traditional insertion of key
frames to motion. The software provides technology instructors and artists with
the function for processing the hardest and high-capacity animation. The whole
paper uses the MotionBuilder software for the post-processing of the capture
data [4].

Construction of the Maintenance Personnel’s Virtual
Human Body Data
In the study ﬁeld of virtual maintenance, generally the virtual human body is used
for maintenance training, assistant maintenance analysis, maintenance regulation
check, etc.; thus, the maintenance personnel’s human body model invented by the
computer is required to have the actual maintenance personnel’s physical features,
motion codes, behavior codes, behavior feature, and intelligence.
4.1
Collection of Virtual Human Body Data
In the virtual maintenance emulation, the virtual human body is used for replacing
the actual maintenance personnel for emulating the maintenance process. The paper
carries out the appearance feature extraction, collection of human body size, and
image photographing of basic gestures to the maintenance personnel in the speciﬁc
maintenance work. The collection of human body size data is shown in Table 1,
and the standard gesture collection images are shown in Table 2.

into the mobile type and operation type, wherein the mobile type motion includes
the maintenance operation personnel’s position movement and gesture change and
adjustment in the maintenance process and the operation type motion includes the
maintenance personnel’s operation motions for the object. Most of the maintenance
operation works use tools. Table 4 lists the main tool types and the methods used
for the maintenance work.
5.1
Motion Analysis in the Maintenance Work
Based on the man–machine engineering theory, analysis of the human maintenance
motion in the maintenance work process aims to analyze and study the human part
motions in the maintenance work. The complex maintenance steps are decomposed
into a series of basic work units and the corresponding human motions are mapped
by analyzing the detailed maintenance work of a component, and also the redundant

motion sequence. Now we take the maintenance work of replacing the crawler
board of an engineering work vehicle as the example for analysis, and the lists are
shown in Tables 5 and 6.

Capture and Collection
The MVN inertia motion capture equipment is used for collecting the human body
motion data of the typical maintenance mission. The process for capturing the
motion actually is more like shooting a ﬁlm, because it is closely relevant to the
time sequence and needs the site condition, mission division, actors, director,
script holder, cameraman, and the other relevant personnel. According to the
characteristic, we carry out division of work of the personnel for the collection
mission. Besides the test personnel and the undertaking of the prototype of the
human body, we also set one person for supporting the motion capture equipment,

one person for computer terminal monitoring, one person for adjusting and wearing
the motion capture clothes of the tested personnel, a cameraman for recording the
tested personnel’s motion process, and a director and script holder for the quality
control of the whole maintenance process script.
Although we prepare well, a plurality of problems occur in the actual collection
process, which lead to repeating the collection of every motion sometimes. The
weather also greatly inﬂuences the tested personnel, the test is carried out in the
laboratory without any heating equipment in winter, and the motion capture clothes
are also required to be worn in the way of being close to the body, and then, the
capturing can be more accurate; thus, the tested personnel cannot wear the heavy
padded coat, and at last, the tested personnel show unnatural and inﬂexible motions.
7
Data Processing
When the MVN inertia capture equipment is used for capturing and collecting the
motions when the human body’s feet are above the ground or the human body
crawls in a kneeling position, the drift or dislocation of the position inertia sensor
sometimes is generated, and then, the motion capturing is distorted. To this prob-
lem, we use the MotionBuilder software for the post-stage processing. During the
test, we especially videoed the motions of the whole maintenance process. When
processing the post-stage distorted model, we refer to the videoed actual motion
gestures and then modify the human body’s joints frame by frame, which is shown
in Fig. 1 in which the deformation of the ankle joints is corrected [5].
After adjusting the role’s joint curves, and correcting the motion and gestures by
referring to the video, the post-stage processing of the ankle curve is shown in
Fig. 2.
In the post-stage processing, we also correct some parts of the virtual people’s
ﬁnger motions and then divide the motion data into relatively independent small

section motions, and then correspondingly organize the big maintenance mission
and a series of small maintenance work procedures into a tree-shaped structure for
storage. At last, we respectively introduce the divided motions into the DELMIA
platform for test.
After the work, we ﬁnd out some problems which can be avoided in next motion
capturing so as to reduce the work amount and time for the subsequence post-stage
processing.

Conclusion
After capturing the maintenance personnel’s maintenance motion and maintenance
gesture, on the one hand, the design personnel can directly observe the maintenance
personnel’s status during work, and on the other hand, the design personnel can use
the emulation software to objectively analyze and assess the maintenance person-
nel’s maintenance visibility, accessibility, and human body comfortability on the
basis of the actual collected data. Based on the above, the data statistics can be
carried out to the maintenance work time through the emulation of the virtual
maintenance process, and then, it will be used as the design input of the mainte-
nance design to be fed back to the design personnel. Then, the maintenance
availability of the product can be optimized by design, emulation, improvement,
and veriﬁcation.

Decomposition and Classiﬁcation of Flight
Operation Tasks of Civil Aircraft
Xueli He, Lin Ding, Chongchong Miao and Lijing Wang
Abstract After referring to the analysis method applicable to the workload of the
military aircraft and the ﬂight operation manuals of the civil aircraft A320 and
B737, the paper proposes the task decomposition steps applicable to the ﬂight
operation procedures of the civil aircraft, and then takes the pilot’s normal operation
procedures of A320 as the example to carry out the task decomposition on the basis
of the ﬂight operation task decomposition method and steps proposed by the paper,
and classiﬁes on the basis of the obtained analysis of the human and machine
attributes. Combining with the classiﬁcation of the cockpit human–machine inter-
faces of the civil aircraft and the development of the displaying and control
interfaces, the paper determines the ﬂight operation task type applicable to the civil
aircraft. After talking with the expert pilots of different aircraft models, the task
classiﬁcation is consistently approved, and the expert pilots believe the classiﬁca-
tion table is reasonable and completed. For the results of the face-to-face talks of the
expert pilots of different aircraft models are consistent, the classiﬁcation at present
is believed to be universal to the classiﬁcation of the ﬂight operation tasks of the
civil aircraft.

Introduction
The analysis and veriﬁcation of the pilot’s workload are crucial to the design of the
aircraft. The air worthiness regulations at home and abroad show relevant
requirements on the work responsibilities of the staff and if the crew’s workload is
over high of the civil aircraft (such as the air worthiness regulations AC25.1523 [1]
and CCAR25.1523 [2]). The common design cycle of the civil aircraft is ﬁve to
ﬁfty years. In the sample aircraft with a pilot, only the workload prediction model
established by the task analysis method can be used for the analysis and assessment
of the crew’s workload. Since 1980s, there are many researchers begin to use the
task analysis method for predicting the crew’s load in the early design period of the
aircraft, and it mainly targets to the military aircraft [3, 4]. The task analysis can be
deﬁned as the study of the operator’s action or cognition process for completing the
task target. The task analysis generally comprises of the following contents:
decompose the tasks into the sub-tasks and simple task steps; all tasks are dis-
tributed to different persons, and where communication is required shall be
explained; describe the correlation and connection between the sub-task or task
steps; classify the task type (or the task step type); and identify the cue and feedback
that supports the task steps.
Now there are many task analysis methods that can be used, and all of these
methods decompose one task into a plurality of steps and sub-steps and describe the
personnel’ s behaviors according to the body activities or thinking activities (such
as diagnosis and decision) relevant to the system. In the article written by Kirwan
and Ainsworth [5] in 1992, the writers listed more than 20 task analysis tech-
nologies. Some mature analyses include the hierarchical task analysis method and
the table task analysis method, wherein the hierarchical task analysis method is
carried out according to the logics from top to bottom, the ﬁrst is the main target of
the task, then all branch tasks and sub-tasks, then the necessary conditions for
executing these tasks, and the ﬁnal target is the operation which shall be carried out
for completing the task target or the hierarchical structure comprising of motions.
And the table task analysis method can be used for special tasks or scenarios,
checks every motion (the most bottom layer) identiﬁed by HTA (hierarchical task
analysis) or other method, and it differs from the hierarchical task analysis in the
addition of cues and feedback analysis. Although these methods can decompose the
motion at last, all of these methods end at the motions obtained by ﬁnal decom-
position but not analyze any personnel participating the tasks or determine their
roles; thus, these methods cannot be applied to the decomposition of the pilot
operation procedures which take people as the target.
At present, a reﬁned task analysis method applied for the ﬂight operation of the
military aircraft of the methodology version deﬁnes the method as the task
analysis/workload methodology (TAWL) [6]. The early work of the method
includes the construction of a complex task scenario, and then decomposes the task
scenario into the task step, function, and operation tasks from top to bottom; then
decomposes every operation tasks into the sub-tasks of the auditory sense, motion,

visual sense, cognition, and spiritual motion. Kun Yang et al. [7] carried out the
task decomposition of the manipulation process of the takeoff stage of A380, and
decomposed the tasks into the six primary targets such as period before thrust or
startup, operation of startup and after startup of the engine, sliding, and decomposed
the sub-operation. Xu et al. [8] decomposed the complex combat tasks in the
coordinative air battle and decomposed the complex tasks into the periodical tac-
tical sub-tasks of the single aircraft on the basis of the task characteristic elements.
With the aircraft models are being differed, the design of the cockpit is also
differed, which causes different operation tasks, thus, to apply the established
decomposition methods and classiﬁcation of the ﬂight operation tasks of the civil
aircraft into the continuously changed design of aircraft models, the most bottom
task decomposition, and classiﬁcation shall be based on different models for study.
Thus, the paper proposes the task analysis method applied to the ﬂight operation
procedures of the civil aircraft, including the detailed task decomposition steps,
which are applicable to the classiﬁcation of the ﬂight operation tasks of the civil
aircraft.

Decomposition of Operation Tasks
2.1
Decomposition Steps of Flight Operation Tasks
of Civil Aircraft
After referring to the TAWL applicable to the military aircraft and the ﬂight
operation manuals of the civil aircraft A320 [9] and B737, the paper proposes the
task decomposition steps applicable to the ﬂight operation procedures of the civil
aircraft, as shown in Fig. 1. The following introduces and explains in detail from
the speciﬁc contents of every step of work of task decomposition.
(1) Design the scenario of the ﬂight tasks
Designing the comprehensive task scenario is the ﬁrst step for the task
decomposition of the civil aircraft, in which the ﬂight tasks, cockpit environments,
and outside environment shall be conﬁrmed. The ﬂight tasks mean the content
which is anticipated to be completed by the system, such as ﬂying from place A to
place B in normal takeoff and landing ﬂight. The cockpit environment means the
aircraft model, crew members, and the human–machine interface of the cockpit.
The outside environment means various types of factors or limitation conditions
during task execution, including day/night, various weather conditions, and various
landforms. The description of the task scenario shall include weather, ﬂight envi-
ronment, and aircraft notices.

(2) Conﬁrm the ﬂight operation procedures
After looking up the ﬂight operation procedures of the civil aircraft and the
face-to-face talk of the pilot experts, the ﬂight operation procedures under the
designed task scenario are conﬁrmed.
(3) Decompose the ﬂight operation procedures into the ﬂight stages
After the ﬂight operation procedures are conﬁrmed, the operation procedures are
decomposed into the time dispersed, continuous, and unrepeated parts, i.e., task
stages, for example, the initial cockpit preparation, cockpit preparation, before
thrust or startup, startup of engine, after startup of engine, sliding, before takeoff,
takeoff, after takeoff, climb, cruise, preparation for descending, descending, ILS
approach (or the other approach ways), landing, after landing, stop, safety check
after leaving the aircraft, and ﬂight again.
(4) Identify the functions from the ﬂight stages (ﬂight operation tasks)
Next step is conﬁrming the ﬂight operation task corresponding to each ﬂight
stage. The function is deﬁned as the motion collection of all single logic function
activity executed by the crew. The same function can be executed in different
stages. The functions can be executed at the same time in the task stage or in order.
The function aspects include the following: check the dashboard, communicate the
autopilot, rapidly move the throttle rod to the CL position, and select the ﬂap. To

the ﬂight operation procedures of the civil aircraft, the ﬂight operation tasks listed
on the operation manual are the functions and classiﬁed to the task layer.
(5) Conﬁrm the crew members corresponding to the ﬂight operation tasks
Analyze is the captain or co-pilot is the operation personnel corresponding to
each ﬂight operation. After clearly conﬁrming the operators of all operation tasks,
the operation task sequence time line of every crew member can be, respectively,
established.
(6) Conﬁrm the operation sub-tasks corresponding to each function (sub-task layer)
The sub-task operation (sub-task layer) is the activity which needs to be con-
tinuously developed by the crew for completing the function tasks. The operation
tasks can be carried out at the same time or in order. The operation tasks comprise
of the crew’s operation motion and the objects acted by the motion, such as the
operation motion comprises of check, setting, positioning, monitoring, and the
objects comprise of switches, rotary knobs, helmets, maps. After being combined,
some common operation sub-tasks comprise of switch check, check of rotary knob,
monitoring of map, etc.
(7) Corresponding analysis of operation task channel
Based on the multi-source and information processing model of Wickens [10–
12], each operation sub-tasks is correspondingly classiﬁed and analyzed according
to the ﬁve task units including visual perception (v), audio perception (a), cognition
(c), kinetic output (k), and speech output (s).
(8) Analysis of operation object
Clearly specify the object of the cockpit human–machine interface of each task
unit, such as the altimeter, driving stick, and throttle lever.
(9) Analysis of the attributes of the operation object
Based on the human–machine interface design of the cockpit, the attribute
analysis is carried out to each operation object such as far/close distance,
number/symbol,
static/dynamic,
and
single
information/comprehensive
information.
2.2
Demonstration of Operation Task Decomposition
of Flight
To the military aircraft, the ﬂight task scenario of the civil aircraft is simple without
the special task demand but only the two requirements on safe takeoff and safe
landing. The ﬂight procedures of the civil aircraft comprise of the normal proce-
dures, abnormal operation procedures, and emergency procedures. The chapter
Decomposition and Classiﬁcation of Flight Operation Tasks …
793

takes the normal operation procedures of the A320 pilot as the example and carries
out the task decomposition on the basis of the ﬂight operation task decomposition
method and steps of the civil aircraft proposed by the paper.
(1) Design the scenario of ﬂight tasks
Fly A320 in single crew from place A in a sunny day, there is not any abnormal
operation condition or emergency operation condition, approach in ILS, and ﬁnally
the aircraft lands safely in place B.
(2) Conﬁrm the ﬂight operation procedures
Look up the A320 ﬂight operation manual and conﬁrm the ﬂight operation
procedure in the standard takeoff and landing.
(3) Decompose the ﬂight operation procedures into ﬂight stages
The standard ﬂight procedures of A320 can be decomposed into 18 ﬂight stages
such as initial cockpit preparation, cockpit preparation, before thrust or startup,
startup of engine, after startup of engine, sliding, before takeoff, takeoff, after
takeoff, climb, cruise, preparation for descending, descending, ILS approach,
landing, after landing, stop, and safety check after leaving the aircraft.
(4) Identify the function tasks in the operation tasks (task layer)
In the study, the designed task scenario is under the normal condition; thus, there
is the normal operation procedures in the ﬂight operation manual, and the task
operation function can be obtained from the ﬂight operation procedures. The tasks
and functions are identiﬁed by taking the ILS approach as the example, just as
shown in Table 1. Initial cockpit preparation (35 tasks), cockpit preparation (43
tasks), before thrust or startup (12 tasks), startup of engine (7 tasks), after startup of
engine (11 tasks), sliding (22 tasks), before takeoff (7 tasks), takeoff (27 tasks), after
takeoff (6 tasks), climb (8 tasks), cruise (7 tasks), preparation for descending (16
tasks), descending (14 tasks), ILS approach (42 tasks), landing (10 tasks), ﬂight
again (11 tasks), after landing (9 tasks), stop (17 tasks), safety check after leaving
the aircraft (11 tasks), i.e., 321 tasks together.
(5) Conﬁrm the operation task of each function (sub-task layer)
Based on the task and its function, the operation motion and operation content of
each task is conﬁrmed to be completed. Take ILS approach as the example, the
motion of each operation task is identiﬁed.
(6) Correspond each operation task to the people channel
Analyze the motion of the people operation task and correspond it to the
channel. Take some tasks in the ILS approach as the example, the operation task
control by throttle to IDLE can be decomposed as the sub-tasks that the monitor the
speedometer to be 25 knots (sense the input task) and operate the throttle lever
(response to the output task).

The people’s information processing stages include sensing, cognition, and
operation; thus, the sensing, cognition, and operation tasks are analyzed on the basis
of people reaction. On the basis of the sub-tasks that the monitor the speedometer to
be 25 knots (sense the input task) and operate the throttle lever (response to the
output task), the channels corresponding to people include the people’ sensing of
the task is visual input and gazing information; compare and judge the cognition
task characteristics of the task; and manual operation is the operation task char-
acteristic of the task.
(7) Conﬁrm the attribute of the operation object
The operation object of the tasks in the above task analysis is the altimeter of
which the attributes are static information and data information. The operation task
is characterized in the lever. The following classiﬁcation in Table 1 is obtained by
the task decomposition of the whole stage of the normal takeoff and landing ﬂight
of A320 and the classiﬁcation on the basis of the obtained analysis of human and
machine attributes.

Classiﬁcation of Flight Operation Tasks of Civil Aircraft
Observed from the classiﬁcation of the human–machine interface and the devel-
opment of the dashboard, the aircraft cockpit has been updated for years, the
displaying interface of the cockpit of the civil aircraft has been signiﬁcantly
changed, but some traditional displaying ways still exist. The instrument devel-
opment in the cockpit has been gradually converted into the graphics information
displaying way from the former completed digital displaying way (indicator type),
and some single information displaying way for the displayed information is
changed into the comprehensive information displaying way. It is also found by the
development of the cockpit that under the condition without the touch screen, the
operation equipment of the cockpit mainly comprise of the driving handle (steering
wheel), the throttle lever, the pedal, buttons, rotary knobs, switch knobs, etc.
Thus, combining with the task decomposition results of A320, the development
analysis of the aviation instruments and the analysis of the operation equipment of
the cockpit, in the cockpit without the touch screen, the classiﬁcation of the ﬂight
operation tasks applicable to the civil aircraft is shown in Table 2. After the clas-
siﬁcation table of the ﬂight operation tasks of the civil aircraft is completed, dis-
cussion is made with the pilots of various aircraft models in the face-to-face way for
checking whether the classiﬁcation table is reasonable, completed, or universal. The
pilots drive A320, B737, Cessna 172, DA40D, and C90. The face-to-face talk
results show 80% pilots approve the classiﬁcation table, and all believe the clas-
siﬁcation table is reasonable and completed. Because the face-to-face talk results of
the pilots of different aircraft models are consistent, it is believed the classiﬁcation
table at present is universal to the classiﬁcation of the ﬂight operation tasks of the
civil aircraft.

Discussion
(1) Task decomposition
It is found only TAWL establishes and introduces the method and steps appli-
cable to the task decomposition of the model in detail in the available data: At ﬁrst,
the task scenario is designed, and the task is sequentially decomposed into stages,
sections, functions, and operation tasks; conﬁrm the crew members corresponding
to each operation task; and conﬁrm the human–machine interface sub-system
corresponding to each operation task. The model is applied to the military heli-
copter; thus, after being decomposed to the ﬂight stage, the task is decomposed to
the task section, and to the civil aircraft, compared with the helicopter, the operation
procedures are simpler and more standard. The operation task can be conﬁrmed
after the task is decomposed into the ﬂight stage. The task decomposition steps

proposed by TAWL cannot be directly used for the decomposition of the ﬂight
operation procedures of the civil aircraft, and the decomposition steps shall be
modiﬁed to save the unnecessary work steps. Also, although at last the assessment
of the load of the operation task is carried out from the channels of vision
(naked-eye/night vision goggles), cognition, spiritual activity, and muscle motion,
the operation task in the model is not decomposed to the corresponding channel
step. To clearly specify the corresponding relationship between the operation task
and the human information processing channel as well as provide basis for task
classiﬁcation, the paper will add the human channel analysis and the attribute
analysis of the human–machine interface system of operation under the condition
that the task is decomposed to operation tasks. Thus, the paper will establish the
task decomposition method and steps applicable to the ﬂight operation procedures
of the civil aircraft on the basis of TAWL task decomposition.
(2) Task classiﬁcation
Not all workload prediction models have the content of task classiﬁcation; e.g.,
W/INDEX directly assigns a value to the load of the task unit obtained by
decomposition. The task classiﬁcation is also greatly differed because the study
objects are different. Task classiﬁcation it carried out to the UH-60 functions of all
tasks according to vision (naked eyes), vision (night vision), auditory sense, cog-
nition, spiritual activity, and muscle motion. In the task classiﬁcation of MH-47E
and AH-64A, the night vision is not singly emphasized. The task is classiﬁed into
ﬁve types, and the classiﬁcation is same without any assistant vision (naked eye),
cognition, spiritual activity, or muscle motion. The man-machine integration design
and analysis system (MIDAS) and tasks loading model (TLM) established by
US NASA and headquarter of air line of US army in 1994 classify the pilot tasks
from vision, auditory sense, cognition, and motion. Although all MH-47Es are
helicopters, but their applications are different, the task operation classiﬁcation
types are different. The division of the task types is differed by relativity. According
to the human information processing mode, TLM classiﬁcation is divided into
vision, auditory sense, cognition, and response.
TAWL classiﬁes according to operation angles and the relativity of task types,
and the repeated classiﬁcation may easily occur, such as the vision check of the
static information status under the vision task and the check of the button position
status under the muscle motion; however, the information processing mode division
adopted by TLM can avoid the problem. But the TLM classiﬁcation is more
complex, and its classiﬁcation is designed for the complex algorithm. The task
attribute under each task type is divided from the attribute of the interface infor-
mation. Thus, the paper classiﬁed by combining with the consideration of TAWL
for operation and the consideration of TLM for task attributes so as to integrate the
human channel attributes and task attributes and then classify the ﬂight operation
tasks of the civil aircraft.

Conclusion
Based on the long-term work of task decomposition and analysis, the paper pro-
poses the process applicable to the decomposition of the ﬂight operation task of the
civil aircraft: (1) design the ﬂight task scenario; (2) conﬁrm the ﬂight operation
procedures; (3) decompose the task scenario into ﬂight stages; (4) identify the
function tasks from the task stages (ﬂight operation task); (5) conﬁrm the crew
members corresponding to the ﬂight operation task; (6) conﬁrm the operation
sub-task of each function (sub-task layer); (7) corresponding analysis of operation
task channel; (8) analyze the operation object; and (9) analyze the attributes of the
operation object.
Also, the task decomposition is carried out on the basis of the proposed
decomposition ﬂow by taking the normal ﬂight operation procedures under the
whole ﬂight stage of A320 from takeoff preparation to landing. In addition, com-
bining with the analysis of the human–machine interface of the cockpit of the civil
aircraft, the task unit classiﬁcation applicable to the ﬂight operation of the civil
aircraft is obtained. The sensing, cognition, and operation task unit classiﬁcation
obtained by study can provide basis for establishing the post-stage ﬂight load
prediction model so as to reduce the measurement work amount of the experiment
and measure the load of the basic task of the ﬂight operation on the basis of
minimum workload.
Based on the study of the prediction analysis of the pilot work load of the ﬂight
operation procedures, it ﬁrstly needs to decompose and classify the ﬂight operation
procedures. The paper introduces the detailed process and steps for task decom-
position and classiﬁcation, establishes the operation task classiﬁcation and the
classiﬁcation standards thereof which are applicable to the ﬂight operation proce-
dures of the civil aircraft, and can provide classiﬁcation basis and reference for the
task analysis.

a
non-deterministic Polynomial problem. The design experience of the past has not
been able to meet the design requirements of the layout of modern special vehicle
compartments. Through a number of typical compartments of the layout of the
comparative analysis, we can see that there are many existing layout options to be
optimized. Therefore, this paper proposes an optimization design method based on
genetic algorithm. By setting the objective function and the constraint condition, an
improved cabin layout scheme is obtained. And the operation domain and visual
ﬁeld of the operator were analyzed by three-dimensional human body simulation
software, and the ergonomic evaluation of the cabin layout was carried out. The
results of the study can provide some technical basis for the design of special
vehicle compartments.

Preface
The special vehicle forms the one typical complicated human–machine environ-
ment system due to its characteristics, and the vehicle, personnel, and the envi-
ronment interact on, affect, and restrict each other. As the development and research
of special vehicle equipment, the problem of human–machine efﬁcacy has attached
more and more emphasis, and the military standards have published the GJB
1835-1993 [1], GJB 2873-1997 [2], and relevant vibration and noise standard,
which provide the guidance rules for the human–machine environment system

design of special vehicle. With consideration on the great inﬂuence of the bad
environment factors in this system to the operator, vibration, a series of adverse
environment conditions such as noise, harmful gas, and closed space have caused
serious inﬂuence on the crews in the vehicle; therefore, the requirement on the
rational design of compartment layout has become urgent.
The compartment layout optimization design [3] is the layout issue in the
combination optimization. Analyzing the compartment layout design and opti-
mization from the angle of layout issue, ﬁrst, the systematic and overall realization
should be obtained for the layout issue. After the simulation modeling on the crew
cabin layout, this paper has created the preliminary design model for crew cabin
layout, promoted the optimization calculation of crew cabin layout on this basis,
and proposed the optimization design plan of crew cabin layout; at last, the efﬁcacy
evaluation software is adopted to complete the efﬁcacy evaluation of crew cabin
layout, and the suggestion on efﬁcacy evaluation of crew cabin layout is formed.

Comparison and Analysis on the Crew Cabin Design
Plan
2.1
Crew Cabin Layout Planning
The target vehicle is planned with four seats, including driver seat, co-pilot seat,
crew A seat, and crew B seat, where the driver is responsible for observing land-
form and driving vehicle; the operating equipment includes instrumentation oper-
ation station, brake, and acceleration pedal; the display equipment includes road
conditions display screen, observation mirror, vehicle control, and navigation dis-
play screen and reversing screen; co-pilot is responsible for road conditions
observing and necessary control tasks; the display equipment includes observing
and control zone; crew A is responsible for special reconnaissance equipment route
planning, course planning, and auxiliary control; crew B is responsible for system
information processing, conﬁrming, and correcting. Additionally, six crew seats are
set for the vehicle.
2.2
Crew Cabin Design Plan
According to the research vehicle prepositional power transmission layout design,
three plans on crew cabin layout design are proposed. Plan 1: Three crews are side
by side, one crew is at the second row; Plan 2: Two crews are side by side, two
crews are at the second row; Plan 3: Three crews are side by side, one crew is at the
rear side.

2.3
Comparison and Analysis on Different Plans
According to the comparison and analysis on the working space and crew working
comfort of above-mentioned three plans on crew cabin layout design, the following
analysis conclusions are produced: (1) Requirements on the working space: the
working space width of Plan 1 is obviously inadequate, three crews are side by side,
which causes inadequate per capita space width. However, the working space depth
of Plan 2 and Plan 3 has obvious advantage. (2) Requirements on the position of
cabin door: Three crews are side by side in Plan 1, which dropped the personnel
active channel, the front and rear row design of Plan 3 causes that the middle row
personnel is not convenient to use the cabin door. By comparison, the
double-people and double-row design of Plan 2, it perfectly solves the problem of
using the passage. (3) Requirements on seat adjustment: The double-people and
double-row design of Plan 2 increases the difﬁculty of adjusting the seat; however,
one seat of Plan 1 and Plan 3 can be moderately adjusted. (4) Requirements on the
display device: In Plan 1, crews are side by side, which is convenient for sharing the
display resources. Additionally, the blind area of driver in Plan 3 is also perfectly
controlled, which meets the design requirements. Comparing with Plan 2, the
installation
position
is
relatively
ideal,
but
blind
area
is
relatively
big.
(5) Requirements on the manipulate device: Plan 2 provides relatively big adjus-
table range for the driver, and the accessibility is relatively good; Plan 1 has narrow
operation panel position, three crews are side by side with low ﬂexibility; the
installation position of Plan 3 is relatively good, and the accessibility also meets the
requirements. (6) Requirements on the rear resting area space: The double-people
and double-row design of Plan 2 provides relatively ideal resting area space, but
one side resting area of Plan 1 and Plan 3 is relatively crowded.

Crew Cabin Layout Optimization Design
and Calculation Based on Genetic Algorithm
3.1
Mathematical Modeling of Layout Optimization [4]
The purpose of layout design is to conﬁrm the reasonable positions of varied
devices in the compartment. Therefore, design variable is the position parameter of
device xiði ¼ 1; 2; . . .nÞ, which is
X ¼ fX1; X2; . . .Xng ¼ fðx1; y1Þ; ððx2; y2Þ; . . .ððxn; ynÞg
ð1Þ
In Formula (1), xn; yn means the n, x, and y coordinates of ﬁttings, respectively;
n means the quantity of ﬁttings.
According to the above-mentioned crew cabin physical dimension, when
establishing the constraint condition of layout optimization, mainly the following

seven constraints are taken into consideration. (1) Working space dimension con-
straint: The physical dimension constraint of crew cabin is as follows: Length is
1600 mm; width is 1900 mm; and height is 1150 mm, which is the physical
dimension constraint condition of the layout container. (2) Active channel dimen-
sion constraint: The physical dimension constraint of the dynamic passage is as
follows: Width is 400 mm, and height is 800 mm, which is the interference distance
constraint condition of layout ﬁttings. (3) Cabin door position constraint: The
physical dimension constraint of cabin door is as follows: Width is 580 mm, and
length is 450 mm, which is the cabin door position constraint condition of layout
ﬁttings. (4) Crew seat dimension constraint: The physical dimension constraint of
crew seat is as follows: Common seat width is 400 mm; length is 450 mm; driver
seat width is 450–500 mm; length is 400–500 mm; the regulated quantity in front
of and behind the seat is 150 mm; the up- and down-regulated quantity is 200–
300 mm, which is the physical dimension constraint condition of crew seat.
(5) Display and control device dimension constraint: The physical dimension
constraint of display and control board is as follows: Width is 740 mm, and length
is 150 mm, which is the physical dimension constraint condition of display and
control. (6) Repair space dimension constraint: The geometric constraint of repair
dimension is as follows: width is 500 mm, and length is 425 mm, which is the
physical dimension constraint condition of repair space. (7) Seat and display and
control board space constraint: The geometric constraint of seat and display and
control board space is as follows: Control board display interface is set annularly in
the zone 400–500 mm to the eyes of crews, which is the position constraint con-
dition of seat and display and control board space.
For the problem of multiple objective optimizations, it is unavailable to weaken
the functions of at least one other objective when improving the functions of any
objective, and the below-mentioned objective functions are taken into consideration
in this paper. Since it is required that interference should be avoided between
different ﬁttings in the compartment, this paper adopts objective function F1(x, y) to
describe the interference distance, the better the bigger the distance is. In Formula
(2), Xi and Xj are the position parameters of ﬁttings, which have requirements on
interference distance, m is the quantity.

Such layout mode is similar to the layout in the original Plan 2; the optimization
calculation result has dropped the space of resting area on both sides; and the
distance between the front display and control board is maximized; and a certain
channel area is kept in the middle of the compartment, which is convenient for the
activity and evacuation of operator (Fig. 1).

Crew Cabin Layout Optimization Design
and Evaluation Based on Virtual Simulation
4.1
Optimization Design of Compartment Layout
Corresponding human body model [6] is established with reference on the 50th
percentile human body dimension data listed in the GJB 2873-1997 “Code for the
design of Human-Machine Engineering of Military Equipment and Facilities,”
which regulated the dimension data of Chinese men, and is applicable to the design
of space and dimension such as compartment, seat, passage, working station, and
compartment layout related to the Chinese men dimension data. The established
human body model is shown in Fig. 2, and this human body dimension model is
adopted as the object of crew cabin layout efﬁcacy evaluation in research.
After analyzing, the problems of crew cabin layout prototype include the fol-
lowing: the driver seat is too close to the steering wheel, which strengthens the
fatigue of the driver under normal sitting posture, and is not good for the driver to
smoothly operate the steering wheel. The co-pilot keeps at the normal sitting
posture based on keyboard operation task; both hands of the co-pilot will keep
below the instrument board, which will cause fatigue since the hands must raise
high. Additionally, the middle display screen is not right in the middle co-pilot.
Through simulation analysis based on efﬁcacy analysis software, it is found when
this co-pilot is reading the contents listed in the middle instrument; the angle for
rotating the eyeball leftwards is 15°; and the range of visibility is 31.1 cm, which
may easily cause visual fatigue. Therefore, the following corresponding improve-
ment measures should be taken: moving the driver seat afterward for a certain
distance; moderately lifting the seat of co-pilot, then both hands of the crew may
keep above the instrumentation operation station at normal operation keyboard
posture; moving the seat of co-pilot afterward for a certain distance; under the
precondition without inﬂuence on the driver operation; moving the seat of the
middle co-pilot for a certain distance.

4.2
Operating Regime Evaluation of Compartment Layout
It is shown from the operating regime analysis on crew cabin layout, after opti-
mization design, the driver can contact the steering wheel at normal driving posture,
which can drop the load of hands and increase the operation accuracy. The
instrument keyboard area is at the accessible area of two co-pilots, and the co-pilots
can conveniently touch the buttons. It is found through measurement that the
co-pilot is 40.2 cm to the instrument, which basically meets the requirement on
the distance for personnel to normally observing the computer display screen. The
operating regime veriﬁcation is adopted for the compartment layout plan after
optimization, shown in Figs. 3, 4, and 5.
4.3
Visible Range Evaluation of Compartment Layout
Since the sensitive area of human vision is from standard line of sight to 10° range,
in the 10°–20° range, the information can be correctly identiﬁed; in the 20°–30°
range, human vision is sensitive to dynamic information; therefore, the driver can
easily get the information displayed in the screen, shown in Fig. 6. When looking
directly, co-pilot 1 can see right side two-thirds area of the middle display screen;
when viewing leftward at 9.5°, co-pilot 1 can completely see the screen, shown in
Fig. 7. Therefore, the important information can be displayed at the right side of the
screen, and the secondary information can be displayed at the left side of the screen,
which may reach best visual requirement. When looking directly, co-pilot 2 can see
over half area of the screen; when the heat keeps still, co-pilot 2 can see the whole
screen when the eyeball rotates for 20°, shown in Fig. 8. Therefore, it is suggested
to set the information related to the battleﬁeld situation at the right part of the
screen, and the secondary information at the left side. Then, the operators can easily
operate the instruments without turning the head. To observe the left side secondary
information, it is comfortable to turn the head and the eyeball.

Comfort Evaluation of Compartment Layout [7]
Through simulation analysis, when the driver keeps at normal operation, the lumbar
force is 292 N, which is much lower than the ultimate value of 3400 N, and keeps
in the green and comfortable area. When the driver works at normal posture, the
stress of all parts is in the yellow zone range, some in the best range of the green
zone, and the degree of comfort reaches the best state, shown in Fig. 9. The same,
when co-pilot 1 keeps normal operation, lumbar force is 303 N, which is much
lower than the ultimate value of 3400 N, and keeps in the green and comfortable
area. When co-pilot 2 works at normal posture, the stress of all parts keeps in the
green the best range, and the degree of comfort reaches the best state.

Environment System Targets
in Macroeconomic Regulation
Yinying Huang
Abstract This paper was to analyze how the governmental planner established and
implied macroeconomic policies, with the objective of economic growth through
the study framework of MMESE. The main study viewpoints are as follows: Firstly,
the governmental planner’s macroeconomic regulation is deﬁned as a generalized
man–machine–environment system; then, with vector autoregression (VAR) and
impulse response analysis methods, this paper discussed the characteristics of
“machine” (economic policy) and found that policies have time lag, last for long
time and have widespread and profound inﬂuences; ﬁnally, combined with policy
features, to realize the basic systematic “objectives” which are “safety, efﬁciency,
and economy,” new requirements of the system are requested: to strengthen
ﬁnancial supervision and macromonitoring; to guide people effectively before the
implementation of the policy (forward-looking guidance); and to advocate
“ﬁne-tuning” to achieve the policy objectives with minimal policy costs.

machine (economic environment) to realize policy’s objectives and system’s basic
objectives—security, efﬁciency, and economy.

Man–Machine–Environment System in Macroeconomic
Policy Study
2.1
Deﬁnition of the Three Elements in Economic Policy
Study
In the macroeconomic policy study, we can deem economic policy decision-maker
—governmental planner, as the system’s “man,” such as the central bank and the
Ministry of Finance. The “machine” in the system can be deﬁned as economic
policy, including monetary policy, ﬁscal policy, and exchange rate policy, which
are the policy tools adopted by governmental planner (“people”) to achieve
macroeconomic policy objectives. “Domestic and international economic envi-
ronment” (environment) is not only the background for the governmental planner to
implement the economic policy, but also the basis of macroeconomic regulation,
with signiﬁcant inﬂuence on economic policy formulation and implementation.
Therefore, the paper considers the domestic and international “economic environ-
ment” as the most important environment factors inﬂuencing economic policies.
2.2
“Man–Machine–Environment System” in Economic
Policy Study
“Man–machine relationship” refers to the relationship between “man” (govern-
mental planner) and “machine” (economic policy), that is, how governmental
planner develops an economic policy, and at the same time, how a “man”
(governmental planner) to better adapt to the “machine” (economic policy) to let it
play the greatest effect”; “man–environment relationship” refers to the relationship
between “man” (governmental planner) and “environment” (domestic and inter-
national economic environment), i.e., how the governmental planner adopts to the
change of economic environment home and abroad, how the economic policy tools
inﬂuence the economic environment home and abroad, and how the environment
inﬂuences the implementation effect of the tools. The “man–machine–environment
system” in the study of economic policy is the organic system formed by mutual
inﬂuence and interaction among governmental planner, economic policies, and
domestic and international economic environment (Fig. 1) [1].

“Characteristics of Machine” and “Target
Characteristics”—Economic Policies and Output
Characteristics
This section uses the annual statistical data published by some institutions including
National Bureau of Statistics, the Ministry of Finance, and the People’s Bank of
China and uses data analysis software Eviews, mainly to analyze the data of ﬁscal
expenditure (representing ﬁscal policy tools), money supply (representing monetary
policy instruments), exchange (representing the exchange rate policy tool), and the
output (representing the macroeconomic regulation objectives), and discusses the
characteristic s of “machine” (economic policy) and its inﬂuence on the realization
of objectives of economic growth (GDP).
3.1
Descriptive Statistics and Hodrick–Prescott Filter
Analysis
First of all, the paper makes descriptive statistics and analysis on actual data and
uniﬁes a range of values of each variable: annual data since 1991–2016. The paper
conducts descriptive statistics and analysis with software Eviews. Among them,
Jarque–Bera veriﬁcation is a way to test whether the overall distribution shows the
normality. Test results show that the Jarque–Bera value of any of exchange rate,
ﬁscal expenditure, and GDP is lower, while the Jarque–Bera value of money supply
is higher with smaller associated probability, unable to prove that the sample is
subject to normal distribution.

Secondly, the paper makes Hodrick–Prescott ﬁlter analysis for economic vari-
ables g. As a commonly used decomposition method for economic variable trend
analysis, the Hodrick–Prescott ﬁlter analysis (H-P ﬁlter method) separates the
long-term growth trends and short-term ﬂuctuation range from the economic
variable sequence, as shown in Fig. 2. In the ﬁgure, the solid line (blue) represents
the raw data of each economic indicator. The curve of the dotted line (red) repre-
sents the trend (Trend), and the curve with the solid dot (green) represents the
ﬂuctuation item (Cycle). The abscissa represents the year, and the ordinate repre-
sents the volatility.
Since 1991 until 2016, the above economic indicators were showing an upward
trend. Fiscal expenditure, gross national product, and money supply grew faster and
faster. When observing the green curve of the variables representing the variables,
in the international ﬁnancial crisis of 2008, the money supply was signiﬁcantly
deviated from the downward trend of the Trend, while after Chinese government
launched the investment plans for RMB four trillion in the end of 2008, the
government ﬁnancial expenditure economic indicators showed substantial positive
impact in 2008. In terms of exchange rates, the exchange rate of Renminbi to US
dollar had dropped to 8.62 once before the exchange rate reform in 1994. In 2005, a
managed ﬂoating exchange rate system based on market supply and demand was
introduced. By the beginning of 2014, the exchange rate of Renminbi to US dollar
continued to rise and then dropped slightly [2].

3.2
VAR Analysis of Actual Data and VAR Analysis
of Fluctuation Items
Vector autoregression (VAR) is one of the most commonly used models for ana-
lyzing economic variables. Here, statistical analysis of actual economic data is
made with vector autoregressive model (VAR).
First of all, the software Eviews is used to establish an unconstrained vector
autoregressive model. The ﬁscal expenditure, the money supply, the exchange rate,
and the output are taken as the endogenous variables, the system default constant
c is the exogenous variable, and the lag order is taken as 2. Then, the author studies
the hysteresis structure of VAR model and ﬁnds that the vector regression model is
not stable. Now the author should consider the economic growth rate g. In the
following, the author considers only the distance of economic ﬂuctuation and
steady state. VAR analysis of each variable ﬂuctuation separated by H-P ﬁlter
analysis is veriﬁed. The VAR model is stable and can be analyzed effectively.
3.3
Impulse Response Analysis of Wave Items
Now the pulse response analysis is carried out by analyzing the ﬂuctuation values
from H-P ﬁlter analysis. The impulse response graph between each two economic
Fig. 3 Impulse response analysis
Analysis on Realization of Man–Machine–Environment System …
821

indicators is shown in Fig. 3. The abscissa in the graph represents the time (year),
and the ordinate represents the percentage of the impulse response.
(1) Impulse response of GDP to ﬁscal expenditure, (2) response of GDP to broad
money supply M2, and (3) response of GDP to exchange rate.
The impulse response analysis can be used to explain the response of impact of
an endogenous variable on the error term, i.e., the positive (negative) impact (the
upper/lower dashed line) of the standard deviation generated in the random error
term, the degree of the impact on the current and future values of the endogenous
variations. From the above pulse reaction diagram, we have the following ﬁndings:
First of all, the scale of ﬁscal expenditure has a positive correlation with the scale
of output. The response of the output to the scale of ﬁscal expenditure reaches the
peak in the second period, and then gradually decreases with the extension of the
period until it is reduced to zero.
Secondly, the money supply is positively correlated with the output, and the
correlation coefﬁcient is relatively high. The response of the output to the impact of
the money supply will increase sharply with the increase of the number of periods,
reaching the peak in the third period. And then, it will be quickly weakened, even
after the number of periods is increased to a certain number; after the sixth period,
correlation coefﬁcient becomes negative and may have negative impact on the
output.
Thirdly, the relationship between exchange rate and output has a positive cor-
relation in the ﬁrst two periods; that is, the devaluation of the Renminbi can
increase output by promoting exports. But after the second period, there is a neg-
ative correlation, when the devaluation of the Renminbi lasts for a relatively long
time, which reﬂects that when a country’s purchasing power continues to decline,
the output scale becomes gradually narrowed.

Objectives of Optimal Combination of System
4.1
Basic Objectives of Optimal Combination
of System—“Security, Efﬁciency, and Economy”
In economic policy study, simply speaking, “machine” is to achieve “economic
growth” to make GDP growth rate achieving the desired objectives. But at the same
time, basic objectives of optimal combination of system—“security, efﬁciency, and
economy”—should be achieved. “Safety” means no damage to human and
avoidance of all accidents. In the economic policy study, “security” means ensuring
the security of the entire economic system, controlling the systemic risk, and
avoiding the economic crisis or ﬁnancial crisis. “Efﬁciency” means that the whole
system has the best performance or the highest efﬁciency. In economic policy study,
“efﬁciency” means reducing the time for policy to take effect and enabling eco-
nomic policy to play its role in a timely manner. “Economy” is the most economical
822
Y. Huang

cost of system construction on the premise of meeting the technical requirements of
the system. That is, the policy cost is minimized in the economic policy formulation
and implementation process.
It is difﬁcult to achieve three goals, in general, to meet the “security, efﬁciency,
and economy,” and sometimes among the three objectives, there are contradictions
[3]. In order to combine these three performance indicators into a comprehensive
performance index, we can deﬁne a comprehensive rating as Q, i.e., Q = W1 *
security + W2 * efﬁciency + W3 * economy, where W1, W2, and W3 are the
weighting coefﬁcients for each index, respectively, and W1 + W2 + W3 = 1 [4].
The main factors that determine the three weighting factors are as follows: ﬁrst, a
country’s technical level and economic strength. Taking USA and China as
examples, both of them are the current world economic superpowers with striking
economic strength with relatively low value W3. Secondly, according to the type of
man–machine–environment system, the requirement of the macroeconomic regu-
lation for the system security, or the stability of the economic system, is higher, so a
higher value may be taken for W1; thirdly, according to the working status of the
man–machine–environment system and the characteristics of ﬂuctuations in the
economic cycle, the requirement of macroeconomic regulation for system efﬁciency
is higher, so the value of W2 is relatively high.
4.2
New “Man–Machine–Environment System”—Based
on the Characteristics of “Machine” and the Objectives
of the System
Corresponding to the characteristics of the “machine” (economic policy) in the
above policy study system, the effectiveness of a policy shows time lag and lasts
longer, so the inﬂuence is high. Accordingly, considering the weighted character-
istics of the three major objectives of the optimal combination of system, the
weights of security W1 and efﬁciency W2 are relatively high, bring new require-
ments for the macroeconomic regulation:
First of all, security. Because the “machine” (economic policy) has a wide range
of effects and long term of inﬂuence, sometimes the reverse cycle of policy may be
adjusted to positive cycle so as to trigger economic crisis. Therefore, it is necessary
to strengthen ﬁnancial supervision and macromonitoring. For example, after the
ﬁnancial crisis of 2008, the central banks of all countries have strengthened
ﬁnancial supervision and the People’s Bank of China has implemented macro-
prudential assessment (MPA) these years to resist the economic crisis.
Secondly, efﬁciency. The effectiveness of “machine” (economic policy) shows
time lag and may affect the efﬁciency of the overall system. Therefore, it is nec-
essary to conduct effective guidance before the policy comes into force, i.e.,
“forward guidance.” Since the outbreak of the ﬁnancial crisis, central banks of all
countries have paid more attention to the importance of forward guidance. In 2017,
Analysis on Realization of Man–Machine–Environment System …
823

China’s monetary policy remained stable and neutral and the People’s Bank
effectively guided by means such as instructions for ﬁnancial institutions and public
announcements.
Thirdly, economy. Considering “machine” (economic policy) has greater
impact, in order to ensure that the governmental planner can maintain the system’s
“economy” in the macroeconomic regulations, it is important to increase the fre-
quency of policy and reduce policy efforts, i.e., encouraging policy “ﬁne-tuning” to
achieve policy objectives with the lowest cost.
5
Conclusion
Through the analysis on the characteristics of “machine” (economic policy) in the
policy study system, it is concluded that the effectiveness of a policy shows time lag
and lasts longer, so the inﬂuence is high. Therefore, considering the basic objectives
of the optimal combination of the system, the author brings new requirements on the
system: ﬁrst of all, ensuring the security of the system. We should enhance the
ﬁnancial regulations and macroeconomic monitoring to avoid turning reverse cycle
of policy into positive cycle so as to trigger economic crisis. Secondly, we should
conduct effective guidance before the policy comes into force, i.e., “forward guid-
ance,” to keep the system “efﬁcient” and avoid the time lag of “machine” (economic
policy) affecting system efﬁciency [5]. Thirdly, we should advocate policy
“ﬁne-tuning” to achieve policy objectives with the lowest cost and maintain the
system’s “economy.” The inﬂuence of the solution to “machine” (economic policy)
is relatively high in macroeconomic regulations for the governmental planner.

Application of Man–Machine–
Environment System Engineering
in Design of Public Bicycle
Canqun He, Chenchen Miao and Yuling Jia
Abstract In recent years, the rapid economic development of China accelerates the
progress of urbanization. That makes the city’s public transportation face greater
challenges. As people value environmental protection and low-carbon travel much
more than early years, public bicycle demand will be increasing. However, the
ergonomics size of existing public bicycle has many problems. This paper bases on
surveying, statistics and ergonomic principles to offer a correction model. The
correction model provides relevant recommendations for the correction of size of
city public bicycle design and manufacture. Allowing users to ride more com-
fortable and safer makes the city’s public bicycle industry develop more vigorously.

Introduction
In recent years, with the speeding up of urbanization process, more and more urban
resource waste problems need to be solved. To settle these problems, the govern-
ment advocates low-carbon behavior. Thus, people’s environmental protection
consciousness gradually becomes stronger and riding public bicycle becomes a kind
of good low-carbon way to travel. Therefore, people’s demand for urban public
bicycle is growing rapidly.
Public bicycle should be universal, applicable and safe, comfortable and so on
[1]. There are three interfaces between public bicycle system and human: hand and
handlebar, buttock and saddle, and feet and foot pedal. For the size of public bike,

there are many notable factors such as the length and angle of the handlebar, the
length and width of pedal, and the length of the crank. Among these, the most
important factor is the seat height. Its size should be consistent with the correct
riding posture required distance, which makes people stretch the leg muscles
without hurting knee. Reasonable bicycle saddle height can make people be
comfortable when they are riding, and make them achieve the best mechanical
mechanics and biomechanics of optimal state. At the same time, it can avoid the
sports limitations and injury which are made by unreasonable design for contact
part [2].
This study focuses on the adjustable height of the public bicycle saddle and
provides a model for the calculation of the saddle height. In addition, it establishes a
ﬂuctuant correction model according to 1988 national standard data to better match
the current human’s body size.

Analyzing Limits of Adjustable Saddle Height, Comfort
of Saddle and Handlebar
2.1
The Necessity of Keeping the Correct Posture When We
Ride
A correct posture can improve the efﬁciency of cycling, and make cycling more
comfortable and ease. Besides, it also reduce the risk of accidents [3]. The saddle
height is crucial when people are cycling. If saddle is too high, it can make knee
excessive tensile damage, but a low saddle will make muscles not extend, which
leads to lactic acid accumulation. Therefore, we should adopt proper cycling pos-
ture and adjust the saddle height to appropriate place.
2.2
Establishing Calculated Model of Saddle Height Limit
The relevant size of human body and bicycle can constitute a simulated triangle, as
shown in Fig. 1.
a crotch height minus tibial height (dressed);
b tibial height plus sole height;
x the maximum distance from pedal to saddle ﬂat;
h the angle between the thigh and the calf of right position when people ride.
Limit design principle should be used to establish the model, because the model
must meet most people’s right riding posture needs. Then, the model uses the 5th
and 95th percentile GB human’s body size data, combined with range of ‘h’ (the
826
C. He et al.

most suitable angel of h is from 30° to 50°) through the cosine theorem to calculate
the upper and lower limits. Next, bicycle-related dimensions and saddle adjustable
height limit can be ﬁgured out through the ‘x.’
2.3
Analyzing the Comfort of Saddle
There is a close relationship between hip force and hip structure when riding. Pelvis
connects the trunk and lower limb. Contact with the saddle is the lower edge of the
pelvis of the tuberosity and the perineal region. At the top of the tuberosity, there is
a bursa, which can secrete liquid to reduce the friction and compression between the
tissues. The sciatic tuberosity is the main compression area. The perineal area is rich
in blood vessels and nerves, not suitable for pressure. There is a great relationship
between the force of the hip and the riding posture. Riding posture is generally
divided into two kinds, that is, the athlete’s professional riding posture and our
general leisure posture. The majority of users use leisure posture more when using a
public bicycle, so we mainly analyze the posture of the hip force.
When people use leisure riding posture, the angle between the body and the
horizontal surface is 60°–90°, which is a more comfortable angle. Because at this
time the human trunk is basically upright, the support point in the trunk is below.
That is, most of the weight of the upper limb and trunk is supported by the sciatic
tuberosity, and the oppression of the perineum area is reduced to avoid the dis-
comfort of riding.
When riding in addition to the sciatic tuberosity, perineal area is inevitable to
bear some of the weight of the upper limb, but the structure of the human body
Fig. 1 Simulated triangle of saddle, pedal and knee when we ride
Application of Man–Machine–Environment System Engineering …
827

determines that the perineal area is not appropriate to bear the weight. The size of
the saddle does not reduce or avoid the oppression of the perineal tissue and fat.
Prolonged riding can cause numbness and ischemia in the perineal area. A lot of
people have a wrong understanding that the more spacious and soft saddle is the
more comfortable it is. In fact, the soft saddle cannot support the oppression of
perineum, and too wide saddle makes thigh friction intensiﬁed in the process of
riding, causing discomfort. The width of the saddle should be reasonable and proper
and can be used to properly support the tuberosity.
On the other hand, the saddle has the same surface texture, no special parts in the
design of anti-skid parts. In normal cycling, ischial tuberosity mainly bears the
pressure. However, on the bumpy road, the hips will inevitably slide forward,
which makes the ischial tuberosity in vain, and coccyx takes the place of ischial
tuberosity to bear the pressure.
2.4
Human Factor Analysis of Handlebar
In view of the anatomical structure of the hand, the muscles of the palm are least. In
contrast, the ball muscles of ﬁnger and thenar muscles are the most abundant. They
are the natural shock absorber of the hand. There are many nerve endings in
interphalangeal interosseus muscle and ﬁnger muscle [4].
In addition, from the anatomical structure of the wrist, the wrist is in the middle
of the relaxed state when the wrist is operated in a straight line. When the wrist is
away from the center position in palmar ﬂexion, it will cause pain because of
ﬂexion, dorsiﬂexion and ulnar deviation. We can relieve pain by stretching tendon
of wrist. That will cause discomfort to the users.
This requires a handlebar and saddle for relative position. On the other hand, the
suitable angle of the brake can make the wrist and hand be in a straight line. Especially,
the brake handle angle is very important for safe riding. The right angle can make the
muscles of the hand in the most comfortable state, and the most rapid force and
response. As shown in Fig. 2, the ﬁrst one is correct, and the latter is wrong.
Fig. 2 Three conditions of brake handle angle
828
C. He et al.

2.5
Human–Machine Improvement
When the saddle has a groove, the equivalent stress of the human body is much
smaller than that of the non-groove, and the force of the perineal area is greatly
reduced [5]. Taking into account the reduction of pressure on the perineum area, it
is recommended that the saddle is hollow and has a groove.
In addition, the saddle ﬁlling should be solid ﬂat. The surface coating of the
saddle is suggested to be treated with anti-slip in the rear to avoid the displacement
of the ischial tuberosity.
For handlebar, its size should be consistent with the data of hand. The brake
angle can be designed to be adjustable. Besides, we can add a suitable support on
the lateral handlebar, as shown in Fig. 3. Handlebar shape should be designed to
have adequate clearance between the hold position and the palm and interpha-
langeal muscles. In order to reduce the pressure and friction between the muscle and
the palm phalanx, that palm has good blood circulation, and nerve is not under a
strong compression [6].

Correcting the Old National Standard
3.1
Establishing Calculated Model of Saddle Height Limit
Among the three interfaces between human and bicycle, the most important is the
one between bicycle saddle and people’s buttocks, because it can decide whether
the legs can stretch and have a great impact on riding comfort. So the height of
bicycle saddle should be calculated carefully in our design. Next, the basic model
for calculating the limit height of bicycle saddle is tried to be established.

3.2
Establishing the National Standard Size Correction
Base Model
The size of the human body is extremely complex and affected by many factors so
as to cause the obvious difference between individuals. Nevertheless, there is a
certain mathematical relationship between the various parts of the body and height
[7]. In general, the proportion of adult human body size basically unchanged within
a long time.
Therefore, we measure the body size data of users widely and analyze the data.
Then, we can get an approximate ﬂuctuate value of size by comparing the data with
the old one. Finally, we can use the ﬂuctuated value to correct the design parameters
of the original. We may not get the perfect parameters, but the parameters after
correction must be better. So we can make user more comfortable.
The basic model is:
P ¼ M  N
ð
Þ=N
ð1Þ
In this formula,
P is the ﬂuctuated value;
M is the date of random sample for people now;
N is the date of old national standard GB1000-88.
T ¼ S  1 þ P
ð
Þ
ð2Þ
In this formula,
T is the parameter after correction;
S is the parameter calculated from old national standard GB1000-88.

The Application Methods of Public Bicycle Man–
Machine–Environment System Design
In the process of design and manufacture, the man–machine–environment system
for public bicycle has many size requirements. However, due to cost considerations,
we can mainly consider the adjustable limits of saddle height. We can apply two
basic models established in this paper in order to offer help for design of public
bicycle.
Adjustable height of saddle can be ﬁgured out by the following three processes:
1. According to the calculated model of saddle height limit, we can use the data
from the national standard (GB1000-88) to calculate the initial value.
830
C. He et al.

2. Measuring the human body size data for bicycle users widely and analyzing the
data by statistical methods and then using the national standard size correction
base model to get correction factor.
3. Correcting the initial value in process 1 by correction factor in process 2, we can
get ﬁnal data which are a practical reference guide.

Conclusion
At present, more and more people like to use public bicycle because it is a kind of
low-carbon way to travel. Because of the complexity of the bicycle sharing system,
the basic model established in this paper may not be very accurate. However, it is
enlightening for the human–machine system improvement of public bicycle.
Application and research of ergonomics have been placed on a vital position.
The human–machine system of public bicycle must be improved in the future.
However, there are some limitations in this study due to the reasons that the
national standard data are outdated. So we hope that database for human’s body size
measurement can be improved as soon as possible.

Abstract In order to improve the effectiveness of information presenting and con-
veying, apply the four-dimensional system of Information Interaction Design—
“environment–human–object–technology” into the Guidance System Design by
decomposing the various factors and extracting useful information from complex data
to understand the structure and interaction relation. Taking Pingle Ancient Town as
an example, collecting and choosing data from the four-dimensional system is a
design basis for guide spots, carriers, and information interaction to make the
information receivers more efﬁcient to get information with better experience.

The goal of industrial design is to design some products through proper way to
balance the relation between human–machine–environment system, which can
satisfy the need of customers and be ﬁt to market tendency. When the industrial
society evolves into information society, industrial design has to adjust some
methods to design some products and pay more attention to information interaction
and user experience.v

color, and material integrated into the whole environment and keeps harmonization
with them. Guide design is a simple, easy-to-understand visual form in public
places, so that people can master the guidance of spatial information effectively [2].
The traditional “human–machine–environment” system is adjusted into “environ-
ment–human–object–technology” according to the user-centered design (UCD) and
the elements and their attributions in guide system: Environment–human–object–
technology (EHOT), in which the human and the environment are exteriorly
deﬁned elements of the guide design and the objects and technologies are the
internal components of the guide design.
Information is a form of cognition about the state of objective things. It is the
third needed resource to maintain human society and economic activities, and it is
the experience, knowledge, and wisdom needed for decision-making, planning, and
action [3]. From the point of design, an information activity is to convert all kinds
of data into valuable information combined with speciﬁc context, which will be
easily understanding and applicable for users. In terms of design of guidance
system, the information activity starts from data collection and ends at information
presentation.
2
Design Content and Principles of Guidance System
Design content of guidance system generally includes spot layout, carrier, and
information transmission, and its design principles have certain similarities in
presentation and communication of information.
2.1
Guide Spot Layout and Design
It is necessary to balance the overall style of scenic spots in an area, the distribution
of scenic spots, the tour route, and other basic elements such as ﬁreﬁghting, ven-
tilation, strong electricity, weak electricity, basic decoration, and the application of
VI. Different types of guide information carrier should be placed in the appropriate
three-dimensional space to ensure that users get access to relevant information, the
design of guide spots with the speciﬁc space environment, tour routes, ﬂow of
visitors, and psychology/behavior of users’ pathﬁnding which are closely related to
general need to follow scientiﬁc principles and levels of guiding.
2.2
Design of Guide Information Carrier
Guide information carrier is an intermediary between information and audience,
which is important for guide information. Generally, design of carrier belongs to the
834
Y. Wu

category of product design. Design of guide carrier refers to the integrated use of
shape, color, material, and ﬁt to the environment with regional cultural character-
istics. The design principles of carrier are environmental coordination, durable,
reliable, easy to use, easy maintenance, easy to identify, display accurately, cultural
and visual unity, information recognition, and weather ability [4].
2.3
Design of Information Communication
Designer usually uses graphic, symbol, text, color, sound, etc. to convey clearly and
orderly effective information to the audiences and users. The information trans-
mission needs to be correct and fast, and seek the individuality and change in unity.
According to different functions, information communication design is generally
divided into ﬁve types: the identiﬁcation of guidance, guided guidance, spatial
guide, information guide, and management-type guide [5]. Generally, the design
principles are information identiﬁcation, visual uniﬁcation, orientation hierarchy,
cultural unity, interactive novelty, and environmental coordination.

Design Model of Guidance System Based
on the “Environment–Human–Object–Technology”
With the development of Internet of Things and the construction of Intelligent City,
the guidance system shows a scientiﬁc, intelligent, interactive design trends. The
interaction between the four elements (environment–human–object–technology)
includes six levels of interaction: (1) environment–human, the relationship and
emotional communication between environment, users, and information trans-
porter; (2) environment–object, including time, spot, and location of guide infor-
mation carrier and information transmission; (3) environment–technology, the
interaction between social environment, cultural environment, and technology;
(4) human–object, the effectiveness of information communication and the inter-
action between users and objects; (5) human–technology, the interaction experience
and emotional communication between human and technology; (6) object–tech-
nology, the mutual inﬂuence and effect between objects, output information
products, and technology.
In the design of guidance system, there are some main points including how to
collect the key data and how to extract effective information, so as to optimize the
relationship between environment, users (human), products (object), and technol-
ogy. Then, the output of information product will balance the three aspects, spot
layout, carriers, and information, to satisfy the requirement of users during their
path ﬁnding, both mentality and behavior [6].

Design Application of Guidance System Based
on “Environment–Human–Object–Technology”
Pingle is a historical and cultural town in Chengdu, “the top ten charm towns,”
which has its beautiful natural environment, rich tourism resources, and a long
history and culture to attract endless visitors. In 2015, Chengdu Municipal
Government and Scenic Area Management Committee began to upgrade and
transform the ancient town, to create the national 5A scenic area [7], so redesigning
the guide system is one project of this important program.
4.1
Arrangement and Design of Guide Spots
The external qualifying factors, “environment” and “human,” are the key of
arrangement and design of guide spots. The main methods of data acquisition are
ﬁeld survey, county records, scenic area management committee, and observation
of the ﬂow of people in some intensive areas, combined with the survey results of
random sampling of user to select data. Because of the complexity of the obtained
data and the limited space, this paper presents only some key data and information
in Fig. 1. Design researchers proposed the design of guide spots after understanding
and reﬁning the data and information with social environment.
Through the inspection of county records and the ﬁeld investigation of “envi-
ronment” factor, the obtained data include the following: the ﬁrst town of Silk Road
in south of China, a total of 33 streets, a total of 54 scenic spots, one exhibition of
intangible cultural heritage, ancient architecture of dynasty Ming and Qing.
Through interviews to investigate “human” factors, the obtained data include the
following: 65% vacation, 27% weekend; 1-day visit accounted for 49%, 2-day tour
43%, more than 3-day visit 8%; 92% of the tourists to visit the attractions not more
than 12, the ﬁrst day of the tour accounted for 27%. Almost every fresh visitor will
visit the Baimo River, the Millennium banyan, Le Shan Bridge. Then, the design
researchers get some valid information for design with the data of “environment”

factor and “human” factor: the key areas of design, the best tour route, and the
diversion of crowd in the core area.
4.2
Design Basis and Program of Guide Information
Carrier
The guide information carrier is presented in the form of “object,” which involves
three factors: “environment–human–technology.” (1) “Object–environment,” is the
relationship between the carrier and the ancient town of Pingle. The design of guide
information carrier also needs to consider the carrier itself, shape, color, material,
and environment coordination to reﬂect the local humanistic spirit, the natural
environment. (2) “Object–human,” is the relationship between the guide carrier and
the tourists, such as whether visitors can accurately ﬁnd the guide carrier and obtain
valid information with a pleasant experience. The data of “human” which inﬂuence
the design of carrier include the composition of tourist ﬂow, the esthetic of tourists,
their psychology of road-ﬁnding, human–machine data, and so on. (3) “Object–
technology” refers to the relationship between guide carrier and its implementation
technology. The relevant data of “technology” include transportation of material,
processing production, surface treatment, installation and maintenance, energy
consumption, and so on.
Fig. 2 can show the process of designer’s thinking and work, the opposite nar-
ration of the paragraph can help reader think how to form the design result.
According to the design of guide spots in Pingle, the guide carrier and its infor-
mation will be represented in upper, middle, and lower three-level space. The shape,
color, and texture of guide carrier should be coordinated with the environment
showing the 2000-year-old culture. The massive data of “environment–human–
technology” will effect together on the three aspects: “shape–color–wood”. Light
gray, dark gray, wood grain, black, and red are the main colors of guide carriers,
depending on the position and the color recognition of tourists. The materials in the
guide carrier are mainly natural, such as stone, solid wood, supplemented with
aluminum, copper, and other durable metal materials.

4.3
Design Basis of Guide Information Communication
The design of guiding information communication is mainly based on the visual
elements, which belongs to the scope of “object” and is inﬂuenced by three factors
“environment–human–technology.” In this program, guide information has certain
normative requirements to ﬁt the relative standards and regulations, due to the
limitation of “environment”.
Design of guide information communication needs to consider the characteristics
of human visual system. According to some data of ergonomics on human head
rotation and characteristics of human eye area, design of guide carrier has some
scientiﬁc basic to enable visitors to quickly obtain the required information.
According to the measurement of distance between visitors and guide carrier, when
the distance is 25 m, the height of Chinese font on sign board is less than 90 mm so
35% of users cannot effectively read the information [8]. The color of information
based on visual communication depends on the function of guide carrier, emphasizing
visual contrast in design. Information communication based on hearing and interactive
experience is an auxiliary means. In the cultural blocks and eight sub-cultural heritage
sites, some interactive area of multimedia are set up, then visitors can receive more
guide information of Pingle to enhance the overall tourist experience.
5
Conclusion
The essence of guidance system design is effective information communication. By
using the four-dimensional system of information interaction design, we can easily
and clearly carry out investigation and research on each factor and realize the
collection, collation, and research of information data, the choice of guide spots, the
design of information content, and the carriers in the right exhibition; designer
should pay attention to the effectiveness of information conveyed.

Study of Man–Machine–Environment
System Engineering on University Library
Under Internet Condition
Kunzhu Zhang and Quan Yuan
Abstract The library plays an important role in the education and research of higher
education. An effective man–machine–environment system (MMES) can guarantee
the full and efﬁcient use of the library information resources by the teachers and
students. Based on the ergonomics theory, this paper investigates the composition
factors of the MMES of the university library and its interrelations, analyzes the
typical man–machine interface and the main humanistic function of the library in
current Internet conditions, and discusses the optimization method of the MMES.
The results show that in the network environment, the man–machine–environment
system of university library contains many virtual man–machine interfaces and the
man–machine interaction factors. Internet-based applications are the characteristics
of the current university library, and the university library in the network environ-
ment should pay attention to man–machine interaction interface construction and
humanized self-service function promotion. The conclusions may provide some
implications for network-based and human-oriented improvement of the university
library.

intellectualization, and humanity. People usually use computers, mobile phones,
and handheld computers and other media information to query, read, and access the
data; therefore, in the library’s man–machine–environment system, there are more

interfaces
and
human–computer
interactions.
Although the traditional paper reading has not been replaced electronically, the
electronic means has been extensively used as a convenient tool for readers to
obtain information and enhance the human-oriented effectiveness of the library
from multiple media.
At present, the applications of ergonomics theory and technology become
extensive day by day in various industries. However, there are few studies on the
application of ergonomics in the library [1–7], the development of overseas libraries
is faster with the complete facilities [8], and the relevant studies is still visible [9–11],
but not as a hot topic. Moreover, these studies are made only starting from the reading
[3], attendance, circulation, and other basic man–machine system functions, such as
the local studies on reading room design [3], bookshelf construction [4], furniture
[5, 6], lighting environment optimization [2], learning space management [7],
security [11], and others without a uniﬁed analysis from the view of human–ma-
chine–environment system and special attention and focus on the libraries in
universities.
In order to investigate the humanistic development of the university libraries in
the Internet era, this paper analyzes the man–machine–environment system of the
library from the angle of ergonomics, discusses the main connotations and contents
of man–machine interaction, and analyzes the corresponding man nature function
and features of the time so as to promote the construction of new man–machine
interactive interface and the enhancement of the humanized self-service function in
the library.

Man–Machine–Environment System of Library
The man–machine–environment system of library is composed of people and
machine in the library’s environment. Its composition is shown in Fig. 1, including
the various types of people involved in the use of the system, machinery, and
equipment and a variety of environments.

The “man” in the system mainly includes all kinds of users (teachers, student,
and researchers), librarians, and related service personnel, as well as temporary
visitors. Among them, teachers and students are the main objects of the university
library and librarians are the main staff. All of them coexist in the system.
“Machine” ﬁrst includes various and massive books and information, in paper,
electronic, multi-source media and other forms. There are also shelves and com-
puter interfaces for carrying information, tables and chairs for use, equipment
systems, and service facilities such as automatic borrowing equipment, information
inquiry systems, document scanning and printing systems, and elevators in drinking
systems, water dispenser, vending machines, etc. available for users.
“Environment” includes the internal and external environment of the library,
which is divided into light environment, thermal environment, sound environment,
air environment, network environment, and other environments, similar with the
environments of general classroom, ofﬁce, and other public places. The impact of
the environment on the man–machine system is signiﬁcant. For the library, as a
place to read, the light, color, sound environments and temperature requirements are
very high and the designer has to consider a lot of related factors [2]. Comfortable
environment can improve learning and work efﬁciency; on the contrary, the
uncomfortable environment may reduce the efﬁciency, increase the error rate, and
affect the health. Real-time network use is the requirement of humanization. In the
Internet conditions, the use of the library shows higher timeliness, which is also a
main characteristic of information access of library in this time of Internet.
Above man–machine–environment factors are intertwined with each other,
constituting a complex man–machine–environment system of library. Three factors
are interacted with each other; the machine and environment should meet various
physiological and psychological needs of people to allow people to easily access a
variety of resources, and then read and learn pleasantly.

Man–Machine Interface of Library
Man–machine interface refers to the area of communication and interaction
between people and machine. In the library system, there are a variety of different
types of man–machine interfaces. See Table 1.
The commonly seen human–machine interfaces in the library mainly include
people–desk/chair interface, people–bookshelf interface, and human–computer
interface.
Man-desk/chair interface in the library is similar to the relevantinterface in the
ofﬁce or classroom, which ensures that peoplehave stable and healthy sitting pos-
tures, comfortable visualconditions, and allow the body to have a rest and become
relaxed. No doubt such traditional interface is still the longest and the most
important interface between man and machine and the basic interface for all
activities in this time of Internet.

Man–machine interface of the computer system means that user borrows books,
enquires about information, and makes relevant searches via relevant network or
linkage of the library in a computer. On the one hand, the network design should
meet various humanized demand and be easy to learn and use to improve the
efﬁciency of search and query; on the other hand, relevant hardware conditions,
including the screen, mouse, and keyboard, etc., should be able to make readers
comfortable and convenient during the operation.
Man–machine interface for the information display includes various information
displays in the library, such as the new book notice, the event notice, the infor-
mation prompts, and various videos, which are usually arranged in the passages,
corridors, publicity boards, and other eye-catching places to allow users to see and
acquire information and feel pleasure.
Man–machine interface of service facility refers to that, when using the library,
by means of self-service service system, readers can borrow and return books or use
scanner or copying machines for relevant operations, which are important service
functions of the library. A good interface can make readers easily and efﬁciently
and help study and learning. The ubiquitous Internet makes it easier for reader to
access and store information.
Special man–machine interfaces refer to the special man–machine interfaces
provided for the old, weak, or disabled readers or the reader using different lan-
guage, such as the interface for the convenience of the visually impaired or the
blind reader, the interface for network inquiry, and the interface for the accessible
navigation instructions, sound prompt, etc.
Figure 2 shows the typical man–machine interface of the library based on the
man body model. Taking the new library of Tsinghua University as an example, the
two types of man–machine interface—reading and computer interaction—are
selected, including the sitting and standing postures of human body template so that
researcher can further analyze the comfort of corresponding function of human
body. In addition, taking book from the shelf, borrowing book by self-service
machine, copying book by self-service machine, using cell phone in free time, and
some other scenarios are typical man–machine interface and man–machine inter-
action scenarios. In the conditions of Internet, the virtual displays of the man–
machine interface and human–computer interaction scenarios are distributed all
over the library as major feature of modern society. In addition to the traditional
keyboard and mouse operations, direct touch screens are gradually increased,
allowing the use in a more intuitive, convenient, and nature way.

Humanized Function of Library
Based on the above various typical man–machine interfaces, the library provides
rich humanized functions for the readers. By means of the quick and convenient
wireless network conditions, the reader can enjoy a variety of user-friendly features
via Internet.
(1) Query and browsing function
Readers come to the library for ﬁnding the books and information needed, so the
query is the primary function. Through the network-based and user-friendly menu
function, readers can quickly ﬁnd the required materials and then read them to get
relevant information and knowledge. By the query, comparison, and screening, the
reader will ultimately ﬁnd appropriate bibliography. Therefore, the query and
reading are the library’s most basic humanized function.
(2) Borrowing and return function
In addition to sitting and reading in the library, borrowing and returning books
are also the most basic functions of the library. At present, the library provides users
with self-help and manual modes to borrow books. Outside the working hours,
readers may return books via the return box. Through network personal borrowing

system or mobile phone APP, WeChat and other functions, the reader can also keep
an eye on the information like new books and popular books.
The new virtual reality experience area provides readers with virtual touch
screen man–machine interfaces. On the interfaces, a variety of bibliographic cover
pictures rolls on the big screen and the readers can select with a ﬁnger and then use
the phone’s WeChat to scan the associated picture so that he can use the borrowing
function, which is more intuitive and convenient.
(3) Information acquisition function
In addition to borrowing and reading books, the library also provides readers
with a variety of information access functions, including retrieval and access
functions for a variety of network databases, databases, reference books, and
ancient books, and audio and other multi-source information so that the reader has
access or use these functions with the help of a librarian.
(4) Self-service function
Generally, reader needs to extract and record the materials found, so scanning,
printing, copying, reproducing, and some other functions are practical and usual
demands. Library should provide relevant equipment and system anywhere to allow
readers to enjoy self-service from time to time. Taking the advantage of Internet,
each equipment and system should have user-friendly man–machine interface and
quick operations to meet users’ demands in the saving and using data via Internet.
(5) Discussion and communication function
A variety of types and sizes of study rooms is a emerging new function these
years. Besides reading, readers also need to conduct brief communication and
discussion with their classmates, teachers, or peers. Library should have similar
closed places for such activities.
(6) Leisure function
After reading, readers need a place to have a rest or do some simple activities. In
the library, long sofas, rest corners, green plants, drinking water, and other
humanized rest areas are also required. The external environment of the library
should be skillfully combined with natural environment. Currently to cope with the
thick smog outside, any library should have a high-performance fresh air system to
provide readers with healthier atmospheric quality.
(7) Vulnerable group service function
To facilitate the use of the library by the elderly and the disabled, the library
should provide the corresponding humanized function, such as navigation and
reading and query functions and relevant assistances for amblyopia and blind
readers to allow more readers to beneﬁt.
Furthermore, it also includes personnel access management, escape routes,
security, and other humanized features.

Above humanized functions are the characteristics of new university library.
Inclusion of above aspects will make the new library’s MMES very humanized. As
shown in Fig. 3, based on the query and borrowing management of library mate-
rials of cloud big data, with a cell phone or a computer only, readers can conduct
relevant information processing, connect massive big data in the world, and realize
the interconnection and sharing in an internationalized way, that is, the peak of
man–machine engineering technology of library in this era of Internet.

Discussion
Nowadays, the new MMES of university library can meet the needs of teachers and
students, providing comfortable, convenient, pleasant reading, learning, and
working environment and a variety of self-service functions and reach a high
performance as a whole. Among all functions, networking, electronization, and
humanization are main features of such system.
In current network environment, the university library should pay attention to the
improvement of the man–machine interaction and the promotion of the humanized
self-service function. For instance, the man–machine interaction function of various
interfaces of networks and equipment system shall be further improved in a
humanized way; the self-service function shall also make all groups convenient,
reduce difﬁculty of the use, enhance efﬁciency, and minimize the error.
In the future, designers shall make further improvement in the service for special
groups and subject directions. For instance, the special devices and places may be
increased for special attentions and assistance for vulnerable groups; assistance in
different

internationalized communication and use; the system shall also follow the frontier
of some typical subjects, enrich contents, and introduce advanced book resources to
provide researchers with more practical and targeted quality service.
In addition, to cope with harsh weather conditions, such as thick smog, heavy
rain, and other extreme weathers, there should be some measures to ensure the
functions involving the fresh air, good lighting, and noise reduction and other
aspects to create a comfortable environment for learning.
Today, there are few studies on the MMES of library. The library as a special
building environment needs to be studied from the angle of ergonomics. This paper
makes primary discussions from the view of man–machine interface only. In the
future, we should make further study on the details of library’s MMES, such as
comfortable environment design evaluation for optimization of computer interfaces,
R&D of more advanced humanized interfaces, improvement of health of readers,
and enhancement of effective utilization of the library.

Conclusion
Based on the idea and method of ergonomics, this paper analyzes the constituent
factors of MMES of university library and its interrelations, investigates in the
typical man–machine interface and humanized function of library under the current
network conditions and discusses the optimization method of MMES. The results
show that under the Internet environment, the MMES of the university library
contains more man–machine interfaces and man–machine interaction factors of
virtual systems. The Internet-based application is the characteristic of the current
university library, and the university library under the network environment should
pay attention to the construction of man–machine interaction interface and the
enhancement of intelligent and humanized self-service functions. In addition, the
system should be improved when considering special groups, vulnerable groups,
adverse weather, and subject-oriented service. To sum up, the contents and details
of the library’s MMES need to be further discussed and developed.
