About the Author
Donald R. Prestly is a former Senior Editor for HANDY Magazine for The Handyman Club of
America as well as a former Associate Editor for The Family Handyman Magazine. In addition to
nearly 20 years of writing and doing home improvement projects, he spent several years as a
manager for one of the Midwest’s largest home centers. Throw in the everyday upkeep require-
ments of being a homeowner, dealing with the same problems and repairs as other
homeowners, and it’s clear that he has the background and expertise to help do-it-yourselfers
tackle home plumbing repairs. Plumbing Do-It-Yourself For Dummies is Don’s second For
Dummies book; he’s also the author of Kitchen Remodeling For Dummies, published in 2003.


Dedication
I dedicate this book to the thousands of homeowners who have heard cries of “Fix that leaky
faucet!” or “The toilet’s clogged!” It’s important for you to know that you’re not alone in your
plumbing problems and fixes. The plumbing department in almost every hardware store and
home center is one of the busiest departments in the store (if not the busiest). And it’s usually
filled with anxious and sometimes frantic homeowners who need the right stuff, right now, to
save the house and sometimes even their relationships! For all of you who want to tackle
plumbing or at least understand it better, this book is for you.


Author’s Acknowledgments
So where do I begin? Over 20 years ago, I left the world of home improvement sales and man-
agement and got started in the industry known as DIY. Little did I know or could have
envisioned that I’d end up writing my second home improvement book for the great team at
Wiley Publishing. All their books make information interesting, understandable, and, most
importantly, fun! A big thanks to Tom Reed at Kreber Photography for the great how-to photos
and a huge thank you to Senior Project Editor (and my day-to-day working editor) Tim Gallan.

Plumbing Do-It-Yourself For Dummies 

Introduction
P
lumbing Do-It-Yourself For Dummies shows you how to deal with most runs,
leaks, and drips of your home’s plumbing system and gives you confidence to
tackle some seemingly professional-level repairs. I provide information here on
kitchen fixtures (both the faucet and the sink) and bathroom fixtures (toilets, tubs,
and showers). I also show you how a residential plumbing system is designed as
well as how it operates and what’s needed to make it work right.
I hope you find this book not only packed full of information but also fun to use. My
years of working with customers every day in one of the country’s major home cen-
ters, along with my decade and a half of researching and writing about — and doing!
— home repairs gives me real-life insight into what you can expect to find when it
comes to fixing your home’s plumbing problems. And, believe me, you will eventu-
ally encounter problems.
About This Book
This book is intended to provide step-by-step instructions on repairing the most
common types of plumbing fixtures. I’d need much more space to cover every brand
or style of plumbing fixture in homes or being sold today. But the information I pro-
vide will equip you to make repairs or, at the very least, give you the knowledge to
explain the problem to a plumbing professional (also known as “the plumber”) and
understand what the plumber is doing if you need to hire a professional to make the
repair.
The information in the book is organized into five parts, and the chapters within
each part cover repairs to specific types of fixtures. You can read every chapter or
pick and choose the ones that are of interest to you. Either way, you come away with
the tips and techniques to keep your home’s plumbing system working right!
For many of the repairs, you’ll be dealing with nuisance issues— for example, a
kitchen faucet that drips or a toilet that occasionally “runs” for a short time. Some of
the repairs, however, require immediate attention to prevent damage to your home.
A perfect example is when there’s water leaking out from under your toilet bowl! Fix
it ASAP or you could be spending hundreds (maybe thousands?) of dollars to repair
structural damage due to rot.
And if you’re not sure what you need to do first, seek out the advice of the folks at
your local hardware store or home center. They can help guide you through a
plumbing repair that you’re not familiar with or comfortable tackling, often with 
success!

Plumbing Do-It-Yourself For Dummies 
Conventions Used in This Book
Most projects in this book intentionally have more photos than text. Seeing how a
repair is done is just as critical as reading how to do it.
All Web addresses appear in monofont.
Foolish Assumptions
Plumbing repairs can seem too hard for many do-it-yourselfers. In reality, you, the
homeowner, can handle many plumbing problems as long as you’re armed with the
proper information. In writing this book, I made the following assumptions about you:

You’re interested in understanding plumbing repairs, not only to gain the
confidence and know-how to take them on but also to save money by
making repairs yourself.

You probably aren’t familiar with plumbing repairs and may never have
attempted making any before. But you want to try!

You want to know more about how a repair should be done so that if you
have to hire someone to do it, you can be confident that you’re getting a
good deal on quality work.
How This Book Is Organized
This book is divided into five parts. Part I introduces you to the world of plumbing.
Parts II, III, and IV explain how to make repairs to the most common plumbing prob-
lems, whether in the kitchen or bathroom. Part V presents the usual top-ten lists
found in all For Dummies books.
Part I: Getting to Know Your 
Plumbing System
This part explains the various components that make up a residential plumbing
system and describes how the system works. It discusses the how’s and why’s of
getting a permit for some projects and where to turn for guidance when you feel
stuck. It also goes into detail with regard to plumbing tools.

Part II: Faucets and Sinks
This part shows how to repair the most commonly found types of kitchen and bath-
room faucets in homes. It also shows how to keep your sink leak-free and in best-use
condition, covering things from caulking the seam between the sink and countertop
to replacing a sink drain basket assembly and drain lines.
Part III: Tubs and Showers
This part shows how to keep your tub faucet and showerhead working their best. No
leaks, no drips, and the best water-flow possible. It walks you through the steps of
sealing joints between the plumbing fixtures and the walls, preventing costly repairs.
It also shows you how to deal with clogged or slow-running drains.
Part IV: Toilets
This part deals with the most important plumbing fixture in the house! It shows you
how to make a toilet run efficiently and eliminate the “phantom flush” (seeping
water) by replacing any or all old or defective parts in the tank. It also illustrates
how to deal with a leak under the bowl and prevent damage to the bathroom floor
and subfloor. Finally, this part shows you the best ways to deal with and remove or
clear the dreaded clogged toilet!
Part V: The Part of Tens
No For Dummies book would be complete without the Part of Tens. In this part, you
uncover ways to deal with noisy and frozen pipes, what to do before you call a
plumbing professional, and what you must do to keep yourself safe when making
plumbing repairs.
Icons Used in This Book
This book is loaded with the following helpful icons that point out key information:

Introduction

Make a note when you see this icon. It points out time-saving, money-saving, and
keep-you-from-pulling-out-your-hair advice.
Think of this icon as the flashing light and red flag alerting you to things that have
the potential to cause you and your plumbing helpers physical harm or make your
repair more difficult.
Where to Go from Here
I recommend that you start with Part I, especially if you’re completely or even fairly
unfamiliar with plumbing in general. If you feel comfortable and confident that you
can make some plumbing repairs, then feel free to find the repair for your specific
plumbing problem and have at it!
Remember, it really doesn’t matter where you start just as long as you address
plumbing issues in your home that need attention and fixing. I’m confident that after
you attempt (and successfully complete!) your first do-it-yourself plumbing project,
you’ll be ready to tackle virtually any others that come along in the years to come.

Plumbing Do-It-Yourself For Dummies 

Part I
Getting to Know Your
Plumbing System

In this part . . .
T
here’s plenty at work when you turn on a faucet or
flush a toilet in your house. And if you want to tackle
home plumbing problems, you need to know what you’re
dealing with. The chapters in this part cover a wide range
of plumbing basics, from knowing your limits to under-
standing residential plumbing systems, from recognizing
different kinds of pipes and fittings to being informed
about plumbing codes and requirements. To cap it all off, I
share recommendations on stocking your plumbing tool-
box so that you’re well-equipped to handle plumbing
problems around your house.

Chapter 1
Understanding Plumbing
In This Chapter
 Knowing what you’re getting yourself into
 Touring residential plumbing systems
T
o many people, a home’s plumbing system is perceived as being extremely
complex with lots of parts that only a professional plumber is qualified to
work on. In some cases, it’s true that you’re better off in terms of both time and
money calling in a professional; for example, only the most advanced do-it-your-
selfer should consider taking on replacing the main drainpipe for a home’s toilets.
But for many plumbing jobs around the average home, even a plumbing novice can
make the repairs the right way with good information to follow. And that’s what this
book is all about — providing the most up-to-date plumbing project information so
that even a beginner can tackle many of the most common residential plumbing
problems.
Establishing Your Plumbing Limits
If you consider yourself moderately handy (and be honest with yourself when you
assess your plumbing skills), then you should be able to tackle most of the projects
in this book. Remember, however, that plumbing repairs can be time-consuming and
therefore require one important trait — patience! I’ve tackled (and successfully com-
pleted, I might add!) more plumbing repairs than I care to count. But I’m the first to
admit that many of my projects took twice as long to complete as I had planned for.
Some of that extra time was the result of buyer-error, less-than-cooperative existing
plumbing, and not allowing for extra visits to the hardware store or home center. My
plumbing projects have taught me that even a well-planned project can run into
unexpected problems and delays. And when that happens, you should be ready and
willing to call out for an extra helping of patience.
Ensuring Successful Plumbing Adventures
Working in a logical step-by-step order makes repairs — plumbing and otherwise —
go more smoothly and keeps you safe. Trying to speed up a step or cut a corner only
leads to an inferior and potentially dangerous repair. For example, virtually every
plumbing repair project starts with turning off the water. I instruct you to do it
upfront in most of the projects in this book, and it seems like a fairly obvious first
step. But don’t be surprised if you get soaked or sprayed when you disconnect that
faucet or toilet valve because you forgot Step 1!

8
Part I: Getting to Know Your Plumbing System 
Making plumbing repairs isn’t and shouldn’t be frightening or utterly impossible.
Today’s plumbing product manufacturers have made installation instructions pretty
easy to understand, and many companies have toll-free numbers or online technical
support departments to turn to with questions. Plus, most home centers and hard-
ware stores have at least a few salespeople who really do know their stuff! But it’s
important to remember that if you feel uncomfortable attempting a specific repair,
don’t be ashamed to call in a plumber.
Before you start a plumbing project, assess and evaluate if the project is something
you can or even want to attempt. If you answer “no” or even “maybe,” consider
hiring a plumber from the start instead of starting the project yourself. You’ll save
money by only paying the plumber for the work and not for having to fix or undo the
work you attempted. Here are a few plumbing realities to keep in mind when consid-
ering a project:

Plumbing repairs require you to get your hands dirty. Some can get really
messy — that’s just the way it is.

Some plumbing repairs require some physical labor and may require
helpers. For example, lifting a toilet can be a job for two people, so don’t be
afraid to ask someone to help.

You may have to work in some pretty uncomfortable and cramped areas,
like under the kitchen sink or overhead when soldering copper supply lines.
The Residential Plumbing System
For the most part, the majority of your home’s plumbing system is hidden in walls,
floors, and ceilings. The parts you see — the fixtures and faucets — are only the end
of the line. The lines and pipes that get water to you and waste away from you are
the guts of the system. However, understanding a home plumbing system is really
quite simple.
Most residential plumbing systems have three components:

A water supply system that includes getting both hot and cold water to fix-
tures

The fixtures that deliver the water

A drain/waste/vent, or DWV, system
Figure 1-1 shows clearly how each of these components fit together to form the
plumbing system.

Part I: Getting to Know Your Plumbing System 
The supply side: Water comes in
The supply system, which is highlighted in Figure 1-2, begins where the water enters
the house through a main supply line or water main. The water source is either pro-
vided by a municipal water company or a private underground well located on the
property. If the source is a municipal supplier, the water runs through a water meter so
that water useage can be recorded and the homeowner billed accordingly. There’s no
meter on a private well.
Homes built before 1960 generally have galvanized pipe for the original supply lines,
whereas homes built after 1960 usually have rigid copper pipe supply lines. Some of
today’s new homes have plastic supply line pipes; this setup now is being accepted by
most local plumbing codes. I cover supply line pipes in more detail in Chapter 3.

Chapter 1: Understanding Plumbing
Within just feet of where the main line enters the home, a branch line splits off the
main and connects to your water heater. From the water heater, the hot water line
runs parallel to the cold water line to fixtures (including sinks, bathtubs, showers,
and laundry tubs) and appliances (including washing machines, dishwashers, and
water softeners). Toilets and exterior faucets (called sillcocks) are fixtures that
require only cold water. A refrigerator icemaker also only requires cold water, which
often is tapped off of a nearby cold water line.
The water pressure to the fixtures in your home is determined by the size of the
pipe’s inside diameter. The larger the pipe, the greater the pressure, so if your water
pressure is too weak, the problem may be undersized pipes. The pipe entering the
house usually has an inside diameter of 1 or 11⁄4 inches. Soon after the main line
enters the house, the pipe reduces to 3⁄4 inch. Pipes that carry water to rooms
throughout the house have an inside diameter of either 3⁄4 or 1⁄2 inch. Pipes that
supply water to each fixture are usually 1⁄2-inch inside diameter to the shutoff valve
and then 1⁄4-inch inside diameter to the fixture.
Drain, waste, and vent: Water goes out
Getting rid of used or waste water is achieved through your home’s DWV system,
which stands for drain, waste, and vent. The drains (D) are the pieces that hold and
then carry the waste water to the main drain lines (W). Without a constant air
supply, a vacuum would build up in the drain lines, eventually stopping the water
from flowing; To prevent this, each DWV system requires adequate and proper vent-
ing (V). The drain pipes use gravity to carry waste and waste water away from fix-
tures, drains, and appliances. The waste water is carried out of the house through
the main drain line to a municipal sewer system or a septic tank (if you have a pri-
vate well). Figure 1-3 shows the system in detail.
Never install or alter your home’s DWV system without consulting a building inspec-
tor. All three parts of this system must be installed according to precise specifica-
tions in order to work properly and safely.
Is your water safe?
Municipal water companies regularly test
the water they supply to homes to make
sure that it’s safe to drink. If you have a pri-
vate well, it’s your responsibility to test the
water for purity. Most areas require private
wells to be tested at least once a year. Check
with your city’s water officials for the testing
frequency requirements in your area. They
can also provide you with a list of compa-
nies that do qualified well water testing.
Even if your water is safe to drink, it could
still have tastes and odors that you find less
than desirable. Water filters, both whole-
house and point-of-use, can eliminate or
greatly reduce poor tasting or smelling
water. Check out your local home center or
hardware store for the type of filters or fil-
tering sytems that are recommended for
your area.

Chapter 1: Understanding Plumbing
The main stack
The primary component in a DWV system is the main stack (sometimes called the
main soil stack). The stack pipe is usually 3 or 4 inches in diameter and made of plas-
tic or cast iron. Located near the center of the house, the main stack goes down
below the basement floor or under the house slab (if there’s no basement) and emp-
ties into the sewer or septic tank. The main stack also has a vent pipe connected to
it that extends up through the roof. Without the vent, the waste water wouldn’t flow
quickly enough to clear the pipes, eventually leading to severe main line clogs. A
house may also have one or two secondary vent stacks located above and off the
bathroom drain lines.
Branch drain lines carry water from specific fixtures to the main stack. The branch
lines are smaller diameter than the main stack — usually 11⁄2 or 2 inches in diameter.
Drain lines must be sloped so that water runs freely to the main stack. The slope is
usually 1⁄4 inch per foot. For branch lines, local plumbing codes require special fittings
that have sweeping turns and not abrupt angles that could lead to clogged pipes.
Traps
Traps are a critical part of the DWV system. These curved pieces of pipe hold water
inside the curve that prevents sewer gas from backing up into the house. Each time
the drain in a fixture or appliance is used, the standing water is flushed down the
drain and replaced with new water.
Vents
Venting is required for the DWV system to operate properly. Without an air passage-
way behind the water flow, the system would run slow and gurgle. Each fixture is
required to be vented, but you don’t need a vent stack through the roof for each fix-
ture. If you did, your home’s roof would look like a smokestack-filled industrial fac-
tory! Individual fixture vent stacks often are connected to a revent pipe that
eventually connects to the main stack vent in the roof.
If one or more of your fixtures runs slow, or if a toilet gurgles when you flush it and
you know it’s not clogged, chances are good that the vent stack is blocked. This fix is
best left to a professional plumber to determine if it’s just a blocked vent or if the
plumbing itself is improperly installed and needs correction.
Septic systems: Don’t mess with them!
If your home is outside city or suburb limits, it probably isn’t connected to a munici-
pal water system, which means that you have your own well and septic system.
Your home’s water supply and DWV systems are usually the same as those in a
house that’s connected to a municipal water system and sewer (see the earlier sec-
tions “The supply side: Water comes in” and “Drain, waste, and vent: Water goes
out.”) The difference is that in a typical septic system, the waste water flows from
the house out through a main stack into the septic tank, as shown in Figure 1-4. The
tank usually is made of concrete or plastic.

14
Part I: Getting to Know Your Plumbing System 
A septic system has two tanks: the primary tank that collects most solids and the secondary
tank that collects the remaining solids. The solids or sludge sink to the bottom of the primary
tank while baffles inside the tank trap the scum (floating grease and soap) so that only liquid
(called effluent liquid) leaves the tank. The effluent liquid moves by gravity through a drain
pipe and empties into the septic system’s leach field, where the effluent liquid is broken down
by naturally occurring microbes. Then it either evaporates or is absorbed by the soil and
plants.
A septic system needs to be monitored and either cleaned or pumped on a regular basis,
although not every year because each time waste water flows into the tanks, an equal amount
of effluent liquid is pushed out the other end into the leach field. If the system is properly
sized for your house and properly installed, it probably only needs to be pumped every three
to four years. Use a wooden pole to check the sludge level in the tanks once a year. If the tank
is almost half filled, hire someone to pump the system. If the leach field starts to smell bad, or
if water backs up out of the drains, call a septic company immediately! The cause may just be
a clog that’s easily cleared if you catch it soon enough. Leave the work of repairing a septic
system to professionals.

In This Chapter
 Getting to know pipes and supply tubes
 Sorting out fittings of all shapes and sizes
W
ithout the two basic components of a plumbing system — water supply
pipes and fittings — water could never reach you in an efficient manner.
The pipes and fittings you use for the repairs shown in this book probably will be
copper, PVC, or ABS (see the next section for coverage of these pipe types).
However, you may encounter other types while working with an existing plumbing
system. For example, homes built before 1960 have galvanized steel pipe for water
supply lines and usually cast iron DWV pipe systems (for an explanation of DWV
systems, turn to Chapter 1).
Because this book is really intended for beginning do-it-yourself plumbers, I recom-
mend that you call in a professional plumber if your home is older and has galva-
nized steel or cast iron pipe.
Pipes
Here’s a quick look at types of pipes commonly used in homes, beginning with the
pipes used for DWV systems.

Cast iron: Most homes built before 1960 have cast iron pipes (see Figure
2-1) used for the vertical drain and vent stacks. Cast iron also may have
been used for the horizontal drain lines. Cast iron is very durable and lasts
for decades, but it can rust over time. It’s not uncommon for a section of
pipe, a fitting, or a coupling to rust through while the rest of the cast iron
system remains fine. A professional plumber can replace rusted sections
and connecting pieces with plastic (PVC or ABS) paired with the correct
transition fittings.

Plastic: Plastic pipe comes in two primary varieties: ABS (acrylonitrile-buta-
diene-styrene) and PVC (polyvinyl-chloride). In general, plastic has been the
pipe material of choice since the mid-1970s because it’s inexpensive and
easy to use. You simply glue the joints together using a primer and a liquid
cement made for the particular type of pipe you’re installing, whether ABS
or PVC.
• ABS: This black pipe (see Figure 2-1) was the first plastic pipe to be used in
residential plumbing systems. Now, some regions and cities don’t allow ABS
in new construction because some joints have been known to come loose.
Check with your local plumbing inspector if you want to use ABS pipe.

16
Part I: Getting to Know Your Plumbing System 
• PVC: This white or cream colored pipe (see Figure 2-1) is the most com-
monly used pipe for drain lines. It’s strong, virtually untouchable by
chemicals, and seems to last forever! The engineering rating and diame-
ter is stamped on the outside of the pipe; Schedule 40 PVC is the most
common and is accepted as strong enough for residential drain lines in
most locales. Check with your plumbing inspector to be certain.
Schedule 80 PVC is sometimes used for cold-water supply lines; however,
many inspectors disapprove of its use as a cold-water supply pipe, and
therefore it isn’t allowed in some regions. Schedule 80 isn’t suitable for
hot-water supply due to its shrinking and expanding properties. CPVC
(chlorinated polyvinyl-chloride) pipe (see Figure 2-2) has the strength of
PVC but is heat-resistant, which makes it acceptable in many regions for
use on interior supply lines.

PEX: The newest type of pipe for residential use is PEX (cross-linked poly-
ethylene). It’s approved in many regions of the country. PEX, shown in
Figure 2-2, is easy to install because it cuts easily, is flexible enough for
gentle bends around corners, and uses compression fittings to join sections
together. However, more permanent connections, like from PEX tubing to a
copper supply pipe, require a special crimping tool. Another drawback is
cost; PEX is three to four times more expensive than copper or plastic.

Steel: Many older homes have galvanized steel pipe supply lines and possi-
bly some branch drain lines. Galvanized pipe (see Figure 2-2) is very strong,
but it doesn’t last more than 50 years. So do the math on the age of your
home and your plumbing system to help you determine if your galvanized
pipe is worth repair or if you’re better off replacing it with copper and plas-
tic. If you do call in a professional to replace it, you should see an immediate
increase in water pressure and flow because the insides of galvanized pipes
become clogged with minerals over time, resulting in low water pressure.


Copper: Copper pipe is very long-lasting and resistant to corrosion, which
makes it the most commonly used pipe in water supply lines. It’s more
expensive than plastic but is still a good buy because it lasts and lasts!
Copper pipe for residential plumbing use comes in two basic types:
• Rigid copper comes in three thicknesses, each with its own letter rating.
Type M is the thinnest but is rated strong enough for most residential sit-
uations. Types L and K are thicker and used in outdoor and drain applica-
tions. All rigid copper, which you can see in Figure 2-2, is cut using a
wheel or tube cutter or a hacksaw. Lengths of copper pipe are usually
connected with soldered (sweat) fittings. Compression fittings can con-
nect the pipe to shut-off valves.
• Flexible copper is often used as a supply line for dishwashers, refrigera-
tor icemakers, and other appliances that need a water supply; you can
see it in Figure 2-2. It’s easily bent to form even a fairly tight turn, but if it
gets kinked, you must cut the piece off and replace it. Sections of flexible
copper pipe are joined using either soldered or compression fittings.

Supply Tubes
To connect a toilet or faucet to a shutoff valve that’s connected to a supply line, you
can choose from several different types of supply tubes, which are shown in Figure
2-3. They are as follows:

Plastic: The least expensive option, plastic supply tubes are relatively easy
to use. They’re easy to cut to length. The downside to plastic is that water
flow may be restricted due to the thickness.

Copper: You usually find copper supply tubes with chrome exteriors for
appearance. They need to be cut to length to fit and can’t be bent into posi-
tion because the copper is rigid and will kink or split if bent.

Braided steel: A braided stainless steel supply tube is a great choice if the
tube isn’t in plain view. These supply tubes are flexible and even can be
looped when in place. The braided steel prevents the inner rubber tube
from rupturing over time, a major cause of interior flooding and water
damage from dishwashers or clothes washers. Braided steel supply tubes
are code-accepted virtually everywhere. They come in various lengths and
fitting combinations for faucets, toilets, dishwashers, icemakers, and
clothes washers.

Supply Fittings
No matter what material you choose for your plumbing supply, most fittings fall into
one of four categories:

Couplers or unions: Join pipes in straight lines

Elbows: Turn corners

Tees and Ys: Allow pipes to branch out into new lines

Caps or ends: Seal the ends of pipes during rough-in and final installation
Always buy more fittings than you need; it’s my experience that most folks underes-
timate the correct quantity. Fittings are inexpensive, and buying extra means that
you save yourself an extra trip to the store, not to mention a reduction in frustration
when you’re one elbow short of finishing your project!
Figure 2-4 shows the various types of copper fittings you’re likely to use, plus some
brass fittings needed to connect copper to fixtures. Keep in mind that copper fittings
come in the same sizes (diameters) as rigid copper pipe. Common brass and copper
fittings include the following:

Brass drop-ear elbow: You use this fitting in showers to connect the copper
supply for the showerhead and/or tub spout. The drop-ear elbow has two
wings that you screw tightly to the wall. Drop-ears come in both sweated
and threaded styles.

Copper supply elbows: Also called ells, these fitting come in 90- and 45-
degree angles. A standard elbow has two female openings that are the same
size. A street elbow, which is useful in tight spots, has one female and one
male opening. A reducer elbow or coupling makes the transition between dif-
ferent diameter pipes possible. You also can get reducer elbows that let you
change pipe size right after going around a corner.

Copper tees: A straight tee has three openings, all with the same diameter. A
reducer tee has three openings, but one is smaller than the other two; the
usual configuration is for the two opposite openings to be the same size
with the smaller opening perpendicular to the other two.

Copper couplings or unions: Copper couplings have a center indentation
that stops the inserted pipes so that both sides of the connection have the
same length of pipe inside the coupling to ensure a solid connection. A
reducer coupler allows you to join a larger diameter pipe to a smaller one.

20
Part I: Getting to Know Your Plumbing System 
Figure 2-4: All kinds of copper and brass fittings.
Drain and Vent Fittings
Plumbing inspectors are sticklers for the correct DWV fittings, so be sure to use the
right one for a specific application. Some look almost identical on the outside but
are engineered for different applications and aren’t interchangeable.
The following list explains each type of fitting to help you get the correct one for
your project. Fittings come in various diameters to match the pipe size you’re using.
As you can see in Figure 2-5, these fittings have hub ends to accept straight lengths
of pipe. In order to use these joints, you have to clean them with the proper cleaner
and join them with liquid cement adhesive.

Waste or sanitary cross and double-Y: Both have two branch openings. A
reducer connects different size pipes to the waste or double-Y fitting.

Drain elbow: Also called a sweep or quarter bend, the drain elbow comes in
short, medium, or long radii. Whenever possible, use the long radius bend
for better clearing of water and waste. When working in tight quarters,
choose from several different size bends: a 60-degree, a 45-degree (or eighth
bend), or a 221⁄2-degree (or sixteenth bend).

Closet bend: This fitting is engineered to accept a toilet flange, which you
install after the finished floor surface.

Trap adapter: Use this fitting on pipe coming out of the wall for a sink drain.
You glue the adapter to the drain line in the wall, but its threaded end lets
you screw the trap directly to it.


Tees and single-Ys: These fittings come in all sizes to fit all drain pipes. The
two opposite openings, called run openings, are in a straight line. The other
opening is the branch opening. When describing a tee, the run sizes are
given first and the branch size is last. For example, a 21⁄2-x-21⁄2-x-2 tee has two
21⁄2 run openings and one 2-inch branch opening.
When buying tees, get waste or sanitary tees, which have a curved, sweep-
ing interior bend instead of an abrupt, hard bend. A sweeping bend has a
smoother interior flow design.

Cleanouts: Plumbing codes require drain lines to have cleanouts at regular
intervals. You either can use a Y with a cleanout or install a cleanout plug to
the end of a pipe. Cleanouts are threaded openings.

Transition fittings: These fittings are used to connect two different types of
pipe or pipes of different diameters. To transition from galvanized steel to
plastic drain pipe, use a male-to-threaded PVC coupling. You connect the
threaded end to the galvanized pipe and then glue the male end into the
PVC pipe. To transition from cast iron to plastic, use a neoprene sleeve fit-
ting. You tighten this reinforced stainless steel sheath around each pipe
with screw clamps to form a permanent joint.

Chapter 3
Getting the 411 on Codes 
and Requirements
In This Chapter
 Understanding typical code requirements
 Getting an inspection for the projects that require it
U
nlike the National Electrical Code (NEC), which applies to electrical work
throughout the United States, there’s no national plumbing code. Codes
vary from state to state and even from city to city, but most are based on the
National Uniform Plumbing Code, commonly referred to as the “national code.”
Your local code may be much more stringent than the National Uniform Plumbing
Code, so check with your local plumbing inspector before, during, and after your
project is completed. Your local plumbing code always supercedes the national
code.
Most of the repairs I show in this book don’t require pre-project inspection or
approval; examples include replacing a leaky faucet or installing a new toilet. As the
homeowner, you’re allowed to make these repairs without an inspection or getting a
permit. (Permits are covered later in this chapter.) But a good rule to follow is this:
When in doubt, talk to your local plumbing inspector. Inspectors are there to help
you through these projects by answering questions and giving advice, but you
shouldn’t use them as personal plumbing resources or expect them to walk you
through every step of a project. Inspectors are very busy out in the field performing
inspections and reviewing submitted plans for major remodeling projects and new
construction.
For more routine or common plumbing questions, find yourself a good salesperson
at your local home center or hardware store. Most have at least one knowledgeable
person in the plumbing department whom you can go to for expert advice.
Common Code Requirements
Here are some commonly required code issues that are applicable virtually nation-
wide:

Venting: Plumbing fixtures need venting to work properly. You need to
determine whether you need to install a new vent stack or can simply
revent the current one.

24
Part I: Getting to Know Your Plumbing System 

Fixture placement: Fixtures can’t be placed too close together. This require-
ment is more critical in the bathroom, where space is already limited. Here
are the minimum space requirements for toilets and tubs: 15 inches
between the center of the toilet and the side wall or sink; 1 inch between
the toilet tank and the wall; 18 inches between the bathtub and other fix-
tures.

Pipe sizes: The correct size pipes must be used for drains, supplies, and
vents. Check your local code for the minimum requirement in your area.
Also, find out what type of pipes are accepted in your area for drain lines
and water supplies.

Plastic pipe connections: PVC is so widely accepted that you’re likely to
use it for repairing or reworking your existing system. PVC pipe joints must
be primed and glued to last. And if you don’t prime, the joint will eventually
leak! (For more on PVC pipe, flip to Chapter 2.)
Getting Permission — and the 
Inspector’s Blessing!
As I say earlier in this chapter, most of the repairs I show in this book don’t require
pre-project inspection or approval, and they don’t require a permit. In most areas,
homeowners are allowed to make “fix-it” repairs to their homes without getting a
permit (or as people in the know like to call it, “pulling a permit”).
As I state earlier in this chapter, plumbing inspectors are busy people, out in the
field inspecting and (hopefully) approving plumbing projects. And if the inspector is
inspecting, that means that a plumbing permit was taken out or “pulled” at the local
city hall.
The reason for permits is to maintain the safety and uniform quality within your
area. If you’re not sure whether your project requires a permit, give the city offices a
preliminary call or visit. Someone there should be able to tell you what information
you need to supply before you start, what inspections are required, and the cost of the
permit. The permit fee is usually a percentage based on the total cost of the project.

In This Chapter
 Collecting the right tools for the job
 Protecting yourself with safety equipment
H
ere’s where you can dream and dream and dream about all the “stuff” you
think you need to own to be a real do-it-yourself plumber! Fortunately for
your bank account, there are some tools (actually, several!) that you really don’t
need to own for these projects. This chapter covers tools in a way that should help
guide you through the sea of options and keep some peace in the family when you
ask for permission to buy another tool.
After I discuss the common plumbing tools that are available, I include a very impor-
tant section on must-have safety equipment for every do-it-yourself plumber.
Tools, Tools, and More Tools
For a small investment, you can assemble a plumbing toolbox that arms you to
tackle almost any of the projects in this book. Here are the tools you should own no
matter what type of materials your plumbing system consists of.
The following tools are shown in Figure 4-1:

Levels: A 2-foot level works for checking drain pipe slope on longer sections
of pipe. A torpedo level is best for short sections of pipe. See Figure 4-1A.

Screwdrivers: You should have both a medium slotted and a #2 Phillips screw-
driver because plumbing fixtures use both slotted and Phillips screws. A 4-in-1
screwdriver combines both screwdrivers in one tool. See Figure 4-1B-C.

Tape measure: In order to handle measuring jobs without a helper, get a
tape measure that’s at least 20 feet long and has a 3⁄4-inch-wide blade.
(Narrower blade tapes bend when extended beyond about 8 feet.) See
Figure 4-1D.

Files: You should have both a flat file for general-purpose smoothing and a
round (or rattail) file for removing burrs from the inside of metal or plastic
pipes. See Figure 4-1E-F.

Plastic blade putty knife: A plastic blade putty knife is recommended to
scrape off dried plumber’s putty and other hardened debris. The plastic
blade is less likely to damage a porcelain surface than a metal blade putty
knife. See Figure 4-1G.

26
Part I: Getting to Know Your Plumbing System 
Figure 4-1: Plumbing tools: Group 1.

Adjustable wrench: An adjustable wrench is designed to adjust to any size
nuts and bolts. Get two sizes: an 8-inch and a 6-inch. See Figure 4-1H-I.

Needle-nose pliers: This tool is great for gripping small items even in hard-
to-reach areas. See Figure 4-1J. 

Groove-joint pliers: This tool has several jaw width sizes to accommodate
everything from small nuts and bolts to sink basker rings. See Figure 4-1K.

Hammer: It’s a must-have tool in every toolbox. Period! See Figure 4-1L.

Pipe wrench: Use this wrench on all types of threaded pipe connections
and fittings. A 14-inch pipe wrench is the best size for most projects. Buy
two wrenches if you plan to work on steel pipe because you use both at the
same time when tightening some galvanized or threaded copper fittings. See
Figure 4-1M.
These tools are shown in Figure 4-2:

Hacksaw: This saw, which has replaceable blades, is used for cutting metal
and plastic pipe. See Figure 4-2A.

Socket wrench: This wrench takes different-sized sockets to handle a vari-
ety of nuts and bolts. See Figure 4-2B.

Caulk gun: This tool is useful not only for plumbing projects but anytime
you need to caulk a seam or joint. The gun pushes a steady, uniform bead of
caulk out of the tube as you squeeze the handle. See Figure 4-2C.

Flashight: Great for illuminating under-sink areas and other dark places. See
Figure 4-2D.


Utility knife: This knife is great for cutting a variety of materials. The safest
type of utility knife has a retractable blade. The blades are replaceable and
can be purchased in multiple-blade packs. See Figure 4-2E.

Wire brush: A small wire brush is great for cleaning heavily encrusted
plumbing parts and pipe threads. An old toothbrush works well on less
crusty stuff. See Figure 4-2F.

Cold chisel. See Figure 4-2G.

Circuit tester: You use this tool to see if you’re getting power to an outlet.
See Figure 4-2H.
These tools are shown in Figure 4-3:

Tubing cutters: To cut copper or plastic pipe, you tighten the screw handle
as you rotate the cutter body around the pipe. For most pipe cutting, a stan-
dard tubing cutter works fine. A small or mini-tube cutter is useful when
working in tight spots. See Figure 4-3A-C.

4-in-1 wire brush: This brush is a handy tool for preparing copper pipe and
fittings for soldering. It has two wire brush ends (one 1⁄2 inch in diameter and
the other 3⁄4 inch in diameter) and two cleaning holes in the tool body (one for
1⁄2-inch copper and one for 3⁄4-inch copper). See Figure 4-3D. If you don’t have
this 4-in-1 brush, you need to get a reamer brush and a roll of emery cloth. 

Flux: You apply a paste called flux to the cleaned end of copper pipe before
connecting a fitting and soldering. The flux paste ensures a clean surface for
the soldered joint. See Figure 4-3E.

Emery cloth: Use this cloth to clean copper pipe before soldering. See
Figure 4-3F.


Handle-puller: Great for removing stuck fixtures. See Figure 4-3I.

Tubing benders: These spring-like tools fit around the appropriate sized
flexible copper tubing to gently bend the tubing. Tubing benders usually are
sold in three- or four-piece sets. See Figure 4-3J.

Fiber or safety shield: When soldering in areas of flammable materials (like
wood framing or wallboard), you must have one of these shields to place
between the flammable material and the propane tank flame. See Figure
4-3K.

Propane torch: This is a generic term for the gas tank setup used for solder-
ing. In Figure 4-3, the torch labeled L requires a spark igniter, and the torch
labeled M has an electric igniter. I recommend using MAPP gas instead of
propane for soldering because MAPP gas burns hotter than propane, which
makes soldering joints with lead-free solder easier. Lead-free solder is
required on pipes carrying potable water or water for cooking. 
These tools are shown in Figure 4-4:

Toilet auger: This auger is specifically designed for clearing toilet clogs
when a plunger doesn’t do the trick. It fits into the toilet bowl’s drain chan-
nel and comes with a plastic or rubber sleeve to protect the bowl’s porce-
lain finish. See Figure 4-4A.

Lock-nut or spud wrench: This type of wrench is specially designed for
removing or tightening large nuts that are 2 to 4 inches in diameter, like a
sink basket nut. The wrench’s hooks grab the lugs of the nut. See Figure 4-4B.

See Figure 4-4C.

Hand-crank auger: Often called a “snake,” this tool is a must for every
homeowner. It lets you get into drain lines and traps to clear clogs and
blockages. See Figure 4-4D.

Flanged plunger: This plunger helps you clear clogs in toilets, sinks, and
tubs. The funnel-shaped flange fits snugly into the toilet opening to create a
good seal for forcing clogs through. To use this plunger on a clogged sink or
tub drain, simply fold the flange into the body of the plunger to create a uni-
form seal over the drain. See Figure 4-4E.

Where there’s drilling, pounding, or heat, there’s the need for safety equipment. And
just having it around or in your toolbox doesn’t cut it. Safety equipment is there to
protect you and your project so don’t just have it available — USE IT! Here’s a look at
what you should have to stay safe in just about every plumbing job (see Figure 4-5).

Ear protection: A good set of earmuff-style hearing protectors will preserve
your hearing when using noisy power tools. You should also wear hearing
protection when you’re just hammering; repeated, loud hammer blows
eventually can damage your hearing. See Figure 4-5A.

Part I: Getting to Know Your Plumbing System 

GFCI-protected extension cord: A GFCI (ground fault circuit interrupter)-
protected extension cord is the best way to protect yourself from shocks
(or worse) when using corded power tools. The GFCI shuts off the power to the
tool the second (actually the millisecond) it senses moisture. Plug all corded
tools into a GFCI-protected extension cord and not directly into an outlet unless
you know that the outlet is GFCI-protected as well. See Figure 4-5B.

Safety goggles: If your project involves sparks or the chance of flying
debris, wear safety goggles. They’re also invaluable when clearing drain
lines where caustic chemicals may have been used. Styles vary, so choose
one that’s comfortable but still offers good protection. Even the best safety
eyewear is useless if it’s so uncomfortable that you don’t want to wear it!
See Figure 4-5C.

Gloves: Both leather gloves and heavy-duty rubber gloves are musts.
Leather gloves protect you when drilling, cutting, and soldering, whereas
rubber gloves protect your skin when you’re clearing clogged drain lines
that may contain caustic chemicals. See Figure 4-5D-E.

Fire extinguisher: Keep a fire extinguisher nearby and know how to use it if
you’re soldering copper pipe. A fire extinguisher and fiber or safety shield are
the best pieces of protective gear to have when soldering. See Figure 4-5F.

Part II
Faucets and 
Sinks

In this part . . .
T
his part focuses on two things you surely use every-
day: faucets and sinks. And a problem with one or the
other (or both!) can really throw a wrench in your day
(pun intended). Different types of faucets and sinks
abound, but this part focuses on the most common fix-
tures that you’re likely to be dealing with. Specific tasks
covered in this part include cleaning faucets and traps to
keep water flowing freely, repairing leaky faucets, caulking
around sinks, replacing or just adjusting drains, and
unclogging drains.
Here are all of the projects in Part II:

Hard water is loaded with minerals that build up over time and eventu-
ally clog aerators and sink sprayers. So if the water flow from your
faucet seems slower than normal, cleaning the aerator and sink sprayer
may bring things back to normal. The aerator screws onto the end of
the faucet spout and typically has two screens inside that the water
flows through. The fix is easy: Simpy unscrew the aerator, disassemble
it, clean it, and reinstall. For this type of repair, you usually don’t need
any new parts. The following steps apply to both faucets and sprayers.
Before you start, place an old towel on the counter next to the sink.
This is the best way to keep track of all the parts when you disassemble
the aerator. 
1.
Wrap some masking tape around the jaws of the
groove-joint pliers or around the aerator to pre-
vent scratching the surface of the aerator. Grip
the outside of the aerator with the pliers, and
turn the pliers clockwise to loosen the aerator.
You don’t need to apply much pressure to the
aerator; in fact, too much pressure can crush
the aerator housing.
2.
Disassemble the aerator by pushing the internal
parts out of the aerator housing. A small paper
clip might help. If the components are stuck,
soak the aerator in white vinegar or lime-dis-
solver solution (one part vinegar/lime dissolver
to one part water) for about 30 minutes or until
the deposits are loosened.

34
Part II: Faucets and Sinks 
Cover the sink drain to prevent any small parts from accidentally falling into the drain trap.Also, lay the parts
out in the order that you remove them so that you have an easier time putting things back together.
3.
Clean the parts using an old toothbrush and a
gentle touch. Be careful not to bend the
screens or you’ll have to replace them.
4.
Reassemble the aerator parts by inserting the screen, disk, washer,
or O-ring (depending on your aerator’s design) in reverse order of
disassembly.
5.
Reinstall the aerator on the faucet by screwing it in by hand in a
counterclockwise direction. Use the pliers to tighten securely but
there’s no need to overtighten. Snug is good!

A rotary ball faucet has a smooth plastic or metal ball that rotates
inside the socket of the faucet body. Water is dispensed when the
handle is moved and the grooves and holes on the ball line up with the
seats and springs. If water leaks out below the faucet handle or drips
out of the spout, first try tightening the cap or cap-adjusting ring. If that
doesn’t correct the problem, you need to buy a repair kit and replace
the faucet’s internal parts, including the O-rings, seats, and springs and
possibly the faucet ball. The following figure shows a typical repair kit
for this kind of faucet.
1.
Shut off the water under the sink, and turn
on the faucet until water stops running.
2.
Use a hex wrench to loosen the setscrew in
the faucet handle.
3.
Lift off the handle and unscrew the cap
located under the handle.

36
Part II: Faucets and Sinks 
4.
Remove the plastic cam and cam washer
(which usually are one piece) from the
faucet body.
5.
Lift out the ball. Inspect each part for damage
and replace them with parts from the kit as
needed.
6.
Insert the tip of a screwdriver into the
rubber seat in the faucet body, and pull it
out. It may take a couple of tries for each
seat, so be patient.

37
Repairing a Leaky Rotary Ball Faucet
8.
Remove the spout assembly from the faucet
to access the O-rings. It can be simply lifted
off. Pry off the old O-rings, or cut them off
with a utility knife if necessary.
9.
Coat the faucet body lightly with silicone
grease, and install new O-rings.
7.
Insert the tip of the screwdriver into each
spring in the faucet body to remove them.
You may need to twist the springs back and
forth slightly to break them loose.

10. Install the new springs and seats (in that
order) into the holes in the faucet body by
pressing them in place with your fingers.
11. Insert the ball in the faucet body so that it
sits snugly. The small tab on the ball should
fit into the notch in the body; otherwise the
faucet won’t work.
38
Part II: Faucets and Sinks 
If your faucet has a plastic ball, replace it with a metal one. Plastic types can wear out in less than a year, which
means that you’ll be doing this repair again before you know it.
13. Reinstall the handle and tighten the setscrew
with a hex wrench.
12. Screw on the cam and cap.

Cartridge faucets control the flow of water by channeling water through
grooves or holes or by way of a tapered cartridge design. Several of the
major faucet manufacturers make cartridge faucets and therefore
replacement parts, so it’s a good idea to take your old parts with you to
the store to be sure you get the right brand of replacement parts.
1.
Shut off the water under the sink, and turn
on the faucet until the water stops running.
2.
Remove the retaining screw using a hex
wrench or screwdriver depending on the
screw. Lift off the handle.
3.
Use a screwdriver to remove the retaining
nut under the handle.

40
Part II: Faucets and Sinks 
4.
Pull out the retaining clip located just
beneath the retaining nut.
5.
Unscrew the plastic retaining caps.
6.
Unscrew the ring that holds the spout
housing the faucet body.
7.
Lift the faucet spout straight up off the hous-
ing body and set it aside. If needed, clean the
faucet body to remove debris. An old tooth-
brush should do the trick.

41
Repairing a Leaky Cartridge Filter Faucet
8.
Use needle-nose pliers to remove the clip at
the top of the cartridge.
9.
With the tip of a screwdriver, slip the old O-
ring from its groove and remove it from the
housing. Avoid cutting the ring off the hous-
ing so that you can take the old, intact O-ring
to the store to get an exact replacement.
10. Grip the old cartridge with groove-joint
pliers, and pull it straight up to remove it
from the faucet body without breaking or
damaging either piece. If you can’t remove
the cartridge using the pliers, you need to
buy a tool called a stem puller. You must use
the stem puller made for your brand of
faucet.
11. Clean the faucet body to remove debris.
12. With your fingertip, apply a light coating of
silicone grease to the new O-ring, and install
it in the groove on the faucet body.

42
Part II: Faucets and Sinks 
13. Insert a new cartridge or replace the old one
if it’s in good shape. Reinstall the clip on the
cartridge, slide the faucet spout on the hous-
ing body, and screw on the retaining ring.
14. Reinstall the plastic nut.
15. Reinstall the plastic cap.

43
Repairing a Leaky Cartridge Filter Faucet
17. Turn the water on under the sink, and check the hot and cold
water from the faucet to be sure that they aren’t reversed. If
they’re reversed, meaning that turning the faucet to the hot
side produces cold water and vice versa, disassemble the
faucet, rotate the cartridge 180 degrees, and then reassemble
the faucet.
16. Reinstall the retaining nut and clip along
with the faucet handle.

Ceramic disk faucets are durable and reliable, but they’re subject to
sediment buildup that restricts water flow. For that reason, if you live in
an area with hard water and find yourself making repairs a couple times
each year or more, you may want to consider a different type of faucet.
You may be able to fix a ceramic disk faucet by cleaning or replacing the
neoprene seals, but most often it’s best to simply replace the entire car-
tridge. This project shows you how to clean the cartridge and replace
the seals.
1.
Shut off the water under the sink, and turn
on the faucet until the water stops running.
2.
Use a hex wrench to loosen the setscrew.
Remove the handle.
3.
Lift off the decorative cap to access the cartridge.

Time Needed:
Less than an hour
Compression or stem faucets have been around for over 100 years and
are still in use in a lot of older bathrooms. Their operation is relatively
simple: A stem moves up and down when the handle is turned, and a
rubber washer at the bottom of the stem pushes against a seat in the
faucet body to stop or start water flow. If the washer or seat becomes
worn, water drips from the faucet spout. 
All purpose or universal washer kits contain various sizes of washers
and O-rings. To make sure you get an exact match, take the old faucet
stem with you to buy the repair kit. Older faucets may need a packing
washer or packing string that usually isn’t included in a washer kit but
can be found at most hardware stores.
If the stem itself is worn, it should be replaced, but as this type of
faucet gets older, parts get harder to find in stores. Replacing the
faucet may be your best or only option.
1.
Shut off the water under the sink, and open
both faucet handles until the water stops
running.
2.
Use a screwdriver to pry off the decorative
cap from the handle (if there is one), remove
the screw underneath, and then gently pry
off the handle.

If the handle is stuck, gently tap it with the
handle of a screwdriver and try to pry it off
again. If it still doesn’t budge, use a handle
puller to avoid cracking or breaking the
handle. (Handle pullers are sold at hardware
stores and home centers.)
4.
Grab the stem with the pliers, and pull it
straight up and out of the faucet housing.
5.
If water drips from the spout even when it’s
off, replace the washer. Remove the screw
and install a new washer that’s exactly the
same size as the old one.
3.
Remove the retaining nut using groove-joint
pliers.

50

7.
Reinstall the handle components.
Never reuse an old washer, even if it looks good. New is the best (and only) way to be sure that you won’t be
doing the same repair again very soon.
6.
If the washer seat, which is located inside
the faucet handle body where you pulled the
stem from, is worn, replace it. Use a seat
wrench to unscrew it — don’t try to pry it
out or you’ll damage the faucet body.

With a two-handle style faucet, leaks often occur around the base of the
faucet spout and from under the spout collar or cap. If you let this type
of leak go unattended, it can cause significant damage, much of which
you don’t see outright; leaking water can get under the faucet’s base
plate and then drop into the cabinet or into the countertop where it can
cause real damage.
If you have one, a strap wrench is a great
tool for removing the spout cap because it
provides excellent grip and torque without
damaging the finish on the cap.
1.
Cover the jaws of groove-joint pliers with
masking tape, and use them to remove the
spout cap. (You also can cover the spout cap
with tape to protect it.)

Caulking around a Sink Bowl
Stuff You 
Need to Know
Sealing the joint between a sink and countertop (whether in a kitchen
or bathroom) is one task that almost anyone can do. Even better, it’s
fast, easy, and very inexpensive. Left unsealed, the joint between the
sink and countertop allows water to seep under the sink and into the
countertop or cabinet, eventually leading to major damage and costly
repairs.
3.
Apply steady pressure to the trigger on the
caulk gun to apply a bead of caulk along the
joint between the sink and the countertop.
Take your time when working along the back
edge of the sink and around the faucet.
1.
Cut off the tip of the caulk tube at a slight
angle using a utility knife. Tube tips have cut-
ting marks on them which give you different
size beads of caulk. Cut off the tip at the first
or small dia. bead marking.
2.
Insert the tube of caulk into the caulk gun
according to the instructions on the caulk.

55

4.
Dampen your finger with water and run it
over the caulked bead to smooth it. Wipe
your finger on a damp rag periodically to
remove excess caulk, and dampen your
finger again before you continue smoothing
out the caulk bead.
Many people use clear caulk for this job. Don’t be surprised when your clear caulk comes out of the tube white.
It will dry clear as it cures.

Replacing a Leaky Sink Basket
Stuff You 
Need to Know
A leaky sink basket can allow water to run down the outside of the drain
assembly and drip onto the floor of the cabinet base, eventually causing
significant damage. The sink basket assembly connects the sink to the
drain line. If water leaks from the basket onto the outside of the drain
pipe, you need to replace the plumber’s putty seal between the basket
and the sink. Doing so requires taking apart the sink basket assembly
and the drain line tail piece that it’s connected to. In most cases, you
don’t have to replace the sink basket, just reseal it.
1.
Either by hand or using groove-joint pliers,
disconnect the slip nut from the underside
of the sink basket, and slide the nut down
the tail piece out of the way. Move the drain
line down away from the basket.

57
Replacing a Leaky Sink Basket
2.
Use a basket strainer wrench to loosen and
remove the locking nut on the bottom of the
basket. (You can try groove-joint pliers first,
but most don’t open wide enough to go
around this type of locking nut.)
3.
Scrape off any old plumber’s putty on the
upper side of the sink with a plastic putty
knife. Don’t use a metal putty knife or you’ll
damage the sink’s finish! If you plan to reuse
the old basket, scrape off any old putty
under the basket flange.
5.
Insert the basket into the opening in the
sink.
4.
Fashion a rope of plumber’s putty that’s
approximately 1⁄4 inch in diameter. Press it
on the underside of the basket flange.

58

6.
On the underside of the drain basket, install
a new rubber drain gasket and drain seal,
and secure them with the locking nut. Hand-
tighten the locking nut.
7.
Reconnect the drain line to the basket
assembly, and slide the drain slip nut back
up into place to secure them. Hand-tighten
the slip nut.
8.
Test the drain with running water. If you spot
leaks, tighten the nut slightly, but no more
than one-quarter turn.
Even the best do-it-yourselfers sometimes break plastic fittings, and it’s usually that final tightening turn of the
wrench that does it. Here’s a good rule of thumb: Hand-tighten all fittings and then tighten with pliers only a
quarter-turn at a time until the leak stops.

Stuff You 
Need to Know
Sink traps, especially ones in bathrooms, usually benefit from periodic
cleaning to get rid of buildup and clogs that are too difficult or impossi-
ble to remove with a plunger or plumber’s snake. The faster and easier
way to take care of this problem is to simply replace the trap. Take the
old trap with you to the store to get an exact match.
2.
Loosen the slip nuts with groove-joint pliers,
unscrew the nuts by hand, and slide them
away from the connections. Be sure to save
the two washers that are part of the slip nut
connection; you can reuse them with the
new trap.
1.
Place a bucket under the trap.

If you know or even suspect that chemical drain cleaner has been used to clear the trap, you must take extra
precaution when you loosen and remove the trap.Wear rubber gloves and safety glasses to protect your skin
and eyes in case of a water splash.

Stuff You 
Need to Know
All drains in the U.S. must have a P-trap or S-trap, depending on code
requirements. Both designs are engineered to prevent noxious gases
from backing up through the drain line into the house. The most com-
monly found is the P-trap. It’s design is quite simple: The bend portion
(the “P” section) holds standing water when the drain isn’t in use. Each
time water is flushed through the drain, the old water is replaced by
new water. So why would you need to replace the drain? In a double-
bowl kitchen sink drain, over time, food waste and solids can adhere to
the trap and eventually clog the trap. The connections also may
develop leaks over time due to being bumped, for example, by putting
away dishwashing soap and other items under the sink. Sometimes you
can simply replace the trap, but most often you’re better off replacing
the entire drain assembly.
1.
Use groove-joint pliers to loosen and remove
the old drain assembly.
2.
Attach the short tail piece (if needed) to the
threads on the bottom of the sink basket.
Secure it with the nylon washer first and then
the slip nut; slide both up to the basket
threads. Then slide on the slip nut and nylon
washer that will secure the longer tail piece
onto the short tail piece. (Note that this nut
and washer go on in the reverse order and ori-
entation of the first ones.)
3.
Connect the tail piece, whose length is deter-
mined by the position of the drain line
coming out of the wall. The tail piece should
come to the bottom edge of the wall drain
line. You can eyeball this length and cut the
tail piece later if it’s too long.

62
Part II: Faucets and Sinks 
4.
Attach the P-trap to the tail piece and
tighten.
5.
Position the trap arm on the P-trap, and
mark where to cut the arm so that it fits in
the wall drain line. Remove the arm and cut
it to length using a PVC tube cutter or 
hacksaw.
6.
Slide the slip nut and nylon washer onto the
cut end of the arm, and inset the arm into
the wall drain.
7.
Align the arm with the P-trap and tighten;
then tighten the arm to the wall drain line.
Use the old parts as a guide when installing the new parts. Some new pieces may need to be cut, so use the old
parts as cutting templates.

63

8.
Attach the short tail piece to the other sink
bowl basket with a slip nut and nylon
washer. Position the connecting drain line
and mark where to cut the drain line so it fits
in the opening of the first bowl’s tail piece.
Then, cut the piece to length using a PVC
tube cutter or hacksaw.
9.
Slide the slip nut and nylon washer onto the
cut end and insert the cut end into the tail
piece. Tighten the slip nut.
10. Secure the other end of the connecting drain
line to the short tail piece using a nylon
washer and slip nut.
11. Install an escutcheon plate to cover the gap
between the wall drain line and the wall.
This not only adds a finished look but also
seals drafts and keeps out insects. There are
two types of plates: A split-ring plate fits
around the pipe that’s already installed, and
a solid-ring plate slips over the pipe before
you connect the trap arm to the wall drain
line. (In this project, you’d put a solid-ring
plate on before Step 7.)

64
Part II: Faucets and Sinks 
Hand-tightening nylon washers and slip nuts on PVC pipe joints is usually sufficient to establish a secure, leak-
free connection. If there’s a slight leak, use a groove-joint pliers gently — an eighth- to quarter-turn is usually all
that’s needed to stop the leak.
Your sink may have a center outlet drain in which a tail piece and connecting arm from each sink basket connect
to a center horizontal tee connection, as shown in the following figure. In this setup, you connect the P-trap to
the tee in the same manner as you’d connect the P-trap to the tail piece in a single-bowl setup.Then you con-
nect the trap arm to the wall drain line.

Bathroom sink drain installation is similar to kitchen sink drain installa-
tion with the main difference that a bathroom sink drain uses a drain
flange instead of a sink basket to connect the tail piece and subsequent
drain line parts. The drain flange on a bathroom sink is still secured
from below like a kitchen sink basket, but the securing nut is smaller
and can be tightened with groove-joint pliers. A bathroom sink drain kit
is likely to have a pop-up stopper assembly that contains the drain
plunger used in the sink to stop water flow and a pull-up rod that goes
through the faucet and operates the drain plunger. If your existing
faucet and drain isn’t a pop-up style, you have to replace the entire
faucet if you want your new drain to be a pop-up drain.
2.
Craft a snake of plumber’s putty that’s about
the same size in diameter as the width of the
drain flange. (It’s better to have too much
putty than not enough; you can scrape away
any excess when everything is tightened.)
Press the putty snake around the underside
of the drain flange and set aside.

Replacing a Bathroom Sink Drain
Bathroom drain kits usually use metal-coated parts (chrome or brass are most common) for appearance when
the drain is visible, such as with a wall hung or pedestal sink. If the drain is concealed in a vanity cabinet, how-
ever, it’s perfectly fine to use a PVC bathroom drain kit.

Adjusting a Pop-Up Drain
Stuff You 
Need to Know
A pop-up drain has several moving parts that may need adjustments
after a while. If the parts seem extremely thin or get bent or damaged,
consider buying a new faucet and drain assembly instead of trying to
find replacement parts.
Typically, people run into these problems with pop-up drains: The
plunger doesn’t stay open or closed; water leaks from the pivot ball
connection; and either the plunger doesn’t lift or it doesn’t want to hold
water.
Pivot ball nut
If your plunger doesn’t stay open or closed:
Tighten the pivot ball nut with groove-joint
pliers until the plunger stays in either an
open or closed position.

71
Adjusting a Pop-Up Drain
If water leaks from the pivot ball connec-
tion: Unscrew the pivot ball retaining nut
with groove-joint pliers, and remove the rod,
ball, and gasket. Replace the gasket, and
reassemble the connection.
If the plunger doesn’t lift or hold water:
Disconnect the pivot ball connection and
adjust how it’s attached to the lift rod. In this
case, you can choose from multiple holes to
slide the rod into. You may need a tighter or
looser fit, so test the plunger and readjust as
needed.

Unclogging Sink Drains
Stuff You 
Need to Know
Everyone’s household plumber’s toolbox should contain an inexpensive
hand auger, which can clear most household clogs. It consists of a
wound metal cable (or snake) with a widened tip that grabs or pushes a
clog to clear it. The cable is housed in a plastic case with a handle that
allows you to crank the snake when it’s in the drain line.
You have the option of renting a power auger, but I recommend that you
do so only if you’re confident of your do-it-yourself skills. If you rent a
power auger, be sure to get complete operating instructions before you
leave the rental center.
1.
Place a bucket under the sink trap.
2.
Dismantle the trap by unscrewing the slip
nuts that hold the bend in place.
3.
Check to see if the clog is in the trap itself. If
so, force the clog out (using an old tooth-
brush if needed) and reassemble the trap.

73
Unclogging Sink Drains
Wear rubber gloves when working with a hand auger and clogged drain.You’ll feel better, especially when
you’re removing the icky gunk that’s clogging your drain.
4.
If the clog isn’t in the trap, loosen the auger
setscrew and pull out about 12 to 18 inches of
cable. Push the cable into the drain line until
you feel resistance. The resistance may only be
a bend in the drain line and not the obstruction,
so tighten the setscrew and crank the auger
clockwise until the cable moves forward.
5.
Loosen the setscrew, push the cable again until
it stops, tighten the setscrew, and crank the
auger again.
6.
The cable may grab the clog rather than push
the obstruction, so if you feel significant resist-
ance, pull the cable out and remove any hair
and other junk from the cable.
7.
Repeat Steps 5 and 6 until the clog either is
removed or is pushed through the drain line.

Soldering Copper Pipe
Stuff You 
Need to Know
Believe it or not, soldering copper pipe isn’t difficult. That said, it takes
practice and patience to make leak-free joints. Why do plumbers use
copper? Because it’s durable, clean, and can be connected to all other
types of pipe and supply lines simply by using the correct transition fit-
tings. Don’t get discouraged if your first attempts leak or look a little
sloppy. Be patient, take time to practice, and sooner than you think,
you’ll be soldering with the best of the pros!
2.
Use the wire
brush end of the
4-in-1 tool to
clean out the
inside of the
copper fitting.
Tiny pieces of
copper (called
burrs) and grease
residue from
manufacturing
inside the fitting
can lead to a
leaky joint.
3.
Use emery cloth to clean the outside of the
copper pipe. Clean the pipe to about the
width of the emery cloth. Use a reamer
brush to clean the inside of the pipe.
1.
Be sure all water is drained from the line;
water inside the pipe will keep it from getting
hot enough to make a leak-free joint.
When soldering, keep a fire extinguisher and a bucket of water nearby just in case anything goes wrong!
Chances are, you’ll do fine.

75
Soldering Copper Pipe
4.
Apply a thin coating of flux (also called sol-
dering paste) to the cleaned end of the pipe
using a flux brush. The paste should cover
about 1 inch of the pipe (the same as the
cleaned area from Step 3).
5.
Insert the pipe into the fitting and make sure
that the pipe is tight against the bottom of
the fitting. Twist the fitting back and forth
slightly to spread the flux.
6.
Unwind the coil of lead-free solder until you
have about 8 to 10 inches extending from the
spool. About 2 inches from the end, bend the
solder at a 90-degree angle.
7.
Light the propane torch with the spark
igniter. Hold the tip of the flame about 1 inch
away from the middle of the fitting for about
five seconds, or until the flux begins to
sizzle. Heat the opposite side of the fitting to
ensure even heating of the entire fitting.
8.
Touch the end of the solder wire to the joint cre-
ated by the pipe and fitting as you continue
heating the fitting with the torch. If the solder
melts, the pipe is hot enough and ready to
solder. If the solder doesn’t melt on contact,
continue heating the fitting for a few more sec-
onds and then touch the solder to the joint
again to check the heat.
Tip: Heat the fitting, not the solder! Heating the
fitting allows capillary action to do its thing.
Heating the solder will only melt (and waste!) it.

76
Part II: Faucets and Sinks 
10. Wipe away the excess solder using a rag.
The pipe will be hot, so be careful when
touching the rag to it!
11. After the pipe and fitting have cooled, turn on
the water and check for leaks. If the joint leaks,
take the joint apart and resolder it.
Use MAPP gas instead of propane. Fittings need to be hotter to draw in lead-free solder than they used to need
to be when leaded solder could be used. MAPP gas burns hotter than propane, thus heating the fittings more
quickly and keeping them hotter when the joints are ready to go. MAPP gas is more expensive than propane, but
for most home soldering jobs, the time you save using MAPP gas outweighs the extra cost.
Always use a fiber or safety shield (as shown in the following figure) when soldering near wood, especially in
floor joists.This flame-proof barrier is available wherever plumbing supplies are sold. It usually has metal grom-
mets so you can hang it from a nail and keep both hands free for soldering.
9.
Remove the flame from the fitting and quickly
insert about 1⁄2- to 3⁄4-inches of solder from the 
2-inch bent section. An adequately heated fitting
draws solder into the joint using capillary action.
A properly soldered joint has a thin bead of
solder around the entire fitting.

In this part . . .
T

which means problems with them need swift attention.
This part addresses common preventive measures as well
as repairs to the parts and pieces of tubs and showers.
First you find out how to caulk around these fixtures to
keep water where it’s supposed to be. Then the part
moves on to tasks such as replacing spouts and shower-
heads and repairing or replacing different kinds of shower
faucets. I wrap things up with instructions on adjusting

Time Needed:
Less than an hour
Stuff You 
Need to Know
Sealing the joints between a tub, tile, and fixtures is a critical step that
many folks overlook. And it’s so easy to do! It’s important to use caulk
engineered for use in high-moisture areas such as the bathroom. Tub-
and-tile caulk contains silicone, which makes it long-lasting, flexible,
and effective at sealing out moisture under direct water contact. Most
people use white caulk, but if you don’t want to be left with a bright
white line, opt for clear caulk. Just don’t be surprised when your clear
caulk comes out of the tube white — it turns clear as it dries and cures!
1.
Apply caulk to the joint between the edge of
the tub and the wall tile. Even though most
tubs have a lip along the edges that meet the
wall, it’s important to seal the joint to pre-
vent water from wicking up behind the tile to
the backerboard.

3.
If the bead of caulk isn’t smooth enough to
your liking, dip your finger in water and
gently run your fingertip along the caulk bead
to smooth it. Keep a paper towel handy to
wipe off any excess caulk from your fingertip
as you’re smoothing.
2.
Apply a bead of caulk around the joint
between the tub spout and tile. Rotate the
caulk tube in the gun so that you can apply
caulk to the underside of the spout joint.

Tub spouts come in two types: those that are screwed onto a threaded
supply pipe, and those that are secured to a nonthreaded supply pipe
with a setscrew.
Replacing a tub spout is usually an easy project. Just remember to be
gentle as you install the new spout.
1.
To remove the old tub spout, first look on
the underside of the existing spout to see if
there’s a setscrew. (It’s usually in a small
slot.) If you see a setscrew, use a hex wrench
to loosen it, and then pull to slide the old
spout off.

82
Part III: Tubs and Showers 
4.
Screw the new spout onto the threaded
supply pipe by hand until it’s snug.
3.
Clean the threads of the supply pipe using
an old toothbrush, and then wrap the
pipe threads with two or three turns of
pipe-thread (Teflon) tape. Wrap the tape
in a clockwise direction to keep it from
unwrapping when you attach the new
spout.
2.
Use groove-joint pliers to turn the old spout
counterclockwise to unscrew it from the
threaded supply pipe. (Don’t worry about
wrapping the old spout to prevent damage
before using the pliers — you’re throwing
the old spout away.)

83

5.
Wrap some masking tape around the teeth of
your groove-joint pliers and use the pliers to
tighten the spout firmly. (The tape protects
the pliers from scratching the spout’s finish.)
Warning: If the supply pipe is threaded
copper, avoid overtightening the spout or
you may strip the supply pipe threads.

or scratch your fixtures with the teeth of your pliers.
1.
To remove the old showerhead, wrap a rag
around the shower arm to protect it from
scratches. Hold the shower arm with pliers
and use an adjustable wrench (or pliers) to
loosen the showerhead (turning counter-
clockwise) from the shower arm.
2.
Clean the threads of the shower arm with an
old toothbrush and then wrap the pipe
threads with two or three turns of pipe-
thread (Teflon) tape. Wrap the tape in a
clockwise direction to keep it from unwrap-
ping when you attach the new showerhead.

Stuff You 
Need to Know
A tub and shower compression faucet works much like a sink-style com-
pression faucet. The difference is the orientation: The tub and shower
version is oriented horizontally (coming out of the shower wall)
whereas the sink version is oriented vertically (coming up through the
sink). In a tub and shower setup, a two-handle stem faucet has a stem
with a washer. The washer presses against the seat in the faucet’s valve
body to seal off the water flow. If you have a three-handle faucet, the
third (middle) handle is a diverter that directs water up to the shower-
head or down to the tub spout, depending on the position of the
diverter. The most common problem you’ll encounter is dripping water
from either the hot and cold water handles or the showerhead handle.
2.
With the water turned off, open both handles
until water stops flowing. Then use a hex
wrench to take off the shower handle. If the
handle is stuck, don’t force it by hand or you
may break the handle. Instead, use a handle
puller to get it off.
1.
Before anything else, remember to do the follow-
ing: 1) Shut off the water! 2) Close the tub drain,
and place a cloth in the tub to catch any dropped
parts. 3) Buy a washer package that contains the
exact replacements you need for your brand of
faucet.

Stuff You 
Need to Know
In a tub cartridge faucet, the tub faucet handle only turns the water on
and off, and a diverter on the tub spout directs the water to the shower-
head or spout. Some cartridge faucet repairs may only require one or
two parts, such as an O-ring, but you may find it’s just as easy to
replace the entire cartridge. Take the old cartridge with you when you
shop for a replacement. Many manufacturers have cartridges of varying
designs, so having the old one to reference is the best way to get the
cartridge you need and save yourself multiple trips to the store.
Knowing your brand of faucet is a good idea, too.
2.
Use a slotted screwdriver to pry the cap
off of the handle.
1.
Before anything else, remember to do the
following: 1) Shut off the water! 2) Close the
tub drain, and place a cloth in the tub to
catch any dropped parts. 3) Identify your
brand of faucet. Some cartridges require a
special cartridge-pulling wrench made for a
specific brand of faucet.

which are sold at most hardware stores and
home centers.
Tip: Check the orientation of the cartridge
before you remove it in Step 7 or 8. It must be
reinstalled in the same orientation in order to
work properly.
9.
If the cartridge looks to be in good shape,
replace the O-rings and any other replace-
able parts (which varies between brands).

Stuff You 
Need to Know
A tub disk faucet works exactly like a sink disk faucet, so repairs are
basically the same for both. Don’t be confused by the term “disk” and
look for a flat, round, disk-shaped part. The disk is actually inside the
cylinder; it holds the rubber seals that control water flow.
If water drips out of the spout or around the handle, buy a repair kit for
your faucet model and replace all the rubber parts. Inspect the disk for
any nicks or cracks, and replace it if you find some. If your faucet has a
plastic disk (this is usually the case with less expensive models),
replace the entire disk.
2.
Use a hex wrench to remove the faucet

If your tub won’t hold water when the drain is closed, or if the tub
drains slowly even after you clear the drain line, then the drain assem-
bly needs adjusting.
There are two types of drain assemblies. Both types use a trip lever,
located in the coverplate, to raise and lower the linkage assembly inside
of the overflow drain, and both types are adjusted in the same way.

Plunger-type drains have a hollow brass plug (plunger)
that slides up and down inside the assembly’s overflow
drain. When lowered, the plunger stops the water from
draining.

Unclogging Tub and Shower Drains
Stuff You 
Need to Know
A slow draining tub or shower is usually caused by buildup of hair in
the drain line. Sometimes you can remove the blockage by snagging it
with a piece of stiff wire. And sometimes it can be moved farther into
and down the drain using a plunger. But if your drain is still clogged
after trying to snag the clog or plunge the drain, it’s time to get out the
hand auger.
Clearing a tub or shower drain with a plunger:
1.
Stuff a wet rag in the overflow drain opening
before plunging to prevent air from breaking
the suction of the plunger.
2.
Place the plunger over the drain to form a
seal, and then quickly push and pull the
plunger repeatedly until the drain clears.

2.
Carefully remove the drain linkage assembly
from the tub.
3.
Push the auger cable into the opening until
you feel resistance. Leave about 6 inches of
extra cable out of the opening and tighten
the auger screw.
Clearing a tub drain with an auger through the

M
ost people don’t like cleaning the toilet, much less
working on it when there’s a plumbing problem. But
it’s a fact of life and homeownership that sometimes you
have to get down and dirty and address toilet-related
problems. This part covers the toilet from tank to bowl
(including the seat!). You discover how to check and fix
leaks in the bowl or tank, replace the parts hiding inside
the tank, and battle the dreaded toilet clog with a plunger
or closet auger.

Checking a Toilet for Leaks
Checking a Toilet for Leaks
If you notice water on the floor around the toilet and you know that it
didn’t come from the kids splashing in the bathroom sink or from the
family dog getting a free drink, then it’s critical that you find out where
the leak is coming from and fix it — now!
Ignoring a leaking toilet does more than waste water. A toilet leak can
cause major structural problems both in the floor around the toilet and
in the ceiling of the room below. And if your situation gets to that point,
you may have to bring in a professional to make some major (and
majorly expensive) repairs.
Checking a toilet for leaks is simple and easy. In fact, it’s so easy that
there are no tools required; you need just a couple teaspoons of food
coloring and about an hour to wait and see where the leaks are located.
If the leak is from the tank, turn to the project “Repairing a Leaky Tank;”
if the leak is from the bowl, turn to the project “Repairing a Leaky
Bowl.”
Toolbox:
 Paper towels
Materials:
 Food coloring (red or
blue work best for 
contrast)
Time Needed:
Less than an hour
Stuff You 
Need to Know
1.
Put several drops (8–10 or enough to color
the water) of food coloring into the toilet
tank. Do the same for the bowl. Wait 1 hour,
making sure that the toilet isn’t flushed in
the meantime.

3.
Run another dry paper towel under the tank
where it meets the bowl. If you see color on the
towel, the leak is from the tank.
2.
Rub a dry paper towel around the entire
base of the bowl where it meets the floor. If
you see color on the towel, then the leak is
from the bowl.

119
Replacing a Fill Valve
Replacing a Fill Valve
The process of replacing a fill valve is the same no matter what type
you have — plunger, diaphragm, or float cup. The fill valve controls the
water coming back into the tank after the toilet is flushed. (The outgo-
ing water that goes to the bowl to do the flushing is controlled by the
flush valve and flapper assembly; turn to the project “Replacing a Flush
Valve” or the project “Replacing a Flapper” as appropriate.)
Toilet fill valves can develop leaks. Hard water causes rubber seals and
gaskets to deteriorate, and minerals in the water find their way onto the
moving parts of the fill valve, causing them to operate slow or eventu-
ally not operate at all. Most folks find that replacing the old fill valve
with a similar type is easier than replacing it with a different type
because you follow the same steps to install the new valve as you did to
remove the old one — just in reverse order.
The most commonly used type of replacement fill valve used today is
the Fluidmaster style. It fits virtually every type of conventional toilet
tank and has an easily adjusted float cup that regulates the water level
in the tank. Updated versions of the more traditional float-arm and ball
fill valves have primarily plastic parts now, so they last longer than
their old metal counterparts. Either type works fine, so the choice usu-
ally comes down to personal preference or the type of valve you’re
replacing.
Toolbox:

Time Needed:
Less than half a day
Stuff You 
Need to Know
1.
Turn off the water supply valve located
below the tank. Just turn the handle clock-
wise to shut off the water.
2.
Drain the tank by flushing the toilet, and use
a sponge to soak up any excess water in the
tank.

4.
Drain the tank by flushing the toilet, and use
a sponge to soak up any standing water in
the tank. Place a bucket under the toilet tank
and remove the supply tube, which is con-
nected to the shutoff valve and fill valve.
5.
Loosen and remove the nut on the bottom of
the fill valve; it’s located on the bottom of
the outside of the tank where you find the
water supply feed. Leave the bucket under
the fill valve to catch any water that may run
out when you loosen the nut.
3.
Disconnect the supply line from the tail
piece of the fill valve, located on the under-
side of the tank. Also disconnect the supply
line from the shutoff valve.

7.
Determine the height of the replacement fill
valve so that the markings near the valve’s
top assembly are at least 1 inch above the
top of the overflow tube.
8.
Twist the bottom of the valve shaft to adjust
the height. If your fill valve is different from
the one pictured, follow the manufacturer’s
instructions on how to adjust the valve
height.
6.
Remove the old fill valve by pulling up on it.

122
9.
Insert the fill valve into the tank, placing the
valve’s threaded tail piece through the hole
in the bottom of the tank.
Part IV: Toilets 
12. Attach the refill tube and adaptor to the
overflow valve.
10. Secure the valve to the bottom of the tank
with its plastic locknut. Don’t overtighten
the locknut; tighten it by hand, and then use
your adjustable wrench to go about one-half
turn farther.
11. Reconnect the water supply to the threaded
tail piece and the shutoff valve.

123
Replacing a Fill Valve
14. Remove the valve top cover or cap. Hold an
overturned cup over the uncapped valve,
and turn on the water supply to flush the
system. Flush the system for about 10 to 15
seconds, and then turn off the water. (You
want any debris or rust that may have
broken loose when you removed and
replaced the valve to be flushed out.)
15. Replace the valve cap by engaging the lugs
on the cap and valve body and rotating the
cap about one-eighth turn. Ensure that the
cap is firmly locked to the valve body or
you’ll have water spraying everywhere when
you open the water supply.
13. Make sure the refill tube and overflow valve
are aligned as shown.

124
Part IV: Toilets 
16. Adjust the water level in the tank by turning
the screw on the rod next to the fill valve.
Some fill valves have a clip that you can
slide up and down. The water lever should
be about 1 inch below the top of the over-
flow tube.

125
Replacing a Flush Valve
Replacing a Flush Valve
The time may come when you need to replace a toilet flush valve and the
rubber spud washer that prevents water leaks when the tank water goes
into the bowl. Hard water can eat away at the rubber gaskets in these
parts and can cause them to fail over time. When that happens, your best
bet is to replace the flush valve.
This repair has several steps, but it’s one that even a novice can handle if
you take your time. The steps will go a little easier if you recruit someone
to lend a hand.

cially designed to fit toilet tank spud nuts.)
Remove the old flush valve. The flapper is part of
the flush valve, so you replace it, too.
9.
Install the beveled cone washer onto the tail
piece of the new flush valve. The beveled
side should face the end of the tail piece.
Reinstall the flush valve in the tank.

Time Needed:
Less than an hour
Stuff You 
Need to Know
Hard water is the leading cause for this repair. Minerals in the water
build up on the flapper and around the opening of the base of the flush
valve, and the sediment eventually destroys the flapper. The good news
is that you can replace a flapper in the time it takes to have a cup of
coffee!
1.
Turn off the water supply valve. Drain the
tank by flushing the toilet, and use a sponge
to soak up any excess water in the tank.

131
Replacing a Flapper
3.
Remove the old flapper. Most types have
slotted tabs that slip over ears on either 
side of the flush valve (or overflow tube
assembly).
4.
Line up the new flapper with the flush valve
opening, and slip the flapper tabs over the
flush valve ears. The new flapper lift point
should be aligned with the flush lift arm.
2.
Disconnect the chain from the toilet handle
flush arm.

132
Part IV: Toilets 
5.
Connect the flapper chain to the lift arm.
6.
Adjust the chain length as needed so that
there’s about 1⁄2 inch of slack in the chain.
Be careful not to snap off the valve ears when removing the flapper in Step 3. If you break off an ear, you need
to replace the flush valve, which I cover in the project “Replacing a Flush Valve.”

Plunger-valve ballcock arm: Most plunger-valve ballcock arms are
brass and are easily adjusted by gently bending the arm up or
down. To lower the water level, bend the arm down slightly; to
raise the water level, bend the arm upward.

The sound of running water in an outdoor setting may be serene and
relaxing, but slow running water in the toilet means water is being
wasted — and you’re paying for it! Adjusting the water level in a toilet
tank is easy no matter what style of fill valve assembly your toilet has.
The four basic types are: plunger-valve ballcock arm, diaphragm ball-
cock, floatless ballcock, and float cup ballcock.
A little adjustment goes a long way, so make small adjustments and
recheck the water level after each adjustment by flushing the toilet and
observing the new water level in the tank.
Floatless ballcocks: These types use a pres-
sure-sensing device to control tank water
level. To adjust the water level, turn the
adjustment screw one-half turn clockwise to
raise the level and one-half turn counter-
clockwise to lower the level.
Diaphragm ballcock: The diaphragm ballcock type of valve float
arm is usually made of a soft plastic that you can bend up or down
depending on whether you need to raise or lower the water level in
the tank. Bend it down to lower the water level and up to raise the
level.

134
Part IV: Toilets 
Floatless ballcocks are no longer allowed by plumbing codes and really should be replaced with any of the other
three types.Turn to the project “Replacing a Flush Valve” for instructions.
Float cup ballcock: If you have a float cup
ballcock valve, lower the water level by turn-
ing the screw on the rod connected to the fill
valve.

Stuff You 
Need to Know
Many times a toilet tank leak can be traced back to the tank bolts that
go through the bottom of the tank and connect the tank to the toilet
base. Each bolt has a rubber gasket between the bolt head and the tank
to stop water from leaking. Another part that could devlop a leak is the
spud washer, which seals the gap between the flush valve and bowl.
Over time, hard water and minerals cause the gaskets and spud washer
to deteriorate and fail. A leaky tank is a common problem that thank-
fully has an easy fix! 
1.
Turn off the water supply by turning the
shutoff valve clockwise.  Drain the tank by
flushing the toilet, and use a sponge to soak
up any remaining water in the bottom of the
tank.

3.
Remove the tank from the bowl
and lay the tank down. (See the
“Replacing a Flush Valve” proj-
ect.) A helper is good to have
with this step.
4.
Remove the old spud washer.
2.
Unscrew the tank bolts with an adjustable
wrench and screwdriver. You have to use the
adjustable wrench to hold the nut located on
the underside of the tank bolt, and then use
the screwdriver to loosen the tank bolt
inside the tank.

5.
Insert the new spud washer.
7.
Place the new gasket onto each bolt, and
insert each bolt through the holes in the
inside bottom of the tank. On the underside
of the tank, reinstall the nuts onto the bolts
and gently tighten them by hand until
they’re snug.
8.
Replace the tank on the bowl. Alternating
side to side, tighten the bolts and nuts
(using the screwdriver and adjustable
wrench, as in Step 2) until the gaskets look
like they’re seated. Then tighten each tank
bolt nut another quarter turn.
When reattaching the tank to the bowl, just remember not to overtighten the bolts that secure the tank to the
toilet base or you can easily crack the tank.
6.
Pull out the tank bolts and gaskets, and use the wire brush to scrape
off any of the old bolt gasket that may remain stuck to either the
inside or the outside of the tank. You need a clean surface for the
new gasket to seat and seal properly.

Repairing a leaky toilet bowl is one plumbing repair that you need to
plan ahead to do because the toilet is out of commission for the entire
time of the repair. If it’s the only one in the house, you could make a lot
of enemies in your family if you don’t let them know ahead of time.
(Because it’s better to be safe than sorry, ask a neighbor if your family
can use their bathroom while you make this repair.)
This is a messy repair but one that’s made a lot easier if you make room
and take your time. Toilet locations usually don’t allow for much work-
ing room, so remove anything from the toilet area that may get in the
way of your work — such as the wastebasket, scale, clothes hamper,
and any decorative items. Also, keep in mind that this is a two-part
repair: Part one involves removing the tank, and part two involves
removing the toilet base (bowl).
1.
Turn off the water supply by turning the
shutoff valve clockwise. Drain the tank by
flushing the toilet, and use a sponge to soak
up any excess water in the tank.
3.
Loosen the toilet bowl nuts (which connect
the toilet base to the floor) with an
adjustable wrench, and remove the nuts.
2.
Remove the toilet tank as instructed in the
“Replacing a Flush Valve” project. Set the
tank on towels away from your work area so
that it’s out of your way.

139
Repairing a Leaky Bowl
4.
Rock the toilet base back and forth to
release the base from the old wax ring,
which is under the base between it and the
floor drain opening. Get into position so that
you can lift the base straight up. If it’s too
heavy for you, get a helper!
5.
Place the bowl on its side on an old
towel (to catch any water that may
be in the trap). Don’t remove the
flange bolts unless they’re damaged
and need to be replaced. If they
need replacing, do it now.
6.
Stuff a rag into the floor drain open-
ing to prevent gases from entering
the house (and to prevent anything
from falling down the drain while the
toilet is off!). Use a putty knife to
scrape off the old wax ring. Also
remove the old rubber flange from
the drain horn on the bottom of the
toilet bowl.

140
Part IV: Toilets 
8.
Remove the rag from the drain. Don’t forget this step!
9.
Lift the toilet base, and slowly set it down
over the flange bolts. Press down evenly on
the base to compress the wax ring and prop-
erly seat the base.
Use a penny instead of a shim to level the bowl in Step 10.They work great and everyone has some lying
around!
7.
Turn the bowl upside down on the towel.
Place the new wax ring (with flange) over
the drain horn of the toilet.

141
Repairing a Leaky Bowl
11. Reinstall the bowl nuts connecting the base
to the floor, and tighten them by hand until
snug.
12. Using an adjustable wrench, tighten the bowl
nuts gradually, switching from one side to
the other to prevent cracking the base and
to keep the base level. Don’t overtighten the
nuts — wrench-snug is tight enough!
13. Put a dab of plumber’s putty inside each
decorative bolt cap, and put the caps on the
bolts.
10. Level the toilet, using plastic shims
(available at home centers and hard-
ware stores) as needed. 

142
Part IV: Toilets 
15. Reconnect the water supply and use the
toilet for several days. Check regularly
during this time for leaks, and redo this
repair if you find that the bowl still leaks.
16. When you’re sure that the toilet is leak-free,
apply silicone caulk to fill and seal the gap
between the toilet base and the floor.
14. Reinstall the tank as described in the
“Replacing a Flush Valve” project.

Not all toilet leaks come from inside or the underside of a tank.
Sometimes Mother Nature and weather conditions play a part in a leak-
ing toilet; humidity can cause condensation to form on the outside of
the tank. To prevent this, you need to insulate the tank by lining it with
polystyrene foam insulation. All the materials you need are available at
home centers and hardware stores.
1.
Turn off the water supply by turning the
shutoff valve clockwise. Drain the tank by
flushing the toilet, and use a sponge to soak
up any excess water in the tank. Dry the
inside of the tank with an old towel. (The
tank needs to be completely dry before you
secure the insulation panels.)

2.
Hold the foam panel up to the tank and mark
how wide the sheet should be to fit within
the tank.
3.
Cut the foam to the proper width. You may
need to angle-cut the bottom corners to fit

A cosmetic upgrade is the most common reason for installing a new
toilet seat. Yes, a seat can get damaged or even crack, but most often
the goal is to simply freshen up the look of the toilet. Replacing a toilet
seat may be the easiest bathroom repair to make because you don’t
even need to turn off the water.
Toilet seats come in two basic styles or sizes: round (16 inches from
front to back) and oblong or elongated (18 inches from front to back).
Measure the old seat before you go shopping or take the old seat with
you to ensure that you get the correct size.
2.
Use the screwdriver and adjustable wrench
to remove the seat bolts, which secure the
toilet seat to the base. With the adjustable
wrench, hold the nut located on the under-

Stuff You 
Need to Know
Unfortunately, a clogged toilet is a problem that crops up all too often in
homes. Fortunately, clearing a clogged toilet with a plunger is one
plumbing project that almost every do-it-yourselfer can handle.
Most toilet clogs are caused by an object that’s stuck in the toilet trap
and not in the drain line pipe in the floor. Use a plunger to clear block-
ages caused by waste, both if your toilet is completely blocked and if it
flushes sluggishly (in which case, your toilet may be partially blocked).
If the plunger doesn’t clear the blockage and you’re not sure that the
clog is from waste, try unclogging the toilet using an auger (see the
project “Clearing a Clog with a Closet Auger”).
1.
Pull on your rubber gloves. Check the water
level in the toilet bowl by sticking the
plunger into the drain outlet. In order to
form a seal around the flange of the plunger,
there should be enough water in the bowl
for the plunger to be submerged at least
halfway. If there’s little or no water in the
bowl, pour some in.

150

A closet auger is the tool of choice when an object — like a sponge, a
child’s toy block, or even car keys! — is the cause of a toilet blockage. A
closet auger is designed to grab or snag the object so that you can pull
it out of the toilet and not flush it down the drain line as you would
using a plunger.
1.
Place the auger bend (the covered section
that protects the toilet bowl’s surface from
being scratched) into the drain outlet and
push the cable into the trap. Keep pushing
until you feel it touch the obstruction.
2.
Crank the auger handle clockwise to snag or
grab the obstruction. Continue cranking
while pulling the auger cable (and the

Try Simple Solutions First
Plumbing problems aren’t always as complex and challenging as you may think. In
some situations, the simplest solution may be the one that gets the job done. Always
start with the simplest fix for the problem, and then logically proceed to the next if
the first doesn’t work. For example, if the water flow from a faucet is restricted, try
cleaning the aerator before you dive into disassembling the faucet.
Work During Store Hours
Whenever possible, plan to work on a plumbing project when you know that stores
are open. Don’t start a plumbing project at 10 p.m. on Sunday night and expect your
local hardware store or home center to be open at midnight when you need that one
other part to finish the job. Even if you think you have everything you need for a proj-
ect, it’s best to keep your options open in case a surprise trip to the hardware store is
in your future.
Plan, Plan, Plan
Plan out and review the project before you begin. Going through each step helps you
identify potential problem areas, saving you time and money.

Part V: The Part of Tens
Know Your Home
Know your home’s plumbing system! (I cover residential plumbing systems in
Chapter 1.) Before you get started on a plumbing project, identify the location of
the main shutoff valve and drain line cleanouts. Familiarizing yourself with these
locations and knowing what to do with them allows you to prevent extensive water
damage in the event of a major water problem.
Don’t Forget the Codes
Investigate and follow your local codes. Plumbing and building codes exist to keep
you and your house in safe working order, and it’s your responsibility as a home-
owner and do-it-yourselfer to be informed. When in doubt, consult your local inspec-
tors to make sure that you understand the codes and are following them properly.
Don’t Be a Cheapskate
When it comes to plumbing parts and fixtures, you truly get what you pay for! Buy
the best products and materials you can afford. The better the part or fixture, the
longer it will last and the more time you’ll have between replacement jobs or repairs.
Have the Right Tools
Build a basic tool kit to start. Don’t run out and buy every tool we show and explain
in Chapter 4; instead, start with the essential tools for making basic plumbing
repairs, and add tools as you need them. Don’t be afraid to rent tools, too. There’s
no sense in shelling out hundreds of dollars when you can spend $20 or $30 to rent
that tool that you’ll only use once in a while.
Ask for Advice
Don’t be shy or embarrassed about asking for advice at your hardware store or home
center. Most of these types of stores have at least one plumbing expert, so seek out
him or her to answer even the most basic plumbing questions. You won’t be the first!
Know When to Call a Pro
The first step in solving a problem is accepting that you’re in over your head. Then
you can take a breath and call in a professional plumber! The longer you wait and
the more you try to fix the problem yourself, the more you end up paying the pro to
undo your work and then fix things the right way.

Don’t Procrastinate
Don’t put off minor repairs! A simple repair like a dripping faucet or a running toilet
is an easy job — especially when compared to a replacement project that’s neces-
sary because you didn’t stop the drip.

Ten Tips for Dealing with 
Problematic Pipes
In This Chapter
 Quieting noisy pipes
 Keeping pipes from working up a sweat
 Treating leaks and frozen pipes
I
’m sure you’ve heard people complain about their homes’ plumbing pipes bang-
ing and rattling or about how a pipe’s constantly dripping from a leaky fitting.
That’s just the tip of the iceberg. Practically everyone’s heard a horror story about
what happened when a pipe froze and split. Noisy pipes, sweaty pipes, and frozen
or leaking pipes are issues that you, the do-it-yourselfer, can actually do something
about. This chapter covers ten things you can do to deal with these three pipe
problems.
Noisy Pipes
Pipes generally make noise when a water valve is opened, for example when either
the cold or hot water valve on your clothes washer is opened. Here are three
options you can try to give yourself some peace and quiet:

Install water hammers. Water hammers come in screw-on and sweated
installation styles, so ask your local plumbing expert which type works best
for your situation. For example, the screw-on version is best for noisy pipes
leading to your clothes washer, whereas the sweated version of water
hammer is best for horizontal water supply pipes that bang.

Install additional pipe straps or plastic antivibration pipe clamps. Metal
(usually copper) pipe straps are inexpensive and usually do the trick. If the
noise or movement is really bad, install a wraparound-style antivibration
clamp.

Wrap pipes with foam insulation. You can reduce the noise from pipes by
wrapping them (both horizontal and vertical sections) with foam insulation.
This type of insulation is sold in 3- or 4-foot lengths that are presplit and
simply slip over the pipe. Be sure to get the correct diameter pipe wrap; it
comes in sizes to fit 1⁄2- and 3⁄4-inch diameter copper pipe.

Part V: The Part of Tens
Sweating Pipes
Pipes sweat when a combination of humidity in the air and water running through
the pipes causes condensation to form on the outer surface of the pipe. The most
common place in the house for sweating pipes is in the basement because of the
usually higher humidity there. Running a dehumidifier may help, but there is a better
solution.
Pipe wrap (also mentioned in the last bullet of the preceding section) is the best
material to keep pipes from sweating. Simply slip it over the pipes, making sure to
wrap the corners of the pipes, too, to insure complete coverage and eliminate any
chance for condensation to drip.
Frozen or Leaking Pipes
Leaks are never fun, and frozen pipes can fray anyone’s nerves. These tips should
help:

Use plumber’s epoxy for a quick fix on a small pipe leak. Follow the manu-
facturer’s instructions for application to seal the leak — until you can make
a permanent repair!

Use a piece of 1⁄16-inch neoprene rubber and two metal hose clamps to
cover the split or leaking area. Wrap the rubber over the leak, and seal
both ends to the pipe with the clamps.

Use a sleeve clamp to seal a leaking pipe. This clamp is hinged and fits
over the pipe sort of like a clamshell. It comes with a short length of rubber,
which you place over the leak before you put the sleeve in place. Then you
secure the clamp over the pipe with the supplied bolts and nuts.

Thaw a frozen pipe using a hair dryer or heat lamp. First, be sure to 
turn off the water and drain any water that’s downstream from the frozen
blockage.

Wrap an old towel or rag over a frozen pipe at the blockage, and pour hot
water over the towel. Leave the towel in place until the blockage thaws.
Repeat as needed by applying more hot water.

Protect pipes that regularly freeze by wrapping electric heat tape around
the pipe. Use only UL-approved heat tape, and follow the manufacturer’s
instructions for installation and operation.

Ten Safety Considerations
In This Chapter
 Taking time for preparations
 Wearing proper protection
I
f you follow some basic safety rules and use common sense, you can tackle most
home plumbing repair projects. Just remember: When in doubt, call in a pro!
Think about Safety Before Anything Else
Keep safety as your top priority. What do I mean? Start by knowing where main shut-
off valves are located. Also keep the work area as clear of extra tools and materials
as possible.
Don’t Get Zapped
If you’re making a plumbing repair near an electrical source, turn off the power to
that source. Whether it’s an outlet or a switch, remember that water and electricity
don’t mix!
Have Emergency Numbers Handy
Keep a list of emergency numbers nearby. The list should include phone numbers
for utilities, fire, police, and medical emergency.
Chill
Take a deep breath, and keep calm! Even if you’re facing a burst pipe and water is
going everywhere, or if you’re dealing with an overflowing toilet, do your best to
keep your head and shut off the water source as soon as possible to prevent further
water damage.

162
Part V: The Part of Tens
Practice
Learn how to use a plunger and an auger BEFORE you need them! Your first crack at
using such tools shouldn’t be under pressure in an emergency situation.
Protect Your Eyes
Wear eye protection. Safety goggles or safety glasses are a must when you’re cutting,
soldering, or working over your head. Safety glasses provide adequate protection for
most jobs, but safety goggles provide the best protection for your eyes.
Protect Your Ears
Wear hearing protection when using power tools, pounding, or hammering. Just
because you’re “only making one or two cuts with the power saw” doesn’t mean that
you don’t need hearing protection. The same is true when you’re hammering or
doing some heavy-duty pounding. Continual, loud noise can damage your hearing
more than you may think.
Protect Your Hands
Gloves are a must, and even more important, you need to make sure you wear the
right type of glove for the job. If you’re working where chemicals may have been
used, wear heavy-duty rubber gloves. If you’re soldering, heavy-duty leather gloves
protect your hands from an accidental drip of hot solder. Also, wear long pants and
long sleeves to protect you from wastewater that may contain chemicals or carry
bacteria. Launder the clothing when you’re finished with the job.
Protect Your Lungs
Chemical fumes can be toxic, so wear a respirator when working with or around
chemicals.
Use the Right Tools
The first lesson of any do-it-yourself project is to use the right tools for the job. A
screwdriver isn’t a chisel, and a wrench isn’t a hammer! The wrong tool makes the
job harder and probably does more damage to whatever it is you’re working on.
Ultimately, the repair takes longer and costs more money in the long run.
