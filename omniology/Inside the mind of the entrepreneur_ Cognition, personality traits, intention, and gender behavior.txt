Entrepreneur’s Cognition and Intention

An Integrated Model of Intentional
Entrepreneurial Action
Kevin C. Cox, Jason Lortie, and Gary Castrogiovanni
Abstract The psychological perspective of entrepreneurship has a rich history in
entrepreneurship research. While personality and psychology have both been iden-
tiﬁed as key components in explaining how and why entrepreneurs act, many
questions remain about what different factors lead to entrepreneurial action and
outcomes as well as the role these factors have in the process. We shed light on
these important questions by integrating two leading models of the individual
psychology of entrepreneurship: the Action-Characteristics Model (ACM) of Entre-
preneurship and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). We create the Intentional
Entrepreneurial Action Model by integrating these two perspectives together to
address concerns about the ACM and TPB considered separately. By synthesizing
these two models into the Intentional Entrepreneurial Action Model and presenting
supporting propositions, we develop an explanation about how entrepreneurs think
and how this intentional process leads to entrepreneurial action and outcomes.

Introduction
Entrepreneurship has been deﬁned as the identiﬁcation, evaluation, and exploitation
of opportunities (Shane and Venkataraman 2000). The phenomenon of entrepre-
neurship is largely centralized around the individual-opportunity nexus (Shane
2003). Therefore, unsurprisingly, a wide variety of individual factors inﬂuence
the processes of identiﬁcation, evaluation, and exploitation. The psychological
perspective offers considerable insight into how various individual factors inﬂuence
these processes.

Psychological and cognitive perspectives have a rich history in the entrepre-
neurship domain (e.g. Comegys 1976; McClelland and Winter 1971; McGaffey and
Christy 1975) some of which are regarded as foundational works during the early
emergence of entrepreneurship as a distinctive ﬁeld of study (e.g. Schumpeter
1934; McClelland 1961). More recently, the psychological perspective has emerged
as an effective and appropriate perspective for entrepreneurship research. This
focus on the psychological perspective has led to numerous theoretical develop-
ments and research ﬁndings that have informed the ﬁeld of entrepreneurship and
provided important insight into the role of the entrepreneur throughout the entre-
preneurial process. Psychology based perspectives may offer the most fruitful
insight into the “the people side of entrepreneurship”, and address some of the
entrepreneurship’s most fundamental questions (Mitchell et al. 2002, p. 93).
To date, the psychological perspective has provided considerable contribution to
the entrepreneurship domain via the continued evolution of more accurate and
sophisticated models of an array of psychological inﬂuences particularly relevant
to the process of entrepreneurship. However, research focused directly on the
outcomes (e.g. opportunity identiﬁcation, new venture performance) associated
with psychological and cognitive inﬂuences remains underdeveloped. This is the
fundamental challenge faced by the overwhelming majority entrepreneurship
research steeped in the psychological perspective. The result is either research
which fails to directly address fundamental entrepreneurial outcomes, or weak
theoretical linkages paired with empirically driven ﬁndings. Both of which inaccu-
rately link psychological factors directly to entrepreneurial outcomes.
The central purpose here is to develop an integrated and comprehensive model
of psychological factors that inﬂuence entrepreneurial action and entrepreneurial
outcomes. Our model effectively integrates the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB)
and Action-Characteristics Model (ACM) of entrepreneurial behavior. The intent is
to establish clearly delineated links between psychological factors, entrepreneurial
action characteristics, and subsequent entrepreneurial outcomes that are directly
related to entrepreneurial thinking. The intended result is the development of a
more complete explanation and clear depiction of the role of psychological factors
in the process of entrepreneurship.

Literature Review
2.1
Overview
The objective of the following sections is to provide an extensive review of the
existing models which attempt to provide a comprehensive explanation about
entrepreneurial action and outcomes. We provide a complete overview and expla-
nation of the theoretical frameworks [the Action-Characteristics Model of entre-
preneurial success (ACM) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB)] along with
4
K.C. Cox et al.

more recent important theoretical and empirical developments relevant to the
application of each model in the entrepreneurship domain. This serves as the
theoretical foundation upon which we will build our integrative conceptual model.
2.2
The Action-Characteristics Model of Entrepreneurship
The ACM of entrepreneurship represents a recent evolution of what was initially
referred to as the Giessen-Amsterdam model of entrepreneurial success (i.e. Rauch
and Frese 2000). The earlier Giessen-Amsterdam Model is an interdisciplinary
model that takes into consideration several different areas investigated in entrepre-
neurship research beyond psychological factors. However, this earlier version of
what eventually evolved to the full ACM, is an action-based model because no
direct relationships are proposed between personality, human capital, or environ-
ment and entrepreneurial success, although many of these relationships have been,
and continue to be, studied. Although perhaps controversial, the model rests upon
the fundamental assumption that there cannot be success without action (Rauch and
Frese 2000). As such, action is essential and central to the model and the goal
oriented strategies and tactics of actions are the conduit through which all entre-
preneurial success is accomplished (or not accomplished). Sometimes goals, strate-
gies, and tactics will be wrong, or inefﬁcient, which is one example of how prior
failure (or success) inﬂuences strategies that explain the proposed reciprocal rela-
tionship between success and strategy. Preliminary empirical ﬁndings focused on
the indirect effect of personality traits on entrepreneurial success via action strate-
gies and growth intentions provide initial support for the model (e.g. Baum and
Locke 2004; Frese et al. 2007). However, this earlier model is necessarily less
speciﬁc and more all-encompassing as it is designed for application at different
levels of analysis (organizational or individual). Therefore, we next focus speciﬁ-
cally on the revised versions of the ACM.
The second version of the ACM of entrepreneurship (i.e. Frese 2009) represents
more recent and individually oriented evolution. This framework describes char-
acteristics of active performance and postulates how they are inﬂuenced by per-
sonality and human capital as well as how active performance is directly related to
entrepreneurial success. It also assumes that active performance may inﬂuence
environmental conditions and is also inﬂuenced by the environment.
Continuing to the most comprehensive and recent ACM (i.e. Frese 2009; Frese
and Gielnik 2014), the most fundamental and important premise of the ACM is the
associated action-based assumptions underlying the model. Speciﬁcally, there is
only a direct path to success from actions. Thus, just as with the previous deriva-
tions of the model, personality, motivation, education, cognition and even the
environment are not expected to have a direct effect on success. Factors other
than action only inﬂuence success indirectly through an entrepreneur’s actions, as
there is no sound theoretical rationale to expect a direct relationship between these
various factors and entrepreneurial success. Instead, it is argued that the factors
An Integrated Model of Intentional Entrepreneurial Action
5

depicted only inﬂuence success if they inﬂuence action, and otherwise have no
signiﬁcant effect.
A few other important aspects of the ACM are also worth noting. First, action
characteristics are not explicitly action, but instead ways of performing an action
(Frese and Gielnik 2014). Thus, actual action is required, but the way it is
performed is of considerable importance. Second, it is assumed that more active
action characteristics lead to actions that are more likely to be successful (e.g. more
personal initiative, proactivity etc.) (Frese 2009). Third, the framework is organized
such that the more distal construct (on the left) are assumed to have less eventual
inﬂuence on success; whereas those which are nearer (on the right) are to have
stronger inﬂuences on action and eventual success. Finally, the ACM offers a
process oriented perspective of entrepreneurial actions and entrepreneurial success
in suggesting that different actions are important at different stages throughout the
entrepreneurial process. The ACM is the primary conceptual framework and serves
as the foundation which the theoretical model derived here is built upon.
The ACM is a “loose model” that actually “is more of a framework than a real
theoretical model” (Frese and Gielnik 2014, p. 428). In its current form, the ACM
does not adequately distinguish between intention and action (or action characteris-
tics) but instead lumps them together. This is evident in that “goals/visions,” are
included as action characteristics while in fact goals, objectives, and the like are
much more closely related to intentions (although they certainly inﬂuence action).
Thus, we propose using the TPB to “tighten” the ACM. Borrowing from and
integrating aspects of the TPB enables a theoretically sound distinction between
intentions and actions therefore strengthening the eventual conceptual model
developed here. The underlying logic, accuracy, and usefulness of the TPB are
reviewed in the following section.
2.3
The Theory of Planned Behavior
The fundamental premise of the TPB is that the relationship between an individual’s
attitudes towards a behavior, the subjective norms surrounding the behavior, and
the perceived control over the behavior are all mediated by the individual’s
intentions. Intention is deﬁned as a person’s readiness to perform a given behavior,
and it is assumed to be the immediate antecedent of behavior (Ajzen 2011a, b). The
three cognitive antecedents to intention include: (1) attitude, which refers to the
degree to which a person has a favorable or unfavorable evaluation of the behavior;
(2) subjective norms, which refer to the perceived opinions of reference groups
(or social pressure) regarding whether or not the behavior should be performed; and
(3) perceived behavioral control, which refers to the perceived ease or difﬁculty of
performing the behavior (Ajzen 1991).
The TPB has proven to be a very robust predictor of a wide array of different
behaviors as evident by the numerous meta-analyses that support intentions as
strong predictors of behavior in many different applied settings (e.g. Armitage
6
K.C. Cox et al.

and Conner 2001; Sutton 1998). Perhaps more importantly, within the entrepre-
neurship domain the TPB has been effectively utilized as a framework for
predicting an array of different entrepreneurial intentions such as new venture
creation intentions (Kolvereid 1996) and new venture growth intentions (Cassar
2006) as well as a number of relevant behaviors such as venture creation behavior
(Chrisman 1999) and new venture growth behavior (Delmar and Wiklund 2008).
Additionally, previous entrepreneurship studies have found the three antecedents to
explain between 30 and 45% of the variation in intentions (e.g. Linan and Chen
2009; Van Gelderen et al. 2008). Overall, the TPB has been established as a highly
relevant and robust framework for predicting business start-up intentions and
subsequent behaviors (Kautonen et al. 2013).
3
Intentional Entrepreneurial Action Model
Upon close inspection of the ACM and the TPB it becomes evident that although
they are clearly distinctive, the two theoretical frameworks can effectively be
integrated. Speciﬁcally, the more precise psychological constructs uniquely rele-
vant to entrepreneurship included in the ACM can be appropriately placed within
the framework delineated by the TPB. Therefore, the theoretical model developed
here integrates speciﬁc constructs included in the with the intention-behavior link
established by the TPB resulting in a more comprehensive model of how and in
what ways psychological factors inﬂuence intention and actions of entrepreneurs.
This fully integrated model labeled as the Intentional Entrepreneurial Action Model
is depicted below in Fig. 1.
In reading the Intentional Entrepreneurial Action Model seen in Fig. 1, our
general theorizing becomes evident. We believe that by enveloping the TPB in
the ACM antecedents and outcomes, a true representation of the psychology of
entrepreneurs becomes clear. What entrepreneurs accurately think becomes more
evident. The following sections will expand on these proposed relationships as we
argue for speciﬁc propositions. We note that the relationships within the TPB that
we are not altering are already established in the literature, and therefore, there will
not be any additional propositions for those relationships since we believe the
standard arguments for TPB will hold true.
Personality and Attitudes Towards Action
Largely stemming from the psychological perspective, personality has been previ-
ously identiﬁed as inﬂuential in a wide array of different contexts and related to all
types of different outcomes (e.g. leadership style, occupational preference). In the
context of entrepreneurship, earlier work focused on personality characteristics
yielded very little, and even faced considerable criticism (e.g. Gartner 1989).
More recently meta-analytic results suggest that personality does have important
role within the context of entrepreneurs even if one’s personality does not predict
entrepreneurship (e.g. Rauch and Frese 2007; Frese and Gielnik 2014; Zhao et al.

2010). Building on these (and other) ﬁndings we posit that personality directly
inﬂuences one’s attitude towards an entrepreneurial action.
An attitude towards an action refers to the degree to which performance of the
action is positively or negatively valued. Further, per the expectance-value model,
attitude toward action is determined by the entire set of accessible behavioral
beliefs which link the action to various outcomes and other attributes (Ajzen
1991). It is this set of behavioral beliefs which is inﬂuenced by various
personality-based constructs and then necessarily inﬂuences one’s attitudes towards
an action. For example, consider the implications of need for achievement (nAch)
(McClelland 1961). Research focused on nAch suggest that individuals character-
ized by high levels of need for achievement prefer action associated with interme-
diate levels of difﬁculty and risk which subsequently inﬂuence attitudes towards
action characterized by moderate risk which is support by meta-analytic ﬁndings
(i.e. Stewart and Roth 2004). Conversely, individuals not characterized by high
need for achievement will not form the same attitudes about actions characterized
be moderate levels of risk. The same rationale has similar implications for a wide
array of different personality traits. Therefore, we argue that personality directly
inﬂuences one’s attitude toward action.
Proposition 1 Personality factors are positively related to the attitude towards an
action an individual holds.
3.1
Social Preconditions and Subjective Norms
Social preconditions are expected to inﬂuence subjective norms about action. The
TPB’s deﬁnition of subjective norms relates to the perceived opinions of reference
groups regarding whether the action should be performed (Ajzen 2011a). In effect,
the subjective norms Ajzen theorized about relate to whether or not the individual
believes the action in question is appropriate. This belief about “appropriateness” is
directly related to what the ACM theorizes about “social preconditions” and factors
such as education and role models in the individual’s environment. We argue
further that these social preconditions that that affect individuals’ subjective
norms are more well deﬁned as what Berger and Luckmann (1966, 1991) called
primary and secondary socializations. Primary socializations are those socializa-
tions that individuals receive from their immediate family during the younger
formative years of life while secondary socializations are those socializations
received from other societal groups other than the family.
Accordingly, the educational socializations reminiscent of the ACM are similar
to what Berger and Luckmann (1966) argued were sources of secondary socializa-
tions while family role models are primary socializations. We argue that the ACM
was close to externalizing “social preconditions”, but that a better understanding is
via socializations. In terms of integrating the ACM and TPB, these environmental
socializations become individualized via an individual’s speciﬁc subjective norms.
An Integrated Model of Intentional Entrepreneurial Action

The perceived opinions that people form about an action are ultimately determined
by the experiences that they received concerning those actions from the primary
and secondary socializations that existed in their lives. In effect, the social pre-
conditions of the ACM allow for a better understanding of where the individual
psychological opinions of an action come from for a speciﬁc individual.
Proposition 2 Social preconditions are positively related to the subjective norms
about an action that an individual holds.
3.2
Cognitive/Affective Antecedents and Perceived
Behavioral Control
Both cognitive and affective antecedents have been previously established as
having an important role in the process of entrepreneurship (e.g. Baron 2007,
2008; Mitchell et al. 2002, 2007). But as discussed previously, there is insufﬁcient
rationale to expect that these factors directly inﬂuence entrepreneurial outcomes
because action determines outcomes. Instead, we can expect that cognitive and
affective antecedents directly inﬂuence perceived behavioral control over action.
As one example, consider the self-efﬁcacy construct (Bandura 1982) and the
subsequently research speciﬁcally relevant to the context of entrepreneurship
focused on entrepreneurial self-efﬁcacy. Entrepreneurial self-efﬁcacy is deﬁned
as “a person’s belief in their ability to successfully launch an entrepreneurial
venture” (McGee et al. 2009, p. 965). As such, it represents one’s perceived ability
to successfully perform tasks and associated demands speciﬁcally relevant to the
context and domain of entrepreneurship. Relatedly, perceived behavioral control
refers one’s perceptions of their ability to perform a given behavior. Analogous to
the expectant-value model associated with one’s attitude toward action, perceived
behavioral control is determined by the complete set of accessible control beliefs
which refer to beliefs about the presence of factors that may facilitate or impede
performance. Clearly then it would be expected that entrepreneurial self-efﬁcacy
will directly inﬂuence one’s perceived control over action related to entrepreneurial
initiatives. Therefore, we argue that this complete set of control beliefs is directly
inﬂuenced by an array of different cognitive and affective antecedents (entrepre-
neurial self-efﬁcacy being just one example). Thus, we expect cognitive and
affective antecedents to inﬂuence perceived behavioral control over action.
Proposition 3 Cognitive and affective antecedents are positively related to the
perceived behavioral control over an action that an individual holds.

3.3
Intention Towards Action and Action Characteristics
The link between intentions and action characteristics seen in the integrated model
of intentional entrepreneurial action is very similar to that of the original arguments
made by Ajzen about intentions and behaviors (Ajzen 1991). No behavior can occur
without some type of intention on the part of the individual. In terms of integrating
intentions with the action characteristics of the ACM, the arguments are very
similar. In effect, the actions described by the ACM are intentional actions that
require a certain level of intentionality on behalf of the individual prior to those
actions being carried out. From an entrepreneurship standpoint, all of the entrepre-
neurial actions depicted by the original ACM are inherently actions that require
some type of physiological energy and thought on behalf of the entrepreneur to
carry them out. They are actions that are not random, they do not come about by the
entrepreneur drifting into them. Instead, they take intentionality on behalf of the
entrepreneur to psychologically plan and prepare for that speciﬁc action in question.
Proposition 4 Intention towards an action is positively related to entrepreneurial
action characteristics
3.4
Personality and Action Characteristics
We also posit that personality will inﬂuence action characteristics for a variety of
reasons. First, it should be noted that action characteristics refer not to the actions
themselves, but instead to ways of performing actions. This is important because
different personality attributes are likely to inﬂuence the ways in which various
actions are performed, not the action itself. Different personality traits result in
different preferences in the way action is performed.
Consider again the preceding example of need for achievement and its implica-
tions for action characteristics. Obviously, with most general action there an inﬁnite
variation in the way it can be performed. As such, we would expect individuals
characterized by high nAch to prefer performing actions in certain ways that will
vary from those not characterized by high nAch. For example, in the entrepreneurial
context it is likely that nAch will inﬂuence opportunity search (among other action
characteristics). Need for achievement is related to a preference for moderate
difﬁculty and risk (and subsequently risk propensity). As such, this will inﬂuence
the search for opportunities. Speciﬁcally, opportunities requiring moderate difﬁ-
culty and moderate risk to exploit will be viewed more favorably compared to
opportunities that are easier to exploit and have less risk. Based on this application
of this rationale to other personality traits and action characteristics we expect that
personality will inﬂuence action characteristics resulting in the following
proposition.
An Integrated Model of Intentional Entrepreneurial Action
11

Proposition 5 Personality is positively related to action characteristics.
3.5
Cognitive and Affective Antecedents and Action
Characteristic
Cognitive and affective antecedents strongly inﬂuence action characteristics, or the
ways in which actions are performed. There are various implications that cognitive
and affective antecedents have on action characteristics as an example we consider
the potential effects of cognitive biases. Cognitive biases are uniquely important to
the entrepreneurial context because empirical research suggests that entrepreneurs
may be more susceptible to certain biases (e.g. Busenitz and Barney 1997), which
inﬂuence decision making processes, eventually impact the way certain actions are
performed. Speciﬁcally, consider entrepreneurs have been found to be more sus-
ceptible to bias associated with overconﬁdence (Keh et al. 2002), optimism
(Hmieleski and Baron 2009), and optimistic overconﬁdence (Simon and Shrader
2012). Now consider the implications that these distinctive, but related biases
would have in the entrepreneurial planning process. Planning is likely to be
conducted with the best-case scenario in mind. Conversely, individuals would do
not exhibit these optimistic biases will engage in more careful and systematically
planning that takes into account various what if scenarios. When this same rationale
is applied to other cognitive and affective constructs it becomes clear that they will
have a direct effect on action characteristics resulting in the following proposition.
In addition, the Azjen posited in the TPB that perceived behavioral control had a
direct relation with behavior. While meta-analysis has shown partial support for this
direct relationship (e.g. Rauch and Frese 2007; Frese and Gielnik 2014; Zhao et al.
2010), we believe that the lack of full support is due to the idea that perceived
behavioral control does not fully represent psychological aspects the way the
cognitive and affective antecedents of the ACM do. In these respects, we believe
that when accounting for the direct relationship between cognitive and affective
antecedents on action characteristics, the supposed link between perceived behav-
ioral control and action should become moot.
Proposition 6 Cognitive and affective antecedents are positively related to action
characteristics.
3.6
Action Characteristics and Entrepreneurial Outcomes
Finally, action characteristics refer to how various entrepreneurial actions, or
activities are performed rather than the action themselves. We know that a wide
variety of activities are uniquely relevant to the process of entrepreneurship
(e.g. business planning, opportunity identiﬁcation and evaluation, networking,
12
K.C. Cox et al.

etc.), yet empirical results about how these various activities lead to success is often
unclear, inconsistent, or even contradictory. We posit that simply engaging in these
various actions will not necessarily lead to entrepreneurial success and that instead
what matters is how these activities are performed. There is considerable discretion
concerning how various entrepreneurial actions are enacted and how these various
activities are undertaken will largely determine whether or not any entrepreneurial
objectives are successfully achieved. Therefore, we argue that action characteristics
are directly related to entrepreneurial outcomes.
Proposition 7 Action characteristics are positively related to entrepreneurial
outcomes.

Conclusion
First, this research addresses challenges associated with linking psychological
constructs to entrepreneurial outcomes (as discussed above), and therefore address
one of the primary shortcomings of psychology-based entrepreneurship research.
Identifying how speciﬁc psychological factors inﬂuence action will shed consider-
able insight into role that these factors have in indirectly inﬂuencing outcomes that
are particularly important for entrepreneurship. This research has important signif-
icance for theory, future research, practice, and policy.
In terms of theory, the primary objective is to provide an integrated and
comprehensive conceptual framework of action-based model of entrepreneurship.
This provides a consolidated theoretical foundation for the psychological perspec-
tive in entrepreneurship research by clearly establishing links between psycholog-
ical factors and eventual outcomes relevant in entrepreneurship. This proposed
model serves as the missing link between psychology and outcomes—action.
The model developed here has important signiﬁcance for future research as it
can easily be applied as a framework. This framework is capable of testing an
incalculable number of future hypotheses and proposed relationships among psy-
chology based constructs, intentions, actions, and entrepreneurial outcomes. In fact,
the framework is well-suited for testing the inﬂuence of most if not all psycholog-
ical constructs of interest to entrepreneurship researchers.
The relationships identiﬁed between action characteristics and entrepreneurial
outcomes will be of primary signiﬁcance to practitioners as these relationships will
be directly linked to entrepreneurial outcomes of interest (e.g. performance).
Understanding how speciﬁc action characteristics inﬂuence entrepreneurial out-
comes can potentially inform practitioners about the types of actions they may want
to purposefully engage in (or avoid) throughout different phases of the entrepre-
neurship process. Additionally, the links identiﬁed between certain psychological
factors and entrepreneurial action characteristics will have direct implications for
practitioners.

Finally, the research initiative proposed here has clear implications for policy
related to entrepreneurship. Most directly, future research ﬁndings will have impli-
cations the development entrepreneurship education programs. Identifying action
characteristics that are positively related to desirable entrepreneurial outcomes can
inform education design and implementation such that it is appropriated aligned
with teaching and training students to be proﬁcient in the identiﬁed actions.

Measuring and Understanding
the Psychological Effects of Entrepreneurial
Intentions: Multigroup Analysis
Jo~ao J. Ferreira, Cristina I. Fernandes, and Ma´rio L. Raposo
Abstract This study aims to measure and understand the psychological effects of
entrepreneurial intentions among university students from two countries (Portugal
and Spain).
Following a review of the literature, there is a lack of studies incorporating an
integrative model that deploys self-efﬁcacy, risk-taking propensity and proactive
personality as psychological effects on entrepreneurial intentions. Here, we seek to
meet this gap through proposing and developing an integrative psychological model
about the formation of entrepreneurial intentions, including all these variables as
the main preceding factors to entrepreneurial initiatives and their inﬂuence on
entrepreneurial intentions. Taking a sample of 293 university students from both
countries, we apply multigroup analysis to empirically test the inﬂuence these hold
over the preferences expressed in terms of becoming an entrepreneur.
Our results reveal differences between these two countries regarding entrepre-
neurial intentions. In terms of the motivations present for launching a business, the
higher these are, then the greater the preference for the option to work for third
parties. In addition, and in terms of the perceived ease of launching a company
variable, the higher this rises, the lower the level of preference for working for third
party entities. Furthermore, the greater the level of perception in terms of the social
value of entrepreneurship, the greater the preference in favour of becoming an
entrepreneur.

Introduction
Audretsch (2007) proposes entrepreneurship as vital to the success of contemporary
societies that are otherwise facing enormous economic and social challenges.
Furthermore, entrepreneurs stand out as the leading driver of economic develop-
ment as this is today understood. The majority of conceptions around this entre-
preneurial ﬁgure (Knight 1921; Schumpeter 1934; Kirzner 1973) emphasise the
role played in promoting the economy above and beyond the other, better under-
stood roles such as business manager or property owner.
From the 1970s onwards, many Western countries have shared the same expe-
rience: the larger companies established there are no long able to provide for net
increases in employment. This resulted in constantly high levels of unemployment
and/or the growing relative importance of small and new businesses as the means to
create new jobs (Aiginger and Tichy 1991; Davidsson et al. 1995). This sets out the
broad backdrop to the great current political interest in the small and medium sized
company sector and the generalised hopes and expectations that small and new
companies may resolve the problem of unemployment and low economic growth.
Souitaris et al. (2007) maintain that education for entrepreneurship constitutes a
source of entrepreneurial attitudes and implants in students the intention of becom-
ing future entrepreneurs. Samydevan et al. (2015) argue that education reﬂects one
of the fundamental factors contributing towards the attitudes of students in relation
to entrepreneurship with the quality of business education susceptible of driving
higher levels of business start-up intentions among students. Dyer (1994) suggests
that entrepreneurial courses and programs bestow conﬁdence and courage on their
participants and their entrepreneurial intents. As there is a strong correlation
between education for entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial intentions, many coun-
tries have correspondingly introduced education for entrepreneurship to raise the
prevailing levels of entrepreneurial intent with Ahmad (2013) identifying how
education for entrepreneurship may reduce unemployment among graduates.
However, this education for entrepreneurship needs embarking on at an age
earlier than that for beginning university and with analysis on how the psycholog-
ical and behavioural aspects might shape entrepreneurial intentions.
In past literature, some intention models have been developed and trying to
explain entrepreneurial intentions as a variable within larger psychological models:
behaviour theory (Ajzen 1991); self-efﬁcacy and social learning theory (Bandura
1997); economic-psychological model (Davidsson 1995). However, there is a lack
of studies applying an integrative model which employs self-efﬁcacy, risk-taking
propensity and proactive personality as psychological effects on entrepreneurial
intentions. Here, we seek to ﬁll this gap by developing an integrative psychological
model about the formation of entrepreneurial intentions, including all these vari-
ables as the main preceding factors to entrepreneurial initiative and correspondingly
evaluating their inﬂuence on entrepreneurial intentions.

Literature Review
Schumpeter (1934, 1939, 1942) defends how entrepreneurs represent the main
driving force behind advancing economic development. Indeed, they are capable
of coming up with the innovations that enable the return of proﬁts while assuming
the risks inherent to these “creations”. According to this author, development
equates to the introduction of new combinations of circular ﬂows into economic
life, thus entrepreneurs prove able to launch these innovative actions in such a
fashion as to cause cyclical discontinuities in the economy. These combinations,
when introduced by these new actors (the business owners), bring about new forms
of production, new products, new technologies, new forms of organisation, new
markets and new resources for their production processes and correspondingly
deﬁning economic development and the future of capitalism.
Entrepreneurship theory has advanced substantially over the last three decades
(Samydevan et al. 2015). The main reason derives from the central role that the
scientiﬁc community currently attributes to human capital and to the growth of
different regions in the world economy (Wennekers and Thurik 1999; Galindo and
Alvarez 2004). A large number of studies on the qualitative features of entrepre-
neurs have focused on the psychological characteristics and personality traits that
differentiate the successful entrepreneurs from their less successful peers in addi-
tion to business managers in comparison with the rest of the population (Borland
1975; Samydevan et al. 2015).
Many authors have sought to identify the existence of certain personality
characteristics that might be associated with entrepreneurial activities (McClelland
1961, 1985). Lumpkin and Erdogon (2004) studied and strongly backed the psy-
chological attributes not only in terms of the importance of levels of perception and
awareness but also as the theoretical foundation stone for predicting entrepreneurial
behaviours and potentials when adults. According to Morris (1998), the risk taking
propensity over entrepreneurial intentions refers to the extent to which individuals
differ in their willingness to accept new situations when these are unknown. Koh
(1996) afﬁrms that entrepreneurs are prudent managers of risk. Timmons (1999), in
turn, refers to the propensity of a person to assume risks under uncertain circum-
stances. Entrepreneurs therefore commonly get involved in risky behaviours and
seem more willing to run risks (Norton and Moore 2002).
The relationship between self-efﬁcacy and entrepreneurship is justiﬁed people
avoid careers and environments which they believe exceed their capacities (without
considering the beneﬁts that they might obtain), and undertake careers for which
they consider themselves able (Sa´nchez 2011). Correspondingly, Fig. 1 details our
conceptual model.

Methodology
3.1
Measuring Instruments
The instrument applied was the Sa´nchez (2010) Entrepreneurial Orientation Ques-
tionnaire (EOQ). The dimensions, measured by a Likert scale of 1–7 were the
following (Ferreira and Fernandes 2017): Internal Locus of Control (11 items),
Self-efﬁcacy (9 items), Proactiveness (10 items), Personal Attitude (5 items),
Perceived Control (6 items), Standard (3 items), Feasibility (9 items), Entrepre-
neurial Intention (9 items), Labor Intention (4 items), Motivations for Setting up a
Company (10 items), Important Resources for Setting up a Company (13 items),
Important Obstacles for Setting up a Company (10 items), Importance of Setting up
a Company (8 items), Social Value of Entrepreneurship (8 items) and Speciﬁc
Capacities to Becoming an Entrepreneur (6 items), Individualist (2 items), Collec-
tivist (5 items) and Mixed (3 items).

3.2
Methods
Firstly it was evaluated the validity of the constructs, correspondingly analysing the
reliability, the factorial validity, the convergent validity and the discriminant
validity. In this research, construct validity was assessed by: (1) composite reliabil-
ity (CR), (CR > 0.70); (2) factorial validity; (3) convergent validity (AVE > 0.50);
and (4) discriminant validity (Hair et al. 2010; Hulland 1999).
Following the validation of the instrument and within the objective of validating
the hypotheses incorporated into the conceptual model, we turned to structural
equation modeling (SEM), estimated through the partial least squares method
(PLS). The application of PLS-SEM as an alternative to SEM based on covariance
(CB-SEM) stemmed from the high number of indicators included in the study and
the limited size of the sample (n ¼ 293), with more robust results obtained through
PLS-SEM in such cases given fewer identiﬁcation problems with smaller scale
samples than those obtained through recourse to CB-SEM. Furthermore, another
factor advocating the utilisation of PLS-SEM emerged from the existence of
non-normal data and the assumptions of data distribution under CB-SEM
(Hair et al. 2010, 2012).
As there are no overall fair adjustment measures for models estimated through
PLS as in the covariance based structural equation methodologies, the evaluation of
the structural models estimated through PLS takes place by analysis of the R2
determined coefﬁcient values for the endogenous constructs and the value of the
Standardized Root Mean Residual (SRMR) (Hair et al. 2011; Hulland 1999). In
order to evaluate the constructs potentially driving multicollinearity, the variance
inﬂating factors (VIF) were subject to evaluation.
In estimating the structural models, for determining the t-statistics and the
respective statistical signiﬁcance, we deployed 1000 sample replicas.
Finally, we sought to analyse the differences in the parameters in relation to the
two countries included in the sample (Spain and Portugal). To this end, we made
recourse to multigroup analysis given that any differences might arise out of
non-observed heterogeneity, thus not susceptible to attributing to any one or more
pre-speciﬁed variables (Sarstedt et al. 2011). In order to determine the statistically
signiﬁcant differences between the path coefﬁcients for the Portugal and Spain
models, we applied Henseler’s approach (Sarstedt et al. 2011).
For all of these statistical calculations, we applied the SmartPLS software
version 3.0.

estimates returned for SEM. All of the constructs utilised report acceptable levels of
reliability (FC  0.709). Regarding their validity, the standardised factorial loads
were equal to or greater than 0.530, thus correspondingly attaining factorial valid-
ity, the AVE results were greater than or equal to 0.529 and with the squared roots
also always higher than the correlation returned between the respective construct
and the remainder and therefore conclusively conﬁrming both the convergent and
the discriminant validity.
4.1
Structural Equation Modeling
The VIF values were below or equal to 5.05 thus reporting the absence of
multicollinearity in the estimations made. The SEM based modeling returned an
acceptable level of adjustment given that the SMRM ¼ 0.062 and the R2 results
were 0.770 and 0.160 for the endogenous constructs Entrepreneurial Intention and
Labor Intention respectively.
Table 2 and Fig. 2 detail the results stemming from the estimated structural
model. This thus conveys how the Feasibility (β ¼ 0.45; p < 0.001), Personal
Attitude (β ¼ 0.25; p < 0.001) and Social Value of Entrepreneurship (β ¼ 0.14;
p < 0.001) constructs generate a statistically signiﬁcant impact on the construct
Entrepreneurial Intention in which the higher the score for the Feasibility, Personal
Attitude and Social Value of Entrepreneurship constructs, the higher the score of
the Entrepreneurial Intention construct. Regarding the Labor Intention construct,
the Feasibility (β ¼ 0.21; p ¼ 0.042), Important Obstacles for Setting up a
Company (β ¼ 0.24; p < 0.001), Pro-activeness (β ¼ 0.32; p ¼ 0.001) and
Speciﬁc Capacities to Becoming an Entrepreneur (β ¼ 0.29; p ¼ 0.003) all generate
a statistically signiﬁcant effect. In this case, the higher the scores for the Feasibility
and Pro-activeness constructs, the lower the score for the Labor Intention construct
and the higher the score for the Important Obstacles for Setting up a Company and
Speciﬁc Capacities to Becoming an Entrepreneur constructs, the higher the scores
for the Labor Intention construct.

Multigroup Analysis
Finally, multigroup analysis served to test for statistically signiﬁcant differences
between these two countries in relation to their respective standardized path
coefﬁcients. Table 3 (Entrepreneurship intentions) and Table 4 (Labour intentions)
summarise the analytical results.
In terms of entrepreneurial intensity (Table 3), in the Portuguese sample, the
constructs generating a statistically signiﬁcant positive impact on entrepreneurial
intention are the following: Feasibility (β ¼ 0.53; p < 0.001), Personal Attitude
(β ¼ 0.15; p ¼ 0.045), Social Value of Entrepreneurship (β ¼ 0.21; p < 0.001) and
Measuring and Understanding the Psychological Effects of Entrepreneurial. . .

Pro-activeness (β ¼ 0.19; p ¼ 0.009). As regards the Spanish student group, the
constructs with a statistically signiﬁcant positive impact on entrepreneurial inten-
tion are Feasibility (β ¼ 0.37; p < 0.001), Importance of Setting up a Company
(β ¼ 0.21; p ¼ 0.009), Perceived Control (β ¼ 0.16; p ¼ 0.034), Personal Attitude
(β ¼ 0.25; p ¼ 0.001), Social Value of Entrepreneurship (β ¼ 0.21; p < 0.001) and
Pro-activeness (β ¼ 0.20; p ¼ 0.005).
As regards labour intention (Table 4), in the Portuguese student sample, the
Pro-activeness (β ¼ 0.245; p ¼ 0.009) construct returns a statistically signiﬁcant
negative impact while in the Spanish students group Feasibility (β ¼ 0.15;
p < 0.001) returns a statistically signiﬁcant impact on labour intention.
Table 5 conveys the summary results for the comparison of the Path Coefﬁcients
estimated between Spain and Portugal. In terms of entrepreneurial intention, there
are statistically signiﬁcant differences between the Path Coefﬁcients for the con-
structs of Self-efﬁcacy and Social Value of Entrepreneurship, with these values
proving signiﬁcantly higher among Portuguese students. As regards labour inten-
tion, we may report that the Feasibility construct had a far higher statistically
signiﬁcant negative impact on the Spanish students than on their Portuguese
counterparts.

Final Considerations
The literature review posits that entrepreneurs display certain essential attributes or
psychological characteristics and that, in turn, these produce speciﬁc personality
traits (Samydevan et al. 2015). The need to achieve, a tolerance of ambiguity, the
assumption of risks and the locus of control were subject to analysis in relation to
entrepreneurial characteristics and furthermore identiﬁed as duly correlating with
being or wishing to be an entrepreneur.
This approach recognises, as suggested by Ferreira and Fernandes (2017), the
essential need to study the contextual variables, the personal and social factors that
affect business intentions in persons, especially in university students given the

position these institutions hold in the creation of knowledge and the necessity for
such knowledge to reach the market and be positioned in the service of society.
This study therefore chose to study the explanatory variables for entrepreneurial
intention based on the psychological traits, motivations and individual and collec-
tive values of university students. To this end, we selected a sample of students
attending Portuguese and Spanish universities in order to also evaluate the differ-
ences prevailing in these respective international ambiences.
The results, on the one hand, demonstrate the inﬂuence of the different explan-
atory variables used to predict and explain entrepreneurial intentions among uni-
versity students. On the other hand, this also reported the existence of statistically
signiﬁcant differences between Portuguese and Spanish students.
As regards the psychological variables, we may report signiﬁcant differences
between these two countries across the variables Locus of Internal Control, Self-
efﬁcacy, Proactiveness, Personal Attitude, Perceived Control and Viability. In all of
these cases, the Portuguese students return higher levels of results. For the different
motivations around embarking on business activities, we may report the existence
of signiﬁcant differences in the constructs applied and identifying how Portuguese
students return signiﬁcantly higher levels across all constructs with the exception of
Labor Intention, in which the Spanish students attain a higher value. In relation to
the individual values, we once again encountered statistically signiﬁcant differ-
ences between the constructs for Stimulation, Effort and Individualist and corre-
spondingly reporting that the Portuguese students obtained signiﬁcantly higher
rankings in these constructs.
Portuguese students express lower levels of preference over working for third
parties. In relation to the factors inﬂuencing preferences over becoming entrepre-
neurs, the Portuguese student sample reported a signiﬁcantly higher option over
becoming entrepreneurs. The main contributions of this paper stem from the results
of its empirical attempt to complement the existing, mainly conceptual, literature
on the role of psychological approaches in explaining entrepreneurial intentions.
These results may generate a signiﬁcant impact upon the knowledge about how
psychological theory contributes towards understanding entrepreneurial intentions.
This study has also demonstrated the feasibility of measuring and understanding the
psychological effects on entrepreneurial intention in university students and fur-
thermore able to take into account a number of other inﬂuences on the entrepre-
neurial intentions of these students within different national contexts.
Our research model might be further improved by eliminating some constructs
that proved to be non-signiﬁcant and a number of additional constructs could
certainly be introduced by wider application during further research. We would
propose future research develops a more coherent multidimensional construct for
entrepreneurial intention. We correspondingly suggest extending this methodology
to other samples (countries) in order to evaluate what are the most important
psychological dimensions explaining the respective entrepreneurial intentions as
well as analyse in a deeply way some potential differences in terms of culture
aspects.

Why Would You Ever Want to Become
An Academic Entrepreneur?
Jasmina Berbegal-Mirabent, Dolors Gil-Dome´nech, and Ine´s Alegre
Abstract In this chapter, we explore the underlying motivations of researchers that
lead to entrepreneurial activities in Academia. Existing literature in the speciﬁc
ﬁeld of academic entrepreneurship has mainly studied the infrastructures and
policies aimed at fostering spin-off and patent creation at the university level.
However, few studies have concentrated on the individual level. We posit that
researchers’ motivation is the critical cornerstone for entrepreneurship activities to
ﬂourish.
Our study, therefore, contributes to the previous literature by scrutinizing the
relationship between individual characteristics of the entrepreneur and intrinsic,
extrinsic and prosocial motivations on entrepreneurial outcomes that can take place
in the academic setting. Results indicate that extrinsic motivations relative to
rewards do shape researchers’ interest for entrepreneurship.

Introduction
In the last decades, entrepreneurship has become a fruitful ﬁeld of study. Fostered
by the economic crisis started in 2008, entrepreneurship interest has grown as it is
seen as a way to invigorate the economy, enhance innovation and create jobs.
Entrepreneurs, as the agents that identify and exploit new opportunities (Shane and
Venkataraman 2000) play a critical role in the active development of entrepreneur-
ial initiatives. Most research about entrepreneurs focuses on business entrepreneurs
although most recently, social entrepreneurs have received also a great deal of

attention (Mair and Noboa 2006). Still, entrepreneurs in certain areas such as
political entrepreneurs or academic entrepreneurs remain underrepresented.
Academic entrepreneurship takes place when researchers, professors or univer-
sity personnel engage in entrepreneurial behaviour. Traditionally, this behaviour
has been operationalized in the form of spin-offs. Nevertheless, entrepreneurial
behaviour in the academic arena embraces a wider range of activities like consul-
tancy, university-industry contracts, and patent licensing among others.
In line with the social interest on entrepreneurship, since the 2000s universities
have increasingly incorporated to their traditional two main missions, teaching and
research, a third one, that of knowledge transfer and innovation (Gunasekara 2006).
Universities try to have an entrepreneurial spirit by increasing their interaction with
industry, developing impactful R&D projects and creating spin-offs, among other
initiatives. Many factors determine the degree of achievement of this third mission.
Contextual factors like country speciﬁc policies, culture, university rules or struc-
ture, as well as individual factors shape the researcher’s willingness to engage in
entrepreneurial behaviour.
But in the same manner that not all universities have a favourable regulatory
environment to foster entrepreneurship, also not all researchers have the same
aspirations and willingness to embark in entrepreneurial activities. In this chapter
we want to explore the individual factors that play a role in researchers’ entrepre-
neurial behaviour. These factors include intrinsic motivations, extrinsic motivation,
prosocial motivations and the proﬁle of the researchers (career stage, previous
business experience, research area, etc.).
The objective of this chapter is therefore, to investigate which of the above
mentioned factors have a relevant impact on researchers’ entrepreneurial behav-
iour. Entrepreneurial behaviour can be operationalized in different ways but we
have chosen to concentrate on spin-off creation. Spin-offs are new ventures that are
dependent upon licensing or assignment of the university’s intellectual property for
initiation (Association of University Technology Managers in the US, AUTM).
Spin-offs are one of the most popular knowledge transfer mechanisms of universi-
ties and are frequently the result of product development, industry collaborations or
patent ﬁlling. In some sense, spin-offs are frequently the ﬁnal result of a long
process of innovation and entrepreneurial effort.
The stimulation of academic entrepreneurship has become a critical issue for
both universities and governments. The rise in the number of academic spin-offs,
especially in European countries (Mustar et al. 2006) seems to be accelerated by a
combination of circumstances. First, there is a social pressure to commercialise
research in order to generate a new revenue stream that helps foster regional
economic growth (Clarysse et al. 2007). Second, technology transfer activities
might help reduce the so-called ﬁnancial and knowledge gap (Wright et al. 2008).
Last, but not least, in the last years we have witnessed a rise in the number of
policies that aim at stimulating the creation and development of spin-offs at
universities. Likewise, institutional programs have been launched providing busi-
ness assistance and the access to resources and facilities at low costs (Jacob et al.
2003). The underlying rationale behind all these initiatives mirrors the willingness
34
J. Berbegal-Mirabent et al.

of European countries to boost the creation of proﬁtable high-tech ﬁrms (Dosi et al.
2006), comparable with those in the US.
Policies and institutional programs, though, need to be accompanied by the
willingness of university professors and researchers to engage in entrepreneurial
behaviour. To that end, this chapter explores which individual motivational factors
inﬂuence spin-off creation. It does so by ﬁrst, reviewing the concepts of intrinsic,
extrinsic and prosocial motivation. Then, by presenting the data and method of the
study and ﬁnally, presenting the main results and conclusions.

Motivational Factors that Shape the Academic
Entrepreneur
Although there is a bulk of studies focusing on the role of institutions as determi-
nants of academic entrepreneurship, there are only a few that consider the individ-
ual factors that underline entrepreneurial decisions among academics (Clarysse
et al. 2011). In order to better understand academic entrepreneurship, it is crucial
to look at the factors that lead scientists engage in this kind of activities (Jain et al.
2009). In this context, it is of utmost importance to contemplate not only individual
characteristics but also academic motivations to become an entrepreneur (Hayter
2015; Ryan 2014). Such motivations can be classiﬁed into three main categories:
intrinsic, extrinsic, and prosocial.
Intrinsic motivations are linked to the satisfaction that the individual experiences
as a result of the execution of a particular task. This implies that, from the
researchers’ perspective, the reward is not in the result obtained with the activity
but in the activity itself (Ryan and Deci 2000). In the university context,
researchers’ intrinsic motivations have been acknowledged as decisive (Lounsbury
et al. 2012). Academics are often more motivated by the stimulation of the work
itself than by the remuneration they will obtain. Examples of intrinsic motivation
are the capability to successfully accomplish the task, the independence perceived,
the increase of self-esteem experienced by performing the activity (Fullwood et al.
2013) and the sense of control and pleasure due to the congeniality of colleagues
and the work setting, which favours undertaking a stimulating work and broadening
the knowledge (Bellamy et al. 2003), or the discovery of new opportunities for
future research (Baldini et al. 2007). All these non-monetary beneﬁts commonly
referred in the literature as “a high taste for science” (Agarwal and Ohyama 2013)
constitute the intrinsic motivations.
On the other hand, extrinsic motivations refer to performing an activity because
of its instrumental value. Therefore, extrinsic motivations comprise the external
incentives, which can be professional or personal, that researchers perceive in order
to accomplish their tasks. These incentives can be in the form of monetary com-
pensations (Ryan and Deci 2000) or research support or access to new infrastruc-
tures, among others. In this setting it is worth noting that some universities also link

researchers’ participation in entrepreneurial activities to their promotion. More-
over, in general terms researchers highly appreciate the reputation and prestige
derived from academic entrepreneurship, as it increases their visibility and market
value (Franco and Haase 2015; Welsh et al. 2016). All these aspects can translate in
obtaining additional funds for new research and increase the researchers’ likelihood
to access grants for future projects (Baldini et al. 2007). Based on the aforemen-
tioned considerations, we conclude that external motivations act as an important
driver of academic entrepreneurship.
Another determinant that might shape academics’ interest for entrepreneurial
activities that should not be obviated is prosocial motivation. This sort of motiva-
tion embraces the desire to look for and nourish others’ well-being. In this sense,
individuals are guided by prosocial motivations when their actions pursue others’
beneﬁts, being their objective “distinct from altruism and independent of self-
interested motivations” (Grant and Berg 2012, p. 1). In this context, Batson et al.
(2008) assert that individuals help others for four main reasons: (1) egoism—
“beneﬁting another as a means to beneﬁt oneself”—, (2) altruism—“beneﬁting
another as an ultimate goal”—, (3) collectivism—“beneﬁting another to beneﬁt a
group”—, and (4) principlism—“beneﬁting another to uphold a moral principle”—.
According to these authors, prosocial motivations can be formed by any combina-
tion of these four different ultimate goals.

Data and Method
3.1
Data and Measures
The dependent variable is the natural count of the number of spin-offs created by
the researcher in the last 5 years (2010–2014). Data come from a survey that was
intentionally designed for this study. The structure was as follows. In the ﬁrst
section respondents were asked about their background and socio-demographic
aspects. Sample questions include years in academia, previous experience in the
business sector, the research area, the contract type and the highest level of studies
reached. Next, we investigated their level of involvement in entrepreneurial activ-
ities, namely, participation in university-industry R&D contracts, patents granted
and spin-offs created. Speciﬁcally, we asked for the total amount of the aforemen-
tioned outputs for the past 5 years (period 2010–2104). We also asked respondents
if they usually take advantage of the services offered by the technology transfer
ofﬁce (TTO).
In the third section, a list of 19 items was included (see Table 1). Given the
limited number of studies analysing the motivations behind engaging in academic
entrepreneurship, the items were adapted from the questionnaires developed by
Fullwood et al. (2013) and Chong et al. (2014), both focused in knowledge sharing
and technology transfer activities. Based on the literature review, these items were
36
J. Berbegal-Mirabent et al.

grouped into 3 dimensions and aimed at capturing researchers’ motivations (intrin-
sic, extrinsic and prosocial) with regard conducting entrepreneurial activities. All
items were presented as statements to which respondents should indicated their
agreement/disagreement on a ﬁve-point Likert-type scale (from 1 ¼ strongly dis-
agree, to 5 ¼ strongly agree). Items in the scales were originally in English. A back
translation process ensured the quality of the measurements (Brislin et al. 1973).
In order to avoid misinterpretations and ensure that questions were unequivo-
cally formulated, a panel of three experts in the ﬁeld of entrepreneurship double-
checked the questionnaire. Once ready, the survey was sent by email to all faculty
members working at Universitat Polite`cnica de Catalunya. 508 surveys were
collected, 292 of them fully completed. Table 2 shows the characteristics of the
292 respondents.

Spinning-off is an activity that needs coaching, an appropriate assessment and
the stimulation of an entrepreneurial spirit. In our approach, we include a dummy
variable (TTO use) to control for those researchers that asked the TTO for assis-
tance. As shown in Table 3, half of the respondents used these services.
We also differentiate by contract type. In the Spanish public university sector,
internal promotion policies are strictly conditioned to an accreditation system
where governmental agencies play a key role. In this process an external panel
evaluates the credentials merits of the candidate. A positive evaluation makes the
applicant valid for potential promotion.
According to the current regulation, participation in technology transfer activi-
ties—such as creating a venture—has a small impact in this evaluation process.
Speciﬁcally, its weight in the overall evaluation ranges between 2% and 12%
(based on the research ﬁeld). This percentage is very low compared to the weight
given to scientiﬁc publications (between 26% and 35%). Given these differences,
we argue that for young academics—usually with a ﬁxed-term contract—to carve
out an academic career is a long-distance race conditioned, to a great extent, to
their capacity to publish their research. To the contrary, full professors—who enjoy
the beneﬁts of a permanent contract—have no exogenous pressure for publishing
and therefore, may have the time and motivation to engage in entrepreneurial
activities.
Previous experience in business and research might also play a relevant role. We
use three variables to account for this effect. First, accumulated experience in the
business sector might also lead to the creation of knowledge spill overs that are

expected to boost the creation of new spin-offs. One way to account for this
experience is including a dummy variable that indicates whether the research has
previous experience in the business sector or not (before joining academia).
Second, university spin-offs are the natural result of the valorisation of research
outcomes. There are two main paths leading to spin-off creation. The ﬁrst one
entails a preliminary phase, where the invention is protected with a patent. This step
allows safeguarding the rights and potential beneﬁts derived from the invention
(Powers and McDougall 2005). Once the patent is granted researchers start working
on the commercialization process. They do so through the establishment of a new
venture. Although this pathway might seem attractive due to cost reductions
(Clarysse et al. 2007), there is no empirical evidence that the invention will succeed
in the marketplace. Contrarily, the alternative mechanism for creating a spin-off is
the one where there is no need to neither disclose the technology nor apply for a
patent. This latter approach is riskier than the former one, particularly in high-tech
sectors. Therefore, university spin-offs tend to follow the ﬁrst approach
(Di Gregorio and Shane 2003). Moreover, some studies indicate that patents are
predictive of ﬁrm performance, that is, university patenting stimulates future patent
activity and consequently the creation of more spin-offs (Mowery et al. 2002; Roig-
Tierno et al. 2017). Given all these considerations, we include as an explanatory
variable the number of patents granted (past 5 years).
Similarly, university-industry partnerships in the form of research contracts are
another valuable experience that might conduce to new venture creation.
Researchers need the industry’s knowledge of the market to come up with new,
applicable, and successful technology developments (Ribeiro-Soriano and Urbano
2010). Furthermore, through R&D contracts they gain additional funding support,
which is fundamental to safeguarding the viability of future research endeavours
(Baba et al. 2009; Lai 2011). Accordingly, we include a variable that accounts for
these collaborative agreements.

3.2
Method
The empirical analysis consists of a two-step process. First, we performed a principal
component analysis to group the items from the questionnaire that refer to motiva-
tions. Although a priori, questions seem to be easily grouped into three dimensions
(intrinsic, extrinsic and prosocial motivations), we decided to run a factor analysis in
order to ﬁrst eliminate any potential multicollinearity problems and, second, to adjust
the model to the sample and extract the maximum variance from the data.
A principal component factor analysis was performed. Kaise-Meyer-Olkin value
tests the adequacy of the factor analysis methodology as a sampling methodology
(KLM value ¼ 0.898 at a signiﬁcant of >0.000). Retaining only those factors whose
eigenvalues exceed a speciﬁed value (>1), the exploratory factor analysis yielded
four factors explaining 65.56% of the variance. Next, we analysed the items
included in each factor. We used an orthogonal rotation method (varimax) which
guarantees that factors are not correlated, and thus, problems of multicollinearity
are avoided. Results are presented in Table 4.
Following our initial intuition, items were grouped as expected. The only
exception is for the extrinsic motivations. This dimension was divided into two,
distinguishing between promotion incentives (items from EM1 to EM3) and repu-
tation, rewards and access to resources (items from EM4 to EM5). To examine the

unidimensionality of the multi-item factors, we ran four exploratory factor analyses
one for each of the factors. In all cases the analyses extracted only one factor,
corroborating that our approach was sound.
In the second stage, we explored the explanatory power of the different dimensions
and variables outlined above when regressed against the number of spin-offs. Due to the
highly skewed distribution of the dependent variable (Greene 2008) we use a negative
binomial regression technique. Three models were run to ensure the robustness of the
results. First, we only introduced the control variables (use of TTO and contract type).
In the second model we added the variables that refer to previous business and research
experience (business experience, patents and R&D contracts). The third model is the
full model, which includes the four motivational factors identiﬁed in the previous step.

Results and Discussion
Results are displayed in Table 5. As it can be shown, intrinsic motivations have no
effect on the output. This result indicates that main drivers for starting-up a business
does not refer to the joy of creating something new or learning from a new

experience. Based on this rationale, it seems that academics are not surrounded by
an entrepreneurial atmosphere. In this respect, if the university aims at instilling
entrepreneurship as a way of being, soft structures, informal relationships and
networks need to be developed.
Similarly, promotion incentives (external motivations) do not seem to play a role
in explaining spin-off creation. A potential reasoning for this is easily found in the
accreditation system Spanish universities follow. In order to remain in academia,
scholars are forced to concentrate on producing the outputs regarded as most
valuable in these assessment frameworks (i.e., publications). Future research should
examine for the existence of potential different motivational schemes between
permanent and non-permanent faculty.
On the contrary, extrinsic motivations in the form of rewards and reputation
perceived by the researcher as a result of his/her involvement in entrepreneurial
activities do have a positive and signiﬁcant effect on spin-off creation. This result is
interesting as it suggests that an important motivator relates to the access to new
sources of funding, the possibility to gain external reputation and the prospects to
enhance career development—in terms of keeping researcher’s visibility and mar-
ket value high—. In this respect, it is worth mentioning that average salary for
professors is rather low compared to the one in industry. In addition, in Spanish
public universities, professorship contracts tend to have some incompatibilities
with other type of jobs which impedes professors having additional jobs or being
involved in other revenue-generating activities not related to universities. All these
arguments reinforce the importance of rewards. The creation of spin-offs is one of
the few options that professors have to increase their income without generating any
incompatibility with their current jobs.
Lastly and contrary to expected, prosocial motivations are found to have a
negative and signiﬁcant effect in new venture creation. Future studies should
further investigate this relationship in order to obtain additional insights that help
explain this result.
As for the remaining variables included in the model, we observe that the use of
the TTO is paramount. This results reinforces the existing literature that argues that
TTOs appear as intermediary organizations between researchers and industry
(Villani et al. 2017) with a range of activities to accelerate the commercial exploi-
tation of research outputs (Weckowska 2015).
Previous linkages with the industry are also exhibiting a positive and statistically
signiﬁcant effect in spin-offs. This is not surprising as previous links with the
industry probably facilitate the contacts, experience and the necessary know-how
that hasten spin-off creation and development.

Concluding Remarks
Motivations do shape academics’ intention to become entrepreneurs. Research on
this topic has usually taken a macro-meso perspective, studying which institutional
characteristics and policies foster entrepreneurial behaviour. Although contextual
42
J. Berbegal-Mirabent et al.

factors are extremely relevant in facilitating innovation, individual motivations
play a critical role and have been largely unexplored in the academic setting. We
respond to this call for new insights by conducting a study at the individual level of
the researcher. Through a questionnaire, we have explored the underlying motiva-
tions that affect researchers’ engagement in spin-off creation.
Our results indicate that, for spin-off development, extrinsic motivations relative
to rewards inﬂuence researchers’ interest for entrepreneurship. Prosocial motiva-
tions also play a role, although in the opposite direction from the one initially
expected. Other factors that help explain why some academics decide to embark in
entrepreneurial activities include previous research experience and the use of
facilitating structures such as TTOs. In terms of policy making our ﬁndings indicate
that the current incentive system seems to discourage academics from becoming
entrepreneurs. There is also a lack of an entrepreneurial culture. Academics should
be encouraged to provide new ideas, explore new ways of doing things, and face
new roles and challenges.
Although we believe that this study provides important and useful insights to the
existing research in academic entrepreneurship, it is important to note that there are
some limitations that constitute new research avenues for future studies. First, this
study uses data from one university located in Spain. Given the particular charac-
teristics of the university under study, it would be recommended for the present
research to be extended to other universities, countries and cultures to be conﬁdent
about the generalizability of results. Second, further research might investigate the
use of other dependent variables beyond spin-off creation. The challenge here relies
on how to best capture the output resulting from entrepreneurial initiatives, as in
many instances, these activities are difﬁcult to quantify. Third, other variables not
included in the model might help explain spin-off creation. In the empirical
application we did consider age, gender and research area as explanatory variables.
However, their inclusion in the model did not modify nor improve the results;
therefore, we dropped them out. The use of other explanatory variables should also
be explored.

The Relation Between Entrepreneurial
Behaviour and Entrepreneurship Rates Over
Time: An Approach Using Qualitative
Comparative Analysis
Paulo Ferreira and Andreia Dionı´sio
Abstract In recent years, entrepreneurship has been seen as one of the keys to a
country’s economic growth and development. From one perspective, this relation-
ship exists because entrepreneurship can be explained as an economic dynamic
from Schumpeter’s creative destruction paradigm. This dynamic can be explained
by both macroeconomic and behavioural factors. For instance, some macroeco-
nomic variables, like investments in human capital, have inﬂuence in entrepreneur-
ship (and not only infrastructure investments). According to the Global
Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM), entrepreneurial behaviours and attitudes are
also important in determining entrepreneurship rates. Among these, the GEM
identiﬁes self-perceptions (perceived opportunities, perceived capabilities, fear of
failure and entrepreneurial intention), motivations and expectations (high job
creation). In this chapter, we propose to use qualitative comparative analysis to
verify which of these entrepreneurial behaviours, perceptions and attitudes (condi-
tions) are more important for higher entrepreneurship rates. Using longitudinal
information from GEM, we investigate the inﬂuence of those conditions over
time. The combination of a large sample with the methodology we use are innova-
tive features of this chapter. Our main results, using fuzzy-set qualitative compar-
ative analysis, point that most important conditions are entrepreneurial intentions,
and good perceptions about opportunities and one’s own capabilities.

Introduction
Although the concept of entrepreneurship was identiﬁed by classical economists, in
recent years both society and the academic community have focused more attention
on this topic. In some regards, entrepreneurship could be a way to solve unemploy-
ment (good for both citizens and politicians), but is necessary to study the phenom-
enon itself to improve in our understanding of ways to support it.
Irrespective of the motivations for paying more attention to entrepreneurial
activity, it is relevant to study because it can inﬂuence a country’s economic growth
(see, for example, Valliere and Peterson 2009). However, it remains important to
analyse not only the outcomes of entrepreneurship but also the inputs that lead to
entrepreneurial activity.
Using the Total Entrepreneurial Activity rate (TEA) proposed by the Global
Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM), in this chapter, we intend to analyse how some
behavioural variables have an effect on entrepreneurship rates. We base our anal-
ysis on the indexes proposed by GEM, which includes perceptions about opportu-
nities and capabilities, entrepreneurial intentions, fear of failure, a motivation index
and the perception of entrepreneurship as a high status job.
As our objective is to determine the most important conditions for higher
entrepreneurship rates, we use a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis
(fsQCA) with our data. We analyse how those conditions affect entrepreneurship
in the period between 2010 and 2016. Our main results point to the relevance of the
perception of capabilities and opportunities as well as the personal entrepreneurship
intention. The other variables have mixed results, and some of these could be
related to the worldwide economic crisis.
The remainder of the chapter is organized as follows: Sect. 2 reviews the
theoretical background; Sect. 3 presents both data and methodology; Sect. 4
shows the results and Sect. 5 concludes.

Theoretical Background
Although often used in recent literature, the concept of entrepreneurship was
already used by classical economists. One of the ﬁrst authors writing about it was
probably Richard Cantillon (1755), who called an entrepreneur a person “willing to
buy at a certain price and to sell at an uncertain price”. Other classics like Adam
Smith (1776), who referred to entrepreneurs as economic actors transforming
demand in supply or Jean Baptiste Say (1816), who identiﬁes them as a person
owning a ﬁrm and creating value for an economy, also dealt with the subject.
Schumpeter (1934) linked the concept of entrepreneurship with innovation, recog-
nizing an entrepreneur as anyone who places any kind of new product, service or
process on the market.

P. Ferreira and A. Dionı´sio

Irrespective of the different possible approaches, most studies about entrepre-
neurship focus on the process of identifying and developing opportunities (see,
Kirzner 1973; Shane and Venkataraman 2000; Shane 2003, among others), which
ends in the creation of new ﬁrms. Low and MacMillan (1988) and Gartner (1988)
are some of the pioneers in this area, and their deﬁnition is currently employed by
the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM), a worldwide study about the levels of
entrepreneurship. Started in 1999, GEM is compiled by a consortium of universities
and its most recent version has 2016 data (GEM 2017).
The conceptual framework behind the GEM report is based on three compo-
nents: individual attributes, social values and entrepreneurship indicators.
According to the report, the ﬁrst component reﬂects “perceptions about opportuni-
ties, capabilities to act entrepreneurially, entrepreneurial intentions and fear of
failure”, the second component “the society values entrepreneurial behaviour”
and the last component the “different forms of entrepreneurial activity along the
life cycle of a venture (nascent, new business, established business, share of high
ambitious ventures, discontinuation) and motivation for venturing (opportunity
vs. necessity based ventures)” (GEM 2015, p. 27). McClelland (1961) was one of
the ﬁrst to parallel the general behaviours of people in society with that of
entrepreneurs and the behaviours they exhibit in making decisions.
The main indicator of GEM is Total Early-stage Entrepreneurial Activity (TEA),
the share of individuals aged 18–64 who have created or managed a business in the
last three and a half years. TEA is calculated but complementary data is retrieved
from two surveys: the Adult Population Survey (APS) and the National Experts
Survey (NES). APS recovers information about individuals’ attributes, attitudes
and activities, while NES records experts’ opinions about entrepreneurship and
about countries’ conditions.
Our main objective is to study the relationships between behaviours and entre-
preneurship using APS variables. In particular, there are four individual attributes
of APS: (1) perception of opportunities; (2) perception of own capabilities to be a
successful entrepreneur; (3) entrepreneurial intentions; and (4) fear of failure. The
ﬁrst three conditions are entrepreneurship enhancers, while the fear of failure has
the opposite effect on entrepreneurship. Studies such as those by Shane (2003),
Arenius and Minniti (2005), Koellinger et al. (2007), Caliendo et al. (2009) and
Patel and Thathcer (2012) recognize these inﬂuences.
Besides individual attitudes and attributes, APS also analyses social values, with
three different variables: (1) if entrepreneurship is a desirable career choice; (2) if it
is recognized as having a high level of status and respect; (3) if media attention
promotes entrepreneurship. Studies such as Hoang and Antoncic (2003) or Kwon
and Arenius (2010) identify the importance of these social values also as entrepre-
neurship enhancers. Due to data availability, which will be explained in the next
section, in this chapter only the ﬁrst question is used.
Since 2010, the GEM report has also included a motivational index, showing the
percentage of TEA that is driven by an opportunity motive, divided by the percent-
age driven by a necessity motive. This is an important index, because it links the
difference between these two ways to promote entrepreneurship in a country.

Normally, more developed countries have a higher share of opportunity entrepre-
neurs (see, for example, Wong et al. 2005 or Valliere and Peterson 2009). More-
over, according to Acs et al. (2008), opportunity entrepreneurship has a positive
impact on economic development, while necessity entrepreneurship has no impact.
As the previously identiﬁed factors inﬂuence people’s choices, it is important to
know which are more important for higher entrepreneurship rates. This could be
interesting, for example, for political decision-makers deciding which factors they
should pay more attention to. This chapter is therefore devoted to studying the most
important conditions for higher entrepreneurship levels, and the outcome. The
outcome and conditions are presented in Table 1. TEA is the outcome and the
remaining variables the conditions.
The model we try to explain is TEA ¼ f(POPP, PCAP, FFR, EINT, MOTIV,
HJOB), f(.) meaning a function of. Furthermore, we propose to analyse if the
importance of the conditions has changed over time. We use data from 2010 to
2016, as will be explained in more detail in the next section.
For a wider review of studies about entrepreneurship, which is not possible in
this chapter due to space constraints, please read, for example, the work by
Audretsch (2002) or Acs and Audretsch (2010).
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: in Sect. 3 we explain the data
and methodology used (fsQCA); Sect. 4 presents the results and Sect. 5 concludes.

Data and Methodology
Retrieving data from different GEM reports, from 2010 to 2016, our objective is to
analyse if the main conditions to have higher entrepreneurship rates changed over
time. We start our analysis in 2010 because it is the ﬁrst year where the motivation
index is calculated. This index gives us a ratio between opportunity and necessity
entrepreneurship, which is a relevant measure to explain entrepreneurship rates. So
we use a total of 7 years (from 2010 to 2016), making a separate analysis for each
year. Because the countries in GEM reports vary over the years, the sample does not
have the same number: we have 59 countries in 2010, 55 in 2011, 67 in 2012, 70 in
2013 and 2014, 60 in 2015 and 65 in the last year of analysis. The number of
observations is not a problem, because the methodology used ﬁts well even in the
case of small or medium sized samples (see, for example, Vis 2012).
As previously indicated, there are also two other variables that could be used in
the analysis: entrepreneurship as a good career choice and as giving high status.
However, over the years, there are several missing values. In order to use the
maximum possible number of observations, we excluded these variables. However,
they correspond to social values, so are not crucial in this analysis as we focus on
behavioural conditions.
We chose to apply a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA), aiming
to capture the most important patterns (conditions) which cause a given outcome
(Wagemann and Schneider 2010). According to Vis (2012), “fsQCA ﬁts the causes-
of-effects approach most because this approach aims to reveal the minimal (com-
binations of) conditions bringing about a particular outcome in speciﬁc cases.”
Generally, qualitative comparative analysis was created by Ragin (1987) and
over time has undergone several developments. The use of fuzzy sets allows us to
work with continuous data, but qualitative comparative analysis could also be
used with binary variables (crisp-set qualitative comparative analysis) or with
multiple value data (Ragin 2008). It was originally used in social sciences such as
Sociology, but now has several applications related to economics and manage-
ment. See, for example, Vis et al. (2007), which studies countries’ economic
performance, Schneider et al. (2010), analysing export performance or Ferreira
and Dionı´sio (2016a, b, c), studying respectively economic growth, innovation
and entrepreneurship.
With this methodology, two kinds of conditions can be found. Firstly, it detects
necessary conditions, those which have to be identiﬁed for a given outcome. The
necessary conditions are measured by a consistency level, created by Ragin (2006),
showing the degree to which each case corresponds to a given solution. The
consistency measure used here penalizes severe inconsistencies. The truth table
algorithm is used to identify sufﬁcient conditions (Ragin 2008).
fsQCA is not used with the original variables. It needs a calibration process
being necessary, which according to Ragin (2000), implies “substantive and theo-
retical knowledge relevant to set membership”. With this process, the outcome and
all the conditions are rescaled between 0 and 1, and could be a fully in set (when
condition/outcome take the value of 1), fully out set (the value of 0) or at a
The Relation Between Entrepreneurial Behaviour and Entrepreneurship Rates. . .
51

crossover point (0.5). The calibration method is based on the percentile approach,
which is appropriate in the case of continuous data (Ragin 2008). The “fully in” is
deﬁned as the 95th percentile, the “fully out” as the 5th percentile and the “neither
in nor out” point is deﬁned by the median. The results are calculated using the
fs/QCA software package (2.5).
The literature contains some applications of qualitative comparative analysis to
entrepreneurship. Hornaday (1992) uses it to ﬁnd a deﬁnition for entrepreneurship.
More recently, other studies have applied these methodologies: Khefacha and
Belkacem (2015) study how psychological factors inﬂuence individual intentions
among Tunisian entrepreneurs; Mu~noz and Kibler (2016) work on the conﬁdence of
social entrepreneurs in the UK; Ferreira and Dionı´sio (2016b), Coduras et al. (2016)
and Velilla and Ortega (2017) study the most important conditions to attain higher
entrepreneurship levels. The approach in this chapter is similar, but in this case we
adopted a longitudinal approach.

Results
As mentioned, the main goal of this research is to evaluate the relationship between
entrepreneurial behaviour and growing entrepreneurship rates. The basic questions
motivating this study are: (1) are entrepreneurial behaviours important conditions
inﬂuencing entrepreneurship rates? and (2) if so which ones?
Our ﬁrst step is evaluation of the necessary conditions. The results are presented
in Table 2, and just as Fiss (2011), we will focus on results whose level of
consistency is above 0.8.

It is interesting to note that some conditions remain important as necessary over
time, namely perceived capabilities (pcap) and entrepreneurship intentions (eint).
The results make sense and are somewhat expected. But the absence of motivation
is a necessary condition in 2010 and 2011, which may make interpretation difﬁcult.
However, the existence of economic difﬁculties makes entrepreneurship rates
increase due to necessity, rather than based on opportunity (see, for example,
Fritsch 2013 or Simo´n-Moya et al. 2014, among others). In that period, the need
to create a job and acquire an extra source of income was probably an important
motor of entrepreneurship. Perceived opportunities are considered relevant for most
of the period under analysis, the remaining years being very close to the minimum
consistency coefﬁcient.
These results are complemented by the evidence of absence of high status for
successful entrepreneurs (~hjob) in 2010 and the absence of fear of failure (~ffr) in
2011. The absence of the perception that entrepreneurship could have high status,
being relevant just in the ﬁrst year of the sample, could mean that in a crisis period
need is more important than status. This may be closely related to the irrelevance of
failure. In fact, if someone needs to be an entrepreneur to solve job issues and have
an important source of income, the opportunity cost would be very low. Regarding
the fear of failure, this serves as a disabler of entrepreneurship. In fact, it only has a
consistency value coherent with necessary conditions for 1 year. However, most of
the time, it has a value near 0.8, which should be noted.
So it is possible to conclude that besides entrepreneurial intentions (which
certainly inﬂuence the decision to create a ﬁrm), important behavioural perceptions
are necessary conditions for people to start business activities.
We continue with the analysis of sufﬁcient conditions, following the procedure
proposed by Ragin and Fiss (2008) which shows the intermediate solution and
identiﬁes core conditions (larger symbols) and peripheral conditions (smaller
symbols). Tables 3 and 4 show the results for sufﬁcient conditions for higher
outcomes in total entrepreneurship activity.
The results for sufﬁcient conditions reveal that the existence of entrepreneurship
intentions is (by itself) a sufﬁcient condition for higher TEA. Furthermore, and
except in the last year of analysis, it is always the most important sufﬁcient
condition itself (it is the combination with highest unique coverage).
The evolution of sufﬁcient conditions over time is quite interesting. Firstly, the
increase of solutions in the period under study is noted. This could be explained by
the entrepreneurship phenomenon becoming more complex in the last years of the
sample. Perhaps some other factors not used in this study (for example, economic
factors) could explain this complexity.
Secondly, the motivation index appears for the ﬁrst time in 2012 (but just
peripherally), while in 2016 it becomes a core condition. Although alone it is not
a relevant condition, when combined with other variables, it can be important for
personal entrepreneurial decisions.
Another interesting feature is the major importance of the absence of fear of
failure, motivation and high status of successful entrepreneurs in recent years.
These results may be related to the positive cycle in most economies after the

sub-prime crisis. Indeed, when the strength behind entrepreneurship lies not only in
necessity, it becomes important to have some conditions in terms of behaviour. In
this context, status and motivation are important conditions for investment in
entrepreneurship. At the same time, and probably because of the level of invest-
ment, it is very important not to be afraid of failure.
Is also important to refer to the high level of overall coverage for the 7 years
under study, in which the previous solutions show raw coverage and consistency
above 0.79. Regarding overall consistency, the last year under analysis has the
lowest value (probably due to some complexity), while the others show robust
values.

Some Conclusions
The main goal of this study is to investigate the importance of perceptions and
behavioural attitudes in entrepreneurship activity. Economic, social, political and
technological conditions are naturally extremely important, and those are analysed
in several studies. But human behaviour: the fear of failure, motivations, intentions,
perceived opportunities, status; could represent signiﬁcant conditions for acceler-
ating or slowing down entrepreneurial initiatives. In this context, we used data from
the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM). In the GEM database we ﬁnd infor-
mation about national contexts, entrepreneurial behaviours and attitudes. Among
these entrepreneurial behaviours and attitudes, the GEM identiﬁes self-perceptions
(perceived opportunities, perceived capabilities, fear of failure and entrepreneurial
intention), motivations, expectations (about high job creation) and societal values
(social status and career choice).
We carry out a longitudinal study, from 2010 to 2016, using fsQCA as the main
tool to analyse the necessary and sufﬁcient conditions to achieve higher rates of
entrepreneurship. With this research work we show it is necessary to have entre-
preneurial intentions, and good perceptions about opportunities and one’s own
capabilities (self-conﬁdence). In terms of sufﬁciency, the tendency is not so clear,
although the necessary conditions mentioned above are also important in sufﬁcient
conditions.
The motivation index was expected to have more importance in both types of
condition, such as the perception of entrepreneurship as a high status job. However,
those perceptions and behaviours did not show such relevance in our results. This
may be related to the different types of entrepreneurship in terms of opportunity/
necessity. Entrepreneurship through need could have a higher weight (because of
the countries under study) and so these perceptions and behaviours do not have a
major effect on the decision to create a ﬁrm. Future research could split the sample
according to countries’ economic development. This could reveal the real differ-
ence in perceptions and attitudes in the phenomenon of ﬁrm creation.
Our results are interesting, but limited to the available data. The fact that we
have a time horizon of only 7 years could be seen as not enough to a deep analysis

for entrepreneurship motivations. Although, the use of a large sample of countries,
allows us to have broader conclusions. The inclusion in the future of more condi-
tions, like macroeconomic variables, could allow us to have deeper ﬁndings.

Entrepreneurship Under Risk
and Uncertainty: A Review
of the Experimental Evidence
Konstantinos Georgalos
Abstract A considerable amount of research has been devoted in an effort to
identify the behavioural traits that distinguish entrepreneurs from other people. A
strand of the literature investigates the attitudes that entrepreneurs exhibit towards
uncertainty, either objective (risk) or subjective (ambiguity). Indeed, the standard
theory predicts that people, who are involved in entrepreneurial activities, tend to
have distinct risk and ambiguity attitudes compared to those who engage in salary-
paid employment. Nevertheless, the empirical evidence on this topic, based on ﬁeld
data, is mixed. Recently, methods from the experimental economics literature have
been employed in order to shred light to this issue. This chapter provides an
extensive review of the literature that experimentally studies the correlation
between uncertainty attitudes and entrepreneurial decision making. The chapter
concludes with a discussion of potential paths for further research.

Introduction
Deciding to engage to entrepreneurial activities, is undoubtedly a decision to be
made in an environment which is characterised by uncertainty. Examples of this
kind of uncertainty include returns of investment that will be realised in the future,
payoffs that are highly volatile, hi-tech investments which require excessive
up-front costs when the probability of success is quite small, or political turmoil
to name but a few. This uncertainty may be either objective, where the chances of
future events are determined by a well-deﬁned probability distribution (risk), or
subjective, where there is a lack of similar probability distribution (ambiguity).
Consequently, one would expect that entrepreneurs tend to differ in both the way
they perceive uncertainty, as well in their attitudes towards uncertainty, compared
to individuals that are not involved into entrepreneurial activities. Indeed, the

theoretical literature has established this correlation as early as Cantillon (1755),
topic which was later revived in Knight (1921), work that inspired most of the
contemporary literature of choice under uncertainty. More recently, Kirzner (1973)
and Kihlstrom and Laffont (1979) established the workhorse model of entrepre-
neurial decision making under uncertainty. As Holm et al. (2013) highlight, “Given
the nature of entrepreneurial action, most theories of entrepreneurship and entre-
preneurial decision making emphasize uncertainty as a conceptual cornerstone”.
The theoretical prediction is straight-forward: there is a strong correlation between
the degree of risk aversion and entrepreneurial choice. The less risk averse an agent
is, the more probable she is to get involved into entrepreneurial activities.
Early studies that aimed to obtain empirical evidence on this relationship, were
exclusively based on surveys [For a recent literature of the review of survey-based
studies, see Asterbo et al. (2014); for further references see Holm et al. (2013)],
using non-experimental measures to elicit risk preferences. The majority of these
studies tends to identify the intuitive pattern. Recently, entrepreneurial research has
started exploring methods from the experimental economic literature, applying
incentivised, controlled tasks in an effort to obtain more robust results. Neverthe-
less, Koudstaal et al. (2016) note that, “all studies using experimental measures of
risk aversion ﬁnd no differences between entrepreneurs and the control group,
whereas most of the other studies do ﬁnd differences supporting the common
wisdom that entrepreneurs are less risk averse”. This failure to reconcile the
survey-based evidence with that generated by experiments, calls for a more careful
review of the experimental literature on this topic.
This chapter aims to provide a thorough review of the up to today experimental
literature that aims to investigate whether entrepreneurs perceive uncertainty in a
different way, compared to sub-samples of the general population. To this end,
several researchers have investigated various aspects of preferences, such as risk
preferences, ambiguity preferences or time preferences that are able to inﬂuence
behaviour and more particularly entrepreneurial behaviour. Kraus et al. (2016)
provide a very detailed review on the experimental methods that have been applied
in entrepreneurship research in general. Nevertheless, as the objective of that article
had a broader scope, some key studies on this topic have been omitted, fact that
impeded the authors to provide a spherical overview of the correlation between
entrepreneurship and uncertainty. This is a gap that the present chapter aspires to
bridge. Our scope is to review all the studies that use controlled, monetary
incentivised, experimental methods to explore potential differences that character-
ise a population of entrepreneurs, when this sub-sample is compared to a control
group (either students, employees or general, non-entrepreneurship related sub-
jects). The list of published articles that we could identify and satisfy the above
criteria consists of nine studies overall, which are reported in Table 1. All of these
studies account for differences regarding a speciﬁed measure of risk aversion, while
only three articles include some tasks with subjective risk (ambiguity). For each of
the studies, we present the experimental design along with the main results, in an
effort to organise the literature on the topic, as well as to identify topics that have
not been investigated yet. Table 2 provides a summary of the experimental design

used to undergo the statistical analysis. The two last columns of the Table, sum-
marise whether and what kind of difference was observed in the each experiment.
The chapter is organised as follows. We ﬁrst review the experimental studies that
employ incentivised measures of preferences. We split the presentation in two
sections, one focusing on decision making under risk, and one focusing exclusively
on studies on ambiguity attitudes. As different approaches have been adopted in the
literature, we choose to review the papers in chronological order. We conclude, by
suggesting some potential future research paths.

Risk and Entrepreneurship: Experiment-Based Evidence
This experimental literature is as early as Elston et al. (2006) where the authors
collected data in order to examine stereotypical traits of entrepreneurs. To this end,
they conducted an artefactual ﬁeld experiment, in the sense of Harrison and List
(2004), recruiting 182 subjects. Out of all the participants, 23% were classiﬁed as
full-time entrepreneurs, 21% were classiﬁed as part-time entrepreneurs, in the sense
that they were engaged in both salary-based and business-related activities, and the
remaining of the sample acted as a control group given that they were categorised
either as salaried non-entrepreneurs, or not belonging to any of the above catego-
ries. In order to elicit risk preferences, a standard Holt and Laury (HL) multiple
price list was used (Holt and Laury 2002). The aggregate results indicate the
existence of subjects who are risk loving (switch before the point that risk neutral
subjects switch) with a general tendency of the experimental population to be risk
averse. Using an interval regression model they obtain estimates of the marginal
effect of the subject being an entrepreneur, controlling for demographic character-
istics. They ﬁnd that the full-time entrepreneurs are less risk averse compared to
both the part-time entrepreneurs and the control group. Nevertheless, they ﬁnd that
part-time entrepreneurs do not differ signiﬁcantly from the control group. Finally,
they cannot reject the hypothesis of risk neutrality of entrepreneurs over the income
interval applied in the experiment, providing supporting evidence to the theoretical
predictions.
Macko and Tyszka (2009) conducted an experiment to test self-conﬁdence, as
well as risk attitudes. The participants consisted of a group of students with no
intention to engage to any kind of entrepreneurial activities, a group of students that
have already attended a business course particularly designed for those that intend
to become future entrepreneurs and a third group of graduates that have already
become entrepreneurs. In this study, risk propensity, as the authors called it, was
measured with the aid of a single task that contained six chance-related situations.
The subject is asked to choose one of the six situations A–F, with payoffs to be
determined by two regions, which yield different payoffs, gradually becoming
riskier, knowing that each region may happen with equal chances. Despite the
fact that entrepreneurs seem to be signiﬁcantly more optimistic compared to the
62
K. Georgalos

control groups, the experimental data fail to detect a pattern that would indicate
lower risk aversion of the subjects that are somehow related, or intend to engage to
entrepreneurial activities.
In Masclet et al. (2009), decision under risk was tested using a Holt and Laury
(2002) list. There were in total three different treatments in a “within” subjects
design, including an individual treatment, where each subject was choosing indi-
vidually, a group treatment, where subjects in groups of three, needed to reach a
consensus via voting regarding a risky choice, and ﬁnally a choice treatment where
participants could choose between making decisions on their own or as member of
the group. The task was repeated 10 times, and groups were randomly re-matched at
the end of each task. Group choice was determined by voting. Finally, in the choice
treatment, the subjects’ willingness to pay was elicited before each decision,
regarding their willingness to either make the choice on their own or in a group.
The three bidders with the highest proposals were choosing individually, and the
remaining in groups. The subject pool was differentiated from the traditional
standards, in the sense that the population consisted both of salaried and self-
employed subjects. In total, 144 subjects were recruited, 43% of those being
classiﬁed as self-employed or employees, and the remaining being college students,
the choices of which acted as a control group.
Overall, their ﬁndings replicate the main pattern of slight risk aversion for the
majority of the subjects. Decisions made by groups or in the choice treatment, are
signiﬁcantly more risk averse compared to those made solely by individuals (36.8%
45.8% respectively against 25.9% chose 7 safe lotteries), result which is also
conﬁrmed by probit regressions. Self-employed agents appear to be less risk averse
compared to salaried workers and students. These differences are statistically
signiﬁcant between self-employed and salaried workers, as well as self-employed
and students, based on a Wilcoxon rank sum test. No difference was observed
between salaried workers and students. Moreover, salaried workers of the private
sector appear to be less risk averse compared to salaried workers of the public
sector. Finally, regarding voting behaviour, it appears that the more risk seeking
persons in a group, were more willing to align their preferences with those of the
group that expressed risk aversion. The authors claim, without providing the
reasoning behind this, that the direction of causality is from self-employment to
risk attitude, rather than the other way round (Masclet et al. 2009, p. 471).
Sandri et al. (2010) consider disinvestment behaviour of entrepreneurs when
choices are irreversible using an asset liquidation experiment and test the timing of
abandoning a project with risky returns. They focus on the question of why
entrepreneurs hold on with an under-performing business instead of selling them
“under-price”. The experimental task involved a problem of optimal stopping,
where subjects should decide when to abandon a project for a constant termination
value. The task involved stopping decisions on a project that yielded returns based
on a binomial distribution with p ¼ 0.5 and with the ﬁrst period revenues being
always equal to 1000. The risk-free interest rate was equal to 10% while the
constant revenue of abandoning the project was equal to 11,000 points (with an
interest rate of return of 10% per period applied to the revenue). By the last period

63

the subject was obliged to abandon the project. There were two treatments, different
in volatilities, where in the ﬁrst the potential gains and losses were 200 points while
at the second 500 point. The task was repeated for 20 rounds. At the end of all
rounds, a Holt and Laury (2002) list was applied in order to elicit risk preferences.
Prime objective of the study was to discover whether different volatilities
generate different results (large-scale experiment) and to test whether the results
of one of the treatments can be replicated when entrepreneurs participate. Overall
84 participants were recruited (37 non-students and 39 students) for the ﬁrst
experiment. In the second experiment the high volatility treatment was repeated
with participants being hi-tech entrepreneurs. Their sample of entrepreneurs con-
sists of only 13 subjects (15 were recruited but the data of 2 were later discarded).
The ﬁndings show that subjects hold on for too long in positions where they were
losing money. Nevertheless, no signiﬁcant difference was observed in choices
between entrepreneurs and non-entrepreneurs. They ﬁnd that none of the entrepre-
neurs is risk seeking, 23.1% are risk neutral and the remaining risk averse. On top of
that, there does not seem to exist a signiﬁcant difference regarding risk attitudes
between non-entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs.
List and Manson (2011) challenge the descriptive validity of the Expected
Utility model and explore how chief executive ofﬁcers (CEOs) decide when they
face situations that yield small probabilities and high loss events. Their experiment
consists one of the ﬁrst artefactual ﬁeld experiments to test the Expected Utility
model over losses, with subjects different from the standard student population. The
subject pool consisted of 101 subjects, 29 of whom where CEOs from the coffee
beneﬁcio (coffee mill) sector of Costa Rica, and the remaining were Costa Rican
undergraduate students. As the experiment involved the realisation of actual losses,
the ﬁrst part included the participation of subjects to unrelated, real-effort tasks
where they had the chance to generate their own income, from which could be later
subtracted. In the actual experiment, subjects faced 40 pairwise lotteries, with three
outcomes each, in the spirit of Harless (1992) and Hey and Orme (1994). Every
lottery is characterised by three outcomes x1 < x2 < x3 and a respective probability
distribution pi over these outcomes. An additional contribution of this study, is that
the domain of focus was that of losses, therefore a typical lottery involved losses
of x1 ¼ $80, x2 ¼ $30 and x3 ¼ $0 for the CEOs (the amounts were scaled down by
10 for the students). The important element of the experiment was to attach a small
probability of 5% to the worst case scenario (lose $80). Three baseline lotteries
were compared to a set of 12 other lotteries, where the probability of the worst event
was ranged from 1% to 20%, with a corresponding change of the best event
probability (lose nothing). Some lotteries where the probability of one of the events
was equal to zero was also included, resulting to a battery of 40 lotteries in total. In
all lotteries, the payoffs have been constructed is such a way to reﬂect different
“catastrophic” scenarios. Lottery A, could be seen as the safest lottery, lottery B
involved substantial medium size losses, while lottery C included modest to large
losses. One problem was randomly chosen to be played for real and events were
realised with the aid of a randomization device.

A ﬁrst result shows that CEOs are slightly more likely to choose options with
higher probability regarding the worst outcome. They attribute this result to either
different degrees of risk aversion, or due to differences in the underlying preference
functional that characterises each subject. Without any assumptions regarding the
shape of the utility function, and assuming expected utility preferences, risk indices
are estimated for all subjects showing no statistically signiﬁcant difference between
the two groups, fact which was also conﬁrmed by subsequent OLS regressions.
Drawing from the recent experimental evidence that conﬁrms the extensive viola-
tion of Expected Utility preferences, the authors extend their analysis to account for
divergence from this model, as well as differences across subject. Rather than
assuming some parametric form of preferences, they adopt the Chew et al. (1991)
quadratic utility approach. They ﬁnd that there are substantially important different
between the two cohorts. Overall, the study concludes that the assumption of
Expected Utility may signiﬁcantly understate the willingness to pay in order to
reduce risk low probability-high losses events. The willingness to pay in both
cohorts seems to be behaviourally undistinguishable but heterogeneity is apparent
across subject pools.
In the study by Burmeister-Lamp et al. (2012), the focus is on the so called
hybrid entrepreneurs, which refers to those professionals who although are being
employed in a salary-paid job, they spent a part of their working-hours to a new
enterprise that they have set up. The main research question is to determine how
these entrepreneurs allocate their time, and what is the role of risk attitudes as well
as the role of regulatory focus motivations. The experimental decision task com-
prises of a decision maker having to choose on how to allocate her total endowment
of working hours t, between a wage job with ﬁxed income, and a newly formed
enterprise, that requires a minimum amount of e working hours per day. The new
enterprise is characterised by uncertainty, which is measured by the expected return
and its variance. Large return with sizeable variance is labelled as “high” stake,
while low return with low variance as “low” stake. Therefore, the agent must
choose the optimal number of hours h with h 2 [e, t] that will maximise her utility.
Participants faced seven different scenarios, with different returns from the enter-
prise and different wage from the salary job, and they were asked to allocate their
time between the two employment conditions. Based on the data, the authors tested
four theoretical hypotheses, two focusing on utility theory, where risk averse agents
would prefer to devote their time to the enterprise (salary job) when the stake is
below (above) a threshold, and two based on the regulatory focus theory which test
whether subjects are promotion focused (strive for gains) or prevention focused
(aim to avoid losses).
In total the data of 54 subjects were included for the analysis (25 early stage
entrepreneurs and 29 students). Risk aversion was measured based on a parametric
speciﬁcation of the utility function. Overall, no signiﬁcant differences were
observed between students and entrepreneurs regarding their risk attitude or their
regulatory focus. Tobit regressions were applied in an effort to disentangle whether
the results are driven by risk aversion, regulatory focus or both. While the regres-
sion results show that risk attitude was driving behaviour in the case of students, this
Entrepreneurship Under Risk and Uncertainty: Experimental Evidence
65

was not the case of entrepreneurs. Rather, behaviour of entrepreneurs seems to be
better explained by the promotion and prevention focus effects. Regulatory focus
explains time allocation in a better way compared to risk attitudes, nevertheless, a
model which accommodated both components appears to be statistically more
robust.
Holm et al. (2013) motivated by the recent experimental literature comparing
entrepreneur and non-entrepreneur populations, and also interpreting uncertainty in
a broader way they designed and conducted a large scale experiment with the
participation of chief executive ofﬁcers (CEOs) in China. More particularly, they
hypothesise that entrepreneurs differ from other control groups in the way they deal
with uncertainty in two ways. First, based on the theoretical predictions, they
assume that entrepreneurs differ in their behavioural traits, by means of being
more willing to take risks. An additional behavioural aspect that has not been
explored yet in this literature, is the tendency that entrepreneurs have to deal with
strategic risk, that is to say, with risk that involves social interaction, situation that
characterises the day to day choices of entrepreneurs. To this end, they design an
experiment where they account for four different types of uncertainty, namely risk
(objective risk), ambiguity (subjective risk), competition (uncertainty regarding
others’ performance) and trust (uncertainty of trustee behaviour). The main
research question was to identify whether there were behavioural traits of entre-
preneurs that distinguish them from non-entrepreneurs and more speciﬁcally to
answer whether entrepreneurs: (1) differ from others with respect to risk taking;
(2) have a different degree of ambiguity aversion; (3) have different willingness to
compete than others, and; (4) exhibit different trust behaviour.
Participants were 700 entrepreneurs from the Yangzi delta region in China.
Subjects were asked to participate in four tasks in total, one for each behavioural
aspect. All of the tasks were in the form of Holt and Laury (2002) multiple price
lists. The risky task included two versions of the HL multiple price lists. In the ﬁrst,
the lotteries were exactly the same as those presented before. For the other risky
choice, subjects were asked to choose between a ﬁxed amount of money and a
lottery with a gradually increasing expected value. The ambiguity task, included
choices between lotteries were the amount of money was certain and lotteries were
the probabilities of the outcomes was fully or partial unknown. The competition
task required participant to answer a short trivia quiz, and then to choose between
lotteries with certain payoffs and lotteries where their payment was connected to
their relative to the others performance to the quiz. Finally, the trust task included
choices between lotteries with known probabilities and choices where the action of
a third party (the trustee) would determine the payoff. All choices were compared to
the choices of 200 randomly selected non-entrepreneurs, who acted as a control
group.
Both groups exhibit a certain degree of risk aversion. Nevertheless, the differ-
ence was not statistically signiﬁcant in either of the risky tasks. Entrepreneurs seem
to be more willing to compete and this difference is statistically signiﬁcant, with
male participants being more willing to participate to multilateral competition than
females. Finally, entrepreneurs appear to be more willing to expose themselves to
66
K. Georgalos

social risks compared to the control group, with this difference being statistically
signiﬁcant. Summarising, the experimental evidence shows that, although entre-
preneurs do not differ from the control group regarding their attitude towards
non-strategic risk, entrepreneurs seem to be more willing to accept uncertainties
that involve strategic risks.
Andersen et al. (2014) conducted a set of artefactual ﬁeld experiments in
Denmark in order to study potential difference regarding risk and time preferences
of small business entrepreneurs and non-entrepreneurs. This is the ﬁrst study to
account for non-Expected Utility representation of preferences, providing a higher
level of ﬂexibility in characterizing risk preferences. The decision task to elicit risk
preferences consisted of a standard Holt and Laury (2002) list. The subject pool was
composed by 125 subjects, 55 of which reported to own a business, and 70 -
non-entrepreneurs acting the control group. Applying similar methods as in Ander-
sen et al. (2008), structural econometric models were estimated, using maximum
likelihood estimation techniques. Using this methodology, allowed the authors to
obtain individual estimates of risk attitudes and discount rates for each of the
subjects.
The ﬁrst set of estimates, assuming Expected Utility preferences and a power
utility function, suggests that entrepreneurs do not differ signiﬁcantly from the
general population regarding risk preferences. Nevertheless, when the estimations
were conducted using employment status as a control, instead of ﬁrm ownership,
the results suggested that self-employed are less risk averse compared to full-time
employed, at the 10% signiﬁcance level. In a second set of estimates, the assump-
tion of Expected Utility preferences and therefore linearity in probabilities is
relaxed. Then, new estimates assuming Rank Dependent Utility preferences, a
CRRA utility function and a Prelec weighting function were obtained, which allows
for probability distortion. In general, subjects are found to have an S-shaped
weighting function. Moreover, they found a signiﬁcant effect of ﬁrm ownership
on the probability weighting parameters. Entrepreneurs are uniformly found to be
more optimistic about the best outcome that non-entrepreneurs. This higher opti-
mism generates higher aversion to variability of outcomes and therefore leads to
increase of the utility function concavity of the entrepreneurs. Overall, based on this
experiment, small business entrepreneurs in Denmark seem to differ in terms of
individual time and risk preferences than the general population. This difference is
to be attributed to different levels of optimism rather than to risk attitudes per
se. The net results indicate that both groups exhibit the same risk premium, but for
different reasons.
Koudstaal et al. (2016) tested the hypothesis of different behaviour of entrepre-
neurs under risk and uncertainty, by conducting an artefactual ﬁeld experiment in
the Netherlands. Their design is similar to the one employed in Holm et al. (2013)
with various extensions. First they compare behaviour between three groups,
entrepreneurs, managers and employees. The study takes place in a Western
country and the control group consists of employees and not of a general population
sample. Second, they complement the risk aversion measures, with a survey-based,
non-incentivised measure in order to identify why the experimental literature
Entrepreneurship Under Risk and Uncertainty: Experimental Evidence
67

usually fails to capture the correlation between entrepreneurship and risk aversion,
in contrast to survey-based studies. Third, they test for the existence of a crucial
phenomenon in the choice under uncertainty ﬁeld, that of loss aversion, the
tendency of decision maker to weight gains and losses in a different way.
Their experimental design included two distinct experiments to account for risk
aversion, loss aversion and ambiguity aversion (while List and Manson (2011) were
the ﬁrst to introduce losses, their experimental design did not allow them to measure
loss aversion, as all of the lotteries were deﬁned in the losses domain). In a ﬁrst
experiment, risk attitudes were measured in two ways, via a standard HL multiple
price list and a survey-based measure of risk aversion, as in Dohmen et al. (2011)
where participants assess their willingness to take risk in a scale ranging from 0 to 1.
Loss aversion is measured with the aid of a similar multiple price list as before, but
with negative payoffs.
In total 2288 subjects participated in the ﬁrst experiment. The results reveal that
the entrepreneurs subjectively assess themselves less risk averse compared to
managers, while managers in turn, assess themselves less risk averse compared to
employees, based on the subjective measure of risk attitude. When one focuses on
the experimental measure, although there is not signiﬁcant difference between
entrepreneurs and managers on their level of risk aversion, this difference becomes
highly signiﬁcant when the comparison is between entrepreneurs/managers and
employees. Regarding loss aversion, entrepreneurs appear to be characterised by
lower levels compared to managers and employees, who have the greatest degree of
loss aversion. Ordered probit regressions, conﬁrm these differences for a series of
different explanatory variables.
In a second experiment, the authors augmented their design in order to better
capture loss averse behaviour. A new measure was added that would compare
subjects’ willingness to pay (WTP) with their willingness to accept (WTA) for a
given good. The authors employed a between subjects design, where half of the
sample expresses WTP and the rest WTA. This method is useful to measure loss
aversion in a risk-free environment. A second measure of loss aversion, that
included risky choices, consisted of three lotteries, one in the gains domain, one
in the losses and the last in the mixed domain. The gains lottery was a choice
between a lottery that yields 300 € with probability 0.5, otherwise zero, and a lottery
that yields a ﬁxed amount for sure which ranges from 25 to 250 €. The losses task
was exactly the same but with pure losses. This allowed to test whether there is
signiﬁcant difference in choices when losses are inevitable. Finally, the mixed task,
similar to the ﬁrst experiments but with scaled-up payoffs, involved lotteries that
yielded 300 € with 0.5 and losses ranging [350 €, 0 €] against a ﬁxed payment of
0 €. The results conﬁrmed the robustness of the ﬁrst experiment. Entrepreneurs are
indeed less loss averse than managers and employees. The scaled up lottery
generated the same results, while similar patterns are observed in the pure losses
lotteries.

Ambiguity and Entrepreneurship: Experiment-Based
Evidence
In the previous section, studies that measure attitudes towards risk (objective
uncertainty) were presented. Nevertheless, real-life situations are very rarely
characterised by well-deﬁned probability distributions. As Holm et al. (2013)
point out, standard risk situations do not represent typical scenarios in entrepre-
neurial decision making. Therefore, if one wants to investigate whether entrepre-
neurs behave differently in situations that are characterised by uncertainty, attention
should be paid on decision making under ambiguity. It is striking the fact that whilst
both the theoretical and the experimental literature of choice under ambiguity is
well advanced (see Etner et al. (2012) for a review of the theoretical ambiguity
models and Hey (2014) and Trautmann and van de Kuilen (2015) for reviews of the
experimental literature), there are very few studies in entrepreneurial literature
dealing with this topic.
Macko and Tyszka (2009) in a second experiment, in the framework of the study
discussed in Sect. 2, recruited 39 employees and 41 self-employed inhabitants to
participate to an additional study that would involve more naturalistic decision
situations. Based on the idea that real economic life situations do not come along
with a well-deﬁned probability distribution, the authors aimed to investigate
whether entrepreneurs behave differently when uncertainty, rather than risk,
characterises the decision environment. Their research hypothesis stated that entre-
preneurs, as compared to employees, would more frequently opt for the risky
options. The risky options consist of 7 risky managerial scenarios, namely: taking
out a new loan, signing a contract with a new advertising agency, paying a risky
advance, selling low-quality fruit, continuing an unsuccessful business, accepting a
threat of strike in a workplace, and not admitting to pollution of the environment.
For each scenario, the subject should solve a dilemma and choose between two
options, where one of the option was always riskier that the other.
Employees opted for the risky choice 44% of the times while the entrepreneurs
55%. This difference is signiﬁcantly different at the 5% level, conﬁrming the
hypothesis that entrepreneurs would be more willing to opt for situations where
the probabilities of success or failure are not well-quantiﬁed. Note that the authors
refer to these scenarios as “risky” scenarios while in fact these cases are character-
istic examples of decision making under ambiguity. Therefore it seems that it is not
risk attitudes that drive the results but rather attitudes towards ambiguity.
In Holm et al. (2013) the results do not reveal any signiﬁcant differences in the
degree of ambiguity aversion between entrepreneurs and non-entrepreneurs. The
design was a standard HL multiple price list where one lottery’s payoff was a ﬁxed
amount ranging between a maximum and a minimum value, while for the other
lottery, the outcomes remained stable and the probabilities were unknown. The
point where the subject would switch from the safe to the ambiguous gamble was
used as an indication that the subject has reached her reservation value. The same
task was repeated by providing some partial information that the minimum
Entrepreneurship Under Risk and Uncertainty: Experimental Evidence
69

probability that each event may happen is equal to 0.25. Nevertheless, in the design,
details are not provided regarding the way that ambiguity was actually implemented
during the experiment. The results do not suggest any notable differences between
the two groups.
Koudstaal et al. (2016) employ a multiple price list design, as the one used in Fox
and Tversky (1995) to obtain measures of ambiguity aversion. The decision maker
had to choose between lotteries that involved objective uncertainty, represented by
a an urn ﬁlled with 50 red and 50 black balls, and lotteries under subjective
uncertainty, represented by an urn with red and black balls in unknown proportions.
Drawing a red ball from the objective urn would yield 300 €, otherwise zero, while
the payoff from the subjective urn ranged from 250 to 475 €. In total 10 pairwise
choices were presented to participants. Entrepreneurs behave in a similar way to
managers and therefore, are characterised by same degrees of ambiguity aversion.
What is striking, is that contrary to the intuitive predictions, both groups appear to
be more ambiguity averse compared to employees. Probit regressions conﬁrmed
this pattern, but when additional explanatory variables, such as income, age,
experience to name but a few, were added to the regressions, the signiﬁcant result
disappeared.

Conclusion and Future Research Paths
A fast skim on the experimental literature of entrepreneurship under uncertainty
may lead someone to the incorrect conclusion that at the end of the day, risk
preferences do not seem to play a vital role in the effort to explain entrepreneurship
behaviour. Nevertheless, a careful investigation on the topic may lead to some
insights that could contribute both to our better understanding on the causality
relationship of risk/ambiguity preferences and participation to ventures, as well as,
to provide some paths towards which future research should direct to. Be-low we
provide a list of issues, that researchers might be interested to take into consideration,
when they design future studies on this topic.
A general issue that needs to be accommodated is the structural assumptions that
researchers make regarding the preferences and the utility function of the decision
makers. Most of the times, a parametric-free approach may be more preferable and
robust, nevertheless, when the issue under investigation becomes more compli-
cated, structural assumptions may help to clarify causalities and too elicit prefer-
ences in a more robust way. That is to say, many of the studies that do not observe
any differences in risk attitudes, are usually assuming expected utility preferences,
where probabilities are perceived “as they are”, and risk attitudes are captured only
by the curvature of the utility function. In a recent article, Asterbo et al. (2014)
identiﬁed three potential interpretations from behavioural economics that may
explain entry decision and persistence in entrepreneurship, namely risk attitudes,
overconﬁdence and nonpecuniary motives. Furthermore, they concluded that the
Expected Utility model, may not be appropriate to explain the observed behaviour.
70
K. Georgalos

Similarly, Hambock et al. (2017) reached to the same conclusion, showing that the
measurements used for risk aversion in survey-based studies, are not compatible
with Expected Utility.
Characteristically, studies that relax the assumption of Expected Utility, appear
to identify differences in risk attitudes which is expressed by the probability
weighting function, a behavioral trait that Expected Utility cannot capture. On
top of that, Koudstaal et al. (2016) observed signiﬁcant differences when they
introduced lotteries with losses. As Expected Utility does not accommodate losses
in a particular way, as opposed to Prospect Theory which speciﬁes a particular
behavioural parameter of loss aversion, their results clearly indicate that alternative
models should also be considered. An additional example is List and Manson
(2011). While the authors obtained rich datasets from their experimental popula-
tion, the method to analyse the data and make inferences might not be the most
appropriate regarding the research question at hand. For example, one could
perform some kind of parametric analysis in order to estimate preference func-
tionals in the spirit of Harrison and Rustr€om (2008b) and Hey et al. (2010), where
probability weighting functions could be introduced, or to estimate ﬁnite mixture
models as in Harrison and Rutstr€om (2008a), where the percentage of Expected
Utility subjects as well as the percentage of those who choose based on an
alternative model (e.g. Rank Dependent Utility) can be precisely estimated. The
above methods can generate precise estimates at the individual or population levels,
and risk aversion can be captured by both the non-linearity of the utility function
and the probability weighting, disentangling the two effects. As Andersen et al.
(2014) conclude, under Expected Utility, the risk premium is uniquely driven by
aversion to variability of outcomes, and this effect is captured by the curvature of
the utility function. On the other hand, when one relaxes the Expected Utility
hypothesis and allows for more ﬂexible speciﬁcations, such as the Rank Dependent
Utility model (Quiggin 1982) or Prospect Theory (Tversky and Kahneman 1992),
risk aversion may also be generated by the relative optimism or pessimism about
the chances of success. This attribute is known as probability weighting, which
allows to model subjective beliefs of the decision makers, which allow them to
under-weight or over-weight the probability of various events.
A second issue has to do with the elicitation mechanisms. As it can be seen in
Table 1, the vast majority of the studies uses the same methodology to elicit risk and
ambiguity preferences. Nonetheless, there is an extensive literature [see Holt and
Laury (2014)], highlighting the drawbacks of this method, or even showing that risk
preferences are highly correlated with the task under question (Loomes and
Pogrebna 2014), and therefore, careful interpretation needs to be made of the
elicited measures. Regarding ambiguity preferences, Hey (2014) and Trautmann
and van de Kuilen (2015) review various non-parametric and parametric methods to
elicit attitudes, which can avoid the drawbacks that early methods suffered from.
Also, a recent strand of the experimental literature under risk, focuses on the role
that group decision making plays in risk attitudes. Given that nowadays, many
entrepreneurial decisions are made in executive boards and committees, it would be
interesting to complement the work of Masclet et al. (2009) and investigate the role
Entrepreneurship Under Risk and Uncertainty: Experimental Evidence
71

of groups and its inﬂuence to both risk and ambiguity attitudes. Trautmann and
Vieider (2012) provide an extensive review on how groups inﬂuence risk attitudes.
Last but not least, an element that has not been addressed in a satisfactory level
in this literature, is that of gender effects. While there is a bulk of empirical studies
investigating the relationship between risk and gender (see Filippin and Crosetto
(2016) for a review of the literature) the interconnection between gender, risk and
entrepreneurial behaviour is an area yet to be explored. To this end, one could
incorporate different elicitation methods and employ more informative experimen-
tal designs as those described in Holt and Laury (2014), as for instance, the study by
Comeig et al. (2015) which separates between downside and upside risk in order to
study gender effects.
To summarise these points, the experimental literature of choice under risk is
very rich, regarding both the available theoretical and econometric speciﬁcations,
as well as the methods to elicit preferences and beliefs under uncertainty. On the
other hand, the experimental literature that tries to connect risk preferences and
entrepreneurial choice has just started and counts less than 10 years. Whilst, this is a
positive step ahead, there seems to be a lag in the methods applied to this literature.
Both experimental techniques to elicit preferences and statistical methods to ana-
lyse the available data have been dramatically improve during the last decade. By
adopting all these methodological advances, one should expect to obtain cleaner
data, as well as to be able to make more robust inference on the correlation between
entrepreneurship and decision making under uncertainty.

Sensing and Generating New Opportunities
for Value Innovation: How Team Behaviour
Contributes to Success or to Failure?
Toma´s F. Gonza´lez-Cruz and Clara M. Martı´nez-Fuentes
Abstract The behavioral side of the decision process inherent to strategy is an
issue that is gaining attention from both academic and practitioners. At the same
time, the Schumpeterian conception of innovation, returns to gain relevance in an
environment where technology leads to process dematerialization and exponential
paths of change. In this context, this paper analyses which decision processes,
cognitive abilities and heuristics lead to sense and generate value innovation for
customers. The analysis of 26 master student teams that ran the same strategy
simulator show that the consideration and description of a wide range of alternatives
and team agreement as a result of discussion of such alternatives, is the recipe that
leads to sense and generate value innovation. Alike, neither intuition nor analogies
from past decisions are present in the set of conditions that lead to team success.

Introduction
The way teams manage information and behave along the decision making process
is at the centre of recent veins of research published in top journals along the last ten
years. In parallel, the ﬁeld of Strategic Management is receiving different contri-
butions that put in the research agenda a set of ways of formulating strategy that
enhance the relevance of Value Innovation.
Value Innovation emerges from the conjunction of creativity, customer under-
standing and technology, and is the result of an entrepreneurial strategic process
(Ireland et al. 2003). This Schumpeterian way of doing innovation requires that
ﬁrms embark on a continuous search process, looking for present and potential
user’s needs (Kim and Mauborgne 2005;
Priem 2007; Hax 2010). The goal is
sensing, generating and capturing opportunities in markets that are in a constant

state of ﬂux (Schumpeter 1942; Kirzner 1997; Jacobson 1992). This kind of
innovation depends on a cognitive reconstruction of existing data and market
elements in a fundamental new way (Kim and Mauborgne 2005). As Alvarez and
Barney (2007, p.15) state: “rarely will entrepreneurs be able to see ‘the end from the
beginning’”. Thus, intuitive thinking (Kim and Mauborgne 2005, p.67), experi-
mentation by trial and error, and proper analysis through assessment processes and
measurement tools, are key elements for discovery and learning (Hax 2010;
Madohk and Marques 2013).
This way of making strategy depends on a strategic process where teams devote
time to discuss, and as a result reach agreement about the strategy to be executed
(Kim and Mauborgne 2005:85; Lawson and Price 2003), consider and evaluate a
comprehensive set of alternatives and use proper formal methods and tools (Kim
and Mauborgne 2005:88–93; Lovallo and Sibony 2010). Alike, this strategic
process depends also on manager’s intuition and inductive reasoning, which
becomes paramount for developing manager’s generative sensing competences
(Dong et al. 2016a, b). This view gives way to the aforementioned vein of research
that puts the focus on the analytical processes and behavioural side of the strategic
process.
Even when research on strategy decision making processes and heuristics has
indeed received attention (Priem and Cycyota 2001; Hodgkinson et al. 2008;
Schoemaker 1990), nowadays we have neither enough empirical research on this
kind of complex judgments nor a uniﬁed view of this intricate issue. Therefore, the
main goal of this chapter is exploring how the conjunction of different team
behaviours—analytical processes and ways of making judgements—affect the
team generative sensing competences that lead to create value innovation. Data
came from an experiment with twenty six teams that face the same decisions on a
strategy simulator game. Results show that a proper combination of search and
analytical processes, plus giving enough room to discussion in order to achieve
team agreement, are the recipe to sense and generate value innovation.

Sensing and Generating Value Innovation: Team
Decision Processes and Judgement
Value innovation is a term coined by Kim and Mauborgne (2005) that describes a
kind of Schumpeterian innovation which supposes the creation of a totally new
market. This kind of innovation requires the ability to explore and sense unmet
opportunities, gauge the size of the not yet existing market, and create and quickly
cope it before competitors come in (ibid).
Kim and Mauborgne (2005) proposal, as well as others made by Ries (2011) and
Radjou and Prabhu (2015), present a set of commonalities with regard the way of
conceiving innovative value propositions. All three underline that innovation is a
question of entrepreneurial mind-set as well as enacting a set of proper exploratory
and analytical routines along the decision process.

With regard the decision process, Lovallo and Sibony (2010) highlight, ﬁrstly,
the relevance of proper analytical processes to make successful decisions. These
include the breadth of alternatives considered in the ﬁrst phases of opportunity
identiﬁcation (Lovallo and Sibony 2006; Hodgkinson and Healey 2011). Because
such kind of innovation requires challenging conventional wisdom, it is important
to consider the widest range of possible alternatives.
RQ1 The consideration of a wide set of alternatives is present when value inno-
vation is present
The second component of the decision process that draws the attention of
scholars is the level of accuracy in describing and representing in detail the
alternatives considered. The main purpose is to make able a productive and
enriching process of discussion, exchange of views and mutual assessment (Kim
and Mauborgne 2005; Levinthal 2011).
RQ2 Detailed representation and description of alternatives is present when value
innovation is present
The third element of the decision process that authors like Ries (2011), Kim and
Mauborgne (2005) and Lovallo and Sibony (2010) stress, is the importance of
relying on formal methods to drive experimentation and organizational learning. As
Ries (2011) remarks the creation of new value propositions and innovations
requires a systematic process of experimentation, learning by doing, and trial and
error, that relies on a set of analytical methods and tools.
RQ3 The use of formal tools to analyse alternatives is present when value inno-
vation is present
Last but not least, other essential issue of strategy decision making is about the
level of team agreement about the strategy to be followed. Authors like Lawson and
Price (2003) stress the importance of achieving strong agreement between organi-
zation members when this kind of critical decisions are taken. Alike, other authors
point out that agreement, in the absence of previous dissent and discussions based
on information and different points of view, could be a clear signal that something
goes wrong (Lovallo and Sibony 2010; Huyett and Koller 2011).
RQ4 Agreement, as a consequence of previous discussion based on information
and the confrontation of different points of view, is present when value innovation is
present
With regard the way that judgements, which lead teams to build alternatives and
make a decision, are based on different cognitive skills, two have received recent
scholarly attention: intuition and the use of analogies.
Intuition is considered by scholars a relevant cognitive skill to identify and
create opportunities. This task of sensing new opportunities requires the interaction
between reﬂexive (e.g., intuition, implicit association) and reﬂective (e.g., explicit)
reasoning (Gavetti and Rivkin 2007; Lieberman 2000, 2007). Subsequently,
Hodgkinson and Healey (2011: 1506) propose that ‘organizations that incorporate
intuition into their repertoire of sensing capabilities will identify and respond to
Sensing and Generating New Opportunities for Value Innovation: How Team. . .
77

opportunities and threats more effectively than organizations that rely solely on
analytic approaches’.
RQ5 Intuition is present when value innovation is present
The second cognitive skill that is considered by scholars as relevant in the process
of sensing and creating value innovation is analogical thinking, which involves the
comparison of a novel situation to one previously faced Then it seems necessary to
gain a better understanding of the way individuals and teams draw analogies and give
room to recognize the reliance on creative processes to form ‘mental leaps’ between
novel and familiar strategic problems via implicit reference to the abstract concepts
that link them. To have a proper consideration of the role of analogy in the process of
sensing and generating value innovation it is inescapable to clearly differentiate the
way analogy is built and introduced in the decision process. On one hand, as Gavetti
et al. (2005) show, executives often use one single analogy to guide their strategic
thinking. Although frequent, this approach can sometimes mislead decision makers.
As Dubin and Lovallo (2008) point pout, the predictive power of analogy depends on
the deep structural similarities between the two compared cases or events. On the
other hand, recent research shows that there are other more reliable ways of building
analogies (Lovallo et al. 2012). This process is based on explicit and structured
heuristics and usually relays on a broad set of past cases. In this chapter, due the
nature of the simulation and team features, the use of analogies is based on single case
and based on implicit thinking.
RQ6 The use of analogies is present when value innovation is present
As a summary in Table 1 conditions considered to sense and generate value
innovation are shown.

Methodology
Due to the exploratory nature of the research questions and the qualitative nature of
the research design, fsQCA is considered as a proper analytical method. The
Qualitative Comparative Analysis was originally developed by Ragin (1987,
2000, 2008) and is used to analyse complex causality. QCA can be used to explain
complex phenomena through the identiﬁcation of conditions or conﬁgurations of
conditions that are sufﬁcient or necessary for the phenomenon to take place.
FsQCA (Ragin and Fiss 2008) requires the calibration of the conditions (vari-
ables) into values between 0 and 1. In this case, due to the very exploratory nature of
the research, and due to the privileged position of the researchers as an external
observers, the method of calibration implied a higher involvement of the
researchers, who were in charge of assigning a value within the 0–1 range to the
data available. This procedure entails more work because the researchers need to
use their knowledge of the case and available sources to be able to successfully
calibrate the data. The calibration was carried out separately and the differences
were subsequently discussed and a deﬁnitive value was assigned.
Using consistency and coverage thresholds, the researchers then identify the
conﬁgurations or conditions that are sufﬁcient or necessary for the outcome of
interest. Consistency refers to the degree to which a condition belongs to a conﬁg-
uration and to the outcome. A low level of consistency is not acceptable. The
common consistency threshold value is set at 0.75 or 0.8. In contrast, a low
coverage –the measure that indicates the number of cases a conﬁguration explains
can be low because even if the conﬁguration only explains a few cases, it might still
hold value for the analysis in context. A condition or conﬁguration is sufﬁcient
when the outcome takes place every time the condition exists. In contrast, a
condition is necessary when it appears in all instances of the outcome. Sufﬁcient
conditions are rare and do not rule out other combinations. That is, a sufﬁcient
condition may explain the outcome by itself, but the same outcome may be
explained by other conﬁgurations of conditions. This principle is known as
equiﬁnality (Ragin 2000).
Another advantage of fsQCA is that it allows the analysis of asymmetric
relationships. Alike, it measures the combined effect of multiple variables on an
outcome instead of focusing on the individual effect of each of the variables on its
own (Roig-Tierno et al. 2017).

Sample and Calibration
Data comes from a group of 104 master degree students form Valencia University.
They were grouped in twenty six teams of four people that play the Stratx Blue
Ocean Simulator©. This strategy simulator is based on the Blue Ocean Strategy
book from Kim and Mauborgne (2005). The simulator leads each team to make nine

decisions along nine theoretical years—periods—: three in a mature or ‘red market’
(Y41–Y43), three in order to create a totally new market through product value
innovation (Y44–Y46), and three last decisions focused on creating value innova-
tion through service and delivery (Y47–Y49). Then, due to the structure of the
experiment, research questions 1 to 4 are analysed twice, in Y44–Y46 and in Y47–
Y49 periods. Research question 5 is analysed for the Y44–Y46 time spam and
research question 6 is examined for the Y47–Y49 time lapse.
Besides information about the ﬁrm and the industry, the simulator gives to each
team the same qualitative data about non-customers and their unmet needs. The
report shows ﬁeld data gathered through a qualitative ethnographic survey, which
came from the collection of different opinions and direct observations. Then the
team should embark on an exercise to sense and quickly seize totally new markets
where competition doesn’t exist. At the end of each period (Y43, Y46 and Y49), the
simulator itself offers a set of key performance indicators that measure different
dimensions of performance, being one of them the accuracy of the new product/
service to meet customer’s real needs (in Y46 and Y49).
At the end of each period, every team ﬁlled up a questionnaire that ask about:
emotions they experienced; team behaviour in relation to the consideration and
analysis of alternatives; different analytical techniques and tools applied through
the decision process; level of agreement—with regard product design, cost, price,
marketing budget, retailing, geographic expansion, corporate projects—; the use of
intuitive thinking; and the use of analogies with respect to other past experiences.
Questionnaires were ﬁlled up with the support (if needed) of teachers, who have
been observing and following teams. In this sense, the teacher role is to contribute,
as an external observer, to the accuracy of the data retrieved through the question-
naire. Next in Table 2 outcome and conditions are presented and brieﬂy described

as well as the source of data. In order to avoid observer bias, two teachers observe
team behaviour and separately assess team responses to questionnaires.
According to Ragin and Fiss (2016), the steps to carry out the process of
calibration consist on conceptualize the causal conditions and the outcome and to
allocate membership scores. Thereby, the outcome value innovation is calibrated
using the method proposed by Ragin and Fiss (2008) establishing three cut-off
points based on the 90, 50th and 10th percentiles (Misangyi and Acharya 2014;
Palacios-Marque´s et al. 2016; Kraus et al. 2016). Because conditions fs_intuit,
fs_ past, fs_mat-est were appraised through a ﬁve-point liker scale, the following
cut off points were established (5, 3, 1). The conditions fs_alt-con and fs_alt-an
were calibrated depending on the number of alternatives. The cut off points were
established at (4, 3, 1) for fs_alt-con and (3, 2, 1) for fs_alt-an. Finally, for the
condition fs_agreement, the following cut off points were established (7, 4, and 1).
5
Analysis of Necessary Conditions
The necessary conditions are especially important since the outcome (value inno-
vation) cannot occur without its presence (Dul 2016). Thus, Table 3 presents a
necessary analysis. In this research, the analysis has been conducted using the
software fsQCA 3.0 (Ragin and Sean 2016).
In order for the condition to be deemed necessary, the consistency must be 0.9 or
higher (Schneider et al. 2010). As illustrated in Table 3, there is no value that
exceeds the 0.9 threshold. As a result, it can be argued that there aren’t any
necessary conditions. Thus, there is no condition a team should present necessary
to sense and generate value innovation or lack of value innovation. So it will be a
combination of conditions that are sufﬁcient for reaching the outcome.

As well, in Table 4 we present the analysis for necessary conditions for year 49.
As could be seen, there is no value that exceeds the 0.9 threshold. Again, there is no
condition a team should present or accomplish which is necessary to sense and
generate value innovation or lack of value innovation. So it will be a combination of
conditions that are sufﬁcient for reaching the outcome.
6
Analysis of Sufﬁcient Conditions
A sufﬁcient condition implies that a condition or combination of conditions can
reach the outcome by itself. On the contrary, a condition considered necessary
implies that the condition must always be present (Fiss 2007; Schneider and Eggert
2014).
Speciﬁcally, this research will analyse four models: two for Y44–Y46 period and
two for Y47–Y49 time lapse.
With regard Y46, on the one hand we analyse the causal conﬁgurations that are
sufﬁcient to reach the outcome (model 1), that is, patterns leading teams to sense
and generate a new product for a totally new market.
Model 1: fs VI ¼ f fs alt-con; fs alt-an; fs mat-est; fs agree; fs intuit
ð
Þ
On the other hand, model 2 examines which conﬁgurations lead to teams to fail
in their effort to sense and generate a new product able to meet the needs of an
unattended market.
Model 2: fs VI ¼ f fs alt-con; fs alt-an; fs mat-est; fs agree; fs intuit

One of the main characteristics of comparative qualitative analysis is that the
result or outcome can be achieved by different paths or causal conﬁgurations—

equiﬁnality—(Ragin 2000). In this line we can see how in both, Tables 5 and 6 there
are four conﬁgurations for the presence and absence of value innovation.
Table 5 contains the fsQCA intermediate solution. For each conﬁguration of
casual conditions, this table shows raw and unique coverage, and consistency. In
this solution, the coverage and consistency are 0.40 and 0.88 respectively; good ﬁt
parameters (Eng and Woodside 2012; Ragin 2008).
As could be seen in Table 5 two combinations of conditions are given when the
analysed teams sense and generate value innovation. The ﬁrst one reveals that,
when teams sense and generate value innovation, a wide range of alternatives are
considered and that the alternatives where neither chosen nor rejected following
intuitive reasoning. The second one reveals that a wide range of alternatives are
considered, that there is agreement about the implemented strategy and that the
team uses formal analysis based on different analytical tools. Then, in both com-
binations the consideration of a wide range of alternative solutions is present.
Results from Model 2 analysis are presented in Table 6. As could be seen, two
combinations of sufﬁcient conditions are considered. The ﬁrst one reveals that the
absence of intuitive reasoning as well as lack of a wide range of alternatives to be
considered, and lack of agreement is present when teams fail to sense and generate
value innovation. Alike, the second combination shows that the presence of agree-
ment jointly with lack of a wide range of alternatives to be considered, lack of
detailed description and analysis of such alternatives and lack of formal analysis,
are conditions given when teams fail to sense and generate value innovation.
These results show that both, the absence of a wide range of alternatives to be
considered and lack of agreement, as well as, agreement in the absence of proper
alternative formulation and analysis, are combinations that lead to failure in sensing
and generating value innovation.

With regard the analysis of models 3 and 4, we have introduced one change in
the set of conditions. That is, we leave intuition—fs_intuit—and introduce the use
of analogies with past experience to choose or reject alternatives—fs_past—. Here
is important to remember that Y-47–Y49 is the second round where teams face the
challenge of sensing and generating value innovation, and as a consequence they
have previous and recent experience to compare with.
Model 3 examines which set of conditions is present when teams succeed in their
effort to sense and generate a new service able to meet the needs of an unattended
market in Y47–Y49 period.
Model 3: fs VI ¼ f fs alt-con; fs alt-an; fs mat-est; fs agree; fs past
ð
Þ
Alike, model 4 examines which set of conditions are present when teams fail in
their effort to sense and generate a new service able to meet the needs of an
unattended market in Y47–Y49 time span.
Model 4: fs VI ¼ f fs alt-con; fs alt-an; fs mat-est; fs agree; fs past
ð
Þ
As results show in Table 7, in all two combinations the use of analogies to make
decisions is absent when teams succeed in sensing and generating value innovation.
Again it appears as relevant that teams consider, analyse and reach agreement in
every aspect of strategy.
With regard model 4, the lack of sufﬁcient analysis in terms of number of
alternatives considered and description and analysis of such alternatives, as well a
lack of agreement are conditions present when teams fail to sense and generate
value innovation (Table 8).

Conclusions
Despite the effort to understand the analytical and behavioural process that lead
teams to formulate alternatives and make decisions, the road ahead is still long.
Previous research devotes effort to identify the elements that contribute to properly
make complex decisions in situations when incomplete information and uncertainty
are the main features. Alike, previous research gives evidence about the direct
impact of each condition on decision success. The goal of this chapter is getting a
better understanding about which combination of decision processes and cognitive
skills are present when teams make successful decisions.
The kind of decision under study is this research is about sensing and generating
value innovation (Kim and Mauborgne 2005), that is, creating a new value prop-
osition for an unattended market. The main features of this decision are: uncertainty
about the real size of the new market, getting a proper understanding of the
customer real needs and developing an inductive reasoning process from ﬁeld
information.
The research method is experimental and exploratory by its very nature. Data
come from direct observation and also was retrieved from a questionnaire ﬁlled-up
by twenty-six teams of master degree students in Valencia University, Spain. They
run the Blue Ocean Simulator© as a part of a subject focused on getting a better
understanding of the mind-set behind the process of Schumpeterian innovation
proposed by recent and famed contributions like: Blue Ocean Strategy (Kim and
Mauborgne 2005), Lean Start-Up (Ries 2011) or Frugal Innovation (Radjou and
Prabhu 2015).
Departing from previous academic contributions we identify a set of conditions
that contribute to a better strategy decision making and analyse it using fsQCA.
This method is suitable to reach our research goal because its qualitative nature, the
sample size, and that the goal is to identify different combinations of conditions that
are given when the desired output is present. Alike this method don’t presupposes
reverse causality and is able to look for the set of conditions that appear when the
output is absent.
The conditions considered are: (1) the number of different alternatives consid-
ered; (2) the number of such alternatives that were described and discussed in
detail; (3) the use of formal tools in order to organize and analyse information; and
(4) the level of agreement between team members with regard the chosen alterna-
tive. Also to cognitive skills are considered given its relevance in previous research,
that is: (5) intuitive reasoning; and (6) the use of analogies.
Results show that there is no single necessary condition to reach neither success
nor failure. So it depends on a proper combination of conditions. This conclusion is
coherent with Lovallo and Sibony (2010) that plead for the development of proper
decision process that give room to constructive conﬂict and discussion that prevents
from poor cognitive styles and cognitive bias.
Our results show that the consideration of a wide set of alternatives, the detailed
description and analysis of a sufﬁcient number of alternatives, the use of formal

85

tools to retrieve, organize, frame and properly analyse inklings, and the subsequent
achievement of agreement are conditions that are present when team succeed in
sensing and generating value innovation.
On the contrary, lack of consideration and analysis of a sufﬁcient range of
alternatives, and strong agreement when the previous conditions are absent, happen
when teams fail to sense and generate value innovation. Alike, results show that
neither intuitive cognition, nor analogies to past experiences are present when team
achieve success. While this results, with regard the use analogies, are coherent with
part of recent research (Lovallo et al. 2012), they contradict the theoretical prop-
ositions made by Hodgkinson and Healey (2011) with respect to intuitive cognition.
In any case, these results should be considered as a starting point for further
research. Limitations are evident due to the exploratory nature of an analysis made
over a very speciﬁc set of data. That is, the sample is made of master degree
students and come from a strategy simulator game.

Entrepreneurial Personality, Traits

The Role of the Entrepreneurial Personality
in New Ventures
Xuemei Xie, Jiuchang Lv, and Yuchen Xu
Abstract For new ventures, entrepreneurs must obtain critical support, such as
ﬁnancial, material, and social resources, to succeed and thrive. These demands
suggest that successful entrepreneurs have distinct personal characteristics that
allow them to excel. Previous work has found particular personality traits that are
inherent in entrepreneurs. However, the role of entrepreneurial personalities has
been largely ignored, especially from the perspective of negative personality traits.
Thus, in this chapter, we will examine the role of entrepreneurial personality
underlying the success of new ventures. Speciﬁcally, we will analyze both the
positive and negative aspects of the entrepreneurial personality. As it pertains to the
positive traits, we will present a number of factors, including emotional intelli-
gence, hardiness, entrepreneurial self-efﬁcacy, and warmth. These personality traits
can enhance an entrepreneur’s willingness to take initiative, tolerate risk, and deal
with setbacks, enabling new ventures to continue to innovate, renew, and keep
pushing forward, even after having achieved success. As for the negative traits, we
will discuss several factors including narcissism, overconﬁdence, and fear of
failure. Given the costly repercussions of these negative characteristics, we will
examine the possible impacts of these attributes on the success or failure of new
ventures. We ﬁnd that entrepreneurial positive traits are conducive to the growth of
new ventures, while the negative personality traits hinder the survival and develop-
ment of start-ups. Our research provides a sharper theoretical framework for the
research of entrepreneurial personality.

and social prosperity (Bosma et al. 2009), thus entrepreneurship has become a
global phenomenon, growing rapidly in recent years (Acs et al. 2005).
With the rapid development of entrepreneurial activities, academic interest in
this ﬁeld of economics, sociology, business, and psychology is increasing (Hisrich
et al. 2007). Personality theory was one of the early classical studies in this
research. In 1921, American psychologists Floyd H. Allport and Gordon
W. Allport ﬁrst proposed the concept of personality traits in their book “Personality
Traits: Their Classiﬁcation and Measurement” (Allport and Allport 1921). From
then on, research on the personality theory gradually became more systematic and
scientiﬁc. Given that personality theory plays an important role in examining
humans’ behaviors and perception, many previous studies have suggested that the
individual psychological disposition of an entrepreneur is an essential factor in
determining whether a commercial start-up will achieve success (Espiritu-Olmos
and Sastre-Castillo 2015; Obschonka et al. 2013).
Thus, entrepreneurial personality is an important factor for the success or failure
of a new venture. In the 1990s, researchers reached a consensus on the personality
traits, described as the ﬁve-factor model (Goldberg 1981). The Big Five Personality
Model,
which
includes
ﬁve dimensions—extraversion, emotional stability,
agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness to experience—provides a useful
framework for examining the relationship between personality traits and entrepre-
neurship. Further, Hogan et al. (1994) argued that the Big Five Personality Model
describes the personality traits when people are working at their best, that is, “the
bright side of personality.”
However, the Big Five Personality Model cannot be used to measure the
relationship between individual personality traits and particular behavior in situa-
tions of stress and change. Therefore, some scholars have explored a different
avenue that concerns negative personality traits in the workplace—“the dark side
of personality.” Hogan et al. (1994) formally introduced the “the dark side of
personality” in the early 1990s. They argued that negative personality traits,
which refer to traits tending to create personality disorders under stress or crisis,
such as jealousy or narcissism, often undermine interpersonal relationships, reduce
subordinates’ loyalty, and hurt colleagues’ trust. Generally speaking, negative
personality traits make it impossible for entrepreneurs to build and maintain
efﬁcient organizations, which is one of the main reasons for the ineffectiveness
and failure of new enterprises.
Moreover, previous literature has indicated that personality is a valid predictor
of employee job performance (e.g., Chamorro-Premuzic and Furnham 2010), and is
closely related to a company’s managerial levels and performance outcomes (Hurtz
and Donovan 2000). Similarly, Staniewski et al. (2016) argued that there exists a
signiﬁcant relationship between entrepreneurial personality traits and a company’s
success. Therefore, entrepreneurial personality is an important factor for the suc-
cess of a business.
Based on previous literature in the ﬁeld of entrepreneurship and personality,
using the method of qualitative analysis, this chapter focuses on examining the
impact of entrepreneurial personality traits on new ventures’ growth. As Miller
92
X. Xie et al.

(2015) has pointed out that positive and negative personality traits should be
included in the analysis of entrepreneurial personality, we aim to classify the
entrepreneurial personality traits (positive and negative) that have different effects
on the establishment and success of an enterprise (Rauch and Frese 2007). In so
doing, we will examine the role of positive personality traits (i.e., emotional
intelligence, hardiness, entrepreneurial self-efﬁcacy, and warmth) and negative
personality traits (i.e., narcissism, overconﬁdence, and fear of failure) as they
pertain to the entrepreneurial process (see Fig. 1). We argue that entrepreneurs
with positive personality traits can enhance team cohesion, overcome difﬁculties
and pressures, and promote the survival and development of new ventures. In
contrast, negative personality traits will inﬂuence the rational judgment of the
entrepreneurs, lead to the wrong entrepreneurial decisions, and hinder the growth
of new ventures. We then put forward relevant recommendations to improve
entrepreneurial personality management.

Positive Personality
According to personality theory, everyone has various personality traits, such as
hardiness (Bartone et al. 2009), warmth (Cuddy et al. 2011), and emotional stability
(Cheng et al. 2016). As they pertain to our discussion here, entrepreneurial person-
ality traits affect the way one does things, one’s management style, and one’s
performance. A large amount of literature has emphasized the importance of the
personality traits that are associated with successful entrepreneurship (e.g., Luca
et al. 2013; Staniewski et al. 2016). Hence, this chapter will discuss the impact of
positive entrepreneurial personality traits on a new venture, including emotional
intelligence, hardiness, entrepreneurial self-efﬁcacy, and warmth.

2.1
Emotional Intelligence
Emotional intelligence (EI) was presented by the famous psychologist Daniel
Goleman in his book “Emotional Intelligence,” in which he stated that the funda-
mentals of EI are self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, and the
ability to manage relationships (Goleman 1996a). EI can be deﬁned as the capacity
to process emotional information accurately and efﬁciently, including material that
is relevant to the recognition, construction, and regulation of emotion in oneself
(Salovey and Mayer 1990) (Fig. 2). EI, which is closely related to interpersonal
relationships and the ability to control emotions, has gradually become a funda-
mental unit for examining how entrepreneurs achieve success.
2.1.1
The Impact of Entrepreneurial EI on New Venture Growth
While building an enterprise, entrepreneurs need to be able to deal with all types of
people. EI provides entrepreneurs with competencies that are necessary to navigate
through the stress of change. Due to the huge pressure and uncertainty in the process of
entrepreneurship, EI becomes the key for entrepreneurs as they build their businesses.
Thus, it is clear that an entrepreneur’s EI has an important impact on the success of
their enterprise (Goleman 1996b). On the one hand, EI has been found not only to
advance one’s interpersonal skills but also provides higher levels of effective com-
munication (Hendon et al. 2017), which allows an organization to maintain successful
relationships and enhance entrepreneurial team cohesion. On the other hand, entre-
preneurs with a high level of EI have greater self-management and self-restraint
abilities, which can gain the employees’ sense of trust and allow the entrepreneurs
to master their interactions with others in a more effective manner (Wong and Law
2002), thus improving team cohesion. In addition, entrepreneurs with a high level of
EI can create a relevant management system from the employees’ point of view, and
adjust it according to the psychological and emotional responses of the employees to
improve their work enthusiasm. In summary, entrepreneurs with a high level of EI
play an important role in the survival and development of new ventures.

2.1.2
The Management of Entrepreneurial EI
According to the above analysis, encouraging the growth of entrepreneurs’ EI is an
effective way to improve the growth of new ventures. Managing and developing the
ability of entrepreneurs’ EI can be accomplished in various ways (Fig. 3). First,
entrepreneurs can strengthen their self-awareness and cultivate their sense of
responsibility. More speciﬁcally, entrepreneurs need to learn to correctly self-
evaluate to fully understand their strengths and weaknesses, and to be soberly
aware of their responsibilities and their mission in the entrepreneurial process.
Second, entrepreneurs can enhance their skills of emotional control and interper-
sonal communication. For one thing, entrepreneurs should master control over their
emotions in order to calmly deal with unexpected issues in the workplace. Addi-
tionally, entrepreneurs should learn to be agreeable when dealing with others,
appreciate the abilities and talents of others, show respect for different opinions,
all of which help to establish good interpersonal relationships. Third, entrepreneurs
should learn to appreciate themselves and build their self-conﬁdence and self-
motivation to maintain a lasting entrepreneurial passion.
2.2
Hardiness
Hardiness is an attribute of certain people that allows them to respond effectively to
stress demands so that they can perform better (Bartone et al. 2009) and remain
healthier (Soderstrom et al. 2000). As hardiness is an important personality trait
studied in relation to stress (Delahaij et al. 2010), researchers have found that it is
part of a positive personality that integrates a person’s cognition, behavior, and

emotion. Individuals with this personality trait often maintain a positive, optimistic,
and persevering emotional state.
2.2.1
The Impact of Entrepreneurial Hardiness on New Ventures
Growth
Hardiness can motivate individuals to allocate sustained personal effort to accom-
plishment goals (Baum and Locke 2004). Entrepreneurs with a high level of
hardiness have stable emotional control, and can face difﬁculties positively. Kobasa
(1979) assessed the role of hardiness in mental health, stating that managers with a
high level of hardiness have fewer problems regarding their physical and mental
health than managers with a low level of hardiness. Rhodewalt and Zone (1989)
also indicated that hardiness can reduce the effects of stress on individuals’ physical
and psychological health. Further, as Bartone (1999) showed, the higher one’s level
of hardiness is, the stronger one’s self-control and self-management are. Given that
self-control plays an important role in goal creation and adoption (Fujita 2011),
entrepreneurs who demonstrate a high level of hardiness tend to be the most highly
valued. Moreover, entrepreneurs with a high degree of hardiness not only have
better physical and mental health but also have a strong ability to withstand pressure
under unfavorable conditions while building their enterprises.
2.2.2
The Management of Entrepreneurial Hardiness
The ability to manage and develop entrepreneurs’ hardiness can be accomplished in
the following ways (Fig. 4). First, entrepreneurs should broaden their self-
education. The level of self-evaluation and self-regulation has important effects
on the formation and development of an individual’s personality (Day and
Unsworth 2013; Hiller and Hambrick 2005). Thus, to develop hardiness, entrepre-
neurs need to maintain a positive attitude. Second, entrepreneurs should enhance
their physical exercise. Adhering to physical exercise over a long period of time
allows an entrepreneur to be emotionally stable in the face of difﬁculties. Third,
entrepreneurs need to learn to master their emotions and regulate their moods to
improve their hardiness, allowing them to face challenges with a positive attitude.
2.3
Entrepreneurial Self-Efﬁcacy
Starting in the 1990s, the theory of self-efﬁcacy was introduced into the research of
entrepreneurship, and thus, the concept of entrepreneurial self-efﬁcacy emerged.
Entrepreneurial self-efﬁcacy is deﬁned as an individual’s belief that they can
effectively perform tasks and activities central to starting and running a new
venture (Baron et al. 2016; Chen et al. 1998). As a personality characteristic
96
X. Xie et al.

(Littunen 2000), self-efﬁcacy is positively correlated with performance (Spieker
and Hinsz 2004), and it plays an inﬂuential role in determining an individual’s level
of effort and their amount of perseverance (Chen et al. 2004).
2.3.1
The Impact of Entrepreneurial Self-Efﬁcacy on New Ventures
Growth
Previous work has revealed that entrepreneurial self-efﬁcacy has a positive impact
on entrepreneurs’ behavior and new ventures’ growth (Hmieleski and Corbett
2008). First, entrepreneurial self-efﬁcacy can help an entrepreneur correctly under-
stand their own ability to inﬂuence activities in the entrepreneurial process. Second,
high levels of entrepreneurial self-efﬁcacy are related to the success of new
ventures (Baum and Locke 2004; Belso-Martı´nez et al. 2017; Soriano 2005).
Third, entrepreneurs face a lot of pressure in the process of entrepreneurship, and
thus, those with higher entrepreneurial self-efﬁcacy will often be more optimistic
and more conﬁdent in their entrepreneurial activities; they will actively and appro-
priately respond under tough circumstances, allowing them to overcome difﬁculties
and achieve success.
2.3.2
The Management of Entrepreneurial Self-Efﬁcacy
Entrepreneurs can develop and manage their ability of entrepreneurial self-efﬁcacy
using the following suggestions (Fig. 5). First, entrepreneurs should actively
participate in entrepreneurial activities to enrich their business experiences.
Experiencing successes and failures are the most basic ways to gain self-efﬁcacy.

For example, the experience of entrepreneurial success can inspire entrepreneurial
motivation, improve entrepreneurial capacity, and cultivate entrepreneurial self-
efﬁcacy. Second, entrepreneurs should learn from the entrepreneurial experiences
of others’ successful benchmarking in order to enhance their entrepreneurial moti-
vation and improve their entrepreneurial self-efﬁcacy. Third, entrepreneurs should
make good use of various social services provided by intermediaries and some
service platforms, including venture capital, information consulting, business train-
ing, business guidance, and other types of assistance.
2.4
Warmth
Warmth is deﬁned as an emotional and psychological reaction to actively commu-
nicating with others (Bernritter et al. 2016). It tests a person’s attitude regarding
their interactions with others, whether they are willing to interact with people, and
whether they are enthusiastic in the interpersonal process.
2.4.1
The Impact of Entrepreneurial Warmth on New Venture Growth
Entrepreneurship requires dealing with various types of people. Entrepreneurs with
a high level of warmth are outgoing, warm, and cheerful, and they are kind and
friendly. Given that warmth is a signiﬁcant driver of consumer satisfaction, loyalty,
and retention (Cuddy et al. 2011; Rust and Zahorik 1993), entrepreneurs with
warmth can thus easily curry the favor of customers, and have the strong ability
for cooperation and are adaptable to new situations. In addition, entrepreneurs with
a high level of warmth can actively take care of their employees, which help them
win the respect of their workers, and form positive, harmonious interpersonal
relationships with them.

2.4.2
The Management of Entrepreneurial Warmth
It is necessary to consciously cultivate warmth to promote entrepreneurs’ growth.
Here, entrepreneurs should review the following recommendations (Fig. 6). First,
entrepreneurs need to strengthen their ability to improve their self-awareness of
interpersonal relationships. Second, entrepreneurs should actively use positive self-
suggestions. If a person is always speaking negatively internally, they can easily fall
into a vicious circle. Contrarily, if an entrepreneur repeats “I can” (instead of “I
cannot”) to motivate themselves, this bolsters their self-conﬁdence. Third, entre-
preneurs should improve their communication skills; this includes creating a list of
communication situations and communication objects, evaluating their communi-
cation methods, and making, implementing, and monitoring communication plans.
Finally, entrepreneurs should learn to smile more and listen more attentively. Facial
expression is an important messenger in communications, and both smiling and
listening can improve an entrepreneur’s interpersonal relationships with their
employees and business partners.
3
Negative Personality
Negative personality traits are those traits that tend to cause personality disorders
under stress or in moments of crisis. Negative personality traits also have a great
impact on entrepreneurs’ decision-making processes, for example, when making
wrong judgments or bad decisions regarding future opportunities. Some scholars

have examined the dark side of personality and have noted that it is closely related
to the failure of new businesses (e.g., Furnham et al. 2013; Palaiou and Furnham
2014). This chapter will explore the impact of negative entrepreneurial personality
traits, including narcissism, overconﬁdence, and the fear of failure, on new ven-
tures’ growth.
3.1
Narcissism
Narcissism is deﬁned as excessive self-love, admiration, and exaggerated attention
to the self (Guedes 2017). Narcissists who tend to show absolute self-conﬁdence as
well as excessive self-admiration (Resick et al. 2009), highly value their worth and
accomplishments and are obsessed with power and recognition (Kashima et al.
2002; Tamborski et al. 2012). In addition, narcissists are also attracted to the idea of
reaching a level of celebrity (Young and Pinsky 2006) and ﬁnd tasks that support
their feelings of superiority (Morf et al. 2000). Moreover, as Foster et al. (2009)
have indicated, narcissistic individuals are more prone to risk-taking, and they
differ from non-narcissistic individuals in that they perceive greater beneﬁts deriv-
ing from risky behaviors.
3.1.1
The Impact of Entrepreneurial Narcissism on New Venture
Growth
Scholars have not yet formed a uniﬁed opinion on the role of narcissism as it
pertains to new ventures. Some believe that entrepreneurial narcissism has a
positive role in promoting new businesses because they think narcissistic entrepre-
neurs tend to show strong social skills, vision, and personal charisma. These
researchers generally believe that narcissistic entrepreneurs have good communi-
cation skills (King 2007; Rosenthal and Pittinsky 2006). They can inﬂuence people
and make others accept their vision of the organization, thus creating strong
performance for their companies. In addition, some researchers believe that narcis-
sistic managers can enhance organizational cohesion, as they can apply their
personal charm as needed (Deluga 1997). However, other scholars believe that
entrepreneurial narcissism has an adverse effect on the growth of new ventures
(e.g., Campbell et al. 2000). First, they ﬁnd that narcissists are primarily motivated
by the quest for leadership, allowing them to meet their needs and aspirations by
gaining power (Glad 2002), thus their decisions are difﬁcult to gain the approval of
employees. Second, in team situations, narcissists tend to overestimate their own
contributions and ignore those of others (Campbell et al. 2000), which makes it
difﬁcult for them to maintain relationships with others (Morf and Rhodewalt 2001).

3.1.2
The Management of Entrepreneurial Narcissism
Although de Vries and Miller (1985) have indicated that narcissism is the most
common feature of leadership, as it drives leaders to pursue power and inﬂuence, if
entrepreneurs are not able to grasp their own degree of narcissism, it can have a
negative impact on new venture growth. Therefore, entrepreneurs can manage their
narcissistic personalities using the following suggestions (Fig. 7). First, an entre-
preneur should overcome their “entrepreneurial narcissism” by listening to the wide
variety of opinions of others, such as partners, employees, and peers. Second, an
entrepreneur should attempt to balance their level of narcissism. Moderate narcis-
sism is not a bad thing for an entrepreneur. However, with a high level of
narcissism, it is easy to exaggerate one’s own advantages and to ignore the role
of others, which may negatively affect teamwork and cohesion in their companies.
3.2
Overconﬁdence
Overconﬁdence is the possession of inaccurate, overly positive perceptions of one’s
abilities or knowledge (Moore and Healy 2008). Prior work has suggested that
highly conﬁdent individuals attain higher status (Kennedy et al. 2013).
3.2.1
The Impact of Entrepreneurial Overconﬁdence on New Venture
Growth
Although prior research has suggested that overconﬁdence confers a higher social
status (Kennedy et al. 2013), entrepreneurs with overconﬁdence are easily confused
by false positive messages, and even ignoring possible deviations (Gibson and
Sanbonmatsu 2004). This would be more apparent for start-ups under uncertain
environmental
conditions
(Hayward
et
al.
2006).

entrepreneurs overestimate their knowledge, predictions, and personal abilities, and
thus, the probability of failure becomes higher when facing potential opportunities
(Bernardo and Welch 2001). In addition, an entrepreneur’s overconﬁdence can
easily lead to the blindness of investment (Segerstrom and Nes 2006). Some
previous studies have also shown that entrepreneurs’ overconﬁdence was nega-
tively correlated with the survival rate of start-ups (Koellinger et al. 2007). Overall,
overconﬁdence can interfere with entrepreneurs’ rational judgments and decision-
making, which can lead to the failure of start-ups (Åstebro 2003).
3.2.2
The Management of Entrepreneurial Overconﬁdence
It is important for entrepreneurs to manage their feelings of overconﬁdence, which
can be accomplished using the following steps (Fig. 8). First, entrepreneurs need to
gain more experience. Some studies have indicated that a person’s level of
overconﬁdence will decrease as their experience increases (Hayward et al. 2006;
Van de Venter and Michayluk 2008). Therefore, entrepreneurs need to listen and
learn more from others to accumulate greater experience. Second, Winkler and
Poses (1993) have noted that when individuals lack comprehensive and accurate
feedback regarding decision-making, their overconﬁdence increases. Hence, entre-
preneurs need to evaluate events objectively. Third, because an individual’s cultural
environment is also an important factor that can affect their overconﬁdence,
shaping good company culture with a moderate level of conﬁdence and with
objective evaluations is paramount.

3.3
Fear of Failure
Since the essence of entrepreneurship is closely tied to uncertainty and risk-taking,
an individual’s fear of failure is a potent factor that can inhibit entrepreneurial entry
(Caliendo et al. 2009). The individual’s fear of failure is considered a self-
evaluative framework that inﬂuences how he or she deﬁnes, orients to, and expe-
riences failure in achievement situations (Heckhausen 1991).
3.3.1
The Impact of Entrepreneurial Fear of Failure on New Venture
Growth
The fear of failure has attracted considerable attention in the entrepreneurship
literature (e.g., Cacciotti et al. 2016; Morgan and Sisak 2016). Individuals who
are prone to the fear of failure are always trying to avoid failure rather than trying to
succeed (Atkinson 1957). Kollmann et al. (2017) have argued that fear of failure in
entrepreneurs is a key to understanding individuals’ withdrawal from entrepreneur-
ial activities. In addition, the fear of fear is often accompanied by lower self-
efﬁcacy. For example, Bandura and Locke (2003) have indicated that constant
failure can lead individuals to lower their goals and reduce their self-efﬁcacy. In
addition, it has also been shown that fear of failure perceptions negatively inﬂuence
entrepreneurship as an occupation choice (Arenius and Minniti 2005). Overall, the
fear of failure has a central inﬂuence on individuals’ achievement motivation and
their occupational aspirations (Burnstein 1963). Hence, entrepreneurs with a high
fear of failure tend to doubt their abilities, rarely set goals, and choose low-risk
tasks because there is a smaller chance of failure, which, of course, is not conducive
to new venture growth.
3.3.2
The Management of Entrepreneurial Fear of Failure
Overcoming an excessive fear of failure is an essential task of entrepreneurs. Here,
training is needed using the following concepts (Fig. 9). First, given that when goals
are difﬁcult to achieve, this may generate discouragement and reduce motivation
(Baron et al. 2016), entrepreneurs should set speciﬁc, attainable goals for daily,
weekly, and monthly periods. This will allow them to be better organized and to
help them overcome their fear of failure. Second, entrepreneurs should learn how to
reduce the amount of pressure they feel, and arrange their own time so as to
maintain entrepreneurial passion. Finally, entrepreneurs should believe in them-
selves and not lose conﬁdence in their own knowledge and abilities. Entrepreneurs
who lack conﬁdence will shape a failed image of themselves; for instance, when
faced with difﬁculties or challenges, they can overestimate those difﬁculties,
creating a situation where they are more likely to fail.

Conclusion
In this chapter, we present a challenge for future researchers to build a stronger,
more complete understanding of the role of the entrepreneurial personality. We ﬁnd
that positive entrepreneurial personality traits enable young companies to continue
to innovate, open up new territory, and venture forth, even after having achieved
success. Meanwhile, negative entrepreneurial personality traits make entrepreneurs
ignore the impact of the environment and overestimate their abilities, which can
easily lead to the failure of young companies. It should be noted that the inﬂuence
of a particular entrepreneurial personality on a new venture is not an absolute, and
we welcome many viewpoints. Overall, cultivating positive personality traits and
managing negative ones are necessary for entrepreneurs in the process of
entrepreneurship.
Thus, our ﬁndings present some theoretical contributions and practical implica-
tions. The ﬁrst contribution is that we divide the entrepreneurial personality into
positive personality traits and negative personality traits, and systematically
analyze their constituent elements, which provide a sharper theoretical framework
for the research of entrepreneurial personality. Moreover, we analyze the factors
impacting the entrepreneurial personality, which deepen the application of person-
ality theory in the ﬁeld of entrepreneurship. Therefore, we suggest that entrepre-
neurs should actively cultivate positive personality traits and manage their negative
personality traits effectively.
However, several limitations also need to be addressed. One limitation is that we
only analyze the impact of personality traits of entrepreneurs on new ventures using
the method of qualitative analysis. Future research need to use the empirical data or
the method of meta-analysis to further verify our arguments. Moreover, we only
discuss seven personality traits of entrepreneurs. However, there are other person-
ality traits such as conscientiousness, passion, self-control, irresponsibility, or

hubris that also may inﬂuence new ventures’ growth. Future research may explore
more personality traits to provide a more complete understanding of how entrepre-
neurial personality affects new ventures’ survival and growth.

Intrapreneurs: Characteristics and Behavior
Antonia Mohedano-Suanes and Dolores Garzo´n Benı´tez
Abstract Intrapreneurship has become a relevant topic in literature as far as its
impact on organizational performance is more and more often highlighted from
very diverse points of view. The main goal of this chapter is introducing the speciﬁc
personal and professional proﬁle of intrapreneurs, considered as highly committed
individuals motivated by innovation, continuous improvement and able to leader
teams in the direction they foresee within the companies in which they work. This
chapter will present the relevance and impact of intrapreneurship, the role and main
characteristics of the intrapreneurs, their behavior and motivations, and ﬁnally
some good practices will be exposed in order to encourage intrapreneurship within
organizations.

Introduction
Entrepreneurship is related to the so called entrepreneurs, who independently
assume the risk of creating and managing a company, but it’s also a concept related
to intra entrepreneurs or intrapreneurs, employees in already existing companies,
who actively participate in the identiﬁcation and exploitation of business ideas for
the organization in which they work (Bosma et al. 2013). Indeed, corporate
entrepreneurship or intrapreneurship is settled on the idea of the intrapreneur.
In words of authors like Collins and Moore (1970), Zahra (1995, 1996) or
Sharma and Chrisman (1999), through the process of intrapreneurship, the intra-
preneurs impulse: Corporate venturing, Strategic renewal and/or Innovation. Fol-
lowing Sharma and Chrisman (1999), Corporate venturing implies the development
of new corporate activities either creating new organizational entities (internal) or
not (external). In the ﬁrst case the new activity is inserted in one of the business
units or creating a subsidiary one. In the second case, when external, the new

activity is developed through an autonomous or semi-autonomous entity separated
from the organization (joint ventures, spin-offs, or venture capital initiatives).
Strategic renewal consists on modifying organization’s business or corporate
level strategy or structure. Renewal activities reside within an existing organization
and are not treated as new businesses by the organization. The main difference
between corporate venturing and strategic renewal is that: “. . .corporate venturing
involves the creation of new businesses whereas strategic renewal leads to the
reconﬁguration of existing businesses within a corporate setting” (Sharma and
Chrisman 1999: 19). Innovation means “creating and introducing new products,
production processes, and organizational systems” (Zahra 1996: 1715). Innovation
is considered a sufﬁcient condition for intrapreneurship, but not a necessary con-
dition, since both corporate venturing and strategic renewal can exist without
innovation (Sharma and Chrisman 1999).
Intrapreneurship stands as a key aspect for the success and survival of companies
(De Pablo 2015) surrounded by technological and social dynamism, the challenges
of environmental care and the turbulence of ﬁnancial markets. Some research
provide evidence of the positive relationship between intrapreneurship and organi-
zational performance in terms of higher customer satisfaction (Agca et al. 2012),
higher shareholder value or earnings per share (Zahra 1993; Zahra et al. 1999;
Salimath et al. 2008; Bierwerth et al. 2015), higher proﬁtability of sales (Zahra and
Covin 1995; Zahra et al. 2000), better positioning against competitors (Simsek and
Heavey 2011), increased market share and increased company size (Antoncic and
Hisrich 2004; Felicio et al. 2012), or overall management satisfaction with com-
pany performance (Bierwerth et al. 2015), among other advantages. Furthermore,
Other works show that the effect of intrapreneurship on the performance of the
company is reinforced in the long term (Zahra and Covin 1995; Wiklund and
Shepherd 2003; Huse et al. 2005; Felicio et al. 2012).
Intrapreneurs allow their organizations to achieve the above mentioned advan-
tages because they are an adequate channel to contribute and implement new ideas;
act as catalysts, promoters and participate in the various activities of an innovation
program; promote change in behavior and skills throughout the organization;
promote cultural change in the organization; make it possible to keep an
intrapreneurship program active and to signal to customers, partners and investors
the innovative proﬁle of the organization, increasing its reputation; and intrapre-
neurial efforts engage those key employees and drive them additional value from
them (Ferrier 2015).
Therefore, identifying intrapreneurs among their employees becomes especially
critical for organizations to motivate and support them in order to retain them in the
company, and also to create a high performance working environment to strengthen
the company’s competitiveness (Kuratko and Hodgetts 2001).
Following, will go through these different ﬁelds: the main characteristics that
deﬁne an intrapreneur’s behavior as a leader, the practices that organizations can
carry out to motivate and retain intrapreneurs, and the main conclusions drawn from
the analysis.

2
The Characteristics of the Intrapreneur
In words of Kuratko and Hodgetts (2001), intrapreneurs are not necessarily
“genious.” They are individuals with an average or slightly above average intelli-
gence rate. As explained below, successful intrapreneurs are characterized by the
following traits: visionary and willing to tackle the status quo; know the internal
and external organizational environment; strongly committed to their organization;
are sincere and persevering; skilled negotiators; diplomatic and able to lead cross-
functional teams; good communicators; visual thinking ability; take calculated
risks; and high levels of self-efﬁcacy.
The intrapreneur is a “visionary” leader, always looking for ways to do things
better, trying to anticipate the future. Intrapreneurs are continually searching for
new opportunities (Morris et al. 2010).
An intrapreneur needs to understand both the external environment in which the
organization operates, and the internal environment. Launching a new product can
be difﬁcult in an organizational environment that follows a strict policy, that is,
highly bureaucratized, or when the new project must pass through an approval
processes (Hornsby et al. 2002). For this reason, it’s crucial for the intrapreneur to
know the organizational culture, the management structure, the behavior and
motivations of his/her colleagues, among other internal variables, and therefore
overcome the barriers of an excessively bureaucratized organization. Successful
intrapreneurs are especially adept at navigating between the bureaucratic and
political inertia of the organization (Ireland et al. 2006; Govindarajan and Desai
2013).
Intrapreneurs are highly committed in their company, sincere and highly con-
sistent in their work and their interactions. Learning is also a key issue for them
(Govindarajan and Desai 2013).
In addition to being sincere, the intrapreneur in general, shares merits and
recognition with the rest of the personnel involved in the project. This allows him
to build a coalition of trusted advisors and supporters within the organization
(Morris et al. 2010) that will, in turn, help to persevere against obstacles and
adversity (Quast 2011).
It also becomes necessary that intrapreneurs have negotiating skills because
resources are always scarce in a company and he/she will have to convince others
to invest in a certain project instead of allocating budget to R&D, advertising,
design, etc. The intrapreneur must know how to negotiate the budget amount and
probably compete internally for the allocation of resources to other projects within
the organization (Miller 2014).
In coordinated companies, new ideas should be discussed with employees who
may know different aspects of the problem to be solved in order to develop a better
solution. Introducing an innovation in the market often requires knowledge and
skills of employees from different departments, so the intrapreneur requires high
levels of diplomacy and ability to stimulate and direct the work of multidisciplinary
teams (Morris et al. 2010).
Intrapreneurs: Characteristics and Behavior
111

Intrapreneurs are often good communicators and have social abilities. An intra-
preneur knows how to sell an idea (Hender 2003).
Visual thinking is another of the intrapreneur’s characteristic abilities. That is,
the ability to combine brainstorming, mind mapping and design thinking. Once they
have an idea they do not stick with the ﬁrst alternative they come up with to
implement it. For intrapreneurs it is also challenging to ﬁnd the best solution to a
problem after a mental visualization process of different alternative solutions
(Govindarajan and Desai 2013).
They do not make their ideas public immediately. They mature ideas and keep
them secret until they are more developed, thus protecting them from potential
opponents (Govindarajan and Desai 2013).
Another key psyche dimension of the intrapreneurs is risk-taking propensity.
Risk-taking refers to “. . .the perceived possibility of receiving the rewards associ-
ated with success of a proposed situation, which is required by an individual before
he will subject himself to the consequences associated with failure, the alternative
situation providing less reward as well as less severe consequence than the pro-
posed situation” (Brockhaus 1980: 513). Unlike entrepreneurs who risk their
money, intrapreneurs risk the resources of their organization and those of their
shareholders, so they tend to take moderate and calculated risks (Morris and Trotter
1990).
The intrapreneur works under pressure of uncertainty, risk and time pressure
(Barbosa et al. 2007). Intrapreneurs face these adverse circumstances, because they
are characterized by high levels of self-efﬁcacy. Self-efﬁcacy is one of the main
psychological variables in the analysis of entrepreneurial behavior, because of its
predictive power over entrepreneurial intent (Zhao et al. 2005) and because it
distinguishes between entrepreneurs and intrapreneurs from those who are not
(Chen et al. 1998). Self-efﬁcacy refers to individuals’ perception of their capacity
to perform certain tasks. Individuals with high levels of self-efﬁcacy perform better
the tasks they must, they are persistent even in adversity, and are better able to cope
with situations of change (Bandura 1977).
3
The Intrapreneurial Behavior
The intrapreneurial behavior becomes relevant as it provides a new facet of
leadership. While the traditional leader sits on the known, plays it safe, relies on
past experience, needs detailed information to decide, tries to minimize risks, and
asks the organization for the resources it needs; The leadership of the intrapreneur
relies on the unknown, taking calculated risks, experimenting, harnessing the
knowledge that is possessed, seeking the maximization of value and the optimiza-
tion of available resources. Furthermore, the intrapreneurial leader makes decisions
differently. They try to understand complexity rather than set out to simplify reality
quickly. They make decisions with data enough, assume calculated risks and, if
necessary, change directions when new information is available (Foley 2015).
112
A. Mohedano-Suanes and D. Garzo´n Benı´tez

Intrapreneurs are open, transparent and committed to driving the success of their
organizations. Their behavior in the organization shows conﬁdence, commitment
and courage when facing adverse circumstances (Kuratko 1993; Stopford and
Baden-Fuller 1994). Through their performance, they develop a new working
environment in which other employees feel motivated by purpose and value rather
than money (Morris et al. 2010; Govindarajan and Desai 2013).
They search for good ideas to develop in their companies, but also to start
projects whose objective is that products, whether new or improvements of the
existing ones, can better cover the needs of the customers. To this end, they
sometimes cooperate with clients through co-creation processes (Hender 2003).
Furthermore, intrapreneurs are often confronted with resistance to change
(Drucker 2010). They are highly engaged change agents (Govindarajan and Desai
2013) and contribute to building a ﬂexible, adaptive and enterprising organizational
culture (Foley 2015). Intrapreneurs handle uncertainty well and have the ability to
work in unprogrammed and unpredictable environments (Hender 2003), while at
the same time optimize organizational resources (Foley 2015). They make their
ideas public when they are sure they are viable (Govindarajan and Desai 2013).

Organizational Practices That Encourage
Intrapreneurship
Previous literature has identiﬁed several practices that an organization can use in
order to encourage intrapreneurship: An adequate system of rewards; a good
intrapreneurship support program; management support, especially from middle
managers; freedom and independence to implement a new project; error tolerance;
time to develop new ideas; transparency and open communication; and training
programs.
Those organizations with an intrapreneurial oriented culture are more likely to
attract and retain the most talented employees (Morris et al. 2010). Sometimes, the
intrapreneur has to face strong values, beliefs and organizational practices that can
be demotivating. However, it is possible to stimulate change in organizational
culture in such a way that creates a context that favors intrapreneurship. This
process, which can be complex and time-consuming, can be favored by manage-
ment by introducing practices that stimulate the trust, respect, and appreciation of
the efforts of intrapreneurs (Kuratko et al. 2014).
An intrapreneurship oriented policy increases the intrapreneur’s satisfaction and
contributes to increased his/her loyalty (Antoncic and Antoncic 2011) as well as
social identity or sense of belonging and commitment to the organization (Ashforth
and Mael 1989; Van Knippenberg and Van Shie 2000; Moriano et al. 2009).
Intrapreneurs have high internal locus of control gives them self-conﬁdence and
makes them feel responsible for what they do (Morris et al. 2010).
Intrapreneurs: Characteristics and Behavior
113

Performance-based rewards encourage the intrapreneur to face new challenges
and reinforce satisfaction with signiﬁcant achievements (Sykes 1992; Barringer and
Milkovich 1998; Kuratko et al. 2005). When the intrapreneur is aware of making a
signiﬁcant contribution to the organization while pursuing his/her own vision at
work, there can be a great increase in job satisfaction, to build credibility, and
strengthen self-conﬁdence (Miller 2014).
About 70% of successful entrepreneurs got their business idea while working for
a previous employer (Chamorro-Premuzic 2012). Nevertheless, many successful
businesses have been created by people who had a promising idea while working in
an organization where they did not have a good intrapreneurship support program
or had none at all (Govindarajan and Desai 2013). Managers must beneﬁt from the
talent of all employees, stimulate their creativity and be aware that brilliant ideas
and innovation can emerge anywhere in the organization (Coulombe 2016).
Management support is a key element as it must provide the intrapreneur with
the means and resources necessary for the development and implementation of
his/her ideas (Stevenson and Jarillo 1990; Kuratko et al. 1993, 2014). This support
can be channeled through different practices such as providing necessary resources
or expertise championing innovative ideas, or institutionalizing the entrepreneurial
activity within the ﬁrm’s system and processes (Hornsby et al. 2002). In particular,
middle managers play a key role in creating an environment that encourages
intrapreneurship (Wooldridge and Floyd 1990; Floyd and Woolridge 1992, 1994;
Ginsberg and Hay 1994; Pearce et al. 1997; Hornsby et al. 2002; Kuratko 1993;
Stopford and Baden-Fuller 1994).
The freedom to implement a new project in the organization and the recognition
of his/her performance are two important motivating factors for the intrapreneur,
even more than economic rewards (Govindarajan and Desai 2013). These variables,
in their condition of motivating factors, also mean a difference between entrepre-
neurs and intrapreneurs. The intrapreneur does not assume the same economic risk
as the entrepreneur, who can get a greater reward for the risk assumed with high
proﬁts when the business is successful. Although economic rewards motivate the
intrapreneur (for example through a raise of salary, bonuses, etc.), however, they
consider more important the recognition of their merits within their organization
(for example becoming the center of attention in a meeting, having a meal with the
CEO, mentioning their successful projects in internal circulars, among other forms
of recognition) (Hisrich 1990; Miller 2014).
Independence for implementing a project becomes an important stimulus for
both entrepreneurs and intrapreneurs. However, the intrapreneur is limited in
his/her ability to act by the policies and procedures established by his/her organi-
zation. In this case, in order to avoid discouragement and frustration, a good
intrapreneurship program would give as much freedom as possible to the intrapre-
neur, considering that the organization must also clearly establish limits in terms of
budget, responsibility for decision making and scope or span of control (Miller
2014).
Error tolerance is also an important element (Zahra et al. 1999; Kuratko et al.
2014). Organizations will encourage intrapreneurship if they do not punish honest
114
A. Mohedano-Suanes and D. Garzo´n Benı´tez

failure, that is, the failure of those projects in which the intrapreneur has concen-
trated a great effort but have failed for reasons beyond his/her control (Nielsen et al.
1985).
Organizations should also allow time for intrapreneurs to take the time to look
for new ideas, or to modify, if necessary, established procedures while they’re
working (Covin and Slevin 1991; Kuratko et al. 2014). This issue is an important
factor in achieving the commitment and satisfaction of the intrapreneur, since the
intrapreneur needs time to develop his ideas (Buekens 2014).
Transparency is another key aspect. The intrapreneur will feel free to propose an
idea if the organizational environment recognizes the authorship of the idea at all
stages of project development. Furthermore, it is essential to establish systems and
procedures so that new ideas can be evaluated, selected and developed effectively
(Kuratko et al. 1993; Ferrier 2015). These systems should be transparent so that
intrepreneurs can clearly understand why their idea is accepted or not (Buekens
2014). Open communication is also an important element as a way of sharing
information in quantity and quality and to promote learning, particularly for those
organizations that want to enhance innovation (Zahra 1991).
Previous literature indicates that some of the characteristics of intrapreneurs can
be stimulated through training programs (Kuratko and Hodgetts 2001). Since
intrapreneurs often work with multidisciplinary teams, it is necessary that their
training programs foster the necessary skills so that, on the one hand the intrapre-
neur can empower, motivate and get the commitment of the team members, and on
the other one can improve how to manage their diversity and complexity. Further-
more, skills on using external environment forecasting tools are critical to antici-
pate trends and changes in the industry, especially in hostile environments. Training
programs should be oriented towards the development of these skills (Zahra 1991).
In a company, there are many activities in which intrapreneurs can suggest and
launch improvements. Following, there are ﬁve well known examples of successful
intrapreneurship related to products:
•
3M—The Post-It Note
3M was a pioneer enhancing creativity within their employees by letting them
develop new ideas and projects during 15% of their work time developing new
projects. Among them, one of 3M’s scientists developed a more user-friendly
adhesive and 5 years later, another colleague at 3M, evidenced that the sticky
solution could be very useful in daily life to solve different issues as bookmarks
falling out of reading books. The sticky solution became the well-known Post-it
Notes.
•
Facebook—‘Likes’
Liking a post or photograph on Facebook is a familiar action, but this wasn’t
an idea generated by Mark Zuckerberg and co; it came from their celebrated
‘hack-a-thons,’ where coders and engineers are given a platform to create and
develop ideas. It has been reaping the beneﬁts ever since because the social
network embraced a culture of intrapreneurship.

•
Google—Gmail
Google enhances intrapreneurship by offering their employees a 20%
timeframe on developing personal projects related to the business. A project
from one of the employees was the initial template for Gmail (particularly the
search function and increased storage capacity). Today, Gmail remains one of
the most widely-used email platforms on the web, driving key trafﬁc to Google’s
products.
•
DreamWorks
The animation company believes in the creativity and ideation of their
employees and reinforces them offering their employees free training on how
to write scripts, learn how to pitch . . . If their ideas achieve the required level,
employees can present them to the company’s real executive team to be
developed.
•
Sony—PlayStation
A Sony employee came up with the PlayStation when facing a personal issue.
He tried to make his daughter’s Nintendo console more powerful and user
friendly, and to do so he developed the original Sony PlayStation.
Without the adequate environments oriented to intrapreneurship and innovation,
all these ideas and many others would have never been successful.

Conclusions
The review of specialized literature has allowed us to identify the main character-
istics of the intrapreneurs, their behaviour and the practices that can help the
company to stimulate the commitment of its workers through entrepreneurial
activities. The positive impact that intrapreneurship has on company performance,
both in a short and a long term, turns intrapreneurial competences into a key
capability those managers must be able to stimulate and protect through appropriate
organizational policies. For this reason, the support of management, especially
middle managers, is crucial for the development of a culture oriented to innovation
and change, stimulating creativity in any part of the organization.
Intrapreneurs and entrepreneurs share many characteristics and both behaviours
are clearly guided by the achievement of challenges. However, there is an important
difference between them: intrapreneurs face the additional challenge of developing
their ideas within the framework of the rules and culture of the organization for
which they work. Therefore management must be aware that the organizational
structure is a factor that will condition the success or failure of intrapreneurship
initiatives.
Adopting an intrapreneurial culture is a great approach for the long term health
of a company as intrapreneurs are demonstrating through their actions that ideas
and innovation can come from anywhere within the company, they are transforming
organizations to be more entrepreneurial and more relevant in a rapidly changing
116

world. Therefore, it becomes a clever decision to embrace intrapreneurship and set
a vibrant intrapreneurial environment within the company giving freedom and time
to the employees to be creative, more innovative, productive, and engaged. This
way companies create a new type of working environment that retains talent and
helps employees feel more fulﬁlled.
As individuals, intrapreneurs have a high level of self-autonomy, are highly
motivated and viewed by others as a leader, not by what they say but what they do,
they are deﬁning a new face of leadership.
They are entrepreneurs within existing organizations, they have always been
pioneers, builders and change agents driving innovations, so managers must tackle
the challenge to identify, develop, motivate and retain them in the company.
In order to face the challenge, companies can implement varied good practices
fostering intrapreneurship, all of them related to concepts as time, trust, motivation,
communication, creativity, freedom and error tolerance.

Can Women Entrepreneurs Plan to Prosper?
Exploring the Role of Gender as a Moderator
of the Planning-Performance Relationship
Whitney O. Peake, William C. McDowell, Michael L. Harris,
and Phillip E. Davis
Abstract Women entrepreneurs have long been argued to suffer from disadvan-
tages in initial resource stock, which makes it difﬁcult to establish and maintain a
sustainable competitive advantage. Prior work suggests that planning may assist in
overcoming these disparities; however, few studies have examined these relation-
ships while considering context. We explore the role of strategic business planning
activities on entrepreneurial ﬁrm performance and whether such planning activities
yield greater beneﬁt for women than men. We ﬁnd that business planning provides
greater performance beneﬁts to women, which we argue may give women an
opportunity to compensate for initial resource disadvantages.

Introduction
Entrepreneurship is inherently gendered, and scholars appear to increasingly
appreciate gender explorations (Jennings and Brush 2013). These researchers are
working to resolve the extant literature’s relative lack of rigorous and meaningful
insights into the gendered issues within entrepreneurship generally (Kalnins
and Williams 2014) and the gender-performance relationship, speciﬁcally

(Mitchelmore and Rowley 2013). In the United States, this is a particularly impor-
tant issue, given that as of 2016, there were an estimated 11.3 million women-
owned businesses operating in the U.S., with the number of women-owned busi-
nesses increasing 45% between 2007 and 2016 (American Express 2016). This
ﬁgure is reportedly ﬁve times greater than the national average, while revenues of
women-owned businesses increased 35% since 2007, a full 30% higher than the
national average. Despite this positive trend, women-owned businesses are lower in
relative economic impact and generally report operating smaller businesses than
their male peers (American Express 2016), which suggests that some important
differences persist between men and women-owned businesses in the United States.
Prior research considering gender and entrepreneurship, has conﬁrmed that
women generally have lower access to several forms of capital, particularly ﬁnan-
cial capital (Bosse and Taylor 2012; Jennings and Brush 2013). In light of the
resource-based view of the ﬁrm (Barney 1991), this resource deﬁcit at start-up may
create pervasive and persistent difﬁculties for women in obtaining and/or
maintaining a sustainable competitive advantage. Some research purports that
planning assists in overcoming the capital deﬁcit and boosting the performance of
women-owned ventures (Lerner and Almor 2002), which aligns with the more
general literature centering on this relationship.
Strategic planning is widely recognized as a critical factor for business success
(Wang et al. 2007) and is generally believed to yield higher levels of ﬁrm performance
for SMEs across a variety of measures, such as sales growth (Dibrell et al. 2014),
return on assets (Dibrell et al. 2014), and proﬁtability (Becherer and Helms 2009).
However, a surprising number of entrepreneurs do not engage in strategic planning
practices, such as business planning. Despite the well-documented importance of
strategic planning for ﬁrm success, women are believed to engage in lower levels of
strategic planning (Lerner and Almor 2002), potentially due to the belief that women
hold goals that are broader and often noneconomic in nature (Jennings and Brush
2013). This makes better understanding the relationships among gender, planning, and
performance all the more critical. Framed in the resource-based view of the ﬁrm, we
attempt to overcome this prior limitation in the literature by analyzing the strategic
planning-performance relationship of 234 ﬁrms through a gender moderator lens.

Literature Review
2.1
Resource Based View and Strategic Planning
While many business strategy researchers focus on corporate strategy, others have
argued that strategic planning is even more critical for newer ﬁrms given their lack
of resources and resulting inability to weather business cycle interruptions (Porter
1991). Research of growth-oriented ﬁrms has shown a link between strategic
planning and organizational performance (Mazzarol et al. 2009). Business planning
122
W.O. Peake et al.

provides the framework for developing the strategic capabilities necessary for high
performance (Lerner and Almor 2002). The availability and use of resources within
SMEs have been directly linked to the strategic talents and skills of the business
owner (Runyan et al. 2006). Effective strategic planning can play a critical role in
both existing ﬁrm growth and new venture creation (Wiklund and Shepherd 2003),
and the quality of planning is often the direct result of business owners’ experiences
(Lumpkin et al. 2010).
West and Noel (2009) suggest that new venture planning includes knowledge
about opportunities within the marketplace and the strategic approach necessary to
take advantage of these opportunities. Some business owners focus more on
internal strategic planning that emphasizes product efﬁciency and innovation,
process reﬁnement, and ﬁnancial objectives (Gibson et al. 2011; Verheul et al.
2002). Conversely, other entrepreneurial businesses pursue more externally ori-
ented strategic planning aimed more at sales growth, marketing, and customer
service (Gibson et al. 2011; Kumar et al. 2001). Business owners must develop a
keen understanding of their business environment and capabilities, and use this
knowledge to adopt the most appropriate approach for strategic planning.
Business startups are ﬁlled with challenges and strategic planning can reduce
associated uncertainties (Gelderen et al. 2000) and overcome the liability of
newness (Aldrich 1999). Effective planning also shows that owners are dedicated
to starting the business and will be persistent in their efforts to develop the venture
(Liao and Gartner 2006). Speciﬁcally, Delmar and Shane (2003) found that plan-
ning had a positive effect on business development and progression through
identiﬁed milestones, especially during the ﬁrst 2 years of the business.
Generally, prior research has provided evidence that planning positively affects
newer ﬁrm performance. Effective planning can help better organize resources,
reduce uncertainty and provide realistic goals needed for business startup and
growth. However, questions of timing remain. For instance, does strategic planning
activities at start-up result in improved ﬁrm performance or do these activities
beneﬁt a ﬁrm more beyond start-up?
2.2
Women Business Owners and Strategic Planning
A U.S. federal government contracting program deﬁnes a business as a woman-
owned business if it meets all requirements to be classiﬁed as a small business and
has at least a 51% ownership position held by a woman. According to this
deﬁnition, women currently own 38% of businesses in the US (American Express
2016). In addition, female business owners have been reported to earn an average
income level that is 2.5 times the annual income and a net worth that was nearly six
times that of women who do not own their own business (U.S. Small Business
Administration, Ofﬁce of Advocacy 2001).
While female owned businesses currently only constitute 38% of the businesses
in the United States, they are a consistently growing small business owner
Can Women Entrepreneurs Plan to Prosper? Exploring the Role of Gender as a. . .
123

demographic, particularly with women of color (American Express 2016). There
are many reasons for this increase, such as federal procurement procedures that
provide preferential selection practices towards women owned ﬁrms (Reardon et al.
2007), changing personal goals of women in the workplace to desire more freedom
(Shabbir and Gregorio 1996), a greater sense of security (Shabbir and Gregorio
1996), and the continuing perception of a glass ceiling in the corporate workplace
(Gibson and Harris 2008).
Recent research has painted a very interesting and positive picture of the survival
rates of women-owned businesses. However, women-owned businesses often have
been found to underperform their male counterparts on a host of performance
measures (e.g., Fairlie and Robb 2009; Robb 2002) and these disparages in perfor-
mance have been linked to lower human capital for women entrepreneurs (Fairlie
and Robb 2009). Despite the tremendous growth in numbers and comparative
employment, the revenues generated by women-owned businesses has remained
constant at 4% over the last 20 years (American Express 2016).
Recent ﬁndings that women owned businesses provide a lower risk of ﬁrm
failure (Robinson 2007) and no closure disadvantage for women should create a
favorable environment for access to capital. It remains, however, that these business
owners are still less likely to receive ﬁnancing and the ﬁnancing amounts tend to be
lower than their male counterparts. In addition, they must contend with lower levels
of early startup capital (Carter and Rosa 1998), difﬁculty securing loans (Verheul
et al. 2002), less credit history (Shaw et al. 2001), and historically less managerial
and technical experience (Chaganti and Parasuraman 1996); thus, giving women a
lower initial resource stock and competitive disadvantage compared to ﬁrms with
greater resource endowments.
The efforts of strategic planning on the part of growth-oriented ﬁrm owners has
been previously thoroughly covered, and the beneﬁts of this planning can be para-
mount to business success (Mazzarol et al. 2009). However, the differences between
women and men small business owners in regards to access to resources and the
historical levels of managerial and technical experience can play a role in the success
of these businesses (Fairlie and Robb 2009). It is because of these differences in
access to resources and levels of experience that it is expected that women business
owners who actively engage in business strategic planning will be more likely to see
higher performance returns for their planning efforts than for men.

Methodology
3.1
Sample
Following the methods outlined by prior entrepreneurship researchers (e.g. Peake
et al. 2015; Srivastava and BarNir 2016), undergraduate students served as a point
of contact for the business owners participating in the study. Students received
124
W.O. Peake et al.

instruction related to the nature of the research and were informed that the
researchers would contact each respondent to ensure the survey had been completed
by the individual. A total of 345 completed surveys, representing a founding owner
or partner of the ﬁrm who remains active in decision making and day-to-day
operations, were returned over the course of a year.
The data were ﬁltered for the purposes of this study to ensure younger, employer
ﬁrms were represented in the sample. For the sample, we have approximately
62% men, with 67% indicating Caucasian, non-Hispanic as their ethnicity, 10%
indicating African American, and 10% indicating Caucasian, Hispanic as the
ethnicity best describing them. Approximately 41% of respondents had a bachelor’s
degree. Respondents indicated that approximately 41% of ﬁrms were registered as
sole proprietorships, 37% registered as LLCs, and the remaining 22% registered in
some other form. Nearly one-third of respondents were engaged in service ﬁrms,
14% in retail ﬁrms, and approximately 2% in manufacturing ﬁrms.
3.2
Measures
3.2.1
Dependent Variable
Respondents were asked to report how they believe their organization’s perfor-
mance over the past year relates to its closest competitors in seven areas: sales, cash
ﬂow, return on investments, proﬁt, quality of product/service, marketing activities,
and customer service. Each area was represented by a 5-point Likert-type scale.
Although these are self-reports of performance compared to competitors, this is
often a way in which business owners are asked to report their performance (Droge
et al. 2004). Self-reports of performance of this nature have been found to reﬂect
actual objective performance for the ﬁrm (Droge et al. 2004). The performance
items exhibited a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.77, which is within the acceptable range.
3.2.2
Independent Variable
Planning activity outcomes during the start-up process were examined as the
independent variable. Nine items, shown in Appendix, comprise the planning
activities measure. Respondents were asked to rate the importance of each of
these planning activities in starting their business on a 7-point Likert scale. These
items represent a range of planning activity outcomes from writing a business plan
to projecting ﬁnancial statements to utilizing the services of professionals. The
Cronbach’s alpha for these nine items is 0.81, within the acceptable range for
employment as a single item in our analyses. We averaged the nine planning
activities for each respondent, yielding an average planning activity level.

3.2.3
Moderating Variable
Given the purported differences between men’s and women’s propensity for plan-
ning (Lerner and Almor 2002) and reported performance (Robb 2002; Robinson
2007), we examine the moderating effect of gender on the planning-performance
relationship.
3.2.4
Control Variables
We include several control variables in our analyses in an attempt to isolate the
effect of planning on reported performance, and believe the joint consideration of
ﬁrm size, business age, level of family involvement, organizational structure, and
industry provide context for each respondent. Additionally, since goals of the ﬁrm
have been determined as an important component of planning activities (Peake and
Watson 2014), we include a binary variable in the analysis to account for whether
the respondent indicates the primary goal of the ﬁrm is proﬁt and growth (X ¼ 1) or
some other goal (X ¼ 0). Additionally, we control for reported level of effort
expended in order to attempt to separate the effort expended and the types/arrange-
ment of activities (planning independent variable) undertaken. In examining effort,
we asked respondents to indicate how much effort they used to convince six types
of stakeholders (lenders, family, government agencies, suppliers, customers, and
community leaders) that their business was legitimate on a 7-point Likert scale. The
effort across these six items was then averaged to create an average effort control.

Results
We examine any risk for common method bias via a Harman one-factor test. When
the regression variables were entered into an exploratory factor analysis, 9 factors
emerged with an eigenvalue greater than 1, with the ﬁrst accounting for less than
15% of the total variance. Both the results of our multicollinearity (Fox 1997) and
common method bias (Podsakoff et al. 2003) analyses suggest our data are not
limited by these potential issues. See Table 1 for the means, standard deviations,
and correlations of the variables employed in our analyses.
In alignment with prior literature, our ﬁrst question seeks to understand if higher
levels of planning activities will positively impact performance. Our analysis
suggests that this relationship does exist (β ¼ 0.168, p < 0.01). Although gender
itself does not pose a direct effect on performance, gender does appear to play a
moderating role in this relationship. Our ﬁndings show that in our sample, the
interaction between gender (male) and level of planning exhibits a negative and
signiﬁcant impact on performance (β ¼ 0.155, p < 0.05); thus, our results show
that gender does impact the relationship between strategic planning and ﬁrm
performance (Table 2).

To more clearly examine this relationship, a plot of the interaction is available in
Fig. 1. At low levels of planning, women report lower performance than men. As
planning levels increase, men report relatively stable levels of performance. How-
ever, women appear to report greater beneﬁts from the planning/performance
relationship, since for higher levels of planning activity, women report greater
levels of ﬁrm performance.
In addition, the size of the ﬁrm appears to hold a signiﬁcant association with
performance. To examine the robustness of the results of our analyses, we

constrained our sample to employer ﬁrms with 100 or fewer employees and then to
50 or fewer employees as the “small” ﬁrm threshold. Our results are robust to both
speciﬁcations, with the planning and moderation effect exhibiting signiﬁcance at
the same levels.

Discussion and Implications
Our analyses demonstrate the existence of the planning-performance link within
our sample of 234 SMEs, and suggest that women may experience greater perfor-
mance beneﬁts from planning than men do at comparable levels. Since we con-
trolled for effort, ﬁrm goals, and several other important contextual factors in our
analyses, our results suggest there are important performance effects attributed to
planning, particularly for women-owned businesses. We believe these ﬁndings hold
several important academic and practical implications.
5.1
Academic Implications
A review of our work suggests that women and men do not signiﬁcantly differ in
their direct effects for the planning-performance relationship. However, our indi-
rect effects hold several implications for academics as we further probe this
relationship. Post-hoc analyses via t-tests indicate that men and women did not
report signiﬁcant differences in either planning activity engagement (t ¼ 0.94, ns)
or performance levels (t ¼ 1.23, ns). Although our direct effects were relatively
uninteresting in revealing any gender differences, the indirect effects assist in
theory-building related to gender and human capital. Researchers have long
lamented the human capital resource gap between men and women entrepreneurs
(Fairlie and Robb 2009), and lack of credit availability (Carter and Rosa 1998;
Verheul et al. 2002), business experience (Chaganti and Parasuraman 1996), and
women’s more lifestyle-oriented business goals (Shabbir and Gregorio 1996) have
been credited with lower levels of success for women owned ﬁrms. Our results
suggest that when effort level and primary goal of the ﬁrm are controlled for,
women may be able to ﬁll this human, ﬁnancial, and social capital resource gap
with planning, and that their beneﬁts to performance from higher levels of strategic
planning may play a compensatory role in this process.
Although individual results vary over time, in the aggregate, it appears that both
planning outcomes and processes yield beneﬁts to entrepreneurial ﬁrm performance
(Brinckmann et al. 2010; Mazzarol et al. 2009). Prior research has found strategic
business planning to play a critical role both in spurring existing ﬁrm growth and in
stimulating new venture creation (Wiklund and Shepherd 2003), as well as facili-
tating entrepreneurial intentions and ﬁrm performance (Liao and Gartner 2006).
Our ﬁndings conﬁrm the outcome-oriented planning results, and build on this

literature by exploring planning as a multi-faceted phenomenon. Research shows
that experienced business owners create internal processes that promote more
efﬁcient business practices, which are focused on ﬁnancial outcomes (Edelman
et al. 2005). Lack of experience is frequently cited as a primary culprit of business
failure (Ritholtz 2012); thus, our results are important as they conﬁrm the long-held
belief that planning improves the efﬁciency of the internal processes of the ﬁrm, and
reduces the likelihood of failure through the establishment of a sustainable com-
petitive advantage. We believe our multi-faceted planning dimension makes an
important contribution to the further exploration of the planning-performance
relationship, given its consideration to the psychological separation between start-
up and current performance.
5.2
Practical Implications
This chapter suggests that greater involvement in a variety of planning activities
yields higher levels of performance for ﬁrms within our sample. With the demon-
strated importance of planning in our study, we believe the importance of small
business development and innovation centers are highlighted. A better understand-
ing of the strategies and techniques utilized by successful small business owners
can contribute to both the research realm and the ability of policymakers and
services providers to support this important constituency as an engine of economic
growth. Our business planning measure is based on a number of activities targeted
at different areas of the ﬁrm’s operations. These activities both promote greater
understanding of the ﬁrm and its processes and generate legitimacy with external
stakeholders, which assists ﬁrms in overcoming liabilities of newness (Aldrich
1999). Researchers have acknowledged the importance of strategic business plan-
ning in overcoming the challenges and related uncertainties in starting and operat-
ing a small business (Gelderen et al. 2000). The results related to our planning
measure promote particular activities at start-up that lead to improved ﬁrm perfor-
mance. Both policymakers and practitioners can beneﬁt from better understanding
key planning drivers of enhanced small business performance.
Additionally, our results related to gender and planning hold important implica-
tions for various stakeholders. Targeted programs for women owned businesses
have gained traction over time, and our analyses suggest that these may be well-
placed. Women have been argued to hold resource disadvantages when compared
to their male peers (Robb 2013). Our results indicate that planning is an important
aspect for women owned businesses, and that planning programs targeted at human
capital building for women may help them overcome ﬁnancial and social barriers to
small business entry. Small business development centers may be able to assist
women-owned businesses via targeted planning workshops for nascent and new
entrepreneurs.

Conclusions and Future Research
We believe this chapter will serve as a foundation for additional research in this
area. Although we believe our planning variable to yield important insights, future
research may beneﬁt from determining whether speciﬁc planning activities matter
more than others, or if activities targeted at one operational aspect yield more
beneﬁts than other areas. This may be particularly insightful in further probing the
gender relationship discussed in this chapter. Aligned with future measure consid-
eration, exploring individual levels of speciﬁc performance or widening the breadth
of performance may be helpful in differentiating topline and bottom line impacts
from planning.
Although the planning-performance relationship for entrepreneurs and their
organizations has often come under debate, generally researchers have shown
both planning outcomes and processes to serve as important elements of heightened
ﬁrm performance (Brinckmann et al. 2010). The effects of gender on this relation-
ship, however, are less clear, given women’s resource constraints in business
ownership. Women have often been argued to suffer disadvantages in starting
human and ﬁnancial capital; however, whether these initial disadvantages lead to
long term performance differences is inconclusive.
Our ﬁndings suggest that our sample exhibits performance returns to planning,
and that planning returns are greater for women than for men. Such results suggest
that businesses reap beneﬁts from planning, and that planning programs targeted at
women may yield further beneﬁt to the performance of women-owned businesses.
We believe that this chapter raises additional research questions related to planning
and performance over a broader sample of both surviving and failed business
operations and across cultural contexts. Future studies can help develop a more
complete understanding of the role strategic planning in ﬁrm performance.

The Dark Side of Entrepreneurship
in Coworking-Spaces
Ricarda B. Bouncken, Mahmood M. Aslam, and Andreas J. Reuschl
Abstract Entrepreneurs act as an economic engine by creating new businesses and
new jobs, intensifying competition and enhancing productivity through creative and
novel methods of production and service delivery. Entrepreneurs are characterized
as unique personalities with the ability to innovate, start ﬁrms, create value,
proﬁtability and growth. Coworking-spaces provide a creative and innovative
atmosphere to entrepreneurs and working space to run their business operations
while interacting and collaborating with other entrepreneurs. However, the profes-
sional and social dynamics in coworking-spaces bear the risk of stress, exploitation,
conﬂicts and distrust, which negatively affect entrepreneurial self-efﬁcacy and
passion, undermining the advantages of coworking-spaces and leading to with-
drawal of entrepreneurs. We argue that coworking-spaces can support entrepre-
neurs in facing these challenges by developing entrepreneurial communities,
providing mentoring, coaching and social support to nascent entrepreneurs.

Introduction
Coworking-spaces (CWS) offer a novel concept for entrepreneurs (Cabral and
Winden 2016; Moriset 2014) by creating a community, based on shared values of
collaboration, openness, trust, accessibility, and sustainability (Capdevila 2014a;
Fuzi 2015; Waters-Lynch et al. 2016). The social and professional spaces in CWS
help entrepreneurs to interact, socialize (Bilandzic et al. 2013; Cabral and Winden
2016; Capdevila 2014b), build social ties for knowledge sharing, and to acquire
information (Gerdenitsch et al. 2016). Coworking-spaces connect entrepreneurs
from diverse backgrounds at one physical space (Spinuzzi 2012; Surman 2013) and
provide a creative and innovative space to entrepreneurs, who can perform their

business tasks in a professional ofﬁce environment while collaborating and
co-creating with others (Capdevila 2013; Spinuzzi 2012).
However, ‘dark’ personality traits of entrepreneurs (e.g. high need for control,
distrust, and desire for attention) cause difﬁculties in social and professional
interactions (Vries 1985, 2003). Entrepreneurs build relationships with powerful
individuals to improve their own position and to use opportunistic strategies (Morck
and Yeung 2003, 2004; Wright and Zahra 2011). Entrepreneurs continuously
pursue their personal and professional goals, however failure in achieving the
desired results cause stress, exhaustion and self-exploitation (McKenna 1996;
Osborne 1991). Studies also suggest that entrepreneurs don’t hesitate to exhibit
scheming and exploitative behaviors to overcome competition (McKenna 1996;
Vries 1985; Wright and Zahra 2011). Pohler (2012) highlights the exploitation of
nascent entrepreneurs in CWS due to asymmetrical power relation between
established and nascent entrepreneurs. Furthermore, the ‘open for all’ policy of
CWS may provide the important impetus for creativity and innovation, but it also
has several dark sides such as distrust and conﬂicts (Chowdhury 2005; Larson 1992;
Wright and Zahra 2011).
This paper aims to conceptualize the effect of the dark side of entrepreneurship
in CWS. First, we review the literature on CWS (Bouncken and Reuschl 2016;
Gandini 2015; Spinuzzi 2012; Surman 2013), the dark side of entrepreneurship
(McKenna 1996; Morck and Yeung 2004; Osborne 1991; Wright and Zahra 2011),
and social capital theory (Kim and Aldrich 2005; Lin 1999; Obstfeld 2005;
Wellman and Frank 2001). Next, we explain the impact of social isolation, stress,
exploitative behavior, conﬂicts, and distrust on CWS. Building on this knowledge,
we develop strategies for CWS to cope with the dark side of entrepreneurship
through mentoring, coaching, community management, and strengthening the
entrepreneurial spirit.

Theoretical Background
2.1
Entrepreneurship in Coworking-Spaces
Coworking-spaces provide an alternate work environment equipped with all ofﬁce
amenities and ﬂexible pricing without special requirements or duties. This presents
users an ideal space for social and professional interaction (Bouncken and Reuschl
2017; Uda et al. 2015). The salient features of CWS include provision of open-plan
ofﬁces (Spinuzzi 2012), shared resources (Capdevila 2014b) and learning opportu-
nities (Waters-Lynch et al. 2016). Coworking-spaces help to develop a community
of independent professionals (Bouncken et al. 2016; Gandini 2015) including
freelancers, entrepreneurs, small and micro enterprises from all industry sectors
(Gerdenitsch et al. 2016; Spinuzzi 2012) to pursue social interaction, learning,
cultural and business related interests (Bouncken and Reuschl 2016).
136
R.B. Bouncken et al.

Boyd and Vozikis (1994) suggest that entrepreneurial self-efﬁcacy increases
through interaction and collaboration with likeminded entrepreneurs. Coworking-
spaces provide opportunities for interaction and collaboration, boosting entrepre-
neurial self-efﬁcacy (Cabral and Winden 2016). These spaces enable entrepreneurs
to form groups or teams to work on creative and novel projects, which they could
not complete on their own (Spinuzzi 2012). Creative and purposeful serendipitous
environment provided by the CWS (Surman 2013) help entrepreneurs to share
knowledge and to solve complex problems with minimum efforts in novel ways
(Bouncken et al. 2016).
Coworking-spaces not only enable collaboration, knowledge sharing and learn-
ing among entrepreneurs but also provide opportunities to interact and develop
social and professional networks (Capdevila 2014b; Choen 2011). Entrepreneurs
can proﬁt from this opportunity, breaking their isolation, and seizing new ideas
(Capdevila 2013). Innovations ﬂourish in CWS, as these spaces connect entrepre-
neurial spirit with the dynamic demands of the external environment (Moriset 2014;
Uda et al. 2015). Workshops, conferences and seminars offered by CWS provide
training and development opportunities for the entrepreneurs to acquire new
knowledge and skills (Bouncken 2017; Fuzi 2015).
2.2
Social Capital Theory
Social capital theory provides a framework for understanding the relationship
outcomes around the dark side of entrepreneurship. Social capital theory states
that the analysis of relationships is based on economic and social dimensions (Lin
1999; Wellman and Frank 2001). Entrepreneurs engage in interaction and social
networking for gaining support, acceptance and credibility (Lin 1999). They expect
to save money by avoiding costly, time consuming errors, and unnecessary research
(Obstfeld 2005; Wellman and Frank 2001). Studies suggest that entrepreneurs work
together in more efﬁcient and effective ways when they have strong social ties,
mutual trust and shared values (Bolino et al. 2002; Kim and Aldrich 2005).
Social ties and networks help entrepreneurs to gain access to other entrepreneur-
ial networks for knowledge sharing and acquisition of information (Aldrich and
Wiedenmayer 1993). Interaction among entrepreneurs in networks leads to
exchange of information, advice, resources, or services (Emerson 1976; Larson
1992). Entrepreneurs provide resources and information voluntarily and usually
unsolicited, based on the mutual trust with implicit expectations of the return (Kim
and Aldrich 2005). Entrepreneurs continuously try to reciprocate the favors and
build equitable relationships. If proﬁts from the interactions are high, then entre-
preneurs remain satisﬁed and continue to contribute in their networks. If the
proﬁtability is lower than their expectation, entrepreneurs are likely to leave the
network (Kim and Aldrich 2005).
Coworking-spaces provide the opportunities to entrepreneurs to build social
capital and strong social ties through interaction based on their individual timing

137

and preferential space settings (Capdevila 2014a; Gerdenitsch et al. 2016). These
spaces also help entrepreneurs to improve their proﬁtability by working on mutual
and joint projects. However, the social interaction and collaboration among entre-
preneurs always bears the risk of opportunistic behaviors. In Fig. 1, we summarize
the dark side of entrepreneurship and strategies to confront the dark side of
entrepreneurship in CWS.

Dark Side of Entrepreneurship in Coworking-Spaces
3.1
Social Isolation and Stress
Entrepreneurs face difﬁculties in social and professional interactions due to their
personality traits (Beaver and Jennings 2005; Osborne 1991; Vries 2003). Research
conducted on a longitudinal dataset spanning 37 years depicts systematic antisocial
tendencies (including rule breaking behavior) in entrepreneurs’ biographies
(Obschonka et al. 2013). While only a small number of studies address the dark
side of entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship (McKenna 1996; Osborne 1991; Vries
2003), results show that entrepreneurs use their authority and wealth to monopolize
their market position and undermine fair competition by exploiting social ties with
political elites (Morck and Yeung 2003; Wright and Zahra 2011). Entrepreneurs’
stamina and excessive commitment with their business can create tensions in
relationships (family and friends) which often lead to social isolation (Wright and
Zahra 2011). Entrepreneurs who operate their businesses from home face high level
of social isolation (Ross and Ressia 2015). Social isolation causes anxiety, stress
and depression in entrepreneurs (Baron et al. 2016; Ruef et al. 2003). Coworking-
spaces offer a solution for social isolation to entrepreneurs, by providing opportu-
nities to interact with other like-minded individuals (Bouncken and Reuschl 2016;
Gandini 2015; Gerdenitsch et al. 2016). However, associating with other entrepre-
neurs or ﬁnding the right community or network is challenging. The ﬁndings of
Ruef et al. (2003) show that minorities in their network or individuals with a low
social status face social isolation.
Stress is the inability of an individual to exhibit an appropriate response in a
threatening and demanding situation (Cohen and Wills 1985). Stress does not arise

due to a single stressful event. It arises, when individuals have to face accumulating
problems without appropriate coping strategies (Cohen and Wills 1985). Entrepre-
neurs face high levels of stress during their exposure to an unpredictable and rapidly
changing environment (Baron et al. 2016). In CWS, entrepreneurs have to balance
their activities between collaborating with a deﬁned social network and being open
to diverse new contacts, between exploiting the chances for interaction and being
distracted, and between their investments and value appropriation (Reuschl and
Bouncken 2017).
Diversity vs. Community The ‘open for all’ policy of CWS creates a working
environment for a diverse community based on a shared culture and working
values. Entrepreneurs have to ﬁnd a CWS with the appropriate community, culture,
and values, and adapt to the changes induced through the exit of old members and
the entrance of new members. The existing community is a major reason to joining
a particular CWS (Fuzi 2015). Being part of the wrong community with a
mismatching culture or inappropriate work values causes dissatisfaction and stress
(Cohen 2016).
Interaction vs. Distraction Coworking-spaces design open ofﬁce layouts to sup-
port and encourage casual interactions (Bouncken and Reuschl 2016; Capdevila
2014b). On the downside, this set-up causes noise through talks, phone calls, and
meetings in the open space, leading to distractions. Such an environment can make
it difﬁcult for co-workers to focus on their work (Cohen 2016). While CWS are
providing space and triggers for the open and joint discussion of creative ideas,
entrepreneurs trying to get work done are interrupted, disturbed, and easily frus-
trated. As CWS purposefully try to foster interaction, it is very likely that one or
more individuals use the space for socialization and networking and entrepreneurs
have to bear the personality traits of other co-workers just like in traditional ofﬁces.
Cost vs. Beneﬁts Entrepreneurs have to pay for accessing CWS. The price is
usually lower compared to maintaining their own ofﬁce space. In addition to
ﬁxed costs, entrepreneurs also pay a fee for accessing other facilities such as
meeting room, events, etc. (Bouncken and Reuschl 2016; Waters-Lynch et al.
2016). Besides the monetary costs, entrepreneurs also have to invest time and
energy into the creation of social networks. While CWS can provide a very helpful
environment for new ventures and start-ups, nascent entrepreneurs without a
customer base have to gain a position in the networks (Baron et al. 2016). Entre-
preneurs have to invest continuously into their network positions while facing
uncertain beneﬁts and even the risk of being member of a community that cannot
provide advantages anymore.
Spinuzzi (2012) deﬁned working in a CWS as “combining social networking and
working in a laid-back environment where the stress is gone” (p. 417). However,
being unable to ﬁnd the right community and bearing interruptions, distractions,
annoying coworkers, and unhealthy competitions are causing stress for entrepre-
neurs in CWS. Hobfoll (1989) suggests that a high level of self-efﬁcacy helps to
cope with stressful situations. Most of the stressors in CWS that cause negative

emotions such as frustration, or dissatisfaction, are beyond the entrepreneurial
control and reduce entrepreneurial self-efﬁcacy.
3.2
Exploitation
Entrepreneurs engage in different social groups or networks for exchanging infor-
mation (ideas or advices), resources (ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial), and getting
support (acceptance or status) (Emerson 1976; Lin 1999). Strong social ties, mutual
trust, shared values and common social norms help entrepreneurs to perform
efﬁciently and effectively (Bolino et al. 2002). Therefore, entrepreneurs continu-
ously try to establish and maintain their networks (Larson 1992). Coworking-spaces
provide an innovative environment for nascent entrepreneurship, new ventures, and
start-ups. However, entrepreneurs in CWS have to face relationship-based chal-
lenges like conﬂicts, distrust, or uneven returns that can ruin the whole idea
of CWS.
Many nascent entrepreneurs aim to use the equipped ofﬁces, networking and
business opportunities of CWS to establish their own business. Pohler (2012)
highlights the risk of exploitation in CWS due to asymmetrical power relations
between nascent and established entrepreneurs. Coworking-spaces provide the
opportunities for collaboration and interaction that can lead to business deals.
Established entrepreneurs subcontract some of their engagement to nascent entre-
preneurs if their business opportunities surpass their production capacity (Spinuzzi
2012). Nascent entrepreneurs have to negotiate for a reasonable margin (Pohler
2012). During the start-up phase, nascent entrepreneurs often lack both resources
and clients. They depend on projects from established entrepreneurs to make a
proﬁt. These projects come with closed deadlines, leaving no time to evaluate the
advantageousness for their own business. Instead of developing their own business,
entrepreneurs remain dependent on partners. The autonomous and ﬂexible envi-
ronment of CWS helps to overcome the barriers of limited resources and skills but
exposes nascent entrepreneurs to the risk of exploitation.
3.3
Conﬂicts and Distrust
Mutual collaboration in CWS help entrepreneurs to utilize the knowledge and skills
of each other. Lechler (2001) states that entrepreneurial teams tend to be more
successful compared to single entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs with diverse back-
grounds, values, and goals join teams in CWS. Conﬂicts in entrepreneurial teams
can be divided into cognitive and affective conﬂicts (Ensley et al. 2002). Cognitive
conﬂicts are considered positive when they lead to effective strategic decision
making. Affective conﬂicts are based on interpersonal disliking and personality
based disagreement (Ensley et al. 2002). Cognitive conﬂicts lead to affective
140
R.B. Bouncken et al.

conﬂicts, and conﬂicts can deteriorate decision making and even lead to departures
of team members if not managed effectively (Collewaert 2012; Higashide and
Birley 2002). Conﬂicts arising in entrepreneurial teams in CWS are likely to be
affective conﬂicts. Task related conﬂicts are less likely to occur in entrepreneurial
teams as they usually consist of members with a high specialization (Collewaert and
Sapienza 2016). Entrepreneurial teams working on joint projects in CWS have low
or only implicit hierarchies. Trying to take the project lead could lead to conﬂicts or
even to entrepreneurs withdrawing from the group (Carmeli 2005).
Vries (2003) argues that the entrepreneurial ‘need for control’ leads to suspi-
cious thinking based upon a permanent fear of being exploited. The collaboration of
entrepreneurs in joint projects builds on common targets and values. These values
include information sharing, mutual learning, cooperation and trust (Gerdenitsch
et al. 2016; Letaifa and Rabeau 2013). Breaking the common values can lead to the
early break-up of projects. Sensing distrust in the team climate results in decreasing
team morale, dissatisfaction and poor productivity (McKenna 1996). Designed as
‘open ofﬁce spaces’, CWS expose entrepreneurs to the risks of an external envi-
ronment. Coworking-spaces try to compensate this disadvantage by offering lim-
ited private spaces like traditional ofﬁces. However, even when working in private
ofﬁces, entrepreneurs share places like a kitchen or conference rooms, making it
difﬁcult to protect knowledge and secrets. Therefore, entrepreneurs hesitate to share
their prospective plans with team members, causing insecurity and a sense of
distrust. Entrepreneurs working in creative industries are especially at risk of
imitation by competitors.

Confronting the ‘Dark Side’ of Entrepreneurship
in CWS
4.1
Mentoring, Coaching, and Social Support
The desire to control, risk-taking proclivity, decision-making, leadership, creativity
and several other characteristics are associated with the personality of entrepreneurs
(Ricketts 2009). In the previous section, we explained how a variety of challenges
and risks for entrepreneurship challenge the idea of coworking. The effective
management of a CWS contributes to the creation of a positive community that
helps to realize the potentials and to avoid the dark side of entrepreneurship.
First, CWS can provide training opportunities for their users by arranging
workshops, events, seminars, etc. (Bouncken and Reuschl 2016). Trainings help
to broaden the vision of entrepreneurs, to acquire new skills, and to create a positive
community in their spaces. Training programs cater to the needs of wide variety of
users. The CWS management could easily develop a special program to introduce
nascent entrepreneurs into the community, and established entrepreneurs could take
the role of mentors or coaches (Bouncken 2017). Gerdenitsch et al. (2016)

empirically show that the interactions and collaborations in CWS provide social
support that helps to develop entrepreneurial self-efﬁcacy. Moreover, interactions
among entrepreneurs and social support directly helps to buffer negative effects of
stress (De Clercq et al. 2016). It is possible to create a work environment in CWS
that enhances mutual learning, cooperation, and collective growth instead of com-
petition, animosity and hostility.
4.2
Coworking Community
Coworking-spaces have diverse range of users from students to micro enterprises
(Bouncken and Reuschl 2016) with their independent motives, objectives and
targets to pursue (Green 2014; Spinuzzi 2012; Uda 2013). Therefore, it is compul-
sory to communicate the norms and values of CWS with every stakeholder.
Manager in CWS can play their role and communicate the expectations at the
start of membership whereas, establish entrepreneurs can contribute by developing
a climate based on trust, mutual respect and equitable relationships (Gerdenitsch
et al. 2016).
Culture based on shared norms and values can only be created by developing a
community in CWS (Butcher 2013; Rus and Orel 2015). Community of any CWS
can be a major motivational factor for freelancers, start-ups, and entrepreneurs to
join a CWS (Fuzi 2015). Coworking-spaces that fail to develop a community are
less likely to communicate shared norms and values (Foertsch 2015). Establishing a
community in a CWS is a two-dimensional process, where the users participate
alongside the owners or managers who can employ community managers to take
care of the community (Bilandzic et al. 2013). The owner or manager of a CWS has
the chance to inﬂuence the development of the community by offering trainings,
closely monitoring of community dynamics, and by collecting the feedback of new
or leaving members.
4.3
Conﬂict Resolution Mechanisms
Coworking-spaces provide opportunities to create positive ties and networks
between autonomous and independent members (Bilandzic et al. 2013). Differing
opinions among individuals are a usual cause for conﬂicts in CWS (Chowdhury
2005). Lack of conﬂict resolution mechanisms lead to withdrawal of entrepreneurs
from CWS and undermine the whole value system of CWS. Therefore, it is
necessary to incorporate conﬂict resolution mechanisms at CWS level.
Entrepreneurial teams should also work side by side with the management of
CWS for establishing conﬂict resolution mechanisms. Standard operating proce-
dures and guidelines for members of CWS can be communicated by the manage-
ment of a CWS at the beginning of membership. In the same way, entrepreneurs at
142

the beginning of any joint project can clarify the mutual duties and responsibilities
to avoid task related conﬂicts (Higashide and Birley 2002). Forming committees of
different members from the same CWS can also be a good strategy to resolve
conﬂicts inside entrepreneurial teams.
4.4
Startup Culture
Coworking-spaces provide an ideal platform, where entrepreneurs can play a role
model for young coworking users and support their intentions for establishing
startups (Fuzi 2015). According to Foertsch (2015), startups in CWS are four
times more likely to be successful compared to stand-alone start-ups. This can be
possible, if the communities of likeminded people in CWS support ventures of
nascent entrepreneurs (Rus and Orel 2015). A coworking-space and its inherent
startup culture can help nascent entrepreneurs to cope with the dark side of
entrepreneurship by creating a culture based on mutual respect, trust and collective
growth. Coworking-spaces shall nurture start-ups by offering trainings, legal,
ﬁnancial and business guidance (Fuzi 2015; Surman 2013; Uda et al. 2015).
These spaces can also play their role by connecting nascent entrepreneurs with
other like-minded individuals who aim for establishing startups in CWS (Bouncken
and Reuschl 2017; Rus and Orel 2015), helping them to strengthen their entrepre-
neurial passion and self-efﬁcacy.

Conclusion
Coworking-spaces offer a high potential for promoting entrepreneurship. Entrepre-
neurs can easily develop social ties through interaction and networking opportuni-
ties provided by these spaces. Coworking-spaces also offer development
opportunities by arranging trainings, seminars, conferences, or workshops. Entre-
preneurship ﬂourishes when CWS provide a climate for creativity, serendipity, and
novelty. While there are many studies and articles discussing the chances and
opportunities of CWS, the dark side of entrepreneurship in CWS has been ignored.
We make a ﬁrst step to ﬁll this gap by pointing at the potential risks of and for
entrepreneurship in CWS. The behavior of entrepreneurs can seriously affect the
very basic values of CWS and entrepreneurship itself. The ‘open for all’ policy
creates the strongest opportunities for CWS by increasing the diversity of available
knowledge, extending the scope of networks and driving the development of a rich
community. At the same time, this policy creates social dynamics that lead to an
ever-changing community requiring continuous investments of entrepreneurs in
their social position.
For entrepreneurs, it is challenging to identify a ﬁtting community. Nascent
entrepreneurs have to develop strategies to handle asymmetrical power relations

within entrepreneurial teams as their dependence on established entrepreneurs
bears the risk of exploitation and entering unequitable relationships. We summarize
the risks for nascent entrepreneurs as exploitation, the occurrence of conﬂicts, and
the climate of distrust that decrease self-efﬁcacy and entrepreneurial passion as the
dark side of entrepreneurship.
Mentoring, coaching and community management in CWS provide the possi-
bility to avoid the emergence of the depicted risks and challenges. Interaction and
collaboration in CWS also lead to the evolution of social and professional ties,
relationships, and networks. Building these relationships on equitable manners
creates a serendipitous working environment in any CWS. Finally, communities
based on shared values, mutual respect, and trust emerge from the social relation-
ships and create a climate for entrepreneurial passion, self-efﬁcacy, and start-up
ventures.

Gender Behavioral Issues
and Entrepreneurship
Irene Comeig and Marc Lurbe
Abstract Women, despite the fact that they make up around 50% of the world’s
population, own and manage signiﬁcantly fewer businesses than men worldwide.
Previous empirical research indicates that the gender gap in entrepreneurial propen-
sity mainly comes from subjective perceptions as self-conﬁdence in one’s own
skills and fear of failure, and from women’s lower exposure to other entrepreneurs.
In this chapter we present laboratory economic experiments that study, under
controlled conditions, subjective perceptions of women and men that seem to affect
entrepreneurial propensity. The results of the reviewed experiments indicate that
correcting factors such as self-conﬁdence is possible (due to its cultural origin) and
would reduce differences in entrepreneurial propensity between genders. Speciﬁ-
cally, the promotion among women of competitive sports, the emphasis on femi-
nine references in entrepreneurship, and avoiding presenting entrepreneurial
information with male stereotyping while reinforcing women stereotyping are
recommended ways to help women gain self-conﬁdence in competitive environ-
ments, as entrepreneurship. Regarding the other subjective perception that has been
found to sustain the gender gap in entrepreneurship propensity, the fear of losses
(and/or attitudes towards risk), the reviewed experimental research, still in need of
more context-free experiments, similarly suggests cultural changes and education
as ways to overcome this gender-gap.

Introduction
Women, despite the fact that they make up around 50% of the world’s population,
own and manage signiﬁcantly fewer businesses than men worldwide (Kim 2007;
Coleman and Robb 2012; Koellinger et al. 2013; Cho and Lee 2015)—As a matter
of example, women-owned businesses in the US represented “only 3.5% of total
sales, 6.4% of total employment, and 4.5% of annual payroll” in 2007 (Coleman
and Robb 2012, p. 5). Although signiﬁcant advances in the status of women entre-
preneurs in the developing world during the last 30 years have been made (e.g. Center
for Women’s Business Research, 2009), there is still substantial scope for further
research on the reasons that sustain this gender gap.
The recent empirical evidence on entrepreneurship using data from the Global
Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) Project (considered the largest global research
database in entrepreneurship—Reynolds et al. 2005; Sa´nchez-Escobedo et al.
2016), shows that subjective perceptual variables account for much of the differ-
ence in the entrepreneurial propensity between genders (e.g. Langowitz and Minniti
2007; Koellinger et al. 2011, 2013).
Speciﬁcally, Koellinger et al. (2013), using data on 17 countries, shows that the
gender gap in entrepreneurial propensity mainly comes from subjective perceptions
as self-conﬁdence in one’s own skills and fear of failure, and from women’s lower
exposure to other entrepreneurs, whereas socio-economic variables (as age, educa-
tion, work status, and household income) only play a small role, probably due to
their inﬂuence on perceptions. In the same line, Wagner (2007), using data from
Regional Entrepreneurship Monitor (REM) Germany 2003 that include information
not available from the GEM survey, ﬁnds that the fear of failure is important for the
explanation of the gender gap in entrepreneurship.
In this chapter we present laboratory economic experiments that study, under
controlled conditions, subjective perceptions of women and men that seem to affect
entrepreneurial propensity. Laboratory economic experiments are particularly well
suited to allow for analyzing subjective perceptions and its causality not only on
women entrepreneurial behavior, but also on entrepreneurial behaviors in general.
Due to the large quantity of research generated in recent years, this chapter does not
attempt to provide a complete literature review, but to identify some underpinnings
in the entrepreneurial propensity of women.
Our goal is to provide some insights into the foundations of the observed
differences in entrepreneurship propensity across men and women by reviewing
experimental research and to suggest ways to overcome this gender gap. The results
of the reviewed experiments indicate that correcting factors such as self-conﬁdence
is possible (due to its cultural origin) and would reduce differences in entrepre-
neurial propensity between genders. Speciﬁcally, the promotion among women of
competitive sports, the emphasis on feminine references in entrepreneurship, and
avoiding presenting entrepreneurial information with male stereotyping while
reinforcing women stereotyping are recommended ways to help women gain self-
conﬁdence in competitive environments as entrepreneurship.

The other subjective perception that has been found to sustain the gender gap in
entrepreneurship propensity, the fear of losses (and/or attitudes towards risk), is
reviewed in Sect. 3. The reviewed experimental research, still scarce in context-
free experiments, suggests cultural changes and education as ways to overcome this
gender-gap.
This chapter is organized as follows: Following this introduction, Sect. 2 provides
an overview of the experimental research that shows the importance of self-
conﬁdence in the decision to entering competitive environments, and provides
recommendations for policy interventions to increase women’s self-conﬁdence in
competitive contexts. Section 3 focuses on experimental results on fear of failure
through experiments on attitudes toward downside risk per gender. Section 4
concludes.

The Role of Self-Conﬁdence
Recent research in the experimental economics literature, trying to provide insights
into why we observe a higher fraction of men than women in top-level positions in
business, science, or politics and a lower fraction of women in entrepreneurship
found that generally men and women differ in propensities to engage in competitive
activities (e.g., Gneezy et al. 2003; Gneezy and Rustichini 2004; Croson and Gneezy
2009; Niederle and Vesterlund 2007, 2011; Holm et al. 2013), with women shying
away from competition more frequently. A stylized ﬁnding in this literature is that
men opt to compete more often than women even where women are more able.
Self-conﬁdence or, more precisely, the women’s low self-conﬁdence was found
to be key for this result. Kamas and Preston (2012), for example, in an analysis with
US undergraduate students found that, conditional on ability, self-conﬁdence was
the determinant condition in decisions to enter competitive environments, with
women being less self-conﬁdent. In the same direction, the framed-ﬁeld experiment
on prediction markets presented in Boulu-Reshef et al. (2016) showed that the
women’s low self-conﬁdence related to a lower trading participation.
Comeig et al. (2016), in an economic experiment with undergraduate students
from economics and business careers in Spain, experimentally tested subjects’ self-
conﬁdence and its relation to the decision of entering competitive environments.
They found that women entered competitive environments if they had previous
experience in competitive sports. Results showed that experience in competitive
sports acts as a substitute for high self-conﬁdence and that self-conﬁdence serves as
a path to enter in competitive systems. This result suggests that policy interventions
devoted to increase women’s experience in competitive sports might raise women’s
self-conﬁdence and therefore help reduce the gender differences in top-level posi-
tions in business, science, or politics, and in the entrepreneurship propensity.
Actually, the research of Gneezy et al. (2009), showed that preferences for
competition come from cultural inﬂuences (nurture), not from gender nature, and
thereby might be changed with policy interventions. Gneezy et al. (2009), trying to
understand the role culture plays in gender preferences for competition, analyzed

the competitiveness of the participants of two distinct societies: the Maasai, a
patriarchal society in Tanzania, and the Khasi, a matrilineal and matrilocal society
in India. Their results showed that, similar to the extant evidence from experiments
in Western cultures, Maasai men opted to compete more than Maasai women.
However, this result reversed among the Khasi, where women chose the competitive
environment more often than Khasi men, and even weakly more often than Maasai
men. Women outcompeted men in the matrilineal society.
In line with cultural pressure, Charness and Rustichini (2011) observed how men
and women competitive vs. cooperative behavior changed when their same-gender
peers observed them. In an experiment with university students from the US,
females cooperated more often and men cooperated less frequently when they
were observed by their same-gender peers. Charness and Rustichini (2011) con-
cluded that men want to signal to other men that they are tough; whereas women
prefer to signal to other women they are cooperative. This result indicates that
cultural context (and salient group membership such as gender) inﬂuences gender
behavior.
As entrepreneurship might be considered, in patriarchal societies, as a male
typed career, this stereotype could act as a mechanism to explain gender differences
in entrepreneurship propensity. Gupta et al. (2014) analyzed how the contextual
inﬂuence of stereotype threat actually inﬂuences evaluations of new business
opportunities. Evaluation of new opportunities has been reported to be an important
part of entrepreneurship. They found that while salience of masculine stereotypical
information boosted men’s opportunity evaluation, when entrepreneurship was
linked to feminine stereotypical information the results reversed in favor of
women. Their ﬁndings suggest it is possible to reduce gender differences in
entrepreneurship propensity by presenting appropriate gender stereotypical infor-
mation. Given that the experiment was run with business students in Turkey and
repeated with working professionals in the US, the results seem to hold cross-
culturally. In the same direction, the survey analyzed by Leslie et al. (2015) about
the gender imbalance in STEM careers and the women’s underrepresentation in
academia revealed that this imbalance is due to the fact that women are stereotyped
as not possessing the necessary talent. They found that cultural stereotypes on
expectations of brilliance are behind women’s underrepresentation in some scien-
tiﬁc disciplines and academic departments.
Overall, the ﬁndings reported in this section indicate that self-conﬁdence in one’s
own skills (and cultural context, as self-conﬁdence reinforcing mechanism) plays an
important role in the willingness to enter in competitive environments as entrepre-
neurship. This result is important for policy interventions because appropriate edu-
cation and presentation of information may correct women’s lower conﬁdence.
Results from controlled experiments suggest several paths to reinforce women’s
self-conﬁdence: (1) Educating young women by giving them experience in com-
petitive environments as competitive sports; (2) In order to alleviate patriarchal
cultural pressure and its consequences on gendered entrepreneurial identity,
highlighting feminine references in entrepreneurship; and (3) Avoiding presenting
information with male stereotyping while reinforcing women labeling.

Gender Differences in Fear of Failure
Signiﬁcant gender differences in fear of failure found in Koellinger et al. (2013) and
Wagner (2007) might be due to more pronounced degrees of loss aversion in
women, but they could also come from less favorable conditions in equity and/or
credit markets for women when trying to get funding, or from less favorable
perceived conditions.
Actually, some evidence from surveys in different countries show that female
entrepreneurs face lower probability of receiving a loan (Cavalluzzo et al. 2002;
Muravyev et al. 2009; Welsh et al. 2016), have a smaller amount of start-up capital
(Coleman 2000; Verheul and Thurik 2001), and are more likely to receive a smaller
loan (Zimmerman and Scot 2006). Other research from surveys, however, highlight
the cultural gender bias (cultural attitudes favoring males) as the reason why female
entrepreneurs tend to shy away from formal credit markets, even though credit
markets are not actively discriminating against women (Zimmerman and Scot
2006; Ongena and Popov 2015).
In spite of the documented less favorable conditions that women face in credit
markets, gender differences in fear of failure might come from women’s more
pronounced degrees of loss aversion, too. Recent economic experiments have iden-
tiﬁed some underpinnings that help study gender differences in degrees of loss
aversion. Although laboratory economic experiments involving losses are difﬁcult
to conduct and, consequently, results may be puzzling, some experimental economics
literature regarding attitudes towards risk per gender provides interesting insights.
Comeig et al. (2015) proposes two different risk structures (see Table 1) called
downside risk and upside risk, respectively, being the downside risk structure an
approach that allows the analysis of loss aversion in the laboratory. As referent
dependant approaches (see Thaler 1980), and the Prospect Theory (Kahneman and
Tversky 1979; Tversky and Kahneman 1992) show that outcomes are evaluated
relative to some relevant reference point (in contrast to conventional economic
approaches, as the Expected Utility Theory, in which the possible outcomes of
available choice options are valued in absolute terms), downside risk structure may
serve to elicit loss aversion. Speciﬁcally, Bediou et al. (2013) shows that the loss
perception generated by payoffs under the reference point make subjects exhibit
loss aversion.
The results of the laboratory economic experiment of Comeig et al. (2015) show
that with downside risk (in presence of perceived losses) males tend to select the

riskier option more often than females in the low stakes scenario, but this signiﬁcant
difference disappears in the high stakes scenario. This result seems to point out to
some degree of gender differences in fear of failure; despite the fact this difference
is not widespread among situations of high stakes. This result lets the question open
to more future research. It is important to highlight that the weak gender difference
in perceived loss aversion found come from a context-free canonical form exper-
iment, where cultural references and emotions might be minimized.
In contrast to the previous reviewed research, Comeig et al. (2014) presents a
laboratory experiment in the context of credit markets. In this experiment subjects
(half women) face a downside risk in the context of a choice between two loan
contracts differing in interest rate and collateral requirements. The two contracts
have been designed as theoretical incentive-compatible contracts, where the theory
predicts that subjects with low risk projects should choose higher collateral at a
lower interest rate, while subjects with high risk projects should select contracts
without collateral at a higher rate. The key idea is that the cost of choosing collateral
is lower for subjects with low risk projects as they have a lower failure probability.
However, if women exhibit more pronounced degrees of loss aversion the self-
selection mechanism with collateral will fail. Results from this experiment show
that incentive-compatible contracts with collateral fail to classify women, while
they successfully classify men. Thus, in this downside risk environment in a context
of ﬁnancing decisions women show a signiﬁcant higher degree of loss aversion. It is
important to highlight that this experiment was conducted in three different
European countries (UK, Spain, and Switzerland) showing the same experimental
results in each of the three countries.
Table 2 presents an abstract of the results found in literature about gender
differences in fear of failure (downside risk). As shown in the Table 2, contextual
downside risks lead to more pronounced degrees of loss aversion in women.
Despite gender differences in generally deﬁned risk preferences have seemed
prevalent in literature surveys (see Eckel and Grossman 2008; Harrison and
Rutstr€om 2008; Croson and Gneezy 2009; Charness and Gneezy 2012; Charness
et al. 2013), haven’t found to be uniform across measurement methods and contexts
(see Holt and Laury 2014; Filippin and Crosetto 2016). For example, Booth and
Nolen (2012) report that girls in single-sex schools choose the risky option more
often than girls in coeducational schools. In the same line, Nelson (2016)
reevaluates empirical work on gender and risk, and concludes that gender differ-
ences in risk preferences are overstated in the literature. Probably, separating
downside and upside risks, as presented in Table 2, will help clarify the results.
The downside risk structure approaches loss aversion elicitation.
Supporting the idea that gender differences in fear of failure (Koellinger et al.
2013; Wagner 2007) might come from more pronounced degrees of loss aversion in
women, and also from less favorable conditions (or perceived conditions) in
cultural environment, economic experiments on downside risk structures seem to
show stronger gender differences when contextualizing experiments.
In order to analyze social and economic factors behind gender behavior towards
risk, Gong and Yang (2012) conducted experiments with subjects from two ethnic
groups, the matrilineal Mosuo and the patriarchal Yi in China. However, the two
154
I. Comeig and M. Lurbe

risk tests they used to measure risk attitudes per gender represent lotteries of 50%
probability of success, thus not allowing for downside risk or upside risks analyses.
They ﬁnd that Mosuo people (matrilineal society) have a signiﬁcant smaller gender
gap in risk preferences. This is consistent with Ca´rdenas et al. (2012) that compare
gender risk attitudes in Colombia and Sweden. They ﬁnd that girls in Sweden show
a small gender gap, while in both Colombia and Sweden girls are more risk averse
than boys.
Gneezy et al. (2009) run the same investment risk test used in Gong and Yang
(2012) (that does not allow for downside risk analyses) and found no signiﬁcant
gender differences. However, they found a signiﬁcant ethnicity difference, being
the matrilineal Khasi less risk averse.
Overall, the ﬁndings reported in this section seem to indicate that cultural
context plays a role in the gender differences in fear of failure, which affect

entrepreneurship. This result lets some room for policy interventions through
appropriate education.
However, results from preliminary context-free controlled experiments still
show some gender differences in fear of failure (through downside risk) that require
further research in order to understand if such differences in fear of failure originate
from nature too, and not only from nurture (cultural factors).

Conclusion
Signiﬁcant advances in the status and number of women entrepreneurs in the
developing world have been made during the last 30 years. However, women still
own and manage signiﬁcantly fewer enterprises than men worldwide.
This chapter has presented laboratory economic experiments analyzing, under
controlled conditions, subjective perceptions of men and women that seem to affect
entrepreneurial propensity. Laboratory economic experiments are exceptionally
well suited to allow for examining subjective perceptions. The goal of this review
was to identify some underpinnings by providing insights into the foundations of
the observed differences in subjective perceptions as self-conﬁdence in one’s own
skills and fear of failure.
The results of the reviewed experiments suggest that correcting factors such as
self-conﬁdence implies helping change culture. Speciﬁcally, the promotion among
women of competitive sports, highlighting feminine references in entrepreneurship,
and avoiding male stereotyped entrepreneurial information while presenting
women labeled information are recommended ways to increase women self-
conﬁdence in competitive environments as entrepreneurship.
The signiﬁcant gender differences in fear of failure that seem to push the gender
gap in entrepreneurial propensity have been revised too. Despite the fact that results
from preliminary context-free economic laboratory experiments show some gender
differences in downside risk structures, ﬁndings reported in experiments seem to
indicate that cultural context plays an important role.
This result lets the door open to policy interventions providing appropriate
education and a fair playground for all genders in entrepreneurship matters.
However, more experimental research in downside context-free environments is
needed to better understand if gender differences in fear of failure originate in
nature too, and not only in cultural factors (nurture).
Another question that remains open is how increasing women’s exposure to
other entrepreneurs, or to women entrepreneurs, may help reduce the gender gap in
entrepreneurship propensity.

Entrepreneurial Leadership

Systems Approach to Entrepreneurial Success:
The Theoretical Discussion on the Signiﬁcance
of Family Factors for Effective
Entrepreneurship
Marcin W. Staniewski and Katarzyna Awruk
Abstract Successful business activity (equated with entrepreneurial success or
business effectiveness for the purposes of this paper) has become a ‘popular’
research area in the recent years, which makes the researchers increasingly willing
to explore the issue in a more and more sophisticated manner. Simultaneously, the
interdisciplinary approach, which consists in seeking the psychological factor in the
broadly understood entrepreneurial behaviours, is becoming particularly alluring. A
good example of this is the ongoing expansion of the deﬁnitional scope of entre-
preneurial success intended to add ‘subjectivism’ to the term. In other words,
entrepreneurial success gradually ceases to be operationalized solely with ‘objec-
tive categories’, such as the period of a company’s operation, proﬁtability, number
of employees, etc., and becomes enriched with the ‘subjective element’, such as the
level of satisfaction from fulﬁlment of the objectives that an entrepreneur pursues,
level of business competitiveness or, for instance, the general level of satisfaction
from running ones own business. Another example of this (by the way) new trend is
seeking psychological determinants of entrepreneurial success, which directs some
attention to personality variables. In this respect, the signiﬁcance of, among other
things, traits has been demonstrated; that is, the high level of autonomy, extrover-
sion, the sense of self-efﬁcacy, locus of control, and openness to experiences or the
low level of neuroticism. The relevant literature, however, shows little interest in
the family aspect. Thus one may safely assume that the role of family factors (such
as attachment styles, parental attitudes) in entrepreneurial success is highly
underdeﬁned in the literature (if not outright marginalised/neglected). Just a few
papers discuss (1) the inﬂuence of the presence of a successful entrepreneur in the
family on displaying business behaviours; (2) the signiﬁcance of the lack of the

male model in the family, and (3) the implications of an authoritative parenting
style for business activity. However, two issues are worth noting: (1) these papers
are mainly concerned with analysis of family variables as regards undertaking
entrepreneurial activity and not successful business activity. What is more,
(2) they do not discuss the systems approach to entrepreneurial success understood
as the interaction between parental attitudes displayed by an entrepreneur’s mother
and father separately. Taking all this into account, the main objective of this paper
has been set to be theoretical deliberation about the signiﬁcance of exploration of
the systems approach to successful business activity for future research.

Introduction
The term development transgression seems (to the authors’ of this chapter) to most
accurately describe what is happening in the empirical sphere of entrepreneurial
success. We are witnessing a slow breakdown of a brassbound approach to research
issues, which is concerned with just a single discipline; while explorational inter-
disciplinary accents are simultaneously sprouting in the literature. This process has
had several implications: seeking the psychological factor in deﬁnitions of entre-
preneurship (Staniewski 2016) as well as accentuation of the economic and
non-economic signiﬁcance of successful entrepreneurship (Al-Mahrouq 2010;
Drucker 1999, p. 58; Janasz 2004; Kuratko 2003; Rogerson 2004; Wennekers and
Thurik 1999), development of propositions of entrepreneurial success models
(e.g. Giessen-Amsterdam model, a model of entrepreneurial success in the devel-
oping countries or a model of success in three stages of business development)
(Z˙alin´ski and Łaguna 2014), accentuation of the electric approach to entrepreneur-
ial success (Staniewski 2016) by way of broadening the deﬁnitional scope of
entrepreneurial success with an individual’s subjective dimension and thus taking
into account such indicators as: the general level of satisfaction with running a
business, fulﬁlment of the objectives set up prior to establishing a company (Indarti
and Langenberg 2004; Walker and Brown 2004), degree of satisfaction with
company’s development or the number of clients serviced, attainment of goals
regarding business development, and degree of satisfaction with tasks performed by
employees or company’s competitiveness (Staniewski and Awruk in press). This
opens the door to further theoreticians’ disputes on the signiﬁcance and boundaries
of subjectivism in self-reporting methods. In other words, should the psychological
indicator such as the level of satisfaction with oneself as an entrepreneur be
considered subjective in questionnaire-based methods or does the seemingly objec-
tive indicator (e.g., ﬁnancial liquidity, proﬁtability) lose its dose of objectivism in
favour of subjectivism when a highly subjective method is adopted (since a
questionnaire or survey certainly is one)? Or perhaps the indicator that appears to

not be considered subjective but only the ones that are enumerated by researchers?
Is it possible that the indicators offered by the researchers: ﬁrm performance,
workplace relationships, personal fulﬁlment, community impact, and personal
ﬁnancial rewards (Wach et al. 2016), some of which seem to be ostensibly objective
(ﬁrm performance), are in fact entirely subjective? We leave this question open
hoping that it might pave the way for researchers’ deliberations about the extent of
the subjective quality in the objective indicators of entrepreneurial success (espe-
cially when questionnaire-based methods are applied).
Another area for consideration regarding successful entrepreneurship is
obtaining empirical conﬁrmation for the factors that have been found to potentially
determine entrepreneurial success. Accepting the artiﬁcial and at the same time
agreed upon boundary dividing factors into psychological and non-psychological
ones, whose sole purpose is to obtain “better” insight, we cite a fraction of those
whose contribution to accounting for variance of entrepreneurial success has been
discussed in the relevant literature. The ﬁrst group is fed by such factors as
government support programs (Rose et al. 2006), government policies (Hansen
et al. 2009), formal business plans (Schilit 1986), age, education (Cragg and King
1988), technical knowledge (Huck and McEwen 1991), human resources, organi-
zational capital (Rodrı´guez-Gutie´rrez et al. 2015), and work experience (Evans and
Leighton 1989; Pfeiffer and Reize 2000), etc. Certainly, the array of possibilities is
wider, however the consideration and discussion of the systems-integrating
approach to entrepreneurial success (which is adopted in this chapter) emphasizes
the necessity to take a closer look at the second group of success predictors. The
psychological factors conditioning entrepreneurial success include personality
dispositions (extraversion, conscientiousness, openness, agreeableness, and low
neuroticism) (Engle et al. 1997), inner sense of control (Timmons et al. 1985),
need for achievement (McClelland 1961), self-efﬁcacy (Zhao et al. 2005), self-
conﬁdence (Zhang et al. 2009); cognitive factors [alertness to market opportunities
(Kirzner 1973), strategic planning (Reavley and Lituchy 2008), managerial skills
(Lin 1998)]; and social factors [support from others (ﬁnancial, technological,
strategic partnerships, industrial contacts) (Carrier et al. 2004), community-based
networks (Levent et al. 2003), and good relationships with customers (Ghosh and
Kwan 1996)]. This holistic approach to psychological determinants, however,
seems to overlook the signiﬁcance of family factors by way of making their role
in explaining entrepreneurial success marginalised. Such an observation is fairly
surprising since the family system is one of the most important subsystems in which
a human being grows and develops. The power of the family of origin is so
overwhelming that it appears to be determining numerous areas of a person’s life,
including the scope of social roles that family members take as well as the direction
of one’s education, type of career path or an array of activities one becomes
involved in, and a person’s traits that frequently determine the level of one’s
everyday functional adaptability (Alesina and Giuliano 2010; Whiston and Keller
2004). Psychologists consider career and family life as the main components of the
structure of an individual’s life, which require their involvement and simulta-
neously shape their life path (Lachowska 2012; Trempała 2000). Therefore, if

165

career and family life affect each other and even have a similar inﬂuence on a
person (and their social, cognitive, intellectual functioning, and identity shaping,
etc.), it seems justiﬁed to ask to what extent is the family system capable of
imprinting potential on a human being, which will translate into their effectiveness
in terms of performing the role of an entrepreneur in adult life. Intrigued by the
above issue, we have established the objective of this chapter to be deliberation on
the legitimacy of exploring the signiﬁcance of family factors for entrepreneurial
success.

Family Factors and Entrepreneurial Success: Research
Review
It is a tradition in psychology to deﬁne family system as “[. . .] a complex structure
composed of mutually interdependent groups of people who share the same history,
some level of emotional attachment, and introduce interaction strategies which
individual family members as well as the group as a whole need” (Plopa 2015,
p. 15). Thus the family system is a structure of subsystems with clear (or blurred)
boundaries, with speciﬁed roles and functions, and established strategies and rules.
These qualities may refer to both the family of origin (i.e. the system where a person
grows and socialises) and one’s own family as well (i.e. the system one establishes
in adult life by way of entering into a relationship with a partner/marriage and
possibly taking the role of a parent).
It may thus be assumed that a family (both one’s own and of one’s origin) exerts
an enormous inﬂuence over the way an individual functions outside the family
(in terms of adaptability/disadaptability). If so, such an inﬂuence may be considered
from two theoretical perspectives: facilitation (“[. . .] the extent to which function-
ing in one sphere of life (e.g., professional work) becomes easier owing to the
experiences, skills, and beneﬁts acquired or developed though participation in
another sphere of life (e.g. family life)”) (Lachowska 2012, p.12) or conﬂict. So
the question is whether performing roles in one’s own family system facilitates the
performance of roles concerned with running one’s own business. Or is it the other
way round that one’s own family system hinders the achievement of entrepreneurial
success? And what about the family of origin? Is the family in which we grow up
capable of imprinting us with the potential/resources that might be decisive in our
future fate as an entrepreneur? Since the relevant literature currently provides no
empirically veriﬁed answers in this respect, we may only theorize referring by
analogy to the ﬁndings of research on the relationships combining the family sphere
with the professional one. Many papers elaborate on these relationships (Liang et al.
2013; Poon et al. 2012) and numerous models have been introduced too [such as,
among others, the model of conﬂict between work and family by Frone et al.
(1992), the dual-process model of work-home interference by Bakker and Geurts
(2004), and the model of diversiﬁed and comparable signiﬁcance of requirements
166
M.W. Staniewski and K. Awruk

and resources for conﬂict and facilitation between work and family by Voydanoff
(2004, 2005a, b)]. Combination of these data allows to draw several conclusions
regrading the relationships between the professional and the family sphere. Both of
the spheres (i.e. career and family) are interrelated; hence if we refer to, for
instance, the model of conﬂict, playing the professional role may have a negative
inﬂuence over performance of family roles and playing the family roles may
hamper performance of professional roles. Following the dual-process model of
work-home interference, one may come to a conclusion that the features of one’s
job (i.e. requirements, e.g., pressure brought about by a fast pace of work, tight
deadlines, and resources, e.g., remuneration, atmosphere in the team, autonomy,
getting feedback) cause the emergence of two psychological processes that translate
into the way an individual functions in the family. The ﬁrst process concerned with
requirements may generally lead to constant overload, exhaustion, and health
problems, which is closely related to a negative impact on the family. The second
process related to resources as a motivational potential generates good functioning
of an individual, which is connected with the ﬂow and a positive impact of work on
the family. Voydanoff, who adopts the perspective of the theory of systems after
Bronfenbrenner (1986), assumes that work and family are two microsystems with
numerous links and processes occurring between them. Conﬂict and facilitation are
the mechanisms of the processes of mutual relations between work and family.
Both the mechanisms work two-way, which is why, it is possible to talk about the
following relations: work-family conﬂict, family-work conﬂict, work-family facil-
itation, and family-work facilitation, where conﬂict is relatively more frequently
related to requirements and facilitation to resources. The requirements are divided
into: time-based (e.g. time devoted to work, overtime, time devoted to child care,
time devoted to housework), pressure-related (e.g. pressure related to time, losing a
job, burdens arising from a relationship with a spouse or with children and running a
home) and requirements connected with the boundary between work and family
(e.g. working from home). Resources in this model are divided into: resources
generating resources (e.g., social support from the superior, co-workers, partner,
skills acquired due to activity in a given area), resources in the form of psycholog-
ical rewards (such as the sense of being respected, taking pride in doing one’s job or
performing the role of a parent) and resources related to the work-family boundary
(e.g., ﬂexible working hours, maternity leave, support from the superior in terms of
reconciliation between work and family life).
If the above dichotomisation of factors (into resources and challenges) is
adopted to the relationship parent-child, a new perspective on the issue becomes
available. Such a perspective may be referred to as a systems-integrating approach
to entrepreneurial success which is manifested in an attempt to precisely deﬁne the
degree of inﬂuence of the conﬁguration of parental attitudes over the level of
business effectiveness. Precisely, the intention is not only to answer the question
on the predictive value of individual family factors (with regard to each parental
attitude separately) but to determine what is the role of the conﬁguration of parental
attitudes declared by both parents at the same time. As a result of juggling with the
concept of six dimensions of the relationship parent-child (see Table 1), two

constellations of parental attitudes emerge—separately for the mother and the
father. Integration of the two constellations of attitudes (of the mother and the
father simultaneously) is important as, on the one hand, it may constitute an
innovative attempt at accounting for the fraction of the multiplicity of causes of
entrepreneurial success and, on the other hand, supply data on the buffering
inﬂuence of these constellations over business effectiveness. In other words, refer-
ring to the mechanisms of facilitation and conﬂict, another perspective on seeking
such conﬁgurations of attitudes emerges, which not only determine but even
facilitate the achievement of entrepreneurial success in adult life (Fig. 1). However,
to what extent can we talk about direct inﬂuence of family factors on entrepreneur-
ial success? Is it that excessive concentration on the extension of the analysis of the
signiﬁcance of the conﬁgurations of family variables will cost us marginalization of
the signiﬁcance of the second category of variables? The behaviouristic concept of
stimulus-reaction was enriched by the cognitive element of interpretation long ago.
In this case, the formula becomes: stimulus-interpretation-reaction. Using this
formula in the deliberations on entrepreneurial success; are we entitled to talk
about any direct effect on a variable which is so immensely complex in terms of
its conditioning? Or would it be useful to extend the model with seeking indirect
effects?
Our “formula” then becomes: interaction between the conﬁgurations of parental
attitudes declared by both parents partially interacts with cognitive factors (i.e., an
individual’s beliefs such as the sense of entrepreneurial self-efﬁcacy), which
remains interrelated with the other mediating variable—the behavioural factor
Table 1 Plopa’s concept of parental attitudes (2008)
Parental attitude
Description
Acceptance/
rejection
The parent is considered to be unconditionally accepting, creating the
atmosphere of free exchange of feelings, trust towards the world and people,
safety, giving the sense of support; they are open to various forms of support,
however, without imposing themselves. The dimension of rejection is
concerned with the parent evaluated as cold, distant, showing no under-
standing for the child’s needs, maintaining relationships which are rather
instrumental (consisting in maintaining the child) rather than focused on a
person
Autonomy
The parent understands the child’s need for autonomy and allows them to
single-handedly explore the world (e.g., by solving problems, learning from
mistakes, decision-making).
Inconsistency
The parent is considered erratic, moody, irritable, inconsistent, which makes
them unable to build a calm, friendly atmosphere in the family
Excessive
protection
The parent is evaluated as excessively intervening in a child’s life, interested
in each, even the smallest, manifestation of a child’s activity; a parent
displaying inadequate concern over the child, which often causes the rela-
tionship between them and the child to deteriorate.
Excessive
demands
The parent is considered to demand unconditional obedience, limit the
child’s autonomy through numerous bans, orders, and punishments. The
parent is described as strict with a punitive attitude, having a vision of the
child’s future, and rigidly demanding its imposition.

(i.e. the business activities that an individual becomes involved in). The ﬁnal link in
this chain of relationships is the relation of the behavioural factor with the achieved
entrepreneurial success (see Fig. 2). At the stage of such initial theoretical-
hypothetical considerations, this model could be later supplemented by the moder-
ating variable—gender. Thus the ﬁnal question that we would like to ask in this
chapter is concerned with the moderating role of gender in a model assuming an
intermediary relation between the interaction within the conﬁguration of family
factors and entrepreneurial success with the mediating role of cognitive and

terms but they remain within the sphere of theory, awaiting empirical veriﬁcation.

Discussion
This paper undertakes to theoretically consider the signiﬁcance of exploration of
family factors for entrepreneurial success. Our chief objective was to shed light on a
research area that has so far been highly underdeﬁned or even marginalized in the
relevant literature. The studies carried out so far were essentially focused on
analysis of the role of a successful entrepreneur in the family, that is, on the
mechanism of modelling entrepreneurial behaviours (Bosma et al. 2000; Katre
and Salipante 2012; Littunen 2001; Reuber and Fischer 1997). It is worth noting,
however, that these papers are mostly concerned with business activity rather than
entrepreneurial success strictly speaking and their main aim is to answer the
question whether the presence of a successful entrepreneur in the family may
shape the entrepreneurial behaviours of the other family members?
Other studies of this type concentrate on the signiﬁcance of the presence of the
male role model for undertaking business activity (Kets de Vries 1996), and their
main objective is to verify the inﬂuence of the absence (including emotional one) of
the father on undertaking business activity. There is also a very small number of
studies that focus on the role of authoritative parenting style on entrepreneurs’
behaviours (Strenger and Burak 2005). It is, however, worth highlighting that these

studies are mainly interested in entrepreneurial behaviours rather than entrepre-
neurial success. Thus our intention is to elaborate on family issues but referring
exclusively to effective entrepreneurial activity.
Thus we have condensed these deliberations into a purely hypothetical model
embedded in the systems theory (consideration of parental attitudes), the cognitive-
behavioural approach (the inﬂuence of beliefs on the actions one takes), and the
concept of facilitation-conﬂict. Judging by analogy to the family-work relations, it
seems that the family system (of both the family of origin and one’s own family)
may exert (positive or negative) inﬂuence over entrepreneurial effectiveness though
the mediating role of the cognitive-behavioural factor (beliefs and behaviours). It is
thus a recognition of the theoretical perspective of facilitation/conﬂict and the
cognitive-behavioural orientation.
What we have in mind when referring to the systems-integrating approach to
entrepreneurial success is the fact of taking into account family factors that interact
with one another on certain levels. For the purposes of simpliﬁcation, we only
consider one type of systems variables—the proposition of six parental attitudes
(acceptance/rejection, autonomy, inconsistency, excessive protection, and exces-
sive demands) as put forward by Plopa (2008), which has been empirically veriﬁed.
Nevertheless, we assume the most important issue is not the sole identiﬁcation of
parental attitudes in people who achieve entrepreneurial success but veriﬁcation of
the contribution of interactions within the whole conﬁgurations of such attitudes to
accounting for variance of entrepreneurial success. Such an approach raises numer-
ous intriguing questions: for example, is there such a constellation of parental
attitudes of both parents that could partially contribute to facilitation of entrepre-
neurial success? Or is it possible to ﬁnd such a set of family factors that could
increase the chance of predicting an entrepreneur’s failure?
So that the Reader is provided with a better overview of our deliberations, we
have illustrated each step on the way with ﬁgures, starting from the model of direct
relationships between family factors and entrepreneurial success, through a medi-
atory model, and ending with a mediatory-moderating one.
In the end, we would like to go back to the issue of limitations regarding the
above-mentioned (in the introduction) subjectivism of self-reporting indicators of
entrepreneurial success. The issue also recurs with regard to evaluation of parental
attitudes. This is because evaluation of these attitudes is frequently based on
retrospection (as adults evaluate their relationships with parents during childhood
and adolescence), which cause the levels of variables to be “distorted” in conse-
quence of the inﬂuence of both subjectivism and the time factor accompanied by the
natural processes of forgetting or “change of emotional state” (as present experi-
ences or mood at the time of ﬁlling the questionnaire in may modify/change the way
a persons sees the past attitudes of the parents towards them). These are the
implications of using the questionnaire-based methods in social studies, which
opens the door for further discussion about the adoption of self-reporting methods.
Such discussion, however, is not the subject-matter of this chapter.
As this short chapter concerns only theoretical model of relationships between
family factors and entrepreneurial success with mediating role of cognitive and

behavioural variables and moderating role of sex, our main goal was to stress the
importance of developing of this new research area. However, we think that the
other important thing is to discuss the way in which the goals highlighted in this
chapter should be achieved. At this initial stage of theoretical discussion, we can
only recommend quantitative approach with using some questionnaires to measure
e.g. parental attitudes, beliefs (e.g. hope to success) and entrepreneurial success.
Another important thing is to discuss a way to measure behavioural part of
model (behaviours) and to analyse methods serving to evaluate entrepreneurial
success. As this issue is “fragile” and “ambiguous” and this chapter has some
editorial limitations, the other paper should be dedicated to this topic. And this
mean that each part of model should be detailed analysed about the most appropri-
ate way of measurement with indicating advantages and disadvantages of using
each method.

and Performance in the Franchise Agreement

Abstract Franchising is a form of entrepreneurship in which the franchisor identiﬁes
and exploits market opportunities and takes risks by starting businesses within the
franchise. The franchise is governed by a contractual relationship between the fran-
chisor (entrepreneur) and franchisee. Franchisees are responsible for spreading the
franchisor’s business idea throughout the market. This chapter describes the franchi-
sor’s and franchisee’s personality traits, which act as determinants of the success of the
business idea. Knowledge of the franchisor’s personality traits helps potential fran-
chisees select franchise brands with which to establish formal contractual relation-
ships. Similarly, knowledge of franchisees’ personality traits helps franchisors select
suitable candidates, preventing the agency relationship between franchisor and fran-
chisee from being violated and safeguarding against opportunistic behaviour. The
chapter offers a review of research discussing the applications of psychology to
franchising as a form of entrepreneurship and thus identiﬁes the main psychological
traits required of franchisors and franchisees to ensure franchise success.

Introduction
The literature that draws a distinction between franchisor entrepreneurs and inde-
pendent entrepreneurs based on personality traits and socioeconomic variables fails
to provide conclusive evidence that one type of entrepreneur is any less entrepre-
neurial than the other. The scarce literature on this topic shows that franchisees are
attracted by a franchise-based form of business ownership that lets them become
part of a larger, established system with a tested business idea and a recognised
brand. While franchisees retain ownership and a certain degree of independence,
they receive training, technical and commercial support, and ﬁnancial assistance.
These motivations have only been considered for franchisees with just one outlet.

Speciﬁcally, the franchising research has drawn upon entrepreneurship (Anderson
et al. 1992) and psychology (Felstead 1991; Mesconi and Montanari 1981) to
explain the reasons for entering into the franchise business from the perspective
of franchisees with just one outlet. However, according to the literature in entre-
preneurship a variety of entrepreneurial proﬁles of franchisees can coexist within a
same chain (Grünhagen and Mittelstaedt 2005).
This chapter reviews the psychological traits that inﬂuence the selection of
partners with whom to enter into and maintain a franchise relationship to ensure
that this relationship has a high probability of success. Accordingly, the chapter has
the following structure. Following the introduction, Sect. 2 describes the background
regarding the partner selection criteria applied by the franchisor during the franchisee
selection process, as well as the criteria applied by the franchisee when selecting a
franchisor. Section 3 analyses the franchisor’s trade equity and the franchisee’s trust
in the franchisor in building a successful relationship, providing separate descriptions
of the franchisor and franchisee psychological traits that affect the performance of the
franchise relationship. Finally, Sect. 4 presents the conclusions of this chapter.

Partner Selection in Franchising
The need to conduct research when selecting partners to enter into a relationship is
well documented. Altinay and Miles (2006) point out that using a well-deﬁned
selection process and strict selection criteria helps control the behaviour of franchi-
sees before entering into the relationship and aids their integration within the broader
existing franchise network. Doherty (2009) also acknowledges the importance of a
selection process and selection criteria in international franchising. In his study,
Doherty (2009) observed that the franchisor adopted a different perspective
depending on who initiated the selection process. If the franchisor initiated the
process, then a strategic perspective was adopted during the process. If the franchisee
initiated the process, then an opportunistic perspective was adopted during the
process. When the franchisee initiates the process by becoming interested in a
brand, the franchisor applies an individual cognitive process (Brookes and Altinay
2011) and does not employ partner-related criteria, instead mainly employing ﬁnan-
cial criteria. When the franchisor initiates the process, he or she applies a formal
organisation structure to the process (Brookes and Altinay 2011) and mixes task-
related criteria—ﬁnancial stability, business know-how, local market knowledge, and
knowledge of the brand and the strategic direction of the business—and partner-
related criteria—chemistry between the franchisor and franchisee, for example.
In his study, Altinay (2006) found that selection criteria varied depending on the
stage of the selection process of international franchisees. In the early stages of the
process, the franchisor used criteria related to future franchisees’ personal traits,
which are essential for performing the tasks necessary for the franchise to succeed.
These traits are determined by the strategic context of the franchise business, the
markets of different countries, and the nature of the business itself. Credibility and
176
E. Calderon-Monge

reputation, however, are the relevant criteria for franchisor and franchisee (Brookes
and Altinay 2011; Soriano 2003).
When franchise relationship negotiations are initiated, the dominant criteria are
partner related. Personal chemistry is the main criteria used to evaluate the com-
patibility between franchisor and franchisee and ensure a negotiation process that
culminates in successfully established relationships. The cultural distance between
franchisor and franchisee in international franchises may complicate partner selec-
tion (Brookes 2014). Understanding the role of culture in the selection process is
important for ensuring the sustainability of the franchise relationship. Accordingly,
recognising the value and mutual risk, the compatibility of the vision of the business
between both parties, and the objectives and culture of the organisation are the
dominant criteria during this stage of the process and are apparently essential for
both franchisor and franchisee.
Finally, the ability to retain control and identity are two non-negotiable criteria
(Brookes and Altinay 2011). These criteria relate to the internal objectives of the
franchisor, who seeks the self-preservation of his or her business. These criteria are
based on the franchisor’s experience more than the experience of future franchisees.
These criteria are important for both franchisor and franchisee, yet each one adopts
a different approach. The franchisor focuses on the control and identity of the
brand, whereas the franchisee focuses on the control of his or her portfolio and
corporate identity.
Table 1 summarises the different task-related and partner-related criteria used by
franchisors in the franchisee selection process. In Table 1, the stage of the selection
process is not considered. Psychological aspects such as personality, attitude,
psychological proﬁle, and chemistry are all cited as criteria for franchisee selection.
Both the franchisee’s selection of the franchisor and the franchisor’s selection of
the franchisee are necessary for the two parties to enter into a relationship. Fur-
thermore, both selection processes have implications in terms of the struggle for
power and control between franchisor and franchisee. This struggle, which

becomes apparent once the franchise relationship has been entered into, starts
during the partner selection phase. Both franchisor and franchisee employ their
selection criteria as social and administrative control mechanisms to achieve other
objectives (expectations) throughout the relationship. The key observation here is
that franchisees exploit their criteria to demonstrate their power of negotiation and
subsequently negotiate more autonomously during the franchise relationship stage.

Franchise Relationship
The effective management of a franchise relationship is acknowledged as a key
ingredient for building an enduring, successful relationship (Weaven and Frazer
2007). Relationship management refers to relational or social control through the
development of shared organisational rules and practices and better coordination of
activities between the parties. A well-managed relationship can also help break
down barriers between franchisor and franchisee and increase interactions between
the two to achieve both parties’ objectives.
Relational marketing stresses the importance of building a mutually beneﬁcial
relationship between the ﬁrm and its stakeholders (Palmatier et al. 2006). The
franchise relationship differs from a traditional business (B2B) relationship because
of the franchise relationship’s social and subjective nature according to which
relationship quality depends on a mixture of rational and emotional factors (Dant
et al. 2013; Belso-Martı´nez et al. 2017). Two speciﬁc factors stand out in franchise
relationships: the franchisor’s trade equity and the franchisee’s trust in the franchisor
(Badrinarayanan et al. 2016). The franchisor’s trade equity refers to the franchisor’s
reputation among franchisees in terms of honesty, trustworthiness, and concern for
franchisees (Davis and Mentzer 2008). Franchisees assess the motives and behav-
iours of franchisors based on direct interaction with the franchisors themselves and
sources of commercial and trade data. The franchisor’s good reputation, earned
through trustworthiness and performance, serves as a pledge of supportive behaviour
in the future and is therefore likely to be attractive for franchisees seeking to establish
committed relationships (Davis and Mentzer 2008; Welsh et al. 2016).
Franchisors accumulate trade equity over time. This trade equity is strengthened
as the franchisor invests in bettering his or her franchisees and mutually improving
each other’s performance. When franchisors provide valuable knowledge resources
and go beyond formal, legally binding agreements (i.e., high trade equity), (1) fran-
chisees are more likely to invest in transaction-speciﬁc assets to maintain a steady
relationship with the franchisor, and franchisors are more likely to (2) attract new
franchisees and (3) strengthen relationships with existing franchisees (Nyadzayo
et al. 2011). Franchisors develop their trade equity through actions such as offering
strong support, exchanging information, and making efforts to intensify the relations
with franchisees. These actions improve the franchisee’s attachment to the brand,
positive evaluations and attitudes, and commitment to other franchisees (Nyadzayo
et al. 2011). In addition, these actions alleviate franchisees’ concerns that the
franchisor may exploit franchisees’ vulnerability (Badrinarayanan et al. 2016).

In a system such as franchising where interdependence is mutual yet control is
asymmetric, the success of the relationship depends greatly on shows of trust
between franchisor and franchisee. When franchisees trust franchisors, franchisees
become more conﬁdent in the franchisors’ competence and integrity, which in turn
leads to cooperative, supportive behaviours (Altinay et al. 2014; Davies et al. 2011).
When the level of trust is high, franchisees value their relationship with the
franchisor and develop positive attitudinal and emotional behaviours towards the
franchisor (Delgado-Ballester and Munuera-Alema´n 2005). Trust in the franchisor
fosters a sense of solidarity with the brand and a sense of community created around
the brand. Franchisees’ trust in the franchisor therefore inﬂuences (1) the develop-
ment of psychological bonds with the franchisor’s brand, (2) interactions among
franchisees, (3) the integration of other franchisees within the community who
share the same enthusiasm for the brand (Badrinarayanan et al. 2016), (4) the
participation of franchisees in communal, social, brand promotional, and other
such voluntary activities that strengthen brand value (Becerra and Badrinarayanan
2013), and (5) opposition to competing brands (Muniz and O’Guinn 2001). All of
these effects of trust build franchisees’ commitment to the brand so that franchisees
are highly motivated to interact and connect with the brand. Examples of this
motivational state are franchisee behaviours that transcend simple transactions
(e.g. using the product the franchisor is selling). Such behaviours are the result of
cognitive, emotional, and behavioural investment through interactions with the
brand. Franchisees’ commitment is one of the keys to a successful franchise
relationship because it creates a sense of responsibility for the success of the
brand. Committed franchisees also support the mission of the franchisor and
participate in franchisors’ programmes and activities (Hackel 2010). Hence, the
franchisor should increase his or her involvement in cultivating and supporting the
brand community among franchisees, developing deeper affective links, and
strengthening relationships with franchisees (Samu et al. 2012).
3.1
Franchisor Psychology
To attract franchisees and compete more effectively with other entrepreneurship
opportunities, franchisors must develop strong brands that are perceived as unique
and attractive by their target audience, namely future franchisees and consumers
(Zachary et al. 2011). Although the responsibility of managing a brand depends on
both the franchisor and the franchisees of that brand (Pitt et al. 2003), the success
and the implementation of marketing activities depend considerably on the brand’s
scope to develop brand resonance among franchisees (Zachary et al. 2011).
Franchisors attempt to develop a strong brand link among franchisees to moti-
vate them to engage in appropriate behaviours (Nyadzayo et al. 2011) and build
intense, active relationships with franchisees. To do so, the franchisor takes actions
aimed at raising the brand’s proﬁle (brand salience), achieving good performance
(brand performance), meeting the psychological and social needs of franchisees and
Personality Traits of the Partners and Performance in the Franchise Agreement
179

consumers (brand imagery), spreading positive opinions and evaluations of the
brand (brand judgments), and creating favourable emotional responses and reac-
tions to the brand (brand feelings). These actions create a deep, intense psycholog-
ical attachment to the brand among franchisees, together with the attendant loyal
behaviours. The franchisee’s psychological attachment to the brand means that
when the franchisee sells the brand’s products, he or she is actually selling the
values and image represented by the brand (e.g. a lifestyle) rather than just the
physical product itself (Badrinarayanan et al. 2016).
The franchisor fosters a psychological bond between the franchisees and the
brand, strengthening the value of the relationship with the brand or the previously
discussed trade equity. Together with the franchisees’ trust in the franchisor of the
brand, this strong trade equity manifests itself in behavioural loyal and attitudinal
attachment by franchisees as well as the previously discussed sense of community
and active engagement (Keller 2013). Behavioural loyalty or the continued intention
to remain a member of the franchise system is an important indicator of strong
franchisor-franchisee relationships (Chiou et al. 2004; Mas-Tur et al. 2015). Given
that franchisors invest considerable resources in selecting and training franchisees,
developing brand loyalty reduces the likelihood that franchisees terminate the rela-
tionship in the near future (Meek et al. 2011). Loyalty is complemented by attitudinal
attachment, understood as an emotion-laden bond with a brand that prompts the
preservation of the franchisee’s proximity to and relationship with the brand.
3.2
Franchisee Psychology
Because an individual’s personality affects the cognitions, motivations, and, conse-
quently, the behaviours of that individual, it is likely that the franchisee’s personality
also affects the performance of the franchise relationship—for example, in terms of
the franchisee’s compliance or violation of the franchise agreement—and may
explain why perceptions of quality vary across different franchises (Dant et al.
2013). Personality measures have been used by franchisors as a key input control
strategy during franchisee recruitment (Castrogiovanni et al. 2006). Speciﬁcally,
there is a consensus that ﬁve personality traits—extraversion, agreeableness, consci-
entiousness, emotional stability, and imagination—are signiﬁcant predictors of per-
formance in jobs that require interpersonal interactions, as is the case of the franchise
(Weaven et al. 2009). The quality of a franchise relationship is deﬁned according to
three factors: trust and commitment, both discussed earlier, and satisfaction. Satis-
faction refers to the positive affective response by an individual to the accumulative
assessments of the interaction experiences with that individual’s partner, and it is
critical to preserving the relationship (Grace and Weaven 2011).
Franchisees with an energetic, dominating personality that leads to impulsive
decisions and risky behaviours—extraversion as a personality trait—are unlikely to
be happy if the franchisor has a dominant position of power in the network. This
personality trait may be associated with hostility, anger, and dissatisfaction (Buss
180
E. Calderon-Monge

1991). These possible manifestations of extraversion behaviours may negatively
affect the delivery of the service to the end consumer and the resolution of possible
conﬂicts with the franchisor, other franchisees, or area representatives, for example.
As a result, commercial relationships may be weakened and the quality of the
franchise relationship may be undermined (Dant et al. 2013). This may affect the
mutual understanding of the values and goals of partners and restrict cooperative
problem solving, thereby further stiﬂing value creation within the franchise network
(Wu and Cavusgil 2006).
Franchisees with an agreeable personality are generally conﬁdent, ﬂexible, altru-
istic, tolerant, cooperative, good-natured, and friendly—agreeableness as a person-
ality trait. Such franchisees encourage cooperative working relationships and express
a preference for developing positive, loyal interpersonal relationships. They are also
highly likely to seek support from their network. This personality trait inhibits
individuals’ willingness to drive hard bargains or manipulate others for personal
gain (Zhao and Seibert 2006) and reduces the likelihood that individuals become
competitive or participate in conﬂicts (Mount et al. 1998). Accordingly, when
franchise agreements grant greater power and control to the franchisor, franchisees
who are prepared to follow the franchisor’s directives and collaborate with the
franchisor will be more likely to establish stronger franchise relationships. So,
franchisees with a high degree of agreeableness and a low degree of extraversion
will be able to build better relationships with their franchisors (Dant et al. 2013).
Franchisees with the conscientious personality trait are characterised by inspiring
trust, persevering in pursuit of speciﬁc, well-deﬁned goals, behaving obediently
and morally, and displaying goal-oriented behaviours. They are hard-working,
well-organised, action-oriented individuals who tend to take responsibility for
their actions (O’Brien and DeLongis 1996; Welsh et al. 2016). This personality
trait is well suited to professional situations that require a high degree of autonomy.
Franchisees with this personality trait generate respect and trust in the relationship
and facilitate cooperation and power-sharing. Franchisors are more likely to
develop an emotional attachment with trustworthy franchisees who achieve their
goals (Dant et al. 2013).
Emotional stability is another franchisee personality trait that is sought after by
franchisors. Emotionally stable franchisees are calm and relaxed and respond well
to stressful situations because they know how to adapt to such situations—they
consider these situations a challenge rather than a threat. They also know how to
resolve conﬂicts and deal with negative feedback. Franchisees with this personality
trait are more effective as leaders (Judge et al. 2002) and are more likely to develop
stronger franchise relationships because they adopt rational approaches to commu-
nication with partners and minimise dysfunctional conﬂict that might arise from
emotional assessments of the franchise situation. Because emotionally stable fran-
chisees are more committed, franchisors are more likely to develop a closer bond
with them (Dant et al. 2013).
Finally, imagination is a sought-after personality trait of company employees
because it characterises individuals with a drive to recognise and act upon new
opportunities (Ciavarella et al. 2004). Imagination has this effect because people
with this trait are curious, open minded, and emotionally aware. Although
Personality Traits of the Partners and Performance in the Franchise Agreement
181

franchisees are granted some independence in the running of their outlets
(e.g. promotional initiatives within the local market), franchisees are normally
required to strictly obey the formal guidelines set forth in the franchise agreement.
Therefore, the need to be creative, search for new ideas, and solve problems is less
important for franchisees than for entrepreneurs because any divergent form of
thinking may cause a misalignment of incentives between franchisor and franchi-
see, thereby weakening the franchise relationship. Most franchise chains encourage
franchisees to follow established policies and practices and implement the innova-
tions and strategies developed by the franchisor (Dant et al. 2013).

In Conclusion
The discipline of psychology is present when an individual starts a business through
franchising. The franchise relationship differs from a traditional business (B2B)
relationship because of its social, subjective nature according to which the quality
of the relationship depends on a mixture of rational and emotional factors. In the
franchisor-franchisee relationship, the process and criteria for selecting new part-
ners depends on which party initiates the selection process. According to the
literature review presented earlier in this chapter, the franchisor applies
psychology-related criteria to a greater degree when he or she takes the initiative
in the selection process than when the potential franchisee takes the initiative in the
selection process. Franchisees who wish to start a business seek quality in the
franchisor-franchisee relationship more than they seek the franchisor’s knowledge
regarding the business idea. To discern the quality of the relationship across
different brands, the franchisee must be aware of the brand resonance, which
consists of two relational factors: the franchisor’s trade equity and the trust gener-
ated by the franchisor. When the franchisor initiates the selection process, in
contrast, he or she seeks future franchisees with personality traits consistent with
the following proﬁle: low extroversion and imagination and high agreeableness,
conscientiousness, and emotional stability. An example of successful case in Spain
is the bar and restaurant chain Cervecerı´a La Sure~na. In this case, the franchisor
demonstrates expertise by operating with full transparency and offering potential
franchisees all available information. Thus, if these potential franchisees decide to
invest in the Cervecerı´a Sure~na franchise, they will have a clear idea of the
environment and the conditions in which they will be working.

The Importance of Empowerment
in Entrepreneurship
Daniel Henao-Zapata and Jose´ M. Peiro´
Abstract Empowerment comes at a time when global competition and change
require people to take initiative and be innovative. Based on the active, persistent,
and change-oriented behaviors associated with psychological empowerment, the
chapter states that empowerment can contribute to entrepreneurship. The dimen-
sions of empowerment that suggest a theoretical and empirical link with entrepre-
neurial behavior are discussed. Several propositions regarding the interplay
between empowerment and entrepreneurship are formulated. The chapter describes
paths to promote empowerment and entrepreneurship in applied context and sug-
gests future directions to advance research on empowerment in the ﬁeld of
entrepreneurship.

Introduction
Empowerment comes at a time when global competition and change require people
to take initiative and be innovative (Spreitzer 1995; Lee and Koh 2001).
Empowered people act independently in situations of risk and uncertainty, antici-
pate problems, and demonstrate persistence and resourcefulness when challenging
conditions at work appear (Spreitzer 1995, 1996, 2008). Empowerment appears to
be particularly important in situations where people need to work independently,
where perseverance and hope is necessary, and in contexts where people need to be

more proactive in making sense of situations and determining the appropriate
course of action. The potential outcomes of empowerment expand to individuals,
organizations, and societies (e.g., Seibert et al. 2004; Spreitzer 2007; Goodman
et al. 2016). Outcomes of empowerment such task performance, proactive behavior,
and innovation suggest that empowerment theory is relevant to broader contexts
outside organizational settings. Despite the accumulating evidence on the positive
effects of empowerment in diverse contexts, research has omitted the link between
empowerment and entrepreneurship. Such caveat anticipates an attractive ﬁeld of
research. This chapter represents a ﬁrst attempt to study the effects of empower-
ment in entrepreneurship. Because of the active, persistent, and change-oriented
behaviors associated with psychological empowerment (Spreitzer 1995), we argue
that empowerment can contribute positively to entrepreneurship.

Entrepreneurship: Concept, Features and Measures
The role of the entrepreneur consists in discovery and exploitation of opportunities
(Shane and Venkataraman 2000). Such role usually requires making rapid decisions
under uncertainty and with scarce resources, work harder than most employees, and
have access to a wide array of skills, knowledge, and abilities (e.g., management,
marketing, innovation, and leadership) (Shane 2003; Rauch and Frese 2007; Yao
et al. 2016).
Entrepreneurship is determined by a number of factors that include individual
differences (e.g., personality, human capital), environmental economic factors
(e.g., type of industry), and cultural and geographical factors (e.g., national culture,
or the institutional environment). Outcomes of entrepreneurship relate to develop-
ment of new products, services, strategies, processes, organizational forms, and
new markets that did not exist. Entrepreneurship is typically measured in terms of
business creation and business performance. The complexity of models of entre-
preneurship (considering antecedent variables and outcomes as well as the connec-
tions between those variables) goes beyond the scope of this chapter.
Frese (2009) developed an entrepreneurship framework that account for the
complex interaction between individual differences, environmental economic fac-
tors, and cultural and geographical factors (see Fig. 1). From the perspective of
action theory (Frese and Zapf 1994), the author elaborated on the effects of the
entrepreneurs’ personality traits, and their human capital on entrepreneurial suc-
cess. According to the model, such relationships are mediated by action styles
(or characteristics of active performance) such active goals and visions or active
feedback seeking, among other ways of information processing and acting in the
environment (see Fig. 1). The characteristics of active performance are at the center
stage in all phases of entrepreneurship. Such characteristics are not mere actions,
but rather ways of performing actions. According to Frese and Gielnik (2014), more
active actions characteristics lead to actions that are more likely to be successful.
They provide examples to support their hypotheses, such that active forms of
186
D. Henao-Zapata and J.M. Peiro´

learning (i.e., deliberate practice), or active network strategies are related to entre-
preneurial success (Unger et al. 2009; Zhao et al. 2010). Frese (2009) argues that the
typical facets of personal initiative—being self-started, future-oriented, and over-
coming barriers—tend to lead to success when they affect the different action
characteristics. Individual characteristics in interaction with the environmental ones
affect entrepreneurial activities which in turn change the environment. The environ-
ment includes the development stage of the ﬁrm (life cycle), the frequency of change
(dynamism), economic factors such as material or structural resources (hostility), and
type of business (industry). Embedded in a speciﬁc geographic region and cultural
context (national culture), the individual differences and the environment are also
seen as moderators of the effect that characteristics of active performance have on all
phases of entrepreneurial success: opportunity identiﬁcation, reﬁnement of business
concept and resource acquisition, and survival and growth.

Empowerment: Concept, Antecedents and Consequences
Spreitzer (1995) deﬁned psychological empowerment as a motivational construct
manifested in four cognitions: competence, self-determination, meaning, and
impact. “Competence, or self-efﬁcacy, is an individual’s belief in his or her ability
to perform activities with skill” (Spreitzer 1995). Self-determination refers to a
sense of having choice in initiating and regulating actions (Deci and Ryan 1987),
reﬂecting autonomy at work. Meaning refers to a match between the demands of a

work role and own beliefs, values, and behaviors (Hackman and Oldham 1980).
Impact is the extent to which an individual can inﬂuence strategic, administrative,
or operational outcomes at work. Together, such dimensions reﬂect a sense of
control at work and an active orientation through which individuals wish and feel
able to shape their work role and context (see Fig. 2)
Psychological empowerment is inﬂuenced by several factors that involve indi-
vidual characteristics (e.g., personality traits, human capital), and contextual factors
(e.g., work design characteristics). Outcomes of psychological empowerment refer
to attitudinal (e.g., job satisfaction) and behavioral (e.g., innovation) consequences
at work. Those attitudinal and behavioral outcomes are typically studied in orga-
nizational settings. Since entrepreneurs do not work for a given organization, we
center our attention on the attitudes and behaviors more directly related to entre-
preneurship. Speciﬁcally, we focus our attention on the effects of empowerment on
goal achievement, proactive behavior, innovation and active performance.
3.1
Direct Relationships Between Psychological
Empowerment and Entrepreneurial Behaviors
Spreitzer (2008) argued that the essence of empowerment is the interplay between
the four dimensions rather than just the isolated effects of each one. A combination
involving high-perceived competence, self-determination, meaning, and impact
predictably has more potential to contribute to entrepreneurship. As follows, we
explain the direct effects of such combination on behaviors intrinsically related to
entrepreneurship.

3.1.1
Goal Achievement
Previous work, including meta-analytical and empirical studies, provides evidence
showing a signiﬁcant relationship of psychological empowerment and performance
(e.g., Spreitzer 1995; Spreitzer et al. 1997, 2011; Zare et al. 2015). Spreitzer (1995,
1996, 2008) argued that psychologically empowered individuals act independently
in situations of risk and uncertainty, anticipate problems, and demonstrate persis-
tence and resourcefulness when challenging conditions at work appear. Empower-
ment describes beliefs suggesting that the person is conﬁdent of his (her) ability to
accomplish goals; it includes an inner conviction of one’s ability to control one’s
environment, the feeling that one can perform actions that impact. Previous
research shows the positive effects of competence in terms of performance at
work (e.g., Speier and Frese 1997; Ozer and Bandura 1990; Rauch and Frese
2007). Impact beliefs should increase effort and persistence towards goals because
individuals who perceive high impact foresee the accomplishment of their goals
and exert action to achieve them. Individuals who believe themselves as having an
impact get their ideas heard and can inﬂuence the system on which they interact
(Ashforth 1989), and thus are more likely to perform better than those who perceive
themselves as having little impact. Spreitzer et al. (1997), examined the contribu-
tion of each of the four dimensions of psychological empowerment on two inde-
pendent samples including (1) managers in a manufacturing organization, (2) and
employees in the service sector, and found that both competence and impact were
strongly related to managerial effectiveness (i.e., performance standards, peers’
comparison, overall success, and performance as a role model at work).
Empowered business owners should assert empowerment managerial practices
among their employees such as the distribution of power, information and knowl-
edge (Bowen and Lawler 1995; Burke 1986), which should increase the chances to
achieve entrepreneurial goals. Self-determination may also contribute to goal
achievement. Individuals who are able to choose how to do their jobs are higher
performers than those with little autonomy (Thomas and Tymon 1994; Spreitzer
et al. 1997). People who are more self-determined in activities like developing
strategies or setting performance appraisals, are more committed and motivated to
attain their goals. Meaning towards one’s job should result in increased motivation
to accomplish goals. Thus, individuals with high perceptions of competence, self-
determination, meaning, and impact are expected to manifest psychological states,
behaviors, and skills that lead them towards accomplishment of goals. Empower-
ment translates into psychological and behavioral manifestations such self-
conﬁdence, self-regulation, ﬂexible thinking, active engagement with the environ-
ment, leadership and dominance (Diener and Biswas-Diener 2005). Such manifes-
tations should increase chances for entrepreneurial success. For example, a self-
conﬁdent entrepreneur would more likely feel competent to sell his (her) products
or services to clients. Self-regulatory ability can contribute to allocate time efﬁ-
ciently to different tasks such idea’s generation for new products or development of
formal sale records and distribute efforts accordingly. Flexible thinking and active

189

engagement can be beneﬁcial for identifying new opportunities and persevering in
the achievement of business goals. Leadership and dominance should contribute to
run ﬁrms and manage employees (e.g., guiding and motivating them), and
strengthen a business position in the market. In this manner, psychologically
empowered individuals are more likely to succeed in the pursue of entrepreneurial
goals.
3.1.2
Proactive Behavior
Empowerment unleashes the productive potential of individuals (Samman and
Santos 2009), and links their strengths and competencies with proactive behaviors
and change (Perkins and Zimmerman 1995; Rappaport 1987; Hemang et al. 2017).
Spreitzer (2008), argued that psychologically empowered individuals impact on the
environment through proactive behaviors; they perform tasks in an active way
(Spreitzer 1995), manifest energy and desire to act, and evoke actions that are not
mediated by others or dependent upon direct rewards. Such individuals are thought
to work in the absence of close supervision, control their own task accomplishment,
manifest resiliency and motivation in the face of problems or ambiguity, and initiate
new tasks as opportunities arise (Thomas and Velthouse 1990). Proactive behaviors
are important because they refer to anticipatory, change oriented, and self–initiated
behaviors (Frese 2009; Frese and Gielnik 2014), which are fundamental to entre-
preneurial behavior (Rauch and Frese 2007; Tornau and Frese 2013). For example,
personal initiative is a proactive behavior characterized by being self-starting and
future-oriented that overcomes barriers (Frese and Fay 2001), which predicts
success in entrepreneurship (Frese 2009; Krauss et al. 2005; Glaub et al. 2014).
Empowerment facilitates proactive behavior by inducing an implemental mindset
(Keltner et al. 2003), and increasing freedom of action and decreasing avoidant
behavior (Ozer and Bandura 1990). An implemental mindset refers to readiness to
move ahead looking for the means to action. Individuals who feel psychologically
empowered are more likely to act freely and independently in situations of risk and
uncertainty, anticipate problems, and demonstrate persistence and resourcefulness
when challenging conditions (e.g., high uncertainty) appear at work (Spreitzer
1995, 1996, 2008). Such individuals mitigate the ambiguity that come from having
less direction and make sense of “weak” or uncertain situations, determining the
appropriate course of action and seeking feedback about their performance
(Spreitzer 2008). Such behaviors constitute a proactive approach that should
increase the chances for entrepreneurial success.
3.1.3
Innovation
Psychological empowerment has been consistently linked to innovation at work
(e.g., Lee and Koh 2001; Sun et al. 2012; Pieterse et al. 2010; Spreitzer 1995;
Seibert et al. 2011; Sinha et al. 2016; Odoardi et al. 2015). Kanter (1984), in her
190
D. Henao-Zapata and J.M. Peiro´

studies on entrepreneurial organizations, already stated that empowerment and
innovation are intrinsically related. Thomas and Velthouse (1990), suggested a
link between empowerment and ﬂexibility which should contribute to innovation
(Spreitzer 1995; Georgsdottir and Getz 2004). Ultimately, the dimensions that
deﬁne psychological empowerment relate to intrinsic motivation (Thomas and
Velthouse 1990), which has been linked to innovative behaviors (Redmond et al.
1993). Also, empirical research has shown the association between psychological
empowerment and innovation at work (Spreitzer 1995). In a study examining the
relationship between psychological empowerment and leadership on mid-level
supervisors, Spreitzer et al. (1999), found that supervisors who reported higher
levels of empowerment were judged as more innovative by their subordinates. In
this manner, both theory and research suggest that empowerment, should have an
impact on innovation. Empowerment creates a lower resistance to change and
willingness to invest in the future (Kanter 1984), and this in turn is thought to
facilitate innovation. Motivators such as meaning, self-determination, competence
and impact are likely to predispose individuals to implement new ideas and
suggestions for change that represent innovation at work. Psychologically
empowered individuals see themselves as competent, and thus tend to expect
success and be innovative at work (Spreitzer 1995; Amabile 1988; Redmond
et al. 1993); they perceive themselves as autonomous agents who have an impact,
and therefore should feel less constrained than others by rules or technical aspects at
work, making them more likely to be creative and innovative (Spreitzer 1995).
Entrepreneurship is characterized by innovative behaviors (Yan and Yan 2016).
Entrepreneurship and innovation are positively related to each other and interact to
help a business ﬂourish (Zhao 2005). Innovation refers to implementation of new or
substantially changed products, processes, or services adapted to current or future
demands. Through innovation entrepreneurs exploit opportunities for products or
services (Carayannis et al. 2015). Innovation is vital to ﬁrm’s success and sustain-
ability in today’s dynamic and changing environment (Zhao 2005). Thus, any factor
predisposing innovation should contribute to entrepreneurial success (e.g., business
creation and business performance).

Dimensions of Empowerment Leading to Characteristics
of Active Performance in Entrepreneurship
4.1
Why Should the Dimensions of Empowerment Lead
to Active Entrepreneurship?
Action is at center of entrepreneurship (Frese 2009). Frese and Gielnik (2014)
stated that more active ways of performing actions (rather than non-active), lead to
actions that are more likely to be successful in entrepreneurship. The characteristics
of active performance are at the center of all phases of entrepreneurship. From here,
The Importance of Empowerment in Entrepreneurship
191

any mechanism predisposing active actions (as opposed to reactive) should con-
tribute to entrepreneurship. Empowerment reﬂects an active orientation towards the
work role and context (Spreitzer 1995; Spreitzer 2008). An active orientation
towards work should result in more active actions, which in turn should make
entrepreneurs more likely to succeed (Frese and Gielnik 2014). Because of the
active, persistent, and change-oriented behaviors associated with psychological
empowerment (Spreitzer 1995), the dimensions of empowerment—competence,
self-determination, meaning, and impact—may lead to characteristic of active
performance such as active feedback seeking or active resource search. In this
sense, Spreitzer (2008), already suggested that empowerment may be an important
mechanism accounting for how and why proactive individuals (i.e., individuals with
proactive personality) manifest more personal initiative (Frese and Fay 2001), and
proactivity (Grant and Ashford 2008). We argue that those entrepreneurs who have
a strong perception of competence, self-determination, meaning, and impact, will
predictably be more active and manifest more characteristics of active performance.
Empowerment may contribute helping entrepreneurs to become master of their
fates, trusting their capacity to inﬂuence their business and its environment. Based
on research, we explain why and how the dimensions of empowerment can predict a
more active approach to entrepreneurship and facilitate success.
4.1.1
Competence
Competence can contribute to characteristics of active performance in a wide range
of business outcomes such survival, development, growth, and change (Bird 1988).
Spreitzer (1995) deﬁned competence as self-efﬁcacy. Competence can be under-
stood as self-efﬁcacy because it refers to the belief that one is able to competently
perform actions (Frese 2009; Bandura 1997). Self-efﬁcacy is related to successful
performance of diverse entrepreneurial roles and tasks (Chen et al. 1998), and, thus,
should predispose characteristics of active performance in entrepreneurship.
Active Goal and Visions Self-efﬁcacy relates to the capacity to take purposeful
action (Narayan-Parker 2005). Individuals who perceive themselves as self-
efﬁcacious have conﬁdence in their ability to accomplish goals (Chen et al. 1998);
they are prone for searching challenges (e.g., cover a gap in the market) (Bandura
1997), and associate challenging situations (e.g. hard work, or competition) with
rewards such proﬁt or psychological fulﬁlment (Hisrich 1990). Self-efﬁcacy inﬂu-
ences an individual’s goals level and assertion of effort and perseverance (Rauch and
Frese 2007). Thus, individuals who see themselves as competent should be more
active in regards of their goals and visions, establishing challenging and purposeful
goals by themselves (instead of given by others), that are future-oriented
(e.g. associated with rewards in the future), and persistent (e.g. asserting more effort
and persevering when problems occur).
192
D. Henao-Zapata and J.M. Peiro´

Active Task Strategy and Active Action Planning Self-efﬁcacy is related to proac-
tive and elaborated plans (Frese 2009). The perception of competence is useful to
develop plans. Competence implies that one has more control over one’s actions.
More control relates to more feasibility and desirability to execute action; which are
prerequisites of active planning (Frese 2009). People that feel prepared to accom-
plish future goals mentally simulate the action sequence to reach such goals. The
more mental simulations reach into the future, the more active is the approach
towards planning (Frese 2009). Moreover, self-efﬁcacy predicts entrepreneurial
intentions and the strength of entrepreneurial actions (Chen et al. 1998; McGee
et al. 2009; Bird 1988; Krueger and Brazeal 1994; Zhao et al. 2005). A plan is a
bridge between goals (intentions) and actions (Miller et al. 1986). People who feel
competent should have higher entrepreneurial intentions and should plan more in
order to materialize those intentions into actions. Individuals who see themselves as
able to competently perform actions persevere when problems arise (Bandura
1997), anticipate the action environment and action parameters, and thus should
develop plans actively (e.g., thinking about plan B if one plan does not work), and
foresee strategies to implement them.
Effectuation, Experimentation, and Innovation Self-efﬁcacy is thought to inﬂu-
ence one’s level of effort and persistence on several behaviors related to entrepre-
neurship such as opportunity recognition, uncertainty and risk management, and
innovation (Rauch and Frese 2007). People who are conﬁdent on their ability to
perform entrepreneurial roles and tasks perceive the environment as replete with
opportunities and perceive a lower cost and risk to go for such opportunities (Zhao
et al. 2005; Chen et al. 1998). Such individuals see themselves competent to deal
with the environment and anticipate outcomes of success, perceiving a low possi-
bility of failure and a high possibility to achieve business goals (Chen et al. 1998).
Thus, people with high perceptions of competence would predictably be more
conﬁdent to approach entrepreneurial tasks (McGee et al. 2009), such putting in
operation new services (i.e., effectuation and experimentation), and shape the
environment with their ideas (e.g., innovation).
Active Social Strategy for Networking The belief that one is able to competently
perform actions predicts the strength of intentions and actions related to entrepre-
neurship (Krueger and Brazeal 1994). People high on perceptions of competence
are conﬁdent to undertake tasks and roles in the entrepreneurial environment (Chen
et al. 1998). As a part of their role, entrepreneurs should pursue, nurture, and
broaden social networks. People who feel competent should have higher intentions
and feel more conﬁdent to perform such role, and direct more effort and be
persistent (Rauch and Frese 2007), towards tasks such as making appointments
with potential clients.
Active Feedback Seeking and Active Approach to Mistakes Self-efﬁcacious indi-
viduals perceive the environment full of opportunities and perceive low cost and
risk to invest effort in such opportunities (Chen et al. 1998); they search for
challenges (Bandura 1997) and are perseverant (Rauch and Frese 2007; Ozer and
The Importance of Empowerment in Entrepreneurship
193

Bandura 1990; Bandura 1997). Therefore, such individuals should be eager to
experiment across entrepreneurial settings rather than avoid errors (or negative
feedback) in such environment.
Active Approach to Learning Since people who see themselves as competent to
perform tasks with skill search for challenges and persevere (Bandura 1997),
perceive the environment full of opportunities (Chen et al. 1998), and associate
challenging situations (e.g., learning) with rewards (e.g., enhanced performance)
and fulﬁlment (e.g., satisfaction) (Hisrich 1990), they should invest more effort in
activities aimed to improve their current performance level (i.e., deliberate
practice).
4.1.2
Self-Determination
Entrepreneurship builds on the independent spirit of people to further new ventures
(Lumpkin and Dess 1996). Self-determination should contribute to characteristics
of active performance in entrepreneurship.
Active Goals and Visions Entrepreneurs need to act independently in order to bring
forth an idea (e.g., goals) and carry it through completion (Lumpkin and Dess
1996). Empowered individuals are self-determined and independent, they establish
their own goals and act upon them (Narayan-Parker 2002; Malhotra et al. 2002).
Individuals who are self-determined and autonomous prefer to make own decisions
and set their own goals (Rauch and Frese 2007). Since empowered individuals are
mostly dependent on their own will and action, they should be more active,
committed, and persistent in pursuing goals such as increasing sales or
implementing more efﬁcient processes into the market.
Active Task Strategy and Active Action Planning Empowered people are self-
determined, they take control over resources (Narayan-Parker 2005), control their
own task accomplishment (Thomas and Velthouse 1990), have ample knowledge
and information about their work (Spreitzer et al. 1997), and take actions towards
work goals (Spreitzer et al. 1999; Spreitzer 1996). Such individuals are in a better
position to plan and schedule work, and to identify and manage obstacles to achieve
optimal job performance (Spreitzer et al. 1997). Self-determined individuals plan
by self-setting their goals and allocating time and place to accomplish them.
Moreover, since self-determined individuals act autonomously they tend to plan
contingent strategies to overcome possible failure on plans. Also, because they can
choose ways, methods and processes to carry out their work they should anticipate
what resources are needed and prepare to meet future demands. Thus, they are
proactive in developing plans and strategies.
Effectuation, Experimentation and Innovation Self-determined individuals have
the independent spirit necessary to try out ideas and further innovations into
markets. Having choice in initiation and regulation of actions leads to the percep-
tion of autonomy, which enables opportunity-seeking behaviors (e.g., effectuation
194
D. Henao-Zapata and J.M. Peiro´

and experimentation), and advantage-seeking behaviors (e.g., innovation) (Ireland
et al. 2003). Perceived choice enhances ﬂexibility and creativity (Deci and Ryan
1987; Thomas and Velthouse 1990), which should also facilitate experimentation
and innovation (Sun et al. 2012; Spreitzer 1995; Georgsdottir and Getz 2004). Also,
self-determination should facilitate experimentation and innovation in entrepre-
neurship by giving control and direction in situations characterized by low struc-
ture, scarce resources, and ambiguous information. Self-determined individuals
experiment by trying out behaviors that they consider most effective to accomplish
their tasks. Such individuals are self-started deciding what and how things should be
done. Autonomous people act independently in spite of constraints (Frese 2009).
Therefore, self-determined individuals show characteristics of active effectuation,
experimentation, and innovation.
Active Social Strategy for Networking Individuals who have a sense of choice
regarding their work roles tend to initiate new tasks as opportunities arise (Thomas
and Velthouse 1990). Self-determined individuals act autonomously and perceive
control over the environment. Therefore, they should act upon social opportunities
for networking (e.g. reaching out a potential investor or partner), and perceive more
control to maintain and increment their social network.
Active Feedback Seeking and Active Approach to Mistakes Perceived choice
enhances initiative, resiliency and self-regulation (Deci and Ryan 1987; Thomas
and Velthouse 1990). Self-determined individuals should take the initiative to try
out their products or services (rather than avoid exposure), be resilient persevering
when such try outs do not go well, and regulate themselves controlling the negative
emotions that accompany errors. Hence, they should be more inclined to experi-
ment and look for feedback actively.
Active Approach to Learning Deliberate practice (i.e., active approach to learning)
“consists of individualized self-regulated and effortful activities aimed at improv-
ing one’s current performance level” (Frese 2009). It makes sense that those
individuals who are more self-determined will assert more effort and approach
learning opportunities more actively.
4.1.3
Meaning
Entrepreneurs assert purposeful action toward meaningful goals. Meaning should
foster characteristics of active performance in entrepreneurship.
Active Goals and Visions The perception of meaning serves to mobilize efforts
towards goals. Meaningful implies that something deserves speciﬁc action, effort,
attention, and high regard for consideration. Entrepreneurs elaborate on goals and
visions and make purposeful actions towards ideas that are meaningful. Ultimately,
meaning results in increased motivation (Bass 1985; Benis and Nanus 1985). The
sense of meaning is what energize and aligns behavior and expectations to the task
The Importance of Empowerment in Entrepreneurship
195

at hand (Spreitzer et al. 1997). Such motivation should urge entrepreneurs to
actively set goals, and maintain effort to carry them out.
Effectuation, Experimentation and Innovation High levels of meaning are
expected to result in high involvement and concentration of energy (Spreitzer
1995; Kanter 1984; Thomas and Velthouse 1990). People who perceive an align-
ment between their ideas, and their values and beliefs, should be prone to take the
risk to implement them (i.e., innovation), and sell them (i.e., experiment). Entre-
preneurs that have a strong sense of meaning for what they do, should be actively
involved in their businesses, investing more time in activities such exploring new
ways to enhance their products or services, and concentrating more psychic and
physical energy in discovering opportunities and implementing business ideas to
exploit such opportunities.
Active Social Strategy for Networking Entrepreneurs who perceive their tasks,
services or products as meaningful would predictably believe their business ideas
are good enough to introduce them in social environments. Such perceptions should
also encourage entrepreneurs to seek ways to distribute or increase the impact of
their ideas. For example, by acknowledging the value (or meaning) of their products
or services, entrepreneurs can feel more conﬁdent to actively approach potential
investors or clients (instead of waiting for them to come), and to “bootstrap” their
existing contacts to expand their network.
Active Feedback Seeking and Active Approach to Mistakes Feedback allows or
detriments the sense of fulﬁlment in respect of one’s desired behavior and expec-
tations at work. People that have high perceptions of meaning should constantly
seek for feedback in order to maintain them; they should test whether the actions
they perform keep fulﬁlling their desired work behaviors, beliefs, and values or not.
Active Approach to Learning Meaning fosters a sense of identiﬁcation and
involvement at work (Seibert et al. 2011). Individuals who perceive their tasks
and work roles as meaningful are likely to be more invested in their work (Spreitzer
et al. 1997). Meaning can fuel motivation, increase willingness to work long hours,
and enable persistence in the face of obstacles. Individuals tend to be actively
involved and invest more time into activities that are meaningful to them. Thus,
meaning should facilitate an active approach towards learning, increasing efforts
towards improvement of one’s performance level (i.e., deliberate practice).
4.1.4
Impact
People that see themselves having impact feel able to determine the environment
and obtain desirable outcomes through their actions. Impact should facilitate
characteristics of active performance in entrepreneurship.
Active Task Strategy and Active Action Planning Impact relates to perceived
feasibility, which is prerequisite for active planning (Frese 2009). It makes sense
196
D. Henao-Zapata and J.M. Peiro´

to be more proactive in planning if one feels more control over one’s fate (Frese
2009). Contrarily, it does not make sense to plan for things that one does not
perceive as attainable. Impactful individuals do not just randomly try anything,
but execute purposeful and goal oriented actions. Such individuals deliberately plan
thinking about potential scenarios, anticipating action parameters and the action
environment (e.g., evaluating potential risks), preparing to meet future demands
(e.g., detecting signals indicating future difﬁculties and opportunities), and devel-
oping reasonable hypothesis regarding the effect of their actions.
Effectuation, Experimentation and Innovation The perception of the ability to
affect results is crucial to entrepreneurship (Mueller and Thomas 2001), because
the propensity to act upon an opportunity (e.g., experiment or innovate) depends on
one’s perception of control over the environment (Shapero 1975). Individuals that
are high on impact believe they have an inﬂuence over outcomes through ability,
effort, and skills. Such beliefs should increase attempts directed toward the accom-
plishment of goals. Impactful individuals should tend to be innovative because they
feel able to shape their environment (Spreitzer 2008), can affect strategic and
operating outcomes related to their work (Spreitzer et al. 1997), and anticipate
success.
Active Social Strategy for Networking Since impactful individuals see themselves
as able to determine the outcomes on the environment, they should feel capable to
manipulate the social environment in their interest. They should feel secure to
approach new people and expand their social networks.
5
Direction of Inﬂuence Between Empowerment
and Entrepreneurship
The directionality of empowerment relationships is not yet clear enough (Spreitzer
2008; Seibert et al. 2011; Boudrias et al. 2014). The relationship between empow-
erment and entrepreneurship may not be unidirectional. Over time, entrepreneur-
ship can also affect individuals’ perception of empowerment. Entrepreneurship
provides autonomy, independence, and a feeling of being in control of one’s life
(Andersson 2008; Benz and Frey 2004; Blanchﬂower 2004). Blanchﬂower (2004),
on his review of self-employment data from 70 countries, found that entrepreneurs
were more likely to report “control over their lives” than people who were
employed. Business activities often relate to the capacity to exercise autonomous
action and purposeful behavior, which constitute empowerment manifestations
(e.g., Wolf et al. 2015; Datta and Gailey 2012; Torri and Martinez 2014). People
with businesses often deﬁne self-interests and assert choice, and consider them-
selves competent enough to have an impact on meaningful goals to them. Also, the
experience of success can generate feelings of empowerment (Diener and Biswas-
Diener 2005). Entrepreneurial success may lead to empowerment by heightening
The Importance of Empowerment in Entrepreneurship
197

positive emotions and attitudes such as fulﬁllment or satisfaction. Previous ﬁndings
support this reasoning showing that entrepreneurs are more likely to report higher
satisfaction with their lives in comparison to employed people (Blanchﬂower
2004). Research suggests that positive emotions lead to attitudinal and behavioral
characteristics manifesting empowerment such feelings of self-conﬁdence, energy,
engaged activity, and creativity (Diener and Biswas-Diener 2005). Entrepreneur-
ship may as well increase perceptions of competence, self-determination, meaning,
and impact, because such dimensions endure with the work context (Bandura 1997;
Spreitzer 1995; Lee and Koh 2001). For example, bringing forth new business ideas
and earning a living independently may lead to perceptions of self-determination
and meaningfulness. Mutual reinforcement between empowerment and entrepre-
neurship can thus occur. Empowerment and entrepreneurship may interact in a
reinforcing loop towards active performance (e.g., personal initiative behavior) and
change. We mentioned that entrepreneurial success might lead to perceptions of
competence, self-determination, meaning, and impact. Such perceptions may then
be drawn upon to enable more active and innovative actions. Psychological empow-
erment and entrepreneurship are both constructs that describe active “bottom-up”
processes towards changes in work settings. Therefore, it is possible to think that
empowerment and entrepreneurship are complementary and reciprocally inﬂuence
each other. However, complementarity and reciprocity does not imply that both
occur simultaneously, nor that they have equal effects, impact or strength. Further
research should attempt to clarify the directionality and dynamics of the relation-
ship between empowerment and entrepreneurship (e.g., Boudrias et al. 2014).

The Role of Empowerment in Promoting
Entrepreneurial Success
As it has been pointed out, there is empirical evidence showing that the different
components of empowerment are signiﬁcant antecedents of the main characteristics
of active performance (see Fig. 3). Moreover, there is empirical evidence
suggesting that both empowerment and active performance enhance entrepreneurial
behavioral outcomes (goal achievement, proactive behavior and innovation) and
then entrepreneurial success. Based on our previous review, it may be hypothesized
that empowerment will display two avenues of inﬂuence on entrepreneurial behav-
ioral outcomes. One avenue depicts a direct inﬂuence of empowerment on behav-
ioral outcomes, while the other suggests the inﬂuence on these behavioral outcomes
through the characteristics of active performance. As Frese (2009) pointed out, the
characteristics of active performance are also signiﬁcant antecedents of behavioral
outcomes that, in turn contribute, to entrepreneurial success. Thus, according to our
proposed model empowerment plays a signiﬁcant role to promote relevant behav-
ioral outcomes. Based on the theoretical models reviewed and the empirical
evidence already existing we emphasize in our model the role of empowerment,

and its core dimensions, as a signiﬁcant antecedent of behaviors leading to entre-
preneurial success. Moreover, in this process, active performance may in turn
strengthen empowerment promoting a positive spiral that will increase the proba-
bilities of entrepreneurial success. According to this model, empowerment can be
an effective way to promote entrepreneurial behaviors and outcomes.
7
Empowerment as a Way to Promote Entrepreneurship
Both socio-structural and psychological approaches to empowerment have focused
primary attention on contextual factors as facilitators of empowerment (Seibert
et al. 2011; Spreitzer 2008, 1996; Anna-Maija 2015). Based on research, we
integrate contextual elements and suggest interventions that have potential to
facilitate and promote empowerment and entrepreneurship.
Empowering Through Mentoring Transformational leaders (those who show con-
sideration and inspire) generate more empowerment perceptions among their fol-
lowers (Spreitzer 2008; Avolio et al. 2004). Extensive research provides consistent
results in regards of the relationship between transformational leadership and
empowerment (e.g., Fuller et al. 1999; Kark et al. 2003; Avolio et al. 2004).
Mentors, as leaders, are usually experienced persons who train and counsel people
into new work roles. Mentors who show consideration and inspire should also
increase empowerment perceptions. Mentoring programs based on a trusting-
supportive relationship (e.g., El Hallam and St-Jean 2016) can serve to enhance
empowerment perceptions and in turn contribute to an active approach towards
entrepreneurship. Based on the psychological empowerment theory (Spreitzer
1995; Seibert et al. 2011; Sun et al. 2012), mentors who encourage prospect
entrepreneurs to set own goals and self-manage their tasks, who coach and inform,
and who create practices that support empowerment (e.g., a supportive peer
relationship) contribute to facilitate an active orientation towards work (i.e., psy-
chological empowerment). Experienced entrepreneurs may help prospect entrepre-
neurs providing strategic information on how to get funding, giving feedback and
guidance regarding goals, and serve to validate innovative ideas. Altogether, such
elements should contribute to increase empowerment and, thus, predispose active
action characteristics of entrepreneurship.
Empowerment in Entrepreneurship Training Entrepreneurship trainings encour-
age people to participate in the market by creating new businesses or improving
existing ones. Such trainings provide basics skills and knowledge to succeed in
entrepreneurship differing in content, length, and target groups (Bischoff et al.
2014). However, the results of entrepreneurship trainings are spurious. Even though
some entrepreneurship trainings have proved to be effective (e.g., Gielnik et al.
2015; Glaub et al. 2014), the overall conclusiveness of their effectiveness cannot be
totally asserted (Glaub and Frese 2011; McKenzie and Woodruff 2013). Regardless
of the current effectiveness of such programs, we posit that such trainings can be
200
D. Henao-Zapata and J.M. Peiro´

improved by introducing the socio-structural elements of empowerment that pro-
duce an active orientation towards work. In other words, without the elements that
facilitate empowerment such programs would predictably fail in encouraging
relevant components that facilitate an active approach to entrepreneurship (i.e.,
competence, self-determination, meaning, and impact), and therefore have lesser
impact. Research shows positive results in the relationship between the different
elements of socio-structural empowerment (e.g., social support) and the psycho-
logical experience of empowerment (Seibert et al. 2011, 2004; Neal 2014).
According to the Job Characteristics theory (Hackman and Oldham 1980), and
the psychological empowerment theory (Spreitzer 1995, 2008), a work environ-
ment design including elements such as extensive use of training, open information
sharing, decentralization, participative decision-making, and contingent compen-
sation serves to empower individuals. Previous research supports this hypothesis
suggesting that the use of such practices does inﬂuence individual levels of psy-
chological empowerment (Ai Noi and Youyan 2017) and generate consequent
outcomes such increased task performance (e.g., Avolio et al. 2004; Seibert et al.
2004, 2011; Spreitzer 2008). In order to increase effectiveness, entrepreneurship
trainings should include a participative work climate, promote wider control span
(e.g., ownership and economic independence), establish performance-based feed-
back (e.g., assigning tasks, setting goals, or developing business plans), and offer
contingent compensation at completion of the course (e.g., access to resources such
computers or consultancy). In any case, such strategies should accompany training
on speciﬁc entrepreneurial skills that evoke perceptions of psychological empow-
erment. For example, modules that include development of goals that are self-set, in
relation to the participants’ businesses (or ideas), should contribute to generate a
sense of competence, self-determination, meaning, and impact. After the training,
such programs should also provide access to further information (e.g., websites),
foster inclusion and participation in the market (e.g., giving microcredits to high
potential entrepreneurs), and strengthen social accountability and build organiza-
tional capacity (e.g. fomenting meetings or mentoring between participants), to
facilitate active engagement in entrepreneurship.

Further Research
Further research should test the assumptions and relations between variables
discussed along this chapter. A logical step to follow would be the generation of
sound measurement instruments specifying indicators of competence, self-
determination, meaning, and impact in entrepreneurship. The development of
such instruments needs to take into account the distinctive features of empower-
ment in entrepreneurship (e.g., creating task-related indicators), their relational
foundations (e.g., indicating predictive validity), and assure comparability across
different settings and samples (e.g., testing hypotheses on entrepreneurs from
different industries). Such measures should be suitable to assert direct impact and

ideally identify changes over time. Establishing a nomological network identifying
antecedents and outcomes of empowerment in entrepreneurship can be useful for
this
purpose.
Further
research

greater
integration
(or differentiation) between psychological empowerment theory and theories of
proactive behavior in entrepreneurship. The strength of the theoretical relationships
between psychological empowerment and various entrepreneurial attitudes and
behaviors compares favorably with some of the most robust theories in the ﬁeld
of entrepreneurship (e.g., personal initiative theory, Frese and Fay 2001). A number
of interesting questions arise. For example, does empowerment explain why or how
some people manifest more personal initiative in entrepreneurship? Does empow-
erment mediate the relationship between personal initiative and entrepreneurial
performance? Answer to such kind of questions would help to integrate similar
theories of proactivity, and might extend and clarify the range of processes and
outcomes to which different theories apply. Last, efforts aiming to clarify the
directionality of the relationship between empowerment and entrepreneurship
may entail a fertile direction for research. To date, we do not know much about
the directionality of the relationship between both constructs. Although theory and
research suggest mutual interaction between empowerment and entrepreneurship,
longitudinal studies and dynamic analyses of their relationships are still needed to
clarify issues regarding directionality and reciprocal effects.

Conclusion
This chapter links the components of psychological empowerment to characteris-
tics of active performance in entrepreneurship. Based on the active, persistent, and
change-oriented behaviors associated with psychological empowerment, we argued
that empowerment might contribute to entrepreneurship. We took initial steps in
drawing the rationale and identifying empirical evidence about the relationship
between empowerment and entrepreneurial behavior. We hope such steps encour-
age further development of theory and research that advances groundwork of
empowerment in entrepreneurship.

Leadership Styles and Entrepreneurship
Hugo De Juan Jorda´n, Daniel Palacios-Marque´s, and Carlos Devece
Abstract This paper reviews the main leadership styles and analyzes their effect
on entrepreneurship. They determine how the relationship of entrepreneurs with
their work teams is key to achieving higher organizational performance. It also
analyzes under what circumstances a particular leadership style may be more
appropriate depending on the environment of each company. The leaders of an
organization must commit to the digital transformation of the organization and,
therefore, promote the improvement of its efﬁciency, effectiveness, sustainability
and innovation.

Introduction
Leaders, by deﬁnition, are at the top of organizations and their actions often change
the course of their organizations and, in some cases, that of entire societies (Judge
et al. 2008). We can understand by leadership styles as the pattern of attitudes that
leaders support and the behaviors they exhibit (Anderson and Sun 2015), or as
deﬁned by (Bass 1997) the form of leadership that a leader adopts towards their
followers.
This chapter reviews and highlights the best-known and useful leadership styles
for a business, from its origins to the present times of the digital economy,
considering that different ages require different types of leadership (Firlej and
Kluz 2016).

1.1
Revision of the Literature
The ﬁrst theory of leadership styles would be that of the “great man,” a nineteenth-
century popular belief that says leaders are born, not made. According to this
theory, popularised by the Scottish writer Thomas Carlyle in the 1840s, leaders
are born with leader characteristics within given social, political or economic
circumstances (Kane 2015).
In the twentieth century a systematic approach to study leadership skills
appeared, identifying speciﬁc features that could prompt someone to be an authen-
tic leader. Those “traits” or characteristics were recognised by contrasting followers
and leaders, and identifying the main factors of an effective leader (Kane 2015). In
his analysis of more than 100 leadership studies, Stogdill (1948) identiﬁed ﬁve
factors that inﬂuence leadership success: capacity, responsibility, achievement,
participation and position or status.
The work of Ohio State Studies, started in 1945 and continued through the
1950s, represented a turning point in the investigation of leadership behaviors
(Stogdill and Coons 1957).
1.2
Lewin’s Leadership Styles
In 1939, psychologist Kurt Lewin conducted a study (Lewin et al. 1939) that
identiﬁed three main leadership styles and the effect each style had on team
members under that leadership:
1. Autocratic leaders, who make decisions without consulting team members,
although their opinion might be useful. It is a style that could be appropriate
when it comes to making decisions quickly and there is no need for input from
the team.
2. Democratic leaders, who make decisions in the end but include team members in
the decision-making process. This leadership style encourages creativity, and
team members are often very committed to projects and decisions. As a result,
team members tend to have high job satisfaction and high productivity.
3. Laissez-faire leaders provide to their team members much autonomy in how to
do their tasks, make their own decisions and set their own goals. These leaders
help with means and guidance if needed, but they tend not to get involved. This
freedom could mean high job satisfaction, but also could be detrimental if
followers do not administer their time properly or do not have the knowledge,
skills or self-motivation to do their job effectively.

1.3
The Likert Management System
The Rensis Likert management system (Likert 1961) puts forward four categories
of leadership styles:
1. The exploitative-authoritative. This type of leadership is exempliﬁed by the
leader who has little conﬁdence in their subordinates, and therefore makes all
the decisions for the group. In this case, the team is driven by fears and pressure.
2. The benevolent-authoritative. In this type of leadership the conﬁdence in sub-
ordinates is low. Leaders make decisions without the team and use some kind of
reward to stimulate their followers.
3. The consultative-advisory leader has a higher level of conﬁdence in their
followers and, therefore, asks for their help when deciding.
4. Participatory leader. This type of leadership shows a high grade of conﬁdence in
their followers and motivation is based on achievement. The whole organization
is responsible for success or failure.
1.4
The Blake-Mouton Managerial Grid
The Blake-Mouton managerial grid model (Blake and Mouton 1964) highlights the
most appropriate style of leadership based on two behavioral dimensions:
•
Concern for results: This is the degree to which a leader emphasizes concrete
goals, organizational efﬁciency and high productivity in deciding the best way to
accomplish a task. In a task-oriented leadership style the focus is on doing the
job. The leader deﬁnes the work and roles required, puts the structures in place,
as well as plans, organizes and monitors the work.
•
Concern for people: This is the extent to which a leader considers the needs,
interests, and personal development areas of team members when deciding the
best way to accomplish a task. With a people-oriented leadership style the focus
is on the organization, support and development of team members. This partici-
patory style encourages good teamwork and creative collaboration.
Based on these two dimensions of behavior the Blake and Mouton (1978) model
establishes ﬁve leadership styles:
1. The impoverished management style—Low level of concern for results/low
level of concern for the team. This leadership style (also called “indifferent”
leadership) is fundamentally unsuccessful because it brings disorganization and
disagreement. It shows no interest for creating systems that should facilitate
ﬁnishing the job, neither does it create a satisfactory team environment.
2. The “Produce or perish” Style (also known as “authoritarian” or “obedient-to-
authority” managers)—High concern for results/low concern for team. Leaders
consider that their followers are just an instrument to an end. The needs of the
followers are subordinated to its productivity. This kind of leader is autocratic,
Leadership Styles and Entrepreneurship
209

has severe working rules, policies and procedures and may even consider
sanction as a means to motivate followers.
3. The “Middle-of-the-Road” Style—Average concern for results/Average concern
for the team. A “middle-of-the-road” or “status quo” manager tries to balance
results and people, but this strategy is not as effective as it may sound. Through
continuous commitment, the leader does not inspire high performance and does
not fully meet people’s needs either.
4. The “Country-Club” Style (also known as “complacent” leadership style)—
High concern for the team/Low concern for results. In this style the leader is
fundamentally worried about his/her people requirements and feelings. The
manager believes that if the people are pleased and conﬁdent, they will perform
successfully, which lean towards a very relaxed and fun work environment, but
where productivity suffers due to lack of direction and control.
5. The Team-Management Style—High concern for production/High concern for
the team. It shows a leader who is passionate about his/her work and who does
the best he/she can for the people he/she works with. It is a leader who is
committed to the goals and mission of the organization, who inspires productive
people and works hard to make people strive for great results. This leader is a
stimulating ﬁgure who takes care of their teams, which creates an environment
based on trust and respect, and leads to high satisfaction, motivation and
excellent results.
1.5
Hersey-Blanchard Situational Leadership
Based on the work of Hersey and Blanchard (1969), the situational leadership
theory suggested that leadership styles depend on the environment or “situation”
in which a leader needs to act and should change when the situation and the needs of
subordinates change. The essence (Blanchard et al. 1993) is that there are two
dimensions that concur in order to change the leader’s behavior:
•
Supportive behavior. It refers to showing socio-emotional concern for
subordinates
•
Managerial behavior. Meaning that leaders need to delegate everyday jobs and
watch over followers.
According to Hersey and Blanchard (1982), both behaviors need to be modu-
lated as a function of the aptitudes and maturity of the followers. If the followers are
experienced and reliable, the leader will only provide motivation and socio-
emotional care, and there will not be necessary to dictate behaviors or give
directives. Nevertheless, for followers who could be insecure or immature, support
behaviors and directives will be more necessary until they boost practice and
knowledge.

1.6
The Path-Goal Theory
Inspired by the work of Georgopoulous et al. (1957) and later by Evans (1970),
House (1971) developed the path-goal theory and then redeﬁned and updated it in
an article in 1996 (House 1996). According to this theory, the best leadership
approach can be identiﬁed, which is based on the needs of the team, the task they
are doing and the environment in which they are working. If the leader wants his or
her team to reach their goals, he or she needs to help, support, and motivate them.
This can be done in three ways:
•
Help them to identify and achieve their goals.
•
Eliminate obstacles, thus improving performance.
•
Provide appropriate rewards along the way.
Four different leadership styles can be used in this case:
1. Supportive Leadership—when the leader focuses on relationships, shows sensi-
tivity to the individual needs of team members and considers their interests. This
style of leadership is best when tasks are repetitive or stressful.
2. Directive Leadership—when the leader communicates objectives and assigns
well-deﬁned tasks. This leadership style suites best when jobs are unstructured,
or when tasks are complicated and followers are inexpert.
3. Participative leadership—In this style, the leader focuses on mutual participa-
tion, trusts the team and considers their ideas and opinions before deciding. This
style suites best when followers have experience, when the jobs are difﬁcult, and
when followers want to express their opinion.
4. Achievement-Oriented Leadership—The leader sets stimulating and inspiring
goals and objectives for the followers and trusts their skills, which is why he/she
expects them all to work well and maintain high standards. This style works best
when team members are unmotivated or unchallenged in their work.
1.7
The Six Emotional Leadership Styles
Daniel Goleman, Richard Boyatzis and Annie McKee described six different styles
of emotional leadership in their book “Primal Leadership” (Goleman et al. 2002):
Visionary, Coaching, Afﬁliative, Democratic, Pacesetting and Commanding. These
six styles should be used depending on the speciﬁc needs of the situation and the
people the leader is dealing with (Goleman et al. 2002):
1. Commanding: This leader tries to make the team fulﬁll orders immediately with
concrete and precise instructions.
2. Visionary: This style of charismatic leadership seeks to mobilize people through
the leader´s vision, making them see what their role will be within it. The
visionary leader has a clear picture of where to go and tries to get the team to
share this same way of looking at the future.

211

3. Afﬁliative: It is based on building emotional bonds in the group, thus enhancing
harmony among its members to create a pleasant work environment. This style
gives great relevance to the people, to the detriment of the tasks and organiza-
tional objectives.
4. Democratic: It is based on the idea that decisions must be taken jointly among all
members of the team. Therefore, people who follow this leadership style tend to
frequently meet with all team members.
5. Pacesetting: It is based on the idea of using oneself as an example to direct
people. The leader sets high standards of performance and challenges, but he or
she wants things done in his or her own way.
6. Coaching: The leader seeks the professional development of the team members.
He or she helps them identify their strengths and weaknesses and sets long-term
goals in their careers and also provides feedback and guidance on their profes-
sional performance.
1.8
Randle’s Leadership Matrix
The Flamholtz and Randle Matrix of Leadership Styles (Flamholtz and Randle
2007) shows the best style (containing from “autocratic/benevolently autocratic” to
“consensus/laissez-faire”) based on people’s ability to work autonomously and on
how creative or mechanical an individual has to be able in order to ﬁnalize his tasks.
The vertical axis represent the “programming” of the task (from tasks with speciﬁc
steps or instructions to the creative ones where it is up to the person to decide the
best way to complete it). The horizontal axis represents the individual’s aptitude
and predilection for self-government (considering his/her education, skills, moti-
vation and desire for feedback, collaboration or freedom). For instance, a profes-
sional with a high level of instruction, skills, motivation and individuality is
expected to want autonomy. On the other hand, someone with low enthusiasm
and poor abilities will desire and need more feedback and interaction from the
leader to ﬁnish his/her tasks correctly.
1.9
Transformational Leadership
The book “Leadership” (Burns 1978) written by leadership authority James
McGregor Burns presented the model of transformational leadership. He deﬁned
this new concept as a process where “leaders and their followers raise one another
to higher levels of morality and motivation”. One decade later, Bernard M. Bass
deﬁned the concept of transformational leadership. Concerning his book (Bass
1985), this type of leadership style is a model of integrity, establishes clear goals
and objectives, generates high expectations, motivates the team, offers support and
212
H. De Juan Jorda´n et al.

recognition to the people, stirs people’s emotions, makes followers look beyond
their self-interest, inspires followers to achieve the unlikely.
Transformational leadership “increases awareness of collective interest among
members of the organization and helps them achieve their collective goals”
(Waddell and Pio 2015). Transformational leaders inspire team members because
they expect the best from each of them and feel responsible for their actions. Also,
this type of leader provides information, advice, support and encouragement to
workers, increasing their motivation and optimizing their performance (Bass 1997).
Wang et al. (2011) found that transformational leadership was strongly related to
job satisfaction among followers, satisfaction with the leader, motivation, commit-
ment to organization and effort, three types of job performance (task, contextual
and creative) and even group and organizational performance.
According to these authors (Bass and Avolio 1997; Bass and Riggio 2006), the
transformational components are:
•
Idealized inﬂuence or charisma. It is the degree to which the leader behaves
admirably, in a way that causes followers to identify themselves with that leader
(Judge et al. 2004). Leaders of this type are described as charismatic and are
perceived by followers as possessing a high degree of morality, trust, and
integrity. They show conviction, emphasize trust, position themselves on difﬁ-
cult issues and emphasize the importance of purpose, commitment and ethical
consequences of decisions. These leaders are admired as role models generating
pride, loyalty, trust and alliance around a common purpose.
•
Inspirational Motivation. It is the degree to which the leader articulates that
vision that is attractive and inspiring to the followers and challenges them with
high standards, transmits optimism about achieving goals and lends meaning to
daily tasks (Judge et al. 2004). These leaders have the ability to motivate their
employees to make them rethink how to solve problems, encouraging them to be
innovative and creative.
•
Intellectual stimulation. It is the degree to which the leader questions assump-
tions, takes risks, asks for ideas from the followers, and encourages creativity in
the followers (Judge et al. 2004). These are leaders who question old assump-
tions, traditions and beliefs, inspire new perspectives and ways of doing things,
and encourage the expression of ideas. If a collaborator is wrong, they will not be
punished by making the issue public, but are encouraged to contribute ideas even
if these ideas do not agree with those of their responsible.
•
Individualized Consideration: The degree to which the leader meets the needs of
each follower, acts as their mentor or coach, and listens to their concerns and
needs (Judge et al. 2004). They are leaders who consider individual needs,
abilities, and aspirations, promote a two-way communication with their collab-
orators, not just a mere transmission of information, which is why they are
considered as people who listen.

1.10
Transactional Leadership
The transactional leadership style “focuses on promoting the individual interests of
leaders and their followers by setting goals, following up and controlling outcomes”
(Waddell and Pio 2015). This style is born assuming that the followers will obey
their leader since they have taken that job. The company pays the employees in
exchange for their endeavor and completion of a short-term task (Spahr 2014).
This leadership style, in some situations, implies some beneﬁts, such as clarifying
the roles and responsibilities of all members. Besides, since transactional leadership
judges team members in terms of performance, people who are ambitious or
motivated by external rewards—including ﬁnancial compensation—often thrive
under this leadership style. The disadvantage of transactional leadership style is
that it could be considered disturbing and amoral in itself. It is difﬁcult for team
members to improve their job satisfaction and this style even promote a certain staff
turnover. Moreover, it is not recommended for knowledge-based or creative work
at all.
On the other hand, the characteristics of transactional leadership lie in the
establishment of unpredictable reinforcements and action at times of divergence
with the organization’s plans (Bass 1997). These leaders monitor the activities of
their subordinates to avoid errors and deviations from established procedures and
standards (Bass and Riggio 2006).
Since leaders can present behavioral patterns that combine elements of different
leadership styles, Bass and Avolio (1997) propose the Full Range Leadership (FRL)
model that includes the components of both types of leadership to form a whole,
whose results should be the satisfaction of the needs of the individuals and the
group, the extra effort required for the attainment of the shared objectives, and the
efﬁciency and effectiveness of the organization.
1.11
Other Leadership Styles
Servant leadership is a style that focuses on the thriving of those who are being led
and at the same time served by the leader (Stone et al. 2004). Servant leaders start
from the natural sense of service ﬁrst, to ensure that the priority needs of others are
addressed ﬁrst rather than their own (Greenleaf 1970). A “service leader” leads just
focusing on the needs of his/her team. He/she leads by example with generosity,
and has high integrity. This style facilitates a positive corporate culture, and may
achieve a high motivation between team members (Greenleaf 1977).
Other leadership styles can be mentioned according to Anderson and Sun (2015),
such as:
Ideological leadership developed as a separate style in the historiometric anal-
ysis of (Strange and Mumford (2002) on 60 historical leaders. While the vision of
the charismatic leader, with whom the ideological leader has so much in common,
214
H. De Juan Jorda´n et al.

is forward-looking and emphasizes the social needs and changes that are needed to
produce a desired future, the vision of the ideological leader emphasizes “personal
values, standards that must be maintained and the derivation of meaning through
adherence to these standards” (Strange and Mumford 2002).
Pragmatic leadership is characterized by the awareness of the practical and
everyday difﬁculties that individuals and companies have to deal with, and by its
focus on designing and selecting cost-effective solutions. The pragmatic leadership
style tries to motivate others by appealing to their own proﬁt and demonstrating that
the planned solutions will achieve shared objectives (Anderson and Sun 2015). This
style of pragmatic leadership requires a deep understanding of the social network of
the parties interested in the problems, on the one hand, and the economic and
technical issues associated with these problems and their solutions, on the
other hand.
Authentic leadership has received considerable attention and research support
over the last decade (Wang et al. 2014). Authentic leadership is a behavior pattern
of the leader based on promoting psychological capacities and a positive ethical
climate, encouraging greater self-awareness, an internalized moral perspective, the
balanced processing of information, and relational transparency in the way in which
the leader works with their followers, “thus fostering positive self-development”
(Walumbwa et al. 2008). Four dimensions can be established: Self-awareness,
Relational transparency, Balanced processing, and Internalized moral perspective.
The Ethical leadership style is “the evidence that shows the leader of norma-
tively appropriate behavior at personal actions and also at interpersonal relation-
ships, inﬂuencing to followers with such a behavior” (Brown and Trevi~no 2006).
Basically, an ethical leader is a moral person (a person who considers themselves to
be just, honest, trustworthy and a decision-making person), a model of moral
behavior (who practices what he or she preaches and is seen as an attractive role
model); and a moral manager (who considers ethics as an explicit part of his or her
leadership agenda and uses rewards to make followers responsible for ethical
behavior).

Conclusions
The current digital era is marked by several key structural changes that are
reshaping leadership (Firlej and Kluz 2016) such as a fast and deep technological
change; a dynamic spread of information due to globalization; a change from a
physical world to a world of knowledge and ﬁnally a more spread and less
hierarchical organizational structures. The leaders of any organization must commit
to its digital transformation and thus promote the improvement of its efﬁciency,
effectiveness, sustainability and innovation. In this sense, its leadership style should
be less traditional, more conversational, open and collaborative (Demirkan et al.
2016). Not only do the best leaders have a strategy to go digital, but they share it
with employees throughout the organization. They have digital skills and the ability
Leadership Styles and Entrepreneurship
215

to learn new digital skills fast. They make decisions quickly, without bureaucratic
bottlenecks. They emphasize diversity and listen to younger executives in order to
ﬁnd alternatives to the digital transformation of their organizations (Gregory 2016).
Leadership must be guided by an attitude of openness and a genuine hunger for
knowledge, capable of understanding the impact of disruptive technologies.
Leaders need to know their limits and how to acquire the knowledge they lack. A
leader of the future looks more like a community manager than an authoritarian
manager (Firlej and Kluz 2016).
Digital leadership can be deﬁned by the leader’s contribution to the transition
towards a knowledge society and their mastery of technology (Firlej and Kluz
2016). When e-Leadership (leadership with “e” as in “electronic”) is referred to, it
is the leadership in the new age, which is characterized by the rapid development of
technology, a global economy where businesses constantly move across borders to
wherever they can make a proﬁt (Wang and Torrisi-Steele 2016). E-leadership is
necessary to solve many of the problems created by the information age.
Leaders should use Information Technology to understand and inform their
stakeholders about the changes that are occurring in their business environment in
order to reduce geographic gaps and to make their future sustainable with positive
growth rates (Vutukuru and Mohan 2016). Leaders have an obligation to keep up
with the current global revolution. They must understand technology, not only
because of its enabling capacity, but also because of its revolutionary power (Firlej
and Kluz 2016).
For all these reasons, there is a certain academic consensus that the best
leadership style that can deal with the current world where the digital revolution
is at its peak is the transformational style (Cockburn and Smith 2016). In addition,
the transformational leadership style is very focused on adopting rapid changes,
whether in technology or in society (Vutukuru and Mohan 2016) and, today more
than ever, this is a critical issue.

Co-operation and Conﬂict in International
Entrepreneurs When Cultures Collide
Ursula F. Ott
Abstract This chapter introduces the framework of culturally-rooted ‘co-operative
cheating’ for international entrepreneurship which provides different degrees of
hierarchy and group behavior in individualistic entrepreneurship and group-
centered loyalty. International entrepreneurs are exposed to different cultural
behavior and workplace cheating. The typologies of co-operative cheating are
used to understand the clashes of cultures and how avoid conﬂicts by offering
incentives to co-operate and to divert culturally-rooted cheating.
Keywords Co-opetition • Entrepreneurship • Cultural behavior

Introduction
This chapter considers the occurrence of cooperative and cheating behavior on the
international stage and the design of incentives to encourage a better understanding
between different cultural schemes. In a globalized world, working together with
people of different cultural backgrounds is a very common situation. The focus of
this chapter is on international entrepreneurship behavior in a cross-cultural con-
text. Market and technology access of multinational enterprises (MNE) has gener-
ated collaborations between different cultures and company types. The expertise of
local entrepreneurs dealing with subsidiary relationships of MNEs emphasizes the
complexities of cultures co-operating and cheating in a work context and offer an
opportunity to analyze cultural patterns of behavior. Transferring cheating from the
social group context to the work place as an outlet of groups of the society,
Challinger (1995) illustrates the very worst cases of workplace crime by reporting
killings in factories by disgruntled workers in China and the USA. The author
points out that the events suggest that there are no cultural impediments to work-
place deviance and that it even indicates workplace crime is a global problem. He
identiﬁes workplace crime as comprising offences that cause loss to an employer.
Immediate losses are obvious but there are also some other associated and indirect

costs such as reduced proﬁts, increased insurance premium, higher costs for addi-
tional security and internal control, decreased employee activity, lowered morale,
decreased service quality and damage to company image. Furthermore, the losses
for government and public were listed and it seems that it is important to analyze
culturally-rooted cheating behavior. The research question in this context is: How
are cross-cultural characteristics of cooperation and conﬂict inﬂuencing interna-
tional collaborations of entrepreneurs and other company forms?
The results of a cultural anthropological approach leads to the conceptualizing of
the factors contributing to co-operative cheating with four archetypes to incentivize
co-operative behavior and avoid culturally rooted mishaps in cross-border trans-
actions. The model works in both directions for industrialized and emerging
countries. Firstly, we use a two dimensional way of ‘hierarchy-group’ in combina-
tion with power distance and individualism Ott (2006) to come up with a continuum
‘hierarchy-equality’ and ‘individualism-group’. This is the conceptual background
to develop archetypes of co-operative cheating in relation to the country clusters
and hierarchy/group analysis. Finally, we consider that some cultures have an
incentive to cheat due to their social and cultural background and therefore offer
incentives to encourage a co-operative mechanism for international collaboration of
entrepreneurs.

Theoretical Background
2.1
Culture and Corruption
On the international stage, traditions and common ways of thinking can be viewed
as an invisible set of a cognitive program rooted in the common national culture. As
Denison and Mishra (1995) emphasize that social scientists over a 50 year period
(Weber 1930; Mead 1934; Radcliffe-Brown 1952; Pettigrew 1979; Trice and Beyer
1984; D’Andrade 1987) viewed culture as a system of socially transmitted behavior
patterns which serves to relate human communities to their ecological settings.
Pettigrew (1979) considers that the elements of culture are “in varying degrees
interdependent, and there is convergence in the way they relate to the functional
problems of integration, control and commitment” (p. 576).
Theoretically, Toh and DeNisi (2003) point out that cultures have similar
concerns for justice, but the meaning of the term may differ and found evidence
that in feminine and collectivist cultures, justice is served when moral duties and
interpersonal responsibilities are met. Rewards such as recognition, status and
social support are more important than pay. Chen et al. (1998) propose a cultural
model of co-operation. They ﬁnd patterned differences in the instrumental and
expressive motives of individualists and collectivists and offer six culturally
contrasting cooperation mechanisms. There is this tension between cooperation
and conﬂict which arises in many social situations and we can add the perspective
220
U.F. Ott

of Denison and Mishra (1995) who focus on culture as a critical aspect of the
adaptation of social organizations.
There is an underlying problem of conﬂict, cheating, and corruption occurring in
international ventures. The motives, attitudes and values behind the different
cultures when it comes to cheating are diverse. Corruption as a particular form
and important issue for international entrepreneurship and needs to be investigated
from a cultural perspective in order to understand ways of dealing and circumventing
related problems.
Husted (1999), Habib and Zurawicki (2002) and Park (2003) consider cheating
in connection with corruption and culture as well as the Hofstede dimensions. If a
corrupt country is made of high masculinity and power distance, then research for a
country where cheating at the work place is prominent should be as well be using
these dimensions and additionally individualism as a reference for personal or
collective achievement. Especially, individualism Chen et al. (1998) and Toh and
DeNisi (2003) can be relevant for cheating, as the continuum of individualism-
collectivism can be strongly related to group behavior and loyalty. Using
Hofstede’s dimensions, Barkema and Vermeulen (1997) emphasize the importance
of power distance, individualism and masculinity, emphasizing clusters of countries
which have a similar hierarchical and group behavior structure (Individualism/
Masculinity). Getz and Volkema (2001) and Park (2003) investigate the cultural
indices of power distance, individualism, masculinity and uncertainty avoidance in
the context of corruption as a form conﬂictual behavior in international settings. If
we assume that cheating is as global as co-operating, then individualistic societies
would be encouraged to cheat for their own beneﬁt in order to get promoted or
obtain personal perks. Whereas, members of collectivist societies cheat in order to
support the group, to help the group as such to ﬂourish and to improve the situation
of one group compared to another.
To develop the ‘individualist-collectivist’ perspective further, an additional
criterion ‘masculinity/femininity’ as another feature of group behavior and the
dimension of ‘power distance’ can be added to understand a cultural context
‘group behavior—hierarchy’ in order to come up with a two dimensional tool for
analysis. This links the grid/group analysis Douglas (1970), Mars (1994) and Ott
(2006) and our model enlarges therefore to a cultural model of co-operative
cheating. The model uses incentives as a mechanism for cooperation (Chen et al.
1998; Ferrin and Dirks 2003; Bottom et al. 2006).
2.2
The Concept of Global Hierarchy/Group
The starting point of cultural analysis and the comparison of behavioral patterns is
in the 70s, when Douglas (1970) introduced Grid/Group classiﬁcations. This was
followed by Natural Symbols (1970), in which Douglas emphasized classiﬁcation
in two dimensions Group (meaning a general boundary around a community) shows
the horizontal axis and Grid (regulation) on the vertical axis. The Group dimension
Co-operation and Conﬂict in International Entrepreneurs When Cultures Collide
221

measures how much of people’s lives are controlled by the group they live in. An
individual needs to accept constraints on his/her behavior by the mere fact of
belonging to a group. For a group to continue to exist there will be some collective
pressure to signal loyalty. Grid gives the measure of structure. According to
Douglas (1970), some peoples live in a social environment where they are free of
group pressure and of structural constraints. Important for our research therefore is,
that moving along from zero where everything has to be negotiated ad hoc, moving
along to more comprehensive regulation the groups are likely to be more hierar-
chical. Culture Theory assumes now that four types of cultural bias are present in
any collectivity. Each is based on a type of stable organization that could not endure
if the cultural underpinnings were eroded. Davy (1997) shows the analysis of
irreconcilable conﬂict based on the types of group/grid.
Douglas’s framework of grid/group was used by Mars (1994) to enlarge it to the
workplace, by Hendry (1999) to show the conﬂict of market and hierarchy, by
Altman and Baruch (1999) to compare organizations, organizing and change and by
Ott (2006) to show the relationship between the grid and group in terms of cheating.
The latter framework uses a classiﬁcation of cheating in a global workplace which
combines Hofstede’s cultural dimensions (1983, 1985), Mars (1994) group/grid
cheating and. Hennart’s (1993) cheating and shirking costs to all of these catego-
ries. Ott (2006) comes up with the assumption that cheating could occur in all
societies and the nature of the workplace encourages this behavior. Mars (1994) and
Ott (2006), both, made the mistake to have the column with individualistic and
isolated behavior as a sign of lower group levels on the high end of group behavior
and mixing up the continuum. Thus, this chapter is now going back to Douglas’s
original values and shows individualistic/isolated behavior as a low degree of group
behavior. Hofstede’s indices position the values between 0 and 100 are used and
transferred them in a [0,1] frame (Ott 2006). In Fig. 1, Hofstede’s indices (1983,
1985, 2001) result in an interesting pattern of Western cultures being clustered in
the part where low power distance and high individualism are present. Asian,
African, Latin-American and Arab countries are combined in a hierarchical

collectivist cluster. France, Spain and Italy can be considered as Latin European
cultures with a hierarchical structure yet an individualistic approach. Interestingly,
the cell which is considered for low power distance and collectivist cultures does
not have many members in it—as this can be seen as a very genuine co-operative,
egalitarian culture.
Using Husted (1999) outcome that high power distant and low individualist
countries have the crucial dimension masculinity to show the propensity to corrup-
tion, the countries in the grey zone of Fig. 2 are those which are falling into this
description. The diagram below clearly points out the connection between the
individualism score and the corruption index, similarly to power distance and
individualism.
Though there is a clear cut into Western industrialized countries and Asian,
African, Arab and Latin American countries, the hierarchy and group behavior
dimensions in the combination power distance. In order to come up with consistent
results the individualism and power distance scores relate to the corruption index.
Furthermore, the joint sets of individualism, masculinity and power distance as
grid-group, are reﬂected in Fig. 3 which is a summary of the conﬁgurational
approach used for classifying the group-grid Douglas (1970) and Ott (2006) and
corruption relationship in the joint sets of fuzzy set Qualitative Comparative
Analysis (fsQCA) (Ragin 2000, 2008; Rihoux and Ragin 2009; Roig-Tierno et al.
2017). The set-theoretic analysis of the conditions leading to cheating comprised a
new tool to classify cases with similar features. It shows the consistency and
coverage of these cases of national cultures. This approach moves beyond the
description of the cultural dimensions in connection with corruption, but positions
the asymmetric relationship of the joint sets of the national cultures mentioned
above. The conﬁgurational approach in Fig. 3 reﬂects what has been highlighted
about corruption being a function of power distance, individualism and masculinity.
The framework of cultural patterns of cheating and co-operating needs a link
between the works of Mars (1994), Hofstede (1983, 1985) and Ott (2006) and this is
the focus on the four types of cheating in an international workplace based on

different degrees of hierarchy and group behavior. Our next step is to use the
ﬁndings of the literature review and analyze the relationship between Hofstede’s
dimensions and the transparency indices of corruption and bribe. With these results,
we will be able to revisit earlier work on the grid/group concepts. Figure 4 high-
lights the four archetypes developed as individualistic entrepreneurship, isolated
subordination, group-centered loyalty and consensus-sensitive equality/loyalty.
This multidisciplinary approach is based on cultural anthropology and economics
towards developing a cultural theory of co-operative cheating. Incentive theory
provides a suitable lens for the analysis of these problems and is used to design
contracts to induce truthful revelation of hidden information Waller (1988), Chow
et al. (1999), Rankin and Sayre (2000) and Soriano (2005) about cultural
co-operative capabilities.

Incentive Theoretic Model for International
Entrepreneurship Behavior
Jansen et al. (2009) and Kunz and Pfaff (2002) show the relevance of combining
agency theory with culture and motivation. Rankin and Sayre (2000) suggest that
more research is needed focusing on behavior, evaluation, and compensation in

multi-agent environments. This chapter therefore uses a combined approach of
cultural behavior and incentive theory for international entrepreneurship behavior.
The analysis of cultural cheating has so far shown the conceptual approach
towards hierarchy, group and cheating to describe and analyze the culturally-rooted
cheating behavior. Prescribing a collaborative approach towards conﬂict should
generate new insights into the applicability of incentive theory to real-life interna-
tional relationships. In order to generate results in a model of cultural cheating and
co-operating, the relationship between hierarchy (power distance) and achieve-
ments (individualism) as well as hierarchy and relationships (masculinity) will be
analyzed in the context of an international workplace. The emphasis is on HQ and
subsidiary misunderstandings based on the acceptability of corruption in some
countries and the prosecution in others. Culturally sensitive behavior would be
able to eliminate clashes and misunderstandings.
Propositions are important to show the connection between the conﬁguration of
culture and its form of cheating. These propositions are connected to the types of
cheating in a group context: It shows the closeness and the distance between
hierarchical structure and caring for consensus in the group. Co-operating can be
a natural way in a more egalitarian and nurturing society and cheating can be part of
strengthening the ties within the group and mark boundaries to the outside world. In
a more entrepreneurial sense, cultures with higher masculinity will need more
incentives in order to achieve the aim of cultural co-operation. We will therefore
show these propositions in the respective sections of the cultural types of cheating.
The next section links effort levels to Hofstede’s indices and we can ﬁnally develop
incentive schemes based on the propositions and effort levels.
3.1
Cheating and Efforts to Co-operate Culturally
Ott (2006) considers Hofstede’s dimensions to show the distance between the
groups and the related higher or lower effort to bridge the gaps. Thus, a high effort
is for much more distant cultures and a lower effort for close cultural groups and the
disutility of effort stands for higher costs of culture.
Let us now have the effort levels q(e) or a disutility of effort v(e) related to the
cultural dimensions. For MNE headquarter and subsidiary relationships, we take
the Power Distance index as hierarchical structure and connect culturally-rooted
co-operative efforts in the range [0;1] and the same for Individualism/Collectivism
index. We can therefore show the following culturally-rooted co-operative efforts
eCC ¼ (eHPD, eLPD) and eCC ¼ (eInd, eColl). Table 1 shows the relationship between
the efforts for cultural co-operation regarding the hierarchy and the group behavior
in MNEs. Higher efforts to bridge cultural differences when it comes to very
hierarchical societies and very individualist societies need to be rewarded. We
assume that people from societies with ﬂat hierarchies and more collectivist
attitudes will have mechanisms in place to encourage co-operation per se.
226
U.F. Ott

Relevant in international entrepreneurship behavior are the types 2 Group-Cen-
tered Loyalty for family cultures and type 4 Individualistic Entrepreneurship which
will be in the following analyzed and positioned for international collaborations as
the most conﬂictual when they come together.
3.2
Group-Centered Loyalty
Propositions: If employees of the subsidiary workforce have a national culture
which has a high power distance and low individualism score, then it is possible
that cheating occurs due to high group pressure and loyalty.
Let there be incentive schemes designed which are linear contracts and consist of R
as ﬁxed part or salary and royalties rGB as parameters. We can therefore make
royalties dependent on effort levels for high power distance, initialized as HPD, and
effort levels for low individualism, initialized as COLL for collectivism. The
incentive schemes can be written as follows: I ¼ R + rGB(eHPD, eColl). The princi-
pal’s payoff function maximizes the value function V(q) minus the incentives paid
to the agent and the agent’s payoff consist of the incentive payments reduced by the
disutility of effort or the costs of co-operation.
Cheating occurs to break hierarchical structure and emphasize the group Mars
(1994). There will be a strong group code with top-down management and work
culture cheating will occur due to the encouragement to be successful as a group—
tribal rivalries and in-group collectivism are present. In this group, group beneﬁts

are better incentives to encourage co-operation than ﬁnancial rewards and promo-
tion, since the welfare of the group is at the center of interest for the members of this
work group. Family cultures and tribal cultures (see Figs. 1 and 2) are examples for
this type. Shall we see cheating as a type of behavior conducted within the group, or
is it depicted towards out-group members only? Even though ﬁnancial rewards and
bonuses can also be tied to group-performance and distributed to the whole group,
the nature of the reward (i.e., ﬁnancial vs. non-ﬁnancial) is more decisive than the
allocation rule (i.e., individual vs. group based) in this case.
3.3
Individualist Entrepreneurship
The Individualist Entrepreneurship is relevant in MNE relationships with entrepre-
neurs in technology intensive settings where SMEs and entrepreneurs are part of a
subsidiary system. The clash between Western societies with Middle and Far
Eastern societies shows the challenge in understanding cheating and free-riding
behavior in cross-border settings. A purely Western perspective does not adjust to
the complexities of relationships. Thus, the following type brings the market
mechanism into the analysis.
Propositions: If the cultural behavior has a low power distance and high individu-
alism score, then it is possible that the personal achievement is more important
and enables the members of the society to move up in the hierarchy and an
entrepreneurial spirit is triggering performance. Incentive schemes offered
adjust to effort levels and reward motivations.
Let there be incentive schemes designed which are linear contracts and consist of
R as ﬁxed part or salary and royalties rB as parameters. We can therefore make
royalties dependent on effort levels for low power distance, initialized as LPD, and
effort levels for high individualism, initialized as IND. The incentive schemes can
be written as follows: I ¼ F + rB(eLPD, eInd). The principal’s payoff function maxi-
mizes the value function V(q) minus the incentives paid to the agent and the agent’s
payoff consist of the incentive payments reduced by the disutility of effort or the
costs of co-operation.
There is a sense of freedom due to low power distance and an entrepreneur is free
to perform for their own good. The difﬁculty in MNEs occurs due to the individ-
ualist non-co-operative spirit. The capitalist way of thinking will have cheating in
market terms (see Hennart 1993). The incentives for this group need to be targeted
towards the individualistic nature and the possibility of promotion, if culturally
co-operative behavior is established. Thus, the importance of rewarding and
encouraging a high effort level of bridging cultural gaps needs to be considered.
Based on the game theoretical applications in information economics and
contract theory Macho-Stadler and Perez-Castrillo (1997) and Martimort (1996)
incentive contracts reﬂect the clash between the two types of cultural behavior of
international entrepreneurship. The focus is on the effort level and the cultural

pattern of co-operating and cheating. The incentive schemes for the two main types
are now shown in a 2  2 Matrix of individualistic and group-centered behavior
with the possible equilibria outcomes. Table 2 shows the contracts offered when the
four combinations meet.
The table identiﬁes the relevant linear incentive schemes to avoid cultural
clashes Ott (2006). The cultural proﬁles target cultural groups and avoid
culturally-rooted cheating. The group incentives and bonuses play an important
role in this context. We can therefore show that the ﬁxed components in the column
with low individualism or collectivism are based on R relationship rewards and the
column for high individualistic cultures has F for ﬁnancial rewards. The variable
part contains the r royalty indexed with group beneﬁt GB or bonus B and the effort
level as a combination of hierarchical and collectivist/individualist efforts induced.
In order to adjust to the information asymmetry in an international setting, the
various contract designs show the contingencies of cheating dependent on the
cultural dimensions. The contracts encourage the agent to tell the truth about
their efforts. This means that the agent instead of using the effort to cheat uses an
effort to co-operate. The grey shaded zones show the cultural behavior for which it
will be still difﬁcult to ﬁnd cooperation, since their intrinsic behavior has different
cultural roots (individualism versus group behavior).

Conclusion
This chapter combines the grid/group analysis of cultural anthropology Douglas
(1970), Mars (1994) and Ott (2006), cultural models of co-operation Chen et al.
(1998) and rewards as mechanisms of co-operation Chen et al. (1998), Ferrin and
Dirks (2003), Bottom et al. (2006) and Welsh et al. (2016) and developed a new
framework for ‘cooperative cheating’ behavior in international endeavors.
Though it is often considered ethically problematic to deal with bribes and
corruption when dealing with other cultures, it could be shown that hierarchy in
combination with group behavior as well as achievement play a role in an interna-
tionally diverse way of cheating. International entrepreneurs are at the interface of
multinational market entry and host government rules. Their market knowledge and
technological advantage lead to collaborations across borders. Hofstede’s indices
provided a useful basis to show the relationship between hierarchy (power distance)
and group behavior (individualism and masculinity) in country clusters. Family-
oriented cultures show a higher propensity to be corrupt which coincides with the
group-centered loyalty typology. International entrepreneurs have all archetypical
behaviors with a scope from either individualist entrepreneurship to consensus
seeking equality and loyalty. For international entrepreneurship behavior, the
hierarchy/group perspective provides a good basis to consider the incentives for
group-centered loyalty and individualist entrepreneurship. The different effort
levels considering closeness and distance in terms of hierarchy and group behavior
could be connected to the types of cheating. It is more difﬁcult to co-operate for

cultures with high individualism and masculinity scores than for cultures with
collectivism and feminism. The effort levels for cultural co-operation are higher
for individualist and masculine cultures.
The design of the incentive schemes focuses on these effort levels for cultural
co-operation. The linear contracts are either based on rewards for relationship or
ﬁnance, on bonuses for groups and individuals and on the effort level for cultural
co-operation. This leads to a clear deviation from classic incentive schemes which
encourage high levels of effort to perform better. The incentive schemes to avoid
cheating in a cultural environment are targeted to support a co-operative effort in a
cross-cultural work group and a deeper understanding of the cultural differences in
motivation. The likelihood that people will cheat in this setting is reduced by
speciﬁcally targeted incentive schemes to encourage co-operation.
The design of these incentives encourages people to put a high effort into a
positive group performance compared to individualistic career goals. In the future,
developing incentive schemes for international assignments should be dealt with in
a more culturally-sensitive way and as a motivation towards a better understanding
of cultural behavior such as cheating and co-operating. International conﬂicts
should be seen in the way Boone et al. (2010) emphasizes that extrinsic incentive
should be offered to encourage cooperation in case trust or in the international
entrepreneurship case loyalty cannot be assumed to exist in a group per se.
