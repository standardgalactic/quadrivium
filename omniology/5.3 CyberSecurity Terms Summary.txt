consent.
Asset Management
Asset Management is the process of tracking and managing an organization’s physical and
digital assets, including hardware, software, and data.
Asymmetric Encryption
Asymmetric Encryption is a type of encryption that uses two separate keys, a public key for
encryption and a private key for decryption, to securely transmit information over a network.
Application Security Testing
Application Security Testing is the process of identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities and
weaknesses in software applications to prevent cyber attacks.
Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC)
Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC) is a security model that uses attributes or
characteristics of a user or resource to determine access permissions.
Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a protocol used to map a network address (such as an
